Sweden Ni-Cu Properties Resource Estimates June 2009                                                                 1 

1  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   

Blackstone Ventures Inc. (Blackstone) has requested that Reddick Consulting Inc. (RCI) 
prepare a Technical Report on the Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Rormyrberget (Ror) nickel-copper-
cobalt deposits located in Sweden. The report is to support the release of mineral resource 
estimates by Blackstone for the Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror deposits. Information and data 
for the report were obtained from site visits by RCI on June 4 to 6, 2008 as well as from reports 
received directly from Blackstone personnel. This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror deposits are located in northern Sweden 
approximately 600 km north of the capital, Stockholm. The Lainejaur deposit is located 
approximately 100 km northwest of Skelleftea whereas the Lappvattnet and Ror deposits are 
located 30 and 70 km, south and southwest of Skelleftea, respectively. The Lainejaur Project is 
held under a permit covering an area of 31.68 hectares. The permit area covers a historic mine, 
the Lainejaur Nickel deposit. The Lappvattnet deposit is held under a permit covering an area of 
2,480.59 hectares. The Ror deposit is held under a permit covering an area of 2,257.61 hectares.

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror properties are held by Blackstone under the terms of 
an option agreement between North Atlantic Natural Resources (NAN) and Blackstone, whereby 
Blackstone can earn a 100% interest in certain exploration permits in return for the issuance to 
NAN of 3 million units in its capital stock by December 2009. Each unit shall consist of a 
common share and a one year, 2/3 common share purchase warrant. Blackstone is required to 
spend US$5 million in exploration work, including a minimum 18,000 metres of diamond 
drilling, on the properties by December 2009 under the terms of the option agreement. If 
Blackstone initiates a Bankable Feasibility Study on any nickel deposit, NAN will be entitled to 
acquire a 49% interest in that property, subject to a 45 day review period, by paying to 
Blackstone, in cash, an amount equal to 300% of Blackstone's total project expenditures. NAN 
retains rights to certain non-nickel deposits found on the properties. Blackstone holds its Swedish 
properties in a wholly owned subsidiary, Blackstone Nickel AB. 

Blackstone has exceeded required exploration expenditures of US$5 million to earn a 
100% interest in all projects under the NAN-Blackstone option agreement including the 
Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror projects, subject to issuance of the last 1 million units on or 
before December 31, 2009.

The properties are accessible year round but are subject to winter conditions. The 
topography in the vicinity of all of the projects is generally flat with small lakes, ponds, creeks 
and swamps among higher forested areas. The vegetation in the area consists of various species 
of spruce, birch and pine. The climate is typical of northern temperate to boreal forest regions. 

 Good transportation, industrial infrastructure, electrical power and shipping facilities are 
all available and there are a number of active mines in the area.  

Mining occurred on the Lainejaur deposit from 1941-1945 with total production of 
100,526 tonnes of ore with a content of 2.20% Ni, 0.93% Cu, and 0.1% Co (Grip, 1961).  
Numerous other old nickel prospects also occur on or near the property. Recent work on the

Lainejaur property includes geophysical surveys in 2002 and the drilling of 43 holes in 2007 and 
2008.

Nickel prospecting initiated by the Swedish State Mining Property Commission (NSG) 
resulted in the discovery of a number of boulders with nickel mineralisation on the Lappvattnet 
property in early 1970s. Subsequent percussion and diamond drilling programs led to the 
development of an exploration shaft and drifting on the 120m level of the deposit in the period 
1978â€“1982. A historical resource of 1.0 million tonnes @ 1.0% nickel, 0.21% copper and 0.02% 
Co using a 0.4% Ni cutoff was outlined at the time (Akerman, 1987). From 1990-2004, 
Outokumpu Mining completed a number of geophysical surveys and did 11,111 metres of 
diamond drilling as part of a joint venture formed between Outokumpu and NSG. Recent work 
on the Lappvattnet property (from 2003) includes ground, borehole and airborne geophysical 
surveys, three diamond drill holes by NAN in 2004 and, in 2007-2008 Blackstone completed 28 
diamond drill holes totalling 5,016 metres. 

Ror was discovered by the NSG in 1974 through regional boulder prospecting. A 
diamond drilling program from 1979-82 comprised 107 drill holes totalling 23,910 metres and 
outlined a historic resource of 4.24 million tons grading 0.61% Ni in 13 zones (Zones A to M) 
(Akerman, 1987). Recent work on Ror (2007-2008) by Blackstone includes geophysical surveys, 
diamond drilling of eight holes totalling 1,537 metres, and limited re-sampling of historic drill 
core. Outokumpu completed metallurgical test work on material from Ror that indicated 
recoveries of up to 85% Ni. 

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror deposits are all magmatic nickel sulphide 
accumulations with tectonic, structural, and geological similarities to documented Ni-Cu mines.  

The Lainejaur property is hosted by a lopolithic gabbro-diorite intrusion. Sulphides consist 
of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. The sulphide body plunges shallowly northward and 
varies in width and thickness on a metre to tens of metre scale. Good continuity has been 
demonstrated in areas of past mining and the continuity of the Mineral Resources presented in this 
report appears to be very good.

The Lappvattnet deposit occurs in an ultramafic intrusion that is itself within gneissic to 
migmatitic metagreywackes and biotite-graphite gneiss. The nickel-copper sulphides are confined 
mainly to the ultramafic bodies, but extensive remobilization has occurred at Lappvattnet where, in 
some cases, sulphides are hosted by surrounding paragneisses as fragmental and breccia zones. 
Sulphides consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. The sulphide body dips steeply the 
south and plunges shallowly eastward. The continuity of the Mineral Resources presented in this 
report appears to be very good. 

Nickel sulphides at Ror are hosted by the largest of the ultramafic intrusions in the 
district, measuring 1.7 kilometres long and over 300 metres wide with undefined depth limits. 
The Ror intrusion includes both metaperidotites and metapyroxenites, which are hosted by 
gneissic to migmatitic metagreywackes and biotite-graphite gneiss. Sulphides at Ror consist of 
pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite and are confined to the ultramafic body. Mineralization 
consists of both massive sulphide and disseminated zones. Numerous sulphide zones are based on 
sampling of higher concentrations of sulphides. Intervals of ultramafic rock between these better

mineralised zones are often unsampled. The continuity of the Ni mineralisation at low grade cut-offs 
appears to be very good. 

All geological samples have been collected and handled in a professional manner by 
BLV. The practice in most cases has been to sample visibly mineralised intervals of diamond 
drill holes and adjacent intervals; sample intervals are geologically constrained and are generally 
determined on the basis of sulphide content or lithologic contacts. Sampling of historic holes has 
been less thorough at Ror with significant intervals of less well mineralised, unsampled 
ultramafic rock (~45% of the cored length of the ultramafic rocks). Samples generally vary in 
length from < 0.10 m to 7.0 m, although lengths of 0.3 to 1.0m are most common, depending on 
the deposit. Several laboratories have been used over the life of the projects; all have been 
commercially independent laboratories. Blackstone has used the services of only one laboratory, 
ALS Chemex. 

No recent metallurgical test work has been done although the Lainejaur deposit was 
previously mined and clearly had recoverable Ni, Cu and Co during past production. Outokumpu 
completed metallurgical test work on material from Ror in the 1990s that indicated recoveries of 
up to 85% Ni. 

 At the Lainejaur deposit, at a US$100 equivalent cutoff, RCI estimated Inferred Mineral 
Resources of 645,000 tonnes @ 1.33% Ni, 0.66% Cu and 0.09% Co.

At Lappvattnet, at a US$100 equivalent cutoff, Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated 
by RCI at 1,139,000 tonnes @ 0.91% Ni, 0.19% Cu and 0.02% Co. 

At a US$40 equivalent cutoff, the Ror deposit contains Inferred Mineral Resources 
estimated by RCI at 6,370,000 tonnes @ 0.35% Ni, 0.04% Cu and 0.01% Co.

metal values (GMV) of US$100 and minimum core lengths of 2.0m for intervals that contributed 
to the polygons. The average composite length is 4.4m and core lengths are thought to represent 
~90% of true widths. The resources fall in a zone that has multiple drillholes on sections over a 
200m width with a down-plunge length of 550m. Cutoff values are based on the assumption that 
the deposit is of a potential size and nature to allow for possible underground mining.  

At the Lappvattnet deposit RCI estimated the mineral resource using polygonal 
estimation methods on vertical cross-sections on 40m centres. The estimates incorporated 
minimum gross metal values (GMV) of US$100 and minimum core lengths of 3.0m for intervals 
that contributed to the polygons. The average composite length is 7.0m and core lengths are 
thought to represent ~80% of true widths. The resources fall in a zone that has multiple drillholes 
on most sections over a strike length of 760m. Cutoff values are based on the assumption that the 
deposit is of a potential size and nature to allow for possible underground mining. 

 The mineral resources at the Ror deposit were estimated by RCI using by 3D computer 
block modelling and an Ordinary Kriging (OK) grade interpolation method. Wireframes defining 
the potentially economic mineralisation, based on host rocks and sulphide content, were 
constructed in order to constrain the resource estimate. Drillhole assays inside the wireframes 
were captured, and assay composites of approximately 2.5 metre lengths were generated to 
regularize sample support. The estimate incorporated blocks containing minimum gross metal 
values (GMV) of US$40 based on the assumption that the deposit is of a potential size and 
nature to allow for possible bulk mining methods, specifically open pit mining. The maximum 
depth for the reported Mineral Resource estimates is 260 m below surface although the drilling, 
mineralisation and block model continue below that. 

Significant mineralisation exists on all three properties. Infill drilling and/or check 
sampling of archived core using industry standard Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA\QC) 
protocols are needed to improve the confidence in continuity or in assay results for Lainejaur and 
Lappvattnet. Infill drilling for grade determinations, additional drilling to better define the 
constraining wireframes and additional sampling of previously unsampled intervals of core from 
ultramafic rocks at Ror are all needed to further advance this property. Exploration on other 
prospects on the properties is warranted regardless of the results of further definition of the 
Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror deposits. 

Based on the results of exploration on the properties to date, including previous 
underground Ni-Cu-Co production at Lainejaur, an underground exploration program at 
Lappvattnet and the results of recent drilling, Blackstone's Sweden properties are of sufficient 
merit to warrant further work directed towards improved resource definition. RCI recommends 
the following work program. 

Lainejaur:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data; 

undertake 5,000m of infill drilling on closer centres to better define the geometry of the 
mineralised zones in order to upgrade the confidence in Mineral Resources.

Lappvattnet:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data; 

re-sample all archived core intervals from previous operators that contribute or are 
adjacent to, or on strike or up or down dip of intervals that contribute to the Mineral 
Resources;

undertake 5,000m of infill drilling on closer centres to better define the geometry of the 
mineralised zones in order to upgrade the confidence in Mineral Resources. 

Ror:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data;

4.1  Mineral Tenure 

The mineral tenure system relating to exploration and mining in Sweden are well 
explained on the website of the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (www.bergsstaten.se). This 
includes the Guide to Mineral Legislation and Regulations in Sweden (SGU, 2006). Information 
in this section is largely from compilations of Swedish exploration and mining regulation by 
Setterfield (2008).

Exploration proceeds on exploration permits, which can be of any size or geometry. 
Permits are obtained by map staking, specifically by applying to the Mining Inspectorate and 
nominating vertices of a desired polygon. Exploration permits can surround previously existing

Sweden Ni-Cu Properties Resource Estimates June 2009                                                                 13 

permits. The Mining Inspectorate examines the application and consults with any private land 
owners within the requested permit area; owners can comment on the application, but can not 
deny the permit or access to the ground. Exploration permits give the owner the right to explore 
within the permit area, except for certain designated areas (national parks, certain areas of the 
Swedish mountains, and within specified distances of various types of infrastructure). Permits 
generally take two to six months to obtain, and are granted for an initial three year period. If 
"suitable exploration" has been carried out during the first three years, the permit may be 
extended for up to an additional three years (SGU, 2006). After six years, there is provision to 
extend the permit by up to four more years in "exceptional" cases and a further five years 
(totaling fifteen) in "extreme" cases. Annual fees for the exploration permits are 4, 6 and 10 SEK 
per hectare in years 1 to 3 respectively, 21 SEK (approximately CAN $3.15) per hectare for 
years 3 to 6, 50 SEK per hectare for years 7 to 10, and 100 SEK per hectare for years 11 to 15 
(rarely granted).

Before significant exploration work can begin, the permit holder has to obtain a work 
permit from the relevant county. A work plan must be submitted to the county; this plan is then 
presented to all stakeholders for comment. The Mining Inspector has the final say in any dispute 
between the stakeholders and the permit holder. If a discovery is made, the permit holder may 
apply for an exploitation concession, which will allow for the development of the deposit. Such a 
concession is granted for 25 years and is automatically extended in 10 year periods if 
exploitation of the deposit is in progress.  

A summary of the Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror permits is provided in Table 4-1.

4.2  North Atlantic Natural Resources â€“ Blackstone Agreement 

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror projects are part of the North Atlantic Natural 
Resources AB - Blackstone Option Agreement dated October 31, 2006. 

Under the terms of the option agreement between North Atlantic Natural Resources AB 
(NAN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lundin Mining) and Blackstone, whereby Blackstone can 
earn a 100% interest in certain exploration permits in return for the issuance to NAN of 3 million 
units in its capital stock by December 2009. Each unit shall consist of a common share and a one 
year 2/3 common share purchase warrant with each full warrant having an exercise price equal to 
the higher of $0.59 and the average of the daily closing trading price for the Shares on the

Exchange. Blackstone will be required to spend US$5 million in exploration work, including a 
minimum 18,000 metres of diamond drilling, on the properties by December 2009. If Blackstone 
initiates a Bankable Feasibility Study on any nickel deposit, NAN will be entitled to acquire a 
49% interest in the property, subject to a 45 day review period, by paying to Blackstone, in cash, 
an amount equal to 300% of Blackstone's total project expenditures. NAN retains rights to 
certain non-nickel deposits found on the properties. Blackstone holds its Swedish properties in a 
wholly owned subsidiary, Blackstone Nickel AB. 

Agreement Status 

Blackstone has exceeded required exploration expenditures of US$5 million to earn 
100% interest in all projects under the NAN-Blackstone option agreement including the 
Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror projects subject to issuance of the last 1 million units on or 
before December 31, 2009.

4.3  Other Mineralisation, Environmental Matters and Permits 

Other Mineralised Zones 

There are other mineralised zones on Lappvattnet nr 100 and Rormyrberget nr 100 
permits but to the best of RCI's knowledge they do not have significant resources attributable to 
them, either compliant or non-compliant with NI 43-101/CIM standards.  Their significance is 
primarily as possible exploration targets. 

Environmental Matters 

Although there are locally remnants of old mine workings on both the Lainejaur nr 100 
and Lappvattnet nr 100 permits, it is RCI's understanding, that under the Swedish Mining Act, 
neither NAN nor Blackstone is liable for any costs, rehabilitation or clean-up for prior mining or 
processing activities. RCI has relied on reports and opinions from Blackstone for the information 
relating to environmental matters. 

Government Royalties and Permits 

There are no royalties due other than royalties or taxes on possible future mineral 
production due to the Swedish Government.  

Official government permits are required to conduct exploration and the holder of 
exploration permit has the right to pursue exploration activities.  If any damages caused by the 
exploration fair compensation is to be made to the land holder.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1  Accessibility 

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror projects are accessible year round via paved roads 
from Skelleftea. Roads are maintained by each municipality.   

The Lainejaur property is easily accessible all year around. Lainejaur is located 15 km 
from Mala and 141.5 km from Skelleftea, via highway 370 from Skelleftea to Mala then 16.5 km 
north on highway 1014. The last 1.5 km is an all-weather gravel road and allows access to the 
southern portion of the property. 

Both Lappvattnet and Ror projects are situated south-southwest of Skelleftea. 
Lappvattnet is located just 10 min by road from BlackstoneÂ´s field office in Vallen, 30 km from 
Skelleftea. All-weather gravel roads provide access to the entire property.  Ror is located 110 km 
from Skelleftea along a paved network of roads except for last 6-7 km, where there is an all-
weather gravel road access to the property. During the summer the swampy areas of the property 
are accessible by foot and during winter by snowmobile. Surface rights on both projects are held 
by numerous private landowners. 

5.2  Climate 

Sweden enjoys a mostly temperate climate despite its northern latitude, mainly because 
of the Gulf Stream. Northern Sweden has a long winter of more than seven months. Annual 
rainfall averages 61 cm (24 in) and the maximum rainfall occurs in late summer. In Sweden's 
north, snow remains on the ground for about half of the year. Vegetation is typical of mixed 
northern to boreal forest. 

The continental climate dominates the Lainejaur area and the total rainfall is 553 mm per 
year, cold winters with an average seasonal temperature of -12.6Â°C (-7Â°C to -20Â°C) and warm 
summers with an average seasonal temperature of 11.7Â°C (10Â°C to 20Â°C). For Ror and In 
Lappvattnet a littoral climate is dominate with a total rainfall of 528 mm per year, cold winters 
with an average seasonal temperature of -10.1Â°C (-4Â°C to -17Â°C) and warm summers with an 
average seasonal temperature of 14.4 Â°C (12Â°C to 22Â°C). Climatic data can be found at:
www.smhi.se (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). 

Seasonal variations affect exploration to some extent (geological mapping cannot be done 
in the winter, geophysics and drilling are best done at certain times of the year etc.), but the 
climate does not significantly hinder exploration activity or mining operations.

5.3  Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Sweden is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). While there has been a history of 
nickel mining in Sweden, most of this ended in the mid 1940s. A nickel refinery is located in 
Kristiansand, Norway (~325 km from Oslo) and is operated by Xstrata Nickel. The refinery was

originally built in 1910 to refine nickel matte from Norwegian nickel mines. Mining related 
services were largely brought in by Blackstone from Sweden. The good transportation and 
industrial infrastructure and good shipping facilities are favourable factors. 

Sweden has a long history of mining, dating back for at least a thousand years, with 
several modern mining operations active today. The Lainejaur, Ror and Lappvattnet projects 
occur with mining friendly districts with active mines and a milling facility at Boliden, which is 
central to the three projects. Blackstone set up a small administrative office at Skelleftea and a 
field house and core logging and cutting facility in nearby Vallen. Skelleftea is a small city with 
several flights to and from Stockholm each day. The city also has a well-established industrial 
port (Skelleftehamn and Kage) and railway infrastructure. Boliden Mines is the third biggest 
employer and the largest industry in Skelleftea. The good transportation and industrial 
infrastructure and good shipping facilities are favourable factors. 

5.4  Physiography 

The Lainejaur property is a flat with only minor gently rolling topography with no 
distinct topographic features. In the northeast part of the permit there is a small lake, StortjÃ¤rn. 
The vegetation in the area consists of various species of spruce, birch and pine. Swampier areas 
contain grass and willows. 

Similar flat topography occurs at the Ror and Lappvattnet projects.  Both projects include 
areas with small lakes, ponds and several small creeks. The vegetation in the area consists of 
various species of spruce, birch and pine. Swampier areas contain grass and willows.

6  HISTORY 

Nickel exploration dates back prior to the 1940s which led to the development of the 
Lainejaur Ni deposit in the western part of the Skellefte district. During 1941-1945 Lainejaur 
produced 100,526 tonnes of ore averaging 2.20% Ni, 0.93% Cu and 0.1% Co (Grip, 1961). Apart 
from Lainejaur, no other important nickel zones were discovered within the Skellefte district at 
that time. 

In the early 1970s the Swedish State Mining Property Commission (NSG) began 
exploration for nickel in the Burtrask area based on the discovery of nickel deposits in similar 
environments in neighbouring Finland. Boulder prospecting combined with new aeromagnetic 
data soon led to the discovery of the Vasterbotten Nickel district, host to the Lappvattnet and Ror 
deposits (Akerman, 1987).   

Most of the information provided on historical work is from data provided by BLV and 
has not been independently verified by RCI.

6.1  Lainejaur 

Early Historical Mining 

The Lainejaur deposit was discovered in 1941. Since nickel was an important metal and 
was in short supply at the time, the mine was quickly opened and stood for a large part of the 
nickel needed in Sweden during the Second World War. At the end of the war the mining 
operation was stopped. At its closing in 1945, the Lainejaur mine had two shafts extending to a 
depth of 213m. Additional ore occurrences were reported at depth. The total production was 
100,526 tonnes of ore with a content of 2.20% Ni, 0.93% Cu, and 0.1% Co (Grip, 1961). 

In 2002 North Atlantic Natural Resources (NAN) completed ground magnetic and 
electromagnetic surveys and two diamond drill holes tested the extension of an electromagnetic 
anomaly parallel to the one hosting the Lainejaur ore. Both holes intersected a similar geological 
environment containing locally up to 0.1% Ni.

Drilling

Diamond drilling constituted the bulk of the work at Lainejaur. Drilling commenced in 
January 2007 and was completed in April 2008. At total 43 drill holes were completed (LAI-07-
003 to LAI-08-041) totalling 12,733 metres.

Blackstone's drill campaign was successful in extending the nickel sulphide deposit more 
than 700 metres down-plunge of the historic workings to the northern limit of Lainejaur permit. 
The sulphide body varies from <0.5 metres to nearly 10 metres in vertical thickness with 
horizontal widths locally attaining close to 100 metres. Among the best intersections are 9.9 
metres grading 2.37% Ni, 0.62% Cu and 0.19% Co (LAI-07-015). The deposit additionally 
contains significant gold, platinum and palladium. Only Ni, Cu and Co values are reported in the 
Mineral Resource estimates in this report 

Geophysics 

Borehole EM surveys were completed by Lundin Mining and Crone Geophysics at 
Lainejaur. Lundin employed a 3 component Protem system and 25Hz frequency, whereas Crone 
Geophysics used a time domain electromagnetic (TEM) system.  Interpretations were provided 
by Lundin Mining, Geovista, and a Blackstone geophysicist.  Surveys were completed on a total 
of 21 drill holes with complete interpretations of data for 12 drill holes completed in 2007 and a 
final interpretation report for 9 drill holes surveyed in 2008 pending. Interpretations by Lundin's 
geophysicist Ana Brana-Bergshjorth and subsequently by Geovista outlined several untested 
conductive anomalies (plates) whereas surveys completed in 2008, indicated no large off-hole 
features but overall off-hole responses were better than in-hole. 

Surface TEM surveys were completed by Crone Geophysics utilizing the transmitting 
loops already in place for the BHEM work. Three lines separated by 200 metres, were completed 
to test the down plunge extension of the massive sulphide. Preliminary interpretation indicated 
that main conductor has a plunge to the north and is dipping to the west.

Early Historical Work 

Nickel prospecting in the south Skellefte field started in early 1970s, when Swedish State 
Mining Property Commission (NSG) initiated a prospecting program which resulted in a number 
of nickel mineralized ultramafic boulder in the BurtrÃ¤sk area. The discoveries were 
systematically followed up by detailed boulder tracing, in which specially trained "sulphide 
dogs" played an important role. Boulder tracing was followed up by geophysical measurements, 
percussion drilling and diamond drilling. Several nickel-copper prospects were outlined in the

area, of which Lappvattnet was considered the most promising. Other prospects include 
BrÃ¤nnorna, LappbÃ¤cken, MjÃ¶vattnet and Holmsvattnet. 

In 1974-1976, a systematic overburden/bedrock surface sampling program was carried 
out by NSG. A percussion drill rig was used to take samples in profiles in the Lappvattnet-
Holmsvattnet area. Approximately 4,000 samples were taken. Most of the results are available 
and indicate geochemical anomalies that still remain untested. 

In the period 1978â€“1982, the Lappvattnet deposit a shaft was sunk and a drift developed 
on the 120m level. A historical resource of 1.0 million tonnes @ 1.0% nickel, 0.21% copper and 
0.02% Co using a 0.4% Ni cutoff was outlined at the time (Akerman, 1987).  No data to support 
this estimate or relating to the underground program were located or examined by RCI. 

Recent Work 

A geophysical grid was set up in June 2003. The grid was extended in several steps and 
currently extends four kilometres southwest of Lappvattnet prospect to ~2 kilometres east of 
MjÃ¶vattnet. The total length of the baseline is about nine kilometres. The whole grid (9 X 2.5 
km, 100 m spacing between lines) has been covered by magnetic and TEM surveys. 

NAN conducted a drilling campaign in September 2004 where three diamond drill holes 
were sunk within the Lappvattnet mineralization. The aim of this program was verifying the 
continuity of the mineralization at its margin.  The drill holes intersected the mineralized horizon 
at the planned depth, and yielded expected grades and width (the best intersection was 0.85 % Ni 
over 2.45 m). 

In 2007-2008, Blackstone completed 28 diamond drill holes totalling (5,016 metres) in 
the immediate Lappvattnet deposit area. Surface and bore hole TEM surveys were completed at 
the Lappvattnet deposit. The surface TEM was completed on lines separated by 100 metres over 
Lappvattnet and six bore holes were surveyed. The area was also covered by Blackstone's 
regional Aeroquest AeroTEM II EM and mag survey.

The deposit at Ror was discovered by the Swedish State Mining Property Commission 
(NSG) in 1974 through regional boulder hunting. Three other prospects in the area were also 
discovered at this time. An intensive diamond drilling program at in 1979-82 comprising 107

drill holes totalling 23,910 metres outlined a resource of 4.24 million tons grading 0.61% Ni in 
13 zones (Zones A to M) (Akerman, 1987).  

Outokumpu Mining subsequently completed geophysical measurements at Ror including 
mag, EM and gravity, and in 1990-92 Outokumpu formed a joint venture with NSG and 
completed 11,111m of diamond drilling at Ror on surface-near mineralization. An indicated 
resource estimate (historical and non NI 43-101 compliant) of 0.7M tonnes @ 0.76% Ni was 
estimated for the west end of the deposit (Ros, F., 2003). In 1990 Outokumpu completed 
metallurgical test work indicating recovery of up to 85% Ni by bench scale testing (Palosaari, 
1990). A conceptual mining study was done on a potentially open pit resource at the M-location 
followed by underground mining mainly at the D-zone (Ros, F., 2003). The Ror permits were 
dropped by Outokumpu in 2004, and shortly thereafter the area was staked by NAN.. 

Recent Work 

In 2007-2008, Blackstone completed an airborne Aeroquest AeroTEM II EM and mag 
survey (as part of the regional survey), diamond drilled ten holes totalling 1,838.6 metres, and 
did some re-sampling of historic drill core.

7  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1  Regional Geological Setting

Regional Tectonic Setting of Sweden 

The following regional description is based on a description of the 'Geology of 
Fennoscandia' from the Laboratory for Isotope Geology at the Swedish Museum of Natural 
History, Stockholm, Sweden.

 In regional geological terms, Sweden forms part of the Fennoscandian (or Baltic) 

Shield, which also includes Norway, Finland and the northwestern part of Russia. 

The oldest rocks of the Fennoscandian Shield are found in the northeast, in the Kola 

peninsula, Karelia and northeastern Finland. These are Archean rocks, mainly 

gneisses and greenstone belts, c. 2500-3100 Ma (million years) old. Within this area, 

there are also some Paleoproterozoic cover rocks (Karelian rocks), c. 1900-2500 Ma 

old, and the c. 1900 Ma old collisional Lapland granulite belt (not shown on the 

map). Some Archean rocks are also found in northernmost Sweden (Norrbotten 

county), and Archean crust probably underlies much of that area. 

Svecofennian Province

The Svecofennian rocks were formed in connection to the Svecokarelian Orogeny c. 

1,800 â€“ 1,900 Ma. Most of northern and central Sweden, however, belongs to the 

Svecofennian province, together with the southwestern part of Finland. Here, the 

bedrock formed 1750-1900 Ma ago, during the Svecofennian (also known as 

Svecokarelian) orogeny. This bedrock includes both metasedimentary and 

metavolcanic rocks and several generations of granitoids, and hosts important ore 

deposits of the Bergslagen (iron and sulfide ores), Skellefte (sulfides) and Norrbotten 

(iron and sulfide ores) districts.  

The Lainejaur, Lappvattnet, and Ror properties are in situated within mafic and 
ultramafic intrusions in the central part of the Svecofennian province. The Lainejaur deposit 
occurs in the Skelleftea ore district, whereas Lappvattnet and Ror are located to the south within 
the Bothnian Supergroup. A summary of the relative age of the lithological sequences is included 
in Table 7-1

7.2  Property Geology  

Lainejaur Project 

The Lainejaur deposit is situated in the western part of Skellefte district. Geological 
interpretations are based on diamond drill core, limited underground mapping records and 
geophysics as there is no outcrop of bedrock on the property.

The nickel-copper sulphide deposit is hosted at the base of a lopolithic gabbro-diorite 
intrusion.  The intrusion cuts 1.88 to 1.86 Ga sedimentary rocks of the Vargfors Group (Figure 7-
2). The Lainejaur intrusion grades upwards from gabbro to diorite to granodiorite. The gabbro 
portions (which host nickel-copper sulphides) consist of fine-grained olivine gabbro, forming the 
cumulative host rocks and a probable younger magma pulse of coarse-grained sulphide-bearing 
gabbro.

According to Grip (1961) three principal ore types occur at Lainejaur.  The first type is 
massive sulphide ore near the basal portions of the intrusion. The second type is the disseminated

sulphides grading upward into the gabbro host from the massive sulphides. A third, less common 
type is represented by nickel-copper-arsenic veins.

Sulphides consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. The sulphide body plunges 
shallowly northward and varies from <0.5m to nearly 10m in vertical thickness with horizontal 
widths locally attaining close to 100m.

Sweden RT90-2.5 Coordinate System

Lappvattnet Project 

The Lappvattnet nickel deposit occurs in an area south of the Skellefte district known as 
the Vasterbotten nickel trend. Nickel sulphides are hosted by an ultramafic intrusion including 
both metaperidotites and metapyroxenites. The metaperidotite commonly displays a

characteristic "jackstraw" texture. The ultramafic intrusion occurs within gneissic to migmatitic 
metagreywackes and biotite-graphite gneiss of the Bothnian Supergroup (c. 1.96-1.86 Ga). 

The nickel-copper sulphides are confined mainly to the ultramafic bodies, but extensive 
remobilization has occurred at Lappvattnet where in cases sulphides are hosted by surrounding 
paragneisses as fragmental and breccia zones. Sulphides consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and 
chalcopyrite. The sulphide body dips steeply the south and plunges shallowly eastward. 

Geological interpretations are based on diamond drill core, limited underground mapping 
records and geophysics as there is no outcrop of bedrock on the property.

Ror Project

The Ror nickel deposit occurs at the southwest end of the Vasterbotten nickel trend. 
Nickel sulphides at Ror are hosted by the largest of the ultramafic intrusions in the district, 
measuring 1.7 kilometres long and over 300 metres wide with undefined depth limits. The Ror 
intrusion includes both metaperidotites and metapyroxenites as at Lappvattnet which intrude 
gneissic to migmatitic metagreywackes and biotite-graphite gneiss of the Bothnian Supergroup 
(c. 1.96-1.86 Ga).

Sulphides at Ror consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite and are confined to 
the ultramafic body. Mineralization consists of both massive sulphide and disseminated zones. 
As many as eleven, sub-parallel, steeply south-dipping zones sulphides have been defined 
historically comprising the Ror deposit. The numerous sulphide zones are partially based on 
selective sampling of visually higher sulphide concentrations. 

As at Lainejaur and Lappvattnet, outcrop in the area is nil to rare and geologic maps are 
based on drilling and geophysics.

8  DEPOSIT TYPES 

Economic concentrations of nickel are associated with magmatic sulphide accumulations 
and weathered products of mafic-ultramafic rocks as lateritic nickel ores. The Lainejaur, 
Lappvattnet and Ror nickel sulphide deposits are all magmatic sulphide accumulations with 
tectonic, structural, and geological similarities to documented, large Ni-Cu deposits. Nickel and 
copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with 
differentiated mafic sills and stocks and ultramafic volcanic (komatiitic) volcanic flows and sills. 
As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's 
past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain 
large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant 
source of nickel. 

Economic sulphide nickel deposits span a broad age range from the Achaean to 
Phanerozoic (2.7 Ga to 0.25 Ga). The largest discovered deposits to date are the Norilsk and 
Sudbury ore concentrations. Current popular theory for the formation of nickel sulphide deposits 
invokes partial melting of the upper mantle, magma fractionation, magma mixing, and 
contamination by country rock to form a separate sulphide melt from a mafic magma.  

Established nickel sulphide deposits show similarities in geological setting while 
maintaining individual distinct and unique characteristics. The main common components 
include nickel-copper association, proximity to a major structure(s), mafic-ultramafic association 
and host rock, and the presence of a possible breccia feeder system.   

Comparison of the regional geological setting and nickel sulphide mineralisation 
occurrence between the Vasterbotten district in Sweden and the Thompson Nickel Belt in 
Manitoba, Canada indicates analogies which have not previously been investigated by 
exploration in Sweden. The Lainejaur deposit shares similarities to the Montcalm nickel mine in 
the Abitibi province near Timmins, Ontario. Details of some of the similarities are highlighted 
below.

Sweden Nickel (Lappvattnet-Ror) â€“ Thompson Nickel Belt Analogue 

The Thompson Nickel Belt is the second largest nickel camp in Canada after Sudbury 
Basin (Peredery, W.V., 1982). The belt hosts several nickel deposits, most notably the 
Thompson deposit with past production plus current reserves estimated at more than 100 Mt at 
around 2.5% Ni. Deposit types include strongly deformed massive sulphides and larger lower 
grade disseminated to semi-massive sulphide deposits. The deposits are hosted by deformed 
Proterozoic-age ultramafic rocks within metasedimentary and metavolcanic sequences that are 
also complexly deformed. The style of mineralization, age, geological and tectonic setting shares 
similarities to the Lappvattnet and Ror deposits and their host, the Bothian Supergroup.

Sweden Nickel (Lainejaur) â€“ Montcalm Deposit Analogue 

The Lainejaur deposit shares many similarities to the Montcalm nickel-copper deposit in 
Abitibi belt in Ontario despite host rock age (Archean versus Proterozoic). Both deposits are 
gabbro-hosted in "greenstone" belts hosting other deposits including volcanogenic massive

sulphides and gold. Metal ratios of nickel to copper are also both the same at about 2:1 (nickel to 
copper). The Montcalm deposit contains a Proven Mineral Reserve of 4.1 million tonnes @ 
1.38% Ni, 0.64% Cu as of December 31, 2006 (source XStrata Nickel).

9  MINERALISATION 

The nickel-copper mineralised zones are found in a wide variety of host rocks including 
gabbro, norite, pyroxenite and peridotite. At Lainejaur and Lappvattnet most of the 
mineralisation with economic potential (pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite Â± pyrite) is 
found as massive, semi-massive, net-textured and disseminated sulphide zones (Figure 9-1). 
Some mineralization has been remobilized into gneiss at Lappvattnet. Nickel sulphide 
mineralisation in the Sweden project areas is exposed in old mine workings (Lainejaur and 
Lappvattnet) over distances ranging from a few tens of metres to in excess of 300 metres.  

Figure 9-1 Mineralised Intersection from the Lappvattnet Deposit.  

LAP07-002:  3.21%Ni, 0.06%Cu, 0.08% Co over 4.97m (76.43-81.40m) 

The mineralisation in the Ror deposit occurs in a suite of ultramafic rocks and in a more 
disseminated manner than the other deposits. It may be that Ni mineralisation in Ror is similar to 
large low-grade Ni deposits such as Mt. Keith in Australia, which is classified as a type IIb Ni 
deposit in the classification of Lesher and Keays, 2002. At Mt. Keith Fe-Ni-(Cu) sulphides occur 
interstitial to former olivine grains with an average abundance of 3 to 5 volume percent, and the 
deposit has a current resource of 503 Mt at 0.55% Ni (Rosengren, Beresford, Grguric and Cas, 
2005).

10 EXPLORATION 

Between 2006 and April 2008, Blackstone had completed 43 diamond drill holes totalling 
12,733 metres on the Lainejaur deposit, and completed bore-hole EM geophysical surveys on 21 
of these drill holes. All of the drilling on the property has been under the supervision of 
Blackstone since 2006.

Between 2006 and December 2008, Blackstone completed 3,587 line kilometers of 
airborne magnetics and EM in the Vasterbotten district (including Lappvattnet and Ror deposits), 
5 line kilometers of surface EM geophysics and bore hole EM on 6 drill holes at Lappvattnet. 
Twenty-eight drill holes (5,016 metres) targeted the Lappvattnet deposit and 10 drill holes (1,839 
metres) targeted the Ror deposit. All of the drilling on the properties since 2006 has been under 
the supervision of Blackstone.

A summary of the exploration work done by Blackstone in the area of the Lainejaur, 
Lappvattnet and Ror resources, as presented in this report, including geophysics and drilling, has 
been described in Section 6,  History. In addition to the work described in Section 6, Blackstone 
has also carried out additional exploration on other parts of the Lappvattnet-Ror area 
(Vasterbotten district). This work has included: 

Reconnaissance prospecting over  ~10km

;

100 drill holes totalling 16,188 metres testing regional targets in the Vasterbotten 
district;

Differential GPS surveys of historic drill collars (~200 drill collars)

variety of rig types including both track mounted and skid mounted wireline drill rigs. Details for 
historical drilling are not available. 

Core diameters include a variety ranging from 35.2 mm to 42 mm, which is close to 
standard BQ (35.5 mm) and BQTW (47.6 mm).    

Drill core at all drill sites is placed in wooden boxes, the boxes labelled according to drill 
hole number and metres and safely closed for transport. Most historical drilling is stored in SGU 
warehouses.

11.3  Surveying

Collar Locations and Orientations

Collar locations for all BLV drill holes were established using a total station differential 
hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) with an accuracy of less than one meter. Collar 
locations were picked up immediately after completion of the drill hole. Drill casing was left in 
the ground for most holes.  Holes from previous operators were surveyed using either high 
accuracy GPS or handheld GPS units. 

Down Hole Surveys 

A Reflex survey instrument or Maxibor were utilized for surveying of BLV drill holes. 
Surveys were taken typically at 50 metres (or more detailed) increments down the hole. In the 
cases where there are no surveys, these holes were blocked at the time the surveys were being 
completed. Corrections were to local magnetic declinations at each project site. A variety of 
survey readings were available for old holes. Some historic holes had no survey data at all for 
azimuths or dips and those were not used for estimates. 

Topography

Although topographic data is available, the GPS data recorded in the field was used for 
drill collar locations.  

11.4  Core Logging Procedures 

Data reviewed in this study and applied for geological modelling and resource estimation 
are the product of recent exploration by Blackstone and historic drill cores. Blackstone's core 
logging procedures are as follows: 

Core is brought to field house or logging facility on a daily basis by truck by 
employees of the drilling company or the company geologist on site.  

All core is logged at the core shack on the project site, where major lithological 
units, structure, alteration, and mineralogy is recorded using text, numeric codes, 
or percentages and entered into DHLogger daily.

Prior to being sampled, significant mineralized core sections are photographed 
using a digital camera and the photos are downloaded to the main office 
computer. 

The final logs include a header sheet with collar coordinates and down hole 
survey data. Produced from DHLogger in Sudbury. 

Assay results for samples and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) materials are 
entered into DHLogger when received. All assay and QA/QC results are received electronically. 
Protocols for logging of holes drilled before BLV was operator are not available.

12  SAMPLING APPROACH and METHODOLOGY  

12.1  Diamond Drill Sampling 

The following description applies only to BLV drilling as procedures from prior drilling 
are not available. Most core from previous operators was split rather than sawn and archived core 
is stored in SGU warehouses in clearly marked wooden boxes. Core from all drill holes was 
logged on site and all BQ core was marked for sampling by the geologist. Sample lengths are 
based on lithologic units and generally range from 0.30m to 1.5m. Standards or blanks are 
inserted for every 20 samples and a blank is inserted at the end of mineralised zones. 

Technicians saw the core in half longitudinally using core saws with a diamond blade at 
Blackstone's core cutting facility in Vallen, Sweden. One half of the core is bagged for analysis 
and the bag secured with a zip tie; the other half is returned to the core box and kept as a 
permanent record with the sample tag stapled to the box at the end of the interval. Boxes are 
tagged with aluminum tags showing the hole number and box interval. 

Cut and bagged samples are placed in sealed transport boxes and secured typically until 
several boxes are ready for shipping. Sealed boxes are shipped from Vallen to ALS Chemex in 
Pitea, Sweden by road. Samples are prepared (crushed and pulverized) at Pitea then pulps are 
shipped by air transport to ALS Chemex Vancouver, B.C. for analyses.  

Short term core storage was made available at a local facility in Vallen during the active 
drilling program. For long term storage, drill core is stored pallets, located at the Swedish 
Geological Service (SGU) in Mala, Sweden. Pulps and rejects are returned to Blackstone and 
stored at its core facility in Vallen.   

As almost all core recovery is very good, there appear to be no sampling or recovery 
factors that could materially impact the accuracy or reliability of the sampling results.  

Assay intervals are stated as core lengths; the true thickness of the mineralized intervals 
have not been determined as of yet. The mineralized zones in Lainejaur are shallow dipping and 
are generally intercepted by fairly steep drillholes. It appears that the true width of this 
mineralized zone is on average 90% of the core lengths (Figures 17-7 and 17-8).

The mineralized zones at Lappvattnet and Ror are interpreted to be mostly moderately to 
steeply dipping and it appears that the true width of the mineralized zone is on average about 
80% of core lengths (Figures 17-14, 17-15 and 17-19).

12.2  Diamond Drill Results 

Diamond drill results that contribute to the resources quoted in this report for the 
Lainejaur and Lappvattnet properties are listed in Appendix I. As the Ror deposit has been 
estimated using all reported assays for drilling in the wireframe constraining that resource, those 
intervals are not listed separately in this report.

Further details regarding assay lengths, percentage of sampled core and assays by 
lithological units for drilling that contributes to the resource estimates presented in this report are 
discussed in the analysis of data for each property in Section 17, Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves. The sample quality is good and the samples are considered by the author to be 
representative of the areas tested by drilling.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES and 

SECURITY

ALS Chemex was the only laboratory used for Blackstone's drilling at the Lainejaur, 
Lappvattnet and Ror projects. Analysis of core samples was completed by ALS Chemex in 
Vancouver, B.C.  

All Blackstone drill core samples were kept with Blackstone's possession until transport 
to the laboratory. Drill core samples were split (in half length wise) using a diamond core cut 
saw at its core logging/cutting facility in Vallen, Sweden. Samples of halved drill core were 
sealed in labelled plastic samples bags and securely crated for shipping. Crates of samples were 
then shipped by road transport to ALS Chemex's Preparation Facility in Pitea Sweden.  

13.1  Sample Preparation 

Drill core samples analysed at ALS Chemex were first prepared at ALS' preparation lab 
in Pitea, Sweden. There samples were logged in their tracking system, then weighed and the 
entire sample was crushed to better than 70% -2mm. A split off 250 gram sample was then 
pulverized to better than 85% passing 75 microns. These pulps were then shipped to Vancouver, 
B.C by commercial aircraft for completion of analytical work. Pulps and rejects have been 
returned to BLV and stored in Vallen, Sweden. 

13.2  Analysis 

Analyses performed at ALS Chemex are as follows: 

analysis for Ni, Cu, Co, Ag and S by peroxide fusion and ICP-AES; 

Pt, Pd and Au by fire assay and ICP-AES finish (30 gram nominal sample weight). 

13.3  Quality Assurance/Quality Control 

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA\QC) was implemented at the beginning of 
drilling in 2007 whereby standards were routinely inserted into the sample stream with at least 
one standard sample inserted per sample batch submitted to the laboratory. The program was 
further strengthened in 2007 with the introduction of blank samples and a more routine insertion 
of standards; i.e., one blank or standard every 20 samples.  

Once received, analytical results were imported into BLV's central database using 
commercial software, DHLogger (Century Systems) which provides quality control charting. 
Sample batches containing samples with analytical deviations of more than 5% were flagged, 
evaluated and batches re-assayed as needed.

RCI reviewed the results of the various QA/QC programs and concluded that the 
historical and recent sampling were acceptable for the purpose of resource estimation. The large 
amount of historical sample data without current QA/QC control is one of the factors that limit

part of the site visit for check assaying (see Section 14 â€“ Data Verification).

14 DATA VERIFICATION 

14.1 Site Visit and Independent Sampling 

A visit was made to the Lappvattnet, Lainejaur and Ror Deposits from June 4
th

 to 
June 6

th
, 2008. Diamond drill core from all three deposits was examined and samples 

were taken from each deposit by taking Â¼ splits of the remaining half core. An effort was 
made to sample a range of grades.  

At no time were any employees of Blackstone advised as to the identification of 
the samples to be chosen during the visit.  

Lainejaur

Three samples were selected by the authors, Â¼ sawn by the technician and placed 
by the authors into sample bags which were sealed with tape and placed in a rice bag. 
Sulphides in the drill core ranged from semi-massive to massive.  

Lappvattnet

Two samples were selected by the authors, Â¼ sawn by the technician and placed 
by the authors into sample bags which were sealed with tape and placed in a rice bag. 
Sulphides in the drill core demonstrated durchbewegung textures, (textures in which 
penetrative deformation has thoroughly kneaded the sulphides and completely obliterated 
any original textures, producing rounded-milled silica clasts in a sulphide matrix). 

Ror

Three samples were selected by the authors, Â¼ sawn by the technician and placed 
by the authors into sample bags which were sealed with tape and placed in a rice bag. 
Sulphides in the drill core ranged from disseminated to net textured to semi-massive.  

Once all the samples had been collected, the two rice bags were sealed with 
security seals and packed in the authors' luggage back to Canada. From there they were 
sent via Dicom courier to Activation Laboratories in Ancaster, Ontario for analysis. 

All samples were analyzed for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pd and Pt. Bulk densities on drill 
core, as well as densities measured on the pulps using a pycnometer were also performed. 

The following three figures present the results of the site visit verification samples 
for Ni, Cu and Co. The verification sample results compare favourably with the results 
obtained by Blackstone for the three elements.

14.2 Blackstone Quality Control Program

Blackstone implemented a quality assurance/quality control (QC) program for the drilling 
on all three Properties. One certified reference material and blank material were added regularly 
to the sample stream. Field duplicates, in the form of Â¼ split core did not form part of the QC 
Program.  

The certified reference material was LBE-1 which was certified by WCM Minerals in 
Vancouver, British Columbia. The characterization for this standard used an average of 32 
samples sent to either three or four labs.  After graphing the round robin data for LBE-1, it was 
felt that the materials were suitable for monitoring lab accuracy. 

The blank material used was sterile drill core. An upper limit of three times detection was 
used for monitoring purposes. 

14.3 Results of the Quality Control Program

14.3.1 Lainejaur 

The Lainejaur Deposit had 52 data points for LBE-1 for Ni, Cu and Co. The performance 
of this reference material was acceptable. All lab QC was reviewed as well, and results indicated 
a satisfactory performance from the lab.  

There were 59 data points for the blank material. None of the Co values was above three 
times detection limit. Three Cu values were above three times detection limit, with the highest

value at 0.038% Cu. Seventeen values were greater than three times detection limit for Ni, with 
the highest value at 0.022% Ni. In spite of the numerous failures on the blank material, the 
author believes there is no impact on the resource for this deposit, as the grades demonstrated in 
the blanks are well below the cut-off grades for each metal. 

14.3.2 Lappvattnet 

The Lappvattnet Deposit had seven data points for LBE-1 for Ni, Cu and Co. The global 
performance of the reference material was acceptable. All lab QC was reviewed as well, and 
results indicated a satisfactory performance from the lab.  

There were six data points for the blank material. All data points assayed at or below 
three times detection limit for Ni, Cu and Co.   

14.3.3 Ror 

The Ror Deposit had 43 data points for LBE-1 for Ni, Cu and Co. The performance of 
this reference material was acceptable. All lab QC was reviewed as well, and results indicated a 
satisfactory performance from the lab.  

There were 41 data points for the blank material. There were no values greater than three 
times detection limit for either Cu or Co. There were nine values greater than three times 
detection limit for Ni, with eight values very close to 0.007% Ni, and the highest value at 0.02% 
Ni. No action was required, as the cut-off grade for Ni is well above the highest value returned 
for the blank material.   

The authors consider the data to be of good quality and acceptable for use in a resource 
estimate.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES  

No properties with significant Ni Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves are located 
adjacent to the BLV properties. Within approximately 10 km of each property, exploration 
permits include additional permits held by Blackstone Nickel AB and also permits held by 
Lundin Mining, Boliden and NAN at Lainejaur, and Norrland Resources, Alba Mineral 
Resources, and Geoforum Scandinavia in the Ror and Lappvattnet areas.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 

TESTING

Records of metallurgical work are only readily available for the Ror deposit completed 
by Outokumpu Mining (Palosaari, 1990). This study states, "the froth flotation on a sample of 
Rormyrberget Nickel Deposit shows that it responses (sic) fairly well on selective xanthate 
flotation in natural pH of the ore. In one stage grinding the fineness (55% at -74 microns) was 
found to be optimum; however, the main loss of pentlandite was in the fine fraction (-37 
microns) of the tailing which favours coarser grinding in the rougher flotation and regrinding for 
scavenger flotation ...  Ni-recovery of 84.5% and a concentrate grade of 4.13% Ni was achieved 
with selective rougher-scavenger flotation in natural pH of the ore ... The estimated nickel 
recovery in closed circuit on the feed material tested is 74% on the concentration grade 15% Ni, 
6.5% MgO and 2.5% Cu. The precious metal assays of the final concentrate are typical for the 
Ni-concentrates of this type. All assays of harmful elements like As, Sb, Bi and Te are very 
low."

The Lainejaur deposit clearly achieved economic recoveries at the time it was operating 
but no records were located describing the details of the processing.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE 

ESTIMATES

MINERAL RESOURCES  

SUMMARY  

The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared by John Reddick, M.Sc., P.Geo., of 
Reddick Consulting Inc. (RCI) who is a Consulting Geologist and independent of BLV. Mineral 
resources at the BLV Sweden Ni-Cu Projects were estimated by RCI with the use of geological 
modelling software, GEMS 6.1.4, provided by Gemcom Software International (Gemcom).  

The BLV Sweden Mineral Resources occur in three separate areas on three separate 
properties. The Lainejaur resource is located on the Lainejaur nr 100 permit, within the 
Skelleftea mining district, 100 km from Skelleftea. The Lappvattnet resource is found on the 
Lappvattnet nr 100 permit, and Rormyrberget (Ror) resource is located on the Rormyrberget nr 
100 permit. The Lappvattnet and Ror deposits are located approximately 50 km apart in the 
Vasterbotten Nickel Trend and 100 km from the Lainejaur deposit (Figure 4-1). 

 The Mineral Resources for the Lainejaur and Lappvattnet deposits used similar 
estimation methodologies. The minimum Gross Metal Value (GMV) cut-offs and minimum core 
length criteria used for these estimates were similar as they appear to have economic potential 
that would be best suited for development by the use of underground mining methods. The Ror 
deposit is a larger, lower grade deposit and is considered to be a resource with potential bulk 
mineable characteristics so it was estimated using block modelling methods and a lower GMV 
cut-off than those applied for Lainejaur and Lappvattnet. Contained metal and Mineral Resource 
estimates are summarised in Tables 17-1 and 17-2.

17.1  Lainejaur 

DATABASE AND APPROACH  

The Lainejaur Mineral Resource estimate is based entirely on surface diamond drilling 
done in 2007 or 2008.  The entire database consists of 43 diamond drill holes totalling 12,732.97 
m. The coring has all been at diameters ranging from 35.2 mm to 42 mm, approximately the same 
as BQ diameter wireline core at 36 mm. All of the 2007 and 2008 drilling was directed at an area 
down-plunge of historical mining and drilling. No drilling results from the area in which mining 
was previously done were available in the database used. The area previously mined extended 
from surface to about 150m depth over a down-plunge length of slightly less than 300m. There 
are a total of 35 drillhole intercepts of massive or semi-massive sulphides but economic 
mineralisation also occurs in other lithologies, notably gabbro. There are a total of 16 composited 
intervals totalling 70.41m that contribute to this mineral estimate.  

Recent drill hole collars have been located using both high accuracy GPS and by 
handheld GPS. Collar coordinates are recorded in both the local Lainejaur property grid 
coordinates and in the Swedish RT90-2.5 grid system. A correction of the azimuth by adding 
2.90 degrees was applied to the surveyed azimuth readings to have the azimuths conform to 
UTM north before entering the survey data into the Gemcom database. Recent drilling by BLV 
on the property in the area covered by this estimate occurs over an area of slightly less than 0.8 
km by 0.4 km. Angled drilling has been done on a series of fences down the plunge of the 
orebody. The area drilled was plotted on vertical sections oriented both east-west and north-south 
on 50m centres. Drill hole intercepts in the deposit range in depth from 180 to 550m below 
surface (~200m a.s.l. to ~200m b.s.l.). 

RCI is of the opinion that the quality of diamond drill hole data is acceptable for Inferred 
resource estimation. RCI estimated the Mineral Resource at Lainejaur with polygonal cross-

sectional estimation methodology using Gemcom Software International Inc. V. 6.1.4 GEMS 
software. Polygons outlining the potentially economic mineralisation, based on sulphide content 
and GMV, were constructed on vertical cross-sections oriented north-south (parallel to the long 
axis of the mineralisation) in order to constrain resource estimates and to assist in grade 
interpolation. Those polygons that met minimum grade and width criteria were used for the 
estimates.   

BULK DENSITY

The core examined by RCI was generally unbroken and competent. Database records for 
RQD measurements and core recoveries were not recorded in the drillholes. No SG test work has 
been done by BLV and, although there was previous mining, no records of SG from that 
production were available. The only SGs available are those obtained for the check samples 
taken by RCI during the site visit. The average SG of the three samples in semi-massive to 
massive mineralisation as determined by bulk density testing of the core is 3.55 and a bulk 
density factor of 3.55 t/m

 for volume-tonnage conversion was therefore used for this resource 

estimate.  

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS  

RCI received ASCII files from BLV with drill hole collar locations, borehole deviation 
survey data, assay data and geology data for the drilling. The ASCII files were exported from 
BLV's DHLogger drillhole database. These files were imported into a GEMS database created 
by RCI. Approximately 20% of the assay database records were verified by RCI against pdf 
copies of the original assay certificates and the drill logs for those records. No errors were found 
when comparing the Gemcom database against the original logs or assay certificates. RCI 
concluded that the drillhole database was sufficiently free of error to be adequate for resource 
estimation of the Lainejaur deposit. 

Assays Grade Distributions and Statistics 

RCI examined assay grade distributions for the three metals being estimated based on 
assays from the 43 holes within the resource area.  Review of histograms and log probability 
plots shows primarily log-normal distribution with some positive skew and some evidence of 
mixed populations (Figures 17-1A, 17-1B, 17-1C). Peaks at 0.002% Ni, 0.002% Cu and at 
0.001% Co are all attributed to values entered into the database at one half of the analytical 
detection limits. A check of associated Ni and Cu values for the 0.001% Co results shows most, 
but not all of them, to be associated with very low Ni and Cu values, often at or below detection 
limits as well.

Figure 17-1C Histogram of Co Assays in Lainejaur Resource Area

When broken down by host rock (8 major sub-units, Table 17-3), the units hosting 
significant Ni, Cu and Co mineralisation are the Gabbro, SMS or MS lithologies. The Gabbro 
units have mean grades of 0.12% Ni, 0.09% Cu and 0.012% Co and the grouped SMS and MS 
units have mean grades of 2.17% Ni, 0.70% Cu and 0.133% Co. It is primarily the assays from 
the sulphide-rich lithologies that account for the second population of values that contributes to 
the set of higher grade peaks seen in the assay histograms (at > 1% Ni, > 1% Cu and > 0.05% 
Co).

A considerable amount of mineralisation (84 sample intervals) with grades of > 0.5% Ni 
is also hosted by the other units, mostly Gabbro. Short, sulphide-rich intervals within other units 
were not always broken out as major lithology units in the logging. The result is that assay data 
from mixed lithologies are distributed throughout the major lithological units. All of the intervals 
that contribute to the resource estimates presented in this report have within them intervals of 
SMS or MS. There are also some drill holes along the trend of the resources that have a few 
isolated intervals of SMS or MS, but that do not meet the minimum grade and/or width criteria 
for inclusion as resources. 

The sulphide-rich unit that hosts most of the mineralisation occurs as a tabular body that 
strikes roughly east-west with a shallow dip of ~30Âº to the north. It is tabular in shape with a 
cross-sectional area that varies from 40 to 80 metres across and averages about 5 m thick. As 
shown from earlier mining, has good overall continuity down-dip but has a very irregular cross-
sectional shape. The footwall units to the sulphide-rich units are a variety of rocks, formerly 
labelled schist in old mine drawings and the hangingwall rocks are mostly gabbro. Table 17-3 
lists the mean grade and mean sample length for rock types with 20 or more samples. As most

(10.6% of the total drilled length). The mean sample length is 0.87m with a range from 0.11m to 
2.50m (Figure 17-2). The most common sample length is 1.0m with the average length of the 
better grade samples associated with the SMS or MS lithologies at 0.59m. All of the SMS or MS 
lithology intervals were sampled although in some cases the sample intervals crossed lithological 
contacts.

Grade Capping

 The higher grade Ni, Cu and Co values (> 1% Ni, > 1% Cu and > 0.05% Co) appear to 
be a valid part of the assay distribution and are associated with massive and semi-massive 
sulphides. As the intervals from which these assays are found are restricted during grade 
interpolation to polygons which contain SMS or MS intervals, they were not capped. The set of 
Ni values associated with the sulphide rich units range from 0.13% to 5.06% Ni over sample 
lengths of 0.26m to 1.10m.  

GEOLOGICAL AND GRADE INTERPRETATION AND MODELLING OF 

MINERALIZATION ENVELOPES

The Lainejaur deposit was modelled on vertical cross-sections on 50m centres using 
sections 1648100E to 1648450E. The drillholes were coded according to major lithological units 
and a geological model using wireframes was constructed. This model differentiated the sulphide 
bearing units and also modelled the topographic surface. The sulphide-bearing units are quite 
continuous at the scale on which the deposit is drilled, although details from past mining shows 
the shape of the sulphide bearing unit on east-west sections to be considerably more complex 
than the present Gemcom model. The modelled wireframe was used to constrain the grade

interpretation of the mineralised zones. The geological interpretation is based on documented 
descriptions of the mine geology (Grip, 1961; Martinson, 1996). The southern limit of the 
gabbro-norite as modelled begins north of the old mine workings in the area of BLV drilling on 
section 7240950N and the northern limit extends past 7241500N so the strike length of recently 
drilled sulphide unit is ~550m. Figure 17-4 shows the interpretation and drillholes on Section 
1648250E, looking east. Approximately 300m of the mineralisation (from surface to the southern 
limit of the BLV drilling) was previously mined. The area to the north of the BLV drilling past 
Section 7251550N remains open with a good grade interval in hole LAI-08-034 at 7241550N 
that grades 1.63% Ni, 0.51% Cu and 0.07% Co over a core length of 2.85m from 558.3 to 
561.15m in SMS and MS units. However, a short distance north of that hole is also the end of the 
BLV permit.

Figure 17-6 is a copy of a series of east-west sections through the upper part of the old 
mine workings. The overall flat cross-sectional geometry, the continuous trend of the deposit on 
a scale of tens of metres, and the relationship of the ore to the hangingwall and footwall rocks is 
clear. In addition, the fairly complex nature of the ore on a scale of 1 to 10 metres is apparent. 
The ability to resolve the geometry of the deposit at that scale would not be possible using only 
surface drilling and requires underground access.

RESOURCE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 

A total of 16 intervals from an assay database of 1,552 samples in 43 drill holes, 
representing approximately 1,346 metres of drilling, were used for the estimate. Mineralized 
outlines were defined on 50 metre sections by applying a US$100 gross metal value (GMV) cut-
off for nickel, copper and cobalt. Platinum, palladium, gold and silver values were included in 
database of the assayed values but were not included in the estimates. The resources fall in a 
continuous mineralised zone that has multiple drillholes on 4 longitudinal (north-south) sections 
across a width of ~50 to 150m and over a down-plunge length of ~550m (7240950N to 
7241500N). There are additional drilled sections that do not have resources on them.  

GMV cut-off values for Lainejaur are based on the assumption that the deposit is of a 
potential size and nature to allow for underground mining methods. The GMV cut-off value of  

 US$100/T was derived from a review of recent technical reports filed on SEDAR for similar 
deposit types. The metal prices are slightly below the 3 year average at US$8.00/lb. for nickel, 
US$2.00/lb. for Cu and US$8.00/lb. for Co. No assumptions regarding recoveries were made. An 
example of the GMV calculation for Lainejaur is shown in Table 17-4. 

Table 17-4 Lainejaur Gross Metal Value Calculation 

GMV per Tonne = (Ni% x US$176.37) + (Cu% x US$44.09) + (Co% x US$176.37) 

Minimum Grade and Width Criteria 

Composites were calculated on a length-weighted basis. Composites used in the resource 
estimate met the following criteria: 

A minimum 2.0m core length and a GMV  US$100/T over the composited 
interval. The average length of the 16 composites used was 4.40 m with intervals 
ranging from 2.10 to 9.88m. Eight of the 16 intervals were between 2.0 and 3.0m 
in core length;

In most instances the composite length approximates 90% of the true width; 

Entire assay intervals below the minimum GMV were included if needed to 
achieve the minimum 2.0m composite length. No fractional assay intervals were 
used;

Intervals of internal waste were carried, provided the overall minimum GMV was 
maintained;  

Unsampled intervals were included at nil grades; 

Incremental intervals of  US$75 GMV were included as either internal or 
external dilution for composites, provided the weighted GMV value for the entire 
composited interval remained  US$100.

Volume and Tonnage Calculations

Interpretation of the mineralised zone polygons was guided by:

following the general attitude of the previously mined zone;  

interpolating between sulphide-bearing units identified in drillholes;

interpolating between the composited limits for GMV values. A series of 
preliminary polygons were constructed using composites at US$50 GMV to better 
define the continuity of mineralised zones as the geometry of the zones was more 
easily interpreted at that lower cut-off; 

extrapolating beyond a composited interval for the last hole on a section based on 
the attitude of nearby polygons on the same section or on adjoining sections. 

Polygons were interpolated half-way between adjacent drillholes on a section, to a 
maximum of 50m from a drillhole and were extrapolated to a maximum of 50m from a 
qualifying intercept where there were no constraining holes. The influence of a polygon was 25m 
towards or away from the plane of a section.  

For polygons that qualified for inclusion in the estimates on the basis of the minimum 
GMV criterion, the area of each polygon was determined using Gemcom software. All polygons 
included in the estimate had a GMV  US$100/T. The areas of the polygons were exported to a 
spreadsheet and these areas were then multiplied by the thickness of the sections (50m) for 
volume estimates. Tonnages were then determined by using the volume estimate and a SG of 
3.55, as determined from samples taken by RCI during the site visit. A spreadsheet showing the 
drillhole intercepts contributing to the resource estimate and the grade and tonnage for each 
polygon is included in Appendix I. Figure 17-7 shows the interpretation of resource polygons for 
Section 1648250E.

LAINEJAUR RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

Mineral Resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by CIM as 
stipulated in NI 43-101. Under CIM/NI 43-101 guidelines, a Mineral Resource must have some 
potential for future mining. In order to justify classification of the deposit as a Mineral Resource, 
RCI evaluated the potential economics in terms of:  

the accountable/payable metals to determine a GMV; 

the range of cut-off grades and tonnage estimates from recent resource estimates 
filed on SEDAR for somewhat similar Ni-Cu deposits; and, 

the fact that there was past production on the property.

The Lainejaur Mineral Resources are classified by RCI as Inferred. The most important 
factor influencing the classification was the uncertainty of the geometry of the mineralised zones 
due to a drillhole spacing that ranges from 50 to 100m in the area recently drilled. Past 
production and the interpretation of the recent BLV drilling suggests that the overall continuity 
of the zone is quite good. The highly variable geometry on a 5-10m scale, as shown in Figure 17-
6, suggests that infill drilling on at least 50m centres and possibly closer would be needed to 
upgrade the confidence level of the current resource. RCI cautions that neither a feasibility study

nor a detailed preliminary economic assessment have been carried out for the Mineral Resources 
estimated in this report and that they are not Mineral Reserves and they do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. 

MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION

RCI estimates that the Lainejaur Mineral Resources, at a US$100 GMV cut-off, contain 
approximately 650 thousand tonnes of Inferred Mineral Resources grading 1.33 % Ni, 0.66% Cu 
and 0.09% Co (Table 17-2A and repeated here as Table 17-5).

Category Tonnes Ni% Cu% Co%

     

Inferred 645,000 1.33 0.66 0.09 

VALIDATION  

RCI completed a detailed visual validation of the Lainejaur resource model and 
underlying composite and assay data. The model was checked for proper compositing of drill 
hole intervals and GMV and the geometry of the polygons was inspected on east-west, north-
south sections and in plan view. The checks showed good agreement between drill hole 
composite values, assay values and polygon geometry. The overall geometry of the modelled 
sulphide zone hosting the resources matches well with that from the area of past production that 
is up-plunge of the area hosting the current resource estimate. 

Production from the Lainejaur deposit by Boliden is quoted as being 100,526 tonnes 
grading 2.2% Ni, 0.93% Cu and 0.1% Co during the period 1941-1945 (Grip, E., 1946; 
Martinsson, E., 1996). These grades are somewhat higher than those of the current estimate. A 
detailed description of the mining methods and mining widths was not available. RCI does not 
have sufficient historical data to determine if the difference in grade is a function of a variation 
in grade down-plunge or a matter of selective mining at a higher cutoff grade during previous 
mining. On the basis of information available, all of the areas subject to prior mining (down to 
150m below surface) are above the elevation of the current resource estimates. 

Publication Ba 57 by the Geological Survey of Sweden quotes a historical, unclassified 
and non NI 43-101 compliant mineral estimate for the Lainejaur deposit of 119,000 T @ 2.2% 
Ni, 1% Cu (Table 3, SGU Ba 57, 2005, Kathol, B. And Weihed, P., ed.). Figures from that report 
(Fig. 83, pg. 136) depict the ore body from surface to ~150m below surface so it is assumed that 
the estimate is only for that portion of the deposit. No resources for that area are included in the 
estimates presented in this report.

MINERAL RESERVES and OTHER MATTERS 

BLV has not completed a mining prefeasibility or feasibility study and consequently 
there are no reserves reported for the Lainejaur Property.  The property is accessible by road. The 
infrastructure in the area is considered good. Mining methods would be determined after a 
preliminary assessment, prefeasibility or feasibility study and would depend on the success of

future exploration. The mining method would likely be underground and processing would be 
likely done by conventional milling. 

RCI has not independently researched title, environmental or permitting regulations for 
Sweden; instead we have relied on information provided by BLV for matters relating to property 
titles, surface rights, permitting and environmental matters. RCI is not aware of any mining, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political or other relevant issues which might materially affect the Mineral Resources.

17.2  Lappvattnet 

DATABASE AND APPROACH  

The Lappvattnet Mineral Resource estimate is based entirely on surface diamond drilling.  
The entire database consists of 129 diamond drill holes totalling 18,074.45 m. The coring has all 
been at diameters ranging from 35.2 mm to 42 mm, approximately the same as BQ diameter 
wireline core at 36 mm. The drilling done by BLV in 2007 and 2008 was all BQ size. Drilling 
done by others prior to BLV was in the period 1973 to 1992. Twenty-eight of the 129 holes were 
drilled by BLV.  

Twenty-nine holes in the database fall outside the area of the resources or had no assay or 
lithology data recorded so they were excluded from the resource estimates. The deposit as 
estimated in this report has been drill-intersected by 100 holes totalling 17,388.43 m. Only 84 of 
those holes have assays recorded for them (2,521 assay records totalling 2,330.4m). The holes 
without assays are mostly drilled in areas away from the mineralised zone. None of the holes 
without assay data intersect the polygons that constrain the resources presented in this report. 
There are a total of 70 drillhole intercepts of mineralised zones, of which 32 totalling 222.58m 
have intervals that contribute to this mineral estimate. 

Recent drill hole collars have been located using both high accuracy GPS and by 
handheld GPS. Drill hole collars from previous operators have been located using either high 
accuracy GPS and by handheld GPS. Collar coordinates are recorded in the Swedish RT90-2.5 
grid system. A correction of the azimuth by adding 4.6 degrees was applied to the surveyed 
azimuth readings to have the azimuths conform to UTM north before entering the survey data 
into the Gemcom database. Drilling on the property in the area covered by this estimate occurs 
over an area of slightly less than 1.7 km by 1.1 km. Drilling has mostly been done on 40m 
centres on sections oriented at 335 degrees. Most drillholes are parallel to the section azimuth. 
Drill hole intercepts in the deposit range in depth from near surface to 350m deep (~80m a.s.l. to 
~260m b.s.l.). 

RCI is of the opinion that the quality of diamond drill hole data is acceptable for Inferred 
resource estimation. RCI estimated the Mineral Resource at Lappvattnet with polygonal cross-
sectional estimation methodology using Gemcom Software International Inc. V. 6.1.4 GEMS 
software. Polygons outlining the potentially economic mineralisation, based on sulphide content 
and GMV in order to constrain resource estimates and to assist in grade interpolation, were 
constructed on vertical cross-sections oriented 335Âº. Those polygons that met minimum grade 
and width criteria were used for the estimates.   

BULK DENSITY

The core examined by RCI was generally unbroken and competent. No records for RQD 
measurements and core recoveries were available. However, as mentioned in the following 
section on "Mining Reserves and Other Matters", high groundwater flows were encountered 
during previous underground development and further geotechnical work is needed should the 
project progress to a more advanced stage. The core seen by RCI indicates that bulk density will 
be the same as, or very close to the specific gravity (SG) determined from RCI's check samples. 
No SG test work has been done by BLV. The average SG of the samples in semi-massive to

 for volume-tonnage conversion was therefore used for 

this resource estimate. The SG used for the historical resource estimate reported by Akerman 
(1987) was not available. 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS  

RCI received ASCII files from BLV with drill hole collar locations, borehole deviation 
survey data, assay data and geology data for the drilling. The ASCII files were exported from 
BLV's DHLogger drillhole database. These files were imported into a GEMS database created 
by RCI. Approximately 20% of the assay database records were verified by RCI against either 
photocopies of drill logs and assay certificates (1973 to 1992 holes) or pdf copies of the assay 
certificates and pdf logs for the BLV drilling (2007 and 2008 drilling). No hard copy records 
could be found for two of the historic drillholes. All other drill logs and assay records were 
located. No errors were found. The assay records for historic drilling often included multiple 
results, with different assay methods used for check assays of higher grade results. The protocols 
for that re-assaying were not documented in the records reviewed. No errors were found in 
checking the more recent BLV drilling. RCI concluded that the assay and survey databases were 
sufficiently free of error to be adequate for resource estimation of the Lappvattnet deposit. 

Assays Grade Distributions and Statistics 

RCI examined assay grade distributions for the three metals being estimated based on 
assays from all of the holes in the database with assay data that contributed to this estimate. The 
histograms for these holes (n=2,521) show that while the distributions are primarily log-normal 
in nature, there is a considerable amount of evidence of mixed populations (Figures 17-9A, 17-
9B and 17-9C). There are peaks at low values that are associated with entries for data at or below 
detection limits. In particular, the plots for Cu and Co have a large number of entries for data at 
lower detection levels. These values do not impact the resource estimates in any measurable way. 
Additionally, a separate distribution of high grade values is indicated for each of the metals that 
are associated with mineralisation in the sulphide-bearing rocks. 

The mineralisation is generally associated with metre-scale sulphide units (massive 
sulphide, semi-massive sulphide and sulphide and logged as MS, SMS and SULF respectively) 
or related sulphide-bearing peridotite, ultramafic or pyroxenite units. The grouped sulphide units 
and the peridotite unit have the highest grade metal tenors. The majority of these host rocks are 
themselves within much more volumetrically abundant gneissic to migmatitic metagreywackes and 
biotite-graphite gneiss. The nickel-copper sulphides occur in the ultramafic bodies, but 
remobilization has occurred where, in cases, sulphides are now hosted by surrounding paragneisses 
as fragmental and breccia zones. Sulphides consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. The 

sulphide body dips steeply the south and plunges shallowly eastward. Assayed intervals for most 
lithologies have mean grades for of > 0.1% Ni. There are a significant number of well 
mineralised intervals logged as gneiss that line up very well with the units logged as ultramafic 
or sulphides as the remobilised mineralisation now cuts across lithological contacts. As these are 
in grade continuity with the sulphide units, they have been included in the resource estimates.

Table 17-6 lists the mean grade and mean sample length for assayed intervals of rock 
types in the database for which there are 20 or more assays in the area of the resource estimate. 
As most of the gneissic rock types (IGN, MGN and FGN) have only been sampled over a small 
portion of their total length, the table does not indicate average grades for each rock type, only 
the averages for the sampled intervals.

Sample Lengths 

There are a total of 2,747 samples in the entire database and 2,553.99m of the core was 
sampled (14.1% of the total drilled length). The mean sample length is 0.93m (Figure 17-10). 
The most common sample length is at 0.30m with other common lengths at 0.50m 1.0m and 
2.0m. There are 226 samples in 29 holes that fall outside the resource area.

Grade Capping

 The higher grade Ni, Cu and Co values (>1%Ni and >1%, >0.1% Co) appear to be a 
valid part of the assay distribution that is associated with massive and semi-massive sulphides. 
As the intervals from which these assays are found do not affect the grade of polygons for which 
there are no SMS or MS intervals, they were not capped.

Twin Hole Comparison

BLV twinned three drill holes from 1974 (LAP-07-01 with LAP74207 on section 13E, 
LAP-07-02 with LAP74208 on section 13E and LAP-07-004 with LAP74211 on section 14E). 
The results presented in Table 17-7A are based on intervals bracketed by US $100 GMV in the 
assay results. The results presented in Table 17-7B are based on intervals bracketed by US $50 
GMV. The results show that the interval lengths, Ni values and overall GMV values compare 
quite well between the two sets of drilling. On a length weighted basis, using the US $100 GMV 
cut-off, the BLV assaying averages 0.78% Ni over 73.29 m compared to the 1974 holes that 
average 0.68% Ni over 95.95 m.

GEOLOGICAL AND GRADE INTERPRETATION AND MODELLING OF 

MINERALIZATION ENVELOPES

Figure 17-11 is a plan view showing the area of drilling for the Lappvattnet deposit using 
the Sweden RT90-2.5 grid.

Grid spacing 200m from 7164800N and 1741000E in lower left-hand corner. Sweden RT90-2.5 grid.

The Lappvattnet deposit was modelled on vertical cross-sections on 40m centres using 
local grid sections 0 to 46S (oriented 335Âº). The drillholes were coded according to major 
lithological units. Wireframes were constructed that modelled the topographic and bedrock 
surfaces. The mineralised zone that is covered by this report extends from 8E to 27E for strike 
length of 760m.  

Polygons were constructed that constrained the interpreted sulphide-rich zones (see 
Resource Estimation Methodology below) and these polygons were extruded as wireframes to 
help with the sectional interpretation.  

Figure 17-12 shows the drillholes on Section 12E. The assays for Ni and Co values are 
more continuous than is apparent from the lithological units shown. This is because the 
mineralised intervals within the gneissic units are not broken out in the primary lithology codes 
but are identified according to precursor host rock instead.

RESOURCE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 

A total of 32 intervals from an assay database of 2,521 samples in 100 drill holes in the 
area of the estimates, representing approximately 17,388 metres of drilling were used. 
Mineralized outlines were defined on 40 metre sections by applying a US$100 gross metal value 
(GMV) cut-off for nickel, copper and cobalt. Platinum, palladium, gold and silver values were 
included in database of the assayed values but were not included in the estimates. The resources 
fall in a zone that has multiple drillholes on all most sections over a strike length of 760m (9E to 
27E). All but two of the drilled sections between 9E and 27E have resources on them (the 
exceptions are 24E and 26E) and one section (26E) has no drilling on it.  

GMV cut-off values for Lappvattnet are based on the assumption that the deposit is of a 
potential size and nature to allow for possible underground mining methods. The GMV cut-off 
value of  US$100/T was derived from a review of recent technical reports filed on SEDAR for 
similar deposit types. The metal prices were slightly below the 3 year average at US$8.00/lb. for 
nickel, US$2.00/lb. for Cu and US$8.00/lb. for Co. No assumptions regarding recoveries were 
made. An example of the GMV calculation for Lappvattnet is shown in Table 17-8. 

Table 17-8 Lappvattnet Gross Metal Value Calculation 

  GMV per Tonne = (Ni% x US$176.37) + (Cu% x US$44.09) + (Co% x US$176.37) 

Minimum Grade and Width Criteria 

Composites were calculated on a length-weighted basis. Composites used in the resource 
estimate met the following criteria: 

A minimum 3.0m core length and a GMV  US$100/T over the composited 
interval. The average length of the 32 composites used was 6.96m with intervals 
ranging from 3.09 to 24.72m. Nineteen of the 32 intervals were between 3.0 and 
5.0m in core length;

True widths approximate  80% of the cored length for almost all intercepts; 

Entire assay intervals below the minimum GMV were included if needed to 
achieve the minimum 3.0m composite length. No fractional assay intervals were 
used;

Intervals of internal waste were carried, provided the overall minimum GMV was 
maintained;  

Unsampled intervals were included at nil grades; 

Incremental intervals of  US$75 GMV were included as either internal or 
external dilution for composites, provided the weighted GMV value for the entire 
composited interval remained  US$100.

Volume and Tonnage Calculations

Interpretation of the mineralised zone polygons was guided by:

trying to follow the general attitude of the mineralised envelope;  

interpolating between sulphide rich intervals as identified in drillholes;

interpolating between the composited limits for GMV values. A series of 
preliminary polygons were constructed using composites at US$50 GMV to better 
define the continuity of mineralised zones as the geometry of the zones was more 
easily interpreted at that lower cut-off; 

extrapolating beyond a composited interval for the last hole on a section based on 
the attitude of nearby polygons on the same section or on adjoining sections. 

Polygons were interpolated half-way between adjacent drillholes on sections to a 
maximum of 50m from a drillhole and were extrapolated to a maximum of 50m from a 
qualifying intercept where there were no constraining holes. Exceptions to this constraint were 
on sections 17E, 18E, 20E and 22E where polygons were extended from drillholes to the bedrock 
surface (distances ranging from 56 to 69m) as drilling on adjacent sections 16E, 19E and 21E 
showed the mineralisation extended to the bedrock surface. 

For polygons that qualified for inclusion in the estimates on the basis of the minimum 
GMV criterion, the area of each polygon was determined using Gemcom software. The areas of 
the polygons were exported to a spreadsheet and this area was multiplied by the thickness of the 
sections (40m) for volume estimates. Due to irregular drillhole spacing, section 9E was defined 
as 35m in thickness and 10E as 45m in thickness. Tonnages were then determined by using the 
volume estimate and a SG of 3.46, as determined from samples taken by RCI during the site 
visit. A spreadsheet showing the drillhole intercepts contributing to the resource estimate and the 
grade and tonnage for each polygon is included in Appendix I. Figure 17-14 shows the drillholes 
and interpretation of resource polygons for Section 12E.

LAPPVATTNET RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

Mineral Resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by CIM as 
stipulated in NI 43-101. Under CIM/NI 43-101 guidelines, a Mineral Resource must have some 
potential for future mining. In order to justify classification of the deposit as a Mineral Resource, 
RCI evaluated the potential economics in terms of:  

the accountable/payable metals to determine a GMV; 

the range of cut-off grades and tonnage estimates from recent resource estimates 
filed on SEDAR for somewhat similar Ni-Cu deposits. 

The Lappvattnet Mineral Resources are classified by RCI as Inferred. The most important 
factor influencing the classification was the inclusion of historical drillhole data that was not 
analysed using current industry-standard QA/QC methods. The historical data used does not 
seem to be biased on the basis of limited twin hole results (see below) and there is no evidence to 
suggest that it should not be used. As the archived core for most of the historical drilling still 
exists, a program of assay verification could be instituted to upgrade the confidence in the old 
assaying in a reasonably quick time. In the opinion of RCI, such a program, with attendant 
QA/QC protocols, would be needed before the resources could be classified at a higher 
confidence level. The continuity of the mineralisation based on drilling and on past underground 
work seems to very good. RCI cautions that neither a feasibility study nor a detailed preliminary 
economic assessment have been carried out for the Mineral Resources estimated in this report 
and that they are not Mineral Reserves and they do not have demonstrated economic viability.

MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION

RCI estimates that the Lappvattnet Mineral Resources, at a US$100 GMV cut-off, 
contains approximately 1.1 million tonnes of Inferred mineral resources grading 0.91 % Ni, 
0.19% Cu and 0.02% Co (Table 17-2B and repeated here as Table 17-9).

Category Tonnes Ni% Cu% Co%

     

Inferred 1,139,000 0.91 0.19 0.02

VALIDATION  

RCI completed a detailed visual validation of the Lappvattnet resource model and 
underlying composite and assay data. The model was checked for proper compositing of drill 
hole intervals and GMV values and the geometry of the polygons was inspected in both section 
and plan. The checks showed good agreement between drill hole composite values, assay values 
and polygon geometry.  

There was previous underground development of the Lappvattnet deposit and historical 
resource estimates exist. In the period 1978â€“1982, a shaft was sunk to the 120 m level and an 
exploration drift driven on that level. RCI did not locate any records from that underground 
work. The historical resource estimate quoted in documents from the Swedish Geological Survey 
(SGU) is "an Indicated Resource of 1.1 million tonnes grading 1.0% nickel and 0.2% copper" 
(SGU Exploration Newsletter, November 2004) and alternatively, 1.0 million tonnes @ 1.0% 
nickel, 0.21% copper and 0.02% Co using a 0.4% Ni cutoff (Akerman, 1987). The current 
estimate agrees very well with the historic estimates. BLV has also referenced historic and non 
NI 43-101 compliant resources in three categories (known, probable and indicated) totalling 
2.5M tonnes @ 1.03%Ni and 0.16% Cu (source not quoted by BLV). RCI did not locate any 
reports or records that supported any of the previous estimates. 

MINERAL RESERVES and OTHER MATTERS 

BLV has not completed a mining prefeasibility or feasibility study and consequently 
there are no reserves reported for the Lappvattnet Property.  The property is accessible by road. 
The infrastructure in the area is considered good. Mining methods would be determined after a 
preliminary assessment, prefeasibility or feasibility study and would depend on the success of 
future exploration. The mining method would likely be underground and processing would be 
likely done by conventional milling.  

The underground exploration done starting in 1978 from 120m below surface identified 
high ground water inflows (1,500 l/m) and a study showed there was a need for grouting in order 
to control the water. There were also recommendations regarding the need for more detailed 
geotechnical work including improved borehole logging and analysis and hydrological studies.  
At the time the deposit was considered to be too low grade and too low tonnage to be considered 
economical (Akesson, J.A., 1983)

RCI has not independently researched title, environmental or permitting regulations for 
Sweden; instead we have relied on information provided by BLV for matters relating to property 
titles, surface rights, permitting and environmental matters. The experience gained during the 
previous underground program highlights the need for further geotechnical evaluation to mitigate 
groundwater flows. RCI is not aware of any other mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other 
relevant issues which might materially affect the Mineral Resources.

17.3  Rormyrberget 

DATABASE AND APPROACH  

The Rormyrberget (Ror) Mineral Resource estimate is based entirely on surface diamond 
drilling.  The database consists of 176 diamond drill holes totalling 37,694.87m.  The coring has 
all been at diameters ranging from 35.2 mm to 42 mm, approximately the same as BQ diameter 
wireline core at 36 mm. The drilling done by BLV in 2007 and 2008 was all BQ size.

All the drilling was done in the period 1979 - 2008. There were several phases of drilling 
with most of the drilling occurring between 1979 and 1983 or between 1989 and 1992. Ten of 
the 176 holes were drilled by BLV. The deposit as estimated in this report has been drill-
intersected by 162 holes totalling 34,018.96m. Fourteen holes were not used as they had no 
survey data for dips or azimuth. There are a total of 146 drillhole intervals that intercept the 
wireframe constraining the resource estimate and these intercepts total 15,623.4m. There are a 
total of 5,907 assays in the 176 holes in the entire database. Of the 5,376 assays of sampled core 
in the holes for which there are survey data, 5,117 are found in the 146 intervals that intersect the 
constraining wireframe and therefore contribute to this mineral estimate 

Recent drill hole collars have been located using both high accuracy GPS and by 
handheld GPS. Drill hole collars from previous operators have been located with either high 
accuracy GPS and by handheld GPS. Collar coordinates are recorded in the Swedish RT90-2.5 
grid system. A correction of the azimuth by adding 3.7 degrees was applied to the surveyed 
azimuth readings to have the azimuths conform to UTM north before entering the survey data 
into the Gemcom database. Drilling on the property in the area covered by this estimate occurs 
over an area of approximately than 1.1 km by 0.9 km. In the main part of the deposit defined to 
date (43 sections covering 1.1km) drilling has been done on 25m centres on sections oriented at 
334 degrees. Drilling is present on all sections from 10E to 46 E and is irregularly spaced on a 
number of sections for a distance of ~600m to the northeast and 400m to the southwest. Almost 
all of drillholes are parallel to the azimuth of the sections. Drill hole intercepts in the deposit 
range in depth from near surface to over almost 700m deep (~260m a.s.l. to ~425m b.s.l.). 

RCI is of the opinion that the quality of diamond drill hole data is acceptable for Inferred 
resource estimation. RCI estimated the Mineral Resource at Ror using block modelling 
estimation methodology using Gemcom Software International Inc. V. 6.1.4 GEMS software. 
Wireframes outlining the potentially economic mineralisation, based on lithological units, were 
constructed on vertical cross-sections in order to constrain resource estimates and to assist in 
grade interpolation. Blocks within those wireframes that met minimum grade criteria were used 
for the estimates.   

BULK DENSITY

The core examined by RCI was generally unbroken and competent. No records for RQD 
measurements and core recoveries were available. No SG test work has been done by BLV. SG 
measurements were available from core samples tested in 1979-80 and the average value from 
those tests for pyroxenite samples is 3.06, peridotite samples average 2.84 and sulphide rich 
samples average 2.99. The average SG of the samples taken by RCI in sulphide-rich 
mineralisation as determined by both pycnometer and bulk density testing of the pulps is 3.53.

On the basis of the comprehensive sampling of core in 1979-80, a bulk density factor of 3.00

 for volume-tonnage conversion was used for this resource estimate. 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS  

RCI received ASCII files from BLV with drill hole collar locations, borehole deviation 
survey data, assay data and geology data for the drilling. The ASCII files were exported from 
BLV's DHLogger drillhole database. These files were imported into a GEMS database created 
by RCI. Approximately 20% of the assay database records were verified by RCI against either 
photocopies of drill logs and assay certificates (1979 to 1997 holes) or pdf copies of the assay 
certificates and pdf logs for the BLV drilling (2008 drilling). The assay records for historic 
drilling often included multiple results, with different assay methods used for check assays of 
higher grade results. The protocols for that re-assaying were not documented in the records 
reviewed. In some cases a complete set of original and check assays could not be found, but the 
assays entered into the database were found for over 95% of the records checked. Samples from 
historic drilling that returned values less than detection limits were entered in the database as 
0.01% Ni, 0.01% Cu and 0.01% Co for several holes.  One historic hole had sample intervals 
indicated in the log but no assay data could be found. Those intervals had grade values of zero 
assigned to them in the DHLogger database. All other drill logs and assay records were located. 
No errors were found in checking the more recent BLV drilling. RCI concluded that the assay 
and survey databases were sufficiently free of error to be adequate for resource estimation of the 
Ror deposit. The impact on the resource of the historical assays that could not be located (less 
than 5%) is considered to be minimal, especially given that a background of nil was used for all 
unsampled intervals during grade estimation. Validation of historic assaying is one of 
recommended tasks that needs to be undertaken if upgrading the classification of the resource 
estimates to something other than Inferred is considered. 

Assays Grade Distributions and Statistics 

RCI examined assay grade distributions for Ni, Cu and Co based on 5,113 assays from 
151 holes in which there were analyses for each metal.  

The mineralisation is hosted by a number of units. The higher grade assays are mostly 
associated with the sulphide-rich units but clearly occur in all major rock types. When broken 
down by host rock (Table 17-10) it can be seen that the units designated as SULF, PRDT, PYXT 
and UM are the best mineralised lithologies.  

Tables 17-10A to 17-10C list the distribution of grade values for the major rock types in 
the entire database and, for which all three elements are assayed. As most rock types have only 
been sampled over a portion of their total length, the table does not indicate average grades for 
each rock type, only the averages for the sampled intervals. Additionally, there are a number of 
assay intervals that cross lithological contacts (492) and these are not included in these tables.

RCI checks of the original logs against the digital database show that the primary 
lithological units labelled as SULF are not recorded as primary lithological units in those logs. 
Instead, they are interpreted sections of relatively sulphide-rich ultramafic units. It appears that 
these interpretations are based on assays and sulphide content, but no systematic relationship is 
apparent from the data in the logs. As the estimate for this report allowed assays from multiple 
lithological units to be combined during the grade interpolation step, the subdivision of the 
ultramafic units into sulphide-rich and sulphide-poor populations has no impact on the estimates, 
and in fact assisted with developing the grade envelopes. 

Presented below, are histograms for all Ni, Cu and Co assay data in the database (Figures 
17-16A, 17-16B, 17-16C respectively). The overall distribution of the Ni values is log-normal in 
shape. A number of higher grade values that are related to the sulphide-rich samples contribute to 
a higher grade set of values over 1% Ni. There are minor peaks at very low values that are 
associated with entries for data at or below detection limits. These values do not impact the 
resource estimates in any measurable way. The histograms for the Cu and Co values have less 
well defined distributions. The large amount of data for very low values that are associated with 
entries for data at or below detection limits masks what are likely log-normal distributions for the 
better mineralised set of samples.

Sample Lengths 

The mean sample length is 1.39m for the 5,117 assays in the wireframes used to constrain 
the estimates (Figure 17-17). The most common sample lengths are at 1.0m, 1.5m and 2.0m.  

Figure 17-17 Histogram of Sample Lengths in Ror Database 

Grade Capping

 The higher grade Ni values were capped at 3% Ni before compositing (n=23) and Cu 
values were capped at 1% before compositing (n=2). Co values were not capped as they do not 
appear to be any outlier values in the assays in the UM wireframe and they contribute very little 
to the overall GMV. The majority of higher grade samples are further constrained by the 
SULPHIDE wireframe (see below). 

COMPOSITES 

Sampled intervals totalling 7,114.47m contribute to this resource estimate. These samples 
are within one of the two wireframes that constrain the estimates. In most holes sampling was 
not done for the entire interval across the ultramafic units. Intervals in the wireframes that 
contribute to this estimate (sampled and unsampled), total 15,623.35m. Therefore only 45.5% of 
the total cored lengths that are in the wireframes and that contribute to this resource have been 
sampled. 

A total of 4,931 composites from 134 drillholes were generated within the larger of the 
two constraining wireframes (ORELITHO). A total of 1,245 composites from 104 drillholes 
were generated within the smaller of the two constraining wireframes (SULPHIDE). That 
wireframe is nested inside the ORELITHO wireframe. For more detail regarding the wireframes

see the following section. Assays were composited to lengths of 2.5 metres within the 
wireframes. Residual lengths were divided evenly so that no short composites were generated. 
Composites were generated downhole starting from the collar of the drill hole and incorporated 
all capped assay data. If there were no assay data present for the drillholes, intervals were 
composited at zero grades. 

Statistics for composited data in the ORELITHO wireframe are presented in Table 17-11.  
Statistics for composited data in the SULPHIDE wireframe are presented in Table 17-12. In the 
SULPHIDE wireframe, sampling was generally complete across the majority of the interval. In 
the ORELITHO wireframe there was generally incomplete sampling of drillholes. The inclusion 
of assays at nil grades clearly results in a significant reduction in the average grade of composites 
compared to the average grade of assayed samples in Table 17-10.

Twin Hole Comparison

BLV twinned 5 old drill holes. The results (using uncapped values) are presented in 
Table 17-13 and show that the interval lengths, Ni values and overall GMV values compare quite 
well between the two sets of drilling across the entire width of the wireframes. The intervals 
shown for high grade sections compare slightly less well but in general are comparable in terms 
of location of higher grade values. The largest discrepancy, between holes ROR90024 and ROR-
08-008 results from the presence of six samples in ranging from 2.6% to 4.2% Ni in ROR90024 
compared to only one sample above 2% Ni in ROR-08-008.

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND MODELLING OF MINERALIZATION 

ENVELOPES

Figure 17-18 is a plan view showing the area of drilling for the Ror deposit using the 
Sweden RT90-2.5 grid. The clusters of drilling in the northwestern and central part of the plan 
are both targeting the area hosting the mineralisation. The drillholes at the western end of the 
grid correspond to section 10E and the last fence of four holes at eastern end of the plot 
corresponds to section 49E.

WIREFRAMES

The Ror deposit was modelled on vertical cross-sections on 25m centres using local grid 
sections 10E to 53E oriented at 344Âº. The drillholes were coded according to major lithological 
units. A wireframe (ORELITHO wireframe) was constructed by modelling polylines that 
grouped together PYXT, PRDT, UM and SULF lithologies. The polylines define a large 
envelope modelled primary on the ultramafic units but also includes any other units that are 
within the overall envelope (mostly minor intervals of gneiss and pegmatite). This wireframe 
was then clipped by an overburden surface created from drillhole data. Within that larger 
ultramafic wireframe, another loosely defined low grade shell (NSR20) was created. 

Within the above two wireframes, another grade shell (SULPHIDE) was created. This 
wireframe was constructed by modelling polylines defining the SULF units (reflecting most of 
better grade assayed intervals) and then modified to include better grade intervals in any other 
unit. The final shapes of the polylines used to create this wireframe were modified to make the

wireframe geometrically valid from section to section and on individual sections. This wireframe 
was also clipped by an overburden surface created from drillhole data. The SULPHIDE 
wireframe is nested entirely within the ORELITHO and NSR20 wireframes. 

The low grade envelope (NSR20) was created with the intention of using it to help 
constrain the grade interpolations. However, due to the large number of unsampled intervals in 
the ultramafic units, this envelope was not based on sufficiently robust data, so it was combined 
with the larger ultramafic envelope (ORELITHO wireframe) for grade interpolation purposes. 
The data for composites in Table 17-11 for the ORELITHO wireframe includes the composites 
in the NSR20 wireframe. The SULPHIDE envelope is well supported by data from assayed 
samples. 

The ORELITHO wireframe has a strike length of ~1100m, a width ranging from about 
100m to 300m thick with the maximum depth below surface at 650m which is the deepest level 
of drilling. The ultramafic units are open to depth. It strikes at 060 to 070Âº, dips ~ 40Âº and is open 
along strike to northeast although the amount of ultramafic rock decreases. The SULPHIDE 
wireframe is similar in attitude, strike and dip parameters as the ORELITHO wireframe. On 
many sections it is represented by two or more separate lobes that range from 5 to 40 m thick. 
Figure 17-19 shows the wireframes, topographic and bedrock wireframe interpretations and 
drillholes on Section 43E. The ORELITHO wireframe is shown as magenta and the SULPHIDE 
wireframe is shown as red.

SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS 

Geostatisticians use a variety of tools to describe patterns of spatial continuity. The 
variogram is a measure of the correlation between data values as a function of their separation 
distance and direction. The distance at which the variogram reaches the maximum variance is 
called the range.  The range of the variogram corresponds roughly to the more qualitative notion 
of the "range of influence" of a sample; it is the distance over which sample values show some 
relationship or covariance.

Spatial data analysis using Gemcom software was done to generate oriented downhole 
variograms, global search variograms and oriented variograms on the Ror assay and composite 
data. Variograms were calculated for Ni, Cu and Co. Consistent nugget values and ranges were 
found for most data, directions of preferred continuity were evident that conformed to the overall 
geometry of the lithological units and the sulphide rich zones. Appendix II contains selected 
plots of typical variograms for Ni assays and Ni composites.  

The model used for all grade interpolations is described by a nugget component (C0) and 
a spherical component (C1) that has ranges from 30 to 75m depending on orientation.  A nugget

Ni grade for Inferred material; 

Cu grade for Inferred material; 

Co grade for Inferred material; 

(Gross Metal Value) GMV for Inferred material. 

Additional folders for Ni, Cu, Co and GMV values were prepared for validation using 
inverse distance squared (ID

) and nearest neighbour (NN) estimations. 

ROCK TYPE and DENSITY MODEL 

The rock type model was coded with integer rock codes from the modelled 3D 
wireframes as described in Table 17-16. The selection of blocks for coding was based on the 
block being more than 50% by volume within a wireframe using a needling accuracy of nine 
needles per block oriented vertically. The blocks within the ORELITHO wireframe were first 
coded as UM rock types, then the blocks within the NSR20 wireframe were coded as NSR20 and 
finally the blocks within the SULPHIDE wireframe were coded as SULPHIDE.

GRADE INTERPOLATION 

Ni, Cu and Co grades were interpolated into blocks using Ordinary Kriging (OK) 
methods. The grades for Ni, Cu and Co were interpolated into blocks coded UM and NSR20 
using only composites in the ORELITHO and NSR20 wireframes. The grades for Ni, Cu and Co 
were interpolated into blocks coded SULPHIDE using only composites in the SULPHIDE 
wireframe. No composites from outside the UM Wireframe were used.  

All of the interpolations utilized Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation methods using 
Gemcom software. Interpolation was carried out in one pass. Table 17-17 describes the kriging 
parameters.

were slightly below the 3 year average at US$8.00/lb. for nickel, US$2.00/lb. for Cu and 
US$8.00/lb. for Co. No assumptions regarding recoveries were made. 

GMV cut-off values for Ror are based on the assumption that the deposit is of a potential 
size and nature to allow for possible open pit mining given the shallow depth and near surface 
location. The GMV cut-off value of  US$40/T was derived from a review of recent technical 
reports filed on SEDAR for similar deposit types. An example of the GMV calculation for Ror is 
shown in Table 17-18. 

Table 17-18 Ror Gross Metal Value Calculation 

GMV per Tonne = (Ni% x US$176.37) + (Cu% x US$44.09) + (Co% x US$176.37) 

The Ror block model contains 169,602 blocks coded as UM, 90,211 blocks coded as 
NSR20 and 15,590 blocks coded as SULPHIDE for a total of 275,403 blocks that could have had 
grades interpolated into them. There are 195,104 blocks within the wireframes that have grades 
interpolated and 80,299 blocks that are unassigned. Therefore about 71% of the blocks within the 
interpreted wireframes were assigned grades during the interpolation process. The result is a 
contiguous zone of interpolated blocks over most of the deposit with clusters of blocks around 
more widely spaced drillholes (Figure 17-21).

ROR RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

Mineral Resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by CIM as 
stipulated in NI 43-101. Under CIM/NI 43-101 guidelines, a Mineral Resource must have some 
potential for future mining. In order to justify classification of the deposit as a Mineral Resource, 
RCI evaluated the potential economics in terms of:  

the accountable/payable metals to determine a GMV; 

the ranges of cut-off grades and tonnage estimates from recent resource estimates 
filed on SEDAR for somewhat similar Ni-Cu deposits. 

The mineralisation and modelled wireframes for the deposit extend as deep as 650m 
below surface and grade values for the block model are interpolated to 360m below surface. RCI 
only reported the current resource for blocks from surface to 260m below surface as the potential 
for economically mining material below that elevation by means of an open pit were considered 
less robust. A preliminary economic assessment or reserve estimate would be needed to verify 
this assumption. 

The Ror Mineral Resource estimates are classified by RCI as Inferred. The most 
important factors influencing the classification was the inclusion of historical drillhole data that 
was not analysed using current industry-standard QA/QC methods and the absence of assaying 
over significant intervals of core. The historical data used does not seem to be biased based on 
limited twin hole results (see above) and there is no evidence to suggest that it should not be 
used. As the archived core for most of the historical drilling still exists, a program of assay 
verification and infill sampling could be instituted to upgrade the confidence in the old assaying 
and to determine grades of the unsampled portions of the deposit. The continuity of the 
mineralisation at low grade cut-offs is reasonably good. RCI cautions that neither a feasibility 
study nor a detailed preliminary economic assessment have been carried out for the Mineral 
Resources estimated  in this report and that they are not Mineral Reserves and they do not have 
demonstrated economic viability.  

MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION

Table 17-19 reports the results of the resource estimates at incremental cut-offs. The 
variations of the cut-off grade are shown to indicate the relative robustness of the estimate to 
changes in cut-off grade. However, this table is included only to demonstrate the sensitivity of 
the mineral resources to changes in cut-off grade and this table does not constitute the Mineral 
Resource estimate for the property.

RCI estimates that the Ror Mineral Resource, at a US$40 GMV cut-off, contains 
approximately 6.37 million tonnes of Inferred mineral resources grading 0.35 % Ni, 0.04% Cu 
and 0.01% Co (Table 17-2C and repeated here as Table 17-20).

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resource estimation and classification. 
2. Mineral Resources are estimated within a constraining wireframe and at a cut-off grade of $US40 GMV 
equivalent (shaded in grey in Table 17-19). 
3. The $US40 GMV cut-off includes all material in the wireframed envelopes. 
4. Bulk density is 3.00 t/m

.

5. Resources were estimated to a maximum depth of 260m below surface. 
6. The $US40 GMV cut-off is based on a review of reports for similar deposits filed on SEDAR in 2008. 
7. Metal Prices used were $2.00/lb copper, $8.00/lb nickel, $8.00/lb Co. 
8. No process recovery or refining was considered. 
9. Ni, Cu and Co grades that are lacking in drill holes have been composited at zero grades. 

RCI is not aware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues which might 
materially affect the mineral resources. 

VALIDATION  

RCI completed a detailed visual validation of the Ror block model.  The model was 
checked for proper coding and compositing of Ni, Cu and Co drillhole intervals, and block 
model cell values, in both section and plan. Coding and the geometry of the wireframe were 
found to be correct. Grade interpolation was examined relative to drill hole composite values for 
all metals and GMV values by inspecting sections and plans.  The checks showed good 
agreement between drill hole composite values and model cell values (Figure 17-22).  

In addition, grade interpolations using Inverse Distance (ID
2
) and Nearest Neighbour 

(NN) methods were done. These were compared to the OK model results and to the average 
composite results for the model and in all cases compared very well. The ID

2
method resulted in 

4% fewer tonnes and a Ni grade 5% higher than the OK estimate at a $40 GMV cutoff. The NN 
method resulted in 18% more tonnes and a Ni grade 18% higher than the OK estimate at a $40 
GMV cutoff. The higher tonnes and grade using the NN method is partly explained by the 
greater impact of high assays in otherwise unsampled core.

BLV has previously referenced historic and non NI 43-101 compliant resources in for 
Ror (e.g. BLV News Release #8-2008). These are: 

700K tonnes @ 0.76% Ni by Outokumpu; 

4.2M tonnes @ 0.61% Ni and 0.06% Cu including 665K tonnes @ 1.08% Ni and 
0.08% Cu quoted by the SGU. 

RCI did not examine the source documentation for previous estimates. There has been no 
underground development or previous mining, so no reconciliation studies or data are available 
for the Ror deposit. As such, estimated tonnages, grades and contained metal cannot be 
compared to actual production or to gauge the sensitivity of the grade estimate to drillhole 
density. RCI is not aware of any previous mining activity in the immediate area of the Ror 
resource.

MINERAL RESERVES and OTHER MATTERS 

BLV has not completed a mining prefeasibility or feasibility study and consequently 
there are no reserves reported for the Ror Property. The property is accessible by road. The 
infrastructure in the area is considered good. Mining methods would be determined after a 
preliminary assessment, prefeasibility or feasibility study and would depend on the success of 
future exploration. The resources reported here would likely be amenable to bulk mining (open 
pit) and processing would be likely done by conventional milling.  

RCI has not independently researched title, environmental or permitting regulations for 
Sweden; instead we have relied on information provided by BLV for matters relating to property

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1  Outstanding Issues 

To the author's knowledge, there are currently no known environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, or political issues that adversely affect the properties. 

18.2  Mining and Infrastructure 

The properties are accessible by road and within several km of power lines. The 
infrastructure in the area is considered good. Mining methods would be determined after a 
preliminary assessment, prefeasibility or feasibility study and would depend on the success of 
future exploration. The mining method would likely be using underground access for Lainejaur 
and Lappvattnet and by means of an open pit or by bulk underground mining for Ror. Processing 
would likely be done by conventional milling for all the properties.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  

Information from recent drilling by BLV and exploration efforts by predecessor 
companies on the properties hosting the Lainejaur, Lappvattnet and Ror deposits has been 
gathered over the last several years. These data have led to the delineation of Inferred Mineral 
Resources for Ni, Cu and Co as outlined in this report.

Significant mineralisation exists on all three properties. The presence of a past producing 
mine on the Lainejaur property and the development of an exploration shaft and drift to 120m 
below surface on the Lappvattnet property are examples of previous efforts to exploit and/or 
evaluate Ni-Cu-Co mineralisation. The Lainejaur and Lappvattnet deposits are higher grade and 
mineralisation occurs over narrower widths than that of Ror. The degree of continuity at the cut-
off grades used in this report is very good for all three deposits although the details of the 
geometry would be better defined with more tightly spaced drilling. 

RCI is of the opinion that continued definition and/or infill drilling would improve the 
confidence in the continuity and the geometry of mineralised zones for all the deposits. Infill 
drilling, additional drilling of the host ultramafic rocks and additional sampling of previously 
unsampled intervals of core from the ultramafic host rocks at Ror are all needed to further 
advance this property. In particular, the assignment of "0" values for unsampled intervals of core 
in the current estimate negatively impacts estimates. Sampling of previously unsampled archived 
core at Ror has the potential to increase the overall grade of the deposit but it is not possible to 
quantify what the impact, if any, might be at the cut-off grades used for the Mineral Resource 
estimate reported here. Additionally, RQD measurements and other geotechnical parameters 
should be recorded for all drillholes on all the properties. 

Check sampling of archived core from earlier drilling, using current QA/QC protocols, is 
needed if the results from that drilling are used to support Mineral Resource estimates classified 
at a higher degree of confidence than the current Inferred classification. 

Additional wide spaced drilling to fully define the extent of all the deposits along strike 
and to depth is warranted. No evaluation of other exploration targets has been done by RCI.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the results of exploration on the properties to date and the discovery of 
significant mineral deposits, Blackstone's Sweden properties are of sufficient merit to warrant 
further definition drilling and exploration. The initiation of work to prepare a Preliminary 
Assessment, or potentially upgraded Mineral Resource estimates to support Mineral Reserves, 
should await results from recommended work listed below. Additional exploration elsewhere on 
the properties is warranted, but no evaluation of the amount or type of work or potential 
exploration costs for such work have been done as part of this report. RCI recommends that 5% 
of all samples taken by BLV be submitted to a second laboratory for check assaying, with blanks 
and standards inserted into the sample stream as part of the QA/QC program. Finally, RCI 
recommends the following work program to further define the resources presented in this report:  

Lainejaur:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data; 

undertake 5,000m of infill drilling on closer centres to better define the geometry of the 
mineralised zones in order to upgrade the confidence in Mineral Resources. 

Lappvattnet:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data; 

re-sample all archived core intervals from previous operators that contribute or are 
adjacent to, or on strike or up or down dip of intervals that contribute to the Mineral 
Resources;

undertake 5,000m of infill drilling on closer centres to better define the geometry of the 
mineralised zones in order to upgrade the confidence in Mineral Resources. 

Ror:

initiate metallurgical test work on the mineralisation (200m HQ or PQ core); 

undertake a survey to obtain baseline environmental data; 

continued deposit definition and step out exploration drilling totalling 10,000 metres; 

re-sample a representative portion of archived and previously sampled core from historic 
drilling, and that contributes to the Mineral Resources, to determine if the historic 
assaying is suitable to support higher confidence Mineral Resource estimates. Standard 
industry practice QA/QC protocols need to be observed as part of this work; 

sample all previously unsampled core that is within the UM Wireframe (approximately 
7,000m).
