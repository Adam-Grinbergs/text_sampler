1.0 SUMMARY 
 
ECU Silver Mining Inc. (ECU) and Golden Tag Resources Ltd. (Golden Tag) have retained 
Micon International Limited (Micon) to provide direction for, and conduct a review of, their 
updated resource estimate in order to provide an independent Technical Report for the San 
Diego project.  This Technical Report constitutes an update of the December 7, 2007 mineral 
resource estimate conducted on the property by ECU and Ms. Kateri Marchand, Vice 
President of Exploration for Golden Tag.  The review and audit was performed to ensure that 
the resource estimate complies with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM) standards and definitions referred to in Canadian National Instrument 43-
101 (NI 43-101) with the current mineral resource effective December 6, 2008. 
 
The San Diego property is located in the Velardeña mining district, within the municipality 
of Cuencamé, in the northeast quadrant of the State of Durango, Mexico.  The property is 
situated approximately 75 km southwest of the city of Torreón in the State of Coahuila and 
160 km northeast of the city of Durango, capital of the State of Durango.  The property is 
located 9 km northeast of ECU's Velardeña property. 
 
ECU advises that it holds the San Diego property through its 100% owned Mexican 
subsidiary Minera William S.A. de C.V. (Minera William).  At present, the property is 
comprised of 4 mineral concessions.  The mineral concessions are all contiguous and vary in 
size, for a total property area of 91.65 ha.  The annual 2008 concession tax for the San Diego 
property is approximately US $1,421.  As the San Diego property is less than 1,000 ha in 
size, no annual work commitments are required as explained in article 69, within the last 
paragraph of the Ley Mineral published in the Diario Oficial of February 15, 1999 by the 
Secretaria de Economía (formerly the Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial). 
 
On November 2, 2005, ECU and Golden Tag entered into a joint venture agreement whereby 
Golden Tag could earn a 50% interest in the San Diego property by incurring a total of 
US $1.5 million in exploration expenses in increments of US $500,000 per year over three 
years.  As of November, 2007, Golden Tag had incurred expenses on the property totalling 
US $1.629 million and has met its obligations under the joint venture agreement. 
 
Subsequent to the earn-in period, Golden Tag and ECU have joint ventured exploration and 
development of the property and are paying for their proportionate share of expenditures.  
Golden Tag had incurred total expenses of US $2.355 million (unaudited) as of November 
30, 2008.  For its part, ECU, which is the operator of the project, has incurred total expenses 
of US $968,340 (unaudited) over the same period to November 30, 2008. 
 
Mineral concessions can only be held by Mexican nationals or Mexican incorporated 
companies, but there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of such companies.  In Mexico, 
mineral concessions are valid for 50 years and are extendable provided that the application is 
made within the five-year period prior to the expiry of the concession and the bi-annual fee 
and work requirements are in good standing.

Mining has played an important role in Mexico since pre-historic times, but it entered a 
period of rapid expansion after the Spanish conquest when rich mineral deposits were found.  
The wealth found in these early mines served as an incentive for the early colonizers to locate 
to more remote and poorly accessible portions of the county. 
 
It is not known if the indigenous peoples or the Spanish colonists first began mining in the 
Velardeña district but exploration and mining extend back to at least the late 1500's or early 
1600's.  The mines were first worked by the Spanish with the high-grade ore mined by hand 
and processed on a small scale by direct smelting. 
 
During the late sixteenth century silver production accounted for 80% of all exports from 
Nueva España (New Spain), although, by the mid-seventeenth century silver production 
collapsed when mercury, necessary to the refining process, was diverted to the silver mines 
of Potosí in present day Bolivia.  Collapse of the seventeenth century mining led to 
widespread bankruptcy among the miners and hacienda owners; however, in the latter half of 
the seventeenth century silver mining began to recover in Nueva España. 
 
The peasant uprisings of 1810 to 1821 were disastrous to the Mexican mining industry with 
both the insurgents' soldiers and royalist troops all but destroying the mining production in 
Mexico, and the Velardeña mining district was not spared during this period. 
 
Records for the remainder of the nineteenth century are sporadic and it is only in the later 
part of the century that mining appears to have made a comeback in the district.  The records 
for the late nineteenth century and the twentieth century are more complete with mining 
occurring continuously in the district for most of the time but again with sporadic production 
due to periods of low commodity prices which rendered the mines uneconomic at times. 
 
The Velardeña district is located at the easternmost limit of the Sierra Madre Occidental, on 
the boundary between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Mesa Central sub-provinces.  Both 
of these terranes are underlain by Paleozoic and possibly Precambrian basement rocks.  Most 
of Mexico's high-grade silver mines are located in the Mesa Central, near this contact. 
 
The regional geology is characterized by a thick sequence of limestones and minor 
calcareous clastic sediments of Cretaceous age, intruded by Tertiary plutons of acidic to 
intermediate composition.  During the Laramide Orogeny, the sediments were folded into 
symmetrical anticlines and synclines that were modified into a series of asymmetrical 
overturned folds by a later stage of compression.  This event also buckled the stratigraphy 
about a southwest striking, vertically dipping hinge-line around the village of Velardeña. 
 
A series of younger Tertiary stocks have intruded the older Cretaceous limestones over a 
distance of approximately 15 km along a northeast to southwest trend coinciding with the 
hinge-line mentioned above.  These late geological events further contributed to the shaping 
of the typical basin and range tectonic setting of the area.  The intrusive bodies range from a 
more mafic dioritic composition in the northeast, to a more felsic alaskite in the southwest.  
Local developments of exoskarn, endoskarn, hornfels and marble occur associated with the 
intrusive rocks. The various mineral deposits of the Velardeña mining district occur along the 



 

 3

northeast-southwest axis and are spatially associated with the intrusions and their related 
alteration. 
 
The San Diego project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous limestone intruded 
by a differentiated Tertiary diorite stock with related dykes and sills. In this region of 
northern Mexico, mineralization typically consists of narrow but extensive high-grade 
polymetallic calcite-quartz veins bearing silver, lead and zinc with lesser gold and copper.  
Mineralization exhibits evidence of episodic hydrothermal events which generated finely 
banded textures.  High grade mineralization in the district is commonly associated with 
multiple phases of banding and brecciation. Sulphide mineralization consists predominantly 
of pyrite, sphalerite and galena with sulphosalts.  Other sulphide mineral such as 
chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, stibnite and arsenopyrite are occasionally present.  Mineralized 
veins and stringers cut all rock types and are encountered within limestone, intrusive and 
skarn host rocks. 
 
Micon has conducted a review and audit of the ECU and Golden Tag resource estimate for 
the San Diego property.  Micon considers the resource estimates, compiled by ECU and 
Golden Tag, to have been reasonably prepared and to conform to the current CIM standards 
and definitions for estimating resources as required under NI 43-101 "Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects."  Therefore, Micon accepts ECU's and Golden Tag's 
resource estimate as the basis for the ongoing exploration at the San Diego project.  
However, the reader should be cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves 
do not have demonstrated economic viability 
 
The parameters used to determine the cut-off grades are based on the economical criteria 
presented below which were then used to determine which mineralized blocks could be 
included in the resource estimate.  Blocks below the cut-off grades were reviewed and were 
occasionally used in the estimate to preserve continuity.  The lead and zinc mineralization for 
those blocks located within the oxide portion of the veins was not taken into account in the 
estimation of the silver equivalent cut-off.  Blocks which were not included in the current 
estimate may be included in future estimates should the economical and/or metallurgical 
criteria change sufficiently to warrant a review of the cut-off grades.  Criteria used for the 
cut-off grade determinations include the commodity prices and operating costs established by 
ECU, and recoveries for gold, silver, lead and zinc also determined by ECU from its 
Velardeña operation.  Table 1.1 summarizes the parameters for the resource estimate.

*Recovery includes allowances for both mill recovery and smelter terms. 

 
The following cut-offs were used for the mineral resource estimate at the San Diego project: 
 

• Cut-off for narrow vein mining is set at 155 g/t silver. 
• Cut-off for bulk mining is established at 86 g/t silver. 

 
Micon's review and audit of the ECU and Golden Tag resource estimates is contained in 
Table 1.3 for Indicated Resources and Table 1.4 for Inferred Resources. 
 
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
There are no mineral reserves presently identified on the San Diego property.

For the San Diego project ECU and Golden Tag have currently developed an indicated 
mineral resource of 371,000 tonnes containing 2.9 million ounces of silver, 4,000 ounces of 
gold, 14.7 million pounds of lead and 10.8 million pounds of zinc, with an inferred resource 
of 21.6  million tonnes containing 76.5 million ounces of silver, 93,000 ounces of gold, 867 
million pounds of lead and 1.047 million pounds of zinc.  Based on the gold, silver, lead and 
zinc content, this equates to an indicated resource of 4.2 million ounces of silver equivalent 
with an inferred resource of 214 million ounces of silver equivalent. 
 
The stated resources are not materially affected by any known environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues, unless 
stated in this report, to the best knowledge of the authors.  There are no known mining, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, or other factors that materially affect this mineral resource 
estimate, at this time. 
 
In addition to the previously stated mineral resource estimate, the San Diego property has 
further mineral potential since the true extent of the mineralization within the veins, vein 
packages and skarn has not been fully identified.  An attempt has been made to conceptualize 
the possible extent of the mineral potential on the San Diego project.  However, since the 
mineral potential cannot be estimated to the same accuracy as a mineral resource it must be 
stated as a range of figures.  To estimate the range for grades, a factor of minus 10% was 
applied for the downside potential and of plus 10% for the upside potential.  
 
The minimum and maximum potential estimated at the San Diego project is based solely on 
the possible extension at depth of the mineralization as shown on the long sections produced 
for each of the veins and/or zones.  Potential was estimated for 10 of the 13 mineralized 
structures currently identified with no potential calculated for the Arroyo, El Jal and SD 
veins.  The possibility that additional veins and/or zones may be discovered at the San Diego 
project is very strong.  Previous drilling campaigns have demonstrated the existence of a 
number of hidden veins and/or zones which do not have a surface expression and are only 
discovered through a sustained exploration effort. 
 
The following criteria were used to determine the mineral potential for the San Diego project: 
 

1) The lateral extent for both the minimum and maximum mineral potential was limited 
to the known lateral extent established from the inferred resource blocks.  

 
2) The maximum dip extension of the mineral potential was set at 400 m, based on the 

known mined height of the major vein systems, unless the property boundary or a 
geological feature such as a fault was encountered, whereupon the dip extent was 
limited to that distance. 

 
3) The minimum dip extension of the mineral potential was estimated by extending 

vertically at depth for 200 m, unless the property boundary or a geological feature 
such as a fault was encountered, whereupon the dip extent was limited to that 
distance.

The reader is cautioned that the mineral potential of the San Diego property is conceptual in 
nature and there has been insufficient exploration conducted within the property to define a 
mineral resource for these areas.  It is also uncertain if further exploration will result in 
targets being delineated as mineral resources. 
 
Micon believes that the land package within the San Diego project is highly prospective both 
along strike and down dip of the existing mineralization and that further resources could be 
discovered with additional exploration and development. 
 
In order to continue to build on the success of their 2007 to 2008 drilling program ECU and 
Golden Tag initiated a fourth phase of diamond drilling on September 2, 2008.  This phase of 
drilling remains underway at the time of writing this report.  So far in this campaign, two 
deep holes (SD-08-34 and 08-35) and the wedging of a previous hole (SD-07-21A) have 
been completed for a total of 2,722.10 m of HQ and NQ drilling.  Drilling is being conducted 
using a truck-mounted CS-1500 hydraulic drill designed for deep drilling that is owned and 
operated by Layne de Mexico. 
 
Like the previously completed programs, the 2008 to 2009 drilling campaign currently 
underway on the San Diego project is proving to be successful.  The information gathered by 
this program so far has confirmed the: 
 

• Potential for carbonate as well as skarn replacement-type sulphide mineralization 
capable of generating broad lenses of massive mineralization. 

 
• General trend of increasing skarn and marble alteration at depth along with a change 

of deformation style from brittle to ductile, and improving metal grades and widths at 
depth. 

 
• Mylonitic shear zones intersected at depth as being favourable host to both base and 

precious metal mineralization including gold. 
 
• Presence of a new mineralized skarn environment to the south-southeast of the 

property  associated with polymetallic stringer-style and disseminated sulphide 
mineralization 

 
• Broad hornfel alteration aureole which is related to the newly identified skarn 



 

 7

environment that affects all units whether it is the skarns, the intrusives or the 
limestone. 

 
• Mineralization at the San Diego property occurs in a variety of settings that include: 

 
1) High grade narrow vein-type occurrences. 
 
2) Carbonate and skarn replacement (manto-type) sulphide zones. 
 
3) Wide structurally controlled corridors of sulphide stringers and veins with some 

skarn replacement. 
 
4) Breccia zones either formed due to faulting or as epithermal chimney pipes. 

 
The 2007 to 2008 drill program represented a total exploration expenditure of US $1,722,658 
as of July 31, 2008.  The follow-up drilling program which entails 5,000 m of drilling and 
expenditures of approximately US $1,215,500 commenced on September 2, 2008.  The 
exploration expenditures for the 2008 to 2009 program as of November 30, 2008 stand at US 
$664,143. 
 
Micon has reviewed ECU's and Golden Tag's proposal for further exploration on the San 
Diego property.  Micon recommends that they conduct the exploration program as proposed 
subject to either funding and other matters which may cause the proposed exploration 
program to be altered in the normal course business activities or alterations which may affect 
the program as a result of exploration activities themselves. 
 
Through their exploration of the San Diego project, ECU and Golden Tag are continuing to 
identify the extent of the mineralization and as a result have expanded the mineral resource 
base for the property.  Micon has audited and accepted the current resource estimate for the 
project and makes the following additional recommendations: 

 
1) Micon recommends that ECU and Golden Tag conduct further specific gravity testing 

to define the specific gravity for each vein or family of veins to a greater degree.  This 
testwork should be conducted in order to further define the specific gravity of the 
different veins and zones for inclusion in the next resource estimate. 

 
2) Micon recommends that ECU and Golden Tag compile a comprehensive Quality 

Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures report for inclusion in future 
technical reports as an appendix.  The write-up should be complete and cover 
everything from the start of the exploration program to the completion of the program 
including site cleanup.  Included in the report should be procedures covering surface 
and underground sampling, setting up of the drill rigs, drillsite cleanup, logging, core 
sampling, assaying and the use of standard, blank and duplicate samples in the 
program.

3) Micon recommends that when ECU and Golden Tag initiate further drilling programs 
at the San Diego project they log the drill holes to production and geotechnical 
standards rather than exploration standards.  Factors such as the rock quality 
designation/designator, fracture/fault patterns and major fault or gouge zones should 
be noted and entered into the computer database to assist in future assessment of the 
mineability of the veins. 

 
4) Micon recommends that representative samples of the mineralized material from the 

various veins and zones be sent out for metallurgical and mineralogical testwork and 
that the results of this work be included in the next resource estimate. 

 
ECU and Golden Tag have been conducting exploration drilling on the San Diego property 
which has had some historical mining conducted on the various mineralized veins.  In the 
case of the San Diego project, although a number of mineralized areas have seen limited 
exploitation in the past, the veins on the property remain open in both their lateral and down 
dip projections.  Both companies have been applying modern exploration concepts and 
techniques as well as conducting the first ever drilling programs on the San Diego property.  
As a result, of ECU's and Golden Tag's efforts the joint venture has been able to build upon 
the initial December, 2007 mineral resource estimate and is beginning to determine the extent 
of the mineralization on the mineral concessions. 
 
The resources reported herein by ECU and Golden Tag for the San Diego project were 
reviewed and accepted by Micon as constituting the basis for further exploration of the 
property.  It is Micon's opinion that the resources for the San Diego project conform to the 
current CIM standards and definitions for estimating resources as required under NI 43-101 
regulations. 
 
At this time the exploration potential largely remains unknown due to the limited amount of 
work which has been conducted on the property.  However, assuming that the geological 
controls observed at the San Diego property are similar in size and grade to the other 
mineralized veins and deposits within the Velardeña mining district, there is every reason to 
believe that the area of potential mineralization at the San Diego project is large. 
 
In summary, Micon considers that the proposed program for further exploration on the San 
Diego project by ECU and Golden Tag is both warranted and justified as the potential for the 
discovery of additional resources is good.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
At the request of Mr. Stephen Altmann, President, Mr. Michel Roy, Chief Executive Officer 
of ECU Silver Mining Inc. (ECU), and Mr. Marc Carrier, President and Chief Financial 
Officer and Mr. David Rigg, Chief Executive Officer of Golden Tag Resources Ltd. (Golden 
Tag), Micon International Limited (Micon) has been retained to provide direction for, 
conduct a review of, and audit the updated resource estimate in order to provide an 
independent Technical Report for the San Diego project, located in the Velardeña mining 
district in the northern portion of the State of Durango in Mexico.  This Technical Report 
constitutes a review of the December, 2008 mineral resource estimate conducted on the 
property by ECU and Kateri Marchand, Vice President of Exploration for Golden Tag, who 
acts as the Project Manager.  The review and audit were performed to ensure that the 
resource estimate complies with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
(CIM) standards and definitions referred to in Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-
101). 
 
The geological setting of the property, mineralization style and occurrences, and exploration 
history were described in reports that were prepared by Micon (2008, 2006), Roscoe Postle 
and Associates Inc. (RPA, 2005), Broad Oak Associates (Broad Oak, 2006) and in various 
government and other publications listed in Section 21 "References".  The relevant sections 
of those reports are reproduced herein. 
 
The updated resource estimate includes results from a follow-up surface diamond drilling 
program, totalling 6,654 m of NQ and BQ drilling, completed by ECU and Golden Tag 
between October, 2007 and March, 2008.  The resource estimate also includes results from 
diamond drill holes SD-07-21A, SD-08-34 and partial results from SD-08-35 from the 
surface drilling program initiated on September 2, 2008.  The drilling program is ongoing 
and at time of the resource estimate totalled 2,722 m of HQ and NQ drilling. The exploration 
program and diamond drilling are discussed in detail in Section 10 and Section 11 of this 
report. 
 
All currency amounts are stated in US dollars or Mexican pesos, as specified, with costs and 
commodity prices typically expressed in US dollars.  Quantities are generally stated in metric 
(SI) units, the standard Canadian and international practice, including metric tons (tonnes, t) 
and kilograms (kg) for weight, kilometres (km) or metres (m) for distance, hectares (ha) for 
area, grams (g) and grams per metric tonne (g/t) for gold and silver grades (g/t Au, g/t Ag).  
Wherever applicable, any Imperial units of measure encountered have been converted to 
Système International d'Unités (SI) units for reporting consistency.  Precious metal grades 
may be expressed in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) and their quantities 
may also be reported in troy ounces (ounces, oz), a common practice in the mining industry.

In conjunction with the current report, Micon visited the ECU offices from September 22 to 
27, 2008 to undertake preliminary discussions and provide direction for the updated mineral 
resource estimate, and again between November 17 and 20, 2008 to undertake a review of 
the data and interpretations for the updated resource estimate.  Micon was assisted during the 
visits by a number of employees and consultants working for ECU including Stephen 
Altmann, President of ECU, Michel Roy, Chief Executive Officer of ECU, Ing. Joaquin 
Rodriguez Lugo, Vice President of Exploration for ECU and Kateri Marchand.  The current 
report is an update of Micon's previous San Diego Technical Report dated January 20, 2008 
which is filed on SEDAR. 
 
The review of the San Diego project was based on published material researched by Micon, 
as well as data, professional opinions and unpublished material submitted by the professional 
staff of ECU or its consultants.  Much of the data came from reports prepared and provided 
by ECU or its Mexican subsidiary, Minera William S.A. de C.V. (Minera William).  The 
review of the resource estimation parameters was conducted during the visit to the ECU 
offices located in Torreón, in November, 2008.  Further review of the resource parameters 
and a review of the resource estimates were undertaken in December, 2008 upon completion 
of the estimates by ECU with the assistance of Ms. Kateri Marchand. 
 
Micon is pleased to acknowledge the helpful cooperation of ECU's management and 
personnel, all of whom made any and all data requested available and responded openly and 
helpfully to all questions, queries and requests for material. 
 
The Qualified Persons responsible for the preparation of this report and the review of the 
resource estimate on the San Diego project are Mr. William J. Lewis, B.Sc., P.Geo., a senior 
geologist with Micon in Toronto, and Ms. Kateri Marchand, P.Geo., a geological consultant 
based in Montreal who is also the Vice President of Exploration for Golden Tag. 
 
Mr. Lewis provided direction for, and conducted the review of the updated resource estimate 
and assisted in the preparation of this report.  Ms. Kateri Marchand oversaw the planning and 
execution of the exploration drilling programs and completed the geological interpretation of 
the various mineralized zones included in the resource estimate for the San Diego project.  
Both authors are Qualified Persons as defined under NI 43-101 regulations. 
 
Micon does not have nor has had previously any material interest in ECU, Golden Tag or 
related entities or interests.  Micon's relationship with ECU and Golden Tag is solely a 
professional association between the clients and the independent consultant.  This report is 
prepared in return for fees based upon agreed commercial rates and the payment of these fees 
is in no way contingent on the results of this report.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
Micon has reviewed and analyzed data provided by ECU and Golden Tag, their consultants 
and previous operators of the property, and has drawn its own conclusions therefrom, 
augmented by its direct field examination.  Micon has not carried out any independent 
exploration work, drilled any holes or carried out any sampling or assaying on the property.  
 
Micon briefly reviewed the results of previously published audits of the resource estimates 
completed by prior consultants RPA (2005) and Broad Oak (2006) for ECU for the San 
Diego project.  Both the 2005 and 2006 resource estimates were superseded by a mineral 
resource estimate which was completed by Kateri Marchand in December 7, 2007 and 
audited by Micon.  This resource estimate was discussed in an NI 43-101 Technical Report 
entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report, Review of the Mineral Resource Estimate for the San 
Diego Project, Velardeña Mining District, Durango State, Mexico" and dated January 20, 
2008.  The December, 2008 resource estimate for the San Diego property is an update of the 
previous December, 2007 resource estimate and is the second estimate to be reviewed and 
audited by Micon.  The December, 2008 estimate conforms to presently accepted industry 
standards and definitions for resource estimates and is compliant with the CIM definitions 
required by NI 43-101 and, therefore, is reportable as a mineral resource by ECU and Golden 
Tag. 
 
While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, Micon has 
relied upon ECU's and Golden Tag's presentation of the project data from previous operators 
for the San Diego project in formulating its opinion. 
 
Micon has not reviewed any of the documents or agreements under which ECU and Golden 
Tag hold title to the San Diego project or the underlying mineral concessions and Micon 
offers no legal opinion as to the validity of the mineral titles claimed.  A description of the 
properties, and ownership thereof, is provided for general information purposes only.  The 
existing environmental conditions, liabilities and remediation have been described where 
required by NI 43-101 regulations.  These statements also are provided for information 
purposes only and Micon offers no opinion in this regard. 
 
The descriptions of geology, mineralization and exploration are taken from reports prepared 
by various companies or their contracted consultants.  The conclusions of this report rely on 
data available in published and unpublished reports and information supplied by the various 
companies which have conducted exploration on the property, and information supplied by 
ECU and Golden Tag.  The information provided to ECU and Golden Tag was supplied by 
reputable companies and from government sources and Micon has no reason to doubt its 
validity. 
 
The maps and tables for this report were reproduced or derived from reports written for ECU 
and the majority of the photographs were taken by Kateri Marchand while overseeing the 
exploration programs on the San Diego property.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The San Diego property is part of group of three properties held by ECU within the 
Velardeña mining district. The other two properties are the Velardeña property and the 
Chicago property which collectively represent the Velardeña district properties. 
 
The San Diego property is located in the Velardeña mining district, within the municipality 
of Cuencamé, in the northeast quadrant of the State of Durango, Mexico.  The property is 
situated approximately 75 km southwest of the city of Torreón in the State of Coahuila and 
160 km northeast of the city of Durango, capital of the State of Durango.  The property is 
located 9 km northeast of the ECU's Velardeña property.  The location of the property is 
shown in Figure 4.1. 
 
The San Diego property is approximately centred at Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 
grid co-ordinates 2777100 N and 638800 E based on WGS84. 
 
The property contains the historical La Cruz-La Rata and El Trovador mines as well as a 
number of other shallower shafts which were sunk on narrower veins such as the 
Cantarranas, Montanez and El Jal. 
 
The Velardeña mining district is a historical mining district and although there are only a 
small number of mines operating in the district today, there is considerable mining 
experience available in the area. 
 
ECU advises that it holds the San Diego property project through its 100% owned Mexican 
subsidiary Minera William S.A. de C.V. (Minera William).  At present, the property is 
comprised of 4 mineral concessions.  See Figure 4.2 for a map showing the location of the 
mineral concessions for the San Diego project and Figure 4.3 for a map showing the actual 
mineral concessions.  Table 4.1 summarizes the relevant information regarding the individual 
concessions.  The mineral concessions are all contiguous and vary in size, for a total property 
area of 91.65 ha.  The annual 2008 concession tax for the San Diego property is 
approximately US $1,421. 
 
Mineral concessions can only be held by Mexican nationals or Mexican incorporated 
companies, but there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of such companies.  To stake a 
concession, a principal monument must be erected, painted with the applicable information, 
photographed and then the concession is applied for at the assigned Public Registry of 
Mining for that district.  Once accepted an official surveyor must be contracted to provide a 
survey to locate the concession, following which the official survey is reviewed and accepted 
by the assigned State Public Registry of Mining.  The application for the mineral concession 
is then sent to Mexico City where it is further reviewed and where a title to the mineral 
concession is granted.

In Mexico, mineral concessions are valid for 50 years and are extendable provided that the 
application is made within the five-year period prior to the expiry of the concession and the 
bi-annual fee and work requirements are in good standing.  All concessions must have their 
boundaries orientated astronomically north-south and east-west and the lengths of the sides 
must be one hundred metres or multiples thereof, except where these conditions cannot be 
satisfied because they border on other mineral concessions.  The locations of the concessions 
are determined on the basis of a fixed point on the land, called the starting point, which is 
either linked to the perimeter of the concession or located thereupon.  Prior to being granted a 
concession the company must present a topographic survey to the Dirección General de 
Minas (DGM) within 60 days of staking.  Once this is completed the DGM will usually grant 
the concession.  The exploitation concessions which comprise the San Diego project are 
surveyed but do not have their boundaries orientated astronomically north-south and east-
west because the concessions predate the introduction of this legislation. 
 
Prior to December 21, 2005, exploration concessions were granted for a period of 6 years in 
Mexico and at the end of the 6 years they could be converted to exploitation concessions.  
However, as of December 21, 2005 (by means of an amendment made on April 28, 2005 to 
the Mexican mining law) there is only one type of mining concession.  Therefore, as of the 
date of the amendment, there is no distinction between exploration and exploitation 
concessions on all new titles granted.  All concessions are now granted for a 50 year period 
provided the concessions are kept in good standing.  For the concessions to remain in good 
standing a bi-annual fee must be paid to the Mexican government and a report must be filed 
in May of each year which covers the work accomplished on the property between January 
and December of the preceding year. 
 
In order to begin an exploration program on a concession upon which no substantial mining 
has been conducted, ECU and Golden Tag would be required to file a "Notice of Initiation of 
Exploration Activities" with the local authorities to inform them of the scope and 
environmental impact of the exploration work.  Also, other permits, such as a permit to use 
the local municipal garbage dump, may be required. 
 
The surface rights are owned by either private persons or Ejidos (rural co-operative 
communities).  Typically, a verbal authorization with no consideration is granted for 
prospecting and sample gathering and a simple letter agreement or contract will be used for 
drilling, trenching, basic road building and similar more advanced exploration activities.  A 
small monetary consideration and/or the obligation to fix a road or fence, build an earth dam, 
paint the local town church or school, etc. is usually required to perform any extensive work 
programs and the landholders must also be compensated should the land be required for 
development. 
 
On December 24, 1997, ECU Gold Mining Inc. (the predecessor company of ECU) acquired 
93.48% of the capital stock (the remaining 6.52% was later transferred to ECU) of BLM 
Minera Mexicana, S.A. de C. V. (BLM Minera), the registered holder of the mineral 
concessions associated with the Velardeña, San Diego and Chicago properties.  ECU also 
acquired, as part of the same transaction, all of the capital stock of Minera William, an

exploration and mining contracting company. BLM Minera and Minera William were 
purchased from William Resources Inc. (William Resources) with the issuance of 6,000,000 
shares of ECU, as well as a 30% net profits interest (NPI) royalty.  The NPI had a maximum 
limit of CDN $12,000,000, whereupon this royalty converted to a 2% net smelter return 
(NSR) royalty.  This royalty was purchased and extinguished in September, 2004 for a 
purchase price of CDN $6,670,000.  Of the 6,000,000 ECU shares in escrow, 2.25 million 
were released in November, 2004 with the remainder of the shares released at the rate of 1.25 
million per year.  The last 1.25 million block of shares was released on November 9, 2007. 
 
The original vendor for 20 of the mineral concessions was a consortium of individuals 
headed by Alejandro Gaitan Cortez of Torreón (the Gaitan Group).  William Resources 
purchased the properties in the Velardeña district from the Gaitan Group in 1995, by way of 
a royalty and US $1.1 million in cash.  The royalty extended for a period of five years and 
consisted of a US $8 per tonne payment for every tonne mined which had a value in excess 
of US $60.  On February 25, 1997, Mr. Gaitan initiated a lawsuit against BLM Minera 
alleging non-payment of royalties for the period from May, 1996 to July, 1997.  ECU 
assumed the responsibilities of William Resources with respect to the royalty but William 
Resources had provided warranties regarding the royalties owed prior to the purchase of 
BLM Minera by ECU.  After several legal appeals, the Supreme Court issued a final decision 
in the fall of 2000, stating that BLM Minera must pay US $520,000, plus interest relating to 
the royalties claimed.  In May, 2000, Mr. Gaitan signed a letter of intent with BLM Minera 
regarding past due payments and future terms, but repudiated this letter in June, 2000.  BLM 
Minera paid the amount owing as determined by the courts in 2001.  Mr. Gaitan also 
demanded an additional US $2 million for royalties due for the period July, 1997 to 
September, 2000.  In December, 2000, Mr. Gaitan demanded that the original sale agreement 
be annulled. 
 
As part of the acquisition by ECU in 1997, 6 additional mineral concessions had been 
acquired with no restrictions or royalties due.  These concessions belonged to William 
Resources and were never subjected to legal dispute. 
 
In November, 2004, ECU announced a settlement with respect to the outstanding litigations 
with Mr. Gaitan.  ECU entered into a lease which provided for a payment of US $1 million 
by December 11, 2004 (completed) and an initial royalty of US $2 per tonne subject to a 
monthly minimum of US $25,000 (paid every month since until August, 2007) based on the 
price of gold and silver, currently set at prices of US $431/oz of gold and US $7.445/oz of 
silver.  ECU had an option until November 8, 2008, to purchase the properties for US $15 
million (the Gaitan Option).  The option covers 18 of the mineral concessions which form a 
portion of the original acquisition.  After exercising the option, ECU's ownership became 
100% on 14 of the mineral concessions and 70% on the four remaining concessions. 
 
Also under the Gaitan option agreement, William Resources had the right to operate the 
mines until November, 2009, renewable for an additional 5 years until 2014.  Under the 
agreement, Gaitan retained the rights to 2 of the original 20 concessions that were deemed 



 

 20

less important to William Resources as they were adjacent to the Chicago structure south of 
the main group of concessions. 
 
In December, 2006, Procesadora de Minerales de Durango S.A. de C.V. (Procesadora), a 
company incorporated in Mexico, purchased the mineral concessions and acquired all the 
rights related to the agreement signed in 2004 between Mr. Gaitan and ECU, including the 
Gaitan option, from the Gaitan Group. 
 
In September, 2007, ECU exercised the Gaitan option to acquire, through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Minera William, ownership and title of all the concessions being part of the 2004 
agreement with the Gaitan Group, from the new owner, Procesadora. 
 
ECU exercised the option for a payment of US $4,500,000 and the issuance of 4,790,000 
units.  The number of units issued was based on an agreed price per unit of CDN $2.30.  
Each unit is comprised of one ECU common share and one-half of one common share 
purchase warrant.  Each full warrant entitles its holder to acquire one common share at a 
price of CDN $2.85 at any time on or before June 4, 2009.  However, if the closing price of 
the common shares is equal to, or greater than, CDN $3.75 for a period of 20 consecutive 
trading days any time after October 5, 2007, ECU may give notice to the holders of the 
warrants and thereby accelerate the expiry date of the warrants to the 30th day following the 
date on which such notice is given. 
 
With the exercise of the option, ECU obtained complete ownership and title to the Velardeña, 
San Diego and Chicago concessions and is no longer required to make royalty payments 
pursuant to the option agreement.  In addition, ECU is no longer limited to a fixed term 
whereby it had the right to mine the mineral resources up until 2014 only. 
 
Additionally, in September, 2007, ECU acquired the 2 mineral concessions which were part 
of the original 1997 agreement but had been kept by Gaitan when the settlement was reached 
in December, 2004.  The concessions were subject to an outright purchase comprised of a 
cash settlement containing no other obligations. 
 
In late 2004, ECU purchased an interest in a flotation mill located in the town of Velardeña 
to treat all the sulphide production from the property.  Since then ECU has increased its 
ownership interest in the holding company, Minera Labri S.A. de C.V., (Minera Labri) to 
100%. 
 
On November 2, 2005, ECU and Golden Tag entered in a joint venture agreement whereby 
Golden Tag may earn a 50% interest in the San Diego property by incurring a total of 
US $1.5 million in exploration expenses in increments of US $500,000 per year over three 
years.  As of November, 2007, Golden Tag had incurred expenses on the property totalling 
US $1.629 million and has met the obligations under the joint venture agreement.  ECU 
continues to be the operator of the project.  Golden Tag and ECU have joint ventured 
exploration and development of the property and are paying for their proportionate share of 
expenditures. As of November 30, 2008, Golden Tag had incurred total expenses of 



 

 21

US $2.355 million (unaudited) on the San Diego property.  In 2007, ECU Silver's share of 
the exploration costs net of management fees paid by the joint venture partner was 
CDN $40,267.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2008, ECU had incurred 
exploration expenditures of CDN $468,850 for total expenditures to date of CDN $509,117. 
 
In 2008, Golden Tag proceeded with the creation of a fully owned Mexican subsidiary 
registered under the name of Golden Tag S.A. de C.V. and has its offices in Mexico City. 
 
The project area is part of the San Diego Ejido and up to this point there has been no written 
agreement signed between ECU and the local Ejido, which owns the surface rights.  The 
common understanding between the two parties at this stage, where only exploration work is 
being performed, is to provide assistance on an informal basis to the village of San Diego de 
Arriba (population 15) for items such as drinking water and occasional employment.  When 
and if exploitation is initiated, the parties will draft a formal surface use contract similar to 
the one ECU has with the Velardeña Ejido, which will be registered at the Registro Agrario 
Nacional, Delegación in Durango. 
 
As the San Diego property is less than 1,000 ha in size, no annual work commitments are 
required as explained in article 69, within the last paragraph of the Ley Mineral published in 
the Diario Oficial of February 15, 1999 by the Secretaria de Economía (formerly the 
Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial). 
 
ECU has all of the required permits to operate the Velardeña mines and the mill.  These 
permits include an explosive use permit (from the Secretaria de Defensa Nacional) renewable 
each year, land uses permit (ocupación temporal" agreement with the Ejido Velardeña) and a 
water use permit (Comision Nacional del Agua). 
 
ECU and Golden Tag have all necessary permits to conduct exploration activities at San 
Diego, which include the environmental permits from the Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y 
Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAP). 
 
According to ECU and Golden Tag, there are no environmental obligations or 
responsibilities associated with the property, other than adherence to the regulations of the 
SEMARNAP concerning exploration activities. 
 
Micon is unaware of any outstanding environmental liabilities, other than those normally 
associated with owning an exploration property in Mexico, attached to the San Diego project, 
and is unable to comment on any remediation which may have been undertaken by previous 
companies.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
The San Diego property is located in the State of Durango approximately 75 km southwest of 
the city of Torreón and 160 km northeast of the city of Durango.  It can be accessed via 9 km 
of dirt road from the village of San Diego de Arriba (population 16) which is located only 5 
km east from the two main highways, Highway # 40-49, a four-lane toll highway, and 
Federal Road # 40, a free two-lane highway.  From the property, ECU's Velardeña mine can 
be reached either via Road # 40 or via a good gravel road that goes to the El Cobre mine and 
continues around the Sierra San Lorenzo to the village of Velardeña, 25 km away.  See 
Figure 5.1 for an aerial view of the area. 
 
The city of Torreón is a relatively young city founded in 1907 by cotton growers and cattle 
ranchers.  It is now a major industrial city which is not only host to the Peñoles smelter and a 
major coal-fired electricity plant but is home to one of the largest dairy industries in Mexico.  
The Francisco Sarabia airport, located in Torreón, is one of the many international airports in 
Mexico with flights not only to the major national centres but also to some international 
cities, including Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.

The city of Durango is an old colonial city (founded in 1563) which served as the political 
and ecclesiastical capital of the Nueva Vizcaya province of New Spain until 1823.  Minerals 
are the chief product but the city is also an agricultural, commercial and tourist centre.  The 
city has a population of approximately 427,000 (2000 census).  Durango hosts an 
international airport with numerous regional flights to other major Mexican cities as well as 
international flights to Los Angeles and to the southeast USA.  The city of Durango is the 
capital of the State of Durango. 
 
The area in which the San Diego property is situated is considered to be a semi-arid region 
which is predominantly semi-hot and dry.  According to the Koeppen classification, it is a 
Bs1 hw climate, with a mean annual temperature of 21.1° C and rainfall averaging 243.7 
millimetres per year (mm/y).  Temperatures can drop below freezing in the winter and 
commonly reach the high thirties from July through to September.  The predominant winds 
are northeast-southwest, with speeds of 2.1 to 6.0 m/s. 
 
The Velardeña district is located on the northwestern edge of the Meseta Central 
physiographical province, within the Sierras Transversas sub-province, on the eastern flank 
of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range.  The village of Velardeña is located in the 
valley floor set between two northwest trending ranges.  To the west is the Sierra Santa 
Maria which rises approximately 300 m above the valley floor and, to the east is the Sierra 
San Lorenzo rising approximately to 750 m.  The Sierra San Lorenzo hosts the Velardeña, 
Chicago and San Diego properties, the latter one being located farthest to the east into the 
Cerros El Trovador. 
 
Topography at San Diego takes its horse-shoe shape from the Cerros El Trovador hills 
located along its southern limit.  Property elevations change abruptly going from the top of 
the cerros in the south down to the valley floor in the north.   The Trovador vein located near 
the southern property limit lies at the 1,740 m elevation, whereas the most northerly El Jal 
vein is located at 1,580 m and the central Los Adelaidos shaft (La Cruz/La Rata) is at an 
elevation of 1,640 m. 
 
From a physiographical point of view, the zone is mature with a mixed topography.  Streams 
within the area drain either to internal drainage systems or tributaries of the Nazas and 
Aguanaval rivers which are connected to the Laguna de Mayrán.  All of the streams are 
intermittent and short lived during the rainy season, only.  A series of water dams were built 
over the years to control water flow from the two rivers for irrigation and water management 
purposes.  The Francisco Zarco dam, located 25 km to the west, is the closest to the San 
Diego project. 
 
The geomorphology shows characteristics typical of a cycle of arid to semi-arid areas.  More 
specifically, it has an abundance of valleys and flat areas variably filled with the erosionional 
material from adjacent lands.  The drainage system is generally dendritic with a lot of the 
streams not comprised of well defined beds and which disappear when they reach the valley 
floor due to infiltration or dissemination.  Several of these streams are controlled by the 
fractures and faults resulting from the deformations related to the Laramide orogeny and the 



 

 24

consequent tectonic events.  Figure 5.2 is a view of the Cerro del Trovador (looking south) 
with its well defined stream pattern shaped due to its pre-existing fracture and fault patterns.

Wildlife is typical of semi-arid areas with mice, rabbits squirrels, coyotes and a declining 
deer population from over hunting and predation from cougars.  Numerous cows, donkeys 
and horses are left to roam free in the area to feed on the vegetation.  Birds are abundant and 
include vultures, hawks, swallows, cardinals and various songbirds and sparrows.  The Sierra 
portion of the Durango state is also well-known for its rattle snakes, scorpions and venomous 
spiders, including tarantulas and black widows, all of which have been seen on the property. 
 
An experienced labour force is available in the village of Velardeña, as well as several 
nearby communities.  The San Diego property was once supplied with electric power by a 
line connected to the national grid.  All of the electrical posts remain standing and would 
only need to be rewired to be functional.  Supplies and equipment are directly available from 
Torreón, Monterrey, Chihuahua and Durango, as well as from specialized suppliers 
elsewhere in Mexico, Canada and the USA. 
 
On the property, water is found at the bottom of some of the old mine shafts, mainly those of 
La Cruz and Montanez.  Water is also obtained from a 50 m deep well located 1 km northeast 
from the project which was drilled to supply water to the historical plant installations on the 
San Diego property.  Current diamond drilling has also revealed the presence of further water 



 

 25

aquifers on the property.  If needed, water can also be obtained by trucking it from the 
Francisco Zarco dam and from the Peñoles mill installations in Velardeña. 
 
Some of the old buildings from the previous production eras remain in place.  However, the 
majority of them are adobe constructions which were once used for storage and housing and 
are currently in a state of disrepair and crumbling.  The best preserved building is the former 
processing plant which was constructed of bricks and stones. 
 
For the needs of the exploration campaigns, an adobe house was first reconditioned in 
September, 2006 to be used as an office and warehouse.  Thereafter, in January, 2008, a 
portion of a large adobe construction was refurbished to store pulps and rejects from the core 
samples sent to the assay laboratories. Core logging and splitting activities are conducted in 
an open space covered by a corrugated tin roof adjacent to the Los Adelaidos shaft.  No 
housing facilities have been yet constructed on site.  Figure 5.3 is a view of the two 
exploration buildings at the San Diego site with the water reservoir located on a small plateau 
and the core storage area down below. 
 
If exploration is successful in identifying an economic mineral deposit, the extracted material 
will most likely be processed at ECU's nearby processing facilities in Velardeña.  ECU 
currently owns a 340 tonne per day (t/d) flotation mill (Figure 5.4) situated just outside of the 
village.  This mill has a fully operational lead and zinc flotation circuit and in 2006, 
commissioned a pyrite circuit to recover more gold and silver from the sulphide ore.  The 
pyrite concentrate is presently being stockpiled and stored in a warehouse built by ECU close 
to its Velardeña facilities.  Furthermore, ECU has recently acquired a 80 t/d flotation mill 
adjacent to its other mill to use for large scale metallurgical testing or for processing specific 
ores different from the main feed.  ECU is also currently evaluating the option of expanding 
its milling capacity at Velardeña. 
 
The following information concerning development of the underground workings is derived 
primarily from Pinet (1999) and Hamilton (2003). 
 

"The San Diego property contains the La Cruz-La Rata and El Trovador historical 
mines in addition to a number of shallower shafts which were sunk on narrower veins 
like the Cantarranas, Montanez and El Jal."  
 
"Two shafts were sunk on the La Cruz vein.  Along its western portion, the La Cruz 
shaft (Figure 5.5) was sunk vertically for about 80 m from the approximate elevation 
of the third level, whereupon it becomes inclined.  To the east, the Los Adelaidos shaft 
is vertical for a depth of 115 m.  Two shafts are also present along the El Trovador 
vein with the western shaft approximately 165 m deep, whereas the eastern shaft 
connects the 360 m long Viboras adit to a level located 75 m below."

6.0 HISTORY 
 
Mining has played an important role in Mexico since pre-historic times, but it entered a 
period of rapid expansion after the Spanish conquest when rich mineral deposits were found.  
The wealth found in these early mines served as an incentive for the early colonizers to locate 
to more remote and poorly accessible portions of the county. 
 
It is not known if the indigenous peoples or the Spanish colonists first began mining in the 
Velardeña district but exploration and mining extends back to at least the late 1500's or early 
1600's.  The mines were first worked by the Spanish with the high-grade ore mined by hand 
and processed on a small scale by direct smelting. 
 
6.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION AND EXPLORATION 
 
During the late sixteenth century silver production accounted for 80% of all exports from 
Nueva España (New Spain), although, by the mid-seventeenth century silver production 
collapsed when mercury, necessary to the refining process, was diverted to the silver mines 
of Potosí in present day Bolivia.  Collapse of the seventeenth century mining led to 
widespread bankruptcy among the miners and hacienda owners; however, in the latter half of 
the seventeenth century silver mining began to recover in Nueva España. 
 
The peasant uprisings of 1810 to 1821 were disastrous to the Mexican mining industry with 
both the insurgents' soldiers and royalist troops all but destroying the mining production in 
Mexico, and the Velardeña mining district was not spared during this period. 
 
Records for the remainder of the nineteenth century are sporadic and it is only in the later 
part of the century that mining appears to make a comeback in the district.  The following is 
taken from the report by Hamilton (2003). 
 

"In 1888, the Velardeña Mining and Smelting Company was formed, a smelter was 
installed, and larger scale production began.  At this time many of the smaller 
operations were consolidated within the larger group.  According to Pinet (2000), a 
report written in 1913 recorded that in four years commencing in 1888, the Velardeña 
district in Durango produced 120,000 kg of silver, 19,000 t of lead, and 519 kg of 
gold." 
 
"In 1902, the American Smelting and Refining Company ("Asarco") gained control of 
the operations and installed a new smelter processing 2,500 t per day principally from 
the Santa Maria, Terneras and Reina del Cobre mines.  Both the Terneras and Santa 
Juana veins were mined on a significant scale by Asarco during the period from 1902 
to 1926.  The San Mateo vein, however, supported only a small-scale operation by an 
independent company at about the same time.  Several other smaller mining companies 
were also active in the area at that time (Saiida Mining Co., America Mexico Mining 
and Development Co., and Mexico Texas Co.)." 
 



 

 29

"Asarco and independent operators worked the mines continuously until 1926, when 
low metal prices and an unstable political environment contributed to the closure of the 
mines.  In addition, the softer oxide ore was diminishing with depth, and the operations 
were encountering harder sulphide ore that made mining more difficult.  After the mine 
closures, the smelter was dismantled and moved to San Luis Potosi (Pinet, 1999).  Old 
reports indicate that early in the twentieth century, the average grade of the Terneras 
mineralization was 3.5 g/t gold, 835 g/t silver and 3.85% lead.  Production statistics for 
the years 1920 to 1924 show that the Terneras mine produced 138,331 t with an 
average grade of 4.0 g/t gold, 419.7 g/t silver, 2.1 % lead, 0.3 % copper and 2.5 % zinc 
(Pinet, 1999, and references therein).  In 1924, the Terneras shaft was sunk to the 14th 
level, and a crosscut was driven to intersect the Santa Juana vein.  Also, in 1924, it was 
reported that production from the Santa Juana vein totalled 37,000 t (in excess of 100 
t/d), with an average grade of 5.9 g/t gold and 573 g/t silver.  Lesser production was 
also reported from the Santa Isabel chimney zone (562 t grading 0.6 g/t gold and 401 
g/t silver) and from the Industrial Minera de Mexico S.A. (IMMSA) controlled, El 
Pilar zone (863 t grading 2.3 g/t gold and 162 g/t silver) (Pinet, 1999, and references 
therein)." 
 
"After 1926, the mines in the district were worked on a small scale by local miners 
until the advent in 1961 of nationalization by the Mexican Government, which 
precluded foreign ownership of the majority of shares in mining ventures.  As a 
consequence, Asarco became a minority shareholder in IMMSA, who revived their 
interest in the area and IMMSA consolidated mineral concessions in two areas in the 
district.  Exploration and development work recommenced in the Santa Maria and 
Reina del Cobre mines in 1968, and approximately 300,000 t/y were processed by 
IMMSA in their plant through until 2002." 
 
"In 1969, IMMSA abandoned several mineral concession blocks in the area, including 
those underlying the Terneras and the San Diego mines.  These were acquired by a 
consortium of individuals headed by Alejandro Gaitan of Torreón, Coahuila.  During 
the 1970's through the late 1980's several mines in the district were exploited by 
gambusinos for direct shipping of the gold/silver ores.   Operations by the Gaitan 
Group on the project area consisted of the removal of material from the old waste 
dumps and several thousand tonnes of fill left in the stopes from earlier mining.  This 
material was processed in a mill about 100 km distant from the mines.  In 1990, Mr. 
Gaitan purchased a 50-t/d flotation mill located approximately 13 km from the mines.  
Portions of several veins within the Santa Juana mine were extracted and processed 
through the mill at a reported average grade of 396 g/t silver, 5.9 % lead, 7.6 % zinc, 
and a mean grade of 4 g/t gold.  The mill was operated intermittently at a low 
throughput due to a lack of mill-feed.  The mines and mill were idled in early 1992." 
 
"In 1994, William Resources acquired the concessions owned by the Gaitan 
consortium via their Mexican affiliate BLM Minera.  During that year, they carried out 
a feasibility study at the Velardeña Mine and commenced pre-production development 
and mine construction in July 1995 (Duke et al. 1995).  From 1995 to 1997, William 



 

 30

Resources carried out a surface mapping and sampling program on the various 
concessions, as well as an underground sampling program, principally on the Santa 
Juana vein system.  William Resources also drove the Terneras adit, providing access 
to the 6th level of the Terneras mine, which in turn allowed access to the 12th level of 
the Santa Juana Mine via a pre-existing crosscut.  The Santa Juana winze was 
deepened 42 m to the 15.5 level, and a ramp was driven from that level to the 17th 
level." 
 
"Early in 1996, Williams Resources purchased a 600 t/d processing plant and located it 
3.5 km from the mine site.  In May of that year Williams Resources commenced 
treatment of dump material, which was mixed with minor quantities of development 
material from the Santa Juana mine. William Resources ceased operation in mid-
1997." 

 
In December, 1997, ECU Gold (the predecessor company of ECU) purchased 93.48% of 
BLM Minera and 100% of Minera William from William Resources. 
 
In late 1999, BLM Minera conducted a geological mapping and sampling program on the 
San Diego property.  A total of 277 individual samples were collected from old underground 
workings and ground surface vein exposures of the La Cruz, La Rata, Montanez, El Jal, 
Cantarranas and El Trovador veins.  These samples were analyzed for gold, silver, lead and 
zinc with a few from the El Jal vein assayed for gold and silver only.  Density tests consisting 
of the immersion method were conducted on selected samples of the vein and wall-rock 
material.  Surface plans and long sections with accompanying sample locations were 
generated from 1999 to 2000 and later, in 2004, a resource estimate was completed by ECU 
on 5 of the main veins (La Cruz, La Rata, Montanez, Cantarranas and El Jal).  El Trovador 
vein was not included in the estimate as it was felt that, being the most extensively worked 
area, it offered less potential for new discoveries or extensions. 
 
The 1999 underground chip sampling was carried out on the backs of old workings as well as 
on existing pillars.  The sampling was done using a similar approach to the past and present 
ECU sampling procedures conducted at its Velardeña mines.  ECU's sampling procedures 
are as follows: 
 

• The vein is sampled by chiselling out a sample over the width of the vein. 
 
• Only vein material is sampled.  No wall rock is collected for assaying. 
 
• Sampling is carried out perpendicular to the vein contacts (where possible) and the 

true width of the vein is recorded. 
 
• Sample spacing at the San Diego project was not systematic and varied from 3 m to in 

excess of 30 m spacing. 
 



 

 31

• The location of all samples was measured and tied to the surveyed local mine grid.  
The strike and dip of the vein were also recorded. 

 
• A similar approach was followed for the collection of surface samples. 
 

On November 2, 2005, ECU and Golden Tag entered into a joint venture agreement where 
Golden Tag could earn a 50% interest in the San Diego property by expending a total of 
US $1.5 million on exploration expenses in increments of US $500,000 per year over three 
years.  As of November, 2007, Golden Tag had incurred expenses on the property 
representing US $1.629 million, thus earning its 50% interest into the San Diego property. 
 
The 2006 to 2007 exploration program initiated in August, 2006 entailed the completion of 
6,590 m of drilling of NQ and BQ size core.  A total of 4,850 core samples were assayed 
systematically for gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper and arsenic.  The drill holes from this 
campaign are numbered from SD-06-01 to SD-07-17.  All drill core from this program was 
retained with core boxes cross-piled on pallets and stored at the property. 
 
During the first phase of drilling that went from August, 2006 to February, 2007, 11 drill 
holes totalling 3,464 m were completed.  Phase 2 of the diamond drilling campaign was 
conducted from March to May, 2007.  During the second phase of drilling, 10 holes were 
completed totalling 3,126 m. 
 
Drilling was first carried out with a Boart Longyear 38 drill owned and operated by Minera 
William until a second, full hydraulic drill from Forages G4 Ltée (Forages) was contracted 
out in November, 2006.  In February, 2007, Forages reached an agreement with ECU under 
which it purchased the Minera William drill and became the sole contractor on the San Diego 
project. 
 
No diamond drilling had ever been conducted on the property prior to the 2006 to 2007 
program initiated by ECU and Golden Tag in August, 2006.  The San Diego property still 
remains at the exploration stage with the aim of the drilling programs being to prove up 
additional resources which could lead to a viable operation. 
 
A petrographic study with thin section analysis was completed in November, 2007 by Anne-
Sophie Renou of Modèlaur Enr. (Val-d'Or, Canada).  Also in November, 2007, a preliminary 
variography study was completed by Gary Giroux of Giroux Consultants Ltd. (Vancouver, 
Canada).  
 
The thin section study prepared by Modèlaur Enr. indicated that the diorite core samples 
submitted belong effectively to the diorite field with one sample falling into the 
monzodiorite/granodiorite range according to the Streckeisen classification.  The study 
concluded that the various intrusive samples could originate from the same magmatic body 
and this hypothesis is presently being validated by a whole rock analysis study that ECU and 
Golden Tag have commissioned.  The prograde skarn alteration is characterized by a 
tremolite-granite-wollastonite assemblage which affects both the diorite and the limestone 



 

 32

host.  The study also confirmed the presence of a dominant propylitic alteration consisting of 
carbonate-epidote-chlorite occurring along with a less extensively developed phyllic 
alteration.  Both of these are indicative of a low temperature hydrothermal system. 
 
Giroux Consultants Ltd. completed a preliminary variography study on the San Diego veins 
to obtain an indication of the range and direction, along the strike and dip, over which the 
continuity of the mineralization could be interpreted.  Due to the rather small number of 
sample assay results available at this stage of the project, only the La Cruz, La Rata, 
Montanez and Cantarranas veins could be modeled.  Of these, only the La Cruz had enough 
data to model in any direction other than along strike.  Study results indicated that, for La 
Cruz, the ranges of maximum continuity both along strike and down dip were from 30 to 60 
m.  A possible long range distance of 50 m along strike was obtained for La Rata, 40 to 60 m 
for Montanez and 10 to 48 m for Cantarranas. 
 
6.2 HISTORICAL AND PRESENT MINING 
 
The Velardeña mining district and the San Diego project area are riddled with mine openings 
and old workings, in a somewhat haphazard fashion near surface, representing the earliest 
efforts at extraction, and more systematic at depth, which is indicative of later, better 
organized and engineered mining.  Associated with these openings and workings is a number 
of ruins, which represent the mine buildings, chapels and residences of the inhabitants of the 
mining district during its past. 
 
The vast bulk of the material which has been extracted from underground operations through 
the tunnels, shafts and winzes is scattered over the hillsides in waste dumps and beneath the 
foundations of the ruins and modern buildings.  Historically, individual veins or deposits had 
separate owners and, in the case of some of the larger veins or deposits, had several owners 
along the strike length which resulted in a surfeit of adits and shafts and very inefficient 
operations. 
 
The mines within the Velardeña mining district have been developed primarily by using open 
stope/shrinkage and cut and fill underground mining methods.  The ground conditions, which 
vary from good to poor, and the deposit geometries tend to favour both mining methods with 
development waste used for backfill. 
 
There is large exploration potential on the San Diego property both along the strike of the 
various veins and at depth below the old workings as these areas remain largely untested and 
present a major exploration target for both ECU and Golden Tag. 
 
6.3 RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES PRIOR TO NOVEMBER, 2008 
 
Historically, the resource estimates for the San Diego project were done internally by both 
William Resources and ECU.  However, the more recent resource estimates were prepared 
by Roscoe Postle and Associates (RPA) in 2005 and Broad Oak Associates (Broad Oak) in 
2006.  These reports were posted on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and 



 

 33

Retrieval (SEDAR).  SEDAR is the official site that provides access to most public securities 
documents and information filed by public companies and investment funds with the 
Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA).  The RPA and Broad Oak resource estimates 
discussed in this section were prepared in compliance with the current CIM standards and 
definitions for estimating resources as required by NI 43-101 regulations. 
 
In late 1999, BLM Minera conducted a geological mapping and sampling program on the 
San Diego property.  The surface plans and long sections with accompanying sample 
locations were generated in 1999 and 2000 for this exploration program and later, in 2004, a 
resource estimate was completed by ECU on 5 of the main veins (La Cruz, La Rata, 
Montanez, Cantarranas and El Jal).  The 2004 resource estimate completed by ECU was not 
conducted in compliance with the current CIM standards and definitions, and will not be 
discussed in this report. 
 
The compilation work from the 1999 exploration program was later used by both RPA and 
Broad Oak for producing the San Diego resource estimates included in the Technical Reports 
published in 2005 and 2006.  The 1999 exploration information was also incorporated into 
the resource estimate discussed later in this report. 
 
The 2005 RPA resource estimate is summarized in Table 6.1 and the estimate conducted by 
Broad Oak in 2006 is summarized in Table 6.2.

Between August, 2006 and May, 2007, ECU and Golden Tag completed a preliminary 
6,590 m two phase drilling program on the San Diego property.  The drilling results from the 
two drilling campaigns, along with the underground sampling done in 1999, were used to 
prepare a resource estimate for the San Diego project as of December, 2007.  Micon was 
retained by ECU and Golden Tag to provide direction for, and conduct a review of, the 
December, 2007 resource estimate.  The resource estimate was completed by Kateri 
Marchand, a geological consultant retained by ECU and Golden Tag and was reviewed by 
Micon to ensure conformity with the current CIM standards and definitions for estimating 
resources as required by NI 43-101 regulations.   
 
The parameters used to determine the cut-off grades are based on the economical criteria 
presented below which were then used to determine which mineralized blocks could be 
included in the resource estimate.  Blocks below the cut-off grades were reviewed and were 
occasionally used in the estimate to preserve continuity.  The lead and zinc mineralization for 
those blocks located within the oxide portion of the veins was not taken into account in the 
estimation of the silver equivalent cut-off.  Criteria used for the cut-off grade determinations 
include the commodity prices and operating costs established by ECU, and recoveries for 
gold, silver, lead and zinc also determined by ECU from its Velardeña operation.  Table 6.3 
summarizes the parameters for the December, 2007 resource estimate.

The silver equivalents for the other commodities contained in the mineralization at the San 
Diego project were determined to be as follows: 
 

• Gold 1 g/t = 0 g/t silver. 
• Lead 1% = 26.60 g/t silver. 
• Zinc 1% = 31.21 g/t silver. 

 
The following cut-offs were used for the 2007 mineral resource estimate at the San Diego 
project: 
 

• Cut-off for narrow vein mining is set at 160 g/t silver. 
• Cut-off for bulk mining is established at 80 g/t silver.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The geological setting of the Velardeña mining district in which the San Diego property is 
situated is described in detail in a number private and government reports.  The following 
description of the geological setting has been combined from several of these reports. 
 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Velardeña district is located at the easternmost limit of the Sierra Madre Occidental, on 
the boundary between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Mesa Central sub-provinces.  Both 
of these terranes are underlain by Paleozoic and possibly Precambrian basement rocks.  Most 
of Mexico's high-grade silver mines are located in the Mesa Central, near this contact.  
Figure 7.1 is the geological map of the Velardeña mining district and surrounding area. 
 
The regional geology is characterized by a thick sequence of limestones and minor 
calcareous clastic sediments of Cretaceous age, intruded by Tertiary plutons of acidic to 
intermediate composition.  During the Laramide Orogeny, the sediments were folded into 
symmetrical anticlines and synclines that were modified into a series of asymmetrical 
overturned folds by a later stage of compression.  This event also buckled the stratigraphy 
about a southwest striking, vertically dipping hinge-line around the village of Velardeña. 
 
A series of younger Tertiary stocks have intruded the older Cretaceous limestones over a 
distance of approximately 15 km along a northeast to southwest trend coinciding with the 
hinge-line mentioned above.  These late geological events further contributed to the shaping 
of the typical basin and range tectonic setting of the area.  The intrusive bodies range from a 
more mafic dioritic composition in the northeast, to a more felsic alaskite in the southwest.  
Local developments of exoskarn, endoskarn, hornfels and marble occur associated with the 
intrusive rocks. The various mineral deposits of the Velardeña mining district occur along the 
northeast-southwest axis and are spatially associated with the intrusions and their related 
alteration. 
 
An important northwest-southeast fracture system is associated with these intrusions and in 
many cases, acts as the main focus of mineralization.  These are deep, basement-penetrating 
boundary faults which served as magma conduits (Clark et al, 1988).  A younger fracture 
system is the north-northeast to northeast trending faults which play an important role as they 
off-set the northwest trending mineralized veins.  This is well demonstrated at ECU's 
Terneras mine where the northeast trending Tres Aguilas fault off-sets the mineralized 
northwest trending veins such as the Santa Juana veins.

7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 
The San Diego property is underlain by a thick sequence of limestone that corresponds to 
rocks of the Aurora and Cuesta del Cura formations of Lower Cretaceous age. The Aurora 
limestone is generally medium to thick-bedded, dark grey to black and locally cherty.  The 
Cuesta del Cura limestone is thin to medium bedded and dark grey to black, with siliceous 
lenses and beds of a black colour.  A thin-bedded calcareous shale interbedded with thin-
bedded limestone (probably of the Indidura formation) locally overlies the earlier formations.  
The Indidura formation is Upper Cretaceous in age. 
 
Figure 7.2 is a local geological map of the Velardeña mining district surrounding the 
immediate area of the San Diego property. 
 
Several types of Tertiary intrusive rocks are present in the Velardeña district as described by 
Pinet (1999).  The largest of these outcrops on the western flank of Sierra San Lorenzo and 
underlies a portion of ECU's Velardeña mines.  It is referred to as the Terneras pluton and 
forms a northeast oriented, slightly elongated body, considered to represent a diorite or 
monzodiorite which outcrops over a distance of about 2.5 km.  The adjacent limestones have 
been altered by contact metamorphism (exoskarn) and locally the intrusive has been 
metamorphosed (endoskarn). 
 
The Guardarraya intrusion is situated east of the Terneras pluton.  It consists of a series of 
irregularly shaped bodies essentially oriented northeast.  The intrusion is considered to 
represent a quartz diorite or a granodiorite.  The metamorphic aureole around this intrusion is 
less extensive than the one associated with the Terneras pluton. 
 
At the San Diego project, a diorite intrusive stock cores the central portion of the property.  
In a very similar way to what is observed on the regional scale, this intrusive stock is 
northeast oriented with the surrounding limestones being metamorphosed to white marble 
and exoskarn along the contact zones and the intrusive metamorphosed to endoskarn.  
Further away from the intrusion, the limestones show only a partial (patchy) recrystalization 
to marble as well as a hornfel alteration that can make the limestones appear like rhyolite.  
Younger and more differentiated quartz-feldspar porphyry sills have been emplaced along 
northwest to southwest trending fault zones located on each side of the central diorite 
intrusion. 
 
The Santa Maria intrusion, west of the village of Velardeña, consists of quartz latite 
porphyry, and occurs as two large bodies, as well as several smaller stocks, dikes and sills.  
Biotite from this intrusion has been dated by the potassium-argon (K-Ar) method at 33.1 +/- 
1.4 Ma (Pinet, 1999, and references therein).  The metamorphic aureole developed in the 
limestone host-rocks is characterized by garnet, wollastonite, and by the absence of 
pyroxene. 
 
Other intrusive bodies in the region include rhyolitic dikes that locally intrude the 
northeastern flank of the Sierra Santa Maria quartz-sanidine porphyry.

The Ahuichila Formation represents a post Laramide depositional domain characterized by 
conglomerate, siltstone and sandstone of the Upper Paleocene to Lower Oligocene periods.  
In the Velardeña district, it principally outcrops west of the Sierra Santa Maria.  Volcanic 
rocks, principally rhyolite, outcrop on the western flank of the Sierra San Lorenzo.  These 
rocks weather to an ochre colour, and are easily visible in the countryside, where they 
unconformably overlie the older sedimentary and plutonic rocks. 
 
The effects of the Laramide deformation are clearly evident through the folding of the 
Cretaceous sedimentary rocks.  Post Laramide structures are represented by normal faults 
which can exhibit significant displacement of the rock units. 
 
7.3 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 
The vast majority of the San Diego property is underlain by massive beds of grey limestone 
from the Aurora Formation.  These rocks were intruded by a younger Tertiary dioritic stock 
and porphyritic monzonite sills.  The dioritic stock is a differentiated intrusion that ranges 
from a diorite with hornblende biotite phenocrysts to a feldspar porphyry diorite and to a 
potassium feldspar (quartz) monzodiorite.  A common feature to these rocks is their 
porphyritic texture.  Their primary assemblage consists of plagioclase, amphibole and quartz 
with hornblende and/or biotite phenocrysts with accessory magnetite, apatite and sphene.  
Iron and magnesium minerals are typically altered to carbonates, epidote and chlorite.  
Quartz occurs both as a primary constituent forming small phenocrysts or anhedral rounded 
eyes as well as a post-magmatic alteration product that will infill cavities and crystal 
interstices. (Renou, 2007). 
 
Porphyritic monzodiorite sills, which could be similar to the quartz latite and quartz sanidine 
porphyries described at the Santa Maria mine, have been identified in both the western and 
eastern portions of the property where they are respectively associated with the Montanez 
vein and the La Cruz/La Rata veins. 
 
Late, centimetric rhyolite dykelets were occasionally observed in drill core.  These have an 
aphanitic, nonporphyritic texture, and are generally brown-rosy coloured most likely from 
hematization.  They are commonly cross-cut by hairline fractures with bleached-white 
alteration halos. 
 
The late emplacement of intrusive bodies within the limestone package created skarn 
alteration zones along the contact areas.  These zones are best developed in the vicinity of the 
diorite stock where contact metamorphism led first to partial and then, closer to the contacts, 
to complete recrystalization of the limestones into marble and skarn.  In drill core, one can 
readily observe the gradual change from an all-grey limestone into a white marble as one 
progresses towards the diorite intrusive.  Skarn alteration is also best developed within 
packages of closely spaced limestone beds and intrusive sills such as the ones observed to the 
west of the north-northeast Arroyo fault in the La Cruz/La Rata zones, and along the eastern 
contact of the small diorite stock in the area contained between the Montanez Zones and the 
Cantarranas Vein..  A thin section study conducted on the skarn samples shows that these 
rocks consist predominantly of carbonate as a primary constituent.  Green garnets, and more 



 

 41

occasionally brown garnets, are present in variable amounts of less than 1% up to 10 to 20% 
and usually range from 10 to 30 mm in size.  Garnets can be partially to completely replaced 
by epidote and carbonates.  Wollastonite and tremolite are identified in minor amounts.  
Quartz alteration from iron-magnesium minerals is also noticed. 
 
7.3.1 Structure 
 
Stratigraphy is generally oriented northwest-southeast and limestone units show steeply 
dipping beds which are facing north in the western sector, and are south dipping in the 
eastern sector of the property.  Figure 7.3 is a detailed geology map of the San Diego project 
which indicates the geological and structural features found on the property. 
 
Four major fault zones are presently identified on the property.  Movements along these 
faults are partially responsible for the abruptly changing topography.  These major fault 
structures are: 
 

1) The north-northeast oriented Arroyo fault which follows the western contact of the 
dioritic intrusive.  This fault is interpreted as the natural limit between the western 
and eastern sectors.  It appears to be steeply dipping to the east. 

 
2) The northwest-southeast Corridor fault is contained within the monzodiorite sill in the 

western sector and merges with the east-west trending Rata vein.  This fault is parallel 
to stratigraphy and appears to be steeply dipping to the north. 

 
3) The Grey fault is a carbonate-clay rich east-west trending fault located in the eastern 

sector.  It varies greatly in width from just a few metres up to 20 m and dips to the 
south at about 80°.  This fault zone is located immediately to the south of the 
Cantarranas Vein that is also east-west trending. 

 
4) The Montanez Fault and La Cruz Fault Zones which are northwest-southeast oriented 

and respectively located to the east and west of the central diorite intrusion.  The 
Montanez fault zone located in the eastern block dips steeply south whereas the La 
Cruz fault zone in the western block dips steeply north. 

 
Movement on the Arroyo fault is interpreted as oblique having a reverse offset combined 
with a right-lateral slip displacement resulting in the easterly block moving up and south 
relative to the western block.  The lateral movement is most readily observed in the offset 
between the northwest trending La Cruz and Montanez Veins which are now believed to be 
one and the same structure.  The vertical displacement is demonstrated by the sharp change 
in elevation of the oxide-sulphide limit that is located only 25 m below surface in the eastern 
block whereas it is located some 150 m below surface in the area west of the Arroyo fault 
(Appendix – Longitudinal sections).

 43

Movement along the Montanez fault zone appears to be a reverse off-set with the limestone 
block to the south moving upward relative to the adjacent monzonite unit with the latter 
having undergone the bulk of the deformation.  This interpretation is supported by 
observations made in core where the altered, fractured and mineralized monzonite comes in 
contact with massive looking, weakly altered limestones. 
 
Recent deep drilling conducted in the eastern sector of the property has shown that the brittle 
deformation pattern of faults and fractures is developed for the most part closer to surface 
and that at depths greater than 350 m to 400 m below surface (corresponding to an elevation 
of 1,250 m to 1,200 m) a preferred mineral alignment defining the schistosity, local shearing 
and mylonites, is observed in core.  Slip lineations along fracture/fault planes are also 
frequently observed within deformation zones. 
 
7.3.2 Alteration 
 
From surface down to approximately 350 m, carbonatization is the most widespread 
alteration and it affects all rock units.  It is often encountered in association with the argillic 
alteration.  This is especially true of the crumbly fractured and/or faulted zones, such as the 
Grey fault zone which is rich in carbonate and clay minerals.  At depths of below 400 m, the 
widespread carbonatization is gradually replaced by a pervasive silicification.  The 
silicification is associated with both the propylitic and phyllic patterns characteristic of the 
epithermal environment encountered at San Diego.  The phyllic and propylitic alterations are 
typical of low temperature environments and therefore of deposits formed at relatively 
shallow depths. 
 
The prograde skarn alteration affecting the limestone and marble units is characterized by the 
mineral assemblage tremolite-garnet-wollastonite.  Two types of exoskarn have been 
identified; a Green skarn which takes its name from its green garnet content (possibly 
grossular) and a Café skarn that contains brown garnet.  The green garnets are commonly 
replaced by epidote and carbonate.  The skarn alteration envelope appears to be more 
extensively developed along the northeastern contact with the diorite stock and quickly 
disappears moving away from this contact area.  Recent diamond drilling conducted at 
greater depths of 400 to 800 m below surface has indicated that the skarn alteration becomes 
more prevalent at depth.  The drilling also revealed the presence of a new skarn area located 
in the southeastern corner of the property (Figure 7.3). 
 
The diorite intrusive will commonly display a propylitic alteration consisting of carbonate-
epidote-chlorite that becomes more intensely developed within polymetallic stringer 
stockwork zones of mineralization.  The alteration minerals are formed from the breakdown 
of iron-magnesium minerals, such as biotite, amphibole and pyroxene.  The alteration 
minerals can also replace feldspars.  Observations made in thin sections indicate that the 
propylitic alteration overprints the earlier skarn mineral assemblage (Renou, 2007). 
 
Phyllic alteration consisting of quartz-sericite-illite containing appreciable quantities of 
pyrite is also directly associated with the alteration environment. 
 



 

 44

A broad new zone of hornfel alteration has been identified in recently completed drilling.  
However, at this time, this alteration has only been recognized in the southeastern corner of 
the property, specifically between the northwestern oriented Trovador and San José vein 
structures.  The hornfel alteration affects the limestone and skarn units forming a very hard, 
siliceous rock that can bear resemblance to rhyolite. 
 
Finally, a late, post-sulphide argillic alteration affects all units and is most noticeably 
developed in the western sector of the property where the oxide-sulphide demarcation limit 
sits at approximately 150 m below surface.  This alteration pattern consists of various clay 
minerals such as kaolinite, illite and smectite occurring along with iron and manganese 
oxides such as limonite, hematite and pyrolusite. 
 
Skarn as well as phyllic propylitic alterations are all attributed to hypogene hydrothermal 
fluids while the argillic alteration is most likely a supergene effect.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Mexican Silver Belt is almost 1,000 km long, stretching from Pachuca-Real de Monte in 
the south to Chihuahua in the north.  Within the belt, the Fresnillo, Guanajuato, Zacatecas 
and San Francisco del Oro-Santa Barbara districts have all produced in excess of 10,000 t of 
silver.  There are four principal types of deposits within this belt: 
 

• Skarn and carbonate (Manto type) replacement deposits of silver-lead-zinc+/-copper.  
Replacement type deposits can form massive sulphide lenses representing major 
sources of precious and base metals in a high grade, high tonnage ratio.  These 
deposits are generally interpreted as forming in carbonate-rich rocks, such as 
limestones, marbles and skarns, near the contact with an intrusive body.  In these 
areas, the carbonate host rocks can be replaced by metal bearing solutions which 
when they cool will form a mineral deposit. 

 
• Fracture filling veins which can be further subdivided based on mineralogy into: 

 
a) polymetallic silver-lead-zinc (+/- gold, copper) veins. 
b) gold-copper veins. 

 
These veins can have considerable extension along strike and at depth.  Currently 
Mexico's largest silver production comes from the Santo Niño vein developed by 
Peñoles in the Fesnillo district.  This vein which was discovered in 1975 has now 
been traced for over 2.5 km along strike and 500 m in depth with the width ranging 
from 0.10 to 4 m.  At the San Diego property, the Rata and San José veins have been 
followed for over 750 m along strike and the La Cruz vein was intersected at depths 
of up to 800 m below surface. 
 

• Silver-lead-zinc stockwork deposits. 
 
At the Santa Juana deposit, ECU has identified a wide mineralized corridor formed by 
closely spaced sub-parallel sulphide veins and stringers which reaches up 100 m 
wide.  This mineralized corridor offers the possibility of potentially extracting bulk 
tonnage from these underground areas within the mine. 
 

• Breccia zones and chimney pipes. 
 
Due to their generally good permeability, breccias may serve as conduits for 
mineralizing solutions which can become trapped and form deposits.  Breccias are 
commonly located at the intersections of fractures or along stratigraphic contacts.  
Breccia pipes are a common feature of epithermal systems, generally have irregular 
cylindrical shapes and can range in width from less than 1 metre up to several metres. 

 
Historical mine production at the San Diego property, as at ECU's Velardeña mines, 
typically came from mining the narrow, high grade silver-lead-zinc veins.  However, recent 
discoveries during the latest exploration programs demonstrate that, in addition to the 



 

 46

polymetallic vein systems, the San Diego property has the potential to host broad zones of 
mineralization at depth such as polymetallic stringer zones, skarns and carbonate replacement 
(manto type) zones.  At this time, these mineralized zones appear to have been mainly 
encountered in the eastern sector of the property and appear to be closely related to the 
northwest trending deep boundary faults (La Cruz and Montanez) which appear to have acted 
as the main channel ways for the mineralization.  The eastern sector of the San Diego 
property has seen the least extensive, historical mining with workings on the Montanez and 
Cantarranas veins not exceeding 30 m below surface. 
 
In addition, the recent drilling conducted on the Montanez vein has revealed the presence of 
wider zones of mineralization along the contacts zones (hangingwall and footwall zones) of 
the northwest trending porphyritic monzonite sill intruding the limestone units.  This zone 
bears similarities to the Santa Maria mine of Peñoles located just outside of Velardeña within 
the Sierra de Santa Maria dome.  About 90% of the total production from the dome was 
derived from the Pyrite zone emplaced along a quartz-feldspar dyke/limestone contact and is 
characterized by massive sulphide replacement bodies.  The Pyrite zone includes pyrite as 
well as sphalerite and galena with lesser amounts of chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and 
sulphosalts.  The gangue minerals are calcite and fluorite with minor quartz.  This mine was 
in operation from the late 1960's until 2002 at a rate of 600 to 800 t/d (Clark et al, 1988).  
Both the Santa Maria North and South operations were mined over lateral distances of 1.2 
km and to depths of 550 m

9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
The San Diego property hosts a well-developed pattern of high-grade silver-lead-zinc tabular 
veins that show persistent continuity both along strike and at depth.  Together these veins 
represent the near-surface expression of a low-sulphidation epithermal system of 
mineralization that extends further at depth into the mezothermal environment.  These 
systems are typically generated from multi-phase mineralizing events involving 
remobilization of already deposited sulphides and further deformation of the host-rock.  
Evidences of episodic hydrothermal activities consist of finely banded and comb textures 
within veins as well as breccia textures and cross-cutting relationship between generations of 
mineralized stringers along with selective replacement and zonation of sulphide minerals. 
 
At least two main systems of veins are recognized, an east-west system that includes the 
Cantarranas, La Rata, Porvenir and SD veins as well as a northwest system that includes the 
Montanez, La Cruz, San José and Trovador veins.  The other veins on the property, the 
northeast trending El Jal vein and east-northeast striking Canta-Splay vein, are recognized as 
subsidiary structures.  In the case of the La Cruz, Montanez and Cantarranas veins, these are 
located within fault corridors developed along contact zones between the intrusive rock 
(diorite/ monzonite) and the limestone host rocks.  On the other hand, the El Jal and Canta-
Splay veins are simple dilation fractures filled with mineralizing fluids. 
 
The spatial distribution of the mineralization is a function of not only the structural controls 
for the hydrothermally driven mineralized fluids but also the contact metasomatism resulting 
from the diorite emplacement into the limestone host.  Information gathered from the recent 
drilling programs confirmed the existence at depth of broader zones of sulphide stringers and 
veins with associated replacement of the adjacent white marble or green skarn (Figure 9.1).

Structural controls may take the form of faults, microfractures and lithological contacts.  The 
brittle deformation is best developed in the near surface environment whereas the ductile 
deformation becomes prevalent at depths greater than 400 m below surface.  Within the 
brittle environment, the more competent intrusive units represent a better host for the 
mineralization than the adjacent limestones.  This is particularly true within the La Cruz and 
La Rata fault zone where stringer-style mineralization is predominantly associated with the 
microfractured endoskarn.  Contact zones between closely spaced exoskarn and endoskarn 
units also represent a very favourable trap for the mineralization.  Historically, the richest ore 
extracted at the project site came from the Los Adelaidos shaft located in the centre of the 
property.  This shaft appears to be located near a triple junction point where the Cantarranas, 
Montanez and Ag zones are merging together forming a V-shape pattern ending abruptly 
along the north-northeast Arroyo Fault.  Further at depth, a more ductile style of deformation 
has developed shear zones and more occasionally, mylonites. 
 
In the eastern block, the limit of the oxide mineralization either matches the surface or 
reaches a maximum depth of 30 m.  In the western block, the oxide/sulphide boundary occurs 
at greater depths reaching 150 to 200 m below surface.  Transitional, mixed oxide/sulphide 
zones are reported for the La Cruz, La Rata, Cantarranas and the Montanez structures.  The 
transition zone from oxides to sulphides is quite abrupt and generally less than 10 m in depth.  
The oxide portions of the veins are composed of carbonates, oxides, halides and sulphosalts 
of primary mineralization.  Oxidation is reported to be less extensive where veins transect the 
intrusive diorite or skarn (Pinet, 1999). 
 
Overall, pyrite is the most widely occurring sulphide appearing as fine to coarse grained 
disseminations, or else as infilling within hairline fractures and veins along with other 
sulphides and, more occasionally, forming pluricentimetric veins of massive sulphides.  A 
thin section study revealed that pyrite often occurs along with pyrrhotite and that quite often, 
magnetite inclusions, possibly of primary origin are seen in these two sulphides (Renou, 
2007).  High grade veins will generally consist of pyrite ± sphalerite ± galena in a calcite-
quartz gangue with occasionally fluorite, either green or violet coloured.  The sulphide 
stringers in the stockwork zones will more commonly consist of pyrite and sphalerite.  
Occasionally, other sulphides such as chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and stibnite are 
observed in the core.  Silver mineralization is linked to argentiferous galena and sulphosalts 
such as freigbergite, tetrahedrite, and pyrargyrite that are sulphoarsenide with antimony.  Due 
to their epithermal nature, veins are often vuggy and may show local banding and comb 
texture.  Overall, for most of the main veins, the silver content will be greater than that of 
lead and zinc with these quite often found in near-equal proportions.  Zones of stockwork 
style mineralization usually consist of pyrite-sphalerite stringers.  Gold assay values of over 1 
g/t gold are seldom encountered and commonly associated with higher pyrite content. 
 
Deep drilling completed during the latest exploration drilling program has indicated that the 
prevalent pyrite-galena-sphalerite assemblage becomes gradually replaced at depth (below 
the 1,100 m elevation) by a pyrite +/- pyrrhotite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite assemblage with a 
high iron and arsenic content.  This change in the metallogeny at depth is consistent with 
what is observed at Peñoles Santa Maria mine at Velardeña and as such, can be seen as a 
general feature of the deeper mezothermal environment developed within the mining district.  



 

 49

Stringer-style mineralization is also commonly associated with the replacement of the skarn 
host with sulphide halos being formed along the contacts of individual stringers (Figure 9.2).

The diverse mineralization styles observed on the property from the massive sulphide zones 
intersected in holes SD-08-33, 34 and 35, to the robust vein systems that form wide 
mineralized envelopes with stringer zones all testify to the significant epithermal activity that 
once took place on the San Diego property.  Other elements such as the generally increasing 
skarn alteration and ductile deformation along with improving metal grades and widths at 
depth are further evidence that only a large and well-developed mineralizing system could 
have generated such diverse and wide spread mineralization.  The system may also have the 
potential to form significant manto-type massive sulphide lenses. 
 
9.1 MINERALIZED STRUCTURES AT THE SAN DIEGO PROJECT 
 
The deposits of the Velardeña mining district consist of epithermal silver-lead-zinc veins 
consisting of semi-massive to massive sulphides set in a calcite and/or quartz gangue.  The 
polymetallic veins are usually thin, normally in the range of 0.2 m to 0.8 m, but remarkably 
consistent along strike and down dip.  Comb and rhythmically banded textures are common. 
 
No polished thin section work as been conducted so far to establish the exact mineralogy of 
the San Diego veins.  Lead minerals typically occur as galena and complex sulphosalts.  Zinc 
minerals are predominantly sphalerite while iron minerals are mainly pyrite and arsenopyrite 
with lesser chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite.  Silver tends to run with the lead minerals while gold 



 

 50

mainly occurs in the pyrite-arsenopyrite assemblage.  The oxide zones commonly include 
limonite, hematite, pyrolusite and calcite with occasional goethite. 
 
Four of the main historical veins (La Cruz, Montanez, El Trovador and San Jose) on the 
property belong to the dominant northwest fracture system.  The La Cruz and Montanez 
veins dip south at 60 to 87° while the two other veins dip steeply to the north.  The main 
veins associated with the east-west fault system are the La Rata and Cantarranas veins, and 
the less extensive SD and Porvenir veins.  All of these veins either dip subvertical or dip 
steeply to the south.  Finally, the northeast trending vein system includes the El Jal vein, 
dipping east at 65°, the Arroyo vein that is subvertical and the Canta-Splay vein which is 
oriented north 060° and dips at 83° northwest.  Field observations corroborated by satellite 
imagery show that all three vein systems have lateral extensions which reach up to a 
kilometre in length or more.  As well, like at the nearby ECU Velardeña mines, the 
mineralized veins transect all rock units and reach their best widths within the limestone 
units. 
 
In addition to the vein structures, the present estimate includes resources outlined from the 
new broader mineralized zones – the Ag Zone and Mid Zone- identified during the last series 
of drill programs. 
 
The broader mineralized zones are stockwork zones consisting of a mix of narrow sulphide 
+/- calcite stringers (1 to 2 cm) and veins (up to 30 cm) as well as carbonate-replacement 
sulphide bands (or irregular patches) developed around the veins and stringers in-filling pre-
existing fractures.  Typically, the carbonate or skarn replacement zones will be formed of 
mineralized bands that are zoned with a central core of massive sphalerite +/- calcite 
changing outward to a more pyritic +/- arsenopyrite semi-massive and disseminated 
mineralization.  In the case of replacement patches, dark chlorite-hematite alteration halos 
surround the sulphide mineralization especially if magnetite is present (Figure 9.3).

The main mineralized vein structures identified at the San Diego project are described below: 
 
9.1.1 Northwest Trending Vein System 
 
9.1.1.1 La Cruz Vein 
 
The La Cruz, along with La Rata vein, was historically mined to a maximum depth of 
approximately 150 to 180 m.  The Los Adelaidos shaft was sunk on the eastern extension of 
the two veins where mining encountered one of the richest portions of the vein containing 
massive galena.  Extensive mining is reported to have been carried out on this vein with 
historic production in the order of 1.5 million ounces (Moz) of silver.  The vein varies in 
width from 0.1 to 1.7 m and averages 0.5 m.  Low gold values in the 1 to 2 g/t range are 
occasionally obtained from both the La Cruz and La Rata veins. 
 
The La Cruz vein extends for a minimum horizontal distance of 500 m and mineralization 
was intersected as far down as 600 m below surface.  It dips to the south at between 55° and 
65° close to surface but steepens up to 85° at greater depths where recent drilling confirmed 
that the vein becomes part of a stockwork zone with disseminated to semi-massive sulphides 
hosted within a fault zone corridor following the monzonite-limestone contact.  This fault 
zone which widens at depth could be the main feeder for the mineralization on the San Diego 
property.  In that sense, it is very similar to the ECU's Santa Juana deposit where the most 
economically significant veins are the northwest-trending steeply dipping veins that also 
acted as the main conduit for the mineralizing fluids. 
 
9.1.1.2 Montanez Vein 
 
The Montanez vein is recognized in the eastern sector of the property and its extension into 
the western sector remains to be confirmed, although there are possibilities that the Montanez 
and La Cruz veins were once part of the same structure which was later offset along the 
north-northeast oriented Arroyo fault.  In the eastern sector, the vein has been traced over 
450 m.  The oxide portion of this vein has been mined down 25 m below surface to 
approximately the oxide/sulphide limit. 
 
The Montanez vein is spatially associated with a porphyritic monzonite sill that dips to the 
south at a steep angle of 85° to 87°.  Three individual mineralized zones are currently defined 
within the northwest trending Montanez structure.  They are, from south to north, the 
Hangingwall, the Centre and Footwall zones.  The Hangingwall and Footwall zones are 
respectively located along the upper and lower contact of the monzonite sill with the 
surrounding limestone whereas the Centre zone corresponds to a narrow fault affecting the 
middle portion of the sill.  The historically mined Montanez vein is contained within the 
Hangingwall zone. 
 
Some of the highest silver values obtained during the 2006 to 2007 drilling campaign came 
from the Montanez vein.  Silver values that ranged between 1 to 3 kg/t along with 8 to 15% 
lead and 9 to 11% zinc were obtained in drill holes SD-06-01 and -01A.  More recently, drill 
hole SD-08-26 returned assays of 1.8 kg/t silver over 1.25 m with 6.4% lead and 4.3% zinc 



 

 52

for the vein which confirms the presence of a very high grade silver area within the 
Hangingwall zone of the Montanez structure.  This area is located only 70 m below surface 
and has been defined over at least 120 m of strike extent at this time. 
 
One of the most significant discoveries of the 2006 to 2007 drilling campaign was the 
intersection of wider zones of mineralization (up to 20 m in horizontal width) along the 
hangingwall and footwall zones of the monzonite sill; this is in addition to the Montanez 
vein.  As mentioned earlier, this type of mineralized occurrence is quite similar to that of the 
Santa Maria mine of Peñoles located in the Velardeña mining camp.  At the San Diego 
project, mineralization identified in the contact zones consists of narrow sulphide stringers of 
sulphosalts with galena and/or sphalerite or else, sphalerite-galena-pyrite.  These stringers are 
hosted in skarn-altered limestones.  The bulk tonnage potential of the Montanez contact 
zones was further confirmed during the latest exploration drilling program with the 
intersection in drill hole SD-07-22 of a broad green skarn unit hosting silver-lead-zinc 
stringer mineralization in the Footwall portion of the Montanez zone. More specifically, 
polymetallic stringer-style mineralization was encountered over the last 150 m of drill hole 
SD-07-22 within the marble and skarn-altered limestones adjacent to the monzonite sill. The 
true thickness of the mineralized section was estimated to be 40 m confirming the extensive 
nature of mineralization in this area. 
 
Also during the latest exploration drilling, for first time at San Diego, high gold values 
associated with the silver-lead-zinc mineralization were encountered within the Centre Zone 
of the Montanez structure in drill hole SD-07-11.  This hole intersected multiple areas of 
mineralization including significant gold values that were associated with polymetallic 
mineralization similar to the pyrite-arsenopyrite-gold mineralization at ECU's Velardeña 
property.  The drill results for the Centre zone were 89 g/t silver over 7.10 m with 1.34% lead 
and 2.59% zinc, including 10.39 g/t gold, 129 g/t silver over 0.30 m with 2.02 % lead and 
7.70 % zinc. 
 
9.1.1.3 El Trovador Vein 
 
This is the most extensively worked vein on the San Diego property.  This vein has been 
worked over a strike length of 500 m and down to a depth of 220 metres.  The western part of 
the vein was accessible via the Viboras adit.  The vein is sub-vertical and varies in width 
from 0.10 to 1 m, and averages 0.45 m. 
 
9.1.1.4 San José Vein 
 
The San José vein is part of the group of veins that were historically mined at the San Diego 
property.  However, production from the two shallow shafts sunk on the vein is 
undocumented and presumed to have been relatively minor.  This vein, like the El Trovador 
vein, dips steeply to the north at 85°.  Wedge hole SD-07-21A completed to a depth of 887 m 
during the latest drilling program intersected a new zone of massive sulphides that coincides 
with the eastern extension of the San José vein (Figure 9.4).  The massive sulphide zone is 
hosted in hornfel-altered limestones and is believed to have formed from the replacement of 
the carbonaceous host-rock by sulphide-bearing solutions.  Like skarn-replacement, 



 

 53

carbonate-replacement type mineralization can form wide lenses of semi-massive to massive 
sulphide mineralization.  With the most recent drill intercept, the San José vein is now 
identified over 700 m of strike length and to a depth of 800 m below surface.

contained within a Massive Hornfel Altered Limestone.

9.1.1.5 Corridor Zone 
 
The Corridor zone in the western sector is host to a high grade gold zone (15.31 Au g/t over 
3.25 m) which was intersected in drill hole SD-07-08.  This zone corresponds to a slender 
unit of microfolded skarn with disseminated coarse grained pyrite, hosted in the central 
portion of the monzodiorite sill.  This mineralized occurrence is quite different from all 
others encountered so far on the San Diego property as it returned high gold values with no 
associated silver, lead or zinc.  Also, the gold-bearing pyrite consists of disseminations 
within the sheared intrusive or along the skarn/intrusive contact and is not hosted within a 
vein. 
 
9.1.2 East-West Trending Vein System 
 
The east-west trending vein system includes the La Rata, Cantarranas, Porvenir and SD 
veins. 
 
9.1.2.1 La Rata Vein 
 
The La Rata vein is one of the most extensive veins on the San Diego property and can be 
traced on surface over a distance of 750 m and at depth for 500 m.  The vein was historically 
mined down to a depth of about 140 m.  It is subvertical and rarely exceeds 1 m in true width 
and more commonly ranges from 20 to 80 cm in width.  The vein cuts across the entire 
property and is hosted in turns within the limestones and diorite with the widest and richest 



 

 54

intercept obtained in the limestone portions.  This is especially true of the recent mineralized 
intercept from drill hole SD-08-34 that returned a rich massive sulphide sections of 383 g/t 
silver, 6.8% lead and 12.7 % zinc over 6.55 m core length (Figure 9.5).

within a Partially Recrystallized Limestone Host Rock.

9.1.2.2 Cantarranas Vein and Ag Zone 
 
The Cantarranas vein can be followed over a distance of at least 550 m, it dips 80° south and 
has a true width varying from 20 to 60 cm.  The old workings on the vein do not exceed 40 m 
in depth and are located along the eastern contact of the diorite intrusive.  The drilling 
intersected the vein at a depth of 800 m below surface and showed that the structure hosting 
the vein becomes wider at depth.  In the near surface environment, the Cantarranas vein 
corresponds to a true fracture filling vein.  It occurs within weakly altered, massive grey 
limestones or diorite and hosts semi-massive sulphides (pyrite-sphalerite-galena) in a vuggy 
calcite gangue.  At approximately 400 m below surface, drill hole SD-08-33 intersected two 
semi-massive and massive sulphides zones located along favourable diorite/marble contacts, 
with associated sulphide replacement of adjacent marbles (Figure 9.6).  One of these zones 
can be linked to the Cantarranas vein and the other to the northwest trending broad Ag zone. 
 
In addition, assays results from drill hole SD-08-35 confirmed the existence of a broad low 
grade zone having an estimated horizontal width of a 100 m and located at a vertical depth of 
600 m below surface.  This very wide stringer-stockwork zone represents the merging point 
(both along strike and at depth) of three of the main mineralized structures at the San Diego 
property which are the Montanez Footwall, Cantarranas and Ag zones.  As such, this 
intersection bears similarities to the mineralized corridor at ECU's Santa Juana deposit.

9.1.2.3 Mid Zone 
 
The Mid zone is a new mineralized structure that was discovered during the most recent 
drilling completed during the 2008-2009 exploration program.  This zone is located in the 
newly drill tested area to the south-southeast on the property, between the Montanez zones 
and the San José vein.  The zone is interpreted as trending east-west with a 55° dip to the 
north.  Like the Ag zone and the Montanez Footwall zone, it is a broad stinger/stockwork 
zone hosted for the most part in a mixed endoskarn/exoskarn unit with sulphide stringers as 
well as sulphide bands and/or patches that are replacement zones.  This unit typically 
alternates between endoskarn sections characterized by a strong chloritization and a more 
deformed/shistosed aspect compared to the adjacent skarn-altered limestones.  No clear 
contacts are observed between the two skarns units.  Sulphide mineralization occurs as 
fracture filling stringers that quite often have become wider due to skarn replacement of the 
immediate host-rock.  Deep drilling conducted in this area has indicated that at depths greater 
than 600 to 800 m below surface, the sulphide minerals change from the more usual pyrite-
galena-sphalerite assemblage to a pyrite+/-pyrrhotite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite assemblage with 
variable amounts of arsenopyrite.  A strong, pervasive silicification affects the whole zone. 
 
9.1.2.4 Porvenir Vein 
 
The Porvenir vein is located in the northeastern portion of the property and is part of the 
group of veins that were historically mined on the San Diego property.  Production was 
conducted from an adit located at the bottom of a small diorite hill and from an internal shaft.  
The adit has some 36 m of horizontal distance and the shaft reaches down to depths of 70 to 
80 m.  There are no known records of past production for this vein.  The adit ceiling greatly 
varies in height from 1.5 m to more than 20 m in places where it actually reaches to the 
surface.  The vein is sub-vertical to steeply dipping south at 80 to 85° and ranges in width 
from 10 to 40 cm.  However, from the width of the adit, it can be shown that the vein was 
mined over wider sections of up to 2 m in some areas.  These wider areas or rooms 
correspond to intersection points between the east-west trending Porvenir vein and cross-
cutting narrow veins that are either orientated northeast (045°) or northwest (340°). 



 

 56

The adit level of the vein contains oxide material that changes to sulphide material at a 
vertical depth of about 30 m below the surface.  Numerous massive galena samples from the 
deeper workings are scattered around the vertical shaft sunk on the south side of the Porvenir 
vein.  These galena-silver rich samples are identical to samples collected at depth from the La 
Cruz vein.  Drill hole SD-07-27 confirmed the extension of the Porvenir vein to depths of 
200 m below surface. 
 
9.1.2.5 SD Vein 
 
The SD vein was discovered during the 2006 to 2007 drill program and does not reach 
surface.  The SD vein like the Cantarranas vein dips steeply to the south at 85° and is 
developed on the north side of the Grey fault zone whereas the Cantarranas vein is located on 
the south side of this fault. 
 
The SD vein could have a potential strike extension of nearly 450 m and it usually occurs as 
part of a set, with a subparallel vein occurring in close proximity.  This vein appears as a 
narrow calcite sulphide veinlet (galena-pyrite-sulphosalts) only a few centimetres wide (2 to 
8 cm true width). 
 
9.1.3 Northeast Trending Vein System 
 
9.1.3.1 El Jal and Canta-Splay Veins 
 
The Canta-Splay vein trends along the eastern contact of the diorite stock, dips to the 
northwest at 83° and has been traced over a distance of 300 m in drilling.  This narrow vein 
commonly occurs as black stringers of sulphosalts and sphalerite. 
 
The El Jal vein is oriented north 030° and dips to the southeast at 65°.  Historical workings 
on this vein are limited to a 40 m inclined shaft accessing one level.  The El Jal vein is traced 
laterally over nearly 650 m. and has a true width of 10 to 50 cm.  The El Jal vein is a true 
fracture-filling vein with limited or no alteration of the host rock. 
 
9.1.3.2 Arroyo Vein 
 
The Arroyo vein was intersected for first time during the exploration drilling in hole SD-07-
27 which collared into an oxide zone located beneath a dry stream bed with no bedrock 
exposures.  The vein orientation coincides with the general structural trend defined in the 
northeastern corner of the property from surface features such as ravines, stream beds and 
trenches done on nearby veins located outside the property limits.   
 
The vein has been traced over a strike length distance of 500 m.  The mineralized intercept 
from drill hole SD-07-27 returned values of 177 g/t silver over 7.25 m including 474 g/t 
silver over 1.20 m.

10.0 EXPLORATION 
 
A description of the historical exploration work conducted on the San Diego project is 
provided in Section 6 of this report.  Only the 2007 to 2008 and the 2008 to 2009 exploration 
programs, respectively Phase 3 and Phase 4, will be discussed in this section.  Together, the 
Phase 3 (6,654.40 m) and the Phase 4 (2,722.10 m) drilling programs entailed the completion 
of 9,376.5 m of diamond drilling.  Therefore, the total metres drilled on the San Diego 
property since August, 2006 is 15,967 m.  The exploration programs by Golden Tag and 
ECU are discussed in the previous NI 43-101 report by Micon entitled "NI 43-101 Technical 
Report, Review of the Mineral Resource Estimate for the San Diego Project, Velardeña 
Mining District Durango State, Mexico" dated January 20, 2008. 
 
10.1 2007 to 2008 EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 
The 2007 to 2008 exploration program was conducted between October, 2007 and March, 
2008.  The program entailed the completion of 6,654 m of drilling with a total of 5,686 core 
samples assayed systematically for gold, silver, lead, zinc copper, arsenic and occasionally 
for antimony.  The sampling procedures included the systematic inclusion of standards and 
property specific blank samples.  At the end of the campaign, all drill collars were surveyed 
by ECU's mine surveyor. 
 
A geochemical study conducted from whole rock analysis performed on selected samples 
was completed in June, 2008 by Anne-Sophie Renou of Modèlaur Enr. of Val-d'Or, Canada. 
 
All pertinent geological information gathered from the drilling activities, including 
mineralization, alteration, and structural data, were interpreted first on hand-drawn cross-
sections and surface plans.  Once completed, the geological interpretation was transposed 
into ECU's MineSight database.  For the purposes of the current resource estimate, ProMine 
software was used to generated longitudinal sections with polygons and perform all 
composite calculations from the drill assay results. 
 
Expenditures for the 2007 to 2008 exploration drilling program as of July 31, 2008 are 
presented in Table 10.1.  The 15% Mexican value added tax (IVA) is not included in these 
expenditures as it is recovered by ECU and Golden Tag.

10.1.1 Overview of the 2007 to 2008 Exploration Results 
 
The objectives of the 2007-08 drilling program were to test or evaluate: 
 

1. Additional extensions along strike and at depth on all veins, in particular the La Cruz, 
Cantarranas and Montanez veins. 

 
2. The zones of stringer and skarn-type alteration and mineralization which may have 

the potential to be bulk mined. 
 
3. The potential for alternative styles of mineralization such as the Corridor zone which 

contains a high grade gold intersection of 15.31 g/t gold over 3.25 m. 
 
4. In-fill drilling on the currently identified zones. 
 

Explorations results for the 2007 to 2008 drilling program met all expectations as: 
 

1) A new environment of green skarn-hosted sulphides was identified in the highly 
prospective eastern sector of the property. 

 
2) The potential for massive to semi-massive sulphide (manto-type) zones to have 

developed from replacement of marble and skarn was identified 
 
3) The continuity was confirmed both laterally and vertically of the known high grade 

polymetallic veins. 
 
The geochemical study prepared by Modèlaur confirmed that the various intrusive bodies 
observed on the property originate from the same magma chamber and were produced over 
time from fractional crystallization.  Analysis for major and trace elements as well as rare 
earths confirmed a unique island-arc type magmatic source for all of the samples.  The high 
potassic signature shared by all samples points to a mature orogenic system. 
 
10.2 2008 to 2009 EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 
The 2008 to 2009 exploration program was initiated on September 2, 2008 at the San Diego 
property and is currently active.  To date, three drill holes including a wedge hole, totalling 
2,722.10 m have been completed.  A total of 3,040 samples were assayed systematically for 
gold, silver, lead, zinc copper, arsenic, antimony and occasionally for iron.  The sampling 
procedures continue to include the systematic inclusion of standards and property specific 
blank samples.  The drill hole collars will be surveyed at the end of the present campaign by 
ECU's mine surveyor. 
 
As part of the ongoing QA/QC program, 278 check assays were performed by the SGS 
certified laboratory in Durango on rejects of samples from the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 
drill programs (Phase 1 to 3) which were originally assayed at the ALS-Chemex facilities in 
Guadalajara and Vancouver. 



 

 59

All information obtained for the current drill program was processed using the same 
approach described for the previous program with the geological interpretation being first 
completed on paper cross-sections and surface plans and then transferred into the MineSight 
database.  As well, ProMine software was used to generated longitudinal sections with 
polygons and perform all composite calculations from the drill hole assay results. 
 
Exploration expenditures as of November 30, 2008 for the 2008-2009 drilling program 
currently underway are presented in Table 10.2.  The 15% Mexican value added tax (IVA) is 
not included in these expenditures as it is recovered by ECU and Golden Tag.

10.2.1 Overview of the 2008 to 2009 Exploration Results 
 
The 2008 to 2009 program should entail the completion of approximately 5,000 m of drilling 
aimed at testing the highly prospective area between the merging Montanez and Cantarranas 
fault zones, adjacent to the central diorite eastern contact, between 600 to 800 m below 
surface.  More specifically, it is designed to confirm and expand upon: 
 

1. The massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization hosted in manto-type 
replacement zones in marble and skarns. 

 
2. The polymetallic stringer-stockwork mineralization hosted in a green skarn unit along 

the Footwall portion of the Montanez Zone.  
 
To date, the results from the 2008 to 2009 drilling program have proved to be highly 
successful as: 
 

• A new mineralized skarn area was identified to the south of the Montanez vein along 
with associated stringer-style mineralization which appears to define a broad zone 
with bulk tonnage potential. 

 
• A wide corridor of stringer-style mineralization was identified at the merging point of 

the Ag zone, Montanez and Cantarranas vein structures. 
 



 

 60

• Potential for manto-type replacement zones was further confirmed by the discovery 
of a massive sulphide carbonate replacement zone linked to the San José vein 
structure. 

 
These recent discoveries have contributed in a significant way to the large increase in the 
current resource estimate when compared to the resource estimate completed in December, 
2007.

11.0 DRILLING 
 
A description of the historical work conducted on the property is provided in Section 6.  The 
results obtained during the 2006 to 2007 preliminary drilling program are discussed in the 
previous NI 43-101 report by Micon entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report, Review of the 
Mineral Resource Estimate for the San Diego Project, Velardeña Mining District Durango 
State, Mexico" dated January 20, 2008.  Therefore, this section will focus on describing the 
results obtained during the 2007 to 2008 surface drilling program followed with the 
description of the 2008 to 2009 programs. 
 
11.1 2007 to 2008 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 
The third phase of the diamond drilling campaign was conducted between October 2, 2007 
and March 24, 2008 and totalled 6,654.4 m.  During this phase of drilling, 15 new drill holes 
numbered SD-07-18 to SD-08-33 were completed along with an extension to a previous drill 
hole (SD-07-11).  Table 11.1 summarizes the details of this drilling phase for the San Diego 
project.

Drilling was carried out using two full hydraulic drills owned and operated by Canmex 
Diamond Drill S.A. de C.V. (Canmex) and Maza Diamond Drilling S.A. de C.V. (Maza 
Drilling), both companies from Mazatlan, Sinaloa in Mexico.  Figure 11.1 is a view of Maza 
Drilling's hydraulic drill at the San Diego property.

The majority of the third phase of diamond drilling was carried out using NQ sized drill rods 
(inside diameter 60.3 mm) except where, due to technical problems, the rod size was reduced 
to BQ (inside diameter 45.9 mm). 
 
As in the previous 2006 to 2007 drilling programs, the core recovery was generally good and 
ranged from 90 to 100%.  Lower core recovery levels were obtained from the wide fault 
zones where the core was comprised of fractured and rubbly material as well as carbonate-
clay rich gouge material.  Recovery levels were also occasionally lower in some of the 
mineralized zones affected by faulting where lower recoveries occur no matter whether it is 
oxide or sulphide mineralization.  This occurred across the La Cruz vein intercept in hole 
SD-07-18 which included several sections of unrecovered sulphide mineralization.  All 
sections of non-recovered core were identified on cross-sections and in logs with the 
acronym CNR, for core not recovered.  Zero assay grades were attributed to these intervals 
when calculating the grade for the drill hole intercepts. 
 
Cavern like, open spaces ranging from to 2 to 4 m in width were intersected in the western 
(SD-08-30) and eastern sectors (SD-07-21) of the property.  Numerous technical problems 
plagued the Phase 3 that were attributed to the driller's general lack of experience and 
inadequate equipment coupled with the occasional difficult ground conditions in fault zones.  
Together, these problems resulted in several holes being abandoned before completion 
including holes SD-07-20, 07-21 and 07-22 which were stopped short of their planned target 
on the Montanez vein. 
 



 

 63

Drill hole orientation surveys were routinely taken every 50 to 100 m down the hole using a 
Tropari instrument owned by ECU.  However, many of the azimuth readings had to be 
discarded due to the magnetic influence of the diorite intrusive at the centre of the property. 
 
In accordance with current Mexican environmental regulations, the drill work was planned in 
order to reduce the impact of drilling activities on the environment to a minimum.  In order to 
do this ECU and Golden Tag took the existing roads into consideration when planning the 
drill hole locations and used the pre-existing roads to move machinery between the drill 
platforms to avoid disturbing the vegetation coverage.  However, after drill holes SD-07-20 
and 07-22 failed to reach their proposed targets on the Montanez vein, a drill road was 
constructed in the steep hills in the southern portion of the property in order to complete the 
evaluation of the Hangingwall zone and test the Footwall zone further at depth.  Drill hole 
SD-08-33, drilled from south to north, was completed from this road. 
 
Except for drill holes SD-07-20 and SD-08-30, all casings were left in place, capped and 
individually labelled at the end of the campaign.  Drill hole collars were surveyed by ECU's 
surveyor and referenced under the same UTM system (WGS84) used for the previous 2006 
to 2007 drill programs. 
 
All core samples were assayed by ALS-Chemex at its laboratory facilities in Guadalajara 
(Mexico) and Vancouver (Canada). 
 
11.1.1 2007 to 2008 Drilling Program Results 
 
During the third phase of the drilling program, ECU and Golden Tag completed 15 new drill 
holes plus an extension of one previous hole for a total of 6,654 m.  The drill holes were 
targeted to intersect the following veins and/or zones: La Cruz, La Rata, Montanez 
(Hangingwall, Footwall and Centre), Cantarranas, El Jal, Canta-Splay, SD Vein and the 
Corridor zone.  Every drill hole completed during this campaign intersected significant 
mineralization either associated with their projected targets or in some cases, with new 
mineralized structures.  The success of this phase of drilling translated into increased strike 
length and/or depth extensions for all of the previously known zones except the Corridor 
zone where drilling failed to prove additional extensions. Table 11.2 is a summary of the 
significant intersections encountered during the 2007 to 2008 drilling program.

A description of the individual drill holes is presented below according to the sectors of the 
property in which they were drilled.  The north-northeast Arroyo fault is the natural division 
marking the limits between the eastern and western sectors whereas the northeastern sector 
represents the flat valley area extending to the northeast of the central diorite intrusion. 
 
Western Sector 
 
Hole SD-07-18 was drilled beneath previous holes SD-06-02 and SD-07-07, which were the 
first holes in the 2006 to 2007 programs to identify the broader zones of mineralization on 
the property.  Drill hole SD-07-18 confirmed the extension of the major fault zone to a depth 
of 600 m below the surface.  This hole was also successful in intersecting three individual 
mineralized zones as well as the high grade La Cruz vein.  However, due to the low recovery 
levels in the fault zones, some sections from the mineralized zones were not recovered. 
 
Drill holes SD-08-30, 08-31 and 08-32 were drilled from the same set-up.  Hole SD-08-30 
was abandoned before completion after it encountered a 2-m wide void at a down hole depth 
of 107.75 m.  The primary target of this group of holes was to expand on the Corridor zone 
high grade gold intersection (15.31 g/t gold over 3.25 m) obtained in drill hole SD-07-08 
during the previous campaign.  No significant mineralized extensions to the Corridor zone 
were encountered in these holes; however, all three holes confirmed the presence of an oxide 
zone located 100 m below the surface which represents the western extension of the Rata 
vein that is possibly merging with the Montanez vein in this area.  The assay results from 
these holes are in line with similar results obtained from drill holes SD-07-08, 07-16 and 07-
17 drilled during the 2006 to 2007 programs. 
 
Eastern Sector  
 
Drill holes SD-07-19, -07-21, 08-26, 08-28 and 08-29 were drilled to in-fill on the mineral 
resources outlined for the Cantarranas and Montanez veins.  Together, these holes covered 
over 250 m of strike length.  Drill hole SD-07-19 drilled farther to the east returned robust 
grades above 1 kg silver for the Cantarranas vein and confirmed the eastern extension of the 
Montanez zones 300 m below surface.  In addition, this hole encountered a new stringer zone 



 

 66

hosting high silver mineralization that was interpreted to be the eastern extension of the Ag 
zone. 
 
Holes SD-08-26, 08-28 and 08-29 were relatively short holes planned to expand on the 
indicated resources outlined on the Montanez vein.  Hole SD-08-26 intersected high silver 
assays of 1.8 kg/t silver over 1.25 m with 6.4% lead and 4.3% zinc that better defined a silver 
rich area within the Hangingwall portion of the Montanez zones.  This area is located only 
70 m below surface and occurs over a strike length of 120 m.  Information gathered from 
drill hole SD-07-26 also indicated that the east-west trending Cantarranas vein, like La Cruz 
and Montanez vein structures, is associated with a major fault zone, in this case, the Grey 
fault zone. 
 
Drill hole SD-07-24 was a step-out hole behind hole SD-07-10 to follow-up on both a near 
surface oxide zone called the Oxi-Zone that had previously returned high silver grades up to 
969 g/t silver over 0.45 m and 627 g/t silver over 0.95 m, and to intersect the La Rata vein at 
depth.  Drill results confirmed the extension of the La Rata vein to a depth of 500 m below 
surface.  The drill hole SD-07-24 intersection with the La Rata vein graded 1,100 g/t silver 
and 2.4 g/t gold over 0.65 m with 12.6% lead, 6% zinc and 0.6% copper.  A new geological 
feature was also intersected at depth and appears to correspond to a redox zone (reduction-
oxidation front) which developed along a narrow, steeply-dipping fault zone with extensive 
hematite replacement.  The redox zone acted as geochemical trap for gold and copper with 
assays from this zone returning 5.6 g/t gold over 1.30 m with 1% copper. 
 
Drill holes SD-07-20, 07-22 and 08-33 were drilled on the same section along the diorite's 
eastern contact area.  Holes SD-07-20 and 07-22 were planned to hit the Montanez vein 
structure at a depth of 150 m and 450 m below surface, respectively.  However, both holes 
failed to reach the Montanez Hangingwall and Centre zones due to drilling problems caused 
by fault zones.  Nonetheless, the two holes proved very successful as they cut through a new 
zone of mineralized marble hosting thin, silver-rich sulphide stringers that returned assay 
grades as high as 4,420 g/t silver over 0.58 m.  This silver-rich stringer zone which was 
called the Ag zone is interpreted to have a similar orientation to the Montanez vein 
(northwest trending with a steep dip to the south).  Of similar importance is the intersection 
at the bottom of hole 07-22 which has been defined as a broad green skarn-hosted 
polymetallic stringer zone which is believed to be the extension of the Montanez Footwall 
zone.  The zone was cross-cut over a distance of 33 m which corresponds to an estimated true 
width of 11 m. 
 
Drill hole SD-08-33 intersected two semi-massive to massive sulphide zones located along 
diorite/marble contacts one of which is interpreted as the Cantarranas vein/zone.  The 
Cantarranas vein/zone returned 165 g/t silver over 8.10 m with 4.2% lead and 4.6% zinc.  
Drilling indicates that this zone is getting wider at depth, as well as approaching closer to the 
Ag zone.  The two zones define a mineralized envelope with a true thickness of at least 20 m.  
The other sulphide zone which has been named the Contact zone returned a grade of 140 g/t 
silver over 2.80 m along with 4% lead and 3.6% zinc at a diorite/marble contact not 
previously intersected by the drilling.  A cross-section of drill holes SD-07-20, 07-22 and 
SD-08-33 is presented in Figure 11.2.

Northeastern Sector 
 
Drill holes SD-07-23, 07-25 and 07-27 extended the El Jal vein to the northeast and brings its 
confirmed strike length from 400 to 500 m.  Drilling also uncovered two new silver-rich 
veins within 15 m of surface, the Arroyo Zone and Vein N040°, associated with the prevalent 
northeast trending fracture system in this sector.  Drill hole SD-07-27 also confirmed the 
extension of the historical Porvenir vein to a depth of 200 m below surface.  This vein had 
never been tested by drilling prior to hole SD-07-27. 



 

 68

Overall, the 2007 to 2008 drilling campaign completed on the San Diego project proved to be 
highly successful.  The information gathered by this program indicates that: 
 

• The vein systems on the San Diego property have exceptional lateral extension and 
vertical continuity.  The recent drilling extended the Cantarranas and La Cruz vein 
structures to depths of 600 and 800 m below the surface, respectively, and the La 
Rata vein to over 750 m of demonstrated strike length. 

 
• In addition to the extensive polymetallic vein system, the San Diego property offers 

the potential for the discovery of replacement (manto-type) sulphide zones as 
suggested by the drill intersection of two massive to semi-massive sulphides zones 
located along favourable diorite/marble contacts in hole SD-08-33. 

 
• The presence of wide zones of green skarn (exoskarn) units hosting silver-lead-zinc 

stringer mineralization demonstrates the extensive nature of the mineralization 
located at depth around the central diorite intrusion and, in the footwall portion of the 
Montanez zone, adjacent to the monzonite sill. 

 
• There is a general trend at depth of increasing skarn and marble alteration along with 

a change in deformation styles from brittle to ductile along with improving metal 
grades and widths. 

 
• A new geological feature has been identified which possibly corresponds to a 

reduction-oxidation front that acted as a geochemical trap for gold and copper. 
Assays from this zone returned 5.6 g/t gold over 1.30 m with 1% copper in hole SD-
07-24. 

 
• The presence in the eastern sector of two major fault zones, the northwest-southeast 

trending Montanez zone and the east-west oriented Cantarranas zone (Grey fault) that 
are host to major polymetallic veins with an associated stringer package.  These two 
zones are expected to merge together forming a V-shape pattern representing a major 
structural target. 

 
• There is a large diversity of mineralized environments that goes well beyond the 

initial high grade-narrow vein type of mineralization that initially attracted the 
attention of the joint venture partners. 
 

In view of the exploration results obtained during the 2007 to 2008 program, ECU and 
Golden Tag planned a follow-up phase of exploration drilling to test for the presence of  
broad manto-type massive sulphide zones as well as wide stringer-stockwork zones hosted in 
skarn units at vertical depths of 600 to 800 m below surface.  To this effect, a 5,000 m drill 
contract was signed in June, 2008 with Layne de Mexico S.A. de C.V. (Layne de Mexico) to 
supply a truck-mounted drill with deep drilling capacity.

11.2 2008 TO 2009 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 
The fourth phase of the diamond drilling campaign was initiated on September 2, 2008 and 
remains underway at the time of writing this report.  So far in this campaign, two deep holes 
(SD-08-34 and 08-35) and the wedging of a previous hole (SD-07-21A) have been completed 
for a total of 2,722.10 m of HQ and NQ drilling.  Table 11.3 summarizes the details of the 
fourth phase of diamond drilling for the San Diego project, to date.  The collars of these drill 
holes will only be surveyed at the end of the present campaign.  The coordinates listed in 
Table 11.3 were measured with a portable global positioning survey (GPS) instrument and 
are not the final coordinates for these holes.

Drilling is being conducted using a truck-mounted CS-1500 hydraulic drill designed for deep 
hole drilling that is owned and operated by Layne de Mexico of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico 
(Figure 11.3). 
 
For the two deep holes drilled during the program so far, HQ size drill rods (inside diameter 
77.8 mm) were used down to 400 to 500 m in the hole at which point the holes were reduced 
to NQ size rods to keep drilling costs down. 
 
Core recovery levels have so far been the best at the project, even within fault zones where 
there were often sections of unrecovered core.  The increased recovery level is attributed to 
the drill crew experience and ample use of additives including bentonite. 
 
Down hole survey orientation readings are being taken every 100 to 150 m using a Flex-It 
instrument owned by Layne de Mexico.  This instrument appeared to be less affected by the 
magnetic nature of the diorite intrusion and most of the azimuth readings were used for 
drawing the hole deviation. 
 
As in the previous programs, drill hole casings are being left in and fitted with metal caps 
bearing the respective hole numbers to ensure better visibility and future referencing. 
 
All core samples continue to be assayed by ALS-Chemex at its laboratory facilities in 
Guadalajara (Mexico) and Vancouver (Canada).

11.2.1 2008 to 2009 Drilling Program Results 
 
So far during the drilling program, ECU and Golden Tag have completed two deep holes and 
wedged a previous hole for a total of 2,722.10 m of HQ and NQ drilling.  The drill holes 
were targeted to follow-up on the green-skarn-hosted polymetallic stringer zones and the 
massive sulphide zones of mineralization intersected in the eastern sector of the property 
during the previous program.  More specifically, the planned targets for these holes were the 
following veins and/or zones: Montanez (Hanging Wall, Footwall and Centre), Cantarranas, 
Ag zone, La Rata and SD veins.  The drill holes completed so far during this campaign have 
intersected significant mineralization either associated with their projected targets or in some 
cases, new mineralized structures such as the Mid-Zone and the San José vein.  This is 
translating into increased strike lengths and/or extension at depth which, along with the 
newly discovered zones, have so far contributed in a significant way to the current resource 
estimate.  Table 11.4 is a summary of the significant intersections encountered during the 
2008 to 2009 drilling program.

Hole SD-08-34 was drilled to follow at depth one of the various mineralized zones 
intersected in drill holes SD-07-20, 07-22 and 08-33.  This hole cut a massive sulphide 
section corresponding to the Rata vein at a depth of 300 m below the surface and confirmed 
the extension of that vein to the east.  The mineralized intersection included several 
intercepts grading over 500 g/t silver, over 8% lead and over 20% zinc (Table 11.4).  Further 
at depth, drill hole SD-08-34 also intersected a wide polymetallic stringer/stockwork zone 
that stretched over 50 m from 675 to 725 m.  This intersection represents the depth and 
eastern extension of the stringer-style mineralization as well as massive and semi-massive 
sulphide veins which were interpreted in drill holes SD-08-22 and SD-08-33 for the 
Cantarranas, Ag zone and Montanez zones.  Mineralization in this zone consists of mostly 
narrow (+/- 1 cm) stringers with a few semi-massive to massive veins reaching up to 25 to 30 
cm (true width).  Additionally, a richer section was intersected over 4.20 m from 685.90 to 
690.10 m which included up to 60% sulphides occurring within stringers and replacement 
patches within the white marble host-rock.  The overall intersection is strongly silicified and 
with chlorite-hematite alteration directly associated to the sulphides.  Further at depth, the 
drill hole intersected a massive to semi-massive sulphide intercept grading 181 g/t silver over 
1.35 m with 10% lead and zinc that correlates with the San José vein.  
 
Drill-hole SD-07-21A intersected a new massive sulphide zone in the southeastern corner of 
the property where no exploration drilling had previously occurred.  The massive sulphide 
zone is hosted in grey limestones and is believed to have formed from the replacement of the 
carbonaceous host-rock by sulphide-bearing solutions.  Like skarn-replacement, carbonate-
replacement type mineralization can form wide lenses of semi-massive to massive sulphide 
mineralization.  The new massive sulphide zone coincides with the eastern extension of the 
San José Vein, a northwest trending structure located south of the Montanez vein.  The 



 

 72

massive sulphide zone consists of a solid section of 85 to 95% coarse grained sulphides with 
5 to15% calcite gangue.  The new zone is hosted in undeformed, hornfel-altered limestones. 
It has an estimated 5 m true width and was intersected approximately 400 m below the valley 
floor. 
 
Drill hole SD-08-35, is a 70 m step-out hole to the west of hole SD-08-34.  The main 
objective of this hole was to intersect the junction point of the east-west trending Cantarranas 
vein with the northwest trending Ag zone and Montanez vein defining a V-shape structure.  
At the projected intersection point of these three structures, at depth, drill hole SD-08-35 
cross-cut a very wide section of polymetallic stringers and veins stretching over nearly 200 m 
from 618 to 808 m down the hole.  This mineralized section straddles the faulted contact 
between the main diorite intrusive located at the centre of property and the adjacent marble 
and skarn-altered limestones.  It now appears that this northwest trending contact is a major 
structure transecting the whole property that would connect the Montanez zone defined in the 
eastern sector of the property with the La Cruz zone outlined in the western sector.  Assay 
results for the whole zone returned 40 g/t silver over 190.55 m with 0.8% lead and 0.9% zinc.  
The average elevation for this merged zone is 600 m below surface with an estimated true 
width of 100 m.  Within this wide corridor, individual intersections for the following veins 
and/or zones were defined: Cantarranas, Ag zone, Montanez, Mid-zone and San José. 
 
With its extensive width and structurally controlled mineralization, this new mineralized 
occurrence bears similarities to the 100 m wide mineralized corridor defined by ECU at its 
Santa Juana operation. 
 
The current phase of drilling is ongoing and only those results available at the time of the 
completion of the resource estimate in early December, 2008 could be included.  Therefore, 
only those assay results down to 808 m were incorporated in the current resource estimate, 
leaving aside the remaining portion of hole 08-35 that reached a final depth of 1,093 m and 
where additional mineralization was encountered.  This mineralization would pertain to the 
deep, new skarn environment that is starting to emerge in the south-southeast portion of the 
property. 
 
Like the previously completed programs, the follow-up 2008 to 2009 drilling campaign 
undertaken on the San Diego project is proving to be successful.  The information gathered 
by this program so far has confirmed the: 
 

• Potential for carbonate as well as skarn replacement-type sulphide mineralization 
capable of generating broad lenses of massive mineralization. 

 
• General trend of increasing skarn and marble alteration at depth along with a change 

of deformation style from brittle to ductile, and the improving metal grades and 
widths at depth. 

 
• Mylonitic shear zones intersected at depth are favourable host to both base and 

precious metal mineralization including gold. 
 



 

 73

• Presence of a new mineralized skarn environment to the south-southeast of the 
property  associated with polymetallic stringers-style and disseminated sulphide 
mineralization 

 
• Broad hornfel alteration aureole which is related to the newly identified skarn 

environment that affects all units whether it is the skarns, the intrusives or the 
limestone. 

 
• Mineralization at the San Diego property occurs in a variety of settings that include: 

 
1) High grade narrow vein-type occurrences. 
 
2) Carbonate and skarn replacement (manto-type) sulphide zones. 
 
3) Wide structurally controlled corridors of sulphide stringers and veins with 

some skarn replacement. 
 
4) Breccia zones either formed due to faulting or as epithermal chimney pipes 

 
The combined exploration success and additional information gathered from the 2007 to 
2008 and 2008 to 2009 programs have led to a better understanding and a re-interpretation of 
the mineralization on the San Diego property and prompted the completion of an updated 
mineral resource estimate.  Through its increased knowledge of the property, ECU and 
Golden Tag believe that they will be able to build upon the existing mineral resources in their 
future exploration programs. 
 
The 2007 to 2008 drill program represented a total exploration expenditure of US $1,722,658 
as of July 31, 2008.  A follow-up drilling program entailing 5,000 m and expenditures of 
US $1,215,500 commenced on September 2, 2008.  The exploration expenditures for the 
2008 to 2009 program as of November 30, 2008 are US $664,143. 
 
Figure 11.4 is a map showing the locations of drill holes from the all drilling programs 
conducted by ECU and Golden Tag to date.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
If available, the descriptions of the historical sampling methods and approaches for the San 
Diego project have been previously provided in Section 6 of this report. 
 
12.1 SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND CHIP SAMPLING 
 
Since the last resource estimate filed in January 2008, a limited amount of underground chip 
sampling has been performed on the San Diego property.  In May, 2008, ECU and Golden 
Tag took a total of 14 chip samples using the same sampling method as that used to collect 
the chip samples in 1999.  The 1999 sampling methods are described in Section 6 of this 
report.  The sampling was conducted on the historically mined Porvenir vein located in the 
northeastern corner of the property.  The chip samples were taken from inside an adit located 
at the bottom of a small diorite hill and from an internal inclined shaft.  The adit has an 
approximate horizontal distance of 36 m and the shaft reaches down to depths of 70 to 80 m.  
The height of the adit roof varies greatly from approximately 1.5 m to more than 20 m in 
places, where it actually reaches surface.  Assay results from the underground sampling are 
reported in Table 12.1. 
 
12.2 DRILL CORE SAMPLING PROTOCOL 
 
During the 2007 to 2008 drill campaign, a total of 5,686 samples of NQ and BQ size core 
were systematically assayed for gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic and occasionally for 
antimony.  For the 2008 to 2009 campaign currently underway, sampling from the three 
completed holes represents a total of 3,040 samples of HQ and NQ size core. 
 
All core samples assays from both programs were performed at the ALS-Chemex laboratory 
facilities in Vancouver (Canada) with the sample preparation conducted at its Guadalajara 
facility (Mexico).  The sampling procedures included the systematic inclusion of standards 
and property specific blank samples. 
 
The drill hole core samples were split in half with a hydraulic core splitter (Figure 12.1) with 
one half sent for assaying while the second half was retained as a witness sample for future 
geological reference or re-assaying should it be deemed necessary. 
 
Sampling was conducted not only on core with visible evidence of mineralization, such as 
veins and stringers, but also on barren core to preserve the sampling continuity in between 
mineralized zones and to test for broad zones of lower grade material as well. 
 
The core sampling protocol is as follows: 
 

1) For mineralized intervals from HQ, NQ or BQ size core, the drill core samples have a 
minimum core length of 20 cm and a maximum length of 1 m with most of the 
samples not exceeding 50 cm.

The sampling procedure includes the insertion of commercially prepared standards and 
property specific blanks collected from similar geological units, at regular intervals equating 
to every 25 samples. 
 
Information recorded in the drill log by the project geologist describing the core includes the 
depth, core length, true width, as well as observations concerning rock type, deformation, 
alteration, fault zones and nature of mineralization (oxide, sulphide or mixed), the name of 
the vein if possible, and core angles.  All observations are entered into GeoBase, a drill hole 
database management software program using Microsoft Access, created and supported by 
Geostat Systems International Inc. of Montreal (Canada). 
 
All core boxes are stored outside on site.  Each individual core box is identified with 
aluminium metallic tags labelled by a dymo with the drill hole number.  The boxes are cross 
piled on pallets and each pallet carries a number for quick reference (Figure 12.2).  A local 
watchman is hired to guard the site at all time.

The significant core intersections at the San Diego property have been previously recorded in 
Section 11 in Table 11.2 for the 2007 to 2008 drilling program and Table 11.4 for the drilling 
to date for the 2008 to 2009 program.  Due to the large number of relevant samples included 
in the resource estimate the remaining core intersections and composites have not been 
tabulated either in this section or in this report.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
If available the descriptions of the historical sample preparation, analysis and security for the 
San Diego project have been previously provided in Section 6 of this report.  The sample 
preparation, analysis and security for the 2006 to 2007 preliminary drilling program were 
discussed in the previous NI 43-101 report by Micon dated January 20, 2008.  Therefore, this 
section will focus on describing the sample preparation, analysis and security during the 2007 
to 2008 surface drilling program and the current 2008 to 2009 programs. 
 
13.1 SAMPLING PREPARATION AND SECURITY 
 
The drill hole core samples were split in half with a hydraulic core splitter, on site, with one 
half sent for assaying while the second half was retained as a witness sample for future 
geological reference or re-assaying should it be deemed necessary. 
 
Sampling was conducted on core not only with visible evidence of mineralization, such as 
veins and stringers, but also on barren core to preserve the sampling continuity in between 
mineralized zones and to test for broad zones of lower grade material as well. 
 
The mineralized intervals for the drill core samples from HQ, NQ or BQ size core have a 
minimum core length of 20 cm and a maximum length of 1 m with most of the samples not 
exceeding 50 cm.  Core sampled outside the mineralized intervals encountered have a 
maximum sample length of 1.20 m for the HQ and NQ core and a maximum sample length 
of 1.50 m for BQ core. 
 
Samples are bagged at the project site and delivered by the project geologist to Paqueteria, a 
local courier in Torreón.  From Torreón they are shipped to the ALS-Chemex facility in 
Guadalajara for preparation.  All samples are presently assayed systematically for gold, 
silver, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic, antimony and iron.  Commercially prepared standards and 
property specific blanks collected from similar geological units are inserted at regular 
intervals. 
 
In January, 2008, ECU and Golden Tag rehabilitated one of the old adobe houses on site as a 
warehouse in order to be able to securely store the sample rejects and pulps on site rather 
than at the assay laboratories (Figure 13.1). 
 
13.2 ASSAYING PROCEDURES 
 
All the sample preparation and assaying for the 2007 to 2009 drilling programs were 
performed at the ALS-Chemex laboratory facilities in Guadalajara (Mexico) and Vancouver 
(Canada).  The ALS-Chemex Guadalajara laboratory conducted the sample preparation and 
then sent the pulps by plane to the Vancouver laboratory for assaying.

The sample preparation includes the following procedures and operations: 
 

1) Log sample into the tracking system. 
 
2) Record the weight of material received from the client. 
 
3) Crush chips and/or drill core samples to finer than 70% -2 mm. 
 
4) Split sample using a riffle splitter. 
 
5) Pulverize the split (up to 250 g) to a particle size finer than 85% < 75 micron. 

 
Once the sample is pulverized the following assay methods are then applied to the sample: 
 

• Gold assays are routinely performed using fire assay (FA) with atomic absorption 
(AA) finish (method Au-AA23).  High gold assays are automatically re-assayed using 
a FA with gravimetric finish (method Au-GRA21). 

 
• Silver assays are routinely performed using aqua regia digestion (method AA45).  

The AA45 assaying method has an upper detection limit of 100 g/t Ag.  Since the 
beginning of April, 2007, all assays above 100 g/t Ag are automatically re-assayed 
using FA with gravimetric finish (method Ag-GRA21).  Before April, values above 
100 g/t were first re-assayed by aqua regia with AA finish (AA46), and in the case of 



 

 81

silver values above the upper detection limit of 1,000 g/t, they were subsequently re-
assayed using FA with gravimetric finish. 

 
• Copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, antimony and iron assays are routinely performed by aqua 

regia digestion (method ICP41).  All copper, lead, zinc and arsenic assays above the 
upper detection limits of 10,000 ppm are automatically re-assayed using aqua regia 
digestion with AA finish (method OG46). 

 
• Silver, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic assays from readily identified mineralized zones 

in core were at times assayed with method ME-OG 62 that determines ore grade 
elements by four acid digestion. 

 
Table 13.1 summarizes the detection limits for each of the assaying methods.

13.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) PROGRAM 
 
ECU and Golden Tag implemented a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program 
for the San Diego project at the beginning of the 2006 to 2007 drill program in August, 2006 
which continues to be applied to the exploration programs.  It consists of the insertion of 
commercially prepared reference material and property specific blanks collected from nearby 
dry stream beds. 
 
Standards and blanks were systematically inserted into the sampling sequence in order to 
have 2 blanks and 2 standards per 100 samples.  ECU and Golden Tag used the following 
method for insertion: 
 

• Sample Numbers ending in '50 and '00 are used for standards. 
• Sample Numbers ending in '25 and '75 are used for blanks. 

 
Comparative tables of standard assay results were produced in which relative and absolute 
errors were calculated.  The tables are included in Appendix 1.  A total of 112 blanks and 114 



 

 82

standards were sent for assay to ALS-Chemex through the course of the 2007 to 2009 drilling 
programs.  The relative errors for the standard assays ranging from 2 to 7% with an average 
relative error value of 4%. 
 
As part of the ongoing QA/QC program, 278 check assays were performed at the SGS 
certified laboratory in Durango on sample rejects from the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 drill 
programs (Phase 1 to 3) originally assayed at ALS-Chemex facilities of Guadalajara and 
Vancouver 
 
No field duplicate samples were submitted to the assay laboratories during the drilling 
program. 
 
13.3.1 Standard Reference Material 
 
All of the standard reference material used during the two drilling campaigns was ordered 
from Analytical Solutions Ltd. of Toronto (Canada).  The reported assay values of the 
standard reference material have been established by a minimum of 15 laboratories that meet 
ISO specifications.  They have guaranteed homogeneity and particle size finer than 80% < 10 
microns.  Individual assay certificates for each of the five different standards (Table 13.2) 
used by ECU and Golden Tag during its exploration campaign are available on Analytical 
Solutions website at: http://explorationgeochem.com. 
 
A variety of standard reference materials were used to adequately check assay reporting and 
possible contamination at the assay laboratory.  The standard reference material was chosen 
in relation to both the polymetallic nature of mineralization at the San Diego project as well 
as the host rock.  ECU and Golden Tag had a selection of 5 different standards and during the 
course of the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 campaigns a total of 114 standards were sent for 
assay (Table 13.2).

13.3.2 Blanks 
 
Blanks are property specific and consist of non-altered, non-mineralized limestone rocks that 
are collected in nearby dried-up stream beds.  A total of 112 blanks were sent for assay over 
the course of the two drilling campaigns. 
 
Comparative graphs for the blank assays for gold and silver are included in Appendix 1. 
 
13.3.3 Field Duplicates 
 
No field duplicate samples were submitted to the assay laboratories during the drilling 
program. 
 
13.3.4 Check-Assays 
 
Sorting of the rejects and pulps from the 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008 programs was 
conducted during the summer of 2008.  Of a total of 10,573 reject and pulp samples stored at 
the ALS-Chemex facility of Guadalajara, 5,878 reject samples were recovered and brought 
back by freight transport to the San Diego property.  The remaining samples were discarded.  
The recovered samples are stored in numerical order inside the refurbished warehouse on the 
project site.  From these samples, 278 reject samples were chosen at random and sent in 
November, 2008 to the certified SGS laboratory of Durango (Mexico).  The check samples 
represent nearly 3% of the approximately 10,500 samples taken during the course of the 
Phase 1 to 3 drilling programs.  The pulps and rejects from the current (Phase 4) program are 
presently being stored at the ALS-Chemex facility in Guadalajara.  Comparative graphs of 
the original assays obtained from ALS-Chemex and the check assays completed by SGS on 
the rejects are included in Appendix 2.  Individual graphs were produced for the gold, silver, 
lead, zinc and arsenic assay results of both laboratories.  An analysis of the various graphs 
shows that there is a good correlation between the two laboratories for all assayed elements 
with the exception of the gold assays where more discrepancies are noticed. 
 
Micon believes that, based on a review of the QA/QC program and data and on discussions 
with ECU and Golden Tag personnel, the companies apply a reasonable degree of care and 
diligence in monitoring the sample results on the property.  Micon considers that the QA/QC 
procedures and protocols employed at the San Diego project are rigorous enough to ensure 
that the sample data are appropriate for use in mineral resource estimations.  It is Micon's 
opinion that the database and the procedures in-place at the San Diego project are appropriate 
for use in a mineral resource estimate. 
 



 

 84

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Micon visited the ECU offices from September 22 to 27, 2008 to undertake preliminary 
discussions and provide direction for the updated mineral resource estimate, and again 
between November 17 and 20, 2008 to undertake a review of the data and interpretations for 
the updated resource estimate.  Micon was assisted during the visits by a number of 
employees and consultants working for ECU including Stephen Altmann, President of ECU, 
Michel Roy, Chief Executive Officer of ECU, Ing. Joaquin Rodriguez Lugo, Vice President 
of Exploration for ECU and Kateri Marchand, Vice President of Exploration for Golden Tag 
and Manager of the San Diego project.  The current report is an update of Micon's previous 
January, 2008 San Diego Technical Report dated January 20, 2008 which is filed on SEDAR. 
 
The review of the San Diego project was based on published material researched by Micon, 
as well as data, professional opinions and unpublished material submitted by the professional 
staff of ECU or its consultants.  Much of the data came from reports prepared and provided 
by ECU or its Mexican subsidiary, Minera William.  The review of the resource estimation 
parameters was conducted during the visit to the ECU offices located in Torreón, in 
November, 2008.  Further review of the resource parameters and an audit of the resource 
estimate were undertaken upon completion of the estimates by ECU and Kateri Marchand in 
early December, 2008. 
 
Micon's direction for and review of the updated resource estimate for the San Diego property 
consisted of: 
 

1) A review of the parameters and assumptions used to conduct the resource estimate.  
This included a review of the commodity prices used for the various metals, specific 
gravity, cut-off grades and capping of high values 

 
2) A detailed review of the database information, model parameters and resource 

classification details. 
 
A review of the spreadsheets of tabulated resources for each zone and by polygon block was 
undertaken to verify that: 
 

• All calculations and estimations had been made correctly. 

• Blocks had been correctly categorized as indicated and inferred resources. 

• Summary tables had correctly listed total tonnages, grades and contained metal within 
the resource categories. 

Kateri Marchand, as the geologist and Qualified Person overseeing the San Diego project for 
ECU and Golden Tag, personally received and examined the results from all of the samples 
that were analyzed at ALS-Chemex and SGS. Ms. Marchand supervised procedures for 
splitting of core, bagging of the samples and noted the secure delivery of samples to the 
laboratories.  Ms. Marchand also performed a complete verification of the database to ensure 
there are no overlaps, gaps or other inconsistencies. 



 

 85

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
ECU's and Golden Tag's San Diego property exists within the Velardeña mining district 
which is host to a number of past producers.  The geology, nature of the mineralization, 
historical production and the limited use of modern exploration concepts and technology on 
the San Diego property to identify either additional mineralization along both the strike and 
dip directions of known veins, or to identify "hidden or blind" veins which do not outcrop on 
surface, are all considered by Micon to positively affect the prospectivity of the ground 
contained within the property. 
 
15.1 OTHER SILVER PROPERTIES IN THE VELARDEÑA MINING DISTRICT 
 
The following information regarding the adjacent properties was extracted from the July, 
2005 RPA Technical Report and is quoted below. 
 

"IMMSA has operated several mines in the Velardeña district in the recent past, 
including the Santa Maria, Los Azules, Reina del Cobre, San Nicolas and Industria 
mines.  Several styles of mineralization have been exploited." 
 
"The Los Azules mine consists of mesothermal style, arsenic-rich mineralization 
associated with a series of small intrusive bodies and dykes of felsic composition.  The 
individual zones can attain lengths of 100 m, with widths up to 10 m.  The mineralogical 
assemblage consists of pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite, with lesser quantities of 
arsenopyrite, pyrite and galena.  The average grade of this mineralization was 120 g/t 
silver, 2.1% lead and 0.8% zinc (Pinet, 1999)." 
 
"The mineralization in the San Nicolas mine consists of a mineralized breccia zone and 
has also been classified a mesothermal type.  The mineralization is located in quartz latite 
porphyry, to the northeast of a major calcite-filled fault zone.  The mineralogical 
assemblage consists of pyrite, sphalerite and galena (Pinet, 1999)." 
 
"The Industria mine is situated on the southwest flank of Sierra Santa Maria, and is 
described as epithermal style mineralization.  The mineralization occurs as veins in both 
limestone and intrusive rocks.  It exhibits crustiform textures and open-space fillings.  
The mineralization consists of pyrite, sphalerite, boulangerite, galena, as well as silver 
sulphide and sulphosalt minerals (freibergite, proustite, polybasite, and acanthite).  The 
average grades are reported as 120 g/t silver, 3% lead, and 4% zinc." 
 
"Historically, almost 90% of the production from Sierra Santa Maria has come from the 
mesothermal type, pyrite-rich mineralization of the Santa Maria mine which was operated 
by IMMSA from the late 1960's until 2002.  The mineralization is characterized by 
replacement bodies along the Santa Maria dyke.  The dimensions of these bodies can 
attain 200 metres vertically over lengths of 300 m with widths of 20 m.  The 
mineralogical assemblage consists of pyrite, sphalerite and galena, with lesser quantities 
of chalcopyrite.  Gangue minerals principally comprise calcite and fluorite, with minor 



 

 86

quartz.  The average grade of the Santa Maria mine was reported to be 156 g/t silver, 
3.8% lead and 5.2% zinc." 
 

15.1.1 Other Mines 
 
The Noria is a small artisanal operation contiguous to the northeast to the San Diego project.  
It occupies a 9.65 ha mining concession called El Chocolatin.  Mining activities are presently 
carried out from a narrow north 065° oriented sulphide vein (galena ± sphalerite ± pyrite), 
dipping at 68° southeast.  The vein has a true width ranging from 20 to 60 cm.  The depth of 
the shaft is approximately 60 m with limited lateral development work extending over about 
70 m. 
 
ECU operates the Velardeña mines in the district and has done so since acquiring the 
property in December, 1997.  At the present time ECU is reviewing and developing the 
project further with the goal of expanding the operation to 1,500 t/d. 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 

 87

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
There are currently no mill facilities on the San Diego property.  There are the ruins of a 
stone and brick processing facility, which remain from one of the past producers.  This 
processing facility was last in operation in the 1970's when it produced a lead and zinc 
concentrate  If an economically viable deposit was located on the San Diego property milling 
options would have to be reviewed at that date, including processing the material at ECU's 
milling facility. 
 
To date, ECU and Golden Tag have performed very limited metallurgical testwork on the 
mineralization at the San Diego property.  ECU and Golden Tag conducted a flotation test on 
a sample from the Cantarranas vein.  ECU and Golden Tag remain focused on conducting 
exploration programs to evaluate the extent of the mineralization on the property.  The 
economic and technical evaluation of metallurgical processing options is part of the work 
planned for 2009 at the San Diego project. 
 
 
 
 
 



 

 88

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The mineral resource estimate contained in this section is an update of the previous resource 
estimate which was published in a Technical Report filed on SEDAR on January 25, 2008.  
Prior to the January, 2008 Technical Report, resource estimates were conducted in 2005 by 
RPA and in 2006, by Broad Oak.  The RPA and Broad Oak resource estimates were reported 
in Technical Reports which were also filed on SEDAR.  All of the resource estimates 
complied with the CIM standards and definitions for estimating resources as required by 
NI 43-101 regulations. 
 
The current resource estimate discussed in this report is based on new information gathered 
by ECU and Golden Tag during their recent drilling campaigns, in addition to the previously 
gathered information during the 1999 exploration program, used by RPA and Broad Oak in 
their 2005 and 2006 resource estimates, as well as by Micon in its audit of the January, 2008 
resource estimate. 
 
Micon believes that the resource estimate by ECU and Golden Tag, as reviewed by Micon, 
has been reasonably prepared and conforms to the current CIM standards and definitions for 
estimating resources.  Therefore, Micon accepts ECU's and Golden Tag's resource estimate 
as the basis for the ongoing exploration programs at the San Diego project.  In Micon's 
opinion there are no significant technical, legal, environmental or political considerations 
which would affect the resources estimates at the San Diego project. 
 
17.1 ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE EVALUATION OF THE MINERAL 

RESOURCES AT THE SAN DIEGO PROJECT 
 
This section outlines the assumptions used by ECU and Golden Tag to outline the resource 
estimate on the San Diego project. 
 
The characteristics of 7 of the main veins of economic interest in the Velardeña district were 
used as the basis for the determination of the most appropriate distances to apply in the 
estimation of resources and the allocation of resource categories.  Table 17.1 summarizes the 
characteristics of the Velardeña district deposits that have been mined quite extensively over 
the past 130 years. Except for the Santa Maria mines, all are vein-type occurrences which are 
set within different geological environments and at different elevations.

Vertically, these veins have been mined over distances of 200 to 650 m with many of them 
showing further extensions at depth from either sampling or drilling, or both methods.  The 
termination of mining at the various mines in the district was primarily related to changes in 
mining conditions or economics of the day.  If the vertical distances of the various vein 
portions of the Velardeña district system were added together, from the shallower Santa 
Juana vein to the deeper Santa Maria mineralization, a total vertical extent for the 
mineralized system of over 2,000 m would be indicated (includes the 550 m mined at Santa 
Juana, the 1,000 m difference between the Santa Juana and Santa Maria mines, plus the 550 
m known at the Santa Maria mines). 
 
Horizontally, the veins display extensive lateral continuities varying between 350 and 1,500 
m with their lateral limits corresponding to geological features such as faults.  Very limited 
exploration has been conducted on these veins over the years to find their potential 
extensions.  Based on a new geological interpretation, recent diamond drilling on ECU's 
Terneras vein has indicated that it extends outside of the previously mined sector which was 
bounded by faults on both sides.  In addition, in 2004, drilling conducted by ECU east of the 
Tres Aguilas fault discovered the eastern extension of the group of veins which belong to the 
Santa Juana mine and the area consequently became a very important part of the current 
mining plan at Velardeña. 
 
17.1.1 Minimum Mining Widths and Dilution 
 
In a similar approach to that taken at the Velardeña mine, two different minimum mining 
widths were used to evaluate mineral resources at the San Diego project.  This approach took 
into account the two different mineralization styles identified on the property, which are the 
broader zones of lower grade material and the more typical narrow, polymetallic high-grade 
veins.  The wider zones are diluted to a minimum true width of 2.70 m based on the standard 
size of the existing and planned drifts at the mines currently operated by ECU, namely Santa 
Juana, San Juanes and San Mateo.  These mineralized zones are encountered in the 'sheeted 
veins/stockwork zones' in the Santa Juana mine and where the veins widen into 'chimneys' 
in the San Mateo mine.  At the San Diego property, wider stringer/stockwork zones of 
mineralization are encountered at the deeper levels of the La Cruz vein, and in the three 
zones of the Montanez (Hangingwall, Footwall and Centre) as well as within the recently 
discovered Ag zone, San José vein and Mid zone.

The high grade narrow veins are diluted to a minimum horizontal width of 1.0 m based on 
ECU's past and present operating experience.  All such dilution was done at a standard grade 
of: 0.00 g/t gold, 7.0 g/t silver, 0.08% lead, 0.11% zinc and 0.01% copper, these grades being 
representative of the background values obtained at the ECU's mines.  The dilution grade 
was applied to true widths.  Where zones are wider than 2.7 m or veins wider than 1 m, no 
dilution has been applied. 
 
17.1.2 Capping of High Grade Samples 
 
Capping of high silver values was applied only to the indicated resources in the present 
resource estimate.  Samples used to estimate the inferred resources were not capped.  The 
indicated resources have remained unchanged from the January, 2008 resource estimate with 
the capping values also remaining the same.  Capping values of 1,050 g/t silver for the La 
Cruz/La Rata veins and of 1,395 g/t silver for all other veins, were used.  These values 
corresponded to the 95th percentile of the total assay results from the 2006 to 2007 drill 
programs.  Indicated resources are estimated for only five of the veins of the San Diego 
project: La Cruz, La Rata, Montanez Hangingwall, El Jal and Cantarranas veins.  The 
capping of the silver assays is based on the information summarized in Table 17.2.  Graphs 
of the distribution of silver grades from the 2006 to 2007 programs are presented in Figure 
17.1 and 17.2.  These graphs were taken from the January, 2008 Technical Report by Micon. 
 
Capping of high gold assays proved unnecessary due to the commonly low grades assays 
reported.

17.1.3 Specific Gravity Factors 
 
Limited specific gravity measurements were completed as part of the mapping and sampling 
program carried out at San Diego by BLM Minera in 1999.  These tests were conducted 
using the immersion method on samples sealed in a plastic bag (Pinet, 1999) and performed 
on both vein and host rock material from the La Cruz and Cantarranas veins.  Specific 
gravity tests on vein material from the most recent drilling program have not yet been 
completed.

Test results from the 199 San Diego samples and, in a more general way, from the Velardeña 
mine sampling, where density measurements have been made on over 1,500 samples to date, 
indicate that the density of the mineralized veins is quite variable.  This variability in density 
is due to several factors such as the natural porosity of epithermal mineralization, combined 
with the later weathering and oxidation of the veins and mineralization.  These factors result 
in loss of soluble material and explain the generally lower specific gravities.  Table 17.3 
summarizes the 1999 bulk density testing results for the San Diego project.  Up to now, these 
tests are the only ones that have been conducted at San Diego.

In the resource estimates by RPA (2005) and Broad Oak (2006), ECU combined the density 
factors determined for sulphide or oxide mineralization with density factors for waste 
material to better represent the effect of dilution on narrow veins.  Table 17.4 shows the 
range of the diluted tonnage factors which were obtained from this procedure and used in the 
2005 and 2006 resource estimates..

In its 2005 Technical Report, RPA mentioned that "for the purpose of a resource estimate, 
the use of a tonnage factor of 2.5 for oxide material is reasonable and this value is similar to 
that used for comparable deposits".  RPA was also of the opinion that "given the quantities of 
sulphide, tonnage factors in the order of 3.0 and greater used for certain individual sulphide 
blocks are appropriate". 
 
For the January, 2008 resource estimate, the tonnage factors listed in Table 17.5 were applied 
to the blocks outlined from diamond drilling.  These represented average values of specific 
gravity factors previously used.  The higher density factors applied to the Cantarranas, El Jal, 
Canta-Splay and SD veins reflect the high quantity of sulphides contained in these veins.  
Also, experience at Velardeña has shown that sulphide content in the vein relative to the 
oxide will increase with depth.  For those blocks that were reported from the 2006 resource 
estimate (Broad Oak, 2006), the specific gravity factors used at that time were kept 
unchanged.  Table 17.5 summarizes the densities used for the January, 2008 resource 
estimate.

For the purpose of the present resource estimate, revised density factors were used.  These 
represent average values of specific gravity previously used and are deemed appropriate until 
further bulk density tests are completed.  The higher density factors applied to the 
Cantarranas and San José veins reflect the high quantity of sulphides contained in these 
veins.  The host rock for all the veins and/or zones was calculated at a specific gravity factor 
of 2.5.  Table 17.6 summarizes the densities used in the current resource estimate for the San 
Diego project.

17.1.4 Cut-off Grades 
 
The parameters used to determine the cut-off grades are presented in this section.  They are 
based on the economical criteria discussed below and were then used to determine which 
mineralized blocks could be included in the resource estimate.  Blocks below the levels of the 
cut-off grades were reviewed and were occasionally used in the estimate to preserve 
continuity.  The lead and zinc mineralization for those blocks located within the oxide 
portion of the veins was not taken into account in the estimation of the silver equivalent 
cut-off.  Blocks which were not included in the current estimate may be included in future 
estimates should the economical and/or metallurgical criteria change sufficiently to warrant a 
review of the cut-off grades.  Criteria used for the cut-off grade determinations include the 
commodity prices, as well as the operating costs and recoveries for gold, silver, lead and zinc 
determined by ECU from its Velardeña operation, and current sales contracts for the lead and 
zinc concentrates. The payable NSR for the pyrite-gold concentrates is not known at the 



 

 94

present time as no sale contract is in place for this material.  The pyrite concentrates that are 
high in arsenopyrite have been stored in a warehouse since early 2007 for future treatment.  
Roasting tests are currently being performed to reduce the arsenic content below 1% and 
liberate the gold so that this new product can be sold to smelters or cyanided. Table 17.7 
summarizes the parameters for the resource estimate.

Commodity Prices: 
 
The metal prices are based on the 3-year trailing averages which are respectively US $713 
per ounce (/oz) for gold and US $13.26/oz for silver, US $0.90/lb for lead and US $1.28/lb 
for zinc for the period of November 21, 2005 to November 18, 2008.  For the purpose of 
estimating the resources, it was agreed that the prices would be increased to US $775/oz for 
gold and US $14.00/oz for silver while the 3-year trailing averages were used directly for 
lead and zinc.  The increased prices were used to estimate the resources in order to allow for 
better long term management of the properties. 
 
The decision to use a 3-year trailing average for the base metals in the resource estimate 
rather than the method used in the previous resource estimate where the base metal prices 
were based on 5-year forward-looking averages contained in a survey (the Industry Research 
Consensus) of 33 research analysts, was related to the current uncertainty of the world 
financial markets, the drop in metal prices from recent highs and the highly variable forecasts 
available. 
 
When the recent trend seen in the commodity markets is considered, the values used in the 
resource estimate are considered reasonable.  This is especially the case for silver and gold, 
which constitute the most valuable commodities within the resource estimate.  According to 
most industry experts, the precious metals could see further price gains in the coming years 
while there are varying opinions regarding the base metals. 
 



 

 95

Operating Costs: 
 
Two different operating costs were used in accordance with the two different types of 
mineralization styles identified at the San Diego project.  This approach is similar to that 
taken by ECU for estimating the resources at its Velardeña mines.  For the broad zones of 
low grade mineralization, the costs are based on a minimum mining width of 2.7 m and a 
total cost (including mining, milling and administration) which has been estimated to be 
US $25/t.  This figure is based on past discussions with Peñoles, which mentioned that its 
total cost was approximately US $22.50/t at the Francisco y Madero mine in the State of 
Zacatecas, and internal costs estimates using known fixed and variables costs for ECU's past 
operations in the area.  This would be for an operation with a capacity of more than 5,000 t/d 
using mining methods similar to those contemplated for the Velardeña properties, should 
future studies yield a positive economic outlook for further development of the project.  At 
present, ECU believes that these figures reflect the most representative evaluation of the total 
cost of extracting the areas targeted for bulk mining, short of conducting a feasibility study.  
For the purpose of this study, this bulk mining operation cost of US $22.50/t was increased 
by 10% to US $25/t. 
 
In the more traditional narrow vein mining areas where the minimum width is 1.0 m, 
operating costs are estimated at US $45/t.  These costs are based on ECU's experience and 
performance in terms of production and assume that the mineralization found on all of the 
Velardeña properties will constitute a portion of the projected 1,500 t/d operation proposed 
for Velardeña. 
 
Smelting costs were not included in the costs reported above as they vary greatly as a 
function of grades; consequently, they are better reflected in the net smelter return 
calculations.  The use of a fixed cost would result in overvaluation of the higher grades 
blocks and undervaluation of the lower grade ones. 
 
Recoveries: 
 
The metal recoveries for the sulphides used for the San Diego resource estimate are based on 
limited metallurgical tests conducted at the Instituto Tecnológico de Parral (Chihuahua) in 
1997 on material from the Cantarranas vein located on the San Diego property, as well as on 
the lead and zinc concentrate sales contracts from ECU's mine production processed at the 
Velardeña mill.  The lead and zinc concentrates are currently sold to MK Metals Trading 
S.A. de C.V., (MK Metals), a division of Nexxtrade, an international broker. 
 
For the oxides, the recoveries used were those obtained from the last three months of 
operation of the cyanide mill, built by William Resources, in 2001 when the mill yielded 
recoveries of 79% for gold and 58% for silver.  The final product was a gold/silver 
precipitate that was sold to Peñoles under the following terms: 
 

• Payment of 97.55% of the silver at the average closing price of the LME for the 
month following the delivery of the concentrate less US $0.33/oz for refining. 



 

 96

• Payment of 98% of the gold at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate less US $0.01/oz for refining. 

• Less US $1.80/kg of precipitate. 

• Less US $250 for sampling. 

• Less US $2.50/kg of copper. 

By applying the smelting costs to the mill recoveries, it yielded NSR's of 78% for gold and 
55% for silver. 
 
These figures are considered to be the most representative information available until more 
complete metallurgical testwork encompassing the other San Diego veins and/or zones is 
conducted.  Although bearing several similarities to the mineralization extracted at 
Velardeña, the San Diego mineralization intersected so far differentiates itself by its low gold 
and arsenic content.  Also, the amount of mineralization contained in the oxides is rather 
minor accounting for less than 3% of the total inferred resources outlined in the present 
estimate. 
 
The marketable metals contemplated at the present time for the San Diego property are 
silver, lead and zinc.  Unlike the previous estimate completed in January, 2008, gold 
recoveries were taken into account in the present estimate to reflect the same metallurgical 
processes followed by ECU at the Velardeña operation.  However, due to the low gold grades 
obtained at San Diego for the inferred resources that are averaging only 0.134 g/t gold, it 
remains uncertain at this stage if gold grades could be economically recovered.  For this 
reason, a sensitivity analysis was completed and is included in Section 17.4 of this report 
which uses a zero value for the gold credits when converting the metals into silver 
equivalents.  The gold recovery figure used in the present estimate is based on a single 
metallurgical test conducted in 1997 on material from the Cantarranas vein.  From this test 
were produced a lead and a zinc concentrate, with 32% of the gold being recovered in the 
lead concentrate.  Until now, no pyrite concentrates have been produced from vein material 
of the San Diego project and the 53% recovery mentioned below is an estimate based on the 
pyrite-gold-arsenopyrite concentrates being produced by ECU at the mill from the Velardeña 
operation.  This concentrate, however, has a high arsenic and iron content that reflects the 
association of the gold with the iron sulphides, namely pyrite and arsenopyrite, typical of 
ECU's deposits at Velardeña which may or may not be representative of the gold 
environment at the San Diego project.  Copper grades were considered too low to justify their 
inclusion in the overall resource estimate. 
 
At ECU's mines, silver and lead, with lesser gold and copper, are recovered in the lead 
concentrate, while silver and zinc are recovered in the zinc concentrate, and gold and silver 
are recovered in the pyrite/arsenopyrite concentrate. 
 
The lead and zinc concentrates produced at ECU's mill are sold to MK Metals according to 
the specifications within the contracts signed in September, 2008.  Smelting contracts 



 

 97

offering better terms may be obtained should an extensive search for alternative buyers be 
conducted; however, this avenue can only be contemplated once a long term production plan 
is completed with stabilization in the quality of the concentrate. 
 
The average mill recovery factors for the lead and zinc as obtained from the limited 
metallurgical testing conducted on the San Diego vein material are the following: 
 

• Gold: 32% in the lead concentrates. 
• Silver: 92% in the lead, 4% in the zinc. 
• Lead: 95% in the lead concentrate. 
• Zinc: 77% in the zinc concentrate. 
 

The following average mill recovery is based on several metallurgical tests conducted by 
ECU to estimate the gold recoveries for its pyrite concentrate: 

 
• Gold: 53% in the pyrite concentrates. 
• Silver: 2% in the pyrite concentrates. 
 

In addition to the mill recovery factors, the final recovery figure used in this report also took 
into account smelting recoveries.  The base metal recoveries are a function of the current sale 
conditions for the zinc and lead concentrates as shown in the liquidation sheet produced by 
MK Metals, to which ECU has been selling its concentrates and precipitates in 2008. 
 
For lead concentrates, MK Metals pays: 
 

• 95% of the lead less 30 kg/t at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate. 

• 92.5% of the silver less 50 g/t at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate, less US $2/oz for refining. 

• 95% of the gold less 1.5 g/t at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate, less US $12.00/oz for refining. 

• Less US $360/t of concentrate for smelting costs. 

• Less US $3.00 for each 0.1% content of arsenic plus antimony above 0.4%. 

• Less US $3.00 for each 1.0% content of zinc above 6.0%. 

For zinc concentrates, MK Metals pays: 
 

• 85% of the zinc less 80 kg/t at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate. 

• 60% of the silver less 108 g/t at the average closing price of the LME for the month 
following the delivery of the concentrate. 



 

 98

• Less US $370 per tonne of concentrate for smelting costs. 

• Less US $1.50 for each 0.1% content of arsenic above 0.2%. 

• Less US $1.50 for each 1% content of iron above 8.0%. 

• Less US $1.50 for each 1% content of insolubles above 1.5%. 

• Less US $1.50 for each 0.1% content of cadmium above 0.4%. 

• Less US $1.50 for each 1% content of SiO2 above 4.0%. 

The smelting recoveries for the gold-pyrite concentrate were only estimated as this 
concentrate is presently stockpiled for future treatment aiming at reducing its arsenic content 
below 1% and liberating the gold so that this new product can be sold to smelters or 
cyanided. 
 
For each of the concentrates, a net payment is calculated for each element paid, namely: lead, 
gold and silver for lead concentrates, and zinc and silver for zinc concentrates.  This is 
obtained by taking the content of each payable element less the minimum quantity mentioned 
in the contract, times the average LME price for the month considered, less the amount 
deductible on prices.  This payment value is then reduced by the refining charges applicable 
to the particular metal, if any.  The payments are then summed to give the gross value of the 
concentrate, before charges for smelting and penalties, and the relative value of each element 
paid is then calculated in percent.  Then the total charges, smelting plus penalties, are 
calculated to give a total cost which is then distributed, according to the calculated relative 
value of each element paid, against the gross payment for each element to obtain a net 
payment for each element. 
 
From the milling and smelting processes detailed above, ECU calculated net recoveries for 
the following commodities: 
 

• Gold = 43.6% 
• Silver = 64.6%. 
• Lead = 73.1%. 
• Zinc = 47.9%. 
 

Silver Equivalents: 
 
From the criteria previously stated the silver equivalents for the lead and zinc metal grades 
are represented mathematically by the following formula: 
 

(A x B) x 22.046 x 31.1035 = Silver equivalent 
(C x D) 

 
Where: 
 



 

 99

A is the commodity price in US$/lb. 
B is the net recovery in %. 
C is the commodity price of one silver ounce in US$. 
D is the net recovery in % of one silver ounce. 

 
Conversion factors used are: 
 

• 1 metric tonne = 2,204.62 lb (1% = 22.046 lb). 
• 1 ounce (troy) per tonne x 31.1035 = grams per tonne. 

 
From this formula, the following silver equivalents for the lead and zinc grades are obtained 
 

• Lead 1% = 49.90 g/t silver. 
• Zinc 1% = 46.47 g/t silver. 

 
The following formula was used to calculate the silver equivalents for gold grades hosted in 
the oxides and the sulphides: 
 

(A x B) / (C x D) = Silver equivalent  
 
Where: 
 

A is commodity price of one gold ounce in US$. 
B is net recovery in % of one gold ounce. 
C is commodity price of one silver ounce in US$. 
D is net recovery in % of one silver ounce. 

 
From this formula, the following silver equivalents for gold are obtained 
 

• Gold 1g/t = 78.51 g/t silver (oxides). 
• Gold 1g/t = 37.38 g/t silver (sulphides). 

 
Value of the Material  
 
The net payment is calculated for each element considered, namely gold and silver for oxides 
and gold, silver, lead and zinc for sulphides, by multiplying the content of the element by its 
unit price by its net recovery. 
 
For the material from San Diego property sulphides grading: 
 

0.200 g/t gold, 150 g/t silver, 1% lead and 2% zinc would be valued as follows: 
 
Therefore: 
 

(0.200 g/t*$775*43.63 %) + (150 g/t*$14*64.60%) / 31.1035 
Plus, 



 

 100

(1%*$0.90*73.12%) + (2%*$1.28*47.88%)*22.046 = Value of Material in US$ 
 
Cut-off Determination: 
 
The value of the material was calculated for each block and then blocks were eliminated if 
they did not cover the operating costs of US $45 or US $25 described and explained above.  
In specific cases where blocks that did not meet the operating costs were surrounded by 
blocks that did, they were included on the condition that the average of all the blocks 
considered did meet the operating costs. 
 
For practical reasons, cut-offs were converted into silver equivalents and the actual cut-off 
determination is represented mathematically by the following formula: 
 

__A     x 31.104 = Cut-off grade based on silver equivalent 
B x C 

 
Where A is the total operating cost, B is the commodity price for silver and C is the recovery 
percentage for silver. 
 
From the formula, the following cut-offs were obtained: 
 

• Cut-off for narrow vein mining is set at 155 g/t silver. 
• Cut-off for bulk mining is established at 86 g/t silver. 

 
17.2 SAN DIEGO PROJECT RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
Micon has reviewed the resource estimate for the San Diego project.  ECU and Golden Tag 
are using the traditional polygonal method based on the use of a long section to estimate the 
resources.  However, in the current estimate, the whole evaluation process was computer 
assisted using ProMine software to automatically generate the polygons and calculate all of 
the mineral composites.  The previous resource estimate was produced from MineSight 
generated long sections onto which polygons had been drawn and measured with AutoCad 
with all related tonnage and grade estimations done in a separate Excel spreadsheet.  
 
The limits of the resource blocks (or polygons) are defined by mined out areas, excavated 
historical mining levels or workings, mineralization style (broad zones versus narrow veins), 
faults, geological contacts and property limits.  Assays are capped and diluted as previously 
described. 
 
For estimation of the block area, the surface area of each block on the long section 
(orientated vertically but parallel to the strike of the vein) is automatically measured by 
ProMine.  This area figure is multiplied by the measured true width of the vein to obtain the 
block volume.  Block tonnage is then estimated by multiplying the volume figure by the 
applicable specific gravity factors, previously described.

The resource estimates are based on an NSR value cut-off of US $45/t for the individual 
veins and US $25/t for the stringer packages.  Table 17.8 summarizes the assumptions used 
to determine the silver equivalents.

*Recovery includes allowances for both mill recovery and smelter terms. 

 
The following criteria were used to classify the estimated resources according to the current 
CIM definitions of mineral resources: 
 

1) Measured Resources: No measured blocks were defined in the estimate.  
 

2) Indicated Resources:  Those blocks no more than 30 m from drill holes or 
underground samples or surface samples, with a least 2 drill holes or 2 sampling 
intervals across the veins (i.e. trenches or underground samples). 

 
3) Inferred Resources:  Those blocks from 30 m and on from drill holes or samples.  The 

limit for the lateral extension of mineralization is set at 50 m from the last drill hole 
pierce point and/or underground sampling or surface sample used to define the strike 
extent of the mineralized structure.  The down dip extension limit is set at 100 m 
below the deepest drill hole pierce point appearing on each longitudinal section.  
From this limit, a horizontal line is drawn which represents the lower limit for that 
longitudinal section. 

 
The long distance range outlined in the variography study pointed to a strike length extension 
of 50 m with down dip extension also set at 50 m.  However, due to the very limited amount 
of data on which this study was performed, it can be reasonably argued that until a larger 
database is assembled for the San Diego project, it is justified to define lateral distances of 
blocks based on the strike extent of similar veins observed at the nearby Velardeña mines, in 
conjunction with the vein extensions seen at surface at San Diego.  Block limits are also a 
function of geological features such as faults, contacts and mineralization style. 
 
The final mineral resource estimate does not include areas within the indicated blocks where 
previous mining was conducted. 
 
The resulting mineral resource statement for the San Diego property is effective as of 
December 6, 2008.  The tonnages and grades for the Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource 
estimates are summarized by individual zones in Tables 17.9 and 17.10.  Appendix 3 
contains all of the long sections depicting the resource blocks by individual vein.

Table 17.11 summarizes the indicated mineral resource estimate tonnages and grades for the 
San Diego property. These resource figures have remained unchanged from the January, 
2008 estimate, except for the silver equivalent ounces that are now higher due to factors such 
as higher commodity prices and lower net recoveries being used, and the inclusion of gold 
credits.  Table 17.12 summarizes the inferred mineral resource estimate tonnages and grades

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
There are no mineral reserves presently identified on the San Diego property. 
 
The stated resources are not materially affected by any known environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues, unless 
stated in this report, to the best knowledge of the authors.  There are no known mining, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, or other factors that materially affect this mineral resource 
estimate, at this time. 
 
The December 6, 2008 Mineral Resource estimate conducted by ECU and Golden Tag is 
compliant with the current CIM standards and definitions required by NI 43-101 and is, 
therefore, reportable as a mineral resource by ECU and Golden Tag. 
 
17.3 SAN DIEGO PROJECT EXPLORATION POTENTIAL 
 
In addition to the stated mineral resource estimate, the San Diego property has further 
mineral potential since the true extent of the mineralization within the veins, vein packages 
and skarn has not been fully identified.  This section is an attempt to conceptualize the 
possible extent of the mineral potential on the San Diego project.  However, since the 
mineral potential cannot be estimated to the same accuracy as a mineral resource it must be 



 

 104

stated as a range of figures.  To estimate the range for grades, a factor of minus 10% was 
applied for the downside potential and of plus 10%, for the upside potential.  
 
The minimum and maximum potential estimated at the San Diego project is based solely on 
the possible extension at depth of the mineralization as shown on the long sections produced 
for each of the veins and/or zones (Appendix 3).  Potential was estimated for 10 of the 13 
mineralized structures currently identified with no potential calculated for the Arroyo, El Jal 
and SD veins.  The possibility that additional veins and/or zones may be discovered at the 
San Diego project is very strong.  Previous drilling campaigns have demonstrated the 
existence of a number of hidden veins and/or zones which do not have a surface expression 
and are only discovered through a sustained exploration effort. 
 
ECU and Golden Tag are proposing to conduct further exploration to test the mineral 
potential of the property. 
 
17.3.1 Methodology Used to Estimate Tonnages in the Mineral Potential 
 
The following criteria were used to determine the mineral potential for the San Diego project: 
 

1) The lateral extent for both the minimum and maximum mineral potential was limited 
to the known lateral extent established from the inferred resource blocks.  

 
2) The maximum dip extension of the mineral potential was set at 400 m, based on the 

known mined height of the major vein systems, unless the property boundary or a 
geological feature such as a fault was encountered, whereupon the dip extent was 
limited to that distance. 

 
3) The minimum dip extension of the mineral potential was estimated by extending 

vertically at depth for 200 m, unless the property boundary or a geological feature 
such as a fault was encountered, whereupon the dip extent was limited to that 
distance. 

 
Table 17.13 summarizes the mineral potential ranges for the San Diego project.

The reader is cautioned that the mineral potential of the San Diego property is conceptual in 
nature and there has been insufficient exploration conducted within the property to define a 
mineral resource for these areas.  It is also uncertain if further exploration will result in 
targets being delineated as mineral resources.

17.4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON THE GOLD RECOVERY 
 
Unlike the mineral resource estimate completed in January, 2008, gold recoveries were taken 
into account in the present resource estimate for consistency with the resource estimate 
methodology and milling processes used and described by ECU at its Velardeña and Chicago 
properties (Micon, 2008).  Under normal circumstances using a flotation milling process, the 
average gold grades of less than 1 g/t Au obtained for the indicated and inferred resources 
outlined at the San Diego project may not be recoverable.  However, a portion of the gold 
could be recovered during the milling process used to create a pyrite concentrate, similar to 
ECU which is achieving gold recoveries of approximately 90% in its pyrite concentrates.  
However, due to the nature of the mineralization hosting the gold, the pyrite concentrates 
produced since early 2007 by ECU have a high arsenic content that has prevented their sale.  
Currently ECU is conducting intensive tests including roasting to reduce the arsenic content 
and liberate the gold so that the concentrates can either be sold to smelters or processed using 
cyanide.  For these reasons, a sensitivity analysis was completed using a zero value for the 
gold when converting the mineralization on the San Diego property into silver equivalents.  
This sensitivity was conducted to measure the impact if no gold was to be recovered on the 
San Diego project. 
 
Tables 17.14 and 17.15 summarize of the silver equivalent for each of the mineralized veins 
and/or zones for the indicated and inferred mineral resources in the current resource estimate 
with the values compared against the silver equivalent for the same zones at a zero value for 
gold. 
 
Table 17.16 is a comparative summary of the total silver equivalent ounces estimated for the 
base case (present resource estimate) and the zero gold recovery assumptions. 
 
Table 17.16 indicates that using a zero gold recovery factor for estimating the silver 
equivalent ounces has a very small impact on the total resources currently estimated for the 
San Diego project.  The total silver equivalent estimate without the gold represents a loss of 
273,178 of the total silver equivalent ounces estimated for the indicated resources and 
3,544,748 total silver equivalent ounces for the inferred resources.  Respectively, these losses 
amount to reductions of 6.4% for the indicated and 1.7 % for the inferred categories.  A 
stronger impact is demonstrated by the analysis on the indicated resources compared to the 
inferred and is attributed mainly to the higher oxide material content included in the indicated 
resource category as well as its higher average gold grades of 0.30 to 0.50 g/t compared to 
average gold grades of 0.13 to 0.17 g/t for the sulphide contained resources (Tables 17.9 and 
17.10).  From the sensitivity analysis completed, it can be concluded that assuming a zero 
gold recovery factor for estimating resources at the San Diego project would have a minimal 
impact on the total estimated resources.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
With the San Diego project, ECU and Golden Tag have begun to outline a resource base 
which has the potential for the discovery of additional resources and may, with further study, 
be potentially economic. 
 
Micon has conducted a review of the ECU and Golden Tag resource estimate for the San 
Diego property.  Micon considers the resource estimate, compiled by ECU and Golden Tag 
and reviewed by Micon, to have been reasonably prepared and to conform to the current CIM 
standards and definitions for estimating resources, as required under NI 43-101 "Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects."  Therefore, Micon accepts ECU's and Golden Tag's 
resource estimate as the basis for ongoing exploration at the San Diego project.  However, 
the reader should be cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not 
have demonstrated economic viability 
 
The parameters used to determine the cut-off grades are based on the economical criteria 
presented below which were then used to determine which mineralized blocks could be 
included in the resource estimate.  The lead and zinc mineralization for those blocks located 
within the oxide portion of the veins was not taken into account in the estimation of the silver 
equivalent cut-off.  Blocks below the cut-off grades were reviewed and were occasionally 
used in the estimate to preserve continuity.  Blocks which were not included in the current 
estimate may be included in future estimates should the economic and/or metallurgical 
criteria change sufficiently to warrant a review of the cut-off grades.  Criteria used for the 
cut-off grade determinations include the commodity prices and operating costs established by 
ECU, and recoveries for gold, silver, lead and zinc also determined by ECU from its 
Velardeña operation.  Table 19.1 summarizes the parameters for the resource estimate.

For the San Diego project ECU and Golden Tag have currently developed an indicated 
mineral resource of 371,000 tonnes containing 2.9 million ounces of silver, 4,000 ounces of 
gold, 14.7 million pounds of lead and 10.8 million pounds of zinc, with an inferred resource 
of 21.6 million tonnes containing 76.5 million ounces of silver, 93,000 ounces of gold, 867 
million pounds of lead and 1.047 million pounds of zinc.  Based on the gold, silver, lead and 
zinc content, this equates to an indicated resource of 4.2 million ounces of silver equivalent 
with an inferred resource of 214 million ounces of silver equivalent. 
 



 

 111

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
There are no mineral reserves presently identified on the San Diego property. 
 
The stated resources are not materially affected by any known environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues, unless 
stated in this report, to the best knowledge of the authors.  There are no known mining, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, or other factors that materially affect this mineral resource 
estimate, at this time. 
 
Micon believes that the land controlled at the San Diego project by ECU and Golden Tag is 
highly prospective both along strike and down dip of the existing mineralization and that 
further resources could be discovered with additional exploration and development. 
 
In addition to the previously stated mineral resource estimate, the San Diego property has 
further mineral potential since the true extent of the mineralization within the veins, vein 
packages and skarn has not been fully identified.  An attempt has been made to conceptualize 
the possible extent of the mineral potential on the San Diego project.  However, since the 
mineral potential cannot be estimated to the same accuracy as a mineral resource it must be 
stated as a range of figures.  To estimate the range for grades, a factor of minus 10% was 
applied for the downside potential and of plus 10% for the upside potential. 
 
The minimum and maximum potential estimated at the San Diego project is based solely on 
the possible extension at depth of the mineralization as shown on the long sections produced 
for each of the veins and/or zones (Appendix 3).  Potential was estimated for 10 of the 13 
mineralized structures currently identified with no potential calculated for the Arroyo, El Jal 
and SD veins.  The possibility that additional veins and/or zones may be discovered at the 
San Diego project is very strong.  Previous drilling campaigns have demonstrated the 
existence of a number of hidden veins and/or zones which do not have a surface expression 
and are only discovered through a sustained exploration effort. 
 
The mineral potential of the San Diego property is conceptual in nature and there has been 
insufficient exploration conducted within the property to define a mineral resource for these 
areas.  It is also uncertain if further exploration will result in targets being delineated as 
mineral resources.  Thus ECU and Golden Tag are proposing to conduct further exploration 
to test the mineral potential of the property. 
 
Table 19.5 summarizes the mineral potential ranges for the San Diego project.

19.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
ECU and Golden Tag have been conducting exploration drilling on the San Diego property 
which has had some historical mining conducted on the various mineralized veins.  In the 
case of the San Diego project, although a number of mineralized areas have seen limited 
exploitation in the past, the veins on the property remain open in both their lateral and down 
dip projections.  Both companies have been applying modern exploration concepts and 
techniques as well as conducting the first ever drilling programs on the San Diego property.  
As a result of ECU's and Golden Tag's efforts the joint venture has been able to build upon 
the initial December, 2007 mineral resource estimate and is beginning to determine the extent 
of the mineralization on the mineral concessions. 
 
The resources reported herein by ECU and Golden Tag for the San Diego project were 
reviewed and accepted by Micon as constituting the basis for further exploration and 
evaluation programs on the San Diego property.  It is Micon's opinion that the resources for 
the San Diego project conform to the current CIM standards and definitions for estimating 
resources as required under NI 43-101 regulations. 
 
At this time the exploration potential largely remains unknown due to the limited amount of 
work which has been conducted on the property.  However, assuming that the geological 
controls observed at the San Diego property are similar in size and grade to the other 
mineralized veins and deposits within the Velardeña mining district, there is every reason to 
believe that the area of potential mineralization at the San Diego project is large. 
 
In summary, Micon considers that the proposed program for further exploration on the San 
Diego project by ECU and Golden Tag is both warranted and justified as the potential for the 
discovery of additional resources is good.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
ECU and Golden Tag initiated a fourth phase of the diamond drilling on September 2, 2008 
which remains underway at the time of writing this report.  So far in this campaign, two deep 
holes (SD-08-34 and 08-35) and the wedging of a previous hole (SD-07-21A) have been 
completed for a total of 2,722.10 m of HQ and NQ drilling.  Drilling is being conducted 
using a truck-mounted CS-1500 hydraulic drill designed for deep drilling that is owned and 
operated by Layne de Mexico. 
 
Like the previously completed programs, the 2008 to 2009 drilling campaign currently 
underway on the San Diego project is proving to be successful.  The information gathered by 
this program so far has confirmed the: 
 

• Potential for carbonate as well as skarn replacement-type sulphide mineralization 
capable of generating broad lenses of massive mineralization. 

 
• General trend of increasing skarn and marble alteration at depth along with a change 

of deformation style from brittle to ductile, and the improving metal grades and 
widths at depth. 

 
• Mylonitic shear zones intersected at depth as being favourable hosts to both base and 

precious metal mineralization including gold. 
 
• Presence of a new mineralized skarn environment to the south-southeast of the 

property  associated with polymetallic stringers-style and disseminated sulphide 
mineralization 

 
• Broad hornfel alteration aureole which is related to the newly identified skarn 

environment also to the south-southeast of the property that affects all units whether it 
is the skarns, intrusives or limestones. 

 
• Mineralization at the San Diego property occurs in a variety of settings that include: 

 
1) High grade narrow vein-type occurrences. 

 
2) Carbonate and skarn replacement (manto-type) sulphide zones. 

 
3) Wide structurally controlled corridors of sulphide stringers and veins with some 

skarn replacement. 
 

4) Breccia zones either formed due to faulting or as epithermal chimney pipes. 
 
The 2007 to 2008 drill program represented a total exploration expenditure of US $1,722,658 
as of July 31, 2008.  The follow-up drilling program which entails 5,000 m of drilling and 
expenditures of approximately US $1,215,500 commenced on September 2, 2008.  The 
exploration expenditures for the 2008 to 2009 program as of November 30, 2008 are US

Micon has reviewed ECU's and Golden Tag's proposal for further exploration on the San 
Diego property and recommends that they conduct the exploration program as proposed 
subject to either funding and other matters which may cause the proposed exploration 
program to be altered in the normal course business activities or alterations which may affect 
the program as a result of exploration activities themselves. 
 
Through their exploration of the San Diego project, ECU and Golden Tag are continuing to 
identify the extent of the mineralization and as a result have expanded the mineral resource 
base for the property.  Micon has audited and accepted the current resource estimate for the 
project and makes the following additional recommendations: 

 
1) Micon recommends that ECU and Golden Tag conduct further specific gravity testing 

to define the specific gravity for each vein or family of veins to a greater degree.  This 
testwork should be conducted in order to further define the specific gravity of the 
different veins and zones for inclusion in the next resource estimate. 

 
2) Micon recommends that ECU and Golden Tag compile a comprehensive Quality 

Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures report for inclusion in future 
technical reports as an appendix.  The write-up should be complete and cover 
everything from the start of the exploration program to the completion of the program 
including site cleanup.  Included in the report should be procedures covering surface 
and underground sampling, setting up of the drill rigs, drillsite cleanup, logging, core 
sampling, assaying and the use of standard, blank and duplicate samples in the 
program. 

 
3) Micon recommends that when ECU and Golden Tag initiate further drilling programs 

at the San Diego project they log the drill holes to production and geotechnical 
standards rather than exploration standards.  Factors such as the rock quality 
designation/designator, fracture/fault patterns and major fault or gouge zones should 



 

 115

be noted and entered into the computer database to assist in future assessment of the 
mineability of the veins. 

 
4) Micon recommends that representative samples of the mineralized material from the 

various veins and zones be sent out for metallurgical and mineralogical testwork and 
that the results of this work be included in the next resource estimate.
