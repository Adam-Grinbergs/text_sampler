TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 5 

EXECUTIVE AND TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
Richmont Mines Incorporated ("Richmont") prepared this Regulation 43-101 ("R 43-101") 
compliant technical report on the Wasamac Gold Property located in Beauchastel Township, 
some 15 km south west of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. This technical report has been prepared 
in compliance with Regulation 43-101 by Daniel Adam, geo, Ph.D., Exploration Manager for 
Richmont Mines, who is the acting Qualified Person for this work. 

The Wasamac property is less than 10 km east of Richmont's Francoeur Mine. Richmont is 
the 100% owner of the Wasamac property which covers 759.36 hectares and consists of 
3 mining concessions and one claim. There are no royalties, back-in-rights or environmental 
liabilities related to any of the mining concessions. 

Geologically, the Wasamac property is located within the prolific Archean Abitibi sub 
province, Canada. The Abitibi Sub province is the largest greenstone belt of the Superior 
Province and is well known for its important volcanogenic massive sulphide and lode gold 
deposits. 

Gold mineralization on the Wasamac property was originally discovered through surface 
trenching work. A considerable amount of exploration and development work has been 
carried out on the property since this discovery, and has resulted in the discovery of several 
ore bodies. Production of the Wasamac Mine between 1965 and 1971 totalled 
1,892,448 tonnes grading 4.16 g/t Au for a total of 252,923 recovered ounces of gold, 
mostly from the Main zone. 

The Wasa Shear, host of the Wasamac mineralization, runs through the center of the 
property, with an east-west trend (260 degrees) and a northern dip between 50–55 
degrees. The mineralized zone extends for at least 800 metres down dip from surface. 
Wasamac is a gold replacement type deposit; mineralization is closely associated with pyrite 
dissemination and alteration of the volcanic rocks within the shear zone. Five known gold 
bearing zones are located within this north dipping Shear, namely the Main Zone, Zone #1, 
Zone #2, Zone #3 and the MacWin Zone. Another zone of interest, the Wildcat Zone, is 
located approximately 300 metres south of the Main Zone, within a south dipping structure 
sub-parallel to the Wasa Shear. 

Drilling programs over the 2002 – 2004 period intersected mineralization inside the Wasa 
Shear Zone at depth, which demonstrated excellent potential. This drilling resulted in 
estimated Inferred Resources of 1,282,000 tonnes, grading 6.92 g/t Au, for 285,200 ounces 
of gold (4.45 g/t cut-off, gold price around US$400/oz, density of 2.8). 

The higher gold price in recent years led Richmont to re-assess the Wasamac Gold Project. 
The Diamond drill holes database was verified and corrected prior to a new interpretation 
and a new resource calculation. 

Richmont began a 10,000 metre drilling campaign on this property in May 2010, with the 
goal of reassessing existing resources with a lower cut-off grade approach and verifying 
mineralization continuity. Subsequent to favourable results being obtained, the annual 
drilling program was extended to 20,000 metres and a new resource estimation was 
realized. 

The Wasamac database used in the calculation contains 118 surface Diamond Drill Holes 
(DDH), 677 underground DDH and 1,959 underground wall channels. The underground DDH 
and face samples located in the heart of the previously mined Main Zone were not included 
in the database. Gold assays used for grade estimation come from surface DDH (1,558 
samples), all underground DDH (6,399 samples) and face samples (3,148 samples) in the 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 6 

periphery and outside of the Main Zone. The majority of DDH and face sample assay results 
and surveying data used in the calculation have been verified. 

All of the underground developments and stopes were modeled in three dimensions. All the 
blocks located inside the stopes and developments were eliminated from the model. There is 
a good comparison for the tonnage between the volume of the modeled stopes and historical 
production records. 

Resources were estimated by 3D block modeling (Block dimension of 2 m x 2 m x 2 m wide) 
with Gems software and using 2 m composites. Grade estimation was done by Ordinary 
Kriging using parameters defined by a statistical study realized by Belzile Solutions Inc. 
("BSI"). Grade estimation was verified and compared with an inverse square distance 
interpolation. A high grade assay capping value of 35 g/t Au was used. A density of 2.8 t/m3 
for mineralized zones has been considered for tonnage calculation which is consistent with 
historical records and with the URSTM laboratory measurements completed in 2010. 

Inside the modeled mineralized zone, the criteria to define the resource was a minimum of 
4 m true width with a minimum average grade of 1.5 g/t of gold. This cut-off was 
established using a gold price of US$1,000/oz. A 10 metre pillar was left around all of the 
old stopes with the exception of 3 small stopes in the lower part of the Main Zone which 
were discarded from the mineral resource. 

Resource classification was based on the criteria proposed in BSI's statistical review of the 
Wasamac project. For the Main Zone: Measured resource corresponds to the blocks 
interpolated in the first pass of Kriging (15 m x 7 m x 10 m search ellipse with a minimum of 
3 and a maximum of 8 composites and a maximum of 2 composites from the same hole); 
Indicated resource corresponds to the blocks interpolated in the second pass of Kriging 
(30 m x 12 m x 50 m search ellipse with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 composites 
and a maximum of 2 from the same hole); Inferred resource corresponds to the blocks 
interpolated in the third pass of Kriging (50 m x 15 m x 75 m search ellipse with a minimum 
of 1 and a maximum of 8 composites and a maximum of 2 composites from the same hole). 
Similar parameters were used for zones 1, 2 and 3. 

Wasamac resources were identified in four zones: 

• Main Zone: Located at the bottom of the previous mine, this area was partly 
developed but almost not mined. With a dimension of about 300 m x 300 m and an 
average horizontal thickness of 22.4 m, this zone contains more than half of the 
Measured and Indicated Resources. 

• Zone 1: this zone extends from surface to -700 m with a lateral extension of about 
150 m and an average horizontal thickness of 15.8 m. It was partly developed and 
mined in the upper part, but more drilling is required to define it better at depth. 
Zone 1 contains almost all the remaining Measured and Indicated resources. 

• Zone 2: this area contains half of the Inferred resources. It extends from an 
elevation of -250 to -850 m, reaches up to 300 m laterally with an average 
horizontal thickness of 12.1 m. It is still partly open at depth and more drilling is 
required in its upper portion. It also includes a small block near surface at an 
average horizontal thickness of 9.3 m. 

• Zone 3: this zone was tested with only 6 drill holes. It extends from an elevation of -
250 to -500 m, continues laterally over 400 m with an average horizontal thickness 
of 13.3 m. All the resources are in the Inferred category.

The measured and indicated resources of the Wasamac total 5,093,180 tonnes grading 
2.51 g/t Au for 411,093 ounces of gold (Table 1). The resources of the inferred category 
total 11,515,020 tonnes grading 2.72 g/t for 1,007,875 ounces of gold.

Historical resources contained in the surface pillar of the Main Zone were not evaluated in 
this estimate and will be assessed later. 

Some preliminary metallurgical tests on Zone 2 mineralization were completed in 2010 by 
URSTM (Unité de Recherche et de Service en Technologie Minérale) in Rouyn-Noranda. The 
hardness of the material (work index) is considered normal at 13.7 kw-h/tm. Reagents 
consumption is reasonable and the material is not acid generating. The Wasamac 
mineralization contains almost no free recoverable gold as most of the gold particules are 
less than 5 microns. A gold recovery of nearly 87% was obtained with a test of flotation-
cyanidation with regrinding. More tests to identify methods to improve gold recoveries will 
be completed in 2011, as historical data show that recoveries in excess of 94% were 
achieved during the 1967 to 1970 period. 

The Company plans to complete approximately 35,000 metres of drilling on the Wasamac 
property during 2011 in order to confirm the continuity of existing geological structures and 
validate the geological understanding of the property. Also, a scoping study for the Wasamac 
Gold Project will be initiated in 2011. 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 8 

1. INTRODUCTION 
Richmont Mines Incorporated ("Richmont") produced a R 43-101 compliant technical report 
to produce an accurate portrait of the Wasamac property, located near Rouyn-Noranda, 
Quebec, and to outline results from recent exploration work. 

This technical report was prepared to provide an update of the technical information 
acquired by the company on the property. 

The current report is related to the exploration work and parameters used for the estimation 
of the mineral resources of the Wasamac Gold Project. It was prepared following R 43-101 
compliance including the CIM guidelines for the estimation and classification of mineral 
resources. 

This information was gathered from different sources, including public work generally made 
available by companies to the government to assess exploration work and in-house technical 
reports. 

The author of the current report is an employee of Richmont and he is a "qualified person" 
as defined by the R 43-101 requirements. This person has reviewed the content of the 
different sections of this document. 

Daniel Adam has a Ph.D in Geology from the University of Nancy in France, and has more 
than 20 years of experience in production and exploration geology. He previously held 
various positions of responsibility for Selbaie Mines. He joined the Richmont Mines team in 
March 2008 as senior exploration geologist and since December 2008 is the Exploration 
Manager. He supervised the completion of this technical report and visited the property 
several times in 2010. 

2. TERMS OF REFERENCE AND DISCLAIMER 
The report brings together the historic geological information related to the Wasamac Gold 
Project. The first step was to complete a list of exploration work carried out and technical 
papers at both the regional and local level. The second step was to gather as much 
information as possible from public and in-house files by reading all the documents carefully. 
The last step was to write a comprehensive technical report on the property. 

Data from different sources were used in the compilation of this report. Measurements 
related to infrastructure and mineral resources were kept in the metric system. Thousands 
are expressed by a comma and decimals are separated by a point. As an example, 
"12,345.67" should be read "twelve thousand, three hundred and forty five" the decimals 
being after the point. Otherwise mentioned, measurements like geographic distances or 
temperatures are expressed in the metric system.

The qualified person has directly supervised the compilation of relevant data. A large 
number of plans, sections, borehole descriptions and assay results were used to generate a 
reliable estimate of the mineral resource at the Wasamac Gold Project. Most of the resources 
in this report are described and illustrated with schematic views. Meanwhile, all documents, 
calculation sheets, maps and sections are currently stored at Richmont's exploration office in 
Rouyn-Noranda and available for checking and detailed observation. 

3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERT 
The author has assumed that previous companies' reports, maps and other geological data 
that are listed in the References Section were complete and accurate. Parts of those reports 
have been used for this report. 

A statistical review of the sample data of the Wasamac Project was completed by Belzile 
Solutions Inc. ("BSI"). Recommendations provided by the BSI's report has been followed 
and used to define the parameters for the resource estimation. BSI's report is in Appendix 1. 

Some preliminary metallurgical tests were completed in 2010 on the Wasamac 
mineralization by the URSTM (Unité de Recherche et de Service en Technologie Minérale) of 
Rouyn-Noranda (Lelièvre, 2011). 

4. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Wasamac property is located approximately 15 km southwest of Rouyn-Noranda, QC, 
within the heart of the Abitibi gold mining district (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). It consists of 3 
mining concessions (CM 349, CM 364, and CM 370 for 757.65 ha) and a mining claim 
(CDC20098 for 1.71 ha) which cover a total area of 759.36 hectares in the Beauchastel 
township (Table 4.1, Figure 4.3). These mining concessions, which give Richmont the right 
to conduct mining activity on the property, must be renewed every year with either 
$26,517.75 ($35 per ha.) of exploration work or lease payments of the same amount if no 
exploration work has been done. All work and/or lease payments to date have been met by 
Richmont in order to maintain all three mining concessions in good standing and Richmont 
will continue to do it in the future.

TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 12 

Richmont owns 100% of the Wasamac property. On May 7th 1986, the Company signed an 
option agreement with Lac Minerals Ltd. ("Lac Minerals") by which Ressources Minière Rouyn 
("RMR", which changed its name to Richmont in 1991) would earn a 50% interest in the 
property by incurring exploration expenses totalling $5M over 4 years. On January 1987, the 
agreement was amended: RMR could earn the 50% interest by incurring exploration 
expenses totalling $3.5M. On February 29th, 1988, RMR, having spent the required amount 
in exploration works, acquired 50% of the Wasamac property. On June 1st, 1992, Richmont 
acquired the remaining 50% of the Wasamac property for a cash payment of $200,000. 

Upon signing the agreement, the Company assumed all land rental fees and statutory work 
payments on the project. Lac Minerals did not retain any royalty from the project, and no 
royalties by others parties are associated with this project. 

Production from this site between 1965 and 1971 totalled approximately 1,892,448 tonnes 
at a recovered grade of 4.16 g/t Au for a total of 252,923 recovered ounces of gold (Karpoff, 
1987). 

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 ACCESS 

The property is located 15 km West of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada. It is easily 
accessible from the Provincial Highway 117, that joins Rouyn-Noranda and the little 
community of Arntfield. The Wasamac property is directly accessible from Highway 117 and 
from a secondary road (Chemin des Rangs 5 et 6) which leads directly to it. 

The topography is relatively flat (average 300 m above sea level) with the exception of the 
northwest portion of the property where outcrops are nothing more than 20 metres higher 
than the average level, and the Monts Kekekos to the South. The local drainage heads south 
from creeks crosscutting the property towards the Wasa, Helene and Adeline Lakes. As ore 
has been processed at the mine site, there is an old non acid generating tailings pond in the 
center of the property (Figure 4.3). 

5.2 CLIMATE 

The average temperatures are -17.2°C in January and +17.2°C in July based on 
measurements taken over 30 years in the area. There is an average of 61 cm of snow in 
December and 101.9 mm of rain in September. 

5.3 FLORA AND FAUNA 

The area is located in the coniferous to boreal zone and more precisely in a white birch's 
resinous domain. The forest cover is composed of 50% leafy and 50% resinous trees with a 
moderate commercial value. 

The Abitibian forest is a living habitat able to support a wide diversity of mammals and birds. 
Amongst these, beavers and moose are the most common species. Meanwhile, the moose 
habitat is somewhat restricted by the absence of large coniferous covers, human activities 
and the close proximity of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. Beaver dams hinder the water flow 
in several areas (including the Wasamac property) and aquatic fur animals like muskrats, 
minks and otters can cohabit in such an environment. Black ducks and grouses represent 
the most appraised species for sport hunting.

5.4 Local Resources 

Rouyn-Noranda (pop. 41,000) is a well established mining community offering a vast 
amount of commodities. The Horne copper smelter is the most important employer with a 
workforce of about 500. Skilled administrative personnel, technicians, geologists, mining 
engineers and experienced miners are available in the area. Howewer, as several advanced 
staged projects are currently active in the vicinity, it is now more difficult to find, recruit and 
retain manpower. 

5.5 Infrastructure 

In the past, the Wasamac Mine had an inclined shaft dipping to the North in the footwall of 
the Main Zone and about 420 m deep. Drifting was done on 7 main levels (every 200 feet) 
until about -400 m below surface. Two lateral drifts accessed Zones 1 and 2 towards the 
east (at the 400 foot and 800 foot levels). The mine was closed in 1971 and is now entirely 
flooded. All infrastructure were dismantled and equipment was removed. 

The surface rights covering the area of the old infrastructure and of the tailings pond are still 
owned by Richmont. 

Hydro-Quebec electric power is available from a provincial hydro line which runs along 
Highway 117. 

The Ontario Northland Railway runs north of the property, parallel to Highway 117. 

6. HISTORY 
The Wasamac property has been the object of extensive past exploration work. The 
following section provides a brief exploration history. 

Gold mineralization was originally discovered in 1936 by Mine d'Or Champlain through 
surface trenching work. Subsequent surface diamond drilling intersected encouraging gold 
values but geological continuity seemeed erratic. A 60 metre shaft (Wildcat Shaft) was sunk 
and one underground level was developed. 

In 1944, Mine d'Or Champlain changed its name to Wasa Lake Gold Mines and initiated a 
new exploration program. This led to the discovery of a new gold bearing zone, the Main 
Zone, located some 300 metres north of the Wildcat Zone. 

During the period from 1945 to 1948, an inclined shaft was sunk at a 55° angle down to the 
1,000 foot level which was followed by significant development work on five underground 
levels. Ore reserves established at the time stood at just over 2 million tonnes at an average 
grade of 5.28 g/t Au (R 43-101 non compliant). 

In 1960, Barnat Mines Ltd., in association with Little Long Lac Gold Mines, gained control of 
Wasa Lake Gold Mines and changed its name to Wasamac Mines Ltd. A production decision 
was reached in 1964, the underground workings were dewatered and rehabilitated and 
commercial production officially commenced on April 1st, 1965. 

Between 1965 and 1971, nearly 1.9 Mt of ore from the Wasamac deposit were treated by 
Wasamac Mines Ltd and after by Wrigth-Hargreaves Mines Ltd. An average recovered grade 
of 4.16 g/t was recorded (Karpoff, 1986) (Table 6.1).

In May 1971, the mine ceased its operations due to low gold prices (approximately 
US$35/oz), increasing production costs and the abolishment of Federal aid to the mining 
sector. 

Consequently, very little exploration was conducted until 1974, when Lac Minerals carried 
out limited diamond drilling on the MacWin Zone and deep diamond drilling work on the Main 
Zone. 

During the early 1980's, Lac Minerals reactivated exploration work on the property; in 1980 
they completed 80 km of maxmin, magnetometer and VLF ground geophysical surveys. This 
work was followed up with surface geological mapping, and in 1981 the company drilled 64 
surface holes totalling 7,375 metres in an attempt to: 

• Verify the down dip extension of the Main Zone. 

• Evaluate the surface pillar zone through definition drilling at 30 metre spacing. 

• Evaluate the down plunge extensions of the Mac Win, Wildcat and N°2 zones. 

In 1983, following pre feasibility work on the surface pillar recovery, Lac drilled an additional 
1,880 metres from 33 surface holes at a 15 metre spacing, in order to upgrade the level of 
confidence of this surface zone. 

Many open pit studies were subsequently prepared for the surface pillar but low gold prices 
at the time prevented the company from undertaking a production decision. 

Following the option agreement with Lac Minerals in 1986, the exploration work conducted 
by Ressources Minières Rouyn ("RMR", who changed its name for Richmont Mines in 1991), 
which consisted of 11 surface holes totalling 3,710 metres, was aimed at further evaluating 
the surface pillar zone along with the N°1 and Main Zone down dip extensions. 

From November 1987 to June 1988, RMR dewatered the mine to a depth of 975 feet and 
rehabilitated the 400 and 800 foot levels in an attempt to explore the N°1 Zone down dip 
extension through underground drilling. Once again, however, weak gold prices drove the 
Company to bring the project to a halt. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 15 

In 1994, Richmont restored the Wasamac Mine site. All surface installations were 
dismantled, the shaft was capped and the tailings re-vegetated. 

From 1989 to 2002, exploration work on the property consisted of limited surface diamond 
drilling to keep the mining lease in good standing. A total of 8 surface holes were drilled 
during this period, totalling just over 4,500 metres. The main geological target was the 
Wasa Shear Zone at depth. 

In 2002, Richmont re-activated exploration work on the Wasamac property in an attempt to 
evaluate the down plunge extension of the N°1 and N°2 zones at depth. These results, 
including those of the 2010 drilling campaign, are presented in the Exploration section of 
this report. 

Historical resource estimates 

In 1981, Exploration Long Lac Limitée ("Exploration Long Lac"), after the completion of a 
surface diamond drilling campaign, re-assessed the resources of the Wasamac Mine, 
including the surface pillar of the Main Zone (Bugnon, 1981; Figure 6.1): 

Figure 6.1 Historical Resource Estimate for the Wasamac Mine (from Bugnon, 1981) 

 
 
In 1983, Lac Minerals completed another drilling campaign in the surface pillar of the Main 
Zone and reassessed the resource: a total of 588,650 tonnes at a grade of 2.85 g/t was 
estimated for this pillar (Bugnon, 1983). 

In 1986, Karpoff B.S. did a re-assessment of all the resources of Wasamac Mine: 

Main Zone Surface Pillar : 740,396 tonnes at 3.39 g/t 
Main Zone     : 814,273 tonnes at 5.83 g/t 
Zone 1       : 87,855 tonnes at 5.14 g/t 
Zone 2        : 24,839 tonnes at 5.79 g/t 
Zone MacWin     : 91,728 tonnes at 4.94 g/t 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 16 

All the above reserve/resource estimations are historical and R 43-101 non-compliant. 

After the 2002-2003 drilling campaigns, Richmont completed a resource estimation for the 
extension of zones 1 and 2 at depth (Guay, 2004). This estimation was updated with the 
2004 drilling results and a total of 1,282,092 tonnes at 6.92 g/t of inferred resource were 
estimated for the down plunge extension of zones 1 and 2. This resource was estimated 
using a 4.45 g/t cut-off and a gold price of US$400. 

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Wasamac property is located within the Rouyn-Noranda mining district, in the Abitibi 
greenstone belt of the Superior province of the Canadian Shield. The area consists mostly of 
felsic to mafic volcanic rocks of Archean age along with related dioritic sills which are 
concordant to the regional rock formations. These volcanic and intrusive rocks have 
generally been metamorphosed to the green schist facies. 

The Superior Province is the largest exposed Archean craton in the world that hosts several 
world class gold deposits. It has yielded nearly 300 million ounces of gold from hundreds of 
deposits since the beginning of the twentieth century.One prominent characteristic of all 
significant gold deposits in the Superior Province is their occurrence within or immediately 
adjacent to greenstone belts. Another characteristic is their occurrence within major tectonic 
zones which comprise a series of shear zones (Colvine et al. 1988). The Superior Province is 
divided into four major subprovince types (Card and Ciesielski 1986): volcano-plutonic, 
plutonic, metasedimentary, and high grade gneiss. The boundaries of these subprovinces 
are either major dextral, transcurrent, east-striking faults, or zones of structural and 
metamorphic transition. 

The greenstone belts which host the gold deposits occur as east-northeasterly trending 
ribbon domains in the volcano-plutonic terrains. They typically consist of mafic to ultramafic 
and felsic metavolcanics, interlayered with metasediments. The supracrustal rocks have 
been intruded by syn-volcanic plutons. Saturated and undersaturated felsic to mafic igneous 
rocks intruded into the greenstone belts in late Archean. 

The metamorphic grade of most of the present greenstone terrains ranges from sub-
greenschist to greenschist facies in the center, to lower amphibolite facies at the margin. 
Amphibolite facies contact metamorphic aureoles occur around intrusions into the 
greenstones (Jolly 1978, 1980). 

7.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The geology of the Rouyn-Noranda area has been well described by numerous authors 
(Dimroth et al. 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Gélinas et al. 1983; Couture and Pilote 1991).  

Volcanic rocks of the Blake River Group which host the gold deposits are the principal 
Archean rock-types exposed in the study area. Rocks of the Blake River Group are bounded 
to the north by the Porcupine-Destor-Parfouru fault system, and to the south by the Cadillac 
Fault. The Blake River Group is the youngest volcanic sequence in the Superior Province and 
forms a central volcanic complex which is characterized by cyclic bimodal andesite-rhyolite 
units of calc-alkaline and tholeiitic affinity (Péloquin et al. 1990). These units are underlain 
by the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group, which are themselves overlain by little 
deformed Proterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Cobalt Group along the south boundary. The 
volcanic rocks are intruded by two major intrusive rocks, mafic gabbro-diorite sills and 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 17 

stocks that are either synvolcanic or clearly post-tectonic. All lithologies, except for the 
syenites, are folded and metamorphosed. 

Two large granitic bodies are located just north of the Wasamac property; the Flavrian and 
the Powell batholiths. These two bodies cross-cut the volcanic rocks and are located within 
the general axis of the Blake River group syncline. Elsewhere on the property, diabase dykes 
of proterozoic age and lamprophyre dykes are also found. 

The property can basically be subdivided into two distinct volcanic sequences; the 
southeastern portion is characterized by massive mafic to intermediate flows, while the 
northern portion is underlain by an intercalation of mafic volcanic flows, felsic tuffs and 
brecciated rhyolite. These two volcanic sequences are separated by a subsidiary fault of the 
Larder Lake-Cadillac tectonic zone, called the Wasa Shear Zone, which crosses the entire 
length of the property from east to west (Figure 7.1). 

Elsewhere on the property, several small mafic intrusive bodies composed of gabbro and 
diorite can be found. These intrusive bodies vary in size and seem to be generally 
concordant with the regional stratigraphy which runs east-west. 

Below the Proterozoic Cobalt sediments, just south of the Wasamac property, the Larder 
Lake-Cadillac Fault cuts the Archean rocks and separates the rocks of the Blake River Group 
to the north with the sedimentary rocks of the Timiskaming Group to the south. Beside this 
major structure, the Archean rocks are also affected by two families of very different faults, 
one of which is related to the Wasa Shear Zone, and the other to the Horne fault. Like the 
regional structures, these faults and shear zones are nearly striking east-west. The Wasa 
Shear Zone is a reverse fault with a north dipping trend and is strongly hydrothermally 
altered on the Wasamac property. Most of the gold mineralization found on the property to 
date is related to the Wasa Shear Zone. 

Only minor folding has been observed on the property. Schistosity varies between south-
east to north-east with a northern dip of about 55 degrees and corresponds to regional 
schistosity. The stratigraphic high, from pillows observation, is towards the north. 

Detail geological mapping was done on the Wasamac property in 1980. A good description of 
all the lithological units of the property is given by Bugnon (1981) and Bugnon et al (1981).

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 
The Wasamac deposit is a gold deposit of replacement type with close coexistence of gold 
and pyrite disseminated in the altered Wasa Shear Zone. Hydrothermal alteration is well 
developed, and alteration minerals have distinct zonation from orebody outward: albite-
pyrite to carbonate-hematite to muscovite-chlorite. Gold mineralization is closely associated 
with these alterations, especially albite-pyrite alteration. 

The deposit has similarities with the Francoeur deposit which the geology and the alteration 
have been described by Couture and Pilote (1991, 1993) and Gao (1994). 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 19 

9. MINERALIZATION 
The Wasa Shear Zone runs through the centre of the property in an east west fashion. This 
shear zone, which trends at an azimuth of 265°, has a 50-60° dip to the north and a 
maximum thickness of 80 metres. To the west, the shear zone splits into two separate 
branches and becomes thinner, while to the east, the shear zone weakens as well and 
displays an average thickness of 25 metres. This shear zone is characterized by the 
development of a strong mylonitic fabric and an intense hydrothermal alteration which 
totally destroyed the primary structures and textures of the protolith. Mineral assemblages 
of rocks within the shear zone consist of chlorite, carbonate, hematite, albite and sericite in 
the middle of the zone. Gold is associated with a dissemination of fine pyrite in the altered 
portions of the shear zone. 

The Wasa Shear Zone, which has been well drilled over its entire length, does not outcrop 
anywhere on surface. 

During the production era, two gold bearing zones were mined, namely the Main Zone and 
the East N°1 Zone (now Zone 1), while two other less significant zones, the East N°2 (now 
Zone 2) and the MacWin Zones, have only been delimited by diamond drilling. 

Main Zone 

Originally discovered in 1944 through surface drilling, the Main Zone can be described as a 
well laminated mineralized zone. It is located near the centre of the property, within the 
Wasa Shear and high grade parts displays true widths of 10-15 metres (up to 25 metres 
locally) over a strike length of 400 metres. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz, 
carbonate, sericite, albite, pyrite and chlorite inside the shear zone. Visible gold is rare and 
strong gold assays are generally associated with high silica content and a lot of fine grained 
pyrite (Gill, 1947). If the entire mineralized zone is considered, ie including lower grade 
parts, the width of the mineralized zone is up to 50 metres. 

Zone 1 

Located some 400 metres east of the Main Zone, this zone has a similar mineralogical 
assemblage with the Main Zone. The high grade part displays true widths of 4.5 to 
7.5 metres over a strike length of 150 metres. During the last phase of production work, 
underground development work was undertaken in an effort to mine this gold bearing lens 
but only limited tonnage was finally extracted. The thickness of the whole mineralized 
envelop is larger, up to 20 metres. 

Zone 2 

In September of 1944, surface drilling work intersected another gold bearing structure some 
800 metres east of the Main Zone. The higher grade part of this zone has an average 
thickness of 3 to 6 metres over a strike length of 225 metres. The zone was partially 
developed from underground but no production was recorded. This mineralized zone is 
located in the upper part of the shear zone, near the hanging wall. 

Zone 3 

This mineralization was intersected with the 2002-2004 drilling. It is located in the lower 
part of the shear zone, near the footwall, below the MacWin Zone. 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 20 

MacWin Zone 

Formerly known as the Wingate Zone, this zone was found in 1945 near the eastern 
property boundary and is also located within the Wasa Shear Zone. There were some 
historical resources recorded for this zone, but this area is outside the mineral resource 
defined in the present report. 

Wildcat Zone 

Located approximately 300 metres south of the Main Zone, the Wildcat Zone was the first 
gold showing to be discovered on the property (1936). This gold bearing zone consists of a 
carbonate altered zone at the margins of a gabbroic unit. Gold mineralization is associated 
with quartz carbonate veinlets containing fine grained pyrite. The pyrite mineralization is 
also present throughout the altered halo as disseminations. 

This zone, which has been interpreted as being erratic, was investigated through 
underground development work in 1937, but operations ceased a year later due to lower 
than expected gold grades. Further surface drilling was subsequently completed in 1944, but 
efforts failed to improve the grade. The Wildcat shaft was later used as a ventilation raise. 

In 1981, Exploration Long Lac completed 18 holes over 1,562 m. These vertical holes 
showed a possible extension of the mineralization to the south-east (Caillé, 1981). Also, 
Richmont drilling in this area showed a possible extension of the mineralized structure to the 
south-west. 

10. EXPLORATION 
A considerable amount of exploration and development work were carried out on the 
Wasamac property since the discovery of the first gold-bearing veins. Successive 
underground developments have allowed for the discovery of additional resources along the 
Wasa Shear during the years the Main Zone was exploited. 

The most recent exploration programs conducted on the Wasamac property were completed 
over the 2002-2010 period by Richmont. 

In 2002, in order to keep the property in good standing, Richmont drilled a 420 metre 
surface hole on the property which targeted the down plunge extension of Zone 2. Drill hole 
WS-02-01 successfully intersected mineralization which yielded 4.15 g/t Au over a true 
width of 6.8 m. 

In light of this positive result, Richmont made the decision to follow up with a substantial 
surface drilling program in 2003, during which a total of 9,475 metres of surface diamond 
drilling were completed in 15 drill holes. 

All of the drilling successfully intersected the Wasa Shear Zone at depth which demonstrates 
excellent continuity. Nine (9) drill holes from this program returned assay values above 
4 g/t Au from the Wasa Shear intersections and six (6) returned grades superior to 
4.5 g/t Au. 

This surface drilling program was continued in 2004, during which 3,859 m of drilling were 
completed. Results from the 2002-2004 drill holes resulted in estimated Inferred Resources 
of 1.28 Mt grading 6.92 g/t of gold (286,000 oz), using a cut off of 4.45 g/t (Guay, 2004). 

One hole began in 2005 and was only completed in 2006. Hole WS-05-21, over 745 m, cut 
the Wasa Shear Zone but returned only low gold values (0.91 g/t over 4.1 m). 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 21 

In 2007, 2 holes over a total of 435 m were done on the West extension of the Wildcat 
Zone. Hole WS-07-22 cut the Wildcat structure with a gold intercept of 1.39 g/t over 6.6 m. 

In 2008-2009, 3 exploration holes were done to test geophysical anomalies that could 
indicate parallel structure to the Wasa Shear Zone. Alteration zones were cut but returned 
no significant gold value. 

In 2010, As a result of the favourable gold price and resumption of activities at the nearby 
Francoeur Mine, Richmont decided to restart work on the Wasamac property. Richmont 
began a 10,000 m drilling campaign on this property in May 2010, with the goal of 
reassessing resources using a lower cut-off grade in order to evaluate the potential for an 
underground bulk mining operation. Subsequent to favorable results being obtained, the 
2010 drilling program was extended to 20,000 m.

Three diamond drill rigs were used on the property for the 2010 campaign. Every hole was 
done on NQ core diameter from section 50W to 600E. Of the 33 holes and wedges 
completed, 31 reached their target. Holes WS-10-35 and WS-10-54 were stopped before 
completion, the first one due to drilling material stuck in the hole, and the second due to a 
bad deviation. 

29 holes with 2 wedges were drilled in the Wasamac Shear Zone from May to December 
2010, over a total of 19,853 metres. Drilling of holes WS-10-53, 54A and 55, which are used 
in this Resource estimation, began in 2010 but were completed in 2011 for an additional 
827 m. Gold intercepts are presented in Table 8.1 with the identification of the mineralized 
zone. 

Some other mineralized zones were intersected in proximity of the Wasa Shear Zone but, up 
to now, their orientation is not well defined and they are not included in this Resource 
estimation. 

11. DRILLING 
11.1  DRILLING PROGRAM 

A portion of the information from surface and underground holes drilled on the property 
since 1936 is available on Sigeom's website (www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/mines). A list of the 
documents (GM) submitted for assessment is included in Appendix 2. 

A lot of the hard copies of diamond drill logs and assay results from both surface and 
underground holes drilled on the Wasamac property are stored at the Rouyn-Noranda, 
Quebec head office. 

Surface drilling completed in 1980-1981 by Exploration Long Lac Limitée was in BQ size. All 
the holes were surveyed at that time (Bugnon, 1982). 

Surface drilling from 2002 to 2005 was done using BQ sized calibre. The holes, which were 
drilled at 110 metre spacing, were spotted by Richmont field technicians using basic 
surveying instruments. Deviation of the drill holes was measured using a Reflex EZ-shot 
instrument with readings taken at 30 metre intervals. 

Surface drilling in 2010 was done with NQ size by Bradley Bros. Limited. A grid spacing of 
about 75 m was used to follow the 2002-2004 intercepts of Zone 2 at depth and a portion of 
Zone 1. Drilling sites are located on private lands and access agreements have been signed 
with the landowners. Access to drilling sites is via dirt roads. In forested areas, trees were 
cut prior to drill mobilization. 

11.2 METHODOLOGY 

A re-interpretation of the previous DDH results with a lower cut-off grade in order to 
evaluate the potential for an underground bulk mining operation was done early in 2010. 
Following that, the 2010 drilling campaign was planned in order to delineate and to verify 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 23 

the continuity of the gold mineralization in zones 2 and 1. At the beginning, it was also 
planned to verify the extension of the mineralization below the Main Zone, but due to wet 
surface conditions, it was decided to postpone this drilling during the winter period. 

Drilling was planned using a hole spacing of about 75 metres on a vertical longitudinal 
section. Drilling was concentrated mainly on Zone 2 with some holes drilled into Zone 1. 

11.3 DRILL HOLE SURVEYS 

Collar surveying 

In 2010, holes were spotted by Richmont personnel using a GPS (with UTM Zone17 Nad83 
system). 

Most of the 2010 hole casings were left in the ground. Surveyor firm Corriveau J.L. & 
Associés Inc., did the survey of 19 of the 2010 drill hole collars with an accurate GPS system 
and a total station. Also, 2 of the 2003 hole casings were surveyed at the same time. 

Down-hole surveying 

Deviation of the drill holes was measured using a Flexit SmartTool instrument with readings 
taken at 30 metre intervals. A correction of -12.4° was applied to the results. Magnetism 
was measured at the same time and some readings were discarded due to high values. In 
some cases, a multishot reading was taken at the end of the drilling. 

To check the accuracy on the deviation of holes, some of them were also surveyed with a 
Gyroscope by Corriveau. Six holes were surveyed with a GyroSmart instrument: WS-10-30, 
40, 41, 46, 47 and 48. 

Of the 6 surveys done, all but WS-10-41 were correct (there was a bad alignment of the 
gyroscope for the IN survey). As the majority of the holes surveyed by the Gyroscope 
showed no major differences with the Flexit readings, we considered the deviation given by 
the Flexit for the other holes as being acceptable. 

11.4 CORE RECOVERY AND RQD DATA 

The core recovery was in the order of 95-100%, which is very good. Some fault material 
was intersected in the most brecciated parts of the Wasa Shear, generally in the footwall.  

In 1983, Lac Minerals did some RQD measurement of the drilling program done on the 
surface pillar of the Main Zone (Bugnon, 1983). It was noted that RQD was quite 
inconsistent inside and outside the ore zone and varied from 0% to 70% anywhere in the 
Wasa Shear. The hanging wall basalts and rhyolite were more constant in competence and 
RQD of 40% to 60% where common. The footwall schistose basalt was incompetent and 
RDQ of 10% to 30% were generally reported. Away from the shear, on the footwall side, 
basalts were usually competent with RQD of 60% to 70%. 

Rock Quality Designation ("RQD") measurements were taken in some of the previous surface 
holes and in all the 2010 holes. Limited data is available, but ground conditions in the Main 
Zone are not reported to be very good. In the lower part of Zone 1 and in Zone 2, ground 
conditions in mineralization and hanging wall are fair to excellent, but are poor in the 
footwall. We only have RQD data for 3 holes in Zone 3, which suggest that ground conditions 
are good to excellent with the exception of one hole, which reports poor conditions in the 
hanging wall.

12. SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
12.1 CORE DESCRIPTION AND SAMPLING PROCEDURES 

There is not a lot of information available about the rock sampling methods used 
underground, either for core drilling or wall sampling, from when the Wasamac Mine was in 
operation. 

Since 2002, core description has been performed by Richmont's geological staff according to 
the Company's standards. Richmont geologists are members in good standing of the OGQ 
(Ordre des Géologues du Québec) or the OIQ (Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec). Since 
2010, logging has been done on the Francoeur minesite. 

The data introduced in the logging software was: 

• Log header, hole location and parameters, surveys; 

• Descriptions of the main and sub geological units with their location; 

• Mineralized zones with their mineralogy, attitude, thickness; 

• Structures, alterations and RQD. 

Selected mineralized intervals were cut in half with a saw blade, one half being kept as a 
reference in core boxes, the other half being sent to the Expert laboratory in Rouyn-Noranda 
for gold grade determination. Transportation of samples to the laboratory was done by 
Richmont personnel. The assay results and core descriptions were collected and put into sets 
of interpreted sections helping the geological staff to interpret and to plan the drilling. 

The core boxes were marked with aluminium tags and moved to permanent storage in steel 
core-racks on the Francoeur minesite. Since 2003, most of the split core left in core-boxes 
has been stored at the Francoeur Mine and remains available if other tests (gravimetric, 
metallogenic, or petrographic studies) are needed. 

Similarly, since 2009, rejects and pulps from the laboratory have been sent back to the 
Francoeur minesite. 

13. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ASSAYING AND SECURITY 
13.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ASSAYING PROCEDURES 

We do not have any details about the analytical procedure used by laboratories before 2002. 

During the 2002-04 surface drilling programs, diamond drill core was logged and split at the 
Company's core logging facility. Samples from one half of the core were tagged and bagged 
and delivered directly to the Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc. assay office in Ste-Germaine-
Boulé, QC (Actlabs). The other half remained in the appropriate core boxes for future 
verification. 

Techni-Lab follows several procedures when batches of samples are received: 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 25 

SAMPLE PREPARATION 

The samples are counted and classified. A project list is created and the sample 
identification numbers are compared with the order form provided by the client. 
Moreover, each sample is allocated two identification tags, one for the pulp and the 
other for the reject. 

1. Samples are classified by order of priority and placed in cake tins (4 rows of 
12 tins); 

2. Wet samples are dried in an oven at 60°C for one hour; 

3. Bags to be used in the sampling process are allocated the project number and 
the sample ID; 

4. Each sample is crushed at -2 mm. This sample is then homogenized and 
"reduced" after several cycles in a "Riffle Jones" splitter to retain a 250 g 
portion; 

5. This portion is then pulverized at 80% passing -200 meshes during 3 minutes 
in a ring pulveriser. 

A form is filled and bags of pulp are numbered accordingly. A set of 24 crucibles, 
including a blank, a duplicate and a standard, is prepared. The crucibles are filled 
with 115 g of flux and a teaspoon of flour. A portion of the pulp is weighed (15 or 
30 g) and added to the flux in the crucible. The content of each crucible is then 
homogenised. 

1. A 30 gram pulp sample is taken for analysis; 

2. Lead collection of the sample with a flux to obtain a lead button; 

3. Cupellation of the lead button to free the precious metal bead; 

4. Dissolution of the bead in "Aqua Regia"; 

5. Measurement of the gold content by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS); 

6. If the gold content is higher than 10,000 ppb, a second 30 gram pulp sample 
is taken following lead collection and cupellation but the measurement of the 
gold content is done using gravimetry instead of AAS. 

QUALITY CONTROL 

Current in-house quality control procedures followed by Techni-Lab are: 

1. Daily checks of crushers, pulverisers and precision scales; 

2. Blanks: assay results must be lower than the detection limit. If not, this value 
will be subtracted from the results of the assayed samples. If the value is too 
high, the whole batch of samples will be re-assayed; 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 26 

3. Duplicates: the acceptable value of a duplicate depends on the detection limit of 
the assaying method and the average value of the ratio between the duplicate 
and the sample; 

Dupl./Sample Ratio Acceptable gap 
0 to 20 ppb 50% 
21 to 100 ppb 25% 
101 to 500 ppb 15% 
501 ppb and more 10% 
0 to 0.20 g/t 50% 
0.21 to 1 g/t 20% 
1.01 g/t and more 10% 

4. Certified Standard: the acceptable value of a certified standard depends on the 
detection limit of the assaying method and the real value assigned to the 
standard; 

Value of Standard Acceptable gap 
200 to 1,000 ppb 10% 
1,001 ppb and more 5% 
0.80 to 2 g/t 10% 
2 g/t and more 5% 

In 2010, all the samples were sent to the Expert Laboratory in Rouyn-Noranda. Also in 
2010, nearly 200 pulps from the mineralized zone were re-assayed by the Technilab 
laboratory in Ste-Germaine-Boulé. 

The sampling and assaying procedures of the Expert Laboratory are: 

SAMPLE PREPARATION 

1. Receiving Samples 

Upon receipt, samples are placed in numerical order and compared with the 
client packing list to verify receipt of all samples. If the client does not provide a 
packing list with the shipment, one will be prepared by the person unpacking 
the samples. If the samples received do not correspond to the client list, the 
client will be notified. 

2. Sample Preparation 

Samples are dried if necessary and then reduced to -1/4 inch with a jaw 
crusher. The jaw crusher is cleaned with compressed air between samples and 
barren material between sample batches. The sample is then reduced to 90% -
10 mesh with a rolls crusher. The rolls crusher is cleaned between samples with 
a wire brush and compressed air and barren material between sample batches. 
The first sample of each sample batch is screened at 10 mesh to determine that 
90% passes 10 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the roll crusher is adjusted and 
another test is done. Screen test results are recorded in the log book provided 
for this purpose. The sample is then riffled using a Jones type riffle to 
approximately 300gm. Excess material is stored for the client as a crusher 
reject. The 300gm portion is pulverized to 90% -200 mesh in a ring and puck 
type pulverizer, the pulverizer is cleaned between samples with compressed air 
and silica sand between batches. The first sample of each batch is screened at 
200 mesh to determine that 90% passes 200 mesh. Should 90% not pass, the 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 27 

pulverizing time is increased and another test is done. Screen test results are 
recorded in the log book provided for this purpose. 

GOLD FIRE ASSAY GEOCHEM 

A 29.166gm sample is weighed in a crucible that has been previously charged with 
approximately 130gm of flux. The sample is then mixed and 1mg of silver nitrate is 
added. The sample is then fused at 1,800 F for approximately 45 minutes. The 
sample is then poured into a conical mold and allowed to cool; after cooling, the 
slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25-30gm is recovered. This lead 
button is then cupelled at 1,600 F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the 
dore bead is placed in a 12 X 75 mm test tube. 0.2 ml of 1:1 nitric acid is added 
and allowed to react in a water bath for 30 minutes; 0.3 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid is then added and allowed to react in the water bath for 30 
minutes. The sample is then removed from the water bath and 4.5 ml of distilled 
water is added. The sample is thoroughly mixed, allowed to settle and the gold is 
determined by atomic absorption. 

Each furnace batch comprises 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold 
standard. Crucibles are not reused until the result of the sample that was previously 
in each crucible has been obtained. Crucibles that have had gold values of 200 PPB 
are discarded. The lower detection limit is 5 PPB and samples assaying over 
1,000 PPB are checked gravimetrically. 

GOLD FIRE ASSAY GRAVIMETRIC 

A 29.166 gm sample is weighed into a crucible that has been previously charged 
with approximately 130gm of flux. The sample is then mixed and 2mg of silver 
nitrate is added. The sample is then fused at 1,800 F for approximately 45 minutes. 
The sample is then poured in a conical mold and allowed to cool, after cooling, the 
slag is broken off and the lead button weighing 25-30gm is recovered. This lead 
button is then cupelled at 1,600 F until all the lead is oxidized. After cooling, the 
dore bead is flattened with a hammer and placed in a porcelain parting cup. The cup 
is filled with 1:7 nitric acid and heated to dissolve the silver. When the reaction 
appears to be finished, a drop of concentrated nitric acid is added and the sample is 
observed to ensure there is no further action. The gold bead is then washed several 
times with hot distilled water, dried, annealed, cooled and weighed. 

Each furnace batch comprises 28 samples that include a reagent blank and gold 
standard. Crucibles are not reused until we have obtained the result of the sample 
that was previously in each crucible. Crucibles that have had gold values of 3.00 g/t 
are discarded. The lower detection limit is 0.03 g/t and there is no upper limit. All 
values over 3.00 g/t are verified before reporting. 

13.2 SPECIFIC GRAVITY MEASUREMENTS 

The historic tonnage factor used for the Wasamac Mine ore was 12 cubic feet per short ton 
which corresponds to a specific gravity of 2.8. No specific gravity measurement with the 
subsequent diamond drilling campaigns was found. In order to verify this data, Richmont 
has asked the URSTM to do density measurements on the sample from Zone 2 which were 
sent for the metallurgical tests (holes WS-10-31 and WS-10-36) (Lelièvre, 2011). The 
average of the 21 samples gave a specific gravity of 2.823, so the value of 2.8 was 
considered correct and used for the Resource estimation. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 28 

13.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES ("QA/QC") 

At the time the Wasamac Mine was in operation, there are no records of a quality control 
program for the assaying of core samples or wall channel samples. 

Exploration Long Lac completed some checks for the assay results of the 1980-1981 drilling 
campaign. Two laboratories were used for this campaign: Laboratoire d'analyse 
Bourlamaque Ltée of Val-d'Or and Assayers Limited of Rouyn. A part of the samples sent to 
one laboratory was resent to the other. Only the pulp were used and samples were 
separated in two groups; one for the Wasa Shear, the other for the Wildcat Zone. Pulps 
prepared by Bourlamaque and assayed by the 2 laboratories showed a very good correlation 
Ffig 13.1 & 13.3). Pulps prepared by Assayers and assayed by the 2 laboratories showed a 
lower correlation (Fig 13.2 & 13.4) (Bugnon, 1982).

For the 2002-2004 drilling campaigns, the quality control program put in place for the 
sampling of the drill cores consisted of the re-assaying of all samples with economic grades 
by a second laboratory facility. Chimitec (ALS CHEMEX) of Val-d'Or, QC, re-assayed pulps of 
the economic grade samples. 

Chimitec conducted the second assay using a Fire Assay method with an Atomic Absorption 
finish on a 30 gram portion. If the second assay returned a value greater than 7.0 g/t Au, 
another Fire Assay using a gravimetric finish was then performed on a 30 gram portion 
obtained from the pulp. 

Sample preparation was done according to industry standards and was judged satisfactory. 
The lack of very high grade assays renders the standard 30 gram Fire Assay method with AA 
finish as reliable. 

Finally, assay values obtained from the two distinct laboratory facilities were compared. 
Differences do exist when comparing individual sample results but on the whole, results 
were similar. It must be noted, however, that Technilab systematically yielded slightly lower 
assay results than ALS Chemex by an average margin of 0.4 g/t Au. 

For the 2010 drilling campaign, a QA/QC procedure was put in place and followed. A certified 
standard from Rocklabs and a blank was inserted in every batch of 20 samples sent to the 
Expert Laboratory. 

Assays results for the standards which were used are given in the following charts (Figures 
13.5-7), where the green line represent the average value of the standard and the red lines

For the 2010 drilling campaign, 199 pulp samples from Expert Laboratory were also sent to 
the Technilab laboratory and re-assayed for gold. These pulps were selected inside the 
mineralized zone. The average of the re-assays was 3.489 g/t with Technilab while the 
average of the original assays with Expert Laboratory was 3.414 g/t, indicating a good 
correlation for the two assays (Figure 13.9). There is no evidence of bias between the two 
laboratories.

14. DATA VERIFICATION 
14.1 DATABASE 

The Wasamac database contains all the surface diamond drill holes done on the property by 
the different companies. Since the discovery of gold in 1936 by La Mine d'Or Champlain 
Ltée, at least 14 companies have drilled on the Wasamac property. Table 14.1 gives an 
abstract of the numbers of holes drilled by each company, surface and underground. 
Figure 14.1 gives the location of all the surface holes on a map of the property.

Rouyn Mining Resources Inc (and later Richmont Mines) diamond drill holes were captured 
with a logging software, Prolog or Gemlogger. Almost all the other holes were captured in 
Gemcom from hardcopy logs. There were about 200 underground definition holes measured 
on hardcopy maps. 

Of the 702 diamond drill holes surveyed on the Wasamac property, 279 were surface holes 
and 423 were underground holes (Table 14.2). Core size varies from EX to NQ. Surveying 
data was found in the archives.

Deviation tests have been recorded as indicated on hardcopy logs. Survey, deviation and 
assay results have been verified during the capture of the diamond drill holes. 1,502 out of 
1,824 diamond drill holes have been verified (82%). 

On these 1,824 diamond drill holes, 795 were used for the Resource estimation (Table 14.3). 
A total of 98% of the holes used for the Resource estimation have been verified.

from Exploration Long Lac and Richmont Mines are almost all available. 

During the development of the Wasamac Mine, from 1944 to 1970, a lot of wall channel 
samples were taken. 3,210 channels have been added in the database for a total of 8,360 m 
of samples. The samples located in the mined sector between the 800 foot level and the 
1,000 foot level are not in the database (outside the Resource).

Holes ("DDH"), 677 underground DDH and 1,959 underground wall channels. It should be 
noted that some DDH cut 2 zones, so numbers in Table 14.4 are higher. Gold assays used 
for grade estimation come from surface DDH (1,558 samples), all underground DDH 
(6,399 samples) and face samples (3,148 samples). Details for each zone are presented in 
Table 14.4 and all the intercepts are listed in appendices 4 to 6. The majority of DDH and 
face sample assay results and surveying data used in the calculation have been verified. 
Only a small percentage of Original data were not available for verification.

14.2 STATISTICAL REVIEW (FROM BELZILE, 2010) 

BSI was commissioned by Richmont to review the sample data of the Wasamac project. The 
purpose of the statistical review was to provide Richmont with recommendations for High 
grade outlier capping limits, assay compositing, variography and block grade estimation 
parameters. At the time the study was done, Zone 2 and Zone 3 were considered together 
(Zone 2, see Figure 14.2). 

Figure 14.2 Wasamac Mineralized Zones Used in the Statistical Review (Belzile, 2010) 

 
 

Basic statistics for all the drill holes samples are presented in Table 14.5. For a gold deposit, 
the statistics do not show a very high variability with a coefficient of variation of 1.60 (using 
raw, uncapped data).

With the review of the sample histogram (Figure 14.3), the probability plot (Figure14.4) and 
the distribution of metal, BSI recommends to cap assays at 35.0 g/t.

The variography was completed based directly on the 2.0 m down-hole composite data and 
was done for each of the zones. The modeled correlograms for each of the domains are 
summarized in Table 14.6. 

Table 14.6 Variography Statictics for the Wasamac Gold Project (Belzile, 2010) 

 
 

Table 14.7 summarizes BSI's recommended estimation plan for the Wasamac project (2.0 m 
composites). Resources should be classified according to the data search used to estimate 
each block: Measured Resources would be limited to the blocks estimated in the first 
estimation pass, Indicated Resources limited to the blocks estimated in the second pass, and 
Inferred Resources limited to the blocks estimated in the third estimation pass. 

Table 14.7 Proposed Sample Search Parameters (Belzile, 2010) 

 
 

BSI's complete report is presented in Appendix 1. 

14.3 COMPARISON OF DATA TYPES 

In its report, BSI recommends that Richmont make a comparison between the old dataset 
and the new drilling where both drilling are present to assess the validity and quality of the 
older sampling and assaying. 

As there were no new drill holes done directly in the previously drilled area, a comparison 
was done between assay data before and after 1993. Only assay data inside the mineralized 
zone and used for the Resource estimation were compared. Comparison was done with the 
2 metre composites, cut values, for surface DDH, underground DDH and face (channel 
sample). Statistics were calculated with ungrouped and grouped data and with low grade 
(<2 g/t) and higher grade (>2 g/t) populations (Table 14.8 and Table 14.9).

Table 14.8 Comparison of Wasamac Data Before and After 1993 (Ungrouped Data) 

 
 

Table 14.9 Comparison of Wasamac Data Before and After 1993 (Grouped Data) 

 
 

No anomalies or bias were detected with the comparisons between old and new datasets. 
With grouped data, face samples had a higher gold grade average than underground, old or 
new DDH samples. This is due to the fact that mine developments were following higher 
grade mineralized zones. Underground and old surface holes had similar statistics to new 
surface holes. 

14.4 STOPES AND UNDERGROUND DEVELOPMENTS MODELLING 

Wasamac Mine underground developments modelling was done using the hardcopy sections 
and plan maps (from the Wasamac Mine's archives). 

Electronic capture of drift walls was done using a digitizer or by the registration of scanned 
maps. 

For level plans, surveying stations coordinates were captured and, with Promine software, 
wall lines were put at the stations elevation. After that, with Gemcom, an extrude was 
applied to the wall lines to create the drifts in 3D. The height of drifts differed depending of 
the level (Table 14.10).

The raises, walls and sections were digitized from hardcopy maps and sections. Wall and 
section lines were put near the beginning point of the raises. In Gems, an extrude was 
applied to the 2 lines (walls and section) and the intersection of the 2 was created to create 
the 3D of the raises. 

Stopes were digitized by section and pillars in plan maps. Stopes were modelled using the 
section views. After that, pillars on each side of the stopes were modelled and the stopes 
were clipped on the pillars. An overview of the 3D model of the Wasamac Mine is presented 
in Figure 14.5. 

Figure 14.5 3D Wasamac Mine Model Looking SSW (Main Zone) 

 
 

In order to validate the Wasamac 3D model, the volume of all the stopes and the total 
tonnage mined was calculated using a density of 2.8. (Table 14.11). There is a good 
comparison for the tonnage between the volume of the modeled stopes (1,764,879 tonnes) 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 43 

and historical production records (1,892,448 tonnes), considering that a certain tonnage 
from developments was likely sent to the Wasamac mill.

15. ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
Richmont holds an important portfolio of properties (810 hectares) along 10 km of the 
Francoeur and Wasa Shear Zones (Figure 15.1). 

The Francoeur deposits include the Francoeur No.1, No.2 and No.3 deposits. They occur 
along the Francoeur-Wasa Shear Zone and, from west to east, are linked with the Arntfield 
No.1, No.2, and No.3 deposits, the Wasamac Mine and the Wingate deposit. Despite showing 
local differences, all these deposits are very similar to one another in both geological aspect 
and type of mineralization. The Francoeur No.3 was the largest one of them. 

The Francoeur No.3 deposit is hosted in the metavolcanic rocks of the Blake River Group. 
Gold mineralization mainly developed in the ductile Francoeur-Wasa Shear Zone, and is in 
contact with the southern margin of a gabbro-diorite stock. The "West Zone" is located to 
the west of the No.3 deposit which was mined until 2001 down to the 17th level by 
Richmont. The West orebody is in the same Francoeur-Wawa Shear Zone, dips northward at 
about 30 to 40°, and gold-bearing mineralization is closely associated with albite-pyrite 
alteration. 

Resources of the West Zone of the Francoeur Mine were re-assessed in 2009 and Probable 
Reserves of 615,664 tonnes grading 6.91 g/t were defined (Adam et al, 2009). The 
Francoeur Mine is presently being developed by Richmont and production is planned by mid- 
2011. 

Located less than 5 km south of the Francoeur Mine, the Lac Fortune property contains three 
veins, including the "Central" Zone from which historical Resources of 224,425 tonnes 
grading 5.38 g/t Au were calculated. The quartz-tourmaline gold bearing veins are within a 
strong shear zone that cross-cut carbonatized andesite. This andesite is part of the Blake 
River Group and the Lac Fortune shear is probably associated with the regional scale Larder 
Lake-Cadillac Break which extends from Matachewan, Ontario to Val-d'Or, Quebec. The 
qualified person did not verify the information regarding the above mentioned historical 
Resources. 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 45 

Figure 15.1 Mineral Occurrence Around the Wasamac Property 

 
 

There are also some base metal deposits in the Wasamac area. Within a few kilometres to 
the northwest of the property there is the old Aldermac copper mine. Extract from Barrett et 
al. 1991: 

"The original Aldermac mine near Noranda contained several Cu–Zn massive sulfide lenses 
hosted by felsic to mafic volcanic rocks of the late Archean Blake River Group. The original 
Nos. 3–6 orebodies, which consisted of massive pyrite, with lesser magnetite, pyrrhotite, 
chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, contained 1.87 Mt of Cu–Zn ore that averaged 1.47% Cu (Zn 
was not recovered). The orebodies occurred within felsic breccias and tuffs up to 100 m thick 
that are stratigraphically overlain by an extensive dome of mainly massive rhyolite and 
rhyodacite (up to 250 m thick and at least 550 m across). Most of the volcanic rocks that 
laterally flank and overlie the felsic dome are dacitic to andesitic flows, breccia, and tuff, 
with minor rhyolites, and associated subvolcanic sills of quartz-feldspar porphyry and 
gabbro. 

The new massive sulfide deposit, discovered in 1988, lies 150–200 m east of the mined-out 
orebodies, at a similar stratigraphic level within altered felsic breccia and tuff. The sulfides 
are mainly in the No. 8 lens, which contains 1.0 Mt at an average grade of 1.54% Cu, 
4.12% Zn, 31.2 g/t Ag, and 0.48 g/t Au." The qualified person did not verify the information 
about the above mentioned historical Resources. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 46 

Also to the northwest of the Wasamac property, there is the RM Nickel deposit which occurs 
at the base of a gabbro intrusion. The mineralization consists of lenses of massive to semi-
massive sulphides, up to 4 m thick. Zones of disseminated sulphides occur above these 
mineralized lenses. In 1980, Falconbridge Copper estimated the Resource at 131,352 metric 
tonnes grading 0.79% Cu and 0.46% Ni. This calculation was based on the results of more 
than 100 holes drilled by RM Nickel in the late 1950's. The RM Nickel property also belongs 
to Richmont. The qualified person did not verify the information about the above mentioned 
historical resources. 

16. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Some preliminary metallurgical tests were completed in 2010 on the Wasamac 
mineralization by the URSTM (Unité de Recherche et de Service en Technologie Minérale) of 
Rouyn-Noranda (Lelièvre, 2011). 

The hardness of the material is considered to be average at 13.7 kw-h/tm. The Wasamac 
material contains almost no free recoverable gold, and most of the gold particules are less 
than 5 Microns. A gold recovery of nearly 87% was obtained with a test of flotation-
cyanuration with regrinding. Reagents consumption is reasonable and the material is not 
acid generating. 

More tests to identify methods to improve gold recoveries will be completed in 2011, as 
historical data show that recoveries in excess of 94% were achieved in the Wasamac mill 
during the 1967-1970 period. 

17. MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
This mineral Resource estimation was carried out by an employee of Richmont. He is a 
qualified person and member of a professional association as defined by the R 43-101 
requirements. 

Daniel Adam, geo., Ph.D., Exploration Manager (Ordre des géologues du Québec #229) 

This mineral inventory was realized in accordance with the recommendations and regulations 
as set by the R 43-101 committee. The classification of the mineral resources is following 
the general guidelines as adopted in December 2005 by the "CIM" (Canadian Institute of 
Mining) council. 

17.1 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

17.1.1 GENERALITIES 

Parameters Used 

The new resource estimate was done after the reception of all the assays results of the 2010 
drilling campaign and a re-interpretation of the continuity of the mineralized bodies in the 
Wasamac Shear Zone. Figures 17.1 to 17.5 illustrate the thickness and the continuity of the 
main mineralized zone.

The method and parameters used for the Resource calculation were as follows: 

Interpretation and construction of the 3D envelope of the mineralized zones was done using 
section and plan views. Mineralized intercepts were coded by zone and all the intercepts, 
surface DDH, underground DDH and face, were verified. 

A high grade assay capping value of 35 g/t Au was used as defined in the statistic review 
done by BSI (2010). 

2 metre composites were created in all the mineralized intercepts and coded by zone. For 
the creation of the composites, the software was asked to create them in order to use the 
whole intercept, so the composite length was adjusted to make all intervals equal. 

The Mineral Resource was estimated by 3D block modeling (Block dimension of 2 m x 2 m x 
2 m wide) with Gems software and using 2 m composites. All of the underground 
developments and stopes were modeled in three dimensions. All the blocks located inside 
the stopes and developments were eliminated from the model (tonnage and grade equalled 
to zero). 

Grade estimation was done by Ordinary Kriging using parameters based on a statistical 
study realized by BSI. For each zone, all the composites search and Kriging parameters for 
the three passes of bloc interpolation are presented in Tables 17.1 and 17.2.

Table 17.1 Search Parameters Used for the Estimation of Each Wasamac Zone 

 
 

Table 17.2 Kriging Parameters Used for the Estimation of Each Wasamac Zone 

 
 

A density of 2.8 t/m3 was considered for tonnage calculation in mineralized zones. This 
tonnage factor is consistent with historical records and with the URSTM laboratory's 
measurements completed in 2010. 

Grade estimation was verified and compared with an inverse square distance interpolation in 
Zone 2. Results of the comparison are presented in Table 17.3. There is a good comparison 
between the two estimation methods.

TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 52 

Inside the modeled mineralized zones, criteria to define the resource was a minimum of 4 m 
true width with a minimum average grade of 1.5 g/t of gold. This cut-off was established 
using a gold price of US$1,000/oz. A 10 metre pillar was left around all of the old stopes 
with the exception of 3 small stopes in the lower part of the Main Zone which were discarded 
from the Resources. To calculate the Resources inside each zone, lines were traced on a 
longitudinal section (to define blocks with at least a minimum true width of 4 metres and a 
minimum average grade of 1.5 g/t) and used to clip the blocks. Only the blocks inside the 
line were put into the Resources. 

17.1.2  CLASSIFICATION OF THE MINERAL RESOURCES 

The following definitions were applied for the classification of the mineral Resources at the 
Wasamac Gold Project: 

Resources: 

"Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence into 
Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a 
lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An 
Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral 
Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource." 

Measured Mineral Resources: 

"A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological 
and grade continuity." 

Nature and character of geology with grade continuity into Main Zone and Zone 1 are 
sufficiently confirmed by closely spaced underground definition drill holes (7.5 m to 15 m 
spacing on developed levels), drifts, and stopes to have Resources of this category.  

Indicated Mineral Resources: 

"An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of 
technical and economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and 
reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are 
spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably 
assumed." 

Some of the calculated mineral resources, in the Main Zone and Zone 1 mainly, are 
classified in this category for the Wasamac Gold Project. 

  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 53 

Inferred Mineral Resources: 

"An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity 
and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. 
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes." 

As a result of the actual drill hole spacing, the main part of the estimated Resource for the 
Wasamac gold project category is the Inferred category. Richmont considers that Inferred 
Resources are indicative of areas with the potential to be upgraded to the Indicated or 
Measured categories, depending on the amount of information made available by 
subsequent surface and/or underground work. 

Resource classification was based on the criteria proposed in BSI's statistical review of the 
Wasamac project. For the Main Zone: Measured Resources correspond to the blocks 
interpolated in the first pass of Kriging (15 m x 7 m x 10 m search ellipse with a minimum of 
3 and a maximum of 8 composites and a maximum of 2 composites from the same hole); 
Indicated Resources correspond to the blocks interpolated in the second pass of Kriging 
(30 m x 12 m x 50 m search ellipse with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 composites 
and a maximum of 2 from the same hole); Inferred Resources correspond to the blocks 
interpolated in the third pass of Kriging (50 m x 15 m x 75 m search ellipse with a minimum 
of 1 and a maximum of 8 composites and a maximum of 2 composites from the same hole). 
Similar parameters were used for zones 1, 2 and 3. 

17.1.3 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 

The Measured and Indicated Resources of the Wasamac zones total 5,093,180 tonnes 
grading 2.51 g/t Au for 411,093 ounces of gold (Table 17.4). The Resources in the Inferred 
category total 11,515,020 tonnes grading 2.72 g/t for 1,007,875 ounces of gold. 

Table 17.4 Wasamac Total Resource Estimate as of December 31, 2010 

  

The Wasamac gold resources are estimated inside four mineralized zones. A large 
longitudinal section is presented in Appendix 3 to illustrate the size of the four gold-bearing 
zones and the diamond drill holes used to calculate the resources. Also, the four zones of the 
Wasamac gold resource are illustrated on a schematic longitudinal section in Figure 17.6.

Main Zone: Located at the bottom of the previous mine, this area was partly developed but 
almost not mined. With a dimension of about 300 m x 300 m and an average horizontal 
thickness of 22.4 m, this zone contains more than half of the Measured and Indicated 
Resources (Table 17.5).

Zone 1: this zone extends from surface to -700 m with a lateral extension of about 150 m 
and an average horizontal thickness of 15.8 m. It was partly developed and mined in the 
upper part, but more drilling is required to define it better at depth. Zone 1 contains almost 
all the remaining Measured and Indicated resources (Table 17.6).

Zone 2: this is the area containing most of the Inferred Resource (Table 17.7). It extends 
from an elevation of -250 to -850 m, reaches up to 300 m laterally with an average 
horizontal thickness of 12.1 m. It is still partly open at depth and more drilling is required in 
its upper portion. It also includes a small block near surface at an average horizontal 
thickness of 9.3 m.

17.1.4 MINING METHODS 

Open stope mining methods or sub level long blasthole methods were reported to have been 
used in the Wasamac Mine. 

To date, no scoping study has been completed on the Wasamac mineral Resource. It is 
planned in 2011. Apart from the geometry and dip of the zones, the selection of the proper 
mining method will be based on both the geotechnical classification of the mineralized zones 
and the quality of the wall-rock. Other selection criteria used will include productivity, 
dilution factor, available mining equipment and amount of resources. 

Generally speaking, long-hole stoping methods can be envisioned when the RQD is higher 
than 25% and when gold-bearing structures have a minimum dip of 45°, which corresponds 
to the Wasamac deposit. 

18. OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
All the diamond drilling has been done on private land, and access agreements including 
compensation packages have been signed with the owners. 

Richmont has produced over 1,200,000 ounces of gold from its operations in Quebec, 
Ontario and Newfoundland since beginning production in 1991. With extensive experience in 
gold exploration, development and mining, the Company is well positioned to cost-effectively 
build its North American reserve base through a combination of organic growth, strategic 
acquisitions and partnerships. 

Richmont has estimated the Wasamac mineral resource using a lower cut-off grade (1.5 g/t) 
in order to evaluate the potential for an underground bulk mining operation at CAN$1000. 
Northgate's Young-Davidson underground Project in Ontario, with similar zone widths, used 
a cut-off grade of 1.7 g/t at a gold price of CAN$853 for most of the underground ore 
reserves and expected to be a 6,000 tpd operation. The orebody actually reaches a 1500 m 
vertical depth. They also used a 2.3 g/t cut-off for the longitudinal sub-level retreat method 
(25% of total reserves) at the same gold price. 

While the orebody is significantly wider, Agnico Eagle's Goldex Mine in Quebec operates at a 
cost of $22/t (Year 2010) and has an average reserve grade of 1.8 g/t. One should also note 
that Goldex uses a less expensive mining method that will not be applicable for the 
Wasamac Project. The Wasamac scoping study, which will be initiated in 2011, will define 
the potential size of the project and better evaluate the operating cost. 

19. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
In 2010, as a result of the favourable gold price and resumption of activities at the nearby 
Francoeur Mine, Richmont decided to restart work on the Wasamac property. Richmont 
began a 10,000 metre (m) drilling campaign on this property in May 2010, with the goal of 
reassessing resources using a lower cut-off grade in order to evaluate the potential for an 
underground bulk mining operation. Subsequent to favorable results being obtained, the 
2010 drilling program was extended to 20,000 m. 

The Wasamac property's mineral resource estimate was carried out by Richmont's technical 
staff. This study mainly relied on underground development and underground diamond 
drilling programs performed at the time the Wasamac was in operation, in addition to the

surface holes drilled until December 31, 2010. 29 holes with 2 wedges were drilled in 2010 
for a total of 19,853 metres. 

The historical production of the Wasamac Mine is well documented. From 1965 to 1971 it 
produced 1,892,448 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 4.16 g/t for 252,923 ounces of 
gold. Richmont has in its possession all the archives of the old Wasamac Mine. This past 
data is significant as it provides the Company with a good background of both the geology 
and the underground operations. 

The Wasamac deposit is a replacement type gold deposit with close coexistence of gold and 
pyrite disseminated in the altered Wasa Shear Zone. Hydrothermal alteration is well 
developed, and alteration minerals have distinct zonation from orebody outward: albite-
pyrite to carbonate-hematite to muscovite-chlorite. Gold mineralization is closely associated 
with these alterations, especially albite-pyrite alteration. 

Resources were estimated by 3D block modeling with Gems software and using 
2 m composites. All of the underground developments and stopes were modeled in three 
dimensions. Grade estimation was done by Ordinary Kriging using parameters define by a 
statistical study realized by BSI. 

The Wasamac gold Resources are estimated inside four mineralized zones. The Measured 
and Indicated Resources of the Wasamac zones total 5,093,180 tonnes grading 2.51 g/t Au 
for 411,093 ounces of gold. The Resources of the Inferred category total 11,515,020 tonnes 
grading 2.72 g/t for 1,007,875 ounces of gold. 

Possibilities to increase the current mineral Resource are good considering that: 

• All the resource blocks are still partly open; 

• The Zone 3 block is poorly defined; 

• Very few holes have been done below the -800 m level; 

• The Wasamac Shear Zone may extend until a vertical depth of 1.5 km in the eastern 
part of the property; 

• Mineralization of the Main Zone surface pillar is not yet included in the mineral 
Resource. 

20. RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the author's recommendations, Richmont intends to add data from the mined 
central area of the Main Zone to the Wasamac database in order to better evaluate the 
mineral Resource in the upper part of the mine. 

The Company also plans to complete approximately 35,000 metres of drilling on the 
Wasamac property during 2011. The drilling will be focussed along a horizontal strike length 
of 2 km, and will target a maximum vertical depth of approximately 800 metres, as 
highlighted in the longitudinal section of the property below (Figure 20.1). The objectives of 
the drilling campaign will be to confirm the continuity of existing geological structures and 
validate the geological understanding of the property and, subsequently, to set the 
parameters for completing a scoping study. The main targets will be: the lower part of the 
Main Zone between the bottom of the mine and the Horne fault, the lower part of Zone 1, 
the upper and the lower West parts of Zone 2 and Zone 3. Some exploration holes will also 
target the area between the Main Zone and Zone 1, which is mostly unexplored. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE WASAMAC GOLD PROJECT 60 

A scoping study for the Wasamac Gold Project will be initiated in 2011 in order to define a 
mining method and to better evaluate the mining cost and the cut-off to be used in the 
updated Resource estimation. This study will also help to evaluate which part of the surface 
pillar mineralization may be added to the mineral resource. 

Lastly, more tests to identify methods to improve gold recoveries will be completed in 2011, 
as historical data show that recoveries in excess of 94% were achieved during the 1967-
1970 period at the Wasamac mill.

Subject:    Wasamac Project, Statistical review 

Date:        December 29, 2010 

 

Belzile Solutions Inc. ("BSI") was commissioned by Richmont Mines ("Richmont") to make a review of 

the sample data of the Wasamac Project.  BSI's scope of work was limited to performing various statistical 

studies using data that were provided by Richmont technical staff. The purpose of the statistical reviews 

was to provide Richmont with recommendations for high grade outlier capping limits, assay compositing, 

variography and block grade estimation parameters. BSI did not verify the drill hole database (e.g. collar 

locations, assay grades, drill hole logs, etc.) as those activities were beyond the scope of this project. 

 

For this review, the Wasamac Gemcom database that include all the project drill hole information was 

provided to BSI. Geological interpretation of the Wasamac mineralized zones was performed by 

Richmont and the intersections of the drill holes with the zones were stored within a specific table 

("Interzone"). BSI used this table to perform statistics and related studies of the mineralization of the 

Wasamac project. It must be noted that Diamond drill hole information only was used to perform statistics 

since the chip samples represent a different sample population and does not cover the entire width oh the 

structures. 

 

 

1.0 Basic descriptive statistics 
 

Three main zones are interpreted along the same structure (Main zone, zone 1 and zone 2). Figure 1 

illustrates the position of each of them along with the former underground workings and the individual 

drill hole samples. Drill hole assay intervals intersecting interpreted zones were coded in the database, 

used to analyze sample lengths, generate statistics, composites and variography. 

 

A total of 14,419 samples (diamond drill only) are identified within the different structures. As illustrated 

in figure 1, most of the samples are associated with the Main zone (11,198 samples for the main zone, 

2,390 for Zone 1 and 831 for Zone 2). 

 

For basic statistics, as the characteristics of the sample populations are quite similar, all drill hole samples 

are taken together. The basic statistics are presented in Table 1. For a gold deposit, the statistics do not 

show a very high variability with a coefficient of variation of 1.60 (using raw, uncapped data). 

 

Sample histogram is presented in figure 2 and visually, a capping value of about 35.0 g/t is suggested 

because only erratic data are present higher than this value. Capping is studied in more details in the next 

section.

2.0 Capping 
 

One of the problematic characteristics of most precious metals deposits is the presence of high-grade 

outlier values. Typically in these deposits a small number of assays contain a significant amount of 

contained metal. While these assays may be real and supported by re-assaying and quality QA-QC control 

measures, their area of influence is usually limited. If these assays are not carefully handled during the 

grade estimation process, the potential for over- estimating metal is a significant risk. 

 

There are many ways to identify possible high-grade outliers and numerous ways on how to treat the high 

values. For the Wasamac Project data, BSI used a combination of histograms, cumulative probability plots 

and decile/percentile analysis to determine capping limits. 

 

The precious metal grades of most epithermal deposits are skewed and nearly log normally distributed. 

When properly "domained", the assays for most populations will follow an approximated log normal 

trend. As assays become more erratically distributed they will deviate from the log normal trend of the 

population. Many practitioners use this point of deviation to establish a limit to cut assays when the 

distribution becomes erratic. In figure 3, the probability plot shows this deviation around 35.0 g/t.

Another method to determine capping limits is to find significant breaks in the distribution of metal by 

reviewing contained metal (determined by assay grade multiplied by sample length) by deciles and 

percentiles. According to this method, if more than 10% of the contained metal is found in the last upper 

percentile, the grades should be capped using the maximum grade of the next lower percentile (or at the 

minimum, to a level where not more than 10% of the metal content is associated with the last upper 

percentile). 

 

This analysis shows in table 2 that only 8.7% of the contained gold is associated with the last upper 

percentile of the sample population.  

 

Therefore, the risk that the higher grade values may over-estimate the total gold content of the structure is 

mitigated. Nevertheless, there is always a risk that local estimate may be overly influenced by outliers. 

After review of the data, BSI recommends to cap assays at 35.0 g/t.  

 

Table 3 presents the capped statistics of the original samples. The impact on the mean is quite low with an 

apparent metal loss of 1.46% after capping of 7 assays. The loss is defined as "apparent" because the 

spatial relationship of the samples is not taken into account. The coefficient of variation is now at 1.17 

before compositing, which is low for an epithermal deposit.

3.0 Compositing 
 

The drill hole database coded within each interpreted zone was composited to achieve a uniform sample 

support. As only 20% of the zone intersections are less than 6.0 metres BSI would propose 2.0m as block 

size for block modeling and therefore, length of 2.0m is judged an appropriate composite interval to 

equalize the sample support. Composites are calculated using the capped individual assays.

4.0 Variography 
 

Grade variography was generated and modeled in preparation for the estimation of gold grades of the 

different zones of the deposit. The variography was completed based directly on the 2.0m down-hole 

composite data. 

 

A standard approach was used to generate and model the variography for each of the domains. The steps 

taken are summarized below: 

 

 Examination of the orientations and dips of the solids representing the domain to be studied to 
help in the determination of the axes of better continuity. 

 Generate and model the down hole direction correlogram, which allows the determination of the 
nugget effect (closed spaced variability). 

 Calculate and model the major, semi-major and minor axes of continuity.

Correlograms were generated every 30 degrees azimuths and at 15 degree dip increments for the Main 

zone and for Zones 1 and 2 together  using Sage 2001 software, which uses regressions to determine 

optimal anisotropy directions. Figure 4 and 5 illustrate respectively the orientation of the resulting 

variography for the Main zone and zones 1 and 2.

All the variography was modeled with a nugget effect and 2 structures representing the larger scale spatial 

variability of the datasets. 

 

The modeled correlograms for each of the domains are summarized in table 5. The rotation angles use the 

Gemcom convention around the ZYZ axes based on the orientation of the block model used. The resulting 

orientations were visualized in Gemcom to see if the directions of the axes were consistent with the solid 

orientations. The orientations generally fit pretty well with the general orientations of the interpreted 

zones. Note that some reported rotations have been adjusted on the basis of interpreted geological 

constraints. 

 

Generally, the nugget effect is low at 10%. Due to the limited number of samples Zone 1 and 2, 

variography is not optimal and will greatly benefit from more definition drilling. The modelled 

correlograms for each domain are summarized in Table 5.

5.0 Grade estimation methodology 
 

Many practitioners often use the ranges corresponding to 80% to 90% of the total sill as maximum 

distances from drilling data for classifying block grades as Indicated Mineral Resources. Since modeling 

variograms is quite subjective and long ranges can be interpreted for the last 10 to 20% of the total 

variance, it is thought to be prudent to discount ranges beyond 80-90% of the sill. As the modeled curve 

flattens the samples are showing less continuity and are starting to approximate a random distribution. 

 

BSI recommends that grade estimation should be done using the capped 2.0m composites. Ordinary 

Kriging and Inverse distance (second and third power) methodologies should be used for comparison. The 
estimate could be done using a multiple pass estimation approach as summarized below: 

 

 First pass: minimum of 3 and maximum of 8 composites collected within a search ellipse that 
corresponds to the range of the first structure identified by variographic studies (20m for the major 

axis). A maximum of two composites per drillhole could be used for any block estimate. 

 Second pass: minimum of 3 and maximum of 8 composites within a search ellipse that 
corresponds to about 80% of the range of the second structure identified by variographic studies 

(65m for the major axis). A maximum of two composites per drillhole could be used for any block 

estimate.

 Third pass: minimum of 1 and maximum of 8 composites within a search ellipse large enough to 
estimate the vast majority of the blocks within the mineralized zones. A maximum of two 

composites per drillhole could be used for any block estimate.

6.0  Classification 
 

Resource classification is based on the robustness of the various data sources available, including: 

- Quality and reliability of drilling and sampling data 
- Distance between sample points (drilling density) 
- Confidence in the geological interpretation 
- Continuity of the geologic structures and the continuity of the grade within these structures 
- Variograms models and their related ranges (first and second structures) 
- Statistics of the data population 
- Quality of assay data 
- Tonnage factor  

 

Based on these criteria, resources could be classified according to the data search used to estimate each 

block.  

 

Measured resources would be limited to the blocks estimated in the first estimation pass.  

Indicated resources correspond to the blocks estimated in the second estimation. 

Inferred resources correspond to the blocks estimated in the third estimation pass. 

 

 

 

7.0 Validation of historical data 
 

The Wasamac database contains surface and underground diamond drill holes drilled by different 

operators and over a period of about 75 years. Every time different sample populations are present in the 

same database, it is important to compare them to be sure that there is no bias between the populations.

Mémorandum 

 

There is no concern about the recent Richmont drilling since it was conducted with modern industry 

standards (drilling, sampling and assaying). 

 

There could be some concerns about the old Wasamac assay database. The quality of historical assay data 

is often difficult to assess. If old core is still available, re-assaying is the best way to confirm the grade of 

the samples. When core is not available, the comparison can only be done by comparing samples or group 

of samples in close proximity to each other.  

 

BSI recommends that Richmont Mines makes a comparison between the old dataset and the new drilling 

where both drilling are present to assess the validity and quality of the older sampling and assaying. This 

assessment should be done before publicly disclose Measured and Indicated resources.
