3.0 SUMMARY 
 

3.1 Property Description, Location, and Access 

The El Compas gold and silver property ("The Property") is located in the 

state of Zacatecas, Mexico, approximately 1.7 kilometers south of the city of 

Zacatecas, and is centered at UTM 747,193E, 2515482N, within the WGS84 

Zone 13 coordinate system. The Property is accessible from Zacatecas City by 

two-wheel drive vehicle via paved and gravel roads in good condition.  

 

The Property consists of 15 semi-contiguous claims totalling approximately 

1,731 hectares. One additional claim has been applied for by the Company at the 

Mexican Department of Mines and is pending approval (an additional 1,711 

hectares).  

 

The current El Compas and El Orito resource areas are located near the 

center of the property and entirely within the 28 hectare El Compas claim, and 

the 9 hectare El Orito claim, respectively.  

 

3.2 Property Ownership and Terms of Agreements 

The 15 claims comprising the property are under assignment-of-rights and 

option-to-purchase agreements between the underlying owners and Oro Silver 

Resources Ltd's Mexican affiliate, Minera Oro Silver de Mexico S.A. de C.V. In all 

instances the Company has the right to acquire a 100% interest in the 

exploration and mining rights to these properties. All of the agreements include 

staged cash and/or share payments, and some are subject to minimum work 

commitments and NSR clauses also.  

 



 

14 

 

To date the company has made several large (>$50,000) cash option 

payments (all disclosed in historic press releases): 

 

- $800,000 paid in November 2007 to purchase the exploitation rights to the 

El Compas claim, previously held by a third party through a rental agreement 

with the underlying owner of the mining rights. Payment also included a 100% 

interest in the exploration and mining rights to three adjacent claims previously 

optioned to the Company (El Orito, La Virgen, Ampleacion Al Compas).  

 

- up to May 2008 a total of $1.6 million paid to acquire a 51% interest in the 

El Compas mineral concession. The Company can acquire the remaining 49% 

interest by completing additional staged payments totaling $1.1 million by June 4, 

2009. 

 

3.3 Geological Setting 

The Zacatecas Mining District covers a belt of epithermal and mesothermal 

vein deposits that contain silver, gold and base metals (copper, lead and zinc) in 

the southern Sierra Madre Occidental Physiographic Province in north-central 

Mexico. The dominant structural features that localize mineralization are of 

Tertiary age, and are interpreted to be related to the development of a volcanic 

centre and to northerly trending basin-and-range structures. The Zacatecas 

Mining District occurs in a structurally complex setting, associated with siliceous 

subvolcanic and volcanic rocks underlain by sedimentary and metasedimentary 

rocks. The geologic units of the Zacatecas area include Triassic metamorphic 

rocks of the Zacatecas Formation and overlying basic volcanic rocks of the 

Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous Chilitos Formation. 

 



 

15 

 

3.4 Property Geology and Mineralization 

The veins at El Compas strike predominantly north and northwest and are 

hosted partly in volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Chilitos formation and 

partly in overlying volcanic rocks of the La Virgen formation. At least five low 

sulphidation epithermal veins were historically exploited by several small shafts 

at the El Compas and El Orito concessions for gold and silver.  

 

Recent exploitation by Contracuna at El Compas of two of these veins was 

by a ramp-in-ore. Contracuna reports on their mine plans state about 1,215m of 

ramp development, to a depth of about 90m below portal elevation.  

 

3.5 Exploration Concept 

The area with the largest historical workings, the El Compas Adit Zone, was 

selected as the principal exploration target. Widely spaced exploration drill holes 

by previous operators indicated that mineralization in the El Compas vein, which 

hosts the Adit Zone, and other subsidiary veins extend well below the limit of 

historical workings and possibly below the contact zone between Chilitos 

formation and overlying La Virgen formation lithologies.  

 

The overall objective of the exploration program was the delineation of 

known ore chutes to greater depth, and the evaluation of parallel structures 

comprising the El Compas and El Orito vein systems. An additional objective was 

the discovery of one or more new, and potentially economic, mineralized chutes, 

and a preliminary evaluation of their size.  

 

3.6 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 

Between November 2007 and March 2008 Oro Silver completed a 5,400 

metre Phase 1 diamond drilling program that evaluated a number of known ore 



 

16 

 

chutes and prospective target zones hosted in the El Compas and El Orito vein 

systems.  

 

Close spaced drilling established the down-dip extent of the El Compas Adit 

zone ore chute for as much as 100 metres below deepest historical workings, 

and horizontally on strike for over 200 metres, while wide spaced drilling tested 

the cross-strike potential of the El Compas vein system, and evaluated the 

potential for additional chutes on strike to the north and south of the Adit zone.  

 

Wide-spaced drilling completed at the El Orito vein tested the potential of the 

vein down dip and along strike of historical workings. 

 

3.7 Mineral Resource Estimation for the El Compas Project 

Oro silver has produced a resource estimate for the El Compas and El Orito 

veins based on historic drilling completed by Minera Hochschild in 2005, and by 

Oro Silver in 2007-08. A combined total of 57 diamond drill holes (11,200 metres) 

have been drilled on the property by the two companies. Of these 48 were 

utilized for the estimation of the mineral resources; 32 were drilled by Oro Silver, 

and 16 holes by MHM. 

 

Using a 3.0 g/t gold-equivalent cut-off the indicated portion of the resource is 

estimated at 310,000 tonnes grading 6.52 g/t gold-equivalent for a total of 65,000 

gold-equivalent ounces, while the inferred portion is estimated at 234,000 tonnes 

grading 5.48 g/t gold-equivalent for a total of 41,200 gold-equivalent ounces. 

Using a lower cut-off of 2.0 g/t results, there is an increase of 11% in the 

indicated resource and 19% in the inferred resource. Resources at both cut-off 

grades are shown in Table 3.1.

The El Compas and El Orito veins contain 86% and 14% respectively, of the 

gold-equivalent inferred resource ounces, while the El Compas vein contains 

100% of the indicated resource. The average true widths are 7.2 metres for the 

El Compas vein and 3.3 metres for the El Orito vein. 
 

The sample intervals were composited to 1-metre lengths. Grades were 

capped at 25.0 g/t for gold and 300.0 g/t for silver. Gold and silver grades were 

interpolated into a 1 X 5 X 1 metre (X, Y, Z) block model using ordinary kriging. A 

search ellipsoid with variable azimuth and dip angles was used in the grade 

estimation process to better characterize the grade distribution within the 

mineralized veins. 
 

3.8 Mineral Reserves  

No mineral reserve studies have been undertaken to determine the economic 

viability of the El Compas mineral resource.

3.9 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The 2007-2008 surface drilling program has been successfully completed, 

and a preliminary estimate of the mineral resource potential for the El Compas 

vein Adit zone and El Orito vein has been calculated.  Furthermore, drilling 

completed to date indicates that the El Compas zone is open at depth to the 

north, while the El Orito zone is open to the south. 

 

Both the grades and true widths reported in the resource estimate 

demonstrate the potential for mining at El Compas. Therefore an important next 

step should be to complete basic mine design, planning and cost estimation in 

order to generate a preliminary economic assessment with cash flow analyses. 

 

Additional surface drilling should be considered to upgrade more of the 

resources from the inferred to the indicated category, and to further evaluate the 

resource potential in directions where it is still open.  

 

Additional field work followed by drilling should be considered on adjacent 

concessions recently acquired by the company, where encouraging drilling 

results have been reported by previous explorers.   

 

A topographic survey of the El Orito resource area should be considered, 

since government elevation data is inaccurate and cannot be relied upon.

6.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

The El Compas property comprises approximately 1,731 hectares in Central 

Zacatecas state and is centered on UTM coordinates 747,193E, and 2,515,482N, 

at an elevation of about 2,430 meters (Figure 6.1). It is located in the El Orito 

mining district, municipality of Zacatecas, Zacatecas State, Mexico, 

approximately 1.7 km south of the city of Zacatecas (population 125,000). The El 

Compas property covers approximately 2.4 km of the El Compas vein system 

and 1.2 km of the El Orito vein system, two of the more important mineralized 

structures in the district. These structures host numerous historical workings, as 

well as the current El Compas and El Orito resources. Other mineralized 

structures are known to exist on the property but which have not yet been 

investigated.

6.1 Mineral and Surface Rights 

The El Compas property consists of 15, semi-contiguous mineral claims 

covering approximately 1,731 hectares. The El Compas and El Orito resource 

areas are located within the 28 hectare El Compas claim (Title No. 218370), and 

the 9 hectare El Orito claim (Title No. 220278). Details of these and the other 

claims are summarized in Table 6.1, and claim locations are shown in Figure 6.2. 

The mineral rights to one additional concession have been applied for by The 

Company and are pending approval by the Direccion General de Minas 

(approximately 1711 hectares). There are small claims not owned by the 

company that are internal to the El Compas Property; however, none of these are 

located in the immediate area of interest. 

 

Mexican law requires that the boundaries of a mineral concession be 

established by a registered Mexican Mineral Concession Surveyor. Four 

concessions, including El Compas and El Orito, have had their boundaries 

surveyed and determined to be correct (Terrazas and Meza, 2007).

6.2 Property Taxes and Assessment Requirements 

All minerals found in Mexico are the property of Mexico, and may be 

exploited by private entities under concessions granted by the Mexican 

Government. The process was defined under the Mexican Mining Law of 1992, 

and excludes petroleum and nuclear resources from consideration. The Mining 

Law also requires that non-Mexicans entities must either establish a Mexican 

corporation, or partner with a Mexican entity.  

 

Under current Mexican mining law, amended April 29, 2005, the Direccion 

General de Minas ("DGM") grant concessions for a period of 50 years, provided 

the concession is maintained in good standing. There is no distinction between 

mineral exploration and exploitation concessions. As part of the requirements to 

maintain a concession in good standing, bi-annual fees must be paid, and a 

report submitted to the DGM each May. This report covers work conducted over 

the previous year on the concession.  

 

Two schemes cover the calculation of the bi-annual fee, and are calculated 

on a per-hectare basis. For concessions granted prior to January, 2006, one of 

two fee structures apply to the calculation, depending on the type of concession 

(exploitation vs exploration), and the amount of time that has passed since 

granting of the concession. For concessions granted after January, 2006, a per-

hectare escalating fee applies. Most of the concessions that comprise the the El 

Compas property, including the El Compas concession, were granted prior to 

January, 2006. The current fee rate is provided in Table 6.2, and applies to the El 

Compas and other concessions.

6.3 Property Ownership and Terms of Agreements 

All agreements referenced to in this section have been registered or are in 

the process of being registered with the Direccion General de Minas, Registro 

Publico de Mineria. Laura Diaz of Diaz, Bouchot y Raya (Durango 195-502, 

Colonia Roma Norte, 06700 México, Distrito Federal), legal council to Oro Silver, 

has reviewed the agreements on its behalf.

On April 21, 2007 the Company, through its 100% owned affiliate Minera Oro 

Silver de Mexico S.A de C.V., signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement with 

Contracuna I S.A. de C.V. ("Contracuna"), a Mexican company controlled by Mr. 

Francisco Gutierrez Castorena, which at the time held 100% of the exploitation 

rights to the El Compas concession through a rental mining agreement with the 

underlying concession owner Antonio Alvarado Reyes (Oro Silver Resources 

Ltd., 2007a). The Option-to-Purchase agreement also included the right to 

acquire three adjacent concessions owned by Contracuna totaling 98.3517 has, 

namely El Orito, La Virgen, and Ampliacion Al Compas. The Company paid 

$42,500 on signing to execute the agreement. On Nov. 11, 2007, the company 



 

34 

 

paid an additional $800,000 to acquire the 100% interest in the mining rental 

agreement and the three concessions from Contracuna (Oro Silver Resources 

Ltd., 2007d). Contracuna had been carrying out small scale underground mining 

at El Compas until the final payment was made, at which time all mining activity 

was halted. The rental mining agreement is valid for 10 years from the date of 

signing, and expires on July 12, 2012.  

 

On June 4, 2007, The Company signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement 

with Sr. Antonio Alvarado Reyes, the owner of the El Compas concession (Oro 

Silver Resources Ltd., 2007b). $100,000 was paid upon signing of the formal 

agreement. The Company can acquire 100% ownership of the concession by 

making payments totaling $2.6 million, staged over a 2 year period from the 

signing date. On May 23, 2008, The Company earned a 51% equity interest in 

the property by making payments totaling $1.6 million to Mr. Alvarado (Oro Silver 

Resources Ltd., 2008a).  

 

As part of the agreement with Mr. Alvarado the Company also obtained 

access to approximately 5,788 meters of drill core from 20 holes, and related 

reporting, drilling, mapping, and sampling data. This work was performed in 2005 

by Minera Hochschild Mexico, S.A. de C.V ("MHM"), and information was 

provided to Mr. Alvarado on completion of the program. MHM reported 

US$709,490 in expenditures on the Property (Martinez Mendoza, 2005).  

 

On July 5, 2007 The Company signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement 

with David Alejandro Espinoso Duenas, for 5 mineral concessions totaling 

320.4743 hectares that expand the Company's land position in the El Compas 

area (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 2007c). The concessions are Ana Camila, Ana 

Camila, Ana Camila Fracc 1, Ana Camila Fracc 1, and El Sol. $50,000 was paid 

upon signing of the formal agreement. The Company can acquire 100% 

ownership of the concession by making payments totaling $30,000, staged over 



 

35 

 

a 2 year period from the signing date. As of July 5, 2008, The Company had 

earned a 51% equity interest in the property by making payments totaling 

$150,000 to Mr. Espinoso. 

 

On Aug 22, 2008 The Company signed a Binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") with 

Exploraciones Del Altiplano S.A de C.V. that establishes the terms of an 

exploration agreement and purchase option on six mineral concessions (Oro 

Silver Resources Aug 2008b). The six concessions to be included in the final 

agreement and covered by the LOI are adjacent to and expand the the current 

land holdings of The Company at El Compas, and total some 1,285 hectares. 

The six concessions are Don Luis Del Oro, La Virgen 2, La Casi Virgen 2, La 

Casi Virgen 3 Fracc. A & B, and La Casi Virgen 6. The acquisition terms require 

the Company to pay $10,000 and granted 75,000 common shares of Oro Silver 

on the signing date, followed by cash payments totaling US$1,475,000 over a 4 

year period and to make work expenditures on the concessions totaling 

US$1,000,000 and to conduct 1,000m of drilling over the 4 year period. The 

Company will acquire a 51% interest in the properties by the end of year 3 and a 

100% interest by the end of year 4, subject to a 3% NSR, half of which can be 

purchased by the Company for a total of US$1,500,000. 

 

No other royalties, back-ins or encumbrances are known by the authors to 

exist on any of the properties. 

 

6.4 Surface Rights 

The surface rights in the vicinity of the historic El Compas and El Orito mine 

workings are owned by a number of private individuals and in one case by a 

business entity. The surface rights covering the area of recent focused 

exploration by the Company, including the El Compas and El Orito resource 

areas, are owned by Jose Antonio De La Torre Duenas. An agreement is 



 

36 

 

believed to exist between Mr. De La Torre and Francisco De La Cerda, owner 

and operator of a large scale building stone quarry located internal to Mr. De La 

Torre's property south of the historic El Compas Shaft mine workings, which 

grants access and exploitation rights to Mr. De La Cerda in order to carry out his 

business interests. The southern extension of the El Compas vein structure 

crosses the quarry workings. 

 

In the past the Company has been granted permission in writing by Mr. de la 

Torre and other adjacent surface rights owners to carry out surface exploration, 

including drilling, on a temporary basis, but no long term agreements have yet 

been established. It is the company's intention to negotiate longer term rental or 

purchase options in the near future starting with Mr. De La Torre. It is not known 

whether the surface rights belonging to Mr. De la Torre or the internal area 

granted to Mr. De la Cerda have been legally surveyed.  

 

Immediately west of the El Compas vein system and adjacent to the western 

limit of the de la Torre property the surface rights are owned by Santa Rita Grupo 

S.A de C.V., ("Santa Rita"), a major land developer active in the Zacatecas city 

area. Santa Rita is currently active at the north end of the project area within the 

Ana Camila concession, where it owns surface rights, and is developing a large-

scale residencial sub-division. 

    

6.5 Environmental Liabilities and Required Permits 

The authors are not aware of any significant environmental issues on the 

Property. Numerous abandoned shafts, pits, and collapsed workings occur on 

the property, some of which have been secured by metal grates and fencing. A 

number of these historic workings have small waste dumps containing low 

concentrations of sulphides. An area of old tailings has also been tentatively 

identified. The Company has not completed any environmental due diligence.  



 

37 

 

 

Exploration work carried out by the Company at El Compas has been in full 

compliance with current environmental regulation. In the case of the 2007-08 

drilling campaign the Company was required to register a work program (Aviso 

de Inicio de Actividades) with the Secretary of Environment and Natural 

Resources (SEMARNAT), which it did on Nov. 9, 2007. The report was prepared 

by Joel Espinosa Rivera of Bufete de Servicios Tecnicos Forestales y de Fauna 

Silvestre, and submitted by Rolando Mendoza Pina of MGTZ, contractor to Oro 

Silver.  

 

The Company has been granted permission in the past in writing by Mr. de la 

Torre and others with surface rights in the El Compas and El Orito areas, in order 

to carry out surface exploration including drilling on a temporary basis.  

 

Oro Silver recorded the surface conditions at El Compas on digital photos 

prior to commencing exploration activities. 

 

A large, active quarry operation occurs on the south part of the property. The 

authors are unable to comment whether this operation conforms to Mexican 

environmental and mining law. 

 

There is potential for problems arising from the close proximity of the 

Property to the urban area of Zacatecas, although open pit and underground 

mining is currently taking place within, and very close to Zacatecas and 

Guadalupe.

7.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCUTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

The property is accessed by all-weather gravel road, 1.7 km from the 

southern part of the city of Zacatecas (Figure 6.1). Land use in the area is open 

range cattle ranching, building stone quarries, and recent housing development. 

 

The climate and vegetation is typical of the high altitude physiographic Mesa 

Central, with a summer rainy season from May to September averaging 15.6°C, 

and dry winters from December to February, with an average temperature of 

10°C. Total annual precipitation is about 427 millimeters, and the average annual 

temperature is about 13.6°C (www.wunderground.com). The elevation of the 

airport is 2,140 meters, and the city of Zacatecas lies at about 2,430 meters. 

 

The physiography of the region is dominated by basin-and-range type 

topography, with broad north-northeast trending valleys separated by narrow 

mountain ranges. Zacatecas city, and the property, occurs in the Sierras de 

Zacatecas. The Graben de Calera lies to the west of the property. Topographic 

relief on the property is low, and vegetation is dominantly cactus, maguey, sage 

and grass, with rare Yucca. Pirules line the arroyos. 

 

Zacatecas is the state capital, and with adjoining Guadalupe, are modern 

and fully serviced. The city is the second largest in the state after Fresnillo, with a 

population of 118,562 (2005, http: //www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacatecas). The 

Pan American highway connects the city to other major centers by road, and an 

international airport connects Zacatecas with Mexico City and the U.S. by daily 

flights. Power, water, and telecommunication are readily accessible from the 

Property.

8.0 HISTORY 
 

8.1 Production History of the Region 

Mexico is the second largest silver producer in the world after Peru (2006, 

http://www.silverinstitute.org/supply/production.php), down from its previous 

position as the top global silver producer. This position is chiefly due to 

production from Zacatecas state, at Fresnillo and Somberete. Zacatecas state 

produces more silver than all other Mexican states combined 

(http://www.coremisgm.gob.mx/productos/anuario/Capitulo_2.pdf). Zacatecas 

was founded in 1546, after the discovery of silver vein systems by Juan de 

Tolosa, and it likely experienced some pre-Hispanic exploitation. In a little more 

than a century afterwards, Zacatecas became Mexico's largest silver producer, 

and the city was the second largest in the country after Mexico City. As in many 

mining districts in Mexico, production ceased during the Mexican Revolution of 

1910 to 1917. Production resumed in some areas by about 1936. Historic silver 

production estimates exceed 1.5 billion ounces from the state, and 750 million 

ounces from the Zacatecas district (Ponce and Clark, 1988). 

 

8.2 History of the El Compas Property 

The history of the El Compas area is poorly recorded. The El Orito mining 

district was first exploited in 1570, and intermittently thereafter to about the time 

of the Mexican Revolution (Salas Vazquez, 2001). Most historic exploitation was 

by small-scale shaft mining. The two largest shafts in the resource area are 

located on the El Compas concession and are known as El Compas, and La 

Predilecta (Figure 8.1). The El Compas Shaft has a reported depth of 115 m 

(Salas Vazquez, 2001), while the depths of mining shafts on the northern part of 

the concession, and to the northeast at El Orito are unknown. Other historical 

workings are known to exist on the property but which have not yet been 

http://www.coremisgm.gob.mx/productos/anuario/Capitulo_2.pdf


 

40 

 

investigated by the Company. An area of old tailings was tentatively identified 

below the El Compas shaft (Tarnocai, 2007).

From the mid 1990's until the present a number of companies have explored 

the El Orito district.  

 

Monarch Resources Limited conducted exploration in the area in 1996 that 

included 829.03m of diamond core drilling in 4 holes ("MLV" holes) that tested 

the El Compas 2 and Escuadra Veins, located about 600 m east of the El 

Compas Vein (MHM internal data file, 2005). The results of the drilling are not 

known. 

 

The Consejo de Recursos Mexicanos mapped and sampled the surface and 

underground exposures on the El Compas Claim in 2001 (Salas Vazquez, 2001), 

and produced a non-NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate.  

 

Aurcana Corporation conducted exploration in the area in 2003-2004 that 

included 1,898.58m of diamond core drilling in 9 holes ("LVDD" holes) that further 

tested the El Compas 2 vein (MHM internal data file, 2005). One of these holes is 

reported to have intercepted 13.2 g/t Au over 4.46m (non-NI 43-101compliant). 

 

Boliden Mining Company conducted exploration in the area prior to Minera 

Hochschild but the exact dates are not known (MHM internal data file, 2005). 

According to Minera Hochschild documents Boliden drilled four diamond core 

holes ("BDDV" holes) that targeted the El Compas 2 vein south of the historic 

Aurcana drilling. One of the holes intercepted mineralization grading 3.45 g/t Au 

and 25 g/t Ag over 0.55m (non-NI 43-101 compliant). 

 

Contracuna l, S.A de C.V worked the El Compas veins by underground 

ramp-in-ore mining from about 2002 until late 2007. The mining rate from 2002 

until late-2006 was estimated by Oro Silver to be 50 to 100 tonnes per day, with 

an average weighted head grade of 4.67g/t Au and 86.74 g/t Ag, based on 



 

43 

 

incomplete records for 55,140 tonnes of ore shipped to the Veta Grande mill 

(non-NI 43-101 compliant).  

 

Minera Hochschild de Mexico S.A. de C.V. extensively explored the El Orito 

district during 2005. A major part of the program involved focused work at the El 

Compas vein system.  

 

District-wide surface exploration by MHM identified numerous targets 

characterized by north and/or northwest trending mineralized veins and faults, 

eight of which were tested by diamond drilling. In total 5,516m of drilling in 20 NQ 

holes were completed. Results of the drilling (non-NI 43-101compliant) confirmed 

the presence of significant gold and silver grades at depth in a number of the 

target structures tested. Significant results include 15.19 g/t Au and 155 g/t Ag 

over 1.05 m from the El Compas 4 vein, located roughly 1.4 km southeast of the 

El Compas vein.  

 

Significant historic drilling results by the exploration companies referred to 

above are shown in Table 8.1. It is not known if the data is complete, and none of 

it is considered to be NI 43-101 compliant. 

 

At El Compas MHM carried out 1:1000 scale surface mapping, and collected 

60 surface outcrop and 469 underground channel samples for analysis. Twenty 

HQ and NQ diamond core holes totaling 5,788m tested the El Compas vein 

structure over nearly 1,000 m of horizontal strike length, at about 25 to 50 m 

spacing in the mine area, and about 100 m spacing south of the mine, at depths 

of 60 to 400 metres below surface. Results of drilling confirmed the presence of 

significant gold and silver grades at depth, particularly within the Adit Zone ore 

chute. The results of the MHM drilling at El Compas were utilized in the current 

resource estimate.

Oro Silver Resources Ltd. personnel first visited the El Compas property in 

September 2006 and completed a preliminary field evaluation of the El Compas 

concession that included surface mapping, and select surface and underground 

sampling. Results of the underground sampling confirmed historical production 

grades reported by Contracuna. 

 

Following successful negotiation of the mineral rights to the El Compas 

concession and being granted access to the historic MHM El Compas drill core a 

comprehensive exploration program was initiated in April 2007 that included 

detailed surface mapping, additional surface sampling, and the collection of three 

hundred and seventy channel samples from the El Compas underground 

workings. Minera Hochschild core was re-logged, and 80 core samples originally 



 

45 

 

submitted by MHM for analysis were quarter sawn and reanalyzed by the 

Company. Additionally, 1,025 half core samples were prepared by the Company 

from previously non-sampled intervals of MHM drill core and submitted for 

analysis.  

 

In September 2007 the Company filed a technical report on the El Compas 

property for NI 43-101 purposes (Thiboutot and Tarnocai, 2007).  

 

From November 2007 to April 2008 the Company completed a Phase 1 

diamond drill program consisting of 5,399.43 metres of HQ diameter core in 

thirty-seven surface exploration holes at the El Compas and El Orito vein targets, 

from which 1,498 samples were prepared and submitted for analysis.  

 

8.3 Production History at El Compas 

The El Compas veins were exploited by underground ramp-in-ore mining by 

Contracuna from about 2002 until 2007. Production information was compiled by 

Oro Silver (Charles Tarnocai, 2007) with assistance from mill staff. Oro Silver 

believes the production information is incomplete. The mining rate since 2002 is 

estimated between 50 to 100 tonnes per day (Sr. Gutierrez, pers. comm. 2006; 

Unnamed, 2005a). Ore is processed at the Contracuna mill in Veta Grande. An 

average weighted head grade of 4.67g/t Au and 86.74 g/t Ag was calculated from 

incomplete records for 55,140 tonnes of ore shipped to the mill (Table 8.2). 

Samples of crushed ore were occasionally analyzed by Contracuna I S.A. de C.V 

at their Veta Grande mill-site. Oro Silver personnel did not observe either the 

sample collection or analysis methods, and the results are not NI 43-101 

compliant. Oro Silver Resources considers the results an indication of grade and 

potential at El Compas.

9.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

9.1 Regional Geology 

Zacatecas lies on the margin of the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Sierra 

Madre Occidental ("SMO") geologic province. To the north are exposed 

Mesozoic marine sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Mesa Central geologic 

province (Figure 9.1). The boundary zone between the Sierra Madre Occidental 

and Mesa Central geologic provinces is marked by the northwest trending Rio 

Santa Maria fault system (Albinson, 1988; Nieto-Samaniego et al., 2005; Aranda-

Gomez et al., 2007), extending from at least Durango in the northwest, to San 

Luis Potosi in the southeast. The Tertiary volcanic rocks which presumably 

overlay older rocks of the Mesa Central have been uplifted and eroded. The Rio 

Santa Maria fault zone also separates a region of lower elevation and lower relief 

to the north, from higher elevation and higher relief topography to the south 

(Figure 9.2).

9.2 Geology of the Zacatecas Area 

The geology of the region (Figure 9.3) has been mapped and described by 

Caballero Martinez and Rivera Venegas (1999) and Caballero Martinez and 

Rivera Venegas et al. (1999), and references therein. 

 

Mesozoic rocks occur north and west of Guadalupe and Zacatecas. The 

oldest rocks in the region are upper Triassic phyllites, arenites, and limestone of 

the Zacatecas Formation, and overlying upper Jurassic to Cretaceous phylite, 

silty limestone, and volcanic rocks of the Chilitos Formation. The western part of 

the Sierra de Zacatecas is underlain by lower members of the Chilitos Formation, 

and the eastern part by volcanic rock-dominant upper members of the Chilitos 

Formation. The Chilitos and Zacatecas Formations are gently north to northeast 

dipping. 

 

Disconformably overlying the Chilitos Formation, and outcropping in 

Zacatecas and Guadalupe, is the lower Tertiary Conglomerado Rojo de 

Zacatecas. This unit is dated at 29 to 50.9 Ma (Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007). This 

red-purple polymict conglomerate unit is correlated with the Conglomerado Rojo 

de Guanajuato, and other continental red bed occurrences in the Mesa Central. 

The occurrence of this congolmerate provides evidence of pre-Oligocene 

extension (Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007) that predates extension temporally 

related to volcanism of the SMO. Discordantly overlying the Chilitos Formation 

and Conglomerado Rojo de Zacatecas are felsic volcanic rocks of the SMO. 

Rocks of the SMO occur south of Zacatecas and Guadalupe, the lowermost part 

of which is the Calerilla-Guadalupe Formation (46.8 Ma), comprising a thin, 

discontinuous volcanic breccia. The La Virgen Formation (36.8 Ma) overlies the 

Calerilla-Guadalupe Formation, comprising thick-bedded ignimbrite and minor 

rhyolite tuff. The Los Alamitos Formation is an overlying, Miocene-aged ash flow 

with lithic fragments, up to 40 meters thick. Partially welded, biotite phyric 



 

51 

 

ashflows of the Pliocene La Capilla Formation, up to 100 m thick, cap the 

sequence. 

 

Tertiary felsic plugs and dykes cut all units. Intermediate plugs and dykes of 

Mesozoic age, locally known as the Roca Verde, intrude the Mesozoic sequence. 

Early Cenozoic to Mesozoic rocks have been affected by Laramide shortening, 

and all rocks are cut by faults related to mid to late Tertiary extension. Extension 

was episodic, occurring at 26 to 27 Ma, 24Ma, and 11Ma (Aranda-Gomez et al., 

1998; Nieto-Samaniego et al., 1999). Tertiary faults are N-S to NNE, NW, and 

occasionally NE trending. The timing relation between these fabrics is uncertain, 

though the lack of consistent cross-cutting relations (Aranda-Gomez et al., 1989) 

suggests faults experienced coeval motion. Aranda-Gomez and others (2007) 

observe NW faults cut by N-S faults in the Zacatecas area. The timing of initial 

motion on the Rio Santa Maria fault may be 27 to 32 Ma (Aranda-Gomez et al., 

2007), older than extension affecting rocks of the SMO and the roughly 11Ma 

age of most N-S faulting. Red bed sedimentary sequences are suggested by the 

same workers as temporally related to the early phase of extension, and spatially 

related to the structures accommodating that extension. 

 

Epithermal vein systems in Mexico largely date from 48Ma to 18Ma 

(Camprubi et al., 2003), and are controlled by Tertiary extensional structura 

fabrics, as is volcanism of the SMO. In the Zacatecas region, most vein systems 

are closely associated with the intersection of NW and N-S trending faults 

(Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007), though the first-order control appears to be the NW 

trending fault fabrics of the Rio Santa Maria fault zone. The nearby vein systems 

at Fresnillo and Real de Angeles have been respectively dated at 32-28 Ma 

(Lang et al., 1988) and 45.2 Ma (Harder, 1987; Pearson et al., 1988), suggesting 

an Eocene to Oligocene age for intermediate sulphidation state veins in the 

Zacatecas area. The timing for mineralization therefore corresponds to the initial 



 

52 

 

phases of felsic volcanism in the SMO, and motion along the northwest trending 

Rio Santa Maria fault zone. 

 

Zacatecas hosts low to intermediate sulphidation style vein systems, and 

exhalative base and precious metal sulphide systems (Figure 9.4). Intermediate 

sulphidation state vein systems (Veta Grande, San Acacio) occur in the Chilitos 

Formation. These are Ag-rich base metal+quartz+calcite veins and breccias, with 

very low Au content (typically <1 g/t Au in ore) and abundant sulphides. Low 

sulphidation veins occur in the El Orito Zone (Zona Aurifera del Sur of Ocejo 

Paredes, 1979), and are unique to the district. They are Au-rich, Ag-poor (Ag/Au 

of about 6.7:1 to 20:1), with very low total sulphide and base metal content. 

Epithermal veins with a low sulphidation affinity occur in both the Chilitos 

Formation, and overlying felsic volcanic rocks of the La Virgen Formation. 

Exhalative sulphide mineralization (San Nicholas, Francisco I Madero) occur in 

the marine sedimentary rock sequence of the Mesa Central. 

 

The Cozamin deposit is described as an intermediate sulphidation vein 

system, overprinted by an intrusion-related disseminated sulphide system 

(Christopher and Giroux, 2005). At a 1% Cu cut-off Cozamin contains 2.76 Mt at 

85.4 g/t Ag, 2.5% Cu, 0.47%Pb, and 1.12%Zn in the Measured and Indicated 

resource category.

9.3 General Property Geology 

The property geology has been described by Salas Vazquez (2001) and 

MHM (anonymous, 2005), and by Tarnocai (May 13, 2007). 

 

The El Compas project area is underlain by andesite and phyllite of the 

Chilitos Formation in the north, and felsic volcanic rocks of the La Virgen 

Formation in the south and east. (Figure 9.5). The La Virgin Formation is a thick 

sequence of massive, columnar jointed Tertiary ignimbrites, rhyolite flows, and 

sandstone. Contact and fiamme measurements collected by the Company from 

ignimbrite exposures in the vicinity of the El Compas mine indicate a mean strike 

of 110º, dipping 11º to the south-southeast. Midway between the El Compas Adit 

and Shaft zones the Escuadra fault (NW1 fault in the Resource model), an 

important NW striking and SW dipping district scale structure, cuts the local 

stratigraphy and has juxtaposed Chilitos Formation and La Virgen rocks in fault 

contact with one another at surface.

9.4 Veins and Faults 

Numerous fault-hosted veins occur on the Property. Faults and veins are 

primarily north-south trending and steep west to vertical dipping. Northwest 

trending faults and fault-veins are moderate to steep southwest dipping.  

 

On the El Compas claim north and northwest trending fault-veins merge 

across zones of curvilinear veins, faults, veinlets and fault-related cleavages. 

Fault-veins correspond to areas of steeper topographic gradient, suggesting fault 

motion has at least partially controlled topography. In felsic rocks, faults are 

characterized by narrow fault cores containing gouge, quartz-matrix breccias, 

sheeted quartz veins, and single planar veins. Damage zones in the fault walls 

are narrow zones, and cleavage intensity and quartz veinlet density decrease 

away from the fault core. Veins occupying the fault core are typically <1m in 

width. Rocks of the Chilitos Formation are cut by more numerous faults and 

cleavages, and veins occupying the fault cores are often >1m wide. In the El 

Compas ramp, the anastomosing Veta Bajo and Veta Alto (referred to collectively 

as the El Compas veins by MHM) are typically separated by 2 meters of wallrock, 

and are individually 2 to 4 meters in width. Where these structures merge, 

continuous vein widths up to 22 meters are observed. Furthermore, drilling has 

confirmed that ore extraction from the El Compas UG mine comes from a steep 

north plunging to subvertical chute within the plane of the Veta Bajo and Veta 

Alto veins.  

 

9.5 Vein Textures and Mineralogy 

At the El Compas concession northerly trending veins in the Chilitos 

Formation have finely banded, colliform, and crustiform open space fill textures. 

Bladed quartz after calcite textures are common. Veins in felsic rocks are 

comprised of saccharoidal to fine-grained quartz, banded veins. Wider veins in 

felsic rocks are observed in the Cantera pit and at the El Compas shaft. These 



 

58 

 

veins show breccia and bladed quartz-after calcite textures. Calcite is observed 

in bands in large andesite-hosted quartz veins, and in veinlets distal to 

mineralized zones in very weakly propylitized rocks. Within the El Compas ramp 

the widest calcite veins (>0.75m, both black and white coarse grained calcite) 

occur as northwest trending veins. Large northerly trending calcite veins have not 

been observed on surface or in the El Compas ramp; however, thick calcite-rich 

quartz veins were intersected by drilling at deeper levels below the mine and 

elsewhere that appear to correlate with the north-south trending El Compas and 

other veins. Sulphide abundance in veins rarely exceeds 5%, and is most 

abundant in the mineralized veins. Pyrite or pyrhottite are the most common 

sulphides. Rare sphalerite and exotic copper was observed at the 7th level of the 

El Compas ramp. Magnetite was identified in panned concentrates from the 

mineralized veins. 

 

9.6 Wallrock Alteration 

Intense argillic alteration with strong Fe-oxide is observed at the andesite-

rhyolite contact on the first level of the ramp. In the andesite, narrow zones of 

argillic alteration occur in the wallrocks to quartz veins and some veinlets. 

Chlorite and fine-grained epidote alteration of the propylitic zone, occurs as distal 

alteration associated with the quartz veins. The width of the propylitic zone is up 

to 5 times the vein width. In rhyolite, proximal wallrock alteration comprises 

narrow zones of silicification, fracture controlled Fe-oxide and argillic alteration.  

 



 

59 

 

10.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 
 

The El Compas and El Orito veins have the characteristics of a low 

sulphidation epithermal vein system, and occur in a region characterized by 

numerous, high Ag-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal vein systems. 

 

Epithermal systems may be classified as high, intermediate, and low 

sulphidation styles. They are characterized by the sulphidation state of the 

hypogene sulphide mineral assemblage, and show general relations in volcano-

tectonic setting, precious and base metal content, igneous rock association, 

proximal hypogene alteration, and sulphide abundance (ie., John, 2001; Sillitoe 

and Hedenquist, 2003). Ore in all occurrences of the type form under epizonal 

conditions, that is, generally within 2 kilometers of the paleo-surface. Veins in 

epithermal systems often display epizonal textures indicative of repetitive and 

sustained open-space filling, and boiling. 

 

Significant members of the low sulphidation class of epithermal systems 

include Sleeper, Midas, and El Penon. Those associated with bimodal basalt-

rhyolite sequences and subalkaline magmas display illite proximal alteration 

zones, with adularia and local fluorite. They generally display low total sulphide 

content (<2 volume %). Base metal sulphides occur in very low abundance, and 

systems tend to be Au-rich. Selenides are common in some systems. The 

alkaline magma associated systems (not under consideration here) are 

temporally associated with alkaline basalt and trachyte, have roscoelite-bearing 

illite+adularia proximal alteration, more abundant sulphides (up to 10% volume), 

and selenides are uncommon. Both subclasses contain pyrrhotite, pyrite, and 

minor arsenopyrite. Low sulphidation epithermal systems often have Ag:Au ≤15, 

and <200 ppm Cu (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003). 

 



 

60 

 

Low sulphidation epithermal veins are generally not considered transitional to 

intermediate sulphidation state epithermal systems (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 

2003), although this is based solely on the different tectonic environments under 

which they may typically form. It does not exclude them from occurring in a 

similar area however. Significant members of the intermediate sulphidation 

epithermal class are well represented in Mexico, and include Fresnillo and 

Pachuca-Real del Monte. They are related to andesite, rhyodacite and 

occasionally rhyolite sequences. Adularia is rare to absent in the proximal 

alteration assemblage, and the gangue contains abundant, often manganiferous, 

carbonate. Sulphide content in veins typically exceeds 5% volume, and comprise 

pyrite, Fe-poor sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and tennanite-tetrahedrite. 

 

Selenides and pyrrhotite are uncommon, and Mexican examples tend to be 

Ag-rich, with Ag:Au exceeding 10:1, and often >100:1. Most significant members 

of both classes have vertical mineralized extents of <1km, often <500 m. Ore is 

hosted by fault-related veins and breccias, and elevated precious metal content 

occurs in plunging, lenticular zones within the plane of the vein ("chutes"). 

 

Vertical zonations in metal content occur in some low and intermediate 

sulphidation state systems (ie, Albinson et al., 2001). In systems displaying such 

zoning, gold, silver, mercury and tellurium are relatively enriched in the upper 

portions of the system, and base metal contents occur in higher concentrations at 

deeper levels in the system.

11.0 MINERALIZATION 
 

Both the El Compas and El Orito vein systems have received historic 

artisanal exploitation, while the El Compas vein has also experienced recent 

small scale mechanized exploitation. In both areas veins may occur singularly or 

as sheeted zones, and can vary substantially in width along strike and down dip.  

 

11.1 El Compas Vein System 

Five veins comprise the El Compas vein system, of which at least 4 have 

experienced exploitation; the N-S trending Veta Bajo, Veta Alto (collectively the 

El Compas, or V1 vein), and the Veta Soledad (V3 vein), and the NW trending 

Predelicta vein (Figure 8.1). The longest veins have discontinuous mapped strike 

extents of 415 meters (Veta Bajo and Veta Alto) and 850 meters (Veta Soledad) 

or more. Numerous other veins are identified from mapping. The widest veins, 

and those that have experienced the majority of the exploitation on the property, 

are the north-south trending veins. The Predelicta vein contains more abundant 

calcite and is moderate to steep dipping, but is otherwise similar in occurrence to 

the steep-dipping N-S trending veins on the property. Exploitation has occurred 

on both N-S and NW trending veins in the La Virgen Formation felsic volcanic 

rocks and the underlying Chilitos Formation volcanic and sedimentary rocks. 

Although numerous pits and small shafts occur on the El Compas veins, 

longitudinal sections show extraction was selective, occurring in two subvertical 

ore chutes; one at the El Compas Shaft on the N-S trending Soledad vein, and 

the other at the El Compas Adit on the parallel Veta Bajo and Veta Alto veins. 

These ore chutes are between 130m (El Compas shaft) and 250m wide (El 

Compas Adit). Presumably, selective exploitation occurred in areas of higher 

precious metal grade. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that ore chute 

development occurs along the N-S structures where they are intersected by NW 

fault-veins and vein arrays. Observations suggest the veins are wider in the 



 

62 

 

Chilitos Formation than in the overlying rhyolite. Stockwork quartz veinlets occur 

at the base of the rhyolite. 

 

11.2 El Orito Vein System 

At El Orito mineralized veins strike north and dip steeply west to vertical, and 

are hosted entirely within sediments of the Chilitos Formation. A small vertical 

shaft of uncertain depth and related waste dump attest to minor historical 

artisanal workings here.  

 

11.3 Characteristics of Mineralization 

Veins are predominantly of white quartz-calcite, but abundant banded 

greenish chalcedonic quartz may also be present, as is the case for the El 

Compas Adit zone. Minor concentrations of fine disseminated pyrite and 

pyrrhotite are observed in some veins, as is magnetite. Fe-oxide occurs after 

pyrite and coating fracture surfaces. Black manganese oxide is also observed 

locally on fracture surfaces. 

 

The El Compas and El Orito veins are clearly epizonal in nature, displaying 

abundant bladed quartz-after-calcite textures indicative of shallow boiling, and 

banded, colloform and crustiform layering indicative of repetitive open-space 

filling. Brecciated textures are also commonly observed. 

 

Economic mineralization appears to be associated with white saccharoidal 

quartz, and also with finely disseminated to very finely banded black (Ag) 

sulphide. In some very high-grade drill intercepts at the Adit Zone "ginguro" type 

mineralization has been observed in quartz veins, consisting of millimeter-sized 

patches of fine black (Ag) sulphide together with fine blebs of native gold (drill 



 

63 

 

hole 08COM008). Wire silver is also observed locally in vugs (drill hole 

08COM028). 

 

Drill data suggests that structural control of economic grade mineralization is 

rather poor. While economic grade mineralization is nearly always constrained to 

within the limits of a given vein zone, there is a strong tendency for it to migrate 

between the footwall to the hangingwall contacts over relatively short distances in 

all directions, and may also be present in minor splays.   

 

High Au relative to Ag (Ag:Au 6.7 to 20:1), very low sulphide abundance, the 

occurrence of magnetite, pyrite and pyrrhotite, and general lack of base metal 

sulphides observed in the underground workings, all suggest the El Compas is 

most closely affiliated with a low sulphidation style epithermal system. However, 

the analysis of drill data from deeper in the system indicates that the Ag:Au ratio 

generally increases with depth, and that the average for all mineralized drill 

intercepts is about 40:1.  Table 11.1 summarizes the change in the ratio as a 

function of depth for mineralized drill intercepts in the two resource areas.

12.0 EXPLORATION 
 

12.1 Exploration by Minera Hochschild 

At the El Compas vein system Minera Hochschild conducted 1:1000 scale 

surface mapping, and collected 60 surface and 469 underground channel 

samples for analysis. Twenty HQ and NQ diamond core holes totaling 5,788m 

tested the El Compas vein structure over nearly 1,000 m of horizontal strike 

length on 25 to 50 m spaced EW section lines in the mine area, and about 100 m 

spaced lines south of the mine, to depths of 60 to 400 metres below surface. 

Assay results from the MHM drill program at El Compas were utilized in the 

current resource estimation. Drill hole locations are shown in Figure 12.1, and 

drilling results are summarized in Table 12.1. Significant results include 55.87 g/t 

Au and 368 g/t Ag over 2.50 m (not true width) from drill hole HOC-16, from 

beneath the El Compas ramp. Assay certificates for the MHM drill results were 

presented in an earlier technical report on the El Compas Property (Tarnocai and 

Thiboutot, 2007), and are not repeated here. Total expenditures at El Compas 

were $US 709,490 (Martinez, 2005).  

 

In an earlier technical report on the El Compas Property (Tarnocai, C. and 

Thiboutot, H. 2007) it was stated that MHM analysed a total of 825 drill core 

samples. That number was revised to 926 samples in this report after additional 

drill information was identified by the Company. The current Oro Silver drill 

database for the purposes of this study reflects these additions to the original 

MHM drill database.

12.2 Exploration by Oro Silver 

Oro Silver Resources Ltd. personnel first visited the El Compas property in 

September of 2006. Between September and October of 2006 Mr. Charles 

Tarnocai and Ms. Anna Fonseca conducted a preliminary field evaluation of the 

El Compas concession that included surface mapping, and select surface and 

underground sampling. Mr. Tarnocai was again in the field in February, 2007. 

Results of the underground sampling confirmed historical production grades 

reported by Contracuna. 

 

Based upon the positive results of preliminary investigations a more 

comprehensive exploration program was undertaken. Detailed surface mapping, 

and surface and underground sampling took place from March through mid-June, 

2007, concurrent with negotiations for the El Compas claim mining and 

concession rights. A total of 25 surface and 22 select underground samples were 

collected. The underground samples evaluated the relationship between grade 

and different vein types exposed in the ramp. Results indicated that both north 

and northwest components of the El Compas vein system carry precious metal 

mineralization. By the end of May 2007 three hundred and seventy, 1 meter rock 

chip samples in forty-six channels spaced at about 25 meters apart along the El 

Compas mine ramp had been collected and were submitted for analysis. The 

results of the channel sample program are summarized in Table 12.2. Assay 

certificates for OSR channel samples were presented in an earlier technical 

report on the El Compas Property (Tarnocai and Thiboutot, 2007), and are not 

repeated here. The average (true) width for 46 channels cut across the veins is 

8.02 meters. The authors caution that veins typically vary in width along strike, 

and down dip. 

 

In September 2007 the Company filed its first technical report on the El 

Compas property for NI 43-101 purposes (Thiboutot and Tarnocai, 2007).  

 



 

68 

 

Starting in October 2007, historic MHM core acquired from the owner of the 

El Compas concession as part of the option agreement was re-logged for 

lithology, alteration, mineralization, and vein percent. As a validation check of 

historical assays, approximately 10% of the 825 samples originally prepared and 

submitted by MHM for analysis were re-sampled by the Company.  Eighty 

quarter core samples were prepared from remaining half core using a diamond 

core saw and submitted for analysis. An additional 1,025 half core samples were 

prepared by the Company from previously non-sampled intervals of MHM drill 

core and also submitted for analysis.  

 

During late 2007 the results of OSR work, in conjunction with available 

historical data, were used to define and prioritize drill targets for a 5,000 metre 

diamond drill program. The overall objectives of the program were the delineation 

of the El Compas Adit and Shaft zone ore chutes to greater depth, and the 

evaluation of parallel structures. An additional objective was the discovery of one 

or more new, and potentially economic, mineralized ore chutes, and a preliminary 

evaluation of their size. 

 

From November 2007 to April 2008 the Company completed a Phase 1 

diamond drill program consisting of 5,399.43 metres of HQ diameter core in 

thirty-seven surface exploration holes over portions of the El Compas and El 

Orito vein systems, from which a total of 1,498 core samples were prepared and 

submitted for analysis.  The El Compas shaft zone drilling was not completed as 

originally proposed following reinterpretation of available data. The maximum 

hole depth for the 37 holes was 246.55m, and the average hole depth was 

145.93m. Results of the Oro Silver drill program confirmed and expanded on 

results obtained by MHM in 2005. The results from both MHM and Oro Silver 

drilling were utilized in the current resource estimate.  

 



 

69 

 

A detailed survey of the underground openings and channel sample locations 

was completed by May 2008. The underground survey data was utilized to 

construct a three dimensional void model for resource modeling purposes. 

 

All aspects of exploration work were supervised at site on a day-to-day basis 

by Oro Silver's Chief Geologist Charles Tarnocai from September 2006 through 

June 2007, and by Senior Project Manager Eric Grill from September 2007 

through August 2008. Both persons reported to Hervé Thiboutot, Oro Silver's 

Vice President of Exploration. Mr. Thiboutot made regular monthly visits to the 

project during the entire exploration period.

13.0 DRILLING 
 

The extent of drilling by MHM in the El Compas resource area is summarized 

in Section 12.  

 

13.1 Drilling by Oro Silver 

Between November 2007 and April 2008 the Oro Silver completed 5,399.43 

metres of HQ diameter diamond core drilling in thirty-seven surface exploration 

holes that tested the El Compas and El Orito veins systems. Location of Phase l 

drill holes are shown in Figure 13.1. 

 

At El Compas 30 drill holes (07COM001-006, 08COM008, 010-025, 027-028, 

and 032-036), tested the El Compas vein system over 1.55 km of strike length, 

and drilling was successfully completed in all but two of the originally proposed 

target areas. Drilling of the Old El Compas Shaft zone below historical workings 

was abandoned before completing the first hole following geologic re-

interpretation of historical data that suggested the ore chute probably did not 

continue deeper than historical workings. Another target area, located about 

250m south of the Shaft Zone near the Cantera Pit, where the El Compas (V1) 

vein converges with the Soledad (V3) vein, was not be completed because 

access permission could not be secured in time. 

 

Approximately 300m to the east of the El Compas Adit, 7 holes (08COM007, 

009, 026, 029-031, and 037) tested the El Orito vein system over 200m of strike 

length, and up to 150m below surface, in the vicinity of historic workings.

The majority of El Compas drill holes and all El Orito drill holes were drilled 

from west towards east, owing that mineralized veins strike predominantly north 

and dip moderately to steeply west in both areas. Drill hole inclination ranged 

from -45 to -76 degrees. The maximum hole depth for the program was 246.55m, 

and the average was 152.90m. A total of 1,498 core samples were prepared and 

submitted for analysis.  

 

Drilling was performed by two contractors and is summarized in Table 13.1.

The proposed drill hole azimuth was marked out at the prepared drill site by a 

surveyor prior to arrival of the drill, using wooden stakes to identify the drill collar 

location, and also the fore-site and back-site, corrected for magnetic declination 

by adding 7.5 degrees. The drill azimuth and inclination were again verified 

during positioning of the drill machine using a hand held magnetic compas. 

 

Down hole survey readings were taken by both drill companies roughly every 

50 m as the hole progressed. Survey results were recorded by the driller on a 

paper form and given to the geologist in charge. Azimuth data recorded by the 

drillers was uncorrected for magnetic declination. 

 



 

74 

 

After completing a hole the collar location was surveyed by MGTZ personnel 

using a Sokkia Total Station surveying tool, and a concrete pad was constructed 

that surrounded a short section of 8 cm plastic pipe positioned at the top of the 

hole to preserve the azimuth and dip for future reference. Drill collar coordinates 

are provided in Appendix I. 

 

Drill core was logged at a core logging facility in the field by Oro Silver 

geologists Nadia Girard and Eric Alarie, and MGTZ geologist Ismael Hernandez 

Pescador, directly into electronic log sheets on a laptop computer using 

Coreview logging software (Version 6) developed by Visidata Proprietary Limited.  

 

13.2 Results and Discussion 

Composited assay results for Phase l drilling are presented in Table 13.2. 

True thicknesses have been estimated by either correcting for strike and dip of 

the vein with regard to bearing and inclination of the drill hole or by direct 

measurement from interpreted drill sections.

13.3 Ana Camila Showing (1 hole) 

The Ana Camila showing is located about 1 km due north of the El Compas 

Adit mine entrance, and consists of banded quartz veins up to 30 cm wide that 

outcrop intermittently in sediments along a NNW trend for a distance of 75m. The 

vein strike was NNW and dip was steep west. Five grab samples of vein material 

collected from three locales assayed between 195 ppb and 3,480 ppb Au. A sixth 

sample, from a parallel vein located 75 m to the east returned 6,840 ppb Au. 

Three drill holes were originally planned that would test the down dip projection 

of the mineralized veins; however, only one hole was completed due to access 

restrictions at the time. Drill hole 08COM035, drilled to a depth of 200.45m, cut 

mixed shale and diorite lithologies but did not intersect any veins.  

 

13.4 HOC-21 Area (7 holes) 

This prospect area is located about 270 m north of the portal of the El 

Compas Adit mine between section lines 2,516,200N and 2,516,450N, and 

centered on MHM historical drill hole HOC-21, which intercepted a quartz vein 

that assayed 9.65 g/t Au and 56 g/t Ag over 0.60m. The objectives of drilling by 

the Company in this area were to duplicate the results of HOC-21, and to expand 

upon them with step out holes to the north and south, as it was believed the 

vein(s) in this area could represent the northern strike extension of the El 

Compas Vein system north of the Adit Zone. A total of seven holes were drilled 

(07COM001-006, and 024) that targeted the vein at about 50m spaced intervals 

along strike, and 50 to 150m down dip. Due to access restrictions, six of the 

seven holes had to be drilled with west azimuths from the presumed footwall side 

of the vein, at less than ideal inclinations for intercepting the target structure. The 

results of the HOC-21 area drilling were largely negative. The host rock 

throughout the target area was a mixed package of volcanic and sedimentary 

rock. In all holes one or more quartz veins up to 0.5 m wide were intersected, but 

not at the predicted depths and none with precious metal grades comparable to 



 

78 

 

historic hole HOC-21. The best mineralized intercept was from drill hole 

07COM002, which cut 2.40 g/t Au and 0.4 g/t Ag over a 1.00 m interval of narrow 

quartz veins hosted in andesite. The correlation of vein intercepts between 

sections was difficult to establish and it is probably reasonable to conclude that 

because of the compromised drill set-ups the interpretation of the vein structures 

was made more difficult than if they had been drilled from the presumed 

hangingwall side of the veins. It is also possible that veins cut by drilling in the 

HOC-21 area are associated with NW trending structures, parallel to a NW 

striking and SW dipping fault interpreted in the model from holes drilled at the 

northern limit of the Adit Zone step-out drilling (the NW2 Fault). In conclusion 

drilling results did not confirm or expand the potential of the HOC-21 area, nor 

did they identify any large veins that could possibly be correlated with the much 

thicker veins seen to the south at the El Compas Adit Zone. 

 

13.5 El Compas Adit Zone (21 holes) 

The El Compas Vein was the principal exploration target during Oro Silver's 

Phase l drilling campaign. The Adit Zone was also the subject of wide spaced 

drilling by MHM in 2005, who completed 6 holes with shallow to intermediate 

depths that demonstrated the potential for significant precious metal 

mineralization below the limit of historical workings.  

 

A total of 21 drill holes were completed by the Company that evaluated the 

mineral potential of the El Compas Adit Zone over a strike distance of 550 m 

between section lines 2,515,650N and 2,516,200N, and down dip for as much as 

200 m below surface between 2,200 m and 2,350 m elevation. Drill hole spacing 

within and marginal to the Adit Zone ore chute, between sections 2,515,850N 

and 2,516,100N, and elevations of 2,250 m and 2,350 m, was approximately 35 

m to 50 m (with some gaps). Outside this region drilling was generally wider and 

less regularly spaced. Two representative vertical E-W geologic cross sections 



 

79 

 

through Adit Zone ore chute are shown in Figures 13.2 and 13.3, and a 

representative vertical longitudinal section through the El Compas vein showing 

drill hole pierce points (through the middle of the vein) is shown in Figure 13.4.  

 

Drill results have confirmed that the wide zone of thick quartz-calcite veining 

that characterizes the Adit Zone ore chute within the mine workings continues 

down dip beneath the limit of historical mining and also below the deepest  

Phase l drill holes. Drilling has also shown that the same veins narrow 

considerably to the north and south along strike beyond the limits of the 

underground workings.  

 

The ore chute dips moderately to steeply west and is generally comprised of 

multiple sub-parallel, most likely anastomosing quartz-calcite veins, with 

individual vein widths up to 13.1 m (not true width) in some holes. In many 

instances the widest veins occur at the hangingwall (Veta Alto) and/or footwall 

(Veta Bajo) contacts of the structure, separated by several metres of host rock 

cut by narrower veins. 

 

In general low grade precious metal mineralization up to about 1 g/t Au and 

50 g/t Ag occurs throughout most parts of the ore chute down to about 100 m 

below the deepest levels of historic mining. Deeper than that the precious metal 

grade drops off very rapidly and the veins are essentially barren where tested. 

Higher (bonanza) grade gold and silver mineralization in the 2-5 g/t Au range and 

above, and 100-200 g/t Ag range and above, tends to occur as localized pockets, 

especially in the more central portion of the ore chute.  The distribution of high 

grade gold and silver mineralization is not always coincident and in general the 

Ag:Au ratio increases with depth. Mineralization is still open at depth below 

current drilling limits in the northern portion of the ore chute. 

 



 

80 

 

Drill holes 08COM023 and 032 tested the vein potential in the footwall of the 

El Compas vein. Narrow veins up to 1.09 m wide that correlate with the Soledad 

Vein (V3) and others were intersected in both holes at their anticipated depths, 

and were weakly to moderately mineralized over widths up to 1.14 m. A 

representative vertical longitudinal section through the El Orito vein zone 

showing drill hole pierce points (through the middle of the vein) is shown in 

Figure 13.4.

13.6 El Compas Shaft Zone (1 hole) 

The El Compas shaft zone is centered about 600 m south of the El Compas 

Adit mine entrance, between about 2,515,300N and 2,5115,650N, and includes 

historical mine workings that exploited the Soledad (V3) vein for more than 100 

m wide along strike and 100 m down dip.  The Soledad vein trends parallel and is 

footwall to the El Compas vein and is hosted by felsic volcanic rocks of the La 

Virgen Formation. The shaft zone was originally considered as a priority target 

area for drilling but the idea was later downgraded in importance and then 

abandoned after reconsidering the area geology and historical drill results, which 

seemed to indicate that Soledad vein mineralization does not continue much 

deeper below historical workings. One hole was initiated (hole 08COM017) but 

was abandoned at 17 m depth after concluding that the hole was unlikely to 

provide any significant new information.  

 

13.7 Far South Area (0 holes) 

This prospect area is located some 850 m south of the El Compas Adit 

entrance and 250 m south of the El Compas shaft. Two holes were originally 

proposed to test the El Compas (V1) vein at shallow and intermediate depths at 

points where it converges with the Soledad (V3) vein. Neither of these two holes 

could be completed as the Company could not acquire the permission from the 

surface rights owner. 

 

13.8 El Orito Vein (7 holes) 

The northerly trending El Orito vein and historic workings are located about 

300 m northeast of the El Compas Adit mine entrance, and 250 m east of the 

HOC-21 zone. The objectives of drilling were to test the on-strike and down dip 

potential of the vein in the vicinity of the small shaft (depth unknown) that 

comprises the main historical workings in this area. Seven holes (08COM007, 



 

85 

 

009, 026, 029-031, and 037) were completed at about 60 m drill spacing that 

tested the El Orito vein horizontally along strike for up to 150 m to the north and 

50 m to the south of the shaft, and up to 150 m down dip.  

 

The El Orito vein structure was intersected in all holes and is comprised of 

one or more sub-parallel, most likely anastomosing quartz-calcite veins that dip 

very steeply west to nearly vertical. In most cases the widest veins occur at the 

hangingwall and footwall contacts of the structure, separated by several metres 

of host rock cut by narrow veins. 

 

Five of the seven drill holes outlined a weakly to moderately mineralized ore 

chute below the shaft, for up to 150 m on strike and 130 m down dip. The two 

other holes; one drilled into the El Orito vein about 150 m below the shaft, and 

the other about 100 m north of the shaft and 110 m below surface were 

unmineralized. Individual veins range from 0.14 m to 2.53 m wide (not true 

width), and display bladed quartz-after-calcite and local vuggy textures. Not all 

veins are mineralized but those that are, in particular those with medium to high-

grade silver mineralization, are characterized by finely disseminated to finely 

banded black (Ag) sulphide.  The ore chute identified by drilling is open partially 

at depth and to the south along strike.

13.9 Specific Gravity Determinations 

Two hundred and ninety-six (296) specific gravity determinations were made 

on pieces of half core from 19 drill holes located internal to the two resource 

areas. Representative samples of vein, and also of footwall and hanging wall 

host lithology adjacent to the veins, were selected for testing. Specific gravity 

was determined by the wet/dry method using an electronic scale. Results are 

summarized by rock type and are shown in Table 13.3 below. 

 

For each determination a single piece of half core measuring about 10 to 15 

cm in length was utilized. After first zeroing the electronic scale the sample was 

placed onto the scale's weighing pan and the weight "in air" was recorded. Next, 

the same sample was suspended beneath the scale by a short length of cord in 

such a manner that it's weight while suspended below the scale was the same as 

when resting on the weighing pan. A basin of water was then raised until the 

suspended sample was underwater and the weight of the sample "in water" 

recorded, taking care that the sample has been fully submerged. The density of 

the cord used to suspend the sample was close to the density of water such that 

any additional displacement caused by the cord in the water could be considered 

insignificant. 

 

The formula used to compute the specific gravity of the sample was by the 

wet/dry method where: 

 

Specific Gravity = Weight of core in air – Weight of core in water 

Weight of core in water

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH  
 

Sampling methodology and approach were not documented in any MHM 

reports obtained by Oro Silver. Limited information on sampling was inferred by 

Oro Silver personnel from direct inspection of core boxes and their contents, and 

from assay certificates. Based on the evidence gathered the Company believes 

that MHM core sampling took a systematic and organized approach. 

 

14.1 Minera Hochschild Drilling 

The core boxes were clearly identified with hole name, box number, and 

from-to interval. Drill hole depths were recorded on blocks inserted by the drillers 

every 3.05 m or less. Depth measurements calculated by MHM tied in well with 

the driller blocks.  

 

The start and finish of sample intervals were identified with marks on the 

inside wall of the plastic core box channel using a red marker. The corresponding 

sample identification numbers were written on the plastic channel, at the midway 

point of the sample interval, also with a red marker.  

 

Core was cut into equal halves with a diamond saw and one half was 

returned to the core box for storage while the other half was submitted for 

analysis. Sample weights listed on lab assay certificates are typically in the 1-3 

kg range, and suggest that entire half core was indeed submitted for analysis.  

 

MHM prepared and submitted for analysis a total of 926 core samples from 

20 HQ and NQ diameter holes. All holes were collared in HQ diameter core; NQ 

coring was limited to the tail portions of the deeper holes. The minimum sample 

length was 5 cm, the maximum sample length was 3.05 m, and the average 



 

90 

 

sample length was 0.77 m. There were only 4 samples under 15 cm in length 

and only 8 samples over 2.0 m in length.  

 

It is not known if MHM produced detailed geological logs of the drill holes; the 

only geologic data available was recorded in the drill database and consisted of a 

single data column identifying rock type, together with sample interval and assay 

results data.  

 

It is not known whether geotechnical logging such as core recovery or RQD 

was completed. Inspection of drill core in drill boxes, and in particular the 

mineralized intervals, suggests that low core recovery was not a significant 

concern. 

 

14.2 Oro Silver Channel Sampling 

A total of three hundred and seventy, 1 meter chip channel samples were 

systematically collected from forty-six channels spaced about 25 meters apart 

along the El Compas mine ramp and submitted for analysis. Channel sample 

assay results were not incorporated into the database utilized in the resource 

estimate; however, they were allowed to influence the classification of two drill 

holes located in the channel sampled area, which resulted in the two holes being 

upgraded from the inferred to the indicated resource category.  

 

Prior to sampling an Oro Silver geologist marked out the channels with spray 

paint on back to be sampled. Where possible the channel were oriented 

perpendicular to the trend of the vein, beginning and ending in host rock at least 

1 m either side of the vein zone hangingwall and footwall contacts. Sample 

length was normally 1 m, but in some instances samples were slightly shorter or 

longer, so that sample breaks coincided with vein zone hangingwall and footwall 

contacts. Samples were collected by 2 technicians using a hammer and chisel, 



 

91 

 

with a plastic sheet to catch sample material. Scaffolding was utilized to access 

backs when necessary. Samples were cut, described, and bagged individually. 

Samples collected each day were security-sealed and removed from the mine-

site. Sample blanks and Au standards were included in every batch of 30 

samples. All channel samples were shipped to the Inspectorate sample prep 

facility in Durango, Mexico. This program was co-managed by Rolando Mendoza 

Pina, a Mexican Geolgical Engineer with MGTZ, under the supervision of an 

OSR geologist. The collection of sample material and subsequent surveying of 

sample locations was performed by GMTZ technicians. 

 
Every effort was made to ensure the sampling was continuous within the 

interval, understanding that differences in hardness between geologic material 

could result in a sample bias. Neither Oro Silver nor GMTZ believe a sample bias 

exists in the El Compas channel sampling. 

 

14.3 Oro Silver Drilling 

Oro Silver prepared and submitted for analysis a total of 1,498 core samples 

from 20 HQ diameter holes. The minimum sample length was 3 cm, the 

maximum sample length was 3.71 m, and the average sample length was 0.99 

m. There were 4 samples under 10 cm in length and 3 samples over 2.5 m in 

length.  

 

Four Phase l drill holes were sampled in their entirety, all others were 

selectively sampled. Selective sampling was based on the prospect for an 

interval to carry gold or silver mineralization. Priority was therefore given to 

sampling geologic features such as veins, vein stockworks, fault zones, and 

altered/mineralized host rock. As an added precaution samples were normally 

taken for one metre above and one metre below the prospective interval.  

 



 

92 

 

A core process flow sheet and protocol manual was developed and 

implemented by Oro Silver for the core drilling program at El Compas. The 

relevant parts are summarized below. 

 

14.3.1 Drill Site 

Once the core interval has been drilled, it is placed directly in the core boxes 

by the driller. Every interval drilled, usually every core lift, is marked with a drill-

hole depth marker using a wooden/plastic block with non-recovered intervals also 

indicated with wooden/plastic blocks. 

 

14.3.2 Drill Site to Core Logging Facility 

The core is collected at each drill site at least twice a day and carefully 

transported, as to avoid mixing up the core or moving the drill-hole depth 

markers, to the core logging facility using a safe and appropriate vehicle.  Before 

transport, a quick check is performed to ensure the proper drill hole number is 

written on the core boxes and that from-to's are written on the core boxes make 

sense.  It might also be acceptable, under certain situations to ask the drillers to 

transport the core to the core logging facility.   

 

14.3.3 Core Logging Facility 

The core boxes are stacked by box number in the core logging facility waiting 

area. They are grouped by drill-hole so a second quick review of number of 

boxes, drill-hole number and from-to is done. The core boxes are moved, as 

required, to the core logging benches for geotechnical, geological logging and 

sampling based on priority assigned to the different drill-holes. The core is 

washed of its excessive mud except for the ore zone intervals, which should 

remain untouched. The project geologists, in concert with the logging geologists, 

are responsible to define priorities for logging. 



 

93 

 

14.3.4 Core Logging 

The logging protocol and format is provided in a Oro Silver document called 

"MOS Core Logging Manual". The logging system has a principal objective to 

ensure consistency in data recording and aid in future geological modeling. 

General procedures are summarized as follows: 

 

The order and name of the core boxes is checked again; the core must be 

placed in the boxes beginning at the upper left and ending at the lower right 

when the depth/drill-hole mark is to the left of the logger facing the core boxes, 

the core is not snaked back and forth. The core runs are checked for omission 

and/or errors. The core is lined-up within individual core boxes and between core 

boxes. The geologist does a walk-through to determine which sections need to 

be cleaned, which sections need to be geo-technically surveyed, and to 

determine major breaks of geotechnical & geological units. Prior to core logging, 

if applicable, the geologist or the technician complete the geotechnical logging of 

RQD and recovery. If geo-technical logging is done by a technician, the 

geologists can, at the same time, initiate the geological logging. The core is 

logged for lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization. Geological 

information is usually marked on the core using yellow wax markers; structural 

information can be marked on the core using a blue wax marker; measured 

depth, if applicable, can be marked with a black wax marker.  It is strongly 

recommended to note important geological characteristics (rock types, 

structures, etc.) directly on the core so the core photos can "speak" for 

themselves. After the geological logging, the geologist assigns the sample 

interval by marking the core with a red wax marker with arrows indicating the 

start and end of the sample and the sample number mark in the middle of the 

interval; a center line, based on geological characteristics, is traced for 

sampling/cutting. A sample interval is typically 1 m in length, and no shorter than 

30 cm unless it is a vein, in which case the minimum length is 15 cm. Sample 

breaks should be adjusted to accommodate important changes in geology 



 

94 

 

wherever possible. The geologist is responsible to fill the proper data in the 

sample tag books (drill-hole number, box number, from-to, etc.).  The from and to 

for all samples are also marked in red so there is no confusion between these 

and the core run blocks or other information on the core.  This allows for 

verification by the technician before/during sawing. The sample tag books are 

given to the sampler.  The sampler will verify the sample number written on the 

core and match it against one of the sample tags.  One of the small sections of 

the sample tags (there are three sections for each sample tag) is put in the 

sample bags in which the sample will be put, one is stapled to the core boxes at 

the beginning of the sampled interval while the biggest section of the sample tag 

is kept for reference. For duplicate samples, one of the small section of the tag is 

put in an empty bag, while the second small section of the tag is attached to the 

sample preceding the duplicate sample. For the blank and standard samples one 

of the small sections of the tag is attached to the bags while the other small 

section of the tag is stapled in the core boxes (sample preceding the 

standard/blank samples). Note that it is always the same side of the cut core that 

goes in the sampling bags, usually the right hand side. The geologists must 

make sure that the technician understands this step. The core boxes then 

proceed to the photo station where every box is digitally photographed twice; first 

dry and then wet. 

 

14.3.5 Sampling and Bagging 

The core sampling protocol and format is provided in a Oro Silver document 

called "MOS QA/QC and Assaying Procedures". General procedures are 

summarized as follows: 

 

Sample numbers are assigned for each interval to be sampled by the 

geologists, who will also control insertion of sample numbers for QA/QC 

samples: one standard, 1 blank, and one duplicate for every batch of 30 



 

95 

 

samples.  The QA/QC samples will be marked ahead of time in the sample book 

using the stamps provided. The "from" and "to" for each interval must be checked 

by the technicians. The sample numbers will be entered in the computer files on 

a daily basis. As an extra QA/QC procedure sample bags are prepared with the 

sample number marked on the outside of the bag. 

 

All surface core is sawed in half using the centerline identified by the core 

logging geologists. The section being bagged for assaying is always the right 

hand side of the sawed core sample. All samples to be shipped out are weighed 

and entered in the computer file. If necessary the samples are double bagged 

and the external bag is closed using a security tie-wrap. Approximately 25-30 kg 

of individual samples are put in burlap bags for shipping, the burlap bags are also 

closed using a safety tie-wrap. 

 

14.3.6 Shipping 

Once approximately 100 samples are ready for shipping a shipment form is 

completed. The forms will include information such as sample numbers, type of 

samples, and most importantly a shipment tracking number. All drill core was 

shipped to the Inspectorate sample prep facility in Durango, Mexico.

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 

No employees, officers, directors or associates of Oro Silver were involved 

with the preparation of the drill core or channel samples used in the preparation 

of this report.  
 

15.1 Sampling by Minera Hochschild  

Drill core samples were submitted to ALS Chemex in Guadalajara, Mexico 

for preparation, and then to Vancouver, Canada for ICP analysis using an Au+41 

element package. Samples were fine crushed to 70% passing a 2 mm screen. A 

1,000 gram split of the undersize fraction was pulverized to 85% passing 75 

micron mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer, from which a 30 gram split was 

obtained with a riffle splitter for analysis. Gold was analyzed by fire assay with an 

atomic absorption finish. Samples exceeding 10 g/t were re-analyzed with a 

gravimetric finish. Silver was analyzed by the ICP method, but samples 

exceeding 100 g/t were re-analysed by atomic absorption, following aqua-regia 

digestion. Mercury was analyzed by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy. 

The remaining elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic 

emission spectroscopy ("ICP-AES"). Copies of assay certificates for MHM drill 

core sample results were reported in an earlier Technical Report on the El 

Compas Property (Tarnocai, C. and Thiboutot, H. 2007), and are not repeated in 

this report. 

 

Sample blanks, duplicates, and possibly standards appear to have been 

inserted by MHM into the sample stream, perhaps as many as 2 QA/QC samples 

for every 5 core samples, based on a review of available data. There was no 

historical documentation available to verify the identity of the suspected QA/QC 

samples, so it was impossible to draw conclusions as to the quality of the 



 

97 

 

program. However, samples were analyzed by internationally recognized labs 

and are considered to be of reasonable quality.  

 

15.2 Sampling by Oro Silver 

All phase 1 diamond drill core samples were submitted to Inspectorate de 

Mexico S.A de C.V., for preparation in Durango, Mexico. All material was fine 

crushed to 70% passing a 2 mm screen, and a 500 gram split of the undersize 

fraction was pulverized to 85% passing a -150 mesh using a ring and puck 

pulverizer. Pulps for assaying were split using a riffle splitter and stored in paper 

envelopes. All pulps were sent to BSI Inspectorate Laboratories in Reno, Nevada 

for analysis, which was conducted on 2 assay ton samples. Analysis of Au was 

by fire assay, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 3 g/t Au. Analysis of 

Ag was by 3 acid digestion and atomic absorption, with a gravimetric finish on 

samples exceeding 200 g/t Ag. Pulp and reject material is retained at 

Inspectorate's storage facility in Durango.  

 

Overall, approximately 1 in every 10 samples submitted for assay during the 

drilling program was a quality control sample. In the opinion of the author, an 

acceptable number of standards, blanks and duplicates were submitted and the 

results demonstrate an acceptable level of analytical accuracy and precision.  

 

Underground channel samples collected by the Company in 2007 were 

submitted to Inspectorate de Mexico S.A de C.V., for preparation in Durango, 

Mexico. All material was fine crushed to 70% passing a 2 mm screen, and a 500 

gram split of the undersize fraction was pulverized to 85% passing a -150 mesh 

using a ring and puck pulverizer. Pulps for assaying were split using a riffle 

splitter and stored in paper envelopes. All pulps were sent to BSI Inspectorate 

Laboratories in Reno, Nevada for analysis. Analysis was conducted on 2 assay 

ton samples. Analysis of Au was by fire assay, with a gravimetric finish on 



 

98 

 

samples exceeding 3 g/t Au. Analysis of Ag was by 3 acid digestion and atomic 

absorption, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 200 g/t Ag. Pulp 

material is stored at the Oro Silver warehouse and reject material is retained at 

Inspectorate's storage facility in Durango. Copies of Assay certificates for Oro 

Silver underground channel sampling results were reported in an earlier 

Technical Report on the El Compas Property (Tarnocai, C. and Thiboutot, H. 

2007), and are therefore not included in this report. 

 

Approximately 1 in every 14 samples submitted for assay during the channel 

sample program was a quality control sample. Quality control samples included 

banks and standards, but not duplicates. 

 

The channel sample results were not incorporated into the database used to 

calculate the resource estimate. However, they were allowed to influence the 

classification of resources generated by several drill holes located in the area of 

the underground workings where the samples were collected (upgraded from 

inferred to indicated).  

 

15.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

As part of a Quality Assurance and Quality Control program Oro Silver 

included one standard, one duplicate and one blank in every suite of 30 drill core 

samples sent for analysis. Two certified standards were obtained from CDN 

Resource Laboratories Inc, from Delta, British Columbia and individually 

packaged in envelopes in 2 assay ton (60 g) quantities. The standard numbers 

and certified gold concentrations are: Standard1, CDN-6S-P7A, 0.77+/-0.06 g/t 

Au; Standard2, CDN-6S-5C, 4.74+/-0.28g/t. Sample tags for the duplicates were 

inserted into a sample bag and submitted to the laboratory, the laboratory ran the 

duplicates as per instructed on a split of the original pulp. Blank material was 



 

99 

 

created with felsic rhyolitic rock from a rock quarry located south of the El 

Compas mine. Blank material was not analyzed previously.  



 

100 

 

16.0  DATA VERIFICATION 
 

Data verification procedures of Minera Hochschild are not specified in any 

reports. 

 

16.1 Validation of Historic Data 

MHM property data made available to Oro Silver was contained in three 

printed and bound reports and in one digital CD. Relevant data included a 

summary report on drilling, a drill hole summary report, interpreted drill cross 

sections and long sections, a property geology plan with drill hole locations, level 

plans with geology and channel sample locations, and copies of assay 

certificates for drill core and channel sample results. The CD included drill and 

channel sample databases in excel. The drill database was organized by sample 

number and included the corresponding geologic, sample interval, and assay 

results data.  

 

Diamond drill core from the 20 holes drilled by MHM at El Compas was 

stored at site at the El Compas mine. Oro Silver gained full custody of the drill 

core after the option to purchase agreement with the concession owner was 

signed. 

 

16.1.1 Drill Collar Locations, Azimuths, and Dips 

Collar data for MHM drill holes was recorded in table format in a summary 

report on drilling (Anonymous, 2005). The collar UTM's were originally recorded 

in NAD27 and were converted by the Company to the WGS84 coordinate 

system. The collar locations were then checked in the field using a hand held 

GPS and found to coincide, taking into account the relative accuracy of the GPS. 

The MHM drill collars were marked in the field by a 30 cm square concrete base 



 

101 

 

surrounding a short section of plastic pipe set in the hole to preserve the azimuth 

and dip angle. In general these were still very well preserved. Only one hole, 

HOC-21, could not be located in the field. The azimuth and dip of the plastic pipe 

at each collar location was also close to recorded measurements. MHM collar 

coordinates converted to WGS 84 were utilized for early planning purposes, but 

holes were later re-surveyed by GMTZ on behalf of the Company, for 

incorporation into the resource model. Results of the Oro Silver survey compare 

very well with the original MHM survey and are therefore considered to be 

reliable.  

 

16.1.2 Digital Drill Database 

In order to validate the MHM digital drill database all data were checked 

against original data sources. Assay results were compared with scanned copies 

of the assay certificates, and sample number, sample interval and geologic code 

were compared with sample tag number, from-to, and geologic information 

gathered from direct inspection of the core boxes and their contents. During the 

validation process it was discovered that data from most of drill hole 18 was not 

in the database and had to be added manually by Oro Silver geologists. A 

number of other minor errors and inconsistencies were discovered in the MHM 

database that have also been modified in the OSR version used in the resource 

estimation. Without including the hole 18 missing data about 6% of the sample 

intervals had some type of error or omission. 

 

16.1.3 Re-logging of Historic Drill Core 

All 20 MHM drill holes were re-logged for lithology, alteration, mineralization, 

and vein content. This was done to verify and expand on the original MHM work, 

and also to make geologic terminology consistent with Oro Silver logging codes. 



 

102 

 

This work was carried out by a contract geologist provided by MGTZ and 

overseen by a geologist of the Company. 

 

16.1.4 Check Assaying of Historic Drill Core 

In order to validate the historical drilling results and thereby make them NI 

43-101 compliant, Oro Silver re-sampled approximately 10% of the 825 intervals 

originally sampled and submitted for analysis by MHM. Oro Silver selected, cut, 

and bagged 80 samples, consisting of quarter core cut from the remaining half 

core left by MHM, over intervals identical to those of the original MHM samples. 

The samples were selected randomly from 17 of 20 MHM holes and included 

both mineralized and non-mineralized intervals. The samples were submitted to 

Inspectorate Lab for analysis.  

 

The paired assays were compared with statistical plots, as presented in 

Appendix II. A summary of the results is presented in Table 16.1 below. 

 

As seen in this Table, the re-sampled gold assays compare well with the 

original assays, with differences in average grades below a ± 10% range and 

high coefficients of correlation. Although the re-sampled silver average grades 

show larger differences with the original assays, with differences on the margin of 

acceptability, their coefficients of correlation remain high. Thus, overall the 

original Hochschild drill hole data is considered acceptable for resource 

estimation.

16.1.5 Additional Sampling of Historic Drill Core 

MHM selectively sampled the biggest veins and many zones of narrow 

stockwork veining went un-sampled. A total of 1,025 additional core samples 

were cut and submitted for analysis by Oro Silver from intervals not previously 

sampled by MHM. The selected samples typically exhibited one or more of the 

following characteristics: stockwork veining, hydrothermal clay alteration, faulted 

texture, or was situated adjacent to an historical sample that was mineralized. An 

Oro Silver geologist identified and marked out the sample intervals, and a 

technician prepared samples of half core cut by a diamond saw. The additional 



 

104 

 

sampling by Oro Silver identified a number of narrow, weakly mineralized 

intervals that were missed by MHM sampling. In general; however, the Oro Silver 

results confirmed that the most significant precious metal mineralization is 

associated with quartz-calcite veins hosted within principal vein-bearing 

structures.    

 

16.2 Validation of Oro Silver Data 

16.2.1 Drill Core 

A total of 2,646 core samples of Oro Silver and MHM core, and 98 blanks, 98 

duplicates, and 98 standards (48 low grade, 50 medium grade), were submitted 

to Inspectorate Lab for analysis. On average about 1 in every 10 samples 

submitted for assay during the drilling program was a quality control sample. Oro 

Silver hired an independent laboratory consultant, Chuck Whipple, to evaluate 

the QA/QC sample results. Mr. Whipple looked at the QA/QC sample data 

graphically and statistically and detected certain discrepancies in the sample 

populations, which are described below.  

 

Analysis of the QA/QC data for the standards indicates the possibility of a 

low bias (Figures 16.1, 16.2). Both standards' means are about 5% lower than 

their certified gold concentrations, and lab results deviate about the means 50-

63% more than the recommended values.

Analysis of the QA/QC data for the blanks indicates quality was fair with a 

96% pass rate, but two failed blanks failed very badly (150 and 400 ppb Au), as 

though there were sequence errors or the blanks were carrying gold to begin with 

(Figure 16.3).  Nevertheless, Mr. Whipple concluded that sample contamination 

is probably not a significant issue.

The duplicate samples are fire assay replicates from the same pulp, so they 

can only be deemed to check fire assay precision, and not the variability of the 

sample prep process. Two graphs are provided: one shows the percent deviation 

from the mean of each duplicate pair's results (Figure 16.4), and the other shows 

how the duplicate results deviate about a 45 degree (parity) line (Figure 16.5). It 

is clear from the first graph that a significant number of data deviate significantly 

from the mean and is cause for concern.  However, it becomes evident from the 

 

106 

 



second graph that the problematic assay concentrations are generally below 20 

ppb, where analytical variability is the greatest. For this reason Mr. Whipple 

concludes that the problematic sample pairs can be ignored but adds that there 

are likely still some problems with contamination in some assays, which usually 

only shows up in low concentration results.

To address the sample bias issue Mr. Whipple's recommendation was to re-

assay 10% of the drill samples using a 1 assay tonne (AT) sample charge. Mr. 

Whipple's previous experience indicates that 2 assay tonne fire assays are often 

biased low due to additional flux requirements and additional fusion time 

required. In response to these recommendations, Oro Silver re-analyzed all 

samples above a 0.40 g/t Au cut-off, a total of 149 samples. Inspectorate Lab in 

Durango, Mexico prepared two sets of pulps (duplicate sets): one set weighed 

160 grams, the other 80 grams. The two sets of sample pulps were delivered to 

the Oro Silver office in Zacatecas for relabeling to ensure a blind test for the re-

analysis. Inspectorate picked up the pulps and shipped the heavier set to 

 

108 

 



 

109 

 

Inspectorate Reno and the lighter set to Acme Lab in Vancouver, Canada. 

Inspectorate assayed a 1 AT sample of each pulp for Au once by fire assay with 

an AAS finish. If the resulting values were less than 3 g/t, they were re-assayed 

again by the same process.  If the resulting values were greater than 3 g/t, they 

were assayed again in duplicate, by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Acme 

assayed a 1 AT sample of each pulp for Au only once by fire assay with an AAS 

finish. Overlimits greater than 3 g/t were re-assayed with a gravimetric finish.  

 

Assay results were not yet available at the time of submission of this report 

and therefore cannot be commented on at this time. 

 

16.2.2 Channel Samples 

Approximately 1 in every 14 samples submitted for assaying during the 

channel sample program was a quality control sample. Quality control samples 

included banks and standards, but not duplicates. 

 

As a validation check by an outside lab, pulp and reject material from 10%, or 

37 of the 370 channel samples analysed at Inspectorate, were submitted to 

Acme Analytical Lab in Vancouver, Canada for check analysis. Two envelopes 

containing 500 grams of sample pulp and reject material respectively, were 

prepared for each sample by Inspectorate Lab in Durango, Mexico, and shipped 

to the Oro Silver's Zacatecas office for relabeling with new sample identification 

numbers. The samples were returned to Inspectorate, who shipped them to 

Acme. Analysis was by their Group 6 Precious Metal by fire assay on a two 

assay ton sample. 

 

As a further validation check on the quality of the underground channel 

sample assays results, 56 sample intervals from 10 of the 46 original channels 

were re-sampled. Sample material was collected from channels measuring 



 

110 

 

approximately 8 cm wide by 3 cm deep, cut with a portable diamond rock saw, 

over distances as close as possible to the original sample interval. Analysis was 

by Inspectorate Lab on 2 assay ton sample charges. Results of the study show 

that sample variability is quite high for a significant number of matched sample 

pairs, especially when the interval is high-grade. However, when the averages for 

all samples within a given channel are computed, and compared, the variability 

tends to be much lower. This suggests that high grade mineralization in some 

samples is situated at or near a given sample break and that a minor shift in the 

position of the sample break during the re-sampling could result in the high-grade 

mineralization to be included in the adjacent sample interval. The results of this 

study are discussed in greater detail in Section 19.4.1 

 

16.3 Database Validation 

Mr. Jutras independently examined the entire drill hole database in terms of 

consistency of the information provided. Minor discrepancies were identified and 

corrected. The drill hole database was then considered adequate for resource 

estimation.     

 

Independent Qualified Person Robert De L'Etoile has also reviewed the Oro 

Silver database and found it to be acceptable

18.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

The following is an extract of SGS Lakefield Research's report that 

summarizes the metallurgical testwork undertaken for Oro Silver.  

 

"A laboratory test program was conducted at SGS Mineral Services 

Laboratory in Lakefield Canada, to investigate the recovery of gold and silver 

from ore samples from Oro Silver Resources Ltd.'s project in Mexico. The 

testwork consisted of preparation of eight composite samples, head analyses, 

gravity separation followed by cyanidation, whole ore flotation, and settling tests. 

 

The gold head grades varied from 2.46 g/t for the Low Grade 1 Composite to 

38.5 g/t for the High Grade 2 Composites. The silver head grades ranged from 

43.5 g/t for the Low Grade 2 Composite to 213 g/t for the High Grade 1 

Composite. The composite samples contained < 0.05% sulphide. 

 

Mineralogical study conducted on the High Grade 2 Composite (38.5 g/t Au, 

193 g/t Ag) indicated that quartz was the most abundant mineral followed by 

potassium-feldspar-montmorillonite and trace amounts of magnetite and 

hematite. Microscopic scanning of visible gold indicated that the gold particles 

ranged in size from 1 µm to 134 µm with an average size of 19 µm. Gold 

occurred as electrum and native gold was liberated, 13.5% was attached (to Fe-

oxides, Ag-S-Se, pyrite and non opaque minerals), and 21.1% was locked (in Fe-

oxides and other minerals). Based on the surface area, the liberated, attached 

and locked gold grains accounted for 77.9%, 20.9%, and 1.3%, respectively. 

 

Silver minerals in the High Grade 2 Composite occurred mainly as Ag-S-Se, 

with some native silver and Au-Ag alloy. The Ag-S-Se particles ranged in size 

from 1 to 122 µm with an average size of 30 µm, and having Ag content of 74.7% 

to 81.7%, with an average of 77.8%. By frequency, approximately 75.4% of the 



 

113 

 

Ag-S-Se occurred liberated, 9.4% was attached (to goethite limonite, gold, and 

non-opaque minerals), and 15.2% was locked (in iron-oxides and in non-opaque 

minerals). Based on the surface area, the liberated, attached and locked Ag-S-

Se grains accounted for 86.3%, 10.3%, and 3.4%, respectively. 

 

Cyanidation tests were conducted on the Mid-High Grade 1 and High Grade 

2 Composites to evaluate the effects of particle size and leach time on gold and 

silver extraction. Cyanidation leach recoveries of approximately 94.98% for Au 

and 57.58% for Ag (residue 0.5 g/t Au, 47 g/t Ag) were attained by leaching the 

Mid-High Grade 1 Composite at a K80 size of 51 µm for 144 hours. The reagent 

consumption was approximately 0.4 kg/t NaCN and 1.7 kg/t equivalent CaO. 

 

Gold and silver extractions of approximately 97.98% for Au and 71% for Ag 

were obtained by leaching the High Grade 2 Composite at a K80 size of 51 µm for 

144 hours. The reagent consumption was approximately 0.45 kg/t NaCN and 1.7 

kg/t equivalent CaO. The addition of lead nitrate (150 g/t) had very little effect on 

the cyanidation performance of both composite samples evaluated. 

 

One cyanidation test was conducted on each of the Mid-Low Grade 1 and 

Mid-High Grade 2 Composites to confirm gold and silver recovery. The K80 grind 

sizes were 71 µm for the Mid-Low Grade 1 Composite and 67 µm for the Mid-

High Grade 2 Composite. The gold and silver recoveries after 72 hours of 

leaching were approximately 92% for Au and 52% Ag (residue ~0.4 g/t Au, ~48 

g/t Ag) for the Mid-Low Grade 1 Composite, and 93% for Au and 51% for Ag 

(residue ~0.7 g/t Au and ~49 g/t Ag) for the Mid-High Grade 2 Composite. The 

cyanide consumtion was approximately 0.3 kg/t NaCN for both samples. The 

lime consumption (as equivalent CaO) was 1.1 kg/t for the Mid-Low Grade 1 

Composite, and was slightly higher at 1.3 kg/t for the Mid-High Grade 2 

Composite. 

 



 

114 

 

Treating the composite samples by gravity separation recovered 9.29% of 

the gold and 1.8% of the silver in the Mozley concentrate. The concentrate grade 

ranged from approximately 1,500 g/t Au to 52,000 g/t Au, and 2,200 g/t Ag to 

50,000 g/t Ag. 

 

Leaching the gravity tailings at a K80 size of approximately 55.60 µm for 72 

hours extracted approximately 91.96% of the Au and 50.75% of the Ag. The 

combined gravity cyanidation of gravity tailings gold and silver recoveries were 

92.97% for Au and 50.76% for Ag. 

 

The possibility of recovering gold and silver from whole ores by flotation was 

investigated on the Low Grade 1, Low Grade 2, Mid-Low Grade 1, Mid-High 

Grade 1, and High Grade 2 Composites. The first series of flotation tests was 

conducted using copper sulphate as an activator, and the recoveries were 

approximately 66.78% for Au and 32.50% for Ag. Replacing copper sulphate with 

NaSH (as a sulphidizing agent) had very little impact on the results. The 

recoveries were approximately 67.75% for Au and 25.48% for Ag. 

 

The gold losses to the flotation tailings were probably locked in non-opaque 

minerals (mainly silicates). However, no further flotation testwork was conducted 

to confirm this assumption or identify other reasons for the poor gold and silver 

recoberies. 

 

Settling testwork was conducted on pulps from cyanidation of the Mid-Low 

Grade 1 and Mid-High Grade 2 Composites. It was observed in the testwork that 

supernatant solution clarity was poor in tests using feed with pulp density above 

10% solids. Additional testing and rheology study are recommended for future 

test program." 

 

The results of the testwork are summarized in the following Table18.1

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

The current document represents the first disclosure of mineral resources on 

the El Compas property. Although surface and underground mining has taken 

place since as early as 1570, no mineral resources or mining reserves have been 

reported for this property. The estimation of the mineral resources was carried 

out by Mr. Marc Jutras and was audited by Mr. Robert De L'Etoile. Mr. Jutras is a 

vice president of evaluations with BCGold Corp. and is a qualified person as 

defined under National Instrument 43-101. Mr. De L'Etoile is a project manager 

with SGS-Geostat and an independent qualified person as defined under 

National Instrument 43-101.  

 

This mineral resource estimation exercise, which is the subject of this 

technical report, was primarily undertaken with the Vulcan® software and utilities 

internally developed in GSLIB-type format. The following sections outline the 

procedures undertaken to calculate the mineral resource. No mineral reserves 

were developed at this time. 

 

19.1 Drill Hole Data  

The drill hole database is made of a total of 57 diamond drill holes, with 20 

historical holes drilled by Minera Hochschild de Mexico in 2005 and 37 holes 

drilled by Oro Silver in 2007-2008. Out of the total number of holes available in 

the database, 48 holes were utilized for the estimation of the mineral resource in 

the area of interest: 16 Hochschild holes and 32 Oro Silver holes.  

 

19.1.1 Drill Hole Data Statistics 

The drill hole database is comprised of 57 drill holes with 3,447 assays for 

gold (Au in g/t) and silver (Ag in g/t). Other geologic information recorded 



 

117 

 

includes lithological units, minerals, oxidation states, veins and stockworks, and 

structures.  

 

The Hochschild data is comprised of 20 drill holes with 1,950 assays and the 

Oro Silver data is comprised of 37 drill holes with 1,497 assays. Drill holes were 

not consistently sampled from collar to end, instead only areas of interest were 

preferably sampled along the holes. Typically in vein zones, samples were 

selected at approximately 1.0m intervals with an additional 1 or 2 sample(s) on 

either side of the vein zone.  

 

Statistics on the drill hole database are presented in Table 19.1 and Figure 

19.1. As seen in Figure 19.1, the average drill hole depth is 196.3m, with depths 

varying from 16.8m (hole 08COM017) to 580.0m (hole HOC-18). Sample lengths 

are also observed to be 1.03m on average, with lengths varying from 0.03m to 

3.71m 

 

Gold and silver grade statistics on the original samples are presented in 

Table 19.2 at various cut-off grades. It can be seen that a rapid decrease occurs 

in the total meters of samples at elevated cut-offs. This indicates that few 

samples carry above-cut-off grades when compared to samples at no cut-off. It is 

also noted that the average grade of samples at elevated cut-offs is more than 

twice the cut-off grade, indicating the presence of higher grade samples. Thus 

from these observations it can be said that few samples of higher grade are 

representative of the gold and silver mineralization.

Gold and silver assays were also examined on a drill hole basis for various 

elevated grade cut-offs, as shown in Figure 19.2. As seen in this Figure, holes 

HOC-16, 08COM019 and 08COM028 have good gold intercepts, while holes 

HOC-02, HOC-08. HOC-16, 08COM008, 08COM013, 08COM019, 08COM022, 

08COM025, 08COM027, and 08COM028 have good silver intercepts. The 

statistics calculated in this Figure can also be useful to detect the presence of 

isolated higher grades. In such case, difficulties during grade estimation could 

occur due to a greater generation of higher grade blocks in this area. After 

inspection of the average distances away from the closest hole and the 

maximum grades reported in the Figure, it was noted that hole HOC-11 could 

potentially have an effect on the resource estimate and further attention should 

be given to surrounding estimates at the resource validation stage.

A final set of gold and silver grade statistics was calculated for each rock 

type recorded in the database as shown in Table 19.3. It can be seen that most 

of the samples are from the andesite unit with approximately 56% of the 

samples. The highest average gold and silver grades are principally associated 

with the vein unit. Other units have a much lower gold and silver average grade.

19.1.2 Location, Orientation, and Spacing of Drill Holes 

The location of the drill holes is presented in Figure 19.3 (note that north 

coordinates have been reduced by 2,000,000). As seen in this Figure, the drill 

hole density varies along the northern axis, with the hole spacing varying from 

approximately 25m in the northern area of the EC vein (2515925N) to 

approximately 80m to the south. Statistics on drill hole spacing indicate an overall 

average distance of 60.8m and median of 45.2m.  

 

With regard to the orientation of the drill holes, all Hochschild holes were 

drilled to the east at dips varying from -45° to -75°. The Oro Silver holes were in 

large drilled to the east with azimuths between 62° and 102° and dips between -

45° and -80°. These holes are located in the area of the EC and El Orito veins. 

Another set of Oro Silver holes were drilled to the west with azimuths between 

260° and 290° and dips between -45° and -65°. These holes are located in the 

area of the north-western veins. Figure 19.4, which represents the bottom half of 

a sphere, displays the various azimuth and dip angles of the Hochschild and Oro 

Silver drill holes. 

 

A list of the drill hole collars is provided in Appendix I.

19.2 Geologic Modeling 

The 3-D modeling of the structural features, main lithologies, vein units, and 

underground workings was completed for the area of interest. No mineralization 

model per say was specifically developed, as the mineralization is mainly 

contained within the veins. The steps involved in the modeling process included 

the interpretation of the geologic features on 25-meter spaced east-west sections 

with verification on level plans. These shapes were then digitized and imported 

into Vulcan® for 3-D modeling. The polygons were then snapped to the drill holes 

and then linked together. 

 

19.2.1 Structures 

The structural faults were the first geologic feature to be modeled. There are 

three major faults on the property: the main fault, the northwest fault, and the 

FEV fault. The interpretation of the faults was derived from field observations and 

measurements from drill hole data. These structures are post-mineral and have 

displaced lithologies and mineralization. The modeled faults are displayed in 

Figure 19.5. 

 

19.2.2 Lithologies 

The different lithologies recorded in the database were regrouped under four 

main units for modeling purposes. These units are: andesite, rhyolite, 

pyroclastics and sediments. The andesite is the largest unit (111,017,690 m3) 

followed by the sediments (53,828,242 m3), the pyroclastics (37,050,405 m3), 

and the rhyolite unit (16,215,945 m3). Fault displacements of the lithological units 

were integrated in the model. The lithological model was developed as a geologic 

reference and was not utilized in the estimation of the mineral resource. The 

modeled lithological units are presented in Figure 19.6.

19.2.3 Veins 

Several veins identified on the property were modeled into individual solids. It 

is noted that practically all of the gold and silver mineralization is contained within 

these vein units. A special attention was directed to the vein contacts along each 

drill hole to ensure that the interpreted vein intercepts were properly represented 

in Vulcan®. A total of eight different sets of veins were modeled as seen in Figure 

19.7. As with the lithology model, the displacements due to faulting were 

integrated in the vein model. The volume of each vein set is presented in Table 

19.4. As seen in this Table, the EC vein is the largest unit on the property 

followed by the recently discovered El Orito 1 vein. The true thickness measured 

from the intersecting drill hole data is shown in Table 19.5, with the EC and El 

Orito 1 veins also being the thickest veins. 

 

The veins' geographical configuration can be described as being in three 

groups: the EC, 2, 3, and Other 1 and 2 veins located in the central and southern 

portion of the property, the El Orito 1 and 2 veins located in the north-east, and 

the north-west veins located in the northern portion. In general the veins are 

oriented along a north-south direction. The EC vein and parallel veins 2, 3 and 

Other 1 and 2, as well as the north-west veins are dipping to the west at 

approximately 65°, while the El Orito 1 and 2 are more steeply dipping to the 

west at an approximate angle of 80°. A geographical depiction of the veins with 

the topographic surface and the drill holes is presented in Figure 19.8. 

 

The veins are the main control on gold and silver mineralization and for such 

no additional modeling was believed necessary to adequately capture this 

component.

19.2.4 Underground Workings 

The underground workings from recent mining activities were modeled for 

seven different levels, as seen in Figure 19.9. The distance between levels varies 

between 7 and 10m in elevation. Although historical mining took place above 

level 1, no information was available for the older mining voids in this area and 

thus no void models were generated in this region.

19.3 Compositing 

The gold and silver assays from the original sample lengths were composited 

to regular 1.0m intervals for each hole, as most of the original samples were 

assayed on 1.0m lengths. This ensures that the intrinsic grade variability is 

preserved prior to the block grade interpolation. The compositing process 

considered only samples within the vein units, and consisted in starting the 

compositing at the edge of the vein with continuous 1.0m composite intervals up 

to the other edge of the vein. Upon a visual review of the composites and the 

vein model it was observed that no samples were taken for hole 08COM012 

where the upper portion of the EC vein is intersected. For such two 1.0m 

samples of 0.0 g/t gold and silver grades were added to the composite database. 

Thus a total of 535 composites were generated overall, with 353 composites from 

32 Oro Silver holes (65.9%), and 182 composites from 16 Hochschild holes 

(34.1%), as seen in Table 19.5. Non-sampled intervals within veins were 

replaced by gold and silver values of 0.0 g/t, as they were believed to be barren. 

 

 From the compositing procedure, it was observed that the last composite of 

each hole is 1.0m or less. There were 62 composites with lengths lesser than 

1.0m or 11.6% of the composited data. To examine the influence of the lesser 

than 1.0m composites, the average gold and silver grades were computed for 

each group of composites with lengths in increments of 0.1m (from 0.1m to 

0.9m). It was observed that no bias was present, with average gold and silver 

grades for some lengths greater than the average grades of the 1.0m composites 

and for other lengths lesser than the average grades of the 1.0m composites. A 

small difference (0.8%) in average gold grades was observed, with the average 

gold grade of the 1.0m composites equal to 1.27 g/t and 1.26 g/t for all of the 

composites. Similar results were observed for the average silver grades, with an 

average grade of 26.06 g/t for the 1.0m composites and 26.69 g/t for all 

composites – a difference of 2.3%. From these results it was decided to keep all 



 

136 

 

lesser than 1.0m composites in the composite database to be used for grade 

estimation.

19.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

A set of various statistical applications was utilized to provide a better 

understanding of the gold and silver grade populations.  

 

19.4.1 Underground Channel Sample Comparison 

A set of 370 underground channel samples was previously taken in the area 

of the recent underground workings. A validation of this data was undertaken to 

examine their potential use for the resource's estimation. Approximately 15% of 

these channels were re-sampled by Oro Silver and comparative tests were 

carried out for the matching pairs. Results of these statistical tests showed that 

the Oro Silver's re-sampled gold and silver assays were consistently higher than 

those of the original channel samples. Thus, based on the presence of this 

observed bias, it was decided not to use the underground channel samples for 

the current estimation of the mineral resource. Comparative plots are presented 

in Appendix III.  

 

 

 



19.4.2 Grade and Accumulation Contours for Gold and Silver 

With the objective of better understanding the gold and silver distributions at 

El Compas, a first step looked at the grade and accumulation contours along a 

longitudinal section for each vein. In this manner, the drill hole intercepts within 

the vein units were re-composited to one intercept per vein per drill hole with a 

length weighted average of gold and silver grades for each of those intercepts. 

The re-composited grade was also multiplied by the thickness to generate gold 

and silver accumulation values. The longitudinal sections were then visually 

examined for each vein. The EC vein presented the most interesting features, as 

the other vein units contained few intercepts. As seen in Figure 19.10 (a) to (e), 

the gold and silver distribution of grade and accumulation for the EC vein show a 

higher grade/accumulation shoot towards the northern portion of the vein.

19.4.3 Contours of Ag/Au Ratio 

Ratios of silver over gold grades were calculated for the drill hole intercepts 

composited to their in-vein length. Contours of those ratios were then generated 

as seen in Figure 19.11 for the EC vein. Results show the presence of a trend at 

depth in the northern portion of the EC vein, with an increase of the Ag/Au ratio 

at greater depths. This would corroborate the observations previously made in 

Figures 19.10 (b) and (d) where higher gold grades are found in the upper 

northern portion of the EC vein, and higher silver grades are found at depth.

19.4.4 Gold and Silver Grade Profiles Across Veins 

Gold and silver grade profiles across each vein were generated to examine 

possible grade enrichment along the footwall and hanging wall of the veins. In 

this regard, drill hole grades were averaged according to proportional increments 

of 20% across the vein intercept (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%). Results were 

reported on scatterplots as seen in Figure 19.12 (a) and (b). From these Figures 

it is observed that in general there is gold grade enrichment on one of the veins' 

contacts, and silver grade enrichment on both contacts. This will be an important 

feature to consider in the selection of the estimation parameters and validation of 

the grade block model.

19.4.5 Bivariate Statistics 

A scatterplot was generated to examine the possible relationship of gold with 

silver. As seen in Figure 19.13 there is a relatively low correlation coefficient for 

the paired data with a value of 0.57. The graph also shows areas of high gold 

grades with lower silver grades and vice-versa, corresponding to the 

observations previously made from the grade and ratio contours.

142 

 



 

143 

 

19.4.6 Univariate Statistics 

Basic statistics were performed on the gold and silver grades of the 1.0m 

composites within the vein units. From the histograms and probability plots of 

Figures 19.14 and 19.15, it can be seen that the gold and silver grade 

distributions resemble positively skewed lognormal populations within the veins. 

The silver population is well behaved with a low coefficient of variation (CV = 

2.13), while the gold population displays more heterogeneity with a higher 

coefficient of variation (CV = 3.89). A CV greater than 3.0 for gold would be in 

general considered as high and would indicate a less homogeneous distribution. 

The higher CV observed for the gold population could be influenced by higher 

grade outliers and thus further examination of these grades is warranted. 

 

It is also observed from Figure 19.14 that there are few higher grade gold 

values, with approximately 20% of the data above 1.0 g/t Au, 14% above 2.0 g/t 

Au, and 10% above 3.0 g/t Au. A similar observation is made for the silver grades 

of Figure 19.15, with approximately 15% of the data above 50 g/t Ag, and 6% 

above 100 g/t Ag.

19.4.7 Capping of High-Grade Outliers 

It is common practice to statistically examine the higher grades within a 

population and to trim them to a lower grade value based on the results from 

specific statistical utilities. This procedure is performed on high grade values that 

are considered outliers and that cannot be related to any geologic feature. In the 

case at El Compas, the gold and silver higher grades were examined with four 

different tools: the probability plot, decile analysis, cutting statistics, and percent 

metal graph (from Mr. De L'Etoile).  The usage of various investigating methods 

allows for a selection of the capping threshold in a more objective and justified 

manner. For the probability plot method, the capping value is chosen at the 

location where higher grades depart from the main distribution. For the decile 

analysis, the capping value is chosen as the maximum grade of the decile 

containing less than an average of 10% of metal. For the cutting statistics, the 

selection of the capping value is identified at the cut-off grade where there is no 

correlation between the grades above this cut-off. And for the percent metal 

graph, the capping value is selected as the grade where 1% of the data contains 

less than 10% of the metal. From the compilation of the results from these 

different techniques, capping thresholds of 25.0 g/t for gold and 300.0 g/t for 

silver were selected. The capping process only involved gold and silver grades 

from the EC vein population. A total of 7 gold grades and 7 silver grades were 

capped, removing 20% of the gold metal content and 4% of the silver metal 

content. The high metal content removed from the gold distribution came from 

few outliers carrying a large portion of the metal content, which made the gold 

metal content very sensitive to the capping value selected. Plots from the 

statistical utilities used in the capping process are presented in Appendix IV. 

 

Basic statistics were re-computed with the gold and silver capped grades as 

presented in Table 19.6. As seen in this Table, the coefficients of variation for 

gold and silver are low (below 3.00) and show better grade homogeneity, 



 

147 

 

indicating that there is no need to treat the higher grade composites differently 

than the lower grade composites during the estimation process.

19.4.8 Declustering 

In general there is a tendency to drill more holes in higher grade areas than 

in lower grade areas when delimiting an orebody. As a result, the higher grade 

portion of a deposit will be overly represented and would translate into a bias 

towards the higher grades when calculating statistical parameters of the 

population. Thus, a declustering method is utilized to generate a more 

representative set of statistical results within the zone of interest. In this case, a 

polygonal declustering technique was applied to the composites of the vein units. 

This approach consists of assigning the volume of a polygon, defined by the 

halfway distance between a sample and its surrounding neighbors, as a weight 

for each sample within the vein units.  

 



 

148 

 

Therefore a sample that is isolated will have a larger weight than a sample 

located in a densely sampled area. Statistical results from the declustering 

exercise are presented in Table 19.7 for composites within the vein units. The 

average grade from the declustered statistics provides an excellent comparison 

with the average grade of the interpolated blocks, as a way to assess any overall 

bias of the estimates.     

 

 As seen in Table 19.7, the average declustered gold grade increased (by 

16.7%), indicating that higher gold grade areas have a lesser density of samples 

than the lower gold grade areas. Conversely, the average declustered silver 

grade decreased (by 13.2%), indicating that higher silver grade areas have a 

greater density of samples than the lower silver grade areas.

19.5     Variography 

A variographic analysis was carried out on the gold and silver composites 

within the vein units. The objective of this analysis was to spatially establish the 

preferred directions of gold and silver grade continuity. In turn the variograms 

modeled along those directions would be later utilized to select and weigh the 

composites during the block grade interpolation process. For this exercise, all 

experimental variograms were of the type relative lag pairwise, which is 

considered robust for the assessment of grade continuity. The variogram 

analysis was solely undertaken within the EC vein unit, due to the small amount 

of data available in the other veins.  

 

Variogram maps were first calculated to examine general gold and silver 

grade continuities in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes. For gold, the variogram map 

indicated a preferred direction of grade continuity along the north-south 

orientation. For silver, similar observations were made, however not as 

conclusive, with a north-south preferred direction of continuity. In general, the 

relatively small amount of data available for the EC vein did not allow for very 

clear results. 

 

The next step undertaken was to compute omni-directional variograms and 

down-hole variograms. The omni-directional variograms are calculated without 

any directional restrictions and provide a good assessment of the sill of the 

variogram. As for the down-hole variogram, it is calculated with the composites of 

each hole along the trace of the hole. The objective of these calculations is to 

provide information about the short scale structure of the variogram, as the 

composites are more closely spaced down the hole. Thus the modeling of the 

nugget effect is usually better derived from the down-hole variograms. 

 

Directional variograms were then computed to identify more specifically the 

three main directions of continuity. A first set of variograms were produced in the 



 

150 

 

horizontal plane at increments of 10 degrees. For gold, it was observed that 

better continuities were found at an azimuth of 0°, and at an azimuth of 5° for 

silver. In the same way a second set of variograms were computed at 10° 

increments in the vertical plane of the horizontal direction of continuity (plunge 

direction). In this case a 0° plunge was found for both areas. A final set of 

variograms at 10° increments were calculated in the vertical plane perpendicular 

to the horizontal direction of continuity (dip direction). For gold, a dip direction of -

65° to the west was determined as the preferred direction in that plane, and a dip 

direction of -60° to the west was determined for silver. The final variograms were 

then modeled with a 2-structure spherical variogram and resulting parameters 

presented in Table 19.8. The structure parameters were normalized to a sill of 

1.0 for gold and silver. The final set of variogram models is shown in Figures 

19.16 and 19.17. 

 

The directions of gold and silver grade continuity are in general agreement 

with the orientation of the EC vein. It should be noted the shape of the vein has a 

strong influence on those directions of continuity. The ranges of continuity along 

those directions also reflect the geometric dimension ratios of the EC vein.  

 

In general the modeled variograms have low nugget effects and better 

continuities along strike. These variograms are also very similar for gold and 

silver with comparable parameters. They are however not as well-defined as one 

would like, especially for the shorter scale portion of the variograms.

19.6 Gold and Silver Grade Estimation 

 The estimation of gold and silver grades into a block model was carried out 

with the ordinary kriging technique. The estimation strategy and parameters were 

tailored to account for the various geometrical, geological, and geostatistical 

characteristics previously identified. For such, only the modeled veins would be 

populated with grade estimates. The ondulated shape of the veins along strike 

and down dip would be incorporated in the estimation through the usage of an 

anisotropy model. The veins' dimensions and grade continuity were reflected in 

the selection of the search ellipsoid's orientation and shape. The database of 

1.0m capped gold and silver composites was utilized as input for the interpolation 

process. Grade estimates were independently generated for gold and silver.  

 

The grid definition of each block model is presented in Table 19.9. It should 

be noted that the exterior side of the end blocks are specified in this Table. A 

block size of 1m (easting) x 5m (northing) x 1m (elevation) was selected mainly 

to better model the narrowness (in the east-west direction) and the western dip 

(in the vertical and east-west directions) of the veins.

Based on the similarity of the modeled variograms for gold and silver, the 

data searching parameters for the estimation of silver were made the same as 

the ones selected for gold. This was to ensure that every estimated block would 

have a gold and silver grade estimate and to avoid having gold estimates without 

silver estimates and vice versa. Thus the size and orientation of the search 

ellipsoid of the estimation process was based on the variogram parameters 

modeled for gold. No other restrictions, such as a minimum number of informed 

octants, a minimum number of holes, a maximum number of samples per hole, 

etc., were applied to the estimation process at this preliminary stage due to the 

relatively small quantity of available data. For the same reason, the estimation 

parameters of the EC vein were used for the other less populated vein units. A 

hard boundary was utilized between each vein. As an example, only composites 

located within the EC vein were utilized in the grade estimation of blocks in the 

EC vein. Further details of the estimation parameters are presented in Table 

19.10.

 Anisotropy Model 

  

Based on the ondulations of the veins seen along strike and down dip, it was 

decided to use an anisotropy model to better reflect these features in the 

estimation of gold and silver grades. An anisotropy model consists of a block 

model of angle values for a particular orientation. In this case, angles in different 

locations were measured along the strike and dip directions of the modeled EC 

vein. A block model for each of these directions was generated with the inverse 

distance cubed (id3) technique to allow for a smooth transition from one angle to 

another. These direction values are then used during grade interpolation to orient 

the search ellipsoid accordingly. Gold grade estimation results with and without 

the usage of the anisotropy model are presented in Figure 19.18.

Model – Level 2350 El. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

156 

 



 

157 

 

As seen in the example of Figure 19.18, the estimation of grade without the 

anisotropy model uses the same orientation along strike which projects grades 

across the width of the vein in ondulated areas. The usage of the anisotropy 

model produces a more realistic configuration by keeping the estimated grades 

along the footwall and hanging wall of the vein.  

 

19.7 Validation of Grade Estimates 

Validation tests were carried out on the estimates to examine the possible 

presence of a bias and to quantify the level of smoothing/variability. 

  

19.7.1 Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of the block estimates with the drill hole grades on plans, 

east-west and north-south cross-sections was performed as a first check of the 

estimates. Observations from stepping through the estimates along the different 

planes indicated that there was overall a good agreement between the drill hole 

grades and the estimates. The orientations of the estimated grades were also 

according to the projection angles defined by the search ellipsoid and the 

anisotropy model. Examples for sections 74100E and 2515950N, and level 

2325El, are presented for gold in Figures 19.19, 19.20, and 19.21, and for silver 

in Figures 19.22, 19.23, and 19.24. It can be seen on these Figures that the 

usage of the anisotropy model has provided a realistic representation of the 

grade distribution within the EC vein.

19.7.2 Global Bias Test 

The comparison of the average gold and silver grades from the declustered 

composites and the estimated block grades examines the possibility of a global 

bias of the estimates. As a guideline, a difference between the average gold and 

silver grades of more than ± 10% would indicate a significant over- or under-

estimation of the block grades and the possible presence of a bias. It would be a 

sign of difficulties encountered in the estimation process and would require 

further investigation. 

 

Results of this average gold and silver grade comparison are presented in 

Table 19.11.

As seen in Table 19.11, the average gold grades between the declustered 

composites and the block estimates are similar and within the tolerance levels of 

acceptability. Similarly, the difference between the average silver grades from the 

declustered composites and the block estimates is also within the limits of 

acceptability. It is thus believed that no global bias is present in the gold and 

silver estimates. 

 



 

165 

 

19.7.3 Grade Profile Reproducibility 

The comparison of the grade profiles of the declustered composites with that 

of the estimates allows for a visual verification of an over- or under-estimation of 

the block estimates at the global and local scales. A qualitative assessment of 

the smoothing/variability of the estimates can also be observed from the plots. 

The output consists of three upper graphs displaying the average grade 

according to each of the coordinate axes (east, north, elevation). The ideal result 

is a grade profile from the estimates that follows that of the declustered 

composites along the three coordinate axes, in a way that the estimates have 

lower high-grade peaks than the composites, and higher low-grade peaks than 

the composites. A smoother grade profile for the estimates, from low to high 

grade areas, is also anticipated in order to reflect that these grades represent 

larger volumes than the composites. The lower three graphs represent the 

number of composites and estimates along each coordinate axis. 

 

Grade profiles are presented in Figures 19.25 and 19.26 for gold and silver 

respectively.

gold. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

166 

 

 



Figure 19.26. Grade profiles of declustered composites and block estimates for 

silver. 

 

 

 

From the plots of Figures 19.25 and 19.26, it can be seen that the grade 

profiles of the declustered composites are well reproduced by those of the block 

estimates and consequently that no global or local bias is observed. As 

anticipated, some smoothing of the block estimates can be seen in the profiles, 

 

167 

 



 

168 

 

where estimated grades are higher in lower grade areas and lower in higher 

grade areas. To assess the level of smoothing of the estimates, further 

investigation is required (section 19.7.5, Level of Smoothing/Variability). 

 

19.7.4 Naïve Cross-Validation Test 

A comparison of the grade from composites within a block with the estimated 

grade of that block provides an assessment of the estimation process close to 

measured data. Pairing of these grades on a scatterplot gives a statistical 

valuation of the estimates. It is anticipated that the estimated block grades should 

be similar to the composited grades within the block, however without being of 

exactly the same value. Thus a high correlation coefficient will indicate 

satisfactory results in the interpolation process, while a medium to low correlation 

coefficient will be indicative of larger differences in the estimates and would 

suggest a further review of the interpolation process. Results from the pairing of 

the composited and estimated grades within blocks pierced by a drill hole are 

presented in Table 19.12 for gold and silver.

As seen in Table 19.12 for both gold and silver, the block grade estimates

coefficients, indicating satisfactory results from the estimation process. A total of 

406 estimated blocks were pierced by drill holes.  

19.7.5 Level of Smoothing/Variability 

The level of smoothing/variability of the estimates can be measured by 

comparing a theoretical distribution of block grades with that of the actual 

estimates. The theoretical distribution of block grades is derived from that of the 

1m declustered composites, where a change of support algorithm is utilized for 

the transformation (Indirect Lognormal Correction). In this case, the variance of 

the composites' grade population is corrected (reduced) with the help of the 

variogram model, to reflect a distribution of block grades (1m x 5m x 1m). The 

comparison of the coefficient of variation (CV) of this population with that of the 

actual block estimates provides a measure of smoothing. Ideally a lower CV from 

the estimates of 5 to 10% is targeted as a proper amount of smoothing. This 

smoothing of the estimates is desired as it allows for the following factors: the 

imperfect selection of ore blocks at the mining stage (misclassification), the block 

grades relate to much larger volumes than the volume of core (support effect), 

and the block grades are not perfectly known (information effect). A CV  lower 

than 5 to 10% for the estimates would indicate a larger amount of smoothing, 

while a higher CV would represent a larger amount of variability. Too much 

smoothing would be characterized by grade estimates around the average grade, 

where too much variability would be represented by estimates with abrupt 

changes between lower and higher grade areas.   

 

Results of the level of smoothing/variability analysis are presented in Table 

19.13 for gold and silver. As observed in this Table, the CVs of the estimates for 

both gold and silver are lower than the target difference range of -5 to -10%, 

indicating a higher level of smoothing of the estimates. This result could be 

explained by the fact that the estimation was made with relatively small blocks 



 

170 

 

(1mx5mx1m) when compared to the data spacing (~50m). In this case a number 

of blocks could have the same or similar grades in proximity of data.

19.7.6 Kriging Efficiency and Kriging Slope Regression 

The kriging efficiency and kriging slope regression are statistical measures of 

the conditional bias of the estimates; the difference between the true block grade 

and the estimated block grade. A guideline for the kriging efficiency (KE) at an 

exploration stage, is to have the estimates with an average KE value greater or 

equal to 0.50. KE values usually vary between 0 and 1, 1 being a perfect 

estimate. For the kriging slope regression (KSR), a guideline for an exploration 

project is to have an average KSR value greater or equal to 0.60. Similarly to the 

kriging efficiency, KSR values usually vary between 0 and 1, 1 being a perfect 

estimate.  

 

Results of the KE and KSR analyses are shown in Table 19.14. 

 

Results in Table 19.14 show that the block grade estimates for both gold and 

silver have low KE and KSR values with few estimates above the thresholds of 

acceptability. These results, indicative of the presence of a conditional bias, 

could be explained by the fact that small blocks were used along with relatively 

few data for the grade estimation.

19.8 Resource Classification 

The mineral resource was classified as indicated and inferred. The indicated 

portion was assigned to the northern area of the EC vein where a greater density 

of drilling is found. All other areas were defined as inferred resources. 

 

The region of the indicated resource was determined with the help of the 

variogram parameters. In fact, an ellipse with half the dimensions of the second 

range of the variogram along strike and dip directions was drawn around each of 

the drill hole piercing points on a longitudinal section of the EC vein. The 

contiguous area formed in the region of greater drill hole density (northern part of 

the EC vein) was defined as being of higher confidence, with a drill hole spacing 

of approximately 30.0m. An adjoining area around hole 08COM019 was added to 

the indicated perimeter based on the fact that channel samples are present in the 

vicinity. The region of indicated resources is shown in Figure 19.27.

19.9 Mineral Resource Calculation 

The mineral resource was calculated for 1m (X) x 5m (Y) x 1m (Z) blocks 

with a constant specific gravity (SG) value of 2.55. This SG value is based on 

119 specific gravity measurements taken in vein material during Oro Silver's 

recent drilling campaign. The average of these SG data is 2.55 with values 

ranging from 2.227 to 2.680. Each block in the model has a tonnage of 12.75 

tonnes.  

 

Some editing to the volume covered by the resource model was performed in 

the near-surface area of the EC vein. The material located above the more 

 

172 

 



 

173 

 

recent underground workings has seen some historical mining. The voids left by 

this activity are not well documented and are not surveyed. For these reasons it 

was decided to remove all of the estimated resources in the area located from 

2m above the first underground level (2387.0m El) up to surface.  

 

The resource model was also edited to the mined out underground voids 

from recent mining activities. These voids consisting of galleries and stopes on 

seven levels, were digitized from sections and plans and rendered as 3-D 

shapes. Thus all blocks in the model located within these underground voids 

were removed in the calculation of the remaining mineral resources. 

 

From a visual check of the estimates it was observed that two areas in the 

block model needed additional editing. First, the above cut-off grade estimates 

generated in the vicinity of hole 08COM023 are located within vein 3 in a very 

narrow portion of the vein. Based on the fact that the area is less than 1.0m wide 

horizontally and thus less than a minimum mining width of 1.5m, it was decide to 

remove those estimates. Second, a high grade intercept in hole HOC-11 

generated a number of high grade estimates further away from the hole. Thus it 

was decided that only estimates within 25.0m from this hole should be kept. 

 

The mineral resource is expressed in terms of gold equivalency as gold is the 

element carrying more value than silver in this case. A gold equivalency factor of 

83.7 was used for the silver grades. This factor is based on gold and silver metal 

prices calculated from a combination of a 36 month trailing average of the metal 

price (60%) and a 24 month average of futures metal price (40%).  The metal 

prices used in the calculation of the gold equivalency factor are $752.30 USD for 

gold and $13.38 USD for silver.  The factor also incorporates gold and silver 

metal recoveries of 94.5% and 63.5% respectively (metallurgical testing done by 

Oro Silver Resources in 2008).

The remaining indicated and inferred mineral resource's tonnage and grade 

are presented in Tables 19.15 and 19.16, respectively, at various gold equivalent 

grade cut-offs. A grade-tonnage curve of the resource is presented in Figure

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION 
 

21.1 Exploration 

Veins at El Compas show characteristics typical of low sulphidation state 

epithermal systems. Mining of planar quartz veins at El Compas has occurred 

along discrete, steeply plunging zones. One of these zones was recently 

exploited by a ramp-in-ore, and another occurs at the inactive El Compas shaft. 

These lenticular zones within the veins represent ore chutes. The chutes appear 

to occur within the northerly trending veins, near their intersection with northwest 

trending faults and fault-veins. Fault-vein intersection zones are mapped on 

surface as areas of curvilinear quartz veins and veinlets, faults, and fault-related 

cleavage arrays. Veins at El Orito show characteristics similar to those at El 

Compas, although evidence of northwest trending veins were is not indicated. A 

Phase l diamond core drilling program consisting of 5,400m in 37 HQ diameter 

holes evaluated the along strike and down dip extent of the El Compas Adit Zone 

ore chute, and the El Orito vein in the vicinity of historical workings, in addition to 

several other target zones along the El Compas vein. At the Adit Zone drilling 

has delineated a steeply north plunging ore chute approximately 250m wide by 

up to 200m down dip from surface that is still partially open at depth. AT El Orito 

significant mineralization has outlined a probable ore chute that measures 130m 

wide by at least 110m down dip from surface that is open to the south and partly 

at depth. Ore chutes in both areas are comprised of multiple sub-parallel, most 

likely anastamosing quartz-calcite veins with individual vein widths up to 12m 

(less at El Orito). Distribution of economic grade precious metal mineralization 

within the ore chutes is difficult to predict but typically occurs in veins at the 

footwall or hangingwall contacts. 

 

 

 



 

180 

 

21.2 Mineral Resource 

The El Compas property, which had past production, has been sampled with 

over 11,000m of drilling since 2005. Due to the relatively simple configuration of 

the veins containing mineralization, the current amount of available data is 

considered sufficient to undertake the estimation of a mineral resource. One of 

the key objectives of the latest Oro Silver drilling campaign was to confirm 

mineralization at depth as well as to confirm and expand mineralized areas 

previously identified by the Hochschild drilling. The re-sampling of approximately 

10% of Hochschild's drill hole data by Oro Silver has demonstrated that the 

historic data were adequate to be used for mineral resource estimation. 

 

  The statistical analysis of mineralization within the veins revealed that better 

gold grades are mainly located in the northern upper portion of the EC vein with 

better silver grades located in the northern lower portion of the EC vein. The ratio 

of silver to gold indicates a trend increasing at depth in that area. It was also 

observed that few samples are representative of the higher grade portion of the 

mineralization. 

 

The mineralization at El Compas is mainly found within the vein units, where 

gold mineralization has a tendency to have better grades on the footwall contact 

and silver mineralization has a tendency to have better grades on both the 

footwall and hanging wall contacts. The relatively narrow shape of the veins also 

tends to control the main directions of continuity, as observed in the variographic 

analysis.  

 

The EC and El Orito1 veins contain most of the mineralization at an elevated 

cut-off. Potential for additional mineral resources exist at depth in the northern 

section of the EC vein and to the south of the El Orito 1 vein.  

  



 

181 

 

Some of the validation tests were carried out to verify the conditional bias 

and the smoothing level of the estimated resource. In order to reduce the 

conditional bias, larger blocks are needed and a great quantity of samples is 

required during estimation. In return this will cause a large degree of smoothing 

in the estimates and would not be an adequate representation of the recoverable 

resources. Thus smaller block sizes, indicative of a possible SMU (Selective 

Mining Unit) size, combined with a lower degree of smoothing is the preferred 

approach, as chosen in this study, in providing a more realistic representation of 

the recoverable mineral resources.  

In the current estimation approach preference was given to the discretization 

of the veins' shape, the configuration of the grade's distribution within the veins, 

without any global or local bias. The higher level of smoothing can be viewed as 

conservatism built-in the gold and silver grade estimates. It is believed that 

additional drill hole data would tend to reduce the smoothing level currently 

observed. 

 

The estimation strategy utilized in the generation of the mineral resource 

estimate is a simple approach that follows standard industry practice. The 

validation of the estimates has shown that the resource is unbiased and is 

therefore considered to be a fair representation of the in-situ mineral resource of 

the areas of interest at El Compas. The utilization of a variable search strategy 

(anisotropy model) for the grade interpolation process has proven to be beneficial 

in providing a more realistic outcome.

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Recommendations are listed in order of priority but are subject to change. 

 

22.1 Exploration 

A preliminary economic analysis should be undertaken to determine whether 

the current resource model, taken as a base case, meets the minimum 

requirements for development into a profitable mine operation.    

 

Additional drilling is recommended for the El Compas and El Orito resource 

areas. At El Compas Phase ll drilling should target the down dip extension of the 

Adit Zone in the central and northern portions of the ore chute below the limit of 

current drilling, where high-grade mineralization was intersected and is still open 

at depth. At El Orito step-out drilling is recommended in order to test the strike 

extension of mineralized veins to the south of current drilling and expand 

resource potential in this direction. Infill drilling at both locations should also be 

considered in order to upgrade more of the current resource estimate from the 

inferred to the indicated category. Finally, if potential for enhanced ore chute 

development is postulated at the intersection of north and northwest trending 

structures then additional drilling should be factored into any proposed drill 

program. A minimum 12 hole, 2,000 m diamond drill program is proposed in 

order to complete the proposed work.  

 

Oro Silver has consolidated its land position in the El Orito district and now 

has mineral title to essentially all lands covering the principal structures and 

historical workings. A detailed compilation of historical data is currently 

underway. The results of the compilation should be utilized to define and 

prioritize target areas for follow up in the field. A phased district-wide exploration 

program that includes geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and up to 



 

183 

 

1,500 metres of diamond drilling to confirm historical drilling results and test new 

targets identified during the field study is recommended.  

 

An option-to-purchase or long term rental agreement should be negotiated as 

soon as possible with the owner of the surface rights to the lands covering the El 

Compas and El Orito mineral resources and access ways, along with sufficient 

space for envisioned mine infrastructure. At present no such agreement exists.  

 

Regional studies indicate there are a number of pathfinder elements 

associated with precious metal mineralization in the El Orito and surrounding 

mining districts. A trace element study of El Compas drill core should therefore 

be considered, as the results could help to identify structural elements and/or 

mineralogical associations that are associated with precious metal mineralization, 

which could to help to guide future exploration work, and. If successful at El 

Compas this information could then be utilized as a tool to define new search 

criteria in the other parts of the district.  

 

A topographic survey should to be completed over the El Orito resource 

area. Although topographic expression in this area is relatively subdued the only 

surface elevation data currently available comes from government maps which 

are known to be very imprecise. 

 

22.2 Cost Estimates 

Based on the recommendations put forward an estimation of approximate 

costs of completing these tasks is provided in Table 22.1

Total $810,000 

 

22.3 Mineral Resource 

It was decided that underground channel samples should not be used for the 

grade estimation due to a bias observed between the original channel samples 

and the re-sampled channels by Oro Silver. In order to use these channel 

samples in future resource estimates it is suggested that further investigation be 

carried out into the reason behind the observed differences. It would be 



 

185 

 

beneficial to resolve this bias as the channel samples provide good information in 

the upper portion of the EC vein where few drill holes are found. 

 

The topographic surface used in the resource estimation is comprised of a 

detailed surface located in the central portion of the property, and a less precise 

surface for the surrounding area. The latter surface is derived from a government 

topographic survey at a much larger scale, where details related to the property 

area are vague. For this reason, it is recommended that a more precise 

topographic surface be flown in the area surrounding the property's central 

region. 

 

The close to surface area where historical mining has taken place was 

currently discarded from the mineral resource because of the absence of 

information about the mined out voids. To include this area in future resource 

estimate, it is suggested to have the mined out voids surveyed. 

 

As previously mentioned in Section 19.4.6 (Univariate Statistics), there are 

few gold and silver assays representing mineralization. There is consequently an 

associated risk with the resource estimate in the way that local changes could 

occur with additional sample data. It is thus recommended that more drilling be 

performed in the mineralized regions of the EC and El Orito veins, especially in 

the inferred portion.
