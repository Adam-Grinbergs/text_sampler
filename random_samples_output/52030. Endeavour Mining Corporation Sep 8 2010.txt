1.1 Introduc tion 

This report was commissioned by Etruscan Resources Inc. (Etruscan) and is an update of 

the feasibility study on the Agbaou Gold Project (Agbaou), situated approximately 200 

kilometres northwest of the port city of Abidjan within the Sud-Bandama region of Côte 

d'Ivoire, which was completed and filed on Sedar in November 2008.  

The feasibility capital and operating cost estimates were prepared in early 2008, when 

industry activity and supplier demands were at an all time high. It was viewed that the sharp 

contraction of the industry and the global economy in general that began in the fourth 

quarter 2008 presented an opportunity to improve on the economic metrics of the project. 

Etruscan took a decision in April 2009 to update the key project costing inputs and to re-

optimize and design the reserve at a gold price of US$1,000 per ounce, the latter based on 

the recent marked increases in the price of gold and an Etruscan corporate view of 

continuing gold price appreciation. The results of the updated pit design, costing and 

project economics are presented in this document. 

Etruscan is a Canadian mining company that has been exploring for gold and diamonds in 

Africa for over 12 years.  Etruscan holds one of the largest strategic land positions in West 

Africa covering over 10,000 km² in the prolific gold belts of Mali, Burkina Faso, 

Côte d'Ivoire  and Ghana. 

The Agbaou exploration permit was granted to Etruscan in November 2003.  Etruscan will 

have an 85% interest in any mining company established to mine at Agbaou with 10% 

being held by the State of Côte d'Ivoire and 5% being held by SODEMI.  

Etruscan completed a drilling campaign at Agbaou and recently provided drill results from 

holes that were drilled in December 2006.  As a result of their evaluation, it was concluded 

that the project should be taken to the feasibility study (FS) level in order to facilitate a 

production decision. 

The objectives of this feasibility study are as follows: 

 Assess technical, financial and other parameters affecting the exploitation of the 

deposit. 

 Develop a mining plan to support the strategy for exploitation. 

 Generate achievable construction and production schedules. 

 Develop a cost model accurate to ±10% with cash flows and costs.

 Assess the economics of the overall project and determine whether the operation is 

viable. 

 Produce a Feasibility Study document to progress the project to the next stage of work 

and development. 

The Feasibility Study and the update have been developed by a number of key parties with 

specialist competencies as follows: 

 MDM Engineering Ltd (MDM) - an international firm of mineral process engineers has 
provided the overall study management and strategy. MDM undertook the engineering 

and costing of all the plant, equipment and associated infrastructure facilities such as 

water, power and transportation requirements, to an accuracy of +/- 10%.  The 

metallurgy and processing sections have been produced in collaboration with Mintek 

Laboratory from South Africa. 

 Coffey Mining Pty Ltd. (Coffey Mining) – Coffey Mining undertook the resource and 
reserve evaluation and mining studies. 

 African Mining Consultants Limited (AMC) – AMC completed the environmental 
impact assessment. 

 Knight Piesold (Pty) Ltd. (Knight Piesold)– Knight Piesold undertook the design of 
the tailings management facility and water management as well as the hydro-

geotechnical evaluation for the open pit stabilities. 

 Golder Associates Inc. (Golder) – Golder undertook the wallrock-geotechnical 
evaluation for the open pit stabilities and pit slopes. 

1.2 L ocation 

Agbaou covers 469 km2, giving Etruscan control of the 40 kilometre strike length of the 

Agbaou Gold Belt in Côte d'Ivoire.   

The project is situated approximately 200 kilometres northwest of the port city of Abidjan, 

within the Sud-Bandama region of Côte d'Ivoire.  It is readily accessible by paved highway 

and is within 10 kilometres of the national power grid.  

1.3 G eology 

The Agbaou gold deposit is hosted within the Oumé-Fetekro greenstone belt of Birimian 

age and the rocks within the permit are predominantly deformed mafic volcanics 

metamorphosed to greenschist facies.

The greenstone belt is folded into an antiform, and the Agbaou deposit lies near the hinge 

of the fold on the eastern limb (Eisenlohr, 1998). Bedding, foliation and the dominant vein-

set are oriented along the strike of the fold (roughly northeast/southwest) and dip 

moderately to steeply, to the southeast. 

1.4 Mineralis ation 

The primary gold mineralisation at Agbaou is hosted within quartz vein types that occur 

within a broad area of deformation and alteration.  Gold mineralisation is also associated 

with variable amounts of sulphide, mainly pyrrhotite and pyrite.  Mineralisation also occurs 

within a laterite cap which covers the entire deposit area and is of variable thickness (1 to 

5m) and represents secondary (re-mobilized) mineralisation. 

The primary overall mineralised envelope is broad (60 to 100m), consisting of a number of 

mineralised zones that are parallel to the limb of the regional fold.  The quartz veins can 

occur within either meta-volcanic or meta-sedimentary rocks; the host rock is typically 

strongly sheared. 

1.5 R es ourc es  

Resource estimates for the Agbaou Gold Project have been generated by Coffey Mining on 

the basis of analytical results available up to 30th November 2007.  The resource model 

was derived via geological interpretation and modelling of the mineralised zones. 

Multiple Indicator Kriging ('MIK') estimation with indirect lognormal change of support to 

emulate mining selectivity was selected as an appropriate estimation method based on the 

quantity and spacing of available data, and the interpreted controls on, and styles of, 

mineralisation under review.  Mineralisation within the laterite cap has been estimated by 

Ordinary Kriging ('OK'). 

Coffey Mining also completed a detailed assessment of all pertinent analytical quality 

control data applied in resource estimation.  At the time of resource estimation, no material 

bias had been identified, and the analytical precision for both field duplicate and re-assay 

data lie within accepted industry limits. 

The summarised resource statement in Table 1.5-1 has been determined as at 

21st February 2008 and has been prepared and reported in a report dated March, 2008 

titled "Agbaou Gold Deposit Resource Estimation" in accordance with Canadian National 

Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of February 2001 (the 

Instrument) and the classifications adopted by CIM Council in December 2005.  The

resource estimate has been classified as an Indicated and Inferred Resource based on the 

confidence of the input data, geological interpretation, and grade estimation. 

Furthermore, the resource classification is also consistent with the Australasian Code for 

the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 

2004 (the Code) as prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian 

Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Mineral Council

1.6 Mining 

The mining reserve was re-optimized and designed at a gold price of US$1,000 per ounce 

versus US$750 in the previous issue of feasibility study. The increase gold price resulted in 

a marked increase in the number of in-situ and recovered ounces. Table 1.6-1 presents the 

updated reserve, the mine schedule and the mix of ore types (laterite, saprolite, transition 

and bedrock). 

The new reserve now stands at 10.9 million tonnes at an average feed grade of 2.1 g/t 
which equates to 731 kozs of in-situ gold or 665 kozs recovered at an average recovery 

factor of 97% for mining and 91% for the process plant. This represents a 29% increase in 

reserve ounces compared to the previous feasibility pits. As well, at the treatment rate of 
1.2 MTPA from year 1 and onwards, the project life has been expanded from circa six 

years to ten. 

For costing purposes, the owner operated fleet assumption was retained for this exercise. 

The fleet capex was adjusted to accommodate the overall increase in mined material. The

1.7 Metallurgic al Tes ting 

Tests to determine the mineralogical, comminution, and metallurgical characteristics of the 

Agbaou ore were carried out by Mintek of South Africa. Representative composite samples 

were taken from exploration drill cores for conducting various test programmes. The aims 

of the testwork campaign were: 

 To establish the mineralogical composition of the different ore formations from the 

Agbaou ore body 

 To investigate the response of the different ore types to gravity recovery 

 To investigate the response of the different ore types to cyanidation 

 To establish optimum conditions of leaching in terms of cyanide consumption, oxygen 

uptake, lime consumption, leach time and grind.

Results indicate a medium to hard ore with good amenability to gravity recovery using 

conventional centrifugal concentrators.  

North SAPR showed slowed dissolution rate under conditions of natural oxygen while the 

rest of the ore types gave good dissolution under conditions of natural oxygen. CIL 

dissolution varied from 83.80% in North SAPR to 90.80% in South BDRK with natural 

oxygenation. Leaching SAPR at elevated oxygen and reduced solids concentration 

increased CIL dissolution to above 92.0%. 

1.8 P roces s  P lant 

The Agbaou processing plant consists of a 3 stage crushing (for treatment of hard rock), a 

single stage tooth roll crushing (for treatment of the soft rock), ball milling, gravity 

concentration and cyanidation by carbon-in-leach (CIL).  Pressure Zadra elution will be 

utilised for recovery of gold from loaded carbon.   

Hard Rock Crushing  
The hard rock crushing section is a three stage crushing circuit consisting of a primary jaw 

crusher, a secondary and two parallel tertiary hydro-cone crushers. ROM feed is crushed 

from 100% passing 1000mm to 80% passing 8mm for the feed to the mills. The hard rock 

crushing circuit is designed for a throughput of 280tph of primary ore.  

Soft Rock Crushing and Mill Feed Stockpile 
The majority of the saprolite material is finer than the normal three stage product with the 

exception of occasional lumps which require minimum energy to break down to size 

suitable for feed to the mill. A single stage soft rock crushing circuit has therefore been 

included to treat the incompetent saprolite and transitional material at a rate of 170tph.

Agbaou Gold Mine 
Ref: 1024/KG/000 

Page 9 

Crushed primary ore from the hard rock crushing section is stored on the 5000t (live) mill 

feed stockpile where it is reclaimed from the stockpile by a combination of 8 vibrating 

variable speed pan feeders; four feeding onto each of the two mill feed conveyors. Lime is 

added to both mill feed conveyors from the lime silo which is located in a position between 

the mill feed conveyors. Hammer-swing samplers are installed on the mill feed conveyors 

for primary sampling of plant feed. 

Milling 
The milling circuit comprises two parallel single stage ball mills in closed circuit with a 

common mill discharge sump and classifying hydro-cyclone cluster.  When treating soft 

rock material, the two mills are operated in series with one mill functioning as the primary 

mill and the other as the secondary mill. When treating competent transitional and primary 

hard rock material, the two mills are operated in parallel, both functioning as primary mills.  

Gravity 
The plant is equipped with two parallel primary gravity recovery streams and a common 

redress concentrator. A fraction of the cyclone underflow is tapped from the underflow 

splitter to each of the two gravity streams. Each gravity stream consists of a scalping 

screen and a centrifugal concentrator. A common redress table treats the primary 

concentrate to produce the final gravity concentrate ready for smelting. 

CIL 
The leach/CIL consists of seven agitated tanks each with 1500m3 capacity. Due to the high 

preg-robbing capacity of the ores, the first tank will be used only as a pre-leach. Carbon will 

be added to the tanks at an average concentration of 15g/l. Loaded carbon will be 

advanced to elution in 6t batches. 

Acid Wash, Elution and Regeneration 
The acid wash/ elution circuit is sized to handle a 6 tonne batch of loaded carbon at gold 

loadings of 1600g/t of carbon for SAPR and 3400g/t of carbon for BDRK and a residual 

carbon loading of 100g/t.  The design requirement is to treat one batch per day for 26 days 

in a month.  

The regeneration circuit is designed to regenerate every batch that is eluted, with provision 

for bypassing regeneration if carbon activity is high enough. 

Electrowinning and Smelt 
Two electrowinning cells operating in parallel recover gold from the elution circuit. Gold 

plated onto the stainless steel cathodes is washed into the decant tank using a high

Page 10 

pressure washing machine. Calcined redressed gravity concentrate and cathode sludge 

from the electrowinning cells are fluxed and smelted separately for the purpose of metal 

accounting reconciliation. 

Tailings and Cyanide Detoxification 
The CIL tails slurry and other effluent streams including the reject acid wash solution and 

fine carbon stream from the regeneration kiln report to the carbon safety screen. The 

carbon safety screen reclaims any abraded carbon that may be present in the tailings.  

After removal of fugitive carbon, tailings gravitate into two detoxification tanks, placed in 

series into which hydrogen peroxide is pumped at a controlled rate to destroy the Weak 

Acid Dissociable Cyanide (WAD Cyanide) to levels acceptable for discharging the effluent 

to the tailings storage facility.  

Reagents  
Reagent makeup and offloading facilities include sodium cyanide, caustic soda, 

hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Where possible, reagents have been located as 

close as possible to their final area of use to avoid pumping over long distances from make 

up area to points of use. 

Water  
Raw Water Supply 

Raw water is extracted from two sources: from the pit dewatering boreholes and from the 

seasonal stream containment dam which is upstream of the tailings storage facility. 

Borehole water from pit dewatering is pumped into an overnight pond from where it is 

pumped to the plant raw water dam or the process water pond. Raw water is also pumped 

from the seasonal stream containment dam. 

Process Water 

The process water pond, located in the plant area receives water from two main water 

sources, namely the return water from the tailings storage facility, and raw water top up. 

The process water pond supplies water for the main process dilution and all spray water for 

screens. Tailings return water is pumped from the return water settling pond into the 

process water pond. 

Air Services  
Compressed air for process air and instrument air is provided by two compressors, a duty 

and a standby. Separate air receivers, one for plant and general air, and the other for 

instrument air, supply the plant with air. Instrument air is equipped with two air dryers and 

sets of pre and post filters for the air to meet the quality required for use as instrument air.

A minimum pressure of 600kPa will be maintained for functionality of instruments in the 

plant. Regulators will be fitted where lower pressure will be required. 

1.9 T ailings  

The principle concept for the Feasibility Study design of the tailings storage facility (TSF) is 

based on an outer impoundment wall constructed with waste rock derived from the open pit 

mining operation.  The embankment will be constructed by the downstream method which 

facilitates incremental raising as tailings storage requirements dictate, and as availability of 

waste rock from the mining operation permits.  Filters will be incorporated in the upstream 

toe of the starter embankments, and will discharge into a solution trench around the 

perimeter of the facility.  Toe paddocks will collect any runoff from the outer slopes of the 

facility.   

Seepage from the facility will be contained within the TSF footprint by the installation of a 

bentonite slurry trench extending into low permeability clay at a depth of approximately 4m 

below natural ground level, which will be constructed at the upstream toe of the rockfill 

starter wall. 

Tailings will be deposited into the facility by spigotting from a perimeter distribution pipe laid 

around the upstream crest of the starter wall.  Ongoing wall building will be achieved by 

downstream raises of the rockfill embankment.  The initial wall will be constructed to an 

elevation of 198m amsl (Phase 1), with two subsequent raises of 4m each taking the final 

crest level to 206m amsl (Phases 2 and 3).  The distribution pipeline will be moved up onto 

the crest of each successive wall raise.  The TSF has been designed to have an overall 

outer slope of 1 vertical to 3 horizontal, to facilitate rehabilitation of the slope.  The 

upstream slope is 1:1.5. 

A stacked ring decant will be constructed at the centre of the facility to draw off supernatent 

water.  The decant will be accessed by means of a timber walkway.  The decant outfall pipe 

will be an encased 750mm concrete pipe, discharging into an HDPE lined return water dam 

of 11 520m3 capacity.  The return water dam will incorporate a spillway discharging into the 

natural watercourse for flood events in excess of the 100 year recurrence interval storm. 

1.10 E nvironment 

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been undertaken to investigate the local 

and social environment existing prior to the development of the Project and to determine 

the likely positive and negative impacts that the project will incur on the environment.  The 

timing, extent, intensity and cumulative effects of these impacts have also been

investigated.  A quantitative classification was conducted for the impacts that were 

identified in order to rank the importance of these impacts for management purposes. 

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was subsequently developed for the mining 

operations and to mitigate the identified environmental and social impacts. This includes a 

budget for a Relocation Action Plan (RAP), operational budget during operations and an 

initial mine closure estimate. 

A detailed summary of the work undertaken by AMC can be found in Section 23 of this

At a constant gold price of US$1000 per ounce the project generates a before tax IRR of 

24.9% based on an initial capital investment of US$106.1 million.  The initial capital 

investment will be paid back in 4 years.  Life-of-mine operating costs are estimated at 

US$516 per ounce and the cumulative before-tax cash flows are US$187.6 million.  At a 

constant gold price of US$1200 per ounce the before tax IRR increases to 39.1% and the

The updated project is significantly more robust than the original feasibility project and 

presents a financial case to proceed with development of the Agbaou Gold Project. The 

base case at $1,000 gold returns a pre-tax IRR of 24.9% compared to 9.4% in the previous 

feasibility study using a gold price of $850 per ounce. Table 1.14-1 compares the updated 

results to the feasibility study.  

Although the US$1,000 spot gold price is presently not consistently attained, forward selling 

of all or part of the production would allow this price level to be achieved at the current gold 

forward premium levels. At US$900 gold the project is still viable with the pre-tax IRR being 

17.2%.

2.1 Introduc tion 

This study was commissioned by Etruscan Resources Inc. (Etruscan), a Canadian mining 

company that has been exploring for gold and diamonds in Africa for over 12 years.  

Etruscan holds one of the largest strategic land positions in West Africa covering over 

10,000km² in the prolific gold belts of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire  and Ghana. 

The Agbaou permit was granted to Etruscan in November 2003.  Etruscan will have an 

85% interest in any mining company established to mine at Agbaou with 10% being held by 

the State of Côte d'Ivoire and 5% being held by SODEMI.  

Etruscan completed a drilling campaign at the Agbaou Gold Deposit (Agbaou) and recently 

provided additional drill results from holes that were drilled in December 2006.  As a result 

of their evaluation, it was concluded that the project should be taken to the feasibility study 

(FS) level in order to facilitate a production decision. 

2.2 F eas ibility S tudy, C ontrac tors  And S c ope Of Work 

The objectives of this feasibility study are as follows: 

 Assess technical, financial and other parameters affecting the exploitation of the 

deposit. 

 Develop a mining plan to support the strategy for exploitation. 

 Generate achievable construction and production schedules. 

 Develop a cost model accurate to ±10% with cash flows and costs. 

 Assess the economics of the overall project and determine whether the operation is 

viable. 

 Produce a Feasibility Study document to progress the project to the next stage of work 

and development. 

The final feasibility study will provide the basis for further work on the Agbaou Gold Project. 

Should the project be economically sound, the feasibility study will provide the majority of 

information required to obtain finance and allow the development of detailed design and 

engineering work. 

The Feasibility Study has been developed by a number of key parties with specialist 

competencies as follows:

The Agbaou Exploration Permit (Permis de recherche no.177) has been granted by the 

Government of Côte d'Ivoire. The permit has been granted to Etruscan Resources Côte 

d'Ivoire SARL by Decree from the Ministry of Mines and Energy and cannot be contested 

by any other company. The government is entitled to a 10% carried interest in all mining 

projects within the country by way of a 10% shareholding in the exploitation company that 

will be created to mine the deposit. The Government's interest does therefore not 

materialize until a mining permit is granted and an exploitation company is created. In the 

specific case of the Agbaou project, SODEMI is also entitled to a 5% free carried 

shareholding interest in the exploitation company. 

The Agbaou Permit is classified as an exploration permit which allows the company to carry 

out exploration and development activities, provided certain conditions and fee payments 

are maintained with the Ministry of Mines and Energy. It does not allow mining activities for 

which a mining permit has to be issued. All exploration permits granted in Côte d'Ivoire are 

for an initial three year period.  The Agbaou permit was granted on November 27th 2003 

and has subsequently been renewed by Ministerial Arrêté on March 22nd 2007 for a period 

of two years with an effective date of November 27th, 2006. In accordance with the 

provisions of the Mining Code, the permit area was reduced to 469 square kilometers. An 

application was filed on October 6, 2008 for the second renewal of the permit and is 

currently pending. A request has been made in this renewal application to maintain an area 

of 469 square kilometers. Pending renewal, the permit remains valid.

Etruscan's evaluation of the Agbaou project area began in 2003 with the acquisition of the 

Agbaou permit.  Exploration has been carried out under the supervision of technically 

qualified personnel applying standard industry approaches.  Geochemical data quality has 

routinely been assessed as part of ongoing exploration procedures.  All data acquired 

meets or exceeds industry standards.  All exploration work has been carried out by, or 

supervised by technical personnel of the operator (e.g. Etruscan, BHP, etc).  Consultants 

and contractors have been engaged by Etruscan for various activities including; sample 

collection, drilling and assaying. 

11.1 S oil S ampling P rogram 

Semi-regional and detailed soil sampling completed on the Agbaou permit have confirmed 

and further refined the anomalies initially identified during the BHP and Goldivoire surveys.  

Soil samples consisted of "B" horizon material collected from hand-dug pits, 20-30cm deep.  

Semi-regional sampling is generally completed every 50 meters along lines spaced 

400 meters apart and detailed sampling is completed every 50 meters, along lines running 

perpendicular to the original sample lines, spaced 100 meters apart.  Samples are assayed 

using low-detection limit, aqua-regia gold analyses by Transworld Laboratories Ltd. 

("Transworld") of Tarkwa, Ghana.

Detailed pit sampling was completed to aid in the definition of the lateritic cap resource 

which was identified and modelled in earlier campaigns.  The pitting program covered an 

area of approximately 400m2 on all sides of the deposits.  The results of this program 

outlined anomalous gold values in the laterite along the west flank of the Main deposit, and 

to a lesser extent some anomalies were observed along the east flank (Figure 11.2-1). 

Pit samples were collected from "hand-dug" pits, 0.2 to 7.5 meters deep, depth being 

controlled by the base of the laterite.  Pits were systematically completed on a 50 meter by 

75 meter grid over the Agbaou Main and Agbaou Main-South deposits.  Samples are 

collected from narrow channels chipped in the floor and wall of the pit and comprise a 

maximum of 1.5 meters of channel length.  Samples are assayed using 50 gram charge fire 

assay gold analyses completed by Transworld of Tarkwa, Ghana.

12.1 Introduc tion 

Drilling at the Agbaou Gold Project has been managed by both Etruscan geologists and 

contract geologists since their acquisition of the project.  Surface Reverse Circulation ('RC') 

and Diamond Core ('DC') drilling have been completed and the drill program was designed 

to increase confidence of grade and continuity within the mineralisation envelopes. 

Prior to Etruscan's involvement at Agbaou, a total of 183 drillholes (a combination of RC 

and Diamond drilling) had been completed for a total of 23752m.  Between 1988 and 1994, 

BHP drilled 8 diamond drillholes for a total of 1680m.  Goldivoire (under its' various 

ownerships) subsequently drilled 175 drillholes (20 537.4m RC and 1535.4m Diamond) 

between 1997 and 1999. 

Etruscan has completed two drill campaigns since acquiring the property in 2003.  Table 

12.1-1 outlines the drilling to the end of September 2007 and a summary of drillhole collars 

can be found in the report of Coffey Mining dated March 2008 titled "Agbaou Gold Deposit

A combination RC and diamond drilling program was undertaken by Etruscan between 

June and September 2005 which culminated in the completion of 42 holes, 13 of which had 

core tails (Figure 12.1-1).  Drilling was completed by Foraco International of France utilizing 

a Reska R30, a combination RC/Core drill rig.  The focus of this drilling was to provide 

confidence in the earlier drilling results and add ounces to the Agbaou Main deposit area.

meters (Figure 12.1-2).  An SRS850 rig was utilised.  The drilling was designed to: provide 

sufficient information to bring historic resource estimates for Agbaou into compliance with 

National Instrument 43-101; to provide sufficient information to determine Mineral Reserves 

as the basis for the feasibility study; to provide samples for metallurgical and geotechnical 

testwork; and to test for depth, strike extensions and additional targets for gold 

mineralisation. 

Both of these drilling companies are reputable companies providing RC and Diamond 

drilling services consistent with current industry standard.  Table 12.5-1 summarises 

pertinent drilling statistics for all holes drilled on the Agbaou concession at the time of 

commencement of the resource estimate study.  A total of 391 drillholes have been 

completed of which 386 of these drillholes (in the currently defined resource area) were 

used for the resource estimation study.

12.2.1 Ac c urac y of Drillhole C ollar L oc ations  

Collar surveys were originally completed using an Ashtech (THALES) differential global 

positioning system ("DGPS") and co-ordinates reported in WGS84, UTM Zone 30 North.  In 

order to improve the accuracy all drill collars have subsequently been independently 

surveyed by Envitech using total-station survey techniques.  Envitech conducted a traverse 

from the nearest control point (RGIR 13) to the Agbaou camp base station.  The control 

point was provided by the National Cartography Center, and is located in Tiassale some 

105km southeast of Agbaou.  The base station was used to set up two field stations within 

the limits of the deposit, ST1 and ST2, from which all survey points were measured.  A 

LEICA total station instrument, with an accuracy of 2-5mm, was used by Envitech.  Both 

UTM and local grid co-ordinates were recorded.  When the previous DGPS coordinates are 

compared to total station survey data, some substantial differences are noted.  This results 

in differences of -9.7m to +8.2m in the easting and northing and +12m to +22.3m in the 

elevation.  While the total station coordinates are considered extremely accurate in a 

relative sense, the differential between it and the previous DGPS data has not been 

adequately explained. 

12.2.2 Downhole S urveying P roc edures  

All drillholes completed by Etruscan were down-hole surveyed using either a Terratec or a 

Flexit© downhole instrument at a minimum of every 30m and measured relative to 

magnetic north.  These measurements have been converted from magnetic to UTM Zone

significant hole deviation is evident in plan or section. 

12.2.3 R evers e C irculation Drilling P roc edures  

Etruscan supervised RC drilling was completed by Foraco International of France using a 

Reska 30 truck mounted rig.  RC rods were 4½ inch diameter and the drill bit used was a 

standard 5½ inch diameter. 

12.3 Diamond Drilling P roc edures  

Etruscan supervised diamond drilling was completed by Foraco International of France and 

Boart Longyear of Canada.  Foraco International used a Reska 30 truck mounted rig.  Boart 

Longyear used an SRS 850-03 skid mounted rig.  HQ and NQ drilling was completed and 

the core was oriented by a combination of the spear technique and both Flexit and Reflex 

multi shot devices.

Only methods applied by Etruscan are considered in this section as documentation of 

previous sampling methodologies prior to Etruscans involvement are not available. 

13.1 R C  S ampling and L ogging 

RC drill chips were collected as 1m intervals downhole via a cyclone into PVC bags, and 

then weighed prior to splitting. 

The collected samples were riffle split using a three tier Jones riffle splitter.  A final sample 

of approximately 3kg was collected for submission to the laboratory for analysis.  The 

splitter and boxes were cleaned with compressed air between samples.  If the sample was 

wet, the entire sample was placed in a large rice bag and allowed to dry in the core shed 

before the weight was recorded and the sample was split off.   

The geologist records the sample number, total weight, if water was present, and a number 

of characteristics of the cuttings on a log sheet.  RC drilling completed by Etruscan has 

been geologically logged during the drilling program, however the logging methodology was 

reviewed during the latest core drilling program and a re-logging program has been initiated 

but not completed to date.  This data was therefore not available in the supplied database.  

Drill cuttings from each sample interval have been glued onto an A3 size chip-board as a 

permanent record.  This is stored at the Etruscan exploration camp in Agbaou. 

13.2 Diamond C ore S ampling and L ogging 

All drillholes were collared with HQ size single tube core (77.8mm) and once competent 

rock is encountered the hole was reduced to NQ size core (60.3mm). 

The current core handling procedures are as follows:- 

 Core laid out into core boxes on the drill site. 

 Core transported from the drill site, in a specifically designed core tray transport device, 

to the logging yard where core is laid out in sequence. 

 Core marked–up, geotechnically logged, recoveries and RQD's measured. (RQD's are 

not recorded in the saprolitic segments of the core). 

 Core geologically logged. 

 Core photographed with a digital camera. 

 Core marked up for cutting and cut with a conventional diamond core saw.  Strongly 

oxidised core is split using a spatula.

Page 32 

 Bulk density samples are selected and  determinations performed on site.  Previously, 

samples were dispatched to TWL in Ghana for the measurements of bulk densities. 

Industry standard core sampling methods are used throughout.  The orientation mark is 

accurately transferred to the side of the core, representing the bottom of the core.  The core 

is then matched up in the core trays and the orientation line propagated along the length of 

the core.  The core is then marked off for sampling on a geological basis or to a maximum 

of 1.5m sample intervals. 

Core sampling is undertaken using a diamond saw to cut the core lengthways, ensuring 

that the orientation line is preserved on the half of the core that is retained for reference.  

When no orientation line can be drawn, a cut line is drawn.  Core orientation stubs are 

clearly marked and not sampled unless absolutely necessary.  The core samples are 

bagged and tagged ready for sample preparation as per a prepared cut sheet which is 

generated from excel.  For best practice, Etruscan endeavours to sample the same half 

core throughout all holes. 

All cores are logged wet by experienced geologists using a simple and consistent code 

system.  In addition, basic structural and geotechnical information is routinely collected, as 

this will reduce the scope of specialist geotechnical consultants and the number of 

dedicated geotechnical drillholes, as well as enhancing the quality of the geological 

interpretations. However, the quality of the spear generated orientations is not high, and 

this affects the quality and the quantity of structural data that can be recorded from such 

orientated core. 

Core is photographed when wet and when dry, two trays at the time. 

Upon arrival at the core processing facility, the core is matched up, oriented, logged and 

recoveries calculated prior to marking off for sampling and cutting. 

13.3 S ample R ec overy 

Sample recovery for RC drilling was noted as very good and averages approximately 

23.3kg per metre drilled.  Bulk sample weights have been systematically recorded for each 

metre drilled. 

Sample recovery in Diamond holes was very good although recoveries for core from the 

moderate to highly weathered saprolite and highly fractured and brecciated zones returned 

poor recoveries.  Etruscan utilised HQ drilling to minimise the core loss in the weathered 

zones.

13.4 S ample Quality 

The sampling procedures adopted for drilling are consistent with current industry practise.  

Samples collected by diamond coring within the highly weathered zones are of moderate 

quality, with the remainder being high.  Sample recoveries and quality for the RC drilling 

are high. 

A total of 9 drillholes of the diamond drilling and RC drilling completed before Etruscan's 

involvement have been twinned.  Many of these twin drillholes reproduce the original 

intercept with a moderate degree of accuracy; however, a number fail to reproduce the 

original intercept.  This may be attributed to the downhole separation distance increasing to 

a degree where the intercepts are no longer equivalent.  

It is difficult to determine if any negative bias has resulted in the diamond drilling due to the 

use of water.  A number of the diamond core holes had poor recovery in the highly 

weathered zone and there exists potential to wash out the fine gold associated with the 

fractures and veining and therefore underestimate the gold content.  The proportion of 

diamond drilling in the weathered zones is, however, low and the potential for 

underestimation associated with this type of negative bias are considered commensurately 

low. 

RC field duplicate samples are routinely collected to allow assessment of the field sampling 

error (or bias) once the laboratory error, determined from analysis of pulp duplicates, has 

been subtracted.  Acceptable reproducibility has been identified during an assessment of 

RC field duplicate data (Section 15.2) generated and no distinct bias is evident.

14.1 S ample S ec urity 

The close scrutiny of sample submission procedures by Etruscan technical staff, and the 

rapid submission of samples from drilling for analysis, provides little opportunity for sample 

tampering.  Given the umpire assaying via an external international laboratory and the 

regular 'blind' submission of international standards to both the primary and umpire assay 

facilities, any misleading analytical data would be readily recognised and investigated. 

Etruscan sampling procedures require samples to be collected in plastic sample bags that 

are immediately stapled closed once taken.  Samples are then transported to the Agbaou 

camp to be transported by either Etruscan or laboratory staff directly to the laboratory. 

Reference material is retained and stored at the Etruscan exploration camp at Agbaou, as 

well as RC drilling chips, half-core and photographs generated by Diamond drilling, and 

duplicate pulps and residues of all submitted samples.  Assessment of the data indicates 

that the assay results are generally consistent with the logged alteration and mineralisation, 

and are entirely consistent with the anticipated tenor of mineralisation.  No aspect of the 

sample preparation was conducted by Etruscan personnel. 

14.2 Analytic al L aboratories  

Preparation and assaying of samples from the Agbaou deposit has been carried out at an 

independent laboratory, Transworld Laboratories Ltd. (TWL) Tarkwa, Ghana. 

14.3 S ample P reparation and Analytic al P roc edure 

The assay method applied by TWL Tarkwa for the Agbaou drilling is summarised below.  

All aspects of sample preparation and analysis were undertaken at TWL Tarkwa. 

Sample Preparation 

 3kg or less of sample is dried, disaggregated, and jaw crushed to 3mm. 

 Sample is pulverised to a nominal 95% passing -75 micron using an LM2

15.1 Quality C ontrol P roc edures  

The quality control procedures adopted by the Etruscan and the relevant analytical 

laboratories are listed in point form below. 

15.1.1 E trus c an 

Etruscan has undertaken the following procedures which include:- 

 Insertion of 17 (Rocklabs) internationally certified standard reference material (5% of 

samples). 

 Insertion of Blank material (5% of samples).  Blank material was initially sourced from 

previously assayed, barren hanging-wall material from existing holes; this was 

discontinued and followed by surface sands from the near-by granitic terrane. 

 RC Field duplicates (5% of samples). 

 Diamond Core Field duplicates completed by a second split at the 3mm jaw crushing 

stage. 

 Submission of selected Umpire samples (pulps) to SGS Lakefield, Canada. 

 Review of the Etruscan and the internal laboratory QC data on a batch by batch basis 

and re-assay where necessary. 

These assay quality control procedures are summarised in the following sections. 

15.1.2 T rans world T arkwa 

The following quality control procedures are adopted by TWL:- 

 Cross referencing of sample identifiers (sample tags) during sample sorting and 

preparation with sample sheets and client submission sheet. 

 Compressed air gun used to clean crushing and milling equipment between samples. 

 Barren quartz 'wash' applied to the milling/pulverising equipment at the rate of 1:10. 

 Quartz washes assayed to determine the level of cross contamination. 

 Sieve tests are carried out on pulps at the rate of 1:50 to ensure adequate size 

reduction. 

 Assaying of certified standards at the rate of one per batch of 20. 

 A minimum of 5% (1:20) of the submitted samples in each batch are subject to repeat 

analysis.

 Blank samples are inserted at the rate of approximately 1:30. 

 Industry recognised certified standards are disguised and inserted at a rate of 1:30. 

 Assaying of internal standards data. 

 Participation in one international round robin program; Geostats of Australia. 

15.2 Quality C ontrol Analys is  

The quality control data analysed by Coffey Mining includes:- 

 Standard and blanks. 

 Field duplicates. 

 Laboratory repeats. 

 Re-assayed pulps. 

 Umpire assaying (pulps). 

The assay quality control data, as they pertain to resource estimates completed on the 

basis of data available, have been subset into the categories above, and reviewed 

separately. 

The quality control data has been assessed statistically using a number of comparative 

analyses for available datasets.  The objectives of these analyses were to determine 

relative precision and accuracy levels between various sets of assay pairs and the quantum 

of relative error.  The results of the statistical analyses are presented as summary plots, 

which include the following:- 

 Thompson and Howarth Plot showing the mean relative percentage error of grouped 

assay pairs across the entire grade range, used to visualise precision levels by 

comparing against given control lines. 

 Rank % HARD Plot, which ranks all assay pairs in terms of precision levels measured 

as half of the absolute relative difference from the mean of the assay pairs (% HARD), 

used to visualise relative precision levels and to determine the percentage of the assay 

pairs population occurring at a certain precision level. 

 Mean vs. % HARD Plot, used as another way of illustrating relative precision levels by 

showing the range of % HARD over the grade range. 

 Mean vs. % HRD Plot is similar to the above, but the sign is retained, thus allowing 

negative or positive differences to be computed.  This plot gives an overall impression 

of precision and also shows whether or not there is significant bias between the assay

pairs by illustrating the mean percent half relative difference between the assay pairs 

(mean % HRD). 

 Correlation Plot is a simple plot of the value of assay 1 against assay 2.  This plot 

allows an overall visualisation of precision and bias over selected grade ranges.  

Correlation coefficients are also used. 

 Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot is a means where the marginal distributions of two 

datasets can be compared.  Similar distributions should be noted if the data is 

unbiased. 

Comments on the results of the statistical analyses for each laboratory are provided below. 

15.2.1 T rans world L aboratory, T arkwa 

TWL Duplicate Repeats 

At TWL, every 20th sample is duplicated.  A duplicate is two separate samples taken from 

the total pulped sample.  Duplicate repeats are analysed in the same batch and are 

therefore not subject to intra-batch variance.  Only assays greater than 10 times the 

detection level (>=0.1ppm Au) are included in the assessment and data are divided into 

drillcore (235 assays) and riffle split 1m RC drill chips (73 assays).  Results show 

equivalent means between the duplicate repeats and precision within acceptable limits for 

both the diamond core and RC, although at the lower end of precision for the RC. 

TWL Pulp Respray 

After initial calibration of the AAS with control standards, the batch is sprayed (the aspirator 

tube is placed in the DIBK layer and approximately 1ml is sprayed into the AAS flame).  On 

combustion, the absorbance is measured by the AAS and the strength of the absorbance is 

proportional to the gold concentration).  At the end of spraying, the operator returns to 

every 10th samples and performs the same operation and this is the Pulp Respray.  At the 

end, control samples are again presented to the AAS to verify that short term drift has not 

occurred.  Only assays greater than 10 times the detection level (>=0.1ppm Au) are 

included in the assessment and data are divided into drillcore (379 assays) and riffle split 

1m RC drill chips (127 assays).  Results show equivalent means between the duplicate 

repeats and precision well within acceptable limits for the diamond core and RC samples.  

Again, precision is more marginal for the RC samples 

TWL Check Repeats 

Check repeats occur where high grade samples are encountered or where the result is out 

of sequence (eg in a sequence of results 0.01-0.04-0.02-1.2-0.03: Result 1.2 is out of 

sequence and would be repeated).  A repeat is a second 50g sample taken from the same

kraft envelope as the original analysis (Au1) and is thus different from the duplicate repeat.  

Check Repeats are analysed later than the original assay (in a different batch) and may 

therefore be subject to intra-batch variance compared with the original result.  Insufficient 

data is available for this type of quality control to be analysed meaningfully. 

TWL Pulp Reassay 

Only assays greater than 10 times the detection level (>=0.1ppm Au) are included in the 

assessment and data are divided into drillcore (HQ and NQ, 127 assays) and riffle split 1m 

RC drill chips (108 assays).  Results show equivalent means between the duplicate repeats 

and precision within acceptable limits for both diamond core and RC samples.

15.2.2 E trus c an QAQC  

Etruscan Field Standards and Blanks 

A total of 17 Certified Standards and one blank have been included in sample batches sent 

to TWL.  A total of 2,147 assays were available for analysis.  When analysing the results, 

assays showing similar grades to other standards were assumed to be an incorrect 

insertion and were excluded from the analysis.  Results show a range of negative to 

positive bias of -8.89 to 5.64% for Transworld Laboratories.  This positive bias is generally 

more evident at higher grades.  Of significant note is the negative bias of -8.89% displayed 

by standard OXE21 (EV 0.651g/t Au). 

Etruscan blank material was sourced from previously assayed, barren hanging wall 

material and has been latterly composed of barren surface sands from the nearby granitic 

terrain.  All of this material is uncertified and it is recommended that certified blank material 

be used in the future. 

Etruscan Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates totalling 1,106 have been sent to TWL.  Only assays returning values 

greater than 0.1ppm Au (total 189) have been considered in the analysis.  Results show 

equivalent means for both drillcore and RC chips and acceptable levels of precision (albeit 

at the lower end of acceptability) for the type of duplicate.   

Etruscan Assay Resplits (Umpire) 

A total of 216 RC and diamond samples (pulps, one batch) were sent for analysis at SGS 

Lakefield, Canada (TWL was the primary laboratory for the initial analysis).  Only assays 

>0.1g/t Au are considered in the analysis and a total of 108 assay pairs are available for 

analysis.  Results show a significantly lower mean for analysis completed on RC samples 

at SGS (7.55g/t Au compared to 6.31g/t Au, 16% lower).  Diamond core analysis shows a 

significantly higher result for analysis completed at SGS, however with a sample population 

of only 6 data pairs, this cannot be considered meaningful. 

15.3 QAQC  C onc lus ions  

Coffey Mining believes that the current QAQC systems in place at Agbaou to monitor the 

precision and accuracy of the sampling and assaying are adequate.  Pertinent conclusions 

from the analysis of the available QAQC data include:- 

 Use of Certified Standard Reference material has shown a range of relative bias for 

TWL, Tarkwa which varies between-8.9% to +5.6%.  This requires monitoring on an 

ongoing basis to determine the reason for the range of bias.

Page 42 

 Repeat analyses have confirmed that the precision of sampling and assaying is within 

acceptable limits for sampling of gold deposits. 

 Umpire assaying at SGS Lakefield has returned a significantly lower mean grade than 

the original assaying.  This is based on one batch and should be monitored on an 

ongoing basis to identify the reason why.   

 The use of Certified Standard Reference material as blank material is recommended at 

Agbaou. 

15.4 B ulk Dens ity Determinations  

A total of 654 bulk density determinations have been collected from the Agbaou deposit.  A 

total of 277 determinations have been completed by TWL Laboratories, 363 were 

completed by Etruscan (of these, some have been also determined by TWL) and 48 

completed prior to Etruscans involvement.  Only determinations completed since Etruscans 

involvement are considered.  All readings were taken over a range of lithological and 

weathered profiles.  The procedure used by both Etruscan and TWL is detailed below and 

works on the Archimedes Principle:- 

 10cm billet of clean core is weighed (note the core is not oven dried prior to bulk 

density determination). 

 Core is immersed in paraffin wax then reweighed to establish weight of the wax. 

 Core is then suspended and weighed in water to determine the volume. 

The Bulk Density is then calculated as Bulk Density core = [Mass core] / [(Mass air – Mass 

water) – (Mass wax / 0.99)]. 

Only bulk density determinations carried out by Etruscan (363) were used for the resource 

estimation.  Results are presented in Table 17.7-2. 

It is recommended that core is oven dried to a maximum of 60ºC for a 6 hour period prior to 

bulk density determination.  Without this step, the procedure described above cannot result 

in a true dry bulk density and therefore the results presented in Table 17.7-2 are 

somewhere between In Situ Bulk Density and Dry Bulk Density.

topography is likely to be locally poor.  Coffey Mining considers the topography to be of 

insufficient confidence and recommends further work be carried out to enable contours to 

be defined at 1m levels. 

15.6 Data Quality S ummary 

On the basis of the Coffey Mining involvement in consulting to Etruscan, the 

appropriateness of the exploration procedures relating to resource delineation can be 

summarised as follows:- 

 Diamond and RC drilling have been undertaken by reputable contract drilling 

companies using industry standard drilling equipment and procedures. 

 Survey control is accomplished by surveying of drillhole collars using high accuracy 

surveying equipment.  Drillhole locations are well established in relation to the UTM 

grid. 

 Drillhole sampling procedures are consistent with acceptable industry standards. 

 Assaying procedures are considered consistent with acceptable industry standards. 

 QAQC procedures are adequate, although further analysis of the range of bias noted in 

the TWL assay data is required. 

 Bulk density determinations based on diamond core samples are considered 

acceptable for resource calculation; however, core needs to be oven dried as 

previously noted. 

 The umpire sampling program needs to be undertaken on a regular basis. 

15.7 S ourc e Data 

Etruscan has maintained all digital and hard copy data for the Agbaou Gold Project.  In 

summary, the following key digital data relevant to the resource estimation study are 

available:- 

 Drillhole databases containing collar location data, downhole survey data, assay data, 

and geology data. 

 Internal documentation including geological logging tables. 

 Density databases. 

 In addition, reference data and support documentation relevant to the resource 

estimation study are available as are internal company reports.

The Agbaou deposit is just 22km southeast of Lihir Gold Limited's (Lihir) Bonikro Gold 

Project.  Construction and commissioning of Bonikro is now complete and commercial 

production began in August 2008.  Current open pit mineable reserves at Bonikro are 

estimated to be 821K ounces at an average grade of 1.9g/t Au (July 2006). 

The Oumé permit, which hosts the Bonikro deposit, was first explored using regional 

geophysics completed in the 1970s by French, British and Canadian interests.  Between 

1988 and 1994, BHP Minerals held the ground and undertook soil sampling and further 

geophysics. Gold mineralisation at Bonikro was discovered by Equigold NL, following the 

acquisition of the property in 1996, by geochemical soil sampling over the Oumé permit.  

The gold-in-soil anomaly was subsequently drilled, culminating in resource estimation and 

pit optimization studies. Lihir acquired the project in June 2008, through a merger with 

Equigold NL.   Equigold Mines CI SA holds an 85% interest in the Bonikro Gold Project, 

with 5% held by minority shareholders and 10% held by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire 

(Lihir Website, 2008). 

The Oumé permit is underlain by a NNE striking contact between Upper and Lower 

Birimian of the Oumé-Fetekro greenstone belt.  Drilling at Bonikro confirmed widespread 

gold mineralisation associated with quartz stockwork veining and increased sulphides in a 

relatively undeformed granodiorite. 

The author has not verified the information pertaining to the Bonikro Gold Mine and this 

information is not indicative of the mineralisation on the Agbaou permit.  There is no 

significant mining activity on any other surrounding properties and therefore have no 

material impact on the Agbaou permit.

17.1 Introduc tion 

Coffey Mining has estimated the Mineral Resource for the Agbaou Gold Project as at 

21st of February 2008.  All grade estimation was completed using Multiple Indicator Kriging 

('MIK') and Ordinary Kriging (OK) for gold.  This estimation approach was considered 

appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of 

available data, the interpreted controls on mineralisation, and the style of mineralisation.  

The estimation was constrained with geological and mineralisation interpretations. 

17.2 Databas e Validation 

The resource estimation was based on the available exploration drillhole database which 

was compiled by Coffey Mining in MS Access.  The database has been reviewed and 

validated by Coffey Mining prior to commencing the resource estimation study. 

Data included RC and diamond drilling sample data for use in the modelling process. 

The database was validated in Micromine software and the checks made to the database 

prior to loading into Surpac and Vulcan included:- 

 No overlapping intervals. 

 Downhole surveys at 0m depth and also at the end of hole. 

 Consistency of depths between different data tables. 

 Check gaps in the data. 

 Changes that were made to the database prior to loading into Surpac included:- 

 Replacing less than detection samples with half detection. 

 Replacing intervals with no sample with -999. 

 Replacing intervals with assays not yet received with -999. 

The resource dataset has been described in Section 12.  In summary, samples were 

composited to 2m down-hole lengths with residual intervals less than 0.6m length being 

discarded.  The resulting file contained 4,634 composites with gold grades within 

mineralised domains.  A total of 351 RC and diamond drillholes were used in the resource 

modelling study.

17.3 G eologic al Interpretation and Modelling 

Based on grade information and geological observations, oxidation and mineralised domain 

boundaries have been interpreted and wireframes modelled to constrain resource 

estimation for the Agbaou deposit. 

Interpretation and digitising of all constraining boundaries has been undertaken on cross 

sections orientated at 300º (drill line orientation).  The resultant digitised boundaries have 

been used to construct wireframe surfaces or solids defining the three-dimensional 

geometry of each interpreted feature.  The interpretation and wireframe models have been 

developed using the Surpac mine planning software package. 

17.3.1 Mineralis ation Interpretation 

For the purpose of resource estimation, 11 mineralised domains including two thin, 

horizontally orientated lateritised domains were interpreted and were modelled on a lower 

cutoff grade of 0.3g/t Au.  The domains are numbered 1 to 6 (Agbaou Main), 7 (Agbaou 

Main Laterite), 8 and 9 (Agbaou South), 10 (Agbaou South Laterite and 11 (Agbaou West) 

and are depicted in Figure 17.3-1 and Figure 17.3-2.

17.3.2 Weathering Interpretation 

Composites were also coded by the weathering profile.  The profile has been modelled 

from drill data and comprises of saprolite, transition material and fresh units.  Weathering 

surfaces generally parallel the topographical profile, although weathering can be deeper 

within zones of mineralisation.  On some sections the intermixing of the weathering types 

can be quite complicated.  Figure 17.3-3 is an example section (at 19,920mN, local grid) 

showing the distribution of weathering types (saprolite, transition and fresh rock) and the 

interpreted position of the top of fresh rock.  Also depicted are Domains 1 to 5 (from left to 

right) and laterite Domain 7 (horizontal, surface).

17.4 S tatis tic al Analys is  

The lengths of the samples were statistically assessed prior to selecting an appropriate 

composite length for undertaking statistical analyses, variography and grade estimation.  

Summary statistics of the sample length indicates that 12.1% of the samples were collected 

at intervals <1m, 33.7% of the samples were collected at 1m intervals, 23.3% of the 

samples were collected at intervals >1m and <2m, 30.3% was collected at 2m intervals and 

the remainder (0.6%) was sampled at irregular intervals greater than 2m.  Statistical 

analysis was therefore undertaken based on 2m composites of the gold assay data for the 

resource dataset drilling completed at Agbaou.  All composites inside and outside the 

wireframes were flagged as separate domains.  A total of 4,634 composites within the 

wireframes were used in the modelling process from a total of 351RC and diamond 

drillholes. 

Summary statistics were generated for 2m composite and 1m re-assayed Goldivoire data 

as Goldivoire initially sampled on a 2m basis and subsequently re-sampled 1m composites.  

All assays were considered.  These are presented in Table 17.4-1.  Statistics are presented 

for the 2m composites and all 1m resplits.  The means of two types of sampling are 

equivalent.

Composites of <0.6m length (residuals) were statistically analysed on a domain by domain 

basis prior to exclusion from the dataset.  These composites were found to have had a 

negligible effect on the mean of the data (no difference to two decimal places) and were 

therefore excluded. 

Separate statistics were generated for each domain.  The data was further subdivided, and 

flagged, into sub-domains based on weathering profile.  Summary statistics for each 

modelled domain are presented in Table 17.4-2.

Populations of gold grades are close to lognormal and show strong positive skewness for 

all domains and this is typical of many gold deposits.  The coefficient of variation ('CV') of 

all primary domains is moderate to high indicating that it may be difficult to maintain a high 

degree of selectivity in mining. 

An outlier analysis outlined the need for high grade cuts to be applied.  The requirement for 

high grade cuts was assessed via a number of steps.  The steps completed as part of this 

assessment are:- 

 Review of composite data via histograms and probability plots to identify outliers to the 

data. 

 Review plots comparing contribution of the highest grade composites to the mean and 

variance of the dataset. 

 Visually assess clustering of high grade composites (clustering of high grade intercepts 

indicate that the extreme values are real and that high grade cutting should be less 

severe).

17.5 V ariography 

17.5.1 Introduc tion 

Variography is used to describe the spatial variability or correlation of an attribute (gold, 

silver etc).  The spatial variability is traditionally measured by means of a variogram, which 

is generated by determining the averaged squared difference of data points at a nominated 

distance (h), or lag (Srivastava and Isaacs, 1989).  The averaged squared difference 

(variogram or γ(h)) for each lag distance is plotted on a bivariate plot, where the X-axis is 

the lag distance and the Y-axis represents the average squared differences (γ(h)) for the 

nominated lag distance. 

Several types of variogram calculations are employed to determine the directions of the 

continuity of the mineralisation:- 

 Traditional variograms are calculated from the raw assay values. 

 Log-transformed variography involves a logarithmic transformation of the assay data. 

 Gaussian variograms are based on the results after declustering and a transformation 

to a Normal distribution. 

 Pairwise-relative variograms attempt to 'normalise' the variogram by dividing the 

variogram value for each pair by their squared mean value.

Agbaou Gold Mine 
Ref: 1024/KG/000 

Page 52 

 Correlograms are 'standardized' by the variance calculated from the sample values that 

contribute to each lag. 

Fan variography involves the graphical representation of spatial trends by calculating a 

range of variograms in a selected plane and contouring the variogram values.  The result is 

a contour map of the grade continuity within the domain. 

The variography was calculated and modelled in the geostatistical software, Isatis.  The 

rotations are tabulated as input into Isatis (geological convention), with X representing 

rotation around Z axis, Y representing rotation around Y` axis and Z representing rotation 

around X``.  Dip and dip direction of major, semi-major and minor axes of continuity are 

also referred to in the text.  Modelled correlograms were generally shown to have good 

structure and were used throughout. 

17.6 Agbaou Depos it V ariography 

Grade and indicator variography was generated to enable grade estimation via MIK and 

change of support analysis to be completed.  Six indicator thresholds were investigated for 

each domain grouping.  Interpreted anisotropy directions correspond well with the modelled 

geology and overall geometry of the interpreted Domains.   

17.6.1 Domain G roup 1 &  3 

Grade variography shows good structure and displays moderate anisotropy between the 

major and semi-major axes and strong anisotropy between the major and minor axes.  Two 

spherical models have been fitted to the experimental correlogram, with the correlogram 

exhibiting a moderate relative nugget effect (calculated by dividing the nugget variance by 

the sill variance) of 35%.  The short-range structure, which has been modelled with ranges 

of 1000m, 40m and 6m for the major, semi-major and minor axis respectively, accounts for 

half of the non-nugget variance.  The overall ranges fitted to the correlogram are 140m, 

90m and 11m for the major, semi-major, and minor axis respectively. 

The interpreted major direction of continuity dips at 50º towards 135º.  Modelled indicator 

correlograms display a range of relative nugget values from 38% to 58% and this is broadly 

comparable with the grade variogram nugget of 35%.  Table 17.6-1 presents the fitted 

grade and indicator variogram models for Domain Group 1 & 3.

17.6.2 Domain G roup 2, 4, 5, &  6 

Grade variography shows good structure and displays low to moderate anisotropy between 

the major and semi-major axes and strong anisotropy between the major and minor axes.  

Two spherical models have been fitted to the experimental correlogram, with the 

correlogram exhibiting a moderate to high relative nugget effect of 38%.  The spherical 

model has been fitted with minor ranges of 40m, 20m and 5m.  A second exponential 

model has been fitted with overall ranges of 85m, 60m and 12m for the major, semi-major 

and minor axis respectively.  The short range structure accounts for two thirds of the non 

nugget variance. 

The interpreted major direction of continuity dips at 50º towards 130º. 

Modelled indicator correlograms display a range of relative nugget values from 36% to 53% 

and this is broadly comparable with the grade variogram nugget of 35%.  Table 17.6-2 

presents the fitted grade and indicator variogram models for Domain Group 2, 4 5 & 6.

17.6.3 Domain G roup 8, 9, &  11 

Grade and indicator variography for this domain grouping shows poor structure and 

therefore is assumed from data from Domain 9 only.  Grade variography for this Domain 

shows good structure and displays low to moderate anisotropy between the major and 

semi-major axes and strong anisotropy between the major and minor axes.  Two spherical 

models have been fitted to the experimental correlogram, with the correlogram exhibiting a 

moderate relative nugget effect of 35%.  The spherical model has been fitted with minor 

ranges of 40m, 20m and 5m.  A second exponential model has been fitted with overall 

ranges of 85m, 60m and 12m for the major, semi-major and minor axis respectively.  The 

short range structure accounts for two thirds of the non nugget variance. 

The interpreted major direction of continuity dips at 50º towards 130º. 

Modelled indicator correlograms display a range of relative nugget values from 36% to 53% 

and this is broadly comparable with the grade variogram nugget of 35%.  Table 17.6-3 

presents the fitted grade and indicator variogram models for Domain 9.

Grade variography for this Domain Group shows good structure and displays isotropy 

between the major and semi-major axes and strong anisotropy between the major and 

minor axes.  Two spherical models have been fitted to the experimental correlogram, with 

the correlogram exhibiting a moderate relative nugget effect of 37%.  The spherical model 

has been fitted with minor ranges of 50m, 50m and 10m.  A second exponential model has 

been fitted with overall ranges of 120m, 120m and 15m for the major, semi-major and

17.7 B lock Modelling 

17.7.1 Introduc tion 

A three-dimensional block model was constructed in Surpac software for the Agbaou 

deposit, covering all the interpreted mineralisation zones and including suitable additional 

waste material to allow later pit optimisation studies. 

17.7.2 B lock C ons truc tion P arameters  

A sub-block model was used to construct the Agbaou mineralisation and background 

models (Table 17.7-1).  Block coding was completed on the basis of the block centroid, 

wherein a centroid falling within any wireframe was coded with the wireframe solid attribute.  

The block model was rotated to 035º to adequately represent the overall strike direction of 

mineralisation.

The parent block size was selected on the basis of the average drill spacing 

(approximately 40m section spacing) and the variogram models, which indicate estimation 

of blocks smaller than the data spacing is not practical.  A parent block size of 20mE x 

40mN x 10mRL was selected as appropriate.  Regular sub-blocking to a 5mE x 10mN x 

2.5mRL size was completed to ensure adequate volume representation. 

The attributes coded into the block models included the weathering and mineralisation 

models.  A visual review of the wireframe solids and the block model indicates robust 

flagging of the block model. 

Bulk density has been coded to the block model based on the weathering profile.  The 

average bulk density for each subdivision, as presented in Table 17.7-2, was coded via a 

block model script.  A description of the density measurement methodology can be found in 

Section 19.9.3.

17.8 G rade E s timation 

17.8.1 Introduc tion 

Resource estimation for the Agbaou mineralisation was completed using MIK within 

Primary Domains.  Laterite Domains were estimated via Ordinary Kriging.  Ordinary 

Kriging, Inverse Distance Squared and Nearest Neighbour estimates were also completed 

within the primary domains to allow comparison with the post processed Etype mean. 

Grade estimation was carried out using the Vulcan implementation of the GSLIB kriging 

algorithms.  To enable this, the block model described in the previous section was 

converted from Surpac to Vulcan format.  Calculation of selective mining unit estimates was 

undertaken using the Coffey Mining developed scripts.  The resultant Vulcan model was 

then imported back into Surpac with the associated necessary block values.  A description 

of the MIK estimation methodology is provided in Section 17.8.2. 

17.8.2 T he Multiple Indic ator K riging Method 

The MIK technique is implemented by completing a series of Ordinary Kriging ("OK") 

estimates of binary transformed data.  A composite sample, which is equal to or above a 

nominated cutoff or threshold, is assigned a value of 1, with those below the nominated 

indicator threshold being assigned a value of 0.  The indicator estimates, with a range 

between 0 and 1, represent the probability the point will exceed the indicator cutoff grade.  

The probability of the points exceeding a cutoff can also be considered broadly equivalent 

to the proportion of a nominated block that will exceed the nominated cutoff grade. 

The estimation of a complete series of indicator cutoffs allows the reconstitution of the local 

histogram or conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for the estimated point.  

Based on the ccdf, local or block properties, such as the block mean and proportion 

(tonnes) above or below a nominated cutoff grade can be investigated. 

Post MIK Processing - E-Type Estimates 

The E-type estimate provides an estimate for the grade of the total block or bulk-mining 

scenario.  This is achieved by discretising the calculated ccdf for each block into a

Page 58 

nominated number of intervals and interpolating between the given points with a selected 

function (e.g.: the linear, power or hyperbolic model) or by applying intra-class mean 

grades.  The sum of all these weighted interpolated points or mean grades enables an 

average whole block grade to be determined. 

The following example shows the determination of an E-Type estimate for a block 

containing three indicator cutoffs. 

The indicator cutoffs and associated probabilities calculated are:- 

Indicator Cutoff Grade Aug/t 
Indicator Probability 

(cumulative) 

minimum grade * 0 0.00 ** 
indicator 1 1 0.40 
indicator 2 2 0.65 
indicator 3 3 0.85 

maximum grade * 4 1.00 ** 
Note : *   Cutoff grades determined by the user. 

**  Indicator probability is assumed at the minimum and maximum cutoff. 

 
The whole block grade can now be determined in this block with the following parameters 

used for the purposes of the interpolation:- 

Number of discretisation intervals:      4. 

Linear extrapolation between all points (median grade between nominated cutoffs). 

The worked example is then calculated with the following steps:- 

 Interval 1 (0-1g/t Au)median grade x probability/proportion attributed to the interval 

(0.5g/t Au x 0.40 = 0.200). 

 Interval 2 (1 - 2g/t Au) median grade x proportion (1.5g/t Au x 0.25 = 0.375). 

 Interval 3 (2 - 3g/t Au) median grade x proportion (2.5g/t Au x 0.20 = 0.500). 

 Interval 4 (3 - 4g/t Au) median grade x proportion (3.5g/t Au x 0.15 = 0.525). 

 Calculate total gradeaverage all calculated intervals ((0.2+0.375+0.500+0.525)/1) = 

1.60g/t Au. 

It is also possible from this example to calculate the proportion and grade above a 

nominated cutoff (e.g. 2g/t - at sample support or complete selectivity).  The following steps 

would be undertaken to calculate the tonnes and grade at sample selectivity using a 2g/t 

cutoff:- 

 Interval 3 (2 - 3g/t Au) median grade x proportion (2.5g/t Au x 0.20 = 0.500). 

 Interval 4 (3 - 4g/t Au) median grade x proportion (3.5g/t Au x 0.15 = 0.525).

Ref: 1024/KG/000 

Page 59 

 Calculate total gradeaverage all calculated intervals ((0.500+0.525)/0.35) = 2.93g/t Au 

with 0.35% of the block above the cutoff. 

The effect of using a non-linear model to interpolate between cutoffs is to shift the grade 

weighting associated with that cutoff away from the median.  For Agbaou, the intra-class 

means based on the cut composite data have been used to reconstitute the ccdf and 

produce block statistics. 

It is noted, however, that the calculation of the E-type estimate and complete selectivity 

often does not allow mine planning to the level of selectivity which is proposed for 

production.  To achieve an estimate which reflects the levels of mining selectivity 

envisaged, a selective mining unit ("SMU") correction is often applied to the calculated ccdf. 

Support Correction (Selective Mining Unit Estimation) 

A range of techniques are known to produce a support correction and therefore allow for 

selective mining unit emulation.  The common features of the support correction are:- 

 Maintenance of the mean grade of the histogram (E-type mean). 

 Adjustment of the histogram variance by a variance adjustment factor (f ). 

The variance adjustment factor, used to reduce the histogram or ccdf variance, can be 

calculated using the variogram model.  The variance adjustment factor is often modified to 

account for the likely grade control approach or 'information effect'. 

In simplest terms, the variance adjustment factor takes into account the known relationship 

derived from the dispersion variance. 

Total variance = variance of samples within blocks + variance between blocks. 

The variance adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of the variance between the blocks 

and the variance of the samples within the blocks, with a small ratio (e.g. 0.10) indicating a 

large adjustment of the ccdf variance and large ratio (e.g. 0.80) representing a small shift in 

the ccdf. 

Two simple support corrections that are available include the Affine and Indirect Lognormal 

correction, which are both based on the permanence of distribution.  The discrete gaussian 

model is often applied to global change of support studies and has been generated on the 

composite dataset as a comparison.  The indirect lognormal correction was applied to the 

Agbaou MIK grade estimates.

Page 60 

 
Indirect Lognormal Correction 

The indirect lognormal correction can be implemented by adjusting the quantiles (indicator

the statistical characteristics of the block volume of interest. 

This is implemented with the following formula:- 

q' = a x qb 
q = quantile of distribution. 
q' = quantile of the variance-reduced distribution. 

 
where the coefficients a and b, are given by the following formula:-

f  = variance adjustment factor. 
CV = coefficient of variation. 

 

At the completion of the quantile adjustments, grades and tonnages (probabilities are then 

considered a pseudo tonnage proportion of the blocks) at a nominated cutoff grade can be 

calculated using the methodology described above (E-type).  The indirect lognormal 

correction, as applied to the Agbaou deposit, is the best suited of the common adjustments 

applied to MIK to produce selective mining estimates for positively skewed distributions.

MIK estimates were completed for relevant domains using the indicator correlogram 

models (Section 17.6), and a set of ancillary parameters controlling the source and 

selection of composite data.  The sample search parameters were defined based on the 

variography and the data spacing, and a series of sample search tests performed in Isatis 

geostatistical software.  A total of 16 indicator thresholds were estimated for all Domain 

Groupings (Table 17.4-5).

The sample search parameters are provided in Table 17.9-1.  Soft boundaries were used in 

the estimation pass 1 for primary mineralisation domains which, for example, allows 

samples lying within laterite Domain 6 to be used for the estimation of Domain1.  This 

approach was applied to first pass estimations for the primary mineralisation domains, as 

grades within the top part of these domains were deemed to have a strong relationship with 

grades within the overlying laterite domain.  For successive estimation passes, hard 

boundaries were which does not allow samples lying within any Domain to be used for the 

estimation of any other domain.  This strategy allows adequate estimation in areas where 

the two estimation domains are adjacent to each other.  A three-pass estimation strategy 

was applied to each domain, applying progressively expanded and less restrictive sample 

searches to successive estimation passes, and only considering blocks not previously 

assigned an estimate. 

All relevant statistical information was recorded to enable validation and review of the MIK 

estimates.  The recorded information included:- 

 Number of samples used per block estimate. 

 Average distance to samples per block estimate. 

 Estimation flag to determine in which estimation pass a block was estimated. 

 Number of drillholes from which composite data were used to complete the block 

estimate. 

The MIK estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The 

review included the following activities:- 

 Comparison of the E-type estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset, including 

weighting where appropriate to account for data clustering. 

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans.

Alternative estimates were also completed to test the sensitivity of the reported model to 

the selected MIK interpolation parameters.  An insignificant amount of variation in overall 

grade was noted in the alternate estimations. 

Applying the modelled variography, variance adjustment factors were calculated to emulate 

a 5mE x 10mN x 5mRL selective mining unit ("SMU") via the indirect lognormal change of 

support.  The intra-class composite mean grades (Table 17.4-2) were used in calculating 

the whole block and SMU grades.  The change of support study also included the 

calculation of the theoretical global change of support via the discrete Gaussian change of 

support model. 

An 'information effect' factor is commonly applied to the originally derived panel-to-block 

variance ratios to determine the final variance adjustment ratio.  The goal of incorporating 

information effect is to calculate results taking into account that mining takes place based 

on grade control information.  There will still be a quantifiable error associated with this data 

and it is this error we want to incorporate.  This is achieved in practice by running a test 

kriging estimation of an SMU using grade control data (the results required to incorporate

this option in the change of support do not depend on the assay data so the grade control 

data can be hypothetical).  The incorporation of the information effect is commonly found to 

be negligible, however can have a significant effect in some cases.  In this case, the 

information effect factor has not been applied.

18 MINING  AND R E S E R VE S  

18.1 Mining Approac h 

Mining is planned to be undertaken by a conventional open pit method of drill and blast 

followed by load and haul.   

Drilling and blasting will be performed on 5m high benches, with blasted material excavated 

in two discrete flitches, each nominally of 2.5m height.  With a large proportion of the 

material being saprolite, it was estimated that approximately 55% of the total material will 

require blasting. 

The use of RC drilling, assays every 2.5m sample and interpretation of the results by mine 

geologists is the primary method of grade control envisaged for the Project.  Further 

investigation is warranted with regards to optimising sample length and sample pattern to 

ensure appropriate statistical methodologies can be utilised to minimise dilution and 

maximise ore extraction. 

A notional drilling pattern of 10m x 8m was adopted for the study, with 120% of the 

expected ore zones assumed to be grade control drilled, to ensure sufficient overlap into 

adjacent low grade or waste such that ore is not missed.  All RC holes are assumed to be 

drilled at a 50º angle. 

The main mine production equipment that has been selected for the Project includes 120t 

back-hoe excavators, 90t capacity off-highway haul trucks and appropriately sized ancillary 

equipment. 

18.2 G eotechnical Input 

All pit geotechnical work for the Study was completed by Golder Associates Inc (Golder) 

and their work has been summarised in the report 'Pit Slope Design Recommendations 

Agbaou Project, Ivory Coast' dated April 2008. 

No geological or structural / geotechnical models were developed and no geohydrological 

models were available and, as such, the geotechnical recommendations are considered 

preliminary.  Golder states that their geotechnical slope recommendations will need to be 

reviewed once this data becomes available. 

Nevertheless, Golder informed that the pit slope stability will be controlled by a combination 

of material properties, geological structures and operating practices.  The critical slope 

failures for saprolite will be more likely in circular modes than block failures along foliation.  

The stability of the saprolite slopes will be very sensitive to groundwater and the slope

Page 68 

design parameters for saprolite assumed that the pit walls will be de-pressurised prior to 

excavation.  In addition, the management of surface water control will be important to 

minimise erosion and water infiltration. 

Golder recommended an overall pit wall slope angle of between 300 and 450 for saprolite, 

dependent on slope height. 

The bedrock appears to be competent and relatively steep slopes should be able to be 

developed, however, the slope stability for bedrock will be dependent on the amount of 

foliation present in the rock. 

Golder proposed the use of inter-ramp pit wall slope angle of between 450 and 550 for 

fresh rock. 

18.3 Hydrogeology inves tigation 

The main water strike in the project area is encountered at a depth of about 80 m at the 

contact zone of the saprock and bedrock. From airlift (blow) yields and experience of 

similar hydrogeological conditions, the sustainable yield is estimated at 10 l/s while, the 

hydraulic parameters, particularly the transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity and storativity 

values are estimated at 100 m2/d, 1 m/d and 1x10-3, respectively. These values could, 

however, be unrepresentative of the aquifer and it is highly recommended that aquifer 

characterisation boreholes be drilled followed by aquifer testing for more accurate hydraulic 

parameter evaluations. 

Evaluation of the static water level shows that the groundwater elevation hardly follows the 

topography and flows in different directions within the project area depending on the 

topography and drainage patterns. The poor correlation between water level and 

topography suggests that the aquifer ranges between confined to unconfined. The pre-

mining water level conditions range from 0.8 to 80 mbgl, with a mean value of 30 m due to 

the size, orientation and connectivity of the faults through which water flows.  

At this stage the groundwater quality monitoring programme is being conducted to assess 

the pre-construction water chemistry that will serve as a baseline value against which future 

possible mining impacts on the environment can be compared. The surface water is 

expected to be sampled and analysed in the near future. The baseline groundwater quality 

is within the recommended limits of the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for 

human consumption. However, the pH value is slightly acidic with values as low as 5.5.

Agbaou Gold Mine 
Ref: 1024/KG/000 

Page 69 

The impact of dewatering on the environment has been assessed by utilising analytical 

methods but not numerical models. The information obtained from Etruscan geologists 

indicates that the open pits will reach a maximum depth of 175 to 200 m deep at the end of 

the life of mine. The analytical method indicates that a total dewatering rate of 90 l/s is 

required to keep the pits dry during the operational phase. It should be remembered, 

however, that the analytical method (This equation) is a simplified approach in estimating 

the drawdown that could result from the dewatering process. The result obtained should 

only be considered as a first screening value. For more accurate results, more 

characterisation boreholes should be drilled so that the aquifer is studied using aquifer 

testing. As it is almost impossible to estimate the groundwater flow, especially in fractured 

aquifers using analytical methods, numerical modelling is highly recommended. The 

estimation of the natural groundwater recovery rate is assumed given the limited 

information available. Experience of similar hydrogeological conditions indicate that it may 

take about 50 years after the closure of the mine before the groundwater recovers to its 

initial state. 

The preliminary estimate of the hydrogeological conditions, indicates that the dewatering 

process can be conducted by installing submersible pumps in each of the 15 dewatering 

boreholes proposed for the site. Discharged water will initially be stored in a suitable dirty 

water reservoir and later, as the mine becomes operational, used in the process plant. The 

dewatering process from these boreholes is expected to commence on excavation of the 

open pit. During operation, potential plume migration of contaminants originating from the 

proposed TSF and WRD is estimated to be directed towards the open pits. This is in 

response to the dewatering process that changes the natural groundwater gradient. After 

mine closure and complete rebound, however, the potential contaminants are expected to 

migrate towards the natural groundwater flow direction. Nitrate impact was also estimated 

by considering the potential nitrate to generation from the WRD as a result of blasting and 

explosive residues. However, such estimations are best completed using the simulation of 

mass transport by numerical models. These potential contaminant plumes are expected to 

deplete considerably after closure of the mine and rehabilitation is expected to occur 

naturally with depletion of the contaminants due to dilution and attenuation. However, if the 

site is not rehabilitated through natural attenuation processes, a pump-and-treat technique 

should be considered for remediation purposes.  

Water level measurement is recommended monthly, while water quality monitoring should 

take place on a quarterly frequency so that any changes will be detected at an early stage. 

During post-closure, monitoring is recommended on a quarterly basis for the first year and 

then the frequency of monitoring is to be determined based on the trend of natural

rehabilitation. It is highly recommended that numerical modelling is updated bi-annually for 

the first year as no major hydrogeological conditions are expected to change within a six 

month period; thereafter annual updating is recommended. 

For further details refer to Knight Piesold hydrogeology report (report 5344/10/01 dated 

August 2008). 

18.4 Owner Mining C apital And Operating C os ts  

It was assumed that both the drill-and-blast and load-and-haul activities will be carried out 

based on an owner-mining scenario with Etruscan both owning and operating the mining 

equipment. 

For the purpose of the Study, numerous specialised contactors would be utilised to perform 

specific aspects of the mining work, thus reducing the risk of exposure for Etruscan. 

Requests for quotations (RFQ's) were obtained from the major suppliers capable of 

undertaking the work.  The most important of these are maintenance and repair contracts 

(MARC) of mining equipment, supply of fuel, lubricants, supply of explosives and 

management of earthmoving tyres. 

Mine cost modelling from first principles was carried out using a detailed spreadsheet 

based model developed by Coffey Mining.   

The mining cost model is primarily structured on the generation of equipment engine or 

service meter unit (SMU) hours that are associated with the adopted mine production 

schedule.   

The mining cost model summarises all mining costs by resources or inputs and by 

activities. 

A foreign exchange rate of 104Yen/US$ and 500CFA/US$ was used where applicable.

Mine Operating Costs 

Realistic and achievable equipment performance in terms of productivity, mechanical 

availability, utilisation and cost have been determined from experience at other similar 

operations, cost build-ups from first principles and input from equipment suppliers. 

Excavator productivity was estimated at approximately 1,000tph or 5.9Mtpa, based on 

5,400 direct operating hours per annum. 

A diesel fuel price of $0.96/l was obtained from Shell. 

A summary of the mining operating cost estimate broken down by resources is shown in

18.5 P it Optimis ation 

Pit optimisation studies have been undertaken using the resource model as developed by 

Coffey Mining as the basis for pit optimisation. 

The Whittle Four-X pit optimisation software package was used for this work.  The Whittle 

Four-X model development was carried out in Vulcan.  Whittle Four-X deals with the 

amount of metal in a block, not grade.  Knowing the tonnage and the metal in a block, 

Whittle Four-X can calculate the grade of a block.  To that end the incremental metal 

content of a block was calculated using the grade estimates derived from the MIK resource 

estimate.  The metal content of a block was calculated for the following incremental grade 

ranges:- 

  0.6g/t – 0.8g/t 

  0.8g/t – 1.0g/t 

  1.0g/t – 1.2g/t 

  >1.2g/t 

A mining dilution of 5% at 0.0g/t grade was added to the pit optimisation, whilst the mining 

recovery was set at 97%. 

The input parameters adopted for the pit optimisation cover a wide range of disciplines and 

as a result a number of specialists have been involved in determining these parameters.  

The principal input parameters used in the pit optimisation and the specialists responsible 

for determining these parameters are listed in Table 18.5-1below.  All references to 

monetary values are denominated in United States of America dollars, unless specifically 

stated otherwise.

A flat gold price of US$1,000/ounce Au was adopted for the pit optimisation work that was 

carried out for the Agbaou Gold Project. 

Miscellaneous mining costs such as mine supervision, grade control and dewatering were 

estimated by Coffey Mining based on their in-house cost database for a similar sized 

mining operation in West Africa. 

A summary of the principal costs associated with mining are shown in Table 18.5-2.

Grade control costs were based on a RC drilling rate of US$22 per meter and assaying 

cost of US$12 per assay.  Crusher feed costs were based on a unit rate of US$0.70/t of 

ore, assuming 40% re-handle and the balance being direct feed to the crusher. 

The processing costs that were determined for the Agbaou Gold Project were supplied by 

MDM and were estimated at US$12.07/t for saprolite mill feed and US$11.74/t of fresh mill 

feed.  The recoveries were supplied by MDM and were estimated at 90.7% for saprolite mill 

feed and 91.8% for fresh mill feed. 

The project general and administration costs were determined by MDM and Etruscan and 

were estimated at US$3.7 million per annum. 

A Côte d'Ivoire government royalty of 3% of revenue was included in the pit optimisation. 

The pit wall slope parameters determined for the Agbaou Gold Project were based on the 

geotechnical work undertaken by Golder.  The pit wall slope parameters were subdivided in 

a number of sectors representing the various potential structural trends that were identified.  

In summary, the overall slope angles adopted for the pit optimisation ranged from between 

30º for saprolite and 50º for fresh rock.

Table 18.5-4 displays the pit size in relationship to the gold price for the pit optimisation 

based on Indicated Resources only. 

The Whittle Four-X financial analysis was carried out using the following base assumptions 

and parameters:- 

  Mill throughput: 1.2Mtpa. 

  Mill limiting – i.e. sufficient waste is removed each period to enable the required 

milling rate to be maintained. 

  Discount rate – 10%. 

  Base case Au price - US$1,000/oz. 

Three cashflows were produced for each analysis:- 

  Undiscounted Operating Cashflow. 

  Best Case Discounted Operating Cashflow – Each incremental pit is removed prior to 

advancing to the next adjacent incremental pit.  The cashflow schedule is the 

equivalent of multiple pushbacks.

Page 77 

  Worst Case Discounted Operating Cashflow – Each bench is mined out prior to 

moving to the next bench, using the optimisation block height as the default bench 

height.  The cashflow schedule is the equivalent of top down 'flat' mining. 

An actual mining schedule will most likely lie between the two extremes of Worst Case and 

Best Case as described above. 

The cashflows, as described above, are exclusive of any capital expenditure or Project 

start-up costs and should be used for pit optimisation comparison purposes only.  No Net 

Present Value (NPV) can be derived from these cashflows. 

Pit Optimisation Results 

Based on Indicated Resources only and at a gold price of US$1,000/oz, the optimum pit 

shell, based on the maximum un-discounted cashflow, is pit shell 29.  Pit shell 29 contains 

some 11.3 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 2.15g/t Au, for approximately 707,000 ounces 

of recovered Au metal.  Some 81.1 million tonnes of waste are contained within the pit shell 

with a stripping ratio of 7.2:1.  The undiscounted operating cashflow, exclusive of capital 

and start up costs, is $311 million.  The Worst Case discounted cashflow is $185 million, 

whilst the Best Case discounted cashflow is US$217 million.  To ascertain the likely 

discounted cashflow derived from a realistic mine production schedule, the average 

discounted cashflow was calculated and is US$201 million.  The cash operating cost 

derived from the pit optimisation is US$561/oz. 

The detailed summary of the pit optimisation results from Coffey. 

18.6 Mine Des ign 

18.6.1 P it des ign 

The optimum pit shell as described in Section 18.5 was adopted as a guide for the detailed 

pit design work.  There are three separate pits that have been named North, South and 

West Pit. 

A 22m wide, dual access ramp was selected for the detailed mine design work, which 

allows for a safe operating width of 3 truck widths plus a windrow in the case of a 90t (e.g. 

Cat777, Komatsu HD785) sized dump truck. 

The designs were based on the Golder provided inter-ramp slope angles for Agbaou.  The 

inter ramp slope angles range from 30º to 55º, depending on material type and slope 

height.  The berm width is 8m for every 20m in vertical wall height in saprolite and 5m in 

fresh rock.

Page 78 

The ramp design parameters are listed below:- 

• Ramp width22m, reducing to 12m for the last 40 to 50m of vertical height. 

• Gradient10%. 

A minimum mining width of 30m has been assumed for both pits.  This width suits the 

backhoe excavator loading method and the Caterpillar 777 turning circle of 28.4m. 

North Pit is accessed from the southwest of the pit at 260mRL, using a dual lane ramp 

system.  It comprises two sections with the main section of the pit reaching 95mRL and the 

shallower northern prong reaching 190mRL.  The last 50m of the main section of the pit is 

accessed through a single lane ramp.  The highest section of the pit wall is in the northeast 

of the pit where the wall is approximately 190m high. 

South Pit is accessed from the north of the pit at 260mRL, using a dual lane ramp system.  

It reaches 145mRL or a depth of 115m.  The last 30m of the pit is accessed through a 

single lane ramp.  The highest section of the pit wall is the west wall, which is 

approximately 135m high. 

West Pit is accessed from the southeast of the pit at approximately 225mRL, using a single 

lane ramp system with passing bays.  It reaches 170mRL or a depth of 55m.  The highest 

section of the pit wall is the west wall, which is approximately 50m high. 

Pit staging was considered appropriate for the North pit only. 

Table 18.6-1 provides a summary of the material breakdown as contained within the final 

pit designs.  It is noted that pit designs contain a quantity of Inferred Resources at less than 

0.4Mt for approximately 19koz of insitu Au metal.

18.6.2 Was te dumps  

The waste dumps have been designed to Western Australian standards and the 

parameters used are:- 

  Face slope - 18º 

  Bench height - 20m – 30m 

  Berm width - 10m 

  Overall slope - 16º - 17º 

The waste dump capacities have been based on a swell factor of 25% for saprolite and 

30% for fresh rock.  No allowance for any in-pit or exhausted pit backfilling has been made. 

The waste dump positions have been determined by taking into account geologically 

prospective ground (where sterilisation drilling is still to be carried out), the existing 

drainage patterns, waste haulage profiles and the space and infrastructure issues required 

for the planned operations.

dump covers approximately 150Ha and has a capacity of 54Mm3, with ample capacity to 

extend the dump. 

Figure 18.6-1 shows the waste dump position. 

The waste mined during the pre-production period will be utilised to build the ROM pad and 

the TSF starter dam and other infrastructure items, such as haul roads, as required. 

18.6.3 Mine produc tion s c hedule 

The mine production schedule was based on the pit designs as described in 

Section 18.6.1.    A starter pit was developed for the North Pit only and a material 

breakdown of the starter pit and the final cutback are summarised in Table 18.6-2.

The scheduling periods adopted for the mine production schedule comprises of years, 

although pre-production has been estimated at 3 to 5 months. 

The mine production schedule was developed using Microsoft Excel. 

Scheduling was carried out on a bench by bench basis for all the pit designs, including the 

intermediate pit stage for North Pit. 

In consultation with Etruscan, the following constraints were set as a target for the mine 

production schedule:- 

  Nominal ore processing rate - 1.2Mtpa 

  Maximum total material movement - 12.0Mt 

  Vertical mining advance rate - 60m 

  Pre-production material requirements

19.1 S ummary 

Tests to determine the mineralogical, comminution, and metallurgical characteristics of the 

Agbaou ore body were carried out by Mintek of South Africa. Composite samples were 

subjected to gravity amenability tests, and the gravity tails were subjected to CIL 

amenability tests using bottle roll method.  

The aims of the testwork campaign were: 

 To establish the mineralogical composition of the different ore formations from the 

Agbaou ore body 

 To investigate the response of the different ore types to cyanidation 

 To investigate the response of the different ore types to gravity recovery 

 To establish optimum conditions of leaching in terms of cyanide consumption, oxygen 

uptake, lime consumption, leach time and grind. 

Results from these tests have been used as the basis for flow sheet development, process 

selection and forecast recoveries described in this report.  

Tests were done on drill core composite samples taken from the two ore bodies, Agbaou 

South and Agbaou North. Sample characterization on the two different ore bodies was 

based on the extent of oxidation of the ore. The ore varies from heavily oxidized near 

surface zones (the laterite zone, mottled zone, and the saprolite zone) through to the less 

oxidized transitional zone (the saprock zone) to the unoxidised fresh rock (the bed rock).  

Sample characterization is therefore based on the following composites, and this applies to 

both ore bodies, Agbaou North and Agbaou South: 

Saprolite: 

Saprolite composite consists of the oxidized upper layers of the mineralized zone consisted 

of mainly the following:  

Laterite :  A shallow (1 to 4 metres) surface cover 

Mottled Zone:  A shallow (2 to 10 metres) mixed ore type consisting of laterite and 
saprolite underlying the laterite 

Saprolite:  A deep (5 to 100 metres) highly weathered oxide ore underlying the 
mottled zone

Saprock:  An intermediate zone between saprolite and bedrock with increased

Bedrock:  

The bedrock composite consists of the unoxidised deeper layer of the mineralized zone, 

consisting of primary sulphides. 

Based on the characterization, four composite samples were made from drill core samples 

each of the ore bodies as in Table 19.1-1.

gravity tail with natural aeration. 

Gravity tails of both Saprolite composites (North and South) responded well to cyanidation 

at elevated oxygen and reduced solids concentration (35-40% w/w) in leach slurry.

19.1.2 S ummary of T es t P rocedures  

Sample Preparation 

From each of the two bulk drill core samples from each of the ore bodies (Agbaou South 

and Agbaou North) samples were taken and submitted for various analyses.  Each of the 

samples submitted for analysis was crushed to 100% passing 1.70mm, blended and split to 

obtain a representative sub sample. Each of the representative sub-samples would then be 

taken through the various stages of required tests. 

Grind Establishment 

Bond rod mill, ball mill, and abrasion indices were determined for Agbaou ore according to 

standard laboratory procedures. For details refer to Mintek tests report. 

Gravity Separation 

Samples from each ore characterisation were taken through gravity separation to evaluate 

the amenability of gold in these ores to physical gravity concentration. The following 

procedure was used: 

 Samples were milled to a typical grind representative of a cyclone underflow product of 

50% passing 75 µm 

 Batch gravity concentration were conducted using a Knelson centrifugal concentrator to 

establish gravity recovery 

 Redress the concentrate by hand panning to produce the final concentrate 

 Assay final concentrate, middling, and tail for gold

Preg-Robbing 

Leach tests were conducted on the combined tails and middlings from gravity recovery to 

establish the preg-robbing potential of the different ores. The following conditions were 

used: 

 Grind 70% passing 75 µm 

 Leach time 48hrs 

 Tailings assayed for gold 

 Carbon assays and final leach solution assayed for gold 

 Reagent consumption, CaO, and NaCN determined 

Grind Optimisation 

Grind optimisation tests were conducted on combined gravity and middlings material under 

the following conditions: 

 Grind of 60%, 70%, 80%, 70% passing 75 µm  

 Leach time 48hrs 

 Excess cyanide 

 Tailings gold assay 

 Reagent consumption

Leach Time Optimisation 

Leach time optimisation tests were conducted on the combined gravity tails and middlings 

from gravity recovery by bottle rolling. The following conditions were used: 

 Optimum grind of 70% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum cyanide consumption 

 Leach discrete samples at 2hrs, 4hrs, 8hrs, 16hrs, 24hrs, 36hrs and 48hrs 

 Tailings gold assay 

 Reagent consumption, CaO, and NaCN 

 Each of the samples was ground to P70=75µm then subjected to direct and carbon in 

leach (CIL) cyanidation.  

 Representative samples were taken from each sample to determine the head grade 

before bottle rolling  

 The ground ore slurry density was adjusted to 50% solids (decant) 

 The pH was measured, and lime was added to adjust the pH to 10.5 

 Cyanide was added to initial concentration of 0.100% cyanide in solution 

 Activated carbon was added to a concentration of 20g/l. 

 The ground samples were bottle rolled with cyanide under conditions of modified pH 

over a period of 48hrs.  

 Samples were taken at the following intervals: 2hrs, 4hrs, 8hrs, 16hrs, 24hrs, 36hrs and 

48hrs for determination of gold in solution and gold on carbon.  

Analytical 

Chemical analysis was carried out at the Mintek analytical facility in Johannesburg. The 

following analytical methods were employed: 

Gold in Solids: Fire Assay with AAS finish 

Gold in Solution: SX with AAS finish

Page 89 

Viscosity Determination Tests 

The Viscosity determinations were carried out on 600 ml samples of slurry containing 50% 

solids (by mass). Each slurry sample was placed in an 800 ml glass beaker and the 

viscosity determined using a Brookfield DV – 1 viscometer. The No.1 and 2 spindles were 

used at 100 rpm, and a maximum torque was aimed for. Weighed masses of dry, milled ore 

were added to set volumes of water to produce slurries containing 50% solids at a leaching 

pH level. 

Mineralogical Examination 

Representative portion of each sample is analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to obtain its 

bulk crystalline mineralogical assemblage. A Siemens D500 diffractometer was used, with 

a step size of 0.02º 2θ and a counting time of 1 second per step applied over a range of 5 

to 80º 2θ. The method makes use of the net intensity of the main peaks of the phases, and 

identification is based on the crystal structure of crystalline phases (i.e. not those that are 

amorphous to XRD), and occur in amounts more than ~3 to 4 mass %. 

A polished section of each sample was prepared for examination by optical microscopy. 

19.2 Mineralogy S ummary  

Mintek conducted mineralogical examination on composites from drill core samples from 

both the Agbaou North and South ore bodies. Saprolite (SAPR) and bedrock (BDRK) 

composite samples were made from each of the two Agbaou ore bodies, Agbaou South 

and Agbaou North. Each of these samples was tested for mineralogical composition by 

Mintek. Representative composites of saprolites and bedrock from the two ore bodies 

(Agbaou North and Agbaou South) were submitted for Head Analysis.  

Table 19.2-1 and Figure 19.2-1 summarise the XRD results showing the relative 

composition of the mineral in the ore samples.

19.2.1 B edroc k S amples  

XRD Analysis 

Table 19.2-1 above and Figure 19.2-1 below show that the two bedrock samples (BDRK) 

virtually have the same mineralogical composition. The samples comprise major quartz, 

albite and chlorite with minor mounts of mica and ankerite occurring. The South sample 

additionally contains traces of amphibole and talc. 

Optical Microscopy 

Base-metal sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite, which are not detectable by XRD) varying in 

size from <10 to about 160 µm (average ~40 µm) occur in the bedrock samples. These 

sulfides are very well liberated and have a liberation of >98 % by volume estimated (Figure 

19.2-2A). The small percentage of composite sulfide/gangue particles are mostly in the 

form of sulfide attachment to gangue (Figure 19.2-2B), but more rarely the sulfide may be 

locked in gangue grains (Figure 19.2-2C). 

No gold was observed as the grade is too low (1 to 4 g/t), but normally the gold would be 

associated with sulfide grains (fine grains or in solid solution), or occur liberated.

19.2.2 S aprolite S amples  

XRD Analysis 

The saprolite samples (SAPR) have a composition different to the bedrock samples, but 

these are similar in composition compared to each other. They contain major kaolinite and 

quartz, and minor amounts of a swelling clay (smectite) and goethite are also present. 

Sulfides are rare (<0.5 % estimated). 

Optical Microscopy 

Goethite grains are composited with quartz and/or clay and these composites have 

measured sizes ranging from <10 to 800 µm (Figure 19.2-2D). It is not known whether 

some or all of the goethite was derived from sulfides on weathering, but any gold present 

may be associated with goethite formed from pyrite if not occurring as liberated grains.

suitably sized rock samples were selected from each of the seven Agbaou samples sent for 

Bond Impact Testing. The test procedure was conducted on each of the 20 rock pieces 

from each individual sample, and the bond impact work index was determined for each of 

the rock pieces. The average Bond Impact Work Index for the sample was determined by 

calculating the average for the 20 rock pieces.

The JKTeck SAG/Autogenous Parameters and Auto-Abrasion  

Drop Weight Tests were conducted at Mintek according to the procedure specified by 

JKTech for analysis. The Drop Weight test generated the SAG/Autogenous Parameters as 

well as the Crusher Model Parameters for the four BDRK samples submitted for analysis, 

two from upper bedrock and the other two from the lower bedrock. 

The key parameters that are generated from the drop weight test results and that are used 

for comminution equipment design are SAG/Autogenous Mill Parameters A, b and ta. The 

parameters are obtained by applying the Energy input (Ecs) to a sample and determining 

the fraction of material passing 10% of the original size of sample, t10. Ecs is related to t10 

by the following relationship: t10 = A(1-e-bEcs). The Parameter ta is a measure of the low 

energy required in comminution. It is a measure of the energy required to break the 

material by abrasion. The parameter is related to t10 in the following way: ta = t10/10. 

The parameters A and b give an indication of the resistance of the sample to impact 

breakage. A comparison of the parameters to the values in the database of JKTech tested 

samples ranks the hardness of the material relative to the Database. A more important 

parameter is the parameter A*b. Parameter ta shows the abrasive tendency of the ore. A 

summary of the Autogenous Mill Parameters are given in Table 19.8-11.

Crusher Model Parameters 

For each of the four BDRK samples submitted for the Drop Weight testing, Crusher Model 

Parameters were determined. Specific energy input required to crush the material of given 

size to a specified product size. Tables 19.8-12 to 19.8-15 gives the amount of energy 

required to reduce a specific sized feed material to give a specified product size in terms of 

t10.

Relative Density Measurements 

As part of the JKTech procedure for SAG/ Autogenous Mill Parameter determination, the 

relative density of the different ore types must be determined to find the range of the 

densities as the mineralogy of the ore particles vary. There is a tendency in 

SAG/Autogenous Milling for material that is both high density and resistant to breakage to 

concentrate in the Mill Load and result in higher than expected power draw.  

From each of the samples from the two ore bodies (North and South) 30cm pieces of rock 

were selected for relative density measurement. Measurement was done first in air and 

then in water. Tables 19.8-16 to 19.8-19 show the relative densities of 30 rock pieces from 

each of the four bedrock samples.

South BDRK 16.48 14.98 15.69 0.75 

 

Bond Ball and Bond Rod Work indices show the following: 

 Agbaou Bed Rock falls in the medium to hard classification. 

 Material hardness show slight sensitivity to limiting screen size. This applies to both 

Agbaou North and Agbaou South. 

 The slight variation in Bond Work Indices with Limiting Screen size implies that there is 

a slight variation in homogeneity of the material. 

 The bond Impact energy ranges from 6.5 to 9.8kWhr/t, which falls in the medium 

crushability index material. 

A very important parameter obtainable from comminution work is the ratio between the 

Bond Ball and Bond Rod Work Indices, (BRWI: BBWI). Table 19.9-4 below gives a 

summary of the tests results for seven samples tested for BRWI and BBWI.

North BDRK 1.42 1.20 1.28 0.08 
South BDRK 1.56 1.27 1.42 0.11 

 

The BRWI: BBWI ratio gives a good indication of the amenability of the material to 

SAG/Autogenous Milling. Generally an ore can be treated by SAG/ Autogenous Milling if 

the BRWI: BBWI ratio is between 1.1 and 1.2. In this region, the material is neither too hard

Page 109 

nor too soft. Material with ratio larger than 1.25 indicate a potential critical size build up or 

top-end competency problem in the SAG/AG Mill. 

Results in Table 19.9-4 indicate that both Agbaou ores may not be amenable to 

SAG/Autogenous Milling. There are high chances of formation of critical sized material 

resulting in excessive scatting in the SAG mill. 

19.9.2 Uniaxial C ompres s ive S trength 

The Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) values shown in Table 19.8-10 vary from 86 to 

110MPa. Values below 100MPa indicate rocks with numerous bedding planes, intrusive 

alterations by secondary minerals, or are highly fractured or oxidized. Such material will not 

be suited for SAG/ AG milling because it will not form competent media in the mill. 

Generally material suitable for SAG/AG milling will have UCS in the range 100-150MPa. 

Table 19.8-10 shows that Agbaou ore lies at the lower limit of the material suitable for 

SAG/AG Milling. In this case SAG/AG milling will not be recommended. 

19.9.3 R elative Dens ity 

Tables 19.8-16 to 19.8-19 show the relative densities of 30 rock pieces taken from various 

Agbaou drill core bulk samples. Rock samples from different bedrock bulk samples show 

very little variation in relative density.  

Various particles from a bulk sample are tested for relative density to check significant 

variations in the relative density within the ore. If part of the mill feed is both heavier and 

more competent, it tends to concentrate in the mill load resulting in higher than expected 

mill power draw.  

Relative density results in Tables 19.8-16 to 19.8-19 show little variation in relative 

densities both within the same sample and within the ore body. It is therefore possible in 

terms of mill operations to blend any parts of the ore body for feed into the mill without 

chances of accumulation of heavier and harder material in the mill. 

19.9.4 J K T ech Drop Weight T es t R es ults  

To get an idea of the hardness of the ore, the results of the JKTech parameters are 

compared to the results in the JKTech database of tested materials. The samples are 

ranked in hardness according to their position in the database. Table 19.9-5 shows the 

rankings of the four Agbaou samples tested.

Summary of JKTech parameters in Table 19.9-5 indicates the following: 

 The JKTech parameters A*b show that all the four ore samples fall within medium to 

very hard material according to the JKTech ranking of tested ores Database. 

 The specific comminution energy parameters t10 indicate that the ores fall in the 

hardness range between the medium to very hard according the JKTech Database of 

tested ores.  

 The low energy comminution parameter, ta, rank the ores in the medium range of 

abrasiveness according to the data base of tested ores. 

19.10 R ec overy and Optimis ation T es ts  R es ults  

Recovery Tests were conducted on the samples from both Agbaou South and North Ore 

Bodies. Two drill core samples composites, Bedrock composite and Saprolite composite, 

were made from each of the two Ore Bodies, and these were sent to Mintek for Recovery 

Testwork.  The objective of the recovery tests was to investigate the amenability of the 

different type of ores to gravity concentration and hydrometallurgical extraction by direct 

cyanidation. Optimisation work was conducted to establish the optimum leaching conditions 

for the four different ore types.  All the recovery tests were conducted by Mintek at their 

Johannesburg Facilities.

19.10.1 G ravity R ec overy T es ts  

Gravity amenability tests were conducted on the four main Agbaou composite samples 

namely Agbaou South BDRK and SAPR and North BDRK and SAPR. Gravity tests were 

conducted using a Knelson Centrifugal Concentrator at a grind of 50% passing 75µm on 

BDRK sample. Gravity tests on the SAPR samples were conducted at finer grind that 50% 

passing 7575µm due to the in-situ fineness of the SAPR samples. SAPR samples were 

already 70% passing75µm after the initial crushing stage of sample preparation.  

The centrifugal concentrator produced a primary concentrate which was further cleaned by 

way of Hand-Picking to produce the final gravity concentrate. Gravity concentration tests 

results are shown in Tables 19.10-1 to 19.10-4 below.

Leach and adsorption tests looked at measuring the leach and adsorption kinetics of the 

different ores and identifying optimum leach and adsorption conditions for the respective 

ore types. The following tests were conducted to identify the conditions thereof: 

 Preg-Robbing Tests 

 Grind Optimisation Tests 

 Cyanide Addition Optimisation Tests 

 Leach Time Optimisation Tests, and 

 pH Optimisation Tests

Preg-Robbing Tests  

Duplicate samples of each ore type were leached with activated carbon at 20g/l carbon and 

in the absence of carbon for 24hrs, all the other conditions necessary for leaching being 

similar in both cases. The dissolution is determined by assaying the solution, the carbon 

and the residual solids for gold at the end of the 24hr leach period.  

The difference in calculated dissolution between the two tests gives an indication of the 

preg-robbing tendency of the ore type. If the ore is preg-robbing the sample treated under 

CIL conditions will have a much higher dissolution than the one leached in the absence of 

carbon. Two sets of tests were conducted, one on the combined composite from each of

Grind Optimisation Tests 

To establish the optimum grind, bottle leach tests were conducted on samples of each four 

different ore type at different grinds while all the other conditions were maintained the 

same. Samples from each of the four different ore types were bottle roll leached at grinds of 

60%, 70%, 80% and 90% passing 75µm for 48hrs with all other conditions maintained the 

same. Grind tests were conducted on whole orebody samples from different ore 

characterisations as well as on Saprolite gravity tails. Tables 19.10-9 and 19.10-10 below 

show the results of grind optimisation tests.

Cyanide Optimisation Tests 

Boll roll leach tests were carried out on gravity tails of all the four main ore types at varying 

cyanide addition rates to establish the optimum cyanide addition rate for the different ore 

types. Tests were conducted at a grind of 70% passing 75µm. Table 19.10-11 below shows

pH Optimisation Tests Results 

Bottle roll leach tests were conducted to establish the optimum pH conditions for the 

different ore types. Milled samples were bottled rolled at varying conditions of pH while the 

other conditions were maintained similar. pH was varied by varying the addition rate of 

lime. The actual pH was recorded for each test. Table 19.10-13 below shows the variation 

of dissolution with slurry pH.

Gravity 

All four samples responded very well to gravity recovery using a centrifugal concentrator 

and final redress by handpicking to produce the final concentrate. 

 Test gravity recoveries ranged from 20% to 31.4% of feed gold recovered into the final 

gravity concentrate 

 Final concentrate mass yield of between 0.1 and 0.3% of the feed were achieved  

 Gold grades ranged between 100 and 400g/t in the final concentrate

Leach Optimisation Tests 

The results of the leach and the various optimisation tests with results tabulated earlier, the 

following can be drawn: 

• The oxygen demand test results show normal oxygen consumption for all the four types of 

ores (Table 19.10-5). 

• Both Saprolite samples indicated high viscosity levels in slurry at 50% solids (Table 19.10-6). 

Bed Rock samples showed much lower viscosity in slurry at 50% solids. This is due to the 

mineralogical differences due to the difference in the extent of oxidation in the Saprolites and 

the Bed Rock. The high viscosity impacts negatively on the rate of oxygen transfer in slurry 

to the reaction sites, hence reduce the leach kinetics 

• Preg-robbing test results show that all the Agbaou ores have serious preg-robbing 

properties. Tables 19.10-7 and 19.10-8 show results of preg-robbing testwork. Note that in 

Tables 19.10-7 and 19.10-8, results have been adjusted to 100% accountability to get 

meaningful trends comparison of results. From the results it is recommended that all 

leaching be done in the presence of carbon.  

• High viscosity in Saprolites also impacts negatively to the diffusion processes that play a 

large part in the CIL process. In general high viscosity shown by Saprolites results in 

reduced leach kinetics in Saprolites compared to Bed Rock.  

Grind Optimisation 

Table 19.10-9 shows the effect of grind on the gold dissolution for the four samples from 

Agbaou. The effects of grind on CIL recovery were combined with the associated costs of 

grinding, and reagents (cyanide and lime) to locate optimum grind at nominal goal price of 

$1000/Oz. Figures 19.11-1 to 19.11-3 show the variation of "Net Revenue" for taking into 

account only the milling costs of power, and grinding media with change in grind.

Page 122 

 
Note: This analysis is based on milling costs of energy and grinding media as well 
as cyanide and lime costs as these are directly affected by changes in grind. 

From Figures 19.11-1 and 19.11-3 the following can be concluded: 

 Optimum grind for North BDRK whole ore is 80% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum grind for South BDRK whole ore is 60% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum grind for South SAPR whole ore is 80% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum grind for North SAPR whole ore is above 90% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum grind for South SAPR gravity tail is 80% passing 75 µm 

 Optimum grind for North SAPR gravity tail is 70% passing 75 µm 

 Grind optimisation tests indicate that good leaching can be achieved at grinds as low as 

60% passing 75 µm in South BDRK (whole ore), and 80% passing 75 µm in North 

BDRK (whole ore). This indicates high porosity and absence of coarse gravity gold in 

BDRK. 

  The low optimum grind (70% passing 75 µm) for North SAPR gravity tail sample 

indicates high porosity of the sample. In contrast North SAPR whole ore sample has a 

very high optimum grind (>90% passing 75 µm). This indicates the presence of coarse 

gravity gold in North SAPR. 

 South SAPR gravity tail has the highest optimum grind of 80% passing 75 µm, both for 

whole ore and gravity tail. This indicates that this ore body is relatively less porous than 

the rest of deposit. 

Leach Time Optimisation 

Leach time optimisation test results showed a somehow unexpected result. The Bed Rock 

apparently leached much faster than the Saprolites despite the extensive oxidation of the 

Saprolites. The two Bedrock samples achieved at least 90% dissolution in 24hrs leaching 

time. On the contrary the two Saprolites trailed below 90% dissolution after 24hrs leaching. 

Figure 19.11-4 below shows the dissolution trends with time for the four Agbaou samples. 

Figure 19.11-4Leach time optimisation – dissolution trends 

 
Because of the poor leach kinetics shown by the Saprolite samples, it was decided to run 

another set of confirmatory tests on Saprolites only to check the following:

 If reducing pulp solids concentration of the leach slurry would improve the leach 

kinetics in Saprolites.  

 If leaching at elevated oxygen levels would improve the leach kinetics in Saprolites. 

The results of the confirmatory tests are shown on Table 19.11-1 below: leaching was done 

over 24hrs, and the dissolution was measured only at the end of leaching.

Figure 19.11-6Effect of Oxygen and Pulp Density 

 

Figure 19.11-5 shows the general effect of oxygen and pulp density on the leach kinetics. 

The following can be drawn from Figure 19.11-5: 

 Leach kinetics increased significantly in both SAPR by reducing solids concentration in 

the leach slurry from 50% to 40% and 35% solids.

 Leaching SAPR at elevated oxygen levels and reduced slurry further improved the 

leach kinetics. CIL dissolution for Both North and South SAPR increased from early 

80% in 24hrs at 50% solids and natural oxygen to more than 92% in 24hrs at 35% 

solids and elevated oxygen.  

Cost benefit analysis was conducted on use of oxygen to improve CIL recoveries on SAPR.  

Figure 19.11-6 shows the net CIL net revenue for different leaching conditions. In both 

North and South SAPR, use of oxygen is economically justifiable. 

Reagents Optimisation 

In this section analysis of lime and cyanide addition rates is done to determine the optimum 

addition rates. This is achieved by comparing the revenue from the recovered gold and the 

costs in cyanide and lime respectively required to achieve the respective gold recoveries. 

Cyanide Addition Optimisation 

Figure 19.11-7 below shows the variation of difference between revenue ($/t) and cyanide 

cost for the various cyanide addition rates to the gravity tails of the four samples.

Figure 19.11-8Agbaou South Cyanide Optimization (@ Gold $1000/Oz, Cyanide $1896/t) 
 

Testwork results indicate the following optimum cyanide addition rates as shown in Figures 

19.11-7 & 19.11-8: 

Optimum cyanide addition for both North BDRK and North SAPR is at most 0.3 kg/t 

Optimum cyanide addition for both South BDRK and South SAPR is 0.5kg/t

All the graphs of recovery with pH show a reduction in CIL dissolution with increase in Ph, 

consistent with the principles of chemical equilibrium. Gold leaching reaction produces OH- 

ions and the presence of acid would assist the leaching of gold by removing the OH-. On 

the other hand cyanide required in gold leaching process solution converts to hydrocyanic

gas at pH lower pH and the conversion is much faster at pH lower than 9.5. A protective pH 

of at least 10.0 is therefore in cyanide leaching processes to prevent formation of HCN, 

which is extremely poisonous. Most gold leaching processes run at slurry pH between 10 

and 10.5. 

From Figures 19.11-9 to 19.11-12 show the minimum lime addition rates for the different 

ore types. Note these are not the optimum addition rates in terms of leaching kinetics, but 

these addition rates will maintain pH above the minimum levels required to prevent 

excessive production of HCN gas: 

 North BDRK- Minimum of 0.425kg/t lime is required to achieve a minimum of pH 10.0.  

 North SAPR- Minimum of 1.8kg/t lime addition is required to achieve a minimum of pH 

10.0. 

 South BDRK- Minimum of 0.38kg/t lime addition is required to give a minimum pH of 

10. 

 South SAPR- Minimum of 2.3kg/t lime addition is required to achieve a minimum pH of 

10. 

In general, Saprolites consume up to 6 times more lime than the bedrock ore, which result 

mineralogical differences between BDRK and SAPR.  

19.12 C onc lus ions  and R ecommendations  

 With the exception of North SAPR, the rest of the Agbaou ores respond satisfactory to 

direct cyanidation under natural oxygen levels. 

 All the four types of Agbaou ores exhibited high preg-robbing capacity. Leaching has to 

be undertaken strictly under CIL conditions to reduce reduced recovery of gold due to 

preg-robbing. Any pre-leach conditioning has to be done at minimum cyanide levels to 

minimize dissolution in the absence of carbon. 

 Leach kinetics increased significantly in Saprolites by reducing the slurry solids 

concentration from 50% to 40% and 35% weight by weight.  

 Improved leach kinetics at lower slurry densities confirm the negative effect of slurry 

viscosity on the leach kinetics. It is however important to note that slurry density in CIL 

can only be reduced to an extent where carbon can still be suspended. Normally a 

minimum solids density of 35% is required to keep carbon afloat. This and the 

increased cost of increased tank sizes would limit the extent to which solids density can 

be reduced.

 Although leach kinetics improved significantly in Saprolite by reducing the slurry solids 

concentration. 

 Leach kinetics in Saprolite improved significantly by both reducing the slurry solids 

concentration and addition of oxygen. Use of oxygen for CIL is the most economically 

beneficial option despite the increased operating costs of US$0.84/t 

The wide variation in hardness between the Saprolite and Bedrock, make it necessary to 

put different comminution circuits to suit the two main ore characterisations (BDRK and 

SAPR). A single stage soft rock crushing circuit and two mills operating in series will be 

used to crush and mill Saprolite. A three stage crushing circuit and two mills in parallel will 

be used for crushing and milling bedrock.

20.6 P lant Des c ription 

The Agbaou CIL plant consists of a 3 stage crushing (for treatment of hard rock), a single 

stage tooth roll crushing (for treatment of the soft rock), ball milling, gravity concentration 

and cyanidation by carbon-in-leach.  Zadra elution is utilised for recovery of gold from 

loaded carbon.  A brief description of the major items of equipment by section follows: 

20.6.1 Hard R oc k C rus hing –1024-F D10100 &  F D10200 

The primary hard rock crushing section is a three stage crushing circuit consisting of a 

Primary Jaw Crusher (10-CRU-01), a Secondary Hydro-cone Crusher (10-CRU-02), and 

two Tertiary Hydro-cone Crushers (10-CRU-03/4) in parallel. ROM feed is crushed from 

100% passing 1000mm to 80% passing 8mm in the feed to the mills. The hard rock 

crushing circuit is designed for a throughput of 280tph of primary ore. The tertiary crushers 

operate in a closed circuit with final sizing screens that produce the required mill feed 

product of 100% passing 10mm for feed to the milling circuit. 

The crushing section is equipped with a ROM Bin (10-BIN-01) with capacity of 150t for 

receiving ROM feed. The ROM bin is designed to be able to receive material by direct 

tipping from dump truck as well as from front end loader reclaiming from the ROM stockpile 

located close to the tipping bin.  

Ore is drawn from the ROM bin (10-BIN-01) using a variable speed Apron Feeder (10-APF-

01), which feeds the Primary Jaw Crusher (10-CRU-01) at controlled rate. The Primary 

Apron Feeder (10-AFP-01) operates in a feedback control loop with the primary crushing 

Mass Meter (10-MMT-01) to control the crushing rate by automatically varying the speed of 

the apron feeder. 

The primary jaw crusher discharges onto the primary crusher discharge Conveyor C1 (10-

CVR-01). C1 is equipped with heavy duty belting to enable it to withstand regular shock 

from the sharp edged rocks falling onto the belt from the crusher discharge. C1 feeds 

directly into the Secondary Crusher Feed Bin (10-BIN-02), which acts as surge for the 

secondary/tertiary crushing section, as well as allow controlled feed to the crushing section 

by use of a Vibrating Feeder (10-FDR-01) installed to feed the secondary crusher. 

A Mass Meter (10-MMT-01) on conveyor C1 measures, and records the instantaneous 

tonnage through the plant, as well as the totalised tonnage processed. The mass meter is 

used for both process control and material accounting.  

Tramp Magnet 1 (10-MGT-01) is installed over conveyor C1 for removal of tramp metal that 

would potentially damage the secondary/tertiary crushers.  If the magnet fails or non-

magnetic metal is present e.g. loader bucket teeth, Metal Detector 1 (10-MDT-01) is 

provided to detect this and trip the belt. 

The Secondary Screen (10-SCR-01) is a double deck screen equipped with a 40 mm 

aperture sizing deck and an 80 mm aperture relieving top deck. The secondary screen is 

fed at a controlled rate by the variable speed secondary screen feeder.  

Secondary screen oversize gravitates into the Secondary Crusher (10-CRU-02). Both the 

secondary screen undersize and the secondary crusher discharge gravitate onto the 

Recycle Conveyor C2 (10-CVR-02) which feeds into the Tertiary Feed Bin 10-BIN-03 via 

Conveyor C3 (10-CVR-03).   

The secondary crusher feed chute is equipped with a level element which controls the feed 

to the secondary screen in a feed back control loop with the secondary vibrating feeder. A 

high-high level alarm in the secondary crusher chute trips the secondary feeder.  

Tertiary crushing section consists of a Surge Bin (10-BIN-03) equipped with two variable 

speed vibrating Pan Feeders (10-FDR-02/3).The two Tertiary Screens (10-SCR-02/3) are 

fed at a controlled rate by the use of the two Vibrating Feeders 10-FDR-2/3. The tertiary 

screens are equipped with 10mm sizing bottom deck and a 20mm relieving top deck. 

The tertiary screen oversize gravitates into the two Tertiary Hydrocone Crushers (10-CRU-

03/4). The tertiary crushers discharge onto conveyor C2. It is important to control the 

circulating load by monitoring the PSD of the product on conveyor C3. Each of the tertiary 

crushers feed chutes is equipped with a level element which controls the feed rate to the 

crushers in a feedback control loop with the tertiary crusher feeders  

Adjustments on the primary, secondary and tertiary crushers CSS and the screening 

efficiency of tertiary and the secondary screens will be instrumental in controlling the 

throughput and product size through the circuit. 

A Tramp Magnet (10-MGT-02) installed on conveyor C3 removes all tramp metal that can 

damage the hydrocone crushers. If the magnet fails or non-magnetic metal is present e.g. 

loader bucket teeth, Metal Detector (10-MDT-02) is provided to detect this and trip the belt. 

Conveyor C3 is also equipped with Mass Meter (10-MMT-02) which measures the 

instantaneous throughput on the belt. A circulating load is calculated and displayed on 

SCADA. An alarm is set to go if the circulating load falls out of set low and high limits. The 

level of the circulating load will give an indication of the performance of the crushers and 

the screens, and will give an indication if there is a problem in this section.

The tertiary screen surge bin is equipped with a SCADA showing level sensor that shows 

the level of the bin. If the bin runs empty the feeders trip and, and crushers will run for a 

preset time before tripping.  

A 10t Gantry Crane (10-HST-01) at the secondary/tertiary crushing section is used for 

maintenance in this section. 

The mill feed conveyors C7 and C8 feed both the soft rock and hard material into the 

milling section. To feed the hard rock from the stockpile, the pan feeders in the two tunnels 

are utilised. Each of the mills is fed from the independent sets of vibrating pan feeders in 

the respective tunnels. 

Maintenance work at the primary crushing section is carried out with the assistance of a 60t 

mobile crane owned by the mine. 

20.6.2 S oft R ock C rus hing and Mill F eed S toc kpile 1024-F D10300 

20.6.2.1 Soft Rock Crushing  

The majority of the saprolite material is finer than the normal three stage product with the 

exception of occasional lumps which require minimum energy to break down to size 

suitable for feed to the mill. As a result it was necessary to include a soft rock crushing 

section to treat the saprolite and the less competent transitional material. 

A single stage soft rock crushing circuit has been included to treat the incompetent 

saprolite and transitional material at a rate of 170tph.  

The crushing section is equipped with a ROM Bin (10-BIN-04) with capacity of 150t. The 

ROM bin is designed to be able to receive material by direct tipping from dump truck as 

well as from a front end loader reclaiming from the ROM stockpile located close to the 

tipping bin.  

The Soft Rock Tipping Bin is an open front design with a chain curtain to retain material in 

the bin and hungry boards to prevent hang-up of sticky material.  The materials to be 

treated are friable and minimal oversize particles are being expected and will be rejected by 

the scrolling action of the toothed double rolls crusher. The teeth are scrolled towards the 

non-drive end of the machine. Oversize that cannot be nipped will flow towards this end 

where the area operator observing will manually activate the opening of an oversize 

discharge door, actuated by a pneumatic ram.  A breaker bar installed under the teeth 

breaks long slabby material that may pass vertically through the teeth.

Ore is drawn from the ROM Bin (10-BIN-04) using a variable speed Apron Feeder (10-APF-

02), which feeds the primary Soft Rock Crusher (mineral sizer) (10-CRU-05) at a controlled 

rate.  

Crusher Crane 1 (10-HST-02) is installed over the mineral sizer for maintenance and 

removal of occasional oversize ROM material.  

The soft rock crusher discharges onto Conveyor C5 (10-CVR-05), which discharges onto 

the Slew Conveyor C6 (10-CVR-06). C6 is a transfer conveyor that allows the product from 

the soft rock crusher to be fed to either mill1 or mill 2. 

A Mass Meter (10-MMT-03) installed on C5 measures, and records the instantaneous 

tonnage through the soft rock crusher, as well as the cumulative tonnage processed. The 

mass meter is used for both process control and material accounting. 

When treating soft rock material either of the two Mills (20-MIL-01/2) will be used as the 

primary mill and the other mill as the secondary mill. Fresh feed will therefore be fed into 

one of the two mills which is the primary mill at any one time. The slew conveyor is 

positioned to discharge either onto Conveyor C7 (10-CVR-07) or Conveyor C8 (10-CVR-

08) to feed mill1 or mill 2 respectively. 

20.6.2.2 Mill Feed Stockpile  

Crushed primary ore from the hard rock crushing section is delivered onto the Mill Feed 

Stockpile (10-STP-01) by Conveyor C4 (10-CVR-04), where the crushed ore is stored on 

the prior to delivery to the milling circuit. The pile contains approximately 5,000t (live) of 

crushed ore to ensure sufficient mill feed is available during downtime (e.g. for 

maintenance) in the crushing plant. 

Ore is reclaimed from the stockpile by a combination of 8 vibrating variable speed pan 

feeders - Stockpile Feeder 1 (10-FDR-04) to Stockpile Feeder 8 (10-FDR-11). Four feeders 

(10-FDR-04 to 07) are installed in Mill Stockpile Tunnel 1 and deliver onto Conveyor C7 

(10-CVR-07) feeding Mill 1. The remaining four Feeders (10-FDR-08 to 11) are installed in 

Mill Stockpile Tunnel 2 and deliver onto Conveyor C8 (10-CVR-08) feeding Mill 2. 

Conveyors C7 and C8 are each equipped with a belt weigher - Mill 1 Belt Weigher (10-

MMT-04) and Mill 2 Belt Weigher (10-MMT-05) ,located after the belts pass through the 

tunnel. These weighers are used for the control of the selected stockpile feeder's speed, 

measurement of individual ball mill feed rate and calculation of the total plant feed rate.

Lime is added to both mill's feed conveyors from the Lime Silo (10-SIL-01), which is located 

in a position between the C7 and C8 belts after they pass under the stockpile and out of 

their respective tunnels. From the Lime Silo, two screw conveyors - Mill 1 Lime Feeder (10-

FDS-01) and Mill 2 Lime Feeder (10-FDS-02) feed lime onto the respective mill feed 

conveyors. A Rotary Valve (10-FDS-03) draws lime from the silo and feeds the two screw 

feeders through a common silo discharge. The feeders are variable speed, controlled by 

the individual mill feed rate as measured by the individual mill belt weighers. 

Lime is delivered in bulk bags by truck to the fenced lime bag laydown area adjacent to 

Conveyor C7 and C8. The Lime Silo is filled from bulk bags using the Lime Crane (10-HST-

03) to hoist bags stored in the lime bag laydown area to the loading chute at the top of the 

silo. The lime silo Fan (10-FAN-05) removes lime dust from the silo through the Filter (10-

FIL-01) during filling.  

Lime Safety Shower (10-SSH-01) is located at the ground floor near the lime silo. The 

safety shower is activated by a foot pedal and is equipped with an eye bath. 

The Stockpile Spillage Pump (10-PMP-07) is installed at the mouth of the stockpile tunnel. 

The pump is installed with a drop-out sump arrangement. The pump is situated in a 

chamber recessed from a rail lined concrete containment bund, separated by a mesh 

panel. Coarse solids settle out in the rail-lined concrete containment bund and the spillage 

pump delivers only excess water and slimes passing through the mesh to the Mill 

Discharge Sump (20-TNK-01). Periodically a FEL or small skid steer loader is used to 

remove accumulated settled coarse solids from the drop-out sump and the spillage is 

tipped back onto the mill feed stockpile.  

Hammer-swing samplers - Mill 1 Sampler (20-SMP-01) and Mill 2 Sampler (20-SMP-02) 

are installed on conveyors C7 and C8 respectively for primary sampling of plant feed. The 

sampler motor parks the cutter out of the belt track. On a timed basis the sample motor is 

energised and the sampler arm is driven across the belt collecting a sample. The sampler 

is interlocked with the conveyor drive and will not sample if the belt is stationary or the 

instantaneous mass as measured by the belt weigher is below a minimum set point.  The 

timer is adjustable and the unit can be set to sample on a purely timed basis or from the 

belt weigher to sample per tonnage lot (e.g. every 100 tonnes). 

The cutter is positively driven through the bed of material.  The conveyor is equipped with 

troughing idlers at this point to produce a belt profile curved to the same arc as the cutter to 

maximise recovery of fines from the belt.

The cutter is fitted with PTFE scrapers on all three sides to contain sample within the cutter 

blade.  The cutter size can be modified to adjust the amount of sample taken per cut.  The 

potentially larger maximum lump size of material on the C7 and C8 when treating soft ore 

discharged from the roll crusher would require a cutter of typical 100mm, while sampling 

the -10mm tertiary crushed competent rock the cutter could be adjusted to suit the smaller 

size fraction. 

The Stockpile Dust Suppression (10-DSP-04) is provided to lay dust generated feeding the 

stockpile using fine mist water sprays.  The Tunnel Fans (10-FAN-01, 02, 03 and 04) are 

provided to ventilate the mill stockpile tunnels. 

20.6.3 Milling – 1024-F D20100 

The milling circuit comprises two parallel single stage ball mills in closed circuit with a 

common Mill Discharge Sump (20-TNK-01) and Classifying Hydro-cyclone Cluster (20-

CYC-01).  

When treating soft rock material, the two mills are operated in series with one mill 

functioning as the primary mill and the other as the secondary mill. The primary mill 

receives fresh feed and operates in an open circuit while the secondary mill treats the 

cyclone underflow in a closed circuit with the classifying cyclones. The Slew Conveyor (10-

CVR-06) makes possible to use either mill as the primary while the other is used for the 

secondary function. It is also possible to run one mill while the other is on maintenance. 

When treating competent transitional and primary hard rock material, the two mills are 

operated in parallel, both functioning as primary mills. Both mills will operate in a closed 

circuit with the common discharge sump and cyclone cluster. Total plant feed is equally 

shared between the two mills and the cyclone underflow is split between the two mills using 

the Cyclone Underflow Splitter (20-SPT-01). 

Wet scrapers are located at the head end of the mill feed conveyors (C7 and C8) to clean 

sticky material from the belts, which drains into the mill feed chute.  The feed chute is 

removable for access to the mill during relining operations.   

An access platform is provided at the mill feed end, for storage of and to manoeuvre liner 

components.   

The mills are equipped with trommel screens - Ball Mill 1 Trommel (20-TSC-01) and Ball 

Mill 2 Trommel (20-TSC-02).  The scats (trommel over size) drop into the individual rail-

lined concrete Scat Bunker 1 (20-BNK-01) or Scat Bunker 2 (20-BNK-02) for subsequent 

removal of accumulated scats by front end loader or "Bob-Cat".  Excess water drains from

the scat bunkers into the mill spillage sumps. The trommel is equipped with a spray bar.  

The trommel undersize slurry gravitates via a rubber-lined launder into the common mill 

discharge sump. 

Mill discharge slurry is diluted with process water in the mill discharge and pumped to the 

relevant Cyclone Cluster (20-CYC-01).  Two mill discharge pumps (one duty, one standby) 

are installed for the milling circuit.  Each pump is equipped with a variable speed drive. The 

density of the feed to the cyclone cluster is measured by the Mass Flow Meter (20-MFM-

01). Dilution water addition to the mill discharge sump is controlled by a Density Control 

Valve (PD20101-DCV-01)/(V19) on the sump dilution water line, which operates in a feed 
back control loop with the mass flow meter to maintain the cyclone feed density around the 

set point. If the mass flow meter reads consistently higher cyclone feed density it will send 

a feed back signal to instruct the flow control valve to increase the dilution water into the 

sump, and vice versa. 

The cyclone cluster consists of a 5 way distributor fitted with 5 cyclones of which 4 are 

normally operating at any one time. 

At the cyclone cluster, coarse particles pass through the cyclone spigot as dense slurry and 

gravitate back via a Boil Box system to the ball mill for further grinding, whilst fine solids 

pass through the cyclone overflow as dilute slurry. The cyclone overflow slurry from the 

cluster gravitates to a pipe launder feeding the Trash Screen (30-LSC-01). A bleed stream 

of cyclone underflow is diverted to the gravity gold recovery circuit from the cyclone cluster 

underflow collection launder. A sample point is provided at the cluster. The cyclone sample 

line hose is secured by bracket into the cluster underflow pan. 

At the trash screen, material such as grit, woodchips, fibres, wire and plastic, that would 

otherwise choke the CIL interstage screens and contaminate loaded carbon recovered from 

the CIL tanks, is removed. Trash screen underflow passes through the 2-in-1 CIL Feed 

Sampler (30-SMP-01) and into either CIL Tank 1 (30-TNK-01) or CIL Tank 2 (30-TNK-02) if 

tank 1 is offline. 

The trash screen oversize flows to a Trash Collection Bulk Bag (30-BAG-01) to facilitate 

collection, dewatering and removal of woodchips, etc.  Excess water drains from the trash 

bag onto the CIL floor sump.  

The bulk bag can be removed with a forklift or hoisted with the tower crane.   

Grinding media to both mills is added onto the mill feed conveyors at the stockpile using 

Lime Loading Hoist 10-HST-03. The CIL tower crane (30-HST-01) is situated such that it

covers up to the milling area, and is used for general mill maintenance requiring lifting of 

relatively light loads. 

Mill Spillage Pumps 1 and 2 (20-PMP-03/4) are installed for collection of spillage in the mill 

area.  Mill spillage pump 1 is installed at the feed end of the mills underneath access 

platform.  The Mill floor has a removable floor panel which is located under the semi-

retracted feed chute. This panel facilitates the dropping of material to the mill floor sump 

during a chute blockage. 

Mill spillage pump 2 is installed at the discharge end of the mills, to cope with spillage from 

the scat bunkers, trash screen, mill discharge sump and pumps. 

The spillage pumps deliver to the Mill Discharge Sump (20-TNK-01) along with the 

Stockpile Spillage Pump (10-PMP-08). Gravity tails from both gravity concentration circuits 

and spillage from the gravity concentrate redressing section are also returned to the mill 

discharge sump.   

The mill spillage pumps are installed with a drop-out sump arrangement. The pump is 

situated in a chamber recessed from a containment bund, separated by a mesh panel.  

Coarse solids settle out in the rail lined concrete containment bund and the spillage pump 

delivers only excess water and slimes passing through the mesh to the Mill Discharge 

Sump.  Periodically a FEL or small skid steer loader is used to remove accumulated settled 

coarse solids from the drop-out sump. 

Due to the presence of lime and cyanide in the mill slurry, two Safety Showers (20-SSH-01 

and 2) are provided at the Mill area.  Mill Safety Shower 1 (20-SSH-01) is located on the 

mill ground floor and Mill Safety Shower 2 (20-SSH-02) at the cyclone floor level.  The 

safety showers are activated by a foot pedal and are equipped with an eye bath. 

Mill lubrication systems are located adjacent to the mill at floor level.  

20.6.4 G ravity 1024-F D23100 

The plant is equipped with two parallel primary gravity recovery streams and a common 

redress concentrator. A fraction of the cyclone underflow is tapped from the Underflow 

Splitter (20-SPT-01) to feed the two gravity streams. 

In each primary concentration circuit the feed slurry from the cyclone underflow is received 

on a horizontal vibrating screen, Gravity Screen 1 and 2 (23-SCR-01 and 02) to remove 

material greater than 2 mm from the concentrator feed, that would otherwise plug the

concentrator bowl riffles. Spray water is applied to the screen and the screen spray water 

line is piped to the screen inlet box for feed dilution to about 50% solids. 

The oversize from the screens gravitates back to mill feed via the Gravity Oversize Chutes, 

Chute 1 (23-CHU-01) or Chute 2 (23-CHU-02) into either mill feed chute. The screen 

undersize slurry gravitates to a centrifugal concentrator - Concentrator 1 or 2 (23-CNC-01 

or 02).  

The feed to the gravity sections is regulated by valves on the gravity feed lines from the 

splitter.  

Actuated isolation valves are provided on each concentrator feed line from the screen 

underpan. A bypass valve is provided to bypass the concentrator when it is out of 

concentrating cycle. During the normal concentrating cycle the valve feeding the 

concentrator is open and the valve on the bypass line closed. For bypass during the 

concentrate flush cycle the valve positions are reversed. 

Tailings from each concentrator gravitate to the mill discharge sump. 

Concentrate from each of the centrifugal concentrators is flushed to Concentrate Tank 1 

(23-TNK-01) located in the gravity concentrate redressing room adjacent to the gold room. 

Excess concentrator flushing water is decanted from the tank by opening an actuated valve 

on a decant pipe, after a pre-set time delay after a flush cycle, to ensure the concentrate 

settles to the cone of the tank. A 15mm square mesh is installed on the top of the 

concentrate tanks to avoid oversize getting into the tank and causing blockages. 

Accumulated concentrate is fed to the Redress Table (23-TBL-01) for upgrading and the 

table concentrate is collected in small drums for transfer to the gold room. 

Concentrate tabling is normally performed on weekdays during dayshift only. The 

concentrate tank is sized to allow accumulation of concentrate arising over a weekend. To 

ensure optimum recovery of the minimum mass of the highest grade concentrate on the 

shaking table, the batch of concentrate accumulated in the tank is tabled with the Table 

Tailings Pump (23-PMP-01) delivery set to recycle to the concentrate tank. After the 

accumulated concentrate and recycled first pass tailings have been processed through the 

table more than once, the table tailings pump delivery can be reset to deliver lower grade 

tails to the mill discharge sump. 

The centrifugal gravity concentrators are located in the mill structure in a securely screened 

off area with locked access doors. The concentrate tanks and redressing table are located

in the gold room with restricted access via a clean and dirty change-house system. The 

redressing area is bunded to prevent escape of spilt high-grade concentrates. The Redress 

Spillage Pump (23-PMP-01) is installed to return spilt high grade concentrates to the 

concentrate tank or mill discharge sump. The redress concentrate is calcined and smelted 

together into bullion in the gold room. 

20.6.5 C IL  – 1024-F D30100 &  F D30200 

The Leach/CIL consists of seven agitated tanks (30-TNK-01 to 7) each with capacity 

1500m3 all of which are capable of being fitted with carbon retaining Interstage Screens 1 

to 6 (30-ISC-01 to 06). Tank 1 is not fitted with an interstage screen and no carbon is added 

to tank 1. 

The first tank 30-TNK-01 will be used as a pre-leach without any cyanide addition to the 

tank. pH modified slurry from the milling circuit is oxidised in the first tank by passing 

through the oxygen reactor. The conditioned slurry then gravitates to the first CIL Tank, 

(30-TNK-02 or 03). Cyanide addition to slurry only starts in the first CIL tank. Minimum 

levels of cyanide have to be maintained in the process water to reduce leaching in the 

leach tank due to residual cyanide in process water. 

An oxygen dispensing system will be installed to the first 5 Tanks (30-TNK-01 to 5). In 

addition to the oxygen spurges, Tank 1 (30-TNK-01), is equipped with an oxygen reactor. 

This unit uses an inline oxygen injector that generates a thin film of oxygen delivered to the 

unit at 100-150 kPa above the slurry pressure, into a pumped slurry stream.  

The oxygen reactor is provided by the developers under a "lease" type agreement.  The 

unit is hired to the operating mine and is therefore procured by Etruscan Resources and not 

in MDM scope of supply. 

A Cyanide Analyser (30-CNA-01) sampling from the first CIL Tank (30-TNK-02 or 03) and 

the last CIL Tank (30-TNK-06 or 07) measures the cyanide levels at the feed and tails end 

of CIL and controls cyanide addition to CIL. The cyanide analyser also analyses and 

controls the pH in CIL at the feed and the tails ends. The pH transducer controls the speed 

of the Lime Screw Feeders (10-FDS-01 and 02) to maintain CIL pH at set levels, normally 

+-10pH. 

If any of the tanks are taken off-line the feed to them can be closed and the tank can be 

bypassed, through bypass lines on each of the tanks 1 to 7. 

Slurry is pumped intermittently from either of the first two CIL Tanks (30-TNK-02/03) by the 

vertical spindle recessed impeller Loaded Carbon Transfer Pumps  (30-PMP-01/02) to feed

the Loaded Carbon Screen (30-SCR-01), located above the Acid Wash Cone (41-TNK-01), 

which in turn is above the Elution Column (40-CLM-01).  Screen undersize returns to CIL 

Tank 2 (30-TNK-02), or Tank 3 (30-TNK-03) if tank 2 is off-line, while loaded carbon drops 

directly into the acid wash cone. 

Carbon is advanced from a CIL tank to the next upstream tank, counter-current to the slurry 

flow by the recessed impeller Carbon Transfer Pumps 2 to 6 (30-PMP-02 to 06).These 

pumps are located in each of the remaining 5 CIL Tanks (30-TNK-03 to 30-TNK-07). Inter-

tank carbon transfer is carried out one tank at a time, and a total of 4hrs has been allowed 

to move carbon from one tank to the next upstream tank. The normal sequence is to move 

loaded carbon from the first CIL Tank (30-TNK-02) to the loaded carbon screen. Carbon is 

then moved from the downstream tanks to replace carbon moved to acid wash, starting 

with CIL Tank 2 (30-TNK-03) and finishing with CIL Tank 6 (30-TNK-07). Regular carbon 

advancement ensures that the required carbon concentration profile is maintained in the 

CIL tanks to get the optimum recovery of gold onto carbon. 

Quenched, regenerated carbon is returned directly to the final CIL Tank 6 (30-TNK-07) 

from the Quench Screen (42-SCR-01) downstream of the Regeneration Kiln (42-RGK-01).  

Provision is made for return of regenerated carbon to CIL Tank 5 (30-TNK-06) if CIL tank 6 

is offline. 

A tower crane - CIL Crane 1 (30-HST-01) covers the CIL area for operational and 

maintenance purposes.  The crane is primarily used for the periodic removal of interstage 

screens for washing. The dirty screen is replaced with the spare Interstage Screen (30-ISC-

07).  The dirty screen is placed in the Screen Wash Frame (30-FRM-01) for washing using 

wire brushes and the high-pressure Screen Wash Pump (30-WSH-01).  The screen wash 

frame has space for two (one dirty, one clean) screens so that screen removal results in a 

CIL tank being taken off-line for the minimum period.  The screen wash frame is located in 

the tailings plant bunded area. The spillage from inter-stage screen washing is pumped to 

the Carbon Safety Screen (60-LSC-01) prior to collection in the Carbon Holding Bulk Bag 

(60-BAG-01). 

The CIL bunded area is provided with two spillage pumps - CIL Spillage Pump 1 (30-PMP-

07) delivering to CIL Tank 1 or 2 and CIL Spillage Pump 2 (30-PMP-08), delivering to CIL 

Tank 4 or 5. 

All CIL Tanks are fitted with manholes. Each tank is fitted with a drain valve for emptying 

the tank when required.

Due to the presence of lime and the addition of cyanide at the CIL, a Safety Shower (30-

SSH-01) is provided on top of the CIL tanks.  The safety shower is activated by a foot pedal 

and is equipped with an eye bath. 

20.6.6 Ac id Was h - 1024-F D41100 

The Acid Wash Cone (41-TNK-01) is sized to handle a 6 tonne batch of loaded carbon.  

The design requirement is to treat one batch per day for 26 days in a month. Four days 

have been allowed for any maintenance required to the elution and acid wash plants. 

Loaded carbon in the acid wash cone is elutriated (washed) with raw water by running 

Carbon Transfer Water Pump (41-PMP-02/3) with the valve to carbon transfer (PD41101-

V-25) closed and the elutriation valve (PD41101-V-20) open. During elutriation, raw water 

is passed from the bottom of the cone at about 2 bed volumes/hr sufficient to just lift the 

carbon bed in the cone. This allows the trapped light contaminants to be released from the 

carbon bed. The upward water flux will lift with it all the light contaminants including flaky 

carbon. Elutriation water overflows the cone and gravitates to the Tailings Screen (60-LSC-

01). It is sometimes beneficial to just crack open air at the bottom of the cone to assist 

loosening the carbon bed to remove trapped contaminants. 

After elutriation, remaining bed volume of water is drained onto the floor by opening drain 

valve (PD41101-V-21). After draining all elutriation water the acid wash cycle can be 

initiated.  

During acid wash 3% HCl is circulated through the carbon bed at a rate of 2 bed volumes 

per hr normally for a period of 1 hr using Acid Wash Pump (41-PMP-01). The dilute acid 

solution overflows the acid wash cone and returns to the Acid Wash Tank (41-TNK-04). 

The acid reacts with inorganic contaminants (carbonates and sulphates) sticking onto and 

closing the pores on the carbon surface. As the acid reacts with the carbonates and 

sulphates on the carbon surface, carbon dioxide is released which results in effervescence 

showing in the cone as bubbles of carbon dioxide which rise to the surface. Effervescence 

is thus a very good indicator to see if acid wash is effectively taking place and to determine 

when to stop circulating acid through the carbon bed. 

After acid wash has been completed and acid circulation stopped, a bed volume of dilute 

acid remains in the acid wash cone. The dilute acid is drained back into the acid wash tank  

by keeping the suction valve open and allowing the acid to drain back through the pump 

into the tank. The carbon batch is then rinsed of residual acid by running the Carbon 

Transfer Water Pump (41-PMP-02/3) in a manner similar to elutriation. Raw water washes 

residual acid and overflows the acid wash cone to the tailings screen.

A batch of dilute acid is used for up to 4 batches after which it becomes too contaminated 

to effectively remove the inorganic contaminants. After four acid washes the dilute acid is 

neutralised with dilute caustic solution and discarded by tailings screen. 

The final step in acid wash is the neutralisation of the rinsed carbon using a dilute caustic 

solution. A 10% caustic solution is circulated through the rinsed acid washed batch to 

remove any residual acid from the carbon prior to dropping the carbon to the elution 

column. 

Neutralisation is achieved by running Caustic Pump (41-PMP-06) to add 10% caustic 

solution to the used acid batch in acid wash tank. Enough caustic is added to neutralise all 

the residual HCl. The neutralised acid is then pumped to the tailings screen. A pH monitor 

on the neutralised acid line to tailings reads the pH of the effluent and trips the Caustic 

Pump (41-PMP-06) if the pH goes below a set point. 

Acid washed and neutralised carbon batch is dropped into the Elution Column (40-CLM-

01).  Excess water is drained from the elution column during carbon transfer through the 

elution column bottom drain and drains into the CIL bund. A vent valve is open when 

dropping carbon to allow the escape of gases from the column during elution column filling. 

Due to the use of hydrochloric acid, a Safety Shower (41-SSH-01) is provided in the acid 

wash area.  The safety shower is activated by a foot pedal and is equipped with an eye 

bath. 

The acid wash bund is equipped with a "false" suspended grid floor so that in the event of 

the bund being flooded the operators need not wade in acidic spillage. 

Acid Wash Spillage Pump (41-PMP-04) is installed in the acid wash area.  Spillage is 

pumped to tailings screen. A pH monitor on the acid wash spillage line trips the spillage 

pump if the pH falls below a set point to prevent accidental formation of excessive 

hydrogen cyanic gas at the tailings screen. 

20.6.7 E lution - 1024-F D40100 

The Elution is by pressure Zadra method. The eluant, a dilute caustic-cyanide solution is 

pumped from the Elution Tank (40-TNK-01) via the Secondary (recuperative) Heat 

Exchanger (40-HTE-01) and then via the Primary Heat Exchanger (40-HTE-02), into the 

Elution Column (40-CLM-01) under elevated temperature and pressure. This promotes a 

chemical reaction where the gold-cyanide complex adsorbed onto the carbon is removed 

into the eluate solution.

A small descalant tank and pump are located in the elution bund to facilitate heat 

exchanger descaling. 

The elution column is pressurised. Heat for the elution circuit is provided by diesel-fired 

elution heaters - Elution Heater 1 and 2 (40-HTR-01 & 02). The heater burners heat a 

"thermic oil" fluid, which has a high specific heat capacity and conductivity. The thermic oil 

is used to transfer heat to the eluant solution entering the column via the primary heat 

exchanger. Hot eluate solution exiting the column is cooled by contact with fresh eluant 

solution being pumped into the elution column, in the secondary (recuperative) heat 

exchanger. The secondary heat exchanger recovers some of the usable heat (from eluate 

solution leaving the column) into the eluant solution pumped from the elution tank. The 

column operates under a pressure of typically 300 to 350kPa.  Heat exchangers are 

fabricated from stainless steel. 

To start an elution, the caustic and cyanide concentrations of the eluant solution, in the 

elution tank, are checked and if required, corrected by adding fresh reagents (caustic 

and/or cyanide). The eluant solution is pre-heated in the elution tank by the Elution Tank 

Heater (40-HTR-03). The preheated solution is then pumped through the heat exchangers 

and elution column and back to the elution tank until operating temperature is reached.  

When the elution column reaches operating temperature the eluate flow is directed to the 

electrowinning cells in the gold room. Spent electrolyte is returned to the elution tank. 

It is anticipated that, including pre-heating the elution tank, a complete elution cycle takes 

approximately 17 hours.  This is made up of an hour to fill the column, three hours to bring 

the system to operating temperature, 12 hours of elution of which the final hour is without 

heating being applied to allow the system to cool and one hour to empty the column. 

On completion of an elution, carbon is transferred to the Eluted Carbon Tank (42-TNK-01) 

using raw water to pressurise the top of the column and as transport water fed to the outlet 

bend at the base of the column. Carbon slurry is delivered to the eluted carbon tank and 

excess water is drained via wedge wire strainers to the tailings screen. 

Eluant solution can only be reused for a limited number of strips before the level of 

contamination becomes unacceptable. It is normal to use a batch for 4 strips, then discard 

it, and make a new eluant batch. The spent eluant is pumped to CIL tank 1 or 2 by the 

elution pump. Thus, the benefit of any available caustic and cyanide in the spent eluant is 

used and the carbon in the CIL can recover the gold values.

To make a new batch of eluant solution, the elution tank is filled with raw water and 

sufficient concentrated cyanide and caustic soda solutions are added to reach the desired 

strength. The caustic soda solution is added batch wise from the caustic tank by the 

Caustic Pump (80-PMP-06). Cyanide is delivered to the elution tank by a dedicated elution 

Cyanide Pump (80-PMP-04). 

Due to the use of caustic soda solution and cyanide at the elution area, a Safety Shower 

(40-SSH-01) is provided in this area. 

20.6.8 R egeneration – 1024-F D42100 

Eluted carbon is transferred using process water to the Eluted Carbon Tank (42-TNK-01) 

feeding the Regeneration Kiln situated in the regeneration and tailings plant.  

Carbon is withdrawn from the eluted carbon tank to feed the Regeneration Kiln (42-RGK-

01) by the Screw Feeder (42-FDS-01) for thermal regeneration.  Regenerated carbon from 

the kiln is quenched in the Quench Pan (42-PAN-01) and overflows onto the Carbon Sizing 

Screen (42-SCR-01) to remove fines, before discharging into the last stage CIL tank to 

replace loaded carbon transferred out of the circuit. 

Carbon fines passing through the carbon sizing screen deck gravitate to the tails screen, 

where any fugitive carbon can be recovered for reuse.  The kiln is designed to treat a 6t 

batch of carbon in less than 20 hours. 

Provision is made to bypass the eluted carbon tank and kiln and return eluted carbon 

directly to the carbon sizing screen should the kiln be offline. 

A drip tray is installed under the kiln to collect any accidental diesel leakage, this spillage 

will be collected in a container for proper disposal. 

The Carbon Conditioning Tank (42-TNK-02), complete with the Carbon Conditioning 

Agitator (42-AGT-01) is provided to condition new carbon before addition to the circuit. 

To condition virgin carbon, the carbon conditioning tank is partially filled with process water 

and the carbon conditioning agitator started. Using the CIL crane, 1 tonne of carbon is 

added to the agitated tank and the mixture agitated for an hour.  The conditioned carbon 

slurry is drained to the carbon sizing screen to remove fines, before discharge into either 

CIL tanks 5 or 6. 

Due to the presence of cyanide containing solutions in the regeneration area, a safety 

shower (42-SSH-01) located close to the regeneration kiln in case of any emergencies.

20.6.9 E lec trowinning – 1024-F D50100 

Eluate from the elution column is delivered to the Electrowinning Flush Tank (50-TNK-01).  

The tank acts as a steady head tank feeding the electrowinning cells. Two cells - 

Electrowinning Cell 1 and 2 (50-EWC-01 and 02) are installed, operating in parallel. Each 

cell is equipped with a rectifier - Rectifier 1 and 2 (50-REC-01/2). The rectifiers are located 

in a room adjacent to the gold room 

Any cell can be bypassed by closing the feed valve to the cell from the electrowinning flush 

tank. The tank then overflows excess solution directly to the return pipeline feeding barren 

eluate back to the elution tank. 

Gold in the eluate is plated out onto stainless steel knitted mesh type cathodes.  

Periodically the cathodes are removed and placed in the high-sided Cathode Wash Table 

(50-TBL-01). The gold sludge adhering to the knitted mesh is washed off with a high-

pressure water spray provided by the HP Cathode Washer (50-WSH-01). The cathodes are 

replaced in the cell. Washings from the wash bay are drained into the Cathode Wash Tank 

(50-TNK-02).  The free settling gold sludge is drained into a bucket for transfer to the gold 

room and drying in the calcine oven. 

In the event of spillage, the Electrowinning Spillage Pump (50-PMP-01) is provided.  

Spillage can be pumped back to the cathode wash tank where any entrained high value 

solids can settle out and recovered. Alternatively the spillage pump can deliver to CIL tank 

1 or 2.  

The Electrowinning Hoist (50-HST-01) is provided for removal of the cathodes and 

maintenance purposes. 

Electrowinning cells are equipped with extractor fans which extract fumes produced by the 

process of plating. The cell extractor fans exhaust out of the gold room.  

Samplers (40-SMP-01) and (40-smp-02) placed on the electrowinning feed and tail lines 

respectively take samples of feed and tails to/from electrowinning. The samples taken are 

analysed for solution gold and the results are used to determine the efficiency of the 

electrowinning process.  

Due to the presence of caustic soda and (optional) sodium cyanide in the hot eluate 

solution feeding the cells, the Cell Safety Shower 1 (50-SSH-01) is provided in this area.

20.6.10 S melt– 1024-F D51100 

The redressed gravity concentrate and cathode sludge from the electrowinning cells are 

dried in Calcine Oven 1 (51-CCF-01). Calcine is smelted with fluxes into gold doré bullion 

using the Smelting Furnace (51-SMF-01). 

Provision is made for storage and weighing of fluxes in the gold room. Bullion bars are 

cleaned, weighed and stamped before storage in the strong room for despatch. 

A 16 mm thick steel plate is cast into the gold room floor in front of the smelting furnace to 

allow bullion moulds to be tipped out without damaging the concrete floor. 

The Smelting Furnace (51-SMF-01) is covered by the Furnace Fume Hood (51-XHD-01) to 

collect high value dust emitted during a smelt.  The fumes are filtered using the Furnace 

Bag Filter (51-FIL-01) and high value dust collected and returned to the smelting furnace. 

Clean and dry instrument air is piped to the furnace bag filter for reverse pulse cleaning of 

bag filter cloth elements. 

The gold room is housed in a secure brick building with restricted access and clean and 

dirty change house facilities.  

One 6-tray calcine oven is installed to provide standby capacity, secure storage capacity 

and to allow gravity concentrates and CIL gold cathode sludge to be calcined / dried 

separately.  

Slag arising from the smelting process is fed back to the mill through the mill feed chutes.   

Digital electronic scales are provided for weighing fluxes (Flux Scale (51-MMT-03)) and 

doré bullion bars (Bullion Scale (51-MMT-01)) and bullion sample prills (Prill Scale (51-

MMT-02)).   

Two pneumatic Filter Presses (51-FIL-02/3) are used for dewatering the gold sludge from 

electrowinning before placing in the calcining oven.

20.6.11 T ailings  - 1024-F D60100 

The CIL tails slurry stream from the last CIL tank gravitates to the Carbon Safety Screen 

(60-LSC-01) to reclaim any abraded carbon that may be present.  Other effluent streams 

including the reject acid wash solution and fine carbon stream from the regeneration kiln 

report to the carbon safety screen. 

The carbon safety screen underflow gravitates into the 2 Detox Tanks (60-TNK-01 and 02) 

in series.  The two agitated detox tanks are interlinked by an overflow weir. The Final Detox 

Tank (60-TNK-02) functions as both a detox tank and a final tailings sump. Hydrogen 

peroxide solution is administered into the first detox tank by use of variable speed 

Hydrogen Peroxide Dosing Pumps (60-PMP-04/5). A provision is allowed to add hydrogen 

peroxide to the second tank. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with WAD cyanide and precipitates 

a stable complex which can be discharged into the environment without the normal hazards 

associated with cyanide contamination. 

The final detox tank is equipped with two Tailings Pumps (60-PMP-01/2) which pump the 

final tailings to the Tailings Storage Facility (61-DAM-01). This slurry passes through the 2-

in-1 Tails Sampler (60-SMP-01). 

 The Tails Spillage Pump (60-PMP-03) is installed at the tailings pumping area.  The pump 

delivers to the carbon safety screen.   

To account for the tonnage of tailings exiting the plant the Tails Mass Flow Meter (60-MFM-

01) incorporating nuclear slurry density measurement and volumetric flow measurement by 

magnetic flow meter is installed on the tails pump delivery pipeline. 

The tails mass flow meter will have local display of instantaneous density and volumetric 

flow. The displays will be repeated on the SCADA system. 

Carbon safety screen oversize flows to a Carbon Holding Bulk Bag (60-BAG-01), so that 

the contained gold in any fine carbon recovered can be reclaimed. Excess slurry and water 

drains to the floor spillage area. 

The bag can be removed with a forklift or hoisted with a crane, the empty bag can then be 

replaced. 

A Tailings Spillage Pump (60-PMP-03) pumps any spillage back onto the carbon safety 

screen for re-screening.

Due to the presence of lime and cyanide in the tailings slurry, the Tails Safety Shower (60-

SSH-01) is located in the tailings area. 

20.6.12 R eagents  – 1024-F D80100 

Reagent makeup and offloading facilities include cyanide, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid 

and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide storage tank is located inside the 

regeneration and tailings area. 

Sodium cyanide briquettes are loaded into a cage located in the Cyanide Mixing Tank (80-

TNK-01). The tank is filled with water and the Cyanide Mixer (80-AGT-01) starts to dissolve 

the briquettes to make up a 25% solution of sodium cyanide. 

On completion of dissolution, the cyanide solution is pumped to the Cyanide Storage Tank 

(80-TNK-02) by the Cyanide Transfer Pump (80-PMP-01).  Cyanide solution is dosed to the 

CIL via a ring main pipeline from the cyanide storage tank using either Cyanide Dosing 

Pump 1 or 2 (80-PMP-02 or 03) - one duty, one standby. A dedicated Elution Cyanide 

Dosing Pump (80-PMP-04) is used to deliver cyanide to the elution tank from the cyanide 

storage tank. 

Cyanide transfer pump and the elution cyanide pump are centrifugal chemical pumps while 

the dosing pumps are peristaltic hose type. 

Cyanide spillage from the cyanide make up tank bunded area is pumped backed to the 

Cyanide Mixing Tank or to the leach tank 30-TNK-01 by the Cyanide Spillage Pump (80-

PMP-05). 

Caustic soda pearls or flakes are received in bags, which are mixed to a solution of 25% 

strength in the Caustic Tank (80-TNK-03). The tank also serves as a storage tank, with 

dosing to the elution and acid wash areas being achieved directly from the tank using the 

Caustic Pump (80-PMP-06). 

The caustic and cyanide tanks are all located in an interconnected bunded area. Caustic 

spillage from the caustic tank flows to the cyanide bunded area where it is pumped to CIL 

or to cyanide mixing tank. 

Safety Showers (80-SSH-01 and 02) are provided at the cyanide, and caustic makeup, 

storage and offloading facilities. Cyanide Make-Up Safety Shower 1 (80-SSH-01) is located 

at floor level near the Cyanide Mixing Tank (80-TNK-01) and Caustic Make-Up Safety 

Shower 2 (80-SSH-02) is located next to the caustic storage tank, close to the Caustic 

Pump (80-PMP-06).

Electric hoists are provided for both cyanide and caustic make up to lift the regents into the 

respective mixing tanks.  

Because all the Hydrochloric acid in the plant is used in the acid wash area, the acid 

storage tank is situated in a bunded area close to the acid wash. Hydrochloric acid is 

received in isotainers, which are emptied by the acid offload pump into the Acid Storage 

Tank (41-TNK-02). As required, acid is pumped to the Acid Wash Tank (41-TNK-04) using 

the Acid Transfer Pump (41-PMP-05). 

Hydrogen Peroxide (60% strength) is received in isotainers. Because all the hydrogen 

peroxide is used at the tailings, the storage tank and the dosing pumps are all situated in 

the regeneration and tailings bunded area. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is pumped 

from the isotainer using the Peroxide Offloading Pump (60-PMP-06). Dosing to the detox 

tanks is achieved by using the Peroxide Dosing Pumps (60-PMP-04/5). 

Peroxide spillage from the peroxide bunded area must be diluted with ample hosing water 

before it is allowed to flow to the Tailings Spillage Pump (60-PMP-03). 

20.6.13 Water – 1024-F D70100-400  

20.6.13.1 Raw Water Supply 

Raw water is sourced from two sources: water from the pit dewatering boreholes and water 

from the seasonal stream containment dam which will be built upstream of the tailings 

storage facility.  

Borehole water from pit dewatering is pumped into an Overnight Pond (70-PND-03). The 

overnight pond is equipped with water pumps (70-PMP-25/26/27) which transfer the raw 

water to the Raw Water Pond (70-PND-01) situated at the plant site. Two of the pumps will 

run concurrently at any time. The third pump is a standby pump. 

Raw water is pumped from the Seasonal Stream Containment Dam (70-DAM-01) by a set 

of Water Pumps (70-PMP-01/02/03) to the raw water pond. Water supply from the 

containment dam is only available during the wet seasons.  

Raw water is used in two forms, as filtered and unfiltered raw water. Filtered raw water is 

used for all reagents make up, dust suppression, high pressure washers, gland water, mill 

cooling water and supply to portable water plant. Two dedicated pumps (70-PMP-07 and 

08), one duty and the other standby are used to deliver raw water from the raw water pond 

to the various areas of use. Strainers (70-STN-01 and 2), a duty and a standby, installed on 

the main raw water delivery line remove suspended matter from the raw water making it 

suitable for the various applications that require low levels of suspended material.

Various off takes from the main filtered raw water header provide sub-headers to the 

various sections of the plant. 

Raw water is delivered to the Gland Water Tank (70-TNK-01) for storage of raw water used 

for gland service at the mill and tailings pumps. The Gland Water Pumps (70-PMP-11 and 

12), a duty and a standby, deliver gland water to the mill pumps and the tailings pumps.  

The gland service pumps are sized to allow for delivery of gland service to idle standby 

pumps to ensure they are properly flushed on shut down. 

Gland service water is delivered to a pump at least 50 kPa above the maximum pump 

delivery pressure to ensure a good seal is achieved.  A high pressure is satisfactory but an 

excessively high gland service pressure can cause damage to the pump shaft.   

Raw water is used in its unfiltered form for gravity fluidisation and for fire hydrants.  

Three fire water pumps are provided for fire fighting. Fire Water Pump 1 (70-PMP-04) and 

the Fire Water Booster Pump (70-PMP-06) have conventional electric motors and Fire 

Water Pump Diesel (70-PMP-05) has a diesel engine powered drive. (These pumps are 

started automatically and should be tested regularly according to safety regulations). 

The Gravity Water Pump 1 (70-PMP-09) and Gravity Water Pump 2 (70-PMP-10) deliver 

water to the gravity concentrators for fluidising.  One pump runs at any time supplying 

water to both Gravity Concentrators (23-CNC-01 and 02) while the other is a standby. The 

pumps are rated to supply enough water to both at a minimum required head to both 

concentrators.  

A fraction of the filtered water goes to feed the potable water plant. The potable water plant 

consists of a Clarifier (71-CLR-01), two Sand Filters (71-FIL-01 and 02), Two Carbon Filters 

(71-FIL-03 and 04) and a Primary and Final Chlorinator (71-CLJ-01 and 02). Filtered raw 

water goes through stages from clarification to sand filtration, and chlorination to produce 

final potable water which is stored in the closed Potable Water Tank (71-TNK-02). Two 

dedicated pumps (71-PMP-03 and 04), a duty and a standby, deliver potable water to 

various areas in the plant, including safety showers. The potable water pump also delivers 

water to the Safety Shower Header Tank (71-TNK-03) situated at the highest point of the 

plant (ideally above the regeneration structure). The safety shower header acts as a 

strategic reserve when the potable water pump is not running.  

The mill lubrication systems require cooling water at times to maintain the required oil 

temperature in the mill bearings and combiflex drive. Water flow into the coolers is 

controlled by on-off type actuated valves controlled by the oil temperature measurement.

20.6.13.2 Process Water 

Process water is stored in the Process Water Pond (70-PND-02). The process water pond 

receives water from two main water sources, namely the return water from the tailings 

storage facility (61-DAM-02), and raw water top up. The pond is constructed with earth wall 

embankments above ground level, lined with HDPE and puddle pipe suction manifolds 

passing through the wall. The process water pond supplies are the process and spray 

water requirements for the processing plant. Process water pond raw water top up is 

directly from the raw water source by an off-take line from the main raw water feed line to 

the raw water dam. 

Tailings return water is flows directly from the tailings decant tower into the return water 

dam from where it is pumped to the process water pond using the Return Water Pumps 

(61-PMP-01/2). The clarity of the return water is monitored by the operators, and transfer 

should be stopped if the water from the tailings dam becomes dirty.   

Process water to milling and gravity is delivered by two dedicated Process Water Pumps, 

(70-PMP-13 and 14), one duty and the other standby. Gravity water header takes off the 

main process water header from the milling section. One process water pump runs at a 

time and provides process water for both mills and process water for both gravity streams.  

All spray water and hosing water for the plant including spray water for all the screens and 

trommels comes from the process water dam by means of two Spray Water Pumps (70-

PMP-15 and 16), one duty and the other standby. This allows better control of the milling 

and gravity water by avoiding fluctuations caused by opening and closing of process water 

as various equipment comes on and off line. The spray water system is also designed to 

give a relatively higher pressure than the normal process water. 

20.6.14 Air S ervic es  - 1024-F D81100 

Compressed air is provided by either Compressor 1 (81-CMP-01) or Compressor 2 (81-

CMP-02).  Plant air is delivered to the Plant Air Receiver (81-ARC-01) and reticulated to the 

plant. 

A portion of the compressed air is drawn from the plant air receiver and filtered using duty 

and standby Primary Filters (Air Filter 1A and 1B (81-FIL-01 and 02)). The primary filters 

are Grade B high efficiency general purpose protection filters providing filtered air with 

removal of particles down to 1µm and a maximum remaining oil aerosol content of 

0.5mg/m³ at 21ºC. Filtered air is dried using Air Dryer (81-ACD-01 and 02),duty and stand-

by, that reduces the moisture content to a 3ºC dew-point, then reheats the air via a 

recuperative heat exchanger to approximately ambient temperature.

The dried air is finally filtered to Instrument Air quality using duty and standby Secondary 

Filters (Air Filter 2A and 2B (81-FIL-03 and 04)). The secondary filters are Grade C high 

efficiency oil free protection filters providing filtered air with removal of particles down to 

0.01µm and a maximum remaining oil aerosol content of 0.01mg/m³ at 21ºC. Instrument air 

is accumulated in the Instrument Air Receiver (81-ARC-02) and reticulated to the areas of 

plant where it is required.  

20.6.15 P lant Dies el - 1024-F D81200 

Diesel is delivered to the plant by a diesel tanker and stored in the plant Diesel Storage 

Tank (81-TNK-01). When required, diesel is pumped to the Elution / Regeneration Diesel 

Header Tank (81-TNK-02), which feeds the Elution Heaters, Regeneration Kiln and 

Smelting Furnace by the Diesel Pump (81-PMP-01).  

20.7 T echnical Dis cus s ion 

20.7.1 C rus hing and Milling 

A separate single stage soft rock crushing circuit has been selected for the heavily 

weathered saprolites, and softer transitional material. The saprolites are heavily weathered, 

making a three stage crushing circuit technically and economically unjustified. In contrast 

the lower transitional and fresh rock is competent and requires a three stage crushing 

circuit to produce feed suitable for the milling circuit. 

The milling circuit is designed with two parallel mills sharing a common sump and a 

common cyclone cluster. The milling circuit is designed to be configured to different circuit 

configurations depending on the type of ore being treated. When treating the soft rock the 

mills will be configured to operate in series with one mill being the primary mill and the 

other the secondary mill. The primary mill receives fresh feed from crushing and operates 

in an open circuit. The secondary mill receives only cyclone underflow and operates in a 

closed circuit with the cyclone cluster. 

When treating competent ore, both mills operate in parallel as primary mills, with the total 

plant throughput split equally between the two mills. Each mill operates in closed circuit 

with a shared cyclone cluster. The cyclone underflow is split equally between the two mills. 

As there are wood chips and other vegetable matter in the cyclone overflow slurry, a linear 

screen is used for trash removal. It is believed that linear screens are more capable of 

dealing with tramp oversize ore that may be associated with a high-density cyclone 

overflow.

The facility to add cyanide to the mills is available. Milling in cyanide can result in an 

increased cyanide consumption and negatively effect gravity gold recovery so that whether 

cyanide is generally added to the mills or the trash screen undersize will need to be a 

management decision determined from plant trials. 

20.7.2 G ravity 

Although a number of options are available for the treatment of gravity gold, redress tabling 

will be used for Agbaou. Redress tabling is easy and inexpensive to operate compared to 

Intensive Leaching of the concentrate. There is no apparent security threat that would 

make handling of free gold a risk. This makes unjustifiable the use of the more expensive 

intensive leaching route for the treatment of gravity concentrate. 

20.7.3 E lution 

On the basis of achieving a carbon loading of 1500 times the maximum CIL solution gold 

grade associated with complete leaching, it is estimated that approximately 10 tonnes per 

day of loaded carbon is produced. 

Designing the elution circuit for a 6 tonne batch permits the operation to be sustained on 

approximately 25 elutions / month although the rate of elution can be accelerated above 

this if required. An elution period of about 17 hours is envisaged so that 3 elutions every 

two days should be possible and this could be further increased by shortening the elution / 

electrowinning time. 

A standard pressure Zadra circuit is selected as the capital costs and operating cost per 

tonne of carbon eluted is calculated to be substantially lower than a comparably sized 

AARL circuit. 

20.7.4 G old R oom 

A diesel fired smelting furnace is suitable for smelting both the cathode and gravity 

concentrates. 

The strongroom is to hold bullion bars awaiting despatch, samples and other high value 

items. The door will be equipped with a dual key facility requiring both key holders to be 

present before it is opened and have a time lock facility.

alarms and automatic control loops provided for the plant and will be installed in process 

control cubicles (PCC) located in the motor control centre (MCC) rooms. 

Field instruments will be wired back to input/output cards in the PLC rack.  PLCs and 

instruments shall be supplied from an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which will 

provide approximately 20 minutes backup in the event of a complete power failure.  This 

will permit an orderly shutdown of the control system. 

As applicable, variable speed drives (VSDs), e.g. for the mill pumps, will be installed in the 

relevant MCC buildings. 

Smoke and/or thermal fire detection system will be installed in each motor control centre 

building connected to a fire alarm siren system. 

Operator interface to the PLC, drives and control loops is via a Personal Computer (PC) 

based Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (hereafter called the "SCADA") system.  
The plant areas are presented in graphic form on the SCADA PC display.  Each SCADA 

PC can display all drives statuses and current values of instruments in the plant.  The 

SCADA PC's will have Alarm pages that allow the operator to monitor all alarm conditions 

in the plant.  

Instrumentation such as level, pressure and flow measurement, and control valves will be 

provided to allow the plant to operate as automatically as possible, consistent with 

maintenance requirements and the piping and instrumentation diagrams.  Equipment and 

systems commonly in use in the gold mining industry will be supplied and only loops and 

sequences providing a tangible benefit in operability will be installed. 

The typical layout of the SCADA graphic pages is as follows:

Remote starting and stopping of most major equipment is provided from the PLC operator 

interface if the selected drive is put into SCADA mode.  All drives have a start and lockable 

stop button station at the motor.  The stop button acts as an emergency stop regardless of 

the control mode adopted and a lockout facility is provided in the MCC'S as well via 

individual door interlock mechanisms on each motor feeder. 

External field located breakers are provided for the mills and crushers.  The duty electrician 

locks the drive out in MCC and the operators lock out at the field breaker.  This is to stop 

too many people entering the MCC and allows operators to safely lock out an item at the 

field breaker without calling out an electrician, who holds MCC key after hours, for minor 

stoppage i.e. not for reline maintenance.  The field breaker is not to be used as an 

emergency stop as the breaker cannot be safely used to disconnect the power supply 

under load. 

The start button is used by the operators to start the selected drive only if it is put into 

FIELD mode.  Switch over from FIELD to SCADA and vice versa is performed at the 

SCADA operator interface by a faceplate for each unit opened by clicking on the unit's 

symbol. 

Equipment that is not required to be, or is impractical to be operated remotely from the 

SCADA will only be operable in field mode.  This will include: 

 All cranes and hoists. 

 All auxiliary drives at crushers, apron feeders and mills, e.g. lubrication systems.

to indicate when they are running. 

All cranes and hoists are fitted with hand held remote control operating keypad and a 

continuous audible siren will sound when the hoist is travelling. 

As well as the standard start and stop button, selected spillage pump sumps are fitted with 

low-level switches to stop the spillage pump automatically. All spillage pumps are started 

manually by the local start/stop centre, but switch off automatically by the low level switch. 

cyanide and ammonia gas monitors are located at the top of CIL tanks, above the acid 

wash cone and elution column, near the electrowinning cells, at the cyanide mixing and 

storage tanks and the tails tank.  A hydrogen gas monitor is installed near the 

electrowinning cells to alarm should the level of hydrogen gas form a potentially explosive 

mixture. 

A flow switch and pressure switch is installed on the gland service line to each applicable 

pump to provide an alarm and pop-up warning at the SCADA in the event of low or no flow 

or low pressure. 

Two control rooms will be provided, linked by a telephone - a satellite control room at the 

crushers and stockpile areas while the main plant control room is located on top of the main 

MCC.  The crushers and stockpile areas control room's SCADA systems will have access 

to view all SCADA pages and the information reported but will not have access to any 

controls.  They will in effect be VIEW only terminals.  The crusher and stockpile control 

room will house the proprietary secondary and tertiary crusher automated setting control 

systems.  A VIEW only terminal will also be provided in the plant managers' office. 

The Crushers and Stockpile area control room will be equipped with one personal computer

The hard rock primary crushing station at Tipping Bin 1(10-BIN-01) is supervised by an 

area operator in the crusher cabin. 

A green traffic light visible to the truck or FEL driver is displayed at the ROM tip when the 

crushing system is on-line and when it is possible to dump, i.e. the level in the Primary 

Crusher Surge Bin (10-BIN-01) is low enough.  A red traffic light is displayed when it is not 

OK to dump.  A similar light installed at the soft rock Tipping Bin (10-BIN-04).  

The speed of Apron Feeder 1 (10-APF-01) is controlled by the measured tonnage on 

Conveyor C1 as measured by the Crusher Belt Weigher 1 (10-MMT-01) or the level in the 

Secondary Bin (10-BIN-02). 

The Secondary Bin (10-BIN-02) is equipped with a level element used optionally to control 

the feed to crushing plant.  A high level alarm will trip the Apron Feeder (10-APF-01) if the 

bin is full. 

The Tertiary Bin (10-BIN-03) is equipped with a level element used optionally to control the

20.8.3 L ime S ilo and S toc kpile 

Lime addition to the mill feed is controlled using variable speed Screw Feeders (10-FDS-01 

& 02) delivering onto the respective mill feed conveyors (C7 and C8).  If either belt runs 

empty, a low tonnage alarm in the PLC will stop the respective feeder to prevent lime being 

added onto an empty belt. 

The feed rate of material reclaimed from the mill stockpile to feed ball mill 1 is controlled by 

Mill 1 Belt Weigher (10-MMT-04) on Conveyor C7 (10-CVR-07) that adjusts the speed of 

Stockpile Feeders 1 to 4 (10-FDR-04 to 07). 

The feed rate of material reclaimed from the mill stockpile to feed ball mill 2 is controlled by 

Mill 2 Belt Weigher (10-MMT-05) on Conveyor C8 (10-CVR-08) that adjusts the speed of 

Stockpile Feeders 4 to 8 (10-FDR-08 to 11). 

The feed rate of soft rock from the tooth roll crusher is measured on conveyor C5 by the 

Oxide Belt Weigher (10-MMT-03).  Mill 1 can therefore be fed any desired blend of any 

combination of crushed hard rock from the mill stockpile and soft rock from tipping bin 2. 

The Lime Silo Vibrator (10-VIB-01) operates on a timer.  The lime bin is mounted on a load 

cell.

The number of operating stockpile feeders is selected from the SCADA and if more than 

one is running the speed of them is synchronised and adjusted to control the hard rock mill 

feed rate. 

The Stockpile Spillage Pump (10-PMP-01) sump is fitted with low-level switches to stop the 

pump automatically. The pump is started manually by the locally stop start station.

20.8.4 Milling 

No thickener is included in the plant and hence control of water addition into the milling 

circuit is of critical importance in maintaining the minimum target slurry density of 

approximately 40% solids in the cyclone overflow slurry. 

A level switch is installed in both ball mill 1 and 2 feed chutes to trip conveyor C8 or C9 

respectively if the chute chokes. 

The Mill Sump (20-TNK-01) levels are measured by ultrasonic level elements that control 

the respective operating mill pump variable speed to give a fixed sump level via a PID loop 

in the PLC.  The mill pump deliveries are equipped with a flow diversion valve, where the 

delivery lines of the duty and standby pipes combine into the cyclone cluster feed pipe. 

The cyclone feed lines are equipped with a manual drain valve, to drain the line contents to 

the mill bunded area in the event of a stoppage, so that settlement does not block the line. 

Mill feed end water addition is controlled by adjusting the position of an actuated valve to 

give the required flow.  The flow is measured by a magnetic flow meter on the mill inlet end 

water pipe and adjusted to match the set point calculated from a ratio applied to the mill 

feed tonnage measured by the Mill Belt Weigher (10-MMT-01 or 02).  

A nuclear density element is installed on the cyclone cluster feed line for optional control of 

sump dilution water.  Volumetric flow measurement by magnetic flow meter is installed on 

the cyclone cluster feed lines.

Page 173 

The density and flow meters will have local display of instantaneous density and volumetric 

flow.  The displays will be repeated on the SCADA system.  The density and the volumetric 

flow to the cyclone are used to calculate the mass flow in dry tons.  This is fed to the 

SCADA that determines the circulating load ratio by comparison with the integrated feed 

rate signal from the respective mill belt weigher.  This feed rate is normally adjusted by a 

preset factor to compensate for the moisture content of crushed ore.  The circulating load is 

expressed as a percentage and is calculated as follows 

Circulating load  =  (Cyclone Feed Tons - Mill Feed Dry Tons) x 100% 
  Mill Feed Dry Tons 

 

If the mill feed tons are 170 tph and the cyclone feed tonnage is 594.7 tph, the circulating 

load is 257%. The mass flow unit will be installed on a vertical section of pipe at least 10 

pipe diameters after and 5 pipe diameters before any constriction valve, bend or feature in 

the pipe that may cause a disturbance in the slurry flow. 

Mill sump water addition is controlled by mill sump dilution flow control valve which 

operates in a feedback control look with densitometer on the cyclone feed line. The target 

cyclone feed density is set in the PLC (via SCADA interface) and the flow control valve will 

adjust the water flow to the mill sump to maintain the density close to the set point. 

A diaphragm-protected gauge the cyclone cluster manifold measures the cyclone pressure 

and a pressure transducer is also installed and indicates the operating pressure at the 

SCADA. 

The operator controls the cyclone pressure within a range by observing the reading and 

opening/closing cyclone feed valves either from the SCADA or manually at the control 

panel located near the cluster.  The individual cyclone isolation valves are equipped with 

limit switches to display at the SCADA which cyclones are open.  In addition the PLC 

shows the total number of open cyclones on the cluster on the SCADA display. 

Cyanide is added to the trash screen underflow in leach/CIL Splitter Box (30-SPT-01) from 

the variable speed Cyanide Dosing Pump 1 or 2 (80-PMP-01 or 02).  The speed of the 

pump is adjusted by the totalised mill feed tonnage as measured by the combination of the 

measured tonnages from Mill 1 Belt Weigher (10-MMT-04) and Mill 2 Belt Weigher (10-

MMT-05).  A low tonnage alarm on the summation of the belt weighers will stop cyanide 

addition by tripping the cyanide dosing pump.

As a safety measure, a pH probe is installed on the trash screen feed box, with an audible 

alarm generated if the measured pH drops 1 pH unit below set point and the cyanide 

addition is stopped by tripping the cyanide dosing pump. 

Gland service water is provided at the mill pumps.  A pressure gauge is installed at each 

set of pumps. The individual pump gland water lines are equipped with manually adjustable 

flow regulation valves. 

The mill spillage pump sumps are fitted with low-level switches to stop the pump 

automatically. Spillage pumps are started locally at the stop/start station. 

A switch is installed in the cyclone cluster underflow launder overflow pipe to detect flow 

and provide an alarm and pop-up warning at the SCADA if an underflow launder is 

overflowing.

20.8.5 G ravity 

The gravity start sequence can only be initiated when the Milling section is operational, but 

can be stopped at any time.  If the concentrator trips, the feed pinch valve to the 

concentrator from the scalping screen closes and the bypass valve opens.  Each gravity 

concentrator is controlled by a vendor supplied control system.  This is a stand-alone unit 

mounted in the control room and links to the main plant PLC/SCADA but manipulation of 

gravity concentrator process variables is only possible at the vendor supplied control 

system user interface. 

The Redress Spillage Pump (23-PMP-01) sump is fitted with low-level switch to stop the 

pump automatically when the sump level gets low. The pump is started locally by the 

stop/start station. 

Excess water is decanted from the concentrate tank by opening an actuated valve on a 

decant pipe after a pre-set time delay after a flush cycle, to ensure the concentrate settles 

to the cone of the tank.  Concentrate tanks are fitted with load cells. 

The gravity redressing room is covered by the gold room video surveillance system 

incorporating sufficient closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras located and cabled to the 

mine security offices for recording.  The cameras will cover at least the following views: 

 All access doors. 

 Redress table and table tail pump. 

 Concentrate tank 

The gold room alarm system will cover the gravity redressing room area with passive 

motion detection, door proximity switches and a system arming/disarming keypad 

transmitting to the mine security offices.  The alarm system will be armed whenever the 

gravity redressing room is vacated.

20.8.6 Water 

Raw water is pumped from the Raw Water Dam (70-PND-01) to various sections of the 

plant through two Strainers (70-STN-01 or 02) using one of the two Raw Water Pumps (70-

PMP-07 or 08). The raw water dam is equipped with level measuring device. A low level 

alarm shows on SCADA if the level in the dam falls below a set level.  A low-low-level will 

trip all the pumps drawing from the pond.  As the raw water pond is provided for storage of 

water used for fluidising at the centrifugal gravity concentrators a low-level will also close 

the concentrator feed valves (PD23101-V-13 & 07) and open the bypass valves (PD23101-

V-12 & 08) before low tripping the gravity water pumps. 

Filtered raw water is used for gland water, potable water, dust suppression; high pressure 

washers, reagents make up, elution and acid wash, and for eluted carbon transfer. 

An off take from the main filtered water header feeds the Gland Water Tank (70-TNK-01) 

via a float valve. Clarified Water Tank (71-TNK-01) is equipped with a level sensor which 

closes the actuated isolation valve on the Clarifier (71-CLR-01) feed line once the level in 

the tank reaches a set high level. The level controller opens the actuated control valve once 

the level falls below a set minimum. 

The Potable Water Tank (71-TNK-02) is equipped with a high and low level switch. The 

high-low level switch trips the Sand Filter Feed Pumps (71-PMP-01 or 02) when the level in 

the potable water tank is higher than a set high level, and starts the pump when the level 

falls below a set minimum.

 A low-low-level will trip the Potable Water Pump (71-PMP-03 or 04).   

The main header that supplies all safety showers is connected to a Safety Reserve Tank 

(71-TNK -03) located at the highest point of the processing plant. A float valve on the safety 

shower water header controls the levels of the tank. 

The gland water tank, provided for storage of raw water used for gland service at the mill 

and tailings pumps, is equipped with a level measurement device.  Low-level alarms at the 

SCADA trips conveyors C7 and C8.  A low-low level will then trip the gland water pumps. 

The mill and tails gland water pump delivery mains are equipped with pressure gauges. 

Gland water lines connecting to individual pumps are equipped with a flow manual 

regulating valve for adjusting the gland water flow to the pumps. A pressure transducer 

gives a low pressure alarm on SCDA. 

Fire Hydrant Pumps (70-PMP-04) (electric), and the diesel Fire Hydrant Pump (70-PMP-05) 

supply the fire hydrant. The Booster Pump (70-PMP-06) pressurises the fire hydrants 

water.   

The Process Water Pond (70-PND-02) is equipped with a level measurement device.  A 

Low level alarms in the PLC.  A low-low-level will trip all the pumps drawing from the pond.   

Process Water Pump (70-PMP-13 or 14) deliver process water required for milling and 

gravity.  

Spray water to mill trommel screens and all wet screens and plant hosing water is delivered 

from the process water by either of the two Spray Water Pumps (70-PMP-15 or 16).

more frequently depending on the loadings.  After each loaded carbon transfer, the 

operator must do manual interstage carbon transfers to correct the carbon concentrations 

in the rest of the CIL tanks. 

Plant operators take CIL feed and tailings samples every two to four hours.  These samples

The CIL Office/Lab is split into three rooms each with an external access door.  The first is 

provided for the main plant control room and SCADA terminals, the second is a shift 

laboratory ad the thirds (with a lockable door) is the room reserved for the installation of the 

future Cyanide Analyser (30-CNA-01).  The cyanide analyser will sample the first and last 

CIL tanks and perform automatic titrations for free cyanide levels in the slurry and can be 

used to control the CIL cyanide addition. 

The CIL laboratory is fitted with a bench and double bowl stainless steel sink (by MDM) and 

equipped (by Etruscan Resources Ltd) with suitable laboratory equipment, e.g. burettes, 

beakers, measuring cylinders, screens, pH measurement device, filtration funnels, etc. 

The CIL spillage pump sumps are fitted with low-level switches to stop the pumps 

automatically. The pumps are started manually by the local stop/start centre. 

CIL tanks are interconnected by pipes from overflow of the one upstream to enter the next 

tank at about 1/3 of the height below the overflow. This reduces the chances of short 

circuiting in the CIL circuit. Each tank is equipped with some bypass lines which allows a 

tank to be put off line without affecting the functioning of the rest of the circuit. Tank 

selection is done by means of plug valves placed on the overflow of the individual tanks. 

Cyanide addition to CIL Tank 1 (30-TNK-02) is controlled automatically by Cyanide 

Analyser (30-CNA-01).  Manually operated cyanide "spiking" valves are provided to dose 

extra sodium cyanide solution into CIL Tanks 2, 3 and 4 (30-TNK-03/04/05). 

If a CIL tank is to be taken offline for removal of an interstage screen for washing or for 

maintenance purposes, a hand operated spindle mounted plug valve is used to close the 

feed to the selected tank from the 2 way interconnecting piping.  The hand operated spindle 

mounted plug valve feeding the next tank downstream is opened. 

Switches are installed in the CIL tank overflow boxes to detect flow and provide an alarm 

and pop-up warning at the SCADA if a CIL tank is overflowing.

20.8.9 E lution 

The Elution Tank (40-TNK-01) is equipped with a level measurement device.  This is 

interlocked to close the temperature control valve to the Tank Heater (40-HTR-03) at low-

level and the Elution Pump (40-PMP-01 or 02) at low-low-level.  The elution pumps are 

mono-pumps and cannot be run dry. 

The level measurement loop will also trip the Elution Cyanide Pump (80-PMP-04) and 

Caustic Pump (80-PMP-06) at high-high-level to avoid unnecessary overflowing of the tank. 

Water addition to the elution tank to make-up fresh eluant solution is controlled by a manual 

valve. 

The Elution Tank (40-TNK-01) is also equipped with a temperature measurement device.  

This is used to control the position of the temperature control valve to Elution Tank Heater 

(40-HTR-03) to maintain the desired eluant temperature in the tank. 

The elution column outlet is equipped with temperature gauge as well as a temperature 

measurement device.  This is used to control the elution heating system. 

The elution column is equipped with a pressure gauge as well as a pressure transducer 

indicating at the SCADA display. 

The heater system is automated and each unit has a local control panel.  The thermal oil 

circuit involves circulation of oil through the heaters and to the primary heat exchanger, 

where heat transfer to eluate solution occurs and oil flows back via the de-

aeration/expansion system to the heater. 

Each thermic oil heater panel controls the burner in 2-stage firing sequence: High-Fire, 

Low-Fire or OFF.  Each thermic oil heater controls temperature via thermocouple on the 

inlet and outlet manifolds measuring: INLET, OUTLET, LIMIT and MODULATION

Page 188 

temperatures set manually on digital controllers situated on the front of each control panel.  

Typically, the unit switches to high or low fire, in accordance to the modulation controller, 

placed either on the inlet or outlet, to regulate the firing rate.  Inlet and Outlet controllers 

switch the unit off on activation.  The limit unit supply is purely a maximum oil temperature 

limit, which is lockable and situated inside the panel to avoid external tampering. 

Main control of temperature between this thermic oil heater circuit and the primary heat 

exchanger is a very important 3-way actuated valve.  The 3-way valve diverts hot oil flow to 

or bypassing the heat exchanger.  The actuator is pneumatic to allow for a speedy 

actuation of the valve in accordance with the temperature controller on the elution column.  

The valve is fitted with a single-stage pneumatic positioner.  The valve modulates, rather 

than being either open or closed. 

Each thermic oil heater skid has a pump feed system for the circulation of thermal oil.  The 

expansion tank low-level alarm switch is connected to the PLC.  This magnetic switch 

warns of low oil level in the expansion tank. 

Control of the burner is via photoelectric cell thermic oil, which monitors flame.  Should any 

particular problem occur related to combustion, the burner trips to SAFETY lockout and a 

manual reset is required inside the panel as well as on the front door.  This is to ensure a 

physical inspection of the burner and its various components to remedy the reason for 

flame failure. 

Heat exchangers are equipped with pressure and temperature dial gauges on each inlet 

and outlet.

20.8.10 R egeneration 

The Regeneration section operates intermittently depending on the availability and activity 

of eluted carbon and the requirements for regenerated carbon to be added to the CIL 

circuit.  The kiln has maximum capacity of 300 kg/h at the design regeneration temperature 

but may be operated at a lower feed rate if required by slowing down the screw feeder at 

the Vendor's control panel. 

The Eluted Carbon Tank (42-TNK-01) is sized to accommodate a 6 tonne batch of carbon 

transferred from the elution column.  Regeneration is performed as a manually controlled 

sequence.  Operator intervention or acknowledgement is required at various times during 

the sequences, i.e. starting the quench screen, kiln, heater and screw feeder.  Kiln heating 

is controlled by the vendor control package. 

The kiln is supplied with the vendor's instrumentation and control system.  The system is 

designed to display and control the temperature and throughput of carbon at the desired 

parameters.  A floor mounted, front and rear access, mild steel control cubicle 

accommodates the control equipment, batteries and charger unit.  Instrumentation, 

indicators, pushbuttons and selector switches are mounted on the front panel. 

The main controllers for all zones are microprocessor based units with digital temperature 

indication, set point control and alarm set point control.  The alarm setting is utilised to 

control the temperature at which the screw feeder operates.  Temperature measurement is 

obtained from type K thermocouples mounted in the roof of the heating cabinet. 

The over-temperature controllers are mounted inside the control cubicle and are connected 

to the thermocouples mentioned above.  These controllers provide safety shutdown should 

the temperature exceed the present value of the controller.  The heating system is shut 

down and an alarm siren is sounded. 

The shutdown controller is connected to the thermocouple projecting into the rear end of 

the tube and the heated carbon, giving a direct carbon temperature at the end of the 

heating cycle.  The preset temperature on this controller provides the shutdown 

temperature at which the kiln can safely switch off and thus halt the retort tube rotation, 

which is normally in the region of 142° C. 

There is an AUTO / SHUTDOWN / MANUAL switch.  With AUTO selected, the kiln 

commences to rotate and the heating system is started.  At the preset shutdown

temperature, the alarm circuits are activated and at the preset alarm set point the screw 

feeder is switched on and feeds carbon into the tube.  With SHUTDOWN selected, the 

heating system and the screw feeder are switched off and at the preset shutdown-

temperature, the kiln ceases to rotate.  With MANUAL selected, the kiln rotates but the 

heating system will not operate until the tube is rotating and the screw feeder will not 

function until the preset temperature is reached.

20.8.13 T ailings   

Tailings discharging from the CIL gravitate through the Tails Screen (30-LSC-01) (for 

carbon recovery) to the Detox Tanks  (60-TNK-01 and 02) where hydrogen peroxide is 

added at controlled rate to convert residual WAD (Weak Acid Dissociable) cyanide to more 

stable complex capable of being stored in the tailings dam without posing environmental 

hazards. Hydrogen peroxide is pumped from the Hydrogen Peroxide Tank (60-TNK-03) by 

use of the hydrogen peroxide Dosing Pump (60-PMP-04 or 05). Hydrogen peroxide is 

added to Detox Tank 1 (60-TNK-01). A provision has been made to add hydrogen peroxide 

to Detox Tank 2 (60-TNK-02) when detox tank 1 is offline. The partially detoxified slurry 

from tank 1 overflows into tank 2 where the process of detoxification is expected to proceed 

to minimum required levels of residual WAD cyanide. 

The second detox tank also acts as the final tailings sump from which the tailings are 

pumped to the Tailings Storage Facility (61-DAM-01) using Tailings Pumps (60-PMP-01 or 

02). The second Detox Tank (60-TNK-02) is equipped with a level measurement device 

which controls the output to the Tailings Pumps (60-PMP-01 or 02) VSD through a level 

controller to maintain the level in the final detox tank around a set point. 

The tailings line is equipped with an actuated drain valve, to drain the line contents to the 

CIL bunded area in the event of a stoppage, so that settlement does not block the line. 

To account for the tonnage of tailings exiting the plant the Tails Mass Flow Meter (60-MFM-

01) incorporating nuclear slurry density measurement and volumetric flow measurement by 

magnetic flow meter is installed on the tails pump delivery pipeline. 

The tails mass flow meter will have local display of instantaneous density and volumetric 

flow.  The displays will be repeated on the SCADA system.  The density and the volumetric 

flow are used to calculate the mass flow in dry tons.  The mass flow unit will be installed on 

a vertical section of pipe at least 10 pipe diameters after and 5 pipe diameters before any 

constriction valve, bend or feature in the pipe that may cause a disturbance in the slurry 

flow.  A bypass facility is installed to isolate the mass flow unit in case maintenance or zero 

calibration is required.  Both bypass and normal pipe legs are equipped with 2 x 50 mm NB 

flush/drain/fill points isolated with saunders type valves. 

A pressure transducer is also installed on the tailings delivery line after tails mass flow 

meter and indicates the operating pressure at the SCADA.  A low pressure alarm is 

provided to warn of a no or low flow situation that may indicate a leak in the tailings line has 

occurred.

Reagent makeup is done by operators on day shift whenever possible. 

Cyanide is added to the CIL slurry from the Cyanide Dosing Pump 1 or 2 (80-PMP-02 or 3) 

via the cyanide ring main.  A Cyanide Analyser (30-CNA-01) is installed to measure and 

control the free cyanide levels in the first CILTank (30-TNK-02 or 03) and last CIL tank (30-

TNK-06 or 07). The cyanide controller has a local panel which shows the free cyanide in 

the streams being sampled as well as the pH. The cyanide analyser displays are duplicated 

on SCADA. The cyanide analyser controls free cyanide levels in the tanks by controlling the 

speed of the cyanide dosing pumps. A flow control valve on the feed to the first CIL tank 

(30-TNK-02 or 03) will be used to do the final tuning of cyanide addition.  

The Cyanide Mixing Tank (80-TNK-01) is equipped with a level measurement device.  This 

is interlocked to the Cyanide Mixer (80-AGT-01) to trip at low tank level and the Cyanide 

Transfer Pump (80-PMP-01) at low-low-level. 

The Cyanide Storage Tank (80-TNK-02) is equipped with a level measurement device 

indicating at the SCADA display.  This is interlocked to the Cyanide Dosing Pump 1 or 2 

(80-PMP-02 or 03) and the Elution Cyanide Dosing Pump (80-PMP-04) to trip at low tank 

level to avoid the pumps running dry. The level controller also trips the Cyanide Transfer 

Pump (80-PMP-01) at high tank level to prevent overflowing. 

The Caustic Tank (80-TNK-03) is equipped with a level measurement device indicating at 

the SCADA display.  This is interlocked to the Caustic Mixer (80-AGT-02) and Caustic 

Pump (80-PMP-06) to trip them at low tank level.

21.1.1 G eneral 

The TSF design is based on an outer impoundment wall constructed with waste rock 

derived from the open pit mining operation.  The embankment will be constructed by the 

downstream method which facilitates incremental raising as tailings storage requirements 

dictate, and as availability of waste rock from the mining operation permits.  Filters will be 

incorporated in the upstream toe of the starter embankments, and will discharge into a 

solution trench around the perimeter of the facility.  Toe paddocks will collect any runoff 

from the outer slopes of the facility.   

Seepage from the facility will be contained within the TSF footprint by the installation of a 

bentonite slurry trench extending into low permeability clay at a depth of approximately 4m 

below natural ground level, which will be constructed at the upstream toe of the rockfill 

starter wall. 

Tailings will be deposited into the facility by spigotting from a perimeter distribution pipe laid 

around the upstream crest of the starter wall.  Ongoing wall building will be achieved by 

downstream raises of the rockfill embankment The initial wall will be constructed to an 

elevation of 198mamsl, with two subsequent raises of 4m each taking the final crest level to 

20amsl.  The distribution pipeline will be moved up onto the crest of each successive wall 

raise.  The TSF has been designed to have an overall outer slope of 1 vertical to 3 

horizontal, to facilitate rehabilitation of the slope.  The upstream slope is 1:1.5. 

A stacked ring decant will be constructed at the centre of the facility to draw off supernatent 

water.  The decant will be accessed by means of a timber walkway.  The decant outfall pipe 

will be an encased 750mm concrete pipe, discharging into an HDPE lined return water 

pond of 11 520m3 capacity.  The return water pond will incorporate a spillway discharging 

into the natural watercourse for flood events in excess of the 100 year recurrence interval 

storm. 

Geotechnical investigations show a reasonable degree of uniformity across the designated 

area.  The near surface soils comprise typically either a silty sand or silty gravel (in a few 

cases silty clay) overlying hard laterite at depths between 1 and 3m.  In most cases refusal 

was in the laterite. 

Where the test pits were able to penetrate through the laterite, a low plasticity clay was 

encountered below it.

Tailings from the Plant will be distributed around the TSF in a 200mm diameter HDPE 

Class 12 delivery line. 

The volume of process water recovered from the TSF has been derived from the water 

balance for the tailings circuit, which in turn relies on typical South African gold tailings 

moisture retention characteristics, as no laboratory testing has yet been undertaken on 

Agbaou tailings to determine the amount of supernatent water released. 

The Return Water Dam (RWD) will have a capacity of 11 520m3 (equivalent to 3 days plant 

return at an average flow of 160m3/hour).  The return water dam will be lined with HDPE to 

minimise losses. 

Pump capacity will be provided to cater for the full range of dry weather process flow return 

to the plant (160m3/hr) through to stormwater return to the plant (270m3/hr).  The design of 

the return water system is excluded from the scope of this report. 

21.2 B attery L imits  for T S F  Des ign 

The battery limits for the design of the TSF have been defined as follows: 

 The valve slab at the southern corner of the TSF 

 The Return Water Pond 

 The boundary fence around the site of the TSF and Return Water Pond. 

21.3 S ite S elec tion And Ac c es s  T o T he S ite 

The selected TSF site occupies a low lying, poorly drained area north of the proposed plant 

site.  Access to the TSF will be by way of a road constructed from the plant, running north 

toward the southern corner of the facility.  This road will provide a pipe route for the tailings 

delivery and return water pipes. 

Initial site selection for the TSF took into account the following parameters: 

 General topography 

 Distance from the plant 

 Surface geotechnical conditions in the footprint zone 

 Watercourse locations 

 Position in relation to other mine infrastructure 

 Geology of the site

21.4 Hydrology 

The Agbaou project area falls within the tropical climatic zone.  The rainfall data provided in 

this section was measured at the Divo weather station, located approximately 30km from 

the project area since it was believed to be the most representative weather station with a 

reliable rainfall record. 

The rainfall record from Divo consisted of relatively complete data set measured from 1971 

to 2000.  From the records from the Divo weather station, mean annual precipitation (MAP) 

at Agbaou is 1227mm and mean annual evaporation is 1919mm.  The average daytime 

temperature throughout the year is 26°, with an average relative humidity of 80%.  The 

prevailing wind is from the south east. 

Based on the recorded rainfall data, design rainfall (mm) for 5, 10, 30, 50 and 100 year 

return periods were determined.

21.5 G eotechnical Inves tigation 

A geotechnical investigation comprising a grid of 30 test pits was carried out by Etruscan 

Resources.  The pits were excavated by hand and most reached refusal in a layer of hard 

laterite at a depth varying from 1 to 3m.  Typically, the laterite is overlain by either silty 

sands or silty gravels.  It is inferred from TP27 and from previous experience in lateritic 

soils that the laterite lies over a layer of high plasticity clay.  This must be verified across 

the entire sit at detailed design stage.  Samples were taken and particle size distributions 

and foundation indicator tests were carried out.  A summary of the Test pit logging is given 

in the table below.

From the grading analyses an empirical estimate of the permeability of the soil mass can 

be determined from the Hazen formula for sands (K=10D10
2), where k is the permeability in 

mm/s and D10  is the sieve size from the laboratory grading analyses through which 10% of 

the soil sample passes. 

Using the Hazen Formula, the permeabilities of the near surface soils are as follows: 

Silty Gravels  : 1.2 x 10-4 mm/s (1.2 x 10-5 cm/s) 

Silty Clay  : 5.4 x 10-5 mm/s (5.4 x 10-6 cm/s) 

Laterite  : 4.8 x 10-4 mm/s (4.8 x 10-5 cm/s) 

In order to prevent migration of seepage water in the comparatively high permeability near 

surface soils, a bentonite slurry trench will be constructed around the perimeter on the 

facility.  It will be located at the upstream toe of the embankment, below the toe filter.  Refer 

to Drawing No.K5345-10-03. 

21.6 T ailings  Dis tribution And Depos ition 

The average slurry flow rate from the plant will be 360m3/hour (100ℓ/s) once full production 

is achieved.  The pumping distance from the thickeners to the valve slab at the south 

corner of the TSF is approximately 400m.  There is no static head to pump against initially, 

but this will increase to a maximum of 10m when the TSF embankment is raised to its final 

elevation of 210mamsl.  The pipeline length from the valve slab to the furthest point on the 

distribution ring mains is 1550m.  The elevation difference between the valve slab and the 

crest of the impounding embankment is 13m. 

The tailings distribution pipe around the TSF will be 225mm HDPE Class 12 pipe. 

When the tailings pumping system is to be shut down in a controlled manner for 

maintenance, the duty pump(s) and tailings delivery pipeline must be flushed with process 

water. Flushing must be performed until the discharge at the TSF is substantially free of 

solids. 

The following basic interlocks should be provided: 

 Tailings pumps are locked out from operating if suction or delivery isolation valves are 

closed

Page 207 

 Tailings pumps are locked out from running if the corresponding gland water pump is 

not running or if there is no gland water flow to one or more tailings pumps in the 

stream 

 The gland water pumps are interlocked with the gland water tank low level switch, to 

prevent them from running dry. 

21.7 T ailings  Dis pos al Method 

100mm spigot offtakes will be located every 20m around the perimeter of the TSF starter 

wall.  (Refer to Drawing No.K5345-10-05 in the appendices.)  Each offtake will be fitted with 

a valve and a short length of lay-flat hose which will discharge into the TSF basin beyond 

the toe filters to prevent them being damaged or blinded.  As the tailings beach rises, the 

lay flat hoses may become buried and blocked.  They will then be cut off above the level of 

the tailings and deposition will be resumed. 

To prevent erosion of the tailings beach, a minimum of a minimum of 17 spigot points 

should be operational at any time. 

It is currently envisaged that the initial rockfill impounding embankment (crest level 

198mamsl) will be raised in three downstream lifts of 4m each.  The distribution pipe will be 

moved onto the crest of each new outer wall raise and deposition will be continued.  Once 

the crest level of the starter wall has been reached, it will no longer be necessary to make 

use of lay-flat hoses at each spigot point.  Discharge will take place directly from the valved 

offtake onto the tailings beach. 

21.8 T S F  C ons truc tion And Wall R ais ing P roc edure 

The initial rockfill embankment will be constructed to 198mamsl.  This will provide storage 

for the first 2 years of tailings production, after which the first raise (Phase 2) will be 

implemented, increasing the crest level to 202mamsl and providing a further 3 years of 

storage.  Phase 3 will see the crest raised to 206mamsl, and will create storage for the full 

life of mine.  The method of wall raising is shown on drawing No.K5345-10-03 (refer to 

appendices).  The area covered by tailings at the end of each phase is shown in Figures 

21.8-1 to 21.8-3.  Stage /capacity and Rate of Rise Curves are shown in Figure 21.8-4. 

The impounding embankment will comprise waste rock overburden from the open pit, with 

a zone of selected, finer, well graded waste rock on the upstream face of the embankment 

varying from 16m wide at the foundation to 10m wide at the crest.  Tailings deposited 

against the upstream face of the embankment will form a low permeability seal.  Care must 

be taken in selecting the upstream zone of fill material to ensure that there is no migration

of material either from the tailings into the fill zone or from the upstream fill zone into the 

coarser downstream random rockfill zone.  The downstream slope will be 1:3 overall, with 

individual slopes between benches at 1:2.5.  The upstream face of the embankment will be 

constructed at a slope of 1:1.5.

A bentonite slurry trench extending from the surface down to low permeability clay 

underlying the laterite will be constructed at the upstream toe of the embankment. 

A filter will be constructed at the upstream toe of the rockfill embankment to drain pore 

water and assist with consolidation of the tailings.  Outlets from this filter will discharge into 

the solution trench and from there to the return water pond. 

Outer toe paddocks will be constructed outside the impounding embankment to collect 

runoff from the outer slopes of the facility. 

21.9 Water Management 

21.9.1 Dec anting and return water 

The decanting arrangement is a gravity penstock comprising twin 510mm ID stacked ring 

intake towers feeding into a single outlet pipe discharging into the return water dam.  In 

normal operating conditions, this water will be returned directly to the plant for re-use at a 

rate of 160m3/hr.  

After heavy rain, stormwater will be retained on the TSF and will then be gradually returned 

to the plant for re-use at a rate of up to 270m3/hr  

The return water pumps and pipeline will be sized to handle up to 270m3/hr.  This will draw 

down the excess water stored on the facility over a period of one month.  The rockfill 

embankments around the TSF will ensure that there will always be sufficient freeboard to 

store this water safely. 

The return water pipeline will incorporate cross connections to the tailings delivery pipeline 

at the tailings pump station and at the valve slab at the south corner of the TSF to facilitate 

flushing of the tailings line.

The capacity of the return water dam has been derived as 11 520m3, equivalent to three 

days plant consumption at an average flow of 160m3/hr (average return water derived from 

the water balance). 

The TSF filter drain outlets discharge into a solution trench which runs around the 

perimeter of the TSF, and delivers the filter discharge water into the return water pond. 

21.9.2 S urfac e water management 

The surface water drainage is designed to separate clean and dirty water run-off.  

Surface runoff from the outer slopes of the TSF will be collected in toe paddocks and 

allowed to evaporate. 

An unlined diversion canal is proposed to direct the flows from three upstream catchments 

around the eastern side of the TSF.  Calculations to determine the water depth in an 

unlined trapezoidal channel were carried out using the UPD Software.  The flow depth was 

calculated for a peak discharge of 77.1m3/s based on a channel slope of 1:1000 and a 

Manning's roughness of 0.028.  The canal has a bottom width of 6.0m and 1:3 side slopes. 

For a flow rate of 77.1m3/s, the normal depth is 3.034m with a Froude number of 0.39.  If 

an allowance of 10% for groundwater seepage is added together with a 0.3m freeboard, 

the minimum depth for the trapezoidal channel will be 3.64m.  The canal dimensions and 

the water depth are shown in Figure 21.9-1. 

Figure 21.9-1Flow depth in the unlined Trapezoidal Diversion Canal 
 

Bends in the canal alignment could lead to higher velocities on the outside of the bend with 

possible erosion of the channel sides.  The canal bed slope of 1:1000 results in subcritical 

flow and low velocities in the range of 1.68m/s, which reduces the possibility of scouring.

21.9.3 S tability analys is  

The earthquake risk potential in the Agbaou area is low.  A dynamic stability evaluation has 

been undertaken to analyse numerous computer-generated failure surfaces and to identify 

the critical surfaces, using the Bishop Simplified method.  A Peak Ground Acceleration 

value (PGA) of 0.1g (roughly equivalent to the 950 year return period event) was applied in 

the simulation.  The computer program Slide, Version 5.029, from Rocscience was used to 

determine the factor of safety (FoS) for development of a circular slip failure. 

Table 21.9-1 presents the material properties that were used during the analysis and 

Table 21.9-2 presents the results of the different analyses that were conducted.

During the analysis the limits of the slip surface were varied in order to obtain deeper failure 

surfaces than surface slumps.  Rev 01 and Rev 02 are essentially surface slumps.  By 

forcing the slip surface deeper minimum factors of safety of 2.61 and 3.27 were obtained 

for Rev 03 and Rev 04 respectively.  A further analysis was conducted with the addition of 

a seismic loading which resulted in factors of safety of 1.94 and 2.24 respectively for Rev 

03 and Rev 04.  The Factors of Safety that were obtained during the analysis are all above 

1.3 which is considered adequate for an active tailings storage facility.

21.10 R is k C omment And Mitigation 

In terms of SANS 10286 Section 7.4.1 the safety classification for the TSF at Agbaou Gold 

is "High Hazard", based on the following criteria: 

Number of residents in the Zone of Influence : <10 (Low Hazard) 

Number of workers in the Zone of Influence : 11-100 (Med Hazard) 

Value of 3rd Party Property in the Zone of Influence : >R20million (High Hazard) 

Depth to underground mine workings : >200m (Low Hazard) 

The "High Hazard" rating stems from the fact that the Zone of Influence encompasses a 

significant portion of the Plant.  The Zone of Influence is shown in Figure 21.10-1. 

Figure 21.10-1Zone of Influence for the TSF 
 

 

21.11 Monitoring Of Operations  

Quarterly inspections of the facility by a suitably qualified person and the compilation of an 

annual report on the construction and operation of the facility is strongly recommended.  

The focus of the quarterly inspections and annual reporting on the facility will be to ensure 

that: 

 The facility is being constructed and operated in accordance with the design 

requirements; 

 Seepage and slope stability models of the facility are periodically reviewed and updated 

as necessary; 

 Ensuring safe working practices by the operator; 

 Ongoing rehabilitation of the facility is kept up to date and that routine maintenance 

activities are carried out by the operator; 

 Monitoring information relevant to the TSF is collected and analysed.  Information is 

expected to be collected as part of the overall environmental management function for 

the mine which should include: 

 Collection and analysis of groundwater samples from up and down slope of the TSF; 

 Collection and analysis of surface water samples from the return water dam;

 Collection and analysis of dust samples from up and down wind of the facility. 

21.12 R ehabilitation, C los ure And Afterc are 

Rehabilitation and closure works that will take place concurrently with the construction of 

the facility will include stripping and stockpiling of topsoil from the site for use in the 

rehabilitation and closure process.  Being a downstream constructed rockfill embankment, 

no rehabilitation work will be able to be carried out on the outer slopes of the facility until 

the Phase 3 wall raise has been completed.  The overall outer slope will be 1:3. with 

intermediate slopes between benches at 1:2.5 

It is expected that decommissioning, rehabilitation and closure of the facility at the 

cessation of operations will include the following: 

 Removal of the slurry delivery and return water pumps and pipelines and all associated 

works,  

 Removal of the synthetic liner from and landscaping of the return water pond,  

 Upgrading the toe paddocks around the facility to ensure the containment of surface 

water runoff, 

 Construction of contoured surface water control berms to prevent the accumulation of 

runoff in the lower lying areas on top of the facility, 

 Placement of a soil cover to the top surface of the facility and the establishment of 

vegetation on the area 

 Aftercare and maintenance of the site is expected to comprise the repair of localised 

erosion gulleys and the maintenance of vegetation for a period of 3 to 5 years after 

completion of the rehabilitation and closure works described above.  Monitoring of 

surface and groundwater quality in the area is likely to be required to continue for a 

period of up to 30 years.  

 The cost of the rehabilitation and closure process as described above is expected to be 

of the order of R250 000/ha for the top surface of the facility and R65 000/ha for the 

sloped areas.

22.1 Introduc tion 

This section describes the services being provided to the plant and camp, including water 

(potable and raw water), power supply, all roads on the plant and camp sites (excluding 

haul roads), all camp and plant block-work buildings (including kitchens, accommodation, 

plant and camp offices), sewerage and solid waste disposal.  Also included and described 

in this document are telephone and radio communications, plant and camp fire protection, 

construction of a gravel link road between the Agbaou plant site and the existing gravel 

access road to Agbaou village; transport to and from the site, as well as vehicles for use on 

the site, the fuel storage facility, plant and camp security. All buildings of structural steel 

construction have been priced as part of the main plant, this includes plant stores and 

workshops including reagents storage and the plant laboratory. 

The plant site is situated approximately 240 kilometres northwest of the port city of Abidjan 

in Côte d'Ivoire.  It is readily accessible by a paved highway and is within 10 kilometres of 

the national power grid.  

Generally the erection and installation of steelwork piping and valves, mechanical 

equipment and electrical equipment will be done using local field labour supervised by 

expatriates experienced in this work. The steelwork and piping will be fabricated in South 

Africa and transported to site for erection. 

Certain West African companies have been identified as being capable of providing the 

necessary services and resources for the Project, as well as ongoing services for the 

mining project, these would include but not be limited to civil construction, buildings, 

earthworks and road works.  Local content will be maximised in order to demonstrate 

Etruscan Resources Inc. commitment to the Ivoirian community. 

22.2 Water S upply (P otable, Make-up And F ire Water S ys tems ) 

Maximum demand usage requirements for the project are assessed as 1,500,000m3/year; 

this includes a 10% contingency. Water requirements for the project will come from a series 

of borehole pumps used for pit dewatering.  There will also be a raw water dam situated at 

the head of the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) which will be used to contain seasonal water 

from the local streams.  A portion of this water will be used for plant make up water and the 

balance will be diverted around the TSF.  The excess water will enter a storm water canal 

and be diverted around the TSF and back into the local water system.  There is more than 

sufficient water available for the plant and other site usage.

An assessment of the baseline environmental and social conditions on site was conducted 

from December 2007 to July 2008. A baseline study area was delineated as the most likely 

area for physical impacts to occur on the environment. The affected area over which 

impacts occur on the socio-economic environment is much wider. The baseline study was 

conducted by African Mining Consultants (AMC) in conjunction with CECAF International, 

an Ivorian consulting company of specialists based in Abidjan. 

The topography of the site consists of undulating hills with some low lying valleys along 

main drainage courses. There are five hills in the project area, two of which are the 

identified orebodies of Agbaou Main and Agbaou Main South. The hills range in elevation 

from 200m amsl to 330m amsl and the lowest elevation is 170m amsl. The Gbadjo Stream 

flows in the west of the project area. The Akegla Stream, a tributary of the Gbadjo Stream, 

flows to the east of Agbaou Main. The general drainage direction off site is to the southeast 

towards the Bandama River.  

Côte d'Ivoire is part of western Africa bordering the North Atlantic Ocean. The country is in 

the Guinean climate belt (sub-equatorial). The St. Helena air mass travels northwards with 

fresh air and precipitation. The sub-tropical Acore air mass that extends from the Sahara 

moves southwards and brings hot and dry weather. Three seasons are experienced in the 

region:- warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May) and hot and wet 

(June to October). The Harmattan winds are generated between November and March 

which are often very dusty. Rainfall occurs throughout the year with a mean annual rainfall 

of 1,235.4mm in Divo (50km southwest). The wettest month is June and the driest months 

are January and December. Temperatures range from 10°C to 38°C. The average monthly 

windspeed (Lamto) is 2.6m/s with a wind direction from the south and southwest. Average 

annual evaporation (Lamto) is 892.7mm. 

Thunderstorms may occur in March and September with strong winds, lightning and heavy 

rainfall. The maximum daily rainfall for the 50 year storm is 148mm (Divo) and the 100 year 

storm is 163mm (Divo). Bush fires may be caused by lightning strikes or shifting cultivation. 

Agbaou is considered to have a very low hazard (0 to 0.2m/s2) of seismic activity according 

to the Seismic Hazard Map of Africa (G. Grünthal, C. Bosse, Geoforschungs Zentrum, 

Potsdam, Germany). 

The Oumé-Fetekro Greenstone Belt, of Birimian Age, is the host rock of the Agbaou gold 

deposit. The rocks are predominantly deformed mafic volcanics which have 

metamorphosed into greenschist facies. The greenstone belt is folded into an anticline with

the Agbaou deposits near the hinge of the fold. Bedding, foliation and the dominant vein-set 

are oriented along the strike of the fold (roughly NE-SW) with a dip to the SE. The deposit 

lies within meta-volcanic rocks in the east and metasedimentary rocks in the west 

separated by a northeast striking shear zone. A 10m layer of laterite overlies a thick 

saprolite layer (10m to 120m) with the majority of the deposit found in the underlying 

saprock (10m to 20m) at a depth below surface of 70m. The bedrock consists of foliated 

and silicified meta-volcanic rocks, meta-sediments, tuff and lesser mylonite. The bedrock 

contains fractures, joints, foliation, quartz veins and shearing, which contained 

combinations of calcite, quartz or sulphide. The area of exploration interest is contained in 

the mesothermal auriferous sulphide which consists of pyrite and pyrrhotite with quartz vein 

style mineralisation. The gold mineralisation is hosted over a broad area of quartz-vein 

types, brecciation, boudinage and sericitic and carbonate alteration. The Main Shear zone 

and the fault between Agbaou Main and Agbaou Main-South deposits are the two 

structures identified during exploration. 

Soil development in the project area is encouraged by local climatic conditions through 

hydrolysis. The soils in the project area are thick ferrallitic, according to the French 

classification system. The bedrock consists of schistic and weathered products generally 

with a high proportion of silt and coarse material, gravel and quartz fragments. A high level 

of soil moisture occurs and offsets the limiting factors generated by the large volume of 

coarse material (freely draining). The five soil types identified on the project area are ferric 

ferralsols (generally), endoplinthic cambisols (around Peterkro in the northeast and 

northwest of the project), mollic ferralsols (in the south around Abdoulayekro and Agbahou 

Main South and west of Amanikro), mollic cambisols (in the west around Bloc) and umbric 

gleysols (along watercourses). The location of soils in the upper, middle and lower slopes 

affects the levels of soil genesis. The soil texture over the site consists of clays and silts 

(mollic ferralsols and endoplinthic cambisols), fine clays (mollic cambisol) or a mixture of 

textures. The soils on the site all contain high levels of iron, with aluminium, calcium and 

sodium in decreasing levels of abundance. Other metals identified in the soils are 

manganese, (898ppm) copper (42ppm), chromium (57ppm), cobalt (13ppm), silicon 

(979ppm) and potassium (165ppm). The agricultural capability of the soils onsite was 

classified as S2; reddish moderately weathered soils, with a shallow useable depth and 

average drainage with a moderate aptitude for agriculture. Some of the infrastructure lies 

on soils classified as S1b (hydromorphic gleysols) with higher agricultural capability. The 

large volume of perennial crops and poor farming practises are threatening the food 

security of the local population.

The land use of the project area consists of secondary rainforest impacted on by cultivation 

of food crops and plantations of cocoa and coffee (41.5% of study area). There are 27 

settlements in the study area (0.6%). Agbaou Village is the largest settlement located in the 

southeast of the study area. Tracks and roads allow travel between the villages (27.7km 

long with a width of 2.4m, 0.3%). The primary forest (15.7%) in the area is severely 

degraded. Degraded forests and grassy fallow plains (40.9%) have developed. Permanent 

water exists in the area in the form of streams and wetlands (1.1%). Small scale logging 

and artisanal gold mining activities occur. There is no industrial land use in the study area. 

Small scale animal husbandry occurs around the settlements in the form of goats, pigs and 

chickens. 

The noise measured in the study area was from agricultural activities, settlements, birds, 

small mammals and insects. There is no industry in the area and little traffic on the dirt 

tracks. The noise measurements were taken as an indicator of the background noise levels 

for future reference to environmental noise during mining activities. Noise levels will 

increase in the vicinity of the orebodies; at the process plant; at the mine camp; the waste 

rock dumps and along mine haul roads. Generally the sampled equivalent A-weighted 

continuous noise levels were within the range of 45 to 55 decibels. There are no industrial 

sources of vibration within the proposed project area. Localised vibrational occurrences 

may occur during logging activities when trees are felled. Blasting in the open pits will have 

vibrational impacts on the ground and infrastructure. An assessment of the vibrations will 

be undertaken during operations. 

The general air quality at site is good with seasonal variations in dust throughout the year 

depending on the local precipitation. Fires and shifting cultivation practices during the dry 

season (November to March) generates smoke and dust. Charcoaling activities were not 

immediately visible in the study area but many of the small villages are not supplied with 

electricity and so wood or charcoal will provide the main fuel source. Infrequent traffic on 

the dirt tracks may affect localized dust levels. Hazes can occur towards the end of the dry 

season which dissipates after the first rain. Infrequent small temperature inversions near 

watercourses tend to trap the dust, smoke and mist near ground level. The sampling site 

with the highest dust collected was DM2, located to the southwest of Agbahou Main. This is 

likely to be the impact of dust from vehicles on the nearby road. The mine camp and 

Abdoulayekro are the least dusty sites. 

The different modes of transport used in the project area are foot, bicycles, cars, 

minibuses, motorbikes, trucks and buses. A transport survey was conducted at two 

sites (Agbahou to Groh and (Groh to Divo) over a week's period each and three times

a day (morning, midday and evening). A wider range of different modes of transport is 

used on larger access routes (Groh to Divo) thus allowing greater mobility. More 

frequent transport by minibuses, buses, trucks and cars was observed along the Groh 

to Divo route. Traffic movement is highest during the mornings and evenings along this 

route with overall traffic flow towards Divo. Accessibility is lower along the Agbahou to 

Groh route and transport is less frequent. 

Bicycles and pedestrians travel along this road with very little automated vehicle 

movement. The overall direction of traffic is towards Agbahou and other villages. Overall 

the preferred mode of transport is bicycle, which is convenient and comparatively cheap to 

other forms of transport. During the project implementation it is expected that traffic will 

increase along the Agbahou to Groh route which will impact on the local populations and 

accessibility.  

Two watercourses exist in the study area which are the Akegla and the Gbadjo Streams. 

These streams are tributaries of rivers that finally feed into the Bandama River. The water 

quality in these streams and surrounding watercourses was generally very good. The 

watercourses provide a source of drinking, washing and cleaning water for the local 

populations. As expected these watercourses would be affected by this use and faecal and 

bacterial coliform were present. Other sources of water are provided by wells (with hand 

pumps) in Agbahou as well as hand dug wells or pits around some of the villages e.g. 

Sialoukro and Samuelkro. Stream flow varies considerably in the watercourses on a 

temporal basis. There are large seasonal variations in water flow of the larger rivers 

downstream of the project area. The Akegla and the Gbadjo Stream have smaller seasonal 

variations but short term rainfall event variations are expected to be higher. 

Groundwater in the project area is generally of good quality, however there are elevated 

total metal levels of iron, aluminium, potassium, chromium, selenium and zinc. Some of 

these metals exist as dissolved metals such as potassium and zinc. The water depth 

ranges from 0.3m to 112.4m below ground level. The hydrogeology is affected by the meta-

volcanic and metasedimentary phyllites, schists and greywackes of the project area. A 

deep (20m) weathered laterite layer with a 2-5m thick duri-crust at the surface acts as an 

aquitard generating a perched aquifer in the TSF area. This confines the underlying 

aquifers. The majority of the groundwater will be released from the saprock. Based on the 

extent of the saprolite, saprock and bedrock these aquifers will have continuous lateral 

connectivities. The clayey saprolite will act as a confining layer to the saprock and bedrock. 

The nature of the faults and shears in the project area are considered not conducive to high

groundwater flows due to their small grain sizes, low effective porosities and plastic 

deformation characteristics. 

The flora study determined that the project area is typical of the mesophile sector of the 

Great Guinean area and has regional endemic species that have been described as part of 

the Guinean-Sudan area. Generally the diversity of the terrestrial flora is high and some 

species were identified in the forests that represent original compositions from semi-

deciduous forests in this area of Côte d'Ivoire. Some remnants of the old humid and thick 

semi-deciduous forests were found on the firm undisturbed ferrallitic soils usually located 

on the tops or slopes of the small hills. The low lying plains and hillside forests are replaced 

by fields and plantations. There were 564 species identified, with 377 species identified 

from 45 sampling plots 187 species along transect walks in the fields, plantations and forest 

areas. There are no wetland mesophile compositions found in the project area. The 

vegetation of the project area is very fragmented and fallows are the dominant ground 

occupation. 

The aquatic flora and fauna study was conducted in the project streams and surrounding 

streams and rivers to determine the species composition of the watercourses. The study 

was conducted for phytoplankton, zooplankton, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects and 

fish. The study identified 65 phytoplankton species belonging to 4 classes (Chlorophycée, 

Euglenophycée, Bacillariophycée and Cyanophycée); 11 zooplanktonic species subdivided 

into 4 groups (Cladocerus, Copepods, Rotifers, Ostracodes); 2 Dipterous families  

(Chironomidae and Chaoboridae); 5 shrimp species and 1 crab species. In total, 30 benthic 

organisms belonging to the Annelid taxonomic groups (1 taxan), Molluscs (7 taxans) and 

Insects (22 taxans) were identified. The study indicated that the current human activities 

(cultivation, use of water for drinking, fishing, washing, animals etc) appears to have no 

threat on the species diversity of the aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic flora was evident at 

some sites through rooted submerged and emergent vegetation such as water lillies and 

reeds. 

The Agbaou Gold Project is located in the Divo Sub-prefecture of the Divo Prefecture in 

southern Côte d'Ivoire, approximately 180km southwest of the capital city of Yamoussoukro 

and 200km northwest of Abidjan. The native ethnic groups in the District of Divo are the 

Dida, the Godié and the Ega. There is a large proportion of foreign immigrants in the 

District of Divo. Divo has experienced steady economic growth through improved road 

accessibility, communications and agriculture. This economic growth has also resulted in 

in-migration of other Ivorian ethnic groups. Regional and local administration is conducted 

through the Sub-prefect and Prefect of Divo. Traditional administration is conducted

through the Canton, a colonial administrative position closely linked with the local 

administration, and the Chiefs of villages. The Chief is supported by a series of Notables 

and generally elected by the population of a village.  

The main village near the project area is Agbaou, with a population of approximately 1,339 

people which is traditionally led by a Chief and his notables. Decision making is conducted 

democratically with elders, guardians, men, women and youth representatives. There are 

two government primary schools in Agbaou managed by 2 headmasters and 8 teachers. 

There are no healthcare facilities in Agbaou (clinics, pharmacies, nurses or midwives). The 

closest facilities are found in Niafouta (7km northeast of Agbaou). The main economic 

activities are agriculture, animal husbandry and small scale artisanal gold mining. Malaria 

(64%) is the prevailing illness of the Divo District, followed by acute breathing infections 

(27%) and sexually transmitted diseases (6%). There are no specific health statistics for the 

Agbaou area based on the lack of health facilities here.  

There are 13 villages located within the proposed project area that are considered to be the 

affected population requiring relocation. These villages are Sialoukro, Okoukro I, Okoukro 

II, Alfredkro, Salamkro, Amadoukro, Edouardkro, Anatolekro, Batorokro, Abdoulayekro, 

Samulekro, Lazarekro and Jean-Marckro. A Chief represents the traditional administration 

in Sialoukro and the heads of families represent the population in the other 12 villages. The 

affected population will be 185 people from 21 families with 37 households. Farmland and 

plantations consist of a large proportion of the existing land use and an estimated 76 

farmers will require crop and field compensation. Discussions with the local communities in 

Agbaou and the affected people have identified a potential relocation site to the northeast 

of Agbaou Village, originally reserved for future expansion of Agbaou.  A Displacement and 

Relocation Plan (DRP) has been developed to manage the compensation, displacement 

activities and relocation of these affected people. 

Infrastructure development in the project area is poor. There is no railway line; only a small 

supply of electricity to Agbaou; an intermittent mobile telephone network; no landline 

telephone network; no water or sewage treatment plant; and no medical facilities within the 

Agbaou project area. The access to the project is currently provided by a laterite road from 

Groh to Agbaou. The road passes through Agbaou Village and branches off the Agbaou-

Daako road to Sialoukro for 2km to the Agbaou Main and Main South orebodies. An 

alternative route has been proposed to branch off the Groh-Agbaou road to the northwest 

and access the project area from the west. This is to reduce safety issues related to mining 

equipment and vehicles passing through Agbaou Village.

An environmental and socio-economic impact assessment was conducted as part of the 

EIA to identify the major potential positive and negative impacts that would be generated by 

the development of the Agbaou Gold Project.  

The major potential positive environmental and social impacts of the project are:- 

 The creation of 300 jobs will generate much needed employment in an area where 

most people are unemployed or involved in agriculture. The local populations and other 

Ivorians with the required skills will be preferentially employed over imported skilled 

labour, where possible; 

 The development of the project will lead to improvements in the local infrastructure 

such as roads, electricity supply, communication networks and accessibility; 

 The expansion of economic activities in the Agbaou area and the Divo District will 

generate positive economic multiplier effects throughout the service, manufacturing and 

construction sectors; 

 Etruscan will implement a policy to use local companies and suppliers where possible 

for the provision of equipment and services during operations, where possible. This will 

encourage the growth of the Ivorian economy. If there are no locally available services 

then Etruscan will assist with awareness and capacity training programs through 

foreign and local contractors; 

 The project will form part of a new and young economic sector in Côte d'Ivoire which 

will lead to national diversification and economic stability; 

 The mining project will generate national income for the Government of Côte d'Ivoire 

through taxes, fees and royalties to be paid to the District of Divo; 

 An improved standard of living and income generation by the local populations in the 

project area through direct employment by the project or provision of services to the 

mine (food production etc); 

 The standard of living for the relocated populations will be improved through the 

provision of housing, water and educational facilities. The relocation and compensation 

process will be carefully managed and monitored through the implementation of the 

DRP; 

 Etruscan will provide employees with training opportunities from skilled and 

experienced individuals in order to maximize the number of Ivorians employed by the 

project as well as increase the local capacity of the mining sector;

Page 234 

 Etruscan will assist local social development projects, identified and agreed on through 

participative feedback from the local communities, through the formation of a 

Sustainable Development Plan; 

 The open pits will be allowed to flood when mining operations cease and will potentially 

provide for alternative sources of income (fishing) and recreational activities. 

 The development of a mine nursery and the progressive re-vegetation of the project 

affected area will reduce the long term impacts of the mine and encourage the site to 

revert to original land use or an alternative economic use. 

The potential negative environmental and social impacts of the project are:- 

 The project will lead to land clearance over a surface area of approximately 410ha 

which is comprised mainly of subsistence agriculture with some impacted secondary 

forest. This clearance will result in the loss of natural habitats for flora and fauna and 

changes in land use; 

 Contouring of the project are for the construction of mine infrastructure will modify the 

natural relief and drainage patterns; 

 The contamination and degradation of soils through exposure from land clearance, 

erosion and mining activities (spills of oils and fuel, process solutions, reagents, 

chemicals). Management measures will be implemented to reduce, contain and prevent 

spills. Measures will be implemented to reduce erosion and exposure of soils; 

 Degradation of surface water and groundwater quality in the project area; through spills 

of process solutions, oils and fuel, extraction methods during dewatering and release of 

contaminated water offsite. The management of water resources onsite will aim to 

prevent or minimize the degradation of these resources as well as promote recycling 

and minimization of water use; 

 Siltation and flow modifications to the Gbadjo Stream through eroded soils from 

construction and mining sites and decreased permeability of the soils in the project 

area. The diversion of the flow of the Gbadjo Stream around the TSF will affect the 

aquatic habitat;  

 The dewatering activities around the open pits will lead to localized lowering of the 

groundwater levels as well as the release of water containing solids and metals into the 

Gbadjo Stream. The settlement of this water will be conducted prior to discharge and 

the water quality will be analysed;

Page 235 

 Degradation of the localized air quality in the project area through the generation of 

dust along access roads, at the crushing and milling plant and during blasting activities. 

Vehicle exhaust fumes will increase in the project area through increased transportation 

activities. The process plant will produce some gases from the processing of the ore. 

Measures will be implemented to reduce dust and vehicle emissions as well as reduce 

and manage gaseous emissions from the process plant; 

 Increased noise around the mine project area and along transport routes may affect the 

local populations and the wildlife found in the project area. Measures to reduce the 

noise generated by mining activities will be developed into the mine design and 

management of the transport fleet. The noisiest activities will be restricted to daytime 

hours to prevent night time disturbances to the local communities; 

 Increased traffic volumes in the local region and around the project area specifically 

along the Agbahou-Groh and the Divo-Groh roads may impact on the health and safety 

of the local communities. This traffic is generated from the provision of services to the 

mine, and employee and mine product movements. Measures to control traffic 

(signposting, speed cameras, speed bumps etc) and emissions from mine vehicles will 

be implemented; 

 Mine blasting in the open pits and heavy vehicle movements may generate vibrations in 

the project area which may impact on the safety of public and private infrastructure and 

buildings; 

 There is the potential for the generation of acid mine drainage from some of the 

saprolite material under oxidized conditions (exposure). The ARD test work indicated 

that most of this potential acid could be neutralized by the presence of natural acid 

neutralizing material. Measures will be implemented to ensure highly sulphidic non-

mineralized material will not be used as construction material onsite. Monitoring of 

groundwater conditions around areas of potential acid drainage will be regularly 

monitored; 

 Degradation of the local environment (soils, water resources, habitat quality) may occur 

as a result of poor waste management practices. All mine waste (waste rock, tailings, 

used oil, plastics, reagent containers etc.) will be subject to a waste management plan; 

 Increased prevalence of HIV and AIDS through the changes in the demography of the 

local populations. The increased movement of people into and away from the project 

area and the District of Divo may have local health impacts. Etruscan will aim to reduce 

the occurrence of malaria through counselling and support of its employees. Guidance

Page 236 

counselling and testing programs will be implemented for company employees and 

their families; 

 Increased immigration to the project area may lead to competition for jobs and lead to 

conflicts between immigrants and local communities. The capacity of the local 

infrastructure may also be exceeded. Measures to target these problems and promote 

sustainable development will be implemented; 

 Relocation of the affected communities in the project area to Agbaou Village may lead 

to economic upheaval, hardships and tensions between the relocated population and 

their host communities. A DRP has been developed to manage the displacement and 

relocation of these communities and monitor its success; 

 The loss of agricultural land in the project area is expected to impact on 76 farmers. 

These farmers will require compensation for the economic value of their crops and 

assistance with relocation of their activities to other farming areas. Compensation will 

be conducted in an individual and participative manner to benefit each person 

appropriately; 

 The loss of financial security for the farmers and the relocated villages may lead to 

hardship, poverty and hunger. Etruscan will monitor the success of the DRP and 

implement a sustainable development plan for the area; 

Environmental and social mitigation and management measures were developed for these 

and other less significant impacts identified in the EIA. These measures form part of the 

Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of the Agbaou Project. 

The EMP forms a part of the Environmental Management System (EMS) to be 

implemented during the development of the project. The EMS describes the management 

structure responsible for environmental, health and safety aspects and the personnel 

required to ensure its success. The EMS and EMP have been developed with reference to 

the legislation of Côte D'Ivoire, World Bank (WB) guidelines and International Finance 

Corporation (IFC) requirements and guidelines. An internal reporting structure has been 

developed to ensure regular internal and external auditing, as part of the requirements of 

Côte D'Ivoire, the WB and IFC. 

Within the EMP and EMS, a series of policies have been developed to target key aspects 

requiring specific management actions, such as a Waste Management Policy, Relocation 

and Compensation Policy, Conservation and Vegetation Management Policy, Site 

Rehabilitation Policy and Emergency and Safety Action Policy amongst others. Etruscan 

will implement these policies through the EMS.

Etruscan will implement international occupational health and safety standards and 

procedures throughout the project to create a safe workplace, thereby protecting its 

employees from accidents, sickness and fatalities. The Company will also implement 

educational programs and counselling to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria. 

Etruscan will also comply with the labour legislation of Côte d'Ivoire. 

An Environmental Monitoring Plan has been developed for air, soil, surface water, 

groundwater, noise, traffic, vibration and waste management. This plan will be implemented 

through the pre-mining (construction), operations, closure and post-closure phases of the 

project. The plan will monitor compliance based on requirements of the legislation of Côte 

d'Ivoire, the WB and IFC. 

The Agbaou Project site will be subject to a post-closure monitoring plan to assess and 

prevent any negative impacts on the environment after the closure of the mine. ERCI will 

implement the initiation of an Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) account to ensure that 

closure of the mine is complete.

24.1 HR  S ys tems  Development 

24.1.1 Introduc tion 

The following document outlines a proposed process for establishing HR systems for 

Etruscan. 

24.1.2 P roces s  development 

The setting up of HR systems for the operation will initially be a 7 step process that will be 

set up to ensure that it aligns itself from the outset with the organisations strategies and 

objectives. This will comprise the following key stages: - 

 Organisational structure based on set-up, followed by production phases. This will 

constitute the formation of a 10-year manpower planning strategy. 

 The establishment of a broad banded model will be linked to the organogram with level 

and role descriptors in place. 

 Establishment of a remuneration model linked to the broad banded structure. 

 Establishment of the conditions of service linked to each broad banded level (and each 

position within the levels). 

 Establishment of all HR policies and procedures. 

 Establishment of a recruiting strategy and subsequent implementation. 

 Consideration to be given to the development of a management information system 

(MIS) to manage all of the above. 

Training and Development systems will form part of this process and will be implemented 

from the outset (especially induction and refresher training). 

24.1.3 Organis ational s truc ture 

Prior to setting up supporting HR systems an organisation structure needs to be derived 

which takes into account the entire operation as well as support services and more 

importantly the reporting structures that will be imposed. 

Figure 24.1-1Organisational Structure 
 

24.1.4 B road banding model 

A Broad banding model based on the grading system will be derived around the key 

positions identified within the organisational structure.  As per best industry practice this 

should comprise 8 key levels from the CEO (or most senior position on site) through to the

lowest level (unskilled labourer).  Each level should have clearly defined, measurable 

outcomes and each position on the mine should clearly align itself to one of the levels. 

24.1.5 R emuneration model 

In line with the agreed broad banding structure, remuneration bands will be implemented 

that will match the skills and value-adding to the organisation.  For the lower levels these 

should be fixed but at the upper levels they will be "fully" broad banded within the range 

based on the development of a performance management system.  The remunerations 

ranges will be regionally benchmarked to ensure competitiveness.  

24.1.6 C onditions  of s ervic e 

Conditions of service will be established and linked to the agreed to broad banding levels.  

Issues to be covered would include: working hours, leave, sick leave, housing, medical, 

pensions and so forth. 

24.1.7 HR  polic ies  and proc edures  

All key HR policies and procedures will be developed, agreed to, and implemented before 

the mine commences production to ensure smooth running from the outset. 

24.1.8 R ec ruitment 

With the key HR systems in place, a recruitment strategy will be designed and 

subsequently implemented for all key personnel. The strategy will incorporate sourcing, 

interviewing procedures, offers, signing-on and induction as well as linkage to remuneration 

and conditions of service. Further this will be driven by the organisational structure as 

determined in 24.1.3 above. 

24.1.9 Management information s ys tem (MIS ) 

To maximise efficiency, consideration will be given to implementing a Management 

Information System that will enable the easy capture, manipulation and subsequent access 

to key information. 

24.1.10 L onger term HR  development  

The initial process outlined above merely serves to implement the HR systems (including 

staffing) in readiness for full production. There is however a need to ensure that these are 

sustainable over time and that they are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain 

optimal to the needs of the operations and changes that have taken place in the 

environment.

24.2 P hilos ophy 

Etruscan aims as far as possible to employ Ivorian citizens, both male and female, 

maximising those from the local community, to work at Agbaou. This will benefit both Cote 

d'Ivoire, in terms of creating jobs and passing on skills, and Etruscan in terms of benefiting 

from a cost effective and motivated workforce familiar with working in conditions such as 

those found at Agbaou.  

The mining sector is a re-emerging area of business for Cote d'Ivoire. Where suitable local 

expertise is not readily available, Etruscan will initially bring in additional expatriate 

employees. These will be selected partly on the basis of their ability to impart knowledge 

and skills as well as provide short to medium term niche skills not readily available locally. 

Selection of all employees, whether Ivorian or expatriate, will be made on merit, and with 

particular reference for the need to maintain a safe and productive work environment. 

All vacancies with Agbaou will be advertised in the local press as well as posted on the 

internal bulletin board at the mine site. The majority of employees will be based at the 

Agbaou mine-site with a small number of employees located in Abidjan. The plant 

operation will be a 24-hour per day, 365 day per year continuous nature of the plant 

operation, however people working over these periods will be compensated as per the 

Ivorian labour law.  Employees will work a shift system, typically including night work, but 

with a rotation system so that no employee spends more than half their time on nights. A 

typical shift pattern will be 3 months on, 3 weeks off. The plant will operate for 7 days per 

week; workers will be split into 3 x 8 hour shifts per day, typically for 7 days per week. Shift 

times are likely to be 7am to 3pm, 3pm to 11pm, and 11pm to 7am. The mining function will 

operate for 6 days per week; workers will be split and will work 1 x 12 hour shift per day, for 

which shift time may be 6am to 6pm. Additional workers will be taken on to ensure that 

leave periods (and for the plant, days off) are covered. Professional and managerial grade 

employees on the plant and mine will work longer shifts, of up to 12 hours, as necessary.

The employees will be housed and fed in good quality accommodation at site. All 

employees will be provided with either African or European style food, to ensure that it is of 

an acceptable quality to all.  Please refer to Section 22 for details of the accommodation 

facilities. A smaller number of people will be based in Abidjan to provide purchasing, 

logistical, and administrative functions. These people will generally live at home, will not be 

working shifts, and as a consequence will, in the case of nationals, be given 4 weeks 

holiday per year plus public holidays, as given under the labour law.  

24.3.2 G eneral labour 

These employees will be sourced from either Agbaou Village or Divo and will be 

transported to the mine site on a daily basis. All general labour workers will be provided 

with one meal per day that will be served at the chophouses, which will be centrally located 

within the mine complex.

As described in Table 24.5-1(above), the Owners mining staff will be 126, the processing 

plant 96, and G&A 84, this will give a total number of 306.  In addition to these, around 10 

will be based off site in Abidjan in support functions such as purchasing, logistics, and 

interaction with government agencies. As Etruscan will be operating all mining activities 

personnel requirements for this function have been addressed in this document. 

The initial expatriate compliment will be 10 plus up to 18 temporary expatriate positions, a 

total of 28 positions – below the 10% maximum recommended by the labour law, but 

sufficient to ensure that operations can operate effectively given the current technical skill 

base in Cote d'Ivoire for this sector.  

In the long term, it is Etruscan's intention that the total workforce will be manned by Ivorian 

Nationals, Etruscan has made an allowance for the employment of temporary expatriate 

personnel to fill positions that cannot initially be filled by Ivorian people. It is intended that 

all of the temporary expatriate positions will be filled by Ivorians within 4 years of production 

commencing. The above figures include provision for leave and sickness cover.

24.6 Availability Of T rained Workforc e 

Cote d'Ivoire has a limited history of mining and as a result available expertise in country, 

both for mining and for operating the process plant may be in short supply.  

Etruscan already employs an excellent geological team which has just completed the 

recent resource drilling campaign. It is hoped that during production this source of trained 

graduate calibre local employees can be further utilised. 

Etruscan has a desire to train its workforce to its own standards, as safety and productivity 

levels are then more likely to be achieved. 

The approach that will be taken will therefore be one of hiring Ivorian staff where they are 

both skilled and capable of doing the job immediately, or where they can be brought up to 

the necessary level through training in the timeframe required before the mine opens. 

Where neither of these two options is possible, expatriates (probably from Ghana, Mali, 

South Africa or Australia) will be brought in, to ensure that production and safety targets are 

achieved. Over time there will be potential to reduce the number of expatriates as Ivorian 

staff gain experience  

24.7 T raining Of T he Workforc e 

Etruscan is committed to offering opportunities for employment to Ivorian people firstly. 

Where a suitable, qualified candidate is not available in Cote d'Ivoire the position will have 

to be filled using expatriate labour. For most positions the expatriates will be paid a basic 

salary plus a bonus according to how successful they are at training Ivorians, which will be 

one of the Key Performance Areas, with the intention that for many positions, Ivorians will 

be able to take over. It is unlikely that this will be the case for all roles, as senior roles, such 

as for example, the Mine Manager, require over 15 years of experience. In addition, it 

should be stressed that compromising on candidate quality will affect safety and 

production; priority will always be given to these issues first and foremost, for the good of 

the entire workforce. 

The long-term manpower requirement is defined in section 24.5. Expatriate labour is tabled 

as expat, with the balance, temporary expatriate and/or Ivorian positions tabled as locals. 

This shows that the total workforce will be around 367 including contract catering staff.  Of 

these, around 6 (3.5%) will be expatriates on permanent contracts, although in the early 

years up to 14 expatriates and temporary expatriates on temporary contracts may be 

utilised in addition to the core staff.

24.7.1 Owner operator mining 

Etruscan will have the following philosophy regarding the staffing of its mining personnel. 

 Operators: Off highway truck drivers will be recruited in Cote d'Ivoire thus utilising 

people who already have some experience of operating heavy equipment. Loader, 

excavator and grader operators will be recruited from people who already have 

experience in operating similar plant. 

 Initially trainers from the suppliers of the mining equipment will be brought to Cote 

d'Ivoire to ensure that full training is given to all operators. 

 All operators will be given a detailed training program prior to the commencement of 

mining operations.  

 Geology, grade control and mine survey positions may be filled by temporary expatriate 

staff at the senior level, whilst Ivorian staff are being trained. 

 Mining Manager and Senior Mine Engineer are likely to be hired as expatriates as are 

the senior geologist, maintenance superintendant and the maintenance foreman.  

 To access the ore body, facilitate training and 'bedding in' of the workers, mining 

operations will commence around 3 months ahead of the process plant. This time will 

be used to carry out pre-stripping and stockpiling of ore. 

24.7.2 P roces s  plant 

As there is limited history of gold mining within Cote d'Ivoire and due to the highly 

specialised nature of the required skills expatriates will fill senior positions. Intermediate 

roles will be filled as far as possible by Ivorians with some appropriate industrial 

experience. 

Operator grades will be recruited locally and given appropriate safety and orientation 

training on site. 

Scope to replace the senior roles with Ivorian people is limited, even over time, due to the 

need for university qualifications in metallurgy plus substantial experience. Each is at 

present in short supply in Cote d'Ivoire. It will be possible for Etruscan to sponsor one or 

more people for training in this field once the mine is producing, with a view to their 

receiving positions at Etruscan Resources Inc. once qualified.

24.7.3 G eneral and adminis tration 

The most senior roles are General Manager of Etruscan, a combined HR / Administration 

Manager position and a Financial Accountant. It is envisaged that the latter two positions 

could be filled by Ivorians. 

Ivorians would fill other senior level roles in accounting and purchasing either initially or 

later on, as and when suitable candidates are available. It is planned that a grading system 

will be operated so that in functions such as purchasing and accounting Ivorian employees 

will have real prospects for promotion. 

24.7.4 C ontrac tors  and s ub-c ontrac tors  

The majority of workers associated with the project will be Ivorian employees. 

Certain roles may be contracted out to contractors (e.g. mining, catering & transport). 

Etruscan will ensure that as far as is practicable these contractors should use local Ivorian 

labour. 

During construction a number of foreign contractors will need to work at the site, due to lack 

of specialised expertise in Cote d'Ivoire. This number is likely to be under 20% of the total 

construction workforce. A large number of Ivorians will be working with the foreign 

contractors and will therefore gain valuable experience for future mining projects in Cote 

d'Ivoire. 

To facilitate training and localisation a budget totalling 7% of revenue / salary bill has been 

set aside, split between each year of the project. Starting in year -1 (starting from 1 year 

before completion of construction), training of personnel will begin.  

Once the mine is operational the localisation status of the project will be reviewed and 

reported on, on an annual basis. A short report will be provided to the relevant authority 

describing progress to date together with any steps being taken in the form of training. A 

substantial annual budget, as described above, will be allocated specifically for training, 

and it is anticipated that by the closure of the mine there should be sufficient skills 

transferred to handle the majority of the technical aspects of the project.

25.1 S afety 

25.1.1 Oc c upational health and s afety (H& S ) 

The Occupational Health and Safety system is a five stage proactive system: 

 Risk and impact assessments 

 First aid and occupational health service facilities 

 Medical services 

 Training 

 Inspection and Action 

These stages are described in more detail in the following sections. 

25.1.2 R is k and impac t as s es s ments  

25.1.2.1 Statement of Objectives 

To identify and assess H&S risks through a dynamic, formal, structured and holistic 

process to facilitate effective risk reduction. As Etruscan has not yet established formal 

mining safety controls with the Ivorian Mining Authorities, the South African Mine Health 

and Safety Act (29) of 1996 has been used as a reference in drawing up standards and 

systems for mine health and safety for the Agbaou project. 

Standard 
General Requirements:  

 There is a systematic approach and standard procedure on all work sites to identify and 

assess risks and the impact thereof.  

 The applicable site H&S practitioner is alerted to planned process activation and 

modifications. An assessment team is then established for that specific task. All tasks 

are assessed, incident preventive measures are initiated before the activity starts and 

the H&S impacts are discussed with all the applicable employees working on that job.   

 All applicable parties are involved in the assessment process. 

 All applicable assessments are reviewed annually. 

 Assessments include all significant activities, covering the full scope of responsibility 

and accountability of the operations and include the activities of all sub-contractors. 

 Employees are competent to evaluate and identify risks related to a specific task / 

function.

25.2 S ite S ec urity 

25.2.1 Introduc tion 

This section describes the proposed security measures that will be implemented on the 

Agbaou project during operations in order to ensure the safety and security of both the 

work force and the local communities.  

During operations, security management will involve dialogue with local communities, 

through the Security Manager, with individual local community representatives and officials. 

This will ensure that all issues of mutual concern are managed effectively. 

The entire Production Area will be demarcated. The mining and plant areas within the 

Production Area will be secured to prevent access of unauthorised personnel. Access 

control will be implemented and where necessary alternative access routes will be provided 

to members of the local community 

25.2.2 P hys ic al s ec urity 

The terrain surrounding the mine and plant area offers security as there will be only one 

point of road access. The vegetation in the area prevents vehicle access other than by the 

established access points. 

The perimeter of the Production Area, which measures 10 by 4 kilometres, will be cleared 

and signage erected at fifty meter intervals to deter unauthorised access. 

Heavy-duty fencing will be erected around the mining areas, plant, stores and 

accommodation areas, the design of which is presented in the Infrastructure Section – 22 

of this document. The plant area and mine will be floodlit. 

CCTV monitoring with tape backup will be used to monitor office and stores entry points to 

deter theft.  

25.2.3 S ite s ecurity 

Site security requirements will be provided by the full-time staff of Etruscan Resources Inc. 

This service will be extended to cover the industrial security requirements of the project  

The Security Department will be required to fulfil the following functions: 

 To prevent unauthorised access to the mine and plant areas 

 To monitor plant access through the Clean and Dirty change room (ablutions & 

changeroom)

entry points to the lease area 

 To detain any employee or visitor to the site who threatens any other employee or 

visitor with violence 

 To detain illegal and unauthorised intruders in the lease area 

25.3 R egional S ecurity / G old S hipments  

The company has established lines of communication with both local and regional security 

authorities in Abidjan and liaises regularly on matters of security and permitting. These 

relationships will continue into the future as part of the company's ongoing interaction with 

surrounding communities and authorities. A contract will be entered into with the selected 

refinery for the refining of all gold ore produced at Agbaou Gold Mine. Included in this 

contract will be the collection and transportation of all gold ore from the mine site.  The 

company identified will accept all risks and insurance, once collection at the mine site has 

taken place.

26.1 Introduc tion 

It is assumed that all equipment for the plant construction, consumables, reagents and 

spares for plant operation; will be supplied either from Europe or South Africa, both areas 

having advanced infrastructure, transport facilities and logistics. With this in mind, this 

section aims to cover the handling and transportation of goods and materials into Côte 

d'Ivoire, and then onto Agbaou Gold Mine plant site. 

26.2 Airports   

26.2.1 P ort B ouet airport 

The airport (Port Bouet) is located in the city of Abdijan, it was also known as Felix 

Houphouet-Boigny International Airport and is served by local airlines such as Air Ivoire. 

There are several international carriers presently operating into Abidjan, from Europe Air 

France and Brussels Airlines, from the Middle East Emirates Airline, and from South Africa 

SAA Airlines which operates two direct flights per week on a Wednesday and Friday. 

The Airport is also serviced by several other African Airlines and also provides charter 

flights to the interior of Côte d'Ivoire. 

26.3 Ivorian P ort F ac ilities  

26.3.1 P orts  

Côte d'lvoire has four main ports namely Abidjan, Aboisso, Dabou, San-Pedro 

Abidjan is the chief port and largest city of Côte d'Ivoire. It lies along the Ébrié Lagoon, 

which is separated from the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic by the Vridi Plage sandbar.  

Abidjan port is the largest, most modern port in West Africa. It has the vital combination of a 

central and accessible location as well as a developed transport infrastructure. It is a major 

transit point for West and Central African states using the relatively advanced Ivorian road 

and rail system. Thanks to the opening of the Vridi canal, this freshwater port handles 90% 

of the commercial trade to and from Côte d'lvoire.  

26.3.2 P ort handling fac ilities  

The port of Abidjan has in total 6km of quay with 34 berths including specialised terminals 

for containers, timber, fruits, cereals and hydrocarbons. 

 Draft at harbour mouth 10.5m Vridi Canal 

 Draft at quay 12.5m

26.4 C us toms  And Duties  

Refer to Section 27.8 of Chapter 27, Capital Cost Estimate. 

26.5 R oads  

26.5.1 Introduc tion 

A current route survey was undertaken by MDM to assess the condition of the road from 

Abidjan to the Agbaou Mine Site. The route is generally in good condition and requires no 

further upgrade to bring construction equipment and materials to site. 

26.5.2 R oute s urvey 

The road from Abdijan to Bodo is a twin laned dual carriageway tarred for its entire length 

of some 130 kilometres; it is in good condition and requires no further work. From Ndouci 

one turns onto a tarred road to Divo, a distance of some 72 kilometres, passing through the 

towns of Tiassale and Heremankono. The road crosses the Bandama River at Tissale and 

the bridge is in excellent condition and offers no restrictions to heavy vehicles. This road 

has some sections where the tarred surface is deteriorating and shows signs of potholes, 

however there is evidence of the repair work to be undertaken as several of the potholes 

are marked with white surface paint. At the town of Divo one turns in a northerly direction 

and passes through the villages of Data and Didoko, again on a tarred road for a distance 

of some 22 kilometres. At Didoko the road deteriorates for a short distance and it would 

benefit from the use of a grader and possibly some storm water drainage as it gets flooded 

during heavy rain storms. Approximately 5 kilometres from Didoko one turns in an easterly 

direction and follows a good un-tarred (dirt) road for a distance of 16 kilometres to the 

Etruscan Geological Drilling Camp. The route to the Agbaou Plant Site covers a total 

distance of approximately 240 kilometres and offers no restrictions to the movement of

27.2.1 B as is  of c os ting 

Accuracy of the estimates is considered to be ±10%. 

The pricing basis used is an EPC basis with a margin of 8% being added for the main 

contractor's profit. 

Costs are expressed in United States Dollars (US$) as at June 2009.  

The cost build-ups have generally been done in South African Rand (ZAR). Rand based 

costs have been converted to US$ at an exchange rate of US$ 1.00 equals ZAR 9.50.  The 

approximate Rand based portion of the project is R459 million.  No provision has been 

made for cost escalation or exchange rate fluctuations, any rate fluctuations whether 

positive or negative will be for Etruscan's account. During the construction and 

commissioning of the project a provision for unforseen cross border taxes, import duties, 

government levies, labour taxes or of similar in nature, as mentioned above, have been 

allowed for. A 2% community tax allowance has been allowed for (see Section 31 for more 

information).

Capital costs for the various disciplines were estimated by MDM as follows: 

27.2.2 Mec hanicals  

Supplier quotations have been obtained for all major mechanical equipment ex 

Johannesburg, South Africa. The tower cranes have been priced as second hand. The cost 

for equipping the plant laboratory has been included in the plant mechanical cost build 

up.Mechanical cost savings are possible if second hand equipment is used. Crushers and 

mills may be obtained second hand. Potential second hand mills have been identified in the 

Dominican Republic and a cost of 75% of the new cost for the mills has been used, to allow 

for second hand mills being installed. 

27.2.3 C ons truc tion 

  Construction costs have been quoted from a Senegalese company, who are currently 

engaged in construction projects in West Africa.  MDM have provided costs for their 

own construction management team to ensure that the plant is constructed as designed 

and to the relevant construction and safety standards. These costs are reflected in the 

EPCM cost build-up. 

  Costs are based on expatriate supervision with locally employed skilled and semi-

skilled labour. An allowance has been made for tools, consumables, construction 

equipment and craneage based on construction experience of plants of a similar size. 

  Local field labour rates are based on current rates being experienced by construction 

companies based in West Africa. 

27.2.4 B ulk earthworks  and c ivil c ons truc tion 

  Geo-technical report to be provided by Etruscan Resources prior to civil design. 

  Material quantities were calculated from first principles and the bill of quantities 

issued to a Ghanaian and Ivorian companies for construction costing. 

  Costs are based on using expatriate supervision and local field labour with tools and 

equipment supplied from Abidjan. 

  A crushing & screening plant will be provided and set up on site to supply sand and 

stone to the correct specification. 

  A batching plant will be supplied for mixing of concrete.  

  Civil Construction tools have been included in the costs. 

27.2.5 E lec tric al 

Costs are based on bills of quantities taken from the layouts and have been priced using 

vendor quotations from South African suppliers.

Costs include infrastructure such as HT reticulation lines and power requirements outside 

the plant fence line.    

27.2.6 P ower s upply 

Power will be supplied at 33KV to the plant from the national power grid which is within 10 

kilometres of the plant.  An overhead line will be run from the existing overhead power line 

to the plant site. A 33kV-6.6kV MV transformer will be installed in the plant main switch 

yard. 

Power will be supplied via 6.6kV overhead lines to the two ore bodies, water bore-field 

pump stations, tailings return water pumps and the management camp. The balance of the 

plant and administration & security buildings will be supplied by cables in trenches & along 

pipe racks.  

The costs for all overhead power lines can be found in the plant electrical cost build-up. 

27.2.7 Ins trumentation 

Costs for instrumentation have been obtained from South African suppliers based on the 

instrumentation as detailed in the piping and instrument diagrams which can be found in 

the appendices to Section 20 - Process Plant of the feasibility study document. 

27.2.8 S truc tural s teel, plate &  tank work 

Supply and fabrication costs are based on steel and plate work fabricators quotations 

obtained in South Africa. No single suitable workshop has been identified capable of 

producing the fabricated steelwork in Côte d'Ivoire in the required project time line. There 

are however workshops capable of supplying assistance for any on site rectification work. 

Steel imported into the Côte d'Ivoire is generally of European (Euronorm) grade which has 

a lower yield strength than steel sourced from South Africa, this would in effect increase the 

estimated tonnes by approximately 20% for fabricated plate and tank work and 18% for 

structural steel buildings. It was therefore decided to use South African suppliers as the 

basis for the Steel cost build-up. 

Tonnages are based on a steelwork bill of quantities developed from preliminary designs 

and layout drawings. 

27.2.9 P iping and valves  

Costs for piping and valves have been obtained from South African suppliers based on the 

line selection as detailed in the piping and instrument diagrams which can be found in the 

appendices to Section 20 - Process Plant of the feasibility study document. Quantities for 

pipe line lengths have been measured from the plant area layout drawings.

27.2.10 T rans port 

 The price is based on mechanical equipment, electrical equipment and valves being 

transported from South Africa and includes for insurance of goods in transit.   

 The volume of freight has been estimated from the equipment lists and various bills of 

quantities. 

 Steelwork, plate work, piping and valves will be sourced in South Africa and will be 

subject to international transport costs. 

 The port of call in Côte d'Ivoire will be Abidjan. Cargo will then be loaded onto trucks 

and transported to site by road.  A South African freight forwarding agent has provided 

costs for transportation and clearing of goods into Côte d'Ivoire. 

27.2.11 P lant infras truc ture  

 MDM has prepared a capital cost estimate as per the scope described in Section 22 of 

the feasibility study document (Ref 1024/KG/001) and generally as listed below. 

Material quantities were calculated from first principles and the bill of quantities was 

issued to a Ghanaian company for construction costing. 

  All buildings of brick or block-work construction. 

  All Internal plant roads. 

  Plant sewerage. 

  Potable water. 

  All plant fencing. 

  All building furniture and fittings excluding computers and computer software.

27.2.13 E P C M 

  Engineering design, procurement and construction management (EPCM) costs have 

been developed using a projected project duration of 20 months. Every endeavour 

would be made to attempt to shorten this projected timeline. 

  EPCM costs include for the design, procurement and construction management of 

both the plant and camp infrastructure requirements. 

  The estimated cost has been developed using current MDM discipline charge out 

rates. These rates are reviewed annually in March of each year and are adjusted to 

meet industry standards. 

27.2.14 C ontrac tors  margin 

This assumes that an EPCM contract is signed with the main contractor, and as a result of 

this includes an allowance for 'contractor's margin' (mark-up). A figure of 8% has been 

allowed for.  

27.3 Other C apital C os t E s timates  

The following costs are capital expenditure that will be incurred, but would be exempt of the 

MDM contractor's margin as they would be purchased directly by Etruscan personnel. The 

basis for the cost estimation is as detailed below. 

27.3.1 F irs t fills  and c ons umables

28.2.2 G eneral 

 The process plant operating costs were estimated by MDM on the following basis: 

  Power costs are based on power drawn from the national power grid. Supply will be 

33 kV power to the HT switchgear on the plant site.  The cost per kWh has been quoted 

by the Ivorian National Power Utility and applied to the power consumer list for the 

process plant and project operating hours.  The National Power Utility supplied MDM 

with a unit power cost of USD 0.081/kWh. 

  Labour rates are based rates applied to similar operations being operated by the 

Client in the region. The labour complement is based on provision for shift operating 8-

hour shifts. Labour costing also includes for employee holidays. Annual leave has been 

allowed for local employees. Expatriate work roster has been based on 10 weeks on 

and 3 weeks off. 

  Reagent consumptions have been determined on the basis of laboratory testwork 

and industry experience.  Requests for quotations were made to local and international 

vendors for current reagent pricing. Reagents prices applied here have been quoted 

CIF Abidjan. 

  Media consumption rates were provided by major equipment vendors based on 

testwork data and on industry experience.  Costing was based on current vendor 

pricing for forged steel balls. 

  Raw water will be drawn from Pit Dewatering Boreholes to be located on the 

periphery of the open pit. Water from the boreholes will be pumped into day tanks from 

where it will be pumped to the plant raw water or process water dam. A second source 

of water will possibly be the water diversion dam up stream of the tailings storage 

facility. This will be a seasonal supply. 

  The potable water for the plant and camp will be supplied by a potable water plant to 

be installed on site. Raw water will be treated through the potable water plant to provide 

water suitable for consumption. Potable water will also be used for all plant safety 

showers. 

  Costs are expressed in United States dollars as at June 2009. 

  Accuracy of the estimates is ±10% 

  A contingency of 10% has been included in the operating costs in line with the 

accuracy of ±10% in the calculation of the costs.

28.2.8 P lant Dies el and P lant E quipment 

The cost of plant diesel includes diesel used as fuel for the regeneration kiln, elution 

heaters, smelting furnace and fuel for the standby power generator for critical equipment. 

Diesel usage for elution heaters is based on 25 elutions per month, a 17hr elution cycle and 

diesel consumption rates as supplied by the vendor. The regeneration kiln diesel usage is 

based on 25 elutions per month, a 20hr batch regeneration time, and consumption data 

from the vendor. Diesel usage for the standby power genset is based on a maximum 

utilisation of 10% of the annual available time.  

28.2.9 Maintenanc e C os ts  

The cost of maintenance is estimated from a percentage of combined mechanical 

equipment, steel, electrical, instrumentation, piping and valve costs (nominal 5.00% per 
annum).  This has been applied using an expected profile over the life of mine.  Based on 
this principle, an average of $ 1.10 per tonne has been applied over the life of mine.

29 P R OJ E C T  IMP L E ME NT AT ION 

29.1 Introduc tion 

The aim of this section is to outline the implementation plan for the successful execution of 

the proposed new gold extraction plant and associated infrastructure at the Agbaou gold 

deposit. 

29.1.1 Nature of Implementation 

The nature of the implementation plan is driven by the project site location, the prevalent 

weather conditions and timing of the rainy season, the regulations governing construction in 

Cote d'Ivoire and the anticipated efficiency levels of the construction teams.  The most cost 

effective type approach in the current market conditions would be for a Reimbursable Type 

Contract with a Main Contractor responsible for the overall project design and 

management, with turnkey Packages for the major equipment supply, civil construction, 

structural steel and plate work fabrication, power supply and transportation of goods to site. 

29.1.2 As s umptions  

This study is based on the most practical and cost effective method of project execution.  

The Main Contractor, using local sub-contractors and labour as much as possible, will 

supervise the design and construction of the plant.  The mine infrastructure construction will 

be carried out by local, or West African, contractors but will be supervised by the Main 

Contractor.  All road building, civil excavation and civil construction work will be done using 

local contractors employing local labour all supervised by the main contractor.  Quotes 

have been obtained for the fabrication of steelwork and plate work in South Africa, working 

under the supervision of the Main Contractor. All erection work would be carried out under 

the supervision of the Main Contractor. Included in the supervisory team will be quality 

control and expediting personnel, who will ensure that fabrication schedules and quality of 

work are acceptable to the project.  Tools and equipment will be imported to carry out the 

construction work as required and will be supplemented by hired heavy equipment where 

deemed necessary. 

The Main Contractor will be responsible for contracting with all local sub-contractors.

Namely; 

 Bulk earthworks & road building contractor 

 Civil construction contractor 

 Fabrication contractor 

 Erection contractor 

29.1.3 C ritic al Drivers  &  F as t Trac king 

The following are the critical drivers influencing the implementation plan of the Agbaou 

Gold Mine Project:  

There will be front-end activities required for confirmation of feasibility study data, before 

any physical work can be done and these include:  

 Permitting as required  

 Appointment of the Main and sub-contractors 

 Obtaining the appropriate finance.  

 Orders must be placed according to the project programme to ensure that the standby 

power generation-set, min-subs and construction craneage arrive on site prior to the 

commencement of construction  

Project phases 

In order to plan this project the execution programme has been divided into four phases. 

Phase 1 being this feasibility study. The other phases are dependent on funding and are as 

follows: 

Phase 2 – Award of Reimbursable Contract 

The main reimbursable contract will be negotiated and completed by the end of May 2010. 

This period will encompass design optimisation coupled with in-country sourcing and 

ratification of suppliers who will be requested to submit fixed and firm prices for the various 

pieces of equipment. Identification and general inspection of suitable second hand 

equipment will, if appropriate, also take place during this period. 

Detailed Design and Approval Stage 

This phase will include the detail design of the plant and infrastructure, coupled with the 

approvals as required by the Ivorian authorities. This phase is to be completed by the end 

October 2010.

Construction Execution 

This phase is the physical construction of the plant and infrastructure and, funding 

permitting, the main works will start in September 2010.  All construction activities will be in 

accordance with the attached Construction Programme. 

Further critical drivers influencing the implementation are as follows: 

 The excavation and construction capabilities of the civil contractors 

 Procurement of long lead mechanical equipment especially the mill and main 

transformers 

 Initial accommodation and camp facilities will be limited. 

29.1.4 C ons truc tion S trategy 

Initial construction activities can only commence during the dry season.  Preferably all road 

works should be scheduled for completion prior to the rainy season.  The construction 

efficiency has been taken into account in the construction programme during this period. 

The major milestones for the completion of the project are as follows: 

 Detail design complete by end January 2011 

 Commence plant civil works in December 2010 

 Erect sufficient buildings to allow for efficient construction activities. 

29.2 P rojec t Management 

All Discipline personnel will be deployed in accordance with the project organogram. 

The project will be executed on a functional matrix basis, with resource allocation dictated 

by the project requirements. To facilitate this, a functional project structure will be 

implemented, based on separating the process plant from the infrastructure.  

The key players and their functions are found in Figure 29.2-1.

30.1 R is k F ramework and Methodology 

The framework for risk assessment is based on the Australian Standard for Risk 

Management, AS4360: 1999 and is shown in Figure 30.1-1. 

Figure 30.1-1Risk assessment framework 
 

The following methodology describes the steps involved in fulfilling each stage of the risk 

management process for the Agbaou gold project. 

30.1.1 S tage 1 - E s tablis h the context 

The context was an assessment of the risks associated with the development and 

operation of the project, and to incorporate actions where appropriate into the Feasibility 

Study. Risk mitigation actions that could be incorporated into the Study were identified, 

together with other actions that would be more appropriately managed during future stages 

of project development.  

As part of establishing the context: 

 Objectives for the exercise were set; 

 Likelihood and consequence descriptors were established in line with the project and its 

objectives, and 

 Risk criteria against which to evaluate risks were set.  

30.1.2 S tage 2 - R is k identific ation 

The engineers responsible for those areas identified risks in each of the main project areas.   

Each risk is described as follows: 

 Risk explanation (a reasonably detailed explanation of the risk); 

 Contributing factors (causes); 

 Consequences, and 

 Existing or proposed control effectiveness (control strengths and control weaknesses). 

30.1.3 S tage 3 - R is k analys is  and evaluation (ris k as s es s ment) 

Following risk identification, semi-quantitative risk analysis was conducted on each risk 

using descriptors of Likelihood and Consequence prepared below (Tables 30.1-1 and 30.1-

2).

attached to licences and 
contracts with the 
Government remain 
untouched despite political 
turmoil. 

Legal risk to 
utilisation of mine 
footprint.

Agbaou Village. A cave 
was identified during the 
baseline study but no 
cultural sites were 
mentioned. 

Changes to land 
capability and land 
use 

Certain Major  Extreme The mine footprint will 
affect the predominant land 
use of agriculture 
(plantations and fields).  

A census of the fields 
owned in the areas 
affected by the mine 
footprint has been 
conducted. This will be 
updated prior to final 
compensation. 

The final land use of the 
site is affected by the 
management of the waste 
rock dumps and tailings 
facilities during operations. 

Relocation of 13 
small villages 

Likely Major High The mine footprint will 
impact on 13 villages in the 
area that will require 
relocation.  

A Displacement and 
Relocation Plan (DRP) has 
been developed to 
determine and manage the 
compensation activities. 

Visual impact of 
mining 

Likely Moderate Significant The hilly topography of the 
area and the location of the 
deposits provides for 
localised visual impact.  

The remote nature of the 
site limits the scale of the 
visual impact of mining and 
clearance of vegetation.

specific areas for the 
conservation of special 
habitats for endangered 
species of flora and fauna. 

The environmental 
department will be 
responsible for staff 
awareness of important 
sites and issues of 
biodiversity.

plan for all reagents, water 
types and sources, oils, 
hydraulic fluids and mine 
waste will be implemented 
to reduce erosion and soil 
contamination. 

During closure an 
assessment of soil fertility 
will be conducted. 

Disruption of local 
water supply in wells 
in Agbaou Village 

Possible Minor Moderate Dewatering water from the 
bore field and the open pits 
will be released to 
surrounding watercourses 
after sedimentation. 

A groundwater study will be 
undertaken to determine 
the dewatering effects on 
the local water supplies. 

Where an impact is 
experienced the affected 
villages will become part of 
a rural water supply project 
as part of the sustainable 
development plan. 

Alteration of stream 
flow volumes and 
patterns 

Certain  Moderate High The excess dewatering 
water will discharge into 
the Gbadjo Stream which 
will increase flows and 
modify seasonal patterns.  

This may alter the riverine 
ecology sampled during the 
baseline study.  

The stream diversion will 
affect the aquatic fauna 
along the stretch of the 
Gbadjo Stream through 
habitat change.

Table 30.2.2 summarised the principal risks to the Project.  Risks that are either extreme or 

high require further work on mitigation during detailed engineering.

Where possible hedging programs will be put in place to mitigate risks associated with the 

fluctuations in the international marketplace. Both finance and expenditures are largely 

dollar denominated thus reducing exchange rate risks. 

30.2.3 Alteration of ground water quality  

Taking due cognisance of all the information available and keeping in mind that a more 

conservative approach is advisable until more site specific information becomes available, 

the aquifer(s) underlying the proposed mining area may be classified as either a minor

aquifer system which may occur along narrow sections where pockets of 

weathering/fracturing in hard bedrock prevail. This system may be important as a local 

supply of water (existing camp). These systems may allow for substantial abstraction which 

can be utilised to provide water for use in the surrounding area.  The degree to which the 

system can be used to supply water must therefore be more accurately determined to 

understand the importance of protecting the resource. 

Another factor that is of high importance is the observation of very shallow groundwater 

levels across the area. Due to the shallow ground water levels it is likely that contamination 

of groundwater will occur easily from the pollution plumes created by the various mining 

facilities if not mitigated. The degree to which the impact on the groundwater will occur will 

depend to a large degree on the degree to which the contamination is contained within 

bunded areas and the degree to which the clay layer which will be used to seal the facility 

will contain contaminated water.  A numerical groundwater modelling exercise is to be 

undertaken to characterise the area that could possibly be contaminated and to aid in the 

mitigation of the impact from the various facilities. 

30.2.4 R eloc ation of affec ted communities  

The RAP identified 185 people requiring relocation from 21 families of 13 small villages. 

The relocation of these communities is a high risk to the operation and the success of the 

activities will be based on regular community consultation and involvement in the decision 

making process. A method of auditing and feedback of the success of the activities will be 

implemented during the compensation and relocation activities. 

30.2.5 A los s  of land us e 

The mine footprint will definitely cause a change in the existing land use. There are 

currently a large number of farmers (76) in the area with plantations of coffee and cocoa 

and fields for growing food crops. Areas where tailings are deposited will definitely 

experience a change in land use.   

The loss of future resources for agriculture and forestry activities is likely to occur.  By 

preventing and minimising the impacts of spills and by ensuring adequate bunding of the 

various facilities, the extent of the contamination plume, in some cases can be limited to a 

smaller area. 

30.2.6 S oil and Water Degradation 

Contamination plumes and spills from the mine facilities may degrade the fertility of the 

surrounding soils. The salinisation of soil may prevent natural vegetation from establishing 

in areas where soils are contaminated.

A groundwater modelling exercise is to be undertaken to characterise and define the area 

that may be contaminated and to aid in the mitigation of the impact from the various 

facilities.  Areas of contaminated soil must be rehabilitated by the removal and treatment of 

contaminated soil at the time of decommissioning. 

30.2.7 L os s  of P rotec ted and E ndangered F lora and F auna S pec ies  

A range of terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna were identified in and around the project 

area that require particular measures of management. These measures will include 

identification of special habitat area, mostly primary forest areas, for conservation; the 

management of the aquatic systems in the project area and the elevation of community 

awareness for the importance of these animals to be protected. This will also occur through 

the sustainable development program which will aim to encourage alternative sources of 

income through farming and livestock rearing. 

30.2.8 Ac id Mine Drainage  

An ABA assessment of the laterite, saprolite, saprock and bedrock samples was conducted 

and indicated a low level potential for the production of ARD.  

It is essential that an assessment be conducted on a typical sample of tailings material that 

would be produced from the process plant prior to project construction.

31.1 P rojec t E conomic s  and C onc lus ion 

The economic evaluation of the Agbaou Gold Project presented in this Feasibility Study 

and prepared jointly by Etruscan and MDM assumes the project will be 100 percent equity 

financed.  Etruscan considers the project to be a good candidate for a combination of a 

dollar loan, equipment lease and equity financing.  The effect of including debt financing on 

the Base Case economics is to increase the rate of return to the equity owners by virtue of 

a leveraging effect. 

For the purposes of the study, the evaluation is based on 100 percent of the project cash 

flows before distribution of profits to the equity owners.  Before-tax annual cash flows are 

discounted at rates of 0 percent and 10 percent.   

The results of the economic analysis indicate that exploitation of the Agbaou Gold Deposit 

is economically viable and should proceed.  The Base Case cash flows and economic 

summary are included in Table 31.2-1. 

31.2 B as e C as e E conomic s  

The Base Case 100 percent-equity financed scenario, using a constant gold price of 

US$1,000 per ounce, indicates a before-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24.9 percent.  

Cumulative before-tax cash flows are US$187million over a 9 year mine life.  Etruscan has 

concluded that the Base Case life-of-mine cash flows are completely sheltered from Ivory 

Coast corporate income taxes given the significant amount of sunk exploration costs, 

acquisition costs and capital costs.   

The initial capital and payback period are US$106 million and 4 years respectively. 

Direct operating costs (mining, processing and administrative) average $516per ounce of 

gold produced over the mine life with another $3 per ounce for annual TSF and reclamation 

costs.  The total cash costs, including the 3% royalty payable to the State of Ivory Coast, 

are estimated at $546 per ounce over life of mine. 

A constant gold price of US$1,000 per ounce has been applied and is considered by 

Etruscan, in view of the appreciating trend of the gold price, to be a reasonable estimate for 

the average life of mine price.  While the current spot price is approximately US$1,000 

assumption, the present forward selling rates could achieve the base case US$1,000 price.   

Using a constant gold price of US$1,200 per ounce, the before-tax internal rate of return 

increases to 39.1 percent.

31.3.1 Initial F ixed C apital C os ts  

Initial fixed capital costs, including working capital and owners' costs, total US$112 million 

and are summarized in Table 31.3-1.  For equipment, the costs are the delivered, installed 

costs including import duties where applicable.  No escalation has been assumed in the 

capital costs, nor allowances made for capitalized interest or country risk insurance.  

Interest charges and country risk insurance are treated as financing costs and considered 

as part of an overall financing package.  Additionally the capital costs do not recognize the 

impact of export credits which Etruscan believes could be available for the Project.   

The Project construction and commissioning of the CIL mill is assumed to occur over a 20-

month period starting from the date of a decision-to-proceed.  For the purposes of feasibility 

analysis, it has been assumed that all initial capital will be expended in the 20 months 

immediately prior to production.

Total initial fixed capital costs $106,106,000 

 
The feasibility cash flows exclude the sunk exploration and development costs incurred to 

date, feasibility study costs and Etruscan overhead. 

31.3.2 Deferred C apital C os ts  

Deferred capital costs net of estimated salvage value approximate US$12 million.  This 

figure comprises US$22 million for sustaining capital expenditures and a credit of US$10 

million for estimated salvage value.

Deferred capital costs are comprised of mining related expenditures relating to the 

deployment of additional mining gear as well as mine development costs including haulage 

roads, expansion of the tailings storage facility, replacement of the fleet of light vehicles 

and final site rehabilitation.  Table 31.3-2 presents the details as to the composition and 

timing of expenditure for the deferred capital costs. 

The salvage provision was calculated as 20% of the original cost of the identifiable plant 

and equipment items that were deemed to have a useful life beyond the feasibility mine life.

31.5 Working C apital 

During the initial weeks of mine operation and mill commissioning while gold inventory is 

building up in the process circuit, and before cash is received from the sale of gold, working 

capital is required to meet operating expenses.  Working capital is estimated to be 60 days 

of Year 1 operating expenses or approximately US$5.9 million.  This figure is included as 

part of the initial project capital cost to be financed and is shown separately on the cash 

flow schedules in Year 1.  The working capital is assumed to be recouped in the final year 

of the Project. 

The initial stocks of consumables and strategic spare parts have been provided for 

separately within the Project capital costs.  Ongoing purchases of supplies and parts are 

treated as operating costs. 

31.6 G old R efining, S hipping and Ins urance 

Gold output from the Agbaou Mine operation will be in the form of doré bars containing 

approximately 85 percent gold, the balance being primarily silver.  Silver credits are 

assumed to be negligible for purposes of the economic evaluation.   The doré bars are not 

anticipated to contain any deleterious elements. 

The doré will be shipped to Europe for refining.  Based on typical refining charges, the 

breakdown of costs is set out below. 

Refining Charge  US$0.50/oz gold   

Shipping & insurance US$2.25/oz gold 

Total US$2.70/oz gold 

It is anticipated that penalties for any impurities will not be significant. 

31.7 R oyalties  

The Ivory Coast Mining Code provides for a 3 percent gross proceeds royalty payable to 

the State of Ivory Coast on all gold production in the country.  This royalty is deductible for 

purposes of calculating Ivory Coast corporate income tax.  Life-of-mine royalties payable to 

the State of Ivory Coast total US$19.9 million which equates to US$1.82 per tonne of ore 

processed or approximately US$30 per ounce of recovered gold.

31.8 Inflation and E xc hange R ates  

The Base Case cash flow projections are made in constant dollars without escalation for 

either costs or metal prices.  All dollar amounts are reported in United States currency 

since metal prices are denominated in US dollars and most of the operating costs are 

quoted in that currency, as well as a significant portion of the capital costs. 

The Rand denominated initial capital costs aggregate R459.5 million. Etruscan has 

instructed MDM to use an exchange rate of R9.50/US$1 which calculates a value of 

US$48.4 million for these costs. This amount represents 50% of the total initial capital 

costs.   

The Rand to US dollar exchange rate has ranged from 6.5:1 to 10.3:1 during the past 

twelve months.  Table 31.8-1 summarizes the results from applying exchange rates of 6.5, 

7.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5,10 and 10.5.

A number of guarantees and tax allowances are included in the Ivory Coast commercial 

legislation. The State guarantees the right of ownership, freedom of management, free 

transfer of capital and returns and stability of agreements made under this law.  The Mining 

Code and tax legislation also provide for a VAT exoneration on imports and exoneration of 

import taxes (except the regional statistical tax and two community/solidarity taxes 

amounting to 2.5%) on all mining and construction equipment, materials, spare parts during 

the construction phase, prior to the production phase. The VAT exoneration does not 

extend to goods purchased locally but extends to imported goods transferred from Etruscan 

Resources Côte d'Ivoire SARL to the exploitation company.

The tax on industrial profits including mining operations is 25% and the tax legislation 

provides for a five year exoneration starting on the date of first commercial production.  

Preproduction exploration costs are permitted to be amortized over a five year period 

starting with the first year of production and accelerated depreciation is permitted for certain 

capital equipment.  Losses may be carried forward a maximum of five years. 

A tax on additional profits is also applicable at a rate of 40% of the additional profit.  

"Additional Profit" is defined as profits less rate of return of investment after payment of 

corporate income tax.  "Rate of return of investment" is defined as rate of return of 

investment as stated by the instrument granting the mining title and comprised between 

LIBOR times two and LIBOR times three. 

Distributions of dividends to the shareholders of the exploitation company will be subject to 

a 12% withholding tax when paid from taxed earnings.  A withholding tax rate of 18% 

applies when dividends are paid from tax exempted earnings. 

Etruscan has concluded that the Base Case life-of-mine cash flows are completely 

sheltered from Ivory Coast corporate income taxes given the significant amount of sunk 

exploration costs, acquisition costs and capital costs. 

The Mining Code provides for a 3 percent royalty payable quarterly to the State of Ivory 

Coast on all gold production.  The royalty is calculated on the quarterly revenues less 

refining and transportation costs. 

In addition to the taxes above noted, the exploitation company will be also subject to the 

following taxes and fees: 

 A fixed fee at the time the industrial scale exploitation permit is granted, renewed, 

transferred or extended, ranging from CFA 1,000,000 (US$2,026) to CFA to 2,000,000 

(US$4,053); 

 An annual surface fee set at CFA 50,000 (US$101) per year per square kilometre; 

 A withholding tax at the rate of 18% on the income from interests on loans by local or 

foreign financial institutions, subject to fiscal treaties. The rate is 9% if the loan is for a 

minimum of three years, granted by foreign financial institutions and for purchase of 

equipment; 

 A withholding tax at the rate of 20% on remuneration for services paid to suppliers who 

do not have a place of business in Ivory Coast.  However this is subject to fiscal treaties 

with various countries which may provide for a total exemption or lower rates;

 Employer remittances on salaries of local employees (2.8%) and expat employees 

(12%); 

 National Reconstruction Tax at a rate of 2% calculated on the operating expense 

(before tax) account figure in the financial statement.

The feasibility study has concluded that the Agbaou gold reserves can be easily treated by 

a conventional CIL and gravity processing facility. Similar facilities are currently in operation 

in Cote I'voire and other countries throughout West Africa. The plant design was based on 

the results of the extensive metallurgical test program completed on actual Agbaou core 

samples, which showed the suitability of the CIL/gravity treatment plant. The ore will be 

extracted and delivered to the plant from three open pits using conventional mining 

practices and equipment. 

The extensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) carried out as part of the feasibility 

study has concluded that the project can be developed in an environmentally responsible 

manner with significant economic benefits to the country and the local communities. A 

comprehensive Environmental Management System will be developed to facilitate and 

control the environmental and social aspects during the development and operation of the 

project. 

The reoptimization of the pits at US$1,000 gold resulted in a signicant increase in reserve 

ounces to 730 kozs from the 567 kozs reported in the previous issue of the feasibility study. 

The ore tonnage also increased from 7.44 Mt to 10.94 Mt giving an extra approximate three 

years of mine life at the 1.2 MTPA treatment rate. 

The capital cost estimate was updated resulting in a reduction in the overall capital cost of 

the project. For the re-costing, only second hand equipment was considered for the mills, at 

75% of the cost for new mills. During project implementation there is a potential to reduce 

the capital costs by up to US$5.0 million by utilising second hand equipment for other big 

ticket items, namely the crushing equipment and power transformers. 

The current throughput for the process plant was designed for 1.2 MTPA, and considering 

the increased ore tonnages from the new reserve, it is possible to increase to 1.5 MTPA to 

improve the economy of scale. As a high level scaling exercise, based on similar projects, it 

is estimated that this would increase the process plant capital cost estimate by 

approximately 16% and would increase the overall project capital cost by 11%. This would 
mainly account for the resizing of the major equipment, such as the mills and pumps. 

The financial analyses are based on the scenario of 100% equity financing for the project.  

The base case model assumes a constant price of gold of US$1,000/oz and generates a 

pre-tax IRR of 24.9%.  The forecast capital payback time is 4 years. If a constant gold price 

of US$1,200 is used, the pre-tax IRR becomes 39.1%.

Agbaou Gold Mine 
Ref: 1024/KG/000 

Page 338 

Sensitivity analysis shows that at a base case gold price of US$1,000 per ounce, a 10% 

reduction in operating costs, coupled with a 20% reduction in the initial capital costs, would 

result in pre-tax IRR increasing to 37.4%. 

 
The updated project is significantly more robust than the original project and presents a 

financial case to proceed with development of the Agbaou Gold Project. Although the 

US$1,000 spot gold price is presently not consistently attained, forward selling of all or part 

of the production would allow this price level to be achieved at the current gold forward 

premium levels. At US$900 gold the project is still viable with the pre-tax IRR being 17.2%.

It is recommended that Etruscan Resources Inc (Etruscan): 

 Develop a detailed mine implementation plan. 

 Revisit contractor mining to reduce capital costs. 

 Revisit the capital cost estimates in general for possible savings due to the recent down 

turn in the market place and the availability of big ticket used equipment items on the 

grinding mills. 

 Further review the capability of local civil and steelwork contractors for possible 

savings. 

 Reassess the geotechnical aspects in terms of optimizing the blasting and "diggability" 

of the rock as well as improving of pit wall angles. 

 Optimize bench heights to minimize mining dilution and improve ore recovery control. 

 Review the requirement for a computerized fleet management system. 

 Continue exploration of the satellite deposits around the main Agbaou deposit to 

increase reserves and the life of the project. 

 Continue negotiations with the regional power authorities on fixing the supply load and 

power rates.
