1 Summary 
This report was prepared as a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report 
on Resources (Technical Report) for NioCorp Development, Ltd. (NioCorp or the Company) by 
SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK or the Consultants) on the Elk Creek Niobium Deposit (Elk Creek 
or the Project) located in southeast Nebraska, United States of America (USA). NioCorp was 
formerly known as Quantum Rare Earth Developments Corp. (Quantum) but changed its name to 
NioCorp Developments Ltd (NioCorp) effective March 4, 2014. 

1.1 Property Description and Ownership 
Elk Creek is an early stage exploration project located in southeast Nebraska, USA. It is located 
Approximately 75 km southeast of Lincoln, Nebraska, the state capital and 110 km south of Omaha, 
Nebraska. The mineralization is centered about 40°16'0.3.5" N latitude and 96°11'08.5" E longitude. 
The area is well developed with direct access to roads, rail, supply and distribution companies and a 
local work force, for heavy equipment operators, geologist can be sourced from local universities, but 
for experienced mining related workforce the nearest center of expertise is Denver Colorado eight 
hours drive west of the Project. The deposit is located within U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 
Tecumseh Quadrangle Nebraska SE (7.5 minute series) mapsheet in Sections 1-6, 9-11; Township 
3N; Range 11 and Sections 19-23, 25-36; Township 4N, Range 11.  

The Property consists of 64 lease agreements covering approximately 3,802 ha. Lease agreements 
are between NioCorp's subsidiary Elk Creek Resources Corp (ECRC) and the individual land 
owners. ECRC is a Nebraska based and wholly owned subsidiary of NioCorp. NioCorp retains 100% 
of the mineral rights to the Project and is the operator. The agreements are in the form of five-year 
pre-paid Exploration Lease Agreements (ELA), with an Option to Purchase (OTP) the mineral rights 
at the end of the lease. The individual land owners have title to the surface and subsurface rights, 
and the agreements are primarily with respect to only the mineral interest of each property, where 
required the Company have obtained surface rights to be able to access and complete the 
exploration work completed to date. 

The agreements are due for renewal during 2015 and the Company is currently in the process of 
renegotiating a five year extension for key areas. 

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 
The Project includes the Elk Creek Carbonatite (the Carbonatite) that intruded older Precambrian 
granitic and low- to medium-grade metamorphic basement rocks. Both the Carbonatite and 
Precambrian rocks are interpreted to be unconformably overlain by approximately 200 m of 
Palaeozoic marine sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian age. As a result of this thick cover, there is 
no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, which was identified and targeted 
through magnetic surveys and confirmed through subsequent drilling. The available magnetic data 
indicates dominant northeast, west-northwest striking lineaments and secondary northwest and north 
oriented features that mimic the position of regional faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the 
Nemaha Uplift.  

The Carbonatite hosts significant niobium and is composed predominantly of dolomite, calcite and 
ankerite, with lesser chlorite, barite, phlogopite, pyrochlore, serpentine, fluorite, sulfides and quartz.

Niobium is contained within the mineral pyrochlore and REE mineralization is reported to occur as 
bästnasite, parisite, synchysite and monazite. The Niobium has been the main element of interest for 
the current study. No estimation or evaluation of the REE has been completed to date. 

1.3 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 
Drilling at the Project was conducted in three phases. The first was during the 1970's and 1980's by 
the Molybdenum Company of America (Molycorp), the second in 2011 by Quantum, and the third 
and latest program in 2014 by NioCorp. To date, 116 diamond core holes have been completed for a 
total of 55,228 m over the entire Project life. Inclusive of this drilling within the Project a total of 34 
holes for 21,762.5 m have been completed to date and used in the current Mineral Resource 
Estimate.  

All drilling has been completed using a combination of Tricone, Reverse Circulation (RC) or Diamond 
(DDH) drilling in the upper portion of the hole within the Pennsylvanian sediments. All drilling within 
the Carbonatite has been completed using DDH methods. 

SRK has reviewed and validated the electronic database provided and concludes that the sampling 
methods, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), and database management practices 
employed by NioCorp are all at or above industry standards and are suitable for use in resource 
estimation.  

1.4 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Initial metallurgical testwork has been completed by Molycorp and Quantum which confirmed the 
presence of Nb2O5, and is susceptible to floatation. 

In support of the current study during 2014, characterization of the Mineral Resource was 
undertaken at Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado (Hazen) and at SGS laboratories in Lakefield, 
Ontario (SGS). The laboratories were provided with drill core samples representative of the resource, 
and have completed testing to define the mineralogy of the resource as well as to separate and 
recover niobium-bearing minerals. The results from both laboratories confirmed a deployment of 
approximately 77% of the niobium occurs as pyrochlore, while the balance occurs in an iron-titanium-
niobium oxide mineral of varying composition. The assumption is that pyrochlore will be more 
amenable to processing via known methods used at other operations, with a degree of optimization 
required to refine the processing flowsheet. Further substantial detailed testing, optimization and 
analysis will be required to define a process flowsheet for the project and to refine the actual 
technical and financial viability of the Project. 

The current work which is based on bench scale testwork provides ranges for niobium recovery in 
flotation of between 61% to 84%, with varying degrees of mass pull (9% to 42%). SRK currently 
assumes an overall metallurgical recovery of 60% for the basis of the cut-off grade (CoG) 
calculation, but further work including additional bench scale work and pilot plant testwork will be 
required to provide a higher level of confidence in the overall recovery for the Project.  

SRK comments that the Metallurgical testwork is on-going at the time of reporting with more detailed 
results expected in early 2015. Any significant changes in the metallurgical recovery are likely to 
impact on the CoG used for the Mineral Resource.

1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation 
of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and are reported in 
accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on 
Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines, May 10, 2014. 

The drillhole database used in the estimation is of high quality and has been independently verified 
by SRK. A three-dimensional geologic model was constructed using ARANZ Leapfrog Mining 
Software. Modeling was based on logged geology in the drilling database, using a combination of 
geological controls and Niobium grade shells. The grade estimation was confined to a hard boundary 
of three grade shell domains defined at 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5% niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5%), with the 
estimation using only the composited samples from the same domain.  

The Nb2O5% grade estimation utilized an Ordinary Kriging (OK) algorithm supported by the 6.0 m 
sample composites for the Carbonatite units, and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to a Power of 2 
for the mafic units (Mafic and Lamprophyre). Search distances were determined from omni-
directional variograms calculated using the capped and composited samples. A nested search 
ellipse estimation method consisting of three passes was used. The search ellipse has been rotated 
into the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit. Density has been assigned based on the major 
rock types, using the mean grades from routine density measurements using a combination of 
weight in air/weight in water, and volumetric analysis. Resources are reported as Nb2O5. 

SRK has validated the Mineral Resource estimates using a number of different validation techniques. 

• Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades; 
• Comparative Statistical study versus composite data and alternative estimation methods; 

and 
• Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (Swath Plots). 

In the opinion of SRK, the Mineral Resource estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation 
of the global Nb2O5 Mineral Resources found at Elk Creek at the current level of sampling. 

The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred according to 
CIM guidelines. Due to a lack of dense drilling (in the order of 35 m x 35 m), no Measured Mineral 
Resource has been assigned at this stage for the Project.  

Classification of the resources reflects the relative confidence of the grade estimates. This 
classification is based on several factors including; sample spacing relative to geological and geo-
statistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources, 
specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations, accuracy of topographic surface, 
quality of the assay data and many other factors, which influence the confidence of the mineral 
estimation. No single factor controls the resource classification rather each factor influences the 
result.  

Generally, most of the factors influencing the resource classification in the Project are positive. The 
resources have been classified as Indicated based primarily on confidence in the geological model 
and sample spacing. For the resource classification, a solid shape was constructed around the core 
of the deposit where most drillholes are spaced approximately 60 to 70 m apart, and blocks have 
been estimated with a minimum of two boreholes.

The Mineral Resources have been confined to estimated blocks within the Cabonatite. In order to 
determine the quantities of material offering "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" by an 
underground mining method, SRK has defined an underground mining CoG based on assumed 
costs, pricing and metallurgical recoveries. Costs and recoveries are based on bench mark studies 
completed of similar projects, and application of possible local variations. The Mineral Resource has 
been filtered to show all blocks above the mining CoG to ensure estimates form suitable mining 
targets and to identify isolated blocks of material reporting at the CoG, which would require removal 
since isolated blocks are unlikely to warrant the cost of development. No such cases of isolated 
blocs were found at Elk Creek and all material within the geological wireframes above a CoG of 0.3% 
Nb2O5 has been considered to have reasonable prospects of being mined via underground 
methods. 

The Mineral Resource for the Elk Creek Project is summarized in Table 1.5.1, with a summary of the 
sensitivity of the tonnage as grade to cut-off shown in Table 1.5.2.

• Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to 

reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate and have been used to derive subtotals, totals and weighted averages. Such 
calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, 
SRK does not consider them to be material. All composites have been capped where appropriate. The Concession is 
wholly owned by and exploration is operated by NioCorp Developments Ltd 

• The reporting standard adopted for the reporting of the Mineral Resource Estimate uses the terminology, definitions and 
guidelines given in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves (May, 2014) as required by NI 43-101. 

• SRK assumes the Elk Creek deposit to be amenable to a variety of Underground Mining methods. In the absence of 
definitive pricing for Nb and established rates of metallurgical recovery, SRK has reported the Mineral Resource at a 
CoG of 0.3% Nb2O5. The Company's previous Mineral Resource dated April 2012 was calculated at a CoG of 0.4% 
Nb2O5.

1.6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
SRK recommends that additional drilling be conducted to further investigate and develop the known 
mineralization at the Project. The deposit remains open laterally and at depth, but it is SRK 
understanding that the Company wishes to take the Project to a decision point as quickly as 
possible. 

SRK considers there to be sufficient Mineral Resource to focus on advancing the Project from 
exploration to an advanced exploration project, and therefore recommends the Company focus on 
increasing the confidence in the current Mineral Resource, in order to complete a detailed technical 
study (prefeasibility or feasibility). SRK has worked with the Company to defined the requirements to 
complete this drilling that is the focus of the Phase 2 and 3 drilling programs. 

The current proposed drilling requirements for Phase 2 and Phase 3 are shown in Table 1.6.1. 

Table 1.6.1: Proposed Drilling Requirements for Phase 2 and Phase 3 
Phase Number of Drillholes Cumulative Drill Depth 
Phase 2 6 5,175 m 
Phase 3 4 2,750 m 
Source: SRK, 2014 

 

SRK recommends the Company update the geological model and produce a Mineral Resource 
estimate at the end of Phase 2 before making a decision to evaluate the requirements of the Phase 3 
program in order to optimize the conversion of Inferred to Indicated material. Upon completion of 
Phase 3, SRK recommends the Company commence a technical engineering study of the Project. 

In addition to the recommended drilling program, SRK recommends a review of the historical 
Molycorp database for the 25 drillholes centered over the current Mineral Resource. The focus of the 
review should be to define any low-grade mafic units not included in the current data capture, and to 
identify where possible difference between dolomite-carbonatite "dolCarb" (currently logged) and 
magnetite-dolomite-carbonatite "mdolCarb", which represents higher grade material. The result of 
this analysis will allow for more detailed geological models and improved domaining in any future 
updates. 

SRK also comments that at this stage other more detailed technical studies need to be advanced for 
the following work: 

• Metallurgical testwork and Pilot plant testwork; 
• Geotechnical analysis; 
• Hydrogeological and hydrological studies; 
• Environmental assessment and permitting requirements; and 
• Infrastructure design. 

SRK notes that data collection for each of these studies has commenced, with the Company in the 
process of drilling a total of three vertical PQ diamond drillholes for sample collection for 
metallurgical testing. At the time of writing, the finalization of field programs for all areas is 
anticipated to be at the end of Phase 2 or 3 of the proposed drilling.

SRK considers there potential to increase the current Mineral Resources with some targeted 
exploration programs in the future. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike. SRK 
comments that in general material intersected at depth is higher grade than shallower material. SRK 
notes that the deeper extension will require drilling holes in excess of 1,000 m, and therefore the 
focus should currently be placed on increasing the confidence in the current estimate.  

SRK understands it is the Company intentions to develop the Elk Creek deposit to a decision point 
as quickly as possible. The estimated costs for the Engineering Studies and Exploration Program as 
proposed by SRK are illustrated in Table 1.6.2. SRK considers the proposed budget below will be 
sufficient to define the Project to a feasibility level of study.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 13 
 
 

NioCorp is currently negotiating with owners to obtain the surface and mineral rights to the Property 
situated to the northwest of Beethe_008 (shown as a white rectangle adjacent to the red line in 
Figure 4.3.1 and covering approximately 80 acres). At the time of writing this report negotiations are 
ongoing (personal communication, October 10, 2014). 

The current expiry date on the agreements is during 2015 with some due for renewal at the end of 
2014. SRK has discussed the current renewal process with NioCorp and understands that the 
Company is currently in the process of reviewing all 64 agreements, with particular focus on the 
leases covering or in close proximity to the Project.  

Discussion with NioCorp and review of the previous NI 43-101 describe the lease agreements and 
acquisition of the property by Quantum. Below is an excerpt from "Resource Estimate and Technical 
Report for the Elk Creek Nb-REE Project, Nebraska, USA", completed by Tetra Tech Waldrop (Tetra 
Tech) for Quantum and dated April 23, 2012.  

"The Property was acquired through 64 agreements between ECRC and individual land owners that 
are in the form of five-year pre-paid Exploration Lease Agreements (ELA), with an Option to 
Purchase (OTP) the mineral rights at the end of the lease. The individual land owners have title to 
the surface and subsurface rights, and the agreements are primarily with respect to only the mineral 
interest of each property.  

The property boundaries are set out in a written description of each individual lease agreement. This 
property description is based on the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), descriptions of lots, and 
written descriptions of surface features (rivers, fences, roads, etc.). 

The acquisition of the Elk Creek Property by Quantum involves the purchase of all of the issued and 
outstanding common shares of 859404 BC Ltd., ("859404") a private British Columbia company 
(Quantum News Release, Dec. 2010). 859404 holds 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of 
ECRC, the Nebraskan corporation that has secured individual agreements to acquire the mineral 
rights to the Elk Creek carbonatite. The property was held under a similar type of option agreement 
by Molycorp in the 1970's and 1980's. 

In consideration for the common shares of 859404, Quantum will pay a total of $500,000 and issue 
one common share of the Company for each common share of 859404 issued and outstanding. Of 
the total, $200,000 has been paid by Quantum on signing of the agreement with 859404 and the 
balance of cash and shares is payable upon acceptance by the TSX Exchange." 

4.3.1 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest 
As part of the exploration lease agreements where required the Company has also secured surface 
rights, the permits allow for access to farm land for the siting and requirements to conduct drilling 
activities.  

Some of the agreements include a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty (NSR) attached with the OTP. The 
agreements grant the operator an exclusive right to explore and evaluate the property for a period of 
60 months, with an option to purchase the mineral interest at any time during the term. 

4.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 
The leases covering the Project are 100% owned by NioCorp, and with the exception of a 2% NSR 
attached with the OTP, have no other outstanding royalties, agreements or encumbrances.

4.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

4.5.1 Environmental Liabilities 
Existing environmental liabilities at the Project site are related to the exploration activities that have 
been undertaken to date. The Project consists of undeveloped (in terms of mining), farm land with no 
previous mineral development, mining or milling history. No existing liabilities associated with the 
utility rights of way or the gravel highway in the Project area are the responsibility of the Company. 

Baseline environmental studies have been initiated. Studies to assess terrestrial, aquatic, and 
atmospheric conditions will be required. These studies require input from many sources, including 
stakeholders. Environmental impact assessment including biotic, abiotic, and socio-economic 
impacts will be assessed at various levels during state permitting efforts.  The Project will be subject 
to review under the State of Nebraska. At this time, it is uncertain whether Federal permitting is 
required for the Project. The Project could be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) and to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) national policies. 

NioCorp has initiated consultation with the local business community and required agencies. 

4.5.2 Required Permits and Status 
NioCorp owns the mineral rights to a 1,376 ha (9,400 acres) land position in southeast Nebraska, 
within this land position, the mineralization occupies approximately 280 ha (692 acres) of lease 
agreements. The deposit is comprised of the Elk Creek Carbonatite. The deposit hosts 
concentrations of niobium, rare earth elements and barium mineralization. 

The exploration work conducted to date on the Project has been completed under an Exploration 
Permit NE0211001 issued by the State of Nebraska, Department of Environmental Quality, which 
provided the Company with the rights to have 10 open boreholes active at the Project at a time. In 
addition to the exploration permit the Company acquired an exemption letter from the Department of 
Health and Human Services for the use of a handheld held Niton X-Ray Florescence Analyzer 
(Niton), used on drill core for preliminary analysis onsite. 

Subsequently, the proposed Project will be held to permitting requirements that are determined to be 
necessary by Johnson County, the State of Nebraska, and the USEPA and USACE national policies, 
such as the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C 4321) and the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq.). 

4.6 Other Significant Factors and Risks 
SRK notes that a potential Risk for the development of the Project relates to the issue of renewing 
the current lease agreements. SRK understands that the Company are currently in the process of 
renegotiating key lease agrees with the priority focusing on those directly above the mineralization 
and the surrounding leases, which may be required for surface infrastructure should the Project 
advance to more detailed levels of study. During this process SRK highlights the potential to gain 
additional material from reaching an agreement on the one current lease not taken to the north of the 
current mineralization. No exploration has been completed into this lease but it known that main 
strike of the mineralization enters into the southwest corner of the lease.

With the exception of the points raised above, no known other significant factors or risks which could 
have a material impact on the ability to affect access, titles or the right to perform exploration work on 
the property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
The Property is easily accessible year round as it is situated approximately 74 km southeast of Lincoln 
(State Capital), Nebraska and approximately 110 km south of Omaha, Nebraska. Access to site can be 
completed via road or from one of the regional airports. There are several regular flights to both 
Lincoln and Omaha; however, the Project is most easily accessible from Lincoln (Figure 5.1.1).

From Lincoln Municipal Airport, the Property is accessed via paved roads on the main and a 
secondary network of gravel roads by following: 

• Interstate Highway 80 south for approximately 3.5 km to the Beatrice exit; 
• Then join Highway 77 south for approximately 40.5 km; 
• Then join Highway 41 south for approximately 46.6 km; and, 
• Then join Highway 50 south for approximately 16.1 km (approximately 10.0 miles) to the 

approximate center of the Elk Creek deposit. 

The drive from the Lincoln Municipal Airport to the property is typically 1 hour and 15 minutes, and 
from Omaha's Eppley Airport the drive is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. 

5.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
Southeast Nebraska is situated in a Humid Continental Climate (Dfa) on the Köppen climate 
classification system. In eastern Nebraska this climate is generally characterized by hot humid 
summers and cold winters. Average winter temperatures vary between -10.4°C to 1.6°C. Average 
summer temperatures vary between 18°C to 32°C. Exploration may be conducted all year round. 

Average monthly precipitation (rain and snowfall) varies between 22 and 127 mm. Average yearly 
precipitation is between 800 and 850 mm with an average yearly snowfall of approximately 72 cm 
(Table 5.2.1). Nebraska is located within an area known for tornados which runs through central USA, 
where thunderstorms are common in the spring and summer months. Tornadoes primarily occur 
during the spring and summer and may occur into the autumn months.

5.3 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
The Company has negotiated surface rights as needed as part of the Exploration Lease Agreements 
(discussed in Section 4.3). It is expected that with appropriate studies and negotiations with land 
owners that land access and provision of land for infrastructure development will be achievable. 
There is sufficient suitable land area available within the mineral claims for mine waste disposal, for 
future tailings disposal, a processing plant, and related mine infrastructure.  

5.4 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 
Elk Creek is the nearest town to the Project, with a population of approximately 100 people. 
Tecumseh, with roughly 1,700 inhabitants, is the nearest town of any size to the Project site and is 
situated approximately 11 km north of the Property. Tecumseh is well-suited as a staging base for 
future exploration work at the Project with available accommodations, fuel, and supplies. 
Contractors, bulk supplies, and skilled labor (engineering, surveying) may be sourced locally or from 
the cities of Lincoln or Omaha. Mining activities currently taking place in the area are limited to 
limestone and aggregate operations, to support the local cement manufacturing and construction 
industries. The Company has links to the University of Nebraska Lincoln which operate a geology 
department. 

The Project is situated in a rural agricultural area that is covered by a well-developed network of 
paved highways and secondary gravel roads. 

There are three electrical power generating stations within a 50 km radius of the Project that include 
the Beatrice and Sheldon coal generating stations and the Cooper nuclear power generating station. 

The nearest railway heads are found in both Tecumseh and Elk Creek. The Burlington Northern 
Santa Fe (BNSF) railway runs parallel to the Nemaha River connecting Kansas City to Omaha and 
Lincoln. The railway is owned by BNSF Railway, a major rail transportation company. 

The nearest major airports are located in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City in Kansas. 

Water sources are available on the Property from local rivers for drilling requirements. 

5.4.1 Potential Tailings Storage Areas 
A tailings storage facility (TSF) area required to support milling will need to be defined within the 
current mineral leases held by NioCorp. A number of potential sites exist but further metallurgical 
testwork will be required to define the size of the facility. Metallurgical testwork is anticipated to be 
completed during the next phase of exploration.  

5.4.2 Potential Waste Disposal Areas 
A waste dump facility may be required to support mining and will need to be defined within the 
current mineral leases held by NioCorp. Given that the current mining method has yet to be defined 
the size of any such facility is as yet unknown. SRK anticipate the mining method for the Project will 
be via underground methods with waste potentially used as a source of backfill. Further work will be 
required to confirm this assumption, which is anticipated to be completed during the next phase of 
exploration.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 19 
 
 
5.4.3 Potential Processing Plant Sites 

The Company holds sufficient surface rights to locate processing facilities at or near access to 
mineralization. The current lease agreements due to expire in 2015 will need to be extended beyond 
this time period. 

5.5 Physiography 
The local topography of eastern Nebraska is relatively low-relief with shallow rolling hills intersected 
by shallow river valleys. Elevation varies from about 325 to 390 m asl. Bedrock outcrop exposure is 
nonexistent in the Project area. 

The majority of the Project area is used for cultivation of corn and soybeans, along with uses as 
grazing land. Native vegetation typical of eastern Nebraska is upland tall-grass, prairie and upland 
deciduous forests.

6 History 
The following section provides a brief summary of the history of the Project and SRK has relied upon 
information provided in the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report produced by Tetra Tech for 
Quantum, entitled "Resource Estimate and Technical Report for the Elk Creek Nb-REE Project, 
Nebraska, USA", effective date April 23, 2012. 

6.1 Ownership History 
Initial regional geological work was completed by the USGS. The details of the initial ownership of 
the complete Project area are not clear, but it is reported that different concession were initially 
owned by Cominco American Inc. (Cominco American) and Molycorp during the early 1970's.  

The majority of exploration over the Project area was completed by Molycorp prior to 1984. Between 
1984 and 2010 at an unknown date the title of the Project was held by ECRC. On May 4, 2010 
Quantum announced the acquisition of the ECRC and held the mineral rights to the Project. On 
March 3, 2013 Quantum announced an official name change from Quantum Rare Earth 
Developments Corp. to NioCorp Developments Ltd (NioCorp) effective March 4, 2013. NioCorp's 
focus is to develop the Elk Creek Niobium deposit. 

6.2 Exploration History 

6.2.1 USGS, 1964 
Between November 1963 and January 1964, the USGS flew three airborne magnetic surveys over 
southeast Nebraska. A total of 6,590 line km were flown (836, 209, and 5,544 line miles respectively) 
along east-west direction at a flight line spacing of two miles and at altitude of 305 m (1,000 ft) above 
ground (USGS website: OFR 99-0557). Figure 6.2.1.1 shows the area covered by the airborne 
survey.

The wide spacing of the flight lines illustrate only regional features and do not locate local anomalies 
(e.g. Elk Creek Nb-REE anomaly). Details of the aeromagnetic survey may be found in USGS 
Publication 73-297, which was unavailable at the time of writing. Results of the aeromagnetic survey 
are shown in Figure 6.2.1.2 below.

6.2.2 Discovery, 1970-1971 
Further investigation of the Project was not completed until 1970, when the Elk Creek gravity 
anomaly was initially identified during a reconnaissance gravity geophysical survey of southeast 
Nebraska by the Conservation and Survey Division (CSD) of the University of Nebraska- Lincoln 
(UNL). During the same time period the UNL geology department (operating independently), was 
mapping the magnetic expression of the Nemaha Arch and the Humboldt Fault.

A comparison of the two geophysical survey results showed a positive anomaly that was coincident 
with a positive gravity anomaly over the area now defined as the Elk Creek gravity anomaly 
(Anzman, 1976). The geophysical gravity survey outlined a near-circular anomaly, along with a 
concurrent magnetic anomaly, approximately 7 km in diameter. Analysis of the geophysical data 
provided a model of a cylindrical mass of indefinite length with a radius of 1,700 m (5,500 ft; Burfeind 
et al. 1971). Figure 6.2.2.1 and Figure 6.2.2.2 below illustrate the results of the two surveys. 

In 1971, the Nebraska Geological Survey (NGS) commissioned a test drillhole 2-B-71 to determine 
the source of the near circular gravity anomaly. With some support from the United States Bureau of 
Mines (USBM) the test hole was deepened. The test hole 2-B-71, later renamed NN-1 by Molycorp, 
encountered 191 m (628 ft) of marine sediments, followed by a carbonate-rich rock (carbonatite) to 
the end of the hole at 290 m (952 ft) (Brookins et al. 1975) in what is now referred to as the Elk 
Creek Carbonatite.

6.2.3 Cominco American, 1974 
The earliest known reference to Cominco American operating within the Elk Creek gravity anomaly 
area is from 1974. It is unclear at precisely when Cominco American first acquired the mineral rights 
in the Elk Creek anomaly area. It is believed between 1971 and 1973 both Cominco American and 
Molycorp held mineral rights over selected portions of the Elk Creek gravity anomaly. 

In 1974, Cominco American completed five drillholes (CA-1 to CA-5) within the Elk Creek gravity 
anomaly. Details of the Cominco American drillholes and exploration activities within the property 
were not available. The information on drilling activities stated here was taken from the Molycorp 
database. SRK has not reviewed or included any information from Cominco American as part of the 
current study. 

6.2.4 Molycorp, 1973-1986 
The earliest known reference to Molycorp operating within the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area is 
from 1973. It is unclear at precisely when Molycorp first acquired the mineral rights in the Elk Creek 
anomaly area. Molycorp completed a number of phases of exploration on the Project during this 
period including more detailed geophysical surveys, regional drilling (mineralization limits) and 
focused drilling on the Project area. The exploration program focused on understanding the potential 
for rare earth elements of economic significance at the Project, with results showing a Niobium 
anomaly at Elk Creek.  

Between 1986 and 2011, no further exploration had been recorded on the Property.

6.2.5 Geophysical Surveys 

In 1973, a detailed aeromagnetic survey was flown by Olympus Aerial Surveys Inc (Olympic Aerial 
Surveys), of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, for Molycorp, with the aim of locating drill sites. Flight lines 
within the Elk Creek anomaly area were spaced at 200 m (1/8 mile), outside the anomaly at 400 m 
(1/4 mile). A total of 50,764 ha (196 square miles) were covered by 2,090 line km (Anzman, 1976). 
The altitude of the survey was not stated in Anzman 1976. 

In 1980, an extensive regional geophysical program was made in southeastern Nebraska including 
the Elk Creek anomaly. The program consisted of 6,437 line km of aeromagnetics and approximately 
4,000 gravity station readings. The aeromagnetic survey was contracted by Olympus Aerial Surveys. 

The gravity geophysical survey was conducted by the CSD-UNL, which undertook approximately a 
quarter of the station readings, and by Molycorp's in-house Geophysical Services Group, which 
undertook the remaining three quarters of the gravity station readings. 

6.2.6 Drilling 
Between, 1973 and 1974, Molycorp completed six drillholes: EC-1 to EC-4, targeting the Elk Creek 
anomaly and two other holes outside the Elk Creek anomaly area (Anzman, 1976). Drillholes were 
typically carried out by RC drilling through the overlying sedimentary rocks and diamond drilling 
through the Ordovician-Cambrian basement rocks. 

Molycorp continued their drill program from 1977 and, in May 1978, Molycorp made its discovery of 
the Elk Creek Nb-REE deposit with drillhole EC-11. EC-11 is located on Section 33, Township 4N, 
and Range 11. The Carbonatite hosting the Elk Creek Nb-REE deposit was intersected at a vertical 
depth of 203.61 m (668 ft). 

Molycorp continued its drilling program through to 1984 that mainly centered on the Elk Creek Nb-
REE deposit within a radius of roughly 2 km. By 1984, Molycorp had completed 57 drillholes within 
the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area, which included 25 drillholes over the Elk Creek Nb-REE deposit. 

From 1984 to 1986, drilling was focused on the Elk Creek gravity anomaly area. The anomaly area is 
roughly 7 km in diameter and drilling was conducted on a grid pattern of approximately 610 by 610 m 
(roughly 2,000 by 2,000 ft.) with some closer spaced drillholes in selected areas. 

By 1986, a total of 106 drillholes were completed for a total of approximately 46,797 m (153,532 ft). 
The deepest hole reached a depth of 1,038 m (3,406 ft) and bottomed in carbonatite.  

6.2.7 Molycorp Data Verification, 1973-1986 
Verification work on the historical database has been completed by Dahrouge Geological Consulting 
Ltd (Dahrouge), who were contracted by Quantum to compile and verify the historical database 
between 2010 and 2011. Work included data capture from historical drilling logs, verification drilling 
and reanalysis of historical samples.  

The following extract was taken from McCallum and Cathro (2010). 

"In some of the analytical log sheets available to the Authors, it appears that Molycorp analyzed 
niobium through their exploration division laboratory at Louviers, Colorado. They also analyzed the 
same interval at another, unspecified, commercial laboratory. It is unclear to the Authors what 
material the duplicate analyses were derived from (coarse reject duplicate, pulp duplicate, or ¼ core

duplicate). As discussed in Section 15, Molycorp Inc. utilized some standards to establish the 
calibration curve of the x-ray refraction (XRF) instruments. It is unclear if Molycorp also utilized 
inserted standard reference samples to test the analytical accuracy of their own laboratory or 
external commercial laboratories. 

Molycorp utilized the commercial laboratory, Skyline Labs Inc., of Wheat Ridge, Colorado between 
1980 and 1986, with analysis by ICP spectrographic methods and unknown preparation methods. 
According to analytical reports and certificates available at UNL, values of lanthanum, cerium, 
neodymium, barium, sodium, thorium, lead, thorium, uranium, potassium, titanium, zinc, vanadium, 
niobium, phosphorous, beryllium, zircon, strontium, lithium, yttrium, silver, chromium, copper, iron, 
manganese, nickel and cobalt were tested. The intervals tested are comprised of commonly 100 ft 
intervals, presumably composited from the pulverized material of the 10 ft intervals. 

In the "Niobium Analytical Standardization" report, dated June 1983, by Sisneros and Yernberg, it 
was noted that the routine XRF analysis performed by Molycorp's exploration division laboratory at 
Louviers generated niobium values that were higher than other analytical techniques. This difference 
in niobium values was concluded not to be a product of preparation techniques, but a result of the 
standardization errors in the XRF analytical technique. A set of fifteen composites was prepared from 
Elk Creek drill-core samples and analyzed with varying methods including XRF, ICP emission 
spectrometry and DC plasma emission spectrometry at ten laboratories. It was concluded that the 
difference was caused by high barium and iron within the matrix of the sample, with the largest 
deviations found in the coarse-grained material. The deviation of Molycorp's routine analytical 
method compared to the recommended value ranges from 20% to just below 50% (with the 
exception of one sample deviating 1%). The recommended value was based on a statistical analysis 
of the round-robin results. 

The correction for the effect of barium and iron on the given Louviers niobium value was calibrated 
with the XRF instrument at Molycorp's Louviers, Colorado exploration laboratory, and many of the 
previously analyzed samples were re-tested with the new calibration. The samples that have 
received the Ba+Fe correction have been noted on the historic Molycorp analytical logs; however in 
the later series of holes, it is not identified on the assay log. It is expected that all holes drilled after 
1983 were analyzed with the newer calibration. 

Subsequent to the 1983 "Niobium Analytical Standardization" report, Molycorp had 100 ft composite 
intervals of the majority of the drillholes (EC-1 to EC-105) sent to Metric Labs of Ste-Marthe-Sur-Le-
Lac, Quebec for check analysis of niobium." 

6.3 Historic Resource Estimates 

6.3.1 Molycorp Internal Estimates 
During the review of historical documentation and the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report, it has 
been noted that Molycorp produced an internal estimate of the tonnage and grade within the Elk 
Creek deposit. This estimate is not considered to be compliant with CIM terms and conditions, or has 
been documented to an NI 43-101 standard. The estimate is based on assay analysis conducted by 
Molycorp at its own laboratory at Louviers, Colorado, USA and other analytical work at several 
commercial laboratories.

On February 5, 1986, in an internal Molycorp memo (Cook and Shearer, 1986), from the two 
principle project geologists, Cook and Shearer, states: 

"Niobium Resource Lands (Elk Creek Section 33) 

These lands include the Section 33 niobium resource and adjacent untested lands. The 
resource contains 39.4 million tons of 0.82% Nb2O5 and is open to the north, west and at 
depth." 

Tetra Tech commented in the previous NI 43-101 (April 2012) that the memo is the only evidence of 
an historic resource conducted on the Property. There are no documents available to explain or 
support how this resource was estimated. Tetra Tech concluded during it's investigation that it was 
apparent that the historic resource may have been estimated by a polygonal method. 

6.3.2 Tetra Tech Wardrop Estimate (April 2012) 
In April 2012, Tetra Tech produced an NI 43-101 Technical Report for the Project based on the 
results of verification work completed by Quantum through Dahrouge. The Tetra Tech Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Project was prepared in accordance with CIM Best Practices and 
disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, with an effective date of March 21, 2012. 

The Mineral Resource was estimated by the OK interpolation method on capped grade values. The 
Mineral Resource for the Elk Creek deposit was classified as having Indicated and Inferred 
Resources based on drillhole spacing, drillhole location and sample data population.  

The Mineral Resource estimate for the deposit, at 0.4 Nb2O5% CoG, is an Indicated Resource of 
19.3 Mt at 0.67 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 83.3 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O55%. 

Table 6.3.2.1 and Table 6.3.2.2 present the Indicated and Inferred Resource estimates for the Elk 
Creek deposit at various Nb2O5% cut-offs between 0.35 and 0.70 Nb2O5%. 

Tetra Tech concluded that the Elk Creek deposit warrants further investigation and development.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
7.1 Regional Geology 

The Nebraska Precambrian basement predominantly comprises granite, diorite, basalt, anorthosite, 
gneiss, schist and clastic sediments. A series of island arcs sutured onto the Archean continent 
created the basic framework of the area. This suture left a north-trending intervening boundary zone 
ancestral to the Nemaha Uplift, providing a pre-existing tectonic framework which controlled the 
trend of the later Midcontinent Rift System (1.0 to 1.2 Ga) (Carlson & Treves, 2005). The Carbonatite 
is located at the northeast extremity of the Nemaha Uplift. 

The Midcontinent Rift System, or Keweenawan Rift, comprises mafic igneous rocks and forms a belt 
over 2,000 km long and 55 km wide that is exposed at surface in the Lake Superior Region and 
extends southwards through the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and into 
Kansas (Carlson, 1992). Both basalt and associated red clastic sedimentary rocks are found in the 
Precambrian basement of southeastern Nebraska. These rocks are very similar to those found in the 
Lake Superior region and are thus considered to be a product of the Keweenawan rifting (Burchett 
and Reed, 1967; Treves et al., 1983). Figure 7.1.1 illustrates the major rock types of the 
Midcontinental Rift system. 

The Nemaha Uplift (300 Ma) extends southward as a narrow belt from southeastern Nebraska 
across Kansas along the midcontinent rift system (King, 1969) (Figure 7.1.1). Along the northern and 
eastern margins are complex fault zones and steeply dipping units. Regional north-northeast to 
northeast striking faults are locally transected by northwest trending ones, including the Central 
Plains megashear (Central Missouri Fault) to the north and the Oklahoma megashear to the south 
(McBee, 2003). The Carbonatite body intruded near to the axis of the Nemaha uplift and has similar 
dates to a cluster of carbonatites north of Lake Superior that are in the range of 560 to 580 Ma. 
(Woolley, 1989; Erdosh, 1979). Temporally the Carbonatite occurs near the boundary between the 
Penokean Orogen (approxiamtely 1,840 Ma) and the Dawes terrane (1,780 Ma) of the Central Plains 
Orogen (Carlson and Treves, 2005). 

Figure 7.1.2 shows a merged airborne magnetic anomaly map of Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma 
states (USGS, 2004) showing the Midcontinent Rift and Nemaha Uplift systems.

Regional geophysical data and drilling have confirmed the presence of kimberlitic intrusive bodies in 
northern Kansas to the southwest of the Carbonatite. These kimberlites were emplaced along the rift 
system during Cretaceous time (Berendsen and Weis, 2001). 

The Palaeozoic rocks overlying the Carbonatite region are dominated by approximately 200 m of 
essentially flat-lying Pennsylvanian marine strata consisting of carbonates, sandstones and shales. 
The eastern portion of Nebraska was glaciated several times throughout the early Pleistocene 
(Wayne, 1981), resulting in the deposition of approximately 50 m of unconsolidated till. 

7.2 Property Geology 
The property includes the Carbonatite that has intruded older Precambrian granitic and low- to 
medium-grade metamorphic basement rocks. The Carbonatite and Precambrian rocks are believed 
to be unconformably overlain by approximately 200 m of Palaeozoic marine sedimentary rocks of 
Pennsylvanian age (ca. 299 to 318 Ma).

As a result of this thick cover, there is no surface outcrop within the Project area of the Carbonatite, 
which was identified and targeted through magnetic surveys and confirmed through subsequent 
drilling. The available magnetic data indicates dominant northeast, west-northwest striking 
lineaments and secondary northwest and north oriented features that mimic the position of regional 
faults parallel and/or perpendicular to the Nemaha Uplift.  

7.3 Elk Creek Carbonatite 
The Elk Creek Carbonatite is an elliptical magmatic body with northwest trending long axis 
perpendicular to the strike of the 1.1-Ga Midcontinent Rift System, near the northern part of the 
Nemaha uplift (Burchett, 1982; Carlson, 1997). It was first discovered by drilling in 1971 and 
tentatively identified as a carbonatite on the basis that it resembled rocks of the Fen District of 
Norway (Treves et al., 1972a and 1972b). The definitive confirmation of carbonatite was completed 
using Rare Earth Element (REE), P205 and 

87Sr/86Sr isotope analysis (Brookins et al., 1975). The 
Carbonatite has also been compared to the Iron Hill carbonatite stock in Gunnison County, Colorado 
on the basis of similar mineralogy (Xu, 1996). 

The Carbonatite consists predominantly of dolomite, calcite and ankerite, with lesser chlorite, barite, 
phlogopite, pyrochlore, serpentine, fluorite, sulfides and quartz (Xu, 1996).  

Current studies suggest that the Carbonatite was emplaced ca. 500 Ma (Xu, 1996) in response to 
stress along the Nemaha Uplift boundary predating deposition of the Pennsylvanian sedimentary 
sequence (ca. 299 to 318 Ma). However, observations on drill cores from the Project site show that 
the contact between the Carbonatite body and the Pennsylvanian sediments is a sheared but 
oxidized contact suggesting that the Carbonatite is intrusive in the Pennsylvanian sequence (Figure 
7.3.1 and Figure 7.3.2). Furthermore, both rock types appear to have been affected by at least one 
main brittle-ductile deformation event resulting in formation of fault structures. Microstructures 
including sub-vertical and sub-horizontal tension veins, together with related sheared veins and fault 
planes displaying sub-vetical and sub-horizontal slickenlines along drill cores are indications for the 
presence of extensional and oblique to strike-slip faults (Figure 7.3.1 and Figure 7.3.2). These faults 
could correspond to the magnetic lineaments present in the area. Investigations aiming to define the 
location, as well as the orientation and kinematics of these structures are in progress. 

Microstructures presented in Figure 7.3.1 suggest the presence of extensional and strike-slip to 
oblique faults in the area as follows: A) Spaced foliation and breccia in the contact zone between the 
Carbonatite and the Pennsylvanian sequence; Subvertical (B) and subhorizontal (C) tension veins 
and associated sheared veins in the carbonatite; Fault planes showing subvertical (D) and oblique 
(E) slickensides in the carbonatite. Note that observations were made on cores from subvertical 
holes (about 70 degrees plunge).

7.3.1 Age Dating 
An original hypothesis suggested that the Elk Creek Carbonatite was of Keweenawan age (Treves et 
al., 1983) or ca. 1,100 Ma. However, in 1985, Paterman, of the USGS Isotope Laboratory, provided a 
K-Ar age of 544 (±7) Ma (Cambrian) from biotite within the Carbonatite. Two more K-Ar dates were 
provided by Georgia State University (M. Ghazi (date unknown)) which also provided dates from 
biotite samples. The ages of 464 (±5) Ma and 484 (±5) Ma, respectively, are Ordovician and thus 
much younger than the Midcontinent Rift System. Whilst these radiometric dates provide a 
generalized time range for the Carbonatite intrusion, additional age dating is needed to establish a 
more precise date.

7.4 Carbonatite Lithological Units 
The lithological units present in the carbonatite complex were defined by Molycorp during their drill 
programs and simplified by Dahrouge for interpretation purposes during each stage of the project 
(2011 and 2014). The following units in Table 7.4.1 (youngest at the top) represent the data captured 
during the original data capture in 2011. The information was compiled from the drill logs and the 
corresponding geology reports for each drillhole

A study of six Molycorp drillholes by Xu (1996) identified two main phases within the area, a 
carbonate phase and a silicate phase. The study was based on drillholes 2-B-71 (also known as "NN-
1"), EC-40, EC-42, EC-50, EC-70 and EC- 82. 

The carbonate phase was classified into two main units (defined by texture, massive or brecciated) 
and several sub-units (defined by mineralogy as presented below). 

Massive Carbonatite 

• Dolomite carbonatite; 
• Apatite-bearing dolomite carbonatite and pyrochlore-bearing carbonatite; 
• Apatite-dolomite carbonatite; 
• Hematite-dolomite carbonatite; and 
• Magnetite-dolomite carbonatite. 

Brecciated Carbonatite 

The silicate phase was also classified into several units as follows: 

• Altered basalt; 
• Altered lamprophyre; and 
• Altered syenite.

In the 2014 drilling, the Dahrouge geologists have split the dolCarb units down into a number of key 
units using the information of the different phases of carbonatite. The main Carbonatite lithologies 
used are: 

• Dolomite Carbonatite – dolCarb; 
• Dolomite Carbonatite Breccia – dolCarbBc; 
• Hematite-dolomite Carbonatite – hemdolCarb; 
• Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite – mdolCarb; and 
• Magnetite-dolomite Carbonatite Breccia – mdolCarbBc. 

SRK considers the more detailed split of the Carbonatite units to be relevant to determining the 
distribution of different grade populations as supported by Statistics (discussed in Section 14.3). 

7.5 Marine Sedimentary Rocks 
The State of Nebraska-wide test hole database contains information for about 5,500 test holes drilled 
since 1930 by the CSD, School of Natural Resources (SNR), UNL (UNL-CSD/SNR), and cooperating 
agencies. Test hole location data, as well as lithological descriptions, stratigraphic interpretations 
and geophysical log records are included in the database. In addition, UNL-CSD/SNR maintains an 
extensive collection of geologic samples obtained from the drilling process (UNL-CSD/SNR website).  

The overlying sedimentary units on the Project are of Pennsylvanian age. The CSD's 1971 test hole 
2-B-71, also labelled NN-1 by Molycorp, intersected several formations of overlying Pennsylvanian 
strata (Table 7.5.1).

7.6 Mineralization 
The property hosts niobium, REE and barium mineralization that occurs within the Elk Creek 
Carbonatite. For the purposes of this report, only niobium and REE mineralization are discussed 
below. 

In the Molycorp database, nearly every drillhole contains a separate geological report summarizing 
rock types, assay results and associated petrographic descriptions identifying niobium and/or REE 
minerals. Niobium is reported to be hosted in pyrochlore and REE mineralization is reported to occur 
as bästnasite, parisite, synchysite and monazite. SRK highlights that the level of detail shown in the 
geological reports has not been transferred to the electronic database in completeness. 

7.6.1 Niobium Mineralization 
The deposit contains significant concentrations of niobium. According to Molycorp records available 
at the UNL, the niobium is mainly contained within the mineral pyrochlore as determined by Energy 
Dispersive Analysis (EDX). 

McCallum and Cathro (2010) examined drillhole EC-30 at intervals where the niobium mineralization 
was considered representative of the core zone of the deposit. An excerpt from the accompanying 
Molycorp geology report states: 

JAO/MLM ElkCreek_NI43-101_TRR_241900.030_013_MLM.docx November 3, 2014 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 37 
 
 

"Fragments of magnetite beforsite with micrometer size pyrochlore account for intercepts of ore-grade 
(≥0.60% Nb2O5) niobium mineralization. The highest grade intercept at 317 to 320 m contains 1.68% 
Nb2O5 and the highest grade interval from 317 to 323 m contains 1.13% Nb2O5. Larger fragments of 
magnetite beforsite occur in beforsite breccia at 516 to 524.4, 566.6 to 571.2, and 668.4 to 686.4 m. 
Pyrochlore occurs in magnetite beforsite fragments as micrometer-size grains disseminated in 
phlogopite or dolomite. There are interesting occurrences of coarser pyrochlore grains in magnetite 
beforsite at 264.5 and 679.1 m. These grains are ≤0.15 mm in diameter and they may occur with 
coarser-grained phlogopite…" 

7.6.2 Rare Earth Element Mineralization 
Within the Elk Creek Carbonatite complex there are several occurrences of REE mineralization, 
including the Project. REE mineralization within the Carbonatite occurs within the following minerals: 

• Bästnasite ([Ce,La,Y]CO3F); 
• Parisite (Ca[Ce,La]2[CO3]3F2); 
• Synchysite (Ca(Ce,La)[F|CO3]2); and 
• Monazite ([Ce,La]PO4). 

A review of historic documents for drillhole EC-93, and part of Quantum's re-sampling program due to 
the high grade REE mineralization as noted in the Molycorp drill logs includes an excerpt as follows:. 

"Barite beforsite I is the predominant lithology from 149.4 to 304.8 m. It contains xenoliths of syenite, 
older mafic rocks, and apatite beforsite I, and is intruded by younger mafic rocks. Intervals 33 m 
(100 ft) long contain 2.13% to 2.75% LnO from 149.4 to 274.3 ft. An interval 18.3 m long at 179.8 to 
198.1 ft contains 3.89% LnO. The highest grade mineralization intercepted was 3.0 m at 4.72% LnO 
at 155.4 to 158.5 m. Lanthanide minerals occur as radial patches and random aggregates of 
needles, irregular patches and vein-like aggregates. The aggregates occur with and without quartz. 
The aggregates appear as light-gray patches in reddish-brown, hematite-altered beforsite. Although 
individual lanthanide mineral grains are in the micrometer size range, aggregates of lanthanide 
minerals range from 0.23 to 8.0 mm. in maximum dimension. Monazite and bästnasite have been 
identified in the aggregates, and EDX spectra show Ce > La." 

It should be noted that Molycorp's term LnO, or rare-earth oxides (REO) and incorporate lanthanum, 
cerium and neodymium. 

Present day nomenclature for REE is shown in Table 7.6.2.1 below.

8 Deposit Type  
The Elk Creek Nb-REE deposit is hosted within the Elk Creek Carbonatite. By definition a 
carbonatite is an igneous rock body with greater than 50% modal carbonate minerals, mainly in the 
form of calcite, dolomite, ankerite, or sodium- and potassium-bearing carbonates. Carbonatites 
commonly occur as intrusive bodies, such as isolated sills, dikes, or plugs, although rarely occur as 
extrusive rocks. Many carbonatites are associated with alkali silicate rocks (for example, syenite, 
nepheline syenite, ijolite, urtite, pyroxenite, etc.). Carbonatites are usually surrounded by an aureole 
of metasomatically altered rocks called fenites. Carbonatite-associated deposits can be classified as 
magmatic or metasomatic types (Richardson and Birkett, 1996). 

Carbonatites have been classified based on chemical classification into four classes (Woolley and 
Kempe, 1989; Wyllie and Lee, 1998), and further subdivided based on mineralogical and textural 
characteristics: 

• Calcio-carbonatite coarse-grained: sövite, and finer-grained: alvikite; 
• Magnesio-carbonatite dolomite-rich: beforsite, and ankerite-rich: rauhaugite; 
• Ferro-carbonatite (iron rich carbonates); and 
• Natro-carbonatite (sodium-potassium-calcium carbonates). 

The use of a chemical classification of carbonatites should be used with caution when replacement, 
or metasomatic, processes have altered the primary composition of the carbonatite rock (Mitchell, 
2005). 

The majority of carbonatite deposits are located within stable, intra-plate crustal units, although some 
are linked with orogenic activity, or plate separation. It is also important to note that carbonatites tend 
to occur in clusters, and in many places there has been repetition of activity over time (Woolley, 
1989). 

Worldwide, carbonatite deposits are mined for niobium, REE, iron, copper, phosphate (apatite), 
vermiculite and fluorite; with barite, zircon/baddeleyite, tantalum and uranium as common by-products 
(Richardson and Birkett, 1996).

9 Exploration 
The Carbonatite is covered by approximately 190 – 200 m of Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks. No 
surface exploration has been completed with the 2014 exploration program focusing on infill drilling 
of the existing Mineral Resource using diamond drilling methods. The following section provides a 
summary of the 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report for the exploration work completed by the 
Company since acquiring the Project in 2010.  

9.1 Quantum, 2010-2011 

9.1.1 Data Compilation, 2010-2011 
During 2010, the Company contracted Dahrouge to undertake a compilation of all Molycorp hard 
copy data and digitize all paper files, including drill logs and accompanying drill core geological 
reports, internal memos and other historic reports. 

The historic drill core logs feature almost all the 106 Molycorp drillholes, one CSD test hole, and four 
(out of five) Cominco American drillholes. Eight historic Molycorp drill logs were not available in the 
historic database. 

The information gathered by Dahrouge has been compiled into a Central Database ("Elk Creek 
Database") using CAE Mining Fusion software. 

9.1.2 Quantum Re-sampling Program, 2010 
Commencing in November 2010, the Company contracted Dahrouge to undertake a re-sampling of 
the historic drill core pulps as part of a QA/QC program to ascertain the reliability of the historic drill 
core assay results and to obtain more detailed analysis of the REE content of the samples. The 
samples were re-analyzed separately by XRF. The Nb2O5 assay results were validated and 
incorporated into the Elk Creek database. 

SRK has reviewed the results of the program and confirms that it has followed current industry 
standards in the preparation and correlation of the database.  

9.2 Quantum, 2011-2012 

9.2.1 Airborne Gravity and Magnetic Geophysical Survey, 2011 
In the April 2011, Quantum commissioned Fugro of Ottawa, ON, to conduct a high-resolution 
FALCONTM airborne gravity gradiometer (gD) and total magnetic intensity (TMI) geophysical 
surveys. The results of the gravity and magnetic geophysical surveys are shown in Figure 9.2.1.1 
and Figure 9.2.1.2 below.

The survey area was centered on the Elk Creek deposit and covered a total area of approximately 
110 km2 (approximately 10 by 11 km) around the deposit. A total of 1,176 line km were flown. Flight 
lines were oriented 000/180° azimuth on a nominal line spacing of 100 m. Five tie lines were flown, 
oriented at 090°/270° azimuth, spaced 2,750 m apart. All flight lines were flown at a nominal 
clearance of 100 m (Fugro, 2011). 

9.3 Significant Results and Interpretation 
It has been noted that the 2011-2012 geophysical surveys closely match the results of the CSD and 
UNL geophysical surveys in the early 1970's confirming the original gravity anomaly.

Subsequently, in October 2011, Colorado-based Condor Consulting Inc. (Condor) was retained by 
the Company to process and analyze the FALCONTM gravity and magnetic geophysical survey 
data. Condor noted coincident gravity and magnetic anomalies traversing 1,200 m to the east from 
the known Elk Creek deposit. Several anomalies of higher relative density and magnetization have 
also been identified outside of the drilled prospect area (Condor, 2011).

10 Drilling 
10.1 Type and Extent 

Drilling at the Project was conducted in three phases. The first was during the 1970's and 1980's by 
Molycorp, the second in 2011 by Quantum, and the third and latest program in 2014 by NioCorp. To 
date, 116 diamond core holes have been completed for a total of 55,228 m (Figure 10.1.1). All 
drilling has been completed using a combination of Tricone, Reverse RC or DDH drilling in the upper 
portion of the hole within the Pennsylvanian sediments. All drilling within the Carbonatite has been 
completed using diamond coring methods.  

To date, local labor has been used by drilling contractors when preparing the drillhole platforms. All 
drilling has been completed using standardized procedures which are in line with international 
standards of best practice. The drilling completed by Molycorp was completed by Molycorp using 
company owned equipment and sampling procedures. The drilling companies used for the Company 
during the 2011 and 2014 Phase 1 drilling programs are detailed below: 

• 2011: Black Rock Drilling, LLC (BRD Personnel and Leasing Corp.), 17525 E Euclid Ave, 
Spokane Valley, WA 99216; and 

• 2012: West-Core Drilling, LLC (561 W Main Elko, NV 89801 USA). 

The drilling has been completed using conventional techniques, using experienced drilling 
contractors. Drilling has continued onsite since the effective date of this report with additional drilling 
contractors for metallurgical testwork requirements undertaking, and RC drilling within the 
Pennsylvanian sediments, to increase the efficiency in drilling through the cover material, within 
areas of strong geological confidence. These holes have been completed by Envirotech Drilling LLC, 
900 East 4th Street, Winnemucca, Nevada 89445 USA, and IDEA Drilling LLC, 1997 9th Avenue N 
Virginia, Minnesota 55792 USA, respectively. 

The following sections provide a brief summary of the drilling completed by Molycorp, Quantum and 
NioCorp (as shown in Table 10.1.1).

10.1.1 Molycorp, 1973-1986 
Between 1973 and 1986, Molycorp completed a regional scale drill program over approximately 7 by 
7 km gravity anomaly that includes the Elk Creek Nb deposit. The total program consisted of 106 
drillholes for a total of approximately 46,797 m. Outside the Elk Creek Nb deposit area, the regional 
drill program was conducted on a regular grid of 610 by 610 m (2,000 by 2,000 ft) with some closely 
spaced holes in selected areas within the gravity anomaly. A more detailed description of this 
program may be found in Section 6.2.6 in this report. 

Included in this total, some 25 holes for 14,739.8 m were drilled over the deposit. Drilling orientations 
varied considerably. 

The Molycorp drillhole locations centered over the Elk Creek Niobium anomaly are presented in 
Figure 10.1.1 (shown in blue). 

10.1.2 Quantum, 2011 
In April 2011, Quantum conducted a preliminary drill program (three holes) on the Elk Creek Nb 
deposit and two REE exploration targets (two holes), which have been excluded from the current 
Mineral Resource estimation, as they do not intersection the Nb2O5 anomaly and are located to the 
east. The objectives of the drill program over Project were to verify the presence of higher grade

niobium mineralization at depth, and to infill drill the known niobium deposit in order to upgrade the 
resource category of the previous resource estimate and expand the known resource. The drill 
program was also established to collect sufficient sample material for metallurgical characterization 
and process development studies of the niobium mineralization. 

The 2011 program consisted of five inclined drillholes, totaling 3,420 m of NQ size diameter core, 
was completed. Inclusive of this total, three drillholes, totaling 2,318 m were drilled into the known 
Elk Creek deposit. The summary of the 2011 drill program is listed in Table 10.1.2.1 below.

Hole NEC11-001 targeted the eastern portion of the deposit below historic drillhole EC-11 and 
between vertical holes EC-27 and EC-30. Hole NEC11-002 was drilled into the northwestern portion 
of the deposit. Hole NEC11-003 was drilled into the southeastern portion of the deposit. Drillholes 
NEC11-004 and 005 drilled into regional REE targets are not subject to this report and have be 
excluded from the Mineral Resource estimate. 

The Quantum 2011 drillhole locations centered over the Elk Creek Niobium anomaly are presented 
in Figure 10.1.2. (shown in green). 

Results from the 2011 drilling program provided additional information on areas of the deposit at 
depth where limited information was previously available. The drillholes confirmed the high-grade 
potential of the niobium mineralization, as indicated by previous drilling completed by Molycorp. 

10.1.3 NioCorp 2014 Program 
NioCorp commenced drilling on the Elk Creek deposit using a three phased program with the aim of 
increasing the confidence in the 2012 Mineral Resource estimate from Inferred to Indicated. The 
three phased program is based on 14 drillholes for approximately 12,150 m (announced in a press 
release on April 29 2014). The first phase drill program, totaling five drillholes for approximately 
4,200 m, is the basis for the current Mineral Resource updated. The drilling has been orientated to 
intersect the geological model from the southwest and northeast (perpendicular to the strike). The 
Phase One program targeted the central portion of the project where limited information was 
available within the 2012 geological model.  

The NioCorp 2014 drillhole locations (shown in Table 10.1.3.1) centered over the central portion of 
the deposit are presented in Figure 10.1.2. (shown in red).

10.2 Procedures (NioCorp 2014 Program) 
Detailed descriptions of Molycorp's drilling, sample procedures, analyses and security have not been 
documented and reviewed by SRK. Given Molycorp's position as a leader in the rare earth industry 
at the time, it is likely Molycorp applied Industry best practice for the time period. The 2011 drilling 
campaign was managed by Dahrouge and SRK has assumed the same quality and procedures used 
in the current study were applied during 2011. The 2014 drilling programme includes a quality control

programme to ensure the results can be used to verify earlier drilling results and add confidence to 
the overall understanding of the deposit. 

For the 2014 drilling program planned drillhole collars were initially located using a handheld 
GarminTM Global Positioning System (GPS) and marked with wooden stakes. A tracked excavator 
was used to construct the drill pad and collars were then relocated using the GPS with wooden 
stakes after pad construction. A geological compass was used to sight in the drill to the planned 
azimuth and inclination.  

All 2014 core drilling was conducted by West-Core Drilling, a private contractor, using either an AVD 
R40 track-mounted core drill or an Atlas Copco CS-14 track-mounted core drill. Overburden was 
cased in all drillholes to depths ranging from 26 to 34 m. The Pennsylvanian limestones and 
mudstones overlying the target carbonatite were drilled with PQ-sized core and the carbonatite was 
drilled with HQ-sized core. Core size reduction took place just beneath the Pennsylvanian-
carbonatite contact at depths ranging from 206 to 210 m. The core drilling rigs operated 24 
hours/day and 7 days/week, with typical progress of 40 m/day. 

During the drilling operation, the core is retrieved from the core barrel and laid sequentially into 
wooden core boxes by the drilling contractor. Interval blocks are then placed at all run breaks. Once 
the box is full, the ends and top of the box are labeled with drillhole identification and the sequential 
box number. Upon completing a box, it is stacked on a pallet or on a truck bed at the drill rig. At the 
end of each drilling shift, the boxes of core are transported by the drilling contractor in a pickup truck 
to the NioCorp field office. At this point, the core is in the custody of Dahrouge Geological Consulting 
Ltd. (Dahrouge).Four of the five 2014 drillholes had piezometers installed in them after drilling was 
complete. For these drillholes, surface completion consisted of surface casing capped with a locking 
steel cover, a 1.2 square meter cement pad around the surface casing and a steel name plate 
attached to the casing. Surface completion for the drillhole that did not have a piezometer installed 
consisted of a steel marker post and attached name plate. All name plates include drillhole number, 
total depth and orientation. Abandonment of the drillholes consisted of cementing from total depth to 
surface in the non-piezometer drillhole and from total depth to the bottom of the piezometers in the 
other four drillholes.  

10.2.1 Collar Surveys 
All hole collars were initially surveyed prior to drilling using a handheld GPS. On completion of the 
hole an external contractor ESP INC. (Engineering/Surveying/Planning), based in Lincoln, Nebraska, 
has been used to provide a detailed survey of the collar location using a using a Sokkia GS2700 IS 
GPS, which has 10 mm horizontal and 20 mm vertical accuracy. Data has been provided to SRK in 
digital format in UTM (NADS83 Zone 14) grid coordinates.  

The location of 12 of the 29 Molycorp drill collars (EC-014, EC-016, EC-020, EC-026, EC-028, EC-
029, EC-030, NEC11-001, NEC11-002, NEC11-003, NEC11-004, and NEC11-005 ) located over the 
Elk Creek Nb deposit, were surveyed using the same UTM coordinate system by CES Group P.A. 
Engineers & Surveyors, based in Kansas City, Missouri. 

10.2.2 Downhole Surveys 
Initial collar surveys of dip and azimuth have been taken using compass measurements for all holes 
(RC and DD). Downhole surveying has been undertaken on historical Molycorp holes drilled into

below the Pennsylvanian sediments at an interval of 30.48 m (100 ft).  

The 2011 drilling program has been surveyed at 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals based on the drilling rod 
lengths used at the time. Downhole deviations, subsurface azimuth and dip, were mapped using a 
Reflex GYRO, which utilizes a digital MEMS-gyro non-magnetic assemblage. The Gyro tool is used 
to mitigate magnetic deviation caused by metal equipment, or naturally occurring minerals such as 
magnetite and pyrrhotite which occur in the deposit. These surveys are synchronized electronically 
with a receiver at surface, and recordings are collected every 30 seconds, after the tool has had a 
chance to calibrate. The Reflex GYRO has an integrated APS (Azimuth Pointing System) that is 
used to orientate the True North azimuth, a GPS position and degree of inclination. Downhole 
surveys are completed through the drill rods and location data points are collected every 6.1 (~20 ft). 

In the 2014 drilling program the survey length has been dependent on the length of the diamond drill 
lengths and varies from 6.1 m near surface (20 ft), to 4.57 m (15 ft) at depth. Downhole survey was 
done for all drillholes (RC and DDH) using a digital REFLEX EZ-SHOT camera. Parameters 
measured by the reflex camera include Inclination (in degrees) and Azimuth (in degrees). The 
downhole survey procedure is described below: 

• The azimuth provided by the camera was with reference to Magnetic North. The true 
azimuth is thus obtained by making the necessary corrections using the magnetic declination 
for the area (-4º) at the time of drilling; both Magnetic and True azimuths are recorded. 

• Survey for 0 m of drillholes was taken with a geological compass. If these changes were 
unreasonable, the driller was asked to re-survey for confirmation. 

• Survey was carried out at 6.1 m, if a change in the length of the drill string is required the 
length of the survey has been adjusted accordingly. The survey was carried out immediately 
on completion of the hole. 

• Survey results were checked by the Dahrouge geologist on the rig who checked for unusual 
dip or azimuth changes. 

• The data is collated in Excel and forwarded to the Dahrouge database manager for 
uploading into the Central Database. 

• A non-magnetic stainless steel drilling rod was used as the first rod to avoid incorrect 
azimuth readings due to magnetic interference from rods. 

SRK considers the methods used for the downhole suverying during the 2011 and 2014 campaigns 
to be inline with Industry best practice. Given the long hole lengths of over 700 m, the Company 
have used suitable techniques to provide a continuous (approximately 6 m intervals), measure of the 
drillhole trace from the base of the hole. The use of a Gyro has avoided any potential issues due to 
the magnetic nature of the rocks, The confidence in the hole location of the Molycorp drilling is 
considered lower due to their historic nature and the wider measurement spacing. Overall SRK 
consider the level of confidence in the downholes surveys to be sufficient for the declaration of an 
Indicated level of Mineral Resource. 

10.3 Interpretation and Relevant Results 
The drilling has been conducted by a reputable contractor using industry standard techniques and 
procedures. This work has confirmed the presence of Niobium hosted in dolomite-carbonatite and 
lamprophyre rocks.

The historical drillholes within the deposit and Mineral Resource area were not conducted on a 
systematic grid and drill spacing varies from 25 to 225 m. The major drilling direction used by 
NioCorp has been towards the northeast for the first phase of the program (Figure 10.3.1). A set of 
scissor holes were drilled to the southwest on one drilling line within the central portion of the 
deposit, to confirm that there is no directional bias in the selected hole orientation.  

The majority of the holes have inclinations in the order of 60° to 70°. The use of scissor holes has 
confirmed the sub vertical nature of the southwest contact (Figure 10.3.1)

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals using industry best 
practice that the core was handled, logged and sampled in an acceptable manner by professional 
geologists, and the results are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 
The following section summarizes the sampling methodology used by Molycorp and the Company 
during the historic drilling, the 2011 and the 2014 drill programs.  

11.1 Molycorp, 1973-1986 
Detailed descriptions of Molycorp's sample procedures, analyses and security have not been 
documented and reviewed by SRK. However, given the detailed nature of the historic drill logs and 
reports for the individual drillholes, and Molycorp's position as a leader in the rare earth industry at 
the time, it considered likely Molycorp applied the same standards to their sampling procedures. 

A review of previous Technical Reports details Ms. Beverly Beethe, a sampling technician for 
Molycorp, recalled the following procedures: 

• The drill core was photographed; 
• The drill core was split with a hydraulic core splitter; 
• The core was crushed on-site, before sending samples to the lab (the crusher is no longer 

on site); and 
• The core crusher was cleaned between samples by using limestone blank material. 

Complete details of the sampling procedures were unclear or whether the procedures had changed 
over the period of the drill programs. Photographs of the core were not included with Molycorp's 
available historic records. 

Molycorp built two well-insulated, steel buildings, located on the Property of Ms. Elda Beethe (Lease 
Agreement Beethe_008), within 100 m of the known deposit. The buildings were ceded to Ms. 
Beethe when Molycorp abandoned the Project. The following italicized text is excerpted from 
McCallum and Cathro 2010, which provides the best detail on the known and assumed methods 
used during Molycorp drilling: 

"It is also uncertain what methods were used to crush, pulverize, blend and split any of the original 
10' intervals and composite intervals. In order to confirm some of the analyses of Molycorp's internal 
laboratory, some of the 10' intervals were split and combined into either 50' or 100' composites and 
sent to commercial laboratories for independent assays. The procedure of creating the larger 
composites is unknown at this time." 

Drill core samples collected were sent to Molycorp's exploration laboratory at Louviers, Colorado for 
niobium and LnO analysis. The analytical methods are described in an internal memo by Sisneros 
and Yernberg, 1983, where "…Niobium was analyzed by wavelength dispersive XRF on pressed 
powder pellets, following pulverization to -325 mesh. Molycorp did include some quality control 
methods. Standardization was provided by using a variety of Elk Creek samples, which had been 
analyzed by alternative methods at other internal Molycorp laboratory facilities. Over the project 
duration, the number and/or identification of the standards used changed several times. In 1981, the 
instrumentation changed from a Philips PW1212 to a PW1400. (Sisernos and Yernberg, 1983) 

The assay tables from some of the holes (EC-27 and EC-30) indicate a 'tentative test' (XRF) of 
niobium value from Louviers laboratory, and a 'commercial lab test" (XRF) of niobium values. It is 
unclear which commercial laboratory conducted these tests, although the 1983 Niobium Analytical

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 52 
 
 

Standardization report mentions that the Molycorp exploration department occasionally utilized 
Bondar-Clegg. Notes on the assay tables indicate that the commercial laboratory utilized one 
standard (from hole EC-11) for its XRF analysis, whereas Louviers utilized 19 standards from hole 
EC-11. 

The drill-core, crushed (coarse reject), and pulverized material are currently being stored at a facility 
managed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). This facility is located approximately 8.5 km 
south of the town of Mead, Nebraska, and approximately 63 km northeast of Lincoln, Nebraska. The 
core was stored at two other storage facilities on UNL property, prior to its current location. Prior to 
the acquisition of the core by UNL in the late 1990s, the core was stored in the steel sheds on the 
property of Elda Beethe.  

SRK completed a site visit to the Mead Core facility by Mr Cody Bramwell on April 15, 2014. An 
inventory of the core was spot checked against a 2011 core inventory list originally compiled by 
Dahrouge and no discrepancies were found. The core investigation concentrated on 26 drillholes 
within the resource area. Table 11.1.1.1, is an inventory of core at the Mead facility filtered to include 
only the 26 drillholes within the resource area.

An investigation of the drillholes within the resource area led to the following conclusions: 

• Core boxes were generally in good condition and labeled well; 
• Not all of the historical core made it to the Mead facility with most drillholes missing between 

six and 26 of the first core boxes (Table 11.1.1.1);

• No drill core of the Pennsylvanian strata exists, hence no information on the strata was 
gathered; 

• Drill core is typically NQ and some noted as being BQ; 
• All drill core had been hydraulically split, removing the option of sampling for geotechnical 

purposes; 
• Accurate geotechnical and hydrogeological parameters were difficult to estimate due to the 

core appearing to have been hydraulically split; and 
• Identifying mineralization was difficult due to the fine grained nature of the rock and a lack of 

differences between mineralized and non-mineralized rock.  

In addition to the drill core, there also exists an unknown inventory of sample pulps and rejects at the 
Mead facility. 

11.2 Quantum Re-Sampling, 2010 
The 2010 re-sampling program utilized a subset (639 samples) of pulverized material from the 
Molycorp drillholes, that were prepared by the analytical division of Molycorp. Samples were derived 
from 1.52 m (5 ft) or 3.05 m (10 ft) intervals of split NQ or HQ diameter size core. SRK noted 
evidence of the resampling during the site inspection to the Mead Core facility. A rigorous QA/QC 
protocol was used, and included the routine insertion of field duplicates, laboratory pulp duplicates, 
blanks and niobium certified reference standards. Samples were transported to the ALS Chemex 
(ALS) facility in Reno, Nevada, and prepared for analysis at the ALS testing facility in North 
Vancouver, BC., using method XE-XRF10, whereby samples are prepared by pulverizing to 90% 
passing -70 µm, then decomposed utilizing a lithium borate flux, and analyzed by XRF. A portion of 
niobium results were checked with Hazen Research Inc. (Hazen) of Golden, Colorado (Quantum 
news release February 22, 2011). 

11.3 Quantum Drilling Program, 2011 
For the 2011 sampling program, a rigorous quality assurance and quality control protocol was 
established. It involved the routine insertion of field duplicates, laboratory pulp duplicates, blanks, 
and certified reference standards. All samples were shipped to, and analyzed by Activation 
Laboratories (Actlabs) of Ancaster, ON. An eight-major oxides, rare earths, and trace element 
package was selected and samples were analyzed via fusion inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and 
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in addition to niobium by XRF, and fluorine 
by method 4F-F (news release, September 21, 2011). 

11.4 NioCorp Drilling Program, 2014 
Different drilling techniques, such as RC and tricone drilling, have been employed to drill through the 
overlying geological rock units (limestone & mudstone), but all carbonatite intervals have been 
diamond cored. All drilling contractors at Elk Creek who utilized DDH utilized conventional wireline 
drilling techniques. Two drilling diameters have been used during the procedure with the upper 
portions of each hole drilled using PQ diameter (85 mm) for geotechnical testing and HQ diameter 
(63.5 mm) through the Carbonatite. Geological and geotechnical logging is completed prior to mark-
up and splitting of the core and completed by onsite geologists with the number of geologists used 
limited to ensure consistency in the logging codes used.

SRK are responsible for the geotechnical logging. Rock quality was determined using the Q-system 
(Q=(RQD/ Jn )* ( Jr/ Ja)* (Jw/SRF), where RQD= Rock quality designation; Jn= Joint set number; Jr= 
Roughness of the most unfavorable joint or discontinuity; Ja= Degree of alteration or filling along the 
weakest joint; JW= Water inflow; SRF= Stress reduction factor. SRK personnel also record hardness 
and weathering to aid in geotechnical parameters for the future mine design.  

Core recovery and RQD were generally good for most drill core, with typically greater than 95% 
recovery. Core recovery has been recorded in the data base and is measured in the field at the 
drilling rig by the geologist. The borehole name is noted and the drilling interval, this is compared to 
the actual core recovered to back calculate the recovery. The recovery information is then loaded 
into the sample database. SRK has reviewed the drill core recovery results and found that, in 
general, the recovery is good with an average recovery of 97% for the Project. A more detailed study 
of the recoveries per hole during Phase 1 indicates recoveries vary from 2% to 100%, with the 
average recovery per hole ranging from 93% to 98%.  

Drill core was digitally photographed under natural outdoor, or fluorescent indoor lighting prior to core 
cutting. All digital photos are of high resolution and stored in a digital archive format. The geological 
logging included observations of color, lithology, texture, structure, mineralization, and alteration. All 
geological information is collected at sample interval scale and recorded in a digital logging program 
that has been custom formatted for carbonatite deposits. Detailed geological core logging of the 
Carbonatite intervals, alteration zones and its relationship to other intrusions, allows sampling to be 
restricted by unique geological boundaries.  

11.4.1 Sample Preparation for Analysis 
Trained staff was involved at all stages of the sampling, sample packaging and sample 
transportation process. Day to day logging tasks were split between Dahrouge and SRK, whereby 
Dahrouge completed all geological and sampling related tasks, while SRK focused on geotechnical 
logging requirements. During the diamond drilling program (including the RC pre-collar drilling of 
RC/DD holes), staff members were based full time at the drill project site to supervise the drilling and 
data collection including geological and geotechnical properties. Geological sampling was completed 
by geologists (Dahrouge), under the supervision of qualified professional geologists. Between four 
and six trained geologists acted as samplers.  

Core sampling method and approach has been consistent through the 2011 and 2014 drill programs. 
Core was boxed on site and delivered each day to a core facility on the Elk Creek project site where 
the core was logged and sawn. For the current diamond drilling program, two coring drill rigs were 
monitored by two qualified professional geologists, one drill supervisor and an experienced 
geological team. Drill core was boxed and transported from each drill rig to the core processing 
facility (distances up to 800 m), at the end of each 12 hour shift. Core logging involved detailed 
geotechnical and geological information. All key geological features have been logged 
comprehensively. A project database which contains the relevant rock codes and lithology 
descriptions has been created. A total of 18 rock codes have been used during the logging, with the 
targeted geological unit isolated to approximately 2 rock codes. DDH core was sampled and assayed 
at predominantly 1 m intervals.  

The drill core within each core box was marked up and then split using one of three electric-powered, 
water-cooled diamond-bladed BD 3003E Core Saws along the orientation marks, at the Elk Creek

sample preparation and storage facility. HQ and minor intervals of PQ core were halved for assay. 
Broken or soft sections of the core (typically the iron oxide altered zones) were sampled by the 
geologists and an equal sample split was taken from this material. These intervals account for a 
significantly small portion of the sampled material. Core was sawed in half lengthwise with half of the 
core sent to the laboratory for assaying, and the remaining half archived at the Sample Logging, 
Preparation and Storage facility at the Elk Creek facility. 

A summary of the sampling procedure used to collect core samples at Elk Creek is as follows: 

• The entire carbonatite intersection was sampled, including the geologically logged low-grade 
niobium carbonatite intervals of the footwall or hangingwall. 

• Sample intervals, generally 1 m in length, were marked on the core and recorded in 
geological database (Fusion Database). 

• Sample intervals were assigned a unique sample number. 
• Specific gravity measurements were performed at approximately 6 m spacing 
• Hand-held Niton-XRF measurements were collected on the core to assist geological and 

sample divisions. 
• Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on the core to assist geological and 

sample divisions. 
• Clearly marked sample intervals were sawn in half by a wet diamond saw. 
• Sawn intervals were cleaned prior to bagging and cutting equipment is regularly cleaned. 
• Sampled intervals were placed in durable barcoded sample bags that were clearly labelled 

and contain back up sample tags within each bag. 
• Sample bags containing original core sections and field inserted control samples were 

barcode scanned and secured in 5 gallon plastic shipping pails. 
• Detailed shipping logs and preparation requests were sent in hard copy and digitally to the 

primary analytical laboratory. 
• Sampled core sections and blind control samples were shipped for analysis in secured pails 

and transferred using a bonded trucking company  
• Half of the core is stored in labelled wooden core boxes for reference or further sampling. 

Core samples and the core library are securely stored at the project facility work area. This material 
is stored inside locked metal buildings when the project is not operating. 

11.4.2 Security Measures 
NioCorp has rigorous security measures in place to prevent any tampering of the core or samples 
before and during the transport process. These measures include redundant sample identification, 
appropriate sample bag closures . SRK is of the opinion that these measures are consistent with or 
in excess of current industry best practices for projects at this scale of exploration. 

11.4.3 Sample Analysis 
The 2011 and 2014 sawn core samples were shipped to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) 1336 
Sandhill drive, Ancaster, Ontario Canada. Actlabs is the primary laboratory for sample preparation 
and for analysis of the 2011 and 2014 drill core samples. Actlabs regularly participates in proficiency 
testing and maintains formal approval of CAN-P-1578, CAN-P-1579, CAN-P-1585, CAN-P-4E 
(ISO/IEC 17025:2005) accreditation from Standards Council of Canada and maintains current

certification issued March 5, 2014 through February 27, 2018. Actlabs maintains ISO 17025 
standards, which is obtained through experienced peer audits that ensure they conform to 
recognized analytical standards and that the accredited method validation verifies a number of 
analytical variables designed to ensures that data obtained from these methods are defensible. 
Actlabs maintain a custom Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) system to provide 
the traceability necessary for today's stringent reporting requirements.  

The 2014 sampling program employed SGS as an external check laboratory. SGS is an integrated 
geochemistry, mineralogy and metallurgy laboratory in Lakefield, ON, with has extensive experience 
with Nb & REE analysis for both exploration and metallurgy projects. SGS Lakefield is ISO17025 
accredited for the analysis methods used on this project (GO_XRF76V). 

Core sample are received by the Actlabs, where they are received, weighed, prepared, and assayed. 
Sample preparation is completed using Actlabs' RX1 preparation package that has been modified to 
meet the project requirements. A summary of the process is detailed below: 

• Samples layout, receiving and cataloging; 
• Collect as received sample weight, Weight Report (kg); 
• Drying of the whole sample at 60°C for 12 hours, in a customized high air flow drying room; 
• Collect dry sample weight, Weight Report (kg); 
• Crushed in a jaw crusher (Boyd crushers) to 90% passing -10 mesh (2 mm), with quartz 

cleaner between each sample; 
• Riffle split (RSD splitters or option of Jones Riffle split) coarse crushed sample and extract a 

250 g sample; 
• Pulverized 250 g sample using ESSA pulverizers with ring and puck bowls to 95% -200 

mesh (75 µm), with quartz cleaner between each sample; 
• Laboratory internal coarse-reject duplicates (1 in 50 ) and Pulp duplicates (1 in 30) are also 

routinely prepared; and 
• Quality of the rejects and pulps are routinely monitored to ensure proper preparation 

procedures are performed. 

During the preparation procedure coarse-reject splits and pulp-splits are extracted from the original 
core sections for primary laboratory and secondary (external) laboratory check analysis. These 
samples are then inserted into the sampled sequence and/or shipped to the external check 
laboratory, SGS (Lakefield), for analysis.  

Core samples were systematically assayed at Actlabs for niobium (Nb2O5) and tantalum (Ta2O5) by 
XRF analysis, using a Panalytical Axios-mAX, following a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion of a 2 
g sample. All XRF analysis followed procedures outlined in Actlabs "8-XRF" package, with selected 
analytical results provided for Nb2O5 and Ta2O5. Whole Rock analysis and 43 Major Elements was 
completed using ICP and ICP/MS (by a Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, 6100, 9000 ICP/MS) finish 
following a Lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion preparation as defined by analytical Actlabs' "8-
REE Major Elements Fusion ICP(WRA)/Trace Elements Fusion ICP/MS(WRA4B2)" package. 

Additional analysis was performed for fluoride, using analytical package "4F-F". Fluoride content is 
quantified using a fluoride ion electrode to directly measure fluoride-ion activity, when a prepared 
fuseate is dissolved in dilute nitric acid and its ionic strength adjusted in ammonium citrate buffer.

Prior to analysis sample is prepped using a combined fusion with lithium metaborate and lithium 
tetraborate in induction furnace.  

All QC data are registered in the LIMS system and Assay results have been returned to NioCorp and 
the overseeing professional geologists in electronic format and loaded into the sample database with 
the batch number and date of assay recorded after review for QA/QC.  

External pulp check samples were submitted to SGS (Lakefield) Labs, as a third party sample 
preparation and analytical result confirmation. Pulp samples and their control samples were prepared 
by Actlabs and shipped to SGS (Lakefield), where they were received, evaluated for sample quality 
and re-homogenized, and assayed. SGS (Lakefield) prepared and re-homogenized samples prior to 
analysis using MISC80 package samples using MISC80 package prior to analysis. During

11.5 Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures 
The Company has integrated a series of routine QA/QC procedures throughout the sampling and 
analytical analysis for both the 2011 and 2014 drilling programs, to ensure a high level of quality is 
maintained throughout the process. SRK has not reviewed any QA/QC data for the Molycorp drilling

program, as no information has been detailed in the database. Definition of quality of the historical 
assays has been based on resampling/verification work completed by Dahrouge during 2010 – 2011.  

The following control measures were used to monitor both the precision and accuracy of sampling, 
sub sampling, preparation and assaying. For the 2011 and 2014 sampling the QA/QC consisted of 
the insertion of duplicate samples taken from various stages of the process, insertion of known 
control samples (Standards Reference Material (SRM) and Blanks), plus an external check at a SGS 
laboratory. A summary of the type of samples, source and level of insertion is included in Table 
11.4.1 and Table 11.4.2. Note percentages are reported as proportion of samples versus the original 
½ core submissions.

The following section provides details of the types of samples used at each section of the sampling 
process, followed by a discussion of the results. The QA/QC data is analyzed by the Project 
geologist on a routine basis prior to entering the data into the central database. Failures are reported 
directly back to the laboratory with agreeded systems in place for reanalysis (example 10 samples 
before and after a failed standard) 

SRK has been supplied with all the raw QA/QC data and has completed an independent check of the 
results.  

11.5.1 Actions 
The Company has a defined list of action points to review all QA/QC results. To review field quartz 
blanks a limit of 20 x ICP-MS detection limits and 2 x XRF detection limits, depending on the element 

JAO/MLM ElkCreek_NI43-101_TRR_241900.030_013_MLM.docx November 3, 2014

being analyzed are applied. Results which report above this value are reported to the laboratory as 
having potential contamination.  

The SRM has been sourced from Dillinger Hutte Laboratory (Germany). SRK has reviewed the 
certificates for each of the SRM's and notes that no standard deviation has been supplied and only a 
confidence interval of 95% is shown on the certificates (based on three laboratory round robin 
testwork). Due to a lack of information in the certificate the Company has elected to use a 5% error 
as a caution limit, and a 10% error as a failure. While this is not generally accepted as best practice 
which would be based on 2 x or 3 x standard deviations for caution or failure, SRK agrees that the 
limits applied are reasonably tight which provide a reasonable level of control in assigning 
confidence to the assay results. To test if any significant differences exist between the decision 
points to use either a 10% limit or 3 x 95% interval. SRK noted no significant difference in the 
potential pass/fail decisions and therefore considers the current limits to be acceptable.  

In terms of the duplicate samples, no reassays are requested based on the field duplicates, which 
are monitored for sample fluctuations and local variability. The reject and pulp duplicates are 
reviewed and reassays requested on values in excess of 20% difference using the equation: 

% Diff = ABS [(X1-X2) / (X1+X2)] *100 

When Duplicates or SRM's fail the 10 sequential samples on either side of the QC Sample is re-
analyzed or re-analysis of the entire batch is requested, depending on the fail type, location, and 
sample range. 

11.5.2 Field Sample Collection, Identification, Labeling, Insertion of Field Controls 
and Shipment 
Sample tickets were assigned initially at the core shed using barcodes with duplicate tickets placed 
in the bag and on the outside of the bag, In addition to the routine samples a number of check 
samples (QC) were routinely inserted. Trained staff were involved at all stages of the sampling, 
sample packaging and sample transportation process.  

Sample identification was confirmed using barcode labeling and visual sample type comparisons 
prior to sample shipment. Utilization of barcoded samples ensured both shipment forms and 
analytical labs used accurate information. Two types of QC samples were inserted at this stage of 
the process which include the following: 

• Field ¼-core duplicates – 1 in 20 (5%), inserted to test mineralization and sampling 
variability; and  

• Field quartz blanks – 1 in 20 (5%) Blanks were inserted within or immediately after samples 
collected from mineralized intervals, targeting zones of elevated visual mineralization, where 
possible. 

11.5.3 Sample Preparation and Insertion of Pre-Selected and Quality Control 
Samples: Actlabs 
Samples were dispatched to the laboratory via commercial transport. The laboratory received and 
weighed samples, receiving logs were received by Dahrouge, which are then checked against 
original sample lists to ensure accuracy.

The standard sample preparation at the laboratory targeting the criteria of 95% passing 200 mesh 
(-200 mesh). The high passing rate and the fine mesh are required to ensure the niobium minerals 
are sufficiently liberated for sub-sampling due to the fine size fractions known from metallurgical and 
petrographical studies. 

To ensure quality throughout the sample preparation phase, NioCorp (via Dahrouge) utilized the 
insertion and splitting of pre-selected control and duplicate samples, based on the insertion rates 
discussed in Table 11.4.1. 

11.5.4 Results 
Standards (SRM's) 

A total of 188 SRM's consisting of four different types were inserted in Actlabs batches as part of the 
routine sample submissions using material sourced from Dillinger Haute laboratory. A summary of 
the defined limits and results are shown in Table 11.4.4.1. The table shows the mean assay grades 
versus the assigned, plus a summary of the number of samples returned outside of the warning and 
acceptable limits.

The results from the SRM submissions have been within acceptable limits, with results generally 
reporting slightly above the assigned grades (between 1.0% and 4.4%). This can be seen in Figure 
11.4.4.1 with the assay values typically reporting above the assigned value of the SRM. In general 
these range between the assigned value and the +5% caution line. Statistically the results indicate a 
slight high bias across all grade ranges with the differences between the mean and assigned grades 
ranging from 1.0% to 6.6%. A total of two samples have reported outside the failure level of +10%. 
Discussion with the Project geologist indicated the first SRM failure (SX-18-02) was due to the 
insertion of incorrect SRM. The second SRM failed high with a re-assay requested by the Company, 
which the laboratory reported as having no significant variation from the original assay. Overall SRK 
considers that the SRM's have performed within acceptable levels of error for the reporting of 
Mineral Resources. SRK has discussed the slight high bias with the Project geologist and it is 
reported that communication is on-going with the laboratory to investigate any potential sources of 
bias.

Blanks 

Coarse natural blanks were also included in order to:  

• To pass through the same sample preparation system as the real samples and highlight any 
potential contamination; and 

• To be indistinguishable from real samples and prevent these samples being treated in a 
different manner to real samples at the laboratory. 

The following certified natural blanks were inserted within batches of samples sent to the laboratory. 
In total, 154 natural blanks were inserted at regular intervals within the sample suite which 
represents 4.8% of total sample submissions from the Phase 1 drilling program.  

SRK notes that cluster assays, during the early stages of the Phase 1 drilling, displayed potential 
sample contaminations but SRK does not consider this to be material to the Mineral Resource 
estimate.

11.5.5 Check Analysis SGS versus Actlabs 

A total of 155 pulp duplicate samples, comprising a second riffled sample split of pulverized material, 
taken at the same time of extraction as the primary pulps, were submitted as part of the routine 
sample submission to a check laboratory (SGS). The total number of samples represents the 
equivalent of approximately 5% of the original submissions.  

A review of the SRM material inserted in the SGS data returned reasonable assays closer to the 
assigned values when compared to Actlabs (Figure 11.5.5.1). The chart indicate that similar to 
Actlabs the SRM's return values at or above the assigned grades.  

A review of the XY Scatter plot (Figure 11.5.5.2) shows a high bias exists between the two datasets 
with Actlabs reporting consistenly higher across all grade ranges. SRK assumes this indicates some 
difference in the either method or equipment accuracy at one of the laboratories. A comparison of 
the mean grades indicates a high bias towards the Actlabs results in the order of 6.6% on the mean 
grades (Actlabs reporting higher grades).  

After considering the performance of the two laboratory for SRM material submitted, SRK concludes 
that a small high bias exists in the Phase 1 database which needs to be monitored in future Phases. 
The bias has been reported to the laboratory and investigations into probable cause are ongoing, no 
conclusion on the source of the bias is available at the time of writing.  

SRK concludes that while a small bias exists it is currently within acceptable levels of error and 
therefore has accepted the database as presented by Actlabs.

Two methodologies have been implemented, (1) water immersion specific gravity measurement and 
(2) volumetric dry density measurement. Initially only the water immersion measurements were taken 
but during the site inspection by SRK it was recommended that a volumetric wet and dry density 
measurements should also be taken, due to the porous or vuggy nature of some of the core causing 
possible errors in the water immersion method. The two methods used are described below: 

Water immersion method determines the specific gravity by the following formula: 

SG = (weight in air) / (weight in air – weight in water) 

A 10 to 20 cm piece of whole, dry, HQ core is weighed dry on an Ohaus Scout Pro and the weight 
recorded. The weight in water is determined by attaching the core by a long nylon fishing line to the 
Ohaus balance, lowering the core piece into a large plastic tub located immediately below the scale 
and filled with purified water. The weight of the core while immersed is then recorded, and applied to 
the formula for determining the SG. Porous core samples of altered carbonatite cannot be accurately 
measured using this method and are better represented by using the dry density measurement. 

Dry Volumetric method determines the Density by the following formula: 

SG= [(weight in air)]/ [(π) (core length) (core radius)2] 

A 10 to 15 cm piece of whole, HQ or PQ core, is dried in a convection oven for 60 minutes at 200°F. 
If core still has moisture, it is left in the oven for a longer period of time. The exact length of the core 
is measured with a caliper and recorded. The sample is then weighed dry in air by suspending the 
core by a long nylon fishing line from an Ohaus Scout Pro balance and the weight of the core 
recorded. It is assumed the radius remains constant for each size of drill core: 31.75 mm for HQ and 
41.50 mm for PQ. These measurements are applied to the formula for determining the SG. 
Calibration weights were occasionally used to verify the accuracy of the balance. The table used to 
complete the measurements is made of wood construction and tested for level by the technician 

A comparison between the two methods (Figure 11.6.1) shows that the water immersion method 
returns higher density values. A statistical analysis of the mean grades of the two populations where 
both methods have been recorded show a difference of approximatelty 2%. The correlation shown 
on the XY scatter indicates a strong correlation for the majority of cases, but for some samples the 
are significant differences with the volumetric density returning higher grades. This may be a result of 
voids, porous material.  

SRK does not consider the difference to have a material impact but recommends the Company 
continue with the use of the volumetric measurements, as the water immersion method could result 
in a high bias. To confirm the density of the samples SRK recommends independent analysis on 
selected samples at the Primary Laboratory, during the next phase of work. Additionally, SRK 
recommends the Company weigh the samples before and after drying to obtain an estimate of 
moisture content.

. 

11.7 Opinion on Adequacy 
SRK comments that the decision for reassays of the SRM's/standards is based on a percentage and 
not the typical 2 x standard deviation, or 3 x standard deviation which is generally accepted as 
industry best practice. SRK has reviewed the original certificates for the SRMs submitted as part of 
the 2014 program and notes that no standard deviation is shown on the certificate. The limits have 
been requested from the supplier by Dahrouge but not supplied. The current method of using a 5% 
and 10% limit while not ideal provides a reasonable level of confidence in the control samples.  

SRK is of the opinion that these measures are consistent with or in excess of current industry best 
practices for projects at this scale of exploration.

12 Data Verification  
The geological database has been provided to SRK by Dahrouge who have been involved with the 
Project since the Company acquired the Project, under it's former name of Quantum. In addition to 
the digital database SRK has been provided access to historical copies of the data captured in 
scanned format for the drilling logs.  

During the period of ownership by the Company a number of validation exercises have been 
completed on the database to provide a high level of confidence in the data available for the 
geological modelling and associated Mineral Resource Estimate.  

The following Section provides a summary of the previous verification exercises completed by 
Dahrouge and Tetra Tech (as part of the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report), plus additional 
verification work completed by SRK as part of the current study. 

12.1 Tetra Tech Data Verification, 2012 
Tetra Tech reviewed the database of the 27 drillholes within the Project area and found: 

• The database consists of 29 drillholes, totaling 18,159.15 m. Twenty-seven of the twenty-
nine drillholes, totaling 17,057 m, were used in the interpretation of the Elk Creek Nb 
deposit; 

• Tetra Tech performed an internal verification process of the project database against the 
original logs, surveyor reports, and laboratory-issued assay certificates; 

• The data verification process examined the collars (easting, northing, elevation), lithologies 
(interval, rock type), and assays (sample number, Nb2O5% value); 

• No errors in the collar, lithology, and assay files;  
• A number of holes (EC-25, EC-33, EC-34, EC-35, EC-36 and EC-37) were missing 

downhole survey information, however.these holes appear on the southwestern limit of the 
deposit and were only used in the interpretation of the deposit, not in the resource estimate; 

• Quantum's 2010 to 2011 re-sampling data compared to historic values was less than 1% 
different in all cases except for one where the tolerance was less than 2%; 

• REE assay values were not included in the 2012 Mineral Resource estimate and therefore 
were excluded from the verification analysis; 

• The results of the verification study found the following: During Quantum's 2011 drilling 
program, seven historic Molycorp drill collars were uncovered to survey the collar locations. 
The entries in the survey reports were recorded in imperial units (feet) and a factor of 0.3048 
was used to convert the values into a metric system (meters). The database entries were 
verified against these converted values from the survey reports, and no inconsistencies were 
found;  

• Completed verification of digital database against the assay certificates for the three holes 
drilled within the Elk Creek Nb Deposit (NEC11-001, NEC11-002, and NEC11-003), 
accounting for 1,195 of the total 6,078 samples, or 19.66% of the entire sample dataset., and 
no errors were observed; 

• It was noted that when assaying yielded results below detection limit, half the detection limit 
(i.e. less than 0.003 Nb2O5%) was entered in the database for samples from 2011 drillholes, 

JAO/MLM ElkCreek_NI43-101_TRR_241900.030_013_MLM.docx November 3, 2014 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 71 
 
 

whereas a value of 0 was entered for all such occurrences in holes drilled prior to 2011. SRK 
has utilized a value of half the detection limit for all such occurrences; 

• Completed verification on the lithological logging for potential transcription errors for NEC11-
001, NEC11-002, and NEC11-003. It was noted that overburden depths were not recorded in 
the logs but were, however, entered in the database; 

• Sixteen of the historic Molycorp drillholes were attributed with a negative azimuth value in 
the survey file. All drillholes were vertical therefore rendering the azimuth insignificant, and 
all such negative values were corrected to zero; 

• Tetra Tech identified a number of cases where minor intervals where logged in the field but 
were not transcribed into the database; 

• All errors were correct by Tetra Tech prior to importing into technical software; 
• The header, lithology, survey, and assays tables from the database were imported into 

Gemcom GEMS™ software, which has a routine that checks for duplicate intervals, 
overlapping intervals, and intervals beyond the length of the hole. No further errors were 
identified within the routine; and,  

• Completion of a site inspection on February 8 to 9, 2012, which included the inspection of 
Quantum's 2011 drillhole locations and of the core logging, sampling and storage facility.  

Independent check samples were collected during the site visit by Tetra Tech. Four ¼ core samples 
were collected from the available drill core at the core storage site at Quantum's core logging and 
sampling facility. 

• The samples were sent to Actlabs in Ancaster, ON for analysis. The sample preparation was 
carried out by crushing the sample with the entire sample passing a 10 Mesh (1.7 mm) 
screen. The sample was then split and 250 g pulverized with hardened steel to 95% passing 
a 150 Mesh (106 µm) screen (Actlabs code RX1). Analysis for niobium was conducted using 
XRF analysis; 

• The Tetra Tech check sample analysis correlates well with Quantum's assay results for the 
same sample intervals in three of the four cases; and,  

• Tetra Tech concluded that the analytical results for Nb2O5% have been confirmed and that 
they are adequate for purposes of the 2012 Technical Report. Results of the check assay 
sample analysis and corresponding sample analysis by Quantum are shown in Table 12.1.1.

SRK geologists Cody Bramwell (36 days) and Nikoliya Boyanich (70 days) were on site during the 
drilling program conducted by NioCorp.  

12.2.1 Site Inspection 
In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Martin Pittuck (Qualified Person) visited the Elk Creek 
Project between June 17 and 19, 2014. The main purpose of the site visit was to: 

• Ascertain the geological and geographical setting of the Elk Creek deposit;  
• Witness the extent of the exploration work completed to date;  
• Inspect the drilling rig(s); 
• Review the sample preparation methodology; 
• Inspect core logging and sample storage facilities;  
• Discuss geological interpretation and inspect drill core; and 
• Assess logistical aspects and other practicalities relating to the exploration property. 

SRK was able to verify the quality of geological and sampling information and develop an 
interpretation of niobium grade distributions appropriate to use in the Mineral Resource model. A 
basic review of the electronic database against a number of drillhole intersections was also 
completed. 

In addition to the site inspection by Martin Pittuck SRK has had a continual involvement reviewing 
data, interpretation and modelling outcomes. 

12.2.2 Procedures 
SRK checked the coordinates of all drillholes via handheld GPS for NioCorp 2014 drillholes. SRK 
notes that the drillholes are well-located in terms of northing and easting. SRK comments that the 
relatively low-precision topographic survey being used at this stage, which is based on a 5 m 
contoured topography, result in differences within the evelvation but this is not considered material. 
SRK notes that this topography is sufficient for the current level of study, but has amended the 
topography to include the surveyed drill collars (where the collar locations have been surveyed by 
external contractors) as real data points. In the cases, SRK has integrated the collar locations into 
the survey file and provided a buffer around each point, to create an updated more accurate digital 
terrain surface (DTM). SRK recommends a more detailed topographic survey be conducted or 
purchased if available, prior to the any detailed engineering study being completed. 

The database used for the resource estimate was constructed by Dahrouge and is stored in CAE 
Mining Fusion Database, and is considered to be of good quality. The use of a commercial database 
is considered industry best practice with the following key advantages: 

• System facilitates fast and accurate data collection and can be configured (via pick-lists) to 
meet all specific data schemes and logging standards relevant to each site;  

• Drillhole-related data directly at the worksite on a touch-screen tablet or a notebook 
computer;

• Data is stored locally and synchronized to a single central database for the Project via a 
network connection, transfer to and from the Central Database provides an audit trail for any 
edits made to the database; 

• QA/QC system allows users to achieve immediate data validation as information is captured. 
Only valid field values and labels are accepted, ensuring consistent logging standards are 
applied across multiple staff or sites;  

• Importing laboratory results can be done directly with no potential transcription errors. If 
setup the import function can proactively detect problems with analytical results; and 

• Export routines can be created to provide the required data for use in technical software in a 
consistent format. 

SRK has been supplied with exports from the Central database covering, collar, survey, lithology, 
assay, alteration and key structural indicators. SRK has used importing routines within Datamine 
Mining Software (Datamine) and ARANZ Leapfrog Mining Software (Leapfrog). During the importing 
routine the following errors have been noted: 

• Assay values in the Moycorp database where Nb2O5% values are set to zero, these are 
assumed by SRK to represent values below detection limits and so SRK reset the values to 
of the respective half detection limit; 

• In EC-011 the maximum depth of the assay database exceeds the end of hole in the collar 
file with a difference of 769.62 m versus 769.32 m in the assay and collars respectively. SRK 
has extended the end of hole to match the final depth of the assay database; 

• Within the multi-element database a number of cases exist in the Molycorp assays 
(re-assayed by Dahrouge) where values are absent. SRK has assumed that this is due to 
the original samples not being located for re-submission. SRK has ignored all cases where 
this occurs and inserted a default "NNS" for use in Leapfrog during the geological modelling 
process; and 

• A search for sample overlaps or significant gaps in the interval tables, duplicate samples, 
errors in the length field, anomalous assay and survey results has been completed. No 
material issues were noted in the final sample database. 

The original signed, .pdf copies of the laboratory certificates were also spot verified for hole 
NEC14-006 to the final electronic assay database and no errors were found.  

During the geological modelling stage of the current investigation SRK has reviewed the data 
captured during 2010 from the historical Molycorp database. SRK has minor reservations over the 
usefulness of the data as only major units of the geological logging data have been captured. In 
particular only two Carbonatite codes (dolCarb or dolCarbBc) were used, compared to five codes 
used in the 2014 process; SRK considers the magnetite bearing rocks to be better mineralized and 
this geological detail is missing from the Molycorp logs. A summary of the different logging codes 
used for the three phases is shown in Table 12.2.2.1. The table highlights that according to the 
current geological description method 40% to 50% of the intercepted length within the Carbonatite 
consists of a more magnetite rich unit.

Work programs will be required to update the data capture of the Molycorp geological logging codes 
to provide the same level of confidence for geological interpretation as created from NioCorp's 
logging codes.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing  
13.1 Introduction to Niobium Processing 

To provide context on the typical metallurgical processing routes to produce a niobium concentrate 
SRK provides a brief summary taken from Niobium 101 summary found on www.iamgold.com 
website. 

"After the ore is mined it is finely ground and beneficiated (separation process) by flotation and high-
intensity magnetic separation to remove iron minerals. In Canada, nitric acid can be used to remove 
apatite, and in Brazil a chloride leach process is used to reduce the barium, phosphorus and sulphur 
content. The end result of this physical processing is a pyrochlore concentrate grading 55-60% 
Nb2O5. Most pyrochlore concentrates, however, are converted into a standard-grade ferroniobium for 
use in applications where the retained impurities can be tolerated. For applications requiring higher 
purity levels, further processing is required to yield purity levels of ~99% such as the levels found in 
niobium oxides and vacuum-grade ferroniobium." 

Historically basic metallurgical testing has been completed by both Molycorp and Quantum for the 
Project. In support of this study, NioCorp has completed metallurgical characterization of the Elk 
Creek Mineral Resource undertaken at Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado (Hazen) and at SGS 
laboratories in Lakefield, Ontario (SGS). Both labs have reported on their progress informally through 
September 9, 2014 via e-mail and teleconferences with NioCorp.  

The following section describes the progress of the studies. 

13.2 Historical Testwork 

13.2.1 Molycorp 
Molycorp completed a number of tests on three composite samples. The findings from the studies 
are summarized in the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report entitled "Elk Creek Nb Project, 
Nebraska, US, Resource Estimate Update, dated April 23, 2012. In the report it has been highlighted 
that due to incompleteness of the reporting it has not been possible to establish the 
representativeness of the original samples with respect to the mineralization. A summary of the 
findings is presented in Table 13.2.1.1 below: 

Table 13.2.1.1: Summary of Molycorp Metallurgical Testwork Findings

EC-40 1.1% to 1.2%  17.6%  Up to 50.6%  Flotation testwork using hot fatty acid float 
Source: SRK, 2014 

 

The investigation confirmed the presence of Niobium and that extraction via floatation was a possible 
route for future processing. More testwork would be required to ensure sample representivity and 
investigate improvements/optimization of the processing flowsheet.

13.2.2 Quantum 2011 - 2012 

In November 2011, the Company contracted Hazen of Golden Colorado to conduct characterization 
and process development studies on two samples collected from the 2011 drilling campaign. The 
samples were collected from borehole NEC11-001 (majority) with a single sample selected from 
NEC11-002. Three samples were taken from NEC11-001 which covered a range of low, medium and 
high grade material. All samples were collected from ¼ core, with selection based on consistency of 
grades and whole rock geochemistry assays.  

The testwork included: 

• Assay: Sample preparation and analysis by XRF including 31 elements and whole rock 
analysis, with check analysis at Actlabs in Ontario via inductively coupled plasma-mass 
spectrometry (ICP-MS); 

• Mineralogy: x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Optical Microscopy and Electron Probe 
analysis, plus a QEMSCAN analysis; 

• Benefication grinding and gravity separation; 
• Magnetic separation; and 
• Flotation. 

The work focused on grinding, floation, roasting and magnetic separation testing and applying the 
techniques used at other operating niobium plants to generate a high-grade physical concentrate. 
The testwork established that niobium mineral liberation required fine grinding, on the order of 8 
microns. High niobium losses were encountered during the magnetic separation tests. The flotation 
testwork examined a number of collectors and flotation schemes for both direct niobium mineral 
flotation and reverse flotation for carbonates, sulfides and other gangue minerals. A total of 153 
bench tests were completed during this time frame, but a high grade physical concentrate (~40% Nb 
by weight) was not achieved.  

13.3 NioCorp (2014) Testing and Procedures 
The laboratories were provided with drill core samples representative of the geological model within 
the Mineralization wireframes, and have completed testing to define the mineralogy as well as to 
separate and recover niobium-bearing minerals. Further substantial detailed testing, optimization and 
analysis will be required to define a process flowsheet for the project and to refine the actual 
technical and financial viability of the project 

13.3.1 Hazen Testwork 
The program at Hazen commenced in April 2014 and concluded in August 2014. Hazen completed a 
Qemscan analysis on selected mineralized intersections to define the mineralogy and the 
deportment of niobium. The key conclusions from the Qemscan study were that the niobium 
mineralization is fine grained, and that 77% of the niobium occurs in the mineral pyrochlore while the 
balance occurs in an iron-titanium-niobium oxide mineral of varying composition.  

Hazen conducted a series of bench scale mineral processing tests on selected samples taken from 
¼ core over selected intersections of the mineralization. A total of 191 individual tests were 
completed. Neither gravity nor magnetic separation tests showed any appreciable upgrading of the

samples tested. Flotation testing was not successful, as an appreciable upgrading of niobium to the 
flotation concentrate was not achieved. 

13.3.2 SGS Testwork 
The SGS program also started in April 2014 and is ongoing as of the date of this report. SGS 
completed a mineralogical study on the resource using XRD and Qemscan methodologies to confirm 
the mineralogy and the deportment of niobium. Twenty variability samples from assay rejects and ten 
drill core samples from the resource were analyzed. XRD analysis of 5 composites yielded moderate 
amounts of dolomite, ankerite, and mica with minor to trace amounts of calcite, magnetite, barite, 
fluorite, apatite, quartz, ilmenite, pyrochlore, chlorite, rutile, ilmenorutile, cerianite, pyroxene, 
magnetite, hematite, and potassium-feldspar.  

The Qemscan results indicated that if the average concentration of niobium is used, then pyrochlore 
carries most of the niobium (60% to 85% and ave. 77%), followed by Nb-rutile (6% to 33%, ave. 
16%), and ilmenorutile (1% to 14%, and ave. 7%), where trace levels (<1%) are hosted by REE 
minerals. These results are consisted with the Qemscan analysis conducted by Hazen. 

SGS also completed a series of bench scale mineral processing tests on samples of the resource. A 
total of 69 tests were completed. SGS did complete gravity and magnetic separation tests, which 
showed a similar lack of upgrading as was seen in the tests completed by Hazen. SGS initiated a 
series of flotation tests using hydroxamate based collectors, which did demonstrate upgrading of the 
niobium content in the flotation concentrate with appreciable metallurgical recoveries. Table 13.3.2.1 
demonstrates the progress of the SGS flotation testwork:

July 3.48 64 14.9 
August 5.67 61.7 9.4 
Source: SRK, 2014 

 

The test results demonstrated improvements in concentrate grade and a reduction in the overall 
mass pull to the flotation concentrate during the course of the study to date. The testwork also 
demonstrated that a flotation concentrate of sufficient grade to feed directly to a pyrometallurgical 
process in order to produce ferroniobium product was not feasible. As a result, a hydrometallurgical 
test program was initiated at SGS in June 2014. 

The intent of the hydrometallurgical program was to produce a niobium-bearing material from the 
flotation concentrate that is of sufficient grade and purity that it can be used to produce ferroniobium. 
The first step in the hydrometallurgical process is pre-leaching. Pre-leaching involves the dissolution 
of gangue minerals present in the flotation concentrate in order to produce a residue that is upgraded 
in niobium. Fourteen pre-leach tests have been completed, using either hydrochloric or sulfuric 
acids. Twelve tests showed niobium losses to the pre-leach solution of 1% or less. Both types of 
acids were effective in these tests. Mass reduction in the tests with low niobium losses ranged from 
9% to 65%.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 79 
 
 

The residue from the pre-leach testing was subjected to an acid baking operation. The residue was 
mixed with sulfuric acid and put in a furnace for varying amounts of time. After removal from the 
furnace, the residue was leached with water to recover niobium into solution. Fifteen acid bake and 
water leach tests have been completed, and niobium extraction into solution ranged from 7% to 98%.  

Following the acid bake step, testing to precipitate niobium from the water leach solution using 
thermal hydrolysis were attempted. A total of 10 tests have been completed, and the maximum 
amount of niobium precipitated from the water leach solution was 27%. Additional testing of 
conditions in the precipitation step are planned during the fourth quarter 2014, with the objective of 
optimizing the precipitation reaction and achieving a high recovery of niobium to the precipitate. 

13.3.3 Sample Representativeness 
Samples for the 2014 metallurgical program have been selected from within the limits of known 
mineralization from drilling completed during 2011 and from the first three holes drilled as part of 
Phase 1. The samples represent a cross-section of material through the core of the deposit and are 
considered representative of the expected feed material.  

13.4 Relevant Results 
The hydrometallurgical step that would logically follow the precipitation step involves the dissolution 
of the precipitate, followed by solvent extraction testing to separate niobium from iron, titanium and 
other minor contaminants. This testwork is expected to commence in the near future. If successful, 
this testwork would be followed by a final precipitation of niobium which in turn would facilitate testing 
of the aluminothermic reduction process to produce ferroniobium. 

Figure 13.4.1 provides an overview of the results from the SGS work, as well as the near-term 
direction of the testing program. References to specific SGS test numbers are included.

13.5 Recovery Estimate Assumptions 
Based on the recovery factors defined from SGS the Niobium recovery is approximately 61% to 68% 
in flotation, with the completed phases of the hydromet testwork demontrating very high recoveries, 
based on testwork completed between June and August. Testwork remains on-going with more 
detailed work and results expected in fourth quarter 2014. SRK has assumed an overall metallurgical 
recovery of 60% for the purpose of the current study during the definition of the CoG.

14 Mineral Resource Estimate 
14.1 Qualifed Person of the Mineral Resource Estimate 

This section describes the Mineral Resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key 
assumptions considered by SRK. In the opinion of SRK, the Mineral Resource estimate reported 
herein is a reasonable representation of the global Niobium Mineral Resources found at Elk Creek at 
the current level of sampling. The Mineral Resources have been estimated in conformity with 
generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" 
guidelines and are reported in accordance with NI 43-101. Mineral Resources are not Mineral 
Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part 
of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

Martin Pittuck is the Qualified Person (QP) responsible for the resource estimation methodology and 
the resource statement. Mr Pittuck has been assisted by Ben Parsons, MAusIMM (CP) a Principal 
Consultant at SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc, who has constructed the geologic model and completed the 
grade estimation under the close supervision and review of Martin Pittuck. Mr Parsons has 14 years 
in geological model and resource estimation and has completed the estimation using a combination 
of Leapfrog for geological modelling and Datamine for grade estimation and reporting. 

The resource evaluation methodology for preparation of the Mineral Resource statement was as 
follows: 

• Database verification; 
• Construction of niobium mineralization wireframe models; 
• Definition of resource domains; 
• Preparing of data for geostatistical analysis and variography (capping and compositing); 
• Block modelling and grade interpolation; 
• Resource classification and validation; 
• Assessment of "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" and selection of appropriate 

CoG; and 
• Preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement. 

The effective date of the resource statement is September 9, 2014. 

14.2 Drillhole Database 
The drillhole database was constructed by Dahrouge from Molycorp data and raw data captured by 
Dahrouge during the 2011 and 2014, Quantum and NioCorp drilling programs. The information has 
been exported from the Central Database and provided to SRK in .csv format. SRK determined the 
data to be of good quality. The database provided in Microsoft Excel® .csv spreadsheets containing 
collar locations surveyed in UTM coordinates, downhole deviation surveys, assay intervals with 
elemental analyses, geologic intervals with rock types, alteration and key structures. SRK has 
assigned appropriate codes for missing samples and no recovery for use during the modeling 
procedures. 

The complete database which covers the entire NioCorp concession area contains information from 
116 diamond-core drillholes totaling approximately 59,433 m of drilling. There are no obvious gaps in

the naming sequence of drillholes. The maximum drillhole depth is 908.6 m and the average is 483.2 
m. Focusing on the Elk Creek Nb Project a total of 34 holes have been completed (inclusive of one 
wedged hole) for a total of 21,762.5 m of drilling. In addition to these holes which have complete 
geological logs and returned assays. A collar plot of the Deposit by drilling phase (Company) is 
shown in Table 14.2.1.

14.3 Geologic Model 
The drill log lithology data contains four major rock types based on the geologic observations of drill 
core, which based on the latest logging codes can be broken down into 19 sub-lithologies. The four 
main units considered during the analysis are: 

• Overburden; 
• Sediments; 
• Carbonatite; and 
• Mafic Units/Lamprophyre. 

The primary logging codes have been imported into Leapfrog to create geological horizons for the 
base of overburden/till, plus the contact between the Pennsylvanian Sediments and the underlying 
Carbonatite (Figure 14.3.1). The models have been used by creating contact points within each 
drillhole at the contact between these major units.

Figure 14.3.1: 3D View of Elk Creek Deposit Showing Modelled Base of Till and Unconformity 
between Pennsylvanian Sediments and the Elk Creek Carbonatite 

 

As stated in Section 12.2 of this Technical Report SRK does not consider the detail in the geological 
log to be sufficient to enable modelling of the geological units to a high degree of confidence due a 
mixed population of higher grade magnetite-dolomite-carbonatite (mdolCarb), and lower grade 
dolomite-carbonatite (dolCarb).  

SRK has completed a statistical analysis of the Nb2O5% grades per lithology using classical 
statistical methods. The database was then analyzed for relative abundance and Nb2O5 based on 
the sub-lithologies as shown in Figure 14.3.2. The box-whisker plot highlights the significant 
difference in the grade distributions between mdolCarb (pink square) and dolCarb (blue square). The 
mdolCarb and mdolCarbBc account for 1,972 of the samples logged versus 1,898 dolCarb and 
dolCarbBc records, from a total of 4,931 overall records, which indicates these four codes cover 
78.5% of the logged intervals. The mdolCarb and mdolCarb have grades in excess of 0.3% Nb2O5 
for over 75% of the data populations. In comparison the dolCarb has 75% of the database below a 
nominal cut-off of 0.3% Nb2O5. The results confirm the importance of accurate geological logging 
and the requirement to revisit the data capture/logging of the historical drilling confirm the 
assumptions proposed. Currently the NioCorp database accounts for approximately 24% of the total 
meters drilled within the Elk Creek deposit.  

In addition to the lower grades in the dolCarb units, SRK also noted lower grades within the mafic 
units. Within the Molycorp database all early or late stage intrusives not defined as dolCarb have 
been assigned a mafic rock code. The NioCorp database shows a split between units logged as 
Mafic (considered to be late stage) which in general are low grade to barren, compared to

SRK considers the presence of potentially late stage low/barren mafic units to be important. To be 
able to understand the distribution of Nb2O5 within the dolCarb and mdolCarb units SRK has first 
modelled the mafic units (Figure 14.3.3). To complete the model SRK has primarily used the 
lithology logging but has also used for guidance areas of low-grade to Nb2O5, when intersecting 
Molycorp drillholes. Leapfrog was used to model the hangingwall and footwall points for a total of 6 
units. The orientation of these units has been compared to acoustic teleview (ATV) data to confirm 
orientation of structures.  

The resultant geological features have been imported into Datamine with the associated boreholes 
coded by the relevant geological units. The coding allows these units to be filtered from the 
geological modelling of the Carbonatite units.  

Given the lack of confidence in the historical lithological logs SRK has elected to rely more on the 
Nb2O5 % grade information and utilize Leapfrog grade shells to define the limits of Mineralization at 
Elk Creek. Further work currently in progress will review additional elements to increase the 
confidence in assigning rocktypes based on grade estimates, where historical core has not been 
reviewed. To complete the analysis the coded Datamine drillholes have been composited to a default 
of 3 m, 6 m and 12 m, with no minimum composite length and all geological contact honored. The 
concept in compositing the data is to remove any localized variations from the grade shells caused

SRK has tested multiple scenario's based on the raw and filtered composite data to mimic the 
changes in niobium distributions between the dolCarb and mdolCarb beneath the unconformity. 
Using log histograms and log-probability plot SRK has determined that more than one sample 
population maybe present (Figure 14.3.4), which can be described as low-grade population ranging 
between 0.1% and 0.5% Nb2O5, and a higher-grade population in excess of 0.5% Nb2O5. The 
contact between the two populations is not clear on the charts and therefore SRK assumed some 
degree of transition between these two domains may exist. SRK has assumed that the lower grade 
population is defined by the dolCarb units, with the higher grades indicating the presence of 
mdolCarb.

Figure 14.3.4: Statistical Analysis of Raw Nb2O5% Values within Elk Creek Carbonatite 

 

Using the above and the assumption of a nominal lower grade cut-off of 0.3% Nb2O5, SRK has 
created grade shells at 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5% Nb2O5. SRK found visually the best fits (in terms of 
correlation of grade and known higher-grade geological units), when using the 12 m composite data. 
At the shorter intervals, areas comprising of less than six continuous meters of low grade were 
producing isolates holes in the geological wireframes. SRK preferred the option to model larger more 
consistent wireframes, and are instead accounted for as internal dilution of lower-grade samples 
within the estimated blocks. 

To evaluate the preferred interpretation for the grade shells boundaries, SRK has been provided with 
two cross-sections and one long section by onsite geological staff (Dahrouge). The sections have 
been based on the detailed geological logging codes covering the central core of the deposit, which 
was the focus of the Phase 1 drilling program.

Figure 14.3.5: Cross-section through NioCorp Drilling Showing Leapfrog Model versus 
Geological Interpretation 

 

To improve the continuity between the geological interpretation and the selected model SRK has 
used two dominant trend surfaces to create the final geological models. The southwest contact has 
been modelled using a strong sub-vertical trend, while the northeast of the deposit has followed 
shallower dipping trends noted between lower grades, and parallel to the mafic units. 

In Figure 14.3.5 the Leapfrog model shows a series of trend lines colored black for the shallow 
dipping structures and brown for the steeper dipping structures which define the southwestern edge 
of the deposit.

14.4 Assay Capping and Compositing 
Prior to the undertaking of a statistical analysis, an outlier analysis has first been completed and 
samples need to be composited to equal lengths for constant sample volume, in order to honour 
sample support theories. 

14.4.1 Outliers 
The raw assay data was first plotted on histogram (Figure 14.4.1.1) and cumulative distribution plots 
(Figure 14.4.1.2) to understand its basic statistical distribution. High-grade capping was applied 
based on a combination of these plots, plus log histogram information. To create the plots the 
domained samples for all zones have been created in Datamine and imported into Snowden 
Supervisor v8.3 (Supervisor) for analysis.  

The plots can be used to distinguish the grades at which additional samples have significant impacts 
on the local estimation and whose affect is considered extreme. Using this methodology top-cuts 
have been defined for each domain by reviewing the information from the different sample types.  

The spatial occurrence of the capped values visually verified to determine if they formed discrete 
zones which could potentially be modelled separately. Based on the analysis SRK has decided to 
apply a grade capping of 2.5% Nb2O5. For the mafic zones (mafic and Lamprophyre units) a cap of 
1.0% Nb2O5% has been applied for the statistical analysis (Figure 14.4.1.1).

number of samples capped and the mean grades within each estimation domain. Figure 14.4.1.2 
provides an example of the study which reviews the number of samples capped within the 0.5% 
grade shell. The results show that approximately 0.62% of the database has been capped, with the

Figure 14.4.1.2: Capping Sensitivity Analysis on Nb2O5% Grades within 0.5% Grade Shell 

 

14.4.2 Compositing 
SRK has undertaken a sample composite analysis (Table 14.4.2.1) in order to determine the optimal 
sample composite length for grade interpolation. The analysis investigated both changes in 
composite length and minimum composite lengths for inclusion. Results are compared by reviewing 
the resultant mean grade against the length weighted raw sample mean grades, and the percentage 
of samples excluded applying the minimum composite length.  

SRK has utilized a function in Datamine where all samples are maintained during the composite 
routine (MODE=1). MODE 1 forces all samples to be included in one of the composites by adjusting 
the composite length, while keeping it as close as possible to the 6 m interval selected by SRK. The 
maximum possible composite length will then be 9 m. A review of the composite lengths per domain 
shows on average the mean length of the composite within the Carbonatite is in the order of 
5.5 to 6.0 m, while the thinner mafic units average closer to 5 m. A comparison of the mean grades 
Nb2O5% grades shows the impact of the composite and capping routines results in slightly lower 
means at <0.4% in the Carbonatite. The reduction in mafic units reports larger differences of up to 
15% but this is typically due to the low numbers in the samples populations. SRK assumes the 
differences in the mafics can be explained by differences in the logging of Molycorp drilling, while this 
may have a degree of conservatism, the overall of the tonnage of the mafic units is low in 
comparison to the Carbonatite. SRK deemed the capping satisfactory, and no bias has been 
introduced during the capping and composite processes.

14.5 Density 
Dahrouge conducted density testing on the drill core to support the resource estimation. Density 
testwork has been completed using a combination volumetric density determination and water 
immersion for confirmation. Approximately 656 samples were tested from the 2014 drilling program 
and over 253 samples from the 2011 program. The density data was subdivided by the four major 
lithologic groups used in the geologic model, and averages were calculated for each group.  

The results are presented in Table 14.5.1. Density was assigned in the block model based on each 
block's lithology. Blocks outside of the resource estimation with unclassified lithology, were assigned 
a density of 2.7 g/cm3, the average value for all the measurements taken.

14.6 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 
Variography is the study of the spatial variability of an attribute (in this case Nb2O5%). Datamine and 
Supervisor have been utilized to test the geostatistical relationship for the deposit. Variogram 
analysis was performed on the capped and composited data filtered to include only the carbonatite 
domain. No stable semi-variograms have been able to be achieved within the mafic units.  

In completing the analysis the following has been considered:  

• Azimuth and dip of each zone was determined;  
• The down-hole variogram was calculated and modelled to characterize the nugget effect;

• Experimental raw and pairwise relative semi-variograms, were calculated to determine 
directional variograms for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions; 

• Directional variograms were modelled using the nugget and sill defined in the down-hole 
variography, and the ranges for the along strike, cross strike and down-dip directions; and 

• All variances were re-scaled for each domain to match the total variance for that zone 

A double spherical structures were used to model the variogram. A lag of 25 m was used with a 
variable separation based on the extents of the data. The semivariogram parameters are presented 
in Table 14.6.1. The experimental semi-variogram data is shown in Figure 14.6.1 fit with the model 
semi-variogram parameters listed in Table 14.6.1. The results indicate a reasonable nugget 
variance, but then a significant portion of the variability is within a short range (first sill) of between 
7 – 20 m. SRK attributes this short scale variability to changes in the geological units between 
mdolcarb and dolcarb, improving the geological model and hence domaining may improve the 
results during the next Mineral Resource update.

14.7 Block Model 
The block model was constructed within the UTM grid (NADS83 Zone 14) coordinate limits listed in 
Table 14.7.1. A 5 m x 15 m x 5 m (x, y, z) block size was chosen as an appropriate dimension based 
on the current drillhole spacing and a potential underground smallest mining unit (SMU), compared 
to a drill spacing in the order of 60 m x 60 m within infill drilled sections. The topographic surface was 
created from the elevation coordinates of the drill collars and from the digitized 30 m resolution 
contours of a topographic map. 

All modelling was conducted in Datamine for Elk Creek grade estimation. The top of carbonatite 
surface located approximately 200 m below surface has been modelled in Leapfrog with all grade 
estimates cropped to this contact.  

To improve the geometric representation of the deposit a rotated block model was created using a 
strike of 120º (set to -60º using Datamine convention), a relatively small prototype using a 5 m x 
15 m x 5 m parent block has been created with sub-blocking allowed along the boundaries to a 
minimum of 0.5 m along strike, 2.5 m across strike and 1.0 m in the vertical direction. SRK has 
maintained the 5 m block size across strike as used in the geological model to ensure the vertical

14.8 Estimation Methodology 
The grade estimation has been completed using hard boundaries for the lithological (mafic) and 
mineralization (carbonatite grade shell) domains. Only the composites from the same domain have 
been used during estimation. This boundary corresponds to the geologic model presented in Section 
14.3. The block model was first coded so that all blocks within this solid were flagged the relevant 
estimation domain (KZONE).  

The Nb2O5% grade estimation utilized an OK algorithm supported by the 6.0 m sample composites 
for the Carbonatite units, and IDW to a Power of 2 for the mafic units (mafic and lamprophyre). A 
nested search method consisting of three passes was used. The search ellipse has been rotated into 
the main dip and strike orientation of the deposit (Table 14.8.1) 

Table 14.8.1: Ellipsoid Orientations 

Domains Rotation Angle 1 Axis of Rotation Rotation Angle 1 Axis of Rotation 
Carbonatite & Mafic Units 30 Z-Axis 30 X-Axis 

Source: SRK, 2014 

 

In the first search passes for the Carbonatite, the estimation required a minimum of six and a 
maximum of 24 composites to assign grade to each block. A lower maximum number of 15 
composites has been used in the mafics to account for the lower sample density. For the second 
pass, a minimum of four and a maximum of 16 composites were required to assign grade. In the 
third pass the minimum number of samples has been reduced to one sample and a maximum of 20 
samples allows. A maximum of four composites from a single drillhole were allowed for all passes, 
thus at least two drillholes were used for the first search pass. No blocks estimated in subsequent 
passes were allowed to overwrite the prior passes of estimation. No octant search restriction was 
applied due to the configuration of the drillhole spacing.  

Due to observed variations in the dip of the carbonatite and mafic units the search ranges have been 
rotated to best fit the semi-variogram orientation and the geological model (Figure 14.8.1). The 
search ranges are based on the results of the variography as well as the average drillhole spacing.

The number of composites and drillholes used to estimate each block were stored during the 
estimation. Each pass of estimation was also recorded to show which blocks were estimated in 
which pass. The results show that an average of eight composites (using at least two holes) are 
used within the first two passes, which represents 73% of the number of blocks estimate. A detailed 
breakdown of the estimation parameters for the Carbonatite in each pass is shown in Table 14.8.2.

14.9 Model Validation 
SRK has undertaken a thorough validation of the resultant interpolated model in order to confirm the 
estimation parameters, to check that the model represents the input data on both local and global 
scales and to check that the estimate is not biased. SRK has undertaken this using a using a number 
of different validation techniques. 

• Inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole grades; 
• Comparative Statistical study versus composite data and alternative estimation methods; 

and 
• Sectional interpretation of the mean block and sample grades (Swath Plots).

14.9.1 Visual Comparison 

Visual validation provides a local validation of the interpolated block model on a local block scale, 
using visual assessments and validation plots of sample grades verses estimated block grades. A 
thorough visual inspection of cross-sections, long-sections and bench/level plans, comparing the 
sample grades with the block grades has been undertaken, which demonstrates good comparison 
between local block estimates and nearby samples, without excessive smoothing in the block model. 
Figure 14.9.1.1 shows an example cross-section of the visual validation checks and highlights the 
overall block grades corresponding with raw samples grades. Additional cross-sections showing the 
block estimates versus the composite grades are shown in Appendix B.

14.9.2 Comparative Statistics 

SRK compared the composite grades to the estimated block grades within the wireframes for each 
domain. The composite grades are presented using the declustered weighting for comparison to the 
block statistics. Declustering was conducted using a cell-declustering algorithm, with cell sizes 
variable depending on the mineralized area. The comparison of the composite assays versus the 
block estimates are shown in Table 14.9.2.1 and Table 14.9.2.2.

The results show acceptable levels of correlation between the mean blocks and declustered means 
for the Carbonatite domains. The 0.4 Nb2O5% and 0.5 Nb2O5% which combined for the majority of the 
metal above cut-off show difference in the mean grades of less than ± 2.5%, which SRK deems 
within acceptable levels. The difference in the mean grades within the 0.3 Nb2O5% grade shell show 
the mean grades of the blocks reports approximately 8.6% lower than the mean sample grades.  

In comparison to the Carbonatite units the differences noted in the mafic units are more significant. 
The mean grades of the block models trends towards lower block grades. SRK attribute the 
differences to two main factors: 

• The data populations within the mafics are skewed and the influence of high grades samples 
statistical mean maybe considered higher; and 

• Influence of lower grade assays at the edge of the deposit which have influence over 
relatively high tonnages for each domain. 

SRK considers the confidence in the mafic units to be lower than the Carbonatite, especially where 
the interpretation has been inferred due to a lack of detail logging captured from the Molycorp 
database.

14.9.3 Swath Plots 
Swath plots were generated, which show the mean grades in the block model as a function of their 
distribution along particular eastings, northings, and elevations.  

The swaths compare the composite grades to the block grades, with the intention of ensuring that 
there are no significant deviations between the two which might mean that some bias exists in one 
part of the deposit. SRK calculated mean grades for composites and blocks within these swaths for 
all domains.  

The resultant plots show a good correlation between the block model grades and the composite 
grades, with the block model showing a typically smoothed profile of the composite grades as 
expected. The plots for Nb2O5% generally confirm no indication of any significant bias introduced 
during the estimation, and generally display an adequate degree of smoothing. Based on the results 
of the analysis SRK have accepted the grades in the block model. 

The swath analysis for the Carbonatite grade shells are shown in Figures 14.9.3.1 to 14.9.3.3.

14.10 Resource Classification 
The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred according to 
CIM guidelines. Due to a lack of dense (<35 x 35 m) drilling no Measured Mineral Resource has 
been assigned at this stage for the Project.  

Classification of the resources reflects the relative confidence of the grade estimates. This 
classification is based on several factors including; sample spacing relative to geological and geo-
statistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources, 
specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations, accuracy of topographic surface, 
quality of the assay data and many other factors, which influence the confidence of the mineral 
estimation. No single factor controls the resource classification rather each factor influences the 
result.  

Generally, most of the factors influencing the resource classification in the Project are positive. The 
resources have been classified as Indicated based primarily on confidence in the geological model 
and sample spacing. 

For the resource classification, a solid shape was constructed around the better-drilled core of the 
deposit where most drillholes are spaced approximately 60 to 70 m apart, and therefore most blocks 
have been estimated with a minimum of two boreholes. The limits of the Indicated Mineral Resource 
have been focused on the areas of the 2014 infill drilling program, where SRK have a high level of 
confidence in the geological logging. Areas exist within the Molycorp logging where the drilling 
density is within 60 to 70 m; however, confidence is lower in the geological model due to 
simplification of the logging codes. Further review of the geological logs of with verification from 
historical core could improve the confidence in these areas limiting the amount of additional drilling 
required. 

All blocks located within this area were classified as Indicated Mineral Resource (Figure 14.10.1). All 
blocks estimated outside of the perimeter of drillholes are classified as Inferred resource. Leapfrog 
has been used to limit the extents of the geological model to within acceptable limits, with the 
0.3 Nb2O5% limits typically only pushing 100 to 150 m beyond the last drilling.

"(A) concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid 
fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on 
the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge". 

Portions of a deposit that do not have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction must 
not be included in a Mineral Resource…" 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the quantity 
and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources are reported 
at an appropriate CoG taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. In order 
to meet this requirement, SRK considers that major portions of the Project are amenable for 
underground extraction. 

The optimization parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against similar 
projects (Table 14.11.1). No detailed technical studies have been completed to date to confirm the 
assumed mining and processing costs, but SRK has used judgment to provide reasonable estimates 
of the expected costs based on the knowledge of the style of mining (underground), and potential 
processing methods. The selected metal recovery is based on the initial metallurgical testwork 
completed during the Phase 1 program discussed in Section 13.3 of this current report. 

Further work will be required to confirm these numbers via a detailed engineering study 
(prefeasibility or feasibility study), once sufficient Indicated material in order to complete such study 
has been realized. 

The reader is cautioned that the results are used solely for the purpose of testing the "reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction" by underground mining methods, and do not represent an 
attempt to estimate mineral reserves. There are no mineral reserves on the Elk Creek Project, and 
further work will be required to establish the costs to a higher level of confidence.  

The results are used as a guide to assist in the preparation of a mineral resource statement and to 
select an appropriate resource reporting CoG.

In order to determine the quantities of material offering "reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction" by an underground mining method, SRK has defined a suitable underground mining CoG 
based on assumed costs, pricing and metallurgical recoveries. Costs and recoveries are based on 
bench mark studies completed of similar projects, and application possible local variations. The 
Mineral Resource has been filtered to show all blocks above the mining cut-off to ensure estimates

form suitable mining targets. Any isolated blocks of material reporting cut-off can be removed as will 
unlikely warrant the cost of development. No such cases existed at Elk Creek and all material within 
the geological wireframes above a cut-off of 0.3 Nb2O5% has been considered to have reasonable 
prospects of being mined via underground methods (Table 14.11.2).

• Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to 

reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate and have been used to derive subtotals, totals and weighted averages. Such 
calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, 
SRK does not consider them to be material. All composites have been capped where appropriate. The Concession is 
wholly owned by and exploration is operated by NioCorp Developments Ltd 

• The reporting standard adopted for the reporting of the MRE uses the terminology, definitions and guidelines given in the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(May 2014) as required by NI 43-101. 

• SRK assumes the Elk Creek deposit to be amenable to a variety of Underground Mining methods. In the absence of 
definitive pricing for Nb and established rates of metallurgical recovery, SRK has reported the Mineral Resource at a cut-
off of 0.3% Nb2O5. The Company's previous Mineral Resource dated April 2012 was calculated at a cut-off of 0.4% 
Nb2O5. 

• SRK Completed a site inspection to the deposit by Mr Martin Pittuck, MSc., C.Eng, MIMMM , an appropriate 
"independent qualified person" as this term is defined in NI 43-101.

14.13 Comparison with Previous Estimate 
In comparison to the 2012 Mineral Resource estimate for the Project, the new estimate represents 
an increase in the Indicated Mineral Resource. The differences in the Mineral Resource can be 
attributed to the following points: 

• Change in the economic cut-off from 0.4 Nb2O5% to 0.3 Nb2O5% for the 2012 and 2014 
estimates respectively; 

• Phase 1 infill drilling has targeted higher grade material at depth in the Mineral Resource; 
• Increase in the geological understanding of the controls on the niobium mineralization and 

grade domaining, based on more detailed logging in the 2014 drilling program; 
• Change in the estimation methodology from Indicator Kriging to Leapfrog grade shells for the 

definition of the mineralization limits; and 
• Changes in the classification procedures used where the 2012 model used a distance from 

sample based method, compared to SRK methods of requiring multiple holes used for a 
single block estimate, with the final limits based on areas with detailed geological logs, 
considered to provide a higher level of confidence in the geological model;  

To provide a like for like comparison of the Indicated Mineral Reources, SRK's 2014 block model 
reported using a CoG of 0.4 Nb2O5% has 22.6 Mt at a grade of 0.70% Nb2O5 which is higgher than 
the 2012 estimate of 19.3 Mt at a grade of 0.67% Nb2O5. This is an increase in the contained 
Nb2O5% from 129,182,000 kg to 157,650,000 kg, or 22% for the Indicated portion of the Mineral 
Resource.  

The Inferred material when compared using a CoG of 0.4 Nb2O5% has increased from 83.3 Mt at a 
grade of 0.63 Nb2O5% to 87.2 Mt at a grade of 0.66 Nb2O5%, which is an increase from 
523,844,000 kg to 573,300,000 kg (+9%) in contained Nb2O5 for the 2012 and 2014 models 
respectively.  

The increase in Inferred material is attributed to extensions to  the mineralization at depth, where the 
deposit remains open in the 2014 model. A summary of the comparisons between CoG grades of 
0.35 to 0.70 Nb2O5% is shown in Table 14.13.1.

17 Recovery Methods  
SRK has not reviewed the recovery method as part of the current study, as metallurgical testwork is 
currently on-going.  

No detailed technical studies have been completed to date to confirm the processing costs. The 
optimization parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against similar 
projects.  

The selected metal recovery is based on the initial metallurgical testwork completed during the 
Phase 1 program. Further testwork may or may not improve this recovery, and the associated costs 
required to achieve this level of recovery are yet to be determined. The reader is cautioned that the 
results are used solely for the purpose of testing the "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" 
by an underground mining methods, and do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions  
NioCorp commenced Phase 1 of a three phase diamond drilling program in May 2014. The focus of 
the Phase 1 program has been to infill two drilling lines within the central portion of the deposit, to 
increase the geological knowledge and infill a portion of the model where the previous drillhole 
spacing was in the order of 200 m.  

25.1 Data Quality and Quantity 
The Phase 1 drilling program was originally designed five holes for a total of 4,202 m, but due to 
technical difficulties on one hole a wedge has been used to ensure target depths have been 
achieved. The total meters drilling (including the wedge portion) during Phase 1 is 4,427 m. The total 
drilling for the Project is 116 diamond core holes for a total of 55,228 m, but only a portion of the 
historical drilling focused on the Elk Creek Nb deposit. Focused over the deposit a total of 34 holes 
(including the wedge) for 21,762.5 m have been drilled at the deposit. All core within the Elk Creek 
Carbonatite have been sampled. In the 2011 and 2014 drilling programs all core has been cut using 
a diamond saw.  

The drilling has been conducted by a reputable contractor using industry standard techniques and 
procedures. This work has confirmed the presence of Niobium hosted with dolomite-carbonatite and 
lamprophyre rocks. 

Downhole deviation surveys were collected once drillholes were complete using a REFLEX GyroTM 
instrument at 6 m intervals. Upon completion of drilling, drillhole collars were surveyed by ESP Inc., a 
subcontractor using high precision equipment. 

Data has been captured into a Central Database for all phases of work. Dahrouge has been 
contracted by the Company during 2011 and 2012 to digitally capture the historical Molycorp 
database, and to conduct verification sampling, and drilling over the Deposit. Dahrouge have been 
responsible for geological logging and sampling, plus general exploration site management. SRK 
has had a constant presence at the exploration program since the commencement of the Phase 1 
program, and has been responsible for geotechnical logging. 

SRK comments that the work has been done to a satisfactory level to provide sufficient confidence in 
the assay database for use in the current Mineral Resource estimate. SRK notes that improvements 
could be made in the level of detail provided in the electronic database for the Molycorp geological 
logging, which has been logged typically as a single unit.  

Work completed during 2014 has shown a close link between logging of mdolCarb (magnetite-
dolomite-carbonatite), with higher Nb2O5% grades. SRK recommends work programs be completed 
to review the historical logs, and analysis of multi-element databases to improve the confidence in 
defining greater levels of detail in the Molycorp database. 

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals, the core was 
handled, logged and sampled in an acceptable manner by professional geologists, and the results 
are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

25.2 Metallurgical Testwork 
In support of this study, characterization of the Elk Creek resource was undertaken at Hazen and 
SGS. The laboratories were provided with drill core samples representative of the resource, and 
have completed testing to define the mineralogy of the resource as well as to separate and recover 
niobium-bearing minerals. The results from both laboratories confirmed a deployment of 
approximately 77% of the niobium occurs as pyrochlore, while the balance occurs in an iron-titanium-
niobium oxide mineral of varying composition. The assumption is that pyrochlore will be more 
amenable to processing via known methods used at other operations, with a degree of optimization 
required to refine the processing flowsheet. Further substantial detailed testing, optimization and 
analysis will be required to define a process flowsheet for the project and to refine the actual 
technical and financial viability of the Project. 

The current work which is based on bench scale testwork provides ranges for niobium flotation 
recovery of between 61% and 84%, with varying degrees of mass pull (9% to 42%). SRK currently 
assumes a recovery of 60% for the basis of the CoG calculation, but further work including additional 
bench scale work and pilot plant testwork will be required to provide a higher level of confidence in 
the overall recovery for the Project.  

SRK comments that the Metallurgical testwork remains currently on-going at the time of reporting 
with more detailed results expected in early 2015.  

25.3 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The sampling methods, QA/QC, and database management practices employed by NioCorp are all 
at or above industry standards and provide a solid basis for the resource estimation. SRK has 
completed and updated Mineral Resource estimate which has been conducted in a manner 
consistent with industry best practices.  

SRK has constructed mineralization models for the deposit, based upon all of the available drilling 
information. Due to a lower level of confidence in the historical geological logging (over simplification 
of geological logging during data capture), modelling has initially been completed in Leapfrog by 
modelling the grade shells at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 Nb2O5% intervals. The use of structural trends has been 
utilized to mimic the geological interpretation. The grade shells have been cross checked versus the 
geological interpretation to select the optimum parameters. 

SRK has undertaken a statistical study of the data, which demonstrates adequate splitting/domaining 
of the deposit. High grade statistical outliers have been controlled in the estimation through grade 
capping. SRK has undertaken a geostatistical study to investigate the niobium grade continuity which 
showed the nugget variance is in the order of 32% a relatively short first range of between 7 - 20m, 
with the maximum range of influence of 80 m along strike and 60 m down-dip. 

SRK has interpolated Nb2O5 grade data using OK into a block model of dimensions 5 m x 15 m x 
5 m (based on an assumed mining unit), using appropriate search and estimation parameters tested 
using for sensitivity to the estimation process. The resultant block model has been fully validated and 
no material bias identified. 

SRK has classified the Mineral Resource in the Indicated (19.4%) and Inferred (80.6%) Mineral 
Resource categories, mainly on the basis of the geological and grade continuity and the relatively 
wide drillhole spacing of up to 60 to 120 m on average.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources – Elk Creek Niobium Project Page 121 
 
 

The Mineral Resource estimate for the deposit, at 0.3 Nb2O5% cut-off, is an Indicated Resource of 
28.2 Mt at 0.63 Nb2O5%; and an Inferred Resource of 132.8 Mt at 0.55 Nb2O5%. The updated 
Mineral Resource represents an Increase of 37% and 40% in the reported contained metal for the 
Indicated and Inferred categories respectively. A comparison at 0.4 Nb2O5% CoG (as used in 2012), 
shows the Increase in the 2014 Mineral Resource estimate is 22% and 9% for the Indicated and 
Inferred portions respectively. The main reasons for the increases are: 

• A reduction in the economic cut-off from 0.4% to 0.3% based on benchmarked (sourced by 
SRK) economic assumptions, and the 2014 metallurgical testwork completed to date; 

• Increases in the Inferred Mineral Resources at depth and along strike from the 2012 Mineral 
Resource due to changes in the methods used to define the limits of the mineralization.  

25.4 Exploration 
Further drilling will be required to either increase the size of the Mineral Resource, or increase the 
confidence in the current estimate (covert Inferred to Indicated). SRK considers there potential to 
increase the current Mineral Resources with some targeted exploration programs in the future. The 
deposit remains open at depth and along strike. SRK comments that in general material intersected 
at depth is higher grade than shallower material. SRK notes that the deeper extension will require 
drilling holes in excess of 1,000 m  

Analysis of the current geological information by SRK and the Company have identified the following 
areas for exploration potential which require further exploration to define additional Mineral 
Resources, these include: 

• Drilling long (>1,000 m) diamond drillholes testing extension of the Mineral Resource at 
depth; and  

• Drilling a series of shallow holes to test for extension to the Mineral Resources closer to the 
contact between the Carbonatite and the Pennsylvanian sediments. Return of positive 
results would then test for further depth extensions. 

25.5 Foreseeable Impacts of Risks 

25.5.1 Surface Rights 
The exploration and surface rights for the project area are due for renewal in 2015 (Q2 2015 for 
lease covering majority of the deposit). NioCorp would need to secure extended lease agreements or 
ownership of these parcels in order to operate the project as it is currently designed.  

SRK understands the Company is currently in the process of renegotiating the exploration leases 
with a priority based on securing the leases over the deposit, and providing a sufficient buffer to 
enable siting of potential infrastructure. During this process an opportunity is available to also 
negotiate the rights to the 32.4 ha (80 acres) lease located to the north of the current project, which 
currently limits the Mineral Resource.  

25.5.2 Metallurgy and Processing 
The proposed recoveries and associated CoG are based upon limited and un-optimized testing and 
several key assumptions will need to be actually confirmed with further investigation and optimized 
testing. This includes, but is not limited to, further bench scale work, hydrometallurgical testwork and

final precipitation of niobium which in turn would facilitate testing of the aluminothermic reduction 
process to produce ferroniobium. Once completed an understanding of the processing costs can be 
achieved.

26 Recommendations  
26.1 Recommended Work Programs and Costs 

SRK recommends that additional drilling be conducted to further investigate and develop the known 
Project. The deposit remains open laterally and at depth, but it is SRK's understanding that the 
Company wishes to take the Project to a decision point as quickly as possible. 

SRK considers there to be sufficient Mineral Resource to focus on advancing the project from 
exploration to an advanced exploration project, and therefore recommends the Company focus on 
increasing the confidence in the current Mineral Resource to a higher level of confidence, in order to 
complete a detailed technical study (prefeasibility, feasibility). SRK has been working with the 
Company to defined the requirements to complete this drilling, which is the focus of the Phase 2 and 
3 drilling programs. 

The current proposed drilling requirements for Phase 2 and Phase 3 are shown in Table 26.1.1.

SRK recommends the Company update the geological model at the end of Phase 2 and to then 
evaluate the requirements of the Phase 3 program. At which point the program can be optimized to 
maximize the conversion of Inferred to Indicated material. Upon completion of Phase 3 SRK 
recommends the Company commence a technical study of the Project. 

In addition to the recommended drilling program SRK recommends that the historical Molycorp 
database is reviewed for the 25 drillholes centered over the current Mineral Resource. The focus of 
the review should be to define any low-grade mafic units not included in the current data capture, 
and to identify where possible difference maybe between dolCarb (currently logged) and mdolCarb, 
which represents higher grade material. The result of this analysis will allow for more detailed 
geological models and improved domaining in any future updates. 

SRK also comments at this stage that the other technical studies need to be advanced for more 
detailed technical studies, such as: 

• Metallurgical testwork and Pilot plant testwork; 
• Geotechnical analysis; 
• Hydrogeological and hydrological studies; 
• Environmental assessment and permitting requirements; and 
• Infrastructure design. 

Data collection for each of these studies has commenced, with the Company in the process of 
drilling a total of three vertical PQ diamond drillholes for collection of samples for metallurgical 
testing. At the time of writing with the finalization of field programs for all areas is anticipated at the 
end of Phase 2 or 3 of the drilling proposed. 

26.1.1 Costs 
Estimated costs for the Engineering Studies and Exploration Program as proposed by SRK are 
illustrated in Table 26.1.1.1. SRK considers the proposed budget below will be sufficient to define the 
Project to a feasibility level of study.

28 Glossary 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" (May 10, 2014). Accordingly, the 
Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves have been 
classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as defined 
below.  

28.1 Mineral Resources 
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on 
the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological 
characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence 
is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred Mineral 
Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and 
must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred 
Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow 
the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and 
reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality 
continuity between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a 
Probable Mineral Reserve. 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to 
allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of 
the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality 
continuity between points of observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of 
confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral 
Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 

28.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the 
material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at prefeasibility or feasibility level as 
appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time 
of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.

The reference point at which Mineral Reserves are defined, usually the point where the ore is 
delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the 
reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to 
ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported. The public disclosure of a 
Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a prefeasibility study or feasibility study. 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a 
Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A 
Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.
