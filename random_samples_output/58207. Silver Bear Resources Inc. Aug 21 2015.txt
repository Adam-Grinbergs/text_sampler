1.2 GEOLOGY AND MINERALISATION 

1.2.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Property is located within the Verkhoyansk mobile belt of north eastern Yakutia.  

The fold-and-thrust belt forms part of a major orogenic system separating the 

Siberian North Asian Craton to the west from the immense expanse of accreted

terranes that form most of Far East Russia.  The belt extends for 2,000 km from the 

Laptev Sea to the Sea of Okhotsk (Figure 1.2).  It is comprised of a greater than 7-km 

thick sequence of Late Precambrian to Triassic rocks deposited along the Palaeo-

Pacific margin of the Siberian Craton, which developed because of rifting events 

during the Late Precambrian period and again during the Late Devonian to Early 

Mississippian periods. 

Deformation during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous occurred with low-grade 

metamorphism in the internal parts of the belt and the emplacement of high-level 

granitic bodies.  Strike-slip faulting occurred during the Tertiary period. 

The central part of the belt is dominantly comprised of a thick, monotonous 

succession of Carboniferous and Permian turbidites that are metamorphosed to 

lower-greenschist facies.  Granodiorite and granite plutons have intruded the core of 

the belt and are associated with extensive gold-bearing quartz vein systems.

1.2.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The mineral occurrences on the Property are located in the interfluve of the 

Nuektame and Arkachan rivers and ranges from the mid-channel of the Muhalkan 

River to the mouth of the Mysovoi Stream.  The mineral deposits are confined to the 

eastern wing of the Kuranakhsky anticlinorium and are situated within the contours 

of the Endybal anticline. 

Higher order asymmetric anticlinal and synclinal folds that are 2 to 20 km in length 

complicate the hinge portion of the Endybal anticline.  The Mukhalkansky anticline 

with a north-northwest strike (340°) and the Mangazeisky syncline, which are 

adjacent on the western side, complicate the eastern wing of the Endybal anticline.  

The dip of the rocks of the Endybal anticline in the area of the Mangazeisky deposits 

averages 20 to 45°. 

Two north-south zones of faulting are distinguished.  The most important is the 

Nuektaminsky shear zone which limits the expansion of mineralisation to the east. 

The movement along the Nuektaminsky fault is left-lateral.  The next is the Granichny 

shear zone with right-lateral movement.  The Granichny fault is a splay off the 

Nuektaminsky fault and together they form a V-shape, which represents a zone of 

tension.  The Granichny shear zone hosts two vertical deposits (Semenovsky and 

Granichny) that cross-cut the stratigraphy. 

The silver mineralisation is epigenetic.  This is particularly clear at the Nizhny Endybal 

deposit, where the mineralised strata-bound zones exhibit structural deformation.  

The strata-bound veins and cross-cutting fracture systems in the region are 

associated with shearing.  This is reflected in the common occurrence of parallel 

layers of slip planes along the boundaries of the sandstone beds and selvages of 

strata-bound veins, such as Mikhailovsky, Olgina, Vasilievsky and Anglesite-Cerussite.  

The structural analysis of joints in the mineralised rocks shows the ubiquitous 

existence of overthrusting dislocations (Kostin et. al.1997). 

The Endybal diatreme and quartz porphyry dykes postdate the overthrust event.  The 

geological studies by Yangeologia and by A.V. Kostin et al. have led to the following 

conclusions regarding the sequence of events:  

1. mineralised layers of sandstone containing sulphide mineralisation 

2. structural deformation 

3. Endybal diatreme. 

1.2.3 MINERALISATION 

This region of Yakutia is known to contain many silver deposits; Figure 1.3 illustrates 

the position of the Property in relation to a number of the known silver projects in the 

region.

The Property contains several explored areas that host more than 100 occurrences of 

mineralisation.  The mineral occurrences are concentrated within a 35-km long 

corridor (Figure 1.4).

The Property hosts at least four different types of mineralisation: 

 Strata-bound silver-bearing, quartz-carbonate-sulphide structures with 

average grades greater than 900 g/t silver, with lead and zinc by-products.  

These silver bearing structures were mapped and sampled over an area of 

65 km2.  Examples of this are the Vasilievsky—Anglesite-Cerussite and 

Olgina—Mikhailovsky veins within the Mangazeisky North Zone. 

 Thicker linear-type stockwork areas with carbonate-silver sulphosalt 

mineralisation.  Examples of this occur in the Strezhevoy and Nizhny Endybal 

Zones. 

 Narrow, steep dipping veins such as Vertikalny that cross-cut stratigraphy 

and feature grades in excess of 1,000 g/t silver over widths ranging from 

several centimetres to several metres.  Vertikalny and possibly Zabytoe and 

Kis-Kuel are examples of this style of mineralisation. 

 A porphyry area associated with quartz, quartz-carbonate and quartz-

sulphide veins and veinlets, hosted by extrusive rhyolite porphyry.  Porfirovy 

is an example of this. 

1.3 EXPLORATION  

Table 1.4 provides a summary of the exploration completed since 2007. 

Early exploration was focused upon the narrow, strata-bound silver mineralisation of 

the Vasilievsky and Mikhailovsky targets, with more of a focus on Vertikalny from 

2007 onwards.  Latterly, the exploration has incorporated the evaluation of the 

Sterzhnevoy, Nizhny Endybal and Mangazeisky North deposits.

Tetra Tech is of the opinion that the exploration has generally been conducted using 

methods and procedures that are consistent with recognised industry best practices. 

However, the trench sampling has not been included in the grade interpolation due to 

statistically significant bias that is noted when comparing the trenches with nearby 

drillholes.  

The bias may be due to natural mechanical enrichment at surface, or may have been 

introduced as a result of the manual channelling methods used to sample the 

trenches.  The trenching also lacked QA/QC samples, which prevented full data 

verification to be undertaken. 

Tetra Tech recommends further work to resample the trenches using a rock saw to 

cut a sample, where appropriate and a full QA/QC programme. 

1.4 DRILLING 

Details about the drilling campaigns completed prior to 2010 have been disclosed 

fully in the 2011 preliminary economic assessment (PEA) (Tetra Tech 2011).  The 

2011 to 2012 drilling campaigns have been disclosed fully in the 2013 Technical 

Report (Tetra Tech 2013).  Both reports are filed under Silver Bear's profile on the 

Canadian Security Administrators' System for Electronic Document Analysis and 

Retrieval (SEDAR).  Table 1.5 provides a summary of the drilling completed between 

2004 and 2014.  The 2013 to 2014 drilling campaigns are described fully in Section 

10.0.

methods and procedures that are consistent with recognised industry practices and 

that the data is adequate for resource estimation. 

1.5 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

Tetra Tech completed a maiden resource estimate for the Mangazeisky North 

deposits, with an effective date of 3 June 2015.  The mineral resources have been

estimated by Mr. Robert Davies, B.Sc., EurGeol, CGeol, and is the independent QP as 

defined by NI 43-101. 

This section also presents a restatement of the mineral resource for the Nizhny 

Endybal and Vertikalny deposits.  The effective date of the Vertikalny Central and 

Northwest Resource is 10 February 2015 and the effective date of the Nizhny 

Endybal Resource is 11 September 2012.  Mr. P. Gribble, FIMMM, C.Eng, former 

Senior Geologist at Tetra Tech is the independent QP who originally prepared the 

Nizhny Endybal Mineral Resource.  Mr. Davies is the independent QP who estimated 

the Vertikalny resources and has reviewed and verified the Nizhny Endybal Mineral 

Resource as current.  The Nizhny Endybal Resource has been re-stated using current 

cut-off grade assumptions to be consistent with the Mangazeisky North deposits.  

Further details of the Nizhny Endybal and Vertikalny Mineral Resources, estimated by 

Tetra Tech in 2012 and 2015, are publicly available and filed under the Silver Bear 

profile on the Canadian Security Administrators' SEDAR website.

Notes: Vertikalny deposits have a higher cut-off grade as they are assumed to be worked 

 predominantly via underground mining methods. 

1.5.1 SUMMARY OF ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES 

Tetra Tech created mineralisation and oxidation wireframes using GEOVIA Surpac™ 

software (version 6.6.2) (Surpac).  The wireframes were based upon sectional 

interpretations using both logging observations and grade intersections.  Block 

modelling and variography was also completed in Surpac. 

The silver grades were estimated using an ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation 

methodology.  The density was applied to the blocks based upon a mean value from 

17 density measurements. 

Statistical and grade continuity analyses were completed in order to characterise the 

mineralisation, and were subsequently used to develop grade interpolation 

parameters.  .  The search ellipsoid dimensions and orientations were chosen to 

reflect the continuity revealed by geostatistical studies.  Block size, discretisation,

search size, and sample numbers were optimised using quantitative kriging 

neighbourhood analysis (QKNA). 

Tetra Tech adopted the definition of mineral resources as outlined within the 

Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards on 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM 2010) in order to classify the 

resources. 

In order to demonstrate that the deposit has reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction, a cut-off grade of 150 g/t was applied for the Mangazeisky North and 

Nizhny Endybal deposits, based upon the following assumptions: 

 spot metal prices, effective 13 May 2015, of US$17/troy oz silver 

 mining cost of US$3.16/t 

 processing cost of US$50/t 

 general and administrative costs of US$12.50/t 

 transport costs, from pit to process plant, of $3.60/t 

 overall silver recovery of 85%. 

1.6 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Tetra Tech has reviewed and audited all the exploration data for the Mangazeisky 

North deposit, and is of the opinion that the exploration work carried out by Silver 

Bear has generally been completed using procedures that are consistent with 

recognised industry best practices, and the data is suitable for resource estimation. 

The 2014 drilling campaign completed on the Mangazeisky North deposits provided 

sufficient data to allow the grade to be estimated, and to reasonably assume, but not 

verify, geological and grade continuity.  

In Tetra Tech's opinion, the established understanding of the geological and grade 

continuity is sufficient to support the classification of the mineral resources as 

Inferred, as presented in this report. Tetra Tech is not aware of any material risks 

associated with the Project.  As part of the feasibility study currently underway, 

detailed technical matters are being investigated and mitigated.  The feasibility study 

is anticipated to be completed in Q4 2015. 

1.7 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Tetra Tech recommends the following two phases of work at Mangazeisky North: 

 Phase 1 – infill drilling programme  

 Phase 2 – preliminary metallurgical test work. 

The infill drilling programme is needed to further develop both grade and geological 

continuity of the deposits.  The metallurgical test work will further the understanding 

of the mineralisation, supporting the future conversion from resource to reserve.

Mangazeisky Silver Project, Mangazeisky North Deposits, 

Yakutia, Russia 

  

 

Advancing to Phase 2 is not contingent on the results of Phase 1. 

1.7.1 PHASE 1 - INFILL DRILLING PROGRAMME 

Infill drilling should be considered initially to better understand, and further develop, 

the close range variability in the grade distribution.  It is anticipated that this work will 

sufficiently increase the geological confidence to allow the resource classification to 

be improved.  Once the resource is classified as Indicated or better, reserve 

estimates can be undertaken, allowing the potential revenues from the deposit to be 

included in the financial analysis of the Project. 

Infill drilling may close some of the gaps between existing pierce points and join 

isolated mineralisation.  This has the potential to add additional resources by 

targeting holes in line with the current grade distribution. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Tetra Tech recommends a proposed drilling campaign of approximately 2,400 m of 

drilling at Mangazeisky North.  This campaign consists primarily of infill drilling, with 

some limited additional strike and depth exploration.  The recommended programme 

targets gaps in the current resource and has the potential to significantly add to the 

understanding of the deposit, and to add to the resource base. 

Figure 1.5, shows the proposed locations of infill drillholes targeting areas of poor 

interpolation.  The figure presents the Mangazeisky North deposit highlighting the 

body by Kriging Efficiency.  Preference for the proposed drillholes is given to those 

areas which are currently understood to be of higher grade, based on the existing 

drilling results.

It is recommended that approximately 20% of the dill core samples associated with 

the infill drilling campaign are subjected to density measurements.  These 

measurements should be undertaken for examples of all lithologies and a range of 

silver grades, including barren host rock.  Density measurements for host rock could 

become important as the deposit is advanced into reserve estimation and mine 

planning. 

1.7.2 PHASE 2 - METALLURGICAL TEST WORK 

Tetra Tech recommends that preliminary metallurgical work is undertaken to 

characterize and further the understanding of the mineralisation at Mangazeisky 

North.  This test work would aim to provide a first pass indication of the 

mineralisation's amenability to cyanide leaching, as well as a qualitative indication of 

oxidation state, which in turn will inform future test work and allow a comparison with 

the Vertikalny deposit's metallurgical behaviour. 

METALLURGICAL TEST WORK SAMPLE SELECTION PROCESS 

Silver Bear has already initiated the following programme of work.  It is anticipated 

that the programme will be completed within Q4 of 2015. 

Tetra Tech selected fourteen samples within the zone of mineralisation described by 

the Tetra Tech wire frame model.  Trenches were excluded from the selection on the 

basis that they were currently not reliable for mineral resource estimation. 

Only samples in a silver head grade range from 300 to 1,800 ppm silver were 

considered. 

The final selection of fourteen samples was made on a random interval basis, 

ensuring that all relevant lithology and oxide states were represented by at least one 

sample.  Care was taken to not over-represent minor lithological groups or oxide 

states. 

The final sample selection is shown in Table 1.7.  Tetra Tech recommends that Silver 

Bear uses coarse rejects generated during sample preparation for the geological 

assays as a source of material. 

Once the selection was made, the samples spatial distribution was assessed by 

recording the sample selection back to the drilling database, and visualising the 

results in mining software.  The result is a good representation along strike and 

reasonable representation along the depth considering that the deposit is primarily a 

single main structure with depth limited by drilling.

4.3 HISTORY OF PROPERTY ACQUISITION 

On 21 October 2004, Silver Bear completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding 

shares of Prognoz.  Pursuant to the transaction, Silver Bear acquired 100% of the 

issued and outstanding common shares of Prognoz for RUB 10,000,000 or 

Cdn$331,000 and assumed certain bank indebtedness and other liabilities of 

Prognoz.  The parties to the transaction agreed that the value of the exploration 

licences held by Prognoz closely approximated the indebtedness assumed and 

accordingly, a value of RUB 20,585,221 or Cdn$890,310 was attributed to the 

licences.  Tetra Tech is not aware of any liability in the form of royalties or other 

financial encumbrances, but these may be applicable. 

The exploration licence YaKU 12692 BP was granted to Prognoz on 24 September 

2004, by the ROSNEDRA, and was valid for an initial term of five years.  On 18 

February 2009, the exploration licence was extended by ROSNEDRA to 31 December 

2011.  Another extension was subsequently granted for one year until 31 December 

2012.  On 27 December 2012, a third extension was granted for four years until 31 

December 2016. 

The licences give the recipient the right to use the subsoil for the purposes of 

geological investigation within the licence area, for exploration and appraisal of the 

gold and silver deposits.  The licence area has the status of a "geological allotment"

with the preliminary borders outlined and an unlimited licenced depth for 

investigation.  According to the English translations of the exploration licences, there 

are no specially protected natural territories within the limits of the licence. 

In September 2013, Silver Bear received its mining licence YaKU 03626 BE for the 

Vertikalny deposit.  The term of the licence is approximately 20 years (to 2033).  The 

licence requirements include: 

 completion of 15,000 m of drilling and 15,000 m3 of trenching by or before 

December 2017. 

 initiation of drilling and trenching no later than March 2015 

 mine must be operational within the next nine years (2023), inclusive of 

permitting and report approvals 

 mine output must be greater than180,000 t/a by the year 2023.

5.0  ACCESSIB IL ITY ,  CL IMA TE,  
INFRASTRUCTURE,  LOCA L RESOURCES  
AND  P HYSIOG RAP HY  

The Property is located in the Kobyask district within the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) 

of the Russian Federation.  Yakutia covers an area of 3.1 Mkm2, makes up one fifth 

of Russia's landmass, and has a population of approximately 1.0 million people.  The 

region is rich in natural resources and 80% of its industrial production originates from 

the mining and oil industries, including diamonds, gold, tin antimony and fossil fuels 

(coal, gas and oil).  Over 10% of the available work force of 0.5 million people are 

involved in mining. 

The major population centre for the region of Yakutsk has circa 300,000 inhabitants.  

Yakutsk is located approximately 400 km south of the Property. 

Yakutia recognises the present and long-term predicted demand for mineral 

resources in the region, and is implementing a strategic plan for the social and 

economic development of the region ("Scheme of Complex Development of 

Productive Forces, Transport and Power Industry of the Sakha Republic [Yakutia] by 

2020"), which is supported by the Russian Federation Government.  It is hoped that 

the Project will create new transportation corridors; increase export opportunities; 

and create employment and subsequent population inflow, as well as increase 

national security and assist integration with the Asia-Pacific regions.  The majority of 

the infrastructure improvements will not have a direct impact on the Project, 

especially in its early stages.  Opening of supply lines etc. will have a positive impact 

in terms of supply of consumables and labour. 

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

The Property is only accessible from Yakutsk by air, either by fixed wing aircraft or by 

helicopter.  There is an airstrip on the Property, at the confluence of the Endybal and 

Arkachan Rivers, approximately 10 km from the base camp.  There are several 

charter companies based in and around Yakutsk for both types of aircraft.  A flight by 

Antonov AN-2 is typically two hours. 

The Property may also be accessed via Batagai, located approximately 300 km 

northeast of the Property.  There are regular scheduled flights to Batagai as well as 

aircraft available for charter. 

There is also a winter road that is open for several months during the winter for 

transport of all freight and supplies to the Property.

5.2 CLIMATE 

The climate of northeast Russia is Continental subarctic to Tundra Climate zones (Dfd 

to ET; Köppen climate classification), and is characterised extreme cold dry winters 

and cool summer seasons.  There is no climatic station at the Project site, but data is 

available from Verhojansk (NOAA Station ID RA24266; 67°33'N, 133°23'E, 137 m) 

and Yakutsk (NOAA Station; ID RA24959; 62°01'N, 129°43'E, 101 m). 

The annual precipitation averages 200 mm with the majority occurring as rain during 

the summer months.  Average temperatures range from +25°C in July and August to 

-40°C in December and January; although during the winter the temperatures can 

decrease to a low of -65°C for short periods.  Snow cover is formed around the end of 

September and will have usually melted by the second half of May.  The thickness of 

the snow varies from 40 to 50 cm.  The rivers are usually ice-bound at the end of 

September and spring break-up is completed by the end of May.  The region 

experiences light winds throughout the year. 

The area has a permafrost layer of 300 to 400 m in thickness, or more. 

Exploration activities may take place most of the year; however, the field season 

typically extends from April/May to September/October. 

5.3 INFRASTRUCTURE 

5.3.1 ROADS 

Yakutia has a poorly developed road network and only 8% of the republic's territory is 

accessible all-year-round, the remaining 92% being seasonally accessible.  Through 

rapid expansion it is hoped that the road infrastructure can be developed such that 

91.5% of the population will have access to the republican centre and that 47.5% of 

the republic's territory will be provided by year-round motorways.  Currently over 70% 

of passenger traffic is by air. 

The Project area is isolated and can be accessed by a winter road that is usable from 

mid-January until mid-April, depending on the depth of snow fall.  All-terrain vehicles 

are used for transporting workers and materials to site.  The vehicles have a capacity 

of 7 t and a round trip from Yakutsk to the Property takes six days.  Outside of this 

three month window, the roads are impassable due to surface thaw of the permafrost 

and subsequent boggy conditions and swollen river crossings. 

The haul route currently used is shown in Figure 5.1.  From Yakutsk to the Lena River 

crossing, there is a year-round road (approximately 200 km).  The Lena River is 

navigable from June until September and has up to 3,000 t barge capacity at 

Batamai, as well as at Sangar.  During this period, Batamai may be used to stage 

supplies for haulage to the Property as the winter road opens several weeks before 

the Lena River freezes over as part of the winter road, an additional distance of 

370 km.  During the winter haulage season, the Lena River may be driven on by 

trucks up to 20 t.  The entire route from Yakutsk to the Property makes a total 

haulage distance of 570 km.

Batagai is the administration centre for the Verkhoyansky district with a population of 

circa 2,000 inhabitants, and is situated approximately 280 km to the northeast of the 

Property.  This town can be used as an alternative access point to the Property.  The 

closest accommodation to the Property is located in this town, which has two hotels 

and restaurants.  Batagai has a river port, along with aviation and transportation 

companies, a telegraph, and post office.  There is an all-weather dirt road between 

the villages of Batagai and Tokuma, and from Tokuma there is a link to the Property 

via a winter road, which is open for only a short period.

The closest village to the Property is Sebyan-Kuel which is located approximately 

50 km south.  The village of Sangar is the administrative centre for the district of 

Kobyaysky, where the Property is located. 

5.3.2 AIR TRANSPORT 

During most of the year the Property is accessible primarily by helicopter or light fixed 

wing aircraft from Yakutsk, Batagai or Sangar.  From Yakutsk, the weather may 

interfere with flight schedules due to the intervening Verkhoyansky mountain range 

and delays of days and occasionally weeks are not uncommon.  From Batagai, the 

helicopter service is more frequent, but delays due to weather conditions may occur.  

There is a helicopter pad at both the Hogan and Endybal camps.  At the Endybal 

camp there is a small airstrip upon which to land small planes.  The airstrip was 

extended during 2009 to 800 m and there is the possibility to extend further to 

around 1,200 m. 

Currently AN-2 and AN-3 fixed wing aircraft are being used for small loads (800 to 

900 kg); MI-8 MTV and MI-26 helicopters are available for heavier loads (up to 

1,800 kg). 

5.3.3 RAIL AND PORTS 

The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk rail link is reportedly near completion.  The rail head 

will be on the east side of the River Lena, it is not known if a bridge is planned.  This 

spur will link Yakutsk to the Trans-Siberian, Amur-Yakutia Railroad and the Northern 

Sea Route.  Journey times will be significantly reduced. 

Further rail links are planned that will eventually connect Yakutsk to Magadan and 

the Sea of Okhotsk. 

The River Lena is navigable from April until late September.  The river ports of 

Yakutsk, Batamai and Sangar may be used to reduce the haulage distance to site by 

approximately 200 km. 

5.3.4 POWER 

There is no access to the main power grid on the Property.  The Kobyaysky district is 

located in the decentralised power supply zone, and has a power generating capacity 

of 16 MW coming from 12 diesel generating sites.  The nearest power generator set 

to the Project site is at Sebyan-Kyuel (375 kW). 

The main power supply company for Yakutia is Sakha Energy.  The current power 

supply system incorporates three isolated power networks; the southern, western and 

eastern regions and a decentralised region.  Power is generated by both thermal and 

hydroelectric methods in the main regions.  The primary source of electrical power in 

the decentralised region is diesel generation and alternative sources of energy such 

as wind power are being introduced. 

By 2020, the electrical generating capacity of Yakutia is expected to be 

supplemented with a further 8,500 MW from seven new power stations.  The

distribution network will be expanded to join the current isolated regions and connect 

to the unified power grid of Central and Western Russia. 

5.4 LOCAL RESOURCES 

The Property is relatively isolated with limited local resources.  The base camp, Hogan 

Camp, is comprised of one and two room cabins, huts and accommodation 

containers.  There are several permanent structures for kitchen, bath and offices.  

There are also buildings for core logging and sampling, sample preparation and 

sample storage as well as sheltered core box storage. 

The use of surface water and water derived from the first level of underground 

exploration drifting requires no further permitting, provided there will be no damage 

to the environment.  The main water source is the Arkachan River, located 10 km 

from the Project.  During the summer, additional water can be obtained from the 

Endybal, Serilenge, Fedor-Yuryage and Mangazeisky creeks which flow through the 

licence area. 

5.5 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Property lies in a mountainous region with elevations ranging from 800 to 

1,400 masl.  The main ridges have steep slopes (25°to 30° and rounded crests that 

are 200 to 500 m above the valley floors). 

The vegetation surrounding the Property is composed of primarily aspen, birch and fir 

trees in the lower parts of the valleys with generally only grass and wildflowers at 

higher elevations.  There are also widespread lichens and mosses.  The region is well 

known for species such as bear, ermine, wolverine, fox, deer, elk, squirrel and wolf.  

There is an abundance of fresh water fish in the streams and lakes, including 

grayling, lenok, pickerel, taimen and perch.

6.0  H ISTORY  

6.1 GENERAL EXPLORATION HISTORY TO 2004 

Discovery of the mineralisation within the Property is attributed to the Russian 

Cossacks in 1764.  Intermittent exploration by individuals continued until the 

formation of the Soviet Union in 1917.  Upon nationalisation of all assets, exploration 

and mining became the responsibility of various government departments or 

agencies.  Sporadic exploration was then undertaken during the 1930s and 1940s. 

During 1952 and 1953, work focused on two previously identified showings known as 

the Mikhailovsky and Kuzminsky, within the Mangazeisky North area. This work 

included geological mapping (1:50,000), trenching with systematic mapping and 

sampling, and the establishment of two short adits (32 m) beneath the trenches.  

Work also included a topographic survey (1:2,000, 3 km2) and an induced 

polarisation survey (1:5,000, 1.7 km2).  By 1960, the exploration work completed in 

the licence area had identified more than 160 anomalies, within a north-south trend 

up to 20 km in length.  This trend is 2 km wide in the north (Nuektame River) and up 

to 4.5 to 5.0 km wide in the south (Endybal River).  In 1989, systematic prospecting 

and exploration resumed, and has continued to this day. 

From 1991 to 2003 JSC Yangeologia (Yangeologia) completed 151,452 m3 of 

trenching, 10.2 line km of magnetic surveys, detailed geological mapping, soil 

geochemical surveys, and 10 diamond drillholes totaling 1,303 m.  This exploration 

work covered more than 15 principal vein systems. 

From 1989, exploration was primarily located within the Vasilievsky, Sterznhevoy, and 

Nizhne-Endybalsky mineralised zones, bringing the total number of discretely 

mineralised structures containing potentially economic grades to more than 30. 

Figure 6.1 shows an example of a historical trench on the Porphyrovy exploration 

target. 

Prognoz acquired the Mangazeisky exploration licence in September 2004.  On 21 

October 2004, Silver Bear acquired 100% of Prognoz by purchasing the company 

from NRC.

6.2 METALLURGICAL TEST WORK AND RECOVERABILITY 

Initial metallurgical results were summarised in a report by Western Services (2004).  

The "Western Services Report" describes metallurgical test work that was conducted 

on two samples from the Property.  One sample, from the Vasilievsky vein in the 

Mangazeisky North area, was composed of un-oxidised primary silver mineralisation, 

and contained minor components of lead, zinc, and copper along with minor stibnite.  

The silver was primarily concentrated within sulphosalts and present as native silver. 

Single step flotation tests resulted in recovering 95% of the contained silver into a 

concentrate.  The concentrate grade was 48 kg/t silver.  Cyanidation of the flotation 

product recovered 99.1% silver from the concentrate.  The total recovery was projected 

to be in the order of 94% for the material contained in the southern block of Vasilievsky. 

A gravitational recovery circuit was also investigated, in which 57% silver was recovered 

into a concentrate with an average grade of 20.15 kg/t silver.  Cyanidation of the 

gravity concentrate recovered 99.2% silver from the concentrate.  The total recovery for 

this process option was 57%. 

The second metallurgical sample collected was from the silver-lead Granichny 

mineralised zone, which is located approximately 1km to the west of Mangazeisky 

North. It consisted of partially oxidised mineralisation composed mainly of galena, 

sphalerite and anglesite (0.1 to 2.0 to 3.0 mm in size).  The silver occurred as 

freibergite, pyrargyrite and argentite (0.02 to 0.50 mm in size) as well as extremely fine-

grained native silver.  The second sample weighed 17.1 kg with an average grade of 

320 g/t silver, 12% lead, and 1.4% zinc. 

Based on the metallurgical test work, a single stage flotation circuit recovered 80.9% 

lead and 89.2% silver into a concentrate.  Cyanidation results for the concentrate were 

not reported.

In 2008, Silver Bear collected two bulk samples from the Vertikalny vein.  The 

samples were collected from the mineralisation intersected by surface trenching.  The 

samples were submitted to TSNIGRI for metallurgical analysis.  The results of this 

work are described in the 2009 technical report (Tetra Tech 2009) and reproduced in 

Section 13.0 for convenience. No historical metallurgical test work is available 

specifically for the Mangazeisky North deposits. 

6.3 HISTORICAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

6.3.1 HISTORICAL NON-COMPLIANT RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

The Property has historical reserve and resource estimates on numerous deposits 

prepared according to the Russian classification system.  Further clarification of the 

Russian classification system can be found in "Ministry of Natural Resources of the 

Russian Federation Order of 11th December 2006 № 278, Classification Approval 

and Predicted Resources Solid Minerals", available at the GKZ website. 

The historical reserve estimate was compiled by Yangeologia in 2000 and is based 

entirely on chip samples from within trenches, and outcrop exposures within the river 

banks.  Most of the silver assays were established using the gamma-activation 

method with external control by fire assay.  Lead, zinc, tin, antimony and copper were 

determined by using the x-ray radiometric method.  The reported methodology (Young 

2004) is outlined in the following paragraphs. 

An average silver composite grade within each trench was calculated using a length 

weighted averaging for the intervals assaying in excess of 150 g/t silver. 

The composited trench results were plotted in plan view, and the limits of the 

mineralisation within and between the trenches were linked together.  Based on the 

trenches contained within the mineralised intercept outline, an average mineralised 

thickness was determined.  The average contained grade of the mineralisation was 

calculated for all mineralised trenches and was also completed on a length weighted 

basis.  

Vertical longitudinal projections were then constructed for each zone.  The projection 

distance downward was 100 m below the surface for almost all of the mineralised 

zones.  The depth of the projected trench values from the surface was based on the 

methodologies employed at the nearby Prognoz silver project, which has similar drill 

results as well as a similar geological genesis, mineralisation type and overall 

character. 

The projected area was multiplied by the weighted average thickness to estimate a 

mineralised volume. This volume was multiplied by one of several specific gravity 

values, which were established from 56 samples collected from the major 

mineralised zones.  These specific gravity values were determined by the Yakutsk 

Nuclear Physics Laboratory in 1992. 

The tonnage, average metal grades and thickness for all discrete mineralised zones 

or subzones were then summarised into a tabular format for the final reporting of the 

estimated reserves.  This reserve contained the mineralisation located nearest to the 

surface and was classified as a P1 "reserve" according to the Russian reserve

classification system.  This classification was selected as there was very little sub-

surface sampling (drilling or underground exploration) available to establish the down 

dip continuity of the mineralisation.  

The second portion of the reserve estimate was then compiled and is referred to as a 

P2 "reserve" class.  This was derived by projecting the mineralisation approximately 

another 100 m below the P1 "reserve" lower datum limit.  This resulted in a doubling 

of the total "reserve" tonnage over that represented by the P1 "reserves" using the 

procedures noted above. 

A total of 36 mineralised structures were identified as including P1 and/or P2 

Russian classified "reserves".  Table 6.1 summarises the distribution of the historical 

Russian "reserves" by mineralised zone, with the top 15 zones reported individually 

and the remaining zones combined.

Authority GKZ in Protocol document No. 2754 (GKZ ROSNEDRA) of 13th April 2012. 

The cut-off grade used for the C1 and C2 resources was 75 g/t silver.  Based on 

protocol document No. 2754, Silver Bear received its Certificate of First Discovery 

from ROSNEDRA on 2 August 2012.  The C2 Resource (Mangazeisky North) was 

based on a 2007 Yangeologia annual property report filing. 

The historical Russian reserve and resource estimates do not conform to the CIM 

Standards and Definitions for Resource Estimates.  A QP has not carried out 

sufficient work to verify the historical estimates as current mineral reserves and 

resources and therefore, Silver Bear is treating the numbers as historical only. 

6.3.2 HISTORIC NI 43-101 COMPLIANT RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

In March 2009, Tetra Tech published an initial NI 43-101 resource estimate for the 

Vertikalny structure that was later revised in December 2009.  The resource was 

further updated in the September 2011 PEA and April 2015.  A maiden resource 

estimate was disclosed for the Nizhny Endybal target in September 2015. 

This report discloses the maiden resource estimate for the Mangazeisky North 

deposits.

6.4 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION 

There has been no historical production on the Property.  Due to the remote location 

and lack of infrastructure there has been very little mining in this region.

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Property is located within the Verkhoyansk mobile belt of north-eastern Yakutia.  

The fold-and-thrust belt forms part of a major orogenic system separating the 

Siberian North Asian Craton to the west from the immense expanse of accreted 

terranes that form most of Far East Russia.  The belt extends for 2,000 km from the 

Laptev Sea to the Sea of Okhotsk (Figure 7.1).  It is comprised of a greater than 7 km 

thick sequence of Late Precambrian to Triassic rocks deposited along the Palaeo-

Pacific margin of the Siberian Craton, which developed because of rifting events 

during the Late Precambrian period and again during the Late Devonian to Early 

Mississippian periods.   

Deformation during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous occurred with low-grade 

metamorphism in the internal parts of the belt and the emplacement of high-level 

granitic bodies.  Strike-slip faulting occurred during the Tertiary period. 

The central part of the belt is dominantly comprised of a thick, monotonous 

succession of Carboniferous and Permian turbidites that are metamorphosed to 

lower-greenschist facies.  Granodiorite and granite plutons have intruded the core of 

the belt and are associated with extensive gold-bearing quartz vein systems.

7.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The mineral occurrences on the Property are located in the interfluve of the 

Nuektame and Arkachan rivers and ranges from the mid-channel of the Muhalkan 

River to the mouth of the Mysovoi Stream.  The mineral deposits are confined to the 

eastern wing of the Kuranakhsky anticlinorium and are situated within the contours 

of the Endybal anticline. 

Higher order asymmetric anticlinal and synclinal folds that are 2 to 20 km in length 

complicate the hinge portion of the Endybal anticline.  The Mukhalkansky anticline 

with a north-northwest strike (340°) and the Mangazeisky syncline, which are

adjacent on the western side, complicate the eastern wing of the Endybal anticline.  

The dip of the rocks of the Endybal anticline in the area of the Mangazeisky deposits 

averages 20 to 45°. 

Two north-south zones of faulting are distinguished.  The most important is the 

Nuektaminsky shear zone which limits the expansion of mineralisation to the east. 

The movement along the Nuektaminsky fault is left-lateral.  The next is the Granichny 

shear zone with right-lateral movement.  The Granichny fault is a splay off the 

Nuektaminsky fault and together they form a V-shape, which represents a zone of 

tension.  The Granichny shear zone hosts two vertical deposits (Semenovsky and 

Granichny) that cross-cut the stratigraphy. 

The silver mineralisation is epigenetic.  This is particularly clear at the Nizhny Endybal 

deposit, where the mineralised strata-bound zones exhibit structural deformation.  

The strata-bound veins and cross-cutting fracture systems in the region are 

associated with shearing.  This is reflected in the common occurrence of parallel 

layers of slip planes along the boundaries of the sandstone beds and selvages of 

strata-bound veins, such as Mikhailovsky, Olgina, Vasilievsky and Anglesite-Cerussite.  

The structural analysis of joints in the mineralised rocks shows the ubiquitous 

existence of overthrusting dislocations (Kostin et. al.1997). 

The Endybal diatreme and quartz porphyry dykes postdate the overthrust event.  The 

geological studies by Yangeologia and by A.V. Kostin et al. have led to the following 

conclusions regarding the sequence of events:  

1. mineralised layers of sandstone containing sulphide mineralisation 

2. structural deformation 

3. Endybal diatreme. 

7.3 MINERALISATION 

This region of Yakutia is known to contain many silver deposits; Figure 7.2 illustrates 

the position of the Property in relation to a number of the known silver projects in the 

region.

The Property contains several explored areas that host more than 100 occurrences of 

mineralisation.  The mineral occurrences are concentrated within a 35-km long 

corridor (Figure 7.3).

The Property hosts at least four different types of mineralisation: 

 Strata-bound silver-bearing, quartz-carbonate-sulphide structures with 

average grades greater than 900 g/t silver, with lead and zinc by-products.  

These silver bearing structures were mapped and sampled over an area of 

65 km2.  Examples of this are the Vasilievsky—Anglesite-Cerussite and 

Olgina—Mikhailovsky veins within the Mangazeisky North zone. 

 Thicker linear-type stockwork areas with carbonate-silver sulphosalt 

mineralisation.  Examples of this occur in the Strezhevoy and Nizhny Endybal 

Zones. 

 Narrow, steep dipping veins such as Vertikalny that cross-cut stratigraphy 

and feature grades in excess of 1,000 g/t silver over widths ranging from 

several centimetres to several metres.  Vertikalny and possibly Zabytoe and 

Kis-Kuel are examples of this style of mineralisation. 

 A porphyry area associated with quartz, quartz-carbonate and quartz-

sulphide veins and veinlets, hosted by extrusive rhyolite porphyry.  Porfirovy 

is an example of this. 

Each mineralised area is described in the following sections. 

7.3.1 MANGAZEISKY 

The Mangazeisky North deposits comprise of a series of sub-parallel shallowly dipping 

stratiform epithermal veins, hosted within a package of sediments belonging to the 

Echinyskaya, Khorokiskaya and Kigiltasskaya suites.  The host rocks comprise a 

series of interbedded siltstones, sandstones and argillites,  

The area is dominated by a north-north west/ south-south east striking anticlinal fold, 

Figure 7.4. Bedding planes and mineralisation dips at between 20 and 40° towards 

the East.

Technical Report and Resource Estimate of the 

Mangazeisky Silver Project, Mangazeisky North Deposits,

The mineralization of Mangazeisky North is mainly associated with banded brecciated 

textures. The following minerals are present:  Native silver, acanthite, stephanite, 

polybasite, canfieldite, pyrargyrite, miargyrite, diaphorite, tetrahedrite, owyheeite, 

freieslebenite, boulangerite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite. 

The veins are strata-bound, occurring on contacts between strata, particularly around 

sandstone units, and tend to be dilated towards the hinge of the local fold structure. 

It is noted that the strongest silver mineralisation occurs within the central core of the 

veins, this also correlates with the zones of strongest oxidation. 

Brecciated sandstones have a thickness up to 0.5 m with the contacts of the 

brecciated zones being sharp and defined by early shearing.  The shear commonly 

exhibits slickensides with horizontal striations.  Brecciation was also accompanied by 

silicification of the finely laminated fine-grained sandstones.  The cement is 

represented by medium grained quartz and fine-grained light grey siderite.  The 

interpretation of tectonic stress fields for the southern flank of the Vasilievsky Zone 

(Kostin et al. 1997) indicates that mineralised shoots formed in areas where both 

vertical and horizontal displacement occurred. 

7.3.2 VERTIKALNY 

The Vertikalny vein has been traced on surface for 5.1 km.  The under-explored 

southeast portion, identified in 1990 by Yangeologia, possibly extends to the Endybal 

River valley.  To the northeast, along the areas where strongly oxide material is 

identified, the vein swells from 3 to 15 m.  Further northeast, the zone splits into two.  

The eastern branch, which is obscured by a siltstone bed, was traced by individual 

grab samples in erosional windows.  

The mineralisation occurs as sandstone breccias with quartz or siderite cement, 

abundant hydrous ferric oxides that results from the oxidation of sphalerite and 

galena.  In the Northwest Zone, potential mineralisation was traced in float and frost 

heaves up to the head of Krainy Creek.  Further along, the mineral zone enters the 

right side of the Serilenge River, where it is tested by trenches and found to contain 

galena-siderite mineralisation.  Along the entire length, mineralisation is expressed as 

breccias with siderite-sphalerite-galena and various quantities of silver sulphosalts.  

Mineralisation is usually associated with the presence of dykes of intermediate to 

basic composition. 

The Vertikalny Zone is not a single linear feature, but rather a combination of 

conjugated faults and breccias with various mineral compositions and quality.  

Structurally, the Vertikalny Zone is associated with the right-lateral strike-slip fault 

zone, which can be readily identified on IKONOS satellite images.  Exploration of the 

structure has revealed sub-parallel branches with potentially prospective 

mineralisation similar to that found in the Central Zone.  The intersections of the main 

structure and vein splays can result in the development of thicker intersections of 

mineralisation. 

The mineral composition along the length of the Vertikalny structure is represented by 

galena and sphalerite, with subordinate values of other sulphides.  However, early 

geochemical association analysis has shown three mineralisation types, which

characterise the zones:  The Northwest Zone (silver-lead-zinc), the Central Zone 

(silver-lead-zinc-tin) and the Southeast Zone (lead-zinc). 

The three zones of the Vertikalny structure are presented in Figure 7.5. 

The total drilled strike length of the Vertikalny structure is some 2,400 m.  Drilling has 

tested portions of the structure to a maximum depth of 500 m from surface.  Figure 

7.6 shows a cored mineralised intersection from drillhole V13-020.

7.3.3 ZABYTOE AND ZABYTOE-2 

The Zabytoe occurrence was discovered in 1934 and further explored in 1992 to 

1994.  Mineral occurrences are concentrated on the walls and in the watershed of 

the Fedor-Yuryage River (refer to Figure 7.3). 

This area is referred to as the 'up-structure' of the Endybal anticline and is composed 

of nearly horizontal beds of sandstones and siltstones (Kygyltassky Suite).  The 

stratigraphy is cut by sub-parallel; sub-vertical felsic dykes and later intermediate to 

basic dykes, of up to 5 m thick, which occur along a strike length of 2.5 km.  The host 

rocks are sheared and broken by a number of fractures, often gouge-bearing, which 

control the branching, sub-parallel and steep-dipping zones of mineralisation.  The 

structural disturbance is related to the Granichny fault system. 

Mineralisation occurs as a structurally disturbed zone that intersects stratigraphy 

under a gravelite layer in the same stratigraphic level as the Strezhevoy mineralised 

body.  The total width of the steeply dipping zone is 50 to 60 m (up to 2 km), striking 

at 315 to 340°.  A single trench, developed by Yangeologia in 1991, returned 

1,906.5 g/t silver, 59.3% lead and 1.85% zinc from sandstone breccia cemented 

with sulphides. 

The following minerals are present in the Zabytoe occurrence:  galena, sphalerite, 

tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, boulangerite and arsenopyrite.  The association is 

silver-galena-sphalerite-siderite.  Mineralisation occurs with galena, sphalerite and 

siderite-silver sulphosalt aggregates. 

There are two parallel zones of mineralisation located within 200 to 300 m from each 

other – the Western and Eastern (A.I. Nekrasov et. al, 2004). 

The mineralisation potential is promising, given its structural and mineralogical 

similarity with Vertikalny.  It is evident from the IKONOS satellite image that the 

potentially mineralised areas of Zabytoe can be traced south toward the Porfirovy 

site.

7.3.4 KIS-KUEL 

The Kis-Kuel site is located approximate 20 km southeast of Vertikalny, in the 

western limb of the Endybal anticline (this is some 10 km to the south of the 

southern limit of Figure 7.3). 

The geology at Kis-Kuel consists of granitoid intrusive bodies beneath sedimentary 

units.  The sediments above the stocks contain veinlets of sphalerite.  The stock itself 

hosts quartz-galena-chalcopyrite veinlets, brecciated intermediate dykes, brecciated 

sandstone with argentiferous healed with galena-quartz cements, oxidised intrusive 

with disseminated sulphides.  In most cases the stock is obscured by the overlying 

sediments. 

The mineralisation is controlled by linear structures associated with the 

Nuektaminsky fault as well as structures formed during the crystallisation of the Kis-

Kuel pluton.    

This style of mineralisation has no similarities to others seen on the exploration 

licence and therefore, warrants further investigation.  Lead and zinc mineralisation, 

previously only seen in the margins of intrusive bodies, occurs in the centre of the 

Kis-Kuel pluton, which might indicate the presence of an undiscovered copper–

molybdenum or gold-copper porphyry.   There are also several occurrences of 

arsenopyrite-quartz veining, which indicates the potential for gold mineralisation. 

7.3.5 OROGONDIA 

The Orogondia deposit is located some 20 km to the south of the Mangazeisky North 

deposits and 8 km to the south of the Endybal airstrip. 

Based on data by V.V. Shoshin (Nekrasov A.I. et. al, 1997) mineralisation at 

Orogondia is connected with a near conformable mineralised zone of shearing with a 

strike of 325 to 345° that can be traced for up to 4 km.  Most of the mineralisation is 

concentrated on the surface of medium-grained sandstones as sulphide-quartz-

siderite veinlets, of 0.5 to 2 m wide (average thickness is 0.8 m).  The reported length 

of the mineralised body is circa 1 km. 

The grade varies from 138 to 886 g/t silver, 4.83 to 25.44% lead, and 2.12 to 7.78% 

zinc.  The following minerals are present:  galena, sphalerite, pyrite, tetrahedrite, 

arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, stannite, owyheeite, diaphorite, boulangerite.   Based on 

the data from Yangeologia, the Orogondia showing was evaluated from nine grab 

samples, selected from float and subcrop. 

Mapping and prospecting in 2008 led to the discovery of a strata-bound zone of 

oxidised quartz-carbonate which measures 0.8 m wide, with a strike length of 200 to 

1,200 m.  This occurrence is described as potentially non-argentiferous as it contains 

only sparse quantities of disseminated sphalerite and galena. 

The work in 2008 failed to locate the occurrences of the mineralisation as reported 

by Yangeologia within 4 km of its proposed location.  It is likely that there were 

several different occurrences, which combined and appeared to be a single feature.

7.3.6 STERZHNEVOE 

This zone is a complex vein system of approximately 600 m in length with a thickness 

of up to 5 m, but averaging approximately 0.9 m.  The thickness of the individual 

veins within the larger vein system varies from 10 to 20 cm.  In addition, parallel 

mineral zones are associated with the main deposit.  The average grade of silver of 

the zone is 2,652 g/t.  The mineralised veins are situated within medium and coarse-

grained sandstones and siltstones, overlying a lower conglomerate unit.  A significant 

amount of a black organic substance (shungite) is present in the cement, binding the 

particles of the sedimentary units together.  In the areas where there has been 

hydrothermal reworking of the sandstones, shungite forms lenses and flakes in 

association with coarse-crystalline drusy quartz.  The underlying layers of sandstone 

contain disseminated silver mineralisation and are within the same stratigraphy as 

the Nizhny Endybal deposit. 

The Sterzhnevoe Zone was formed as a result of remobilised mineralisation from 

underlying silver rich sulphide-bearing sandstones, into structures formed in a shear 

zone with numerous secondary downthrown blocks and overthrusts (Kostin et. al., 

1997).  There is a downthrown layer with a thick zone of boudinage and jointing 

situated parallel to the main zone.  The Sterzhnevoe Zone can be traced from the 

Bezymyanny deposit to the Zabytoe mineral occurrence and is characterised by 

barren hydrothermal activity, expressed in remobilisation of an organic substance 

(shungite) and the formation of quartz druses from sandstone.   

Tracing the hydrothermal rock alterations through the boudinage zone along the 

strike of the siltstone layer to the north of the Sterzhnevoe Zone as indicated by the 

preservation of the vein and rock alterations (quartz crystals druses, lenses and 

shungite flakes) shows that silver mineralisation is absent.  The assumption is that 

the mineral components for the Sterzhnevoe Zone were taken from stratigraphically 

underlying rocks of the Nizhny Endybal deposit and hydrothermal activity channelled 

their remobilisation into more favourable structures. 

7.3.7 MUKHALKANSKY 

The Mukhalkansky mineralisation is represented by two galena bearing veins.  The 

first vein, which cross-cuts the stratigraphy has been traced for 800 m and has an 

average width of 0.2 m and contains an average silver content of 1,295.4 g/t.  The 

vein is confined to a tectonic fault that was accompanied by brecciation of the 

enclosing rocks during its formation.  The vein is orientated parallel to the 

Nuektaminsky fault and is believed to be its mineralisation supplying fragment.  The 

second vein is a concordant vein in its mode of occurrence and is confined to a 

stratum of thin layer sandstones.  The second vein branch can be traced for 

approximately 500 m and has a width of between 0.2 and 0.4 m.  The average silver 

content of the second vein is 2,328.7 g/t. 

7.3.8 BEZYMYANNY 

The Bezymyanny mineralisation is composed of several zones confined to inter-stratal 

ruptures.  The mineral veins are located along the contacts of medium-grained and 

fine-grained sandstone strata.  Veins are traced for 500 m with a thickness ranging

from between 2 to 5 cm and 34 to 40 cm.  The mineralisation content varies from 

756 to 24,433 g/t silver, 0.4 to 1.5 g/t gold, 0.1 to 7.81% lead and 0.1 to 0.8% zinc. 

7.3.9 NIZHNY ENDYBAL  

The Nizhny Endybal deposit has been known since 1774 under the name "Kokovin 

Silver Mine".  The style of the mineralisation at Nizhny Endybal takes the form of a 

stockwork style network of thin veins.  Concentrations of the stockwork are 

accumulated into lens shaped bodies centred around the hinge of the anticline as 

shown in Figure 7.8.  The mineralisation is associated with siderite veins, which are 

principally parallel or sub-parallel to bedding.  However, occasional sub-vertical veins 

are present, which cross-cut the bedding planes.  The veins are predominantly 1 to 2 

cm in thickness, but occasionally up to 10 to 15 cm.  The thicker veins include 

veinlets of fahlore and vugs filled with fahlore crystals (refer to Figure 7.11 and Figure 

7.12).  Galena may also be present as separate veins, but the silver mineralisation 

does not appear to be directly related to the presence of galena. 

Figure 7.7 Stratiform Siderite Veining in Drillhole END-31A 

 
Source:  Silver Bear 2012. 

The mineralisation is concentrated within the fold axis of the anticline and decreases 

with distance along the fold limbs from the axis.  If a transect is taken approximately 

east-west, perpendicular to the fold axis, the thickness of the intersections and mean 

silver grades decrease to negligible at a distance of circa 40 to 50 m from the centre 

of the fold axis (illustrated in cross-section in Figure 7.8).  In general, the width of the 

mineralised zones west to east (across strike) is approximately 80 to 100 m and has 

a continuous strike length of approximately 700 m.  Discontinuous mineralisation has 

been traced in recent drilling to a distance of approximately 1,300 m along strike.

The mineralisation at Nizhny Endybal is contained within a series of interbedded 

sandstone and silty-sandstone units.  It is thought that the silty-sandstone units have 

a lower permeability than the adjacent sandstone units and have, therefore, inhibited 

the flow of fluids.  The sandstones are anticipated to have higher permeability and 

are more readily fractured and, as such, have provided preferential pathways for fluid 

flow and associated mineralisation.  

Three major sandstone units have been highlighted within the interbedded sequence 

at Nizhny Endybal.  The average thicknesses of the units are 17, 22 and 60 m.  The 

upper and middle units are 17 and 22 m in thickness and comprise fine and medium-

grained sandstones.  The lower unit is 60 m in thickness and comprises coarse-

grained sandstones.  The significant mineralised intersections are associated with 

layers of medium-grained sandstones.

the cliff face.

7.3.10 PORFIROVY 

Mineralisation in the Porfirovy area is associated with quartz, quartz-carbonate and 

quartz-sulphide veins and veinlets hosted by rhyolite and dacite porphyry. 

The copper and gold potential of the area has only recently been recognised and the 

copper-silver soil geochemical results indicate an anomalous area that corresponds 

with the intrusive complex.  Locally the rhyolite has been silicified and the feldspars 

exhibit argillic alteration. 

The porphyry is well defined by the magnetic anomaly survey, Figure 7.13.

7.3.11 BORISOVSKY 

Borisovsky occurs on the terrace along the northeast wall of the Serilenge River in the 

mouth of the Borisovsky Creek to the northwest.  Outcrop with fragments of quartz-

carbonate breccias with dispersed sulphides (mostly pyrite) as pockets and veinlets 

were found within the zone.  The outcrops are thought to be correlated with along a 

north-western trend (330), around Vostochny. 

At Zapadny, 1.5 mm quartz-filled fractures, quartz-carbonate breccias and quartz-

siderite formations with dispersed pyrite veinlets are hosted within fine and medium-

grained sandstones.  The structures general trend is 075°.  

The Vostochny fault zone was traced for 400 m to the northwest along the wall of the 

northeastern terrace of the Serilenge River by sporadic fragments of yellow-white 

quartz and quartz-siderite with sulphide (pyrite, rare galena) mineralisation.  In the 

north-western part of this zone, grab samples are of pyrite and galena that occur as 

disseminated inclusions in yellow-white quartz with pockets of siderite.

8.0  D EP OSIT  TYPES  

The Property contains two main deposit types: epigenetic polymetallic silver-lead-zinc 

veins (metasediment hosted), and porphyry (copper, gold, silver).  The majority of the 

exploration, and the existing resources, are focused upon the polymetallic silver-lead-

zinc veins.  The veins are sulphide-rich, containing sphalerite, galena, silver, and 

sulphosalt minerals in a carbonate and quartz gangue. 

The Mangazeisky North deposit comprise of a series of sub-parallel shallowly dipping 

stratiform epithermal veins. The mineralization of Mangazeisky North is mainly 

associated with banded breccias texture and represented with siderite-sphalerite-

galena, quartz-pyrite-arsenopyrite, and ankerite-sulphosalts forming a silver rich 

polymetallic mineralisation. 

At the Vertikalny deposit, the veins are emplaced in and along fractures and faults in 

a sedimentary basin dominated by clastic rocks that have been deformed, 

metamorphosed, and intruded by igneous rocks.  The veins are steeply dipping and 

narrow. 

At the Nizhny Endybal deposit, a stockwork of cross-cutting polymetallic veins are 

concentrated within stratiform lenses of sandstone and siltstone.  The mineralisation 

is concentrated to the centre of the Endybal anticline fold axis. 

In many cases, the geology and morphology of the mineralised veins from these 

deposits appear to be similar to the Prognoz property, located some 160 km to the 

east of the Property and currently being developed by Nord Gold N. V. 

The Porfirovy area of the Property represents a potential copper-gold-silver porphyry 

deposit, related to a sub-volcanic intrusive body.

8.1 GEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS BEHIND EXPLORATION PROGRAMME 

The Mangazeisky North deposits are known to be associated with lithological 

boundaries; therefore the focus of the trenching has been around outcropping 

lithological contacts.  The strike and dip of the lithological units was taken into 

account when designing the drilling campaigns to ensure that the intercepts are 

normal to the strike and dip of the veins.  

At the Vertikalny and Nizhny Endybal deposits, structural geology influences the 

extent and distribution of the mineralisation.  Surface trenching and diamond drilling 

campaigns have been targeted to systematically explore profiles along the strike 

length of the interpreted structural features (i.e. along the fractures and faults at 

Vertikalny, and along the fold axis of the Endybal anticline). 

Geological mapping, historical geophysical surveys, and soil sampling campaigns 

guided the initial drilling and trenching programmes.

9.1 2004 TO 2010 EXPLORATION PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

The exploration campaigns completed prior to 2010 have been disclosed in the 

September 2011 PEA completed by Tetra Tech (Tetra Tech 2011).  Table 9.1 

provides a summary of the exploration completed prior to 2010. 

Early exploration by Prognoz, Silver Bear's subsidiary, was focused upon the narrow, 

strata-bound silver mineralisation of the Vasilievsky and Mikhailovsky veins at 

Mangazeisky North.  From 2007, the focus shifted to the development of the 

Vertikalny deposit and included the exploration activities on the thicker, linear, 

stockworks at Nizhny Endybal.

9.4 2014 EXPLORATION PROGRAMME 

In 2014, a trenching programme was carried out on the Vertikalny deposit, and the 

Porfirovy and Sterzhnevoy exploration targets.  Only one additional trench was 

completed at the Mangazeisky North deposit.  Table 9.4 presents a summary of the 

trenching programme completed during 2014.  The samples associated with this 

work have not yet been assayed.

9.5 TRENCH SAMPLING PROCEDURES 

The current sampling methods and approaches are summarised as follows: 

 A main trench was excavated over and along the strike of the mineralised 

zones to a depth of up to 4 m to expose the mineralised zones.  The width of 

the trenches was 1 to 4 m depending on the thickness of the overburden. 

 Where possible sampling and drilling is conducted on a grid of parallel lines 

oriented perpendicular to the strike of the main mineralised zones.  All 

trenches, road cuttings and other exposures were mapped in detail and 

sampled as required. 

 All sampling in the trenches were sampled by channel samples 

perpendicular to the strike of the mineralised zones, the cross-section of 

which was 3 x 10 cm.  The length of the samples varies from 0.1 to 6.0 m 

and averages 1 m.  The entire trench exposure is sampled.  Sample weights 

vary from 5 to 10 kg and average 7.5 kg.

All trench sampling was conducted on a grid of parallel profiles oriented 

perpendicular to the strike of the main mineralised zones.  The sampled profiles were 

initially established at widely spaced intervals which have been in-filled as exploration 

continues. 

The initial trenches were dug along the strike of the mineralised zones to a depth of 

up to 4 m to expose the mineralised zones.  The width of the trenches was generally 

between 4 m and 5 m to allow full intersections to be taken as profiles orientated 

perpendicular to the strike of the mineralisation (Figure 9.2). 

The samples were returned to camp on a daily basis, where the material is dried, 

crushed, split and assayed using the methods outlined in Section 11.0.  As with the 

drill core samples, standard and blank samples are submitted every 20 samples, 

however, no field duplicates are collected.

9.1 TETRA TECH OPINION 

Tetra Tech is of the opinion that the exploration has generally been conducted using 

methods and procedures that are consistent with recognised industry best practices. 

However, the trench sampling has not been included in the grade interpolation due to

statistically significant bias that is noted when comparing the trenches with nearby 

drillholes.  

The bias may be due to natural mechanical enrichment at surface, or may have been 

introduced as a result of the manual channelling methods used to sample the 

trenches.  The trenching also lacked QA/QC samples, which prevented full data 

verification to be undertaken. 

Tetra Tech recommends further work to resample the trenches using a rock saw to 

cut a sample, where appropriate and a full QA/QC programme.

Details about the drilling campaigns completed prior to 2010 have been disclosed 

fully in the 2011 PEA (Wardrop 2011).  The 2011 to 2012 drilling campaigns have 

been disclosed fully in the 2013 Technical Report (Tetra Tech 2013).  Both reports 

are filed under Silver Bear's profile on SEDAR.  Table 10.1 provides a summary of the

10.1 DRILLING PROGRAMME 2013/2014 

10.1.1 MANGAZEISKY NORTH DEPOSIT DRILLING, 2014 

Silver Bear commenced drilling at Mangazeisky during the 2014 field season.  During 

this period, 60 diamond drillholes were completed intersecting the Mangazeisky 

North and South mineralised structures. 

The 2014 drilling programme was designed with the intention of resource definition 

at the Mangazeisky site.  The drilling dips between 58° and 66°, with the majority 

dipping at 60°.  All of the drillholes are orientated towards the southwest (generally 

toward 240°). 

The mineralisation dips at 20° to 40° towards the northeast, therefore with drilling at 

60° towards the south west the true thickness of the mineralised structure ranges 

between 85% and 98% of the intercept length. 

Figure 10.1 shows the drilling locations at Mangazeisky North.   

Table 10.2 shows a summary of the drilling at Mangazeisky North deposits.

10.1.2 VERTIKALNY DEPOSIT DRILLING, 2013 – 2014 

Silver Bear also re-commenced drilling at the Vertikalny deposit during the 2013/14 

field seasons.  During this period, diamond drilling added a further 59 intersections of 

the Vertikalny mineralised structures. 

The 2013/2014 infill drilling programme was designed with the intention of 

increasing knowledge of the short range variability of the mineralisation, to build 

confidence in the grade continuity.  The drilling was focused close to surface, within 

the Vertikalny Central Zone and Northwest Zone. 

The majority of the 2013/2014 drilling dips at between 60 and 66°, with all of the 

drillholes orientated towards the southwest (generally with a strike of 224° of 220°).  

As a consequence of the drilling angle and the steeply dipping mineralisation, the 

true thickness of the mineralisation is between 40% and 50% of the drilled 

intersection lengths (see Table 10.2). 

In order to provide representative mineralised samples of sufficient quantity for 

metallurgical testing, drillholes V13-35MET to V13-45MET were advanced at 80°.  

For these drillholes, the true mineralisation thickness is approximately 17% of the 

reported intersection length in  

Table 10.4 provides summary information relating to the 2013/2014 drilling 

campaigns.

The logging and assaying of the 2014 drillholes at Vertikalny could not be completed in 

time to be disclosed in this report or included within a new resource estimate.  This work 

will be completed in the forthcoming field season. 

Significant intersections are tabulated in Table 10.5.  Intersections are considered 

significant where silver has a length weighted grade of more than 100 g/t over a length 

of more than 1.0 m.

The average and range of mineralised widths observed in the 2013 drilling is consistent 

with those observed in previous drilling conducted in the same areas.  

The approximate average intercept spacing in the upper 90 m of the Vertikalny central 

zone is 30 m.  Below this depth, the average intercept spacing is approximately 50 m. 

10.1.3 DRILLING METHODS 

All of the 2014 drilling was completed using diamond coring techniques, with the majority 

completed using Boart Longyear rigs, and the remainder using a Russian SKB 5 rig.  

Figure 10.2 and Figure 10.3 show typical drill setups. The Boart Longyear LF™70 rigs 

collar at HQ (63.5 mm) diameter and reduce to NQ (47.6 mm) at around 40 m.  The 

Russian drill rig collars with 112 mm diameter core reducing to 93 mm at about 6 m 

depth and then to 76 mm where required.  The Boart Longyear rigs have an established 

water line and drilling mud is used to maintain core recovery.  Whereas, the Russian drill 

rig drills dry.  Core recovery is measured and recorded by Silver Bear geologists and was 

found to be excellent for both the Boart Longyear and the Russian SKB 5 rig.

10.2 DOWN HOLE DIRECTIONAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY 

For the Boart Longyear drill rig, surveys were undertaken using a Reflex 'EZ-shot'™ single 

shot down hole survey tool that is operated by the driller.  Measurements were taken 

every 25 m for the first 100 m and at 50 m intervals thereafter.  Readings are recorded 

on paper slips that are delivered to the Project geologist on a daily basis.  The azimuth is 

recorded as magnetic and this is corrected by the appropriate declination.  The 

measurements are recorded in the drillhole database and the drill logs.  Copies are kept 

by the contractor.  

For the Russian drill rig, down hole surveys are conducted using an inclinometer at 20 m 

intervals.  

10.3 DRILLHOLE COLLAR SURVEY METHODOLOGY 

The Project Geologist and drill foreman co-operate to prepare all drill sites prior to the 

drill moves.  The surveyor is directly responsible to the Project geologist. 

From 2011 onwards, the previous method of chain survey was replaced by the use of 

Precision Point Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS), with the establishment of

control points and a survey network.  All drillhole collars and trench locations have been 

re-surveyed using the DGPS.  Correlation with the previous survey was very good.  All 

surveys are reported in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) World Geodetic System 

(WGS) 84, Northern Zone 52. 

10.4 DRILL CORE HANDLING PROTOCOL 

At the drill site, core is transferred from the core barrel to deep, un-lidded, wooden core 

boxes.  The drill crew are initially responsible for reassembly of the core.  It is noted that 

not all of the artificial breaks created to fit the core in the boxes are marked.  The core is 

not orientated.  

A summary log is completed in the field at the drilling site that identifies the main 

lithologies and mineralised zone(s). 

Drill core is transported to the core sheds at Hogan base camp from the drill site, where it 

is washed to remove any drill solute as required.  The core is laid out in the purpose built 

work area for logging.  The pieces of core inside each box are arranged sequentially in 

order to restore them as far as possible to their original sequence.  The core is then 

measured and the box labelled.  Labelling includes marking of start and end depths by 

box and drilled intervals on core dividers and on the box end using indelible pen, together 

with a metal tag recording the same information.  All measurements are made in metres. 

10.4.1 LOGGING 

Silver Bear has a standardised system of logging, which includes the following 

information: 

SUMMARY LOG 

 hole location and survey details 

 narrative summary of hole 

 summary of mineralised interval(s). 

SIMPLE GEOTECHNICAL LOG 

 measurement of core recovery 

 fracture counts 

 rock quality designation (RQD) measurement 

 fracture orientation. 

DETAILED LOG 

Prior to 2013, holes were logged to scale on standard logging sheets, recording 

lithological unit intervals with a strip log and rock code assigned according to a standard

scheme, free description, sampled intervals, sample numbers and sample standard 

reference number as appropriate.  For the 2013 and 2014 drill campaigns, core logging 

was completed electronically using a laptop computer and recorded directly into 

Geospark Core Database System™ (Geospark).  

It is noted that the lithological codes used for the various campaigns are inconsistent and 

that some retrospective grouping is required to develop a standardised database.  The 

lithology codes are currently being standardised to avoid this issue in future. 

The core is marked for sampling during logging.  The geologist marks the end of each 

sample with a red/orange marker on the core and on the core box divider.  One half of a 

pair of uniquely numbered sample tickets is attached to the core box at the start of the 

sample.  

Once geological logging is complete the core is photographed.  Each box is photographed 

in daylight, both wet and dry.  Each photograph includes a clearly labelled card with the 

drillhole number marked on it and a metric scale shown.  Photographs are reviewed prior 

to core cutting.  The photographs are stored using a standard nomenclature of: <hole 

number>_<box_start_depth><W or D>.jpg. 

10.5 AREA SPECIFIC SAMPLING AND LOGGING DISCUSSION  

10.5.1 MANGAZEISKY SAMPLING 

Core was either cut in half by diamond rock saw, or where the core is soft, half is 

removed using a spatula, in order that material is not washed away by the cutting 

process.  The cut half of core is returned to the box as a permanent record.  Where a field 

duplicate sample is to be taken the core is quartered.  The geologist then bags up each 

sample, inserting the pair of sample tickets into the bag and writing the sample number 

on the outside of the bag.  The geologist delivers the samples to the sample preparation 

facility located by the core shed. 

On completion of logging and sampling the boxes are stored and arranged sequentially in 

sheltered core storage area adjacent to the logging and sampling facilities. 

10.5.2 MANGAZEISKY LOGGING 

The Mangazeisky structures can be identified during logging, therefore any intersection of 

the structure may contain a variety of lower and higher grade intervals.   

There is a moderate correlation between grade and sample length, with some of the very 

high grades being found within short samples, of less than 0.8 m (Figure 10.4).

No correlation between grade and recovery has historically been observed at 

Mangazeisky.  Good drill core recoveries have been recorded throughout the campaigns 

completed at Mangazeisky averaging over 95%. 

10.6 TETRA TECH OPINION 

Some inconsistencies were noted within the drillhole database and procedures and 

systems are being put in place to circumvent similar occurrences in future.  In Tetra 

Tech's opinion, the inconsistencies do not represent a material risk to the robustness of 

the resource estimate. 

Tetra Tech is of the opinion that the drilling has been generally been completed using 

methods and procedures that are consistent with recognised industry practices and that 

the data is adequate for resource estimation.

11.0  SAMP LE  P REP ARATION,  ANALYSES AND  
SECURITY  

This section summarises the sampling and sample preparation methodology adopted 

by Silver Bear during their various exploration programmes.  Prior to 2007, the 

sample preparation, analyses, and security were conducted according to Russian 

GKZ Standards. 

The general approaches and methodologies are consistent for all of the exploration 

targets across the Property, with the exception of specific components which are 

described separately for each area in Sections 11.1.4 and 11.1.5. 

Silver Bear carries out training of Russian geologists and support staff in sampling 

procedures. 

11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSES 

Upon completion of logging and sampling, paperwork outlining the regime for analysis 

is prepared from the geological log.  Silver Bear operates its own sample preparation 

laboratory where samples are crushed and milled (Figure 11.1). 

Figure 11.1 Crushing Equipment in Silver Bear's On-site Sample Preparation Facilities

Samples are crushed and milled to greater than 85% passing 1 mm, before 

quartering, to produce a 1 kg sample.  Final milling is carried out at the assaying 

laboratory ALS Chemex in Chita, Russia, where the material is reduced to 85% 

passing 75 µm. 

Sample trays are vacuum cleaned post jaw crushing.  The jaw crusher operator clears 

all sample material from the crusher and brushes off the crusher apron and top of 

the jaws.  After the jaw crushing, the sample tray is thoroughly brushed out.  No 

crushing of samples was conducted during the December 2013 or July 2014 site 

visits; therefore, no vacuuming of this tray was observed.  Blank material is run 

through the crushers after every 10 samples, or after every sample if designated for 

fire assay.  Currently, there is no compressed air available to blow out dust from the 

crushers.  It is strongly recommended that an air compressor be introduced to 

thoroughly clean all sample preparation equipment. 

The crushed sample is systematically mixed on a metal-surfaced table using flat 

blades, and then manually quartered using a steel quadrant device (Figure 11.2).

Facilities

The operator then takes an approximately equal scoop from each quarter to fill the 

required sample bags.  The sample bags are weighed by the operator to ensure that a 

sufficient sample is taken.  The remaining (reject) sample is retained if the sample is 

designated for fire assay (Figure 11.3).  Other reject material is currently not retained, 

but it is recommended that all reject material be kept in the future.  The table is 

thoroughly brushed off between samples.  Compressed air is also recommended to 

clean the table for this stage of preparation.

The samples are sealed and accurately weighed, and the weight is recorded on the 

sampling list (Figure 11.4).  Samples for analysis are boxed and sealed, usually in 

batches by drillhole, for despatch to the laboratory concerned.

Boxed samples are checked against the sample list and a despatch note.  The exact 

sequence of sample numbers is listed as to the order in which the samples are to be 

processed at the laboratory.  This includes how the samples are to be processed, 

even if the numbers are not sequential.  Chain of custody documentation and a copy 

of the instructions are sent to the laboratory. 

11.1.1 LABORATORIES 

Prior to 2011, analysis was carried out at Russian certified Chemical Laboratory of 

the State Enterprise Aldangeologiya (Aldan Lab), located in Yakutia, Russia. 

Analysis for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 campaigns were completed by 

International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical 

Commission (IEC) 17025 accredited laboratory ALS Chemex in Chita, Russia. 

Both laboratories are wholly-independent of Silver Bear. 

11.1.2 ASSAYING 

Prior to 2011, the samples sent for fire assay were analysed in duplicate for silver.  

All samples were sent for fire assay.  Samples with significant silver grades, 

determined from spectral analysis were also analysed for silver, copper, lead, and 

zinc using atomic absorption (AA).  Samples sent for spectral analysis were analysed 

for 36 elements, including tin, lithium, titanium, cobalt, mercury, and vanadium. 

From 2011 onwards, analyses were completed using a four acid sample digestion of 

0.25 g, followed by ICP finish and reporting of 33 elements (laboratory code ME-

ICP62).  Where values of silver, lead or zinc exceeded the respective upper detection 

limits, further four acid digestion analyses were carried out of 0.4 g, followed by ICP 

finish (laboratory code ME-OG62).  Where values of silver exceeded the upper 

detection limit for ME-OG62 (1,500 g/t), a 50 g sample was taken for fire assay 

analyses with a gravimetric finish (laboratory code Ag-GRA22). 

A selection of the samples was identified by the Prognoz geologists for gold analysis.  

This was undertaken via fire assaying with an AA finish using a 50 g sample 

(laboratory code Au-AA24). 

Retained samples (duplicates and rejects) are boxed by drillhole number and stored 

in a locked container at the Endybal site.  Analytical results are received electronically 

and updated in the drillhole database. 

Assay certificates are submitted in electronic and hard copy form to the Project 

geologists. 

11.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 

Since 2007, Silver Bear has employed an industry standard quality assurance 

(QA)/quality control (QC) programme, which includes chain of custody protocols, as 

well as systematic submittals of standards, duplicates, and blank samples into the 

flow of samples sent for assaying.  Prior to 2007 the sampling procedures were 

consistent with the requirements of the Russian GKZ system.  No sample results prior 

to 2007 have been used in estimating the current Mineral Resource.

Technical Report and Resource Estimate of the

A continuous sample numbering system has been adopted by Silver Bear, which does 

not differentiate control samples.  Sample numbering is defined by the geologist for 

each hole as part of the sampling plan.  ALS Chemex also reported its own standards, 

duplicates, and blanks. 

The QA/QC programmes associated with the Vertikalny and Nizhny Endybal deposits 

are disclosed fully in Tetra Tech's 2015 Technical report.  Presented below is a 

summary of the QA/QC programme adopted for the Mangazeisky North deposits. 

11.2.1 MANGAZEISKY NORTH DEPOSITS QA/QC 

BLANKS 

Blanks have been inserted into the sample stream every 20th sample. 

Blank samples are created from local non-mineralised rock and processed in the on-

site sample preparation laboratory.  Blank material is stored on the ground outside of 

the sample preparation laboratory. 

Tetra Tech considers the QA/QC blank analysis programme to be adequate for the 

level of study. Six blanks have failed for silver grades of a total of 74 analyses, which 

is a 4% failure rate. These failures are typically low grade at 200, 58, 15, 18, 100, 55 

ppm respectively, and may be due to minor mineralisation, rather than any failure 

relating to poor practice. Tetra Tech recommends sourcing a true blank material to 

reduce the failure rate to zero. 

Figure 11.5 shows the Tetra Tech blank analysis for silver grades.

STANDARDS 

Standard reference materials are inserted on site into the sample stream in every 

batch every 20 samples.  Three reference materials sourced for the exploration 

campaign were provided by Geostats Pty Ltd.

In general, the results of the QA/QC analysis were excellent, with all of the standards 

falling within two standard deviations of the lab mean, indicating good calibration of 

the laboratory equipment and accurate results.  Table 11.1 summarises the 

reference materials used and shows the accuracy of the standards submitted. Figure

Tetra Tech considers the standard assessment for the Project has been robust.  Tetra 

Tech recommend continuing to monitor the standard performance over time to 

identify any drift. 

DUPLICATES 

Duplicate samples were inserted into the sample stream every 20 samples from the 

pulps.  No field duplicates were analysed.  In total 73 duplicates were assessed to 

date.

Figure 11.9  Pulp Duplicate Performance (log scale) 

 
Source: Tetra Tech 

Generally, duplicate performance was adequate, with minor failures.  It is apparent 

that most failures are at relatively low grades.  

Tetra Tech recommends changing the sampling of duplicates to focus on the 

mineralised intersections, where duplicate analyses will be more meaningful than 

analysing the waste that is inevitable on a set 20 sample interval. 

CONCLUSION 

Tetra Tech considers that the QA/QC programmes for drill core are suitable to support 

Mineral Resource estimation.  The number of samples assessed for QA/QC purposes 

is to industry best practice.  Tetra Tech recommends focusing the QA/QC programme 

toward the mineralised intersections in future campaigns.  Tetra Tech further 

recommends that core sample duplicates should be made by splitting two samples 

from the initial crushing cycle, as well as by splitting two samples from the pulped 

material. 

The trenching campaign completed in 2013 did not contain QA/QC samples, it is 

recommended that the trenches are re-sampled with the inclusion of QA/QC samples.

12.0  D ATA V ERIF ICATION  

12.1 TETRA TECH SITE VISIT 

Tetra Tech has conducted several site inspections over that last four years.  The most 

recent site visit to Mangazeisky North and Vertikalny was performed by Mr. Paul 

Daigle, P.Geo., Senior Geologist, in July 2014.  Prior to this, in November 2013, a site 

visit was made by Mr. Robert Davies, CGeol, EurGeol, Senior Resource Geologist for 

Tetra Tech. 

12.1.1 TETRA TECH, JULY 2014 

Mr. Daigle conducted a site visit to the Property between July 23 and July 25, 2014 

for three days.  At the time of the visit, drilling was being completed on Mangazeisky 

North and the drill rigs moved to the Vertikalny deposit.  

The site visit included an inspection of Hogan base camp, core logging and core 

storage facilities, drill core sampling preparation and sample rejects storage facilities.  

The Mangazeisky North and Vertikalny project sites and drill collar locations were 

inspected on this visit. 

Mr. Daigle was accompanied on the site visit by the following personnel: 

 Mr. Nick Vassenine, Project Manager for Silver Bear 

 Mrs. Lillia Vassenina, Field Technician for Silver Bear 

 Mr. Sergei Kraushkin, Chief Geologist for Prognoz. 

12.1.2 DRILLHOLE LOCATIONS 

The locations of several drillholes were measured for comparison with coordinates 

provided by Silver Bear.  Drillhole collar locations were verified using a hand-held 

GPS; Garmin™ GPSmap 62s.  The collar locations were found to be consistent with 

the DRM survey data, given GPS unit accuracy, the X and Y coordinates are within 

±6 m in X and Y (Table 12.1). 

Drillholes were marked by logs stuck into the drillhole.  The logs were marked with an 

aluminium tag bearing the drillhole number.  Recent drillholes were marked with the 

drillhole number in permanent marker  

At the time of the site visit, the drill program was still in progress on the Mangazeisky 

North deposit, with one drill completing the final drill holes for the Property.  Drill sites 

were left tidy and clear of debris.  The drill rig and material were then moved to the 

Vertikalny deposit.

12.1.3 INDEPENDENT CHECK SAMPLES 

Independent samples of the drill core were not collected by Tetra Tech on the most 

recent site visit, due to restrictions in Russia on travelling with core samples.  

However, one grab sample of massive galena was collected from Trench K-1322 at 

Mangazeisky North and sent to Actlabs in Ancaster, Ontario, for analysis.  The assay 

report returned a value of 4,170 g/t silver (Figure 12.1).

12.1.4 CORE LOGGING AND SAMPLING 

Upon receipt of all core boxes from any one drillhole, the core boxes were brought in 

and laid out on the core logging tables.  Drill core was then aligned; geotechnical 

logging was carried out first, followed by geological core logging.  Core logging was 

carried out or supervised by Mr. Vassenine.  Logging was either directly entered into 

the computer (GeoSpark database) or hand written and then transcribed into the 

GeoSpark database.  Core logging was mainly done in English and translated into 

Russian by Mrs. Vassenina.  If logging was carried out by the Russian geologists, it 

was later translated into English by Mrs. Vassenina. 

Sample intervals were marked in red and white grease pencil.  Mineralized zones 

were bracketed above and below by at least three 1-m sample intervals.  Sample tags 

were inserted at the beginning of the sample interval. 

Core boxes were then affixed with an aluminium tag with the drillhole number, 

interval of core, and box number and photographed.  Core boxes with sample tags 

were marked by blue or white flagging tape stapled to the side of the box and then 

stacked next to the sampling facility.  The other core boxes were stacked, by drillhole, 

under the core storage shelters. 

The logging facility was kept clean and tidy with sufficient lighting (Figure 12.2).

CORE SAMPLES 

Core splitting and sampling was carried out in batches as each drillholes or series of 

drillholes was completed.  Sample intervals were selected based upon observations 

of lithology/mineralogy through mineralized intercepts, generally with three 

systematic samples taken before and after mineralization.  Systematic samples were 

1 m in length. 

Sampling and QA/QC procedures were in place.  Standards, duplicates and blanks 

were inserted at regular intervals.  Drill core was split by pneumatic splitter where one 

half was placed in the sample bag with the sample tag and the other half was 

returned to the core box for storage.

STORAGE OF CORE AND SAMPLE PULPS 

All storage facilities at the Hogan camp were inspected.  Drill core from 2013 and 

2014 drill programs are stored under covered shelters adjacent to the core logging 

and sample preparation facilities.  The core boxes are stacked by drillhole number.  A 

new storage shelter was under construction at the time of the site visit (Figure 12.4).  

The core storage area is kept clean and tidy.

14.0  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES  

14.1 SUMMARY 

Tetra Tech completed a maiden resource estimate for the Mangazeisky North 

deposits, with an effective date of 3 June 2015.  The mineral resources have been 

estimated by Mr. Robert Davies, B.Sc., EurGeol, CGeol, and is the independent QP as 

defined by NI 43-101. 

This section also presents a restatement of the mineral resource for the Nizhny 

Endybal and Vertikalny deposits.  The effective date of the Vertikalny Central and 

Northwest Resource is 10 February 2015 and the effective date of the Nizhny 

Endybal Resource is 11 September 2012.  Mr. P. Gribble, FIMMM, C.Eng, former 

Senior Geologist at Tetra Tech is the independent QP who originally prepared the 

Nizhny Endybal Mineral Resource.  Mr. Davies is the independent QP who estimated 

the Vertikalny resources and has reviewed and verified the Nizhny Endybal Mineral 

Resource as current.  The Nizhny Endybal Resource has been re-stated using current 

cut-off grade assumptions to be consistent with the Mangazeisky North deposits.  

Further details of the Nizhny Endybal and Vertikalny Mineral Resources, estimated by 

Tetra Tech in 2012 and 2015, are publicly available and filed under the Silver Bear 

profile on the Canadian Security Administrators' SEDAR website. 

14.1.1 SUMMARY OF ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES 

Tetra Tech created mineralisation and oxidation wireframes using Surpac.  The 

wireframes were based upon sectional interpretations using both logging 

observations and grade intersections.  Block modelling and variography was also 

completed in Surpac. 

The silver grades were estimated using an OK interpolation methodology.  The density 

was applied to the blocks based upon a mean value from 17 density measurements. 

Statistical and grade continuity analyses were completed in order to characterise the 

mineralisation, and were subsequently used to develop grade interpolation 

parameters.  .  The search ellipsoid dimensions and orientations were chosen to 

reflect the continuity revealed by geostatistical studies.  Block size, discretisation, 

search size, and sample numbers were optimised using QKNA. 

Tetra Tech adopted the definition of mineral resources as outlined within the CIM 

Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM 2010) in order 

to classify the resources. 

In order to demonstrate that the deposit has reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction, a cut-off grade of 150 g/t was applied for the Mangazeisky North and 

Nizhny Endybal deposits, based upon the following assumptions:

 spot metal prices, effective 13 May 2015, of US$17/troy oz silver 

 mining cost of US$3.16/t 

 processing cost of US$50/t 

 general and administrative costs of US$12.50/t 

 transport costs, from pit to process plant, of $3.60/t 

 overall silver recovery of 85%. 

14.2 DATABASE 

Silver Bear provided Tetra Tech with its drilling and trenching databases, in the form 

of multiple comma-separated values (.csv) files.  The files include information on 

trenches and drillholes sampled during 2013 and 2014.  Relevant information 

includes collar/trench locations, downhole surveys, assay results, lithological logs, 

geotechnical logs, and density measurements.  Topography was provided as a 

wireframe in digital interchange format (.dxf).  The most recent data included in the 

estimate was received on 22 April 2015.  The database included 60 diamond 

drillholes and 51 trenches.  All of the drillholes were used for the grade interpolation. 

The trenches were used for the wireframe modelling, but not for the grade 

interpolation (see section 14.4.2). 

14.3 GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION 

The Mangazeisky deposit comprises a series of sub-parallel shallowly dipping 

stratiform epithermal veins.  The mineralization of Mangazeisky North is mainly 

associated with banded breccias texture and represented with siderite-sphalerite-

galena, quartz-pyrite-arsenopyrite, and ankerite-sulphosalts forming a silver rich 

polymetallic mineralisation. 

The veins inclined towards the east, generally dipping between 20° and 40°. The 

veins are strata-bound within argillite, siltstone and sandstone host rock. Veins occur 

on contacts between strata and tend to be dilated towards the hinge of the local fold 

structure.  It is noted that the strongest silver mineralisation occurs within the central 

core of the veins, this also correlates with the zones of strongest oxidation. 

14.4 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS/DOMAINING 

The overall mineralisation wireframe on Mangazeisky North (MN) has been 

subdivided into two domains.  The first domain (MN1) is a high-grade, highly-oxidised 

vein core.  The second domain (MN2) is the surrounding lower-grade fresh to 

moderately oxidised halo.  Mangazeisky South does not have the requisite oxidation 

logging to allow a high-grade domain to be differentiated; therefore a single 

estimation domain has been adopted (MS).  Exploratory data analysis for these zones 

is presented herein.

14.4.1 WIREFRAMING 

Initially sectional interpretations were developed based upon logging observations.  

The mineralised zone was logged as a distinct unit, forming the basis of the initial 

sectional interpretation.  The sectional interpretations were then reviewed against the 

assay results and in some areas revised to correctly capture the mineralised zones. 

Figure 14.1 presents the mineralisation wireframes used for the estimation. 

Figure 14.1 Mangazeisky North and South Wireframes 

 

In addition to the wireframes representing the mineralised structure, Tetra Tech also 

generated wireframes representing the strong oxidized material for the Mangazeisky 

North deposit.  Where the strongly oxidized material was located within the 

mineralised veins, the highest silver grades were located.  The strongly oxidized 

wireframes were used to domain the Mangazeisky North mineralised structure.  Sub-

domaining of the Mangazeisky South structure was not possible due to a lack of 

oxidation logging.  Various statistical analyses of the data were performed, and are 

documented in this section.

Notes: DD – Diamond drillholes

This increase in grade could be associated with mechanical enrichment at surface; 

however, the trench sampling also had insufficient QA/QC sampling, therefore the 

validity of the data and cause of the bias could not be established.  For this reason, 

the trench sampling was ommitted from the resource estimation.

14.4.4 SAMPLE LENGTH AND COMPOSITING 

There is a moderate correlation between grade and sample length, with some of the 

very high grades found within short samples of less than 0.8 m (Figure 14.3).

Contact plots were created in order to help validate the high-grade and low-grade 

domains.  Figure 14.4 illustrates the contact plots between high grade and low grade, 

and between low-grade domains for Mangazeisky North.  The contact plots support 

the conclusion that the domains represent separate statistical populations, and that 

they can be differentiated for estimation using hard boundaries.

A length weighted compositing routine has been employed to ensure that the short, 

high-grade samples do not have undue influence on the grade interpolation.  Sample 

length frequencies were analysed using a histogram (Figure 14.5).  A composite 

length of 1 m was chosen based on its abundance and best representation in the 

sample set.  Compositing was completed in Surpac™ using a 1-m best fit routine, 

applying hard domain boundaries.

14.4.6 TOP CUTS 

Very high grades form a genuine part of the sample population; therefore, it was 

preferable to limit top cutting to avoid smoothing silver values within the true high-

grade pockets of mineralisation.  The raw silver assays for the high-grade domain

were analysed using a log probability plot and histogram (Table 14.7 and Table 14.8).  

An inflection point was noted at approximately 2,000 g/t.  Compositing was 

performed prior to top cutting in order to reduce the high-grade burden organically.  

The 2,000 g/t threshold was chosen and applied to the composites from domain 

MN1.  This top cut only affected three composites.  

MN2 and MS present a single population with no particular outliers, therefore no top 

cutting was necessary.

14.5 DENSITY 

Silver Bear provided specific gravity measurements from selected holes from the 

2014 drilling programme.  In total, 17 measurements were undertaken on core 

samples from 15 different drillholes.  The samples were all from Mangazeisky North, 

and represented several different veins.  A histogram presenting the spread of 

density results is presented in Figure 14.9.

14.6 VARIOGRAPHY 

Variography was completed in in Surpac™ version 6.6.2.   Experimental variograms 
were produced using drillhole composite data.  Variograms were initially developed in 

plan view, with the strike, dip and plunge established independently thereafter.  The 

nugget value has been established from a downhole variogram.  The modelled 

structures were used to establish the variogram structures to be utilised within the 

kriging estimation (Figure 14.10 and Figure 14.11).

Variogram parameters were established for the Mangazeisky North deposit, using all 

selected samples.  The Mangazeisky South deposit has insufficient sample numbers 

to allow an independent variography to be completed.  However, the Mangazeisky 

South deposit is a strike continuation of the same structure; therefore, the 

Mangazeisky North variography was adopted for the Mangazeisky South grade 

interpolation. 

14.7 RESOURCE BLOCK MODELS 

Two separate block models were constructed in Surpac™, one for the Mangazeisky 

North and a second for Mangazeisky South.  The block model parameters are shown 

in Table 14.7 and Table 14.8.

estimation.  Table 14.9 presents a comparison of the block model and wireframe 

volumes.

14.7.1 INTERPOLATION STRATEGY 

Grades were estimated using OK, adopting a multi-pass methodology.  The kriging 

employed the variogram parameters as presented in Section 14.6.  Each of the 

domains was estimated independently. 

QKNA was used to optimise the block size, the number of informing samples, 

discretisation, and search distances used in the estimation. 

Quantitative measures of the kriging performance (e.g. slope of regression, kriging 

efficiency, kriging variance, block variance, proportion of negative weights) were used 

to test the appropriateness and optimise the kriging parameters.  The analysis was 

carried out on large representative portions of the block model, as well as on isolated 

test blocks.  Where test blocks were used, these were chosen as examples of one 

well informed block and one poorly informed block. 

The estimation parameters were defined for Mangazeisky North and then applied to 

both Mangazeisky North and South deposits.  A summary of the estimation strategy is 

show in Table 14.10.

14.8 BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 

Block model validation was completed using graphical and statistical methods, to 

confirm that the estimated block model grades appropriately reflect the local 

composite grades. 

The graphical analysis demonstrated appropriate correlation between composite and 

block grades, with the anisotropic directionality noted in the variography reflected in 

the grade distribution. 

A comparison was made between the informing composites and the estimated block 

grades using a range of statistical measures.  Table 14.11 presents a comparison

A number of the measures indicate a reduction in variance.  This is a result of the 

change of support associated with the estimation process and the kriging 

interpolation.  The grade distribution and mean values are also maintained.  Overall, 

the statistics present good conformance. 

14.8.1 SWATH PLOTS 

Swath plots have been used to assess the differences and similarities between the 

OK block estimate silver grade and the informing composite grades (Figure 14.12 

and Figure 14.13).

The swath plots present good conformance between informing composites and 

estimated block grades. 

14.8.2 CONCLUSION 

The various comparators described in the foregoing subsections serve to illustrate 

that the block model estimate is robust and satisfactorily models the distribution and 

variability of the informing sample grades without undue bias or smoothing.  It is 

suitable for the current level of study. 

14.9 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

The resource model was classified according to CIM Definition Standards on Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM 2010). 

All of the mineral resources within the Mangazeisky North and South deposits have 

been classified as Inferred.  The grade can be estimated on the basis of geological 

evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological 

and grade continuity. 

14.10 MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION 

14.10.1 CUT-OFF GRADES 

In order to demonstrate that the deposit has reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction, a cut-off grade of 150 g/t has been applied based on the following 

assumptions: 

 spot metal prices, effective 13 May 2015, of US$17/troy oz silver 

 mining cost of US$3.16/t 

 processing cost of US$50/t 

 general and administrative costs of US$12.50/t 

 transport costs, from pit to process plant, of $3.60/t 

 overall silver recovery of 85%. 

It is assumed that the deposits will be developed with the Vertikalny deposit and will 

therefore share general and administrative costs. 

14.10.2 MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION 

The updated mineral resource for the Mangazeisky North deposit is summarised in

14.10.4 SUMMARY OF PROPERTY MINERAL RESOURCES 

In order to maintain the Nizhny Endybal resource as a current resource, Tetra Tech 

has re-stated the resource at a cut-off of 150 g/t silver, to be consistent with the 

Mangazeisky North deposits. Previously the Nizhny Endybal resource was reported 

using a cut-off of 75 g/t, based upon a US$22/troy oz silver price.  The new cut-off is 

based upon the same criteria as the open pit cut-off outlined above for the 

Mangazeisky deposits. 

Table 14.15 presents as summary of all current mineral resources on the Property 

including the revised Nizhny Endybal Mineral Resource.

INFORMATION  

This technical report contains no formal disclosure relating to: 

 mineral reserves 

 mining methods 

 project infrastructure 

 market studies and contracts 

 capital and operating costs 

 economic analysis. 

The 2014 PEA (Tetra Tech 2014) covers some of these items in relation to the 

Vertikalny deposit.  Silver Bear has retained Tetra Tech as the lead consultant to 

complete a feasibility study for the Project, in which studies relating to the above six 

items will be fully disclosed.  The feasibility study is scheduled to be complete in the 

Q3 2015. 

There is no additional information or explanation necessary to ensure that the

17.0  INTERP RETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  

Tetra Tech has reviewed and audited all the exploration data for the Mangazeisky 

North deposit, and is of the opinion that the exploration work carried out by Silver 

Bear has generally been completed using procedures that are consistent with 

recognised industry best practices, and the data is suitable for resource estimation. 

The 2014 drilling campaign completed on the Mangazeisky North deposits provided 

sufficient data to allow the grade to be estimated, and to reasonably assume, but not 

verify, geological and grade continuity.  

In Tetra Tech's opinion, the established understanding of the geological and grade 

continuity is sufficient to support the classification of the mineral resources as 

Inferred, as presented in this report. 

In order to demonstrate that the deposit has reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction, a cut-off grade of 150 g/t was applied based on the following 

assumptions: 

 spot metal prices, effective 13th May 2015, of US$17/troy oz silver 

 mining cost of US$3.16/t 

 processing cost of US$50/t 

 general and administrative costs of US$12.50/t 

 transport costs, from pit to process plant, of $3.60/t 

 overall silver recovery of 85%. 

Tetra Tech assumes that the deposits will be developed with the Vertikalny deposit, 

and will therefore share general and administrative costs. 

The total Inferred Resource for the Mangazeisky North deposit is 550,000 t, with an 

average silver grade of 444 g/t.  There are no Measured or Indicated Resources in 

either Mangazeisky North or South at this stage. 

Tetra Tech is not aware of any material risks associated with the development of the 

Mangazeisky North deposits, or the wider Project area.  As part of the feasibility study 

currently underway for the Vertikalny deposit, detailed technical matters are being 

investigated and mitigated, some of which will apply to Mangazeisky North.  The 

Vertikalny feasibility study is anticipated to be completed in Q4 2015.

18.0  RECOMMENDATIONS  

Tetra Tech recommends the following two phases of work at Mangazeisky North: 

 Phase 1 – infill drilling programme  

 Phase 2 – preliminary metallurgical test work. 

The infill drilling programme is needed to further develop both grade and geological 

continuity of the deposits.  The metallurgical test work will further the understanding 

of the mineralisation, supporting the future conversion from resource to reserve. 

Advancing to Phase 2 is not contingent on the results of Phase 1. 

18.1 PHASE 1 - INFILL DRILLING PROGRAMME 

Infill drilling should be considered initially to better understand, and further develop, 

the close range variability in the grade distribution.  It is anticipated that this work will 

sufficiently increase the geological confidence to allow the resource classification to 

be improved.  Once the resource is classified as Indicated or better, reserve 

estimates can be undertaken, allowing the potential revenues from the deposit to be 

included in the financial analysis of the Project. 

Infill drilling may close some of the gaps between existing pierce points and join 

isolated mineralisation.  This has the potential to add additional resources by 

targeting holes in line with the current grade distribution. 

18.1.1 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Tetra Tech recommends a proposed drilling campaign of approximately 2,400 m of 

drilling at Mangazeisky North.  This campaign consists primarily of infill drilling, with 

some limited additional strike and depth exploration.  The recommended programme 

targets gaps in the current resource and has the potential to significantly add to the 

understanding of the deposit, and to add to the resource base. 

Figure 18.1, shows the proposed locations of infill drillholes targeting areas of poor 

interpolation.  The figure presents the Mangazeisky North deposit highlighting the 

body by Kriging Efficiency.  Preference for the proposed drillholes is given to those 

areas which are currently understood to be of higher grade, based on the existing 

drilling results.

Figure 18.1 Initial Drilling Proposals – Mangazeisky North 

 
Note: Perspective view looking southwest (240° Az); drill sections at roughly 25 m spacing 

It is recommended that approximately 20% of the dill core samples associated with 

the infill drilling campaign are subjected to density measurements.  These 

measurements should be undertaken for examples of all lithologies and a range of 

silver grades, including barren host rock.  Density measurements for host rock could 

become important as the deposit is advanced into reserve estimation and mine 

planning. 

18.2 PHASE 2 - METALLURGICAL TEST WORK 

Tetra Tech recommends that preliminary metallurgical work is undertaken to 

characterize and further the understanding of the mineralisation at Mangazeisky 

North.  This test work would aim to provide a first pass indication of the 

mineralisation's amenability to cyanide leaching, as well as a qualitative indication of 

oxidation state, which in turn will inform future test work and allow a comparison with 

the Vertikalny deposit's metallurgical behaviour. 

18.2.1 METALLURGICAL TEST WORK SAMPLE SELECTION PROCESS 

Silver Bear has already initiated the following programme of work.  It is anticipated 

that the programme will be completed within Q4 of 2015. 

Tetra Tech selected fourteen samples within the zone of mineralisation described by 

the Tetra Tech wire frame model.  Trenches were excluded from the selection on the 

basis that they were currently not reliable for mineral resource estimation. 

Only samples in a silver head grade range from 300 to 1,800 ppm silver were 

considered.

The final selection of fourteen samples was made on a random interval basis, 

ensuring that all relevant lithology and oxide states were represented by at least one 

sample.  Care was taken to not over-represent minor lithological groups or oxide 

states. 

The final sample selection is shown in Table 18.1.  Tetra Tech recommends that 

Silver Bear uses coarse rejects generated during sample preparation for the 

geological assays as a source of material.

Note: All of the samples are diamond drill core.  Some samples are split across lithological 
 boundaries.  

Once the selection was made, the samples spatial distribution was assessed by 

recording the sample selection back to the drilling database, and visualising the 

results in mining software.  The result is a good representation along strike and 

reasonable representation along the depth considering that the deposit is primarily a 

single main structure with depth limited by drilling. 

Where appropriate the minor structures are also included in the selection, as shown 

in Figure 18.2.

18.2.2 RECOMMENDED METALLURGICAL CHARACTERISATION TESTS AND ANALYSIS 

The following metallurgical laboratory analysis is required for each sample: 

 head assays: 

 silver, gold, (fire assay) in duplicate 

 lead, zinc, copper, arsenic, antimony, iron (wet chemistry, atomic 

absorption or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS)) 

 sodium oxide (Na2O), potassium oxide (K2O), calcium oxide (CaO), 

magnesium oxide (MgO), aluminium oxide (Al2O3), iron oxide (Fe2O3), 

silicon dioxide (SiO2) (ICP) 

 STOT, S
2-, SO42- (LECO) 

 CTOT, COrg (LECO) 

 silver cyanide extraction tests under the following conditions: 

 grind P80 75 µm 

 solids concentration 40% (m/m) 

 pre-aeration 8 h 

 pH to be maintained at 11.5 with lime 

 cyanide
- concentration to be maintained at 2 g/l 

 dissolved oxygen saturation under laboratory conditions to be 

maintained at all times by provision of air/oxygen 

 leach time 120 h, not less than 72 h, samples to be taken at 2 h, 4 h, 

8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h and 120 h; silver extraction, cyandie and 

calcium oxide consumptions to be reported for each time interval 

 tails silver assays by fire assay in duplicate 

 test temperature to be noted 

 extractions to be reported based on calculated and assayed heads 

 extraction test tails re-leach; tails to be re-leached after first filtering and 

washing: 

 pH maintained at 11.5 

 cyanide
- maintained at 2 g/l

 DO2 saturation to be maintained 

 leach time 24 h 

 silver extraction after 24 h to be reported 

 tails silver fire assay in duplicate 

 extractions to be reported based on calculated and assayed head. 

In addition to the metallurgical characterisation tests outlined above, Tetra Tech also 

recommends that density determinations are completed for all of the samples.  The 

additional density data will inform future mineral resource estimates and will help 

support any subsequent improvements in resource classification.  Tetra Tech 

recommends non-destructive density determinations by Archimedes' method on the 

remaining half core.   

18.3 INDICATIVE COSTS 

18.3.1 PHASE 1 – INFILL DRILLING 

Tetra Tech estimates that the proposed drill programme will cost approximately 

Cdn$1,200,000 based on a drill program of 2,400 m, at an all-inclusive cost of 

Cdn$500/m drilled.  

18.3.2 PHASE 2 – METALLURGICAL TEST WORK 

The preliminary metallurgical test work programme will cost in the range of 

Cdn$40,000 to $50,000 in country.  A study to analyse these findings would carry an 

additional time and materials cost.
