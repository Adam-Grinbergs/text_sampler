Executive Summary 
The Frog's Leg gold deposit is located 20 kilometres (km) west of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 
and is part of the Mungari East Joint Venture agreement between Dioro Exploration NL (Dioro) 
and La Mancha Resources Inc (LMR).  Dioro holds 49% of the project, and is a public company 
listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. LMR is a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange 
holds; it holds 51% of the project, and is the operator.  Frog's Leg is currently being developed as 
an underground mine. 

Dioro is also part to the Lake Greta Joint Venture, which comprises two tenements (E15/634 and 
M15/1408) immediately north of and adjoining the Mungari East JV tenements.  Barrick Gold 
Corporation holds 50% of this JV, with Dioro (24.5%) and LMR (25.5%). 

The Mungari East Joint Venture consists of six mining leases (M15/688, M15/689, M15/836, 
M15/837, M15/1188 and M15/1287), two prospecting leases (P15/4676 and P15/4677) and one 
miscellaneous licence - (L15/246) totalling 3,304.47Ha, with lease M15/688 containing the pit and 
project infrastructure.  On these tenements environmental bonds totalling A$916,000 have been 
lodged.  A 2.5% net smelter return royalty is payable to the state of Western Australia.  The project 
is easily accessed by road and may be operated for twelve months of the year.  Elevation is 
approximately 340 metres (m) above sea level.  Terrain consists of salt lakes, salt flats, dunes and 
low ridges underlain by transported alluvium and lacustrine clay.   

The Frog's Leg deposit was discovered by air-core drilling in late 1999, followed by diamond 
drilling in January 2000.  The discovery was preceded by an extensive geochemical sampling 
program following previous discoveries to the north (Rubicon, Pegasus and Hornet deposits).  In 
total, 161,471m in 2,429 holes have been drilled to date with 24% of the drill metres consisting of 
RC drilling, 5% RAB, 45% diamond core and 26% aircore.  A technical-commercial study was 
completed in 2002 by previous operators Mines and Resources Australia (MRA).  Open pit 
production began in April 2004 and the first gold was poured in July 2004.  Mining in the open pit 
was terminated in October 2005 with the last of the ore treated during fourth quarter 2005.  The 
property remained on a care and maintenance basis since that time.  In 2006, LMR began a 
significant diamond drilling program, in order to define potential resources for an underground 
mining operation. 

The open-pit operation minimized capital requirements by using a mining contractor, who supplied 
personnel and equipment, and by trucking ore to the Greenfields toll mill in the Coolgardie area 
26km to the southwest.  Mining infrastructure was minimal as the operation was run from the 
White Foil facilities, which included offices, workshop, wash bay and access roads.  A second open 
pit at White Foil, 2km to the southwest of Frog's Leg, was exploited during 2002 to 2003 by 
previous operator Mines and Resources Australia (MRA).   

During eighteen months of production 832,976t of Frog's Leg ore was milled at a head grade of 
4.50g/t.  Recovered gold totalled 116,611 ounces (oz) (96.8% overall recovery).  Dioro's net share 
of production totalled 57,139oz.  The mined material consisted primarily of steeply-dipping quartz 
lodes located within the Rocket zone footwall, immediately east of the contact structure between 
the "catrock" basalt and volcanoclastic units. 

The Frog's Leg deposit occurs in the southern portion of the Kundana mining district in the 
Norseman Wiluna Belt of the Eastern Goldfields Province, in the Archean-aged Yilgarn Craton.  
The Norseman-Wiluna granite-greenstone belt extends for 600km in a NNW direction and it hosts 
a globally-significant number of gold and nickel sulphide deposits.  The Kundana mining camp 
generally hosts gold mineralisation in quartz lodes and veins, structurally emplaced within shale 
horizons and/or along lithology contacts.  There are several significant operating or closed gold 
mines in the Kundana district, including Strzelecki, Barkers, and the Raleigh South and North Pits.

Frog's Leg mineralisation occurs in a number of structural styles along a nine-hundred metre-long 
NNW-trend. Mineralisation occurs as sub-vertical, tabular lodes along a faulted 
volcanoclastic/catrock basalt contact, which is divided into six zones referred to as Mist, Fog, 
Marsh and Bull to the north, and Rocket and Whistle to the south.  Quartz lode mineralisation 
occurs within the volcanoclastic footwall east of the contact zone as somewhat irregular vein 
structures dipping towards the west into the sub-vertical contact zone.  Less frequently quartz vein 
structures occur on the hanging wall side of the contact.  These include the Fog lode, situated west 
of the Mist contact zone, and Whistle, west of Rocket.  Structural styles and differences in rock 
properties play a major role in gold deposition. For example, competency contrasts between more 
and less brittle rocks influence the formation of gold-hosting quartz veins during deformation, and 
the variable iron content in different host rocks influences the chemical precipitation of gold from 
ore fluids. 

The latest June 2007 global resource estimate LMR is shown in Table 0-1.  Measured and indicated 
resources total 3,221,000t at an average grade of 7.0g/t for a contained gold resource of 723,000oz.  
Dioro's 49%-attributable share is 354,270oz.

and Inferred Resources at a 3.5g/t cut-off,

Inferred 1,136,000 5.7 209,000 

 

The June 2007 resource estimate includes new information from 35 diamond core holes, totalling 
14,998.52m that were drilled from October 2006 through May 2007.  The new measured and 
indicated resource estimate represents an increase of 130% in tonnes and 96% in ounces, compared 
to the measured and indicated resources from the last publicly-released estimate of April 2007.  
This increase is due to two main factors: 1) infill drilling that converted large zones of inferred 
resources to indicated resources and 2) re-interpretations of the shapes and boundaries of the Frog's 
Leg lodes and the gold mineralisation associated with them. 

Test-work on Frog's Leg ore samples has been relatively comprehensive, with samples derived 
from both drill core and bulk samples on representative material from the lodes.  The recovery used 
by the Feasibility Study was a weighted average (according to ore sources) of 94.9%.  Throughput 
and recovery will be dependent on blending schedules, mine plans and plant operating variables 
being maintained.  SRK considers this to be a reasonable base assumption for assessing the 
economics of the Frog' Leg deposit given that the majority of the deposit is from the 'Mist' Lode 
which has demonstrated slightly higher recovery of 96%. 

Dioro plans to process its share of ore from Frog's Leg at its Jubilee Processing Facility ("JMP").  
The Jubilee flowsheet is suitable for processing of the Frog's Leg underground ore due to the ore's 
free milling nature and amenability to gravity recovery.  

The Frog's Leg deposit will be mined by means of an underground decline.  The 2007 Definitive 
Feasibility Study (DFS) indicates an average production rate of 545,000t per annum at full 
capacity.  The average grade is 5.29g/t.  The ore will be produced by means of Longhole Open 
Stoping with fill.  The high in situ stress environment and the competent rock quality result in a 
seismically active mining environment.  This seismicity risk is being minimised by adopting a

'bottom up' mining sequence/retreat front which systematically pushes the stress field and requires 
the completion of most of the pre-mining development prior to stope extraction.

Project NPV @ 12.0% A$53.6M  A$77.3M  

IRR 47.5%  --  
** The Project Evaluation is based on a processing cost of A$19/t plus A$6/t transportation.  Dioro's component of the 
production will be processed through their own plant at a cost of A$13/t plus A$6/t transportation costs.  This equates to a 
A$6/t savings on 49% of the mine tonnage which is not reflected in the table above. 

An assessment of the 2007 DFS indicates that a gold price of A$845/oz results in a cumulative 
non-discounted Cash Flow of A$100.9 Million over a mine life of 7.5 years.  The cash cost to 
recover one ounce of gold is estimated to be A$674.  With a discount rate of 12% the project's 
NPV is A$53.56 Million.  As one third of the capital expenditure will have been spent by the 
31 December 2007 and assuming this A$22.3 Million is categorised as sunk costs the resulting 
NPV going forward from January 2008 is A$77.3 Million.  The project carries an IRR of 47.5%.  
This project assessment is based on the 2007 Definitive Feasibility Study which includes only 
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource. This is the part of the Resource considered to be 
estimated with sufficient confidence geologically to have economic considerations applied to it.

4 Introduction 
SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd (SRK) has been commissioned by Dioro Exploration NL 
(Dioro) to provide an independent technical assessment of the Frog's Leg gold deposit near 
Kundana in the Eastern Goldfields Province of the Archean Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia.  
This Independent Technical Assessment (Report) conforms to the requirements of National Policy 
Instrument 43-101, and is to be used by Dioro to support its application to trade on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange (TSX) and the filing of a prospectus with certain of the Canadian securities 
regulatory authorities. 

4.1 Terms of Reference 

SRK has been commissioned by Dioro to act as Independent Qualified Person (QP) and to prepare 
a Technical Report in accordance with the National Instrument Form 43-101F1. 

SRK's Technical Report has been prepared in relation to Dioro's intended listing on the TSX in

4.2 Information sources 

The present report updates the previous NI43-101 report "The Frog's Leg Project, Geological and 
Technical Description" prepared for LMR by SRK.    

In particular, the geological section relies on the description contained in that report and prepared 
by Mr John Jenks, geologist and, at the time, member of the LMR Board of Directors. 

The updated resource estimation in the present report is due to Mr Trevor Eddie, LMR Resources, 
with the assistance of Mr David Williams, CSA Australia Pty Ltd.   

Mr Daniel Guibal of SRK has reviewed the updated resource.  He is familiar with the deposit, 
which he visited in 2004, from previous independent reviews and audits of MRA's resource 
statements. 

The Reserves were estimated by LMR, as part of the 2007 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and 
reviewed by Mr Gary MacSporran of SRK.

6 Property Description and Location 
6.1 Location 

The Frog's Leg project is situated in the state of Western Australia 20km west of the mining 
community of Kalgoorlie/Boulder (Figure 6-1) and 28km northeast of the small town of Coolgardie 
(Lat: 30º 46' South - Long: 121º16'East).  Ore from the now completed Frog's Leg open pit was 
transported to Coolgardie for processing at the Greenfield's custom mill.  Frog's Leg forms part of 
the Mungari East Joint Venture. 

These projects' locations are shown in Figure 6-2, which presents the regional tenement holding of 
Dioro projects, and other major deposits in the region.

Figure 6-2:  Location of Frog's Leg in relation to Dioro's other major projects in the Kalgoorlie region 

 

6.2 Mining Claim Description 

The Mungari East Joint Venture consists of six mining leases (M15/688, M15/689, M15/836, 
M15/837, M15/1188 and M15/1287), two prospecting leases (P15/4676 and P15/4677) and one 
miscellaneous license - (L15/246) totalling 3,304.47 hectares (Ha), with lease M15/688 containing 
the pit and project infrastructure (Figure 6-3 and Table 6-1).  An agreement with neighbouring 
tenement holders (the West Kalgoorlie JV) facilitates encroachment on the western portion of an 
adjacent tenement, M15/1407 for purposes of constructing infrastructure for the open pit, however, 
underground mining would not be permitted.

SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 6 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

Dioro is also part to the Lake Greta Joint Venture, which comprises two tenements (E15/634 and 
M15/1408) immediately north of and adjoining the Mungari East JV tenements.  Barrick Gold 
Corporation holds 50% of this JV, with Dioro (24.5%) and LMR (25.5%). E15/634 is 51.53Ha, and 
M15/1408 is 79.95Ha. 

Dioro is also 90% partner of the Pokai Joint Venture which comprises P15/3801 (148Ha) and 
P15/3800 (96Ha). The Pokai tenements are also a combined application for a Mining tenement 
application M15/1306 covers the Pokai prospecting licences.  The mining application requires 
resolution of a native title claim prior to grant but exploration can continue as the underlying 
prospecting licence is still current. 

Located within the Shire (county) of Coolgardie and in the Coolgardie Mineral Field #15 as 
defined by the Department of Industry and Resources (DoIR), the area is currently subject to one 
native title claim with the Widji People: WC 98/27.

6.3 Ownership of Mineral Rights 

The Frog's Leg deposit is held by the Mungari East Joint Venture - 51% owned by LMR 
Resources, the project operator, and 49% by Dioro.  

6.4 Mineral Royalties 

A royalty of 2.5% of the net smelter return is payable to the State of Western Australia.  No 
additional royalties are payable to other parties. To the best of our knowledge, the properties are 
not subject to any back-in rights, payments or other agreements and encumbrances. 

6.5 Permits  

The project involves the six mining tenements listed above with tenement conditions falling under 
jurisdiction of the DoIR.  Conditions of use are attached to each tenement including environmental 
bonds of $911,000 for tenements M15/688,, M15/1407 and L15/246.  Additionally, a bond of 
$5000 is lodged for adjacent tenement M15/1287.  The bonds for M15/688, M15/1407 and 
L15/246 were reviewed as part of approval of the Mining Proposal in July 2007 and are unlikely to

significantly increase in the short term.  All operations must be conducted in accordance with five 
Notices of Intent (NoI) that have been submitted in relation to these tenements. 

Operating licence, or NOI, for underground development has been approved by the DoIR.  It will 
not differ from the current licence issued for the open pit under Category 6 (mine dewatering) and 
Category 64 (putrescible waste) of the Environmental Protection Act Regulations 1987.  The 
operating license will be re-applied for each year.  The Project Management Plan (PMP) has been 
prepared and approved. 

The current open pit license covers mine dewatering, putrescible landfill, fuel storage and 
emergency notification while the operating license will cover Department of Environment incident 
reporting, annual environmental reporting, dust control, water quality and volume monitoring, 
transfer pond capacity, transfer pipeline safeguards and maintenance, hydrocarbon storage and 
control and solid waste control. 

The above items must be reported upon at regular intervals ranging from a daily basis to every five 
years.  LMR has permitting and licensing arrangements well in hand and no undue delays are 
anticipated in these areas.

7 Access, Climate, Local Resources, and 
Infrastructure 

7.1 Access 

The project is easily accessible west from Kalgoorlie via 12km of the paved Great Eastern 
Highway and then northerly along the well-maintained Kundana Mines gravel haulage road to the 
Frog's Leg access road.  Qantas Airlines runs regularly-scheduled daily flights to and from Perth, 
the state capital.  Driving time from Perth to Kalgoorlie is seven hours over a distance of 600km.  
Passenger train service from Perth requires a similar travel time.   

7.2 Climate, Vegetation and Physiography: 

Climate permits exploration and mining activities to be carried out over twelve months of the year.  
Climatic particulars are given in Table 7-1 as follows: 

Table 7-1:  Maximum Averages - Monthly Temperatures  
and Rainfall; Kalgoorlie Area  

Period Max Av Temp(ºC) 
Av Monthly Rainfall 

(mm) 

Winter (June-Aug) 18.4 25.7 
Spring (Sept-Nov) 28.9 15.7 
Summer (Dec-Feb) 30.9 23.1 
Fall (Mar-May) 29.5 24.7 

(Source: Bureau of Meteorology – Kalgoorlie/Boulder airport) 

Minimum mean temperatures in the order of 5ºC occur in July while the maximum mean of 33.5ºC 
occurs in January. 

The climate is semi-desert Mediterranean.  Nine to eleven months are dry, February being the 
driest month.  Rain may fall in any month of the year.  Occasional cyclonic episodes may produce 
vast quantities of rainfall over short time periods.   

The typically flat terrain is made up of dry or shallow salt lakes, proximal salt flats, sand dunes and 
low ridges.  Sparse vegetation consists of scattered low bushes and bunch grass with much of the 
surface devoid of any type of vegetation.  Most areas are vehicle-accessible except following rare 
periods of heavy storms when flooding may occur.  Rock outcrop is scarce.  Surface elevation at 
the pit area is 340m above sea level. 

Much of the overburden consists of transported material to depths up to 35m comprising surface 
alluvium over lacustrine clays.  The water table is shallow – often at depths of 5m.  Its high salinity 
makes ground water toxic to vegetation.   

7.3 Local Resources 

Kalgoorlie/Boulder, a mining town with a population base of 30,000-40,000, is the major supply 
centre for the Frog's Leg operation.  Proximity and mining tradition makes it a convenient source 
of supplies, parts, and equipment while providing access to a mining-skilled work force. The 
project employs staff based in Kalgoorlie and maintains a rented house in town for accommodation 
of exploration crews, storage and office space. 



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 9 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

The Greenfields mill is near the town of Coolgardie, 28km southwest of the project, and was used 
to process all of the open pit ore from the Frog's Leg deposit on a toll basis.  The degree of mining 
infrastructure within this general area results in a number of properties being economic that would 
not be possible in many other locations. 

Frog's Leg is also located within the 60km trucking radius from the Jubilee Mill, owned by Dioro, 
and Dioro plans to process at a minimum, its share of Frog's Leg ore at the Jubilee Mill (see Figure 
6-2). 

Potable water is pumped to the Kalgoorlie area via a pipeline originating east of Perth – a distance 
of approximately 500km. 

7.4 Infrastructure 

The Mungari Station area in and around the project is sparsely populated with no aboriginal 
communities in or near the project area.  Existing mine infrastructure at the Frog's Leg mine site 
consists of offices, contractor yards, access roads and dewatering equipment for the pit.  Power is 
provided by diesel generators.  A Western Power 33kV power transmission line located 8km north 
of the project provides a power option for future mining activity. 

A trans-national rail line passes 8km south of the property.

Post-discovery drilling is summarised in Table 13-1. 

The discovery was preceded by an extensive geochemical sampling program spurred by prior 
discoveries immediately to the north (Rubicon, Pegasus and Hornet deposits) by Gilt-Edged 
Mining NL. 

Aircore drilling by MRA in December 1999 yielded anomalous results including 14m at 2.00g/t, 
5m at 3.99g/t and 15m at 2.14g/t Au.  This was followed up by an RC drilling program in January 
2000.  The initial discovery holes drilled during this program included the following mineralised 
intervals: 8m at 3.03g/t in the contact zone, 5m at 15.13g/t and 16m at 5.6g/t in the quartz lode.   

Definition drilling was followed by a series of resource estimates in 2000 and 2001 and an open pit 
feasibility study in 2002.  Licensing and permitting was completed in 2003 along with another 
resource estimate.  Open pit pre-stripping began in April 2004 with the first ore mined in June 
2004; the first gold was poured in July 2004.  Open pit operations terminated on October 4, 2005 
and ore milling was completed during the final quarter of 2005. 

An in-house technical-economical study on an underground operation was carried out in June 2004 
and later updated in February 2005.  Since this time, numerous in-house and publicly reported 
Resource and Reserve estimates have been undertaken by several companies.  The details are 
summarized in Table 8-2.

9 Geological Setting 
9.1 Regional Geology and Gold Mineralisation  

Gold production in Western Australia started in the late 19th Century and over 2,000t of gold have 
been mined from over 2,000 mainly small deposits.  Over 50% of the production has come from 
the Kalgoorlie area.  Of the large deposits exceeding 2t in size most have come from Archean 
granitoid-greenstone terranes of the Yilgarn Craton.  Within the Yilgarn Craton, 14 deposits have 
surpassed 20t of gold while 25 deposits contain current reserves exceeding 10 tonnes.  Of these one 
of the largest, the Golden Mile, jointly owned by Barrick and Newmont, produces 800,000oz of 
gold per year in a 230,000 tpd operation from the Super-Pit.  In the area, early mining concentrated 
on high-grade lodes averaging 40g/t, but average grade has diminished over the years to the more 
common 4 to 9g/t range for today's underground operations and less than 5g/t for open pits – the 
latter frequently between 1.5 to 2g/t. 

 

Figure 9-1:  Geological Setting Dioro Projects 

 

On a regional scale structure is the single most important factor controlling ore deposit distribution and geometry of ore 
shoots which are generally adjacent to trans-craton deformation zones.  On the mining scale gold mineralisation tends to be 
situated in shorter strike-length, smaller scale structures geometrically-related to the larger structures, reflecting later 
movement on these trans-craton deformation zones.  Different mineralisation styles reflect strength contrasts between 
different adjacent rock types which in turn affect variations in orientation of resultant host structure in regional stress fields.  
Accordingly individual mines may be dominated by a single deposit style or several different mineralisation styles depending 
upon scale of controlling structures, homogeneity and thickness of host rocks.   

The geological setting of the Mungari East JV is shown in Figure 9-1.

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

Mineralisation is common in shear zones along lithological contacts.  Discordant veins may be 
grossly stratabound or restricted to specific lithologies (e.g. Golden Mile deposit is hosted within a 
dolerite sill).  Deposits may occur in both ductile and brittle fault and fracture zones, although most 
gold-hosting structures show features indicating gold deposition took place in the part of the crust 
known as the brittle-ductile transition zone.   

While all Archean lithologies in Yilgarn greenstone belts may be mineralized, mafic volcanics and 
internal granitoids are the most productive hosts in areas of significant gold production.  Rocks 
with high iron contents or high Fe/Fe+Mg ratios and/or banded iron formations are often important 
hosts in comparison to other Archean greenstone belts.  Ore mineralogy tends to be fairly simple 
with a prevalence of native gold or gold sited within pyrite +/- pyrrhotite +/-arsenopyrite structures.  
Native gold is generally >+900 fine.  Only deposits in the lower greenschist facies contain electrum 
with lower fineness.  Associated minerals may include scheelite, tellurides, stibnite, galena, 
sphalerite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, hematite, anhydrite, tourmaline and fluorite.  It is suspected that 
an evolving fluid system rather than discrete phases of hydrothermal action may be involved. 

Gold mineralisation may occur within regional metamorphic settings ranging from sub-greenschist 
through granulite facies however most of the mineralisation in the Norseman-Wiluna greenstone 
belt occurs in the mid to upper greenschist facies.  Mineralisation is characterized by a wide zone 
of pervasive carbonate alteration in the host rock with a central zone of K-micas, biotite, sericite (or 
V, Cr-bearing micas).  This alteration may be absent in low-alumina rocks such as banded iron 
formations.  Metamorphic minerals such as chloritoid, staurolite, cordierite, garnet, andalusite, 
sillimanite, kyanite and diopside-hedenbergite occur within amphibolite facies host rocks.  
Mineralisation age dates range from 2.63 to 2.9 Ma peaking at 2.6 to 2.7 Ma (late Archean).  The 
temperature window for gold deposition appears fairly broad however best estimates place it at 
about 300ºC +/- 50ºC at 1-3 kb with a close relation to the brittle-ductile transition zone. 

The following deposit styles are most prevalent: 

• Shear zone lodes: Gold deposition within alteration haloes +/- quartz veins +/- breccias. 
• Breccia lodes: Commonly rich in tellurides, relatively small in size these generally occur along 

lithological contacts in a brittle deformational style. 
• Quartz vein sets: Sets of thin, short-lived quartz veins that collectively form ore shoots tens of 

metres wide and hundreds of metres in strike length.  Most occur in low-tensile strength rock 
such as dolerite and felsic porphyry.  Gold often occurs within alteration selvages adjacent to 
the veins. 

• Laminated quartz veins: One to ten metre thick persistent quartz veins greater than one 
kilometre in length and over 250m deep. 

• Stratabound/strataform sediment-hosted lodes in banded iron formations or other iron-rich 
sedimentary rocks or within black shales. 

9.2 Local Geology  

The Frog's Leg project is located in the southern portion of the Kundana mining district – a 
significant mining area in the Archean Norseman Wiluna Belt of the Eastern Goldfields Province 
of the Yilgarn Craton.  This granite-greenstone belt is 1000km in length and is characterised by 
thick, rift-controlled accumulations of ultramafic, mafic and felsic volcanic, intrusive and 
sedimentary rocks metamorphosed through greenschist to amphibolite grades (Figure 9-2).  These 
greenstone successions occur in NNW trending elongated structural terrains bounded by 
NNW-trending faults (Swager 1997).  One of these key structures, the Zuleika Shear Zone passes 
through the Kundana mining camp and probably provides a locus for formation and reactivation of 
associated and conjugate structures as well as resulting gold emplacement.  The Zuleika shear has 
divided the formations into the Ora Banda domain on the east and the Coolgardie domain on the 
west.  These sequences are generally broadly folded and are more tightly folded and occasionally 
thrust-faulted adjacent to the shear.

9.3 Frog's Leg Geology 

Frog's Leg is a structurally complex deposit that occurs within a set of parallel NNW-trending 
faults associated with the Zulieka shear zone, and along its convergence with the Mungari Shear 
Zone and various NNE trending cross-cutting dextral sets, including the Mary fault.  A dilational 
jog along one of these NNE-trending structures may have had significant influence on the deposit's 
location.  At least four phases of structural deformation have influenced the immediate area.   

Immediately east of the Zulieka Shear Zone and on the western margin of the Ora Banda terrain 
Frog's Leg mineralisation occurs along or is associated with a faulted contact, the Frog's Leg Shear 
Zone, located between two principal rock types – volcanoclastics of the Black Flag Group to the 
east and the porphyritic basalts, locally known as catrock, to the west (Figure 10-1).  A thin unit of 
black shale occurs within the contact area but is generally more prevalent towards the south.  
Competency contrasts between more brittle volcanoclastics and more ductile basalts and shales 
influenced the development of vein arrays and shear zones associated with the gold deposition.  
The metamorphic grade ranges from upper greenschist to lower amphibolite.

10 Deposit Types 
The deposit occupies a 900m strike length, and contains a number of lodes, with distinctive 
structural and alteration styles associated with each lode (Figure 10-2).  The dominant deposit style 
is contact-style mineralisation along the contact between the felsic volcanoclastic rocks and the 
catrock., The six lodes are Mist, Fog, Marsh and Bull lodes to the north, and the Rocket and 
Whistle lodes to the south.  These are separated by low-grade or unmineralised zones, possibly 
coincident with later cross-cutting structures.  Quartz lode mineralisation occurs primarily in the 
footwall, east of the contact zone, as somewhat irregular vein structures within volcanoclastics that 
dip steeply towards the west into the contact.  The lodes are predominantly cross-cutting, but may 
have short segments conformable with particular stratigraphic horizons.  Less frequently quartz 
veins occur on the hanging wall side of the contact such as the Fog lode, west of the Mist contact 
zone, and the Whistle lode, west of Rocket.   

The variety of structural styles within the deposit includes laminated shear veins, quartz vein 
arrays, stockworks and breccia zones.  An MRA study has indicated that dominant structural ore 
controls are associated with compressional features relating to compressional and dilational jogs, 
which developed along undulating shear zones both on a local and regional scale. 

Contact zone mineralisation ranges between 10 to 30m in width and is sub-vertical to steeply west 
dipping.  Mineralisation is associated with quartz-veined and brecciated shear zones, intense 
biotite/carbonate alteration, silicification and sulphides, and it is bulk of the underground resource.  
Typical mineral assemblages associated with high-grade mineralisation includes pyrrhotite-
sphalerite-galena-arsenopyrite+/-tellurides +/-chalcopyrite within an intensely altered iron-
carbonate-biotite wall rock.

11 Mineralisation 
11.1 Mist, Fog, Marsh and Bull Lodes 

The Mist contact zone is a sub-vertical tabular lode that is approximately 600m in total length and 
500m down dip.  Variations in thickness range from 4 to 10m.  The zone is relatively narrow at 
higher levels but begins to thicken at a depth of 190m below surface ultimately becoming thinner at 
the deepest explored elevation of 600m.  The Mist zone contains about 36% of Frog's Leg 
measured and indicated ore tonnage (29% of the corresponding ounces) and is the current focus of 
underground mine planning. 

Fog is a satellite quartz lode and occurs in the hanging wall, about 20m west of the Mist contact 
zone.  It persists for some 275m along strike starting from 140m below surface and extending 
almost 200m down dip with a thickness range of 5 to 10m.   

Marsh and Bull are small satellite quartz lodes that occur adjacent to the Mist lode. The geometry 
of these lodes is shown schematically in Figure 11-1.  This diagram also shows the relationship 
between the contact and the mineralisation, and the major features of the footwall and hanging-wall 
geometry.

11.1.1 Rocket and Whistle Lodes 

Rocket extends for approximately 300m along strike and 400m down dip.  The contact zone is 
much thinner in this area and presently makes up about 15% of Frog's Leg measured and indicated 
resources.  Thicknesses range from 2 to 8m, averaging 4m. Open pit mining at Frog's Leg, 
completed during October 2005, primarily exploited this quartz lode in the footwall east of the 
contact zone. 

Whistle is a satellite quartz body that occurs to the west of the Rocket contact zone (similar to the 
occurrence of satellite mineralisation at Mist).

12 Exploration 
12.1 General 

Exploration in and around the Frog's Leg project is challenging because of thick transported 
overburden and scarcity of outcrop.  Accordingly it has evolved into a sequence of exploration 
techniques along geologically selected areas of favourable mineral potential, whether strike 
extensions of known mineralized zones or gold-bearing shears or projections along trend of the 
Kundana series of deposits.  Surface geology (Figure 12-1) has been interpreted using mostly 
sub-audio magnetics (SAM) magnetic imagery.  Geochemical analysis of rock chips, soils, RAB, 
aircore or auger samples also provides important information.  Anomalous zones are subsequently 
tested by drilling fences of reverse-circulation and/or diamond core holes.  Discoveries are then 
followed up by more closely-spaced development drilling (see Sec 8– History).  All rock types in 
the Kundana mining camp have the potential to host gold mineralisation.   

No exploration work on the Frog's Leg property was conducted directly by Dioro. 

12.2 Geophysics 

Various geophysical surveys have been used at Frog's Leg to attempt to identify characteristic 
responses relating to gold mineralisation.  These have included Geotem in 1998, Dighem in 1998 
and 2001, airborne magnetics by UTS Geophysics (defined the Frog's Leg shear – coincidental 
with mineralisation), Tempest EM in August 2000 and a regional ground gravity in cooperation 
with Placer Dome.  In retrospect it appears the grid spacing of the latter survey was too large to be 
effective. 

None of the surveys was effective in outlining a definitive response, possibly due to their airborne 
nature and/or inadequate detail. 

Studies on 21 rock samples were carried out to characterize physical responses.  Black shale was 
found to be a good conductor despite failure of the EM surveys to highlight it. 

Approximately 40km of SAM (sub-audio magnetics) survey has been successfully utilised over and 
around the Frog's Leg deposit with great success in determining sub surface geology and structure.

Drilling contractors were used for all programs.  The two principal contractors employed were 
Ausdrill Ltd (who sub-contracted to Mundy Drilling during busy periods) and Challenge Drilling.  
Mount Magnet Drilling carried out a limited amount of boat-mounted, specialised drilling 
following two cyclones during March 1999 when heavy accumulations of rainwater into ponds 
restricted conventional drilling in many areas. 

In order to optimise lode intersections in the 2004 program, most of the drillholes were oriented at 
055º angled 60º towards the east, while in previous drilling orientations were at 070º.  Most holes 
were drilled towards the east, however, where the contact structure was steep or easterly-dipping a 
number of holes were drilled towards the west.  Drilling was primarily NQ2 diameter-sized 
(59 mm) core. 

Mineralised intervals from the latest resource drilling program (October 2006 through May 2007) 
are shown in Table 13-2, and the influence of these on resource boundaries is shown in Figure 
13-2.  Resources are discussed in detail in Section 19 (Current Mineral Resource Estimates). 

All drilling data is in an SQL database with an Access front end.  This was converted to a Vulcan 
ISIS database for the resource estimation.  Drill holes collar co-ordinates are converted inside the 
main Exploration Database from the Australian Mapping Grid (AMG) to the Local Mine Grid for 
the Frog's Leg Project.  The local grid is rotated 35º clockwise to the AMG so that the strike of the 
mineralised zones is towards grid north.  A value of 8000m has been added to the Z co-ordinate so 
that the resource estimate falls within positive levels. 

Drilling at Frog's Leg is a mix of reverse circulation (RC) and NQ and HQ diameter diamond drill 
core.  The RC drilling is mainly from surface down to a depth of about 150m vertically.  The 
majority of the drill holes used for the resource estimation are diamond core.

13.1 Down Hole Surveys  

All RC and diamond drill holes, unless collapsed or prematurely abandoned, have some form of 
down hole surveys.   

Initially down hole surveys comprised solely of single shot surveys using a standard Eastman 
camera, operated by the drillers.  Surveys were taken every 30m down-hole in both diamond and 
RC holes, with stainless steel starter rods used in RC holes to facilitate the recording of azimuth 
measurements. 

From the start of 2001, in-rod gyroscopic surveys were also routinely completed at (or close to) the 
end of all RC and diamond drill holes.  During the first half of 2001 the contractor used was 
Surtron Surveys.  Readings were taken at 10m intervals.  These surveys were found to be much 
more consistent than the single shot surveys indicating that deviations were generally not as great 
as those anticipated from the single shots.  It is possible that a few diamond drill holes with aircore 
pre-collars drilled in 2001 may not have gyroscopic surveys, as in certain instances it was too 
problematic to run the survey equipment over water to the rig. 

From mid 2001 onwards, Down Hole Surveys have generally been contracted to provide in-rod 
gyroscopic surveys.  Readings have been taken down hole at either 2m or 5m intervals. 

Most of the diamond drill holes at Frog's Leg were drilled from west to east and drilled at 
approximately 105º on the local grid. Most holes are drilled down at 60º. The surveys are based on 
Single Camera shots provided and conducted by the drillers, in order to monitor the holes during 
drilling. At the completion of a holes, or when drilling through an ore zone, downhole gyro surveys 
are completed at 2 to 5m intervals. Drill spacing varies from approximately 20m x 20m near the 
surface to approximately 40m x 40m at depth.

14 Sampling Method and Approach 
For RC drillholes, the sample length is 1m systematically. For diamond drillholes, many of which 
are tails of aircore or RC holes, the sample length varies and is determined by geology, in particular 
the definition of the boundaries of the contact zone. Within a lode it is generally 1m. The 
geological wireframe was built using the logging and grade information and 1m composites were 
calculated within the wireframed lodes. 

Drill spacing varies from approximately 20m x 20m near the surface to approximately 40m x 40m 
at depth, and the resource classification acknowledges this variation as measured resource 
corresponds to the highest drilling density, whereas at depth (or between lodes) where the drilling 
density can be at more than 40m x 40m, the resource is inferred at best. 

Sample recovery is generally good, and there is no indication that sampling presents a material risk 
for the quality of the evaluation of the deposit.  

A summary of the mineralised intervals > 1g/t from the most recent drilling program is given in 
Table 13-2.

15 Sample Preparation, Analyses and 
Security 

15.1 Sampling and Laboratory 

15.1.1 Aircore Drilling 

All aircore holes are sampled as 4m composites.  The samples weigh approximately 2kg and are 
collected using a spear for dry samples and by hand for wet samples.  Duplicate samples are 
collected every 20 samples.  The samples are dispatched to ALS Laboratory (ALS), Kalgoorlie for 
analysis.  Gold concentrations are determined by aqua regia digestion and graphite furnace AAS at 
a detection limit of 0.01ppm Au.  Samples are assayed for gold only.  Anomalous composite 
intersections of greater than 0.2ppm Au are re-sampled at 1m intervals.  These samples are assayed 
by Genalysis in Perth for gold using a 400g "LeachWell" digest.  The tail pulps are recovered and 
assayed using fire assay techniques for all samples with assays >3g/t Au.  Re-samples for the first 
phases of aircore drilling were assayed via aqua regia.   

15.1.2 Reverse Circulation Drilling  

RC samples are collected from the cyclone in large plastic bags.  All dry samples are split on the 
rig with the smaller split (weighing approximately 2.5 – 3kg) collected in numbered calico bags.   

All holes are initially sampled as 4m composites.  These weigh approximately 2kg and are 
collected using a spear for dry samples and by hand for wet samples.  Samples are assayed at ALS 
Kalgoorlie, generally for gold only, using aqua regia digest and graphite furnace AAS at a 
detection limit of 0.01ppm Au. 

The 1m splits are utilised as one metre re-samples for intervals where initial samples assayed 
> 0.2g/t Au.  The re-samples for the initial programs are assayed at ALS, Kalgoorlie using fire 
assay with a 50g charge.  Re-samples from the later programs were however assayed at Genalysis 
using a "LeachWell" digest.  Tail pulps are recovered and assayed using fire assay techniques for 
all samples with assays >3g/t Au.  Every twentieth sample is collected as a duplicate for both the 
composites and re-samples.  Residues from every twentieth one-metre resample are collected and 
sent to an alternative laboratory for assay using the same method, to act as a check assay.  Check 
assays for the period 2000 – 2002 were sent to Kalgoorlie Assay Laboratories while those for 2003 
were analysed by Analabs in Kalgoorlie. 

15.1.3 Diamond Drilling  

All core samples not used for geotechnical or metallurgical purposes were cut in half at Genalysis 
Laboratory in Kalgoorlie.  The core was cut to one side of the orientation line and then sampled on 
a 1m basis for the entire length of the each hole.  No niche sampling has taken place.  Sample 
preparation takes place in Kalgoorlie prior to assay by Genalysis in Perth for gold using a 400g 
"LeachWell" digest.  This method utilises a four hour leach with solvent extraction and flame AAS 
finish.  If assays of >3g/t Au were returned from samples, the tail pulps were recovered, dried and 
assayed using fire assay techniques.  The residues for every twentieth sample were later re-assayed 
at Kalgoorlie Assay Labs for gold only using a similar LeachWell digest.  These acted as check 
assays. 

Preparation for the core from the 2003 program varied from the above.  To enable 90% of the final 
sample to pass 75 microns a 500g sub sample was split from the full sample after initial grinding.  
This sample was then put through a further second stage grinding process prior to despatch to Perth 
for analysis.  Check assays from this program were sent to Analabs in Kalgoorlie.

The majority of holes are also geo-technically logged which includes specific gravity 
measurements. 

15.1.4 Security Measures 

Normal security precautions are followed in the handling of samples which are kept in a secured 
environment either on-site or within LMR's locked storage facilities at Boulder.  Logging and 
sampling is carried out by authorized LMR personnel.  All core-splitting is done under contract by 
Genalysis Laboratories in Kalgoorlie.  All laboratories used in analysis of RC cuttings, drill core or 
general sampling are certified and accredited.   

It is evident that in the course of their rock and core analysis LMR takes appropriate QA/QC 
measures as indicated above to assay duplicate samples approximately every twentieth sample, to 
insert blanks and to routinely submit samples to other laboratories for check analyses. 

As a matter of routine gold is the only element assayed, however, for certain purposes and 
situations base metals and/or silver may also be tested.

16 Database Integrity and Verification 
16.1 Data Validation 

Many of the major database validation processes are completed during the initial importing of data 
into ExpDB.  A quarantine database stores any data that fails import, and this data can be viewed 
and fixed in Beagle.  In certain instances records failed import into the ExpDB table tblAssay 
because the primary key combination already existed in ExpDB.  This section details the two main 
methods of ExpDB validation. 

16.2 ExpDB Database Integrity 

A relational database, like ExpDB, has a number of in-built data validation tools, due mainly to the 
internal structure and configuration of all elements within the database.  All of the following 
examples of invalidation will result in the imported data being quarantined, and these errors can be 
fixed using Beagle. 

• Duplicate data – The definition of primary keys prevents the duplication of data in the 
database ensuring that each record (data type) is unique.   

• Meaningless data – Certain fields within ExpDB must contain data in order for the information 
to be correct.  For example, a drillhole collar without any defining geographical co-ordinates is 
meaningless.  Essential fields such as the co-ordinate fields within tblDHColl must be 
populated – if they are not, the database produces an error informing the user to complete the 
record. 

• Non-supporting data – Certain data requires the presence of supporting data in another primary 
table in ExpDB.  For example, assay results from a laboratory cannot be imported into 
tblAssay until supporting sample information is entered into tblDHSamp.   

• Library codes – Various library tables have one-to-many relationships with primary tables, 
ensuring that the codes used in the primary table are valid.  Any incorrect entry of a code 
through mistyping will be rejected by the database 

• Data inaccuracy – Triggers are used to calculate RQD information in tblDHGeotech upon 
successful import into ExpDB.  If the information used to calculate the RQD is over 100, then 
the user is informed in Beagle. 

• Database Rules – a number of rules are defined on certain fields and tables, and will not allow 
data that fails these rules to enter the database.  These include: 

− RQD (tblDHGeotech) – must be between 0 and 100; 
− Alpha (tblDHStructure) – must be between 0 and 90; 
− Beta (tblDHStructure) – must be between 0 and 360. 

16.3 ExpDB Database Validation 

Despite the presence of the many validation rules described above, there will be occasions when 
incorrect data will be successfully transferred to ExpDB.  Following are some examples of these 
types of data: 

The maximum depth in interval tables (like tblDHGeol) is deeper than the maximum depth in the 
'Depth' field of tblDHColl.   

Depth_from and depth_to intervals are of unlikely proportions, for example an SG measurement is 
more than likely to be conducted on a sample less than 30cm in length.  If the depth_from and 
depth_to entries indicate a length longer than 30cm, it is probable that one of the data entries is 
incorrect. 



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 35 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

The depth_from and depth_to intervals between consecutive records is either overlapping or an 
interval is missing.  As continuous down hole logs are kept for each drillhole in the tblDHSamp, 
tblDHGeol and tblDHGeotech tables, every depth_to and following depth_from entry should 
match.   

A tool that enables each user to check for these and other errors is available in ExpDB_Lite.   

The other major tool that LMR technical staff uses to validate data is through visual auditing in a 
map, usually on-screen through one of the visualisation packages available to staff (e.g. MapInfo, 
Vulcan, Micromine).  For example, if a drillhole collar has incorrect geographic co-ordinates it is 
very difficult to determine inaccuracies simply by looking at the data in the tblDHColl table.  
However, by plotting up all of the collars on a map inaccuracies will quickly become evident.   

Data in other tables, such as tblDHGeol, is also audited at regular intervals to ensure that the data 
previously entered matches the current knowledge.  In some cases, historical diamond drillhole 
core is re-logged and the new, more accurate data entered into the database.   

It is felt that LMR's sampling protocol satisfactorily addresses issues of quality assurance/quality 
control as well as security as described above.  Examination into these areas leads to the conclusion 
that LMR handles all of these items in a thorough and professional manner. 

Over the course of the property examination which included study of reports and related 
documentation there seemed little point in attempting to verify reams of basic data through a 
handful of rock samples.  Accordingly it was concluded that LMR's database is reliable and falling 
within the norms of reasonable variation.

17 Adjacent Properties 
Following the sale by COGEMA of Afmeco in 1994 and transferal of the various gold tenements to 
MRA, the latter concentrated much of its exploration efforts on the Kundana mining district west of 
Kalgoorlie (Figure 17-1).  Current gold endowment of the Kundana mining area is placed at 
approximately 7,000,000oz.  MRA's initial minor discoveries along the belt included Burgundy, 
Cutters Ridge and Kopai South.  The White Foil discovery in 1996 was followed in 1999 by that of 
the Frog's Leg, 2km to the east.   

Situated approximately 8km along strike to the south of the multi-million ounce Kundana mine the 
Frog's Leg lies within an area containing numerous gold deposits that have been either mined-out, 
under current development or subject to ongoing exploration.   

Gold mining began in the Kundana area in 1894.  Over thirty small-scale operations sprung up 
shortly thereafter with hundreds of shafts and shallow diggings covering the area.  Within three 
years harsh conditions, inflow of ground water and low grades forced a general abandonment.  
Production of some 10,000oz of gold was estimated during this period.  The 1960s saw a surge of 
regional exploration for gold and nickel followed by detailed, systematic exploration after 1987. 

The following description of the characteristics of the Kundana mine camp is from Weber, Moreau, 
Eaton (2003). 

The Kundana Mine Camp comprises a number of 'shear vein-hosted' gold deposits.  Resources for 
each deposit amount to ca 1.0 M oz Au with a combined production and remaining resource 
exceeding 4.5 M oz Au (for location of deposits, see Figure 12-1).   

Kundana geologists assign the deposits into one of two categories based on host rock and vein 
characteristics.  The two categories are shale hosted veins and shear hosted veins.  Shale hosted 
vein deposits host 72% of the mineralisation (both mined and in situ) and 48% of the gold (mined 
and in situ).  Laminated vein deposits represent 28% of the mineralisation and 52% of the gold.  
Both deposit categories are strongly controlled by sinistral strike slip movements and/or scissor 
style movements that occur within reactivated D2 structures (Boyd and others, 2001). 

Shale hosted deposits include North Lode, South Lode, Pope John, Moonbeam, Pegasus, Rubicon 
and Hornet.  North Lode and South Lode occur within shales in the basalt sequence and at 
basalt/intermediate and basalt/sediment facies changes.  The Pope John, Moonbeam and Pegasus – 
Rubicon – Hornet deposits (ABC line) are all within shale at the basalt/intermediate contact.  This 
style of deposit is typified by steeply west dipping quartz-pyrrhotite-gold lodes averaging 2m true 
thickness and an average grade of 4.4g/t Au.  The veins have crack and seal textures characterised 
by wall rock slivers that give the veins a ribboned appearance (Boyd and others, 2001). 

Shear hosted vein deposits include the Strzelecki, Barkers and Raleigh deposits.  These deposits are 
high grade with ore produced almost entirely from <0.5m wide laminated veins.  The veins have 
grades in the order of 55g/t Au but are diluted during mining to approximately 11g/t Au. 

Other styles of mineralisation occur at a deposit scale; these include fault bounded laminated veins, 
and sheeted vein systems oblique to mineralised faults and shears.  All other styles of 
mineralisation have generally the same vein mineralogy suggesting the same mineralising system is 
responsible for mineralisation at a camp scale. 

Recent underground development at Raleigh showed the presence of 'very high grade shallow 
west-dipping veins not identified during exploration' (P. Turner, personal communication to John 
Jenks).

Lea (1998) places total production by Goldfields Pty Ltd to July 1996 from the Kundana Mine at 
2,569,000t @ 4.8gpt average (394,000oz), with remaining proven and probable reserves of 
2,805,000t @ 7.6gpt average (685,000oz) 

In their 2007 annual report Tribune Resources NL reports reserves and resources from their 
Kundana properties, joint-ventured with Rand Mining and Gilt-Edged Mining, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Barrick Australia Pacific limited, as follows (at 30 June 2007):  

• Raleigh – Underground Mining: measured resource 352,500t @ 24.5gpt average (278,000oz), 
indicated resource 420,400t @ 15.8gpt average (213,600oz), inferred resource 554,800t 
@13.4gpt average (239,000oz); These resources include a proved reserve of 331,600t @ 
20.2gpt average (215,359oz) and a probable reserve of 486,500t @ 11.6gpt average 
(181,442oz) 

• Hornet – Surface Mining: measured resource 135,900t @ 3.3gpt average (14,400oz), indicated 
resource 63,000t @ 3.7gpt average (7,500oz), inferred resource 130,000t @ 2.5gpt average 
(10,400oz).  These resources include a proved reserve of 135,000t @ 3.3gpt average 
(14,323oz) and a probable reserve of 45,000t @ 4.0gpt average (5,78oz) 

• Underground Mining: indicated resource 505,000t @ 13.5gpt average (219,200oz), inferred 
resource 266,000t @ 10.9gpt average (93,200oz);  These resources include a probable reserve 
of 596,00t @ 9.6gpt average (183,956oz) 

• Rubicon – Underground Mining: indicated resource 96,000t @ 22.5gpt average (69,400oz), 
inferred resource 228,000t @ 12.4gpt average (90,900oz); These resources include a probable 
reserve of  38,000t @ 11.3gpt average (50,136oz) 

• Pegasus – Underground Mining: indicated resource 263,000t @ 9.9gpt average (83,700oz), 
inferred resource 200,000t @ 7.0gpt average (45,000oz). These resources include a probable 
reserve of 167,000t @ 9.3gpt average (49,934oz) 

The discoveries of White Foil and Frog's Leg made by MRA during the 1990s increased the 
Kundana district gold endowment. Technical reports by Jenks, Schrimpf and Guibal (2006) and La 
Mancha (2007) on the two properties list estimated resources as follows:  

• White Foil – measured and indicated global resources 5,661,000t @ 2.2gpt (400,000oz), 
inferred resources 2,303,000t @ 2.16gpt (160,000oz) 

• Frog's Leg – measured and indicated underground global resources 3,221,000t @ 7.0gpt 
average (723,000oz), inferred resources 1,136,000t @ 5.7gpt average (209,000oz) 

Accordingly, the gold endowment of the Kundana mining camp is substantial. 

The Joint Venture owns or controls a substantial land position in the area (see Fig 2).  While they 
have carried out some degree of exploration on many of the tenements much follow-up work 
remains to be carried out.  With established positions at the Frog's Leg deposits the opportunities 
for adding on to the resource base appears positive.

18 Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
A review of the metallurgical test-work on Frog's Leg underground ore and consideration of recent 
work performed on various lodes in Frog's Leg highlights the following main points: 

• Test-work on Frog's Leg ore samples has been relatively comprehensive with samples derived 
from both drill core and bulk (12,500t) samples on representative material from the lodes 

• Gold recovery from Frog's Leg ore samples has a relatively flat response to head grade 
(recovery (%) = 0.0157 x Grade (g/t) + 94.8 based on feasibility analysis).  The expected 
recovery for Frog's Leg underground ore is 94.9% for a head grade of 5.31gAu/t 

• The three Frog's Leg ore lodes have similar recovery attributes, however Mist Lode material 
would be expected to have a slightly higher recovery (96%) than the average suggested above 

• The Jubilee flowsheet is suitable for processing the Frog's Leg underground ore 
• Although it is considered free milling, the addition of a large proportion of Frog's Leg 

underground ore with higher work indices would impact Jubilee mill throughput.  The forecast 
throughput, recovery and reagent consumption would need to be re-optimised based on blend 

• At plant level, Frog's Leg recovery is dependent on a number of processing variables being 
maintained such as residence time, sufficient carbon capacity and loading, cyanide and oxygen 
addition and stripping capacity 

18.1 Processing Facilities 

There are no ore processing facilities at the Frog's Leg mine site.  This ore could potentially be 
processed through the Jubilee Processing Facility (JMP).  Frog's Leg metallurgical test-work 
results indicate free milling sulphide ores with no particular metallurgical issues.  Gravity 
concentration and intensive leach of concentrate is recommended to maximise gold recovery.  The 
existing JMP configuration is suitable for processing the Frog's Leg underground ore.  No 
significant flowsheet changes are required.  

The JMP was commissioned in 1987 and has a design treatment capacity of 110ktpm on blended 
ore with the driving factor being ore hardness.  The process route comprises primary jaw crushing, 
secondary and tertiary cone crushing in closed circuit with screens, primary SAG milling, closed 
circuit secondary ball milling, gravity circuit, cyanide leaching, CIP adsorption, split AARL 
elution, electrowinning, smelting and tailings disposal.  The current process flow diagram is shown 
in Figure 18.2.

18.2 Frog's Leg Metallurgical Testing Summary 

Test-work on Frog's Leg ore samples has been relatively comprehensive with samples derived 
from both drill core and bulk (12,500 tonne) samples on representative material from the lodes. 
Metallurgical test-work has included: 

• Lab-scale test-work on drill core composites of various lode samples 
• Lab-scale variability test-work on individual lode samples 
• Full scale milling (Three Mile Hill Plant) of a bulk Rocket Lode sample of 12,500 tonnes 

While most lab-scale work was on samples with head grades higher than expected for the project 
(11.6 gAu/t versus 5.3 gAu/t), the bulk sample processing was on grades significantly lower (2.5 
gAu/t).  Interestingly, the gold recovery was similar for all tests. 

The minimum recovery achieved in variability test work has been 91.7%, the maximum being 
97.5%, suggesting sensitivity studies be undertaken within this range. Given that Mist Lode 
material demonstrated higher recovery (96%) and comprises the majority of the ore, the sensitivity 
should be biased towards higher recovery. 

Frog's Leg ore will respond well to conventional CIL plant treatment incorporating a gravity circuit 
using a grind size of P80 106µm.  The recovery for ore grading 5.31 gAu/t will be approximately 
94.9%.  A higher recovery may be possible if preferential grinding of sulphide is achieved.  Lower 
recovery is unlikely as the higher recovery Mist ore makes up the majority of the deposit. 

18.3 Metallurgical Testing History 

In 2002 Frog's Leg metallurgical test work was undertaken on three ore types, identified as oxide, 
quartz and contact.  The ore type most reflective of the Frog's Leg underground ore was the 
'contact' sample, a free milling, non-complex sulphide ore.  It did not have any significant 
metallurgical issues, had an optimised recovery of 95.6%, a BWI of 16.9 kWh/t, was mildly grind 
sensitive, had a lime consumption of 1.5kg/t and elevated cyanide consumption of 1.3kg/t. 

Follow-up test work was undertaken in late 2004 on three Frog's Leg underground ore composites 
from distinct parts of the deposit, 'Mist', 'Fog' and 'Rocket'.  The findings indicated a free milling 
sulphide ores with no particular metallurgical issues, and with average optimised recovery of 
94.2%, and average variability testing cyanide and lime consumption of 0.37kg/t and 4.41kg/t 
respectively. 

This metallurgical test work on the Frogs Leg underground ore also evaluated whether there was 
likely to be any difference in recovery based on the macro properties of the ore through variability 
test work.  

Further testing was undertaken in late 2007 on Mist and Rocket drill core composites.  The latest 
findings again indicated a free milling sulphide ore with no particular metallurgical issues, and with 
average leach recovery of 93.4%, and an average combined gravity and leach recovery of 96.7%. 
The Mist composite achieved higher recoveries in both cases. 

The relevant Frog's Leg underground ore metallurgical test-work conclusions and observations are 
summarised in Table 18-1 and the bullet points below.

• The test work results indicate free milling sulphide ores with no particular metallurgical 
issues. 

• The majority of gold is liberated with only minor amounts being associated with arsenopyrite. 
• Based on the mineral liberation analysis no significant gold recovery issues are anticipated. 
• Gravity gold recovery is typically high.  Intensive leaching is recommended due to the coarse 

nature of gold present and the risk of loss to leach.  No intensive leaching issues were 
encountered, suggesting that most of the gold is not locked in sulphides. 

• The relationship between grade and recovery is relatively flat. 
• Lime consumption is negatively influenced by the high salinity site water and the more 

sulphidic nature of the underground ore.  Both cyanide and lime consumption fell during the 
most recent test work. 

• The ore is mildly grind sensitive, throughput exceeding milling capacity will impact recovery. 
• Oxygen sparging is mandatory. 
• Viscosity was not measured however visually the viscosity was low, which is characteristic of 

a typical primary ore. 
• The copper and nickel levels are low so carbon fouling should not pose a problem. 
• Organic carbon is not present in the ores. CIP was no worse than CIL recovery. 
• If a higher gold recovery is necessary the "Goldfields-St Ives Concept" of diagnostic leaching 

of the tailings and if justified regrind of the gravity sulphides before leaching could be 
evaluated.  This could add 2 to 3% to the overall gold recovery and is a growing trend amongst 
a number of plants where the ore is amenable. 

• A Knelson concentrator and intensive leaching of the concentrates would be recommended to 
maximise gold recovery.

In respect to variability test work undertaken on different depth samples of similar nature ore: 

• Gravity recovery results are in line with the composites. 
• Total gold recovery (gravity and leach) averaged 94.2% and ranged between 91.7% and 

97.5%. 
• Mist recoveries were higher than Fog and Rocket recoveries 
• No poor recoveries were encountered 

SRK considers there are few technical risks from the processing of Frog's Leg underground ore.  
Throughput will be plant and blend dependent.

19 Current Mineral Resource Estimates 
19.1 June 2007 Resource Estimate 

The latest Frog's Leg resource statement by LMR was released in June 2007; it includes results 
from the latest drilling program completed from October 2006 to May 2007.  Compared to the 
April 2007 resource estimate (the last publicly-released resource figures), it represents an increase 
of 130% in the measured and indicated tonnes and an increase of 96% in the corresponding ounces. 
This increase is due to: 1) infill drilling that converted large inferred areas in the previous resource 
to indicated resources, and 2) re-interpretations of the shapes and boundaries of the Frog's Leg's 
lodes and the gold mineralisation associated with them. 

CSA Australia Geological Consultants completed a review of the geostatistical interpretation for 
LMR. Dioro Exploration completed an audit of the resource with the assistance of RSG Global.  
Table 19-1 shows the June 2007 resource estimate at a 3.5g/t cut-off grade.   

Mr Daniel Guibal, SRK Corporate Consultant (Geostatistics .& Resources) has reviewed the 2007 
resource estimates shown in Table 19-1, and in his opinion, these estimates conform to the 
requirements of current resource estimates in NI43-101 and CIM Best Practice Guidelines for 
Estimation of Mineral Resources. 

At the time of estimation (June 2007) SRK confirms that the Mineral Resources presented in Table 
19.1 are contained within the extent of the property boundaries.  To the best of SRK's knowledge, 
at the time of estimation there were no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues that would materially impact on the 
eventual extraction of the mineral resources assuming that appropriate technical and economic 
studies support this.

19.2 Geological Interpretation and Wireframe Models 

Frog's Leg gold mineralisation consists of a number of vertically orientated tabular structures, 
orientated roughly north south in the local grid. The gold mineralisation is hosted by silicified and 
quartz-veined zones within the contact of intermediate volcanoclastics and the basalt. The contact 
is associated with the Frog's Leg shear zone and black shale is locally associated with this contact.  
A more detailed description is provided in Section 9.2 (Local Geology ). 

The resource interpretation is based on two main types of mineralisation. Contact mineralisation 
(CSZ) occurs along the shear zone between the basalt and the intermediate rocks.  The two main 
lodes are Mist (north) and Rocket (south). CSZ mineralisation at the southern extent of the open pit 
is referred to as Tinker.  However, further drilling is required to test the continuity of mineralisation 
in this area before any resource can be estimated. The second main type of mineralisation occurs in 
the hangingwall of "catrock" basalt. Alteration assemblages and quartz veining are similar to those 
in CSZ mineralisation.  The "catrock" lodes are Fog and Marsh (adjacent to Mist) and Whistle

(adjacent to Rocket). The Bull lode occurs in the footwall volcanoclastics adjacent to the Mist lode. 
Figure 19-1 shows the lodes in long section, looking west. Figure 19-2 shows the lodes in cross 
section. 

 

Figure 19-1:  Long section showing lode wireframes in June 2007 Resource 

 

June 2007 geological interpretations of the mineralized zones are based on veining and the intensity 
of the alteration assemblages (Figure 10-2). The boundaries are also based in part on a nominal 
0.5 to 1.0g/t cut off grade.  Gold grades can be highly variable in this style of mineralisation and 
the wireframe interpretations were constructed to highlight the continuity of the structures that host 
the lodes.   

Figure 19-3 and Figure 19-4 show comparisons between the June 2007 wireframes and 
December 2006 wireframes that were produced for an internal resource estimate by La Mancha 
Resources.  The June 2007 wireframes include results from the most recent drilling and are based 
on a significant re-interpretation of the lode shapes, which takes into account the significance of 
alteration assemblages, quartz veining, and the location of the CSZ.   

In addition, previous wireframe interpretations included a large "halo" zone of lower grade, and 
potentially less continuous material, around the lodes that are not necessarily appropriate for 
selective underground mining.  The June 2007 wireframes were constructed to better reflect true 
mineable widths of the lodes that could be developed in an underground mining scenario. 

The June 2007 wireframe models of the lodes are based on logging of geological boundaries and 
1m drill core assay intervals. Each lode has its own unique lode name in the ORECODE variable. 
Table 19-2 shows the statistics for 1m composites within each lode. 

Resources by lode from the June 2007 estimate, at a 3.5g/t cut-off, are shown in Table 19-3.

19.3 Block Model 

The block model was generated using Vulcan software, and was constrained within wireframe 
models of the lodes (Figure 19-5). The parent block size is 2m (X) x 20m (Y) x 20m (Z). The 20m 
Y and Z block dimensions were used because they are approximately half of the drillhole spacing 
in those directions (north and vertical, respectively). The 2m X block dimension was chosen to fit 
within the narrow width of the wireframe domains. Subcells with dimensions of 0.5m (X) * 5m (Y) 
* 5m (Z) were used to fill areas that were not filled with a parent block. The parent block values 
were assigned to the subcells. 

19.4 Grade Estimation 

Ordinary kriging was used for grade estimation, based on one metre composites.  Statistical 
analyses of composites in the three main lodes (Mist, Fog and Rocket) indicated that log 
variograms should be modelled. The composites showed high coefficients of variation and the 
high-grade tails, which are typical of this style of narrow lode mineralisation. Variogram 
parameters from the larger lodes were used for the smaller lodes (Whistle, Marsh and Bull) because 
they are geologically similar and because the smaller lodes did not produce good variograms due to 
the smaller number of one metre composites within them. 

Grade estimation in the blocks was completed in one first run, with a second pass used to fill 
remaining blocks in the outer margins of the larger Mist, Rocket and Fog lodes. 

19.5 Density 

Density determinations of diamond core were completed by the Exploration Department using the 
water immersion method.  Measurements were made every 2m within the ore zone and every 4m 
within 20m around the ore zone. The average density used for the lodes was 2.8 t/m³ for fresh rock 
and all the lodes in the June 2007 resource estimate are within fresh rock material. 

19.6 Resource Classification 

Frog's Leg resource classifications (Figure 19-6) are based on drilling density, the level of 
geological understanding of the lodes, and grade estimation. Measured resources generally occur in 
the most densely drilled areas, where drill spacing averages less than 20m x 20m spacing (e.g. in 
the upper parts of Rocket and Mist) and where the geological controls on the continuity of 
mineralisation are best understood. Indicated resources generally occur in areas where drill spacing 
averages greater than 20m x 20m and less than 40m x 40m.  Inferred resources occur in less well 
drilled areas, where drill spacing is greater than 40m x 40m and/or where the geology and 
continuity of mineralisation is less well understood (e.g. the Bull lode, which was modelled for the 
first time in the June 2007 estimate). 

In Figure 19-6, drill intercepts within each of the lodes are shown, except for Bull lode, which has 
only inferred resources.  It also shows the changes in the lode boundaries since the December 2006 
internal resource estimate by La Mancha, and the extent of the recent drilling in the northern parts 
of Mist and Fog.

19.7 Current Mineral Resource Estimation 

The Mineral Resource is discussed and reviewed earlier in this Section of the report and tabulated 
in Table 19-1. The Mineral Resource is the June 2007 estimate and has been reported on a 3.5g/t 
cut off grade.  The total Measured and Indicated Resource is 3.22 Mt at 7.0g/t.  In the evaluation of 
this project the 2007 DFS only used Measured Mineral Resource and Indicated Mineral Resource 
tonnage and grade in the scheduling of production and the financial cost model.  No Inferred 
Mineral Resource Tonnage and Grade were used in the evaluation.

19.8 Current Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Based on the definitive feasibility study mine design with the associated dilution and recovery 
factors a Mineral Reserve estimate has been generated.  This Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve 
is based on the conversion of the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.  All the financial 
evaluation of this Mineral Reserve is based on only the inclusion of Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources. 

The cutoff grade used in establishing the Mineral Resource is 3.5g/t.  The appropriate Dilution 
Factors as well as the Mining Recovery Factors (as outlined in 20.3) were applied to the in situ 
stope design tonnage and grade.  The resulting Mineral Reserve as outlined in Table 19-4 is fair 
and representative. 

Mineral resources that do not report as mineral reserves do not demonstrate economic viability.

contained within the extent of the property boundaries.  To the best of SRK's knowledge, at the 
time of estimation there were no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political or other relevant issues that would materially impact on the eventual 
extraction of the mineral reserves.

20 Other Relevant Data and Information 
20.1 Previous Mining History - Open Pit 

The Frog's Leg deposit was original mined by open pit which focused primarily upon extraction of 
a series of steeply-dipping quartz lode structures located within the volcanoclastic footwall 
immediately east of the contact zone mineralisation.  The latter structure was also mined, in part, at 
higher pit elevations. 

The open pit mining operation occurred during an 18 month period from April 2004 to October 
2005.  It was contracted to Howard Springs Earthmoving, which supplied its own personnel and 
equipment, with MRA providing supervision.  Machinery included 110t excavators, seven 85t 
(777s) dump trucks, grader, water truck, six drills as well as D10 and Komatsu bulldozers.  As the 
pit deepened and restricted heavy equipment movement, the fleet was gradually reduced.  A 
front-end loader was used to load the truck trains which hauled ore to the Coolgardie mill in 100t 
payloads. 

20.2 Underground Mining Technical-Commercial Studies 

The Frog's Leg gold deposit is part of the Mungari East Joint Venture agreement between Dioro 
(49%) and LMR (51% and operator of the project).  The deposit is currently being developed as an 
underground mine. In the past all mining investments have been internally financed, and there has 
not been any need to present a feasibility study to financial institutions or any legal obligation to 
prepare public resources and reserve statements in accordance with applicable reporting codes. 

A feasibility study was completed in September 2007 which evaluated the Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resource only.  This Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) meets the obligations of JORC 
and the NI43-101 allowing the reporting of a Mineral Reserve. 

MRA's mining strategy was to ultimately mine the Frog's Leg deposit by underground means 
following the completion of open pit mining in October 2005.  Changes in the gold price as well as 
increased capital and working costs required a review of the mining plan, particularly a review of 
the cut-off grade mining policy.  To this end, as outlined above, a series of underground technical-
commercial study were conducted, including: 

• Internal evaluation , June 2004 
• Updated evaluation in February 2005 by MRA (Reviewed by AMC, May 2005) 
• Conceptual Underground Design by Rapallo Pty Ltd, September 2005 (Reviewed by AMC 

September 2005) 
• Frog's Leg Mining Study by AMC Consulting, September 2007 
• Frog's Leg Backfill Study by AMC Consulting, September 2007 
• Frog's Leg Ventilation Report by AMC Consulting, September 2007 
• Frog's Leg Underground Mine DFS, LMR., September 2007 

These studies are comprehensive and define the relevant geological, geotechnical, metallurgical, 
mining, environmental and socio-economic project parameters.   

20.3 2007 DFS Conversion Process from Resource to Reserve 

To evaluate the Frog's Leg Mineral Reserve requires understanding the breakdown of the mining 
modification factors used in the conversion from resource to reserve.  In the evaluation of the 
Frog's Leg DFS prepared by LMR Resources in September 2007 the conversion process is well 
documented and each of the required factors well explained.  This section of the report describes 
the process and ultimate results for the conversion from Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve.  



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 54 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

20.3.1 Mining Method and Mine Design 

The Frog's Leg underground mine is presently under construction.  The main underground access 
is a decline from within the previously mined open pit.  The main mine infrastructure includes an 
emergency escape way and ventilation raise.  The ore and waste material handling is by 50t trucks 
to surface.  Waste can be trucked to mined stope voids and included in the cemented backfill 
system. 

The Frog's Leg underground mine will use three similar mining methods.  These include: 

• Longhole Benching (Upholes or Downholes) with Backfill (OS), (70% of the Prod tonnes) 
• Longhole Benching without Backfill (UHR), (6% of the Prod tonnes) 
• Crown/Sill Pillar Recovery which is similar to UHR (CRWN), (9% of the Prod tonnes) 

Development ore accounts for the remaining 16% of the production tonnes 

The ground conditions at the Frog's Leg deposit are generally very competent and these conditions 
are suited to bench stoping.  The geotechnical evaluation states that stable spans are achievable 
with a strike length of 40m and a level spacing of 25m.   The designed stopes as outlined in the 
DFS are in fact 20m in strike length and the level spacing is 20m.  Therefore there is high 
confidence in the stability of the stopes. 

The Frog's Leg deposit is located in a geological area of Western Australia where underground 
mining experiences seismic related excavation damage due to a combination of high virgin rock 
stress and competent rock masses.  In some instances inappropriate mine design and extraction 
sequencing in adjacent mines have resulted in seismic events with damage to mine workings and 
production losses.  The mining sequence adopted in the DFS is designed to reduce the impact of 
mine induced stress changes by incorporating a bottom up sequence as well as establishing retreat 
fronts toward the level access.  Although this will not eliminate the mine induced stress effects it 
will minimise its effects. 

The mine layout and mining method locations are indicated in Figure 20-1 which is a perspective 
view of the Frog's Leg deposit highlighting the mine access, ventilation, emergency egress and 
stoping locations.  There are two distinct mining lodes being mined.  This includes the Mist/Fog 
Lode and the Rocket Lode.  The majority of the mining activity is from the Mist/Fog Lode.

20.4 Mining Modification Factors 

In the conversion of in situ tonnage and grade for any underground stope design a number of 
Mining Modification Factors are required to represent the difference between the in situ tonnage 
and grade and the actual tonnage and grade that will report to the mill as a final product.  In an 
operating mine these factors can be determined by reconciliation with existing practices.  With a 
new mine such as Frog's Leg a representative approach of industry standards and understanding 
can be implemented to convert the Mineral Resource to a Mineral Reserve.  To this end the main 
components are Dilution Factors and Mine Recovery Factors.  These are outlined in the following 
sections. 

20.4.1.1 Dilution Factors 

The open stoping technique planned for the Frog's Leg mine will have dilution factors attributed to 
various aspects of the source of the dilution.  The modification factors used to create the mining 
dilution are; the Footwall and Hangingwall Dilution, Bogging (Mucking) Dilution, Adjacent Stope 
Dilution. 

Footwall and Hangingwall Dilution 

The rock mechanics analysis conducted indicated that for a 25m sublevel interval the maximum 
stable stope length is 40m.  The actual mine layout is based on 20m sublevel intervals indicating 
that larger strike length could be used with a similar hydraulic radius for larger stopes.  To account 
for the over break of the Hangingwall and the Footwall a process to estimate this dilution was 
developed.  Based on the orebody width an envelope was created on the Hangingwall and 
Footwall.  The thickness of the envelope is based on the width of the orebody.  The density and 
grade associated with this dilution is based on the results of the block model evaluation of the 
dilution wireframe.  This dilution is capable of carrying grade. 

Bogging (Mucking) Dilution 

As the mining method recommended is a bottom up method some of the stopes will be mucking the 
ore off previously mined and backfilled stopes.  To account for the mucking of some backfill 
during the production of these stopes, 100mm of backfill is assumed to be included as dilution from 
the surface area of the backfilled floor.  The dilution material is assumed to have a density of 
2.0 t/m3 and carry no grade. 

Adjacent Stope Dilution 

This factor is used to account for the dilution material attributable to mining adjacent to previously 
mined and backfilled stopes.  It is assumed that 1m of over break occurs on average over the stope 
face area and is only used on those stopes which are mined adjacent to backfilled stopes.  The 
dilution material is assumed to have a density of 2.0 t/m3 and carry no grade.

20.4.1.2 Mine Recovery Factors 

To account for the affect of mining activity a Mining Recovery Factor has been applied to all 
stopes based on the mining method used.  This factor represents the amount of the in situ resource 
that will be produced from the stope based on a number of different Factors.  Typically the 
reduction in production tonnes from in situ tonnes is due to the following reasons each of which is 
different for the type of mining method being evaluated.  The reasons are, drilling and blasting 
efficiencies, production mucking, rib pillars that were not explicitly designed, known problems in 
recovery due to stope failure such as the case with sill recoveries where ingress from the stope 
above and higher stress may make higher recoveries impossible. 

The Mining Recovery Factors for each mining method proposed for the Frog's Leg deposit are 
outlined in Table 20-2.  These Mining Recovery Factors are a fair representation of what will occur 
while mining with these methods in the Frog's Leg deposit.

20.5 Project Schedule – 2007 DFS 

The assumptions presented below are achievable rates based on the current experience at the Frog's 
Leg development project.  These rates are typical values accepted for project estimations. 

A review of the main assumptions and resulting development and production schedules was 
conducted and presented in the following sections.   

20.5.1 Scheduling Assumptions 

The Frog's Leg Underground Project is presently being developed.  The assumptions presented 
below are achievable rates based on the current experience at the Frog's Leg project.  These rates 
are typical values accepted for project estimations.

20.5.2 Development and Production Schedules 

The development and production schedules are based on the assumptions outlined in Table 20-3.  
These are fair and representative rates of advancement for the mining activities. 

The development schedule commenced in the third quarter of 2007.  The development 
advancement rate has increased in response to the availability of three development jumbos with 
multiple headings.  By the end of Q1 2008 (Figure 20-2) the development will be sustained at an 
average of 1,800m per quarter or 600m per month (200m per jumbo) which is achievable in a multi 
heading operation.  The horizontal development requirements are sustained for three years to 
ensure that all the active mining areas are ready for production.  If more economic mineral resource 
is found outside the present mining areas there is opportunity to establish development into these 
areas after due study and design work has been conducted. 

The production schedule highlights the fact that stope production will commence during the Q1 of 
2008.  As more active stoping regions are developed the stope production continues to increase to a 
steady state or average production rate of 140,000t per quarter or 560,000t per annum.  The 
production profile is not smooth as there are times were production is waiting for the development 
to be completed.  As the mine becomes more depleted the production rate does decrease due to 
limiting mining areas.  Total gold production is 589,94oz over the life of the mine.

20.6 Project Evaluation – 2007 DFS 

An evaluation of the DFS costing or pretax financial model was conducted and the relevant finding 
presented in this section.  This pre-tax financial model is based on the DFS mine design, the 
resulting project schedule and the financial assumptions. 

20.6.1 Project Evaluation Assumptions 

The assumptions used in the DFS cost model are outlined in Table 20-4.  There has been no bottom 
line contingency included in these assumptions as the operating and capital cost items have either 
been purchased, or the project has been supplied with solid quotations, or a contingency has been 
added to each item if there is a cost uncertainty.  There has also been no inflation added to any of 
the costing as the pricing and costs are assumed to be consistent through the 7.5 year mine life. 

Table 20-4:  Economic Assumptions used in 2007 DFS  

Assumption Value 

Gold Price A$845/oz 
Transport Cost to Mill A$6.00/t 
Milling Cost A$19.00/t 
Mill Recovery 94.9% 
Gold Royalties 2.5% 
Cost of Capital (Discount Rate) 12.0% 

 

An internal technical memo by Bill Plyley on the 8 October 2007 entitled "Frog's Leg DFS – Gold 
Recovery" outlined the rationale behind the selection of the milling recovery percentage.  As 
quoted in the report it reads: 

"In conclusion, Frog's Leg ore responds well to conventional CIL plant 
treatment using a grind size of P80 106 micron.  The recovery for ore grading 
5.31 gAu/t as in the DFS is expected to be 94.9%.  A higher recovery may be 
possible with the plant if preferential grinding of sulfides is achieved.  Lower 
recovery is unlikely as the majority of the test samples achieved recovery above 
the average shown." 

This statement is underscored by open pit production which has effectively provided an 800,000t 
bulk sample, from which gold recovery averaged 96.8% at the Greenfields toll mill.  There should 
be little variation from this recovery elsewhere within the deposit indicating the 94.9% recovery in 
the assumptions are reasonable. 

20.6.2 Capital Costs 

The capital cost for this project has, for the most part, already been expended during the 2007 
calendar year.  The capital cost items are based on quotations or the final cost of the delivered 
items.  For those costs that carried some uncertainty a contingency was added for each item.  The 
sensitivity analysis takes into consideration any global contingency number for the capital costs. 

This analysis does not take into account the operating costs that can be capitalised prior to ore 
production.  If this was to be considered all operating costs in Q1 2008 could be capitalised.  This 
equates to approximately A$5.5M that could be transferred from operating expenditure to capital 
expenditure. 

The capital expenditure forecasted for the Frog's Leg underground project is A$71,192,172 of 
which A$22,319,293 (or 31%) is forecasted to be spent as of the end of December 2007.  The 



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 61 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

remaining 69% of the capital will include the continuation of the decline development and 
associated mine capital development of A$21.8M (31%) as well as the fixed assets of A$27.1M 
(38%).   

This capital cost breakdown is outlined in Figure 20-3.  The top chart of this figure outlines the 
three components of the capital costs which are the capital decline development, fixed assets and 
the capital expenditure forecasted to the end of December 2007.  The latter expenditure equates to 
31% of the total capital for the project.   The second and third charts outline a breakdown of the 
future capital expenditure from January 2008.  These include the breakdown of future fixed assets 
capital and the future decline development capital.

20.6.3 Mining Operating Costs 

The operating costs for the Frog's Leg underground project indicate a total cost per tonne of ore of 
A$60.89/t.  This is inclusive of 14 specific costs as outlined in Figure 20-4.  The three main 
operating cost components include Ore Production – Stopes at A$19.84/t (33% of total Cost), Ore 
Production – Level at A$5.37/t (9% of the total Cost) and Backfill at A$10.02/t (16% of the total 
Cost).

Operating Cost Breakdown – Average Cost per Tonne Mined 

Figure 20-4:  Operating Cost Breakdown (Total Cost & Cost per Tonne) 

 

20.6.4 Transportation and Milling Costs 

The ore is intended to be processed through the Jubilee mill which Dioro has acquired from 
Harmony Gold as part of its South Kalgoorlie acquisition (see Section 18).  In the 2007 DFS a 
representative cost of A$19/t for Processing and A$6/t for transportation from the mine to the mill 
has been incorporated in the cost model.  The costing of the project is based on the assumption that 
all the ore produced from Frog's Leg will be processed at Jubilee at the given rate of A$19/t. 

As Dioro is a 49% partner in the Frog's Leg operation and they have ownership of the Jubilee mill, 
there will be a positive offset in the milling cost as 49% (Dioro's Component) of the mill 
throughput will be milled at a lower cost of A$13/t for processing plus the A$6/t cost of 
transportation. 

20.6.5 Project Evaluation and Project Cost Analysis 

This Project Evaluation presented in this section is based on the Frog's Leg 2007 DFS which only 
includes Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource.  This is the part of the Resource considered to 
be estimated with sufficient confidence geologically to have economic considerations applied to it.   

The DFS indicates that with a gold price of A$845/oz the cumulative undiscounted cash flow for 
the entire project will be A$100.9 Million over a mine life of 7.5 years.  This equates to an NPV of 
A$53.6M at a discount rate of 12% and an IRR of 47.5%.  A summary of the project evaluation as 
a total project and from January 2008 (assuming the costs from 2007 are sunk costs) is highlighted 
in Table 20-5. 

The costs for the mining operating and capital cost as well as the transportation and processing 
costs have been dealt with as contracts with suppliers and joint venture partners and are within 
industrial norms.

20.6.6 Sensitivity Analysis 

The financial model assumed fixed cost and price assumptions for the life of the project.  There has 
been no inflation added.  To demonstrate the project's economic performance by changing the 
inputs assumptions independently a sensitivity analysis was conducted.  The input parameters that 
were evaluated included: 

• Gold Price 
• Gold Grade 
• Mill Recovery 
• Operating Cost 
• Transportation and Milling Cost 
• Capital Cost 

The sensitivity swing (range) was set at plus or minus 20% of the study assumptions.  As expected 
the most sensitive parameters to the economics of this project is the gold price and gold grade 
followed closely by the mill recovery.  This is outlined in the Tornado Graph in Figure 20-5. 

A second sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine what the input parameter would be 
required to produce a zero NPV as shown in Table 20-8.  The results highlight that an independent 
drop of 16% in the top input parameters (Price, Grade and Mill Recovery) would result in zero 
NPV.

20.7 Summary of 2007 DFS 

The project assessment is based upon the DFS prepared by LMR.  The Frog's Leg mine will be 
accessed by decline with Longhole bench stoping with backfill being the main method of ore 
production.  

The present mine production planned is to produce 3.65Mt of ore at an average grade of 5.29g/t.  
The average annual mine production is 540,000tpa once steady state production has been reached.  
This equates to a total recovery of 589,944 ounces of gold being produced over the life of mine. 

The project assessment concludes that the project could provide an undiscounted accumulative cash 
flow of A$100.9M over a mine life of 7.5 years.  The NPV at 12% cost of capital is A$55.6M.  The 
resulting IRR is 47.5%.  The underground project has already commenced with 31% of the total 
capital cost or A$22.3M already spent or forecasted to be spent by the end of December 2007.  The 
full cash cost to recover one ounce of gold (inclusive of Capital) would be in the order of A$674. 

20.8 Environmental Considerations 

The following section includes discussion and comment on the environmental management aspects 
of the Frog's Leg project.  Specifically, detail and comment is included on the status of 
environmental legislation applicable to the tenement and operational activities, this includes 
compliance with legislation and environmental authorisations; environmental policies and 
management; key liabilities and risks over the life of the operation for each area; and 
decommissioning and closure liabilities and any associated risks thereof.   

For the purposes of this Technical Report, the criteria used for assessment are those required by the 
host country legislation and generally accepted practice in the mining industry as applied in 
Western Australia. 

This section of the Technical Report is based on: a review of relevant environmental 
documentation provided to SRK (Annual Environmental Reports, compliance assessments, Mining 
Proposals), Environmental Management Program Reports (and amendments), closure liability 
documentation and discussions with relevant staff.   

A site visit was not made as part of the review.

20.9 Legislation 

Mining operations on tenements in Australia must be developed and operated in compliance with 
Commonwealth and their respective State or Territory environmental legislative requirements.  
Within Australia's federal system of government, both the regulation of mining operations and the 
protection of the environment are principally State responsibilities.   

The powers of the Commonwealth to regulate mining and other activities concerning the 
environment are primarily contained in Section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution.  Of 
particular importance are the trade and commerce power; the taxation power; the quarantine power; 
the corporations power; the external affairs power; the power over Commonwealth 
instrumentalities and the public service; the power over customs, excise and bounties; the financial 
assistance power; and the territories power.  Importantly, where any law of a State or Territory is 
inconsistent with a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law prevails, and the Commonwealth 
therefore has the ability to over-ride State laws should it choose to do so in areas within its 
legislative competence. 

20.9.1 Australian Commonwealth 

Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 as regulated by the 
Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEWR):  This is applicable where 
Commonwealth approval is considered necessary due to matters of national significance, which 
include presence of migratory birds, federally listed rare flora or fauna, Commonwealth land, 
nuclear actions and marine areas.  Unless there are exceptional circumstances, DEWR will delegate 
the approval process and day-to-day administration of the mines back to State and Territory 
governments.  This approach minimises unnecessary duplication in administrative processes. 

20.9.2 Western Australia 

Mining Act 1978 as regulated by the Department of Industry and Resources (DoIR):  Before 
commencement of any mining operation, the proponent is required to submit a Mining Proposal 
(MP) (previously termed a Notice of Intent) to DoIR.  The MP describes the project, surrounding 
environment, potential environmental impacts and proposed prevention and mitigation measures.  
Commitments made within the MP are binding for any future operations on these tenements unless 
a request for an amendment to the relevant government authorities is accepted. 

Environmental Protection Act 1986 as regulated by Environment Protection Authority (EPA):  
DoIR, as the decision making authority for mining projects, is required under Part IV of the Act to 
refer mining projects to the EPA if it considers them likely to have a significant effect on the 
environment.  A Memorandum of Understanding exists between DoIR and the EPA whereby 
projects are considered automatically to have significant effects on the environment if they satisfy 
the criteria listed in Part IV of the Act.  All projects referred to the EPA under Part IV of the 
Environmental Protection Act 1986 are assessed on a case-by-case basis.  Once the EPA has 
received a referral, they assume responsibility for determining the appropriate level of assessment 
for the project. 

The Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) provides technical assistance to the 
EPA.  An environmental assessment document will be prepared in accordance with EPA guidelines 
and environmental guidelines following setting of the formal level of assessment by the EPA.  A 
consultation program with key stakeholders and interested parties will be carried out to identify 
concerns and incorporate any suggestions in developing the proposal.  If the project is formally 
assessed at a Public Environmental Review level or above, then the assessment document must be 
publicly reviewed, for a period typically between eight and ten weeks.  Responses to all public 
comments received must be prepared and submitted to the EPA.  The period for advertising, public 
review and preparation of responses may take between four and six months, depending on the 
complexity of issues and objections to the project proposal.  The EPA will then assess the 



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 68 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

assessment document and proponent response to any public submissions.  An EPA bulletin is 
prepared and submitted to the Minister for Environment for approval and issue of a Ministerial 
Statement.   

If activities to take place during operations are listed as Scheduled Activities under the Act, a 
Works Approval will be required from DEC to allow construction of infrastructure associated with 
these activities.  Typically, Works Approval documentation is submitted concurrently with the MP.  
On completion of construction of such infrastructure, completion certificates must be submitted to 
DEC to confirm the infrastructure has been constructed in accordance with approved design 
criteria.  Subsequent to this, an Environmental Licence is required prior to operation of such 
infrastructure.  Environmental licences are typically renewed on an annual basis.  The EPA may 
determine that no assessment is necessary if the referred proposal is considered to have 
environmentally insignificant effects.  Proposals considered not to warrant assessment under the 
Act are referred back to DoIR, who assess and assign environmental conditions to the proposal's 
tenement conditions upon approval of the environmental documentation.  Vegetation clearing 
approvals will also need to be obtained for projects that are assessed via a MP rather than through 
formal assessment by the EPA.  The Native Vegetation unit within DoIR manages clearing 
approvals for mining related applications located on Mining Act tenements. 

Contaminated Sites Act 2003 as regulated by DEC:  The Act was passed in November 2003 and 
came into effect on 1 December 2006.  Mining operations are now required to comply with 
reporting provisions for known or suspected contaminated sites.  Sites are classified according to 
DEC categories with this information becoming publicly accessible.  Closure planning is required 
to take into account requirements of the Act.  Remediation may be required in some instances.  
Responsibility for remediation can be assigned to previous owners of operations who caused the 
contamination. 

Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 as regulated by the Department of Water (DoW):  
Groundwater Licences (GWL) and Licences to construct or alter wells (CAW) are issued by the 
Department of Water (DoW). 

Other relevant legislation:  Includes: Conservation and Land Management Act 1984; Wildlife 
Conservation Act 1950; Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972; Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990; 
and Mining on Private Property Act 1898. 

20.10 Compliance 

The Mungari East Joint Venture consists of six mining leases (M15/688, M15/689, M15/836, 
M15/837, M15/1188 and M15/1287), two prospecting leases (P15/4676 and P15/4677) and one 
miscellaneous licence - (L15/246).  No known non compliance issues on these leases were 
identified as part of this review. 

Approvals for mining operations have been obtained from DoIR using the NOI (now MP) process.  
Open pit operations were approved via NOI 4401 in October 2003.  Underground mining 
operations were approved via NOI 4786 in September 2004.  Changes to underground mining plans 
resulted in submission of a Mining Proposal to DoIR in April 2007 amending NOI 4786.  This 
addressed recommencement of mining, specifically underground mining from within the Frog's 
Leg open pit.  This was approved in July 2007. 

Frog's Leg is licensed by DEC (Licence Number 7887/4).  The licence allows the following 
prescribed activities: Category 64 - Putrescible Landfill Site; Category 06 - Mine Dewatering (to 
White Foil Pit to occur on tenements M15/688, M15/1407, L16/28, L15/228 and L15/246).   

In addition to the Environmental Licence, Frog's Leg holds one Groundwater Well Licence (GWL 
151762/2) for M15/688.  This stipulates water allocation, use and conditions of abstraction, 



SRK Consulting 
DIO001_Frog's Leg 43-101 Report Page 69 

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

monitoring and mitigation of adverse effects of abstraction.  Removal of groundwater from the 
Frog's Leg open pit has continued during the care and maintenance period. 

An internal compliance review against DoIR tenement conditions and NOI voluntary commitments 
was conducted as part of the 2006 Annual Environmental Report.  . LMR has reported to the DEC 
suspected hydrocarbon contamination and saline water contamination associated with mining lease 
M15/688, the mining lease upon which the Frog's Leg open pit is located.  Currently, the DEC has 
not classified or confirmed that this will be considered to be a contaminated site.  SRK considers 
this to be a minor issue, reported to ensure compliance with the Contaminated Sites Act (2003).  
The issue has an immaterial financial impact and can be adequately addressed through closure 
planning.  No other non compliances were identified for M15/688 or L15/246 

Clearing permits have not been required for the project to date.  Recommencement of underground 
mining is unlikely to require clearing permits to be obtained in the future as disturbance areas are 
within an annual exemption applicable to approved mining projects. 

20.11 Policy and Management 

An Environmental Management Plan was prepared for the previous project and accreditation with 
ISO14001 was achieved.  No assessment of compliance with ISO14001 has been undertaken since 
the proj3ect was placed on care and maintenance. 

20.12 Environmental Issues 

The material environmental issues for Frog's Leg are discussed below along with any associated 
liabilities (items for which a monetary value can be determined) and risks (items where levels of 
uncertainty make any monetary estimate impractical). 

20.12.1 Previous Operations 

Total land disturbance for the Frog's Leg project was about 86Ha of which about 82Ha was on 
M15/688.  Of the total disturbance, about 6Ha has been rehabilitated.  Rehabilitation activities were 
suspended as a result of investigations into recommencement of mining.  Outstanding rehabilitation 
is planned to be completed as part of recommencement of mining activities.  Future rehabilitation 
will reportedly be undertaken in compliance with a documented Rehabilitation Plan. 

Geochemical investigations have been conducted for waste rock.  The majority was found to be 
non acid forming, (NAF), however black shale waste does have potential to be acid forming.  
Given that less than five percent of waste rock was black shale, this was able to be managed via 
encapsulation within NAF waste in the out of pit waste rock dump.  No acid drainage issues have 
been identified as part of care and maintenance monitoring. 

Soil characterisation studies identified some topsoil and oxide waste stockpiled for rehabilitation 
has high electrical conductivity and may be unsuitable for vegetation establishment.  Soil 
characterisation studies have allowed selective use of stockpiled oxide waste and topsoil materials 
to minimise the risk of adverse impacts on rehabilitation.  Materials not suitable for use in 
rehabilitation have been or are planned to be buried within the waste rock dump. 

No contaminated sites have been reported on M15/688 or L15/246. 

20.12.2 Recommenced Mining Operations 

Planned commencement of underground mining has been subject to submission of a Mining 
Proposal.  Total land disturbance associated with recommencement of mining on is small (less than 
7Ha for tenement M15/688). This is a result of infrastructure being located on existing disturbed 
areas and re use of remaining infrastructure.

DG/GM/PW/srl 3058548_1.DOC January 2008 

Waste characterisation studies do not address underground waste specifically.  Waste rock 
developed during underground mining will largely remain underground and as such environmental 
risks associated with disposal of potentially acid forming waste can be considered negligible. 

Dewatering of the Frog's Leg pit is required to continue for the duration of underground mining.  
Existing dewatering approvals and infrastructure will be used.  Water will be disposed of in the 
nearby White Flag Lake as part of a joint agreement with Barrick.  No environmental liabilities 
exist as a result of continuation of this activity. 

20.13 Mine Closure and Bonds 

Frog's Leg project area currently has a total bond amount of $911,000 lodged for tenements 
M15/688, M15/1407 and L15/246.  Additionally, a bond of $5000 is lodged for adjacent tenement 
M15/1287.  The bond for tenements M15/688, M15/1407 and L15/246 was reviewed as part of 
approval of the Mining Proposal in July 2007 and is unlikely to significantly increase in the short 
term. 

Closure costing undertaken for the Frog's Leg project in 2006 estimated a total closure cost of 
A$1,001,035.  Rehabilitation of the out of pit waste rock dump and ROM Pad account for about 
59% of closure costs.  The methodology used to identify disturbance types, allocate closure tasks 
and apply costs was thorough and the resultant closure cost is considered realistic.  The closure cost 
applies to the complete Frog's Leg project and is not broken down by tenement.  Closure costs for 
the two tenements part owned by Dioro are not specified.   

A specific closure plan for recommencement of mining was prepared during 2006/07 and has been 
provided to DoIR as part of Mining Proposal commitments. 

20.14 Liability Estimate 

SRK has identified liabilities which have been preliminarily estimated.  The identified and 
quantifiable liabilities are given in Table 20-9.

21 Interpretation and Conclusions 
The Frog's Leg deposit is located in the southern portion of the well-endowed Kundana gold 
mining district, which includes several operating open-pit and underground mines.  It is near the 
town of Kalgoorlie, which is the regional centre for gold mining in Western Australia. 

Frog's Leg mineralisation occurs in a number of structural and alteration styles over a nine-hundred 
metre-long NNW trending zone.  The two main lodes are sub-vertical and tabular and occur along a 
sheared volcanoclastic/catrock basalt contact.  They are referred to as Mist and Rocket.  In addition 
quartz lode mineralisation occurs in the footwall primarily east of the contact zone within 
volcanoclastics as somewhat irregular vein structures that dip towards the west into the sub-vertical 
contact zone.  Less frequently quartz vein structures occur on the hanging wall side of the contact 
such as the Fog, west of the Mist contact zone, and the Whistle, west of the Rocket.  Structure and 
differences in rock properties play a major role in gold deposition. 

The latest June 2007 measured and indicated resource estimate by LMR is 3,221,000t at an average 
grade of 7.0g/t for a contained gold resource of 723,000oz.  Dioro's 49%-attributable share is 
354,270oz.   

The June 2007 resource estimate includes new information from core holes that were drilled 
between October 2006 and May 2007.  The new measured and indicated resource estimate 
represents an increase of 130% in tonnes and 96% in ounces, compared to the measured and 
indicated resources from the last publicly-released estimate of April 2007.  This increase is due to 
two main factors: 1) infill drilling that converted large zones of inferred resources to indicated 
resources and 2) re-interpretations of the shapes and boundaries of the Frog's Leg lodes and the 
gold mineralisation associated with them. 

Previous mining by means of open pit occurred at Frog's Leg from April 2004 to October 2005 
which was primarily from the steeply-dipping foot-wall quartz lodes in the Rocket zone.  The 
production totalled 832,976t of ore.  Ore was trucked to the Greenfields toll mill where 116,011oz 
of gold was recovered (96.8% recovery) at a head grade of 4.50g/t.  Mining was carried out on a 
contract basis at a final stripping ratio of 15.7 to 1.   

Frog's Leg ore is easily treatable via CIP processing.  Testing has confirmed an absence of 
metallurgical issues and has indicated a high gravity recovery component - ranging from 60.6% to 
78.9% for quartz lode and 21.8% to 48.5% for contact material.  This is underscored by open pit 
production which has effectively provided an 800,000 tonne bulk sample, from which gold 
recovery averaged 96.8% at the Greenfields toll mill.  There should be little variation from this 
recovery elsewhere within the deposit.  A toll-milling arrangement or acquisition of a suitable 
facility is an issue remaining to be resolved, but Dioro will be able to treat its share of the 
production at the Jubilee mill it has recently acquired. 

Based on all metallurgical test work conducted to date LMR has concluded:   

"...Frog's Leg ore responds well to conventional CIL plant treatment using a 
grind size of P80 106 micron.  The recovery for ore grading 5.31 gAu/t as in the 
DFS is expected to be 94.9%.  A higher recovery may be possible with the plant 
if preferential grinding of sulfides is achieved.  Lower recovery is unlikely as 
the majority of the test samples achieved recovery above the average shown." 

The Frog's Leg deposit will be mined by means of an underground decline.  The 2007 DFS 
indicates that an average production rate of 545,000t per annum at full capacity.  The average grade 
is 5.29g/t.  The ore will be produced by means of Longhole Open Stoping with fill.  The high in 
situ stress environment and the competent rock quality result in a seismically active mining 
environment.  This seismicity risk is being minimised by adopting a 'bottom up' mining

sequence/retreat front which systematically pushes the stress field and requires the completion of 
most of the pre-mining development prior to stope extraction. 

An assessment of the 2007 DFS indicates that with a gold price of A$845/oz results in a cumulative 
non-discounted Cash Flow of A$100.9M over a mine life of 7.5 years.  The cash cost to recover 
one ounce of gold is estimated to be A$674.  With a discount rate of 12% the project's NPV is 
A$53.56M.  As one third of the capital expenditure will been spent by the 31 December 2007 and 
assuming this A$22.3M is categorised as sunk costs the resulting NPV going forward from January 
2008 is A$77.3M.  The project carries an IRR of 47.5%.  This project assessment is based on the 
2007 DFS which includes only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource. This is the part of the 
Resource considered to be estimated with sufficient confidence geologically to have economic 
considerations applied to it.

22 Recommendations 
Because of the 'bottom-up' mining approach dictated by the area's seismicity it is imperative to 
gain some understanding as to where the lowest level of exploitation may be prior to the start of 
underground production.  This means that a certain amount of delineation via deep drilling may 
become mandatory at an early stage to provide complete information for an overall mining concept. 

At Frog's Leg an important goal would be to expand the resource base and extend the mine life to 
at least 10 years.  Doing so would enable the operation to lower capital expenditures on a per tonne 
basis and, above all, justify purchase or acquisition of a mill – both of which would lower cut-off 
grade and unit production costs.   

Continued exploration on the various tenements held in the district with the objective of defining 
new deposits or delineating/expanding resources on one or more of the known bodies in order to 
enhance possible "economics of scale" accruing to exploitation of multiple deposits in the same 
general area.  Any advancement to a subsequent phase or expansion would be contingent on 
positive results in the previous phase.

Resources Australia and Dioro Exploration NL.  I have not visited the site. 

7. I have had prior involvement with the properties that are the subject of the Technical Report.  
The nature of my prior involvement is visiting several sites for technical consulting for 
previous operators, and preparing a regional geological interpretation map of the area as part 
of work for SRK Consulting. 

8. To the best of my knowledge, information and belief, the technical report contains all 
scientific and technical information that is required to be disclosed to make the technical 
report not misleading. I am not aware of any material fact or material change with respect to 
the subject matter of the Technical Report that is not reflected in the Technical Report, the 
omission to disclose which makes the Technical Report misleading.

10. I have read NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 and the Technical Report has been prepared in 

compliance with that instrument and form. 
11. I consent to the filing of the Technical Report with any stock exchange or any other regulatory 

authority and any publication by them for regulatory purposes, including electronic 
publication in the public company files on their website and accessible by the public, of the 
Technical Report.
