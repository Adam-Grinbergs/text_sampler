EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Endeavour Mining Corporation, through its 100% owned subsidiary Avion Gold (Burkina Faso) 
SARL, has a 100% interest in the approximately 1,000 square kilometre Houndé Gold Project, 
situated in the South-western region of Burkina Faso.  Ownership upon achieving production will be 
90% by Endeavour and 10% by the government of Burkina Faso.  

The Houndé Project feasibility study (FS) focuses on the Vindaloo group of deposits that are 
located approximately 250 km Southwest of Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso.  The 
deposits are approximately 2.7 km from a paved highway and as close as 200 metres from a 
225 kV power line that extends from Cote d'Ivoire through to Ouagadougou.  The nearby town of 
Houndé has a population of approximately 22,000.  A rail line that extends to the port of Abidjan, 
Cote d'Ivoire lies approximately 25 km west of the deposit area. 

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd. was the FS study lead consultant with a focus on study coordination, 
metallurgy, infrastructure design and process plant design.  Cube Consulting completed an 
updated mineral resource estimate.  Knight Piésold Pty. Ltd. carried out pit and site geotechnical 
reviews, completed a water balance study and designed the tailings storage facility, water harvest 
dam and the water storage dam along with mine site drainage control elements. Orelogy completed 
the mine plan and mineral Reserve. 

Mine environmental and social studies were completed under the lead of Genivar Inc. with 
SOCREGE and INGRID collecting social and environmental data, respectively.  INGRID also 
completed an additional environmental and social study on the project's water supply.  Knight 
Piésold provided high level oversight over all of these studies.  

Copies of the studies were presented to the government of Burkina Faso on November 7, 2013. 

The following table presents the parameters used in the study.

The Vindaloo zones are hosted by Proterozoic-age, Birimian Group, intensely sericite- and silica-
altered mafic intrusions and similarly-altered, strongly foliated and altered intermediate to mafic 
volcaniclastics and occasionally sediments.  The mineralization is often quartz stockwork-style and 
is weakly to moderately pyritic.  The Vindaloo trend has been drill tested for a distance of 
approximately 7.7 kilometres along strike and up to 350 metres depth.  The intrusion-hosted zones 
range up to 70 metres in true thickness and average close to 20 metres true thickness along a 
1.2 km section of the zone called Vindaloo Main.  Volcanic- and sediment-hosted zones are 
generally less than 5 m wide.  The entire mineralized package strikes north-northeast and dips 
steeply to the west to vertical.  The mineralization remains open both along strike and to depth.   

Sterilization drilling has led to the recognition of several parallel zones of gold enrichment, one of 
which, the Koho East zone, returned a drill intercept of 1.22 g/t Au over 21.0 metres.  Several of 
these zones have the potential to add resources to the project. 

Studies of 22 metallurgical samples from the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones indicated average 
assumed mill recoveries of 93.37%.  Recoveries of 93.5%, for the Vindaloo Main zone fresh 
mineralization, were achieved by fine grinding of gravity concentrates to 80% passing 10 micron 
from an initial grind of 80% passing 90 micron.  More than 70% of the gold is contained in the 
gravity concentrates.

During Q4, 2012 and Q1, 2013, Endeavour completed 40,534 metres of drilling in 358 holes with a 
specific goal of upgrading the Inferred in-pit mineral resources to Indicated resources and some 
Indicated mineral resources to Measured mineral resources.  Endeavour's drilling in conjunction 
with previous drilling comprises a drill database of 751 core and RC holes totalling 103,677 meters 
that supported the creation of an updated, in-pit mineral resources statement, which is summarized 
below.

The FS considered the owner operated development of five open pits over the Vindaloo and 
Madras NW zones over an 8.5 year time period, including 3 months of pre-strip.  The Vindaloo pit 
would mine a series of closely spaced gold zones along an approximate 4.8 km strike length.  The 
Madras NW pits would be mined along an approximately 900 metres long zone and would only 
mine saprolite and transition mineralization.  Diluted proven and probable mineral reserves total 
24.64 million tonnes grading 1.95 g/t Au totalling 1.55 million ounces (see table below).  As well, 
660,000 tonnes of inferred mineral resources grading 1.61 g/t Au lie within the pit envelope.

A water balance study indicated that a water harvest dam and separate water storage dam having 
combined storage of just over 3 million cubic metres would easily fill in one wet season and would 
contain sufficient water for plant operations demand during a 1:100 year dry season.  Camp water 
would be sourced from nearby wells. 

The processing plant consists of a 3.0 million tonne per year CIL plant with SABC milling circuit to 
produce an 80% passing 90 micron grind size.  Ground fresh ore will feed continuous centrifugal 
gravity concentrators to recover free and occluded gold in heavy particles (pyrite) to a low mass 
gravity concentrate.  This concentrate will be reground to 80% passing 10 micron grind size to feed 
a concentrate leach circuit.  Gravity concentration tails will be thickened and feed a standard CIL 
circuit, with leach tails passing into a cyanide destruction process before being pumped to storage.  
Average production of 178,000 ozs/year over a period of 8.1 years is anticipated with a high of 
215,200 ozs in year 2 and low of 136,800 ozs in year 7.

The tailings storage facility is located 4 km west of the plant in a natural valley.  Studies indicate 
that the tailings storage does not need to be lined as the near-surface, clay-rich substrate would 
limit migration of tailings fluids away from the site.  Decant fluids, though, are not suitable for 
release to the environment and will be pumped back to the plant.  An impact assessment, including 
a dam break scenario, indicates a high consequence in the event of a wall failure and the tailings 
embankments were designed to reduce this risk.  Closure will require covering the surface with 
0.5 metres of broken rock.  The facility has the potential to hold up to 100% more than is currently 
designed. 

Power for the processing plant will come from the adjacent 225 kV power line that extends from 
Cote d'Ivoire to Ouagadougou.  Sonabel, the state power entity, have agreed, in principle, to sell 
power to the project; however, the terms and conditions of this sale have not been defined. 

Project staff will include approximately 470 people, not including catering and cleaning staff and 
miscellaneous contractors with 41 international and African expats and 430 Burkinabe employees.  
A camp to house 130 senior staff will be installed with the remaining employees living in the nearby 
communities. 

An environmental and social impact and mitigation study, with a goal to be IFC complaint, was 
completed.  The study outlines Endeavour's responsibilities to the well being of the people and the 
environment during the development, operation and closure of the Houndé gold project.  The 
project will require the acquisition of 2,096 ha of land. Several major land owners own the bulk of 
the land, however, numerous subsistence farmers rent portions of the land from the land owners.  
Compensation mechanisms for the land, buildings, trees and crops are part of the ongoing 
permitting process.  Typical concerns, as a result of the project development include changes to 
quality of life, loss of livelihood, environmental degradation, potential for jobs, potential health 
issues, increase in traffic etc.  Permitting is expected to take approximately a year to complete. 

Houndé Capital Cost Estimate 

The total estimated cost to bring the Houndé Gold Project into production is approximately 
$314.8 million, inclusive of contingency and working capital and an allowance for VAT and import 
duties.  Additional deferred capital including closure costs, totals 87.6 million.

Houndé PEA Financial Summary 

The Houndé Project generates the following financial results: 

� At $1,300/oz gold price (Base Case) Post-Tax 

- NPV at 5% discount rate totals $230.2 million 

- IRR =  22.45% 

- Payback 2.84 years from commencement of production 

- Cash cost per ounce produced - $635.69/oz (excluding royalties) 

- Cash cost per ounce produced - $713.65/oz (including royalties). 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Independent studies of the mineral resources, metallurgy, mine plan, processing plant, capital 
costs, construction costs, environmental and social impact and relocation expenses have been 
carried out for the Houndé Project.  These studies and subsequent cash flow model concluded that 
the project had an acceptable rate of return, even at current depressed gold prices and that 
Endeavour should proceed with project development.  Should the project be developed, it is 
estimated that approximately 55% of the project's net revenues would go to the state with a cash 
benefit of US$330 million over the project life.

1.2 Property, Access and History 

Endeavour's Houndé license area is situated in the southwestern region of Burkina Faso, West 
Africa (Figure 1.2.1).  Administratively it is in the provinces of Tuy and Mouhoun.  

The Houndé project Feasibility Study focuses on the Vindaloo and Madras NW group of deposits 
that are located approximately 250 km southwest of Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso.  
The deposits are approximately 2.7 km from a paved highway and as close as 200 metres from a 
225 kV power line that extends from Cote d'Ivoire through to Ouagadougou.  The nearby city of 
Houndé contains approximately 22,000 people.  A rail line that extends to the port of Abijan, Cote 
d'Ivoire lies approximately 25 km West of the deposit area with a rail siding at the community of 
Béréba.

1.3 Licence Status 

The Houndé Property comprises six individual exploration licenses (Permis de Recherche), for a 
total of 1005.65 km2, with an additional 110.96 km2 under application.  The exploration licenses are 
held by Avion Gold (Burkina Faso) SARL, ("Avion Burkina"), a company incorporated in Burkina 
Faso on January 29, 2010 and owned by Endeavour Mining Corporation.   

A letter from legal counsel, Kere Avocats dated August 13, 2012 re: "Title Opinion on the 
Exploration Permits and related rights held by Avion Burkina, in Burkina Faso", gives the opinion 
that all exploration permits and related rights were indeed held by Avion Burkina and were in good 
standing (Table 1.3.1).

1.4 Geology and Mineralization 

The geology of West and Central Africa is dominated by Precambrian shields or cratons of 
Archaean and Lower Proterozoic age, Pan-African mobile zones of Upper Proterozoic age and 
intracratonic sedimentary basins ranging from the Proterozoic to the Quaternary.  

The geology of Burkina Faso can be subdivided into three major litho-tectonic domains: (1) a 
Paleoproterozoic (Birimian) basement underlying most of the country, (2) a Neoproterozoic 
sedimentary cover developed along the western, northern, and south-eastern portions of the 
country, and (3) a Cenozoic mobile belt forming small inliers in the northwestern and extreme 
eastern regions of the country. 

The Birimian crust in the project area comprises the following lithologies from bottom to top: (1) a 
thick sequence of mafic rocks, including basalt, locally pillowed, as well as dolerite and gabbro, all 
of tholeiitic composition, locally inter-layered with immature detrital sediments and limestone, (2) a 
detrital sedimentary pile (volcanics, turbidite, mudstone, and carbonate) including inter-bedded 
calc-alkaline volcanics, and (3) a coarse clastic sedimentary sequence belonging to the Tarkwaian 
Group.  During the Eburnean orogeny, the volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks were subjected to 
crustal shortening associated with greenschist facies regional metamorphism.  Locally, amphibolite 
metamorphic facies are reached, but these occurrences are interpreted as resulting from contact 
metamorphism. 

Rocks in the immediate Vindaloo and Madras NW zones comprises north- to northeast-trending 
greenschist-metamorphosed intermediate volcanics and sediments that are intruded by later 
gabbro sills and dykes. 

The Vindaloo zones are hosted by an intensely sericite- and silica-altered mafic intrusion and 
similarly-altered, sheared and altered intermediate to mafic volcanoclastics.  The mineralization is 
often quartz stockwork-style and is weakly to moderately pyritic.  The entire mineralized package 
strikes north-northeast and dips steeply to the west to vertical.  Drilling along the approximate 
1.2 kilometre strike of the central core of the Vindaloo gold system has defined a coherent gold-
mineralized, apparently shallow south plunging, zone that has been traced to at least 350 metres 
depth.  Along strike, both to the north and south of the core of the Vindaloo zone, the gold 
mineralization can vary from weak to quite strong over relatively short, vertical or horizontal 
distances, leading to nodes of higher grade mineralization connected by zones of weaker gold 
mineralization.

The Vindaloo trend has been drill tested for a distance of approximately 7.7 kilometres along strike.  
The Vindaloo deposit open pit resources comprise a group of closely-spaced gold-mineralized 
structures that currently represent an approximate 4.8 km section of the Vindaloo Zone and a 
0.9 km long section of the Madras NW zone.  Modelling work has outlined 39 separate, 
semi-parallel lenses of mineralization, that are up to approximately 70 metres wide, that comprise 
the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones, of which 6 of the lenses contain the bulk of the mineral 
resources.  

The Vindaloo zone mineralization is open along strike and to depth.  Within and adjacent to the 
modelled area, there are indications of additional hanging wall parallel gold zones and 
gold-mineralized cross-structures.  These areas are under-explored and need follow-up.  There is a 
reasonable likelihood that additional drilling will result in additional mineral resources. 

1.5 Exploration and Drilling 

Mineral exploration in the Houndé area began in the 1939 by the Bureau de Recherches 
Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) and Bureau de Mines et de la Géologie du Burkina Faso 
(BUMIGEB) and continued to 1982.  Exploration resumed in the 90's with a group of companies 
that initially carried out regional geochemical surveys that were followed up by mode detailed 
geochemistry, prospecting, mapping and RAB to RC drilling as follow-up.  Several gold zones were 
identified during this work, most of which still require follow-up today. 

Endeavour initiated an in-fill drill program over the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones in late October 
2012, with a goal to convert Inferred mineral resources to Indicated Mineral Resources and some 
of the Indicated mineral resources to Measured Mineral Resources.  This program consisted of 
358 holes totalling 40,534 metres.  Including this drill program, during the period from 2007 to 
2013, Endeavour, Avion Gold, Goldbelt and African Barrick completed 751 core and RC holes 
totalling 103,677 meters along the trend of the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones.  All of this data 
has been digitized, incorporated into section sets, interpreted and used as the basis for this study.  
The data from these exploration programs is used in the current Mineral Resource estimate. 

1.6 Mineral Resource 

The updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Vindaloo deposits was completed by Cube in June 
2013.  This estimate represents an update of the Mineral Resources previously reported in the 
March 2013 PEA.  All estimation work was carried out using SURPAC mining software and Isatis 
geostatistical software.  Grade interpolation for gold has used Ordinary Block Kriging (OK) of 
downhole composite drill data. 

The Vindaloo mineral resource is reported inside an optimized pit shell.  The results from the 
optimized pit shell are used solely for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have 
reasonable prospects for economic extraction, and the optimization was based on the following 
economic parameters: 

� US$1,600/oz Au price, 

� 94.7% to 97.7% saprolite recovery depending on zone,

� 88.1% to 94.1% transition zone recovery depending on zone, 

� 79% to 94% fresh zone recovery depending on zone, 

� $11.58 /t saprolite zone processing cost, including G&A of $0.99/t, 

� $12.94 /t transition zone processing cost, including G&A of $0.99/t, 

� $16.32 /t fresh zone processing cost, including G&A of $0.99/t, 

� $2.11/t average mining cost, 

� 31.6 to 54.0 degree pit slopes with the shallowest slopes generally in saprolite zones. 

The Mineral Resource estimate was carried out using CIM guidelines (CIM 2005) by Cube 
Consulting and is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.35 g/t Au (Table 1.6.1), with an effective date of 
July 18, 2012.

A general site layout is presented in Figure 1.7.1.  

Figure 1.7.1 Houndé Gold Project – Site Layout 

Overall wall slopes were derived from the inter-ramp angles recommended by Peter O'Bryan and 
Associates, independent geotechnical consultants commissioned by Knight Piésold.  ORELOGY 
utilised these parameters to develop the overall slopes for the optimisation, with the final wall 
slopes developed for five areas of the deposit. 

Deposit characteristics and mining practices to be adopted led ORELOGY to estimate that the 
amount of mixing at ore / waste boundaries should be limited to a 1 m wide zone only, resulting in 
average values for dilution and ore loss within the Measured / Indicated orebody of 6.5% and 5.2% 
respectively.

The mining fleet used for developing the optimisation mining costs was based around a Caterpillar 
785 140 tonne truck matched to a Caterpillar 6040 390 tonne excavator.  Haulage costs were 
developed within the block model and flagged into a number of different zones, while drill and blast 
costs were developed from first principles.  The optimisation cost estimate was based on ore grade 
control being carried out using reverse-circulation (RC) drilling in advance of mining.  It was further 
assumed that 80% of the ore mined will be direct tipped to the crusher, and the other 20% will be 
stockpiled on the RoM pad and require rehandling with a loader. 

The financial parameters used in optimisation process are summarised in Table 1.7.1 and a 
discount rate of 5% was used.

1.8 Mining 

The mine design followed the concepts of the optimisation cost designs and the scheduling 
process aimed to achieve the following targets during each scheduling period: 

� Plant feed rate of 3.0 Mtpa when the fresh rock proportion of the feed exceeds 75%. 

� The mill feed is allowed to grow by a maximum of 15% in each period when the saprolite 
and transitional ore component exceed 25% of total.  The throughput effects with varying 
proportions of saprolite and transition are shown in Table 1.8.1.  

� A maximum plant feed grade of 4.0 g/t Au.

Figure 1.8.1 Processing Plant Feed Schedule 

A groundwater investigation in the Vindaloo Pit area identified no primary aquifers in the vicinity of 
the Vindaloo Pit.  Bulk permeability and storativity values were predicted to be low and to be largely 
controlled by the weathering profile and possible deeper fracturing / faulting.  Based on standard 
analytical flow equations the estimated groundwater inflow to the pit (excluding incident rainfall and 
surface water runoff) is 6 L/s when the Vindaloo Pit is fully developed.  

1.9 Metallurgical 

1.9.1 Testwork 

The metallurgical treatment route selected has been based on the results of testwork conducted on 
five primary ore composites and 22 individual variability samples from five mining areas and three 
levels of weathering.  The primary ores represent approximately 82% of the deposit with saprolite 
and transition ores making up the remaining 18%.  Primary ore from the Vindaloo pit makes up 
80% of the primary ores and is the major component of the Houndé deposit. 

Comminution testwork indicated that the primary ores will require moderate grinding energy and 
have moderate abrasivity; however, the ores are highly competent and display a high resistance to 
impact breakage. 

Initial gravity concentrates for all ores contained an average of 60% of the feed gold in 6% of the 
feed mass, but subsequent tests of the primary ores indicated that greater than 70% of the gold 
was recovered to a 2% mass gravity concentrate.  Regrinding the concentrate to 80% passing (P80)
10 μm prior to leaching achieved the largest increase in extraction with the overall gold extraction 
increasing by up to 7%.  Separate leaching of the reground concentrate prior to combined leaching 
with the gravity tails was beneficial.

Grind sensitivity testwork on the primary composites indicated that lower residue grades, faster 
leaching rates and higher gold extractions are achieved with increasing fineness of grind.  
Evaluating these benefits against the increased costs led to selection of an optimum residence time 
of 24 hours with a conservative grind size of P80 90 μm. 

1.9.2 Plant Design 

The process plant will be designed for a nominal 3 Mt/y (9,000 t/d) throughput on the life of mine 
blend ore (88% primary and 12% saprolite + transition ores), although the mine will deliver 
predominantly saprolite and transition ores for the first 18 months of operation.  The design will 
allow the nominal throughput to be achieved in 8,000 operating hours per year. 

The flowsheet comprises a primary jaw crusher feeding a live stockpile and then to a SABC 
comminution circuit with 6 MW SAG and ball mills and recycle pebble crusher, producing a target 
P80 90 μm grind size.  With fresh ore in the feed, the cyclone product will pass through a gravity 
concentration circuit that will extract 2.5% of the feed as concentrate to be reground to P80 of 10 μm 
before intensive leaching.  Saprolite ore and the gravity tails will be thickened and combined with 
the leached gravity concentrate as feed for a standard CIL leach circuit.  A split AARL 6.5 t elution 
circuit will recover the gold for electrowinning and the leach tails will pass to a cyanide destruction 
circuit using the SO2 / air technology to ensure plant tailings comply with the Cyanide Management 
Code.  The leach feed thickener overflow will provide cyanide free water for use in the milling 
circuit, while decant return from the tailings dam will supply process water.   

A moderate level of automation and remote control will be provided, to ensure safe operation of the 
plant and to control process conditions for optimum recovery, while still requiring manual inspection 
of equipment before starting.  Operators will also monitor the plant to ensure that spillage is 
detected and cleaned up quickly and that good housekeeping practices are followed in compliance 
with safe working practices and country regulations. 

1.10 Infrastructure 

1.10.1 Roads 

A new intersection will be constructed on the N1 highway for the 1.5 km long sealed main access 
road to the plant site.  The 1 km long unsealed camp access road will branch off the main road.  
Service roads within the plant will be laterite surface designed for the truck and crane access 
needed for maintenance and delivery of consumables and reagents. 

Access to more remote dams (10 km) and the tailings facility (4.5 km) will be on upgraded existing 
laterite tracks, but the tailings dam access road will be constructed alongside the pipeline corridor 
to provide maintenance access to the pipeline if needed.  Within the plant area, unsealed roads will 
provide access around the processing facilities.

1.10.2 Water Supply 

A water balance model estimated the demand for raw water at 3.3 Mm3 per year.  The annual water 
demand for the process plant amounts to 2.85 Mm3, with an additional 0.54 Mm3 for dust 
suppression.  The demand will be met from TSF decant, pit dewatering (including precipitation on 
the pit area) and runoff from the ROM pad and stockpiles with the shortfall to be supplied from a 
water storage dam which will be fed from a water harvesting dam.  Groundwater resources were 
considered but are expected to be very small; however, they will be sufficient for potable water use. 

1.10.3 Surface Water Management 

Wherever possible, run-off from undisturbed areas will be diverted around the mining and 
processing operations.  Clean run-off that has contacted disturbed areas or dumps will be collected 
in sediment control structures and then discharged, while run-off that has contacted process areas 
or ore piles will be collected and returned to the process plant for use there.  

1.10.4 Tailings Disposal (Tailings Storage Facility) 

The TSF will have a capacity of approximately 25 Mt and it is estimated that the tailings surface at 
full capacity will cover approximately 200 ha.  The selected site has the potential to provide storage 
for up to 50 Mt of tailings by increasing the embankment height and, if required, adding a saddle 
embankment to the south of the facility.  It is expected that the tailings will settle to a density of 
approximately 1.4 t/m3 initially, increasing to 1.6 t/m3 to give an overall final density of 1.55 t/m3.

The tailings acid base accounting indicated that the tailings would be acid consuming and assay 
results showed that the tailings solids had a low number of elemental enrichments, with arsenic, 
selenium and antimony significantly enriched and chromium slightly enriched.  A comparison with 
soil intervention guidelines indicated that a number of element concentrations will exceed the 
guidelines, thus requiring a cover system designed to isolate the tailings facility from the 
environment on closure to prevent migration of tailings. 

Arsenic and antimony were present in the supernatant liquor at levels which would require dilution 
before releasing into aquatic systems as surface flows.  It will therefore be required to store up to a 
1 in 100 year wet event on the TSF without release to the environment and a suitable seepage 
reduction system will be required to reduce the risk of tailings supernatant affecting the 
groundwater.  Seepage analysis site indicated that the in-situ saprolite will provide a suitably low 
permeability layer. 

A dam break analysis of the TSF embankments resulted in the classification of the facility as a 
"High" consequence rating.  As a result Embankment 2, which has the largest potential impact in 
the event of a failure, was designed to mitigate this risk by using the downstream construction 
method, while Embankment 1 and Embankment 3, which are lower risk, will be built downstream 
for Stage 1 and centreline for subsequent stages. 

At closure, the embankments will be rehabilitated and revegetated and the TSF surface will be 
covered with a layer of waste rock and a soil layer and shaped to be free draining towards the 
closure spillway.

1.10.5 Dumps 

Waste Storage Facility (WSF) shells have been designed with the standoff distance between the 
pits and the waste storage facilities determined in accordance with safety bund requirements by the 
Department of Industry and Resources of Western Australia. 

In order to realise cost savings now, rather than a potential cost saving at some point in the future 
it, was decided to allow the eastern WSF to be constructed on the Koho zone.  No consideration 
was given to stand off distances between WSFs and villages or heritage sites as none were 
apparent in the vicinity of the mining area.  

WSFs are constructed in 20 m high lifts with 37 degree face angles and are later reworked into 
their final landform during the WSF rehabilitation process. 

1.10.6 Power Supply and Distribution 

A major 225 kV power line supplying power to Burkina Faso from Cote d'Ivoire is located adjacent 
to the plant site.  Sonabel, the national power company, has agreed in principle to sell the project 
power.  However, the means and final cost details have not been negotiated yet.  The preferred 
option is to erect a sub-station on this line to provide power to the mine and processing operations 
at 11 kV. 

The mine and processing plant installed load is estimated to be 26 MW, with an average demand 
of 15.5 MW, which will be supplied to the plant HV switchroom near the mills.  The large loads (mill 
motors and elution heater) will be supplied at 11 kV, with power distributed to the remaining drives 
at 415 V from local switchrooms and motor control centres. 

Remote loads (the camp, tailings decant pumps, water dam transfer pumps and street lighting at 
the highway intersection) will be supplied by 11 kV overhead lines, with pole-top transformers 
reducing the voltage to 415 V. 

1.10.7 Accommodation Camp 

It is anticipated that a significant proportion of the workforce will be recruited from Burkina Faso, 
with a preference to those from the Houndé area, and reside in Houndé town; however, permanent 
accommodation to house 130 senior operations and mining workforce personnel will be provided 
approximately one kilometre to the north of the process plant for expatriates and personnel from 
outside the local district.  Blockwork construction on concrete slabs and steel trussed roofs will be 
used for the kitchen, dining and common facilities, as well as for the larger rooms reserved for 
management, whilst converted sea containers will be used for the junior staff rooms. 

1.10.8 Buildings and Support Facilities 

The process plant support facilities will generally be constructed of a concrete slab on ground with 
structural steel frame and metal cladding.  Office and amenity areas associated with the main 
structures will generally be of blockwork construction, but other facilities such as ablutions, control 
room, switchrooms, etc., will be prefabricated.

The mine services facilities allowed include a heavy vehicle washdown bay with water recycle, a 
workshop and warehouse and an administration building with shift change facilities, including toilets 
and showers. 

Sewage from the accommodation camp, process plant and mining services facilities will be 
collected and treated in two separate package treatment facilities.  Treated effluent from the 
accommodation camp will be discharged to a leach field or a surface spray field, while the treated 
effluent from the plant site and mining services area will be discharged into the tails hopper.   

General solid wastes will be deposited into a landfill, but dangerous materials such as cyanide 
packaging, will be incinerated on site to prevent unauthorised use.

The estimates have been prepared from first principles, but do not make any allowance for 
escalation from the date of the estimate or any variation in exchange rates.  The schedule allows 
for $30 million of losses carried forward at the start of the operation. An allowance for Import Duties 
has also been made in the operating cost schedule of 7.5% on 50% of the operating costs for 
mining, processing and G&A.  Allowance has been made in the capital costs for Import Duties at 
the rate of 2.5% on an amount of $180 million, representing an approximate value of the goods and 
services to be imported.

1.12 Project Execution  

The cost estimates have been complied on the basis that Endeavour will adopt an EPCM 
approach, with engineering commencing after the Board has given approval to the Project, and the 
necessary permits are in place. 

The overall duration of the project from Board Approval to first gold is estimated to be 21 months.  
The critical path runs from the award of the EPCM contract through the process and detailed 
design to mill building structural steel supply, erection of the milling building and installation of the 
equipment before final completion of the piping and electrical activities to allow commissioning to 
proceed.  The schedule is based on purchase orders for the SAG ball and UFG mills being placed 
immediately the project is approved. 

1.13 Environmental  

1.13.1 Baseline Conditions 

As part of this study, two ESIA studies and a RAP (Resettlement Action Plan) study were carried 
out by Genivar Inc., INGRID and SOCREGE under Endeavour's supervision.  Baseline studies 
carried out over a period of nine months showed: 

� The biological environment lacked flora and fauna diversity. 

� The human environment was dominated by traditional community structures and a low 
level of development based on a cash crop and subsistence economy.   

� The ambient air quality contained high background levels of dust and the noise 
environment close to the highway had noise levels close to existing IFC limits. 

� Water sampling showed on average the water quality is slightly acidic and pH of water at 
individual sites may be lower than the low limit in the WHO standards.  Many of the 
surface water and well sites exceeded turbidity limits and a few sites had iron, chromium 
and manganese levels in excess of the WHO standard. 

Key environmental issues identified include: 

� Water supply for the mine;  

� TSF location and post-closure land use;  

� Transport and management of hazardous materials; 

� Proximity of infrastructure (road, power line and optic fibre cable); 

� Potential for in-migration and its effect on level of service in public infrastructure; 

� Allowance for traditional grazing patterns; and 

� Resettlement and reallocation of land.

1.13.2 Permitting Requirements 

The key environmental permit required by the project is the environmental certificates from the 
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MEED) which will follow submission of the 
EIA and RAP.  A number of secondary approvals may also be needed in relation to specific 
elements of the project, such as licences for dams, transport and storage of dangerous goods, 
highway intersection works, etc.  These activities are likely to take 12 to 14 months: 

Submission of the ESIA reports (Phase 2), public hearings and updates: complete by end April 
2014. 

Industrial Operating Permit application: estimated reception by end August 2014. 

Operations Approval, signed Mining Permit: estimated reception 1 December 2014. 

1.13.3 Social and Community Impact 

Endeavour, through its subsidiary Avion Gold, has put in place a mechanism for gathering 
information and consulting the communities throughout this process, including a Stakeholder 
Engagement Plan (PEPP) and development of various information tools.  Items of concern raised 
during community contacts related mainly to: 

� Employment opportunities and possible influx from outside the area. 

� Resettlement actions and future standard of living. 

� Effect of the project on water and other local infrastructure. 

� Possible health impacts and negative impacts on local moral standards and security. 

� Impact of the project on current artisanal gold mining activities. 

The project will also have positive impacts,

� Wages and salaries paid and spent in the region and services procured from local 
businesses. 

� Training and skills development. 

� Compensation payments for land. 

� Taxes, Royalties and levies paid to the state of Burkina Faso of approximately 
$330 million over the project's life.

1.13.4 Land Acquisition 

The mine will need to acquire 2.096 ha for the open pit, processing plant, waste piles, TSF, water 
harvest dam and water storage dam, as well as the necessary roads.  As well, a 250 metre wide 
health perimeter has been delineated around the existing infrastructure for optional compensation 
and relocation.  A further compensation perimeter, designated as a mitigated 50 dB(A) nighttime 
sound perimeter has also been delineated to provide a mechanism for those impacted by the mine 
noise the option of being compensated and moved to another location further from the mine. 

Fair baseline compensation was determined from a detailed local study by SOCREGE under the 
supervision of Genivar and Endeavour.  The process of determining the appropriate level of 
compensation is still proceeding with estimates ranging from $6.2 million to $15.8 million. For the 
purpose of this study, an overall compensation level of $12.0 million was allowed. 

1.13.5 Closure Costs 

The estimate cost of closure is US$26,384,000.  This cost is based on a combination of resale, 
reuse, recovery and rehabilitation options for the facilities.  The biggest single cost will be the cost 
of closure of the tailings storage facilities which require covering with a layer of fresh waste rock 
before adding a low permeability layer and topsoil for revegetation.  Mine waste dumps will be 
battered down and covered with topsoil.  Infrastructure items of use such as dams, roads, office 
buildings, accommodation camp, etc, will be donated to the community, while the process plant will 
be demolished and the area rehabilitated. 

The closure costs will be covered by a rehabilitation fund which is required to be set up upon 
opening of the mine.  Contributions to the fund will match total material movement in the mine with 
$0.10 /tonne mined added to the fund annually, giving a closing balance will be $23.3 million, which 
will be topped up to $26.4 million (including contingency) at closure.  This cost does not include 
provision for ongoing monitoring that may be required after closure and rehabilitation works have 
been completed.  It is expected these could require ongoing monitoring of US$175,000/y, if 
required by the regulatory authorities prior to acceptance of relinquishment. 

1.14 Economic Analysis 

A simple cash flow model was prepared, based on the mine schedule and cost estimates.  The 
results of the model are summarised in Table 1.14.1 and Table 1.14.2.  At a gold price of 
$1,300 per ounce and full equity funding, the Project is estimated to have an after-tax IRR of 22.4% 
and a pay-back period of 2.88 years.  At a discount rate of 5.0%, the after-tax NPV of this scenario 
is estimated at $230 million.

1.15 Recommendations and Conclusions 

1.15.1 Conclusions 

� Exploration drilling in the immediate Vindaloo and Madras NW pit areas indicates that 
there is both in-pit and near pit mineralized zones that merit follow-up in the short term, 
as their delineation could have a positive impact on the current mine and waste pile 
models. 

� Exploration targets, located around the periphery of the Vindaloo and Madras NW pits, 
have the potential to add additional mineable resources. 

� The Vindaloo mineralisation is sufficiently drilled and modelled to allow classification into 
a Resource Model that has been developed using generally accepted industry techniques 
and practices and conforms to CIM guidelines (CIM 2005).  The mineral resource 
estimate is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.35 g/t Au with an effective date of July 18, 
2012.  The mine design and scheduling activities have resulted in a Reserve statement 
produced in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101, 'Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects' of June 2011 (the Instrument) and the Definition 
Standards adopted by CIM Council in November 2010. 

� The metallurgical testwork conducted on samples representing the bulk of the deposit to 
be mined has resulted in the development of a robust process flowsheet which is 
expected to recover in excess of 93% of the gold in the mill feed.  Additional testwork on 
gravity concentration would improve the confidence of the design details and recovery 
estimates for this part of the process, and further testwork to optimise cyanide 
consumption may lead to reductions in overall operating costs. 

� The preliminary design of the supporting infrastructure for the project has been carried 
out in sufficient detail to arrive at cost estimates of appropriate accuracy for study of this 
nature.  One item still under negotiation is the connection to the HV power grid; while 
SONABEL has agreed in principle to supply power to the project, the details of the 
connection have not yet been agreed. 

� Environmental studies have established the baseline conditions in the local project area 
and the efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of developing, operating and closure 
of a mine. 

� A social impact assessment study has identified a number of areas of concern raised by 
the local community and identified appropriate mitigating actions.  Overall, this study has 
demonstrated the economic and social benefits of the project for the area and the 
Country.  A compensation and relocation plan has been developed for those that will be 
impacted by the Project. 

� Based on the current reserves, production schedule, the metallurgical performance of the 
ore, the cost estimates, and other relevant criteria and parameters, the cash flow model 
indicates a robust project with an acceptable rate of return, even at current depressed 
gold prices.

1.15.2 Recommendation 

Given the favourable economics of the project, it is recommended that Endeavour proceed with 
development of the project. 

An exploration plan should be developed that matches the mine development schedule to ensure 
that any mineralized zones, that could positively impact the mine plan, are delineated in sufficient 
time to allow for the development of an updated mine plans.

4.3 Mineral Tenure 

According to the Mining Act of Burkina Faso, exploration licenses are granted for a period of three 
years by the Minister of Mines, Quarries, and Energy.  The Minister has the right to renew these 
licenses twice, for a period of three years per renewal.  For each renewal, the size of each license 
will be generally reduced by 25%. 

The exploration licenses are held by Avion Gold (Burkina Faso) SARL, ("Avion Burkina"), a 
company incorporated in Burkina Faso on January 29, 2010 and owned by Endeavour Mining 
Corporation.  In a letter from legal counsel, Kere Avocats dated August 13, 2012 re: "Title Opinion 
on the Exploration Permits and related rights held by Avion Burkina, in Burkina Faso", the opinion 
was given that all exploration permits and related rights were indeed held by Avion Burkina and 
were in good standing (Table 4.3.1).  All new concession grants are pending since December, 
2011, until the Government of Burkina Faso deals with outstanding concession applications; this 
includes all applied for areas indicated in Table 4.3.1.  Endeavour has applied for 3 year special 
renewals for the concessions expiring in 2013; based on past precedents, Endeavour expects that 
the Bouhaoun, Kopoi and Wakui concessions will be renewed for an additional 3 years.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, is connected to Europe with daily flights by Air 
France and twice weekly by Air Burkina to Paris, three times per week to Brussels by Brussels 
Airlines.  To East Africa it is connected twice weekly by Kenya Airways to Nairobi and to Addis 
Ababa by Ethiopian Airways.  There are also frequent flights within the West African region to Mali, 
Accra, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Niger.   

The Houndé permits are located in the south-western part of Burkina Faso, West Africa centred 
over the city of Houndé.  The Property area is accessible from Ouagadougou via paved Route 
National 1 (N1), for around 260 km.  Driving the distance between Ouagadougou and the site takes 
approximately three hours. 

Alternatively, access to the Property can be gained from Burkina Faso's second largest city of 
Bobo-Dioulasso near the border with Mali.  The Property can be accessed by driving on Route 
National 1 (N1) towards Ouagadougou for 90 km.  Access to the various parts of the permit from 
the paved road is provided by a network of roads and trails that were locally upgraded or built by 
Endeavour. 

5.2 Climate 

The Houndé permit area lies in the savannah of the Sudanese climatic zone characterized by 
increased influence of the West African monsoon relative to the Sahelian Zone to the North of 
Burkina Faso. 

The weather station of Bobo-Dioulasso, 90 km to the west, has recorded an average temperature 
of 27°C over a period of 22 years, with a maximum of 43°C reached in April and a minimum of 9°C 
in December.   

A rainy season lasting from June to October is followed by a dry season for the rest of the year. 
Monthly and daily historic hydrologic data for two climate stations in the vicinity of the project were 
used to derive baseline design climatology.  These stations are: 

� Houndé climate station, located 6.3 km north of the project site and 

� Boromo climate station, located 74.7 km northeast of the project site. 

The monthly precipitation values for average, 1 in 100 year dry and 1 in 100 year wet conditions 
and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data derived for use in calculations for the project are 
summarised in Table 5.2.1.

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure  

The Route National 1 (N1) passes through the centre of the Houndé license area.  The N1 is the 
country's major paved highway linking the capital with the second largest city.  It is also part of the 
main international highway in the Sahel region linking Dakar (Senegal) with Niamey (Niger) passing 
through Mali and Burkina Faso.

The paved highway from the region's main port Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire) joins the Trans-Sahel road 
at Bobo-Dioulasso, which is located approximately 100 km southwest of the project area.  The 
paved highway to the Ghanaian border and onwards to Accra and the Takoradi port is currently 
being upgraded. 

The national electric grid's main power line runs parallel to the main highway and passes through 
the property.  Burkina Faso's power generation capacity is being upgraded with the installation of 
new power stations and feed in from new power stations in Ghana.  Access to this grid is currently 
being negotiated with the authorities to provide a convenient source of power for the project. 

A railroad, which passes through the western side of the property, coming within 25 km of the 
proposed mill site, has a 400 m long siding (at the town of Béréba) and has been used to offload 
fuel and supplies.  With a minimal of upgrading, this siding could be used to bring in fuel and 
construction and mining supplies.  Endeavour has received preliminary pricing for rail freight for 
unloading at both Bobo Dioulasso and Béréba. 

An abundance of unskilled local workforce is available.  Skilled workers, and general services and 
equipment can be found in Bobo-Dioulasso or in the capital city, Ouagadougou. 

5.4 Physiography, Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The project area lies approximately 320 m above sea level and is characterized by gently rolling to 
flat topography with occasional round to steep laterite ridges to 20 metres high that are bisected 
with shallow northeast- to east-trending seasonal streams.  A thin cover of soil, over laterite, covers 
most areas, with alluvium cover proximal to streams and drainages.  Basement volcanic rocks and 
sediments outcrop locally with the most prominent being a large northeast-trending ridge of 
metavolcanic rock located approximately 5 km west of the deposit area.  A typical dry season view 
of the area is presented in Figure 5.4.1.  Trees and brushes are spaced from 1 to 100 metres apart 
with higher densities in drainage areas.  During the wet season, grass covers the non-farm area 
and is often burned off after the dry season.

Small farm plots are common in the deposit area with a combination of cereal crops (corn, peanuts 
and millet) and cotton grown.  Figure 5.4.2 shows a typical cotton field over the deposit area.  Local 
orchards (mangoes, oranges and bananas) are located near drainages where there is a more 
consistent water supply.

5.5 Water 

The project site is near the top of a watershed and hence there are no large permanent rivers in the 
vicinity.  The nearest large surface body of water is the barrage at Pa, approximately 35 km to the 
northeast of the project site or the Bougiriba River about 40 km to the south of the project.  With the 
short wet season and long dry season, surface water sources are intermittent; coupled with the flat 
topography, surface water storages are relatively inefficient, requiring a large area to store 
appreciable volumes.  The high evaporation rates then cause appreciable water loss from such 
storages.  A stream passing through the north east of the project area has the capacity to provide 
the bulk of the project's water requirements, but suitable storage facilities are needed to ensure this 
water is used efficiently. 

A barrage similar to that proposed for the project serves the local Houndé town; a photo of the 
resource taken in March 2013 (near the end of the dry season) (Figure 5.5.1) indicates that water 
can be stored successfully in the area.

To the southeast of the mining area is a small formation of low hills which provides a convenient 
location for the construction of a more efficient water storage facility, although the catchment is too 
small to provide sufficient water.  The project will therefore construct a water harvest barrage on 
the larger stream passing through the north east of the project area and water captured there will 
be pumped to the more efficient water storage barrage, from which the processing plant will draw 
water. 

A hydrogeotechnical investigation was conducted at the project site in order to estimate open pit 
dewatering requirements and to identify potential sources of groundwater.  The investigation 
concluded that the geology is "tight" and that groundwater sources will not supply appreciable 
volumes of water (see Section 18). 

5.6 Waste Disposal Sites 

5.6.1 Waste Rock 

The mine design indicates that with a strip ratio close to 8.5, a total of approximately 210 Mt of 
waste rock will be produced from the open pits.  The mineralisation of the project area comprises a 
series of SW – NE trending zones of which the Vindaloo is the main zone proposed to be mined.  
Waste rock dumps will be positioned to avoid the other mineralised zones identified on the site 
where practical, while keeping haul distances and costs to a minimum. 

5.6.2 Tailings 

Approximately 4 km to the north west of the process plant, a number of low hills provide a 
convenient location for a tailings storage facility capable of storing the approximately 25 Mt of 
tailings to be produced over the life of the mine, with potential to expand to a total capacity of 
50 Mt.  The topography will allow four small embankments constructed from local materials to 
contain the tailings in a footprint area of about 200 ha as shown in Drawing 100-G-001 in 
Appendix 18.1.  See also Figure 5.6.1 and Figure 5.6.2.

Another location considered as a potential site for the tailings storage facility was the area to the 
south east of the project area now proposed as the location for the water storage barrage.  While 
this area could also have accommodated the tailings, the presence of some mineralisation in the 
vicinity mitigated against this site being used to store a large mass of tailings.

5.7 Process Plant Site 

The national highway, the 225 kV grid power line and the Vindaloo deposit mineralisation all tend to 
run parallel to one another in a SW – NE direction.  A convenient location for the process plant 
exists between the power line and the open pit approximately halfway along the planned pit 
development, representing near-optimum haul distances for ore and easy access to the project 
infrastructure. 

5.8 Flora and Fauna  

Parkland and farm land occupies 85% of the zone's total surface area.  Wooded savannah 
occupies 2% of the area. Shrub savannah represents 13%.  

The geomorphology of the sites is characterized by plateaus (87%), upper slopes (6%) and 
lowlands (7%).  The types of soil encountered are the gravelly (34%), clayey (60%) and 
hydromorphic (6%) types. 

The forest inventory identified 68 species representing 24 families.  The density of measurable 
trees (C1.30 �10cm) is 7 trees per hectare.  The total number of trees is approximately 20,300. 
Density is relatively low due to the strong human presence and artisanal gold mining.  For natural 
regeneration, density is 22 trees per hectare, i.e. about 63,778 trees. 

Despite the rules of direct and indirect protection, wildlife habitat is severely degraded and no 
mammals have been observed.  

The avifauna species found are present in types of preferential habitats: agricultural areas, relics of 
savannah shrub lands, hills and wetlands.  

Fish fauna is limited by the ephemeral nature of the streams and local ponds in the project area.  
However, it is expected that fish species will increase with the emplacement of the water dam and 
water storage dam.  

Bees are common during certain times of the year and caution must be taken to not disturb the 
nests as the bees can be quite aggressive.  The bee species that is colonizing natural habitats or 
hives in Burkina Faso is Apis milifica adansonii a subspecies found in West Africa. 

Two major groups of herpetological species have been identified including Colubridae and 
Viperidae.  A survey of the area also reveals the presence of the spitting snake (Naja nigricollis).

6.0 HISTORY 

Mineral exploration in the Houndé area began in the 1990's.  Previously, the Bureau de 
Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) and Bureau de Mines et de la Géologie du Burkina 
Faso (BUMIGEB) worked in the area intermittently from 1939 to 1982. 

6.1 Ownership History 

Following positive results from the UNDP regional geochemical surveys, Oxford Resources Inc. 
optioned the Kari Nord permit in 1998 and began an exploration program which, from 1998 to 
2000, gained financial support from Avgold Ltd. of South Africa.  Their program consisted of 
regional soil sampling (1,000 m by 250 m) and geophysical interpretation.  Apparently, the soil 
survey indicated low gold values in the Vindaloo and Kari areas.  A lack of funds stopped work in 
2000. 

The Kari Nord and Kari Sud permits were granted to Pyramide-M in 2004.  Barrick Africa 
Exploration Ltd. Burkina (Barrick) acquired them in 2005.  Then the permits passed into the hands 
of Goldbelt Resources West Africa SARL (Goldbelt) at the end of 2007.  The Karba permit was 
initially held by Resolute West Africa (Resolute) from 2003 to 2006.  In 2006, Goldbelt acquired the 
permit. 

Wakui, Kopoi and Bouhaoun permits were initially held by Resolute in 2004, then by Goldbelt in 
2006. 

In late 2007 Goldbelt was purchased by Wega Mining (Wega), which was in turn purchased by 
Avocet Mining (Avocet) in June 2009.  In October 2010, Avion Gold Corporation acquired Avion 
Gold (Burkina Faso) SARL, the subsidiary that was created to hold the Houndé permits (Kari Nord,

6.2 Exploration History 

Some of the first recorded work on the permits was a 1980's regional scale UNDP soil survey 
where 28,300 samples were collected from a grid with spacings of 500 metres to 1,000 metres by 
300 metres.  These samples indicated several areas of gold enrichment in soil on the Houndé 
property.  Regional magnetic surveys were also carried out over the same area by UNDP at the 
same time.  Since the magnetic data indicated that the regional geology appeared to follow the 
trend of the artisanal workings the UNDP decided to carry out additional exploration in the Kari 
Nord permit area and specifically in the Kari Zone.  Their initial follow-up work consisted of a soil 
grid with lines every 100 to 200 metres with samples collected every 50 metre along with 
lithogeochemical and geophysical surveys (magnetic and Max-min electromagnetic) and geological 
mapping.  From this first pass, in 1997 the UNDP decided to drill 23 reverse circulation holes 
followed by twelve diamond drill holes in the Kari area.  Five of these holes were reported to 
contain significant amounts of gold both visually and by assay.   

From 2005 - 2007, Barrick conducted regional soil surveys (collecting a total of 912 samples), 
carried out geological mapping, completed 8,263 m of CBI drilling (cover-bedrock interface) in 
544 holes, 9,264 m of RAB drilling in 279 holes, 70 m of RC drilling in one hole and 4 hole core 
holes totalling 625 metres on the Kari Nord permit.  The core holes tested the centre of the 
Vindaloo Main zone with one of the holes returning 4.45 g/t Au over 34.0 m. After optioning the 
property from Barrick, Goldbelt in 2007 - 2009, conducted a detailed soil survey collecting 4,476 
samples, carried out 1,344 m of RAB drilling in 92 holes, 9,483 m of RC drilling in 98 holes and 885 
m of core drilling in 6 holes.  In addition, they conducted a gradient IP survey at Vindaloo and Kari 
Pump for a total of 13.4 km².  The best hole from this program returned 8.90 g/t Au over 29.0 m on 
section 49650N from the Vindaloo zone.  Note that all Barrick and Goldbelt holes in the Vindaloo 
and Madras areas are part of the drill hole database that was evaluated and incorporated into the 
current Mineral Resource estimate. 

From 2005 - 2007, Barrick conducted a regional soil survey collecting 949 samples, performed 
geological mapping, carried out 2,108 m of CBI drilling (cover-bedrock interface) in 153 holes and 
4,656 m of RC drilling in 129 holes on the Kari Sud permit.  Following up on this work, in 2007 - 
2009, Goldbelt conducted detailed soil surveys collecting 382 samples and carried out 4,700 m of 
RAB drilling in 94 holes.  The best hole from these two programs returned 3.47 g/t Au over 18.0 m 
from an area referred to as Vindaloo SE located approximately 4.4 km southeast of the Vindaloo 
Main zone.  An evaluation of this area is still required. 

The Karba permit was held by Resolute from 2003 – 2006.  Resolute carried out 6,047 m of RC 
drilling in 130 holes.  Interesting intercepts were returned from the Grand Espoir Zone: 2.65 g/t Au 
over 12.0 metres and the east end of the Kari area, 31.92 g/t Au over 3.0 metres. Goldbelt acquired 
the permit in 2006 and from 2006 to 2009, conducted regional and semi-detailed soil surveys 
collecting a total of 10,904 samples.

The Wakui permit was initially held by Resolute who conducted a regional soil survey collecting 
3,718 samples in 2004 to 2005. From 2006 to 2007, Goldbelt conducted regional and semi-detailed 
soil surveys collecting a total of 2,996 samples.  Subsequently they carried out 8,875 m of rotary 
airblast (RAB) drilling in 264 holes.  Several holes drilled near the southern boundary of the 
concession in the Grand Espoir showing area returned anomalous results with hole WKRA009 
returning the best intercepts of 2.26 g/t Au over 12.0 metres and 2.22 g/t Au over 8.0 metres.  More 
work is required in this area. 

Resolute conducted regional soil surveys on the Kopoi permit, collecting 3,599 samples during the 
period from 2004 to 2006.  Kopoi was next held by Goldbelt from 2006 to 2007.  During this period 
they conducted a regional soil survey collecting a total of 2,658 samples and carried out 3,850 m of 
RAB drilling in 77 holes. 

The Bouhaoun permit was initially held by Resolute, who collected 3,270 regional scale soil 
samples, from 2004 to 2005.  From 2006 – 2007, Goldbelt conducted regional and semi-detailed 
soil surveys collecting a total of 2,956 samples and carried out 4,988 m of RAB drilling in 
215 holes. 

After Avocet acquired the Houndé property in 2009, through its purchase of Wega, it completed 
24 RC drill holes totaling 2,395 metres, carried out surface mapping and collected 243 rock 
samples and 49 soil samples.  Avocet's work focused on the western and northern parts of the 
property where assessment work was required.  Drilling at the Douhoun occurrence returned a best 
intercept of 5.69 g/t Au over 14.0 metres core length at a vertical depth of 63.0 metres.  This drill 
program also resulted in the discovery of the Kopoi occurrence where drilling return 3.43 g/t Au 
over 4.0 metres. 

Avion commenced work over the Houndé property in early 2010, prior to the completion of the deal 
to acquire the Property.  Initial work comprised a detailed airborne magnetic and radiometric 
survey, prospect review, soil sampling (2,808 samples collected on the Bouhaoun permit), chip and 
core re-logging and the completion of 34 drill holes totalling 5,515 metres mainly over the Vindaloo, 
Bouéré and Dohoun prospects.  Upon completion of the drilling, Avion announced the first Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Vindaloo zone in late October 2010.  

In 2011, Avion continued with the exploration program with 584 line km of IP gradient surveys over 
the Grand Espoir, Bouéré, Kari and Vindaloo areas, the collection of 324 soil samples over the 
Bouere and Vindaloo areas and the completion of 182 holes totalling 35,033 metres over the 
Vindaloo, Kari and Bouéré areas.  Upon completion of this program, an updated Mineral Resource 
estimate was completed for the Vindaloo area.  Anomalous drill results were returned from the 
Grand Espoir, Bouéré and Kari areas with holes returning best intercepts of 0.55 g/t Au over 34.0 
metres, 24.18 g/t Au over 17.8 metres and 7.80 over 3.4 metres, respectively, at these zones; 
additional work is warranted over these areas. 

In the first half of 2012, Avion continued the drill and geophysical program over the Vindaloo area 
completing 151 holes totalling 23,707 metres, 211 km of IP gradient surveys and initiated baseline 
environmental studies.  As well, Avion commissioned an updated Mineral Resource estimate and a 
Preliminary Economic Assessment study (PEA), both of which were completed in early 2013.

Immediately upon Endeavour acquiring Avion in late October 2012, drilling resumed over the 
Vindaloo zone with a goal to convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources 
and some of the Indicated Mineral Resources to Measured Mineral Resources.  This program 
consisted of 369 holes totalling 41,365 metres.  In conjunction with this drill program base line 
environmental monitoring commenced and additional community consultations were carried out.  
Once the results of the PEA indicated a positive financial return, 22 composite core samples were 
collected for metallurgical studies with SGS Laboratories in Perth, a thin section report was 
prepared and feasibility level engineering studies were contracted.  ESIA and RAP (Resettlement 
Action Plan) studies commenced in April, 2013 with the selection of consulting firms, and delivery 
of the Terms of Reference (TOR) to the government. 

6.3 Resource History 

Three previous resource estimates were calculated for the Vindaloo zone on the Houndé Property 
reflecting drill programs in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012.  In each case, the overall resources 
increased each year. 

6.3.1 2010 Resource Estimate 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. (P&E) completed the initial resource estimate carried out on the 
Houndé Property.  Highlights of the Vindaloo initial resource estimate, at a 1.0 g/t Au cut-off grade, 
defined within an optimized pit shell as a constraint, are as follows: 

� 883,000 tonnes Indicated Mineral Resources at 2.23 g/t Au totaling 63,000 Ounces 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7

� 5,725,000 tonnes Inferred Mineral Resources at 2.97 g/t Au totaling 547,000 Ounces 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7

1. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, 
title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues and are subject to the findings of a 
feasibility study. 

2. The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and 
there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an Indicated or 
Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to 
an indicated or measured Mineral Resource category.

3. The Vindaloo Zone Resource Estimates were prepared by Eugene Puritch, P. Eng. and Antoine 
Yassa, P. Geo. from P&E Mining Consultants Inc., Qualified Persons under NI 43-101 who are 
independent of the Company. 

4. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves, Prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions, Adopted 
by CIM Council on November 27, 2010. 

5. The gold price used in this estimate was the June 30, 2010 two year trailing average of US$1,027/oz. 
Au recovery was 92% and mining costs were US$2.75/tonne of ore and US$1.50/tonne of waste. 
Processing and G&A costs combined were US$30/tonne.  Pit optimization slopes were 50 degrees.  

6. Effective date of June 30, 2010. 

7. This resource is no longer current as it has been superseded by the resource estimate used in this 
feasibility study.

6.3.2 2011 Resource Estimate 

P&E completed an updated resource estimate based on the additional drilling carried out in 2011.  
The 2011 Mineral Resource estimate within an open pit constraint at Vindaloo showed: 

� Indicated Mineral Resources of 13.41 million tonnes at 2.07 g/t Au for a total of 
893,000 ounces of gold at a 0.5 g/t Au cut-off 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

� Inferred Mineral Resources of 10.71 million tonnes at 2.07 g/t Au for a total of 
712,000 ounces of gold of gold at a 0.5 g/t Au cut-off 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

This Mineral Resource estimate for the Vindaloo zone represented a 1,400% increase in Indicated 
Mineral Resources from 883,000 tonnes Indicated Mineral Resources at 2.23 g/t Au totalling 
63,000 ounces of gold (Avion news release October 25, 2010) to 13.41 million tonnes at 2.07 g/t 
Au for a total of 893,000 ounces of gold.   

In addition, there was also a 30% increase in Inferred Mineral Resource from 5.73 million tonnes 
Inferred Mineral Resources at 2.97 g/t Au totalling 547,000 ounces of gold to 10.71 million tonnes 
at 2.07 g/t Au for a total of 712,000 ounces of gold. 

1. Resource estimates based on a gold price of US$1,350 per ounce, a 90% process recovery, mining costs 
of US$1.50/ tonne, process costs of US$15/tonne and General and Administrative costs of 
US$4.00/tonne were used to determine the 0.5 g/t Open Pit cut-off grade. 

2. Gold grades were estimated in a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m block model from capped 1.5 m composites utilizing 
inverse distance cubed interpolation.  Composites were capped up to 30 g/t depending on the individual 
mineralized domain. 

3. Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. from P&E Mining Consultants Inc., Qualified Persons 
under NI 43-101 who are independent of the Company, are responsible for these Mineral Resource 
estimates.

4. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The 
estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

5. The quantity and grade of reported inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature 
and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred Mineral Resources as Indicated or 
Measured Mineral Resources and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to 
Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource categories. 

6. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves, Prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions, Adopted by CIM 
Council on November 27, 2010.   

7. The Mineral Resource estimate is as of the effective date of December 21, 2011. 

8. This resource is no longer current as it has been superseded by the resource estimate used in this 
feasibility study.

6.3.3 2012 Resource Estimate 

The 2012 Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng, Fred Brown, P.Geo. 
and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P&E and was reported within a PEA study report titled "Technical 
Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Houndé Gold Project, Burkina Faso, West 
Africa" prepared by SRK consulting of Vancouver, B.C., Canada. 

The 2012 resource estimate for the Vindaloo zone at the Houndé Project represented an 80.2% 
increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 23,708,000 tonnes at 1.91 g/t Au for a total of 
1,456,000 ounces of gold.  In addition, there is also a modest 18.6% increase in Inferred Mineral 
Resource to 12,210,000 tonnes at 1.91 g/t Au for a total of 752,000 ounces of gold.  

The Mineral Resource estimate in Table 6.3.1 for the Vindaloo deposits is reported at a cut-off 
grade of 0.35 g/t Au, is contained within a conceptual open pit shell and has an effective date of 
October 31, 2012.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING, MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The geology of West and Central Africa is dominated by Precambrian shields or cratons of 
Archaean and Lower Proterozoic age, Pan-African mobile zones of Upper Proterozoic age and 
intracratonic sedimentary basins ranging from the Proterozoic to the Quaternary (Figure 7.1.1). 

The Precambrian history of this part of Africa is commonly described as a process of progressive 
accretion of a series of successively younger mobile or orogenic zones or belts to the old crustal 
nuclei of early Archaean age.  Occasionally, subsequent orogenic belts develop inside existing 
cratons, but more commonly they add to the size of older cratons by the addition of new crustal 
material along their margins. 

Most of the cratonic nuclei in the area under discussion stabilized during the Archaean after the 
accretion of Archaean mobile zones subsequent to earlier orogenic events.  The North Gabon 
Archaean nucleus for example, stabilized around 2.7 Ga.  An exception is the West African craton, 
which stabilized much later at about 1.99 Ga after the accretion of vast areas of Lower Proterozoic 
(or Birimian) formations at the end of the Eburnean orogenic event.  This fact has led to much 
confusion as to the use of the word craton in regard to West Africa in recent years. 

The Man Craton is considered to be a remnant of a much larger craton that included the present 
day Guyana Craton of South America.  This former craton was split by continental breakup in the 
Jurassic and the two segments have since drifted apart. 

The Lower Archaean-Proterozoic shields consist essentially of granitic-gneissic terrains and of 
isoclinally folded volcano-sedimentary and sedimentary greenstone belts, which can be of either 
Lower Archaean or Proterozoic age.  Both ages of greenstone belts are host to significant precious 
metal, base metal, and bulk mineral deposits in Africa and worldwide.  Archaean greenstone belts 
exist within the Man Craton and host banded iron formation (BIF) deposits, Archaean mafic 
cumulate deposits and Mesozoic supergene nickel deposits and so are compositionally different 
from their later equivalents. 

The Proterozoic greenstone belts of West Africa are also known as Birimian greenstone belts, 
named after the Birim River Valley in Ghana, where both gold and diamonds occur.  They 
encompass a vast area of approximately 350,000 km² covering parts of Niger, Burkina Faso, 
Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea, Liberia, and Sénégal.  In general the Birimian 
rocks lie outside of the cratonic Archaean areas and are sometimes thought of as mobile belts.  
Birimian rocks are locally unconformably overlain by Lower Proterozoic-age Tarkwaian Group 
conglomerates and volcanic.  Tarkwaian rocks have been identified in Ghana and Burkina Faso 
and likely occur in Cote d'Ivoire as well. 

The Proterozoic Birimian greenstone rocks have undergone orogeny in Eburnean times, which 
dates roughly from 1.99–2.19 Ga.  The last orogenic event in West and Central Africa was the Pan-
African of Upper Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic age (600–450 Ma).  This event completed the 
addition of new crustal material to the older shield areas composed of Archaean cratons and 
Proterozoic mobile belts.

The Pan-African also overprinted and partially obliterated older pre-existing sequences of 
Archaean to Proterozoic age.  Pan-African mobile belts rim the western margins of the West 
African and Congo shields: Mauritanides, Rokelides, and West Congo fold belt.  The Pan-African 
belt of Central Africa, also known as the Trans-Saharan mobile belt, occupies a vast area along the 
eastern margin of the West African and the northwestern margin of the Congo Craton.  This zone, 
which is thought to have resulted from the collision between the West African Craton and an ill-
defined continent to the east, comprises the Adrar des Iforas and Aïr stockworks in Mali and Niger, 
and large parts of Benin, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon. 

The end of the Pan-African orogeny welded the various cratons and shields of all of Africa together 
to form the approximate shape of the continent of Africa.  It is unclear to what extent older 
(Archaean-Lower Proterozoic) crustal material has been preserved within the Pan-African belts, 
without having been subjected to intense metamorphic reactivation. 

Due to extensive cover by intracratonic basins and deep crustal reactivation during the Pan-African 
orogenic event, only segments of the original Archaean-Lower Proterozoic cratons are 
recognizable today in West Africa.  The principal remaining segments of the West African shield 
are the Man Craton in Guinea / Sierra Leone, Reguibate in Mauritania, Kayes Inlier in Mali, and the 
Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier in Sénégal and Mali.  The vast Man-Leo Shield terrains, which extend 
from Guinea in the west to Benin and Niger in the east, make up the balance of the West African 
Shield.

The Archaean-Lower Proterozoic shields consist essentially of granitic-gneissic terrains and of 
isoclinally folded volcano-sedimentary and sedimentary greenstone belts, which can be of either 
Archaean or Lower Proterozoic age.  Both ages of greenstone belts are host to significant precious 
metal, base metal, and bulk mineral deposits in Africa and worldwide.  Archaean greenstone belts 
exist within the Man Craton and host BIF deposits, Archaean mafic cumulate deposits and 
Mesozoic supergene nickel deposits and so are compositionally different from their later 
equivalents. 

Intracratonic sedimentary basins, which are virtually unaffected by any orogenic event, cover 
extensive parts of the region.  They range from Upper Proterozoic to Quaternary age.  Coastal 
basins of Cretaceous to Quaternary age occur along sections of the Atlantic coast.  The majority of 
known diamond productive kimberlite and related rocks in West Africa have been discovered 
primarily within the Man Craton, which underlies Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and western Côte 
d'Ivoire.  Kimberlite in these areas is either of Jurassic or Neoproterozoic age.

7.2 Local Geology 

The geology of Burkina Faso can be subdivided into three major litho-tectonic domains: (1) a 
Paleoproterozoic (Birimian) basement underlying most of the country, (2) a Neoproterozoic 
sedimentary cover developed along the western, northern, and south-eastern portions of the 
country, and (3) a Cenozoic mobile belt forming small inliers in the northwestern and extreme 
eastern regions of the country (Figure 7.2.1). 

The Birimian crust comprises the following lithologies from bottom to top: (1) a thick sequence of 
mafic rocks, including basalt, locally pillowed, as well as dolerite and gabbro, all of tholeiitic 
composition, locally inter layered with immature detrital sediments and limestone, (2) a detrital 
sedimentary pile (volcanics, turbidite, mudstone, and carbonate) including inter bedded calc-
alkaline volcanics, and (3) a coarse clastic sedimentary sequence belonging to the Tarkwaian 
Group.  During the Eburnean orogeny, the volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks were subjected to 
crustal shortening associated with greenschist facies regional metamorphism.  Locally, amphibolite 
metamorphic facies are reached, but these occurrences are interpreted as resulting from contact 
metamorphism.

The Houndé greenstone belt consists of NNE-SSW oriented volcano-sedimentary rocks that are 
roughly 330 km long by 60 km wide.  

The Houndé greenstone belt is made up of andesites, subordinate amphibolitized basalts with 
intercalations of minor acidic volcanic, gabbroic bodies, greywacke to argillaceous sediments and 
banded chert.  All these rocks are intruded by plutonic bodies consisting of granodiorite, tonalite 
and quartz diorite batholiths, then by granitic, granodioritic and tonalitic stocks and some small 
leucogranite intrusions.  

The above assemblage is unconformably overlain by Tarkwaian Group pebbly sandstone which 
lies in thrust contact with the Birimian rocks along the eastern side of the belt of the property. 

Many late, magnetic, dolerite dykes intrude the greenstone belt at different trends with northwest-
trending dykes most common.  Other dyke trends observed are east-southeast- and northeast-
trending.  

One prominent northeast-trending dolerite dyke divides the geology of Hounde into two major litho-
tectonic domains that are evident on the airborne geophysics: (1) northwest of the dike, units trend 
northeast; and (2) southeast of the dike, units trend north to northeast.  This major dyke appears to 
occupy a northeast-trending ductile shear zone. 

7.3 Deposit Scale Geology 

Rocks in the immediate Vindaloo and Madras NW zones comprise north- to northeast- trending 
greenschist-metamorphosed intermediate volcanics and sediment that are intruded by later gabbro 
sills and dykes (Figure 7.3.1).  The intermediate composition units comprise, in order of 
abundance, coarse polymictic andesitic debris flows (Figure 7.3.1), ash to lapilli tuffs and massive 
flows.  The sediments are well banded and comprise greywacke with subordinate sheared graphic 
argillite sections (Figure 7.3.2).  Banded chert / siliceous horizons and massive pyrolusite rock lie 
near the eastern edge of the Koho zone, which is approximately 300 metres to the east of the 
Vindaloo zone.  These rocks are conformably intruded by locally to pervasively altered gabbro 
(Figure 7.3.3).  Gabbro sills are preferentially hosted by the coarse andesitic units and along the 
contact between the sediment and volcanic units.

Figure 7.3.4 Propylitically Altered Gabbro 

The Vindaloo zones are hosted by intensely sericite- and silica-altered mafic intrusions and 
similarly-altered, strongly foliated and altered intermediate to mafic volcaniclastics and occasionally 
sediments.  The mineralization is often quartz stockwork-style and is weakly to moderately pyritic.  
The Vindaloo trend has been drill tested for a distance of approximately 7.7 kilometres along strike 
and up to 350 metres depth.  The intrusion-hosted zones range up to 70 metres in true thickness 
and average close to 20 metres true thickness along a 1.2 km section of the zone called Vindaloo 
Main.  Volcanic- and sediment-hosted zones are generally less than 5 m wide.  The entire 
mineralized package strikes north-northeast and dips steeply to the west to vertical.  The 
mineralization remains open both along strike and to depth..  

The Vindaloo deposit open pit resources comprise a group of closely-spaced gold-mineralized 
structures that currently represent an approximate 4.8 km section of the Vindaloo Zone and a 0.9 
km long section of the Madras NW zone.  A simplified section of the Vindaloo deposit is presented 
in Figure 7.3.5.

7.4 Structure 

In the property area, the Houndé volcanic belt is bound to the east and west by thrust faults.  The 
thrust faults form clear magnetic discontinuities with a northeast-trending thrust contact along the 
western edge and a north-trending thrust contact along the eastern edge of the belt. 

A strong, northeast-trending, dextral shear zone cuts through the centre of the property.  This shear 
zone, which lies approximately 3 km west of the Vindaloo zone, has a very sharp western edge, as 
defined by the magnetic data.  The eastern edge of the structure is not well defined; however, 
magnetic data suggests that the shear zone may be 4 to 6 kilometers wide.  To the east of this 
strong structure, shearing is focused along unit contacts with preference along the sediment-
volcanic, volcanic-gabbro and sediment-gabbro contacts.  Sediment units are often strongly 
deformed and display local graphitic shear zones, gouge and healed breccias. 

Rocks in the deposit area generally dip steeply west and occasionally steeply to the east.  There is 
also a suggestion that local z-folds create shallow to flat dipping sections.  Plunge directions are 
not clear, however, the mineralization appears to plunge both shallowly to the south and steeply to 
the northeast. 

Gabbro units appear to be boudined both along strike and to depth.  The gold zones usually 
weaken or die out where the gabbro is absent. 

7.5 Mineralization and Alteration 

The Vindaloo and Madras zones are predominantly hosted by altered magnetite-bearing gabbro 
and to a lesser extent andesitic volcanic rocks and sediments.  The gabbro-hosted zones range up 
to 70 metres in true thickness and average close to 20 metres true thickness in a section of the 
zone called Vindaloo Main.  Volcanic- and sediment-hosted zones are generally less than 5 m 
wide.

The mineralized system is zoned with initial propylitic-style alteration along the outer edges of the 
system with the addition of chlorite and calcite stringers concurrent with the destruction of 
pyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase.  In a poorly defined area, located to the west of the Vindaloo 
Main zone, the propyltic alteration is overprinted by a reddish hematitic alteration comprising 
disseminated hematite and hematite veinlets.  As the mineralized zones are approached propylitic 
alteration gives way to increasingly intense, yellowish-colored, sericite-epidote-ankerite+-fucshite 
alteration of the fragmental andesites (Figure 7.5.1).  In the strongly altered sections, especially 
near the gabbro contacts, the fragments are flattened with stretching ratios to 20:1.  Occasional 
quartz-veined zones, with associated trace to 5% finely disseminated to locally crystalline pyrite, 
occurs in the altered andesites, especially in the hanging wall to the Vindaloo Main zone and in 
areas along strike of the gabbro-hosted zones where the gabbro is absent.  These quartz veins are 
generally oriented parallel to foliation and shearing.

Figure 7.5.1 Sericite-, Epidote-, Carbonate-, Fuschite-Altered Intermediate Fragmental 

The gabbro units display a similar alteration pattern as the andesite units with widespread propyltic 
alteration of ferro-magnesium minerals to complete destruction of the ferro-magnesium minerals at 
the expense of a medium grey mixture of sericite, ankeritic carbonate and quartz.  Locally the 
sericite-carbonate alteration gives way to stockwork-type quartz veining with local silica-enriched 
rims (Figure 7.5.2) to the quartz veins and selective silica replacement of feldspar grains, with a 
focus near unit contacts.  At least three directions of quartz veins have been noted (Figure 7.5.3).  
Fine grained to mm-size pyrite crystals are associated with; trace to 10%, up to 2 cm wide, quartz 
veins (trace to 2% overall in mineralized zones); pyrite-enriched haloes to the quartz veins and; 
occasionally as disseminations within the host gabbro.  Locally fine pyrite crystals are aligned to 
form poorly defined veinlets.  Generally, disseminated sulphide mineralization, returns low gold 
grades; however, in the Vindaloo NE area, good gold grades are associated with both pyritic quartz 
veined areas and in areas with disseminated pyrite.

Trace amounts to 1% arsenopyrite occurs as finely disseminated grains in some of the well 
mineralized areas.  As well, trace amounts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite and rare native gold, 
tetrahedrite, electrum, Altaite (PbTe), galena and scheelite were observed.  Native gold and 
electrum occurs along grain boundaries and locally within pyrite grains (Figure 7.5.3). 

Figure 7.5.3 Pyrite Crystal with Fine Gold Grain Inclusion (Kjarsgaard, 2013) 

Mineralogy has been defined both from observations during core logging and three sets of thin 
section evaluations.  Thin section reports were prepared by Lester, 2010 (10 thin sections), 
Sawadogo, 2011 (34 thin sections),and Kjarsgaard, 2013 (25 thin sections).  An excerpt from 
Kjarsgaard's report is included below:

"The protolith was probably a leucocratic hypabyssal monzonite to monzodiorite with abundant 
euhedral to subhedral tabular plagioclase, lesser amounts of perthitic alkalifeldspar and minor to 
very little primary quartz and no trace of primary MgFe-silicates.  [Kjarsgaard was provided with 
strongly altered gabbro and intermediate volcanic samples where the primary mineralogy was 
partially to totally altered.]  Primary Ti-magnetite has been completely altered and only the 
octahedral exsolution lamellae remain as deformed lattices or fuzzy aggregates, now replaced by 
rutile.  The original plagioclase feldspar and probably also the fine-grained interstitial matrix have 
been replaced by albite and variably sericitized to the extent that in some samples only 
pseudomorphs remain.  The entire assemblage has also been extensively overprinted by fine-
grained euhedral to anhedral poikilitic carbonate (mostly ankerite with an earlier low Fe-ankerite 
overgrown by later very Fe-rich ankerite).  Only in the last five samples (no. 34 to 39) does green 
Fe-rich chlorite become a major component of the alteration assemblage probably indicating more 
mafic protoliths.  Late veins of coarse albite and carbonate ± quartz are common and cross-cut 
earlier, thinner and more diffuse veinlets of quartz-carbonate-plagioclase or carbonate-sericite.  
Mineralization occurs in the form of very fine-grained euhedral to subhedral pyrite that is either 
disseminated or follows earlier quartz-carbonate ± sericite vein systems.  Trace chalcopyrite occurs 
together with pyrite in most samples and in a few is accompanied by very fine-grained gold, 
tetrahedrite and/or sphalerite.  Gold and tetrahedrite occur interstitial to and as inclusions in pyrite.  
Scheelite was found in a carbonate vein in sample no. 33." Kjarsgaard, 2013.

Lester (2010) suggested two stages of mineralization as indicated below (Figure 7.5.4).  Note that 
Lester's paragenetic table was edited to reflect subsequent mineralogical observations.  Kjarsgaard 
(2013) suggests that the bulk of the pyrite was emplaced early in the development of the system 
and field observation suggest that magnetite was primary and destroyed / replaced during the 
mineralization event.

7.6 Veining 

Quartz+-albite+-carbonate+-pyrite veins, associated with the Vindaloo and Madras zones, range 
from 0.5 to 2 cm thick with the rare vein to a metre wide.  During the period from 2011 to 2013 
oriented core quartz vein data and other structural data was collected to support interpretation of 
the geology and mineralized zones.  This data indicates that there are three main vein trends in the 
Vindaloo Main zone area, in order of importance, trending at 030 to 045 degrees, 060 to 
070 degrees and 130 to 149 degrees (Figures 7.6.1 to 7.6.3).  Veins that trend these three 
dominant  directions vary significantly in dip, supporting the interpretation that most of the veining is 
stockwork-type in character.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Introduction 

The West African Lower Proterozoic greenstone belts have produced world-class gold deposits, 
such as the Obuasi mines of Anglo-Ashanti Corp. in Ghana that have been in continuous 
production since 1897. 

The gold deposits in West Africa have been classified into the following types:  

1. Structurally-controlled, epigenetic lode or stockwork mineralization related to major shear 
zones with native gold (Poura, Burkina Faso; Kalana, Mali),  

2. Structurally-controlled, epigenetic lode or stockwork mineralization related to major shear 
zones and characterized by the inclusion of gold in the crystal structure of the sulphides, 
often locked in arsenopyrite (Ashanti type: Obuasi, Ghana), 

3. Stratiform deposits hosted in tourmalinized turbidites (Gara Deposit Loulo, Mali),  

4. Disseminated sulphides hosted in volcanic or plutonic rocks (Syama, Mali; Yaouré, Ivory 
Coast; granitoid-hosted, Ayanfuri, Ghana),  

5. Paleo-placer deposits: auriferous quartz-pebble conglomerates (Tarkwa, Ghana); modern 
placers (eluvial, alluvial). 

The classic structurally-controlled or shear-hosted quartz, sericite schist gold mineralization model 
with alteration halo (Type 1) matches that of the Vindaloo and Madras NW deposits.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Introduction 

Endeavour acquired Avion Gold Corporation in late October 2012, which included the wholly 
owned subsidiary, Avion Gold (Burkina Faso) SARL, which owns the rights to the Houndé 
Exploration Permits.  Exploration that was carried out prior to the acquisition by Endeavour, has 
been presented in previous reports and most recently in the Preliminary Economic Assessment 
(PEA) report by Rykaart, et. al, 2013.  Immediately after Endeavour acquired the right to the 
property, drilling resumed with a goal to convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral 
Resources and to convert some of the near-surface Indicated Mineral Resources to Measured 
Mineral Resources.  This drilling and a summary of the historic drill programs carried out over the 
Vindaloo zone, will be presented in Section 10, Drilling.  

Upon reception of the PEA, which indicated a potential economically viable project, a 1 metre 
contour map was created, developed from a satellite image collected in January 2013, additional 
metallurgical samples were collected and sent to SGS Perth for processing, additional thin section 
work was contracted, an auger drilling program as part of a sterilization program, was completed, 
additional IP surveys were carried out, a sterilization drilling program was carried out, and 
feasibility, ESIA and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) studies were initiated.  With the exception of 
the auger drilling program, IP survey and a summary of near-by exploration opportunities, the rest 
of the exploration and technical study results will be presented in other sections of this report. 

9.2 Auger Drilling Program 

An auger drilling program was initiated over those areas likely to be impacted by mine 
infrastructure including the potential tailings pond sites, mine and camp sites, waste dump sites 
and water dam site (Figure 9.2.1).  Auger holes were designed to drill through the overlying laterite 
and alluvium so that the upper metre or so, of saprolite could be sampled and sent to the laboratory 
for analysis.  Auger holes were drilled 25 metres apart on lines spaced every 200 metres.  In total 
1,977 auger holes totalling 13,760 metres of drilling, were completed as summarized below in 
Table 9.2.1.

Samples, representing one metre of drilling, were collected in rice bags under the supervision of a 
geologist.  Prior to splitting (to reduce sample size), the contents of the rice sack were stirred to 
produce a uniform mixture.  The sample was then reduced to 2 kg using a coning and quartering 
procedure with the sample transferred into a numbered plastic sample bag with a corresponding 
sample tag, sealed and dispatched twice a day to the Houndé exploration camp.  Note that all 
sample equipment (sample bowls and scoops) were bristle brush cleaned before collecting the 
assay sample and that the drill rods were metal brushed to remove any material sticking to the 
rods.

Figure 9.2.1 Summary of Auger Drilling Sampling Results 

All assay samples were sent to SGS Laboratories in Ouagadougou where they were first crushed 
to 75% passing 2 mm with the sample passed over a riffle splitter with up to 1.5 kg of 2 mm 
material pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns with a ring and puck pulveriser to create a pulp.  
The pulp was then analysed for gold by fire assay method FAE505 with aqua regia digestion 
extracted into a DIBK (336-diisobutylketone) solution with AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy) 
finish and a gold detection limit of 2 ppb.  SGS operates a Quality System, which accords to ISO 
17025 standards.  The Quality Control systems in place are such that analysis of blanks, standard 
reference material, repeats and re-splits account for up to 25% of all determinations conducted.  As 
part of the international group of SGS laboratories, the laboratory takes part in a regular Round 
Robin sample analysis to check for bias or systematic error.  All the above include 5% random 
repeats for all routine mineral analysis, as well as confirmation of anomalous results.

Basic geological information, including laterite thickness and type and depth to saprolite, was 
collected for each hole. 

The auger program was successful in defining several gold enriched trends that were either 
obscured by younger cover or not covered by previous soil sample surveys.  Only the mine site and 
waste pile areas returned significant anomalous gold values from the auger drill program which 
aided in the definition of 11 anomalous zones that are indicated in Figure 9.2.2.  As well, the auger 
drill data supports the northern extension of the Nema and Koho zones with the strongest Au 
anomaly identified near the likely northern extensions of the Koho zone.

9.3 Induced Polarization Sterilization Survey 

Induced polarization (IP) gradient surveys were completed over three areas that might have been 
covered by mine infrastructure including the tailings pond, water dam and waste pile areas 
between February 14 and 28, 2013 by Sagax Afrique based in Ouagadougou.  A total of 
57.0 line km of IP survey was completed on lines spaced 400 metres apart (Figure 9.3.1) over the 
water dam and tailings sites and 200 metres apart over the waste dump site.  IP gradient readings 
were taken every 25 metres.  The IP data trends in conjunction with the auger survey Au results 
and geological information allowed for the development of targets and subsequent drill testing.  
Follow-up targets were only identified in the waste pile area with drill results presented in report 
Section 10.  The results of the IP surveys are presented in Figures 9.3.2 to 9.3.4.  Figure 9.3.2 also 
includes the interpreted gold mineralization trends from the auger drill survey.

9.4 Exploration Targets 

This section will present exploration targets proximal to the Vindaloo zone that were identified 
during the drill programs carried out over the Houndé property by Avion Burkina from 2010 to the 
end of the current in-fill and sterilization drilling program.  In summary six mineralization trends, 
Vindaloo, Madras, Madras NW, Koho East, Nema and Yabiro, were identified.  The Koho East, 
Nema and Yabiro trends will be discussed in section 10 with recent drilling.  Each of the remaining 
areas will be presented separately below.  Section references are based on detailed drill section 
sets (Figure 10.2.2), which will not be part of this report and can be accessed, with permission, 
from Endeavour. 

9.4.1 Vindaloo Trend 

Drilling along, and proximal to, the Vindaloo trend has intersected both mineralized zones and 
sericite-carbonate-epidote altered zones, without mineralization.  As a general statement, the 
Vindaloo zones are open both along strike and to depth.  The general location of most of the 
various target areas can be discerned from Figure 10.2.1. 

Vindaloo South Target Area 

Significant opportunities to extend the zone both to depth and along strike have been identified at 
the southern end of the deposit where the deepest holes along a 500 metres strike length showed 
either the best intercept on that section, below the 200 metre elevation or a significant increase in 
the width of the altered gabbro host for the mineralization.  A section by section description, where 
there is drill information, follows: 

� On section 48350N, the deepest hole, HE-12-01 returned 2.47 g/t Au over 5.7 metres and 
intersected a 25 metre wide alteration zone compared to hole HA-12-92, located 
25 metres above which intersected 10 metres of altered gabbro.  

� On section 48375N the alteration zone in hole HE-12-07, the deepest hole, is 
approximately 100 metres wide compared to hole HE-12-03, located 50 metres above, 
which has two, approximately 15 metre wide alteration zones.  As well, hole HE-12-07 
returned three high grade intercepts, located up to 75 metres below the pit floor which 
included 16.00 g/t Au over 8.1 metres, 9.57 g/t Au over 7.2 metres and 28.25 g/t Au over 
6.8 metres.  These intercepts are open to the north.  

� The next set of holes to the north lie on section 48450N.  The alteration zone on this 
section is approximately 100 metres wide and the deepest hole on the section, HA-12-41 
returned intercepts of 1.38 g/t Au over 48.1 metres including 1.86 g/t Au over 10.1 metres 
located 10 to 50 metres below the pit floor.  

� Another 50 metres to the north, on section 48500N, the deepest hole returned 6.27 g/t Au 
over 43.2 metres that lies within the pit envelope and an intercept of 3.07 g/t Au over 
9.5 metres, below the pit floor.  

� On section 48550N, hole H-11-18 intersected 2.84 g/t Au over 4.1 metres, at about 
85 metres below the surface, which appears to be close to the upper extension of the 
high grade zone in this area.  It is likely that there is better mineralization to depth.

� This concept that the zone significantly improves with depth is supported by an intercept 
on hole HE-12-08, of 4.18 g/t Au over 24.4 metres on section 48700N; this intercept is 
just below 200 metres elevation and just over 125 metres from surface.  Between this 
hole and the high grade intercept in hole HE-12-06, there are no holes below the 
200 metre elevation.  

� More support for this concept comes from an intercept of 2.57 g/t Au over 26.3 metres in 
hole HE-12-09 on section 48750N.  This hole intersects near the base of the planned pit, 
below 200 metres elevation and is the deepest hole on the section. 

� Section 48775N deepest hole, HE-12-10, below the 200 metre elevation, returned 
4.25 g/t Au over 10.0 metres. 

� On section 48800N, the deepest hole, HE-12-11 returned a strong intercept of 10.63 g/t 
Au over 28.2 metres. 

� The final section, 48850N, of this apparent high grade, apparently elevation-controlled 
trend, returned 4.68 g/t Au over 38.4 metres in hole H-11-77. 

Vindaloo Far South Target 

Vindaloo SW target area lies approximately 1,000 metres south of the proposed Vindaloo pit.  This 
area lies along the strike extension of the Vindaloo pit and became an area of interest when a 2011 
core hole returned 10.17 g/t Au over 8.0 metres core length (Table 9.4.1).  In total, 11 holes 
totalling 2,343.5 metres were drilled along a 550 metre strike, in this area (Figure 9.4.1).  The 
mineralized zone appears to be generally quite narrow with potentially economic values along an 
approximate 100 metre strike length.  The generally low grade of the assay values is in contrast 
with logging observations which indicated strong alteration and quartz veining.

Soukou 

The Soukou area lies approximately 2 km southwest of the Vindaloo Far South zone along the 
Vindaloo trend.  This area is an artisanal mining area, that when last reviewed in Q2, 2012, 
encompassed an area approximately 200 metres wide by about 500 metres long.  This area has 
not been sampled or drill tested.

Section 49000N Area 

In this area, the holes HE-12-14 and HD-12-30 were not drilled far enough to either intersect the 
zone or entire zone.  Holes on sections 25 and 50 metres to the south returned intercepts of 
5.34 g/t Au over 7.2 metres and 5.99 g/t Au over 12.7 metres, respectively in this area.  Hole 
HE-12-14 was not drilled far enough east to intersect the zone and hole HD-12-30 returned a 
partial intercept of 1.86 g/t Au over 1.0 metres. 

Area North of Section 50600N near 50200E 

In this area, the mineralized zone appears to jog to the west.  Geologically, this mineralization 
correlates better with the Vindaloo West zone, that was intersected approximately 60 to 70 metres 
west of the Vindaloo Main zone, some 600 metres to the south.  IP geophysical chargeability, 
indicates that the Vindaloo Main zone may extend further to the north than tested by drilling, as it is 
not uncommon for the mineralization to disappear when the gabbro unit is absent. 

Section 51100N 

On this section, the deepest hole, H-11-40, right at the pit base, returned 2.55 g/t Au over 
37.0 metres.  This intercept correlates with strongly altered gabbro and may indicate a steep 
northerly plunge to the mineralization in this area.  The adjacent holes that test this vertical 
elevation lie 25 metres to the south and 75 metres to the north. 

Zone Trend from 52000N to 52450N 

In this section of the trend, the altered gabbro appears to increase in width to depth and attain 
down hole thicknesses of up of 150 metres (with subordinate unaltered gabbro).  In other areas, 
where the altered gabbro increased in width, economic grade zones were intersected nearby. 

Section 126475N (Rotated Grid) 

The pit is being pulled down in the area by a hole, H-11-100, that returned 51.63 g/t Au over 
8.0 metres.  Holes in this area are spaced approximately every 50 metres.  It would be prudent to 
better define this high grade area before mining. 

9.4.2 Madras Zone 

The Madras zone lies immediately north of the Vindaloo Trend pits, immediately east of the power 
line and the Madras NW pits. The Madras zone likely represents the northern continuation of the 
Vindaloo trend of mineralization. Previous work in the area included 13 holes totalling 1,725 metres 
with the most recent drilling being carried out in the first half of 2012.  Best intercepts include 4.1 g/t 
Au over 8.0 metres in hole H-10-24 and 2.78 g/t Au over 22.0 metres in KNRC-032 (Table 9.4.2).  
This zone has not seen sufficient drilling to define mineral resources and until recently, the strike of 
the zones was not known.  In Q1 and Q2 of 2013, artisanal activity increased dramatically to close 
to 1000 people and then declined to a handful by the end of the period.  Their excavation activity 
indicated that the Madras zone comprises two en-echelon, northerly trending zones that have been 
traced for approximately 100 and 70 metres (Figure 9.4.2).

9.4.3 Koho 

The Koho zone lies approximately 300 to 350 metres to the east of the Vindaloo Main zone.  
Drilling has traced the zone for 3.6 km along strike and auger drilling data indicates it will likely 
extend for another 900 metres further north for a total strike length of 4.5 km (Figure 9.4.4).  Drilling 
has returned wide zones of low grade gold with intercepts of up to 112 metres grading 0.46 g/t Au 
and 27.2 g/t Au over 2.0 metres (Table 9.4.3).  Avion Gold completed 11 holes totalling 
1,855 metres.  Goldbelt had previously completed 13 holes totalling 1,263 metres.  The zone is 
hosted by strongly altered gabbro, similar in character to that which hosts the Vindaloo zone.  
Since this zone lies just outside of the pit area, locally displays economic grade and widths, and 
based on experience at the Vindaloo zone where strongly mineralized zones are often dependent 
on vertical elevation, additional drill testing is warranted.

9.4.4 Induced Polarization Survey Anomalies 

Induced polarization geophysical surveys have been completed and compiled along approximately 
18 km of the Vindaloo Trend (Figure 9.4.5) by Sagax Afrique during a period from 2010 to 2013.  
With the focus on the Vindaloo zones and Madras NW, there has been limited follow-up of this 
data.  As a result, a substantial amount of the IP survey results, still require follow-up.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Introduction  

Endeavour initiated an in-fill drill program over the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones in late October 
2012, with a goal to convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources and some 
of the Indicated Mineral Resources to Measured Mineral Resources.  This program consisted of 
358 holes totalling 40,534 metres (Table 10.1.1).  Including this drill program, during the period 
from 2007 to 2013, Endeavour, Avion Gold, Goldbelt and African Barrick completed 751 core and 
RC holes totalling 103,677 meters along the Vindaloo and Madras NW zones (Table 10.1.2).  All of 
this data has been digitized, incorporated into section sets, interpreted and used as the basis for 
this study.  The data from these exploration programs is used in the current mineral resource 
estimate and is described in in greater detail in Sections 11, 12 and 14 of this report: Sample 
Preparation; Analysis and Security; Data Verification and; Mineral Resource Estimate, respectively.  
As well, a PEA report titled Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Houndé 
Gold Project, Burkina Faso, West Africa by Rykaart et. al., 2013 and filed in Sedar under 
Endeavour's name and a report titled Technical Report and Resource Estimate on the Houndé 
Property, Burkina Faso, Africa by Kappenschneider et. al., 2012, filed in Sedar under Avion Gold 
Corporation, present the pre-Endeavour drill programs in more detail. 

In addition, during 2013, Endeavour completed 10 geotechnical holes, 12 holes to test substrate for 
infrastructure, 8 water test boreholes and 35 RC sterilization holes (Table 10.1.1).  With the 
exception of the sterilization hole results which will be described in this section, the other drill holes 
will be described in other parts of the report.

10.2 In-Fill Drill Program 

During the period from late October, 2012 to end of March, 2013, Endeavour completed 358 in-fill 
holes totalling 40,534 metres of which 39% of the holes were core holes (Figure 10.2.1) and the 
remainder were reverse circulation holes.  These holes were drilled with a goal of converting 
Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources and converting some of the near-
surface Indicated Mineral Resources to Measured Mineral Resources, within the PEA pit limits.  
According to the previous resource study (Rykart et. al., 2013), this objective of defining Indicated 
Mineral Resources could be achieved by designing and completing a drill program, with hole pierce 
points on the mineralized zones, every 50 metres; similarly, the objective of defining Measured 
Mineral Resources could be achieved with hole pierce points on the mineralized zones, every 
25 metres. 

In order to facilitate the drill testing of the Vindaloo zone, a false grid, oriented parallel to the bulk of 
the Vindaloo zone mineralization, was created.  The false grid is anchored at UTM coordinates 
441,600N and 1,261,900E with initial coordinates of 50,000 N and 50,000 E (Figure 10.2.2).  This 
section set follows the zone trend for 4.35 km from section 48,125N to 52,475N at an azimuth of 
035 degrees.  At the northern end of the section set (52,475N), the Vindaloo zone trends more 
northerly.  At this point, the Vindaloo section set is rotated back to UTM grid coordinates from 
1,203,925N to 1,204,525N for an additional 600 metres.  Sections that display down-hole geology, 
summarized geology, alteration, color-coded individual assays, assay composites, mineralization 
wire frames and potential pit outline, have been produced for every 25 metres along strike. 

Modelling work has outlined 39 separate, semi-parallel lenses of mineralization that comprise the 
Vindaloo and Madras NW zones, of which 6 of the lenses contain the bulk of the mineral resources.  
The Vindaloo deposit, which includes Madras NW consists of a group of open-ended, closely-
spaced gold-mineralized structures that can be traced for approximately 5.6 kilometres.  The 
Vindaloo zone has been tested to a maximum depth of approximately 350 meters with individual 
lenses of gold mineralization up to approximately 70 meters wide.  Open pit resources were 
modelled to a maximum of 300 meters depth.  The Vindaloo zone mineralization is open along 
strike and to depth.  Within and adjacent to the modelled area, there are indications of additional 
hanging wall parallel zones and mineralized cross-structures.  These areas are under- explored 
and need follow-up.  There is a reasonable likelihood that additional drilling will result in additional 
mineral resources.

The mineralization along the Vindaloo trend is subdivided into six general areas as shown in 
Figure 10.2.3.  Typical sections through the better parts of Vindaloo South (Vindaloo section 
48450N, Figure 10.2.4), Vindaloo Main (Vindaloo section 49750N, Figure 10.2.5), Vindaloo 
Northeast (Vindaloo section 51000N, Figure 10.2.6), Vindaloo 2 (Vindaloo North section 
1264150 N, Figure 10.2.7) and Madras NW (section 14 of 42, Figure 10.2.8) zones are inserted for 
reference. Vindaloo West lies to the west of the Vindaloo Main zone and is presented on 
Figure 10.2.5.  The mineralized zones generally dip steeply to the west and are generally hosted by 
altered gabbro intrusions.  The Vindaloo 2 and Madras NW zones, located at the northern end of 
the deposit trend, dip moderately to steeply to the west.

10.3.2 RC Sterilization Drill Results 

Of the 35 sterilization holes that were drilled, 16 holes returned intercepts of greater than 1 g/t Au 
over 1.0 metres, with 2 holes returning multiple drill intercepts.  A summary of the significant results 
is presented in the following table.  This program was successful in extending the Nema zone to 
the north, extending the Yabiro zone along strike and the discovery of the Koho East zone.  The 
best intercepts of the sterilization program were returned from the Koho East zone with 2.65 g/t Au 
over 8.0 metres (Figure 10.3.2).

Figure 10.3.2 Significant RC Sterilization Results  

The Nema trend returned a best hole of 1.15 g/t Au over 7.5 metres (Figure 10.3.2).  This trend can 
be traced for approximately 3 km through a combination of anomalous Au values in auger samples 
and from drilling.  At one point the Nema trend passes under a major power line.  

The Yabiro trend was first intersected with drill holes designed to test induced polarization highs 
during the Vindaloo area drill program where an exploration hole returned 1.7 g/t Au over 
4.0 metres.  Subsequent drilling indicated that the Yabiro zone is likely two en-echelon mineralized 
structures (Figure 10.3.2) with a best drill intercept of 3.26 g/t Au over 3.0 metres.  The remainder 
of the intercepts are less than 1 metre wide, true width.  The Yabiro zone lies up slope from an up 
to 500 metre by 300 metre area of shallow, generally less than 1 metre deep, artisanal workings.  
The zone appears to be hosted by altered gabbro, which is similar in character to the host of the 
Vindaloo zone.  One deeper hole on this zone (HD-13-157) indicated that the width of the altered 
gabbro increases to 25 metres wide at depth of 110 metres from surface.  This zone is open along 
strike and to depth.

The Koho East zone discovery seems to be the most interesting zone that resulted from the RC 
sterilization program with intercepts to 2.65 g/t Au over 8.0 metres (Figure 10.3.2).  This zone is 
hosted by quartz-veined and pyritic iron carbonatized massive mafic volcanic rocks.  The quartz 
veins appear to be oriented as left stepping, en-echelon veins, trending N045, within a N025-
trending corridor based on the small occurrence located 320 m south of HD-13-147.  Visible gold in 
quartz veining was discovered during a site visit at the occurrence.  The Koho East Zone pinches 
and swells, with the assay results demonstrating that there is gold enrichment (>100 ppb) over 3 to 
23 metres even though, locally, the grades are not economic.  From drilling and auger drilling 
results, the zone can be traced for approximately 1,000 metres.  The northern part of Koho East 
Zone appears potentially economic over a strike length of 470 metres.  It is open to the north along 
one of the intermittent creeks, and at depth.  The southern part, however, appears limited both 
along strike and to depth, although the zone might pass to the west of holes HD-13-175 and HD-
13-176 as there are no auger samples south of these two holes.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

From 2010 to June 2013 sample preparation, analysis and security have been under the 
supervision of at least two and up to six contract geologists employed on site at any given time.  All 
samples collected by Endeavour, or by third parties contracted by Endeavour, were subject to 
quality control procedures that ensured that industry best practice was utilised for the handling, 
sampling, transport, analysis, storage and documentation of sample material and analytical results. 

For sample preparation and analysis, Endeavour has used the services of SGS Bureau de Liaison 
("SGS") laboratories at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso and Morila, Mali.  SGS is also a global 
independent provider of assaying and analytical testing services for the mining and mineral 
exploration industry with consistent quality standards implemented across all regions.  Whilst they 
are not formally accredited, the SGS laboratories at Ouagadougou and Morila operate to ISO 
17025 standards.  As part of the international group of SGS laboratories, all laboratories take part 
in regular Round Robin sample analysis to check for bias or systematic error. 

11.1 Historical Sampling (Goldbelt Resources, Avocet)  

Endeavour / Avion carried out drilling and sampling campaigns during 2010 to 2013.  Prior to this, 
Rotary Air Blast (RAB), Reverse Circulation (RC) and diamond (core) drilling was carried out by 
Barrick, Goldbelt Resources and Avocet Mining.  

The samples were analyzed by Abilabs (Mali) and SGS Ouagadougou.  Blanks, standards and 
duplicates were used to test the accuracy of the respective labs. Generally, every 10th sample was 
a control sample for QA/QC purposes.  Blanks, standards and duplicates were used in equal 
numbers. 

11.2 Sample Submission 

A sample submission form detailing the sample number sequences and laboratory instructions 
accompanied every sample dispatch.  On arrival at the laboratory, the samples are checked by 
SGS against the submission to ensure all samples were received.  At completion of assaying and 
once results have been delivered by SGS, Endeavour geological staff confirms that all the 
submitted samples were analyzed by the methods requested by the client. 

11.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

11.3.1 RC Drilling Samples 

RC samples were collected as 1 m sample lengths in bags directly from the cyclone discharge at 
the drill rig.  The sample was then riffle split into a numbered sample bag with the corresponding 
sample tag to produce a sample of approximately 2 kg in size.  The riffle splitters, plates, tubs and 
working areas were cleaned with compressed air after each sample was processed.  The 
remaining reject sample was returned to the bulk plastic bag and remained at the drill site.  
Representative drill chips are collected from each 1 m sample reject and glued to a sample board 
for future reference.

Approximately 30 assay samples were placed in large polyweave bags and transported to the 
Endeavour exploration camp at Houndé.  The samples were then transported to the laboratory by 
Endeavour personal or collected by SGS.  All RC samples were sent to the SGS laboratory in 
Ouagadougou where they were logged into the laboratory information management system 
("LIMS"), weighed and dried.  The submitted samples were crushed and pulverised to 85% passing 
75 micron using an LM2 pulveriser.  The pulveriser was flushed with barren material after each 
sample.  A nominal 50 g pulp aliquot was analysed for gold by lead collection fire assay with AAS 
instrumentation. 

11.3.2 Diamond Drilling Samples 

Diamond core was placed in steel core boxes holding either four metres of HQ size or five metres 
of NQ size core.  Core trays were marked with the drill hole number and downhole distance for the 
start and finish of the core in the tray.  Core orientation was undertaken in competent fresh rock 
and completed at the drill site.  The core trays are transported from the drilling site to the 
Endeavour exploration camp at Houndé where the core is laid out for geological logging, 
photographing and other data collection. 

Specific intervals for sampling based on lithology were identified during the logging process and the 
core was cut in half along its longitudinal axis with a purpose-built diamond-blade core saw.  After 
the core was cut, the right hand side of the cut core (looking down hole) was placed in plastic 
sample bags and sealed with the remaining core left in the core box.  The sample bags were then 
picked up by a representative of SGS when a sufficient number of samples were collected and 
transported to either SGS Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso or Morila, Mali. 

On arrival at the laboratory, the samples were logged into LIMS, weighed, dried and finely crushed.  
Samples were crushed to a nominal 2 mm diameter using a jaw crusher, with a sub-sample of 
<1.5 kg taken using a Jones-type riffle splitter.  Reject material was retained in the original bag and 
stored.  The sub-sample was pulverised to 85% passing 75 micron using an LM2 pulveriser.  
Approximately 200 g was taken for assay and the remainder placed in a plastic bag.  The 
pulveriser was flushed with barren material after each sample.  A nominal 50 g pulp aliquot was 
analysed for gold by lead collection fire assay with AAS instrumentation. 

11.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programmes  

A program of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) has been undertaken by Endeavour 
to check for contamination, accuracy and precision within the drill sampling and assaying process.  
The types of check samples that have been introduced into the sample stream include blank 
samples ("blanks"), certified reference materials ("standards"), and field duplicate samples.  

A total of 5,326 records for client introduced blanks, standards, and field duplicates with Au values 
were in the database of 77,054 Au records.  This equates to a total insertion rate of control 
samples of approximately 7%.  A more detailed breakdown is 2,071 standard samples (2.6%); 
2,152 blank samples (2.8%) and 1,103 field duplicates (1.4%).  In addition, 3,196 internal 
laboratory standard results (4.1%); 2,899 internal laboratory blank samples (3.8%) and 169 pulp 
duplicates were also produced and analysed during the time period.

In addition, the SGS laboratories have their own internal quality performance processes which 
follow best practice guidelines required for qualification under International Organisation for 
Standardisation ("ISO") standards.  The standard QA/QC protocols for the laboratories include the 
insertion of CRMs, blanks, duplicates and repeat assaying to monitor the quality of the preparation 
and analytical processes of the laboratory. 

Overall, the QAQC samples have performed satisfactorily and indicate the sample data is suitable 
for mineral resource estimation. 

11.4.1 Standards 

A number of standards were used to verify the ability of the laboratory to accurately determine the 
gold values.  For DDH and RC drill samples, one certified reference standard was typically inserted 
into the sample stream for each group of 20 samples (5.0%).  

Fifty three different standards were utilised as control samples and are detailed in Table 11.4.1 
below and Appendix 11.1.  The G* series of standards used by Endeavour were obtained from 
Geostats Pty Ltd based in Australia.  All others were internal lab standards from various sources.  
AMIS series was obtained from AMIS in South Africa.  The AU* series was obtained from Data 
Analysis Australia, OX* and S* series from Rocklabs New Zealand, and ST* series being internal 
SGS standards.

Ninety five samples representing about 4.5% of the 2,071 client field inserted standard samples 
included in the database exceeded two standard deviations (SD) from the expected value for gold 
(Table 11.4.2 and Table 11.4.3).  Two SD is considered to be the acceptable variance limit above 
which follow up of the associated sample assay batch is recommended.  Additionally there were 
50 samples representing 1.5% of the 3,196 internal laboratory inserted standards which exceeded 
two standard deviations. 

The Houndé site technical department advised that 1,169 samples were re-assayed when a review 
of the sample results indicated that the standards returned assay values greater than 3 SD off the 
accepted data value. In addition, standards that returned assays values greater than 2 SD from the 
norm, in mineralized sections, were also re-run. 

Some of the large deviations from the certified standard value can be attributed to sample handling 
errors, involving accidental switching of standards in the sample stream.  The identified cases of 
sample switching and mislabelling of the standards represent about 1% of the data and were not 
accounted for among the failed samples in the final statistics.  See Appendix 11.4 for further details 
regarding these samples. 

There are 7 internal laboratory inserted standards which could not be analysed as there were not 
enough samples (4 or less). 

There are biases both positive and negative, observed in most of the results from the field inserted 
standard.  These biases were observed throughout the period being analysed affecting the 
SGS_MORILA laboratory, even though this laboratory analysed samples only during the 2012 
period.  The main standards involved were G907-7; at SGS_OUA and G301-3; G907-7 and G907-
2; at SGS_MORILA. 

There are 4 samples that could not be associated with a known standard.  Their values could not 
be associated with any expected value as a possible misclassified standard ID.  This may indicate 
possible sample swaps and should be investigated.  See Appendix 11.4 for further details on these 
samples. 

Although most of the assay biases are small (�5%) and can be attributed to expected instrument 
drift within the laboratories, some of the laboratory inserted standards also show positive and 
negative biases.  The main standards affected are: AUOJ-6; SG56; SH55.  A possible recalibration 
of OXK94 between December 2012 and January 2013 can be observed.

11.4.2 Blanks 

Assay blanks are used to check the possibility of contamination during the sampling or analytical 
procedure and are inserted into the sample stream at a nominal frequency of 1 blank sample for 
each group of 20 samples (5%) submitted to the assay laboratory. 

Two types of blank material have been included in the database.  The first one has been field 
inserted and is made out of building sand prepared on-site.  This material does not have a certified 
assay value; however, it is assumed to have a very low Au value (<0.01 ppm) which is well below 
the threshold for the mineralised zone.  The second type of blank material is an internal control 
sample used by both SGS laboratories Ouagadougou and Morila.  As no certified assay values are 
available for these blank materials, expected values of 0.01 ppm Au have been assumed which 
corresponds to 10 times the assay detection limit (0.001 ppm Au).  Greater than five times the 
expected value (0.05 ppm Au) was considered an acceptable upper limit to assess for 
contamination. 

A review of the data has shown that of the 2,152 field inserted blank samples contained in the 
database, 2 returned a gold value outside of the accepted limits, which is considered an excellent 
result.  However, of the lab inserted blank samples 44 SGS_MORILA and 12 SGS-OUA, a total of 
56 samples were outside of the accepted limits representing 2.6% of the total blanks inserted by 
the labs.  See Appendices 11.2 and 11.4 for further information regarding these samples.

11.4.3 Duplicate Samples 

The term duplicate is a generic name for a repeat measure of the original sample.  Duplicates are 
used to verify the repeatability and degree of precision of the analyses.  They can also be used to 
verify the quality of the sample preparation process.  In addition, when duplicates are sent to a 
secondary laboratory, they can also be utilized to verify the accuracy of the results of the primary 
laboratory.

Q-Q plot, and relative paired difference plots (RPD).  Scatter plots allow comparison of the data 
pairs and assessing general dispersion as well as the data regression and the presence of any 
outliers.  Comparison of the duplicate pairs in a Q-Q plot will show if any bias exists within a 
particular grade range.  Finally, RPD plots evaluate the relative differences in per cent between 
pairs and allow the relative precision of samples to be determined through the calculation of the 
average coefficient of variation (ACV).  The calculation of the ACV was set to consider only values 
>0.01 ppm Au, which is considered the threshold for mineralised material.  This type of chart also 
allows for the visualization of any bias or trend that may occur.  The results of the analysis of these 
samples are outlined below in Table 11.4.6 and Appendix 11.3.

Field Duplicates  

A total of 1,103 field duplicate samples were submitted to SGS_OUA and SGS_MORILA.  All 
samples submitted, were RC field duplicates.  There were no diamond field duplicates submitted. 

In the analysis of the scatter plots, correlation coefficients were 0.673 at SGS_OUA and 0.907 at 
SGS_MORILA, with both datasets containing extreme outliers which were biasing the data.  When 
the outliers were removed this improved the correlation coefficients to an acceptable level of 0.965 
and 0.97 respectively.  

Q-Q plots show poor precision at both laboratories particularly for values close to the detection 
limit.  This was the case when a filter of 0.25 ppm Au was applied to both sets of data, in 
conjunction with the removal of the extreme outliers in both datasets.  SGS_OUA also showed poor 
precision and repeatability for assay values >5.0 ppm Au. 

The analysis of RPD plots show values of ACV of 34% for SGS_OUA and 50% for SGS_MORILA. 
This lower than expected level of precision improves to 32% and 26% after the removal of extreme 
outliers in conjunction with a filter of 0.25 ppm Au for both datasets was applied.  This level of 
precision is just inside the recommended acceptable range for Au.

The field duplicate assays show acceptable precision at both laboratories after removal of outliers, 
however, it is recommended that the presence of these outliers be investigated as it could indicate: 

� Sampling procedure / issues associated with low homogeneity of the pulp samples; and 

� Poor precision of the assay laboratory. 

Coarse Duplicates (Rejects) 

There were no coarse duplicates available for analysis for this project. 

Pulp Duplicates 

There were no client initiated pulp duplicates available for analysis for this project. 

A total of 169 internal laboratory pulp duplicate samples were analysed by SGS_OUA on 
approximately 1:20 samples per batch from 2012 onwards. 

The scatter plot shows a correlation coefficient of 1.0 and an ACV of 7% which is an excellent 
result.  

Umpire Duplicates  

There were no umpire duplicate samples available for analysis for this project. 

11.4.4 Recommendations 

It is recommended for future drilling campaigns, that a smaller selection of certified standards be 
used, in order to have a more meaningful number of results for analysis.  

Although the performance of the blank assay samples is very good, the natural variability in the 
assays for the BLANK (internal material) makes the determination of possible contamination issues 
difficult.  A certified blank assay sample should be sourced to ensure a more homogenous and 
predictable assay result. 

The levels of precision observed in field duplicates are considered acceptable.  However, the 
presence of outliers creating bias in the datasets at both laboratories should be investigated as it 
may indicate underlying issues with laboratory procedures. 

For diamond drill samples, the recommended standard practise is that one field duplicate is 
nominally inserted into the sample stream for each 30 samples (3.3%).  The duplicate is generally 
a quarter cut core sample obtained from the remaining half core assay sample.  When RC drilling, 
the supervising geologist should select one or two "mineralised" metre samples to be re-split and 
submitted as field duplicates.

It is recommended that a duplicate pulp sample be taken and analysed at the minimum rate of 1:40 
at the same time as the original pulp sample is taken.  This ensures that errors due to sampling 
procedure and analytical method are removed.  In addition, when the samples are pulverised 
regular routine wet screening should be done in order to check that the grind size of the pulp is to 
contract specifications.  

It is recommended that coarse duplicates be taken and analysed at the same lab at a minimum 
rate of 1:40 samples per batch. 

It is recommended that 50 to 100 pulp samples per month from mineralised zones be submitted to 
a second independent laboratory selected by client as an umpire check of the assay grade. 

In order to sufficiently explain likely causes for the data biases, datasets containing all available 
information should be presented in a standard format containing crucial information such as Date 
Labjob Received, Labjobno and LaboratoryID for Original and/or Duplicate datasets.  In addition, 
access to a selection of the raw data files from each laboratory would enable a more accurate 
analysis of the data over time. 

11.5 ICP Analysis 

A total of 2,429 core samples were also tested for whole rock analysis and additional elements.  
35 elements were analyzed, i.e. Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Li, Mg, 
Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr. 

The sample preparation was carried out by SGS Ouagadougou.  The lab then sent the pulps to 
SGS Canada for ICP analysis.  The method to arrive at pulps was the same as for Au testing. 

11.6 Density Analysis  

More than 2,000 density measurements were taken by Endeavour in 2012 and 2013.  The samples 
were prepared and measured at site at Houndé by technicians under the supervision of geologists.  
The rock type and weathering (oxide, transition, fresh) was recorded. 

Competent core was sawn to pieces of approximately 300 grams.  In cases of highly oxidized rock, 
pieces of appropriate length were chosen.  The samples were sun dried for two days before 
preparation.  The density was then determined by the following procedure: 

a) The dry sample was weighed and the weight was recorded in a spreadsheet. 

b) The sample was covered with a thin wax film. 

c) The wax covered sample was weighed and the weight was recorded. 

d) The sample was put in water, weighed and the weight was recorded.

e) The density of the sample was calculated using the following formula: 

 
SG= Specific Gravity 
A= mass of dry sample 
B= mass of waxed sample out of water 
C= mass of waxed sample in water 
D= density of paraffin (0.9) 

 

11.7 Sample Security 

All diamond core and split RC samples were trucked to Endeavour's secure (walled and lockable) 
central exploration camp at Houndé.  Once the diamond core was sampled, both RC and diamond 
samples have the QA/QC samples inserted into the sample stream.  Assay samples were placed in 
sealed and numbered polyweave or plastic bags for transport.  The samples are delivered by batch 
to the laboratory either by Endeavour personnel or collected by SGS.  Upon receipt, the laboratory 
personnel signed off on the secure receipt of all the samples. 

All aspects of the RC and diamond sample collection were conducted by personnel under the 
supervision of Endeavour's experienced geological staff. 

11.8 Author's Comments 

The Author witnessed all aspects of the collection, preparation and dispatch of drill samples carried 
out by Endeavour.  The sample collection and preparation, analytical techniques, security and 
QA/QC protocols implemented for the Vindaloo Gold Project are consistent with standard industry 
practice and are suitable for the reporting of exploration results and for use in mineral resource 
estimation.  The sampling procedures are adequate for and consistent with the style of gold 
mineralisation under consideration.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, the Author visited the Vindaloo Project 
between 9 February and 13 February 2013. 

The site visit involved comprehensive data verification, inspections and reviews of the following: 

� geology and exploration history of the permit area; 

� current drilling and sampling procedures; 

� ground checking of main Project area; 

� geochemistry and drilling data; 

� QA/QC procedures and control data; 

� data and database management systems; 

� SGS analytical laboratory in Ouagadougou; 

� sample handling and storage facility in Houndé; and 

� independent verification sampling of mineralised gold intercepts from the active drilling 
program. 

12.1 Project Drill Hole Database 

The drill hole database is managed on site by Endeavour geological staff.  Cube was provided with 
the final database dated 7 May 2013 and an updated database that corrected some minor previous 
errors on 30 July 2013.  For the purposes of this report, the May database was used. 

Cube completed validation checks prior to final interpretation and compositing for grade estimation.  
The validation checks included: 

� graphically check collar location with respect to topography; 

� graphically check downhole survey; 

� check discrepancies in maximum depths between collar, assay, survey and geology 
records; 

� check for overlapping and duplicate assay and geology records; and 

� Comparison of database assay records against original digital laboratory certificates.

Table 12.1.1 summarises the main tables and fields in the database used for the Mineral Resource 
estimation.  Three fields were introduced into the database as part of the audit completed by Cube.  
"Cube_dip" was included in the "SURVEY" table to remove inconsistencies with the recording of 
the down hole survey declination.  "Use_in_resource" was included in the "density" table to identify 
the measurements considered by Cube as acceptable for use in the resource estimation.  
"CubeAu1_ppm" was included in the NewASSAY table and represents the validated Au field used 
for grade estimation. 

Electronic laboratory certificate files supplied by SGS allowed 43% of the entire Au assay data to 
be validated.  The 43% of records verified represent 65% of the assays used directly for the 
compositing and estimation process.  

Subsequent to the completion of the Mineral Resource estimate, an additional drill hole database 
was supplied to Cube on the 31st July 2013.  This database included corrections made to the 
azimuth of some drill holes which were not adjusted for the magnetic declination (-3.6 degrees).  
This error only materially affects holes with intersections below 300 m drill length.  At this depth the 
error begins to exceed 10 metres and is present in approximately 5 drill holes.  Given the error only 
effects the drill hole azimuth and the resulting correction is along strike of the mineralisation, the 
net effect is not considered material. 

12.2 QAQC Analysis 

A program of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) has been undertaken by Endeavour 
to check for contamination, accuracy and precision within the drill sampling and assaying process.  
The types of check samples that have been introduced into the sample stream include blank 
samples ("blanks"), certified reference materials ("standards"), and field duplicate samples.  

Overall, the QAQC samples have performed satisfactorily and indicate the sample data is suitable 
for mineral resource estimation. 

12.3 Independent Verification Samples 

During the author's site visit, a total of 31 independent samples from 2 RC holes were collected.  
The holes were selected at random and the sample intervals were chosen to include a range of 
gold grades.  The samples were split from the remaining coarse reject sample bag.  For the sample 
submission, 2 standards and 1 blank sample were included in the sample sequence.  The author 
personally transported the samples to the SGS laboratory in Ouagadougou.  The sample 
submission requested analysis for gold using 50 g Fire Assay with AAS finish as this was the same 
technique employed for all resource sampling.  The results were emailed electronically from the 
laboratory to the author.  The results are tabulated in Table 12.3.1 and also presented graphically 
in Figure 12.3.1. 

There is generally a good correlation between the original and independently taken samples and 
the results are considered by the author to be acceptable.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 

Several comminution and metallurgical extraction testwork programmes have been performed on 
ore samples from the Houndé deposit.  Two preliminary testwork programmes were completed on 
samples from the Houndé deposit under the supervision of Endeavour.  The first programme was 
completed in 2010 at SGS Laboratory, Burkina Faso and the second programme was completed in 
2011 at the Endeavour Mining Tabakoto Plant metallurgical laboratory, Mali.  These programmes 
showed that the Houndé ores contain a significant amount of gravity gold and that high gold 
extraction by conventional cyanidation is achievable.  Review of this testwork is not included in this 
section. 

A third Houndé metallurgical testwork programme has been completed during 2013 at SGS 
Lakefield laboratory in Perth, Western Australia.  This detailed testwork programme was developed 
and supervised by Endeavour with results interpreted by Lycopodium for use in the feasibility 
study.  The results of the detailed programme are presented in this section of the report.   

13.2 Metallurgical Summary 

The metallurgical treatment route selected has been based on the results of the current testwork 
programme.  Full testwork details and testwork results of the SGS testwork programme, conducted 
on the 5 primary ore composites and the 22 individual variability samples, are included in the SGS 
report available on request from Endeavour.   

The Houndé project consists of 5 mining areas; Vindaloo, Vindaloo West, Vindaloo NE, Vindaloo 2 
and Madras, and three levels of weathering; primary, transition and saprolite.  The primary ores 
represent approximately 88% of the ore body with saprolite and transition ores making up the 
remaining 12%.  Primary ore from the Vindaloo pit makes up 80% of the primary ores and is the 
major component of the Houndé deposit. 

Comminution testwork indicated that the primary ores will require moderate grinding energy and 
have moderate abrasivity; however, the ores are highly competent and display a high resistance to 
impact breakage. 

Gravity concentrates for all ores contained an average of 60% of the feed gold in 6% of the feed 
mass.  Inclusion of a gravity concentration stage in the testwork procedure increased the leaching 
rate but had no impact on final overall gold extraction.  A gravity stage was included in the testwork 
and in the plant design. 

Grind sensitivity testwork on the primary composites indicated that lower residue grades, faster 
leaching rates and higher gold extractions are achieved with increasing fineness of grind.  Whilst 
gold leaching continued to occur through to 48 hours, an optimum residence time of 24 hours was 
selected for the design and further testwork.  The grind optimisation analysis indicated that similar 
net revenues at grinds of P80 106 and 75 μm were achieved.  Evaluating the benefits against the 
increased costs led to selection of a conservative grind size of P80 90 μm for the design and for 
further testwork.

Gold extractions after 24 hours using gravity concentration and conventional cyanidation averaged 
89% for the primary (excluding the low tonnage Vindaloo 2 ore), 93% for the transition and 95% for 
the saprolite ores.   

Testwork to investigate regrinding of the gravity concentrate was conducted on all primary 
composites.  The Vindaloo Main primary composite contained 46% free gold and 35% occluded 
gold in the 7% mass gravity concentrate.  The relationship between mass pull to gravity 
concentrate and contained gold was investigated and showed that greater than 70% of the gold 
was recovered to a 2% mass gravity concentrate.  Concentrate regrind and leaching testwork was 
completed at P80 25 μm, 15 μm and 10 μm with regrind improving gold extraction through liberation 
of occluded gold in the gravity concentrate.  The finest concentrate regrind of P80 10 μm prior to 
leaching achieved the largest increase in extraction with the overall gold extraction increased by up 
to 7%.  Separate leaching of the reground concentrate prior to combined leaching with the gravity 
tails is beneficial.  Cyanide levels of 0.2 % w/v in the concentrate leach and 0.035% w/v in the 
combined leach were utilised.  

High graphitic material from the western resource boundary that has potential for ore dilution was 
also tested.  This graphitic material appears to have no preg-robbing characteristics and can be 
treated by conventional cyanidation. 

Endeavour provided variability samples representative of the gold grades, lithologies and spatial 
distribution of the Houndé ore body.  Variability testwork on the individual samples was completed 
to determine the level of variability within the Houndé ores and included a gravity concentration 
step but excluded the concentrate regrind step.  While there is considerable variation in gold 
extraction throughout the ores, the variation for the same oxidation level within the same mining 
area is minor. 

Ancillary testwork for plant design was conducted and indicates that the slurry rheology will not 
impact on processing, conventional aeration in the CIL is suitable and typical carbon loadings are 
achievable.  Thickening testwork indicated that the primary ores will thicken with acceptable 
underflow densities.  Cyanide destruction testwork showed that the air / SO2 process can be 
successfully employed to treat the CIL tailings stream to achieve CNWAD concentrations of less than 
5 mg/L if required. 

13.3 Metallurgical Sampling 

The Houndé project consists of 4 deposit areas; Vindaloo, Vindaloo NE, Vindaloo 2 and Madras.  
Houndé ore mineralisation has been classified into three main types based on rock alteration and 
degree of weathering: 

� Saprolite for strongly oxidised material found near the topographic surface 

� Transition for weakly oxidised material, and 

� Primary for unoxidised material located beneath the zone of weathering.

Drill core samples for the detailed testwork programme were selected by Endeavour personnel on 
the following basis: 

� Representative of the Houndé ore types. 

� Spatial location across the orebody.  

� Obtaining samples with the expected range of gold head grades to determine the effect of 
head grade on overall gold extraction. 

The drill core was combined to provide 22 samples (4 saprolite, 3 transition and 15 primary 
samples).  Testwork was completed on the individual samples and on 5 primary composites made 
up from the 15 primary samples.  Drill hole locations are shown in Figure 13.3.1 and sample and 
composite details are shown in Table 13.3.1 and Table 13.3.2. 

The primary ores represent approximately 88% of the ore body with saprolite and transition ores 
making up the remaining 12%.  Primary ore from the Vindaloo pit makes up 80% of the primary 
ores (or 70% of the life of mine blend) and is the major component of the Houndé deposit.

13.4 Metallurgical Testing 

13.4.1 Head Analysis 

Full elemental analyses were conducted on the 22 individual samples and 5 primary composite 
samples.  The analyses are summarised in Table 13.4.1 and Table 13.4.2.  The duplicate gold 
assays varied significantly for some samples and indicate the presence of free gold or gold 
nuggets.  The mercury head grade was generally low; however, some Vindaloo primary samples 
assayed over 1 ppm Hg which is considered high.  Endeavour advised that this may be due to 
contamination from artisanal mining activities and that mercury levels will continue to be monitored.  
If mercury levels are found to be elevated, a suitable mercury capture system will be allowed for in 
the plant design.

13.4.2 Comminution Testwork 

Comminution testwork was conducted on the 15 individual primary samples to determine the 
variability of comminution parameters throughout the orebody and determine parameters for 
comminution circuit design.  The results from the SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) tests were 
interpreted and ranked by JKTech.  A single Bond ball work index test was completed on a 
composite of the 7 saprolite / transition samples.  SMC testwork was not completed on this sample 
as the ore was too soft.   

The comminution testwork results are summarised in Table 13.4.3.  The primary ores have 
average Bond rod and ball mill work indices indicating moderate grinding energy requirement and 
moderate abrasion indices.  The JK breakage parameters indicate the ores are highly competent 
and display a high resistance to impact breakage.   

The comminution results were utilised by Orway Mineral Consultants (OMC) for comminution circuit 
selection and mill sizing.  The OMC comminution report is available on request from Endeavour.

13.4.3 Variability Testwork 

Variability testwork was conducted on the 22 individual variability samples at the beginning of the 
testwork programme to determine the metallurgical performance of the Houndé ores and the 
variability within them.  All testwork was conducted at a grind size of P80 75 μm and included a 
gravity concentration step.  The results are summarised in Table 13.4.4 and Figure 13.4.1 to  
Figure 13.4.3.  There is considerable variation in gold extraction throughout the Vindaloo ores, 
although the variation for the same oxidation level within the same mining area is minor.

Overall 24 hour primary ore gold extractions varied between 57% and 92% with an average of 
85%.  The average gold extraction for Vindaloo 2 primary ores was significantly lower at 57% while 
the other primary ore were less variable (average 89%, range 83% to 95%).  The gold extraction 
for the 8 Vindaloo primary samples varied between 85% and 92% and averaged 89%.  

Overall 24 hour gold extraction for the saprolite ores averaged 95% with a range of 92% to 97%.  
The 4 saprolite samples showed minor variation in gold extraction despite originating from 
4 separate mining areas. 

Overall 24 hour gold extractions for the transition ores averaged 93% with a range of 89% to 95%.  
The 3 transition samples represented 2 mining areas with the 2 Vindaloo transition samples 
showing no variation in gold extraction. 

Diagnostic leach testwork was completed on the 2 Vindaloo 2 primary samples which achieved the 
lowest gold extractions.  The results are summarised in Table 13.4.5 and show that the samples 
had 22% to 35% of the gold occluded in sulphides and silicates and not readily amenable to 
cyanidation.

13.4.4 Gravity / Intensive Leach Testwork 

Testwork to determine the amount of gravity gold in the Houndé ores was completed on the 
individual samples as part of variability testwork and on the primary composites.  Batch gravity 
concentration and intensive leach of the gravity concentrate was carried out with results 
summarised in Table 13.4.6.

The gravity concentrate for all samples contained an average 60% of the gold in 6% mass.  The 
Vindaloo 2 samples (saprolite, transition and primary) had lower gold distributions in the gravity 
concentrate and the primary samples had poor concentrate intensive leach extractions (average 
24%).  The primary samples, excluding the Vindaloo 2 samples, had high gravity concentrate gold 
distributions (average 69%) with an average intensive leach extraction of 90%.  The saprolite and 
transition samples had high intensive leach extractions (average 99%).

13.4.5 Direct Cyanidation and Gravity / Cyanidation Testwork 

Direct cyanidation tests with and without gravity concentration were conducted on the 5 primary 
composites and on the 7 saprolite / transition samples to determine the effect of a gravity stage on 
gold extraction and leach kinetics.

The effect of gravity on gold extraction and extraction rates for Vindaloo primary, transition and 
saprolite ores is shown in Figure 13.4.4.  This effect was typical for the majority of samples and 
shows that inclusion of a gravity stage increased the leach kinetics but did not increase the overall 
24 hour gold extraction. 

All further testwork was completed using a gravity concentration stage based on the improved 
leach kinetics.

13.4.6 Grind / Extraction Testwork 

Grind / extraction tests were performed on the primary composites at grinds of P80 150 μm, 
125 μm, 106 μm and 75 μm to determine the effect of grind on gold extraction.  The gold extraction 
results for the gravity concentrate intensive leach and overall 24 and 48 hour leaches for all primary 
composites are summarised in Table 13.4.7 with results for the Vindaloo Main composite illustrated 
graphically in Figure 13.4.5.  The results typically indicate that lower residue grades and higher 
gravity leach and overall gold extractions are achieved with increasing fineness of grind; however, 
similar extractions were typically achieved typically for the P80 106 and 75 μm grinds.  Leaching 
kinetics also increased as the grind size decreased.

Note:  Overall leach results include gravity concentrate intensive leach and  combined leach
of gravity concentrate leach tails and gravity tails 

The average amount of gravity gold in each primary composite over the 4 grind sizes and the 
extraction of that gold by intensive leaching is summarised in Table 13.4.8.  Gold reporting to the 
gravity concentrate was highest in the Vindaloo Main primary composite (73%) and lowest in the 
Vindaloo NE2 primary composite (33%).  Extraction of that gravity concentrate gold by intensive 
leaching varied between 78% and 93% over the 5 composites indicating that some of the gold is 
locked in the gangue and could be liberated by further grinding prior to leaching. 

A test on the Vindaloo NE2 primary composite using lead nitrate addition as a leaching activator 
showed no improvement in gold extraction. 

Additional work to increase the recovery of occluded gold from the gravity concentrate was 
completed and is discussed in Section 13.4.8.

13.4.7 Grind Optimisation and Residence Time Analysis 

A grind optimisation and residence time analysis was completed to evaluate the effect of grind size 
and leach residence time on project economics.  The analysis compared gold revenue against 
operating and capital expenditure for the grind sizes considered and for 24 and 48 hour leach 
times.   

The analysis showed similar net revenues at grinds of P80 106 and 75 μm with the increase in gold 
revenue (recovery) at P80 75 μm offset by the increase in operating cost.  A conservative grind size 
of P80 90 μm was selected for the design and for further testwork.

Although gold leaching continued to occur through to 48 hours, the increased costs (leach reagents 
and CIL power and tankage) associated with the longer residence time were similar to the 
increased gold revenue.  A residence time of 24 hours was selected for the design and further 
testwork. 

13.4.8 Gravity Concentrate Retreatment 

The gravity concentrate intensive leach gold extractions for the primary samples and composites 
ranged from 16% to 96% with an average extraction of 85%.  Further testwork was conducted on 
the five primary composites to investigate the effect on gold extraction of regrinding the 7% mass 
gravity concentrate prior to leaching.  Gravity concentrate regrind sizes of P80 25 μm and 10 μm 
were tested with concentrate gold extractions increasing as the regrind size decreased.  The 
results are summarised in Table 13.4.9. 

Additional optimisation testwork was completed on a second Vindaloo Main primary composite 
(representing 70% of the Houndé ore) to investigate gravity concentrate treatment:   

The amount of free gold in the gravity concentrate was determined using mercury amalgamation.  
The gravity concentrate contained 46% free gold and 35% locked gold with the remaining 19% of 
gold in the gravity tails. 

The relationship between mass pull to gravity concentrate and contained gold was investigated 
with results presented in Figure 13.4.6.  For the Vindaloo Main primary composite, greater than 
70% of the gold was recovered to a 2% mass gravity concentrate.  A target mass pull of 2.5% to 
gravity concentrate was selected for the plant design based on the results of this testwork. 

Gravity concentrate regrind testwork was conducted at regrind sizes of P80 15 μm and 10 μm to 
confirm previous results and to determine whether a coarser regrind size was suitable.  This repeat 
testwork was completed at a lower gravity concentrate mass of 3.4% in line with the mass pull 
selected for the plant design.   

The primary composites showed a range of 24 hour overall gold extraction increases of 2% to 6% 
with a P80 10 μm regrind of the gravity concentrate prior to leaching (1% to 4% at a P80 25 μm 
regrind), based on a gravity concentrate mass pull of 6% to 7%.  This increase is due to the 
liberation of the finer gold particles locked within the coarser sulphide and silicate particles that are 
reporting to the gravity concentrate.  The repeat testwork on the Vindaloo Main primary composite 
confirmed the previous results (7% gold extraction increase to 95% overall gold extraction at 
P80 10 μm) at a lower 3.4% mass pull to gravity concentrate.  The P80 15 μm regrind achieved a 
lower 4% gold extraction increase. 

The additional testwork on the Vindaloo Main primary composite also investigated the effect of 
leaching cyanide levels, combined leaching of the reground gravity concentrate and the gravity tails 
(in comparison to the standard test of separate leaching of the reground gravity concentrate prior to 
a combined leach of the concentrate leach tails and the gravity tails) and oxygen sparging.

A higher cyanide concentration in the concentrate leach (1.0% w/v NaCN versus 0.2% w/v NaCN) 
increased the gold leaching rate but had no impact on the final 24 hour gold extraction.  Gold 
extraction was essentially complete in 2 hours at the higher cyanide concentration compared to 
4 to 8 hours at the lower cyanide level. 

A range of cyanide concentrations in the combined leach of the concentrate leach tails and the 
gravity tails was trialled (0.05%, 0.035% and 0.025% w/v NaCN) with equivalent 24 hour gold 
extractions achieved at all cyanide levels. 

The combined leach of the reground gravity concentrate and the gravity tails achieved a lower gold 
extraction (1%) at a lower overall cyanide addition and consumption than the separate concentrate 
leach tests. 

The use of oxygen in the combined leach increased the leach kinetics but had no impact on the 
final 24 hour gold extraction. 

The leaching reagent regimes and consumptions for the primary composites, including the 
concentrate regrind and separate leach stages, are summarised in Table 13.4.10.

13.4.9 Preg-Robbing Test 

Endeavour identified the presence of high graphitic material on the western resource boundary that 
has potential for ore dilution.  A preg-robbing test was carried out on a sample of the Vindaloo Main 
primary composite combined with 10% of the graphitic ore and indicated the graphitic material has 
no preg-robbing characteristics and could be treated by conventional cyanidation.   

13.4.10 Bulk Leach Testwork 

Bulk leach tests were completed on the Vindaloo Main primary composite to provide leached slurry 
samples for subsequent testwork.  All bulk leaches achieved similar gold extractions and reagents 
consumption to the lower mass tests. 

13.4.11 Ancillary Testwork 

Rheology 

Viscosity testwork was conducted over a range of slurry densities (40% to 65% w/w solids) on a 
Vindaloo Main primary composite and a saprolite / transition composite, each ground to P80 90 μm 
and adjusted to pH10.5.  The saprolite / transition composite is more viscous than the primary 
composite; however, the apparent viscosities for both composites are within acceptable limits at the 
CIL design conditions of 50% w/w solids and viscosity modification is not required.

Oxygen Uptake Test 

An oxygen uptake test was conducted on the Vindaloo Main primary composite to determine the 
change in the rate of oxygen consumption of the slurry.  The results were typically below 
0.05 mg/L/min, indicating that the ore has a moderate to low oxygen uptake rate and normal slurry 
aeration in plant practice should provide adequate dissolved oxygen concentrations in the leach 
solution for gold dissolution.  

Carbon Loading Kinetic and Equilibrium Carbon Loading Testwork 

A triple contact sequential carbon loading test and equilibrium carbon loading testwork were 
completed on samples prepared from bulk leaches of the Vindaloo Main primary composite with 
the results indicating that high carbon loadings are achievable.  The modelling of the adsorption 
circuit for the process plant has been based on typical design values. 

Thickening 

Thickening testwork was completed by Outotec on a slurry sample prepared from bulk leaches of 
the Vindaloo Main primary composite.  The testwork included flocculant screening, dynamic 
thickening and basic rheology tests.  The ore settled well under conventional high rate thickening 
conditions.

Outotec calculated a thickening flux rate of 1.2 t/m2.h with a high rate thickener achieving an 
underflow density of 58 to 61% w/w solids.  Outotec have indicated that densities 2 to 3% higher 
than those achieved in testwork should be achievable in a full scale thickener. 

Cyanide Destruction – Air / SO2 Process 

A series of batch cyanide destruction tests using the air / SO2 process were conducted on a 
Vindaloo Main primary composite bulk leach tails.  A range of reagent addition rates were trialled 
and showed that the air / SO2 process can be successfully employed to treat the CIL tailings 
stream to decrease weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNWAD) concentrations to less than 5 mg/L if 
required.  The CNWAD level in the test solution before commencement of tests was 150 mg/L and a 
batch residence time of 120 minutes (equivalent to 60 minutes in a plant continuous reactor) was 
sufficient to achieve acceptable tails CNWAD concentration.  The results are presented in           
Table 13.4.11.

Tailings

Sample for tailings testwork was prepared from the tailings from bulk leaches of the Vindaloo Main 
primary composite.  The tailings testwork evaluated the tailings settling characteristics and 
beaching properties and was completed by Knight Piésold.  Details and results of the tailings 
testwork are summarised in Section 18.6. 

13.4.12 Metallurgical Recoveries and Reagent Consumptions 

The average results of the metallurgical testwork programme on the individual samples and 
primary composites are summarised by weathering, mining area and rock type in Table 13.4.12. 

It is recommended that a constant recovery approach be assigned to each ore type group based 
on average testwork results.  The testwork gold extraction has been discounted to estimate the 
anticipated plant recovery.  This gives consideration to tailings soluble losses, potential for short 
circuiting in the leach circuit and other associated plant problems that may impact on the overall 
plant gold recovery.  A 0.010 mg/L soluble gold loss has been allowed which is equivalent to a solid 
loss of 0.011 g/t Au at the expected CIL tailings slurry density of 48% w/w solids.  The calculation 
of the anticipated Houndé Plant gold recoveries is summarised in Table 13.4.13.  

The reagent consumptions from the testwork have been used to anticipate the plant leach reagent 
consumptions.  Overall cyanide consumption was calculated based on the concentrate leach 
consumption at 0.2% w/v NaCN concentration and the average of the bottle roll leach testwork 
cyanide consumptions.  A CIL tails allowance of 100 mg/L NaCN has been allowed which is 
equivalent to an additional 0.11 kg/t NaCN at the expected CIL tailings slurry density of 48% w/w 
solids.  The average lime consumption in the testwork adjusted for the difference between 60% 
available lime used in the testwork and 90% available lime for the plant supply.  The average 
sodium hydroxide consumption in the concentrate leach testwork was used. 

The anticipated Houndé Plant gold recoveries and leach reagent consumptions are summarised in 
Table 13.4.14 and are based on: 

� Saprolite ores - whole ore leach (no gravity concentration or concentrate treatment). 

� Transition ores – gravity concentration and intensive leaching of concentrate and 
leaching of gravity tails.  

� Primary ores - gravity concentration (mass pulls as achieved in the testwork programme), 
concentrate regrind to P80 10μm, intensive leaching of the concentrate and leaching of 
gravity tails.

Recoveries and reagent consumptions have also been nominated for two ore types not included in 
the testwork programme, Vindaloo NE1 and Madras NW transition, and are summarised in      
Table 13.4.13 and Table 13.4.10.   Vindaloo NE1 ore has similar mineralogy and stratigraphic 
position to Vindaloo West and Vindaloo Mafic Volcanic and therefore a similar recovery and 
reagent consumption has been nominated.  The testwork gold extraction for Madras NW saprolite 
was higher than that achieved for Vindaloo Main saprolite so a recovery and reagent consumption 
similar to Vindaloo Main transition has been allocated to Madras NW transition.

13.4.13 Technical Risks and Opportunities 

A number of technical risk and opportunity areas have been identified during the testwork 
programme and subsequent process design. 

Gravity Concentration 

Two continuous centrifugal gravity concentrators have been selected in the plant design to recover 
a 2 to 3% mass gravity concentrate from the cyclone overflow stream.  A grade recovery 
relationship was established in the current test programme using a multiple pass approach on a 
batch basis. The relationship was very clear and indicates a mass pull of 2.5% would result in a 
gold recovery of approximately 75%. A conservative approach has been taken in sizing the gravity 
concentrators and subsequent fine grinding equipment. Additional testwork will provide an 
opportunity to further optimise these selections. In particular this may result in the inclusion of a 
small secondary concentrator operating in a cleaner mode, while reducing the fine grinding 
requirements with a smaller, higher grade concentrate. 

Gravity Concentrate Comminution 

Testwork to determine the gravity concentrate milling specific energy has not been completed due 
to time and sample limitations.  A conservative milling specific energy has been assumed for the 
purposes of the design.  If the specific energy requirement is less than the conservative estimate, 
there is opportunity to reduce the project capital and operating cost.  Alternatively a larger gravity 
concentrate mass could be collected with an opportunity for increased plant gold recoveries for 
some ores.  Fine grinding mill vendor testwork on a gravity concentrate sample to provide this data 
is likely to improve project economics. 

Plant Recoveries 

Plant recoveries for the transition ores do not include fine grinding of the gravity concentrate prior 
to leaching as this flowsheet was not trialled on the transition ores due to the typically high 
recoveries achieved without further grinding.  There is an opportunity that the plant recovery for the 
moderately oxidised transition ores will increase when processed with the selected flowsheet. 

The plant recoveries estimated for the minority Houndé primary ores (i.e. other than Vindaloo) have 
been based on higher mass pull gravity concentrates.  There is a risk that the recoveries may be 
reduced at the lower plant design gravity mass pulls, although this risk is minimised by the minor 
proportion that these ores constitute and the possibility that a higher concentrate mass pull may be 
able to be treated as a conservative concentrate milling specific energy has been selected. 

The plant recoveries have been estimated based on the leaching testwork 24 hour extractions.  
The plant CIL design allows for 36 hours leaching residence time and there is opportunity for higher 
plant gold recoveries than nominated.

Reagent Optimisation 

The concentrate leach cyanide consumption was based on a high leaching concentration of 
0.2% NaCN w/w (2000 ppm).  There is an opportunity to optimise the plant concentrate leach 
cyanide concentration, thereby reducing the overall cyanide consumption and operating cost.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

14.1 Introduction  

The updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Vindaloo deposits was completed by Cube in June 
2013.  This estimate represents an update of the Mineral Resources previously reported in the 
March 2013 PEA. 

The work was completed under the supervision of Mark Zammit BSc(Hons) GradCertGeostats 
GradDipBus MAIG. 

The aims of the June 2013 resource estimation were: 

� Update the gold mineralisation interpretation for the Vindaloo deposits; 

� Update the estimation of the gold grade within the Vindaloo deposits; and 

� Update the Mineral Resource classification. 

All estimation work was carried out using SURPAC mining software and Isatis geostatistical 
software.  Grade interpolation for gold has used Ordinary Block Kriging (OK) of downhole 
composite drill data. 

14.2 Previous Resource Estimate 

The previous Mineral Resource estimate for the Vindaloo deposits reported in the March 2013 PEA 
contained 1,456,000 oz. Au in the Indicted category and 752,000 oz. Au in the Inferred category.  
This Mineral Resource was reported inside an optimised pit shell and above a cut-off of 0.35 g/t Au.

Indicated Mineral Resource 23,708,000 1.91 1,456,000 
Inferred Mineral Resource 12,210,000 1.91 752,000 

14.3 Data Supplied 

Data supplied to Cube by Endeavour included: 

� Drill hole data in the form of Microsoft Excel and Access files; 

� Lithological interpretation solid (.dxf) files; 

� Mineralisation domaining as cross-sectional (Adobe pdf) and solid interpretation (.dxf) 
files;

14.4 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

14.4.1 Lithology 

The local lithological interpretation was provided by Endeavour geological staff based on geological 
logging and validated by Cube.  The interpretation polylines were based mainly on 25 m spaced 
sections and included some 50 m spaced sections at the northern end of the project area.  The 
polylines were snapped to drilling in most instances and creation of valid 3 dimensional solids 
(3DM's) was not possible.  Cube modified the interpretation by removing the snapped interpretation 
in the majority of instances by translating the polyline interpretation points onto section lines.  This 
method honours the initial Endeavour interpretation but also enabled the creation of valid 3DM's.  
The final lithology 3DM's were used for direct assignment of lithology into the block model.  The 
lithological interpretation, 3DM files and block model assignment is summarised in Table 14.4.1.

14.4.2 Weathering Domains 

The weathering interpretation was provided by Endeavour geological staff based on geological 
logging, reviewed on site by Cube and accepted by Cube.  One file was provided that included 3 
surfaces to represent the overburden, saprolite, transition and fresh weathering domains.  Cube 
split the single file containing the 3 surfaces into 3 individual files and expanded the perimeter of 
each to cover the block model area. 

The final weathering interpretation files and method for block model assignment is summarised in 
Table 14.4.2.

14.4.3 Mineralisation Domains 

The initial mineralisation domains were provided to Cube by Endeavour geological staff and 
subsequently modified by Cube in order to complete the mineral resource estimate.  The 
interpretations were completed on 25 m spaced sections south of 1262950N and 50 m spaced 
sections north of 1262950N.  The interpretations were based on local geological knowledge and 
typically were focussed on grades greater than 0.5 g/t Au. 

Cube modified the interpretations mainly by allowing the interpretation to include mineralisation 
greater than 0.3 g/t Au rather than 0.5 g/t Au.  This cut-off grade change resulted in a more robust 
interpretation with better domain continuity down dip and along strike, with some lower grade 
material being included as internal dilution to preserve overall continuity of the mineralised zones.  
The original Endeavour interpretation for the mineralisation was therefore based on grade and 
geological continuity within or parallel to steeply dipping gabbro intrusions.  The interpretation 
updated by Cube was an attempt to encompass a greater part of the mineralised distribution and 
produce a model that reduces the risk of conditional bias that could be introduced where the 
constraining interpretation and data selection is based on a significantly higher grade than the 
natural geological lower cut-off.  The revised interpretation was reviewed by Endeavour with a goal 
of keeping the focus on modelling mineralisation that has a better chance of being economic.  The 
final modification to the interpretation was the inclusion of some minor flatter west dipping domains 
that are likely to represent linking structures. 

Cube completed a boundary analysis for the larger domains and graphs for domains 2 and 17 are 
shown in Figure 14.4.1 and Figure 14.4.2 respectively.  Both graphs clearly show an abrupt grade 
change at the interpreted boundary position (position 0 on the horizontal axis) with average grades 
inside the domain boundary significantly higher than the average grades outside.  This suggests 
the absence of any obvious diffuse grade boundary and confirms the interpreted boundary position 
as appropriate.

On each section, the interpreted polylines were snapped to the drill hole sample positions.  A 
minimum down-hole length of 1 m was used with the interpreted domains rarely less than 2 m 
down-hole.  For each section the interpretation was not typically extended more than 50 m along 
strike or down-dip past the last drill hole.  However, sectional interpretations were extended further 
than 50 m on some sections in some sparsely sampled areas of the better defined and continuous 
domains. 

The final interpretation that included 39 domains was reviewed by Endeavour geological staff.  The 
39 domains which collectively make up Vindaloo deposits have been grouped into 4 main areas 
which include Vindaloo Main, Vindaloo North-East, Vindaloo 2 and Madras North-West and are 
summarised below in Table 14.4.3.

14.4.4 Bulk Density 

All available bulk density data was supplied to Cube by Endeavour and included a total of 2,785 
determinations.  Cube reviewed the determinations and methodology used for specific gravity.  The 
determinations that were deemed acceptable were limited to measurements undertaken on 
diamond drill core which had been wax coated and measured using a standard water displacement 
method.  This resulted in a total of 2,241 determinations available for inclusion in the resource 
estimation.  The remaining 544 density determinations were measured by pychnometer or by 
unknown means and not considered appropriate or reliable and therefore excluded from the final 
data set.  The determinations that were accepted were imported into the database 
"HoundeUpdate_20130507.mdb" and an additional field called "use_in_resource" was created.  
The determinations deemed by Cube as appropriate for use in the resource were flagged as "Y".

All of the bulk density determinations suitable for resource estimation were exported from the 
database.  They were grouped according to the logged lithology type and oxidation state to form 
the basis for assignment of in-situ bulk density to the Vindaloo deposits.  Table 14.4.4 summarises 
the mean of the density determinations by weathering and lithology.  The number of determinations 
for each lithology is shown in brackets.

Table 14.4.5 summarises the values used to assign bulk densities to the block model based on 
"weathering" and "lithology".  For the overburden and saprolite, the mean density values have been 
discounted slightly to allow for sampling bias often encountered in determination data populations 
for more friable and unconsolidated material.

14.5 Compositing  

In the drill hole database, a unique code for drill intercepts within each of the mineralised domains 
was added to the database table called ZONECODE.  The process of coding the database was 
carried out by manually identifying the appropriate down hole interval to be coded and assigning a 
unique code according to the enclosing domain wireframe.  This coded interval was used to control 
the compositing process. 

Assay sample lengths varied from 0.19 metres to 9.00 metres with the mean length of 1.06 metres 
and median of 1.00 metre.  To ensure equal sample support, Cube decided that 1 metre downhole 
composites were appropriate for all compositing within the mineralised domains.  The downhole 
compositing process used a 'best fit' approach which results in composites of slightly variable 
length but of equal length within a contiguous drill hole intersection, ensuring the composite length 
is as close as possible to the nominated 1 metre composite length.

Variography has been used to analyse the spatial continuity within the mineralised zones and to 
determine appropriate estimation inputs to the interpolation process.  The variogram modelling 
process followed by Cube involves the following steps: 

� Calculate and model the omni-directional or down hole variogram to characterise the 
Nugget Effect;

� Systematically calculate orientated variograms in 3 dimensions to identify the plane of 
greatest continuity; and  

� Calculate a fan of variograms within the plane of greatest continuity to identify the 
direction of maximum continuity within the plane.  Model the variogram in the direction of 
maximum continuity and the orthogonal directions. 

Variography was undertaken on Gaussian transformed 1 metre down hole high cut composite data.  
The Gaussian transformation was modelled in Isatis on the declustered 1 m composite data.  The 
Gaussian variogram model was back transformed and modelled to obtain the appropriate 
variogram model for interpolation of raw composite data. 

Variogram parameters were derived for the two most sampled mineralisation domains (2 and 17) 
within project area.  Variogram modelling for the more sparsely sampled domains was difficult and 
not considered appropriate for use as the number of composite samples was limited.  The 
modelled variograms for domains 2 and 17 showed very similar characteristics and therefore Cube 
decided to adopt the variogram parameters for domain 2 to all other mineralised domains within the 
project area.  Where variogram parameters have been adopted to adjacent mineralised domains, 
directions and anisotropy ratios have been modified to best suit the geometry of the domain under 
consideration.  Cube believes that this is a reasonable approach and open to update when the 
drilling density is sufficient for robust individual variogram parameters to be established.   

Variogram relative nugget effects were typically in the range of 50 - 60% indicating a moderate to 
high degree of short scale variability as would be expected in gold deposits.  Variogram ranges 
were typically in the order of 50 - 60 metres indicating maximum spatial continuity is greater than 
the average drill hole spacing. 

No plunge component was evident during the variogram modelling process. 

Table 14.6.4 below summarises the raw variogram parameters and Table 14.6.5 summarises the 
relative variogram parameters used in the mineral resource estimation.  Figure 14.6.7 and

14.7 Evaluation of Outliers 

Cube reviewed the statistics of the composites to check for outlier composite grades prior to 
estimation.  The composite data was reviewed using histograms, log-histograms, log-probability 
plots, high grade sensitivity analysis and graphical inspection of the spatial grade distribution.  The 
composite data was reviewed for each individual domain and by weathering.  The results showed 
that there was no requirement to separate the composite assay population treatment by weathering 
and a top cut of 40 g/t Au was determined to be appropriate for the total composite population.  Log 
probability and histogram plots for the combined 1m composites are shown in Figure 14.7.1 and 
Figure 14.7.2 and separated by weathering in Figure 14.7.3. 

Basic statistics for the cut gold composites were calculated for each of the 39 domains.  The basic 
statistics for each domain is shown below in Table 14.7.1 to Table 14.7.3.  Included in the summary 
statistics for the top cut composites is the declustered mean based on a 50(N) x 10(X) x 50(Z) cell 
size.

14.8 Block Model Set Up  

A number of criteria were considered when setting up the block model.  Given the overall trend of 
mineralisation is striking toward 0310, it was decided a rotated block model oriented parallel to the 
strike direction would be most appropriate.  Data spacing was a primary consideration taken into 
account when selecting the appropriate estimation block size.  The drill hole spacing within the 
mineralised zones was reasonably regular and dominated by drilling on 25 m and 50 m spaced 
sections with 25 m and 50 m spaced holes on section.  Cube considers it good geostatistical 
practice to use an estimation parent cell size that approaches the data spacing where possible, 
while at the same time being mindful of potential mine design and selectivity implications.  Cube 
reviewed the 'physical' data spacing relative to the mineralised zones to be estimated when 
deciding on the appropriate estimation block size.  Cube decided that an estimation parent block 
size smaller than 10m(Y) x 5m(X) x 10m(Z) would result in excessive smoothing of the estimate 
which is symptomatic of extreme conditional bias.  A smaller block size would result in increased 
kriging variance and potentially reduce the quality of the mineral resource estimation.  Sub-blocking 
to 2.5m(Y) x 1.25m(X) x 2.5m(Z), has been used to improve the volume representation of the block 
model.

Two 3D block models were created using Surpac 6.3 software.  The first was used for grade 
estimation with the model architecture described above and summarised in Table 14.8.1.  The 
second and final block model was created with a smaller parent cell in the "Z" direction. This 
resulted in a smaller model file size that was easier to manipulate.  The grade estimate was 
exported from the initial estimation model and imported into the final model called 
"hounde_june2013.mdl" which summarised in Table 14.8.2.  The block model attributes and 
descriptions are summarised in Table 14.8.3.

14.9 Block Model Grade Estimation 

Grade interpolation was carried out using Ordinary Kriging (OK) for each mineralised domain using 
the uniquely coded 1 metre down hole composite data specific to that domain.  All block estimates 
were based on grade interpolation into parent cells of 10m(Y) x 5m(X) x 10m(Z).  Block 
discretisation points were set to 4(Y) x 2(X) x 2(Z).

Cube has attempted to characterise the spatial relationship of the data using variography and has 
sought to implement search strategies aimed at producing a robust block estimate whilst at the 
same time minimising estimation error and conditional biases.  Cube routinely tests several search 
iterations before determining the most appropriate search strategy.  Fundamental to the search 
strategy is the determination of appropriate minimum and maximum numbers of composites for 
estimation.  The minimum number of composites has been considered by Cube as a key 
component of the criteria applied in determining the appropriate resource classification. 

Cube initially bases search distances for the first search iteration on the analysis of the theoretical 
kriging weight charts.  An examination of these kriging weight charts provides a good starting point 
for testing a search strategy as they provide a guide as to the distribution of kriging weights for a 
given variogram with respect to distance along the major axis of the search volume.  Of particular 
interest is the approximate distance that kriging weights tend towards zero.  Cube believes that it 
good estimation practice to use a search distance that ensures that kriging weights allocated to 
composites tend toward zero or slightly negative on the periphery of the search.   

Cube generally extends the search where there are large positive weights at the periphery and 
reduces the search where there are a large proportion of negative kriging weights involved.  A 
limitation of these charts is that they are based on an assumption that each block is directly 
informed by a composite at the block centroid and they will, therefore generally understate the 
required search with respect to actual data spacing to achieve a robust block estimate.  

A Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) was undertaken to assist in optimising the 
search parameters. 

The procedure for search optimisation adopted by Cube involves selecting several individual blocks 
representing data configurations ranging from poorly to well informed.  The aim of these tests is to 
optimise the kriging search neighbourhood and maximise the quality of the kriging when dealing 
with a non-exhaustive data set.  A number of key criteria were captured for each selected block as 
follows: 

� Block coordinates and dimensions; 

� Estimated grade; 

� Kriging variance; 

� Block Dispersion variance; 

� Slope of Regression of estimated blocks z*(v) and theoretical true blocks z(v);

including coordinates, grades, distance from block and kriging weight; and 

� Statistics of the informing composites including number of composites, minimum, 
maximum, mean, standard deviation, variance and coefficient of variation. 

An important feature of Ordinary Kriging is its inherent property to minimise estimation error.  The 
estimation error will increase substantially as the amount of informing data decreases.   

Based on the QKNA and visual analysis of the samples selected under OK, appropriate search 
parameters were chosen and are detailed below in Table 14.9.1.  Search ellipse orientations for 
each domain interpolation were orientated to follow the direction of the mineralised domain.  A two 
pass search strategy was used for grade estimation.  The first pass search used a search radius of 
75 m and this was doubled for the second search pass to 150 m.  The same minimum (6) and 
maximum (40) number of samples were used for both search passes.  Appendix 14.1 tabulates the 
complete estimation parameters used for each domain. 

14.9.1 Treatment for Un-estimated Blocks 

A small proportion of blocks for Domain 18 only did not satisfy the minimum criteria for grade 
estimation.  The volume of these blocks represented 3.3% of that domain and less than 0.1% of the 
total volume.  These blocks remained un-estimated and not included with the Mineral Resource.

14.10 Model Validation 

Modelled estimates within the domains have been compared with the down hole composite grades 
in a number of ways.  Initially a visual validation was undertaken on screen comparing the block 
estimates with the composite data in cross section.  The estimates honoured the composite data 
well with some degree of grade smoothing of the block estimates as would be expected from 
Ordinary Kriging. 

The mean block estimate for each domain was also compared to the mean composite grade of the 
corresponding domain (Table 14.10.1).  Although these two parameters are not strictly comparable 
due to data clustering and volume influences, they do provide a useful validation tool in detecting 
any major biases and allow the comparison between input composite grade and the estimated 
block grade.  The global comparisons for gold indicate good agreement between composites and 
estimates throughout the majority of the project.  Locally areas of deviation occur but these are 
generally the result of data clustering.

Swath plots (grade trend profiles) showing the estimated tonnes, estimated grade, number of 
composites and mean cut composite grade (tabulated by northing and RL) were created for the 
largest 20 interpolated mineralisation domains (Appendix 14.2).  The limitations of this comparison 
should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions; however there is generally good agreement 
between the block estimate and declustered composite mean for all domains.  As expected, the 
estimated grade is more smoothed compared to the often variable composite mean grades.    
Figure 14.10.1 shows a swath plot for Domain 2 by 100 m northing intervals.  The grade estimate 
appears to be lower compared to the composite means for the volume between 1261150N and 
12611850N which corresponds with the largest tonnage proportions for that domain.  The 
difference is explained by comparing 25 m RL interval data in a swath plot between 1261150N and 
12611850N.  The corresponding swath plot is displayed below in Figure 14.10.2 which shows a 
very close correlation between composite and estimate mean grades.  Clustered high grade 
samples above 250 m RL are responsible for the discrepancy when comparing by northing.

Figure 14.10.2 Block Model Validation between 1261150N and 12611850N by RL for 
Domain 2 

A final validation involved a comparison of the OK estimate for both cut and uncut Au against two 
other estimation techniques being Inverse Distance Cubed (IDW3) and Nearest Neighbour (NN).  
Above a zero g/t Au cut-off, there is very good agreement between the three estimation techniques 
for both cut and uncut Au and this is summarised in Table 14.10.2.

14.11 Mineral Resource Classification 

It is Cube's opinion that the Vindaloo mineralisation is sufficiently drilled to allow classification in 
accordance with the CIM guidelines (CIM 2005).  As with any non-rigidly defined classification 
there will always be some blocks within categories that depart from defined criteria.  It is Cube's 
view that the final outcome must reflect a practical combination of geological knowledge and 
estimation quality parameters that may be more numerical in nature.  This approach to 
classification aims to avoid creating a complex numerically based 'mosaic'. Cube has considered 
all criteria and has classified the resource accordingly.  The classification supports the 
recommendations made in the PEA March 2013 which states "nominal 50 m x 50 m drill spacing 
for Indicated Mineral Resources and approximately 25 m x 25 m spacing for Measured Mineral 
Resource". 

The primary criterion for Measured Mineral Resources is defined by a drill spacing of at least 25 m 
x 25 m.  In addition, Measured Mineral Resources were confined to the largest interpreted 
mineralisation domains that had the least amount of risk associated with geological interpretation 
and continuity.  The only domains to include Measured Mineral Resources are 2, 3, 15, 17, 18 and 
19.

A basic Conditional Simulation study was undertaken to provide supporting evidence for 
classification of the Measured Mineral Resources.  Domain 2 was chosen for the study as it 
represents the largest and most continuous mineralised domain at Vindaloo.  The results 
suggested that on a mining production quarterly basis the grade variance was within ±10% at a 
90% confidence limit. 

Indicated Mineral Resources are defined as areas outside the Measured Mineral Resource and 
defined by 50 m x 50 m drill spacing.  As mentioned in Section 14.9, a 2 pass search strategy was 
used for grade estimation and the Indicated Mineral Resource is confined to blocks estimated 
within the first pass search. 

Inferred Mineral Resources include all remaining estimated mineralisation defined either by a drill 
spacing greater than 50 m x 50 m or estimated within the second pass search . 

14.12 Mineral Resource Statement  

For the purpose of public reporting, the Vindaloo Mineral Resource is reported inside an optimised 
pit shell.  Reporting within an optimised pit shell satisfies the requirement for the Mineral Resource 
to have reasonable prospects for future economic extraction.  The pit optimisation was undertaken 
by Orelogy and assumed a US$1,600/oz Au price and an average mining cost of US$2.107/tonne; 
note that Orelogy estimated a higher mining cost per tonne than estimated in the PEA, resulting in 
the development of a shallower optimized open pit than was envisioned in the PEA. Table 14.12.1 
to Table 14.12.3 summarise the economic parameters used.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Mining and Mineral Reserves Estimation Approach 

Following the completion of the Preliminary Economic Assessment in March 2013 and subsequent 
studies and testwork, the Houndé open pit gold project development is proposed with: 

� Construction of a new nominal 3.0 Mtpa process plant. 

� Conventional mining methods utilising drilling, blasting, trucks and shovels. 

� A general site layout as highlighted in Figure 15.1.1.  

Figure 15.1.1 Houndé Gold Project – Site Layout

This section of the report includes discussion on the open pit optimization and practical pit design.  
The mineral reserves and the results of the mine design process are presented.  Other items such 
as the scheduling process and equipment considerations are presented in the following section 
"Mining Methods" (Section 16) and mining cost estimates are included in the "Capital and 
Operating Costs" (Section 21). 

The mine planning process for the reserve estimation comprised the following components: 

� Whittle-4X pit optimisation software was used to identify the optimum pit shell in terms of 
value and tonnage using the parameters outlined below in this section. 

� MineSight general mine planning software was used to develop practical stage designs to 
access the orebody. 

� EVORELUTION scheduling software was used to develop strategic level schedules to 
determine a practical starting sequence that maximised net present value (NPV).  This 
was then used as a guide to the subsequent detailed life-of-mine (LOM) schedule. 

� Mining costs for the project, to be incorporated in the project financial cash flow model, 
were estimated based on the final design and associated LOM schedule. 

The mining components of the study are based on the geological Mineral Resource block model 
generated by Cube Consulting Pty Ltd which encompasses the Vindaloo and Madras deposits.  
Mineral Reserves have been modified from Mineral Resources by taking into account geological, 
geotechnical, mining, processing, economic parameters and permitting requirements and therefore 
are classified in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserve Committee (JORC) 2012 standards and/or 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

15.2 Pit Optimisation Key Assumptions / Basis of Estimate 

Mineral Reserves for Vindaloo and Madras are supported by a LOM plan, which was developed 
using the following information and key parameters in the pit optimisation process. 

15.2.1 Resource Model 

The resource model is an Ordinary Kriged (OK) model developed by Cube Consulting and has a 
total of 39.6 Mt at 1.91 g/t Au at a 0 g/t Au cut-off grade.  Over 87% of the resource is classified as 
Measured or Indicated with the remaining 13% classified as Inferred.  Earlier sections of this report 
provide more background and detail on this resource estimate. 

Throughout the mine planning process, only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are 
eligible to qualify as ore, all other mineralization, including Inferred Mineral Resources, have been 
classified as waste.

15.2.2 Geotechnical Considerations 

Overall slopes were derived from the inter-ramp angles recommended by Peter O'Bryan and 
Associates, independent geotechnical consultants commissioned by Knight Piésold.  These inter-
ramp angles, and the associated wall design criteria, are detailed in Table 15.2.1. 

ORELOGY utilised these parameters to develop the overall slopes for the optimisation.  A first pass 
optimisation and design was undertaken to fully evaluate the combined effects of ramps, stack 
berms and shear zone double berms.  The final wall slopes were developed for five areas of the 
deposit. The final slopes used are detailed in Table 15.2.2 and the associated areas shown in 
Figure 15.2.1.

15.2.3 Ore Loss and Dilution 

The approach to determine ore loss and dilution is based on the following deposit characteristics 
and mining practices: 

� The sub-vertical nature of the mineralised zones. 

� The ability to visually distinguish between mineralised and barren materials when defining 
and subsequently excavating the ore / waste boundaries. 

� Adherence to the correct blasting free face orientation, perpendicular to the strike of the 
mineralisation. 

� Adoption of 5 metre high benches, with the option to excavate 2½ metre high flitches if 
required.

Due to these control mechanisms ORELOGY estimates that the amount of mixing at ore waste 
boundaries should be limited to a 1 m wide zone only.  This approach has been applied to the 
Resource Model to produce a Diluted Mining Model incorporating dilution and ore losses.  This 
results in average values for dilution and ore loss within the Measured / Indicated orebody of 6.5% 
and 5.2% respectively. 

The resulting model incorporating dilution and ore loss is referred to as the Mining Model, as 
opposed to the Resource Model. 

15.2.4 Optimisation Mining Costs 

Table 15.2.3 details the general material properties used in the development of the first principle 
mining costs.  The densities were obtained from the resource model default settings, the moisture 
contents were adopted in consultation with Endeavour and the swell factors are engineering 
estimates based on ORELOGY experience.  The swell factors were used for calculating equipment 
capacity limits.

Loose Wet Density (wmt/lcm) 1.65 1.68 1.92 2.12 

 

The fleet that was used for developing the optimisation mining costs was based around a 
Caterpillar 785 140 tonne truck matched to a Caterpillar 6040 390 tonne excavator.  This 
equipment was selected on the basis that these machines are:  

� Fit for purpose (i.e. capable of mining both the 5 metre bench height and the 2½ metre 
flitch height. 

� Able to deliver the dilution and ore loss outcomes in accordance with the modelling 
described above without any significant loss of productivity assumptions. 

It is acknowledged that the Caterpillar 6040 is, in reality, a larger machine than would be suitable.  
At the cost estimation phase of the study this unit was replaced with a smaller 6030 290 tonne unit.  
The net result of this selection was actually a reduction in loading costs as the 6040 had been 
de-rated to match the 140 tonne trucks (refer to the shovel productivity calculations detailed in 
Table 15.2.4).  Consequently the optimisation costs can be considered conservative.

For the purposes of generating a realistic LOM mining cost, haulage costs were developed within 
the block model and flagged into a number of different zones as highlighted in Figure 15.2.2 for the 
application of the loading and hauling costs.  Regressions were then developed and used to code 
the block model with these costs on a bench by bench as well as pit by pit basis.

Drill and blast costs were developed from first principles.  The key underlying assumptions are: 

� 2 x 5 metre high bench height to give a total bench height of 10 metres for drill and blast 
purposes. 

� Powder factors for the different material types are ORELOGY engineering estimates. 

� Drill penetration rates are ORELOGY engineering estimates incorporating Endeavour 
actual drilling rate feedback. 

Bench height and powder factors drive the drilling and blasting design parameters such as burden 
and spacing.  The drill penetration rate together with the burden, spacing and bench height yield 
the drilling productivity.  This is summarised in Table 15.2.5.

The other key assumptions are: 

� Any hard, lateritic overburden or "caprock" does not require blasting and can be "ripped" 
by a dozer if required.  

� 80% of saprolitic clays will not require blasting and can be mined by "free digging".  

Table 15.2.6 below shows the resulting production drill and blast costs developed from first 
principle calculations.  Note that the pre-splitting cost has only been applied to the fresh waste.

It has been assumed 0.3 metres of topsoil covers the entire site.  All pit, waste storage facility 
(WSF), haul road and infrastructure areas will require clearing of vegetation and stripping of topsoil.  
The topsoil requires storage and subsequent rehandle for rehabilitation of all disturbed areas.  In 
reality there will probably be little, if any, revegetation of the pits.  However some costs will be 
incurred to leave the site in a safe state when operations cease and the pits are abandoned.  The 
material stripped from the pits will most likely be utilised in the final WSF landforms.

For the purposes of the optimisation cost estimate, it was assumed ore grade control would be 
carried out using reverse-circulation (RC) drilling in advance of mining.  It was based on a drill 
pattern of 25 m x 25 m and the waste was drilled at the ratio of 1 tonne of waste per tonne of ore 
drilled.  Hole inclination was 50° over 4 x 5 m benches (i.e. 20 m vertically giving a 32 m hole 
length).  An inclusive contract drilling rate of $45/m drilled was assumed and that sampling was 
carried out every two metres.  A $/t cost as detailed in Table 15.2.9 was then generated.

It has been assumed that 80% of the ore mined will be direct tipped to the crusher.  The other 20% 
will be stockpiled on the RoM pad at the primary crusher and require rehandling with a loader.  
Productivity and costs are detailed in Table 15.2.10 on the basis of a Caterpillar 992K FEL 
tramming an average of 100 m one way.

All Endeavour fixed costs are summarised in Table 15.2.11. 

Table 15.2.11 Annual Fixed Costs and Overheads 

Item Cost $/y 

Personnel $3,690,000 
Explosives Supply Contract $612,000 
Geotechnical Drilling And Evaluation Activities $100,000 
Support Equipment $1,335,000 
Workshop $300,000 
Admin Overheads $184,500 

Total $6,221,500 

 

All Endeavour variable personnel costs (i.e. operators and maintenance personnel) are allocated 
as part of the hourly cost of operating the equipment. 

All costs outlined above were allocated to the mining block model.  To provide a sense of the 
magnitude of the ore and waste mining costs for fresh, transition, saprolite and overburden 
materials Figure 15.2.3 and Figure 15.2.4 show the weighted average across all pits varying with 
RL.  

In general as the pit depth increases, mining costs rise because of longer haulage distances and 
higher drill and blasting costs associated with fresh rock below the transition and saprolite 
materials. 

The ore mining costs are higher than the waste mining costs because: 

� Drilling and blasting costs of ore are higher (Table 15.2.6). 

� Grade control costs (Table 15.2.9) are allocated to ore only. 

� Only ore attracts rehandling costs (Table 15.2.10). 

� Fixed costs (Table 15.2.11) are allocated to ore.

Also provided by Endeavour and Lycopodium were the processing recoveries for 39 separate 
mineralisation zones.  These recovery values are shown in Table 15.2.13.  The zones and their 
recoveries values were allocated to the mining block model. 

15.2.6 Gold Price 

The financial parameters and their values used in optimisation process were determined in 
consultation with Endeavour; they are summarised in Table 15.2.14.  The parameter values are the 
same as those adopted in the PEA. 

Table 15.2.14 Gold Price and Royalties Assumptions 

Item Unit Value 

Base Case Gold price US$/oz. 1,300 
Payable metal %/oz. 99.95% 
Refining and transport $/oz. 3.35 
Royalties of NSR to government of BF % 4.0% 
Royalties of NSR to Barrick % 2.0% 
Net Price US$/oz. 1218.24 

 

As advised by Endeavour, a discount rate of 5% has been used in this study.  This is in line with 
the discount rate used in the PEA study.  

15.3 Pit Optimization Results 

15.3.1 Whittle Results and Shell Selection 

The results of the optimisation are detailed in Table 15.3.1 and Figure 15.3.1.  The "Maximum Best 
Discounted Cashflow", "Maximum Worst Discounted Cashflow" and "Maximum Average 
Discounted Cashflow" cases are highlighted as follows: 

Maximum Best Case Cashflow   

Maximum Worst Case Cashflow   

Maximum Average Case Cashflow   

 

The Revenue Factor 1 shell is Shell 36, which represents shell with the maximum undiscounted 
cashflow and also the Maximum Best Case DCF.

Shell 30 was selected for subsequent pit designs and scheduling as it provided an acceptable 
balance between minelife and costs in line with Endeavour's objectives to establish a profitable, 
low cost, operation.  A longer minelife provides for more revenue but it also results in higher 
stripping ratios and hence higher costs, and vice versa.  The cashflow of Shell 30 at $900M is 0.5% 
lower than that of Shell 36, the shell with the highest cashflow, while the mining and processing 
costs at $882.7M are 7.1% lower.  

Shell 30, having a revenue factor of 0.88, provides for a minelife of 8.3 years, including pre-strip, 
and a stripping ratio of 8.5.  The inventory of Shell 30 is summarised in Table 15.3.2.

15.3.2 Optimisation Sensitivity 

A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the project to changes in the 
optimisation inputs.  The figures below display the % variation in a number of Key Sensitivity 
Outputs (KSOs) for a variation in an Optimisation Input Parameter (OIP).  The Ore Tonnage KSO 
sensitivity shown in Figure 15.3.2 indicates the robustness of the shell, and hence the pit design.  
The sensitivity of the Project Discounted Cashflow KSO is highlighted in Figure 15.3.2.  It shows 
sensitivity to both wall slope angle and grade, and a high sensitivity to gold price.  This is not an 
uncommon result for an open pit gold project as gold price and grade directly affect revenue.

Ore tonnes sensitivity: 

� The project is highly sensitive to a reduction in price but only slightly sensitive to an 
increase in price.  This indicates that the pit shell and therefore associated pit design will 
not increase significantly should price increase and that the ultimate pit extent will be 
relatively robust. 

� Variations in grade and process recovery are effectively equivalent.  As with price, the 
shell is more sensitive to reductions in grade / recovery than increases. 

� The shell is insensitive to variations in processing cost, slightly sensitive to variations in 
mining cost, and sensitive to variations in the combined costs. 

� It is sensitive to variations in slope angles. 

� A sensitivity analysis was also run on applying a global 15% dilution and 0% ore loss.  As 
expected, this indicated that ore tonnes were sensitive to this parameter combination, 
and therefore dilution should be accepted in order to minimise ore loss.  

Cashflow sensitivity: 

� The project value is highly sensitive to parameters that directly affect revenue (i.e. price / 
grade / recovery). 

� Project value shows the same sensitivity to the other parameters as the ore tonnes 
displays. 

� The 15% dilution / 0% ore loss sensitivity has a marginal positive impact on DCF. 

� Overall this indicates the Houndé Project is sensitive to optimisation parameters, with 
price / grade / recovery being the main major sensitivities. 

15.3.3 Risk Management 

As with most gold projects, the Houndé Project is most sensitive to those parameters that directly 
affect revenue, in particular, the gold price, processing recovery and the grade of the ore.  
Therefore any practices that can result in fixing these parameters at a feasible level (e.g. gold 
hedging) should be investigated to determine if, where necessary, project risk can be reduced.  

There will be a degree of flexibility built into both the pit designs and schedules based around Shell 
30 to mitigate against any future variations in economic parameters.  For example: 

� The main Vindaloo pit will be developed as smaller, interim stage designs that focus on 
the high value ends of the pits.  This will defer the establishment of the more sensitive 
areas of final pit wall so that economic parameters can be re-assessed and the final wall 
adjusted if necessary.

� The small northern pits are relatively marginal and generate little significant value.  
Therefore they will be scheduled late in the mine life such that they can be "dropped off" 
should conditions deteriorate or more attractive deposits be identified. 

The sensitivity study results also indicate that while there are the usual cashflow benefits 
associated with decreasing costs, the project is more susceptible to the adverse effects of 
increasing costs than any benefit of equivalent cost reductions.  Therefore robust cost estimation 
and rigorous operating practices are required in order to maintain an on-going cost regime driving 
low cost outcomes. 

15.4 Mine Design Process 

Pits were designed using MineSight mine planning software, and utilised the MiningModel, the pit 
optimisation results (Shell 30) and application of the pit design criteria outlined in Sections 15.5.1 
as guides.  The results of the pit design process were then exported to EVORELUTION, the 
ORELOGY proprietary mine scheduling software, for scheduling and reporting of the mineral 
reserves. 

Global "waste storage shells" were developed in MineSight at the waste storage facility locations 
shown in Figure 15.1 1.  A waste storage shell is a space to which waste may be allocated in the 
mine scheduling process, and is designed in accordance with waste storage facility design criteria 
provided in Section 15.7.  These shells were then also exported to EVORELUTION where they are 
used to develop a waste storage facility model.  Determination of the waste haulage is calculated 
on the basis of minimising haulage costs as each block is mined from the pit and then "placed" 
within the waste storage model.  Hence the final waste storage facility geometry is optimised by the 
EVORELUTION scheduling software, while remaining faithful to the dump design guidelines. 

The results of this process are provided below. 

15.5 Pit Design 

15.5.1 Design Criteria 

Slope design criteria, as summarised in Table 15.2.2 Final Optimisation – Overall Slope Angles 
were supplied by Peter O'Bryan and Associates. 

The ramp design criteria, summarised in Table 15.5.1, are based on the 143 tonne payload 
Caterpillar 785D dump truck.  The 785D has a total operating width of 7.1 metres and has a 
machine clearance turning diameter of approximately 33 metres. 

It is common industry practice to design the width of the main ramps at 3.5 times truck width and 
adopting a 10% gradient.  This allows for safe passing of trucks inclusive of wall side drainage and 
pit side bunding.  The two-way ramp width used for the designs in Vindaloo Main was 25 metres, 
which equates to 3.5 times the 785D operating width.  15 metre wide single lane ramps 
(approximately 2 times the truck width) were used in Vindaloo 1, Vindaloo 2 and the Madras pits 
from the surface all the way to the bottom of the pit in order to minimise waste mining and hence 
costs.

For the benches at the pit base (i.e. the bottom 30 – 40 vertical metres), a single lane ramp width of 
15 m with a maximum gradient of 12.5% was allowed.  This reflects the lower traffic intensity on 
this section of the ramp and allows waste development to be minimised.

Maximum Grade 

(%) 

Vindaloo Main Dual 25 10 
Vindaloo 1 & 2 and Madras Single 15 10 
All pits – Bottom Section Single 15 12.5 

 

Switchbacks are to be located on flat sections of ramp.  The switchback centreline turning diameter 
equals 39 metres which equates to 1.5 times the truck centreline turning diameter. 

Pit designs, whether they are final or interim stage designs, need to provide sufficient space to 
undertake mining activities in an efficient and safe manner.  This applies to the bottom of each 
stage / ultimate pit design and also to pushbacks.  Providing sufficient space is achieved by 
adopting a minimum mining width in the design criteria.   

A minimum mining width of 55 m has been adopted.  This distance is based on loading machine 
clearance turning diameter of 20 m, plus 15 m clearance on both sides plus a 5 m windrow.  This 
will allow a truck to turn around on the bench with ease, provide sufficient space at the truck 
loading areas, space for jump up access for drilling and blasting activities and space for bunding 
and drainage. 

A narrower width of 14 m has been allowed for the final "goodbye" drop cut at the very base of the 
pits.  Goodbye cuts, targeting ore material only, are mined from a pit floor with permanent ramp 
access and a minimum mining width of approximately 20 m to 25 m.  Goodbye cuts are excavated 
with a backhoe and there is no access to the bottom of these cuts. 

The location of the pit exits is important to minimise the ore and waste haulage costs.  The overall 
stripping ratio from the pit optimisation process equals 8.5, this means the waste volume is much 
larger than the ore volume and hence the pit exits need to be located such that the waste haulage 
is minimised.  

The design of the Vindaloo and Madras pits are shown in Figure 15.5.1 to Figure 15.5.15.  Also 
shown in these figures are the diluted ore grades of the measured and indicated materials, the 
optimisation shell, surface topography, bottom of the oxidation (BOCO), top of fresh rock (TOFR) 
and locations of the shear zone. 

15.5.2 Vindaloo Main Ultimate Pit Designs 

Due to the presence of a shear in the western wall of the Vindaloo Main South pit and because the 
relative long period of time over which this pit is being mined, the ramp was located in the eastern 
wall to avoid any pit access interruptions.

15.6 Houndé Mineral Reserves Calculation 

Mineral Reserves are quoted within specific pit designs based on Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resources only and take into consideration the mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and 
infrastructure modifying factors.  Preparations to submit information for environmental approvals 
and mining lease applications have commenced. 

This reserve estimate has been determined and reported in accordance with Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101, 'Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects' of June 2011 (the Instrument) 
and the Definition Standards adopted by CIM Council in November 2010. 

At a net gold price of $1218.24 per ounce (Table 15.2.14), the cut-off grade for the mineral 
reserves varies by location on the basis of the processing costs detailed in Table 15.2.12, the 
processing recoveries detailed in Table 15.2.13, and the ore related mining costs which vary block 
by block.  Therefore the global weighted cut-off grades by pit are shown in Table 15.6.1 as an 
indication of the cut-off grades used for reporting.

15.7 Stage Designs 

Stage designs were generated for Vindaloo Main in order to enhance the scheduling process 
aiming to delay waste mining as much as practically possible and to bring forward higher grade 
ore; and/or ore with lower mining costs due to shorter haulage distances; and more weathered ore 
with lower processing costs.  

Multiple stages were designed for Vindaloo Main.  The other deposits are too small for more than a 
single stage.  The Vindaloo Main stage designs are shown in Figure 15.7.1 to Figure 15.7.5. 

The mineral reserves in each of the stages is summarised in Table 15.7.1.

Vindaloo Main stages 11, 12 and 15 can be mined independently and are good starter pits with 
favourable stripping ratios and with average grade or better.  For this reason it is better to mine 
Stage 13 after Stages 11 and 12.  Stage 14 must be mined in conjunction with Stage 13 in order to 
maintain ramp access; it can lag behind Stage 13 by no more than 4 benches.  

Stage 16 can be mined after Stage 15 or in conjunction with it.  Stage 16 is a better stage than the 
Stage 13 and Stage 14 combination because it has a higher grade and lower stripping ratio. 

The other pits can be mined independently but Vindaloo 1 and the Madras pits have relatively low 
stripping ratios but also below average gold grade.  Vindaloo 2 has a high gold grade but also has 
a high stripping ratio. 

The stripping ratio and grade trade-offs are determined in the scheduling process described in 
Section 16 of this report.

15.8 Waste Storage Facility Designs 

Waste storage facility shells have been designed with the following design criteria: 

� The standoff distance between the pits and the waste storage facilities has been 
determined in accordance with safety bund requirements by the Department of Industry 
and Resources of Western Australia as illustrated in Figure 15.8.1.  The position of the 
WSF toe is located at the toe of the safety bund. 

Figure 15.8.1 WSF Standoff Distance from Pit Crest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

� In order to realise cost savings now, rather than a potential cost saving at some point in 
the future it, was decided to allow the eastern WSF to be constructed on the Koho 
mineralisation zone.  

� There was no maximum height limit for waste storage facilities. 

� The swell factor utilised to calculate the placed material in the waste storage facility was 
25%. 

� The overall final landform angles are 20 degrees. 

� No consideration was given to stand off distances between WSFs and villages or heritage 
sites as there do not appear to be any villages or heritage sites in the vicinity of the 
mining.

The shells were exported to EVORELUTION scheduling software.  As the schedule progresses, 
the shells are filled with waste.  The waste destination is determined by the lowest cost haulage 
option available.  Hence the volumes and the final shapes of the waste WSFs are determined and 
optimised during the scheduling process. 

In reality WSFs are constructed in 20 m high lifts with 37 degree face angles and are later 
reworked into their final landform during the WSF rehabilitation process.  This is illustrated in 
Figure 15.8.2.

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Mining Method 

16.1.1 General Description Mining Methods 

The PEA demonstrated that the Vindaloo and Madras deposits are suitable to conventional open 
pit mining methods adopting drilling, blasting, trucks and shovels in order to supply ore to a 3 Mtpa 
treatment plant.  

The optimisation process described in Section 15 validates adopting these conventional open pit 
mining methods for the development of the Houndé project.  This study has adopted 5 m high 
benches in ore and 10 m high benches in bulk waste in order to avoid, as much as practical, ore 
loss and dilution during the mining process.  The optimisation process described in Section 15 also 
highlights the importance of adopting grade control methods that minimise the effect of ore loss 
and dilution during the mining process. 

After initial detailed cost comparisons between submissions from mining contractors and first 
principle owner / operator mining costs, the "Owner Operator" option approach was used as the go-
forward option in this study.  Only two mining service contracts are anticipated: 

1. The supply of "down the hole" blasting service which includes both the delivery of bulk 
explosive "down the hole" and the supply of blasting accessories. 

2. RC drilling for grade control. 

16.1.2 Mining Equipment 

The equipment planned for the Houndé project is summarised in Table 16.1.1 and Table 16.1.2.

The fleet was based around a 140 tonne capacity Caterpillar 785 rigid bodied dump truck matched 
to a Caterpillar 6030 excavator (290 tonne).  This equipment was selected on the basis that these 
machines are:  

� Fit for purpose (i.e. capable of mining both the 5 metre bench height and the 2.5 metre 
flitch height). 

� Able to deliver the estimated dilution and ore loss without any significant loss of 
productivity.

16.1.3 Blasting 

Blasting will be undertaken utilising industry standard storage, transport and charging practices for 
a modern mining operation, subject to all local and national statutory and regulatory requirements.  

Mining operations are not adjacent to villages or public roads.  With exception of the Madras pits 
the processing plant and other infrastructure associated with the project are at a distance in excess 
of 500 m from the pits.  The crest of the Madras South pit is at a distance of 260 m from the 225 kV 
Cote d'Ivoire – Burkina Faso power line.  Blasting is not currently required at Madras Pit.  However 
should blasting be required in the future it needs to be executed carefully to avoid interference with 
the operation of this power line.

At the start of blasting operations it is planned to measure the blasting induced vibration levels at 
the power line to confirm that these levels are negligible and will not interfere with the operation of 
this line. 

16.1.4 Mine Dewatering 

Water inflows resulting from rainfall and from ground water into the pits will be collected in pit 
sumps.  Sump pumps will transfer this water into water carts being used for dust suppression or 
into the "Turkeys Nest" pond on the surface if there is more water than needed for dust 
suppression.  The Turkeys Nest is connected to the water management system of the processing 
plant and excess mine water will be absorbed by this system.  

The general drainage in the project area is towards the south east.  It has been indicated that the 
catchment areas are relatively small and the average rainfall is also relatively low at 226 mm for 
August, the wettest month.

None of the pits are immune to the surface water inflow without the protection of a small cut-off 
bund around the pit crest.  These bunds are also needed to prevent people inadvertently gaining 
access to the pit crest with vehicles.  Construction of bunds with waste material is addressed 
during the mining phase without incurring extra costs (i.e. instead of this material being dumped on 
the waste storage facility it is placed around the pit edge at no additional cost). 

The Vindaloo 2 pit intersects one of the natural drainage channels running north of this pit and an 
engineered diversion has been generated to avoid flooding of this pit.  This civil engineering 
solution is not part of the mining scope and this work was undertaken by Knight Piésold. 

16.1.5 Dust Suppression 

Dust suppression will be undertaken by water carts fitted with spray bars.  Water for dust 
suppression will be available from sumps in the pits in first instance and from the Turkeys Nest on 
the surface if the pit sumps run dry. 

16.1.6 Grade Control 

The grade control approach during optimisation was based on blast holes.  However, this has 
changed as it is intended to adopt RC drilling techniques as the basis for grade control in order to 
provide better coverage of the ore zones.  Samples are planned to be taken every 2 metres over a 
32 metre deep inclined (50°) hole.  The grade control pattern across the ore is factored by 100% to 
account for the drilling of the surrounding waste (i.e. a ratio of 1 waste tonne for every ore tonne 
drilled).  A pattern size of 25 metres along strike and 15 metres across strike is planned.  It is 
intended to undertake this activity using contract drilling. 

The samples will be collected by geology personnel and delivered to the site lab.  Assay results will 
be used for grade control modelling and reconciliation, eventually feeding back into the resource 
modelling and mine planning.

16.1.7 Mining Schedule 

Aim of the Schedule 

The aim was to generate a practical, realistically achievable schedule which maximises value 
within the constraints.  

A practical, realistically achievable schedule is one that: 

� Meets mill feed requirements. 

� Includes ramp-up considerations for mine operations as well as the processing plant. 

� Avoids vertical advance rates of >100 m per annum. 

� Is centred around a stable fleet size that does not vary too much between periods and is 
sufficient to undertake the work without unnecessary excess capacity. 

� Avoids congestion on benches and ramps. 

Maximum value is achieved by: 

� Bringing forward higher grade, lower cost ore as much as possible. 

� Delaying waste mining as much as possible.  This includes keeping the pre-stripping 
period as short as possible. 

� Avoiding rehandling and avoiding stockpiles larger than necessary.  

In order to obtain sufficient resolution of material movement and hence mill feed during the early 
years of the operation, and to raise the confidence in the achievability of the schedule, the first 
4 years (including the pre-stripping period) of the Life of Mine (LOM) schedule were undertaken in 
monthly periods with quarterly increments thereafter.  

Scheduling Targets and Constraints 

The processing plant feed schedule aims to meet the following criteria during each scheduling 
period: 

� Plant feed rate of 3.0 Mtpa when the fresh rock proportion of the feed is greater than 
75%.

� The mill feed rate is allowed to grow by a maximum of 15% in each period when the 
saprolite and transitional ore component exceeds 25% of total.  The throughput effects 
with varying proportions of saprolite and transition are shown in Table 16.1.3.

� A maximum plant feed grade of 4.0 g/t Au. 

In addition, it is preferred to have a stockpile size of approximately 2 weeks capacity, i.e. 115,000 t. 

Scheduling Process 

All mining schedules were generated in EVORELUTION, a sophisticated block-by-block scheduling 
software.  The scheduling is undertaken on all materials within the stages presented in 
Table 15.7.1.  The stages enhance the ability of the scheduling software to target the mining of 
better parts of the pits and to delay the mining of other, less favourable, parts in order to maximise 
the Project value. 

The scheduling process has adopted a Truck Based (TB) scheduling approach.  This is a true 3D, 
block by block, method where the ore and waste quantities are dictated by the available truck fleet 
capacity and the haulage requirements during any period.  The objective of the scheduler is to 
keep the fleet as small as possible and avoid fleet size fluctuations. 

TB scheduling also minimises the waste haulage distance in any scheduling period.  For any waste 
materials mined, the shortest possible haul route is selected to the nearest Waste Storage Facility 
(WSF).  A Waste Storage Envelope, with geometry based on the design criteria outlined in 
Section 15.8, is developed for all available WSF locations.  As the schedule progresses, the WSFs 
are constructed block by block, gradually filling the WSF envelope which generates the lowest cost 
at that point in time.  Hence waste haulage distances increase over time as the WSFs are 
constructed. 

A spreadsheet solution was used to apply a direct tip / stockpile reclaim strategy on the final mining 
schedule and determine the actual processing plant feed. 

Scheduling Results 

Annualised scheduling results are shown in Figure 16.1.1 to Figure 16.1 5 and Table 16.1.2.  The 
vertical advance rate for each of the stages is summarised in Table 16.1.3.

The key aspects of the schedule are: 

� The processing plant is supplied with ore at a rate of 3 Mtpa or higher. 

� The feed grade is less than 4 g/t Au at all times. 

� The stockpile varies from a high of 0.5 Mt at the end of Year 4 to a low of 40 kt in Years 5 
and 6 with an average of 0.23 Mt over the life. 

� The duration of the pre-strip period during Year -1 was contained to 3 months and a total 
quantity of 3.22 Mt. 

� The annual vertical advance rates of maximum of 90 m are acceptable. 

� During Years 5 and 6 there are only 2 active work areas and all trucks utilise a single 
ramp.  This may introduce inefficiencies which can be avoided by bringing forward one of 
the other stages.

16.2 Hydrogeology 

A groundwater investigation in the Vindaloo Pit area was described in the Groundwater 
Investigation Report by Knight Piésold (KP ref PE401-00067_02, May 2013, available on request).  
No primary aquifers were identified in the vicinity of the Vindaloo Pit.  Bulk permeability and 
storativity values were predicted to be low and to be largely controlled by the weathering profile and 
possible deeper fracturing / faulting. 

16.2.1 Groundwater Levels 

Groundwater levels along the centre line of Vindaloo Pit (recorded in February 2013 at the end of 
the dry season) ranged between 2 and 26 metres below ground level (mbgl) with an average value 
of 14 mbgl.  A seasonal variation of less than one metre is expected.  The groundwater flow 
direction is likely to reflect the general topography and flow from the higher elevation ground to the 
northwest of the pit towards the valley to the southeast.  

16.2.2 Permeability Values 

Falling head tests were undertaken in 14 monitor bores installed along the centre line of the 
Vindaloo Pit.  Permeability values derived from the falling head tests were very low (2.7 x 10-8 m/s 
to 1.3 x 10-10 m/s, average 1.8 x 10-9 m/s).  Based on the falling head test results the rock mass at 
depth is likely to have a very low permeability value.  A single constant rate pumping test was also 
undertaken on the existing bore located mid-way along the Vindaloo Pit north wall, which gave a 
higher permeability value of 1.3 X 10-3 m/s.  Higher permeability typically occurs at the base of the 
weathered zone (possibly the source of permeability in the pumping well) and in association with 
faults / fractures where present.

16.2.3 Predicted Groundwater Inflows 

Groundwater inflow to the pit is expected to be low based on the geology and the predominantly 
low permeability values encountered.  Based on standard analytical flow equations the estimated 
groundwater inflow to the pit (excluding incident rainfall and surface water runoff) is 6 L/s when the 
Vindaloo Pit is fully developed.  It is anticipated that groundwater seepages may take place at the 
base of the weathered zone and possibly in association with deeper fracturing / faulting that will be 
controlled by in-pit sumps.  Abstraction from the existing bore located mid-way along the Vindaloo 
Pit north wall will also assist with pit dewatering as well as provide a water supply for construction 
and dust suppression purposes.  It is noted that the presence of water bearing structures such as 
faults / fractures or shear zones cannot be ruled out.  

16.2.4 Baseline Water Chemistry 

Water samples collected from dams, surface water, drill holes and wells in the vicinity of the 
Houndé project (50 samples) were very fresh (total dissolved solids (TDS) 14 to 451 mg/L, average 
TDS 114 mg/L), slightly acidic (pH 5 to 7.9, average pH 6.3), and bicarbonate dominated water 
typical of rainwater or recently recharged groundwater.  Chromium (in three samples) and arsenic 
(one sample) occurs above the 2011 WHO Drinking Water Quality Guideline Values.  

16.3 Fleet Size and Personnel Numbers 

Fleet productivity was developed on the basis of a Caterpillar 6030 290 tonne excavator matched 
to a Caterpillar 785D 140 tonne dump truck.  The shovel productivity and truck payload were 
calculated as shown in Table 16.3.1.

16.4 Mining CAPEX / OPEX 

Details of mining capital and operating costs are provided in Section 21.1 Mining Cost Estimates. 

16.5 Technical Risks and Opportunities 

16.5.1 Open Pit Optimisation 

1 The open pit optimisation process highlighted the sensitivity of the project value to 
changes in price / processing recoveries / grade, which are the usual triumvirate of 
parameters as they all directly affect revenue.  The use of a Revenue Factor of 0.88 for 
the final shell selection, which effectively equates to a base gold price of $1,144/oz 
represents a relatively conservative approach and provides some mitigation against 
variations in these modifying factors. 

2 As indicated by P O'Bryan & Associates, the slope design parameters for the final pit 
optimisation analysis were based largely on "what is thought to be reasonable upside for 
the project".  To mitigate the potential risk to production delays, ongoing geotechnical 
assessments will need to be undertaken during the life of the operation, particularly on 
the impact of the shear zones. 

16.5.2 Mine Design 

1 The impact of further development drilling in and around the main orebody has the 
potential to impact on both the final pit design and the layout of the surrounding 
infrastructure (i.e. waste storage facilities, haul roads etc.).  Drilling of any prospective 
mineralisation close by the orebody should be prioritised such that any requirements to 
modify the site layout can be made before mining is too far advanced. 

2 The pit designs include 0.66 Mt of Inferred Mineral Resources at a diluted grade of 
1.61 g/t Au (variable cut-off applied).  This material is currently reported as waste.  This 
material is distributed through a number of the pits and does not present as one cohesive 
drilling target.  It is recommended that an evaluation is undertaken to determine whether 
more resource drilling is warranted to increase the geological confidence levels of these 
Inferred Mineral Resources.

16.5.3 Mine Scheduling 

1 Re-optimise the waste development sequence to align with the mine lease boundaries. 

2 Conduct sterilisation drilling of the Koho mineralisation on the east side of Vindaloo Main 
before the 2nd quarter of Year 2; prior to commencing waste dump construction of the 
Vindaloo Main East WSF. 

3 Bring a minimal amount of waste forward in Years 1 to 3 in order to: 

a. Reduce the vertical advance rate in Year 7 in the Vindaloo 2 pit. 

b. Reduce the TMM to within the capacity of the primary loading fleet over the 
Year 4 to Year 5 period when the 992 FEL is required to undertake some 
primary loading of pit waste. 

4 Conduct evaluation into the effect of the single lane ramps on traffic congestion. 

16.5.4 Cost Estimation 

1 More detailed due diligence of competitive mining equipment should be undertaken and 
more detailed budget estimates obtained before a final OEM is selected.  The decision 
should not be based on cost alone but should include assessment of: 

a. In-country track record and support personnel / facilities. 

b. Number of units in operation in Burkina Faso, Africa and world-wide. 

c. Performance guarantees and availability of spares. 

2 The potential to purchase second-hand equipment, particularly for the trucks that are 
required mid-life, should be investigated. 

3 A 51 minute working hour has been selected for cost estimation purposes.  This is on the 
basis that Endeavour will be able to source and train a competent and skilled workforce 
from start-up.  Additional funds were specifically allocated to training to improve mine 
team safety and efficiencies. 

4 As owner / operator, securing a long term supply for fuel and tires is of critical importance. 

5 Personnel costs currently constitute an extremely low proportion of the overall mining 
costs (<9%).  Should the mining industry in Burkina Faso expand over the next few years, 
as is predicted, then the associated competiveness for skilled staff may well increase this 
cost.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Selection 

The process plant design will reflect a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum 
recovery with minimum operating costs and utilising unit operations that are well proven in industry.  
The key criteria for equipment selection are suitability for duty, reliability and ease of maintenance.  
The plant layout provides ease of access to all equipment for operating and maintenance 
requirements whilst maintaining a compact footprint that will minimise construction costs. 

The key project and ore specific criteria for the plant design are: 

� 3,000,000 t/y (9,000 t/d) throughput of the life of mine (LOM) blend ore, 88% Primary and 
12% Saprolite / Transition. 

� Mechanical availability of 91.3% supported by crushed ore storage and standby 
equipment in critical areas. 

� Sufficient instrumentation and automation to achieve design production rates, to enable 
stable process operations and to facilitate safe operation. 

The Houndé Plant has been designed to treat the range of ore types and blends that will be mined 
over the life of the project. 

17.1.1 Selected Process Flowsheet 

The treatment plant design incorporates the following unit process operations:

� A live stockpile from which ore will be reclaimed to feed the milling circuit. 

� A SABC milling circuit comprising a SAG mill in closed circuit with a pebble crusher and a 
ball mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones to produce an 80% passing 90 micron grind 
size. 

� A gravity circuit utilizing continuous centrifugal gravity concentrators to recover free gold 
and occluded gold in coarse or heavy particles (pyrite) from the milled slurry to a low 
mass gravity concentrate.  The design mass pull of 2.5% to gravity concentrate was 
nominated based on recovery data and the installed power for the selected fine grinding 
mill and a typical fine grind specific energy requirement. 

� A gravity concentrate regrind and leach circuit comprising an ultra fine grind (UFG) mill in 
closed circuit with cyclones to produce an 80% passing 10 micron grind size followed by 
a concentrate leach circuit providing a total of 4 hours leach time.

17.2 Process and Plant Description 

17.2.1 ROM Pad 

The Run of Mine (ROM) pad will be used to provide a buffer between the mine and the plant.  The 
ROM stockpile will allow blending of ore feed stocks, and will ensure a consistent feed type and 
feed rate to the plant.  ROM ore will be loaded into the crushing circuit feed bin (ROM bin) by direct 
tipping from the mining haul trucks or by front end loader (FEL).  

17.2.2 Crushing and Grinding Circuit 

ROM ore will be drawn from the ROM bin at a controlled rate by an apron feeder and discharged 
onto a vibrating grizzly.  The grizzly oversize will report to the jaw crusher for primary crushing.  
The jaw crusher product together with grizzly undersize will report to the primary crusher discharge 
conveyor feeding directly to the crushed ore stockpile.   

Ore will be withdrawn from the coarse ore stockpile and fed via the mill feed conveyor to the SAG 
mill.  Lime and SAG mill grinding media will be added to the mill feed conveyor as required. 

The grinding circuit will consist of a SAG mill in open circuit, a pebble crusher and a ball mill in 
closed circuit with hydrocyclones.   

The SAG mill will discharge via a pebble dewatering screen, and oversize consisting of pebbles 
and worn steel grinding media, will discharge onto the pebble transfer conveyor.  Worn media will 
be removed by a magnet and pebbles will be crushed in the pebble crusher and will report back to 
the SAG mill conveyor.  The screen undersize will gravitate to the mill discharge hopper and will be 
pumped to the hydrocyclone cluster for size classification. 

The cyclone underflow (coarse material) will report to the ball mill feed chute for further grinding.  
The cyclone overflow (product size material) will gravitate to the trash screens prior to gravity 
concentration and leaching.   

17.2.3 Trash Screening 

Cyclone overflow will gravitate to two trash screen located in the CIL area for removal of trash 
material and coarse particles.  The underflow of the trash screens will gravitate to the gravity circuit 
for gravity concentration.   

17.2.4 Gravity Circuit 

Milled and screened slurry will report to the gravity circuit where it will be treated by centrifugal 
gravity concentrators to recover the free coarse gold and gold associated with coarse sulphide and 
silicate particles.  The low mass gravity concentrate (2 to 3% of feed tonnage) will report to the 
concentrate UFG circuit and the gravity tails will report to pre-leach thickening.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd

17.2.5 Gravity Concentrate Treatment 

The gravity concentrate treatment circuit will consist of a UFG mill in closed circuit with 
hydrocyclones and a concentrate leach circuit. 

The gravity concentrate will gravitate to the concentrate storage tank which will provide a buffer for 
the UFG circuit.  Provision will be made to add peroxide solution to the concentrate storage tank.  
UFG feed slurry will be pumped to the UFG mill for fine grinding.  The ground slurry will be diluted 
and pumped to the UFG cyclones for classification.  The UFG cyclone underflow (material requiring 
further grinding) will report to the concentrate storage tank for further grinding.  The UFG cyclone 
overflow (reground concentrate size material) will gravitate to the concentrate leach tanks. 

The concentrate leach circuit will consist of two leach tanks providing 4 hours residence time.  
Caustic and peroxide solutions will be added to ensure that the slurry pH (caustic) and dissolved 
oxygen level (peroxide) is suitable for cyanidation.  Sodium cyanide solution will be metered into 
the leach circuit and air from dedicated blowers will be sparged down the shafts of the leach 
agitators to provide oxygen to the leach slurry.  

Leached concentrate will be pumped to the CIL circuit for gold adsorption as well as using any 
residual sodium cyanide in the concentrate slurry.

17.2.6 Pre-leach Thickening 

Tails from the gravity circuit will be thickened in a high rate thickener prior to CIL.  The thickener 
feed slurry will be mixed with flocculant and will report to the pre-leach thickener. 

The thickened slurry (thickener underflow) will be pumped to CIL and the thickener overflow will 
gravitate to the adjacent mill water tank and will be distributed as dilution water to the milling and 
UFG circuits.  Process water from the process water pond will be added to the mill water tank to 
balance mill water requirements. 

17.2.7 Leach and Adsorption Circuit 

The adsorption circuit will consist of six CIL adsorption tanks providing 36 hours residence time 
(the minimum 24 hours required by the testwork can still be achieved if the thickener is by-passed).  
The tanks will be interconnected with launders and slurry will flow by gravity through the tank train. 

Pre-leach thickener underflow and leached concentrate will be combined as CIL feed.  Quicklime 
added to the mill feed conveyor will ensure that the slurry pH is suitable for cyanidation and sodium 
cyanide solution will be metered into the CIL circuit.  Air from dedicated blowers will be sparged 
down the shafts of the CIL agitators to provide oxygen to the leach slurry.  

Barren activated carbon will be added to the last tank and advanced counter current to the slurry 
flow.  The leached gold will adsorb onto the carbon and be removed from the CIL slurry.  Carbon 
loaded with gold (loaded carbon) will be recovered from the CIL slurry via the loaded carbon 
recovery screen and will report to the elution circuit.

Slurry from the last CIL tank (CIL tails) will gravitate via the carbon safety screen to the cyanide 
destruction circuit. 

17.2.8 Elution and Gold Recovery 

The following operations will be carried out in the elution and goldroom areas: 

� Acid washing of loaded carbon. 

� Stripping (elution) of gold from loaded carbon using the split AARL method. 

� Electrowinning of gold from pregnant solution. 

� Smelting of electrowinning products. 

� Regeneration of barren carbon. 

Loaded carbon will be washed with a dilute acid solution to remove contaminants prior to being 
rinsed with water.  The loaded carbon will be eluted with a hot dilute cyanide / caustic solution 
which will recover the gold from the carbon into the solution.  The gold solution (pregnant solution) 
will be pumped through electrowinning cells and the gold will be recovered onto the cell cathodes.  
The gold will be removed from the cathodes by high pressure water jets with the gold sludge being 
filtered and dried prior to smelting with fluxes in a furnace to produce doré bars. 

Eluted carbon (barren carbon) will be transferred to the carbon regeneration kiln for reactivation 
prior to re-use in the CIL circuit. 

17.2.9 Cyanide Destruction 

Endeavour Mining Corporation is committed to meeting or exceeding the ICMC requirements.  An 
SO2 / air cyanide destruction circuit will be utilised to meet this requirement.  The SO2 / air 
destruction circuit will reduce the weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNWAD) in the slurry discharged 
from the CIL circuit to less than 50 mg/L prior to pumping to the TSF. 

The cyanide destruction circuit will consist of two tanks providing one hour residence time.  The 
tanks will be interconnected with launders to allow the circuit to be run in parallel or series. 

Underflow from the CIL circuit carbon safety screen will gravitate to the cyanide destruction circuit.  
Copper sulphate and sodium metabisulphite (SMBS) solutions will be added to provide the required 
copper and sulphur dioxide for the cyanide destruction process.  Air from dedicated blowers will be 
sparged down the shafts of the cyanide destruction agitators to provide oxygen to the slurry.  
Provision will be made for caustic solution to be added to maintain a slurry pH 8.0 to 9.0.  

Treated tailings will gravitate to the tailings tank and will be pumped to the TSF.

Plant and Instrument Air Supply - Plant and instrument air will be supplied from air compressors 
and will be filtered and dried before distribution with separate plant and instrument air receivers. 

17.3 Control Philosophy 

The general control philosophy for the plant is to provide a moderate level of automation and 
remote control facilities.  Instrumentation will be provided within the plant to measure and control 
key process parameters, while still requiring manual inspection of equipment before starting. 

The main control room will house two PC based operator interface terminals (OIT).  Both of the 
OITs will act as the control system supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers as 
well as configuration / operator stations.  The control room is intended to provide a central area 
from where the plant is operated and monitored and from which the regulatory control loops can be 
monitored and adjusted.  All key process and maintenance parameters will be available for trending 
and alarming on the process control system (PCS). 

The process control system that will be used for the plant will be a programmable logic controller 
(PLC) based SCADA system.  The PCS will control the process interlocks and PID control loops for 
non-packaged equipment.  Control loop set-point changes for non-packaged equipment will be 
made at the OIT.   

In general, the plant process drives will report their ready, run and start pushbutton status to the 
PCS and will be displayed on the OIT.  Local control stations will be located in the field in proximity 
to the relevant drives.  These will, as a minimum, contain start and latch-off-stop (LOS) push-
buttons which will be hard-wired to the drive starter.  Plant drives will predominantly be started by 
an operator in the field after inspecting the local equipment.   

The OITs will allow drives to be selected to Local or Remote or Maintenance modes via the drive 
control popup.  Statutory interlocks such as emergency stops and thermal protection will be 
hardwired and will apply in all three modes of operation.  All PLC generated process interlocks will 
apply in Local and Remote modes.  Process interlocks will be disabled or bypassed in Maintenance 
mode with the exception of critical interlocks such as lubrication systems on the mill.  

Local selection will allow each drive to be operated by the operator in the field via the local start 
pushbutton which is connected to a PLC input.  Remote selection will allow the equipment to be 
started from the control room via the drive control popup.  Maintenance selection will allow each 
drive to be operated by maintenance personnel in the field via the local start push-button which is 
connected to a PLC input.  A PLC output will be wired to each drive starter circuit for starting and 
stopping drives.  Status indication of process interlocks as well as the selected mode of operation 
will be displayed on the OIT.   

Vendor supplied packages will use vendor standard control systems throughout the project.  
Vendor packages will generally be operated locally with limited control or set-point changes from 
the PCS system.  General equipment fault alarms from each vendor package will be monitored by 
the PCS system and displayed on the OIT.  Fault diagnostics and troubleshooting of vendor 
packages will be performed locally.

18.2 Roads 

18.2.1 Road Types 

A range of road types will be required to and within the Project site to meet a wide range of duties.  
The hierarchy of road types includes dedicated mine haul roads, main access roads, general 
access roads and minor use roads and tracks.  Some of the roads will border service corridors, 
e.g. raw water supply pipe lines, or tailing pump line access.  Hence, road alignments also need to 
consider service routes in addition to transport requirements. 

The road widths and construction details have been selected to match the required duties.  The 
respective details are described below.  The total lengths of the main road types are: 

� Mine haul roads  Approximately 8.5 km. 

� Main access roads  Approximately 3.0 km. 

� Plant roads   Approximately 2.7 km. 

� Access tracks  Approximately 19 km. 

Roads will generally follow existing tracks or contours where no direct route can be achieved with 
the aim to minimise disruption to local villages and crop fields. 

Interpretation of the geotechnical test results and ground conditions suggests that the local soils 
are typically clayey / gravely silt with low plasticity and less than ideal for road pavement 
construction. 

Laterite gravel material, to form the base course for minor roads and the sub-base for heavy use 
roads, will be sourced from borrow pits along the main roads within the purchased property area or 
within the open pit mine footprint.  Suitable gravel borrow areas will be identified during the next 
phase of the Project. 

18.2.2 Access to Site 

Current road access to the plant site from the N1 Highway is on an unsealed track for 1.5 km – this 
will be upgraded, to a sealed, 9 m wide road.  The proposed camp will be approximately 1 km from 
the main access road and will be a 7 m wide unsealed road. 

18.2.3 Project Site Roads 

Mine Haul Roads 

Mine haul roads will be designed and constructed by the mining department to access the pits, 
waste dumps and ROM pad.  The mining services facilities will be designed and built by the EPCM 
contractor.

Main Access Road 

The 1.5 km section of access track will be reconstructed, widened, and sealed to form the main 
access road.  The road will have a width of 9 m with two 3.5 m wide sealed lanes and 1 m 
shoulders.  The road will follow the natural grade of the ground and designated crossing points for 
farm machinery, herding or walking will be provided near where current, well used trails exist. 

The proposed road alignment passes under the 225 kV power line near to a cable tower in order to 
provide a clearance envelope of 10 to 12 m under the minimum 5.5 m clearance to the lowest 
power cable.  A berm of waste rock will be placed to protect the tower base. 

The intersection of the main access road with the N1 Highway, has been designed for a speed limit 
of 60 km/h, and will include a centre island with dedicated turning lanes for vehicles entering the 
main access road.  Street lighting will be installed at the junction approaches to improve visibility 
and safety during night time. 

Camp Access Road 

The camp access road will be 7 m wide and will be constructed as an unsealed all-weather road 
with appropriate drainage provisions where necessary. 

Plant Roads 

Plant site internal roads will be 7 m wide and will be constructed flush with the bulk earthworks pad 
to ensure that storm water sheet flow is achieved across the site, avoiding the need for deep 
surface drains and culvert crossings within this area. 

Access Tracks 

A number of tracks will be constructed to access infrastructure such as the water storage facility, 
bore pumps and tailings dam which are remote from the plant site.  These access tracks will 
generally follow the alignment of existing tracks and will be cleared and graded natural earth tracks.  
Pipeline routes will generally follow the access tracks. 

18.3 Rail Connections 

The main railway line between Abidjan, the chief port in Cote d'Ivoire, and Ouagadougou passes 
approximately 28 km to the north of the project site along the D40 main road heading north west 
from Houndé town.  The station at Béréba services the local cotton producers, and with minor 
modifications would be suitable as a terminal to receive construction materials and equipment and 
ongoing operational supplies, especially those that can be containerized for security of shipment 
and ease of handling.

18.4 Port Facilities 

The main ports serving project are Abidjan, in Cote d'Ivoire and Tema in Ghana.  Both ports are 
connected to Burkina Faso by main roads and provide the prime entry point for importation of 
equipment and fabrications.  Both ports are able to handle all types of cargo required for the 
project. 

18.5 Water Supply 

18.5.1 Water Demand 

A water balance model was prepared to estimate the demand for raw water on site, considering the 
process water demand, losses and gains from the tailings storage facility, pit dewatering and dust 
suppression and runoff from the ROM pad and plant site.  Utilization of ground water resources 
from boreholes was incorporated into the model.  Any potential shortfall was modeled to be 
supplied from a water storage dam which will be fed from a water harvesting dam. 

The total water demand for the site was estimated at 3.3 Mm3 per year.  The water demand for the 
process plant amounts to 2.85 Mm3, which includes the minimum raw water requirement of 
0.49 Mm3 but excludes water in ore.  Other water demands include a provision of 0.54 Mm3 for dust 
suppression.  The demand will be met from TSF decant, pit dewatering (including precipitation on 
the pit area), runoff from the ROM pad and sub-ore stockpiles. 

Potable water demand for the project has been estimated from the number of persons expected to 
be working and living on site, and the per capita daily demand estimated from similar projects in the 
region. 

18.5.2 Decant From Tailings Storage Facility 

The water balance modelling indicated that for tailings pumped to the TSF at 50% solids, the pond 
on the TSF would increase during the wet season and reduce to the minimum pre-set level during 
the following dry season.  Recovery from the TSF decant would gradually increase to supply up to 
79% of the process water demand, or up to 2.3 Mm3 per year, in the later years of operation.  The 
water balance modelling is described in the Site Water Management Report prepared by Knight 
Piésold (Report PE401-00067_05, July 2013, available on request).   

18.5.3 Groundwater Investigation 

Knight Piésold carried out an investigation into groundwater sources in the project area with the 
aims of estimating the likely volumes of water arising from open pit mine dewatering and the 
availability of water to meet the project demand.  Details of the investigation are available on 
request in Knight Piésold's Groundwater Investigation Report PE401-00067_02 Rev B, May 2013.  
The report concludes that the contribution from pit dewatering, including external groundwater 
sources of 8 L/s and precipitation on the pit surface is estimated to be up to 1.5 Mm3 per year, 
depending on the extent of the pit development.

18.5.4 Surface Water 

The water balance model assumes that any water demand which could not be met from the tailings 
storage facility, pit dewatering or groundwater sources, will be met from surface water sources.  
The models were run on a monthly basis for the life of mine for average climatic conditions and 
tested for a 1 in 100 year dry event and 1 in 100 year wet event occurring when each would have 
the greatest impact on operations.  Under average climatic conditions, the water demand from 
surface water sources decreases as the tailings beach in the tailings storage facility increases, 
resulting in higher recovery of precipitation on the tailings storage facility.  The recovery from pit 
dewatering also increases as the pit surface increases. 

The demand from surface water sources is highest in the year when the process plant is 
commissioned, when under average climatic conditions 1.75 Mm3 is required from the water 
storage dam.  The demand for surface water decreases to 1.2 Mm3 in the 9th year of operation.  

Water Harvest Dam 

A water harvest dam will be constructed east of the pit.  The mean annual runoff at the dam site is 
estimated to be 4.8 Mm3 from a catchment area of 21,850 Ha.  The required earth fill embankment 
will be 8 m high and 760 m long to create a storage capacity of 1.8 Mm3.  The surface area of the 
dam at full supply will be 120 Ha.  A spillway will be provided to safely pass a 1 in 100 year peak 
flood.  The embankment will be constructed from material excavated from the basin.  The 
embankment will consist of several zones, including a low permeability core, a chimney drain, a 
structural layer and, on the upstream face, a layer of non-dispersive material covered by an erosion 
protection layer.  The embankment slopes will be 2.5H:1V on both upstream and downstream 
faces.  

Due to the flat topography at the dam site, the proposed water harvesting facility on its own would 
not meet the project water demand on a sustainable basis; therefore a supplementary water 
storage dam was identified. 

Water Storage Dam 

A more favourable storage site was identified approximately 5 km west of the water harvest dam 
site.  This storage dam would have a catchment area of only 400 Ha and so could not replace the 
harvest dam, but due to its more efficient storage characteristics and relatively small embankment, 
it was selected as a storage facility to be supplied from the harvest dam during the wet season.  
The water storage dam will have a capacity of 1.5 Mm3 and will have a surface area of 58 Ha at full 
capacity.  The required earth fill embankment will be 10 m high and 130 m long.  The embankment 
construction will be similar to that described for the water harvest dam.

Water will be pumped from a decant structure in the water harvest dam to the water storage dam at 
a rate of 600 m3/h to build up storage capacity for use during the dry season, when the water 
harvest dam could be empty.  The demand from the water harvest dam is highest in the first year of 
operation, when the process plant will have to be supplied and storage built up in the storage dam.  
The peak annual demand for surface water was projected to be 2.4 Mm3 (Note: The mean annual 
runoff at the harvest dam site is >4.8 Mm3.  Therefore, if water is pumped at a high enough rate, 
water could be harvested and pumped to the storage facility during the rainy season when the dam 
will mostly be at full capacity or spilling). 

18.6 Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) 

18.6.1 Capacity and Location 

A tailings storage facility (TSF) with a capacity of approximately 25 Mt will be required to store the 
tailings generated by the process plant over a period of about 8 to 9 years, at a rate of 3 Mtpa.  The 
TSF was designed to international standards to provide a facility to safely contain the tailings and 
reduce the potential effect thereof on the environment in the form of dusting, seepage or runoff 
from the tailings surface during operation and post closure.  The design complies with the 
guidelines proposed by the International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) and Guidelines on 
Tailings Dams: Planning, Design, Construction, Operation and Closure (ANCOLD 2012). Provision 
was made for the effects of seismic events and probable maximum precipitation events during 
operation and post closure.  To support the design and improve the safety of the facility, a dam 
break analysis, seepage analysis and stability analysis were performed on the embankments.  A 
water balance model was prepared to determine the impact of extreme rainfall events on the TSF 
pond.  If built and operated in accordance with the principles and design concepts outlined in this 
document, this facility would contain the tailings generated from the project and the effects on the 
environment would be within acceptable limits as defined by international standards. 

Seven locations were evaluated as potential sites for the TSF.  The selected site, a valley storage 
facility approximately 5 km to the west of the proposed process plant site will require a main 
embankment 668 m long and 23 m high and three smaller saddle embankments respectively 
130 m long and 10 m high, 755 m long and 15.5 m high, 1,116 m long and 7 m high.  It is estimated 
that the tailings surface at full capacity will cover approximately 200 ha.  It is noted that the selected 
site has the potential to provide storage in excess of the required 25 Mt of tailings by increasing the 
embankment height and, if required, adding a saddle embankment to the south of the facility.  Initial 
estimates indicate that by increasing the embankment height by 9 m, the storage capacity of the 
TSF could potentially double. 

18.6.2 Design Considerations 

Tailings will be pumped to the TSF as a slurry at 48% to 50% solids and will be deposited sub-
aerially to facilitate drying and consolidation of the tailings mass.  It is expected that in the TSF a 
density of approximately 1.4 t/m3 will be achieved initially, increasing to 1.6 t/m3 to give an overall 
final density of 1.55 t/m3.

The tailings acid base accounting indicated that the tailings would be acid consuming.  The assay 
results showed that the tailings solids had a low number of elemental enrichments, with arsenic, 
selenium and antimony significantly enriched and chromium slightly enriched.  Note that elemental 
enrichment is expected in any mineralogical deposit. A comparison with soil intervention guidelines 
indicated that the element concentrations for chromium, manganese, nickel, sulfur, sulfate and 
vanadium significantly exceed the soil intervention guidelines.  The sample also marginally 
exceeded the guidelines for arsenic and copper.  The results of this comparison indicate that a 
cover system designed to isolate the tailings facility from the environment will be required on 
closure to prevent migration of tailings.  The cost of an appropriate cover system has been included 
in the design and closure costs. 

The tailings supernatant was tested against reference water quality standards for release of water 
from mining operations and livestock drinking water.  Endeavour intends to install a cyanide 
destruction unit as part of the process, which will reduce the WAD cyanide to below 50 ppm at the 
spigot discharge into the dam, as recommended by the ICMC.  Arsenic and antimony were present 
at levels which would require dilution before releasing into aquatic systems as surface flows.  It will 
therefore be required to store a minimum of a 1 in 100 year wet event on the TSF without release 
to the environment (this minimum only occurs in the dry season when the tailings are at the 
maximum level prior to the next embankment lift being constructed).  It is estimated that the 
concentration of substances in the tailings water will be diluted more than 50 times for a 1 in 
100 year event.  When compared with background groundwater quality, the tailings supernatant 
contained arsenic at levels higher than the groundwater and the release standards.  A suitable 
seepage reduction system will therefore be installed for the TSF to reduce the risk of tailings 
supernatant affecting the groundwater. 

18.6.3 Geotechnical 

A geotechnical investigation on the tailings site indicated that the laterite was on average 1 m thick, 
followed by more than 5 m of saprolite, overlying the saprock or transition material.  Seepage 
analysis undertaken for the TSF site indicated that the saprolite provided a low permeability layer 
with an effective permeability which varied between 2.0 x 10-10 m/s for Stage 1 to 4.6 x 10-11 m/s for 
the final stage.  The unit seepage rate was calculated at 0.17 kL/ha/day for Stage 1 and 
0.07 kL/ha/day for the final stage.  These rates are lower than the Australian guideline value of 
<1 kL/ha/day, which is currently the most stringent guideline (a seepage rate of 1 kL/ha/day is 
equivalent to a base permeability of 1 x 10-9 m/s with 1 m of water head).  The seepage analysis 
further indicated that due to the low effective permeability of the layer of saprolite below the facility 
there would be minimal benefit to installing drains other than toe-drains at the embankments. 

A seismic analysis was done for the site, which indicated that the maximum credible earthquake 
would be a M5.8 shallow crustal earthquake occurring within 53 km of the site, causing peak 
ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.10 g.  Comparison with the probabilistic analysis results indicates 
this acceleration to be similar to the PGA calculated for the 1 in 20,000 year return interval.  The 
site is considered to have a low seismic hazard rating.

A dam break analysis was carried out on the TSF embankments, (see Figure 18.5.1) which 
resulted in the classification of the facility as a "High" consequence rating.  Embankment 2, which 
has the largest potential impact in the event of a failure, will be built using the downstream 
construction method to mitigate the 'high' consequence rating, while Embankment 1 and 
Embankment 3 will be built downstream for Stage 1 and centreline for subsequent stages.  The 
earthfill embankments will be constructed with engineered zones, comprising a low permeability 
upstream face with a cut-off trench extending through the laterite into the underlying saprolite, 
followed by a downstream structural zone.  For embankments of downstream geometry the 
upstream slopes will be 2H:1V, an operating downstream slope of 3H:1V and a crest width of 6 m.  
The final downstream embankment profile will consist of 3H:1V slopes with 5 m wide benches at 
10 m height intervals, producing an overall slope of 3.5H:1V for ease of rehabilitation.   

18.6.4 Operation 

Tailings will be deposited off the embankments and the north-western ridge to form a decant pond 
away from the embankments, against the ridge forming the western limit of the TSF.   

The tailings settling performance will be monitored regularly from density and flow measurements, 
and piezometers will be installed to measure the phreatic surface in the embankment to ensure the 
stability is not compromised.  Survey pins will be installed to detect potential movement of the 
embankment.  Six boreholes will be installed downstream of the embankments to monitor seepage 
from the facility (see Figure 18.5.2).  

The TSF site has a catchment area of 320 ha, which includes the tailings surface of 200 ha at full 
capacity.  Emergency spillways will be constructed for each construction stage to provide for 
events exceeding the designed storage capacity.  (If such a release occurs, the concentration of 
metals in the supernatant liquor will be diluted to such an extent as to be safe for release – see 
Section 18.5.2 above).  The spillway for the final stage will also be used as the post-closure 
spillway for the facility and will be designed to safely discharge the Probable Maximum Flood. 

At closure, the embankments will be rehabilitated and revegetated and the TSF surface will be 
covered with a layer of waste rock to prevent root growth into the tailings and finished with a soil 
layer, shaped to be free draining towards the closure spillway.

18.7 Surface Water Management 

18.7.1 Design Objectives 

The surface water management at the site will incorporate control measures in order to reduce 
impacts to downstream environments for all aspects of the Project, from initial development 
through to completion of rehabilitation.  

The main objectives of the management of surface water on the site are summarised as follows: 

� Maximising the internal recycle of contact and process waters in ore processing and 
thereby minimising the use of external water sources. 

� Minimise the impact of the proposed mining activities on the quality and quantity of 
surface water.  This is achieved by routing clean surface water runoff around disturbed 
areas and minimising sediment discharge from the site to the environment by entrapping 
and retaining eroded sediment as close as possible to disturbed areas.   

� Protect internal infrastructure and personnel from the uncontrolled effects of surface 
water runoff during storm events, thereby enhancing the safety of project personnel and 
reducing maintenance costs. 

� Provide long-term post-mining erosion and sediment control measures, including where 
practical the establishment of fully stabilised and protected final reclaimed surfaces that 
require minimal maintenance. 

The following four categories of water were identified on the site:  

� Undisturbed water (U)  Runoff from undisturbed catchments. 

� Contact clean water (CC) Runoff from disturbed catchment areas with some sediment 
pickup. 

� Contact dirty water (CD) Runoff from disturbed catchment areas with potential for 
contamination; sources include runoff from sub-ore 
stockpiles, ROM pad and plant site. 

� Process water (P) Water that has passed through the process or come into 
contact with process water. 

Based on the above classifications, the following main components are required:  

18.7.2 Diversion Structures 

It will be necessary to alter the current flow path of surface water flows to reduce the potential for 
harm to people or infrastructure or to minimise the potential for mixing clean water with runoff from 
disturbed sites.  The following structures are envisaged.

Stream Diversions 

The Vindaloo North pit will extend across one of the drainage channels feeding the water harvest 
dam.  A stream diversion will be installed to divert the flow of Undisturbed water around the 
northern tip of the pit to reduce the risk of flooding of the pit when runoff occurs.  The diversion has 
been designed to safely pass a 1 in 100 year storm event. 

Diversion Berms / Channels 

A series of diversion berms and/or channels will need to be constructed over the life of the mine, as 
development progresses, to separate Undisturbed water from other water categories at the plant 
site, ROM pad, sub-ore stockpiles, pit and waste rock dumps.   

18.7.3 Collection and Control Structures 

Runoff from areas designated as Contact Clean (CC) water and Contact Dirty (CD) water will be 
directed to Sediment Control Structures and Collection Structures, respectively.  The sediment 
control structures will provide adequate retention to allow settling of medium sized silt, but will have 
spillways to pass flows larger than 1 in 10 year recurrence interval. 

Collection Structures 

Runoff from the ROM pad and sub-ore stockpiles will be directed to a Collection Structure 
downstream of the stockpiles.  The quality of the water collected from these areas will be tested 
and the water either released to the environment after providing time for solids to settle, or pumped 
to the process plant as process water. 

Sediment Control Structures 

Runoff from CC disturbed areas such as the waste rock dumps will be collected and directed to 
one of eight proposed Sediment Control Structures to provide retention time for sediment to settle, 
before water is released to the environment.  

It is noted that the water harvest dam is situated downstream of the site in such a position that it 
will capture sediment not settled in other structures upstream thereof.  The dimensions of the water 
harvest dam are such that it would provide adequate retention time for medium sized silt (>20 μm) 
to settle.  

The position of the surface water management structures at Houndé in relation to the mining areas 
is described in the Site Water Management Report prepared by Knight Piésold (Report PE401-
00067_05, July 2013), available on request. 

18.8 Power Supply 

The National Electricity Company of Burkina Faso (SONABEL) has confirmed that the Houndé 
Gold Project demand can be met by the existing power generation and transmission network and 
SONABEL has agreed in principle to sell the project power.  However, negotiation of the means 
and final cost details has not been completed yet.

The preferred option for the high voltage supply for the Houndé Project will be a tap off from the 
existing 225 kV line interconnecting between the Kodeni and Pa substations.  Two tension towers 
will be erected at close proximity to the 225 kV line tap off point, allowing 225 kV supply to be fed to 
the Houndé switchyard. This switchyard will be located about 70 m from the process plant HV 
switchroom.  Refer to the high voltage supply option drawing 330-E-301.  (Note that while the 
preferred option of the above 225 kV connection has been used as the basis for the study, 
negotiations are continuing with SONABEL to confirm this power supply arrangement, rather than 
installing a 90 kV feeder line from the Pa substation back to the Houndé project.  Should the lower 
voltage supply from Pa be stipulated by SONABEL, then a Static VAR Compensation facility will be 
required to ensure that the mill motors can be started without adversely affecting system voltages.)  
The grid network stability analysis revealed the 225 kV supply will provide more stable operation for 
the mill drives, with only infrequent to rare power outages likely to be experienced. 

18.9 Power Distribution  

The main distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415 V for the process plant.  Refer to the power 
distribution overall plant single line drawings 330-E-302 and 330-E-303. 

The 225 kV supply will be stepped down to 11 kV via a single 225 / 11 kV, 25 / 35 MVA, ONAF 
main transformer, feeding the plant 11 kV main switchboard.  A standby transformer will be 
installed in the switchyard and put on 'soak' via the 11 kV supply.  In case of a failure of the duty 
unit, the standby unit will be relocated to the duty position to replace the defective unit during a 
relatively short outage for the transformer replacement work to be carried out.  The 11 kV supply 
will be distributed to various process plant load centres, support facilities, remote facilities and 
accommodation camp.   

A 415 V, 2.5 MVA diesel emergency generator supply with a step-up transformer has been allowed 
for the essential loads of the process plant during grid power outages.  The change over from the 
grid to the emergency power supply will be effected manually.  

The process plant load includes a SAG mill of 6 MW, a ball mill of 6 MW and an 800 kW UFG mill.  
These mills will be fed at 11 kV.  The mill drives include: 

� WRIM (Wound Rotor Induction Motors). 

� LRS (Liquid Resistor Starters) for starting. 

� Heat exchanger for speed control, in the range of 65% - 75% mill critical speed for the 
SAG mill only.  

The 415 V supply to the plant MCCs, plant buildings and remote MCCs will be fed from the plant 
11 kV main switchboard via separate 11 kV / 433 V distribution or "transformer kiosks" (HV / LV 
outdoor prefabricated substations).

The supply to the remote electrical loads such as the water harvest barrage, water storage 
barrage, accommodation camp site, boreholes and tailings dam will be taken from the mining 
services kiosk transformer via 11 kV overhead power lines constructed using steel or concrete 
poles, steel cross arms and earth shield wire, acceptable to the Local Power Authority's 
requirements / standards.  No overhead power lines will be installed within the plant perimeter 
area, and insulated cables will be installed on above ground cable ladders. 

18.9.1 Total Installed Load and Maximum Demand 

The estimated maximum power demand of the process plant is approximately 18.3 MW with a total 
connected load of 26.5 MW.  Refer to the Electrical Load List (1813.20-LST-002) for details. 

18.9.2 Electrical Substation Buildings 

The three plant electrical substation buildings will be prefabricated flat pack type construction on 
concrete columns for bottom entry cables.  The buildings will be insulated, furnished with air-
conditioners, fire detection and alarm systems, lighting and small power. 

The remote MCCs / control panels at the water storage barrage, water harvest barrage, boreholes 
and tailings dam will be installed in outdoor substations with roof covers. 

18.9.3 11 kV Switchboard 

The plant main switchboard will be metal-clad type with fully withdrawable circuit breakers 
complete with protection, metering and earthing facilities.  Protection will be provided by 
microprocessor based protection relays.  

18.9.4 Power Factor Correction Capacitor 

One unit of 11 kV power factor correction capacitor bank will be installed at the plant 11 kV main 
switchboard to correct the power factor to 0.9 or better as required by the power supply authority.  

18.9.5 Internet Fibre Optic Line 

The Project will connect to the internet via a fibre optic line from a local carrier.  The same fibre 
optic cable will be used for telephone connections, using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) for 
fixed telephone connections.  Mobile telephone services are also available in the area. 

18.10 Pipelines 

18.10.1 Tailings and Decant Return Pipelines 

The tailings pipeline will be above ground and follow the alignment of the access road to the TSF in 
a bunded zone towards the tailings storage facility to the north.  This will act as a barrier to 
movement of stormwater so there will be a need for culvert crossings under the pipeline and road. 

The pipelines will pass under the N1 Highway through dedicated culverts.

18.10.2 Water Supply Pipelines 

The HDPE pipelines from the water dams to the process plant will be laid on surface, running 
alongside the access track.  Where necessary, crossings will be provided for pedestrian, light 
vehicle traffic and livestock. 

18.11 Fuel Supply  

The largest user by far of diesel fuel will be the mining fleet, which will consume approximately 
1.5 ML/ month in the early years, rising to 1.8 ML/ month later in the mine life.  A contract will be 
entered into with a local fuel supply company for them to supply diesel fuel on a consignment basis 
and establish their own, 1 million litre storage tank on site. 

18.12 General Site Development 

18.12.1 Site Topography and Ground Conditions 

Geotechnical investigations to determine ground conditions and material properties for the various 
components of the proposed infrastructure were carried out by Knight Piésold.  The investigation 
results and geotechnical design parameters for use in design and construction of the foundations 
and earthworks are provided in the Knight Piésold Site Infrastructure Report PE13-00463 available 
on request.  The report concluded that at the tailings dam site, the ground conditions encountered 
typically comprised a shallow depth of laterite (gravel or silt) overlying saprolite (silt).  The materials 
are initially considered suitable for the construction of embankments if the design incorporates 
measures to mitigate against the dispersive nature of the soils.  Sand for drainage layers will need 
to be trucked in from local quarries or screened. 

The report also considered that the strength and stiffness characteristics of the ground are 
sufficient for the majority of the plant site's structures to be founded on shallow spread foundations.  

The topography at the Project site is generally open and undulating with the main process plant 
and mine services facilities located on ground with a gradual natural slope towards the south.  The 
plant will be inset into a cut surface with a 3 metre high western wall; this will help to reduce ground 
level noise from the plant to the community located 1 km west of the plant area. 

There are no major watercourses in the vicinity of the proposed plant site area and the surface 
water drains naturally toward the valley south east of the site. 

18.13 Sewage and Solid Waste Management 

18.13.1 Sewage Treatment 

Sewage from the accommodation camp, process plant and mining services areas will be collected 
and treated in two package sewage treatment plants.  Sludge will be suitable for direct landfill burial 
in unlined pits.  Treated effluent from the accommodation camp will be discharged to a leach field 
or a surface spray field at a location to be agreed, while the treated effluent from the plant site and 
mining services area will be discharged into the tails hopper.

18.13.2 Solid Wastes 

General solid wastes will be deposited into a landfill, in accordance with local regulations, but 
dangerous materials such as cyanide packaging, will be incinerated on site to prevent unauthorised 
use.  Other materials unsuited to landfill will be stored on site for later disposal. 

18.14 Explosive Storage and Handling 

A contract will be entered into with a recognised supplier of mining explosives, to establish his own 
facilities in the southern end of the eastern waste dump, well away from the local population and 
mine activities, and to supply emulsion as needed. 

18.15 Accommodation Camp  

It is anticipated that a significant proportion of the workforce will be recruited from and continue to 
reside in Houndé town; however, permanent accommodation to house 130 senior operations and 
mining workforce personnel will be provided approximately one kilometre to the north of the 
process plant for expatriates and personnel from outside the local district.  The camp will be 
accessed from a new road that links to the mine access road.   

The village will have a mix of building types with blockwork construction on concrete slabs and 
steel trussed roofs for the larger rooms reserved for management, whilst converted sea containers 
will be used for the junior staff rooms.  All buildings will be single storey. 

For fit-out and finishes within buildings, preference will be given to locally available equipment and 
materials subject to availability and quality constraints. 

18.16 Process Plant Facilities 

18.16.1 General 

The process plant support facilities will generally be industrial type structures constructed of a 
concrete slab on ground with structural steel frame and metal cladding.  Office and amenity areas 
associated with the main structures will generally be of blockwork construction.   

The process plant and its support facilities are shown in Figure 18.16.1.

18.16.4 Other Support Facilities 

Water Services 

Raw water will be pumped to the plant site from the water harvest and storage dams and will 
discharge into the raw water tank for distribution around the plant. 

Fire water for the process plant will be drawn from the raw water tank.  Suctions for other water 
services fed from the raw water tank will be at an elevated level to ensure a fire water reserve 
always remains in the raw water tank.  

Fire hydrants and hose reels will be placed throughout the process plant, fuel storage and plant 
offices at intervals that ensure complete coverage in areas where flammable materials are present. 

Raw water directly from bores, will be supplied to the plant potable water treatment plant for 
filtration, ultra-violet sterilisation and chlorination.  Potable water will be reticulated to the plant 
buildings, site ablutions, safety showers and other potable water outlets.  Additional ultra-violet 
sterilisation units will be installed on outgoing potable water distribution headers.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Market Studies 

No project-specific marketing studies were undertaken for the Feasibility Study.  The planned CIL 
processing will produce gold doré bullion that is a fungible commodity for which an efficient global 
market exists.  It is of high value density meaning that the realised price of the contained gold is 
insensitive to the ultimate location of the customer and refinery as freight costs are negligible in 
comparison to contained value. 

Refinery terms of 99.5% payable gold in doré bullion and a refining charge of $3.35 per ounce that 
were used are typical of current terms being offered for CIL produced gold doré bullion. 

19.2 Pricing 

Based on review, the long term gold pricing forecast used for the design of the mining project at 
$1,300 per ounce is consistent with gold prices being used in similar publicly released studies.  A 
common standard is to use the three year-trailing average of the gold price, which in this case is 
approximately $1,450 per ounce. 

The pricing for sensitivity options and economic evaluation utilized $1,000, $1,200 and $1,400 per 
ounce to be consistent with recent market fluctuations (Figure 19.2.1).  In addition, the mining pit 
optimisation process considered the case for $1,600 per ounce. 

Figure 19.2.1 Historical gold prices 

19.3 Contracts 

No contracts for the sale of the production have been entered into.

20.0 REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Concurrent with this feasibility report, two ESIA studies and a RAP (Resettlement Action Plan) 
study were carried out by Genivar Inc., INGRID and SOCREGE.  This section of the report 
summarizes the key elements of these studies and cost details.  Copies of these supporting reports 
will be available on request. 

Endeavour's goal is to adhere to both Burkina Faso and IFC standards for the Social and 
Environmental activities and reporting associated with the Houndé Project. 

20.1 Environmental Studies and Permitting 

Baseline studies were carried out over a period of nine months to prepare an inventory of data on 
the physical, biological and socio-economic environments prior to the development of the project.  
Where seasonal variation was expected, multiple sampling of the environmental feature was 
undertaken. 

The biological environment lacked flora and fauna diversity as a consequence of existing activities 
including agriculture, grazing of livestock and artisanal gold mining in the area. 

The human environment was dominated by traditional community structures and a low level of 
development based on a cash crop and subsistence economy.  The presence of a highway (RN1) 
adjacent to the site resulted in a number of houses being located in close proximity to the mine site.  
A trunk line for electricity distribution is also located parallel to the highway alignment. 

Studies were also completed to establish the effects of noise and vibration arising from the project 
on the local communities as well as the quality of the air in the locality of the site.  These suggested 
that the ambient air quality contained high background levels of dust and the noise environment, 
particularly in areas close to RN1, was quite noisy with noise levels close to existing IFC limits in a 
number of locations.  

Water sampling was carried out on a number of local streams, wells and boreholes to identify the 
overall quality of water.  On average the water quality is slightly acidic and pH of water at individual 
sites may be lower than the low limit in the WHO standards.  Many of the surface water and well 
sites exceeded turbidity limits and a few sites had iron, chromium and manganese levels in excess 
of the WHO standard. 

To date, there have been no environmental issues that would materially impact the ability of Avion 
Gold being able to extract the mineral reserves in the area, once the environmental permit has 
been granted. 

The key environmental issues identified include: 

� Water supply for the mine;  

� TSF location and post-closure land use;  

� Transport and management of hazardous materials;

� Proximity of infrastructure (road, power line and optic fibre cable); 

� Potential for in-migration and its effect on level of service in public infrastructure; 

� Allowance for traditional grazing patterns; and 

� Resettlement and reallocation of land. 

The key environmental permit required by the project is the environmental certificates from the 
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MEED) which will follow submission of the 
EIA and RAP. 

Following receipt of the environmental certificate it is expected that a number of secondary 
approvals may need to be sought in relation to specific elements of the project: 

� Dam licences for the operation of the water dams as described in Decree No. 2005-
193/PRES/PM/MAHRH/MFB of 4 April 2005 and the tailings storage facility; 

� Licences to store hazardous materials as described in Decree No. 98-
322/PRES/PM/MEE/MCIA/MEM/MS/MATS/METSS/MEF of 28 July 1998 including: 

- Fuel 
- Explosives
- Cyanide and 
- Lime.

� Licences for importation of cyanide and ammonium nitrate; 

� Licence or approval to remove materials from stream beds as described in Decree No. 
2006-588 / PRES / PM / MAHRH / MECV / MPAD / MFB / MS of 6 December 2006; 

� Approval of land use and water management plans as described in Decree No. 2005-
192/PRES/PM/MAHRH/MFB of 4 April 2005; 

� Approval for widening of the RN1 and development of the rural roads from the Ministry of 
Infrastructure Road Development and Transport;

20.2 Anticipated Environmental Costs – Operations 

The anticipated operational costs would normally comprise four components: 

� Costs associated with maintaining compliance of the operation with environmental 
legislation, regulations and licenses;  

� Costs associated with monitoring according to international codes;  

� This costs associated with management of incidental factors; and 

� Costs associated with community and social development and accommodation of loss of 
amenity to the community. 

Costs associated with re-vegetation and site rehabilitation are not included as, given the short mine 
life, it is proposed that these are included in closure costs. 

The costs are developed on the following basis: 

� The site will retain three full-time environmental and social professionals and one 
environmental technician, including an expatriate lead; 

� Those personnel will be responsible for undertaking all monitoring associated with 
implementation of the ESMP during the operational life of the mine; 

� All sample testing would be undertaken off-site; 

� Field monitoring equipment would be acquired as part of the capital expenditure for the 
project; 

� Any works associated with mitigation of amenity loss to the community would be 
undertaken by local community members as part of a community development project; 
and 

� Costs associated with community development would not exceed 2% of the net profit of 
the mine. 

The overall costs associated with environmental management during the operational phase are 
estimated to be US$485,000/year, dependent on yearly operational budgets, based on the 
following:

� Staffing costs of $175,000. 

� Water quality testing = $43,000 based on quarterly monitoring of surface water.  

� Noise / vibration / air quality monitoring = $13,500 based on one site visit for monitoring. 

� TSF monitoring = $13,500 based on monthly surface water sampling.

� Biological monitoring = $36,000 per year for 2 seasonal surveys. 

� Social monitoring = $54,000 based on one annual survey to monitor social change and 
impact of community development expenditure. 

� Community development = $150,000 for community donations with money spent where a 
local committee of consisting of an Endeavour representative, community leaders and 
regional government representatives decide. 

Of these costs, the Community Development and Staffing costs (total $325,000) have been 
included in the General and Administration charges as described in Section 21, while the remaining 
monitoring costs (total $160,000) have been allowed in the cash flow model in Section 22. 

Trialling and monitoring of closure and rehabilitation methods to ensure the efficacy of the methods 
prior to implementation of closure works, will be carried on over the life of the mine. 

20.3 Social and Community Impact 

The information and stakeholder consultation process was an integral part of the EIA process.  In 
this regard, since the start of the study, Avion Gold has put in place a mechanism for gathering 
information and consulting the communities, throughout this process.  The information gathered 
was used to better identify and target issues, to minimize the negative impacts and enhance the 
positive.  A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (PEPP) and various information tools have also been 
developed for this purpose.  A list of stakeholders was also developed and updated throughout the 
information and consultation process.  Information about the project was disseminated through 
radio and a bilingual information leaflet (French and Dioula) has been given to administrative, 
technical services and representatives of the affected villages. 

As part of this information and consultation process, numerous meetings were held with 
stakeholders. The main concerns raised during the information and consultation activities were as 
follows: 

� Youth employment at the mine; 

� The process of resettlement of affected populations so that they regain their previous 
standard of living; 

� Security issues related to mining operations; 

� The water supply of the mine (and its potential impact on watersheds and water supply to 
nearby villages); 

� The rehabilitation of the site following the eventual closure of the mine; 

� The Project's impacts on infrastructure and administrative buildings; 

� Concerns about the presence of the 225 kV high voltage power line between Kadéni and 
Pa which is located near the site, in addition to the RN1 and a fibre optic line;

� The impact of the Project on the classified area Houndé forests; 

� The impact of mining activities on the health of workers and local communities; 

� The impact of mining activities on the artisanal gold mining activities; 

� The occurrence of certain health problems; and 

� The disturbance / degradation of morals. 

Social and community impacts will arise in a number of key areas including: 

� Loss of land; 

� Loss of access to grazing; 

� Inability to work on the mine site due to demographic, social and cultural restrictions; 

� In-migration of skilled labour; and 

� Development of local enterprises servicing the mine. 

The most significant impact is likely to be the increased levels of income that arise from sources 
such as: 

� Wages and salaries earned; 

� Compensation received from loss of land; and 

� Payments for services from local small businesses. 

The increased levels of income will advantage those in receipt of the payments but adversely affect 
those who have not had the advantage, directly or indirectly of those increases in income. 

The key offsets available will be those arising from training of people who cannot immediately seek 
or gain employment on the mine to give them skills required to gain benefit from the mine indirectly, 
through service supply. 

The community development programme will also contribute to reduction of the social impact.

20.4 Anticipated Land Acquisition and Relocation Costs 

The mine will need to acquire 2,096 ha to provide space for the open pit, processing plant, waste 
piles, TSF, water harvest dam and water storage dam, as well as the necessary roads.  However, 
most access roads will use existing pathways and upgrade them as necessary.  As well, a 
250 metre wide health perimeter around the existing infrastructure has been delineated to ensure 
that those that may be impacted by the mine the most (dust, noise etc.), have the option of 
receiving compensation and moving to another area.  A further compensation perimeter, 
designated as a mitigated 50 dB(A) night time sound perimeter has also been delineated to provide 
a mechanism for those impacted by the mine noise the option of being compensated and moved to 
another location further from the mine. 

In order to evaluate what fair compensation entails, a detailed study of the local inhabitants, cultural 
property, land use, land productivity, trees, replacement land, local businesses and replacement 
structures was carried out by SOCREGE under the supervision of Genivar.  In conjunction with this 
study, Endeavour also reviewed land productivity, crop selection, yearly crop prices and crop 
selection.  This work then provided a range of compensation options dependent on the individual 
compensation circumstances.  For this study, fair baseline compensation was determined for the 
following major items: 

� For farm land 

- a combination of cash and crop compensation that totals up to 5 years crop 
value at Houndé regional productivity for a particular farm plot 

- access to replacement land if desired. 

� For habitations and out buildings 

- replacement with same or better homes in an area of their choosing with a 
study bias toward the nearby community of Houndé 

- cash or in-kind compensation for out buildings that would not be used any more. 

� Cultural property (graves, ceremonial sites, archaeological sites and household fetishes) 

- mixture of ceremony fees and direct cash compensation. 

� Re-establishment costs. 

� Cash compensation or re-planting for crop trees and other trees. 

� Cash compensation for small businesses in the impact zone. 

The process of determining the appropriate level of compensation is still proceeding with total 
compensation levels ranging from $6.2 million to $15.8 million.  For the purpose of this study, an 
overall compensation level of $12.0 million was chosen.  Details for the various compensatory 
items are contained in the Resettlement Action Plan study.

20.5 Anticipated Cost – Closure 

The estimate cost of closure is US$26,384,000 (see Table 21.3.7, including Contingency).  This 
cost is based on a combination of resale, reuse, recovery and rehabilitation options for the facilities 
as described in earlier Sections.  The biggest single cost will be the cost of closure of the tailings 
storage facilities.  This cost does not include provision for ongoing monitoring that may be required 
after closure and rehabilitation works have been completed.  It is expected these could require 
ongoing monitoring of US$175,000/y, if required by the regulatory authorities prior to acceptance of 
relinquishment.

The objective of the mine closure will be to provide landforms that can be utilized by the community 
without liability to the community to generate an ecologically sustainable landscape post-mining.  
The present dependence of the community on cash crops and subsistence farming suggests that 
the closed mine should provide landforms which are capable of being grazed by animals or 
supporting annual or perennial crops.  Given the sensitivity to water availability in the area, any 
water dams should be retained for use by the community and any water management structures 
that can increase water storage capacity for the community would be seriously considered. 

Any saleable items will be recovered from the site.  Buildings and infrastructure will be offered to 
the community for use and any materials suitable for recycling will be sold. 

All contaminated land will be remediated either by placement of a soil / rock cover system over the 
area (such as with the TSF) or through removal of the contaminated material to a designated 
landfill area and replacement of the soil with rock waste and a topsoil cover. 

Provision has been made to batter down waste rock dumps and cover their surfaces with topsoil 
collected during the construction and operations phase.  Waste dumps will then be reseeded with 
local plant species to provide both a vegetated cover to control wind and water erosion and support 
any beneficial uses identified by the local community. 

The pit voids will be left open but surrounded by a protective bund, outside the zone of instability, to 
ensure entry by vehicles will be hindered. 

A rehabilitation fund is required to be set up upon opening of the mine.  The funding for the 
rehabilitation fund will be set up to match total material movement in the mine with $0.10 /tonne 
mined added to the fund annually.  Using this methodology, the closing balance will be 
$23.3 million, which will be topped up to $26.4 million (includes contingency) at closure.  The 
details of the rehabilitation costs are as follows: 

� Tailings - $ 14,505,000 (see table 20.5.1). 

� Water pipeline removal - $60,300. 

� Mining Services – wash bay demolition = $13,440. 

� Process Plant demolition - $4,953,000 

- demolish and sell steelwork structure

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Mining Cost Estimates 

Orelogy has estimated mining costs for the project on an Owner operated basis as summarised in 
Table 21.1.1. 

Costs were built up from first principles in a detailed cost model utilising: 

1. Heavy equipment capital and operating costs sourced from the relevant Original 
Equipment Supplier (OEM) during 3rd quarter 2013. 

2. Productivity and equipment hours generated by EVORELUTION mine scheduling and 
haulage optimisation software, based on reasonable working productivity assumptions.  

3. Personnel, fuel and power costs in line with those utilised by Lycopodium for the 
processing cost estimation. 

21.1.1 Estimate Basis and Qualifications 

The various cost items were then applied to the physicals of the LoM schedule to develop a mining 
cashflow schedule over the life of the operation.  Mine scheduling work has been based on 
300 tonne excavators loading 140 tonne trucks supported by a medium sized ancillary fleet. 

The capital cost provided by the OEM is inclusive of sea freight and delivery to the Houndé site. 
Additional allowances for the following have been included: 

� Additional equipment (e.g. water tanks for water truck). 

� First fill spares component at 1% of F.O.B cost. 

� Initial truck tires are included in the capital expenditure, and the costs of subsequent tires 
are allocated to the operating cost. 

A fuel price of $1.312/L was used for pre-production and this was increased to $1.40/L for LoM.

21.2 Process Plant and Administration 

21.2.1 Summary 

Process plant and administration operating costs have been developed by Lycopodium and 
Endeavour based on a design treatment rate of 3.0 Mt/y of ore with the plant operating 24 hours 
per day, 365 days per year with a 91.3% plant utilisation (nominal 8,000 hours per year) and a P80
grind size of 90 μm. 

The operating cost estimate has been compiled from a variety of sources and is based on the Life 
of Mine (LOM) blend of 82% primary, 11% transition and 7% saprolite ores and a head grade of 
2.0 g/t Au ore. 

Operating costs are presented in United States dollars (US$) and are based on prices obtained 
during the third quarter of 2013, to an accuracy of ±15%.  The process plant operating costs for the

LOM blend are summarised in Table 21.2.1, by oxidation level in Table 21.2.2, and chart form in 
Figure 21.2.1. 

The operating cost estimate is based on the transition and primary ore utilising all unit operations 
including gravity concentration, concentrate ultra fine grinding (UFG) and concentrate leach.  The 
saprolite ore operating cost excludes the gravity and concentrate circuits.

21.3 Capital Cost Estimate 

21.3.1 Summary 

Lycopodium has prepared capital cost estimates for the project which are summarised as shown in 
Table 21.3.2.  Mining costs were supplied by Orelogy, while Lycopodium compiled the remainder of 
the estimate, with quantities for infrastructure earthworks (TSF, water dams, surface water 
management structures) provided by Knight Piésold.  

The exchange rates shown in Table 21.3.1 have been used in the preparation of the estimates.  
The table also shows the proportion of each currency used in the estimate. 

The estimate accuracy is considered to be ±15%, as at 3Q2013. 

Mining capital costs include the procurement and assembly of the mining fleet, detailed mine 
planning and prestripping operations needed to open up sufficient ore to be able to meet the mill 
demand once processing commences.  The mining schedule indicates that three months of 
prestripping will be required.

21.3.2 Estimating Methodology 

General arrangement drawings and a layout 3D model have been produced with sufficient detail to 
permit the assessment of the engineering quantities for earthworks, concrete, steelwork, 
mechanical and electrical for the crushing plant, processing plant, conveying systems and 
infrastructure.  The layouts and model have been based on recently completed facility designs, 
modified construction and as-built drawings of past project facilities, as well as initial concept 
drawings and computer modelling. 

Unit rates that reflect the current market conditions have been established for bulk materials, 
capital equipment and labour via an extensive Budget Quotation Request (BQR) process.  Labour 
rates from the market have been benchmarked against in-house labour gang rates and indirect 
cost modelling to ensure adherence suitability to the current projects market.  The rates used in the 
estimate have been reviewed and deemed to reflect the current market conditions.  Budget pricing 
for equipment and infrastructure facilities was obtained from suitable suppliers and contractors. 

The derivation of quantities is provided in Table 21.3.3, weighted by value of the direct permanent 
works (i.e. excluding temporary works, construction services, commissioning assistance, EPCM 
costs, escalation and contingency).

Estimate pricing was derived from a combination of the following sources: 

� Budget Quotation – Budget pricing solicited specifically for the study or project estimate. 

� Database – Historical database pricing that is less than 6 months old. 

� Estimated – Historical database pricing older than 6 months, escalated to the current 
estimate base date. 

� Factored – Factored from costs with a basis. 

The source of pricing by major commodity is summarised in Table 21.3.4, weighted by value of the 
direct permanent works (excluding temporary works, construction services, commissioning 
assistance, EPCM costs and contingency), including supply and installation.

Pricing has been categorised by the following cost elements, as applicable, for the development of 
each estimate item. 

Bulk Materials 

This component covers all other materials, normally purchased in bulk form, for installation on the 
project.  Costs include the purchase price ex-works, any off-site fabrication, and transport to site 
(unless otherwise stated), and over-supply for anticipated wastage.  

Plant Equipment 

This component represents prefabricated, pre-assembled, off-the-shelf types of mechanical or 
electrical equipment item.  Pricing is inclusive of all costs necessary to purchase the goods ex-
works; generally excluding delivery to site (unless otherwise stated) but including operating and 
maintenance manuals.  Vendor representation and commissioning spares have been allowed for 
separately in the estimate.  

Installation

This component represents the cost to install the plant equipment and bulk materials on site or to 
perform site activities.  Installation costs are further divided between direct labour, equipment and 
contractors' indirect costs. 

The labour component reflects the cost of the direct workforce required to construct the Project 
scope.  The labour cost is the product of the estimated work hours spent on site multiplied by the 
cost of labour to the contractor inclusive of overtime premiums, statutory overheads, payroll burden 
and contractor margin. 

The equipment component reflects the cost of the construction equipment and running costs 
required to construct the Project.  The equipment cost also includes cranes, vehicles, small tools, 
consumables, PPE and the applicable contractor's margin. 

Contractors' indirect costs encompass the remaining cost of installation and include items such as 
offsite management, onsite staff and supervision above trade level, crane drivers, mobilisation and 
demobilisation, Rest and Recreation (R&R), meals and accommodation costs, and the applicable 
contractors' margin.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd

The labour gang rates, equipment and contractor's indirect costs estimated for each major trade 
commodity are shown in Table 21.3.5. 

Table 21.3.5 Standard Direct Labour Gang Rates 

Item Direct Labour $ Equipment $ Total Hourly Rate $ 

Concrete Installation 5.00 2.00 7.00
SMP 15.00 8.00 23.00 
Field Erected Tanks 15.00 8.00 23.00 
Building Installation 12.50 5.00 17.50 
Electrical & Instrumentation 8.20 12.00 20.20 

Generally, for bulk commodities the lowest cost vendor and contractor rates were used in the 
estimate. 

Freight

The freight estimate was derived: 

� from the assessment of freight tonnes or bulk volume and number of containers from the 
quantities derived in the capital cost estimate and vendor supplied shipping lists and 
advice 

� from the most likely country of origin 

� from the application of rates used for recent similar projects for pre-shipment, ocean 
freight and post-shipment overland freight. 

21.3.3 Field Indirect Costs 

Project construction offices and establishment, communications, computers, IT services, servers 
and telephones are included in the capital estimate.  Construction services such as power, water, 
fuel, consumables and personal protection equipment (PPE) are included. 

The estimate includes costs for meals and accommodation for senior staff over the construction 
duration. 

The capital estimate includes the cost of local indirect labour for installation support. 

Contractor indirect costs for all direct labour is included in the installation rates for all works in the 
capital estimate.  This is inclusive of meals, accommodation, PPE, flights and clothing.  Earthworks 
rates are inclusive of fuel, maintenance and running costs of machinery also. 

Construction fuel facilities will be provided by the individual construction contractors. 

Construction equipment and project cranes (excluding heavy lift craneage) are included in the 
capital cost estimate.

21.3.4 EPCM Services 

The estimate for Engineering Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) services costs 
has been based on a preliminary manning schedule for the anticipated project deliverables and 
project schedule.  The resulting EPCM cost estimate is consistent with other projects of this nature 
in terms of the percentage of the direct costs. 

The engineering design component of the EPCM estimate for the home office is based on a 
calculation of required manning levels to complete the Project and benchmarked against previous 
Lycopodium experience on similar projects. 

21.3.5 Owner's Costs 

As part of the construction, Endeavour will provide a Project management team.  

The Owner's construction team will interact closely with operations management personnel 
recruited during the construction phase of the Project.  

Endeavour has successfully developed several projects in the West African region and has elected 
to procure the mills and free-issue these to the EPCM contractor, as well as supervising much of 
the earthworks and infrastructure works to the EPCM contractor's design.  Because of this 
approach, the Owners' cost allowances in the above estimates are relatively high compared with a 
"pure" EPCM approach. 

In addition to the above, the following allowances have been made in the estimate. 

� Owners project expenses. 

� Pre-production costs. 

� First fills (grinding media, lubricants, fuel, and reagents). 

� Opening stocks. 

� Plant mobile equipment. 

� Project spares. 

� Vendor representative and training costs for the process plant. 

� Asset management system implementation, training and software. 

� Crop compensation and resettlement costs for the first year of construction. 

� Connection to the power grid and associated engineering costs. 

� Environmental cost allowance. 

� Working capital.

Spares and Insurances 

An agreed allowance has been included for spares.  Project insurances have been included, based 
on advice from Endeavour. 

21.3.6 Contingency 

An amount of contingency has been provided in the estimate to cover anticipated variances 
between the specific items allowed in the estimate and the final total installed project cost.  The 
contingency does not cover scope changes, design growth, etc., or the listed qualifications and 
exclusions. 

Contingency has been applied to the estimate on a line-by-line basis as a deterministic allowance 
by assessing the level of confidence in each of the defining inputs to the item cost, these being 
engineering, estimate basis and vendor or contractor information, and then applying an appropriate 
weighting to each of the three inputs.  It should be noted that contingency is not a function of the 
specified estimate accuracy and should be measured against the project total that includes 
contingency.   

A summary of contingency percentage for the major horizontal packages is provided in

� Prices of materials and equipment with an imported content have been converted to US$ 
at the rates of exchange stated previously in this document.  All pricing received has 
been entered in its native currency. 

� Contractor rates include for mobilisation / demobilisation, recurring costs, direct and 
indirect labour, construction equipment, construction cranes up to 80 t, materials, 
materials handling and offloading, temporary storage, construction facilities, off site costs, 
insurances, flights, construction fuel, tools, consumables, meals and PPE. 

� Endeavour will provide a heavy lift crawler crane (+100 t) for project construction.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd

� The bulk commodity rates that include for imported material are based on the assumption 
that suitable construction / fill materials will be available from borrow pits within 2,000 m 
of the work fronts.

� The estimate includes for the placement and compaction of fill material to the crushing 
chamber wall to a horizontal distance of 3 metres only.  ROM pad earthworks 
construction costs have been allowed in the mining cost estimate. 

� The estimate allows for all reinforced bar and mesh for construction to be provided by the 
concrete contractor.  Free issue of materials would be a project capital opportunity and 
has not been allowed at this time. 

� There is no allowance for unforeseen blasting in the bulk earthworks cost estimates, 
given the results of the site geotechnical investigation.  There is an allowance for part of 
the bulk earthworks balance to be imported fill in the unforeseen event that the in-place 
material is unsuitable. 

� Mobilisation / demobilisation of a roadworks contractor has not been allowed as it is 
assumed the plant earthworks contractor can complete the works.  Duration costs have 
been included. 

� The estimate allows for supply of structural steel and minor platework from South East 
Asia.  The rates for structural steel supply are based on recent project costs. 

� The estimate allows for one piece tanks and large platework items to be fabricated in 
country as the freight cost for these items from South East Asia makes this option 
uneconomical. 

� Supply and installation of field erected tanks will be by a suitable in-country contractor.  
There is no allowance for free issue of strakes and materials to the installation contractor.  
This is a project capital opportunity and has not been included at this time. 

� Supply of construction and potable water prior to completion of the water harvest dam will 
be from the existing site supply.  The capital includes for the mechanical costs and 
installation of one additional bore pump at the location of the permanent village; however, 
there is no allowance to drill and case a bore in the estimate.  The locations of the 
additional bores have not been defined at this time and the cost of establishing further 
water sources is not included. 

� The supply of the SAG and Ball mills has been included in Owner's costs. 

� The estimate excludes for a construction camp.  The permanent camp will be constructed 
as early as practical and until such time as it is available for use, construction personnel 
will be accommodated in Houndé town. 

� Owner's mobile equipment for construction and operations is included.

� Asset management software for operations is allowed for in the capital estimate.  
Software implementation and training costs are included.  

� There is an allowance for surveying to be performed by the Owner's team. 

� Mining contractor facilities are included in the capital costs. 

21.3.9 Exclusions 

The following items are specifically excluded from the capital cost estimate: 

� Permits and licences (except as listed). 

� Project sunk costs (these are addressed in the financial model. 

� Government and import taxes and duties (these are addressed in the financial model). 

� Exchange rate variations. 

� Escalation. 

21.4 Project Implementation 

21.4.1 Implementation Strategy 

The cost estimates have been complied on the basis that Endeavour will adopt an EPCM 
approach, in which a small Owner's team will manage several specialist engineers and consultants, 
who will carry out the detailed engineering, procure the equipment and fabricated items and 
manage the installation contracts.  The EPCM engineer will be appointed on a schedule of rates 
basis, this arrangement permitting Endeavour to have maximum input to the quality of engineering 
and equipment procured for the project with a minimum Owner's team and securing the services of 
specialist designers and project management expertise. 

21.4.2 Implementation Schedule 

The project implementation schedule has been developed on the basis that no early procurement 
works will be conducted – i.e., that engineering will only commence after full project approval has 
been secured from the Board.  A high level schedule has been prepared on this basis and is shown 
in Figure 21.4.1.  The overall duration of the project from Board Approval to first gold is estimated 
to be 21 months.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd

The project critical path shown in Figure 21.4.2 runs from the award of the EPCM contract through 
the process and detailed design to mill building structural steel supply, erection of the milling 
building and installation of the equipment before final completion of the piping and electrical 
activities to allow commissioning to proceed.  The schedule is based on purchase orders for the 
SAG, ball and UFG mills being placed immediately the project is approved; if these orders are 
delayed, the critical path then shifts to the mills procurement and delivery.  The mining fleet and HV 
power equipment also require engineering and procurement activities to commence immediately on 
project approval in order to meet the overall schedule of 21 months.

21.4.3 HSEC Management 

The management of health and safety as well as the environment and local community (HSEC) are 
critical for any successful project development.  The EPCM Engineer will develop a project 
management plan to address these issues, based on their standard procedures, project 
construction experience and the risks and hazards identified during the feasibility and design 
stages, all through the project construction to commissioning and hand-over. 

21.4.4 Logistics 

Equipment will be sourced from vendors on the basis of price and delivery; such vendors typically 
fabricate components in many different countries.  Fabricated steelwork and platework will be 
sourced from Africa or SE Asia, again on the basis of price, delivery and quality. The EPCM 
engineer will engage a logistics and transport coordinator to consolidate freight items where 
possible and facilitate clearance through customs and transport to site.  Where practical, 
containerised items will be transported by rail, with the remainder transported to site by truck.  
Oversize loads will receive special attention and escorts as applicable. 

21.4.5 Training

22.3 Principal Assumptions 

The cash flow analysis is based on the following: 

Basis of Estimate 

� Annual tonnage, strip ratio and head grade have been based on the mining schedule as 
discussed in Section 16. 

� The mining, processing and administration costs are based on the operating cost 
estimate discussed in Section 21. 

� The overall recovery figures are based on testwork.  Metallurgical recovery is discussed 
in Section 17. 

� The capital cost estimate used as basis for the cash flow model is discussed in 
Section 21. 

� The treatment of depreciation and company taxes are based on the understanding of 
current Burkinian tax law. 

Depreciation 

� Provision has been made for depreciation using a straight line method for a period of 
4 years.  

� The schedule allows for $30 million of losses carried forward at the start of the operation. 

� In the final year of operation, the residual capital allowance outstanding is depreciated 
against the salvage value of the plant. 

Company Tax 

� Provision has been made for company tax at 17.5% of gross profit.  This is the rate of 
corporate tax in Burkina Faso. 

� Tax losses that can be carried forward have been ignored 

Gold Price 

� A gold price of $1,300 per ounce is assumed based on advice from Endeavour. 

� A refinery gold payable rate of 99.95% is assumed. 

� The refining charge of $3.35 per ounce of gold was advised by Endeavour to include the 
cost of transport and insurance of the gold from site to the refinery.

October 2013 
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd

Royalties 

� Royalties are allowed at 4.0% of revenue for the Burkina Faso Government and 2.0% for 
African Barrick. 

General 

� The cash flow model assumes full equity funding. 

� No provision has been made for interest or cost of capital. 

� No provision has been made for escalation or inflation, other than to allow for labour 
costs to increase by 3% as from Year 4, which represents an apprentice surcharge levied 
by the government of Burkina Faso at the mid-point of the mine life. 

� Closure and reclamation costs have been allowed as an annual contribution to a Trust 
Fund of $0.10 per tonne of material mined over the life of the mine, with a top-up 
payment at the end to cover the estimate total costs of rehabilitation. 

� No provision has been made for additional taxation or costs related to the repatriation of 
funds from Burkina Faso. 

� The NPV calculation is based on payments occurring at the end of each period.  The cost 
of the first year is discounted, based on the assumption that there will be some delay in 
spending the capital from present. 

� Working capital has been included in the capital cost estimate. 

� Allowance has been made in the capital costs for Import Duties at the rate of 2.5% on an 
amount of $180 million, representing an approximate value of the goods and services to 
be imported.   

� An allowance for Import Duties has also been made in the operating cost schedule of 
7.5% on 50% of the operating costs for mining, processing and G&A. 

� The cash flow calculations have been prepared on an annual basis; where shorter 
periods have been used in the mining schedules, these have been totalised to annual 
costs based on Project years. 

22.4 Processing Costs and Production Schedules 

22.4.1 Mine Production Schedule 

Annual tonnage, strip ratio and head grade is based on the mining schedule developed by Orelogy 
(refer to Section 16). 



HOUNDÉ GOLD PROJECT, BURKINA FASO

The mining schedule assumes three months of pre-strip prior to the start of production.  The 
schedule allows for mining and stockpiling of ore to provide more consistent mill feed.  The 
stockpile varies from a high of 0.5 Mt at the end of Year 4 to a low of 40 kt in Years 5 and 6 with an 
average of 0.23 Mt.  During the last years of production, stockpiled low grade material will be 
treated, allowing for just over 9 years of mill production.  Figure 22.4.1 shows the mining schedule 
upon which the cash flow model is based, while the processing plant feed tonnages are indicated in 
Figure 22.4.2.

22.4.2 Operating Cost 

Figure 22.4.3 presents the contribution of mining cost, processing cost, general and administration 
cost.  This does not include smelting and refining costs, rehabilitation and closure costs which are 
incurred at the end of production or royalties. 

Figure 22.4.3 Operating Cost Contribution (US$/oz Recovered & %) 

Capital Cost 

The capital estimates are detailed in Section 21.  Table 22.4.1 shows the annual capital cost 
schedule used as the basis for the cash flow model. 

Owner's Cost 

The Owner's project cost includes the cost of procuring the mills as well as the costs for carrying 
out the earthworks contracts, land acquisition and resettlement costs.  

Deferred Capital Cost 

Deferred and sustaining capital costs cover the requirements for mining fleet expansion and 
equipment replacement over the life of the mine, as well as development costs for new pits.  

The TSF embankments will need to be raised regularly over the life of the mine and costs are 
allowed for these raisings; at the end of the mine life, the TSF must be rehabilitated and costs are 
allowed for this action, which is described in Section 18. 

Sustaining capital has also been allowed to replace mobile equipment and IT systems needed for 
the processing plant and administrative services and final rehabilitation of the processing facilities 
at the end of the mine life.

Working Capital 

The Owner's Operations Costs cover the working capital requirements for four weeks until revenue 
is received from the first bullion shipment.  No allowance has been made to recover the working 
capital at the end of the mine life. 

Plant Salvage 

An allowance has been made for salvage of the mining equipment and process plant, for a nominal 
value of $5 million.

22.5 Outcomes 

22.5.1 Base Case  

At a gold price of $1,300 per ounce and full equity funding, the Project is estimated to have an 
after-tax IRR of 22.45% and a pay-back period of 2.84 years.  At a discount rate of 5.0%, the after-
tax NPV of this scenario is estimated at $230.2 million. 

Cash Flow Analysis 

The undiscounted annual cash flow is summarised in Table 22.5.1.  This shows that the project is 
expected to be cash flow positive from the first year of operation, while project payback is achieved 
at the end of year 2.  The undiscounted net present value of the project (after tax) is $364.2 million.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

23.1 Overall Location 

Currently, large portions of the Houndé greenstone belt are covered by exploration licenses, held 
mostly by Canadian and Australian companies.  Four advanced exploration projects, one 
exploration project and one operating mine are described in the following sections.  The relative 
locations of the concession blocks, are shown in Figure 23.1.1.

23.2 Yaramoko – Roxgold Inc. 

The Yaramoko property is controlled by Canadian listed Roxgold Inc.  The property lies 
approximately 40 km northeast of the Vindaloo zone, along the eastern edge of the Houndé 
volcanic belt.  The deposit is structurally controlled and hosted by a mixture of granite and volcanic 
rock.  According to a presentation from April, 2013 the property hosts 639,951 ounces Indicated 
Mineral Resources at 19.3 g/t Au and 183,894 ounces Inferred Mineral Resources at 11.5 g/t Au at 
a 5 g/t Au cut-off.  This Mineral Resource estimate is based on 216 holes to a depth of 800 metres.  
A PEA is due in Q3, 2013. 

23.3 Houndé South – Savory Capital Corp. 

The Houndé South property is controlled by Canadian-listed Savory Capital Corp. (Savory).  This 
property is optioned from Endeavour Mining.  In order to earn a 100% interest in the property, 
Savory needs to spend $3 million on exploration by mid May, 2014 and give Endeavour shares 
totalling up to an interest of 19.9% of the company.  The property is located approximately 45 km 
southwest of Endeavour's Houndé property. 

'The Houndé South concessions are underlain by a northerly-trending package of mafic to 
intermediate composition volcanics and sediments that are intruded by a mix of early to late felsic 
to mafic intrusions.  These rocks have been deformed and subjected to local shearing and faulting.  
Property-scale airborne magnetic data indicate strong, north-trending lineaments that are 
interpreted to represent shear zones or large fault zones, lie to the east and west of the known 
zones of gold mineralization.  Less well defined magnetic lineament correlate well with the gold 
occurrences and gold-in-soil anomalies.' excerpt from Savory's 43-101 report, Armstrong et. al., 
2012. 

Savory has carried out two drill programs since acquiring the property option.  The drilling has 
confirmed the existence of some of the historic gold mineralization and resulted in the discovery of 
two new zones, one of which returned an intercept of 11.16 g/t Au over 9.0 metres (news release 
May 9, 2013).  

23.4 MM Prospect – Sarama Resources Ltd. 

The MM prospect, which is located on the Tankoro property, is owned by Canadian-listed Sarama 
Resources Ltd.  The property is located approximately 60 km south of Endeavour's Houndé 
property.  

During 2012, Sarama completed 80,000 metres of RC, diamond and RAB / air core drilling and 
outlined a 30 km long mineralized structural corridor.  Within this corridor, two 2 km long 
mineralized zones were discovered in the MM and Phantom zone areas.  Gold mineralization in 
these areas is mainly associated with strongly altered feldspar porphyry dykes.  Significant results 
include 10.2 metres at 14.85 g/t Au, 15.50 metres at 6.61 g/t Au, 11.8 metres at 8.06 g/t Au, 
13.9 metres at 14.47 g/t Au, 18.3 metres at 7.09 g/t Au and 13.9 metres at 5.90 g/t Au.  A maiden 
Mineral Resource estimate is expected in Q3, 2013.

23.5 Bondigui – Orezone Gold Corporation 

The Bondigui Property is owned by Orezone Gold Corporation.  It is located approximately 30 km 
due south of Endeavour's Houndé property within the Houndé greenstone belt. 

The gold mineralization at Bondigui is chiefly associated with a north to north-northeast striking, 
sub-vertical shear zone array, accompanied with discrete shears splaying off along 330/60°E, 
000/90°, and 035/80°E.  The system has been interpreted as a dextral shear zone with second and 
third-order shears.  The individual shear corridors are 5 to 50 m wide. 

The mineralization lies in a shear zone cutting across the eastern contact of the Tarkwa 
sedimentary trough within the eastern volcanic domain and is in close spatial association with mafic 
and intrusive bodies. 

Mineralization is characterized by alteration that manifests itself by silicification, sericite, carbonate 
(ankerite), and hematite, with occurrences of finely disseminated pyrite.  The sulphide abundance 
amounts to 1 to 2% (locally 5 to 10%) and is dominantly represented by pyrite, with subordinate 
arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. 

Veins and veinlets ranging from 0.1 – 1.0 m found with the alteration in the shear zone form 
mineralized bodies up to 24 m wide. 

A NI 43-101 compliant report titled 'Technical Report on the Mineral Resource of the Bondigui Gold 
Project' was published in February 2009 on SEDAR.  The deposits hosts Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources totalling 4,140,000 t at 2.12 g/t Au (282,000 oz Au), whereas the Inferred 
Mineral Resources were 2,536,000 t at 1.84 g/t Au (149,700 oz Au). 

23.6 Dossi – ACC Resources 

The Dossi property is owned by ACC Resources. It is situated immediately east of Endeavour's 
Houndé licenses (Figure 23.1) within the Houndé greenstone belt.  ACC carried out several 
exploration campaigns, including the following: 

� 227 RC drill holes (27,827 m), 

� 31 Core holes (4,676 m) in Zone 1, 

� 800 RAB drill holes (20,910 m), 

� 2,827 soil geochemistry samples, 

� Four ground geophysical programs (IP), and  

� High resolution aeromag and radiometry (Fugro Airborne Surveys, MIDAS) completed in 
November 2010. 

The company has not publically reported a mineral resource estimate.

23.7 Mana Mine – Semafo SARL 

The Mana mine is operated by SEMAFO SARL.  It is situated approximately 40 km North of 
Endeavour's Houndé licenses. 

The Mana property is mostly covered by Houndé greenstone belt sedimentary, volcano-
sedimentary, and volcanic rocks of Birimian age. 

SEMAFO has discovered seven areas of gold mineralization within 20 km of the mill including 
Wona, Nyafe, Filion 67, Fofina, Yaho, Fobiri and the newest, Siou.  Six of these zones have 
reported mineral resources. 

The Wona deposit is hosted in a series of highly deformed sedimentary (black pelites), volcano-
sedimentary, and meta-volcanic rocks.  The gold mineralization developed along a major 
northeast-trending sub-vertical fault zone of regional extent.  The zone is up to 200 metres wide in 
the Wona pit sector.  The original stratigraphic sequence is a succession of pelitic sediments with 
graphitic horizons and volcaniclastics.  The rocks have been affected by a pervasive S1 schistosity, 
which would be associated to vertical movements along the fault (i.e., the east block rising with 
respect to the west one) as well as sinistral lateral movements.  These foliated rocks are cut by 
mafic to intermediate dikes, themselves foliated (i.e., S2 schistosity parallel to S1). 

The mineralization itself would be associated to a posterior lateral movement along the fault with 
hydrothermal fluid circulation and intense silicification. 

The Nyafé deposit is hosted in a purely volcanic sequence with basalt and mafic to intermediate 
tuffs and flows.  Pillows display a dark ferrous chloritic border suggesting some hydrothermal 
alteration of volcanogenic origin.  Several sub-vertical decametric dikes cross the volcanic 
sequence, in particular a N-S felsic quartz porphyritic dike and two mafic dikes on both sides of the 
pit parallel to the mineralization. 

The Filon 67 deposit, next to Nyafé is comprised of greenschist-hosted quartz veins that are 
associated with shear zones with dextral movement.  These composite veins demonstrate multiple 
episodes of crack and fill textures. 

As is the case for outcropping mineral deposits in tropical climate zones, in western Africa in 
particular, the rock package hosting both Wona and Nyafé deposits has been subjected to intense 
meteoritic alteration with the development of a saprolitic zone near the surface. 

The Wona deposit has been traced over a distance of 4.7 km along an azimuth of 46°.  The Nyafé 
deposit extends for 2.4 km along a N-S direction. 

The Filon 67 or F67 ore body lies almost parallel to the Nyafé ore body, about 300 m to the east.  It 
strikes almost NS over a length of about 500 m. 

Siou is hosted by a shear zone that lies along the contact between granodiorite and sediments.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Risks and Opportunities 

In addition to the risks and opportunities outlined in the sections above, a workshop was conducted 
to identify high level sources of uncertainty that could influence the Project outcome.  The 
workshop was attended by representatives of the organisations contributing to the Report and was 
facilitated by an experienced person independent of the study teams.  The workshop identified both 
risks and opportunities, evaluated likely scenarios and rated these in terms of likelihood of 
occurrence and severity of consequences.  The resulting level of risk for each item was then 
evaluated and a decision made to accept the risk or implement additional mitigating measures.  
The Risk Register arising from the workshop is attached in Appendix 24.1. 

24.2 Other Relevant Data 

There is no other data relevant to the Houndé Project that has not already been discussed in this 
report.

25.0 CONCLUSIONS  

Detailed conclusions arising out of the performance of this Study have been utilised in the 
development of the relevant sections of this report.  This section considers more general aspects of 
the study. 

25.1 Conclusions 

� Exploration drilling in the immediate Vindaloo and Madras NW pit areas indicates that 
there are both in-pit and near pit mineralized zones that merit follow-up in the short term, 
as their delineation could have a positive impact on the current mine and waste pile 
models. 

� Exploration targets, located around the periphery of the Vindaloo and Madras NW pits, 
have the potential to add additional reserves. 

� The Vindaloo mineralisation is sufficiently drilled and modelled to allow classification into 
a Resource Model that has been developed using generally accepted industry techniques 
and practices and conforms to CIM guidelines (CIM 2005).  The Mineral Resource 
estimate is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.35 g/t Au with an effective date of July 18, 
2012. 

� The metallurgical testwork conducted on samples representing the bulk of the deposit to 
be mined has resulted in the development of a robust process flowsheet which is 
expected to recover in excess of 93% of the gold in the mill feed.  Additional testwork on 
gravity concentration would improve the confidence of the design details and recovery 
estimates for this part of the process, and further testwork to optimise cyanide 
consumption may lead to reductions in overall operating costs.  

� The mine design and scheduling activities have resulted in a Reserve statement 
produced in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101, 'Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects' of June 2011 (the Instrument) and the Definition 
Standards adopted by CIM Council in November 2010. 

� The preliminary design of the supporting infrastructure for the project has been carried 
out in sufficient detail to arrive at cost estimates of appropriate accuracy for study of this 
nature.  One item still under negotiation is the connection to the HV power grid; while 
SONABEL has agreed in principle to supply power to the project, the details of the 
connection have not yet been agreed. 

� Environmental studies have established the baseline conditions in the local project area 
and the efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of developing, operating and closure 
of a mine. The ESIA Reports have been completed and the Resettlement Action Plan is 
nearing completion to support the application for permits.

� A social impact assessment study has identified a number of areas of concern raised by 
the local community and identified appropriate mitigating actions. Overall, this study has 
demonstrated the economic and social benefits of the project for the area and the 
Country, A compensation and relocation plan has been developed for those that will be 
impacted by the Project. 

� Based on the current reserves, production schedule, the metallurgical performance of the 
ore, the cost estimates, and other relevant criteria and parameters, the cash flow model 
indicates a robust project with an acceptable rate of return, even at current depressed 
gold prices.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Specific recommendations arising out of the performance of this Feasibility Study have been 
identified and recorded in the relevant sections of this report.  This section considers more general 
aspects of the study. 

Given the favourable economics of the project, it is recommended that Endeavour proceed with 
development of the project. 

An exploration plan should be developed that matches the mine development schedule to ensure 
that any mineralized zones that could positively impact the mine plan, are delineated in sufficient 
time to allow for the development of an updated mine plan.
