Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 1 

1 SUMMARY 

The MSA Group (Pty) Ltd (MSA) was commissioned by Diamond Fields Resources Inc. (the 

"Company" / "DFR") to prepare a Technical Report compliant with the Canadian National Instrument 

43-101 (NI 43-101) for the Company's exploration activities on its Beravina Zircon Property 

("Beravina Project" / "the Project") in west-central Madagascar. 

 

1.1 Ownership 

The Project is 100 % owned by Madagascar C.G.M.M. (S.A.R.L.) (CGMM) a private Malagasy 

company. DFR owns 100 % of Madagascar C.G.M.M. (S.A.R.L.) through its 100 % ownership of 

Kimberly Overseas and Action Mining Ltd. 

 

1.2 Property Description and Location 

The Property is located in west-central Madagascar, approximately 10 km northeast of the village 

of Beravina in the district of Morafenobe, Melaky region, Mahanja Province. The Project is 

approximately 214 km via road from the capital Antananarivo, and 172 km by road from the regional 

town of Tsiranomandidy. The west coast port of Maintirano is approximately 220 km from the 

Project area via road.  

The Property comprises the mining permit (PE – Permis d'Exploitation), PE8096 covering an area of 

6.325 km2. The PE was issued to CGMM on 22 June 2015 for zircon and for a period of 40 years, 

expiring on 21 June 2055. 

The Project is accessed via the RN1 and RN1b (214 km) tar road from the capital Antananarivo to 

the town of Tsiranomandidy. From Tsiranomandidy to the town of Beravina is 172 km along a 

secondary road. The condition of this road varies much along its length, depending on the amount 

of rain. The Project area is accessed by a 7 km long 4x4 track which branches from the road to 

Tsiranomandidy approximately 5.6 km east of the village of Beravina. 

 

1.3 Exploration History 

The zircon mineralisation was discovered in the 1950s during general geological mapping by the 

French geological survey - Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (Austral Resources Ltd, 

2013). A summary of the exploration work conducted on the Property since the 1950s is provided 

in Table 1-1.

1.4 Geology and Mineralisation 

The Project is located in the Antananarivo domain of central and north Madagascar which 

comprises Neo-Archaean (2.5 Ga) gneisses and migmatitic gneisses interlayered with 820-740 Ma 

granitoids and gabbros. These rocks have been pervasively deformed and metamorphosed under 

granulite facies conditions during the Pan African event between 750-500 Ma.  

During the final phases of the Pan African event intense thermal metamorphism, accompanied by 

granitoid intrusion, produced widespread migmatitic gneisses and migmatites in all the units 

described above, resulting in overprinting of the metamorphic facies and obliterating much of the 

original structure and texture. The pegmatite and related mineralisation, including the pegmatite 

that constitutes the Beravina deposit, is associated with this Pan African magmatic event. 

The geology on the Property comprises porphyritic tonalitic gneisses and migmatites of the 

Antananarivo domain which outcrop along with subordinate quartz and rhyolitic dykes in the river 

beds and the outcrops of the Beravina pegmatite. 

Beravina Pegmatite forms a distinct 50 m high hill, the Beravina hill, that rises above the surrounding 

dissected, undulating plateau. The peripheral quartz-zircon zone outcrops in a circular pattern 

which defines the shape of the pegmatite which is interpreted as a north dipping cone shaped 

pegmatite. Four zones are recognized in the pegmatite and tabulated in Table 1-2.

The zircon (ZrSiO4) mineralisation is contained within the Outer Zone, comprising quartz and zircon, 

of the pegmatite. This zone can be subdivided into: 

• a northern zone on the north of the Beravina hill which outcrops over a length of about 

140 m, with a thickness varying between 5 m and 12 m and steep dips varying from 60° to 

80° northwards, to 85º to the south towards the centre of the hill; and  

• a southern zone in the southern part of the hill which can be followed on surface for over 

150 m, occasionally forming massive south-facing cliffs. The dips here are moderate, ranging 

from 20° - 40° to the north. The drill hole S2 showed that it is cut by a granite wedge. The 

exposed width varies from a few metres to 13 m. 

The quartz-zircon zone contains on average 20 % zircon either as disseminated euhedral crystals or 

agglomerations of crystals in the quartz; or as fillings in fractures and vugs. Associated with the 

zircon mineralisation is minor thorite (ThSiO4), which contain thorium and minor uranium, and 

fluorite which are considered deleterious minerals in zircon concentrates.  

The Beravina Pegmatite has characteristics of a number of pegmatite types but is best classified as 

NYF-family pegmatite of the Abyssal HREE Class but with characteristics of a Rare-element Class 

pegmatite.  

 

1.5 Current Exploration 

DFR contracted MSA to conduct additional exploration activities on the Project from late 2017. The 

exploration work done over this period includes: 

• A review and verification of the historical work and available data was done in late 2017. This 

included an initial data verification process which included: 

o a review of the existing drill core was done for drill holes S1 to S12. Only the sampling 

logs and assay results were available for this. No geological logs were available for any 

of the drill holes for this phase of work; 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 4 

o a number of issues with the data were flagged from this process namely: 

▪ lack of geological logs, 

▪ the core was at some point transferred to new boxes and during the process 

was either put in upside down or incorrectly packed, 

▪ there were no metre marks or sample mark-up on the drill core, 

▪ it was noted that no geological logs and recovery logs were available, 

▪ the historical sampling was discontinuous through the mineralisation, 

▪ no documentary evidence on the use of QA/QC samples, referee samples or 

documented procedures with initial sampling campaigns in 2006 and 2011 in 

order to verify and assure the quality of the assay results, 

▪ historical sampling was not consistently done, examples include:  

- intervals of drill core were cut and sampled, but no assay results reported 

(e.g. S6) 

- drill core unsampled in the core tray, but historical assay values for those 

intervals were previously been reported 

- drill core was selectively sampled through mineralized zones 

- discontinuously with no hanging wall or footwall samples, 

▪ the condition of the drill core was not recorded: no RQD logs, metre marking, 

core quality logs or core loss was noted. 

• Following the data review and verification the following work was done: 

o Relogging of the historical core, which included checking the core integrity and metre 

marking, lithological logging, mineralisation logging, core recovery, core quality, RQD 

and core photography; 

o Resampling of the historical core through the previously sampled and unsampled 

intersections (see Section 6): 

▪ this included the implementation of a QA/QC programme for the sample assays, 

▪ the sampling was done in order to provide data to inform a Mineral Resource 

estimate and also for metallurgical test work; 

o a site visit was also done in order to confirm the mapped geology and drill collar 

locations; 

o during the resampling a set of metallurgical samples were also taken (see Section 13). 

The historical sample results were used as a guide for the metallurgical sample 

groupings. The samples were grouped into four categories based on the historically 

reported zirconium and thorium contents; and 

o a comparison of the MSA logging data with five of the historical drill hole logs, which 

were shared with MSA after the completion of relogging was done. The new data was 

considered comparable with the historical data and demonstrated that the process of 

checking, remarking, logging and sampling was able to restore the drill core to its 

original condition. 

The logging and assay data that was collected by MSA was used to inform the Mineral Resource 

estimate. 

 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 5 

1.6 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

DFR commissioned SGS South Africa and MSA, under the project leadership of HATCH 

(Johannesburg), to conduct metallurgical testwork including mineralogy, metallurgy and other 

deposit characteristics, in advance of an intended drill programme aimed at increasing deposit 

confidence.  

The testwork focused on various options for metallurgical and material processing to determine 

specifically: 

• the potential to upgrade the zircon by a combination of heavy liquid and magnetic 

separation processes; 

• the potential to reject U, Th during the magnetic separation process; and 

• the potential to reject other gangue elements including sulphides and fluorides from the 

zircon concentrate by flotation. 

A review of the independent 2012 JORC-compliant Indicated Mineral Resource estimate undertaken 

by Badger Mining and Consulting (Pty) Ltd., raised concerns that the resource may be radioactive 

and contain metamict zircon which could potentially impact on the economics of the Project). 

Metamict zircon is formed over time, as a result of the impact of radioactive decay of U and Th on 

the crystal structure of the zircon crystal. A mineralogical study to determine whether metamict 

zircon can be distinguished from less altered zircon based on the U and Th content of the sample. 

was also undertaken 

The 108 core samples were provided from earlier drilling work and these were composited into four 

samples (Groups 1 to 4) to provide a range of ZrO2 and ThO2 content. Each sample was crushed 

and screened at -45 μm into a coarse and fine fraction. The coarse fractions were treated by HLS 

followed by a magnetic separation of the sinks. 

The key findings of the work are as follows: 

• The four composite samples contained between 11.5 and 17.9 % ZrO2, with an averaged HfO2 

content of 0.29 %. Thorium concentrations range from 119 ppm Th in Group 1 to 1,820 ppm 

in Group 4. 

• The average grade of the four composites was 14.63 % ZrO2, 0.2 9% HfO2, 1.34 % CaO, 1.39 % 

Fe2O3 and 9.45 % SiO2. 

• Screen analysis of the samples (crushed to -1 mm) found that on average 8.6 % of the sample 

was <45 μm. 

• Heavy liquid and magnetic separation on the -1 mm material proved effective in recovering 

the ZrO2, with an average recovery of 92 % at an average grade of 53 % ZrO2 to the final 

non-magnetic fraction. 

• Whilst the HLS and magnetics work were successful in recovering Zr and rejecting Fe, it was 

not effective in rejecting Th, Ca, S or Zn, all of which were upgraded in the final non-magnetic 

product. 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 6 

Following the outcomes of the mineralogical study, a Group 2 sample was subjected to shaking 

table and HLS primary concentrate production, followed by sequential reverse flotation for 

sulphides, and subsequently fluorine to evaluate further rejection of these elements. The key 

outcomes of the upgrading testwork are: 

• The sulphide float was successful as a rejection process for S in that it removed 98 % of the 

sulphides. The sequential secondary float less successful in that it only removed 18 % of the 

fluorspar. 

• Following flotation, the resulting test tailings product achieved a ZrO2 grade of 51 %, at 

recoveries of around 98 %. S and F grades were in the flotation tailings product were around 

0.02 % and 0.24 % respectively. The major diluting element was SiO2 at around 42 %. 

• Further HLS testwork on the zircon flotation tailings product with TBE at an SG of 2.96 

rejected around 20 % of the SiO2 to the floats, recovering around 97 % of the zircon to sinks 

with a concentrate grade of 57 % ZrO2, also containing 1.19 % HfO2 and 37.8 % SiO2. 

The mineralogical study to determine whether metamict zircon can be distinguished from less 

altered zircon based on the U and Th content of the sample returned the following findings: 

• Core samples from across the deposit confirm the presence of metamict zircon and varying 

levels of uranium and thorium. 

• The Th was found to occur in fine thorite grains, most of which were locked in zircon crystals. 

The removal of these thorite grains would require a much finer grind than currently achieved. 

• Calcium occurred mainly in fluorite, with a range of liberations observed, while Zn and S 

occurred mainly as sphalerite which also showed a range of liberations. Flotation could be 

used to remove the sphalerite. In addition to these minerals, rare earths were also observed 

in the non-magnetic fractions. 

• Flotation would not address the Th content.  

 

1.7 Mineral Resource Estimate 

The Mineral Resource was estimated using The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum (CIM) Best Practice Guidelines and is reported in accordance with the 2014 CIM 

Definition Standards, which have been incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101 

– Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). The Mineral Resource is classified into 

the Inferred category as shown in Table 1-3. 

The Mineral Resource is reported at a cut-off grade of 9 % ZrO2, which is the lowest grade block 

estimate within the mineralisation model. Given reasonably assumed high-level cost and revenue 

assumptions, and the relatively high grade of the deposit, the QP considers that mineralisation at 

this cut-off grade will satisfy the test for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction 

(RPEEE). 

It should be noted that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability and the application of economic parameters used to assess the potential for 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 7 

economic extraction is not an attempt to estimate Mineral Reserves, the level of study so far carried 

out being insufficient with which to do so.

Notes: 

1. All tabulated data have been rounded and as a result minor computational errors may occur. 

2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. 

3. ThO2 and U3O8 are "deleterious elements". 

4. Determining of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" was based on the following cost 

and revenue assumptions*: 

a. zircon price of USD 950 per tonne of zircon concentrate 

b. 90% concentrator recovery of zircon to the concentrate, based on initial metallurgical testing 

c. mining cost of USD 20 per tonne of mineralised material 

d. concentrator costs of USD 20 per tonne of plant feed 

e. general and administration cost (G&A) of USD 20 per tonne of treated material 

f. transport cost of USD 150 per tonne concentrate from the mine to China. 

*Note that these cost and revenue assumptions are selected for the sole reason of establishing "reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction" and should not be interpreted in any way to represent a 

techno-economic assessment of the Beravina Zr deposit.

1.8 Recommendations 

The results of work completed on the Project to date warrant further exploration. The 

recommendations to be considered for subsequent exploration activities for the next two years 

(2019-2020) on the Project are summarized in Table 1-4 and discussed below.

Any future work will be contingent on positive results from the proposed work programme. 

Further exploration drilling is recommended to better delineate the zircon mineralisation within the 

Beravina Pegmatite. An additional 10 drill holes are planned as part of the future exploration 

programme with the aim of determining the extent of the zircon mineralisation under the scree 

covered areas in the east and west of the hill, and to determine the down dip extent of the 

mineralisation (Figure 26-1).  

Assessment of the zircon mineralisation contained within the surficial deposits is also 

recommended.

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Scope of Work 

The MSA Group (Pty) Ltd (MSA) has been commissioned by Diamond Fields Resources Inc. (the 

"Company" / "DFR") to provide an Independent Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate 

(the "Report") on the Company's exploration activities on its Beravina Zircon Property (Beravina 

Project" / "the Project) in west-central Madagascar, approximately 10 km northeast of the village of 

Beravina. The Property comprises the mining licence (Permis d'Exploitation) PE8096, which is 100 % 

owned by Madagascar C.G.M.M. (S.A.R.L.) a private Malagasy company. DFR owns 100 % of 

Madagascar C.G.M.M. (S.A.R.L.) through its 100 % ownership of Kimberly Overseas and Action 

Mining Ltd. 

Diamond Fields Resources Inc. is a publicly traded company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange 

(TSX-V) under the symbol DFR. 

The focus of exploration on the Beravina Property and the subject of this Independent Technical 

Report (Report) is the Beravina Zircon Project. 

The Report has been prepared to comply with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in 

National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101), Companion 

Policy 43-101CP, Form 43-101F1, and the CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014. 

A final draft of the Report was also provided to DFR, along with a written request to DFR to identify 

any material errors or omissions prior to lodgement. 

DFR's Beravina mineral property is considered to represent an "Exploration Project" which is 

inherently speculative in nature. However, MSA considers that the property has been acquired on 

the basis of sound technical merit. 

The Company has prepared staged exploration and evaluation programmes, specific to the 

potential of the Project, which are consistent with the budget allocations. The Project has evolved 

on the basis of limited exploration in 2017-2018 and MSA considers that the relevant areas have 

sufficient technical merit to justify the proposed programmes and associated expenditure. The 

proposed Year 1 and Year 2 (2019 – 2020) exploration budgets exceed the minimum annual 

statutory expenditure commitment on the mineral concessions in Madagascar. It is logical and 

prudent, however, that those less prospective individual areas are progressively relinquished as the 

results of initial exploration are evaluated. In this manner, it is unlikely that the full statutory 

exploration expenditure commitment will need to be achieved.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

This Technical Report has been prepared for DFR by MSA based on assumptions as identified 

throughout the text and upon information and data supplied as discussed below. 

MSA's opinion contained herein is based on information and data provided to MSA by DFR 

throughout the course of the investigations. MSA has relied on DFR for input on Property 

ownership, history, geology, agreements and permitting in support of this Report. The Property 

consists of a Permis d'Exploitation, PE8096 of 6.25 km2 (625 ha). The licence was issued in terms of 

the Madagascan Mining Code, Act Number 99-022 formed on 19 August 1999 on 22 June 2015 for 

40 years to 21 June 2055. 

The QPs used their experience to determine if the information from previous reports was suitable 

for inclusion in this Report and adjusted information that required amending. This Report includes 

technical information which required subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, totals and 

weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 

introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the QPs does not consider them to be material. 

The QPs has not independently verified, nor is it qualified to verify, the legal status of these licences 

and/or any other licences which have been amalgamated into the current licence. The present 

statuses of the licences listed in this Report are based on information and copies of documents 

provided by DFR and its partners, and the Report has been prepared on the assumption that the 

tenements will prove lawfully accessible for evaluation. MSA did not seek an independent legal 

opinion on these items. 

The QPs are not qualified to provide comment on environmental issues associated with the 

Property.  

Any statements and opinions expressed in this document are given in good faith and in the belief 

that such statements and opinions are not false and misleading as at the date of this Report.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

The Project is located in the west-northwest of Madagascar near the village of Beravina in the 

district of Morafenobe, Melaky region, Mahanja Province (Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2). The Project is 

approximately 214 km via road from the capital Antananarivo, and 172 km by road from the 

regional town of Tsiranomandidy. The west coast port of Maintirano is approximately 220 km from 

the Project area via road.

4.2 Mineral Tenure, Permitting, Rights and Agreements 

The Property comprises an area of 6.25 km2 (625 ha) that includes the Beravina zircon deposit 

(Figure 4-3 and Table 4-1). The Project area was originally licenced by Compagnie Generale Des 

Mines de Madagascar SARL (CGMM) in 2003, under a 10 year renewable exploration licence (PR – 

Permis de Recherche) number PR8096, covering 6.25 km2 (625 hectares) for zircon and associated 

minerals. The permit was issued on the 01/08/2003 and expired on the 31/07/2013. CGMM has 

since converted the licence to a mining permit, Permis d'Exploitation, PE8096, for zircon, issued on 

22 June 2015 for a period of 40 years, expiring on 21 June 2055 (Source: Bureau du Cadastre Minier 

de Madagascar - http://bcmm.mg/cartographie/cartographie.php). 

In August 2016 DFR entered into an agreement with Pala Investments Limited ("Pala") and Austral 

Resources Limited (Austral) to acquire the Project through DFR's wholly owned subsidiary Kimberly 

Overseas (Kimberly). Under the Agreement, Kimberly acquired 100 % of the issued and outstanding 

shares of Action Mining Limited ("Action"), a Mauritius company and the parent company of the 

Madagascar entity that held the license to the Beravina deposit. The current Company structure 

and Project ownership is shown in Figure 4-4.

4.3 Environmental Liabilities 

MSA is not aware of any special environmental restrictions or liabilities related to the Project.  

 

4.4 Major Risks 

According to the 2018 RiskMap published by Control Risks (https://www.controlrisks.com/riskmap-

2018/maps), Madagascar is classified as having a medium political risk factor and a medium security 

risk factor. Presidential elections were held in Madagascar on 7 November 2018. A second round 

of elections are to be held on 19 December 2018. Whilst the results are unknown, it would seem 

that Madagascar will continue to support the mining industry. In the medium term, the risk of 

political interference in the mining industry is considered to be low.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Project can be accessed via the RN1 and RN1b (214 km) tar road from the capital Antananarivo 

to the town of Tsiranomandidy. A secondary road links Tsiranomandidy to the town of Beravina, a 

distance of 172 km. The condition of this road varies much along its length, depending on the 

amount of rain. The Project area is accessed by a 7 km long 4x4 track which branches from road to 

Tsiranomandidy approximately 5.6 km east of the village of Beravina (Figure 4-1).  

 

5.2 Climate and Physiography 

The Project area lies close to the boundary between two distinct climatic regions of Madagascar, 

i.e. just inside the West Coast domain which has a tropical savannah climate (Aw (Köppen-Geiger)) 

and just west of the central highlands plateau which has a temperate with dry winters and hot 

summers (Cwa (Köppen-Geiger)).  

There are two distinct seasons; a wet season from December to March with January being the 

wettest month, and a dry season from April to November, with July being the coldest month and 

June the driest month (Figure 5-1).

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 20 

The Project area lies on the western scarp slope of the Plateau of Bongolava which extends 

eastwards from the town of Tsiromandidy to the village of Beravina and which rises to 

approximately 1,300 mamsl. The bulk of the Plateau of Bongolava comprises rolling grasslands, 

dissected by small rivers. East of the village of Beravina, the altitude drops to approximately 

500 mamsl into the Ankondromena Graben.  

The Beravina deposit occurs as a small hill rising 50 metres above the valley floor. The drainage is 

incised, with steep-sided valleys (Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-3). The hill is prolate in shape, trending 

with the regional geological fabric to the west-northwest, with steep scarp slopes to the north and 

south (Ransome, 2016).

Beravina hill from the north looking south) 

 

 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Beravina deposit is very isolated, with little in the way of local resources and infrastructure. 

There is no access to electricity in the immediate Project area. Water is available from several small 

streams nearby, although the quality of the water has not been tested. 

For all practical purposes, housing, medical facilities, and shopping and entertainment facilities are 

non-existent. 

The area is not heavily populated, and it is unlikely that any skilled labour will be available locally. 

Limited semi-skilled labour may be available locally.

6 HISTORY 

The Beravina deposit (originally called the Ambatofotsy project) was discovered in the 1950s by the 

French geological survey - Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) during regional 

geological mapping (Austral Resources Ltd, 2013). The exploration history of the Beravina deposit 

is summarized in Table 6-1and discussed below.

In 1990, the Russian consulting group Zarubejgeologia undertook an investigation of the deposit 

for the Malagasy Government. Work included geological mapping and trenching (Figure 6-1). An 

extensive report was produced; a copy of which was obtained by CGMM. Based on the Russian 

study and their own work, CGMM compiled a Pre-feasibility Study that led them to apply for a ten-

year Exploration License in August 2003, which they were granted.

In 2006 ALM-Forex, on behalf of CGMM, started a systematic exploration campaign comprising 

trenching (130 m), sampling and the drilling of three inclined exploration drill holes to a depth of 

23 m (drill holes S1, S2 and S3). The core from the S1 and S3 drill holes was split by diamond saw 

and the half core submitted to Intertek Genalysis Laboratory Services in Perth, Australia for assay. 

Drill hole S2 failed to intersect mineralisation.  

MSA could not locate and/or confirm the collar positions of these drill holes during the site 

inspection by Mr van der Merwe (QP). It is assumed that the collar positions of these drill holes 

were either poorly marked or not marked at all. 

The results from the 2006 drilling campaign confirmed the potential and geology of the Beravina 

deposit. The continuity of the mineralisation at depth was confirmed by two of the three drill holes. 

In addition, the drilling indicated a complex structural setting.  

The CGMM Pre-feasibility Study concluded that there was the potential of at least 650,000 tonnes 

of mineralized material with an average grade of 20 % to 25 % zircon. The CGMM Pre-feasibility 

Study used data from the trenching and drilling to create a basic geological model and mine design. 

Following the results of the initial drilling, further drilling was undertaken by Austral Prospectus in 

2011 to 2012, with the aim of estimating Indicated Mineral Resources. During the second phase of 

drilling, 10 inclined drill holes (S4 – S12) with one vertical deflection (S9 bisV) were drilled. The list

of the drill holes is presented in Table 6-2 The historical results from the 2006 and 2011 drilling are 

summarized in Table 6-3. The geology interpreted and described from the historical drilling is

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 25 

In addition to the drilling in 2011 to 2012, a radiometric survey was conducted using a handheld 

device. The result indicated that the zircon-rich portion of the pegmatite produces a radioactive 

response (Figure 6-4). 

Metallurgical test work was also conducted as part of this phase of work by Austral to determine 

the recovery of the zircon and the effects of U and Th within the mineralized material on the 

concentrate (Process Consulting and Engineering, 2012). The ALS metallurgy report found the U 

and Th contents of the head sample were significantly higher than those in the feed samples. 

Furthermore, re-analysis of the metallurgical head samples from the pilot plant were sent to Intertek 

Genalysis and found to be similar to the U and Th grades in the feed samples. However, ALS did 

find that processing to a -6 and +1 mm stream through four stages of spiralling produced a 

concentrate with a head grade of >60 % ZrO2 from feed material grading ~26 % ZrO2.  

Regardless of the ALS and Intertek Genalysis assay disparity, Badger Mining and Consulting Ltd 

(Anderson and Spengler, 2012) produced a JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimate of 1.8 Mt 

containing 29.5 % zircon (ZrSiO4) at an Indicated Resource level of confidence. In 2014, a 

mineralogical report on two thin sections by Roger Townsend (2014) noted that the zircon grains 

contained thorite and columbite as the likely source of the U and Th in the mineralized material. 

The disparity between the U and Th results from the ALS and Intertek Genalysis analyses has led to 

some delays in the development of the Project. As a result, DFR undertook to re-analyse and 

reprocess the samples in 2018 to determine the metallurgy (see Sections 11 and 13).

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The island of Madagascar comprises a series of tectonic domains which are unique in character, 

separated by major shears and thrusts, and were rearranged and deformed during the Pan African 

Orogenic event Central and northern Madagascar has been divided into five tectonic domains by 

Collins et al. (2002) (Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-2) which comprise the basement rocks of the island. 

They consist of older Archaean, i.e. >3,000 Ma, younger Archaean (3,000 to 2,500 Ma), 

Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic rocks, and a thrust sheet of mid-Neoproterozoic mafic to 

ultramafic rocks. These domains are described below: 

• the Antongil domain, present along parts of the east coast, comprises predominantly older 

(~3.2 Ga) Archaean granitoids, gneisses, schists and migmatites. It experienced greenschist 

metamorphism at ~2.5 Ga; 

• the Antananarivo domain comprises younger (~2.5 Ga) Archaean gneisses and migmatitic 

gneisses, interlayered with ~820-740 Ma granitoids and gabbros. The rocks were pervasively 

deformed and metamorphosed under granulite-facies conditions between 750-500 Ma. To 

the west, the Betsimisaraka suture separates the Antongil domain from the structurally 

overlying Antananarivo domain: 

o the Betsimisaraka suture consists of a sequence of pelitic paragneisses with entrained 

podiform mafic to ultramafic bodies. It occurs between the Antongil and the 

Antananarivo domain; 

• the Itremo domain is composed of a predominantly Meso- to Neoproterozoic 

metasedimentary shelf sequence of metacarbonates and schists and their deep-water 

equivalent to the west. These are thrust over and imbricated with the Antananarivo domain. 

The eastern margin of the Itremo sheet forms an extensive extensional detachment (the 

Betsileo shear zone). The Itremo domain, which was not extensively deformed during 

extensional deformation, appears to have moved south-westward over the Antananarivo 

domain, above the west dipping Betsileo Suture; 

• the major NNW-SSE trending Ranotsara-Bongolava Shear separates the Itremo domain from 

the felsic leptynites, gneisses and amphibolites that constitute the Palaeoproterozoic Bekily 

domain, which occupies the south-western third of the island; 

• the Tsaratanana domain comprises ~2.7-2.5 Ga mafic-ultramafic gneisses. The rocks were 

deformed and metamorphosed at ~2.5 Ga. They are cut by 800-760 Ma gabbro intrusions. 

The domain is represented by three structurally repeated belts with a cumulative length of 

1,000 km, which were thrust over the Antananarivo domain from the west during the 

Neoproterozoic convergence; and 

• the Bemarivo domain, present in the north of Madagascar, comprises east-west striking 

metasediments, gneisses and granites and overlain by folded metavolcanics. The Bemarivo 

domain rocks were thrust over those of the Antongil domain. These rocks were subject to 

granulite-facies metamorphism which is dated at around 510-520 Ma.

During the final phases of the Pan African event intense thermal metamorphism, accompanied by 

granitoid intrusion, produced widespread migmatitic gneisses and migmatites in all the units 

described above, resulting in overprinting of the metamorphic facies and obliteration of much of 

the original structures and textures (Figure 7-2). The pegmatite and related mineralisation, including 

the pegmatite that constitutes the Beravina deposit, is associated with this Pan African magmatic 

event. 

During this period, three interconnected contemporaneous sedimentary basins lapped onto the 

basin on the western and northwestern margins of the current island and were filled with sediment. 

Subsequently, during the Cretaceous Gondwana breakup, a series of Cretaceous-aged basalt sheets 

and associated ultramafic to circular shaped alkali-syenitic intrusive centres were emplaced in 

various parts of the island as it moved southwards.  

From the Cretaceous to the present, a series of peneplains with deep lateritic profiles have been 

developed and eroded as the island has been episodically uplifted.  

The Project area lies on the western margin of the Antananarivo Block (Figure 7-1).

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

The following section is largely drawn from the Badger Mining and Consulting (Pty) Ltd report 

(Anderson and Spengler, 2012). Where appropriate, reference is made to additional sources of 

information. 

The local basement is comprised of tonalitic gneisses and migmatites of the Antananarivo domain 

with subordinate quartz and rhyolitic dykes. The tonalitic migmatites, which outcrop in the river 

beds in the vicinity of the Beravina pegmatite, contain phenocrysts or porphyroblasts of whitish 

plagioclase (andesine-oligoclase). Outcrops of rhyolite dykes and quartz also occur along with the 

migmatite outcrops.  

These basement units are intruded by the Beravina Pegmatite which forms a distinct 50 m high hill, 

the Beravina hill, rising above the surrounding dissected, undulating plateau. The peripheral quartz-

zircon zone outcrops in a circular pattern (Figure 6-2), defining the shape of the pegmatite which 

is interpreted as a north dipping cone-shaped pegmatite. Four zones are recognised in the 

pegmatite and are described in Table 7-1.

The outer quartz-zircon zone (Zone 3) has a variable outcrop thickness, estimated to vary between 

5 m to 13 m, and a milky white crystalline quartz core (Figure 7-3). The outcrop surface is 

approximately 160 m in diameter in an east-west direction, and approximately 120 m in diameter 

in a north-south direction and describes the intersection surface a semi continuous ovoid, offset by 

a number of small faults on the higher slopes of the hill (Figure 6-2). This Outer Zone can be 

subdivided into: 

• a northern zone on the north of the Beravina hill which outcrops over a length of about 

140 m, with a thickness varying between 5 m and 12 m and steep dips varying from 60° - 80° 

to the north, to 85º to the south towards the centre of the hill; and  

• a southern zone in the southern part of the hill which can be followed on surface for over 

150 m, occasionally forming massive south facing cliffs. The dips here are moderate, ranging 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 33 

from 20° - 40° to the north. The drill hole S2 showed that it is cut by a granite wedge. The 

exposed width varies from a few metres to 13 m. 

The outcrops of the western edges of both the northern and southern zones truncate against a 

well-defined fault. The eastern end of the southern zone's outcrop thins and disappears, whereas 

the northern zone's outcrop abuts against the magmatic breccia (Figure 6-2). Drilling has confirmed 

the presence of Zone 3 at depth. 

Both the northern and southern zones are offset by a number of small radial faults with 

displacements of less than a metre. Two small late stage quartz dykes/veins, present on the 

northeast and northwest edges of the northern half of the intrusion, are intruded along structures 

parallel to the radial faults.  

Both the northern and southern portions of the mineralized quartz-zircon zone have a sharp contact 

with the discontinuous magnetite-quartz border zone and host migmatites. 

Figure 7-3 

Quartz outcrop at the top of Beravina deposit 

 

The magnetite-quartz border zone forms a thin discontinuous 1 – 2 m zone and is present on the 

northern hanging wall of the zircon pegmatite. The vein varies from tens of centimetres to a few 

metres in thickness. On the southern footwall, the magnetite appears to only be partially present in 

the southwest of the deposit (Figure 6-2). 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 34 

The contact between the quartz-zircon zone and the two inner zones is not as sharp. These inner 

zones comprising the quartz core zone and feldspar-quartz zone do not contain any significant 

zircon mineralisation. The zircon mineralisation present is minor and occurs in fractured quartz 

veins. The central quartz core of the pegmatite consists of a series of cataclastic quartz zones, 

microcline/K-Feldspar pegmatite, breccia and quartz intrusives. 

 

7.2.1 Mineralisation 

The zirconium (Zr) is hosted in zircon mineralisation contained within the outer quartz-zircon zone 

(Zone 3) of the pegmatite as described above (Figure 6-2 and Figure 7-4). The zircon mineralisation 

within this zone is hosted in massive, vuggy, milky white to greenish coloured quartz. The zircon 

crystals, which can be well zoned (Figure 7-4A), make up approximately 20 % of the rock and occur 

either as disseminated euhedral crystals or agglomerations of crystals in the quartz; or as fillings in 

fractures and vugs. Zircon crystals may be brecciated in places. 

Zircon is a zirconium-bearing nesosilicate with a chemical formula of ZrSiO4 and can contain up to 

approximately 4.5 % hafnium (Hf) and minor amounts of uranium in the crystal lattice. Other 

minerals associated with the zircon include minor thorite (ThSiO4) and ferrocolumbite (Fe
2+Nb2O6), 

these often occur as inclusions within the zircon or as discrete grains within the mineralized zone 

(Townsend ,2014; see also Section 13 and Section 14.2.4). 

The crystals range in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres but may be as large as 6 cm 

or more in places, with well-developed tetragonal habits. They are often well zoned, and set in a 

matrix of quartz, minor feldspar and smaller euhedral crystals of zircon and traces of thorite. The 

zircon crystals are commonly medium brown in colour but may also be whitish or light grey in 

colour (Figure 7-4). The thorite crystals are also brown in colour, with a tetragonal crystal habit. 

Distinguishing the zircon crystals from the thorite crystals in hand specimen is difficult; however 

Anderson and Spengler (2012) interpreted the zircon as having a more translucent brown than the 

thorite. 

Secondary accumulations of zircon mineralisation also occur on the poorly exposed, gentler east 

and west slopes of the hill where there is no outcrop of Zone 3, and where there has been some 

scree aggradation and accumulation of eluvial quartz-zircon material. The southern and northern 

slopes of the hill below the outcropping quartz-zircon zone are also covered with quartz and zircon 

eluvial material (Botolandy, 2012).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The zirconium mineralisation of the Beravina Pegmatite deposit is contained in the mineral zircon 

(ZrSiO4), which also contains small amounts of hafnium in the crystal structure. As described in 

Section 7, the zircon is hosted in Zone 3. i.e. the outer quartz-zircon zone. The weathering of the 

pegmatite has resulted in the formation of secondary surficial zircon deposits on the lower slopes 

around the pegmatite. The secondary deposits are not considered part of the mineralisation in this 

report. 

A pegmatite is defined as "an essentially igneous rock, commonly of granitic composition, that is 

distinguished from other igneous rocks by its extremely coarse but variable grain size or by an 

abundance of crystals with skeletal, graphic, or other strongly directional growth habits. Pegmatites 

occur as sharply bounded homogenous to zoned bodies within igneous or metamorphic host 

rocks." (London, 2008). 

The main rock-forming minerals in a granitic pegmatite include feldspar, quartz, mica (muscovite 

and biotite) and feldspar. Other minerals may occur in economic concentrations and include, but 

are not limited to, various lithium minerals, beryl, tourmaline, cassiterite, coltan, topaz, garnet, zircon 

and various rare-earth minerals. 

Pegmatites are classified on the basis of a number of geological, textural, mineralogical and 

geochemical parameters and the accepted classification scheme. Pegmatites are broadly classified 

as either simple/common or complex based on the presence or absence of internal zonation. 

Simple/common pegmatites are unzoned, poorly fractionated and thus usually unmineralized. 

Complex pegmatites often contain potentially economic concentrations of mineral/elements 

(including Li, Ta, Nb, Sn, Be, REE). The classification of pegmatites is based on a fourfold classification 

comprising: 

1. five pegmatite classes namely abyssal, muscovite, muscovite-rare-element, rare-element and 

miarolitic classes (Figure 8-1), based predominantly on mineralogical and textural 

characteristics, the pressure and temperature conditions of pegmatite formation, and to a 

limited degree, the metamorphic grade of their host rocks; and 

2. the classes are further subdivided into subclasses, types and subtypes (Table 8-1) on the 

basis of geochemistry, mineral chemistry and mineral assemblages.

Further to the classification three broad pegmatite families are recognized based pegmatite classes 

to other petrological, paragenetic and geochemical data, namely: 

1. Lithium-Caesium-Tantalum (LCT);  

2. Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine (NYF); and 

3. mixed LCT – NYF families.

It should be noted that pegmatites often occur as a combination/hybrid of the subtypes.  

Based on the geochemistry, mineralogy and relatively simple mineralogical zonation of the Beravina 

pegmatite, it is considered to belong to the niobium, yttrium, fluorine (NYF) family. Based on the 

high-grade metamorphic facies and metamorphic ages of the host rocks, it is considered to belong 

to the Abyssal Class (AB in Figure 8-1) but with characteristics of a Rare-Element Class pegmatite. 

The typical minor elements of these pegmatites include U, Th, Zr, Nb, Ti, Y, and REE. The abyssal 

class of pegmatites are often intruded into metamorphic rocks of upper amphibolite to granulite 

facies (London, 2008) but can have very simple to complex internal structures and may have 

temporal and spatial associations with granitic plutons. However, London (2008) notes that often 

the metamorphic grade of the host rocks does not necessarily reflect the conditions under which 

the pegmatite intruded. Beravina is a good example of this as the pegmatite seems to have intruded 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 40 

under P-T conditions where the host lithologies were brittle, similar to the Rare-Element Class of 

pegmatites which are considered to intrude under amphibolite facies conditions. It should also be 

noted that Pezzotta (2005) suggests the Malagasy pegmatites do not always fit the classic genetic 

model for pegmatites and many of the Malagasy pegmatites, including Beravina, have their own 

unique characteristics or characteristics of a number of the pegmatite types. 

Most pegmatites occur in swarms or pegmatite fields which may occupy areas ranging from tens 

to hundreds of square kilometres. They may be associated with a discrete granite source around 

which they are systematically distributed, from the least fractionated granite to the most highly 

evolved pegmatites with the latter located furthest from the granite source (London, 2008; Ercit, 

2005); however, this is not always the case. With increasing fractionation, there is often an increase 

in the complexity of the internal pegmatite zonation. The most highly evolved distal pegmatites are 

usually the most complexly zoned and are often associated with potentially economic 

concentrations of the elements and associated minerals identified above. 

Pegmatites may vary from a few metres to hundreds of metres in length with variable widths 

ranging from <1 m to tens of metres wide and may have simple to complex internal structure. 

Cameron et al. (1949) identified up to nine different in internal units within a pegmatite based on 

differences in mineral assemblage, modes and textures which may or may not be present and/or 

continuous in a given pegmatite. These are summarized as follows (Figure 8-2): 

1. Zones of primary crystallisation forming more or less complete or incomplete concentric 

shells (asymmetric zonation also common) from the margin inwards: 

i. Border zone; 

ii. Wall zone; 

iii. Intermediate zones (outer, middle, inner and core margin); and 

iv. Core. 

With progressive crystallisation from the margin to the core, these zones usually display 

increasing grain size, decreasing number of rock-forming minerals, increasing number of 

accessory minerals and a change in texture from granitic or aplitic through graphic or 

heterogeneous in the border, wall and intermediate zones to blocky and coarse-grained 

monomineralic in the core (Černý, 1991). It should be noted that this zoning is not always 

well developed and may be absent as is the case at pegmatites like Kamativi, Manono (in the 

DRC) and Arcadia (in Zimbabwe). 

2. Replacement bodies form at the expense of pre-existing units with or without lithologic 

and/or structural control and are often difficult to identify as such. Their effects range from 

selective replacement of individual mineral species (e.g. micas after beryl or topaz), through 

to pervasive, yet diffuse, assemblages (e.g. albite and Li-mica after K-feldspar) replacing the 

primary minerals of an entire zone, to mappable, massive metasomatic units (e.g. massive 

lepidolite units and saccharoidal or platy albite units) replacing the bulk of the primary 

assemblage in pre-existing unit(s) (Cerný, 1991). These units can also contain potentially 

economic concentrations of cassiterite and columbo-tantalite.  

3. Fracture fillings may be associated with primary zones or replacement units and are 

structurally controlled. These units are easily identified and generally insignificant. They are 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 41 

usually quartz-filled fractures emanating from the core and crosscutting the intermediate 

zones. At Beravina the late stage cross-cutting quartz veins contain minor zircon 

mineralisation. 

Figure 8-2

The economic mineralisation associated with pegmatites is usually associated with the intermediate, 

core margin and core zones and comprises mainly coltan, tin, Li minerals, Rb in K-feldspar and Cs 

in pollucite but will vary depending on the chemical composition of the pegmatite melts and may 

include anomalous concentrations of minerals such as zircon. Late stage replacement bodies are 

also common and comprise a variety of minerals which are dependent on the composition of the 

pegmatite's melts. Beravina is unique in this sense as the mineralisation is associated with the outer 

zone of the pegmatite. However, the spatial location of the zone may not necessarily be indicative 

of the temporal association of the zone within the pegmatite and the brecciated nature of the zircon 

crystals in places indicates that the mineralisation may be a late stage phase within the pegmatite.

9 EXPLORATION 

The exploration activities included in the current (2017-2018) phase of exploration were undertaken 

to provide data that could be used to inform a Mineral Resource estimate in accordance with 

disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). Sampling was also done for metallurgical test work (see 

Section 13). 

In addition to the sampling conducted in 2018, two site inspections were undertaken to confirm 

the geology, drill hole collars, site layout and infrastructure (see Section 12). 

 

9.1 Data Review and Core Inspection (late 2017) 

In November 2017, an initial review of the available exploration data was done, in conjunction with 

an inspection of the drill core from the Beravina Project, stored at DFR's core storage facility in 

Antananarivo.  

Following an inspection of the historical assay results and the core, the following observations were 

made: 

• some of the core in the boxes was upside down and did not fit together properly;  

• some of the split core was laid end-to-end and not packed correctly. This reportedly 

happened as the result of the transfer of all core to new core boxes; 

• there are no metre marks or sample mark-ups on the drill core; 

• no geological logs and recovery logs were available;  

• the historical sampling was discontinuous through the mineralisation; 

• no documentary evidence, necessary for the verification and assurance of the quality of the 

assay results, is available describing the use of QA/QC samples, referee samples or 

procedures followed for the initial sampling campaigns in 2006 and 2011; 

• historical sampling was not consistently done, for example:  

o intervals of drill core were cut and sampled, but no assay results reported (e.g. S6); 

o drill core in the core trays is unsampled, but historical assay values for these intervals 

have been previously reported; 

o drill core was selectively and discontinuously sampled through the mineralized zones, 

with no sampling of the hanging wall or footwall; and 

• the condition of the drill core was not recorded, i.e., there are no rock quality designation 

(RQD) logs, no metre marking, no core quality logs and core loss was not recorded. 

 

  



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 43 

9.2 Relogging and Sampling Programme (early 2018) 

Following the outcomes of the work conducted in late 2017, the following work programme was 

executed: 

• relogging of the historical core, which included checking the core integrity and metre 

marking, lithological logging, mineralisation logging, core recovery, core quality, RQD and 

core photography; 

• resampling of the historical core through the previously sampled intersections and previously 

unsampled intersections (see Section 6): 

o this included the implementation of a QA/QC programme for the sample assays; 

o the sampling was done in order to provide data to inform a Mineral Resource 

classification;  

o sampling was done for metallurgical test work; and 

• a site visit was undertaken in order to confirm the mapped geology and drill collar locations. 

 

9.2.1 Core Relogging 

The drill core was transferred by DFR into new wooden core trays, as the old core trays had decayed 

severely. A number of problems were noted on inspection of the core trays, including the lack of 

metre marks on the drill core and the incorrect orientation of core in some of the boxes.  

Prior to any logging and sampling of the core, the drill core was re-orientated, the metre mark-up 

was done, and recovery logging completed. Figure 9-1 illustrates the condition of the drill core 

before and after relogging and mark-up by MSA.  

The logging included the capture of information including RQD, recovery and lithological logging 

on hardcopy logs before these were entered into an electronic Microsoft Excel® template. Historical 

drill logs were only made available to MSA in May 2018 after the relogging exercise was complete. 

These logs were compared to the logging completed by MSA to verify that the integrity of the core 

had been maintained during the core repacking process (see Section 12). The historical sampling 

data was used to guide the current sampling programme

9.2.2 Resampling of Drill Core 

The drill core was logged, the recoveries noted, and metre markings added before being resampled 

continuously, including the taking of hanging wall and footwall samples. A comparison of the 

historical sampling intervals compared with the 2018 samples taken by MSA is shown in Table 9-1. 

The drill core was sampled using the historical sample intervals as a guide. Any intervals smaller 

than 1.0 m of waste rock within the mineralized material were also sampled and where possible, 

hanging wall and footwall samples were taken. Due to core loss and/or mis-oriented core, it was 

not always possible to sample the drill core in a consistent manner. For example, drill hole S9 bisV 

had no metre marking, no top of hole indication and no mineralisation present. Additionally, four 

boxes of core were marked "FOL" and MSA could not orientate or reconcile any of this core with 

any other drill holes.

During the resampling, a set of metallurgical samples were also taken (see Section 13). The historical 

assay results were used as a guide for the metallurgical sample groupings. The samples were group 

into four categories based on the historically reported zirconium and thorium contents (Table 9-2).

10 DRILLING 

No drilling was undertaken during the 2017-2018 exploration programme as the historical drilling 

was deemed sufficient for providing classification of an Indicated Mineral Resource. Historical 

drilling is described in Section 6.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling  

During the 2018 resampling, a total of 165 samples were taken – 127 samples over the intervals 

that coincided with the historical samples and an additional 38 samples from previously unsampled 

intervals within the mineralized zones, as well as hanging wall and footwall samples where possible. 

All samples were submitted to SGS South Africa for sample preparation and assay. SGS South Africa 

is accredited by SANAS (South African National Standard) and conforms to the requirements of 

ISO/IEC 17025 for the analytical methods used as per Table 11-1.

Samples the core had previously been sampled, so the remaining core was half core or three-

quarter core. The remaining core was split using a core saw into quarters. One quarter was sent for 

assay and another quarter was sent for metallurgical testing, after the samples were taken there is 

little to no remaining core over the sampled intervals in the historical core. 

No metallurgy testing was undertaken on unsampled portions of the historical core. 

 

11.2 Sample QA/QC 

In addition to the laboratory QA/QC programme routinely implemented by SGS South Africa using 

pulp duplicate analysis and internal blank and standards, MSA implemented an external QA/QC 

protocol comprising the insertion of certified reference materials (CRMs) and blanks on a systematic 

basis amongst the samples shipped to SGS South Africa (discussed below). These were inserted at 

a frequency of 1 blank, 1 CRM and 1 duplicate for every 30 samples (giving an average insertion 

rate of approximately 10 %) (Table 11-2). There was insufficient core for systematic duplicates, 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 50 

however 34 umpire samples were selected from the pulps and sent to ALS Vancouver to verify the 

results, see Section 11.5.

11.3 Certified Reference Materials 

No suitable zirconium CRM could be sourced for the sampling programme. A CRM, OREAS464 (a 

REE Carbonatite standard) with U and Th concentrations within the expected range of 

concentrations of the samples was sourced from Ore Research & Exploration in Australia, and 

inserted into the sample stream (see Table 11-3).

Figure 11-1 and Figure 11-2 show the performance of the SGS South Africa laboratory for the U 

and Th analyses respectively.  

A number of the U analyses of the CRM samples fall outside the 2×Standard Deviation (SD) but 

only two of the samples fall above a +20 % error limit (or 21.12 ppm U); one sample reported 26 

ppm U and the other 22.2 ppm U) (Figure 11-1). These two samples were located in the sample 

stream between two high-grade U samples and the elevated results may be the result of some 

minor carry-over by the during the analysis. Overall the U values returned slightly elevated results, 

average of 22.2 ppm U compared to the certified value of 17.5 ppm U and the performance of the 

U analyses is considered acceptable. 

Six of the nine CRM samples reported Th values within 20 % of the certified mean and four within 

2×SD (Figure 11-2). Overall the Th values returned an average of 484 ppm Th with 8 % lower than 

the certified mean of 527 ppm Th and the performance of the Th analyses is considered acceptable.

11.4 Blanks 

Blank silica chips (AMIS 439), sourced from African Mineral Standards in South Africa, were inserted 

into the sample stream as part of the external QA/QC protocol. at a frequency of one in every 30 

samples comprising ~7 % of the sample stream. Figure 11-3 plots the performance of the blank 

material used in the current resampling programme. The AMIS0439 samples reported Zr values

between 50 ppm and 814 ppm Zr showing minor cross contamination. However, this not considered 

material and the results are acceptable (Figure 11-3).  

The Hf values for the blank samples all returned values below the method detection limit (Figure 

11-4.

11.5 Check Laboratory Samples 

A total of 39 samples were submitted to ALS Chemex in Vancouver for check analyses by ME-MS89L 

(Table 11-4). The check samples submitted consisted of 35 pulp duplicate samples representing 

16 % of the total number of samples assayed by SGS South Africa, together with four AMIS484 

blanks (blank silica powder). The blanks all reported values below the method detection limit of 

0.01 % for ZrO2 and HfO2. 

The samples were selected across the ZrO2 grade range reported by SGS South Africa, ranging from 

<0.01 ppm ZrO2 to 44.5 % ZrO2 Figure 11-5 and Figure 11-6 compares the SGS South Africa sample 

assay results plotted against the ALS check sample results.

The ZrO2 results from the check laboratory (ALS Chemex, Vancouver) correlate well with the to the 

analyses reported by SGS South Africa (Figure 11-5). However, there was a positive bias to the ALS 

Chemex results, with respect to HfO2 results. This bias can be attributed to slight differences in the 

preparation and analytical methods between the laboratories. It should be noted also that the 

blanks inserted into the sample stream all reported as lower than detection limits for the ALS 

Chemex results. 

 

11.6 Conclusion 

The QPs (AJ van der Merwe and MS Cronwright) are of the opinion that the sample handling and 

logging protocols are considered in line with industry practice and that the samples are 

representative of the mineralisation. Overall the performance of the CRMs, blanks and check 

laboratory samples are considered acceptable. The assay methods used by SGS South Africa are in 

line with accepted industry standards and the assay results considered acceptable for use in the 

Mineral Resource estimate.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

As part of the initial exploration work conducted a verification process of the historical work and 

data was undertaken and detailed in Section 9.1. A summary of the work done is provided below: 

a review of the historical data and reports by MSA: 

• a site visit by Mr van der Merwe to confirm outcrop geology and the positions of drill hole 

collars on 20 November 2018; 

• a face to face interview by Mr van der Merwe with Mr Jannie Leeuwner, who was involved 

with the 2011-2012 exploration campaign; and 

• a site visit during 14-17 November 2017 by Mr Cronwright to confirm the condition of the 

core and design a sampling program for the Mineral Resource estimate. 

 

12.1 Historical Data Review 

Despite the historical assay result not being used in the Mineral Resource estimate a comparison 

was done using the 2018 assay results with the historical results. The comparison was made only 

with sample taken from the same intervals sampled for ZrO2 in the current and historical sampling 

campaigns (Figure 12-1) and shows: 

• there is a broad but poor correlation of the two datasets; and  

• the historical results have a +20 % bias on the ZrO2 values reported. 

The QA/QC programme implemented in the current sample programme included the use of a check 

laboratory which was used to confirm the accuracy of the current assay results (see Section 11.5).

12.2 Site Visit 

The collars for drill holes S1, S2, S3 and S4 could not be found on site during the site visit by Mr 

van der Merwe. The positions given for these holes were most likely done by a hand-held GPS 

instrument, and the X, Y location is probably within an error of +/- 8 m. The elevations given for 

these drill holes may be out by several tens of metres.  

The collars for drill holes S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S9bisV, S10, S11 and S12 were all confirmed during 

the site visit, and the locations surveyed by hand-held GPS (Garmin Oregon 350). The X, Y location 

with this instrument is within an error of ± 3 m, and the results correlated reasonably well with the 

historically reported locations for these drill holes. The vertical error of the hand-held instrument is 

not known but is likely to be several tens of metres. The drill hole collars provided historically are 

accepted as having been surveyed by an accurate differential GPS (DGPS) instrumental setup. Figure 

12-2 shows photographic evidence of the collars, and all collar positions were confirmed by 

handheld GPS readings.

Figure 12-2 

Collar positions confirmed during site visit 

 

 

Graphical logs for drill holes S9, S9 bisV, S10, S11 and S12 were provided to MSA by DFR following 

the completion of the relogging and resampling exercise described in Section 9. A comparison of 

this data to the data collected by MSA was done. The depths and widths of the mineralized zones 

the geological logging in both datasets were checked and found to be comparable. This provided 

confirmation that, despite the drill core having been transferred to new core boxes and some issues 

regarding the repacking, the overall integrity of the drill core had been preserved. 

The geology logged in the drill core and observed during the site inspections confirms historical 

accounts described in the reports provided by DFR.  

 

12.3 Database Validation 

MSA was responsible for the collection of the geological and sampling data. The logging data was 

captured from into a pre-validated Excel® template by the geologist responsible for the logging 

and sampling. 

The checks done on the data included duplicate drill hole IDs, end of hole depths, collar locations, 

checks for overlaps in the sampling and lithology logs, duplicate sample IDs 

 

12.4 Conclusion 

The data verification concluded that the historical assays could not be verified to within reasonable 

limits and as a result all core was resampled and historical assays were discarded for use in the 

Mineral Resource estimate. 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 58 

The drill core integrity was preserved during the repacking process, despite some minor issues. The 

new data collected was suitable for use in the Mineral Resource estimate and the historical logging 

data was only used as a guide to confirm the integrity of the drill core had been maintained.  

The data verification process also confirmed that drill hole collars S4 to S9 were accurate, but S1 to 

S3 utilised historical data for the Mineral Resource estimate as the collars could not be confirmed. 

The historical geological mapping was considered an accurate representation of the geology of the 

Beravina Zircon deposit and acceptable for use in the classification of the Mineral Resource.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

DFR commissioned SGS South Africa and MSA, under the project leadership of HATCH 

(Johannesburg), to conduct metallurgical testwork including mineralogy, metallurgy and other 

deposit characteristics, in advance of an intended drill programme aimed at increasing confidence 

in the possibility of producing a commercially viable concentrate product. 

 

13.1 Primary Zircon Concentrate Recovery 

A review of the independent 2012 JORC-compliant Indicated Mineral Resource estimate undertaken 

by Badger Mining and Consulting (Pty) Ltd raised concerns that the resource may contain significant 

radioactive elements and therefore metamict zircon, which could potentially impact on the 

economics of the project. Metamict zircon is formed over time, as a result of the impact of 

radioactive decay of U and Th on the crystal structure of the zircon crystal. 

The test work programme was established to determine: 

• the potential to upgrade the zircon by a combination of heavy liquid and magnetic 

separation; 

• the potential to reject U, Th during the magnetic separation process, and the potential to 

reject various impurities from the primary concentrates by flotation; and 

• whether metamict zircon can be distinguished from less altered zircon based on the U and 

Th content of the sample. 

 

13.1.1 Sample Composite Generation 

A total of 108 individual samples were used to generate four composited samples (Group 1 to 

Group 4) with a range of Th values. Group 1 represented the lowest Th samples, with progressively 

increasing Th content through Group 2 and 3 to Group 4, which had the highest Th content. The 

samples used to generate each composite are listed in Appendix 1. 

Each sample was then crushed in stages to -1 mm and split into aliquots for feed assay, particle size 

determination and heavy liquid separation. 

An aliquot of each sample was submitted for head assay by major element X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 

and multi-element inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry. Abbreviated head assays 

are presented in Table 13-1 and Table 13-2, the full assays appearing in Appendix 2.

The samples contain between 11.5 % and 17.9 % ZrO2, with an averaged HfO2 content of 0.29 %. 

Thorium concentrations range from 119 ppm in Group 1 to 1,820 ppm in Group 4. 

It is worthwhile noting the presence of certain elements which may have some effect when 

attempting to upgrade the zircon or could themselves be upgraded to offer additional revenue if 

sold as by products. Of particular interest is the presence of zinc (Zn) probably as sphalerite in these 

samples. Note that fluorine (F) was not included in the element package but could be present in 

significant amounts. The presence of the rare earth elements (notably Dy, Er, Gd, Ho, Lu, Nd, Yb) is 

likely related to thorite and columbite along zircon margins and as discrete phases as noted by 

Townsend (2014). 

 

13.1.2 Particle Size Distribution 

The aliquot for particle size determination was screened progressively at 850 μm, 425 μm, 212 μm, 

106 μm, 53 μm and 25 μm by a combination of wet and dry screening. The resulting fractions were 

dried and weighed. The results of the screen analyses show that the four samples (after being 

crushed to -1 mm) had very similar particle size distributions. With Group 1 slightly finer and Group 

4 slightly coarser (see Figure 13-1 and Table 13-3).

13.1.3 Heavy Liquid and Magnetic Separation 

A 2 kg aliquot of each sample was wet screened at 45 μm. The resulting fractions were dried and 

weighed. The +45 μm fraction was subjected to heavy liquid separation (HLS) using 

tetrabromoethane (TBE) at an SG of 2.96. The products were washed, dried and weighed. An aliquot 

of the floats, sinks and slimes (-45 μm fraction) was submitted for major element XRF and multi-

element ICP. 

An aliquot of the sinks was subjected to magnetic separation by Carpco at 0.5 A, 1.0 A, 1.5 A, 2.0 A, 

2.5 A and 2.7 A current settings. The amount of material reporting to each magnetic fraction was 

low and the magnetic fractions were combined to form a single magnetic product. The resulting 

magnetic and non-magnetic fractions were analysed for major elements by XRF and multi-element

Heavy liquid and magnetic separation on the -1 mm material proved effective in recovering the 

ZrO2, with an average recovery of 92 % to the final non-magnetic fraction. This fraction had an 

average grade of 53 % ZrO2. However, while the process was successful at recovering zircon, it was 

not effective in rejecting Th, Ca, S or Zn, all of which were upgraded in the final non-magnetic 

product. The presence of these elements placed a restriction on the ZrO2 grade and Th content of 

the final product which could be generated. 

Detailed analyses of the non-magnetic product are included in Table 13-5 and Table 13-6, with the 

additional data (including detailed assays of the other products) presented in Appendix 4. Besides 

the significant upgrades of Zr, Hf, Th and U into the sinks non-magnetics, note should also be taken 

of the upgrades in Ca, Zn, S, Nb and Y into this fraction.

13.1.4 XRD Analysis 

An XRD analysis was carried out on an aliquot of the non-magnetic fraction of each group sample 

to determine if a correlation exists between the Th content of the composite and the crystal 

properties of the zircon.  

Sample preparation (particularly pulverising of the sample) was kept rigidly consistent across all of 

the samples to ensure that variation in the results was not introduced during sample preparation.  

The XRD analyses were conducted using a Panalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer, employing Co-Kα 

radiation. The resulting data was processed using HighScore Plus, with the unit cell parameters 

determined by structural refinement.  

The results of the XRD analyses, on the Groups 1 to 4 non-magnetic fractions, and the zircon 

structural refinement are presented in Table 13-7, Figure 13-3 and Figure 13-4. The results show a 

progressive increase in the unit cell dimensions from Group 1 to Group 4. In the case of the Groups 

1, 3 and 4 samples, there is a linear relationship between this expansion in the unit cell and the Th 

content. The Group 2 sample shows higher expansion than would be expected given the Th content 

of this sample.  

The zircon in all of the samples produced strong well-defined peaks (the broad appearance of the 

peaks is because it was necessary to zoom in a great deal on the main zircon peak to show the shift 

in peak position from one sample to another). These well-defined peaks are an indication that the 

zircon is not amorphous. However, the expansion of the unit cell seen in the Groups 2, 3 and 4 non-

mag samples reflects structural damage. 

Groups 1, 3 and 4 show a linear correlation between crystal structure damage and Th content. Group 

2 deviates from this trend and shows more damage than would be expected given the Th content 

of the sample.

13.1.5 QEMSCAN Bulk Modal Analysis 

Two transverse, and two normal polished sections, were prepared from the non-magnetic fraction 

of each sample. The transverse polished sections were analysed by QEMSCAN Bulk Modal Analysis 

(BMA), in order to determine the major mineralogy of each sample.  

  



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 69 

The normal polished sections were analysed by QEMSCAN Trace Mineral Search (TMS) in order to 

determine the mode of occurrence of Th in the samples, including:  

• Thorium host minerals, 

• grain size distribution, and 

• liberation, exposure and association characteristics. 

 

The results of the BMA are presented in Table 13-8 and Figure 13-5. Each of the non-magnetic 

fractions are dominated by zircon. Other phases are present in minor to trace amounts. Of these, 

quartz, fluorite and sulphides (particularly sphalerite) were most abundant. Finer milling would likely 

liberate quartz from the zircon, allowing for it to be separated based on the density contrast of the 

two minerals. However, the density and magnetic properties of sphalerite and fluorite are such, that 

even if they were liberated from the zircon, they would not be readily separable from zircon by 

density and magnetic separation.

13.1.6 QEMSCAN Trace Mineral Search 

Thorite was the only Th mineral detected in the sample. The thorite was generally fine-grained, with 

at least 60 % of thorite grains (and up to 100 %) less than 50 μm in size (Table 13-9 and Figure 

13-6). The thorite grain size distribution in Group 1 was skewed by a single, particularly coarse 

liberated thorite grain.

As with the grain size distribution, the liberation and association characteristics of the thorite in 

Group 1, was skewed by a single coarse liberated thorite grain. With the exception of this grain, 

almost all of the thorite in the non-magnetic fractions was locked (with a very strong zircon 

association). Table 13-10 indicates the degree of liberation of the various Th mineralisation within 

the Groups 1 to 4 samples. It may be concluded from the XRD and QEMSCAN work that there is 

metamict zircon present in all samples.

13.1.7 Discussion  

The four composite samples that were investigated as part of the initial study had ZrO2 contents of 

between 11.5 % and 17.9 % with an average HfO2 content of 0.29 %. The Th content of the samples 

varied from 119 ppm in Group 1 through to 1820 ppm in Group 4. Screen analysis of the samples 

(crushed to -1 mm) found that on average 8.6 % of the sample was -45 μm.  

Heavy liquid and magnetic separation on the -1 mm material proved effective in recovering the 

ZrO2, with an average stage recovery of 92 % to the final non-magnetic fraction. This fraction had 

an average grade of 53 % ZrO2. Other elements upgraded into the final non-magnetic fraction 

included Th, Ca, S and Zn. The presence of these elements placed a restriction on the ZrO2 grade 

and Th content of the final product which could be generated.  

The Th was found to occur in fine thorite grains, most of which were locked in zircon. The removal 

of these thorite grains would require a much finer grind. Calcium occurred mainly in fluorite, with a 

range of liberations observed, while Zn and S occurred mainly in sphalerite which also showed a 

range of liberations. In addition to these minerals, some rare earth minerals were also observed in 

the non-magnetic fraction.  

Finer milling will be required to achieve effective liberation of fluorite and sphalerite, however finer 

milling alone will not be sufficient as these minerals are heavy and non-magnetic and would thus 

not be separable from the zircon using density and magnetic separation techniques. It was initially 

thought that acid leaching may be an effective means of reducing the Th content of the non-

magnetic fraction. This could potentially be used to also dissolve the fluorite and sphalerite. 

However, there are significant health, safety and environmental risks that would need to be 

considered (as the resulting liquor would contain high concentrations of Th, but also because the 

dissolution of fluorite would result in the formation of hazardous hydrofluoric acid).  



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 73 

A safer alternative would be the removal of the sphalerite and fluorite by flotation. This approach 

may also allow for the generation of potentially valuable by-products (particularly a sphalerite 

concentrate), however it may add significantly to the capital and operating costs associated with 

processing this material and would also not address the Th content.  

If the domains containing zircon with low and high Th contents can be modelled, and possibly 

selectively mined, this may offer a solution to achieving zircon concentrates with specification 

<500 ppm U+Th. However, further test work will be required to develop a suitable process route 

that will attain such targets. 

 

13.2 Zircon Upgrading Testwork 

The physical separation test work has indicated that ZrO2 grades from 51 % to 58 % could be 

achieved with over 90 % recovery into a primary concentrate, employing only gravity and magnetic 

separation. Mineralogical test work has indicated that the -300 μm main gangue components 

(including sphalerite, pyrite, fluorspar, yttrofluorite and minor silicates) are liberated from the zircon.  

The upgrading test work was conducted to remove impurities such as silicates, sulphides and 

fluorspar from a primary zircon concentrate sample. The object of the test work was to attempt to 

upgrade the ZrO2 + HfO2 content to values of between 63 % to 65 % employing gravity separation, 

magnetic separation and flotation techniques. 

 

13.2.1 Sample Preparation and Head grade 

A total of 40 kg of the Group 2 sample was milled to -300 μm, then screened with a 150 μm and 

45 μm screen, generating 3 size fractions of +150 μm, -150 μm + 45 μm and -45 μm. Each size 

fraction and the head fraction were analysed for major elements (including Zr and Hf). The head 

sample and sized fractions were analysed for major elements, including ZrO2 and HfO2, by XRF 

borate fusion. Table 13-11 presents the head assays as determined by XRF borate fusion for major 

elements. The complete XRF analysis of the results is included in Appendix 2.

13.2.2 Shaking Table Test Work 

A sample was submitted for shaking table test work utilising a ¼ size Holman-Wilfley table. The 

table was configured to collect four products: 2×concentrates, a middling and a tailing sample. The 

tests were conducted on the screened feeds coarse (+150 μm) and fine (-150 μm + 45 μm) fractions. 

The shaking tables results for the coarse sample and fine samples are presented in Table 13-12 and 

Table 13-13 respectively.

13.2.3 Magnetic Separation Test work 

Magnetic separation was conducted separately on both the coarse and fine shaking table 

concentrates to remove any magnetic impurities. The test was conducted with a rare earth magnet 

with a magnetic strength of ~6000 Gauss. The magnetic separation test work results are presented

over 56 % in the fine sample fraction. The ZrO2 grades concurrently increased to 47.7 % in the 

coarse fraction non-magnetics and 51.1 % in the fines fraction non-magnetics. ZrO2 recoveries were 

94.6 % for the coarse sample and 83.8 % for the fines sample. 

 

13.2.4 Flotation Test work 

Reverse flotation test work was conducted on the combined coarse and fine non-magnetic 

fractions. The test work was directed at removing impurities, such as sulphide (mainly as sphalerite) 

and fluorite (fluorspar) utilising a sequential flotation technique. Three stages of rougher flotation 

were adopted for each sequence. The combined feed sample was milled to -150 μm and de-slimed 

over a 45 μm screen prior to flotation. The reagent and test conditions are presented in Table 13-17.

The sulphide flotation was successful in that over 98 % of the sulphur can be recovered to the 

concentrate. The use of the fatty acid collector, Rincalore R3-3F, for the flotation of fluorspar was 

relatively unsuccessful, with only 18 % of the fluorine recovered.  

The ZrO2 + HfO2 was upgraded to float tails from 50.1 % in the head to 51.8 %; with a stage recovery 

of around 98.3 %. The most abundant diluting element of the final zircon concentrate was SiO2. 

Chemical analysis indicates that there is a small amount of fluorspar in the non-magnetic fraction, 

which may explain the low recovery.  

 

13.2.5 Heavy Liquid Separation Testwork 

HLS was conducted on the reverse flotation product tailings (zircon concentrate) in an attempt to 

remove the SiO2 and further upgrade the zircon. A 500 g sample of de-slimed flotation tailings was 

subjected to HLS using TBE at a SG of 2.96. The mass of the floats and sinks were recorded, and 

aliquots submitted for major elements analysis. The HLS results are indicated in Table 13-19 below.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

On behalf of Diamond Fields Resources, MSA completed a Mineral Resource estimate for the 

Beravina Zircon Project (Beravina, the Project).  

To the best of the Qualified Person's knowledge there are currently no title, legal, taxation, 

marketing, permitting, socio-economic or other relevant issues that may materially affect the 

Mineral Resource other than those described in this Technical Report. 

The Mineral Resource estimate incorporates data derived from drill hole cores collected by two 

previous owners; Austral Resources and ALM-Forex. The cores were resampled in by MSA in 2018. 

The Mineral Resource was estimated using the 2003 CIM "Best Practice Guidelines for Estimation of 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" and classified in accordance with the "2014 CIM Definition 

Standards". It should be noted that Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. 

The Mineral Resource estimate was conducted using Datamine Studio RM software and Leapfrog 

Geo together with Microsoft Excel and Snowden Supervisor for data analysis. The Mineral Resource 

estimate was completed by Mr Jeremy Witley (Pr. Sci. Nat.), the Qualified Person for the Mineral 

Resource. Mr Anton Geldenhuys (Pr. Sci. Nat.) completed the geological modelling. 

 

14.1 Database 

The estimate was based on geochemical analyses and density measurements obtained from the 

cores of diamond drill holes. The drill holes were completed in 2006 and 2011 and were subjected 

to a re-logging and resampling exercise by MSA in 2018. There are no outstanding data of relevance 

to this estimate and the database is complete.  

Eleven holes inclined at 50° and two vertical holes were drilled at Beravina. Ten of the holes 

intersected the mineralized zone. The drill holes are between approximately 40 m and 104 m long. 

The drill hole intersections form two horizontal lines; one on the north side and the other on the 

south side of the deposit. 

The drill hole data are stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that were managed by MSA. The 

information contained in these spreadsheets, includes collar surveys, lithology, and sample assays. 

Assays of relevance to this estimate include ZrO2 (%), HfO2 (%), ThO2 (ppm) and U3O8 (ppm). 

 

14.2 Exploratory Analysis of Raw Data 

14.2.1 Validation of the Data 

MSA undertook a high-level validation process which included the following checks: 

• examining the sample assay, collar information, and geology data to ensure that the data 

were complete for all drill holes; 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 80 

• examining the de-surveyed data in three dimensions to check for gross spatial errors and 

their position relative to mineralisation; 

• examination of the assay data in order to ascertain whether they are within expected ranges; 

and 

• checks for "FROM-TO" errors, to ensure that the sample data do not overlap one another or 

that there are no unexplained gaps in the sampling. 

The data validation process revealed the following: 

• no density data are available. 

• downhole surveys were not completed and instead the collar inclination and direction were 

applied to the entire drill hole; 

• the drill holes plotted in their expected positions; 

• no overlaps or unexplained gaps were found in the sampling; 

• one ThO2 value of 2,500 ppm occurs in the database. This is more than twice the next highest 

value of 1,200 ppm. Scatterplots revealed that this assay could fit with the general bi-variate 

relationships between the other assays and it was retained in the data; 

• both historical and recent assays exist. The historical assays were discarded in favour of the 

recent assays generated from the re-sampling as the recent assays were subjected to QAQC 

and the sampling and logging protocols are known; 

• the assays for two samples were not present in the database (hole number S3 – a 0.5 m 

sample at the end of the sampled interval, and hole number S11 – a 1.5 m sample within the 

sampled interval). The missing values were assigned null ("-") values in the data as they were 

considered missing data rather than unmineralized zones; and 

• sampling was selective outside of the main mineralized zone so that only cores that were 

considered as having potential to contain zircon mineralisation were sampled. For this 

reason, all unsampled cores were assigned zero values. 

The validated data were considered acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation. The lack of 

downhole survey data will not materially impact on the estimate as the drill holes are short. The 

missing sample assay data represent two out of 165 samples, which is not considered material. 

 

14.2.2 Statistics of Sample Length 

Sample lengths are between 0.1 m and 2.0 m with the most common sample length being 1.0 m 

(Figure 14-1). 75 % of the sample lengths are 1.0 m or less. No relationship between sample length 

and grade was observed.

14.2.3 Statistics of Assay Data 

The univariate statistics of the un-composited sample assays are presented in Table 14-1. The 

statistics presented in Table 14-1 are for all samples taken from the different lithologies at Beravina. 

The standard deviation is low relative to the mean, despite the high range.

ZrO2 (%) 163 0.005 44.50 12.16 67.5 8.22 

 

14.2.4 Bivariate Statistics 

Scatterplots of the un-composited sample assay grades were constructed in order to assess if there 

is correlation between any of the variables (Figure 14-2). Strong relationships between variables 

should be considered in the choice of estimation parameters applied. The scatterplots reveal that a 

weak positive linear correlation exists between ThO2 and ZrO2, ThO2 and HfO2, and ThO2 and U3O8. 

A moderate positive linear correlation exists between U3O8 and ZrO2, and U3O8 and HfO2, and a 

strong positive linear correlation exists between ZrO2 and HfO2. The correlated data suggest that 

estimation parameters of these variables should be aligned in order to maintain these correlations 

in the estimate.

14.2.5 Core Recovery 

An interval of poor core recovery occurs over approximately 2 m in the mineralized zone of drill 

hole S1. This is a relatively low grade and narrow intersection that may have been affected by a 

discontinuity. The average core recovery is approximately 81 % for all drill hole core lengths, and 

core recovery in the sampled intervals in the mineralized zone was greater than 89 % (with the 

exception of S1), which is considered reasonable for this style of mineralisation and is unlikely to 

result in sample bias.

14.2.6 Summary of Exploratory Analysis of the Raw Dataset 

• The drilling information is stored in several spreadsheets. The current data management 

solution is considered adequate for a project at an early stage, but MSA recommends that 

the data should to be transferred to a more suitable relational database as the project 

progresses. 

• The validation process did not reveal any overlaps, duplicates or unexplained gaps in the 

sampling data.  

• Two missing sample assays were assigned a null value.  

• One potentially out of limit ThO2 value was identified. Bivariate analysis indicates that the 

2,500 ppm value is possible and therefore it was retained. 

• There are no density values. 

• Down-hole surveys were not completed. 

• The most frequent sample length is one metre and the maximum sample length is 2 m. 

• The variance of the sample assay data is not high. 

• The different sample assays are correlated and the relationship between ZrO2 and HfO2 is 

particularly strong. 

 

14.3 Topography 

The Beravina pegmatite forms a prominent hill that rises above approximately 50 m from the 

surrounding topography. A topographic model was constructed using Leapfrog Geo from Shuttle 

Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data sourced from the public domain. 

The collar positions were projected vertically to the topography. 

It is the opinion of the QP that the resolution of the topographic surface is acceptable for this level 

of project study. A detailed topographic surface will be required when the project progresses to the 

next phase of exploration or a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). 

 

14.4 Geological Modelling 

The lithological logging was examined with respect to the interpreted geological model data and 

the codes were grouped into four units; overburden (OVB), hanging wall (HW), mineralisation (MIN) 

and footwall (FW). The geological map was imported into Leapfrog Geo and simplified strings were 

digitized on the major unit contacts. Solids were then modelled from the mapping and drilling data 

using Leapfrog Geo. An intrusion described as magmatic breccia was modelled in the immediate 

footwall to the east, based on the mapping data. 

The mineralized unit was modelled as a sheath of mineralisation with hanging wall in the core and 

surrounded by footwall (Figure 14-3). The mineralized zone plunges to the north at between 

approximately 50° and 65° and is generally between approximately 10 m and 20 m wide.

The drill hole data from the footwall, mineralisation and hanging wall zones were extracted 

separately using the wireframe models. Each of the aforementioned zones was treated as a separate 

estimation domain. The footwall and hanging wall domains represent waste domains that contain 

sporadic and discontinuous zircon mineralisation. 

 

14.6 Statistical Analysis 

The samples were composited to 1 m lengths. Composites were calculated using length weighting. 

The compositing method did not allow for any discarding of sample length and so the actual length 

of the mineralized zone was close to 1 m, varying from 0.95 m to 1.09 m. The composite sample 

data were declustered by weighting by the number of samples in 25 m by 25 m by 25 m cells. 

 

14.6.1 Composite Statistics  

The means and coefficients of variation (CV) of the composite sample assays for the mineralized 

domain are shown in Table 14-2 and the histograms are presented in Figure 14-4. 

The distributions of all grades show a slight positive skewness, with low to moderate coefficient of 

variation, demonstrating that the variability is low.

ThO2 (ppm) 106 0.00 1632.20 447.95 0.75 0.6 

The waste domains are characterized by elevated grades where mineralisation was identified and 

the core was sampled. These samples occur within unsampled zones where the assumption was 

made that grades are zero. 

The footwall waste domain extends outwards from the mineralized zone with the higher grades 

generally being limited to close to the mineralisation contact. In order to avoid spreading of 

elevated grades deeper into the unmineralized footwall portion of the model, top cuts (capping) 

were applied to the footwall composite data. The top cut removed the tail from the distribution as 

exhibited by the histogram. The hanging wall domain is limited in extent and enclosed by the 

mineralized domain, therefore top-cuts were not applied.

14.7 Geostatistical Analysis 

There are insufficient numbers of data for meaningful geostatistical analysis. 

 

14.8 Block Model 

A block model was constructed with cell dimensions of 10 mX by 10 mY by 10 mZ. The block size 

was chosen based on the drill hole spacing, which is a minimum of approximately 10 m along each 

line. The wireframes representing surfaces of lithological contacts were filled with cells to a 

minimum sub-cell size of 1 mX by 1mY by 1 mZ in order to best fill the solid wireframes below the 

topographic surface. 

The blocks were coded with the respective mineralisation and waste codes. 

 

14.9 Grade Estimation 

Since variograms could not be modelled, but an assumption of a spatial grade relationship was 

made, all the assayed variables were estimated using inverse distance weighting to the power of 

two. Grades were estimated into parent cells. The minimum number of composites required to 

estimate a cell was four and the maximum was restricted to twelve. 

The same search parameters were used to estimate all the grade variables in the mineralized 

domain as shown in Table 14-4. A three-pass search strategy was used for estimation, with the first 

search range set at 50 mX by 50mY by 50 mZ in order to include the closest surrounding drill holes 

in all directions. The second search was twice the first search range, and the third was ten times the 

first search in order to estimate all the cells in the model. The search ellipse was omnidirectional to 

fit with the shape of the mineralized body with no defined grades trends within it.

A restrictive search approach was used for the hanging wall and footwall domains. For the hanging 

wall domain, a single omnidirectional search of 20 m was applied. Any cells not estimated by this 

search were assigned zero values. For the footwall domain, an omnidirectional search of 10 m was 

applied to the uncapped data and an omnidirectional search of 20 m was applied to the capped 

data. The cells estimated by the capped data search were overwritten by the limited number of cells 

estimated by the short, uncapped data search and any unestimated cells were assigned zero values. 

 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 88 

14.10 Density Estimation 

Density was not measured on the core. Given the high density of zircon (4.65 t/m3) relative to the 

gangue mineralogy, density was assigned to the individual block model cells based on the 

estimated grade of ZrSiO4 (converted from ZrO2) with an assumption that the gangue minerals have 

a density of 2.65 t/m3. The footwall, hanging wall and intrusive domains were assigned constant 

density values so that density for each domain was applied as follows: 

• Mineralisation : (ZrSiO4 grade × 4.65) + ((100 - ZrSiO4 grade) × 2.65) / 100 

• Footwall  : 2.70 

• Hanging wall : 2.65 

• Intrusive : 2.75 

As part of any future Mineral Resource confidence upgrade, it is recommended that actual density 

measurements on the cores are used to estimate density. 

 

14.11 Model Validation 

Validation of estimated grades was undertaken using the following methods: 

• Visual examination of the input data against the block model estimates; and 

• Comparison of the input data statistics against the model statistics. 

The block model was examined visually in sections to ensure that the drill hole grades were locally 

well represented by the model and it was found that the model validated reasonably well against 

the data. 

The average grades of the mineralized domain model compare well to the average grade of the 

de-clustered sample composites (de-clustered to 25 mX by 25 mY by 25 mZ). Relative differences 

between the model grade and input data grade for the mineralized layer are generally small (Table 

14-5). The large relative percent difference for ThO2 was examined in more detail and was found to 

be due to the spatial arrangement and paucity of the data and that there are no problems with the 

modelling process.

14.12 Classification 

Classification of the Beravina Mineral Resource was based on confidence in the data, confidence in 

the geological model, grade continuity and variability, and the frequency of the drilling data. The 

main considerations in the classification of the Mineral Resource are as follows: 

• there is acceptable confidence in the accuracy and precision of the assay data; 

• the variability of the grades is low to moderate but there are insufficient numbers to 

accurately define the grade distribution or model spatial continuity; 

• the extent of the mineralisation was based on mapped outcrops on the hill and extension of 

the mineralisation down dip confirmed by drilling. Therefore, geological confidence in the 

general model is reasonable. However, the down-dip extent is not known and drill holes at 

depth could indicate that changes to the mineralisation may occur; 

• the drill hole spacing is too wide to provide local estimates and therefore the estimate should 

be considered as global in nature; 

• the drill hole intersections form two horizontal lines; one on the north side and the other on 

the south side of the deposit and grade estimates are largely based on extrapolation up and 

downdip from the drill holes; 

• there are no density data. Density was estimated based on the expected gangue density and 

the estimated proportion of ZrSiO4 in the block model cells; and 

• the topography was not accurately surveyed and is based on SRTM data. 

Given the nature and spacing of the data, the Mineral Resource was classified as Inferred. The down-

dip extent of the Mineral Resource was limited to 50 m from the deepest drill hole and halfway 

between S9 and S9BisV, as S9BisV did not intersect recognisable mineralisation (Figure 14-5).

14.13 Depletion of Mineral Resource 

The Mineral Resource was cut to the modelled topographic surface where it outcrops. No mining 

is known to have taken place. 

 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 91 

14.14 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resource was estimated using The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum (CIM) Best Practice Guidelines and is reported in accordance with the 2014 CIM 

Definition Standards, which have been incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101 

– Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). The Mineral Resource is classified into 

the Inferred category as shown in Table 14-6.  

The Mineral Resource is reported at a cut-off grade of 9% ZrO2, which is the lowest grade block 

estimate within the mineralisation model. Given reasonably assumed high-level cost and revenue 

assumptions, and the relatively high grade of the deposit, the QP considers that mineralisation at 

this cut-off grade will satisfy the test for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction 

(RPEEE). 

It should be noted that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability and the application of economic parameters used to assess the potential for 

economic extraction is not an attempt to estimate Mineral Reserves, the level of study so far carried 

out being insufficient with which to do so.

Notes: 

1. All tabulated data have been rounded and as a result minor computational errors may occur. 

2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. 

3. ThO2 and U3O8 are "deleterious elements" 

4. Determining of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" was based on the following cost 

and revenue assumptions*: 

a. zircon price of USD 950 per tonne of ZrO2 concentrate 

b. 90% concentrator recovery of ZrO2 to the concentrate, based on initial metallurgical testing 

c. mining cost of USD 20 per tonne of mineralised material 

d. concentrator costs of USD 20 per tonne of plant feed 

e. general and administration cost (G&A) of USD 20 per tonne of treated material 

f. transport cost of USD 150 per tonne concentrate from the mine to China. 

*Note that these cost and revenue assumptions are selected for the sole reason of establishing "reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction" and should not be interpreted in any way to represent a 

techno-economic assessment of the Beravina Zr deposit. 

 

A grade tonnage curve illustrating the sensitivity of grade and tonnes to cut-off grade is shown in

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

The Beravina material has been shown to be shown to be responsive to a number of processing 

options including dense media separation, magnetics and reverse flotation. Although further 

development work needs to be undertaken, an un-optimized flowsheet is indicated below, which 

allows for the calculation of a preliminary mass balance. 

 

17.1 Potential Flowsheet 

A flowsheet based on the upgrading test work would consist of the following unit operations: 

• crushing of the feed to 1 mm followed by: 

• screening at 150 µm; 

• desliming of the fine fraction at 45 µm; 

• feeding the coarse +150 µm fraction to a shaking table with magnetic separation on the 

sinks; 

• feeding the +45 µm -150 µm fraction to shaking table with magnetic separation on the sinks; 

• combined milling of both non-magnetic concentrates; 

• desliming of the resultant float feed at 45 µm; 

• sulphide flotation with the flotation tailings being forwarded to the following stage; 

• fluorspar flotation with the flotation tailings being forwarded to HLS; and 

• HLS with the sinks being the final zircon concentrate product. 

 

17.2 Recovery Estimates 

Based on the above unit operation flowsheet, and the results achieved during the upgrading 

testwork the overall expected mass balance is as indicated in Table 17-1 below. The XRF assay values 

on which the mass balance is based may be found in Appendix 4. 

Based on the test work done to date, the final ZrO2 concentrate grade would be around 57.7 % with 

an overall recovery of 49.8 %. HfO2 grade would be 1.19 % with a recovery of 48.7 %. The major 

contaminant is SiO2 at a grade of 37.8 %. The major losses of Zr are to the two desliming slimes 

which represent a total 25.6 % loss, and this will need to be addressed during ongoing test work.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

The current global zircon market supply base is completely dominated by output from traditional 

mineral sands operations, and customers have become used to a defined range of chemical 

specifications, as well as crystal properties such as angularity of grains and grain size. It is the 

combination of these factors that characterise the suitability of zircon for specific end use markets. 

The Beravina zircon product, being a hard rock zircon deposit, is therefore unique and will be viewed 

as such in the overall marketplace when compared to zircon products from the traditional mineral 

sand operations, and which is why customer testing will be required to define the suitability of the 

Beravina product. 

Current metallurgical test work on Beravina mineralization has produced zircon concentrate 

products in the range of 50 % to 60 % ZrO2 (plus HfO2). This compares to the theoretical 

composition of a zircon mineral of 67 % ZrO2 (plus HfO2). For a theoretical 62 % ZrO2 (plus HfO2) 

Beravina zircon concentrate product, initial feedback from zircon concentrate processors suggests 

that the zircon chemical market could be a suitable end use application in its current projected form 

and without the requirement for further upgrading. As such, samples of a Beravina concentrate 

product have been sent for testing with selected major zircon chemical producers in China, which 

is the dominant global market for zircon chemical manufacture. 

The largest market for zirconium is the ceramic industry with zircon additives in chemical 

applications the second largest global end use market for zircon. The demand for the chemicals 

sector is growing faster than demand in the ceramics industry. Zircon concentrate production in 

2017 was estimated at 1,600,000 tonnes and global demand follows supply quite tightly but supply 

is expected to remain in deficit of demand for 2018 (USGS, 2018). It also represents the high-tech 

end of the zircon market and has typically displayed the highest demand growth rates in recent 

years. Downstream products from the production of zirconium chemicals are highly diversified and 

include paper coatings, paint dryers, auto-catalysts and fire retardants. Zirconium chemicals are 

also utilized in antiperspirants and cosmetic applications, and for nuclear fuel tubing. The supply of 

zircon for the manufacture of zirconium chemicals is highly competitive and usually comprises 

standard grade zircon products, typically at the lower end of the zircon product quality spectrum. 

For these reasons a Beravina 62 % zircon concentrate product should be competitive, without 

further upgrade, with traditional zircon products in this market segment, albeit with a price discount. 

Looking further forward, existing mining operations will start depleting around 2021 and expected 

to decrease global supply further possibly increasing pricing and fuelling further demand for zircon 

(McCoy and Bender, 2018).

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Geology and Mineralisation 

The zircon mineralisation is contained within the Outer Zone, comprising quartz and zircon, of the 

pegmatite. This zone can be subdivided into: 

• a northern zone on the north of the Beravina hill which outcrops over a length of about 

140 m, with a thickness varying between 5 m and 12m and steep dips varying from 60° - 80° 

to the north, to 85º to the south towards the centre of the hill; and  

• a southern zone in the southern part of the hill which can be followed on surface for over 

150 m, occasionally forming massive south facing cliffs. The dips here are moderate, ranging 

from 20°- 40° to the north. The drill hole S2 showed that it is cut by a granite wedge. The 

exposed width varies from a few metres to 13 m. 

The zircon-quartz zone contains on average 20 % zircon either as disseminated euhedral crystals or 

agglomerations of crystals in the quartz; or as fillings in fractures and vugs. Associated with the 

zircon mineralisation is minor thorite (ThSiO4), which contain thorium and minor uranium, and 

fluorite which are considered deleterious minerals in zircon concentrates.  

The Beravina Pegmatite has characteristics of a number of pegmatite types but is best classified as 

NYF-family pegmatite of the Abyssal HREE Class but with characteristics of a Rare-element Class 

pegmatite.  

 

25.2 Exploration 

The exploration activities included in the current (2017-2018) phase of exploration were undertaken 

to provide data that could be used to inform a Mineral Resource estimate in accordance with 

disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). Sampling was also done for metallurgical test work (see 

Section 13). 

In addition to the sampling conducted in 2018, two site inspections were undertaken to confirm 

the geology, drill hole collars, site layout and infrastructure (see Section 12). 

 

25.3 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

The sample handling and logging protocols are considered in line with industry practice and the 

samples are representative of the mineralisation. Overall the performance of the CRMs, blanks and 

check laboratory samples are considered acceptable. The assay methods used by SGS South Africa 

are in line with accepted industry standards and the assay results considered acceptable for use in 

the Mineral Resource estimate.

25.4 Data Verification 

The data verification concluded that the historical assays could not be used and as a result all core 

was resampled. 

The drill core integrity was preserved during the repacking process, despite some minor issues. The 

new data collected was suitable for use in the Mineral Resource estimate and the historical data 

was only used as a guide.  

The data verification process also confirmed that drill hole collars S4- S9 were accurate, but S1 – S3 

utilized historical data for the Mineral Resource estimate as the collars could not be confirmed. The 

historical geological mapping was considered an accurate representation of the geology of the 

Beravina Zircon deposit and acceptable for use in the classification of the Mineral Resource. 

 

25.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork 

The key findings of the mineral processing and metallurgical testwork are as follows: 

• The four composite samples contained between 11.5 % and 17.9 % ZrO2, with an averaged 

HfO2 content of 0.29 %. Thorium concentrations range from 119 ppm in Group 1 to 1,820 

ppm in Group 4. 

• The average grade of the four composites was 14.63 % ZrO2, 0.29 % HfO2, 1.34 % CaO, 1.39 % 

Fe2O3 and 9.45 % SiO2. 

• Screen analysis of the samples (crushed to -1 mm) found that on average 8.6 % of the sample 

was <45 μm. 

• Heavy liquid and magnetic separation on the -1 mm material proved effective in recovering 

the ZrO2, with an average recovery of 92 % at an average grade of 53 % ZrO2 to the final 

non-magnetic fraction. 

• Whilst the HLS and magnetics work was successful in recovering Zr and rejecting Fe, it was 

not effective in rejecting Th, Ca, S or Zn; all of which were upgraded in the final non-magnetic 

product. 

 

Following the outcomes of the mineralogical study, a Group 2 sample was subjected to shaking 

table and HLS primary concentrate production, followed by sequential reverse flotation for 

sulphides, and subsequently fluorine to evaluate further rejection of these elements. The key 

outcomes of the upgrading test work are; 

• The sulphide float proved successful as a rejection process for S in that it removed 98 % of 

the sulphides, the sequential secondary float less successful in that it only removed 18 % of 

the fluorspar.  

• Following flotation, the resulting concentrate tailings product achieved a ZrO2 grade of 51 %, 

of at recoveries of around 98 %. S and F grades in the flotation tailings product were around 

0.02 % and 0.24 % respectively. The major diluting element was SiO2 at around 42 %. 



 

 

Beravina Zircon Project – NI 43-101 – 20 December 2018  Page: 107 

• Further HLS test work on the zircon flotation tailings product with TBE at an SG of 2.96 

rejected around 20 % of the SiO2 to the floats, whilst recovering around 97 % of the Zr to the 

sinks at a grade of 57 % ZrO2, 1.19 % HfO2 and 37.8 % SiO2. 

 

The mineralogical study to determine whether metamict zircon can be distinguished from less 

altered zircon based on the U and Th content of the sample returned the following findings: 

• Core samples from across the deposit confirmed the presence of metamict zircon and varying 

levels of uranium and thorium. 

• Thorium was found to occur in fine thorite grains, most of which were locked in zircon. The 

removal of these thorite grains would require a much finer grind than currently achieved. 

• Calcium occurred mainly in fluorite, with a range of liberations observed, while Zn and S 

occurred mainly as sphalerite which also showed a range of liberations. Flotation could be 

used to remove the sphalerite. In addition to these minerals, rare earths were also observed 

in the non-magnetic fractions. 

• Flotation would not address the Th content.  

 

25.6 Mineral Resource Estimates 

The Mineral Resource is reported at a cut-off grade of 9 % ZrO2, which is the lowest grade block 

estimate within the mineralisation model. Given reasonably assumed high-level cost and revenue 

assumptions, and the relatively high grade of the deposit, the QP considers that mineralisation at 

this cut-off grade will satisfy the test for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction 

(RPEEE). 

It should be noted that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability and the application of economic parameters used to assess the potential for 

economic extraction is not an attempt to estimate Mineral Reserves, the level of study so far carried 

out being insufficient with which to do so.

1. All tabulated data have been rounded and as a result minor computational errors may occur. 

2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. 

3. ThO2 and U3O8 are "deleterious elements". 

4. Determining of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" was based on the following cost 

and revenue assumptions*: 

a. zircon price of USD 950 per tonne of ZrO2 concentrate 

b. 90% concentrator recovery of ZrO2 to the concentrate, based on initial metallurgical testing 

c. mining cost of USD 20 per tonne of mineralised material 

d. concentrator costs of USD 20 per tonne of plant feed 

e. general and administration cost (G&A) of USD 20 per tonne of treated material 

f. transport cost of USD 150 per tonne concentrate from the mine to China. 

g. *Note that these cost and revenue assumptions are selected for the sole reason of establishing 

"reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" and should not be interpreted in any way 

to represent a techno-economic assessment of the Beravina Zr deposit. 

 

25.7 Recovery Methods 

The Beravina material has been shown to be responsive to a number of processing options 

including dense media separation, magnetics and reverse flotation.

26.1 Geology and Exploration  

Further exploration drilling is recommended to better delineate the zircon mineralisation within the 

Beravina Pegmatite. An additional 10 drill holes are planned as part of the future exploration 

programme with the aim of determining the extent of the zircon mineralisation under the scree 

covered areas in the east and west of the hill, and to determine the down dip extent of the 

mineralisation (Figure 26-1).  

Assessment of the zircon mineralisation contained within the surficial deposits is also 

recommended.

26.2 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Test Work 

Recommendations of mineral processing and metallurgical test work include: 

• A further drilling campaign to increase deposit confidence (see Section 26.1). If the domains 

containing zircon with low and high Th contents can be modelled, and possibly selectively 

mined, this may offer a solution to achieving zircon concentrates with specification 

<500 ppm U + Th. 

• Further test work will be required to develop a suitable process route that will attain such 

targets. It is anticipated that the refinement of the current processes, and the trialling of 

alternative processing solutions will improve concentrate grade and to further remove 

deleterious elements. 

• Acid leaching may be an effective means of reducing the Th content of the non-magnetic 

fraction. This could potentially be used to also dissolve the fluorite and residual sphalerite;  

• Market testing of various potential products will be required to determine the appetite for 

the achievable impurity levels. Further work is required to characterize the likely impact on 

product quality and suitability for end use markets. This work will also include product stream 

testing by end users and concentrate processors. 

• The sulphide flotation concentrate may result in a potentially valuable sphalerite concentrate 

by-product, the rougher concentrate containing 32 % sulphur without cleaning flotation.
