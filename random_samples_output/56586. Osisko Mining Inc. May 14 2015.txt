1.0 SUMMARY 

Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. ("Caracle Creek") of Toronto, Ontario, Canada was 

contracted by Oban Mining Corporation (Oban) to review the Miller Gold Property (the "Property") 

located in the Catharine, Pacaud, Boston and McElroy Townships in northeastern Ontario and prepare an 

Independent Technical Report (the "Report"), compliant with National Instrument 43-101 ("NI43-101"), 

companion policy NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F1.   

The Property is located in the Larder Lake Mining Division of Northeastern Ontario 18 km south of 

Kirkland Lake and 5 km east of the village of Boston Creek within the Catharine, Pacaud, Boston and 

McElroy Townships. The Property consists of 30 contiguous, unpatented claims comprising of 65 units 

and 1040 ha in the Larder Lake Mining Division. All claims are 100% owned by Northstar Gold Corp. In 

addition, the Company also holds two Freehold Patents L17916 and L17917 with both mining and surface 

rights in the northwest corner of Catharine township which are contiguous with the rest of the property. 

Each patent has an area of 15.83 ha for a total of 31.67 ha. Surface rights for the mining claims are owned 

by the crown, except for 11 SRO patents which are not owned by Northstar. In February 2015, a joint 

venture agreement (Agreement) was signed between Oban and Northstar which allows Oban to acquire 

up to 70% interest on the Miller Property from Northstar.   

The Miller Gold Property is located within the Archean volcano sedimentary assemblage of rocks of the 

Western Abitibi Subprovince in the Superior Province. Metavolcanic rocks in the property area of known 

age fall in the range of 2750 - 2700 Ma and are cut by a an Algoman Age granitic intrusions.  Most of 

these metavolcanics are the Catharine Assemblage of rocks which consist of mafic to intermediate 

volcanic rocks, subordinate pyroxene komatiite and minor felsic metavolcanic rocks. Numerous faults 

transect the predominately pillow, tholeiitic, mafic metavolcanic, supracrustal rocks. The most important 

are the north-west striking Pacaud fault and Catharine fault plus there are east-northeast striking 

secondary faults all of which displace the assemblage units. The gold on the property is known to be 

situated within both shallowly dipping and vertical quartz veins along with northwest trending porphyritic 

dikes and syenite stocks hosted within the mafic volcanic rocks.  Gold mineralization in the area 

commonly has a nuggety character and coarse texture occurring in native form or as tellurides, and may 

or may not be associated with disseminated pyrite.

Caracle Creek visited the Property, logged and monitored QA/QC for its diamond drill program, and 

reviewed its ground exploration work on the Property during the summer of 2014 on behalf of Northstar 

Gold Corp. ("Northstar"). The 2014 drill program was undertaken to follow-up on positive historic 

drilling and previous ground Induced Polarization (IP) survey results on the Property completed in early 

2014. 

The drilling was completed from June 4 - 27, 2014 comprised of fifteen NQ holes totaling 1,778.5 metres 

with the purpose of confirming and following up on significant Au intersections from historic drilling, 

and testing attractive ground IP chargeability and resistivity targets.  In addition, 563 surface samples 

have been obtained and analyzed during the summers of 2012 - 14.  

The most encouraging results from this drill program came from the drill testing of the 'Allied Syenite' in 

holes MG14-03, MG14-07, and MG14-09 to MG14-12 located in the northern central part of the property 

in northeastern Pacaud Township. 

The 2014 summer drilling program established that the Allied Syenite is part of a large-scale gold 

enriched intrusive system that hosts widespread stringers and historically mined veins both within the 

intrusive and the surrounding basaltic rocks on the Miller Property.  Determining a final size and gold 

grade for the mineralized alkaline intrusive hosted system will require a follow-up with a major drilling 

program. 

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Introduction 

Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. ("Caracle Creek") of Toronto, Ontario, Canada was 

contracted by Northstar Gold Crop. ("Northstar") of New Liskeard, Ontario, Canada to log the diamond 

drill core and compile, monitor, and review the diamond drilling results and ground exploration on the 

Miller Property (the "Property") during the summer of 2014.  This was followed by the contract by Oban 

Mining Corporation ("Oban") to conduct this review of the Property and to prepare an Independent 

Technical Report (the "Report"), compliant with National Instrument 43-101 ("NI43-101"), companion 

policy NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F1.  The drill program was managed and supervised by George 

Pollock, President and CEO of Northstar.

This report summarizes the historical information and the results of exploration to-date completed by 

Northstar with a focus on the diamond drilling undertaken on the Property from June 4 - 27 2014, and 

presents recommendations for future work based upon the results. The objectives of the drilling program 

were to: 

 To follow-up on positive drilling and mining results from previous exploration and development 

work on the property from the 1918 to 1987 including the twinning of historic drill holes.  

 To target and test prospective surface IP chargeability and resistivity anomalies from ground 

survey completed earlier in 2014. 

The Property has been visited by independent Caracle Creek geologists twice in the past year.  The first 

visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd and Elisabeth Ronacher, both "independent qualified persons" in 

accordance with National Instrument 43-101, from June 2 – 27, 2014 to log and sample the drill core, 

inspect the drill, conduct independent surface sampling at the Property and monitor the QA/QC during the 

drill program.  The second visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd on March 27, 2015 with the purpose of 

checking locations of claim posts using GPS focusing on the newly staked claims in January, 2015 and 

choosing independent site-visit drill core samples to be analyzed at a third laboratory. 

The sources of information for this Report include exploration and tenure data provided by Oban and 

Northstar, publically available data, information collected during the site visit and references cited in 

section 19.0.  

2.2 Terminology 

Fire assay: Fire assay is the method of choice for gold analysis. The procedure involves mixing an 

aliquot of the sample (e.g., 30 g or 50 g) with a flux agent (e.g., sodium borate, PbO) and a "collector" 

such as silver. The mixture is heated to ~1150 °C. The lead and silver settle to the bottom of the melt and 

the silver scavenges gold as it sinks. The lead and silver button is cupelled at 950 °C. The silver bead 

(which also contains gold) is dissolved and analyzed by atomic absorption or other techniques 

(http://actlabs.com).

4.3 Oban – Northstar Option to Acquire 70% Interest in Miller Property 

On February 22, 2015, a joint venture agreement (Agreement) was signed between Oban and Northstar 

which allows Oban to acquire up to 70% interest on the Property from Northstar.  Under the terms of the 

Agreement, the Company can earn up to a 51% interest in the Property by subscribing for $300,000 in 

common shares of Northstar at $0.10 per share, and making payments and incurring expenditures of $3 

million over three years. Oban can earn a further 9% interest by making payments and incurring 

expenditures equal to $2 million by the fifth anniversary, and a further 10% by the sixth anniversary for 

payments and expenditures equal to a further $3.3 million or, at the option of Oban, $2 million and a 

commitment to fund the Property through to completion of a pre-feasibility study. The QP has reviewed a 

copy of the Oban – Northstar agreement and is relying on Oban's legal counsel that the agreement is 

sound.  

Mineral claims 4275033 and 4241927 are not included in the current agreement between Oban and 

Northstar, but their addition to the agreement is in progress.  

4.4 Obligations 

In Ontario, to retain a mining claim, companies must submit an assessment file to the MNDM Geoscience 

Assessment Office showing that they have spent $400/per claim unit on exploration on each claim. One 

claim unit is equal to 16 hectares. A mining claim is issued for a term of 2 years. 

Property tax is required to be paid to Ontario Ministry of Finance on each patent. In 2014, the property 

tax for Northstar's L17917 (Parcel 322 SST) was $50.74 due June 27, 2014. The property tax for L17916 

(Parcel 323 SST) was also $50.74. The property taxes were paid and are in good standing.  

The Miller Property is subject to three royalities: 

1. Ashley Gold Mines Royalty: There is a 0.25% NSR with an option to buy out for $250,000 owed 

to Ashley Gold Mines on the Com Copper mine which represents 16 hectares (claim 4246848) in 

Pacaud Township. The remaining 15 mining claims representing 240 hectares (claim 4201240 

with 5 units, 4224525 with 1 unit, 4201239 with 5 units, 4217728 with 4 units) in Catherine 

township also carry a 2% NSR owed to Ashley Gold Mines with a 1% buy back for 1 million 

dollars and a right of first refusal on the remaining 1% NSR.

2. Franco-Nevada Corporation Royalty: There is a 3% NSR belonging to Franco-Nevada 

Corporation carried over in the deal on 32 hectare Campbell Property in the northeast corner of 

Catherine township (patents L17916 and L17917).  

3. Lake Shore Gold Royalty: There is a 2% NSR owed to Lake Shore Gold on the Shoebox Property 

(claim 4215970 with 6 units) representing 96 hectares with a 1% buy back for 1 million dollars 

and a right of first refusal on the remaining 1% NSR.  

Other than the agreement with Oban Mining (section 4.3) and the above royalities, there are no other 

agreements on the Miller Property.  

An Exploration Plan or Exploration Permit is required from the Ministry of Northern Development and 

Mines in order to be allowed to undertake exploration activities on mining claims, leases or licences of 

occupation are required to submit an Exploration Permit application 

(http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/en/mines-and-minerals/mining-act/mining-act-modernization/exploration-

plans). These exploration activities include ground geophysical surveys, mechanized drilling, surface 

stripping, line cutting and pitting and trenching.   Surface rights owners must be notified when applying 

for a permit.  Aboriginal communities potentially affected by the exploration permit activities will be 

consulted and have an opportunity to provide comments and feedback before a decision is made on the 

permit.   

Northstar had an exploration permit at the time of the 2014 drill program, but this permit has expired. 

Northstar has applied for another exploration permit which is in progress, to cover the claims for the 

proposed 2015 drill program.  

There are no environmental liabilities on the mineral claims as the environmental liability of mineral 

claims is the responsibility of the crown. In the future, if the mineral claims are converted to leases, then 

there are historic shafts on the property which should be capped. Currently, two historic shafts near the 

main road have been capped. Even though the Property is a brownfields site, there are no visible tailings 

on the surface. 

To the best of Caracle Creek's knowledge, there are no significant factors and risks that may affect access 

to title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The most convenient access to the Miller Property is from Kirkland Lake via Highway 66, then south on 

Highway 112, then turning east on local road 564 to Boston Creek, then further east along logging road 

for about 4 km to the property. Depending upon the weather the logging road may be at times only 4-

wheel drivable and have load restrictions on heavy vehicles. During the winter the road is ploughed only 

to Boston Creek.   

5.2 Climate and Vegetation 

The climate normals for 1971-2000 from Environment Canada for Kirkland Lake (closest weather station 

to the property) indicate that the daily average temperature ranges from -18ºC in January to 17ºC in July. 

The average monthly accumulation of rain is around 95 mm from June to September. The average 

monthly accumulation of snow is 65 cm from December to January.  

Drilling can be conducted year round except for spring thaw in mid-March to May. Geological mapping 

and outcrop sampling can be conducted May to November when there is no snow on the ground.  

5.3 Physiography 

The topography of the property consists of moderate to low relief with elevations ranging from 300 to 330 

metres above sea level.  Most of the property is wooded with a number of creeks and swampy areas 

throughout.   

5.4 Infrastructure and Local Resources 

The population of the nearest town, Kirkland Lake is 8,483 people (Statistics Canada, 

www.statcan.gc.ca).  Kirkland Lake is an economically vibrant mining town and a good source for labour, 

exploration supplies and general services.  The area is well serviced by highways, a railway line and 

hydro-electric power lines which extend to within four kilometres of the property at Boston Creek.

The Miller Property is in the exploration stage and does not yet have 43-101 compliant resource/reserve 

or a prefeasibility study; therefore, discussion on potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal 

areas, heap pad leach pad areas and potential processing tailings storage area for mining operations is not 

relevant. 

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Summary of Exploration History 

The work history on the property area is poorly documented but briefly outlined below. There is, 

however, a description of the early exploration and mining activity from the Nortek Exploration 1986-87 

program covering much of the property area which is available in French (1988).   

1918-20 Reported Miller – Independence Mine production of 58.5 ounces Au, 70 ounces Ag from 

31 ton bulk sample of recovery grade of 1.89 oz/ton Au.  French (1988) discusses the 

mine development activity and workings including continuing work on the mine into the 

1930s.   

1920s-39 Intermittent exploration of the historic Planet Gold claims since the 1920s located in 

Boston and McElroy townships north of the Miller-Independence mine workings 

(incorporated into the greater Miller Property) including the mining of a 16 ton bulk 

sample.  In 1938, a 3.35 ton portion of the bulk sample was milled by gravity methods on 

behalf of Howey Gold Mines and reported a grade of 0.0845 oz/ton gold (Seeber 1982). 

A company document from period suggested the Planet Gold claims hold 5 Mt of gold 

mineralized material of unknown grade hosted in a syenite intrusion (Massore Mining 

Syndicate Limited 1941), but this is reported for information only and is not to be relied 

upon.  The Qualified Person has not verified this information in this document. 

1961-63 Tagiamonte drilled three diamond drill holes testing quartz veins in area, no assays 

reported.

1987 Nortek Exploration - 37 diamond drill holes, a grade and tonnage for the Miller-

Independence deposit estimated at 808,000 tons at 0.335 oz/ton Au is reported in the 

document. This number is a historical estimate, not compliant to 43-101 guidelines, 

provided for information only and is not to be relied upon. The relevance of this historical 

estimate is as a rough guideline of possible resource on the Property. The key 

assumptions, parameters and methods to prepare this historical estimate are not known. 

The historical estimate does not use categories set out in sections 1.2 and 1.3 NI 43-101. 

A full assessment report is filed with MNDM by G.B. French (1988). This historical 

estimate can be updated to a current mineral resource by additional drilling. The 

Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current 

mineral resource and the issuer is not treating this historical estimate as a current mineral 

resource.

2009 John Mckenzie did some prospecting on the Perron claims (Shoebox Property) directly 

east of the Miller – Independence mine workings (incorporated into the greater Miller 

Property), and filed assessment report with MNDM (Mackenzie 2009). 

2012-14 Northstar stakes most of the present Miller Property including the original Pacaud claims 

area and completes line cutting, ground magnetic survey and surface prospecting, 

followed by ground IP - IPower 3D survey in 2014 over the cut line grid. Report prepared 

by T. Loader (2014). 

2015 Northstar stakes the adjacent Planet Property in January, 2015 and incorporates it into the 

joint venture agreement with Oban Mining Corporation.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The geological description of the property area and information on geological figures are drawn mostly 

from Jackson (1994) and French (1988).  The Miller Gold Property is located within the Archean volcano 

sedimentary assemblage of rocks of the Western Abitibi Subprovince in the Superior Province. 

Metavolcanic rocks in the property area of known age fall in the range of 2750 - 2700 Ma and are cut by a 

an Algoman Age granitic intrusions.  Most of these metavolcanics are the Catharine Assemblage of rocks 

which consist of mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks, subordinate pyroxene komatiite and minor felsic 

metavolcanicrocks (Figure 7-1). Intermittent small pyritic sulphide zones occur in the metavolcanic rocks. 

Early Proterozoic diabase dykes crosscut the Archean rocks.  Regional metamorphic grade is greenschist 

facies.

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

Numerous faults transect the predominately pillow, tholeiitic, mafic metavolcanic, supracrustal rocks 

(Figure 7-1). The most important are the north-west striking Pacaud fault and Catharine fault plus there 

are east-northeast striking secondary faults all of which displace the assemblage units. The largest 

intrusive body in the area is the tonalite dominated Round Lake Batholith located in the southwest part of 

Pacaud Township.  In general, cleavage and shear zones tend to parallel the batholith margin and in the 

property area strike northwest, steeply dipping, and facing northeast.  

In terms of economic geology, the gold on the property is known to be situated within both shallowly 

dipping and vertical quartz veins along with northwest trending porphyritic dikes and syenite stocks 

hosted within the mafic volcanic rocks.  Gold mineralization in the area commonly has a nuggety 

character and coarse texture occurring in native form or as tellurides, and may or may not be associated 

with disseminated pyrite.  Presently, the most economically interesting veins are located in the 

northeastern Pacaud Township, within in the centre of the property on claims 4267276 and 4267277 

(Figure 9-2).Historical interest has been on a series of east-west trending veins, the most predominant 

being the north shallowly dipping Vein #1 which was the focus of exploration and development activity 

reported in the Nortek 1986-87 work program (French 1988).  Other veins of historical interest include 

the steeply dipping D Vein which trends northeast to the immediate west of Vein #1. 

Alkaline intrusives named the Allied Syenite in Pacaud Township and Planet Syenite in Boston Township 

plus a number of northwest trending sinuous feldspar porphyry bodies are noted north of the Vein 1 and 

may have a genetic relationship to the gold mineralization (Figure 9-2).  The syenite in places may have a 

more granitic appearance and composition but this is believed to be a function of introduced quartz in the 

form of veins and silicification in the matrix.  The Allied Syenite is part of an arc of alkaline magmatism 

that extends for 3,000 metres to the north and may be connected to the Planet Syenite. 

Au-Bi-Te association was identified in drill hole MG-14-12, sample 14624 at 54.6 m (Figure 7-2). This 

sample was logged as a quartz vein with visible gold, tellurides and chalcopyrite. The quartz vein intrudes 

a syenite. Assay results show that this sample has 12.2 g/t Au by metallic screen, 1260 ppm Bi, 359 ppm 

Cu, 296 ppm Pb and 79.4 ppm Te.

The Property lies in the Kirkland Lake Mining District of northeast Ontario in which historically gold has 

been mined as typical Mesothermal, replacement type, high-grade, quartz veins found along or close to a 

major east-west trending Archean deformation/structural feature named the Kirkland Lake Main break 

within the Larder Lake - Cadillac Deformation Zone. Gold production since 1915 from seven gold mines 

has collectively produced more than 24 million ounces of gold. (Clark 2013).

More recently identified gold deposits in the camp such as the Upper Beaver deposit held by 

Agnico Eagle Mines Limited consists of disseminated to quartz filled fractures, stockworks, 

breccias, and pyritic zones associated with igneous intrusives commonly of syenite 

composition (Agnico Eagle Mines website: http://www.agnicoeagle.com/).  At the Macassa 

Mine presently operated by Kirkland Lake Gold Inc., higher grade shoots constitute about 

30% of the overall gold mineralized structures cutting the syenites.  The following

"CHARACTERISTICS OF GOLD MINERALIZATION HOSTED BY THE 

LARDER LAKE–CADILLAC DEFORMATION ZONE 

Gold mineralization at the Anoki and McBean properties is similar to the above-
described gold deposits of McVittie and McGarry townships. In particular, the 
replacement-style, pyrite-rich Anoki Main zone shares strong analogies with the 
Kerr Addison-Chesterville flow ore, and replacement ores of Cheminis and Omega 
mines. Gold-bearing quartz stockworks in carbonate-fuchsite schists explored at 
depth at the McBean deposit and within the Anoki Deep zone are similar to the 
"green carbonate" ore at Kerr Addison-Chesterville. Mineralized aphyric dikes of 
the McBean ore zone strongly resemble the albitite ore of the Kerr Addison Mine 
described by Smith et al. (1993). Mineralization of the Anoki South zone that is 
hosted by a graphitic exhalite horizon may correlate to the graphite ore of the Kerr 
Addison-Chesterville Mine. Similarities in mineralization styles as well as 
analogous structural setting within the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone 
suggest that gold-bearing zones of the Anoki and McBean properties are likely 
related to mineralization of Kerr Addison-Chesterville, Cheminis, and Omega 
mines. All these occurrences of gold mineralization are parts of a single regional 
hydrothermal system. The most characteristic features of this system are 
summarized below:  

1. Gold mineralization is localized within a first-order structure, that is, the Larder 
Lake–Cadillac deformation zone (Smith et al. 1993), and (as far as we are aware) 
there is no tendency for preferential occurrence of larger deposits in second- and 
third-order structures;  

2. Mineralization is commonly associated with gentle S-shaped bends along the Larder 
Lake–Cadillac deformation zone (Anoki, McBean, Omega, and Cheminis);  

3. On the scale of the host deformation zone, mineralization tends to form linear shoots 
(strike length<dip length) that plunge roughly parallel to the regional stretching 
lineation (L2): e.g., 40-50° east at McBean (this study); approximately 70º E at Kerr 
Addison-Chesterville (Smith et al. 1993, p. 30); near vertical at Cheminis 
(longitudinal section in Clark and Bonnar 1987; structural data in Wilkinson 1993, 
p.142).  

4. At least some mineralized zones are centered on relatively competent lava flow units 
(e.g., Omega, Cheminis, possibly Kerr Addison) that are flanked by rheologically 
weak and probably impermeable ultramafic talc-chlorite schists (e.g., Thomson 
1941; Smith et al. 1993).

5. There are two principal types of gold mineralization: a) the economically most 
important style is the pyritic replacement ore where gold is present largely as 
submicroscopic particles in pyrite (accounts for about 65% of gold at Kerr Addison-
Chesterville, most gold at Cheminis and Omega, and Anoki Main zone), and b) the 
second in importance are quartz stockworks and veins in carbonate-fuchsite-altered 
ultramafic rocks, where coarser gold is present principally in quartz. The two 
mineralization types coexist within individual deposits and are probably related to 
the same hydrothermal episode (e.g., Smith et al. 1993). Localization and shape of 
individual replacement ore bodies is typically defined by primary or structurally 
modified geometry of geochemically and rheologically favourable units (Smith et al. 
1993; present study of the Anoki Main zone). Volcanic rocks of the Larder Lake 
Group constitute the most common protolith for replacement ores. Volcanic 
protoliths of the Anoki Main zone and Kerr Addison-Chesterville flow ore (Warwick 
1981; Kishida and Kerrich 1987) are Fe-tholeiites. Carbonate is the major 
component in both mineralization types, which indicates that ore was generated by 
carbonic, CO2 – rich fluids (e.g., Kishida and Kerrich 1987). Sulphidation of the 
Fe-rich, high Fe/Mg tholeiitic rocks must have constituted the main gold deposition 
mechanism for pyritic replacement mineralization (Böhlke 1988; Phillips et al. 
1984; Smith et al. 1993), whereas relatively coarse gold in quartz veins enclosed in 
carbonate-fuchsite alteration was most likely deposited through phase separations 
(e.g., Smith et al. 1993). The latter mechanism agrees well with the rather irregular 
distribution of gold in "green carbonate ore" (Smith et al. 1993) and occurrence of 
gold-barren quartz stockworks in carbonate-fuchsite schists. Both types of 
mineralization most probably belong to the syn-deformation greenstone-hosted 
quartz-carbonate vein (mesothermal-orogenic) deposit class.  

6. Syn-mineralization hydrothermal alteration likely increased competency of host 
rocks; ultramafic talc-chlorite schists were modified into carbonate-fuchsite rocks 
with abundant quartz veining, the largely chloritic flow unit of the Anoki zone was 
replaced by albite-rich aggregate. In both cases, hydrothermal products are more 
rigid than the protolith, and are likely to respond more brittley to continuing 
deformation and maintain or even enhance permeability.  

Occurrence of mesothermal gold mineralization in the first order deformation zone 
is unusual. Within the most economically significant gold camps, the largest gold 
deposits are typically found in subsidiary second- and third-order structures (e.g., 
Eisenlohr et al. 1989; Robert 1990; McCuaig and Kerrich 1998). This atypical 
localization pattern may be due to the nature of the Larder Lake–Cadillac 
deformation zone in the Larder Lake area. Lithological assemblage of the Larder 
Lake–Cadillac deformation zone includes competent mafic volcanic units 
intermingled with or enveloped by incompetent and impermeable ultramafic talc-
chlorite schists (Thomson 1941). This combination probably constituted favourable 
ground for maintaining isolated discrete permeable fluid conduits within the 
deformation zone. Competent tholeiitic volcanic units responded more brittley, thus 
enhancing their overall permeability. Rheologically weak talc-chlorite schists 
enveloped these permeable zones, preventing fluid dispersal and maintaining high 
fluid/rock ratios within fluid pathways. Some of these competent units were also

geochemically favourable for sulphidation (e.g., Fe-tholeitic, high Fe/Mg rocks), 
and gold deposition occurred.  

The location of gold deposits in the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone may (at 
least in part) reflect biases in exploration strategies, that is, the "Larder Lake 
Break" has for almost 100 years attracted the most attention from geologists and 
prospectors alike, and potentially gold-bearing subsidiary structures may have been 
overlooked. There is no geological factor precluding the occurrence of gold 
mineralization along subsidiary faults or shear zones that were hydraulically 
connected to the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone during a regional 
hydrothermal mineralizing event. The presence of Fe-tholeiites in the Kinojevis 
assemblage and Larder Lake Group (north and south of the Larder Lake– Cadillac 
deformation zone) supports the possibility for formation of replacement-style gold 
mineralization along subsidiary splays of the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation 
zone."   

 

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Locating Historic Drill Holes 

The locations of historical diamond drill holes from previous work are shown in Table 9-1 distributed 

throughout the property on claims 4267277, 4267276, 4215970 and on the adjacent patented land Lot 12 

Con 6 in Catharine Township south of 4215970 and east of 4267277.   The holes highlighted in yellow 

possess collars that have been located on the ground and surveyed by handheld GPS while the remainder 

are estimated from historical property maps and reports of work, predominantly French (1988), and their 

locations have not been verified in the field.  All of the ground located collars were re-found in May, 

2014 on claim 4267276 except for DDH 204 on claim 4267277.

9.2 Mapping and Sampling 

Since the acquisition of the property in 2012, a series of a prospecting and sampling programs have been 

undertaken by Northstar in order to confirm and define the extent of gold mineralization in trenches, 

exposed adit openings and scattered outcrop exposures. A total of 137 grab, composite grab, and single 

chip samples were obtained by George Pollock and geological technician Marc Cardinal during the 

summer of 2012, 327 grab, composite grab and single chip samples during the summer of 2013, and 169 

grab and chip samples during the summer of 2014.  Analytical results were highly variable and biased by 

the high grade grab samples as summarized in Table 9-2.  Most of the samples were collected from claims 

4267276 and 4267277 covering the area of the majority of historic workings in Northeat Pacaud 

Township on the Property.

It is noted these results are from prospecting surface samples collected over a non-systematic, highly 

variable spacing throughout the property and thus should not be treated in a "material" representative 

fashion with respect to the overall grade of the mineralized zone on the surface.  They are presented and 

discussed here in a limited fashion for information only for that reason.  

In general, higher grade surface samples were reported to be commonly associated with significant visible 

gold and telluride mineralization associated with quartz veins cutting meta-volcanic and intrusive rocks.   

In the area where Vein #1 is projected to trend to the surface south of hole MG14-15 and in the vicinity of 

the Miller-Independence historic workings, sampling of exposed quartz veins has reported high grade Au 

assays.  The quartz veins were found to contain lesser sulphides and tellurides in comparison to those

observed in the drill core, but host multiple occurrences of visible coarse gold associated with black 

tourmaline.  George Pollock (personal communication) of Northstar notes: 

"The highest grade surface samples are clustered around the Vein 1, D vein 

exposures and the contact zone around the Allied Syenite, particularly in vertical 

E-W trending veins near the eastern syenite contact." 

 

9.3 Geophysics 

During 2013, an approximately 11 km ground magnetic survey was completed on a 50 metres spaced 

north-south cut grid covering the central portion of the Miller property over claims 4267276, 4267277, 

southeastern part of 4267275 and western part of 4215970 in northeastern Pacaud Township and 

northwestern Catharine Township. The dominant features identified from the magnetic survey are the 

main northwest trending lineament defining the Catharine Fault trending through northwestern Catharine 

Township as well as the general northwestern trend of the geological terrain.   

During the winter of 2014, Abitibi Geophysics completed an 11.3km ground time domain 3D IP (IPower 

3D on five simultaneous lines) chargeability and resistivity survey on the grid.  The data values were 

inverted using computer software calculating three dimensional patterns of resistivity and chargeability of 

the subsurface that best explain the values recorded at surface. The depth and quality of the survey results 

are variable and limited by the character of the bedrock, however, plans at 50, 75, and 100 metres depths 

were provided by the geophysical contractor as shown in Figure 9-1.

"The #1 quartz vein (Vein #1) correlates well with a resistive layer immediately 
overlying a highly conductive layer that was detected by the IPower3D® survey. 
The survey results indicate that this zone extends significantly further than the area 
known from (historic) drilling".  

"The results of the chargeability inversion have also shown that the chargeable 
mineralization forms bands the stretch across the grid, branching and forking.

the grid. This appears to be well defined as a high resistivity zone and includes 
some significant chargeable character.  The resistivity anomaly reaches its

The Abitibi Geophysics report recommended diamond drilling for 11 distinctive chargeable anomalies, 

seven of which are associated with the Vein #1 zone. The drill targets chosen in the 2014 program were 

consistent with these recommendations. The results of this geophysical survey are presented and 

discussed in their logistics and interpretation report listed in the references.   

9.4 Drilling 

Northstar Gold conducted its diamond drilling in this program in order to:   

 Validate the results of the historical drilling focusing on following up predominately on 

the results of the 1986-87 Nortek work program on the property and;    

 Test drill targets within chargeability and resistivity anomalies generated from the ground

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1  Drilling Data and Progress 

The 2014 Northstar Gold diamond drill holes are located on claims 4267277, 4267276, and 4215970 

listed in Table 4-1.  The exploration work described in this report is Northstar Gold's initial (Phase 1) 

diamond drilling program, consisting of fifteen (MG14-01 to 15) NQ holes totalling 1,778.5 metres.  All 

the holes were drilled vertically with the exception of holes MG14-04, 06 and 12.  The drill holes and 

their specifications are listed in Table 10-1. 

Forage Asinii of Notre-Dame du Nord was the diamond drilling contractor and the program was 

supervised in the field by George Pollock while geologists Trevor Boyd and Elizabeth Ronacher from 

Caracle Creek logged the core and monitored QA/QC for the program.  A Reflex down-hole survey was 

performed at approximately 50 m intervals. The drill casing was kept in the holes. GPS coordinates of all 

collar locations were recorded and at the end of the drill program all of the holes were surveyed using 

Trimble DGPS.  The overburden depths were between 2 - 5 m. The samples were gathered as NQ core 

with recoveries of over 95 per cent.The core was logged and stored at Northstar's secure warehouse at 

Earlton, Ontario.

As well as collars listed in Table 9-1 and Table 10-1, a detailed geological plan is given in Figure 9-2 

shows both the Northstar Gold and historical drill holes in the area of predominant economic interest on 

the property.  Specifically, during the 2014 program the drilling was clustered in two areas on the map 

based upon; the area of main Vein #1 zone(s) on claims 4267276 and 4267277 in northeastern Pacaud 

Township which has been the historical focus for exploration and development on the property and; the 

area of the Allied Syenite immediately to the north on claim 4367276.  In addition, three exploration 

holes were drilled to the east of the Allied Syenite on claim 4515970 in northwestern Catharine Township 

which originally was part of the historically named "Perron" claims.  

During the drill program, a total of 1,111 core samples were obtained from the drilling most of which 

were one metre in length but ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 metres. All of the samples were analyzed for at 

least gold of which 51 were also analyzed for multi-elements. The analyzed samples covered 

approximately 61% of the core obtained from drilling.  All the assays highlights listed in Table 10-2.  

Mineralized Intervals reported are core lengths and true widths at this stage can't be confidently 

ascertained. 

10.2  Drilling Results 

The program was successful in confirming the trend of the shallowly dipping Vein #1 Zone in holes 

MG14-02, 3, 7, 9, 12 and 13.  In addition, a bulk tonnage, near surface gold target was discovered within 

the Allied Syenite with 6 drill holes (MG14-03, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12) intersecting gold zone(s) between 20m 

and 120m vertical depth within the intrusive body. Drill hole spacing in the vicinity of the Allied Syenite 

was between 30 -50m for the six holes. 

Best results of the drilling came from holes MG14-07, 09 and 12.Specific features of interest for each 

drill hole are detailed as follows: 

MG14-01 

Hole MG14-01 was collared within ten metres adjacent to historic hole 86-6 drilled vertically in order to 

test for high grade Vein 1 zone mineralization at approximately 115 metres depth.  It intersected 

alternating units of steeply dipping altered mafic volcanic and feldspar quartz porphyry rocks.  Best 

results were a pyritic quartz vein grading 3.3 g/t Au at 3.00 - 3.30 metres over 0.3 metres and pervasively 

silicified and pyritic rock grading 1.56 g/t Au at 58.15 – 58.65 metres over 0.50 metres down hole.

MG14-02 

Hole MG14-02 was collared within two metres of historic hole 204 drilled vertically in order to test for 

high grade Vein 1 zone mineralization at approximately 55 metres depth.  It intersected mostly altered 

mafic volcanic rocks hosting the pyritic Vein 1 zone with a high grade assay of 86.6 g/t Au at 49.7 – 

50.15 metres over 0.45 metres down hole. Visible tellurides were reported in the core. 

MG14-03 

Hole MG14-03 was collared 20 metres north of historic hole 87-15 drilled vertically to test for high grade 

Vein 1 zone mineralization at approximately 95 metres depth.  It intersected predominantly quartz veined, 

pyritic, altered syenite grading 0.58 g/t Au at 41.7 – 111.3 metres over 69.6 metres down hole. Distinctive 

black chlorite grains and jasper veining were observed in the zone in association with the strong 

silicification and hematization.  In addition, visible gold and tellurides were reported in the hole.  

MG14-04 

Hole MG14-04 was collared approximately 80 metres east of MG14-03 and east of the Allied Syenite 

drilled at 75º angle to the northeast test its extent in that direction. It intersected steeply dipping mafic 

volcanic rocks with no significant assay results or mineralization noted in the core.  

MG14-05 

Hole MG14-05 was collared approximately 150 metres northeast of MG14-05 drilled vertically as an 

exploration hole for shallowly dipping quartz vein hosted mineralization.  It intersected steeply dipping 

mafic volcanic rocks with no significant assay results or mineralization noted in the core.  

MG14-06 

Hole MG14-06 was collared approximately 150 metres northeast of MG14-02 and drilled at 55 degree 

angle to the north to test for both flat and steeply dipping east-west trending quartz veining east of Vein 1 

and the Allied Syenite.  It intersected predominantly steeply dipping mafic volcanic rocks and a zone of 

silicified, sulphidic, pervasively altered rock grading 0.94 g/t Au from 171.6 - 177.7 metres over 6.1 

metres down hole. Historic vertical veins in the vicinity, named Vein 2 here, report grades of 19.88 g/t Au 

over 4.1 metres.

MG14-07 

Hole MG14-07was collared approximately 50 metres north of MG14-03 and drilled vertically to test the 

Allied Syenite in that direction. It intersected predominantly quartz and jasper veined, pyritic, silicified 

and hematized syenite interspersed with short sections of mafic volcanic and feldspar quartz rocks 

grading 1.04 g/t Au from 22 – 119.5 metres over 97.5 metres down hole. Samples from the projected 

depth of the Vein 1 zone reported higher grade results of 3.55 g/t Au from 105.47 to 119.5 metres over 

14.03 metres down hole.  Nuggety visible gold and tellurides were reported in the core. 

MG14-08 

Hole MG14-08 was collared approximately 50 metres north of MG14-07 and drilled vertically to test the 

extent of the Allied Syenite in that direction.  It intersected predominantly mafic volcanic rocks with best 

assay of 1.11 g/t Au from 10.0 – 11.0 metres down hole.   

MG14-09 

Hole MG14-09 was collared approximately 40m to the west of MG14-03and drilled vertically to test the 

extent of the Allied Syenite in that direction.  It intersected predominantly syenite cut by numerous 

narrow mostly flat quartz veins but with significantly less silicification and chloritization in comparison 

to that found in holes MG14-03 and 07.  However despite the less alteration, occurrences of visible coarse 

nuggety gold and tellurides hosted directly in the syenite were noted in the drill core associated with 

grains of black chlorite particularly after being sawed for sampling as shown in Figure 10-1.   

The mineralized zone in the hole was outlined grading 0.89 g/t from 44 – 107 metres over 63 metres 

down hole. Samples from the projected depth of the Vein 1 zone reported higher grade results of 1.99 g/t 

Au from 88.95 to 107.0 metres over 18.05 metres down hole.

MG14-11 

Hole MG14-11 was collared approximately 40 metres northwest of hole MG14-10 and drilled vertically 

in what appears to be the centre of the Allied Syenite body.  The vertical hole intersected quartz veined, 

pyritic and altered syenite similar to that found in hole MG14-07 and the mineralized zone returned 

assays grading 0.72 g/t Au at 43.5 – 95 metres over 51.5 metres down hole.  

MG14-12 

Drill hole MG14-12 was collared approximately 20 metres east of hole MG14-03 drilled at 60 degrees 

towards the north.  The hole crossed the eastern side of the Allied Syente east of holes MG14-03 and 07 

and intersected silicified and hematized, quartz and jasper veined, pyritic syenite and mafic volcanic and 

feldspar quartz porphyry rocks.  Tellurides and nuggety visible gold were reported in all three rock units, 

and the mineralized zone returned assays grading 0.99 g/t Au at 54 – 156 metres over 102 metres down 

hole encompassing all the units. Samples from the believed Vein 1 zone reported high grade results of 

11.62 g/t Au from 138.05 to 142.0 metres over 3.95 metres down hole.    

MG14-13 

Hole MG14-13 was collared approximately 120 metres south of hole MG14-01 drilled vertically to test 

for Vein 1 zone mineralization. It intersected a zone of flat quartz veining hosted within mafic volcanic 

rocks grading 1.90 g/t Au from 21.9 – 24 metres over 2.1 metres down hole.  

MG14-14 

Hole MG14-14 was collared approximately 80 metres south of hole MG14-13 drilled vertically to define 

at depth a shallow, north dipping, quartz veined surface showing which had returned an average grade of  

10.7 g/t Au over an area 2 metres wide and 25 metres along the strike of the veining located 80 metres to 

the SW.  Tellurides and visible gold had been noted at the surface showing. An intersection of quartz 

veining was encountered in the hole containing tellurides and possible visible gold grading 8.34 g/t Au 

from 3.0 – 4.0 metres depth likely from the Vein 1 zone.

In summary, gold mineralization in the Vein #1 zone is characterized by widely distributed coarse native 

gold and gold tellurides hosted by quartz veins, disseminated pyrite, intense chlorite alteration and rare 

chalcopyrite stringers. Fine gold is associated with heavy disseminated pyrite mineralization.  

Diamond drilling confirmed the presence of Vein #1 hosting potentially economic grades of gold 

mineralization in the area of the Miller–Independence historic mine workings at shallow depths. The 

program also showed Vein #1 dips shallowly to the north towards the Allied Syenite where the vein 

system may widen and become incorporated into the Allied Syenite as multiple sub-horizontal narrow 

veins in a fingering manner suggestive of a genetic relationship in the gold mineralization.    

Gold is very widely distributed throughout Allied Syenite from 20 to 120 metres vertical depth with the 

majority of samples showing anomalous results.  Gold mineralization in the intrusive is commonly 

associated with intense silicification, hematization, pyritization, black chlorite, and quartz and jasper 

veining of the syenite but is also found in spatially associated mafic volcanicand feldspar porphyry rocks, 

and within parts of the syenite exhibiting apparent lesser alteration such as within hole MG14-09.  Within 

these less altered host rocks the gold mineralization, however, still appears to be associated with 

distinctive speckled grains of black chlorite of likely iron rich composition and secondary origin.Based 

upon whole rock analyses of core samples obtained from hole MH14-09 during this program, the 

intrusive is classified as a sodicsyenite or albitite. 

At this early stage of exploration, the orientation of the mineralized zone is not well defined and sample 

lengths do not reflect the true lengths or widths of the mineralized zone. 

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sample Security 

The drill core was placed in wooden core trays at the drill site, labelled with the hole ID and box number 

and transported to the core logging facility in Earlton, Ontario. At the core logging facility, the core boxes 

were labelled with aluminum tag indicating the hole number and the core interval stored in each box.  The 

core is stored in core racks inside the core logging facility or staked in its yard. The core storage facility is 

locked and the property is fenced with a locked gate.

11.2 Sample Preparation 

During this program, Northstar Gold implemented an industry standard QA/QC program under the 

supervision of Trevor Boyd and Elisabeth Ronacher of Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. that 

includes insertion of blanks, blind commercial standards and duplicate quarter core samples in order to 

ensure best practice in sampling and analysis. During the logging the NQ drill core was laid out on racks 

at Northstar's Earlton warehouse facility with the technician Marc Cardinal measuring recoveries and 

RQD and taking photographs while the geologist described the core. The geologist then assessed the 

intervals of mineralization for sampling and placed sample tags accordingly. The core was then ready for 

cutting.  Core recoveries were over 95 per cent.  

The selected drill core samples ranged from 0.25 to 2.0 metres in length, but mostly were one metre. The 

samples were prepared from core cut in half using a diamond saw, sealed in secure packages with a 

sample tag, and shipped by either company personnel or bonded carrier to either the Swastika 

Laboratories facility in Kirkland Lake, Ontario or the Activation Laboratories accredited facility 

(ISO/IEC 17025:2005) in Ancaster, Ontario for preparation and analysis. One tag was left remaining in 

the core box stapled at the beginning of each sample interval for future reference. 

Once the samples arrived in the laboratory, as a routine practice with rock and core at both facilities, the 

entire sample was crushed up to 90% passing 2 mm, mechanically split (250gms) and then pulverized to 

95% passing 150 mesh (105 microns).The prepared sample pulps were analyzed by fire assay for gold on 

a 30 gram split with either AAS or ICP Finish, and in some cases by either 45 multi-element analysis with 

Aqua Regia Digest and ICP-OAS and ICP-MS method finishes or by 35 elements using Instrumental 

Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) at Activation Laboratories.  Samples at both laboratories reporting 

greater than 3 g/t gold were check assayed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish.    

Selected samples were analyzed using the metallic screen technique by Activation Laboratories. The 

metallic screen procedure involves the collection of a 500g or 1000g split, which is taken and sieved at 

100 mesh; the entire +100 mesh fraction is fired and two 30g samples collected from the -100 mesh are 

fired in duplicate. Both Swastika Laboratories and Activation Laboratories fulfill standard quality 

assurance/quality control protocols. 

In greater detail, the following is a discussion of how the sample preparation and analytical procedures 

changed during the program.Initially, during the program 355 drill core samples were sent to Swastika

Laboratories for gold analysis by fire assay.  Based upon the discovery of telluride minerals in the core it 

was believed that the assays were significantly under-reporting the amount of gold in the core.  Selected 

sample rejects and pulps were sent to Activation Laboratories for check analyses by fire assay with ICP 

finish, INAA, and fire assay metallic screen analysis. It was discovered during the sample preparation at 

the Activation Laboratories facility that the Swastika preparation of its samples was inadequate, allowing 

only approximately 50% of sample through 2 mm, much lower than the minimum acceptable level of 

80%.  The result was the reporting of significantly less representative and more erratic gold from the 

Swastika facility which was supported by the results from selected samples being analyzed using metallic 

screen methodology at the Activations Laboratories facility, although this was not a consistent pattern.  

INAA successfully detected all the gold in sample aliquot but the reporting of meaningful results was 

hampered by a failed internal standard and its small sample aliquot size (<25 gm) per analysis in samples 

commonly weighing 3-4 kg in size and possessing a heterogeneous distribution of gold and telluride 

grains. 

Based upon these findings, the remaining 756 core samples were analyzed by fire assay with ICP finish at 

Activation Laboratories.  In summary, 84 and 24 samples also underwent metallic screen and INAA 

analyses, respectively.  Generally, the metallic screen analytical results were considered more credible 

than standard fire assay methods because it analysed more the sample material, and in cases of samples 

undergoing multiple analyses, they were chosen as the accepted value despite, in many cases, the results 

being lower than those obtained from the standard fire assay techniques. 

In the author's opinion, the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures follow industry 

standards and are suitable for the purpose of identifying mineralization in drill core.  

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1  Caracle Creek Site Visits 

The Property has been visited by independent Caracle Creek geologists twice in the past year.  The first 

visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd and Elisabeth Ronacher, both "independent qualified persons" in 

accordance with National Instrument 43-101, from June 2 – 27, 2014 to log and sample the drill core, 

inspect the drill, conduct independent surface sampling at the Property and monitor the QA/QC during the 

drill program.  The second visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd on March 27, 2015 with the purpose of

checking locations of claim posts using GPS focusing on the newly staked claims in January, 2015 and 

choosing independent drill core samples to be analyzed at a third laboratory. 

During the period of the first site visit, Trevor Boyd, collected a series of check samples from two main 

re-discovered surface exposures of visible gold mineralization overlying the area of where Vein #1 is 

projected to trend towards the surface in the vicinity of drill holes MG14-14 and 15.  The first area (Area 

1) was covered by six composite grab samples consisting of mixed quartz vein and wall rock material 

over an exposed mineralized zone approximately 2 metres wide and 25 metres long cut-off along strike by 

swamp and overburden.  The six samples totalling 51.5 kg returned a weight averaged grade of 10.7 g/t 

Au.   The second area (Area 2) of mixed quartz veins and wallrock was covered by five composite grab 

samples totalling 40 kg over an approximate 20 by 2 metre mineralized exposure adjacent to a historic 

adit portal and returned a weight averaged grade of 4.2 g/t Au.  The results are tabulated in Table 12-1.

During the second site visit, access to the Property was made by 4-wheel truck and snow-tracked ATV 

whereupon property claim posts were located by GPS cords and photographed as shown in Figure 12-1. 

An attempt was made to reach bedrock but due to the thickness of the snow cover at this time of the year 

this was not successful.

A total of 38 crushed marble blank were sent to Actlabs with drill core from MG-14-09 to 13. Actlabs 

analyzed the samples for Au using fire assay with an AA finish. Only one analyses of the marble blank 

failed (sample 14430, MG-14-11) for a failure rate of 2.6%.

12.2.2 Standards 

A total of five different gold standards were used during the drill program because due to the considerable 

sampling of the core, the two main standards, Oreas 204 and Oreas 19a, were used up.The certified values 

of all these standards are summarized in Table 12-3.   

A total of 8 analyses of low grade standard Oreas 204 with a certified value of 1.043 g/t Au were inserted 

into the sample stream with drill holes MG-14-01, 02, 03, 05 and 06 and submitted to Swastika. All of the 

standards passed.

A total of 41 core duplicates from drill holes MG-14-07 to 15 were analyzed by fire assay by Actlabs. A 

total of 8 of the 41 core duplicates failed for a failure rate of 19.5% (Figure 12-13). This is a high failure 

rate, but note the failed duplicates had one sample with > 0.2 g/t Au. The core duplicates that passed had 

one or both samples with < 0.2 g/t Au. It appears that the high failure rate for core duplicates is more 

likely due to the nugget effect at higher grades than an issue with the analytical method.

Six core duplicate pairs from drill holes MG-14-03, 09, 11 and 12 were analyzed for Au by Actlabs by 

metallic screen. The total Au value was plotted for the primary vs. secondary samples and most of the 

samples do not plot along the ideal 1:1 regression line. For three samples, the difference between the 

primary and secondary samples is significant due to the heterogeneous distribution of Au in the drill core.  

 

Figure 12-13 Control chart for core duplicates analyzed for Au by Actlabs by metallic screen. 

A plot of the fine fraction vs. the coarse fraction of the same core duplicate samples analyzed by Actlabs 

by metallic screen show that for the low grade samples the fine and coarse fraction give a similar result, 

but for high grade samples > 3 g/t Au the coarse fraction is significantly higher grade than the fine 

fraction. This is further evidence of the gold nugget effect in the drill core. For example, sample 14624 

from MG-14-12 from 54.0 to 55.0 m has an average of 7.135 g/t Au in the fine fraction and 231 g/t Au in 

the coarse fraction for a total gold value of 12.2 g/t. Sample 14143 from MG-14-09 from 101.0 to 102.0 

m has an average of 14.35 g/t Au in the fine fraction and 214 g/t Au in the coarse fraction for a total gold 

value of 24.9 g/t Au. Sample 14443 from MG-14-11 from 43.5 to 44.50 m has an average of 10.155 g/t

12.2.4 Summary 

The author's opinion is that the quality control review of the results the analyses of the standards, blanks 

and core duplicates that the results from the 2014 drill program are of good quality and adequate for the 

purpose of identifying mineralization at depth in drill core.  Core duplicates indicate that the coarse-grain 

size of the gold in both its native and telluride forms results a strong nugget effect for the assays.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Gravity Recoverable Gold Testing 

To confirm historic and current high grade results from the area, an approximately 15 tonne bulk sample 

from two main exposures (Areas 1 and 2 in Section 12.1) was collected in late 2013 for processing.  The 

sample material is presently stored at Northstar's secured warehouse facility to be processed at a local 

mill pending permission from the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines once the 

Property is taken to mining lease.   

A 30 kg sample obtained from Area 2 with quartz veining hosting visible gold was submitted by 

Northstar for gravity recoverable gold (GRG) bench testing in September 2013 at the Activation 

Laboratories Ltd. Metallurgy Department using a Knelson Concentrator in a gold recovery circuit (Steyn 

2013).  The sample graded 51.1 g/t Au with a 94.2% gold recovery using gravity concentration and the 

final tails from the test had 2.93 g/t of gold remaining.  

Two gold recovery tests were also conducted by SMC (Canada) Ltd. with inconclusive results. 

13.2 Mineralogical Testing 

Two drill core samples from MG-14-09 were submitted to Actlabs for modal mineralogy late in 2014: 

 Sample 14143 from 101.0 to 102.0 m with 24.9 g/t Au determined by metallic screen 

 Sample 14149 from 106.0 to 107.0 m with 10.7 g/t Au determined by metallic screen 

Both samples were logged as being syenite with intense chlorite alteration with disseminated pyrite. 

One polished section from each sample was prepared for analysis with carbon coating (Bindi, 2014).The 

polished sections were analyzed for modal mineralogy on a Quanta 600F scanning electron microscope 

(SEM). By a combination of  image analysis employing  atomic number contrast imaging (from back-

scattered electron – or BSE- signal intensity) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) using  Bruker 

5010 SDD detectors, minerals and other attributes are directly measured on the MLA.  BSE signal 

intensity is proportional to the mean atomic number of minerals. The Field Emission Gun was used at an 

accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a spot size of 5 and a working distance of 12.5 mm.

The modal mineralogy of the entire samples confirmed the logged lithology of syenite (high albite, low 

quartz and K-feldspar content) and the presence of strong chlorite alteration and disseminated pyrite 

(Table 13-1).  

Four gold grains were identified in sample 14149 which were both liberated and locked, ranging in size 

from 5-75 μm and associated with tsumoite (BiTe). The gold grains were Au-Ag alloys of variable 

composition.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Property is surrounded by mineral claims belonging to Orefinders Resources Inc. bounding on its 

north side in Boston and McElroy townships, Barry-Hollinger Gold Mines Ltd. to the immediate 

northwest in Boston Township, and Les Entreprises Ogima Inc. bounding on the south side in Pacaud and 

Catherine townships. The Barry-Hollinger Gold Mines claims with patent land holdings cover the closed 

Barry Hollinger Mine which has reported a production of 77,000 ounces of gold from 267,741 tons 

intermittently from 1918 to 1946 (website: kirklandlakeplaque.ca/).   

In general, patent land holdings are scattered throughout the area, the most significant being the 160 acre 

Searles Patented holding in Lot 12, Con 6 of Catherine Township bounding to the immediate southeast of 

the main Property workings.  This holding is included in the discussion of the 1987 Miller-Independence 

exploration work report (French 1988). 

The Qualified Person has been unable to verify this information and the information on adjacent 

properties is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property that is subject of this Report.  

16.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

No additional information or explanation is necessary to make this technical report more understandable. 

17.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The diamond drilling results for the historically known Vein #1 zone in holes MG14-02, MG14-03, 

MG14-07, MG14-09 and MG14-12 suggest this mineralized zone extends to the north, incorporates into 

the Allied Syenite, and then remains open continuing further along plunge to the north.  Further to the 

south this vein system trends up dip to shallow depths and appears in places to become exposed on the 

surface about 30 and 60 metres south of hole MG14-15, but the auriferous veining here is scattered and 

difficult to delineate.  This may be because of the tree cover and paucity of detailed surface exploration 

and sampling on the property for the past 80 years.

North of hole MG14-01, the demonstration of the relationship of the gold mineralization between Vein #1 

and the Allied Syenite, and the knowledge that the intrusive is part of a continuous arc of alkaline 

magmatism that extends for 3,000 metres to the north suggests that the gold potential for the property is 

more extensive and economically attractive than historically believed.   

In general, the exploration of the Miller Property has been conducted in accordance with 43-101 protocols 

with no material errors in procedures or significant deficiencies in the integrity of the results. The results 

from the 2014 drill program are of good quality and adequate for the purpose of their utilization in any 

subsequent resource estimations.  It is cautioned that the gold distribution in the mineralized zones is 

highly variable due to its nuggety character and often coarse texture.  It is the opinion of the authors of 

this report that the work completed to-date by Northstar has returned sufficient positive results to justify 

an enlarged follow-up exploration program consisting mostly of diamond drilling with the purpose of 

defining a 43-101 compliant geological resource.  

18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based upon these results, the following recommendations for further work on the Miller Property are 

proposed: 

 

 It is recommended that a focused 5,000 metre program of vertical definition diamond drilling of 

the Allied Syenite and associated Vein #1 be completed with the purpose of defining the overall 

size of the gold resource.  The program would cover the area especially to the north, west and 

south of holes MG14-03, MG14-07 and MG14-09 where the mineralized system appears to be 

laterally open.  Follow-up drilling is also needed among the area of holes MG14-02, MG14-03 

and historical hole N87-6, and west from the vicinity of hole MG14-06 towards Vein 1 and the 

Allied Syenite.   

 

 Ground IP chargeability and resistivity surveying followed by approximately 2,000 metres of 

reconnaissance drilling in the vicinity of the Planet Syenite is also recommended as a top priority 

in order to test and follow up on historically reported gold mineralized bodies and to define 

additional intrusive hosted mineralized zones.

WWW.CARACLECREEK.COM 

 Systematic stripping, shallow drilling, surface chip sampling and bulk sampling is needed south 

of drill hole MG14-01.  Specifically, a program of vertical definition drilling, consisting of 

approximately 1,000 metres made up of short holes (<50 metres depth) is recommended 

southwest of drill hole MG14-02 and north of the believed surface exposures (Areas 1 and 2 in 

Section 12.1) of Vein #1 (south of the B shaft), focusing on the vicinity of holes MG14-13, 14 

and 15.  The goal would be to define a shallow potentially open pit gold resource additive to the 

main intrusive hosted mineralized body to the north. 

 

 Due to the coarse nuggety nature of the gold mineralization, attention should be paid to ensuring 

the accuracy of the analytical results particularly in the sample preparation by crushing samples 

to at least 90% passing 2mm, split to 250 gm and pulverize to 85% passing 75um.  There is some 

question as to the optimum size of analysis (30 vs. 50 gm aliquots) with respect to gold losses 

and sample representation which should be discussed with the laboratory conducting the analyses 

prior to program commencement.  

 

 It is recommended that during the next drill program specific gravity measurements be 

completed on every tenth sample chosen for analysis. 

 

 It is recommended that sample weights be recorded on assay certificates for all samples sent in 

for analysis.

Recommendations for follow-up exploration and development depend upon the results of this program 

but would likely predominantly entail additional definition drilling.   

Eventually, selected central drilling area claims on the Property should be applied and taken to Mining 

Lease.  This will require that a legal perimeter boundary survey be completed, required by the Ministry of 

Northern Development and Mines in order to facilitate the processing of the 15 tonne bulk sample 

collected to-date from the property as discussed in Section 13.0.  Depending upon the size of the bulk 

sample collected, this work is pending the need to first define a mineral resource and create a closure plan 

for the Property with the compliance with Ontario Government regulations.
