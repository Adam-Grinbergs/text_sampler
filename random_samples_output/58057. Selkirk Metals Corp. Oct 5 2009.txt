Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 8 
December 16, 2004 

1.0 SUMMARY 
 

This Technical Report on the Red Chris project, located in northwest British Columbia, 
has been prepared for Red Chris Development Company ("RCDC") and bcMetals 
Corporation, Vancouver, B.C. as required under National Instrument NI 43-101.   
bcMetals is the 100% owner of RCDC, which in turn owns 100% of the Red Chris 
project. 

 
 The Red Chris property is located about 18 km southeast of the village of Iskut and 80 

km south of Dease Lake on the north-facing Todagin Plateau in northwestern British 
Columbia, Canada. 

 
 The Red Chris property consists of 120 two-post, 8 fractional and 28 modified grid 

contiguous mineral claims for a total of 452 units. The total claim block covers 
approximately 110 square km. 

 
 From 1968 to 1981, the property was explored by Conwest Exploration Ltd., Great 

Plains Development Co., Silver Standard Mines Ltd., Ecstall Mining Limited, and 
Texasgulf Canada Limited with geochemistry, geologic mapping, ground magnetics, 
induced polarization, trenching, and percussion and diamond drilling. 

 
 During the 1994 field season, American Bullion completed mineral claim staking, land 

surveying, line cutting, soil geochemistry, geophysics (including magnetics, V.L.F. EM 
and induced polarization), camp and core logging facility construction, HQ and NQ 
diamond drilling totalling 21,417 m in 58 holes, core sample assaying, acid base 
accounting studies, base-line environmental studies, a mineral resource estimate, 
petrographic and metallurgical studies, and documentation. The programs were 
completed between June and November, 1994 at a cost of  $4.2 million. 

 
 The 1995 American Bullion exploration program consisted of claim staking, survey 

control, soil geochemistry, geologic mapping, diamond drilling (112 holes totalling 
36,770 m), geotechnical diamond drilling at three proposed tailings dam sites, acid base 
accounting analysis, baseline environmental studies, metallurgical studies, a resource 
estimate and a scoping study by Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd. American Bullion Minerals 
Ltd. reported the 1995 exploration program cost  $5.9 million. 

 
 The property is situated regionally within the Stikinia Terrane of northern British 

Columbia. This terrane is dominated by Early Mesozoic and lesser Late Paleozoic 
island-arc volcanic strata and related subvolcanic intrusions that form a broad 
northwesterly trending belt along the centre of the province. 

 
 The Red-Chris porphyry deposit (copper-gold mineralization), is distributed along the 

central axis of the pervasively altered and fractured Red Stock. At the Red-Chris deposit, 
the Red Stock is the predominant host of the mineralization. Mineralization and 
associated alteration are more intense adjacent to the ancestral en echelon fault system 
along the axis of the stock which controlled the emplacement of the stock and later 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 9 
December 16, 2004 

altering and mineralizing hydrothermal fluids – more typical of a shear-hosted copper-
gold deposit. It has long been recognized that the Red-Chris copper-gold mineralization 
has good near-vertical and longitudinal continuity, controlled largely by post-mineral 
faulting superimposed on and along the ancestral, en echelon, central axis fault zone, 
commonly referred to as the 'East Zone Fault'. 

 
 It was recognized during early exploration of the Red Chris property that most of the 

mineralization is closely associated with individual and sheeted quartz (±carbonate) 
veining, and quartz (±carbonate) stockwork zones. 

 
 Pyrite, chalcopyrite, and lesser bornite are the principal sulphide minerals of the 

Red-Chris deposit. Minor covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and molybdenite, 
sphalerite and galena occur locally in trace amounts. Gold, second in economic 
importance to copper, occurs as electrum spatially- and genetically-associated with the 
copper mineralization. 

 
 In 2003 RCDC conducted an infill drilling program consisting of 49 holes and 16,591 m 

targeting the core in East and Main Zones where open pit mining would be expected to 
take place.  Based on this drilling, the Red Chris Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
Resources were updated and reported in the NI 43-101 Update Report dated February 16, 
2004. 

 
 The infill drill program completed in 2004 consisted of a total of 6,927 m in 25 diamond 

drill holes.  Of these holes 10 targeted the Main Zone, 4 targeted the saddle zone between 
the Main and East zones, 6 tested the East zone and 5 condemnation holes were drilled to 
the north east of the East Zone. 

 
 Based on the additional drilling completed in 2004, the geologic model, controlling the 

resource estimation at Red Chris, was adjusted from the 2003 interpretation. Within the 
Main Zone, the mineralized intrusive was modeled as a single unit with only post 
mineral faults segregated. Within the East Zone the outer core, and background intrusive 
domains were combined and joined to the Main Zone.  The inner core remained the same 
as estimated in 2003.  The Satellite Zone estimated in 2003 was renamed the East Zone 
Extension and remodeled based on 2004 drill hole data. 

 
 The Main and East Zones were modeled and estimated separately for the various 

geologic domains. Blocks 20 x 20 x 15 m were estimated for copper and gold by 
ordinary kriging. 

 
 The resource was classified by 43-101 standards as 'measured', 'indicated', and 

'inferred' by using the relative kriging estimation variance. This system of classification 
involves both geologic and grade continuity, the number of composites found and the 
distance of blocks from drill holes. 

 
 The resource estimate for all zones at a 0.2 % Cu cut-off reports 446.1 million tonnes 

measured plus indicated at an average grade of 0.36 % Cu and 0.29 g Au/t and an 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 10 
December 16, 2004 

additional 268.7 million tonnes inferred at an average grade of 0.30 % Cu and 0.27 g 
Au/t.  In addition there are 116.0 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.32 % Cu and 
0.30 g Au/t  in the Far West and Gully Zones also in the Inferred resource category at 0.2 
% Cu cutoff.  This is unchanged from the 2003 Resource estimate.  Additional drilling is 
required before this resource can be upgraded to either the Measured or Indicated 
category.  However, the expectation is that this resource will extend the life of the 
project. 

 
 The additional infill drilling completed during the 2004 field season has resulted in an 

increase in tonnes classed measured and indicated and a drop in inferred tonnes at grades 
similar to those estimated during the 2003 study. 

 
 As shown by the mineral process testing conducted by Lakefield Research Limited 

during the period from November 1995 to February 1996 and subsequently by G&T 
Metallurgical Services Ltd. in 2004, the mineralization in the Red Chris deposit responds 
well to processing by conventional crushing, grinding and flotation to produce a 
commercial grade copper-gold concentrate. The recovery of copper increases directly 
with head grade. The recovery of copper and gold values was consistently in excess of 
eighty-seven percent for copper and fifty percent for gold. 

 
 Over the course of studies on the project, possible operations of various sizes, ranging up 

to 90,000 t/d, have been examined. All of these studies have been based on open pit 
mining of at least the upper portion of the mineral deposits. The 1998 American Bullion 
Study proposed a different approach to mining of the East and Main zones, with the use 
of underground workings to excavate material from the open pit. The underground 
development, with raises from a main haulage level at the 1200m elevation up to the 
open pit, connect the mining operation to the plant site located in the valley below the 
mineral deposits. This approach was not considered viable by RCDC and was discarded 
from further consideration.  With the data and information collected for rock 
characteristics and structural geology, the foundation is established for open pit design 
and the operating parameters. 

 
 During the 2003 field season, additional geotechnical and hydrogeological data were 

collected for analysis in the Feasibility Study which commenced in mid January, 2004. 
This included additional test pitting and drilling on a potential tailings dam site and 
orientated core drilling for slope stability analysis. Additional base line studies were 
conducted in the fall of 2003 and included water quality, hydrology, fish habitat 
assessment, and wildlife surveys. Kinetic tests, to better understand and quantify the acid 
producing potential of various rock types in the area were commenced late 2003 and are 
ongoing.  More studies were conducted in the summer of 2004 to fill identified gaps in 
the base line data including Terrestrial Eco-System mapping, archaeology, traditional use 
surveys, water quality, vegetation, metals and soils survey. Also, during the winter of 
2004, additional snow course studies were undertaken. 

 
 On January 19, 2004, the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the 

Tahltan First Nation, the Iskut First Nation, and the Tahltan Joint Council. This 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 11 
December 16, 2004 

document sets out the principals for joint cooperation on the project development and 
operation between the Company and the First Nations. 

 
 The additional drill information collected in 2003 and 2004 has added confidence and 

moved a significant tonnage into the measured plus indicated category for the Red Chris 
project. Based on the positive results from that Resource update, this project moved 
directly into a full Feasibility Study. The company awarded the Red Chris Feasibility 
Study to AMEC E&C Services Limited and reported the results in a News Release dated 
November 24, 2004. 

 
 

 This Technical Report presents the following: 
 

1. The updated Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources for Red Chris following 
the summer 2004 drilling program.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
 
 
bcMetals Corporation acquired the Red Chris property in 2003 by completing the purchase of 
Red Chris Development Company Ltd. with its only material asset, the Red Chris mineral 
property interest. The 2003 fall drilling program was designed to confirm and update the 
resource model of the East and Main Zones generated from 71,472 metres of diamond drilling 
conducted over the period from 1974 to 1995. An updated resource was produced in November, 
2004 to incorporate 2004 drill results.  A total of 25 diamond drill holes were completed on the 
Main and East Zones during the summer of 2004 (holes numbered 04-296 to 04-320).  Of these 
holes 10 targeted the Main Zone, 4 targeted the saddle zone between the Main and East Zones, 6 
tested the East Zone and 5 condemnation holes were drilled to the north east of the East Zone. 
This new resource model will be used to complete a Feasibility Study which is forecast to be 
completed in early 2005.

4.2 Claim Information (Mineral Tenure) 
 
The Red Chris property consists of 120 two-post, 8 fractional and 28 modified grid contiguous 
mineral claims for a total of 452 units (see Table 1 and Figure 3). The total claim block covers 
approximately 110 square km. While limited drill hole surveys have been completed, no legal 
property-wide survey has been conducted. The core, two-post mineral claims were surveyed by 
McElhanney Associates in 1974 for the then owner Texasgulf Inc. McElhanney Consulting 
Services Ltd, while in the process of surveying in the 2003 drill hole collars for RCDC, re-
established some of the original claim survey controls and subsequently integrated this 1974 
survey into the 2003 digital format property controls.

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE & PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
5.1 Accessibility 
 
The property is helicopter accessible from Dease Lake or from several landing sites along the 
Stewart-Cassiar Highway (Highway 37) which is 12 km to the west of the claims centre (see 
Figure 2). Dease Lake is regularly serviced by scheduled commercial airline flights from either 
Smithers or Terrace. There is also a gravel airstrip 2 km north of the village of Iskut that could 
handle DC-3 aircraft. Several resorts and motels are situated along Highway 37 between Iskut 
and Tatogga Lake, which provide seasonal accommodation and meals. 
 
A rough tote road to the camp area leaves the Klappan Road just west of Ealue Lake. The road 
was constructed by Texasgulf Inc. in the 1970's and was utilized by American Bullion in the 
1990's and by Red Chris Development Company in 2003 to haul drilling rigs to the project site. 
Because of sensitive drainage crossings and the steepness of the road, project permitting allowed 
only a single movement of equipment at the commencement and termination of the 2003 drilling 
project. 
 
5.2 Physiography and Climate (Blanchflower et al., (2002)) 
 
The Red Chris property is situated on the eastern portion of the Todagin upland plateau which 
forms a subdivision of the Klastine Plateau along the northern margin of the Skeena Mountains. 
Elevations on the property are typically 1,500 ± 30 m with relatively flat topography broken by 
several deep creek gullies. Bedrock exposure is confined to the higher-relief drainages and along 
mountainous ridges (see Figure 4). The majority of the property is covered by several metres of 
glacial till. Vegetation on the plateau consists of scrub birch and willow, grasses, and mosses. 
Within the creek valleys, are several varieties of conifer and deciduous trees including balsam, 
fir, cedar, spruce, and aspen. 
 
The project area lies in a region of moderate annual precipitation with an average of 406 mm 
total annual precipitation measured over a 35 year period of record in Dease Lake. Precipitation 
is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, with April to May receiving the least and 
August to December the most. Temperatures vary from a low of -21o C in January to a high of 9o 
C in July with temperature extremes ranging from -50 o C to 30 o C.

6.0 HISTORY  (Blanchflower et al., (Nov. 18, 2002)) 
 
The first recorded exploration of the project area occurred in 1956 when Conwest Exploration 
Limited staked the Windy claims to cover prominent limonitic gossans on the Todagin Plateau. 
The showings reported (B.C.M.M. Annual Report, 1956) consisted of a large oxidized area with 
small amounts of azurite and malachite. Work consisted of a limited amount of open-cutting and 
pack-sack drilling. 
 
In September 1968, Great Plains Development Co. of Canada staked the Chris and Money claims 
to cover the headwaters of a stream in the western portion of the present project area, based on a 
strong copper anomaly in stream sediments. Over the next 2 years Great Plains conducted 
geological and geochemical surveys followed by two diamond drill holes in 1970 totalling 309 
m. One of the holes (70-2) intersected 0.25 % Cu over 73 metres. During the next two years, 
additional surveys were completed including geologic mapping, ground magnetics and induced 
polarization surveys, followed by the drilling of eight diamond drill holes in 1972, totalling 922 
m. These holes intersected weak pervasive (hypogene) alteration controlled by fracturing with 
low supergene copper mineralization near surface (Panteleyev, 1973). 
 
In 1970, Silver Standard Mines Ltd. staked the Red and Sus claims to the north and east of the 
Chris claim group. In 1971, Silver Standard conducted geologic mapping and soil geochemical 
surveys over the claims and tested anomalies with bulldozer trenches near the common boundary 
between the Red and Chris claims. Two trenches exposed low-grade copper mineralization in 
intrusive rocks. Ecstall Mining Limited (which later became Texasgulf Canada Limited, the 
Canadian subsidiary of Texasgulf Inc.), optioned the Silver Standard claims in 1973 and drilled 
14 percussion holes totalling 914 m, of which half intersected low grade copper mineralization. 
 
In 1974, Texasgulf Canada Ltd. formed an agreement with Silver Standard and Great Plains to 
acquire an option on 60 per cent of the combined Red and Chris groups of claims and paying 
80% of costs with Silver Standard and Great Plains both retaining 20 per cent. 
 
During the years from 1974 to 1976, Texasgulf drilled a total of 67 diamond drill holes (12,284 
m) and 30 percussion holes (2,261 m). During the 1978 and 1980 field seasons, Texasgulf drilled 
an additional 7 shallow core holes totalling 1,017 m to test for near-surface copper-gold 
mineralization. (Newell and Peatfield, 1995). Property-wide geological, geochemical, and 
geophysical surveys were also completed during this time. An overburden drill was utilized to 
test bedrock geochemistry in poorly exposed areas of the property. The results of this program 
outlined an area 3.4 km long, striking east-northeast, with multiple anomalies greater than 500 
ppm copper. This anomalous copper zone effectively outlines the limits of the Red intrusive 
stock. Magnetometer surveys delineated the northern intrusive contact of the Red Stock with 
volcanics but could not discriminate between the various intrusive lithologies or the Bowser 
Lake Group of clastics to the south. 
       
As a result of the Texasgulf exploration, two coalescing east-north-easterly trending zones of 
copper-gold mineralization named the Main and East zones were outlined. The mineralization 
was described as pyrite, chalcopyrite, and lesser bornite occurring spatially with zones or quartz 
vein stockwork near the centre of the Red intrusive stock. The estimated resource in 1976 at a 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 26 
December 16, 2004 

0.25% Cu cut-off was 34.4 million tonnes with an average grade of 0.51% Cu and 0.27 g/t Au to 
a depth of 270 m in the Main Zone and 6.6 million tonnes with average grade of 0.83% Cu and 
0.72 g/t Au to a depth of 150 m in the East Zone (Newell and Peatfield, 1995). 
 
No exploration was done on the property in the period 1981 to 1994. A series of corporate 
takeovers and reorganizations in January, 1994 resulted in the ownership of the property divided 
amongst Falconbridge (60%), Norcen Energy (20%), and Teck Corporation (20%). American 
Bullion Minerals Ltd. acquired an 80% interest in the property in early 1994 with Teck 
Corporation retaining the remaining 20%. American Bullion retained Mark Rebagliati to review 
and evaluate the exploration completed by previous owners. Rebagliati estimated a possible 
resource at a 0.20 % Cu cut-off of 136 million tonnes averaging 0.38 % Cu and 0.25 g Au/t. He 
estimated a higher grade core containing 37 million tonnes averaging 0.67% Cu and 0.45 g Au/t. 
Rebagliati recommended 15,000 m of diamond drilling to upgrade and expand the higher grade 
core zones and explore the remainder of the property (Rebagliati, 1994). 
 
During the 1994 field season, American Bullion completed mineral claim staking, land 
surveying, line cutting, soil geochemistry, geophysics (including magnetics, V.L.F. EM, and 
induced polarization), camp and core logging facility construction, HQ and NQ diamond drilling 
totalling 21,417 m in 58 holes, core sample assaying, acid base accounting studies, base-line 
environmental studies, a mineral resource estimate, petrographic and metallurgical studies, and 
documentation. The programs were completed between June and November, 1994 at a cost of 
CAN $4.2 million. 
 
Drilling completed in 1994 extended the lateral dimensions for mineralization in a north-south 
direction and extended the known copper-gold mineralization over vertical distances of up to 400 
m.  Geochemical and geophysical surveys extended the mineralization to the west to include the 
600 by 600 m Far West zone and the 700 by 400 m Gully zone. 
 
Based on the additional 1994 drill data the measured+indicated resource was estimated at 181 
million tonnes averaging 0.4% Cu and 0.31 g Au/t at a 0.2% Cu cut-off (Giroux, 1995). In this 
report, terms of proven, probable, and possible were used that under 43-101 Guidelines would 
conform to Measured, Indicated, and Inferred. An additional 139 million tonnes averaging 0.35% 
Cu and 0.28 g Au/t at the 0.2% Cu cut-off was classed as inferred. This resource, estimated by 
ordinary kriging of 30 x 30 x 15 m blocks, was compiled and estimated within a 1,300 x 200 m 
area to depths of between 1,050 to 1,530 m A.M.S.L. 
 
The 1995 exploration program was designed and directed to explore, expand and delineate the 
mineral resources of the Red-Chris copper-gold deposit, both laterally and vertically, and to 
evaluate the Gully and Far West zones. Field work was carried out from April 27th to November 
12th. The 1995 on- and off-site exploration work included: 

 
1) relocation and reconstruction of the core logging facilities to within 125 metres of the 

campsite; 
 
2) claim staking (ABM-7 to -11 modified grid mineral claims (56 units); 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 27 
December 16, 2004 

3) extending the survey control grid westward (20.525 line-km); 
 
4) soil geochemical sample collection and analyses (412 A-, B- or C-horizon soil samples 

collected);  
 
5) geological mapping of the East and West Gully drainages at a scale of 2:1,000 with 

coincident rock geochemical sampling (5 rock samples collected and analysed for copper 
and gold); 

 
6) exploratory HQ- and NQ-core diamond drilling (112 holes totalling 36,770.46 m or 

120,638 ft.); 
 
7) geotechnical diamond drilling at three proposed tailings dam sites along Kluea Lake valley 

(3 BQTK-core diamond drill holes totalling 59.44 m or 195 ft.); 
 
8) diamond drill collar and survey control grid surveying; 
 
9) drill sample analyses (9,783 samples assayed for copper and gold and 1,796 samples 

geochemically-analysed for copper (A.A.) and gold (F.A./A.A.); 
 
10) drill sample check-assaying (1,235 and 1,227 duplicate drill core samples assayed for 

copper and gold respectively, and 451 standard and blank samples assayed for copper and 
gold); 

 
11) mineral characterization analyses (2,458 samples for 31-element I.C.P.); 
 
12) preliminary acid base accounting analyses (123 A.B.A. analyses including 110 drill core 

samples and 13 duplicate samples based proportionately on major rock types and styles of 
mineralization); 

 
13) geotechnical core samples processed by Knight and Piesold Ltd; 
 
14) environmental studies (baseline monitoring programs for site hydrology, water quality and 

meteorology, and fish and wildlife population studies); 
 
15) metallurgical testing diamond drill core rejects from selected drill holes within the 

Red-Chris deposit and Gully Zone; 
 
16) geological resource estimation studies by G. Giroux, P. Eng., of Montgomery Consultants 

Ltd. and mining engineers of Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd.; and 
 
17) subsequent collation, compilation and documentation of the results of the program. 

 
The 1995 exploration program successfully increased the geological resources of the Red-Chris 
deposit across the width of the Red stock and over a 400-metre strike length west of the known 
mineralization. Significant near-surface copper-gold mineralization was also discovered at the 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 28 
December 16, 2004 

Gully and Far West zones. As of November, 1995, the property had been tested by a total of 244 
diamond and 44 percussion drill holes, or 74,782 metres of drilling. The results of this work 
indicate that the Red-Chris deposit is still open both laterally and vertically, and the 
newly-discovered Gully and Far West zones could also host significant near-surface copper and 
gold resources. There are also other exploration targets on the property, such as the altered and 
pyritized volcanic rocks north of the Red stock that have only received minimal investigation and 
should be evaluated by future exploration work. 

 
American Bullion Minerals Ltd. reported the 1995 exploration program cost CAN $ 5.9 million. 
 
The following is a brief summary of various resource estimates competed previous to the 2004

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The following geology summary, with the exception of section 7.8, has been taken from 
Blanchflower et al., (2002). 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 29 
December 16, 2004 

 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Stikine River area was mapped in 1957 by the Geological Survey of Canada as Operation 
Stikine (G.S.C. Map 9-1957). Later geological mapping by Souther, (1972) of the Telegraph 
Creek sheet (N.T.S. 104G, 1:250,000), and by Gabrielse and Tipper, (1984) of the Spatsizi sheet 
(N.T.S. 104H, 1:125,000) have been the regional geological database until quite recently. Recent 
geological mapping at a scale of 1:50,000 by Read, (1984) and Read and Psutka, (1990) for the 
eastern Ealue Lake area (104H/13E and W), and by the B.C. Ministry of Employment and 
Investment, Geological Survey Branch (Ash and Fraser, 1994; Ash et al., 1995; Ash et al., 1996a 
and b; Ash et al., 1997) in the Tatogga Lake area have provided valuable geological information 
in the vicinity of the subject property. The geological setting and history of the Bowser Lake 
Group, which crops out south of the Red-Chris deposit, have been documented as part of the 
multidisciplinary Bowser Basin project (Evenchick, 1991a, b; Evenchick and Green, 1990; 
Evenchick and Thorkelson, 1993; Green, 1991; Poulton et al., 1991; Ricketts, 1990; Ricketts and 
Evenchick, 1991). 
 
The Red-Chris property geology and copper-gold mineralization have been the subject of thesis 
research and corporate geological studies. Detailed geological studies include those by Schink, 
(1977) who investigated the petrology, alteration and mineralogy of the deposit for a Master of 
Science thesis, and Leitch and Elliot, (1976) who mapped the detailed geology and 
mineralization of the property for Texasgulf Inc. Furthermore, geological reports by J. R. 
Forsythe, (1975; 1977a, b; Forsythe and Peatfield, 1974; Forsythe et al., 1976), G. R. Peatfield, 
(1980, 1981) and other Texasgulf Inc. geologists have greatly contributed to the understanding of 
the deposit. Six more recent published geological reports on the deposit and its geological setting 
are by Newell and Peatfield, (1995), Ash et al., (1995), Ash et al., (1996a and b), Ash et al,. 
(1997), and Friedman and Ash, (1997). 
 
The property is situated regionally within the Stikinia Terrane of northern British Columbia. This 
terrane is dominated by Early Mesozoic and lesser Late Paleozoic island-arc volcanic strata and 
related subvolcanic intrusions that form a broad northwesterly trending belt along the centre of 
the province from southern British Columbia into southwestern Yukon Territory, often referred 
to as the 'Intermontane Belt' (Woodsworth et al., 1991). Stikinia terrane arc rocks have been 
regionally subdivided into Late Paleozoic Stikine, Late Triassic Stuhini, and Early to Middle 
Jurassic Hazelton Groups. The Late Triassic Stuhini Group rocks are dominated by submarine 
calc-alkaline basaltic volcanic rocks which are commonly augite-phyric versus those of the 
Hazelton Group which are dominated by subaerial volcanics that display a broad range in 
composition from basalt to rhyolite (Souther, 1991). 
 
The Stikinia terrane probably developed as primarily Late Triassic and Early and Middle Jurassic 
oceanic island-arcs outboard of the ancient North American continental margin (Monger, 1984). 
Island arcs evolved along the western margin of the intervening, Late Paleozoic ocean basin in 
response to westerly subduction. Early Middle Jurassic arc-continent collision, related to docking 
of the Stikinia arc with the ancient margin, resulted in southwesterly tectonic emplacement of 
oceanic Cache Creek terrane rocks above the Stikinia terrane. The uplifted oceanic crust shed

clastic flysch sediments southwardly into the newly developed continental margin to form the 
Bowser Lake Group (Ash et al., 1995). 
 
 According to Ash et al., (1996a), 
 

"The map area (Kluea Lake - 104H/12, Kinaskan Lake - 104G/9) is underlain almost 
entirely by Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic arc-volcanic rocks that are overlain along 
their southeastern margin by Middle Jurassic Bowser Lake Group sediments. These 
Mesozoic volcanic rocks are divisible into three broad northeast-trending belts. The 
northwestern belt is dominated by Middle (?) to Upper Triassic andesitic volcaniclastics, 
mainly massive breccias. The central belt is underlain primarily by Upper Triassic and 
possibly Lower Jurassic fine to medium-grained epiclastic rocks. Lower Jurassic rocks 
comprise a bimodal suite of basalts and rhyolites and related subvolcanic rocks that 
overlie and intrude very fine to medium-grained sedimentary rocks primarily to the 
southeast. The younger rocks also locally intrude and overlie Triassic rocks throughout 
the map area. 

 
These rocks have been affected by folding and faulting. Mesoscopic folding is generally 
only identified with the Lower Jurassic and older, thinly bedded sediments, mainly 
siltstones, and rarely in limestone. Broader warping of thicker bedded sequences is a 
characteristic megascopic feature commonly seen in cliff exposures. High-angle brittle 
faults are abundant throughout the map area and contacts are rarely exposed. As a 
result, it is difficult to establish continuity of contacts between individual Mesozoic 
volcanic units." 

 
Based upon fossil evidence, Ash et al., (1996) found that most of the Lower Jurassic sections 
within the map area probably represent a short interval between 200 and 193 Ma (i.e. Sinemurian 
to Pliensbachian). 
 
A suite of earliest Early Jurassic (195 to 205 Ma) stocks and dykes occur throughout the region. 
These intrusions are compositionally variable, ranging from hornblende quartz diorite to quartz 
monzodiorite, and are characteristically medium-grained, equigranular to porphyritic and 
weather a buff-white to light grey colour. The largest intrusion of this suite is the Red stock 
which hosts the Red-Chris deposit. It intrudes Upper Triassic massive volcanic wackes, siltstone 
and possibly augite-porphyritic basalt within the Red-Chris property (Ash et al., 1996). 
 
Middle Jurassic (Bathonian to Early Oxfordian) marine clastic sedimentary rocks (Gabrielse and 
Tipper, 1984; Poulton et al., 1991) of the Bowser Lake Group, underlying the southern portion 
of the subject property, are assigned to the basal Ashman Formation and comprise siltstone, chert 
pebble conglomerate and sandstone (Evenchick and Thorkelson, 1993). Sedimentalogical studies 
indicate that Bowser Lake Group rocks become progressively younger to the south and that 
deposition was from the north into the tectonically active northern margin of the Bowser Basin 
(Ricketts, 1990; Ricketts and Evenchick, 1991; Green, 1991). 
 
Within the region there are several isolated outcrops of olivine-phyric basalt flows, belonging to 
the Early Pliocene Maitland Volcanics, overlying the Stikinia terrane rocks; a few of which 
occur on the subject property (Ash et al., 1996).

Major regional faulting has affected the local stratigraphy during Middle Cretaceous and Tertiary 
tectonism. The east-northeasterly trending Ealue Lake Fault is the most prominent structural 
feature in the vicinity of the subject property. Although not exposed, it has been projected along 
the Coyote Creek-Ealue Lake Valley (Ash et al., 1995). Its presence is evident by contrasting 
lithologies and styles of alteration on either side. Zones of intense carbonatization with localized 
areas of ankerite flooding are widespread in rocks only south of the fault (Ash et al., 1995). Also, 
its continuity to the east has been determined for an additional 30 kilometres where it has been 
designated the McEwan Creek Fault with a south side-down movement sense (Read and Psutka, 
1990). There are also similarly-oriented faults along the northern contact of the Bowser Lake 
Group; one of which is the southside-down normal bounding fault between the Bowser Lake 
Group rocks and the Red stock near the centre of the property.

7.2 Local Geology 
 
The property covers the eastern portion of a large east-northeasterly trending, 
stratigraphically-distinct, fault bounded upland called the 'Todagin Plateau' (Ash et al., 1995). 
The lithologic units on the property have been described chronologically from oldest to 
youngest. 
 

a) Middle to Upper Triassic Volcanic and Sedimentary Rocks (muTva and muTvs) 
 
Recent geological mapping by Ash et al., (1994 and 1995) has identified an intercalated 
sequence of augite-phyric volcanic and volcanically-derived sedimentary rocks cropping out 
between the northeastern slopes of Todagin Mountain and Ealue Lake, underlying most of the 
northern portion of the property. 
 
Alkaline volcanic rocks, informally called the 'Dynamite Hill' volcanics (Leitch and Elliot, 
1976), crop out immediately north and northwest of the Red stock, along the East Gully to 
Bowers Creek drainages north to Ealue Lake. They also reportedly occur on the southeastern 
side of the Red stock in fault contact with the Middle Jurassic Bowser Lake Group sedimentary 
rocks. 
 
Ash et al., (1995) found the volcanic rocks to be dominated by augite-phyric pillowed flows and 
flow breccias of basaltic composition. Leitch and Elliot, (1976) describe these rocks as massive 
porphyritic basic volcanics with no visible structure; however, Schink, (1977) and Forsythe, 
(1976) suggest that they are dominated by relatively massive flows which locally exhibit poorly 
developed pillow structures and flow banding. They appear on surface to be dark green-coloured, 
quite massive, and with varying amounts augite, hornblende and plagioclase phenocrysts in a 
green chloritic groundmass. Rocks observed along the intrusive contact of the Red Stock are 
often bleached and pyritized resulting in a pale green to buff colour, and a more felsic 
macroscopic colouration. 
 
The volcanic rocks are locally intercalated with Middle to Upper Triassic volcanically-derived 
fine-grained sedimentary rocks (VSED), including volcanic wacke (feldspathic sandstone), 
siltstone and siliceous siltstone, on a scale of metres to tens of metres (Leitch and Elliot, 1976; 
Ash et al., 1995). Volcanically-derived sedimentary rocks are much more prevalent in the 
western map-area. At the Gully Zone the volcanically-derived sedimentary rocks have been 
intersected by deep drilling and host a significant portion of the copper-gold mineralization 
where they occur as faulted slices and wedges within the fault-brecciated margins of the Red 
Stock. These rocks also occur at the Far West Zone where they host a portion of the 
mineralization and occur in intrusive contact with the Red stock. 
 
 b) Early Jurassic Plutonic Rocks 
 
Several stocks and dykes of hornblende-plagioclase porphyritic quartz monzodiorite composition 
have been mapped within the Todagin Plateau area by Leitch and Elliot, (1976) and Ash and 
Fraser, (1994). These intrusions occur in close proximity to the Red stock and are very similar to 
it in geometry and texture. They are described by Ash et al., (1995) as intrusive rocks that 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 34 
December 16, 2004 

weather buff-white to light grey, and have distinctive medium- to coarse-grained hornblende and 
plagioclase phenocrysts randomly oriented in an aphanitic grey groundmass. 
 
Ash (1996) reports that four zircon fractions from drill core of the Red stock (i.e. DDH 94-224) 
have been Pb-U dated as 203.8 ±1.3 Ma, or of earliest Early Jurassic age. This date correlates 
well with three dates from various other plutons throughout the Tatogga Lake map area that 
ranged from 199 to 205 Ma. All samples also show an Early Paleozoic inheritance at 500 Ma. 
 
The Red stock is elongate, irregular in shape, and occupies a major east-northeasterly en echelon 
fault structure. It is at least 4.5 kilometres long by 300 to 1,500 metres wide, but it may also 
extend well beyond its exposed boundaries as a buried pluton beneath the partially eroded older 
volcanic and sedimentary cover. Various plutons both east and west of the main stock were 
identified by Leitch and Elliot, (1976) but, except for variation of pyrite and hornblende 
contents, they were apparently identical and are probably apophyses of a larger intrusion. 
 
According to Leitch and Elliot, (1976), volcanic rocks in contact with the Red stock display local 
thermal metamorphic and metasomatic features, such as moderate hornfelsing, increased 
pyritization and propylitic alteration, but they have not been foliated. These features suggest that 
the stock was indeed emplaced hypabyssally and is probably comagmatic with the surrounding 
volcanic country rocks. 
 
Two compositionally-similar phases of plutonic rocks comprise the stock and these rocks are cut 
by several post-mineral dykes of dioritic to monzonitic composition. The 'Main Phase' unit is a 
medium-grained, weakly- to intensely-altered plagioclase-hornblende porphyritic monzodiorite 
that hosts most of the known copper-gold mineralization and constitutes approximately seventy 
to eighty (70-80) percent of the stock. The 'Late Phase' unit is now thought to comprise both 
unaltered and barren Main Phase and post-mineral dykes with indistinct flow banded and chilled 
margins; all of which are remarkably similar in composition and texture to very weakly altered 
Main Phase rocks. However, the Late Phase unit appears to be fresher looking and less altered 
than the Main Phase unit, usually barren of copper-gold mineralization, and represents 
approximately twenty to twenty-eight (20-28) percent of the stock. The late-stage, post-mineral 
dykes are commonly porphyritic, range in composition from dioritic to monzonitic, are usually 
less than 1 to 5 metres wide; although they may attain widths of up to fifty (50) metres in the 
western end of the Red-Chris deposit area. These dykes comprise the remaining volume of the 
Red stock. 
 
Intrusive breccia occurs throughout the Red stock; especially along the northeastern and western 
margins of the Red-Chris deposit and within the Gully and Far West zones. Breccia bodies may 
range locally in width from a few metres to 100 metres or more. Their contacts are relatively 
distinct; marked by a rapid increase or decrease of subangular to angular fragments of plutonic 
rock. These fragments can vary from less than a centimetre to several metres in diameter. 
 
The Red stock and older country rocks are cut by several varieties of late-stage, post-mineral 
dykes; identified by their texture, mineralogy and appearance. There are three main varieties, 
from oldest to youngest: Porphyritic Feldspar-Hornblende-Biotite Dykes (DPFH), 
Quartz-Carbonate Amygdaloidal Dykes (DQCA), and Mafic Dykes (DMAF).

 c) Lower to Middle Jurassic Volcanic Rocks (Units IJrv and IJv) 
 
Lower to Middle Jurassic trachytic to rhyolitic flows have been mapped at the western end of the 
Red stock along the Bower Creek drainage (Ash et al., 1995). These volcanics were also mapped 
by Leitch and Elliot, (1976) who classified them as intermediate to acid volcanics and minor 
pyroclastics. They reported that these volcanics are more varied than those underlying Dynamite 
Hill and that the rocks ranged from dark green andesite to orange trachyte and white rhyolite. 
Minor tuffaceous volcaniclastics are intercalated with the volcanics rocks. They appear to be 
late-stage extrusive equivalents of the Red Stock intrusion (Schink, 1977) with bedding attitudes 
striking 090o and dipping northward at -45o along the north side of the stock to striking north and 
dipping sub-vertically further to the west (Leitch and Elliot, 1976). 
 
 d) Middle Jurassic Ashman Formation (basal Bowser Lake Group; mJA) 
 
Marine clastic sedimentary rocks of the Ashman Formation, a basal unit of the Middle Jurassic 
Bowser Lake Group, underlie the southern property boundary, along the ridgeline between the 
Red stock and Kluea Lake. The Ashman Formation is comprised of siltstone, chert-pebble 
conglomerate and sandstone (Evenchick and Thorkelson, 1993). Bowser Lake Group rocks 
young progressively to the south; indicating that deposition was from the north into the 
tectonically-active northern margin of the Bowser Basin (Ricketts, 1990; Ricketts and 
Evenchick, 1991; Green, 1991). 
 
Massive to well-bedded chert-pebble conglomerates occur in fault contact with the southern 
margin of the Red stock. Repetitively-bedded laminae, varying from 5 to 15 cm thick, are 
defined by an up-section reduction in both size and abundance of chert clasts. Local massive 
conglomerates contain 40 to 60 percent sandstone clasts and/or matrix sandstone. Both laminated 
and massive conglomerates have subrounded, 0.5 to 3 cm diameter, light to dark grey or green 
chert pebbles in a tan brown to grey sandstone matrix. 
 
 e) Maitland Volcanics 
 
Near the headwaters of the East and West Gully drainages there are small outcrops of columnar 
olivine-phyric basalt flows (Schink, 1977). These rocks represent the youngest rocks in the 
region, probably of Early Pliocene age (Gabrielse and Tipper, 1984; Ash et al., 1996). 
 
7.3 Veining and Stockwork 
 
It was recognized during early exploration of this property that most of the mineralization is 
closely associated with individual and sheeted quartz (±carbonate) veining, and quartz 
(±carbonate) stockwork zones. Thus, considerable work has been undertaken to understand the 
relationship and distribution of very weak to intense quartz veining and stockwork zones with 
potentially economic copper-gold mineralization. Following the discovery of the Gully and Far 
West zones in 1995, it is now recognized that a significant portion of the mineralization also 
occurs as very fine- to fine-grained disseminations and fracture-fillings; resulting in visual under 
estimations of grades.  
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 36 
December 16, 2004 

Quartz-carbonate veining is ubiquitous throughout the Red stock and in Middle to Upper Triassic 
country rocks; especially in zones of fracturing and carbonatization. Pyrite, chalcopyrite, 
magnetite with lesser hematite and rare molybdenite are often associated with quartz-carbonate 
veining as fine-grained disseminations within the vein core or as disseminations and/or fracture 
filling along the vein selvages.  
 
Several discontinuous zones of intense silica flooding, accompanied by significant copper-gold 
mineralization, form the core of the quartz-carbonate-sulphide vein stockwork in the Red-Chris 
deposit. These zones are from 10 to 40 metres wide and are more common at the eastern end. 
They have an apparent 060o to 070o strike but cross-sectional plots show their orientation is 
controlled by east-west, sub-vertical splay fault structures from the larger East Zone fault 
structure. Geological modeling of high grade copper-gold mineralization associated with these 
zones shows the sheeted quartz veining to trend easterly (090o) and plunge -25o to -40o eastward. 
A similar orientation is indicated for the less common sheeted quartz zones in the western half of 
the deposit. These sheeted quartz zones have not been intersected by any recent drilling in the 
Gully and Far West zones. 
 
The sheeted quartz zones are lenticular and composed of parallel to sub parallel quartz-sulphide 
(± carbonate) veins. They grade outward into an intense quartz-carbonate-sulphide vein 
stockwork, and are often associated with younger intense faulting that appears to be 
superimposed on a pre-existing zone of structural weakness through which the highly siliceous 
hydrothermal fluids were emplaced. Their present discontinuity appears to be a function of later 
faulting, rather than a primary feature. Altered Main Phase host rock fragments are locally 
included in the quartz sheeted zones. They have sharp boundaries with the enclosing quartz veins 
and abundant chalcopyrite disseminations near their margins; indicating that the sheeted 
quartz-sulphide veins were emplaced quite quickly without pervasive silicification (Schink, 
1977). 
 
Sheeted quartz-carbonate-sulphide zones generally host quite high grade copper-gold 
mineralization but the zones of weak to intense quartz-sulphide-carbonate stockwork account for 
most of the mineralized resources. 
 
Quartz-sulphide stockwork veins range from 3 to 10 mm in width, rarely attain 1 cm, and form a 
randomly orientated network pattern with at least two generations present. They are usually 
symmetrical and characterized by sharp, parallel walls and regular selvages. Sulphides are 
usually confined to a central vein fracture or core, and to minute cross-fractures. Minor ankerite, 
magnetite and hematite are usually present in the vein core. Repeated episodes of fracturing and 
mineralization are reflected by crosscutting relationships. Alteration envelopes appear to be 
lacking, or they have been overprinted by later alteration facies. 
 
Quartz-sulphide vein stockwork is typically absent in Late Phase rocks. Trace quartz stringers or 
veins are occasionally observed but they usually barren of sulphides. These veins are generally 
less than 1 cm wide with irregular, vague boundaries and are comprised of white quartz ± 
magnetite. 
 
The grades of copper-gold mineralization are very correlative with the intensity of 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 37 
December 16, 2004 

quartz-sulphide stockwork veining in the Red-Chris deposit, unlike the Gully and Far West 
mineralization. Quartz-sulphide stockwork intensity was based upon the following arbitrary 
categories: 
 
  Trace   Rare vein 
  Very Weak  Less than 1 vein per metre 
  Weak   1 to 12 veins per metre 
  Moderate  12 to 30 veins per metre 
  Strong   More than 30 veins per metre

Figure 6 - Property Geology Map 

 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 39 
December 16, 2004 

It is recognized that the intensity of stockwork veining, although usually gradational, can 
increase or decrease rapidly across fault structures. 
 
The majority of the mineralized resources occur in well developed quartz-sulphide (± carbonate) 
vein stockwork zones. These zones are spatially and probably genetically related to major 
east-northeasterly faulting in the East Zone (see Figure 7) and easterly faulting in the Main (see 
Figure 8), Gully and Far West zones. Although younger reactivated faults, such as the East Zone 
fault and its splay faults, have cut and locally displaced the quartz-sulphide stockwork zones they 
are distributed along the central long axis of the Red stock and dip steeply southward in the East 
Zone to subvertical in the Main Zone; similar to later faulting. 
 
The quartz-sulphide (± carbonate) stockwork zones in the Far West and Gully zones appear to be 
vertical or steeply south dipping similar to the east-west reactivated faulting to the east, but they 
are not as intense as those in the Red-Chris deposit. Within the Gully and Far West areas, very 
weak to moderate quartz stockwork zones are also hosted by volcanically-derived sedimentary 
rocks, and there is considerable finely disseminated chalcopyrite mineralization with gold values 
associated with these stockwork zones; unlike similar stockwork zones within the plutonic rocks. 
 
Irregular zones of weak to strong gypsum veining are located west and southwest of the 
Red-Chris deposit and in the Gully and Far West zones. Gypsum veins and fracture fillings cut 
all other vein types on the property, and are hosted by the Main and Late Phase units and 
late-stage quartz-carbonate amygdaloidal dykes (Unit DQCA) of the Red stock. Gypsum zones 
do not crop out but are most often intersected as irregular flat-lying features at depths of less than 
10 metres to greater than 350 metres with continuous intersections over 100 metres. There are at 
least two periods of gypsum veining present on the property; one period either pre-dates or is 
contemporaneous with the emplacement of the Red stock and a second period post-dates the 
mineralization. 
 
Carbonate (± quartz) veins and carbonatization of groundmass minerals to ankerite and iron-rich 
magnesite are widespread throughout the Red stock. Within structural zones the Middle to Upper 
Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks are also intensely carbonatized. Carbonate (ankerite 
more than calcite) veins occur as white to pale pink irregular veins averaging 2 to 7 mm wide. 
These veins are commonly barren of sulphides but rarely and locally host pyrite, chalcopyrite 
and minor sphalerite and galena. Carbonate is also common as fracture fillings and locally occurs 
as the matrix to tectonic breccias. Sphalerite and minor galena often occur together in pink to 
buff carbonate-dolomite veins cutting mineralization. Carbonate veins appear to be very late 
structures since they cut mineralized quartz veins and late-stage quartz-carbonate amygdule 
dykes; thus, they appear to post-date the main copper-gold hydrothermal mineralizing event. 
 
7.4 Alteration 
 
Most of the Main Phase unit of the Red stock has been repeatedly and variably altered by 
apparently epizonal hydrothermal fluids since its emplacement. The post-mineral Late Phase unit 
is usually quite fresh to only very weakly altered. A primary porphyritic texture is always 
observed but it may be partially obliterated by alteration around late-stage quartz-carbonate 
fracture fillings. None of the Bowser Lake Group rocks have been affected by any of the 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 40 
December 16, 2004 

pervasive alteration present in the Middle Triassic to Lower Jurassic intrusive and volcanic rocks 
that are situated immediately north of the South Boundary fault structure. 
 
Six alteration facies were identified by Schink, (1977) based on petrography and the presence of 
ankerite.  
 
American Bullion Minerals field personnel could not recognize six facies because both ankerite 
and the albitization of feldspars are only visible microscopically. The following alteration 
assemblages have been modified from Schink, (1977) and adapted for diamond drill core logging 
during the 1994 and 1995 exploration programs. RCDC geologists used the same alteration 
categories and alteration codes for the 2003 in-fill diamond drilling program. The following 
alteration descriptions described by Blanchflower (Blanchflower et al., 2002)) were followed in 
logging the 2003 drill core. 
 
Potassic alteration is sporadic and quite limited; perhaps representing only 10 to less than 15 
percent of the total altered area. It dominantly occurs in the eastern portion of the Red-Chris 
deposit as narrow discontinuous zones a few metres wide that have gradational to sharp contacts 
with zones of quartz-sericite ± hematite±kaolinite±ankerite alteration. Where the Main Phase 
unit has been affected by potassic alteration the rocks have a light orange-brown to salmon 
colour and mottled appearance. The porphyritic texture of the rock is often partially or 
completely destroyed and its primary mineral constituents show complete replacement. 
Plagioclase phenocrysts are pseudomorphed by microcrystalline sericite, hematitic albite, 
ankerite and quartz. Relict hornblende phenocrysts are more commonly altered to a fine grained, 
felted brown biotite and but may also be pseudomorphed by granular ankerite, pyrite and light 
coloured chlorite. Rare primary biotite phenocrysts are replaced by pseudomorphic muscovite 
with minor ankerite. The groundmass is flooded with secondary very fine-grained orthoclase and 
biotite phenocrysts, and it may also contain ankerite, sericite, kaolinite, quartz, magnetite, 
hematite, pyrite, and trace apatite, tourmaline and zircon in varying amounts. 
 
Phyllic (quartz-sericite-pyrite±ankerite) alteration is pervasive and strongly developed 
throughout the Red-Chris deposit and western map-area. It occurs discontinuously throughout 
the Red stock, commonly in the Late Phase unit, and as restricted zones in the volcanic and 
volcaniclastic country rocks (Schink, 1977). In hand specimen, phyllic alteration is pale grey 
with a distinctive bleached appearance. Primary textures are only partially obliterated. Relict 
plagioclase phenocrysts are bleached with a pale green colour; their grain boundaries are 
generally preserved but the interiors are usually replaced by microcrystalline sericite and ankerite 
with minor quartz, dolomite and kaolinite. Groundmass feldspars are replaced by fine, anhedral 
quartz and interstitial sericite. Hornblende phenocrysts are typically completely destroyed; with 
rare remnant phenocrysts showing replacement by sericite and minor dolomite (Schink, 1977). 
Pervasive and abundant ankerite occurs usually in the groundmass and less commonly with 
quartz as vein selvages, but it is only obvious in weathered diamond drill core. It can account for 
1 to 7 percent of the rock volume.

Mottled phyllic alteration was thought to be a transition between argillic (quartz-sericite± 
hematite ±kaolinite ±ankerite) and pervasive phyllic (quartz-sericite-pyrite ± ankerite) alteration. 
Its inner margins may coincide with the disappearance of widespread hematite and magnetite, 
and with the appearance of abundant pyrite, marking the edge of the pyrite halo. It is now 
thought that the mottled phyllic assemblage represents a zone of alteration overprinting. 
 
Quartz-sericite± hematite ± kaolinite± ankerite alteration is usually restricted to zones of 
moderate to intense quartz-sulphide stockwork veining that are developed within the Main Phase 
unit. This alteration facies is characterized by the presence of pale green plagioclase relics and 
pale brown hornblende pseudomorphs set in a pale, light to medium brown, aphanitic 
groundmass. It was the opinion of Schink, (1977) that this alteration facies occurred quite early 
during the hydrothermal process; however, since it usually occurs within zones of intense 
fracturing and quartz vein stockwork it is difficult to determine its temporal relationships with

December 16, 2004 

other alteration facies. This alteration facies occurs with the majority of copper-gold 
mineralization. 
 
Propylitic alteration is poorly developed within the Red stock. In the Main Phase unit 
epidote-chlorite-pyrite-calcite alteration is characterized by pseudomorphic replacement of 
andesine phenocrysts by hematitic albite and lesser epidote. Biotite and hornblende are replaced 
by chlorite and calcite (Schink, 1977) and occasional epidote. Locally some 
feldspar-hornblende-biotite porphyry dykes (DPFH) have epidote replacement of hornblende 
phenocrysts. The augite-phyric volcanic country rocks situated immediately north of the Red 
stock, underlying Dynamite Hill, are altered by this facies and host 5 percent disseminated 
epidote and 2 to 5 percent pyrite as disseminations and veinlets. 
 
7.5 Structure 
 
The structural setting of the property is dominated by east-northeasterly trending en echelon fault 
structures. The elongated Red stock occupies and has been displaced by at least one major 
east-northeasterly trending ancestral fault structure that has been repetitively reactivated during 
Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic time. This fault structure and several similarly-oriented faults, 
such as the one bounding the northern margins of the Bowser Lake Group, are probably 
subsidiary or parasitic structures related to movements along the larger and east-northeasterly 
striking Ealue Lake Fault. 
 
Structural evidence for the repeated reactivation of a fault zone centred on and beneath the Red 
stock is obvious from the shape of the intrusion, the orientation of its major rock units, and the 
distribution and displacements of the alteration facies, sulphide mineralization and late-stage 
dykes. Forsythe, (1976) and Meade (in Peatfield, 1975) both concluded that much of the faulting 
is normal dip-slip in character, typified by hinge movements with the south-side blocks rotating 
and sliding downward, and that the fault planes seem to be concave to the south. Recent deep 
drilling results indicate that the faulting may have a more significant lateral component and that 
the fault planes appear convex to the south. 
 
The Red stock is cut by several en echelon fault zones that probably reflect the youngest tectonic 
event but appear to be superimposed over the inferred trace of the larger ancestral structure. The 
most important of these, from an exploration standpoint, is the 'East Zone Fault'. This steeply 
southeasterly-dipping (-75°) fault zone strikes west-southwesterly (240°) from the eastern end of 
the Red stock, through the middle of the East Zone, to grid coordinates 100025 North by 50300 
East. At this point it appears to bend due westerly and steepen vertically. It then splays into 
several east-west, sub-vertical fault structures that cut through the middle of the Main Zone. Both 
the strong to intense quartz stockwork zones and the associated fracture filling copper-gold 
mineralization are spatially-related to this structure. In the East Zone, the bornite-rich 
mineralization has an east-west trend and moderate easterly plunge related to east-west splay 
faults joining the East Zone fault. On drill cross-sections this mineralization is subvertical to very 
steeply southerly dipping. In the Main Zone the mineralization has a similar orientation but a 
more moderate easterly plunge, and the majority of the Late Phase dykes appear to be similarly 
controlled by these east-west splay faults. 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 44 
December 16, 2004 

Earlier geological work by Texasgulf personnel (Leitch and Elliot, 1976; Forsythe, 1977) 
inferred that the East Zone fault dipped steeply north within both the East and Main zones. Most 
of their drilling was directed southwardly and oriented at -45° to -60° to intersect the inferred 
steeply north-dipping structurally-related mineralization. It now appears that, except for the 
eastern portion of the East Zone, most of this mineralization is vertical to sub-vertical and could 
be tested by either southerly or northerly directed drilling. Furthermore, despite the structural 
complexity of the deposit much of the youngest faulting and many of the late-stage dykes are 
remarkably continuous, both laterally and vertically. Less than one-metre wide faults and dykes 
can be readily traced from multiple drill intercepts in a vertical plane, and usually laterally, over 
distances of several hundreds of metres. 
 
Another major northeasterly trending fault structure underlies much of the Camp Creek drainage, 
called the 'South Boundary Fault' (Newell and Peatfield, 1995). It unconformably separates the 
southern margins of the Red stock and the surrounding Upper Triassic volcanic strata from 
Middle Jurassic Bowser Lake Group (Ashman Formation) clastic sedimentary rocks. This fault is 
not exposed on surface; however, geological, geomorphological and drill hole evidence show 
that it has been responsible for down-dropping the Bowser Lake Group rocks and obliquely 
truncating the southwestern margin of the Red stock. Several east-west splay faults from this 
structure appear to cut and displace the mineralization of the Main, East and Gully zones and 
parallel the distribution of the Late Phase dykes in the Main and Gully zones.  
 
The quartz stockwork zones, mineralization and some late-stage dykes in the Main Zone and 
eastern end of the East Zone and in the Gully and Far West zones appear to have been locally 
displaced by a set of north-northwesterly (340°) strike-slip faults; probably conjugate scissor 
structures related to transcurrent movements along the East Zone and South Boundary fault 
zones. Texasgulf Inc. plotted geological surface and bench plans with regular multiple sets of 
north-northwesterly and north-northeasterly faults to explain truncations of various geological 
features they encountered.  
 
Larger fault structures occur as gouge and/or brecciated zones. Gouge zones range from a few 
centimetres to several metres wide. They are usually grey to black in colour and commonly 
contain rounded to angular fragments, usually less than 2 cm in diameter, of altered Main Phase, 
Late Phase and occasionally mineralized quartz stockwork fragments in a matrix of clay, quartz 
and carbonate and finely grained pyrite (Blanchflower et al., (Nov. 18, 2002)). In the Main Zone, 
many of these east-west structures contain fragments of or are partially occupied by narrow late-
stage dykes. Faults intersecting mineralized zones can either contain the copper values of their 
host rocks or appear to be dramatically diluted by faulted and sheared dyke material. 
 
In the 2002 drilling program the large South Boundary Fault was intersected in the north 
orientated (-63° N) geotechnical hole DDH 03-278. This hole was collared in heavily faulted and 
sheared Ashman Formation argillaceous siltstones and chert-pebble conglomerates. The Red 
Stock contact was intersected at 81 metres and the South Boundary Fault cut between 81 and 134 
metres. The fault consisted of angular fragments of intensely silicified Late Phase and Main 
Phase rock in a matrix of light grey intense clay-fault altered granulated wall rock. At 134.1 
metres the clay alteration ends and the matrix is composed of quartz-sericite altered intrusive, 5-
7% disseminated pyrite and low copper values. The estimated width of this south dipping fault is 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 45 
December 16, 2004 

50 to 85 metres. 
 
The regional structures that controlled the emplacement of the Red Stock have been repetitively 
reactivated before, during, and after the structurally controlled mineralizing event that formed the 
various Red Chris mineral zones. The above described South Boundary Fault was one of the 
latest fault movements but essentially parallels the 'East Zone Fault' and is probably a 
reactivation of the original structures that controlled the emplacement of the Red Stock. 
 
7.6 Geologic Model 
 
The 2003, 49 hole diamond drilling program undertaken by Red Chris Development Corp, on the 
Red Chris property, was designed to upgrade the known drill resources and verify the previous 
geologic model. In December 1995, D. Blanchflower and engineers of Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd. 
prepared a geological model of the Red Chris deposit which encompassed the lateral and vertical 
limits of the known mineralization. As a large scale open pit operation was planned, only Late 
Phase dykes exceeding 10 metres in thickness were modelled as internal waste, and no narrow 
barren dykes or structural features, such as shear and fault zones, were distinguished. 
 
The model was refined by Blanchflower and Giroux in 1998 when the then property owner, 
American Bullion Minerals Ltd., contracted them to identify the detailed geological and 
structural features that control the higher grade copper-gold mineralization in the Red Chris 
deposits. American Bullion had been re-evaluating the earlier resource model in order to plan a 
more selective and potentially lower cost innovative open pit mining operation. Blanchflower, in 
his November 18, 2002 report for American Reserve Energy Corporation, describes the geologic 
model used in this study as follows: 
 

"It has long been recognized that the Red-Chris copper-gold mineralization has good 
near-vertical and longitudinal continuity, controlled largely by post-mineral faulting 
superimposed on and along the ancestral, en echelon, central axis fault zone, 
commonly referred to as the 'East Zone Fault'. Furthermore, some post-mineral 
dykes, such as the quartz-eye porphyry variety, are recognized as occupying the same 
structural features that controlled the late-stage and higher grade copper-gold 
mineralization. Thus, detailed modelling of the deposit incorporated the local 
geologic and structural features unique to each of the Main and East zones. 
 
For modelling purposes, American Bullion provided vertical sections and plan views 
spaced at 50 metres and 15 metres respectively; covering the entire Red-Chris 
deposit. It was decided to subdivide the copper mineralization into three mineralized 
domains. These domains were designated as being: 'Inner Core' which comprised 
most copper mineralization equal to or exceeding a grade of 0.4 percent copper; 
'Outer Shell' which comprised most copper mineralization ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 
percent copper; and 'Main Phase' which comprised the remainder of the Red stock 
and included mineralization with grades dominantly less than 0.2 percent copper. 
The distribution of the gold mineralization was not modelled because it is intimately 
and proportionately associated with the copper mineralization. 
 
The factors controlling the distribution of the three mineralized domains were 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 46 
December 16, 2004 

identified as being: structural features (i.e. post-mineral faults and shear zones), 
geological features (i.e. Main Phase host rock versus post-mineral Late Phase and 
other dykes) and the distribution of mineralization based upon assay results. These 
three factors were all considered in outlining the boundaries of the 'Inner Core', 
'Outer Shell' and 'Main Phase' mineral domains." 
 

The 2003 in-fill diamond drilling program was concentrated on the core areas of the East and 
Main mineral zones and the drill holes were sited between the previous 50 metre drill sections 
and were often orientated northerly rather than to the south, as had been the case with previous 
programs. The additional in-fill drilling data allowed for the construction of vertical sections on 
25 metre centres along the axis of the Red Chris East and Main Zones. This work is ongoing at 
the time of this report writing but sufficient data have been compiled to provide an updated 
geologic model for the 2004 resource calculations. 
 
It was decided to impose a hard boundary around the East Zone core mineralization similar to the 
"Inner Core" domain constructed by American Bullion in 1998. The 2003 drilling provided more 
data to incorporate into the detailed construction of the 2004 domain shells. The "Inner" shell 
outline, which comprises most copper mineralization equal to or exceeding a grade of 0.3 percent 
copper, was drawn on vertical cross sections constructed on 25 metre centres.  Because of the 
abrupt termination in copper grade in the East Zone, this grade shell often matched the 0.4% 
shell used by American Bullion. The digitized, vertical section grade shell was transferred and 
smoothed onto plan views spaced on 15 metre levels down to the 1145 metre elevation. Below 
the 1145 metre level, the plans were produced on 30 metre intervals to the model base at 900 
metres. A solid model of the core zone was then constructed from the level plan boundaries. 
 
In the East Zone, a second copper grade shell was placed around the copper mineralization 
grading from 0.2 to 0.3 percent copper and the entire zone was constrained by the Bowser 
sediment contact to the south and the Dynamite Hill volcanics to the north. A small isolated 0.2 
shell 'Satellite Zone' was put around drill holes DH 119 and DH 184 on section 51,000 E to 
restrain their influence on blocks within the 0.2 percent shell surrounding the "Inner Core" 
domain. 
 
The new geologic model developed for the Main Zone differed significantly from that used in 
the previous 1998 study. The 2003 Main Zone drilling results indicated there was no need to 
define a higher grade "Core Zone" boundary or limit the copper mineralization domain with a 
0.2 copper percent grade shell. Like the East Zone, the Main Zone was constrained by the 
Bowser sediment contact to the south and the Dynamite Hill volcanics to the north. Late Phase 
monzodiorite dykes and other dykes whose widths were greater than 10 metres were digitized 
using the new cross sections and solid models of the dykes were developed and used as hard 
boundaries during the block modeling. These barren dykes frequently occupy the core structures 
that controlled the higher grade copper-gold mineralization in the Main Zone.  
 
The geologic model for the Main Zone remained relatively unchanged from the previous version 
(Giroux, et al., 2004). Only minor corrections were made to the boundaries of the southern dyke 
complex which was intersected by four of the new drill holes.  Slight adjustments were also 
made to the contacts of the Red Stock which were intersected by two of the 2004 drill holes. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 47 
December 16, 2004 

 
For the 2004 estimate, the division between the Main and East zones at 50650 E was changed to 
a soft boundary meaning data from one side could influence blocks on the other. 
 
The East Zone outer core grade shell surrounding the East Zone high grade core was removed 
and a revised grade shell was imposed on the eastern side of the East Zone core.  The reason for 
the removal of the lower-grade shell was the belief that stricter limitations imposed on the 
kriging procedure would provide a more realistic simulation of the grade distribution.  
 
Drilling in 2004 showed that the mineralization was continuous between the former Satellite 
Zone and the old Outer Core model. Therefore, a new grade shell termed the 'East Zone 
Extension' was modeled based on an approximate 0.2% Cu cutoff and was used as a hard 
boundary in the resource estimation. This area is cut by a northeast-trending structure referred to 
as the TG Fault which was intersected by the 2004 drilling.  Since two drill holes intersected 
continuous mineralization within and adjacent to this fault, it was not used as a hard boundary 
within the zone. 
 
The East Zone Extension does contain significant drill intercepts in excess of 0.5% Cu but there 
is no clear division between high and lower grade material as is evident in the East Zone core 
area. There is very limited drill information in this area below the 1250 metre level and the 
boundaries of the grade shell below this level were assumed to be vertical. 
 
No new drilling or interpretation was carried out on the Far West and Gully zones so the 
geologic models and resource estimates in these areas remains unchanged.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Red-Chris copper-gold deposit has genetic characteristics of both the alkalic and calc-alkalic 
suites of volcanic porphyry copper deposits in the Canadian Cordillera. The following table, 
modified after Schink, (1977) and Ash et al., (1995), illustrates these ambiguities.

The classification of the Red-Chris deposit, as to its genetic porphyry copper suite, remains the 
subject of debate. Newell and Peatfield, (1995) tend to place it in the alkalic suite of volcanic 
porphyry copper deposits and conclude that the calc-alkalic features are the result of secondary 
processes, such as the influence of oceanic waters on the hydrothermal fluids. 
 
 
9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
Pyrite, chalcopyrite and lesser bornite are the principal sulphide minerals of the Red-Chris 
deposit. Minor covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and molybdenite, sphalerite and galena 
occur locally in trace amounts. Gold, second in economic importance to copper, occurs as 
electrum spatially- and genetically-associated with the copper mineralization. Gold was observed 
in two samples by T. Fraser (Ash et al., 1994). Silver values are geochemically significant but 
are of minor economic importance. 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 50 
December 16, 2004 

Pyrite occurs commonly as very fine- to fine-grained, anhedral to euhedral disseminations or 
fracture fillings. Within the mineralized zones it is commonly poikilitic with numerous copper 
sulphide and iron oxide inclusions, while elsewhere the inclusions are commonly sericite and 
dolomite. The pyrite content usually varies disproportionately with quartz vein stockworks. It 
ranges from 5 to 15 percent in Late Phase rocks, 2 to 4 percent in Main Phase rocks with very 
weak to weak quartz veining, and often less than 1 to 2 percent in well mineralized Main Phase 
rocks with moderate to intense quartz stockworks. Pyrite (± chalcopyrite) veins cut quartz vein 
stockworks, and are often associated with narrow hematite veinlets. The partial replacement of 
mafic phenocrysts and, to a lesser degree, plagioclase phenocrysts is occasionally seen. Pyrite 
occurs in the Dynamite Hill Volcanics up to 100 to 150 m from the intrusive contact, and occurs 
as disseminations and fracture fillings in the sedimentary country rocks up to 300 metres from 
the Red stock north of the Far West Zone. 
 
Chalcopyrite is most abundant in the quartz-sulphide vein stockworks and 
quartz-sericite-ankerite alteration selvages. Its content is roughly proportional to the intensity of 
quartz vein stockwork except in the Gully and Far West zones. Beyond the quartz stockwork 
zones chalcopyrite occurs as disseminations, along fractures often associated with pyrite veinlets, 
and rarely as veinlets. In quartz veins it occurs as disseminations, aggregates, and fracture 
coatings and fillings both parallel to and crosscutting the quartz veins. Where quartz-sulphide 
vein stockwork intensity diminishes elevated copper grades remain constant due to the presence 
of fine-grained disseminated chalcopyrite which is associated with pyrite. 
 
Bornite is most common as fracture fillings and fine-grained (0.5 mm) disseminations in the 
quartz-sulphide vein stockwork zones of the East Zone but it also occurs as fine-grained 
disseminations in the highly altered Main Phase rocks of the eastern Main Zone. Bornite also 
occurs in the Gully Zone, but is less abundant than in the Red-Chris deposit. Within quartz 
stockwork veins bornite occurs as disseminations and microveinlets both within their cores and 
as crosscutting veins. Bornite is also intimately associated with disseminations, fracture fillings 
and coatings of specular hematite, and with specular hematite aggregates. This association makes 
visual grade estimates difficult and invariably low. 
 
Magnetite and hematite are most commonly associated with mineralized quartz stockwork zones 
and plagioclase-hornblende-biotite dykes where they may represent up to 10 modal percent. 
They usually occur as fine-grained disseminations in the veins and host rocks but they also occur 
as magnetite-hematite veinlets and quartz-magnetite veinlets. Magnetite typically forms fine, 
hexagonal grains which are usually replaced by specular and earthy hematite. 
 
The known native gold or electrum mineralization is all microscopic. Preliminary thin section 
and SEM studies of the quartz-sulphide stockwork vein material discovered two grains of gold 
intimately associated with copper mineralization (Ash et al., 1994). One subrounded gold grain 
occurs within a bornite grain hosted by a quartz vein and another gold grain occurs interstitially 
with a chalcopyrite and bornite-bearing quartz vein. 
 
Copper to gold grade ratios (i.e. % Cu to gpt. Au) were plotted for several drill holes in the 
Red-Chris deposit. The results indicate that the gold-bearing mineralization is intimately 
associated with the copper mineralization. Copper to gold grade ratios do vary laterally in a

westward direction from 1:0.8 within the Red-Chris deposit, to 1:2 or 1:2.5 within the Gully 
Zone, and to 1:3 or locally 1:4 within the Far West Zone. This westward transition coincides 
with increased pyritization, decreased bornite versus chalcopyrite mineralization, and the 
dominance of phyllic versus potassic-phyllic alteration of the host rocks. Thus, it appears that the 
alteration and mineralization was 'telescoped' along the axis of the Red stock in a westward 
direction rather than being equidimensional like a stereotypical porphyry copper-gold deposit. 
 
Prominent limonitic gossans occur within the East and West Gully drainages and along their 
steep slopes. However, in areas of low relief, such as over the Red-Chris deposit, weak limonite 
only extends 1 or 2 metres beneath the bedrock surface. The gravel till layer overlying the 
bedrock is often very limonitic or ferrocrete. Thus, it appears that Recent glaciation has removed 
any of the supergene mineralization that might have existed over the Red-Chris deposit. 
However, Great Plains Development reportedly intersected supergene chalcocite mineralization 
in shallow drilling near the headwaters of the East Gully drainage, and recent drilling in the 
vicinity has confirmed the possibility of chalcocite mineralization in near-surface fractures 
within the oxidized layer. Chalcocite occurs along with malachite, azurite and manganese oxides 
in this oxidized zone. It is possible that there may be other graben-like structures elsewhere 
within the property where supergene copper mineralization might have been preserved after 
continental and alpine glaciation. 
 
 
10.0 EXPLORATION 
 
The 2004 field exploration program was designed to infill previous work.  Complete details are 
discussed in Section 6 History and Section 11 Drilling.  
 
 
11.0 DRILLING 
 
11.1 Exploration Drilling 
 
11.1.1   Pre 2003 Drilling 
 
Prior to 2003, there have been three major drilling campaigns conducted on the property; the 
percussion and diamond drilling undertaken by Texasgulf in the 1970's and the two diamond 
drilling programs conducted by American Bullion Minerals in 1994 and 1995. In addition to 
these major campaigns, there has been a number of much smaller drilling programs undertaken 
by various earlier operators. Blanchflower et al., (2002) have described the previous drilling 
programs as follows: 
 
Prior to American Bullion Minerals' ownership in 1994, the Red-Chris property had been drilled 
by: 
 

1 Conwest Exploration Limited, 1956 - several short x-ray diamond drill holes; 
2 Great Plains Development Company of Canada, Ltd., 1970- 2 diamond drill holes; 1972 - 

eight diamond drill holes totalling 922 metres; 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 52 
December 16, 2004 

3 Ecstall Mining Limited, 1973 - 14 percussion drill holes totalling 914 metres; and 
4 Texasgulf Canada Limited (Texasgulf Inc.) 1974-1976 - 67 diamond drill holes (12,284 

m) and 30 percussion drill holes (2,261 m); 1978 and 1980 - 7 diamond drill holes 
totalling 1,017 m). 

 
Due to poor documentation, the pre-1973 drill holes could not be located accurately. Thus, the 
total pre-1994 drilling which could be located is as follows (Rebagliati, 1994).

In 1994, American Bullion Minerals Ltd. contracted J. T. Thomas Diamond Drilling Ltd. of 
Smithers, British Columbia to provide equipment and personnel capable of completing a 
minimum of 15,000 metres of HQ- and/or NQ-core diamond drilling. The drill rigs, rods, and 
support equipment were all mobilized to the property in June via the tote trail from the Coyote 
Creek-Ealue Lake road. A Caterpillar D6E bulldozer and a Caterpillar 210B excavator were 
utilized to tow the rigs and equipment to the property. They were later used to excavate drill 
sites, access roads and construction sites, and reclaim those surface disturbances and many of the 
open trenches dating back to the early 1970's.  
 
Due to encouraging drilling results, the diamond drilling contract was extended in early October. 
Thus, fifty-eight (58) drill holes were completed during the 1994 exploration program, totalling 
21,417.08 metres or 70,266 feet. The first 1994 hole was labelled '75' following the last 
Texasgulf drill hole which was labelled '74'. Therefore, the 1994 drill holes are numbered 
consecutively from 75 to 132; all with a '94-' prefix. 
 
Two Longyear skid-mounted, unitized drilling rigs, namely a 'Super 38' and a '44', were used for 
the entire drilling campaign. The early season drilling recovered HQ-core but after identifying 
substantial copper-gold mineralization beneath the 1,200 m elevation all subsequent holes were 
drilled deeper; often beyond the limits of a Longyear 'Super 38' drill rig to recover HQ-size core. 
Consequently, several of those holes that were drilled by this rig had to be reduced to NQ-size 
core for completion. Due to the prevailing marshy ground conditions, a Hughes 500D helicopter 
was used extensively to service the drilling rigs, move drilling personnel, and move the drill core 
to the logging and sampling site. At the end of the 1994 drilling campaign, all of the heavy 
equipment was stored on site for the next field season. 
 
The 1995 diamond drilling commenced on May 5th and was completed on November 8th, 1995. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 53 
December 16, 2004 

One hundred and twelve (112) HQ- and/or NQ-core exploratory diamond drill holes (36,770.46 
m or 120,638 ft.) and three (3) BQTK-core geotechnical diamond drill holes (59.44 m or 195 ft.) 
were completed during this period, totalling 36,830.00 metres or 120,833 feet. The first 1995 
hole was labelled '133' following the last 1994 drill hole which was labelled '132'. Therefore, 
the 1995 exploratory drill holes are numbered consecutively from 133 to 244, and the three 
geotechnical drill holes were labelled BH 95-1 to -3. 
 
The 1995 diamond drilling program successfully discovered copper-gold mineralization across 
the width of the Red stock and over a 400-metre strike length west of the known Red-Chris 
deposit. Exploration drilling over a 2-kilometre strike length, west of the deposit, also discovered 
significant copper-gold mineralization underlying the Gully and Far West exploration targets 
which were identified in 1994. 
 
Most of the 1995 diamond drilling in the Main and East zones of the Red-Chris deposit was 
concentrated along the northern, southern, and western margins of the deposit. In 1994, diamond 
drilling had shown that the Main and East zones are not discretely mineralized bodies but 
comprise a continuous zone of copper-gold mineralization that has been locally intruded by 
post-mineral dykes and slightly displaced by younger faulting. In 1995, diamond drilling tested 
the Red-Chris deposit from the southern to northern contacts of the Red stock and for more than 
500 metres along the western strike extension of the Main Zone. It also tested the vertical 
continuity of the mineralization to a depth of over 750 metres. 
 
Diamond drilling along the southern margins of the Red stock intersected copper-gold 
mineralization south of the previously-assumed limits of the Red-Chris deposit. More 
importantly, the copper (%) to gold (g/t) grade ratios of this mineralization varied locally from 
the deposit average of 1:0.8 to ratios of 1:1 or 1:2. These results indicate that there was probably 
a later structurally-controlled gold-bearing mineralizing event superimposed on the earlier 
more-pervasive copper-gold mineralization. Furthermore, this event was probably related to 
reactivation of the South Boundary fault structure since the higher grade gold-bearing 
mineralization appears to be spatially-related to this structure. 
 
Copper-gold mineralization occurs throughout the Red stock but appears to decrease in grade 
near the northern intrusive contact of the stock; although this margin is still only sparsely tested 
along its strike length. There appears to be a zone of either poorly mineralized Main Phase or 
barren Late Phase plutonic rocks between the Red-Chris deposit and the intrusive contact of the 
stock with the Late Triassic Dynamite Hill volcanic strata. The width of this poorly-mineralized 
margin appears to vary from 50 to more than 100 metres and may be related to the proximity and 
distribution of pre-mineral fault structures along the axis of the stock. It is also noteworthy that 
propylitically-altered volcanics only occur over a very narrow width, usually less than 100 
metres, along the northern margins of the intrusive contact. Beyond this narrow band the 
Dynamite Hill volcanic strata are only regionally metamorphosed to lower green schist facies 
and host less than one percent pyrite. Such a narrow alteration band indicates that the structural 
features controlling the alteration and mineralization of the Red-Chris deposit were largely 
restricted to the axis of the stock and did not pervade the older volcanic strata to the north. 
 
One of the most important results of the 1995 diamond drilling program was the discovery of the 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 54 
December 16, 2004 

western extension of the Red-Chris deposit. Diamond drilling by Texasgulf had indicated that the 
Main Zone might be truncated at a north-northwesterly fault structure situated near grid line 
49800 East. Two 1994 drill holes (i.e. 94-123 and 94-124) tested for buried mineralization near 
this fault structure and found that the mineralization might have been down-dropped and 
displaced laterally by the fault structure. Further drilling was recommended west of this structure 
to test for mineralization trending northwesterly from the Main Zone (Blanchflower, 1995). This 
drilling discovered that the western mineralization of the Red-Chris deposit probably splits into 
two relatively-distinct bodies west of the fault structure and that these bodies, although displaced 
by westside-down, strike-slip faulting, do continue to at least grid line 49550 East. At this grid 
easting the mineralization is beneath grid northings 99900 and 99700, and buried from 300 to 
350 metres beneath the surface. This deep copper-gold mineralization may not be readily 
amenable to open pit mining but the intervening nearer-surface mineralization increased the 
geological resources of the Red-Chris deposit (see Giroux, 1996). 
 
Drill holes 95-140 and 95-145 were drilled in the East Zone to test the vertical continuity of its 
higher grade copper-gold mineralization. Drill hole 95-140 was collared at grid coordinates 
100600 North by 50750 East and was finally terminated at a length of 812.90 metres or 
approximately 750 metres vertically beneath the surface. This hole intersected 292.61 metres of 
mineralization grading 0.573 percent copper and 0.565 g/t. gold from 520.29 to 812.90 metres, 
and the last 3.05-metre section of drill core returned a grade of 0.496 percent copper and 0.59 g/t 
gold. Drill hole 95-145, located 100 metres due east of DDH 95-140, was terminated at a length 
of 599.54 metres and it intersected 0.77 percent copper and 0.80 g/t gold over 140.2 metres from 
360 to 480 metres vertically beneath the surface. These results show that the copper-gold 
mineralization of the deposit occurs over significant vertical distances, and that the depth of the 
mineralization remains to be determined. 
 
Current drilling results indicate that there are two near-surface core zones within the Main and 
East zones of the Red-Chris deposit that grade greater than 0.6 percent copper and 0.6 g/t. gold 
and are amenable for 'starter' open pit mining. These zones are separated and surrounded by a 
much larger, less well delineated zone of greater than 0.25 percent copper and 0.2 g/t. gold 
mineralization. The strike length of the Red-Chris deposit, comprising both the Main and East 
zones, is now in the order of 1.7 kilometres with widths ranging from 250 to 700 metres or more 
(see Figure 10).

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 56 
December 16, 2004 

The Gully Zone is a 700-metre long by 400-metre wide coincident geochemical and geophysical 
anomalies centred between the East and West Gully drainages. Exploration drilling discovered 
two east-west trending, subvertical zones of significant copper-gold mineralization. The northern 
zone is centred at grid coordinates 99800 North by 49000 East, and the southern zone is centred 
at 99200 North by 49000 East. Both zones, although they remain open laterally and vertically, 
have been tested by widely-spaced drilling over strike distances of 400 to 500 metres and widths 
from 200 to 300 metres. 
 
The southern portion of the Gully Zone hosts a subvertical zone of copper-gold mineralization 
with a tested strike length of 500 metres and widths over 300 metres. Drill intercepts within this 
zone typically are more than 0.3 percent copper and 0.3 g/t gold over lengths of 15 to more than 
300 metres. There are also exceptionally high grade sections within this mineralized zone, such 
as the one intercepted by DDH 95-168, with grades of 1.486 percent copper and 3.266 g/t. gold 
over 18.29 metres. 
 
The northern portion of the Gully Zone hosts several narrower subvertical zones of copper-gold 
mineralization with grades generally ranging up from 0.15 to 0.40 percent copper but with 
significant associated gold values, usually grading 0.20 to 0.40 g/t gold. Due to the 
widely-spaced drilling, the distribution and delineation of this mineralization remains to be 
tested. 
 
Aside from the importance of its discovery, it is important to note that the Gully Zone 
mineralization generally occurs with copper to gold grade ratios averaging from 1:1.5 to 1:2.5 
(i.e. percent copper to grams gold per tonne); and becomes more pyritic along the western strike 
extensions of the Red stock.  
 
The Far West Zone is a 600-metre by 600-metre coincident geochemical and geophysical 
exploration target centred at grid coordinates 99900 North by 48400 East. It was tested with 
widely-spaced drill holes directed at the centre of a strong high chargeability-low, resistivity 
geophysical anomaly. These holes intersected gold-rich pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization in two 
subvertical, easterly trending structures centred at 99800 North by 48500 East. Assay results 
indicate that the copper to gold grade ratios are in the order of 1:3 with copper grades typically 
ranging from 0.2 to 0.35 percent and gold values ranging from to 0.6 to 0.75 g/t. Considerably 
more drilling will have to be conducted within this zone to delineate the mineralized sections and 
their trends. 
 
11.1.2 2003 Drilling Program 

 
In September 2003, Red Chris Development Corporation commenced drilling on the Red Chris 
project using equipment and personnel supplied by Hy-Tech Drilling Ltd. of Smithers, British 
Columbia. Hy-Tech initially supplied two Hy-Tech 5000 drills, which along with their drill rods 
and support equipment, were mobilized to the property in the first week of September. A 
Caterpillar D6D bulldozer was used to tow the drilling rigs and rod sloops from the staging site 
on the Ealue Lake Road up the Coyote Creek-Red Chris property tote trail. A third HY-Tech 
4000 drilling rig was mobilized to the property September 22nd to speed up the drilling progress 
and free up a rig for geotechnical drilling. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 57 
December 16, 2004 

 
Fuel, extra rods, consumables, and ancillary drilling equipment were flown by helicopter from 
the Tatogga Lake Resort staging area to the property. All project personnel, camp support, fuel, 
and other project supplies were flown to the Red Chris camp using a Bell 206 helicopter supplied 
by Pacific Western Helicopters Ltd. of Prince George, B.C. The helicopter was used extensively 
to service the drilling rigs and transport drill core to the core logging and sampling site due to the 
poor road conditions caused by marshy ground and adverse weather during the project. The 
helicopter was based in camp for convenience and project safety requirements. 
 
The drills, which were skid mounted, were moved from site to site using the D6D bulldozer 
and/or a tracked Caterpillar 320C excavator. The excavator was also utilized for positioning the 
drills, digging drill sumps, and reclaiming site and access surface disturbances. The light, 
helicopter-portable Hy-Tech drills were normally pulled into position without site or access 
construction, thereby minimizing surface disturbances. 
 
The drill contractor, Hy-Tech Drilling, was responsible for all down-hole surveys. Two systems 
were used, with the Reflex digital magnetic instrument being the primary survey system and the 
Accushot photo system as a backup in case of Reflex breakdown or unavailability. Twenty four 
of the 235 down-hole surveys were deemed unacceptable due to incorrect azimuth readings and 
were rejected. Blocked bits and operator error were responsible for most survey failures. 
 
The proposed drill hole sites were surveyed in by McElhanney Consulting Services Ltd. using a 
total station instrument and established property grid controls. The final drill hole collar locations 
were surveyed by McElhanney using both a total station and a survey quality Global Positioning 
System (GPS). The Plant Site and Waste Dump Site geotechnical drill holes were also surveyed 
by GPS. 
 
The 2003 drilling campaign commenced September 7th and finished November 7th.  A total of 49 
holes totalling 16,591 metres were drilled into both the East and Main Zones. This drilling 
included nine geotechnical, orientated core holes totalling 2,499 metres. The geotechnical holes, 
while drilled primarily for pit slope design purposes, also provided assay information that was 
used in the new resource calculations. The core size for the orientated holes was NQ3 although 
the upper portions of some holes were cored using HQ in order to install 2 inch groundwater 
monitoring wells. The geotechnical drilling was supervised by personnel from Knight Piésold 
Consulting and the geological logging and sampling by RCDCs' personnel. 
 
Three of the 49 Red Chris drill holes totalling 793.44 metres were drilled vertically using HQ 
sized core to provide material for metallurgical grinding tests. Hole 03-256A (hole 03-256 was 
lost at 57.16m) was drilled in the core of the East Zone and Hole 03-283 in the centre of the 
Main Zone. A 2 inch groundwater monitoring well was installed in the latter hole. The two holes 
were geologically logged and a 15 cm whole core sample was taken from each assay interval for 
metallurgical testing. The remaining core was then split and the half-cores sent in for assay. The 
analytical results were used as the basis for the January 19th, 2004 resource update. 
 
The remaining NQ2 sized diamond drill holes were sited to in-fill drilling gaps in the Main and 
East Zones produced by the 1972 to 1995 drilling campaigns. The first hole in the 2003 program 
was labelled DDH 03-248 and follows consecutively from the last 1995 exploratory drill hole

December 16, 2004 

05-244 plus the three BQTK-core geotechnical diamond drill holes BH 95-1 to -3. The last hole 
drilled in the 2003 program was hole DDH 03-295. 
 
11.1.3  2004 Drilling Program 
 
The 2004 drilling program was a similar one to that conducted the previous year.  During the 
period June 10 to August 8, 2004, Red Chris Development Corporation completed 25 diamond 
drill holes with an aggregate length of 6,927.6m on the Red Chris property.   Five of these holes 
were condemnation drilling on the site of the proposed open pit waste dump, four holes were 
drilled for rock mechanics studies, and the remaining sixteen holes were infill drill holes 
designed to increase the quantity and quality of resources within the proposed pit prior to a final 
feasibility study. 
 
The condemnation drilling tested an induced polarization anomaly that lies to the east of the 
open pit.  Four earlier holes into this anomaly failed to intersect copper mineralization, and only 
traces of chalcopyrite were intersected in the 2004 drilling.  The lack of quartz veining and 
significant alteration suggests that the area is not mineralized. 
 
One new mineral, fluorite, was noted in logging core from infill drilling in the southwest part of 
the Main Zone.  It occurred in two locations in drill hole 04-304 as coarse grained clumps of 
crystals associated with gypsum veining.  The gypsum veins are later than all other veining in the 
deposit and therefore the fluorite probably has no direct connection with the copper and gold 
mineralization.  
 
The sample quality control system used was the same as that established for the 2003 work on 
this property. 
 
11.2 Geotechnical Drilling 
 
The purpose of the geotechnical drilling was to formulate the design parameters for the proposed 
pit slopes, Plant Site foundations, Waste Dump, Low Grade Ore Pile, and the Tailings Storage 
Facility prior to the commencement of a feasibility study on the Red Chris project. Knight 
Piésold Ltd, under contract to Red Chris Development Company Ltd. designed, supervised and 
documented the various geotechnical programs. 
 
In the 2003 fall drilling program, nine geotechnical, orientated, inclined core holes totalling 
2,499 metres were drilled within the proposed pits centred on the East and Main zones of the Red 
Chris copper-gold porphyry deposit. This geotechnical drilling was designed to: 
 

1 fully log the core for geotechnical properties; 
2 determine the locations of the contacts between the rock units; 
3 determine the frequency, locations, and orientations of the key structural discontinuities 

in the rock units; 
4 obtain samples for field and laboratory shear and strength testing; 
5 carry out in-situ packer (Lugeon) permeability tests; 
6 install 1" standpipe piezometers and 2" groundwater monitoring wells in selected holes; 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 59 
December 16, 2004 

 
The holes were strategically located and orientated to intersect the anticipated pit walls at 
different orientations and in different rock units. As these holes were also geologically logged 
and sampled by RCDC personnel they are numbered within the DDH 03 series of holes and were 
sent for assay following the routine sample shipment and analytical procedures implemented by 
RCDC. 
 
Knight Piésold Ltd also designed and supervised geotechnical drilling programs in the areas of 
the proposed Waste Dump Site, Plant Site, and Tailings storage Facility. 
 
The geotechnical investigation at the proposed Waste Dump site involved drilling two shallow 
(approximately 35 metres in total) inclined drill holes and excavating 6 test pits in an area 
underlain by volcanics belonging to the Middle to Upper Triassic Stuhini Group. The HQ size 
drill holes were drilled by a HY-Tech 5000 rig that was pulled over snow to the drill sites. Both 
drill holes were subsequently equipped with a 2" groundwater monitoring well. The core was 
geologically logged and photographed but not sampled. The geotechnical core is stored in racks 
adjacent to the core logging facility. 
 
On November 5th an inclined condemnation drill hole (03-WS-3) was drilled to 18.3 metres 
within the proposed north east limits of the Waste Dump site. A demobilizating Hy-Tech 5000 
drill rig drilled this hole under the supervision of the author. The hole encountered volcanics 
belonging to the Middle to Upper Triassic Stuhini Group under a thin veneer of overburden. On 
November 8th the author supervised the digging, using the "Cat" 320C excavator, of three 
condemnation test pits along the southeast margin of the proposed Waste Dump site. Two of the 
pits encountered Stuhini Group volcanic sediments and the third bottomed in glacial fluvial sand. 
 
The Knight Piésold-supervised geotechnical program at the proposed Plant Site included the 
drilling of two shallow vertical drill holes (approximately 35 metres in total) with one of HQ size 
to accommodate a 2" groundwater monitoring well and the other NQ2 size to accommodate a 1" 
standpipe piezometer. Two test pits, in shallow overburden, were also excavated at the Plant Site. 
The test pits and drill holes intersected Middle Jurassic, Ashman Formation finely bedded 
siltstones intercalated with a few thin beds of chert-pebble conglomerate. The overburden depths 
were from 1 to 4 metres in the proposed Plant Site. 
 
On October 15th a Hy-tech 3000 light weight, helicopter portable drill rig was flown to the site of 
the proposed Tailings Storage Facility. Four geotechnical HQ3 size diamond drill holes, totalling 
210 metres, were advanced in deep overburden at sites chosen by Knight Piésold. Soil samples 
were recovered using a HQ3 split inner tube and minimal water pressure. None of the holes 
encountered bedrock (deepest hole 77.1 metres). Two 2" groundwater monitoring wells and two 
1" standpipe piezometers were placed into the four geotechnical holes. In addition, a total of 16 
test pits were excavated by the CAT 320C hydraulic excavator into the upper layers of 
overburden at selected locations at the site of the Tailings Storage Facility.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD, APPROACH, and SECURITY 
 
12.1     Sampling Method, Approach and Security – pre 2003 

(taken from Blanchflower et al., (Nov. 18, 2002)). 
 
All of the 1994 and 1995 diamond drill core was properly handled, processed, logged and 
sampled on site (Blanchflower, 1995 and 1996). After the drill core had been delivered by 
helicopter to the logging and sampling facility its footage markers were converted to metric 
measurements and each box was properly labelled with its respective hole number, box number 
and drilling length interval. The core was then logged in detail by qualified geologists, employed 
by American Bullion Minerals Ltd., utilizing a 'matrix' coding log form. Geological data were 
then input into a computerized database for both on-site documentation and computer-assisted 
drafting (CAD). Core recovery, rock quality and specific gravity measurements were also logged 
and recorded. Core recoveries were generally good (>90%) to excellent (98 - 100%); except in 
extremely fractured near-surface rock or wider fault structures. Specific gravity measurements 
were recorded at 8-metre intervals. All the drill core was photographed prior to sampling. 
 
Following the logging procedures, the drill core was split in half lengthwise using a Longyear 
manual splitter and sampled between drilling length blocks; usually at 3.05-metre or 10-foot 
intervals. A duplicate sample of every twentieth sample was inserted into the sampling sequence 
as a 'blind' check-assay sample duplicate. All of the samples were then labelled, double-bagged 
and flown to a secure landing and collection site at Tatogga Lake Resort, situated on Highway 
37. There, the samples were hand-loaded into a secure 'box' van for shipping to Min-En 
Laboratories' preparation facility in Smithers, British Columbia. The remaining one-half of the 
split core is stored at the core logging and storage facilities on the property. 
 
12.2   Sampling Method, Approach and Security –2003 drilling 
 
The drill core from the fall 2003 diamond drilling program was handled, logged, photographed, 
and sampled at the Red Chris drill camp. Most of the drill core was transported, from the drill 
sites to the core logging facilities, by helicopter due to the poor condition of the marshy roads 
and the need to prevent undue ground access disturbances. At the logging and sampling building, 
the core was handled and logged by qualified geologists. First core box footage markers were 
converted to metric, then the boxes were labelled with hole number, box number, and the 
contained core interval. The core recoveries and rock-quotient-density measurements (RQD) 
were done concurrently with the labelling. Qualified geologists, on contract to Red Chris 
Development Company, then geologically logged the drill core for rock type, alteration, 
structure, and mineralization. The logging forms were similar to those used by American Bullion 
in the 1995 drill program. The geologists then laid out the sample intervals with assigned assay 
tags, inserted the standards, and digitally photographed the core in four box groups. 
 
The length of the sampled interval depended upon geological rock contacts, core size, and 
changes in mineral intensity, but generally averaged 3 metres with NQ2 core and 2 metres with 
HQ. As core recovery generally approached 95 to 100% there were no problems with recovery 
that could materially impact the accuracy or reliability of the sampling method. To check that the 
longitudinal half splitting of the drill core could produce an unbiased sample, 32 half-core assay 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 61 
December 16, 2004 

intervals from archived core drilled in the East Zone and 30 half-core intervals from the Main 
Zone were collected, analysed, and the results compared with the original submitted half of the 
core. The results, which indicated a close comparison, are discussed in the quality control section 
of this technical report by A.J. Sinclair, P. Eng. 
 
During the core logging, RCDC geologists collected, for specific gravity testing, 134, 15 cm long 
core samples representing the various Red Chris rock types. The samples were wrapped and 
shipped in plastic buckets to the University of British Columbia Mining and Mineral Process 
Engineering Group for laboratory testing. Knight Piésold Ltd provided oversight and input into 
the specific gravity testing. 
 
The standards (high copper, medium, low, and blanks) were inserted at every twentieth sample 
interval by the logging geologist. After being photographed with the tagged assay intervals, the 
core was split in half lengthwise using a Longyear manual splitter and half the sample, between 
the assay interval tags, was placed in labelled, tagged, double-bagged plastic sample bags. Up to 
5 consecutively numbered sample bags were then placed in a white numbered and labelled "rice 
sack." The consecutively numbered "rice sacks" were then sealed with a randomly numbered 
security tag and were flown by helicopter in sling loads of 10 to a secure landing site at Tatogga 
Lake Resort which is located on Highway 37. 
 
At Tatogga Lake, an RCDC contractor took possession of the samples, palletized each sling load, 
wrapped them in shrink-wrap, numbered the pallets and moved the pallets into a locked 20 foot 
steel container using a Bobcat. Twice a week, Bandstra Trucking of Smithers would pick up the 
pallets, under the supervision of a RCDC representative, and ship the samples, in a closed truck, 
directly, via Smithers, to International Plasma Labs in Vancouver. The assay lab recorded the 
number and arrival time of the sample shipment and noted the security tag numbers. The total 
weight of samples shipped to IPL was greater than 45 tonnes. The remaining half core samples 
are stored in their labelled core boxes in newly constructed core storage racks located on the Red 
Chris property. 
 
12.3    Sampling Method, Approach and Security –2004 drilling 
 
The sampling method, approach and security procedures for the 2004 drilling program were 
identical in all respects to that outlined under the 2003 program. 
 
 
13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION and ANALYSES 
 
13.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses –pre 2003 

(taken from Blanchflower et al., (Nov. 18, 2002)). 
 
The Red-Chris exploration database (1974 to 1995 diamond drilling results) includes geological, 
geotechnical, geochemical and assay data for 244 diamond drill holes and 3 geotechnical bore 
holes (71,531.26 m). The database does not include any of the percussion drilling data because of 
poor documentation and undefined sampling procedures. The database contains: 4,453 
geological observations, 22,731 diamond drill core samples assayed for copper (%) and gold

(grams per tonne), 6,934 specific gravity measurements, 19,669 rock quality observations, 2,458 
ICP analyses, and 546 soil geochemical sample results. 
 
A total of 5,058 copper assays were documented from the pre-1994 diamond drilling; however, 
1,000 samples were not assayed for gold and many of the 1,500 gold assays were conducted on 
composite samples with intervals up to 15 m in length. Copper values from the various drilling 
programs range from less than 0.01 to 6.60 percent, and gold values ranged from 0.017 gram per 
tonne to 8.228 grams per tonne. Sixty-eight samples were assayed for silver and the values range 
from 0.686 to 10.286 g/t (Rebagliati, 1994). 
 
A total of 19,055 diamond drill core samples were shipped to Min-En Laboratories in Smithers 
during the 1994 and 1995 exploration programs. Of this total, 17,031 drill core samples were 
assayed for both copper and gold, and copper and gold geochemical analyses were conducted on 
the remaining 2,024 drill core samples where no obvious copper mineralization was visible, such 
as within wide post-mineral dykes or Bowser Lake Group strata. However, all of the bedrock 
diamond drill core was either assayed or analyzed. 
 
In Smithers, Min-En Laboratories' personnel dried each sample at 60 o C. before crushing it to 
minus 1/4 inch. The crushed sample was then reduced to minus 1/8 inch size by a secondary roll 
crusher. The whole sample was then split on a Jones Riffle to a statistically-representative 
300-gram sample pulp. This sample pulp was then pulverized in a ring pulverizer to 95 percent 
minus 150 mesh, rolled and bagged. All of the sample pulps were then shipped to the Min-En 
Laboratories facility in Vancouver, British Columbia for assay. The remaining coarse rejects 
from the Jones Riffle were bagged, catalogued and stored in a J. T. Thomas Diamond Drilling 
warehouse at Smithers, British Columbia. 
 
All of the drill core sample pulps were assayed or analyzed initially for their copper and gold 
values. Min-En Laboratories' assay procedures for copper use a 0.500 to 2.00 gram sub-sample 
which is weighed from the sample pulp for analysis. Each batch of 70 assays has a natural 
standard and a reagent blank included. The samples are digested using a HNO3 - KClO3 mixture 
and when the reaction subsides, HCl is added before it is placed on a hotplate to digest. After 
digestion is complete the flasks are cooled, diluted to volume and mixed. The resulting solutions 
are analyzed on an atomic absorption spectrometer using the appropriate standard sets. The 
natural standard digested along with this set must be within 2 standard deviations of its known or 
the whole set is re-assayed. If any of the assays are more than 1 percent copper they are 
re-assayed at a lower weight, and 10 percent of the submitted samples are assayed in duplicate 
(Min-En Laboratories, 1995). During the 1994 and 1995 programs, 17,031 drill core samples, 
2,143 'blind' duplicate samples and 3,252 assay laboratory standards (i.e. 813 samples of each of 
the AM-A, AM-B, STD and BLK laboratory standards) were assayed for copper. The 'blind' 
duplicate samples were inserted into the sample sequence by the field geologists. 
 
The remaining 2,024 drill core samples that were geochemically analysed for copper were 
treated differently. After the samples were dried at 65o C., they were crushed by a jaw crusher 
and pulverized by a ceramic-plated pulverizer or ring mill pulverizer  The resultant sample was 
rolled and sieved to obtain a minus 80-mesh pulp for analysis. A 0.5 gram sub-sample was 
digested for 2 hours with an aqua regia mixture and, after cooling, the solution was diluted to

December 16, 2004 

standard volume. The resultant solution was then analyzed for its copper content by atomic 
absorption methods. The copper values are quoted as parts per million (ppm). 
 
Gold fire assays were conducted on 17,031 drill core samples and 2,143 'blind' duplicate 
samples. All gold fire assay procedures at Min-En Laboratories were conducted on one assay ton 
sample weights. The sub-samples were fluxed and a silver inquart was added and mixed. These 
sub-samples were fluxed in batches of 24 assays with a natural standard and a blank. This batch 
of 26 assays were carried through the whole procedure as described. After cupellation the 
precious metal beads were transferred into new glassware, dissolved with aqua regia solution, 
and diluted to volume and mixed. The resulting solutions were analyzed on an atomic absorption 
spectrometer using a suitable standard set. The natural standard fused along with this set must be 
within 2 standard deviations of its known or the whole set is re-assayed. Likewise, the blank 
assay must be less than 0.015 g/t. The top 10 percent of all assays per printed page were 
rechecked and reported along with the standard and blank. Gold values are reported in grams per 
tonne (g/t) with a detection limit of 0.02 g/t. 
 
The remaining 2,024 drill core samples were geochemically analysed for their gold values. A 
10.0-gram portion from each rock sub-sample was weighed and placed into a porcelain crucible, 
and cindered at 800o C. for 3 hours. All of the sub-samples were then transferred to beakers and 
digested using aqua regia, diluted to volume and mixed. Seventy-five percent of each of the 
diluted samples was further oxidized, treated and extracted for gold analyses using methyl 
iso-butyl ketone (MIBK). The MIBK solutions were then analyzed by an atomic absorption 
spectrometer (A.A.) using a suitable standard set and the values of gold (Au) were then reported. 
Gold values are reported in parts per billion (ppb) with a detection limit of 1 ppb. 
 
After the copper and gold assay results were reported by Min-En Laboratories, 762 selected 
sample pulps were delivered to Chemex Labs Ltd. in North Vancouver, British Columbia for 
copper and gold check-assaying. These sample pulps were re-assayed using similar procedures 
as those undertaken at Min-En Laboratories. American Bullion Minerals Ltd. contracted Barry 
W. Smee, of Smee & Associates Consulting Ltd. in Vancouver, British Columbia, to prepare a 
report on the analytical quality of the assay data using the assay pairs (Smee, 1995 and 1996). 
 
At monthly intervals throughout the 1994 and 1995 exploration programs every fifth and tenth 
drill core sample, or 2,458 samples, were analyzed for their 31-element geochemistry using 
inductively coupled plasma (I.C.P.) analysis techniques at Min-En Laboratories in North 
Vancouver, British Columbia. The purpose of these analyses was to determine if there were any 
other unrecognized economic or detrimental metals associated with the known copper-gold 
mineralization. Thus, 2,458 samples were analysed for: silver (Ag), aluminium (Al),arsenic (As), 
boron (B), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), bismuth (Bi), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), 
copper (Cu), iron (Fe), potassium (K), lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), 
molybdenum (Mo), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), 
strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), tin (Sn), 
tungsten (W) and chrome (Cr). 
 
The Min-En Laboratories' I.C.P. analytical procedures require a 0.5-gram sub-sample from the 
original sample pulp. This sub-sample is digested for 2 hours with an aqua regia mixture. After

cooling the sample is diluted to standard volume and the solution is analyzed by a Jarrell Ash 
ICP computer (Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer). 
 
13.2 Sample Preparation and Analyses–2003 Drilling 
 
The 2003 fall, 49 hole diamond drilling program, added 6,042 assayed samples to the previous 
exploration drilling assay database. In addition to these samples 307 assay standards (56 blanks, 
81 low grade, 83 medium grade, and 89 high grade) were also shipped from the property and 
analyzed as part of the initial quality control program. 
 
The assay standards used in the 2003 drilling program were prepared for RCDC by CDN 
Resource Laboratories Ltd. (CDN) of Delta, BC. The initial material for the preparation of the 
standards was collected from the remaining American Bullion 1994-1995 drilling program 
rejects (Min-En sample rejects) which were loosely stored near Smithers, BC. The assay 
intervals selected for standards were chosen to give a low, a medium, and a high copper 
reference assay. CDN used this material to prepare three homogenous pulps suitable for use as 
assay standard reference material. 
 
The samples from Smithers were first dried, mechanically ground and screened through a 200 
mesh screen. Oversize material was reground and then re-screened. The minus 200 mesh fraction 
was mechanically mixed for 24 hours (tumbled end-over-end in a 50 gallon drum at 
approximately 12 rpm). Cuts were taken from the three standard sets and assayed by Assayers 
Ltd (Vancouver), to test for homogeneity. In all cases assay results were deemed acceptable for 
purposes of homogeneity. Random splits were taken from the sample sets for round-robin 
analysis. Twenty sub-samples, of each pulped standard, were sent each to Acme Laboratories, 
ALS Chemex, Assayers Canada, and International Plasma Laboratory Ltd; for round-robin 
analysis for assay copper and gold. The standards were bagged in tin-top kraft bags, in lots of 
approximately 100 grams and were given tear-off labels. The calculated assay values for the 
three sets of assay standards are 0.353% Cu (0.288 gpt Au), 0.561% Cu (0.561 gpt Au), and 
0.907% Cu (0.744 gpt Au). 
 
CDN Laboratories also supplied the drilling project with blank standards. The material for the 
blanks was purchased "turkey grit", which is crushed granodiorite from local Vancouver sources 
used to help turkeys feed. The samples were mechanically ground, pulverized and bagged in 
kraft bags in lots of 100 grams. The assay standards were shipped to the Red Chris project and 
were inserted into the sample stream by RCDC geologists. 
 
Metallurgical composites were taken from the East Zone and the Main Zone archived drill half-
cores. The 495 composite samples were taken by quarter splitting the stored half-core over 
predetermined assay intervals to provide representative mill feed grades as a hypothetical pit 
advanced down through the East and Main Zones. More than 900 kilograms of East Zone 
composite samples (comprising 6 sample types) and greater than 800 kilograms of Main Zone 
composite samples (comprising 5 sample types) were sent to G&T Metallurgical Services of 
Kamloops, BC, for metallurgical test work. 
 
An additional 67 samples, totalling 300 kilograms, and representing the various property rock 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 65 
December 16, 2004 

types were collected from the stored half-core and were sent to BC Research in Vancouver for 
acid base accounting studies. Enough sample was taken over a 15 metre core length to produce 
either a 2 kilogram or a 5 kilogram sample. 
 
The 6,042 diamond drill core samples were sent directly to International Plasma Laboratory Ltd. 
(IPL) of Vancouver for copper and gold assay. IPL is an ISO 9002 registered analytical 
laboratory. Bedrock diamond drill core intersecting Ashman Formation sediments were not 
assayed or analyzed. One in every twentieth sample with greater than 0.3% Cu were run for 30 
element ICP (AqR) analysis. In total 221 samples were tested by IPL for multi element ICP 
analysis. 
 
The core samples upon arrival at IPL were sorted into batches with ascending, consecutively 
numbered assay tags by IPL's personnel and dried at 55-60° C overnight. The samples were then 
crushed to minus 10 mesh using a Rhino jaw crusher. The entire sample was then split on a Jones 
Riffle to a statistically-representative 250-gram sample pulp. The sample pulp is then pulverized 
in a TM double ring and puck pulverizer to a 95 percent minus 150 mesh then rolled and bagged. 
All of the drill core samples submitted to IPL were assayed for copper and gold. 
 
International plasma Laboratories' assay procedures for copper use a 50 gram sub-sample of the 
250 gram assay pulp. Each laboratory batch of 40 samples is composed of thirty six assay 
samples, one reagent blank, one in-house standard (5, 10, or 15 ppm Cu) and two repeats. The 
repeats are from the 1st and 20th batch samples. IPL uses a multi-acid (HNO3, HCL, HCLO4, and 
HF) slow hot plate digestion to digest the copper. The dried sample is then re-boiled in 5% HCL 
acid to dissolve any soluble matter. After digestion is complete the beakers are cooled, diluted to 
volume, and mixed. The resulting solutions are analyzed on an atomic absorption spectrometer 
using the appropriate standard sets. If any copper analysis returns values higher than the in-house 
standard then the sample or samples are further diluted and re assayed. In addition to the 6,042 
samples sent to IPL for assay there were 307 standards submitted as part of bcMetals' initial 
quality control program. Copper values are reported in percent and have a minimum detection 
limit of 0.01% Cu. 
 
Gold fire assays were also conducted on all the submitted samples and on rechecks returned from 
ALS Chemex Labs. IPL conducted their fire assay procedures on a 30 gram or one assay ton 
sample weight. The sub-samples were fluxed and a silver inquart was added and mixed. These 
sub-samples were fluxed in batches of 24 assays which included one blank and one repeat 
sample. After cupellation the precious metal beads were transferred into new glassware, 
dissolved with aqua regia solution in a hot water bath, diluted to volume, and mixed. The 
resulting solutions were analyzed on an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA) using a suitable 
standard set. Any gold assays over one gram per tonne were re-run by fire assay with a 
gravimetric finish rather than an AA finish. Gold values are reported in grams per tonne (g/t) 
with a detection limit of 0.01 g/t. 
 
As part of RCDCs' quality control and quality assurance program 125 grams of one in every 
twenty samples submitted to IPL were set aside and sent to ALS Chemex. ALS Chemex then 
split the sample in two, returned one half to IPL for re-assay, and assayed the remaining half in-
house for copper and gold. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 66 
December 16, 2004 

 
As mentioned above, one in every twentieth sample, submitted to IPL, with a greater than 0.3% 
Cu assay value was run for 30 element geochemistry using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 
(AqR) analysis. In total 221 samples were run by IPL for multi element ICP analyses. The 30 
elements analyzed in the ICP are: silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), 
bismuth (Bi), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), chrome (Cr), iron (Fe), 
mercury (Hg), potassium (K), lanthanum (La), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum 
(Mo), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), scandium (Sc), antimony (Sb), 
strontium (Sr), thallium (Tl), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), tungsten (W) and zircon 
(Zr). 
 
The IPL I.C.P. analytical procedures require a 0.5-gram sub sample from the original sample 
pulp. This sub-sample is digested with an aqua regia mixture for 90 minutes in a hot water bath 
at ~95°. After cooling the sample is diluted to standard volume and the solution is analyzed by a 
Jarrell Ash 6100 Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer. 
 
13.3 Sample Preparation and Analyses–2004 Drilling 
 
The sample preparation and analyses methods used for the 2004 drilling program are the same in 
all respects as those used in the 2003 program. 
 
13.4 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
 
13.4.1   Introduction 
 
Quality assurance and quality control ('QA/QC') programs began on the Red Chris Project 
during the 1994 drill program conducted by American Bullion and have continued through to the 
2003 infill program completed by RCDC. The analytical quality of the 1994 and 1995 diamond 
drill programs were assessed by Barry Smee, Ph.D., P.Geo., of Smee and Associates Consulting 
Ltd. and presented in two separate reports (Smee, 1995 and Smee, 1996). During the 2003 drill 
campaign RCDC retained A.J. Sinclair, Ph.D., P.Eng. to evaluate the earlier work and comment 
on the 2003 QA/QC procedures and results.  A complete copy of Sinclair's findings is appended 
to this Report (Appendix 2). 
 
13.4.2   QA/QC Procedures 
 
During the 1995 exploration program, 1,235 'blind' duplicate samples and 1,804 assay 
laboratory standards (i.e. 451 samples of each of the AM-A, AM-B, STD and BLK laboratory 
standards) were assayed for copper. The 'blind' duplicate samples were inserted into the sample 
sequence by the field geologists and samplers. In addition, after the copper and gold assay results 
were reported by Min-En Laboratories, four hundred and ninety-five (495) selected sample pulps 
were delivered to Chemex Labs Ltd. in North Vancouver, British Columbia for copper and gold 
check-assaying. These sample pulps were re-assayed using similar procedures as those 
undertaken at Min-En Laboratories. Thus, by the end of the program 491 pairs of copper assays 
(4 cases outside scale) and 488 pairs of gold assays (7 cases outside scale) were directly 
comparable for bias and precision studies by Barry Smee. 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 67 
December 16, 2004 

The QA/QC program instituted for the 2003 drill program was as follows: 
 
 - 3 in-house standards were prepared to reflect low, medium and high grades.  
  Expected values for the three standards were obtained by a round robin analysis  
  between 4 laboratories. The standards were introduced into the sampling stream  
  to monitor sample bias. 
 - blank samples were analyzed with all analytical batches 
 - pulps from approximately 1 in every 20th sample assayed at the primary lab (IPL)  
  were shipped to a second lab (Chemex) for re-analysis. At Chemex these pulps  
  were then renumbered with a random number sequence to produce a set of 'blind' 
  samples that were then sent back to IPL for re-analysis.  
 - a set of 83 samples with Cu > 0.3% and Au > 0.3 gpt from the first hole drilled in  
  2003 (03-248) were sent to Acme Lab for re-analysis. 
 - a second sampling of half-cores for analysis at IPL was completed to provide and  
  indication of inherent geological (short range sampling) variability. 
 
13.4.3   Conclusions by Smee  
 
Conclusion on the 1994 results by Smee, (1995) were as follows: 
 
"The analytical data for the Red Chris Project is well controlled. Standards prove that the data 
is accurate to within acceptable limits. Duplicates show a very small rotational bias between the 
two laboratories, with Min-En being slightly high on copper, and slightly low on gold, when 
compared with Chemex. However, the differences are not significant and do not impact the 
validity of analysis." 
 
On completion of the 1995 drill program Smee was again retained to evaluate QA/QC results. 
According to Smee, (1996), 
 
"The 1995 drill core sampling and analysis appears to be slightly better controlled than the 1994 
program. The standards show that the data is accurate; no samples lie outside of acceptable 
limits. (However, the blank samples indicate that the 1995 analysis is free of contamination, and 
transcription errors should be few. However, the standards analyzed in 1995 are marginally 
lower in mean concentrations than they were in 1994.) 
 
The geochemical analysis for both copper and gold show a slight rotational bias, when Min-En 
is compared to Chemex. This bias does not affect the validity of the data. The assay data also 
shows a slight rotational bias for gold. This bias may be related to the fact that Chemex reports 
gold analysis in ounces per ton, then uses a multiplication factor to convert to grams per tonne. 
This biases the data in 0.03 increments. At low concentrations, this rounding-off can bias the low 
concentrations by more than 10%. 
 
The precision calculations show that the 1995 data is slightly more precise than found in 1994. 
The precision for both data sets is excellent at the higher concentrations; however, gold at the 
0.3 gpt concentration has a precision of 30%. This must be considered when calculating ore 
reserves."

13.4.4 Conclusions by A.J. Sinclair 
 

1 "The 1994 and 1995 American Bullion assay data for Au and Cu by Min-En lab are of an 
acceptable and consistent quality, based on a re-evaluation of quality control information 
summarized by Smee, (1995, 1996) and including (1) replicate analyses of three 
standards and (2) duplicate analyses of many pulps by an independent lab (Chemex). 

 
2  Three in-house standards prepared for Red Chris Development Company. by CDN 

Resource Laboratories Ltd. in 2003, have well-established mean values for Cu and Au 
that make the standards useful reference materials for quality control of sampling and 
assaying related to the 2003 drilling program. These standards were inserted routinely 
with analytical batches to obtain the 2003 analytical data. 

 
3 The principal lab for assaying samples from the 2003 drilling program is IPL Ltd. Repeat 

analyses of standards indicate that IPL 2003 Cu and Au analyses are of acceptable 
accuracy. 

 
4 Every 20th IPL pulp was submitted to an independent lab (Chemex) in order to monitor 

for bias. Results indicate that for both Cu and Au the two labs agree satisfactorily. Where 
bias is noted, it is either negligible in magnitude or affects so few samples near the cutoff 
grade that the bias will have negligible impact on resource\reserve estimates. 

 
5 Precision of IPL data is adequate, as demonstrated by independent data sets including 

(1) repeat analyses of standards, and (2) repeat analyses of pulps checked by Chemex. 
 

6 Inherent geological (sampling) variability is the principal contributor to total variability 
within the data. For Cu the sampling variability is about 5 times the combined 
subsampling plus analytical variability; for Au the sampling variability is about 2.5 times 
the combined subsampling plus analytical variability. All these sources of error are 
random and will be minimized during resource/reserve estimation because many data 
will be used for the estimation of each block and the errors are compensating. 

 
7 The Au/Cu ratio for various data sets is consistent, ranging from about 0.8 to 1.0." 

 
13.4.5   Conclusions 
 
Checks on standards in various grade ranges have shown acceptable accuracy at both the 1994-
95 and 2003 primary analytical laboratories. Blank samples reported low values at or near the 
detection limit indicating the absence of contamination of material during preparation. Duplicate 
pulps sent to second labs have shown no significant analytical bias. The analysis of 'blind' 
duplicates by the primary lab (IPL) has shown the data are unbiased and have a moderate level of 
random analytical error. Re-analysis of 2nd half cores have shown sampling variability to be 
random and as a result should be minimized during the resource estimation. In the writers 
opinion the assay data base at Red Chris are both suitable and of the quality necessary to use in a 
Resource Estimate.

13.5 ICP Analysis   
 

A total of 2,458 I.C.P. analyses on 20 percent of the drill core samples were taken during the 
1994-95 drill campaigns. An additional 177 I.C.P. samples were taken in 2003. The results 
indicate that, except for copper and gold, there are no other metals of significant economic 
interest. Silver values are generally quite low but silver could add significant value to a 
copper-gold concentrate. Lead and zinc values appear to be of little economic significance, and 
arsenic, antimony, barium and other elements that are generally considered to be detrimental 
from a metallurgical standpoint are all quite low. No mercury analyses were taken in 1994-95 but 
the 129 samples tested in 2003 were all less than the detection limit of 3 ppm. The following 
Table 5 shows the analytical and statistical results for some the more commonly associated 
elements with porphyry copper-gold mineralization.

The results of mineral characterization studies are very positive for the project since they indicate 
that a 'clean' copper-gold-silver concentrate could be produced without any penalty 
contaminants. 
 
 
14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The designation between the Main and East zones for Red Chris was set at the 50650 E 
coordinate. All information west of this boundary is referred to as Main Zone and east of the 
boundary as East Zone. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 70 
December 16, 2004 

14.1 Assay Capping 
 
The Main and East Zones contain a combined 261 drill holes which total 76,420 m of diamond 
drilling. Within this drilling, a total of 30,578 Cu assays and 29,992 Au assays have been 
collected. Appendix 1 lists all drill holes used in this study. 
 
The data was initially subdivided into 4 geologic domains namely: Main Zone Inner and Outer 
Core, and East Zone Inner and Outer Core. Domain codes were assigned to each assay that fell 
within the interpreted domain solids. For each domain, copper and gold distributions were 
examined using lognormal cumulative frequency plots. The copper and gold distributions for 
each domain were evaluated with individual mineralized populations separated by partitioning 
the probability plots. Capping was instituted if required to reduce the effects of isolated outlier 
high assays. In general capping levels were set at 2 standard deviations above the mean of the 
highest population. 
 
Values identified for capping were as follows: 
 Main Zone – Inner Core 
  Cu - A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (5.16%) 
   No assays capped 
  Au -  A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (7.24 g/t) 
   One assay at 8.23 g/t was capped at 7.24 g/t 
 Main Zone – Outer Core 
  Cu - A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (1.77%) 
   One assay at 3.1% was capped at 1.77 % Cu 
  Au -  A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (2.44 g/t) 
   No assays capped 
 East Zone – Inner Core 
  Cu - A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (4.63 %) 
   Two assays at 4.65 and 6.60 % were capped at 4.63% 
  Au -  A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (5.66 g/t) 
   One assay at 6.86 g/t was capped 
 East Zone – Outer Core 
  Cu - A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (4.40 %) 
   No assays capped 
  Au -  A capping level of 2 S.D. past the mean of the upper population (3.74 g/t) 
   No assays capped 
  
As a further check on capping, the grade distributions for copper and gold were examined in a 
series of cross sections on 25 m centres through both the Main and East zones. In almost all 
cases, high values for copper and gold were surrounded by other high values with gradual build 
ups and few if any sharp spikes in grade. In addition crossing drill holes in high grade areas also 
showed similar grade patterns (see Figure 11). 
 
One example of an isolated high value from the Main zone outer core is shown on section 50,450 
E in Figure 12. In this case the isolated high copper value of 3.1 % near the top of the hole 
should be capped and in fact, it was identified by the capping scheme described above.  Assays

14.2  15 metre Composites 
 
Down hole 15 m composites were produced to honour the domain boundaries. Composites at 
contacts less than 7.5 m were combined with the previous sample to produce a uniform support 
of 15 ± 7.5 m. Based on the additional drill hole information collected during the 2003 field 
season, the geologic domains, used in previous studies, were reviewed and modified. 
 
The geologic solid models for the Main Zone and dykes were adjusted where necessary using 
geological information obtained in the 2004 drilling.  Within the East Zone the previous 
interpretation of Inner Core, Outer Core and Main Phase was reinterpreted and modeled as Inner 
Core and East Zone Main Phase.  The Main Phase solid used for the Main Zone was extended 
into the East Zone and the break between the Main and East zones was considered a soft 
boundary in 2004.  That is to say, variography was completed separately for the Main and East 
Main Phase but drill hole composites on either side of the 50650 E divide were used to estimate 
blocks near the boundary.  The East Satellite Zone was renamed the East Zone Extension and its 
boundaries were adjusted to reflect the 2004 drill information. Summary statistics for 15 m 
composites within each zone are presented below in Table 6. 
 
No additional drilling was completed on the Far West or Gulley Zones, so the Resource 
estimates reported for these areas in the February 2004 Report, were not changed.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
A comprehensive metallurgical test program was conducted in 2004 by G&T Metallurgical 
Services Ltd., Kamloops, British Columbia, under the direction of Peter Brown, P.Eng., 
Consulting Engineer, Tom Lafreniere, A.Sc.T., President, and Tom Shouldice, P.Eng., General 
Manager, Operations.  The program was designed to develop a scheme for the treatment of Red 
Chris ores. 
 
16.1 Sample Selection and Metallurgical Composites 
 
Drill core from the 2003 exploration program was used for all 2004 metallurgical testing.  A ¼ 
split of selected sections from 23 holes was assembled into composites representing possible 
mining sequences.   
 
Tables 7 and 8 list all samples, drill hole numbers, intervals and assay grades. 
 
Three holes were drilled with HQ coring, #256, #256A and #283, for the purpose of obtaining a 
larger volume sample in each of the Main and East Zones.   Segments of 256 and 256A were 
used in the East Zone metallurgical composites as listed in Table 8.  The remainder of hole 256A 
and 283 were used for grinding and work index studies. 
 
The samples selected by BC Metals for metallurgical testing cover the majority of production 
within the East and Main ore zones with emphasis spatially on  zones in the first nine years of 
the seventeen year mining production phase. The original sampling strategy was based on a mine 
plan and production level that has been superseded by the one forming the basis of this technical 
report. Additional sampling and metallurgical testing may be required to more fully characterize 
the metallurgical response of the entire deposit and link it to the current mine plan. Over the 
mine life East zone will account for about 27% of mine production, but will average about 40% 
in the first six years of operation.

Portions of the drill core were blended to make up a series of composite samples for 
metallurgical testing.  Composites MZ-1,2,3 and EZ-1,2,3,4 represent horizontal layers within 
each zone that would be mined sequentially.  Composite EZ-5 was a high grade sample prepared 
to study the effect of metallurgy at higher grades.  Composites MZ-4, MZ-5 and EZ-6 are lower 
grade, representing material that will be stockpiled during the seventeen year mining phase and 
processed at a later date in years 18 -25.  Table 9 lists actual composite head grades used in the 
metallurgical testing. Over the mine life the average copper and grades of Main and East zones 
are expected to average about 0.42% and gold 0.30-0.39g/t respectively. In the first nine years of 
production the Main zone copper grade will average about 0.46% and the average grade of the 
Main zone metallurgical composite is about 0.47%.  The average grade of the east zone 
composite and global sample is relatively higher than the current production plan.  Additional 
sampling and metallurgical work has been recommended to improve this link to the new mine 
plan.

16.2 Mineralogy 
 
Pyrite, chalcopyrite and lesser bornite are the principal sulphide minerals of the Red Chris 
deposit.  Minor covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and molybdenite, sphalerite and galena 
occur locally in trace amounts.  Gold, second in economic importance to copper, occurs as native 
and electrum, genetically-associated with the copper and pyrite mineralization. 
 
The Main Zone mineralogy consists predominantly of chalcopyrite and pyrite with an average 
pyrite : chalcopyrite ratio of 10:1.   The East Zone mineralogy has an average pyrite : 
chalcopyrite ratio of  4:1, with significant amounts of bornite present.  The non-sulphide gangue 
minerals include a mixture of sericite, quartz, ankerite, dolomite, illite and magnesite.   There are 
no oxide copper minerals. 
 
Gold occurrence is higher in the East Zone, and relative to the Main Zone, it is more dominantly 
associated with copper sulphides than pyrite. While the basic mineralogy of occurrence is similar 
throughout both zones this results in better gold recoveries in East Zone.   Table 11 lists the 
mineralogy of the metallurgical composites.

16.3 2004 Metallurgical Test Program 
 
The program of flowsheet development studies and metallurgical response was based on the  
following series of objectives: 
 

 Study the mineral composition and fragmentation characteristics of several ore composites 
from the Main and East Zones, representing material to be processed during the early years 
of the operation. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 78 
December 16, 2004 

 Devise a set of common treatment parameters for processing the Red Chris ore types, 
including flotation feed sizing, regrind product sizing, reagent regime and flowsheet 
configurations. 

 Conduct a series of work index tests to determine ore hardness variation for mill sizing and 
power requirements. 

 Conduct modal assessments on groups of cycle test products to determine if further 
enhancements in metallurgical performance of the ores would be technically feasible. 

 Assess the concentrate quality with regard to mineral composition and minor element 
concentrations. 

 Using optimum treatment parameters, perform a series of standard tests on a variety of 
samples throughout the orebody to determine the variation in expected metallurgy. 

 
16.3.1   Mineral Liberation Characteristics 
 
A primary grind of 150 micron  K80 was determined as optimum for the Red Chris ore.  At this 
feed sizing, 50% of the chalcopyrite and bornite particles are liberated, along with 90% pyrite 
liberation and 95% non-sulphide gangue minerals.  These liberation figures are within the typical 
range of standard industry practice.  The average liberation of minerals in the flotation feed of 
twenty two porphyry copper-gold deposits in G&T's data base at a primary grind size of 185 
microns K80 was 55% for copper sulphides, 65% for pyrite and 92% for non-sulphide gangue 
minerals. 
 
The Red Chris ore is finer grained when compared with many porphyry copper-gold deposits, 
and as such will require a slightly finer grind size.  This is also evident in the 24 micron regrind  
size selected for the flotation cleaner circuit feed. 
 
A primary grind of 105 micron K80 increased the recovery, however, this is more than off-set by 
an additional 3.5MW of power required for grinding or a reduction in throughput. A simple 
economic study confirmed this, using typical power costs and a net smelter revenue value for 
copper of 90 cents.  Testing at a coarser 200 micron K80 resulted in a 5% recovery loss.  The 150 
micron K80 was considered the optimum level for this application. However, the economic 
primary grind selection should be reviewed if copper prices continue to improve. 
 
16.3.2   Rougher and Cleaner Flotation 
 
A total of 129 bench tests followed by 31 locked cycle flotation tests were conducted studying 
pulp density, pH, reagent dosage, flotation residence time and grind size effect.  Table 12 lists 
the operating parameters required to achieve optimum performance.  Although the mineralogy 
between the two zones is different, similar operating parameters will be used with no loss in 
performance.

Typical operating practice in many porphyry copper operations is to produce a 10 – 15% Cu 
rougher concentrate by pulling 4 – 5% mass.  Current testwork indicates the Red Chris ore 
requires a 15 – 20 % mass pull resulting in a rougher concentrate grade of 3% Cu in order to 
achieve the same recovery. The regrind circuit power has been specified based on a design 
weight recovery of 15%. 
 
A series of regrinding tests were conducted to investigate the possibility of preferential or 
distributed regrinding power, and the benefit of pulp conditioning.  The tests involved by-passing 
part of the higher grade rougher concentrate, pre-cleaning prior to regrinding and classification 
prior to regrinding. 
 
None of the modified circuits produced any improvement in results over those of the 
conventional regrinding circuit.  Testing indicated regrinding to a relatively fine liberation sizing 
of K80 = 24 microns was potentially required to obtain optimum final grade and recovery, but 
this is mainly based on a consideration of Main Zone metallurgy. More testwork was 
recommended by G&T to optimize regrind size selection and power. 
 
The duplicate tests listed in the following table indicate a slightly higher concentrate grade was 
achieved using the modified circuit.  However, when the higher rougher concentrate feed grade 
effect is taken into account, the results are very similar.

16.3.3   Gold Occurrence 
 
Gold occurs with both the copper sulphides and pyrite.  Very little is associated with the non-
sulphide gangue minerals as illustrated in the Gold Recovery Partition Table.  The differences 
recorded in gold recoveries for the East and Main Zone composites are entirely attributable to a 
much larger proportion of gold tracking the pyrite in the Main Zone composites.

the response of gold recovery to gravity separation.  Table 15 lists the results of these tests, 
indicating very low recovery and up-grading effect.

16.3.5   Work Index and Ore Hardness 
 
A total of 64 ball mill / rod mill grinding work index tests were performed by five separate 
laboratories.  G&T Metallurgical Engineers performed 49 of the tests using both the Bond Work 
Index method and the Comparative Work Index method.  Four tests were conducted to confirm 
the validity of the Comparative Work Index method.  On a Main Zone composite the Bond WI 
was 14.0 kW-hrs/tonne compared with 13.5 kW-hrs/tonne using the Comparative WI method.  
Similarly, on an East Zone composite, the Bond WI was 14.1 kW-hrs/tonne compared with 14.2 
kW-hrs/tonne using the Comparative WI method. 
 
Thirty three samples were tested in the Geometallurgical Ore Mapping Program designed to 
establish the metallurgical variation within the two zones.  All samples were subjected to the 
Comparative Work Index test.  The work index of the Main Zone averaged 14.8 kW-hrs/tonne 
with a range of 11.5 – 16.6 kW-hrs/tonne.  The East Zone averaged 16.4 kW-hrs/tonne with a 
range of 10.8 – 22.1 kW-hrs/tonne. 
 
During the first year of mining, the weighted calculation of 60% Main Zone and 40% East Zone 
provides a work index of 14.0 kW-hrs/tonne.  In year 2, the average work index increases 
slightly to 14.3 with the East Zone contributing 31% of the feed.  For years 3 to 5 inclusive, the 
average work index increases to 15.5 kW-hrs/tonne due to the gradual hardness increase at depth.  
Beyond year 7, test work indicates a further increase in hardness. 
 
An average 16.1 kW-hrs/tonne ball mill work index was used to calculate power requirements 
for mill sizing at 30,000 tonnes per day.   
 
16.3.6   Metallurgical Recoveries 
 
The results of G&T's locked cycle testwork are presented in Table 16. The flotation locked cycle 
testing produced a copper grade-recovery profile relationship for both zones which is 
summarized in Table 17.

December 16, 2004 

The recoveries of copper to concentrate ranged from 85 to 90 percent while gold recoveries  
varied between 45 and 65 percent. Gold recovery in both zones was dependent on the head 
grades and pyrite content and higher in East zone..  
 
Based on G&T's results, and a production split of 73% and 27% between Main and East zones 
respectively, the overall life of mine metallurgy is estimated to be about: 
 

Mass % Assay - % or g/t Recovery-% 
 Copper Gold Copper Gold 

1.8 26.4 11.2 88 49 
 
This is in reasonable agreement with the overall mine plan recoveries of 87% copper  and 
47%gold at a 27% copper concentrate grade. Over the first five years of operation gold recovery 
is expected to vary in the range of 50 – 60% depending on mineralogy and grade, with an overall 
average of 56%. 
 
Additional sampling and testwork is recommended to improve the correlation of metallurgy the 
production schedule forming the basis of this technical report. In addition the impact on recovery 
of storing low-grade ore for later processing should also be investigated. However this occurs 
only towards the end of the mine life.

producing a final concentrate for use and testing by prospective buyers.  Table 18 lists the full 
analysis, including minor elements, of a sample prepared in the ratio of 64% Main Zone and 36%

16.3.8 Historical Testwork 
 
Mineral processing testwork conducted by Lakefield Research Limited in 1995 and 1996  and 
earlier work by G&T Metallurgical Services Ltd., indicated the Red Chris deposit responds well 
to processing by conventional crushing, grinding and flotation to produce a commercial grade 
copper-gold concentrate. 
 
These earlier programs formed the basis for the 2004 program conducted on newly acquired drill 
core from the 2003 exploration program. 
 
16.4 Ore Variability 
 
A batch rougher and cleaner geometallurgical mapping program was performed to test 33 
samples throughout the orebody representing the Main Zone, East Zone Outer Shell and East 
Zone Core.  The samples were selected from the main set listed in Tables 7 and 8.  The testing 
consisted of a mineralogical evaluation, hardness determination  and metallurgical performance 
as outlined in Table 19. The average of these results is marginally below the projected 
metallurgy from earlier locked cycle testing. The reason for this is that the sub-samples used in 
the mapping program do not represent all the ore used in the master and global composites. As 
well the variability program was based on batch testing, which for recovery estimation relies on a 
smaller sample statistically and extrapolation of intermediate products, whereas locked cycle 
testing is based on processing larger samples and direct measurement of products. The locked 
cycle results are therefore regarded as a better estimate of recovery. The geometallurgy data 
indicates some moderate variability in the metallurgical performance. Additional work is 
recommended to align this data with the mine plan to optimize it.

16.5 Processing 
 
The Red Chris ore will be processed through an on-site concentrator that will produce a copper-
gold flotation concentrate that will be shipped out of the Province for smelting and refining. The 
nominal milling rate will be 30,000 tonnes per day. A simplified flowsheet is presented in Figure 
13. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 87 
December 16, 2004 

Figure 13 - Red Chris Simplified Flowsheet 

 

16.5.1 Crushing 
 
Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be dumped from 230 tonne mine trucks into the dump pocket of a 
primary 1270 mm x 1651 mm (50" x 65") gyratory crusher. The dump pocked is designed to 
accept two trucks at a 150 degree angle to each other. Crushed ore will discharge into a surge 
pocket below the primary crusher.  Ore will be withdrawn from the surge pocket by a 2,134 mm 
wide x 25.9 m long belt feeder.  The feeder will discharge onto a 1,372 mm wide x 237 m long 
overland conveyor. This conveyor will transport the coarse ore from the gyratory crusher to the 
coarse ore stockpile. 

The uncovered coarse ore stockpile will have a nominal live capacity of 30,000 tonnes, or the 
equivalent of one day's operation at the design throughput rate. Ore will be reclaimed from the 
coarse ore stockpile using three 1,240 mm wide x 7.2 m long variable speed belt feeders located 
in a reclaim tunnel beneath the stockpile and fed to the SAG mill feed conveyor. This 1,067 mm 
wide x 141 m long conveyor will deliver ore to the SAG mill. Dust collection facilities will be 
included both at the gyratory crusher and at the stockpile reclaim tunnel to intercept and collect 
dust from both the crusher discharge conveyor and from the reclaim tunnel feeders under the 
crushed ore stockpile. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 88 
December 16, 2004 

 
16.5.2 Grinding 
 
Ore will be ground in two stages to produce a product suitable for flotation.  The first stage will 
be a 10.36 m dia. x 5.49 m EGL (34 ft dia. x 18 ft EGL) semi-autogenous grinding mill driven by 
two (2) 5,600 kW (7,500 hp) wound rotor induction motors. Oversize pebbles extracted from the 
SAG Mill will be removed by screen, crushed by a 600 kW (800 hp) pebble crusher, and then 
returned to the SAG Mill feed. Undersize from the SAG mill discharge screens will be 
transferred to two parallel ball mills for secondary grinding. 

The second grinding stage will consist of two parallel 5.79m dia. x 9.75m EGL (19 ft dia. x 32 ft 
EGL) ball mills, each driven by a 5,600 kW (7,500 hp) wound rotor induction motor. Each mill 
will operate in closed circuit with a cyclopac consisting of six (6) 650 mm dia. cyclones (5 
operating, 1 standby). Each cyclopac will be fed by two 20" x 18" variable speed pumps (1 
operating, 1 standby).  The cyclone underflow will report to back to the ball mill for grinding, 
while the cyclone overflow, at 38 wt% solids and a P80 of 150 microns will gravitate to the 
rougher flotation circuit. 

16.5.3 Flotation 
 
The ground slurry from the secondary grinding circuit (cyclone overflow) will be passed through 
two parallel rougher/scavenger flotation circuits each consisting of 5 x 100 m3 capacity flotation 
cells, equivalent to approximately 18 minutes retention time. The copper-gold concentrates from 
all of the rougher scavenger flotation cells will be combined and directed to the regrind circuit. 
The tailing from the rougher scavenger cells will be directed through two additional 100 m3 
parallel flotation cells designed to de-sulphurize the final mill tailings on as needed basis. The 
objective is to produce a de-pyritized final mill tailing to create Non-Acid Generating (NAG) 
tailings for use as dam construction material and for beaches along the upstream faces of each of 
the three tailings dams at final closure. 

The copper gold concentrate from the rougher scavenger circuit and cleaner/scavenger circuit 
will be reground in two parallel 1120 kW (1500 hp) tower mills operating in closed circuit with a 
cyclopac consisting of twelve (12) 250 mm dia. cyclones (10 operating, 2 standby). Cyclone 
underflow will return to the regrind mills, while cyclone overflow will be pumped to two stages 
of cleaning using column flotation cells.  

The concentrates from both column flotation cells (Stage 1 and Stage 2 Cleaner Cells) will be 
combined and pumped to the concentrate thickener as the final copper gold concentrate produced 
by the mill. The tailing from the Stage 1 column cleaner cell will be directed to the Stage 2 
column cleaner cell. The tailings from the Stage 2 column cleaner cell will be directed to the 
cleaner scavenger flotation circuit consisting of 6 x 50 m3 flotation cells. The concentrate from 
the cleaner scavenger circuit will be sent back to the concentrate regrind circuit for additional 
liberation. The tailings from the cleaner scavenger circuit will be directed to the final mill 
tailings pump box where it will be combined with the rougher scavenger tailings and sent to the

tailings impoundment. 
 
16.5.4 Concentrate Thickening and Filtration 
 
The final copper-gold flotation concentrate from the column cleaner cells (Stage 1 and 2) will be 
directed to the 20 m. dia. concentrate thickener where excess water will be removed and 
recycled. The thickened concentrate will be drawn from the thickener underflow and sent to one 
of two parallel pressure filters where the water will be pressed out of the concentrate to generate 
a dewatered concentrate filter cake. The dewatered final copper-gold concentrate will be 
stockpiled at one end of the mill building from where it will be loaded by front end loader into 
B-Train bulk concentrate haul trucks.   A scale will be provided in the load out area to ensure 
proper legal loading of the concentrate trucks. 

16.5.5 Tailing 
 
The process plant tailings system consists of two separate tailings pipelines: regular tailings 
pipeline and sands pipeline.  Under normal operating practice all tailings will be sent to the 
tailings pond using gravity flow in the regular tailings pipeline. This line will consist of two 
pipelines running from the plant site to a splitter box. From the splitter box, one line will 
transport tailings to the North Dam and another line will transport tailings to the South Dam. 
Only one line will operate at a time (1 operating, 1 standby). In order to dissipate excess 
hydraulic head, choke stations will be installed. 

During periods of tailing dam construction, the final de-pyritized rougher tailings will be sent to 
a cyclone sands plant, within the mill complex, where coarse tailings solids will be separated 
from the fines using two parallel cyclone banks to generate a de-pyritized coarse NAG tailings 
sand to be used in dam construction. 

The sands pipeline is used to transport non-acid generating (NAG) cycloned sand from the 
process plant to the tailings impoundment area. This sand will be used to raise and extend the 
downstream shells of the North Dam and South Dam. The sands pipeline will consist of a single 
pipeline running in parallel with the regular tailings pipelines from the plant site to the splitter 
box. From the splitter box, one line will transport sand to the North Dam and another line to the 
South Dam. During the winter months, this system will be drained and shutdown. In order to 
dissipate excess hydraulic head, choke stations will be installed.

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
17.1 Semivariogram Analysis 
 
Based on the new geologic interpretation, the semi-variograms for Red-Chris were checked for 
copper and gold within the Main Phase and East Zone Inner Core Domains and not changed.  
The new interpretation combining East Zone outer core and Main phase required re-modeling for 
the East Zone Main Phase, the remaining domains had insufficient data to model.  
 
Pairwise relative semivariograms were used to model the variables. The procedure was to first 
look in the directions of maximum information; namely down-hole, by modeling azimuths 0o and 
180 o and dip directions -60o and -45o. These four directions represent the majority of drill holes 
on the property. From the semivariograms produced in these four directions, the sill and nugget 
components of the semivariograms were established. These parameters were then applied to the 
models produced in the horizontal plane do determine the direction of maximum continuity. The 
vertical plane perpendicular to this direction was then tested to determine the directions of 
maximum and minimum continuity. 
 
17.1.1 Main Zone 
 
The Main Zone is defined as that part of the deposit west of coordinate 50,650 E and east of 
49,600 E. This distinction was made in the 1996 study to account for a flexure in the mineralized 
zone east of this point that trends north-east.  Composites within the Main Zone were modeled 
for copper and gold.  In all cases simple spherical models were fit to the data. 
 
Nested spherical models were fit to copper with the longest horizontal range of 200 m along 
azimuth 045o. The vertical plane perpendicular to this showed a maximum range of 250 m at 
azimuth 135o dip -75o and the minimum range of 90 m at azimuth 315 o dip -15 o.  
 
Nested spherical models were also fit to gold with the longest horizontal range of 310 m along 
azimuth 070o. The vertical plane perpendicular to this showed a maximum range of 300 m at 
azimuth 160o dip -60o and the minimum range of 170 m at azimuth 340o dip -30 o.  
 
The dykes that were identified within the Main Zone did not have enough data to model with 
semivariograms, so the ranges from the Main Zone were used to control an inverse distance 
estimate. 
 
17.1.2  East Zone 
 
The East Zone consisted of all data east of 50650 E. Again all variables were modeled with 
simple spherical models. For variography, data were subdivided into 2 domains. 
 
17.1.2.1 East Zone Main Phase 
 
For modeling purposes the Main Phase east of 50650 E was modelled independently from the 
Main Phase west of 50650 E. For copper the four directions of most drill holes were modeled

December 16, 2004 

first; namely azimuth 0° and 180o with dips of -60o and -45o. A sill and nugget level were 
established from these directions and applied to the horizontal plane. The maximum continuity in 
the horizontal plane was found to be 350 m along azimuth 45o. The vertical plane perpendicular 
to azimuth 45° was tested and the maximum continuity within this plane was 250 m at azimuth 
135o and dip -75o while in the third principal direction the maximum range was 100 m at azimuth 
315o dip -15o. 
 
A similar procedure was used to model gold in this domain. A maximum range of 210 m was 
found in the horizontal plane at azimuth 70° and dip 0°. In the plane perpendicular to this a 
maximum range of 220 m was found at azimuth 160o dip -60o while a minimum of 60 m was 
found at azimuth 340o dip -30o. 
 
These models (see Table 20 for parameters) were used to estimate the Main Phase East zone and 
the East Extension domains. 
 
17.1.2.2 East Zone Inner Core 
 
There were 426 composites coded East Zone inner core. As mentioned above, the strategy 
employed was to fit the best model possible to the 4 directions with the most data and then apply 
this model to the horizontal plane if possible. 
For copper, the longest range of 125 m in the horizontal plane was found along azimuth 70o dip 
0°. The two perpendiculars had ranges of 50 m at azimuth 340° dip 0° and 100 m at dip -90o. 
 
Gold showed a very similar pattern to copper with maximum continuity of 90 m along azimuth 
70 o dip 0. The two perpendiculars had ranges of 40 m at azimuth 340 dip 0 and 90 m at dip -90o. 
 
The parameters for each model within each zone are summarized below in Table 20. Figure 14 
shows on the 1490 Level the various search ellipses set at the maximum semivariogram ranges, 
the geologic domains and the 15 m composites colour coded by copper grade and projected 30 m 
from each side of the section.

17.2 Block Model Estimation 
 
17.2.1 Introduction 
 
The geologic model that controls the estimation process was interpreted by RCDC consulting 
geologists. A geologic block model was then produced with a three dimensional grid of blocks, 
each 20 x 20 x 15 m in dimension and coded by geologic domain. This model used partial blocks 
in that the proportion of a block within each domain solid was reported and stored. Blocks were 
also compared to the topographic surface, with the proportion of the block below this surface 
recorded. The parameters of the block model are shown below in Table 21. The limits of the 
2004 block model were expanded to include the Far West and Gully Zones which were not 
estimated in 1996.

Dimension of Block 20 m 20 m 15 m 

 
Blocks within the Main Zone were estimated by ordinary kriging if the proportion of the block 
within the Main Zone solid was greater than zero. Blocks with a proportion of dyke material 
greater than zero were estimated using inverse distance squared and only dyke composites. For 
blocks with both dyke and Main Zone estimated, a weighted average was calculated for copper 
and gold. For example, the grade of Cu within any block was equal to the following: 
 
 Cu =  (Proportion Main Zone * Main Zone Cu) + (Proportion Dyke * Dyke Cu)   
     (Proportion Main Zone + Proportion Dyke) 
 
For the East zone Main Phase, the Inner Core, and East zone Extension, mineralization was all 
estimated by ordinary kriging, if the proportion of any of these domains within a block was 
greater than zero. Again, a weighted average grade was calculated for the block if two or more 
domains were detected.  Unlike the last estimate, however, the boundary between the Main zone 
Main Phase and East zone Main Phase was considered soft and composites from either side of 
the 50650 E divide were allowed to influence blocks. 
 
Kriging was in general completed in three passes; the first using ¼ the semivariogram range, the 
second using ½ the semivariogram range and the third using the full range. In a few cases, on the 
edges of the deposit, some blocks were still not estimated so the search ellipse was expanded to 
twice the range. If more than 16 composites were found, the closest 16 were used with a 
minimum of 4 composites required. The search ellipsoids were oriented parallel to the maximum 
direction of continuity for each variable with the axis of the ellipsoids a function of the range for 
the semivariograms in the three principal directions. The search criteria, with ranges of

17.2.2 Specific Gravity 
 
During the 1994 and 1995 drill campaigns, specific gravity was measured, on a routine basis, 
from a representative piece of drill core taken every 8 m throughout each drill hole. A total of 
6,934 separate measurements of SG were taken which ranged from a low of 2.07 to a high of 
3.46 and had an arithmetic average of 2.785. In 1998 this average was applied to every estimated 
block to determine block tonnage. 
 
For the 2002 estimate of Red Chris resource, SG was treated as a variable and estimated into 
every kriged block. The 6,934 measured SG's were assigned to the appropriate 15 m composite 
for each drill hole. The composites were then used to interpolate an SG estimate into each block 
that was estimated for Cu and Au. The method of interpolation was inverse distance squared.  
During the 2003 drill campaign 134 samples of drill core were sent to the Department of Mining 
and Mineral Processing Engineering, at the University of British Columbia. The process used to 
measure bulk density was ASTM C92 – Standard Test Methods for Absorption and Bulk 
Specific Gravity of Dimension Stone– with the following deviations: 
 
 1. Several core samples received with 46 mm diameter, undersized for 2" (50.4 mm) 
  minimum dimension for test, 

2. Samples heated at 110°C for 48 hours (standard designates 60°C same time 
period). 

 
The results are listed below in Table 23 for the East Zone. The minimum SG for the East Zone 
was 2.69 corresponding to sample [03-261 328.39 to 328.57]. The maximum SG for the East 
Zone was 2.87 corresponding to samples [03-264 148.13 to 148.28], [03-266 32.91 to 33.08], 
[03-266 145.98 to 146.13] and [03-269 92.22 to 92.36]. The average SG for the East Zone was 
2.79.

The results for the Main Zone are tabulated below in Table 24. The maximum specific gravity 
was recorded for sample [03-284 313.64 to 313.80] at a value of 3.07. The minimum specific 
gravity recorded was 2.57 corresponding to sample [03-292 11.19 to 11.33]. The average 
specific gravity for all Main Zone samples was 2.80. 
 
For the November 2004 resource estimate, the 2004 measurements for specific gravity were 
added to the earlier data base and specific gravity was estimated for every mineralized block in 
the model by inverse distance squared. A search ellipse of 220 m at azimuth 70o dip 0, 150 at 
azimuth 340 o dip 0 and 300 m azimuth 0 dip -90 o was used.

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 99 
December 16, 2004 

17.2.3 Block Tonnage Calculation 
 
Estimated blocks were assigned a tonnage based on proportion of block below the topographic 
surface, the estimated specific gravity, and the volume of a block 20 x 20 x 15 m in dimension. 
 
17.2.4 Results  

 
Examples of the grade estimates for copper are presented as four level plans 1290, 1335, 1380 
and 1425 shown as Figures 15 to 18 respectively. In each figure the blocks are colour coded by 
kriged copper values as shown in the Legend. The drill hole composites are also shown to 
demonstrate the data available to make the estimates. While gold and classification are also 
shown in the blocks they are not meant to be read at this scale, rather the plots are shown purely 
to demonstrate copper distribution.

The Red Chris Open Pit encompasses about a 53 hectare area on the crest.  The open pit design 
currently comprises a phased development with two separate pit bottoms located in the western 
and eastern ends. Pit floor in the eastern section is approximately 1230 m while the western end 
is deeper, with an expected pit floor at approximately 1150m.  The pit highwall is approximately 
400 m high and is to be located on the north wall.  Figure 19 displays a schematic of the pit and 
proposed stages of development while Figure 20 displays a longitudinal section.

(Stage 1-Brown, Stage 2-Green, Stage 3-Black) 

 
Geology within the pit walls is expected to comprise primarily of the Red Stock monzodiorite, 
with intersections of the Bowser Sediments and Dynamite Hill Volcanics in the southern and 
northern pit walls respectively.  Dominant structure consists of steeply dipping shears and faults 
within the Red Stock that trend predominantly northeast southwest

Geotechnical investigations within the pit area were completed by American Bullion, and Knight 
and Piesold.  Geotechnical information was gathered and analyzed from these programs and 
included data from both exploration drilling and geotechnical drilling.  In 2004 AMEC 
completed four additional geotechnical drillholes into and behind the proposed pit walls in the 
north and south to confirm information gathered by others as well as identify structural controls 
that may exist behind the pit walls.  These drillholes were geotechnically logged, the core was 
oriented and an acoustic borehole camera was used to confirm orientations and rock mass 
conditions in two of the four drillholes. 
 
After review and analysis of the above geotechnical data, the open pit was divided into four 
geotechnical domains based on structural and lithologic characteristics for design purposes.  
Kinematic, probabilistic and rock mass stability analysis methods were used to determine pit 
slope bench face, inter-ramp and overall slope angles for the various domains and wall 
orientations.  To optimize pit design, bcMetals is committed to implementation of a significant 
wall control and drainage program during pit development to reduce likelihood of damage and 
failure of the pit walls during development.  As a result, an aggressive pit wall slope design was 
identified.  The success of the wall control and drainage programs and subsequent back analysis 
and data gathering during the Stage I Pit development will be key in the performance of the 
Stage I Open Pit slopes and future design stages.

18.1.2 Tailings Disposal 
 
The tailings impoundment will be developed in the valley to the northeast of the open pit and 
plantsite.  Drawings A1-143673-30-C-0011 through 0017, 0019 and 0026 (Figures 21 - 29) 
illustrate the tailings management system.  The tailings impoundment will provide storage for all 
process tailings generated by the project.  The tailings will be conveyed from the plant site to the 
tailings impoundment via pipeline where they will be discharged from the North and/or South 
Dam.  Tailings will not be discharged from the smaller Northeast Dam, which is not required to 
be constructed until the latter years of the mine life.  The tailings distribution system is designed 
to manage the changing requirements of the tailings impoundment development over the life of 
the mine.   This includes provision for development of required tailings beaches and for 
construction of the cycloned tailings sand downstream shells of the North and South dams.  
 
All three dams will have a central core of compacted glacial till fill of low hydraulic 
conductivity.  The till core of each dam will be keyed into the native till that blankets most of the 
impoundment area and hence forms a natural "liner" that will serve to limit the rate of seepage 
loss from the impoundment.  The starter dams for the North Dam and the South Dam will have 
upstream and downstream shells of compacted granular fills (sand and gravel) that are present 
within the impoundment area.  Borrow operations for the starter dams will concentrate on 
obtaining granular fill from those areas that will be flooded in the first few years once the 
impoundment is commissioned.  Subsequent raising of the North Dam and the South Dam, 
which will be undertaken on an annual basis, will involve upward extension of the compacted till 
core via the centerline raising method, with the downstream shell extended and raised using 
compacted non acid generating (NAG) cycloned sand, hydraulically placed.  The upstream shell 
of the dam will also be constructed using cycloned tailings sand.  Runoff and construction water 
draining from the hydraulic fill placement areas on the downstream shells of both these dams 
will report to sedimentation and seepage collection ponds, from which water will be reclaimed to 
the tailings pond. 
 

The embankment zones and specifications as shown on the drawings are summarized in Table 27 
below.

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 109 
December 16, 2004 

The Northeast Dam will have a central core of compacted glacial till, with upstream and 
downstream shells of granular fill, and appropriate filter zones.  The Northeast Dam will be 
constructed and operated as a water-retaining dam, so for closure will include riprap zones on the 
upstream face of the dam for erosion protection. 
 
Tailings will be discharged into the impoundment from both the North Dam and the South Dam.  
As the impoundment nears closure, it will be NAG tailings that are discharged from the dams, so 
that PAG tailings are fully submerged at closure, and NAG above-water tailings beaches are left 
upstream of both dams as part of the closure configuration of the tailings impoundment.   
 
Above-water tailings beaches will likely not form upstream of the dams until perhaps the 2nd or 
3rd year of the impoundment's operating life.  The reclaim pond will initially form at about the 
midpoint of the main north-south valley.  As the impoundment level rises, the water pond will 
also extend into the northeast arm of the tailings impoundment.  The floating reclaim barge will 
be maintained against the west slope of the main north-south valley.  Reclaim of water from the 
tailings pond to the mill process will be maximized to the extent that fresh water makeup supply 
requirements can be optimized.   
 
Development and maintenance of above-water tailings beaches to the upstream of the North 
Dam and South Dam will be greatly facilitated by the ability to produce coarse cycloned tailings 
sand.  This allows placement in cells to effectively control beach development, and results in 
more steeply sloping beaches that more effectively provide physical separation between the 
reclaim water pond and the dam crests. 
 
Cycloned sand will be discharged to the downstream shells of the North and South Dams for 
placement and compaction via hydraulic fill methods, in a manner as practiced at a number of 
tailings dams in British Columbia, two examples being the L-L Dam at the Highland Valley 
Copper Mine, and at the Kemess Mine.  The sand will be discharged at a density of 65% solids 
by weight.  Runoff water decanted from the construction cells, and draining from the sand, will 
report to the downstream seepage and sedimentation ponds.  In these ponds, suspended solids 
will settle out and the water will be pumped over the dams and into the tailings impoundment.  
Each winter, when sand is not being placed on the downstream shells of the dams, excess tailings 
fines that have settled out in the downstream ponds will be trucked for dumping in the tailings 
impoundment, to restore sedimentation capacity for the subsequent year's downstream shell 
construction operations. 
 
During the operational phase of the tailings impoundment, acid rock drainage (ARD) will not 
develop on the basis of the following:  

 
• The high alkalinity of the tailings pond water will act as a buffer and prevent the 

development of ARD.  
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 110 
December 16, 2004 

 
• As the tailings impoundment is raised, most of the tailings will be flooded, which will 

inhibit oxygen flux and hence also protect against ARD development.  Only the sub-
aerial beaches maintained upstream of the North Dam and the South Dam will not be 
flooded, but these will be continually buried (and flooded) as additional tailings are 
deposited as the impoundment level rises. 

• Rougher tailings used for the production of cycloned sand for dam construction will, 
prior to two-stage cycloning, be subjected to an extra flotation to remove any residual 
sulphides.  As such, the cycloned sand produced for dam construction will be NAG. 

• For the last two to three years of active tailings discharge into the impoundment, the 
NAG tailings produced via flotation of the rougher tailings will be kept separate from the 
remainder of the tailings stream (sulphide-bearing cleaner tailings and the sulphides 
rejected from the additional float of the rougher tailings).  The NAG tailings will be 
discharged from the North Dam and the South Dam to form above-water, NAG tailings 
beaches that will be in front of the dams as part of the closure configuration of the 
impoundment.  Development of these beaches will be facilitated through use of cycloned 
sand, which will allow cell construction (i.e. controlled beaching), effectively "stacking" 
beaches against the dam.  This will effectively widen the crests of the two dams, and will 
facilitate trafficability for subsequent growth medium placement and vegetation for 
reclamation of the beaches.   

• During the final years of operation, when only NAG tailings are being discharged from 
the dams, the sulphides-bearing tailings stream will be directed to the deep portion of the 
reclaim pond for discharge to ensure their permanent submergence. 

 
At closure, the alkalinity of the tailings pond water will gradually reduce.  However, all PAG 
tailings will be submerged by water and/or a NAG tailings blanket, and hence will not generate 
ARD.  Closure and reclamation of the tailings impoundment will comprise the following: 

• NAG above-water tailings beaches will be maintained upstream of both the North Dam 
and the South Dam.  To the extent practical (based on trafficability constraints), these 
beaches will be covered by a growth medium and vegetated. 

• Each of the three dams will be covered with a growth medium and vegetated with 
appropriate local species.   

• The diversion ditches will be breached, as they are no longer required at closure. 
• The seepage dams will be breached, with any residual tailings fines in the 

seepage/sedimentation ponds covered and reclaimed. 
• A closure spillway, capable of routing the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, will 

be constructed on the right (looking downstream) abutment of the Northeast Dam. 
• All pumping and piping equipment will be removed. 
• Access road surfaces will be regraded and reclaimed. 
• Protection for monitoring installations (required through the closure phase for the dams) 

will be provided.

18.2 Mining Operations 
 
18.2.1 Introduction 
 
The proposed mining operation is a conventional shovel and truck open pit porphyry copper-gold 
mine feeding a 30,000 tonne per day processing plant using standard mineral flotation 
technology.  The mine has been scheduled to maximise the production of high grade ore, 
especially during the first five years, to minimise the capital payback period.  This strategy 
necessitates mining at a higher cut-off grade with a commensurate higher stripping ratio, i.e. 
waste tonnes to ore tonnes, and the stockpiling of lower grade material for recovery and 
processing later in the mine life.  The average stripping ratio is 2.3:1 during the period of open 
pit production, varying from 3.0:1 in Year 1, 3.1:1 in Year 5, 2.6:1 in Year 10, 1.4:1 in Year 15 
and 0.1:1 in Year 17.  For the last eight years of mine life, the mill is fed from material recovered 
from stockpile.  If this material is included in the total ore mined, the Life-of-Mine ("LOM") 
stripping ratio is 1.1:1.  
 
The mineralization at Red Chris sub-outcrops and hence the requirement for pre-production 
stripping is very low compared with that often required at similar open pit porphyry operations.  
The pre-production period lasts for three months during which approximately 5.0 million tonnes 
of waste and low grade material will be mined.  Low grade material will be stockpiled in a 
segregated dump for easy recovery for processing at a later date. 
 
The mine will utilize electric rotary blasthole drills, drilling 311mm diameter holes, 38m³ electric 
shovels loading 230t capacity haul trucks.  The operation will be supported by standard ancillary 
equipment including an 18m³ front-end-loader, track-and rubber-tired-dozers, graders etc.  
Blastholes will be loaded with heavy ANFO bulk slurry explosive.  The utilization of diesel 
rotary drills and hydraulic excavators is an option that will be considered at the time of 
equipment purchase. 
 

The general arrangement of the mine area is shown in Figure 30 Mine Development Concept.

Ore will be hauled to a primary crusher located near the southeast pit rim.  Low-grade ore will be 
hauled to a stockpile located to the north of the primary crusher and east of the pit limits from 
where it will be reclaimed for processing through the mill when mine resources have been 
exhausted.  This low-grade material will be placed upon a base of non-acid generating ("NAG") 
material.  Potential Acid Generating ("PAG") waste will be hauled to the North waste dump 
(north of the open pit limits) and placed upon a base of NAG waste material.  Provision has be 
made in the design for the NAG layer to be up to 5m thick in areas where water can be expected 
to accumulate or flow. This dump will be reclaimed at mine closure as discussed in Section 18.5 
of this report. 

 

Mining will begin during the preproduction period (year -1) in the East Pit (East Pit Phase I) and 
Main Pit (Main Pit Phase I).  The pit will expand in phased push backs until the ultimate pit 
limits are reached.  In all nine phases will be mined, four in the East Pit and five in the Main Pit.  
The East and the Main pits eventually join to become one large open pit. 

 

The deposit has been modelled using a 15 m bench height in both the Main Zone and the East 
Zone.  Pit walls have been smoothed to incorporate access ramps, berms and face and inter ramp 
angle recommendations by design sector as provided by the geotechnical consultants.   

 

The mine will operate around the clock, 7 days per week, using a 14 days on - 14 days off 
rotation schedule and 12-hour shifts. 

 
18.2.2 Capacity Evaluation 
 
Typically for prophyry deposits such as Red Chris, "bigger is better" in so far that unit operating 
costs decrease with increasing concentrator through-put and the utilization of larger capacity 
equipment.  However along with increased through-put comes a commensurate increase in the 
capital cost.  For Red Chris it was a case of balancing capacity against power requirements and 
the Company's ability to raise the required debt financing. 
 
In 1996 a Pre-Feasibility Study was completed by Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd. ("Fluor").  This 
study contemplated a project capacity of 90,000 tpd milled at a capital cost of $541 million.  This 
capital included $88.9 million for a 287kV power line from the main Skeena sub-station near 
Terrace to the Red Chris mine site, a distance of approximately 390km.  The high capital cost, 
combined with a period of falling metal prices, resulted in the project being shelved. 
 
The Company has adopted an approach that keeps the capital within the ability of the Company 
to finance while maximising the use of large-scale, productive equipment to keep operating costs 
at a minimum.  In the current Feasibility Study it is assumed that power to the junction of 
Highway 37 and the mine access road is provided by BC Hydro. 
 
The Company evaluated capacities up to 50,000 tpd before fixing the capacity at the current 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 123 
December 16, 2004 

process design through-put rate of 30,000 tpd. 
   
18.2.3 Mineral Resources 
 

The Red Chris Project in-situ measured and indicated mineral inventory are based on the block 
model produced by Giroux Consultants Limited ("Giroux"), as discussed in the section on 
resource model development. For the purposes of pit optimization and estimation of Proven and 
Probable Reserves, the mineral inventory has been reported on an NSR cut-off basis for metal 
prices of $400/ounce gold and $1.00/lb copper.  Grades were reported for copper, gold, 
recoverable copper, recoverable gold and recoverable equivalent copper as well as specific 
gravity. 
 
Inpit resources were defined within pit limits determined using the Lerchs Grossman algorithm, 
complex wall slopes with input from AMEC, preliminary economic parameters provided by 
Nilsson Mine Services Ltd ("NMS") and the geological block model of Giroux. 

 
18.2.4 Geotechnical Evaluation 
 
General 
 
The Red Chris Open Pit encompasses about a 53 hectare area on the crest.  The open pit design 
currently comprises a phased development with two separate pit bottoms located in the western 
and eastern ends.  Pit floor in the eastern section is approximately 1155 m while the western end 
is deeper, with an expected pit floor at approximately 1125m.  The pit highwall is approximately 
360 m high in the East Pit and 450 m high in the Main Pit and will be located on the north wall. 
 
Geotechnical Investigations 
 
Boreholes and test pits were used to investigate the geotechnical properties of overburden and 
bedrock at the Red Chris Project.  The following reports have been prepared: 
 

• Knight Piesold Ltd, 2003 Geotechnical Investigations for Open Pit, Waste Dumps and 
Tailings Storage Facility – Volumes I & II; and 

• AMEC, September 2004 Geotechnical Investigations 
• Brawner, Spetember 2004, Geotechnical Review 

 
Geotechnical investigations within the pit area were completed by American Bullion, and Knight 
and Piesold.  Geotechnical information was gathered and analyzed from these programs and 
included data from both exploration drilling and geotechnical drilling.  In 2004 AMEC 
completed four additional geotechnical drillholes into and behind the proposed pit walls in the 
north and south to confirm information gathered by others as well as identify structural controls 
that may exist behind the pit walls.  These drillholes were geotechnically logged, the core was 
oriented and an acoustic borehole camera was used to confirm orientations and rock mass 
conditions in two of the four drillholes. 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 124 
December 16, 2004 

After review and analysis of the above geotechnical data, the open pit was divided into four 
geotechnical domains based on structural and lithologic characteristics for design purposes.  
Kinematic, probabilistic and rock mass stability analysis methods were used to determine pit 
slope bench face, inter-ramp and overall slope angles for the various domains and wall 
orientations.  To optimize pit design, bcMetals is committed to implementation of a significant 
wall control and drainage program during pit development to reduce likelihood of damage and 
failure of the pit walls during development.  As a result, an aggressive pit wall slope design was 
identified.  The success of the wall control and drainage programs and subsequent back analysis 
and data gathering during the internal phase development will be key in the performance of the 
internal phase slopes and final design stages. 

 
Mine Geology 
 
Geology within the pit walls is expected to comprise primarily of the Red Stock monzodiorite, 
with intersections of the Bowser Sediments and Dynamite Hill Volcanics in the southern and 
northern pit walls respectively.  Dominant structure consists of steeply dipping shears and faults 
within the Red Stock that trend predominantly northeast southwest. 

 
Overburden Materials 
 
The waste dumpsite is on a glacially shaped plateau north of the open pit area.  The plateau 
slopes slightly to the south into an east-west valley that separates the dump and stockpile areas 
from the pit area. 
 
The overburden soils consist for the most part of a thin organic surficial layer underlain by 
weathered rock.  The depth of weathering is shallow – approximately 0.2 to 5 m depth.  In the 
east-west drainage valley there is a sandy silty till with cobble size particles in places. 
 
Wall Slope Design 
 
The wall slope design criteria used for the ultimate pit were based upon the assessment provided 
by AMEC in September 2004.  As shown in Table 28 Recommended Wall Slope Angles, ten 
design sectors were identified within the four geotechnical domains and assigned codes in the 
block model.  These sectors are shown in Figure 31 Slope Design Sectors.  The inter-ramp slope 
angles were reduced by one degree for pit optimization to make allowance for haulage roads.  
The actual ultimate pit design input parameters were the face angle and overall inter-ramp wall 
slope by sector.  Berm width was allowed to vary according to this geometric relationship in a 
double 15 m bench configuration.  The internal phase pits were designed with a five degree 
increase in bench face angle and the specified berm width. 
 
In addition to the design criteria shown in the table an allowance was made for a 30 m wide 
haulage road with 10% grade.

Table 28 - Recommended Wall Slope Angles 

 

Figure 31- Slope Design Sectors 

 
18.2.5 Open Pit Optimization 
 
Optimization of the open pit for the Red Chris Project was completed using the computer block 
model provided by Giroux and the Lerchs-Grossman, graph theory based, algorithm for pit limit 
definition.  This program was used in conjunction with Medsystem Minesight© software.  This 
mine planning system has been used extensively within the mining industry for deposits of 
similar origin and size and is generally accepted as an appropriate tool for assessing potential 
ultimate pit size and configuration for a given set of economic parameters. 
 
The following key parameters were used to establish guidelines for the final pit limit using the 
Lerchs-Grossman based algorithm: 
 

• Complex Wall Slope Sectors adjusted for previously located ramp locations; 
• Metal prices; 
• Metal recoveries; 
• Operating costs; 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 126 
December 16, 2004 

• Concentrate transportation charges; 
• Smelter terms; 
• Royalties; and 
• Sustaining capital cost allowance. 

 
The metallurgical recovery and equivalence basis for the mine planning model are shown in 
Table 29 Recovery and Copper Equivalence Calculation.  The recoverable copper and gold 
grades and the recoverable copper equivalent grade are carried on an individual block basis in 
the model.  The net smelter return calculation is shown in Table 30 Net Smelter Return.  The net 
smelter return value of each block has been calculated and is carried in the block model as a "Net 
Minegate Revenue" value.  In other words, all off site costs associated with the production of 
copper and gold have been accounted and a royalty of 1.8% included.  A typical bench plan 
showing the distribution of net smelter return values is shown in Figure 32 NSR Distribution 
Bench 1350.

The operating cost input parameters for the pit optimization are shown in Table 31 Pit 
Optimization Parameters.  The pit limit was determined using an operating cost basis for a 
27,500 tpd mill throughput rate.  As the Feasibility Study was nearing completion it became 
clear that the plant design will be capable of sustaining a higher throughput rate and final 
schedules were prepared for 30,000 tpd.  Changes were also made in mine equipment and 
operating philosophy whereby blasthole sizes and patterns were increased and shovel sizes were 
also increased and electrified.  This resulted in improved operating costs relative to optimization 
input parameters.

In large open pit mines it often takes many years to reach the botttom of a final development 
phase.  Typical sinking rates in these large mines may average up to 6 benches annually.  This 
means that in a deep pit where the ore is found at depth, waste stripping on upper level benches 
may take place many years ahead of the ore release at depth.  For the purposes of pit limit 
definition at Red Chris, pit limits were evaluated for both discounted and undiscounted cost and 
NSR values.  A discount rate of 12% was used to discount cost and revenue in 6 bench 
increments.  The discount factor detail is shown in Table 32 Discounting & Bench Operating 
Cost Increment.  The discounted pit limit is shown in the isometric drawing in Figure 33  Lerch 
Grossman Discounted Pit Limit.

The undiscounted and discounted pit limits are shown in the cross sections below in the Main 
Zone Pit area and the East Zone Pit area.  It is clear that the high grade deep resources of the East 
Zone are more sensitive to the effects of discounting.

18.2.6 Mine Design and Ore Reserves 
 
The open pit design was based upon measured and indicated resources and the economic 
parameters and design criteria listed in Section 18.2.5.  Internal pit phases were defined on the 
basis of increasing ore value and geometric consideration for future expansions with a minimum 
mining width of 80 m.  Solids models of the various phases are shown in Figure 36 Mine 
Development Phase Solids 
 
Figure 36 - Mine Development Phase Solids 

 
 

The mining sequence was established with the objective of mining the best grade ore material 
first at elevated cutoff grades while maintaining a relatively constant overall production rate.   
The pit optimization process identified the central areas of the East and West Zones as the most 
profitable and accessible for mining.  For reasons of geometry and phase volume the East Zone 
will be mined in three phases and the Main Zone in three phases.  The general sequence of phase 
development is shown in Figure 37 below.

The ore reserves have been reported at a $3.75/t net smelter return cutoff.  The selection of this 
cutoff level was based upon a pit rim decision for recovery of processing and general & 
administration onsite operating costs.  Low grade quantities have been segregated in the 
production schedule.  Material between $3.25/t net smelter return and $3.75/t was designated as 
low grade one (LG1) and separated for future processing if economic conditions improve beyond 
the levels assumed for this study.  Material with a net smelter return value above $3.75/t but less 
than the applied cutoff for a particular pit phase was designate low grade two (LG2).  The LG2 
material was scheduled to the East Stockpile area and reclaimed for processing in Year 17 
through Year 25. 
 
Dilution 
 
The block model for the resource estimate was developed using 20 m x 20 m x 15 whole blocks.  
Where post mineral dikes could be identified they were coded into the block model and excluded 
from the resource estimate.  The mining equipment to be employed at Red Chris is intended for a 
bulk mining method.  Grade control will be implemented to direct the various material types to 
their intended destinations.  It has been assumed that the resource model contains adequate 
inherent dilution to a selective mining unit (SMU) size of 20 m x 20 m x 15 m and that the 
equipment employed to drill and load this unit size has been included in the mine plan. 
 
Development Concept 
 
The East Zone and Main Zone pit development concept is presented in Figure 38 Mine 
Development Concept.  The plant will be located southeast of the open pit mine area.  The low 
grade stockpile will be located east of the mine area immediately north of the crusher.  The waste 
dump and lower grade stockpile material will be placed on the plateau area north of the open pit 
within the drainage area boundary marked in red above the tailings impoundment.

Main Zone Phase I 
 
The Main Zone Phase I Pit contains a total of 2.1 Mt of mill feed resources at an NSR cutoff of 
$8.50/t and 5.2 Mt of low-grade material that will be moved to stockpile. The pit will be 75 m 
deep and the ramp will be directed clockwise downward with a switchback and will exit to the 
south side of the pit.  This pit will be completed in Year 1. 
 
Main Zone Phase II 
 
The Main Zone Phase II Pit will be developed to provide 11.0 Mt of mill feed at an NSR cutoff 
of $8.50/t and 11.8 Mt of low-grade material that will be moved to stockpile.  A clockwise 
oriented ramp has been placed parallel to the ramp in the Phase I pit to simplify cross bench 
connection in the radially expanding pits of the Main Zone.  The pit will be 180 m deep.  It will 
be mined during Year 1 through Year 3.

Main Zone Phase IV 
 

The Main Zone Phase IV Pit will be developed to provide 36.6 Mt of mill feed at an NSR cutoff 
of $7.00/t and 29.3 Mt of low-grade material that will be moved to stockpile.  The pit will be 360 
m deep.  It will be mined during Year 5 through Year 10. 
 
Figure 42 - East & Main Zone Phase IV Development 

 
 
Main Zone Phase V 
 
The Main Zone Phase V Pit will be developed to provide 61.6 Mt of mill feed at an NSR cutoff 
of $4.50/t and 12.60 Mt of low-grade material that will be moved to stockpile.  The pit will be 
465 m deep.  It will be mined during Year 6 through Year 15. 
 
18.2.7 Mining Method 
 
The mining method proposed for the Red Chris Project is conventional open pit shovel and truck 
operation using electric and/or diesel powered equipment.  As described in the Section above, 
mining will commence simultaneously in the starter pit areas of the East Zone and Main Zone.  
Expansion pits will then be developed in four more phases in the Main Zone and three phases in 
the East Zone, for a total of nine phases.  Ore will be hauled by 230t trucks to the primary 
crusher.  Waste and low-grade ore will be hauled to dumps and temporary stockpiles as required. 
 
Drilling & Blasting 
 
The drilling requirements are dictated by a combination of logistics, wall control and production 
blasting considerations.  Wall control blasting techniques will be used to maximise bench face 
angles and minimise stripping. 
 

The main components of the proposed blast design are perimeter blasting and main production 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 141 
December 16, 2004 

blasting.  Wall control buffer holes and production holes will be 311 mm in diameter.  Small 
diameter drill holes, 127mm, will be used for pre-split blasting for pit wall control. 
 
The main production drill hole spacing is dictated by the powder factor, bench height, sub-grade 
drilled and collar requirements.  Good fragmentation enhances overall mine efficiency in terms 
of material handling and equipment availability.  Using 311 mm holes, a powder factor of 
0.202 kg/t, an explosives column height of 10.5 m, a collar of 6.0 m and 1.5 m sub-grade, the 
resultant drill equivalent spacing on a square pattern is 11 m.  This equates to 5,082 t per hole 
blasted.  Heavy ANFO slurry, density of 1.29 gm/cm3, will be used exclusively, eliminating the 
problem of handling wet and dry holes differently if ANFO prills were used. 
  
A buffer row of reduced spacing and loaded length (lower powder factor) will be drilled between 
the production blast and final wall design.  The buffer row drilling requirements are based upon 
the pit perimeter lengths of rock exposed on each bench in each of the phase pushbacks. 
  
The recommended primary drilling unit is a 311 mm electric powered rotary blasthole drill 
capable of single pass drilling to 16.5 m with a bit loading of at least 50,000 kg.  Two production 
drills will be required in the mine.  An additional down-the-hole hammer drill, drilling 127mm 
vertical holes to 30m, will be used for wall control blasting. 
 
The blasting crew will require a rubber-tired skid steer loader for blasthole stemming.  An 
explosives supplier will deliver explosives to the boreholes, while the Red Chris blasting crew 
will have responsibility for priming, calculation of the quantity of slurry, stemming and blast 
initiation. 
 
Grade Control 
 
Grade control will primarily be based upon copper grade to ensure contractual commitments are 
met.  However gold grades are also considered in determining whether a block of material goes 
to the crusher or the low grade stockpile.  Blasthole samples will be taken by trained drillers 
supervised by grade control engineers and geologists.  
 
The blasthole patterns will be determined by the blasting engineer and transmitted wirelessly to a 
control station on the drill.  An on-board GPS locates the drill over each blast hole.  Drill hole 
assays of the cuttings will be entered into the mineral resource database to determine the copper 
and gold grades for each 20m x 20m x 15m block prior to mining.  The shovel operators and 
shift foremen will be provided with up to date digging plans, via live video monitors to ensure 
proper grade control to meet mill head grade requirements. 
 
Loading and Haulage 
 
The production rate during the first seven years of production will average approximately 
120,000 tpd of material moved.  This will decrease to approximately 30,000 tpd in Year 17 when 
the open pit is mined out and mining efforts focus on stockpile recovery. 
 
Ore, low-grade material and waste will be loaded in 230 t capacity trucks by two 38 m3 electric 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 142 
December 16, 2004 

cable shovels.  An 18 m³ front-end-loader will provide back up support to the electric shovels. 
 
Waste Disposal 
 
A total of 307.7 Mt of waste, 90.6 Mt of recoverable low-grade and 31.5 Mt of unrecoverable 
low-grade material will be placed in waste dumps and stockpiles.  PAG and NAG classifications 
have been established and used to estimate the global quantities of each material type.  NAG 
material will be used to provide "pads" upon which PAG waste and low-grade will be placed.  
These underliner pads will serve to provide an interface between the surface and the PAG 
material through which groundwater may travel.  Emphasis will be on placing the NAG in 
drainage courses underlying the dumps and stockpiles.  
 
Waste and low-grade material will be placed in 10 m lifts to provide an opportunity to achieve 
higher compaction.  Berms will be left on the perimeter of each lift effectively flattening the 
slopes and simplifying the reclamation of the final dump surface.  As recommended by O'Kane 
Consultants, the North Waste Dump will be sloped at 4:1 in the north, east and south directions 
and 2:1 in the westerly direction.  The top of the dump will be sloped to the southwest and 
surface drainage will be directed to a constructed valley leading to the existing drainage from 
this area.  A small till dam will be placed at the west end of the underlying saddle area beneath 
the dump directing drainage to the east.   Any water flowing thorough the dump will be directed 
to the open pit. 
 
The East Stockpile will be constructed with 2:1 slopes to reduce the overall footprint of the 
stockpile.  The stockpile will be reclaimed. 
 
18.2.8 Production Schedule  
 
Summary 
 
The mine will operate 7 days per week on a 12 hour 14 on 14 off - 28 day cycle typically found 
in remote British Columbia mines.   
 

The production schedule over life of mine has been prepared with the reserves tabled by bench 
and by phase.  The mining of the open pit phases will be overlapped to smooth the scheduled 
stripping and resultant equipment and manpower requirements. The mining plan will follow the 
following sequence; East Pit Phase I, Main Zone Phase I, East Pit Phase II, Main Pit Phases II 
and III, East Pit Phase III, Main Pit Phases IV and V, and East Pit Phase IV.  The production 
schedule is summarized in Table 35 Production Schedule Summary.  The annual material 
movement schedule is shown in Figure 43 Material Movement and the annual mill feed grades 
are shown in Figure 44  Head Grades.

Pre-production Development  
 
A pre-production period of approximately 3 months will be required to bring the East Zone and 
Main Zone Phase I pits to full production.  During this time, mining will open up ore in the 
starter pit areas and will release waste required for the primary crusher construction. 
 
Ore mined and stockpiled during pre-production will be used during startup and commissioning 
of the concentrator.   
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 151 
December 16, 2004 

Production Mining East Pit  
 
The East Pit Phase I will be pre-stripped during the preproduction period.  It is a relatively small 
pit and will be completed by Year 1.  Overburden is so thin over the pit areas that it has not been 
included in the resource model.  However, topsoil materials will be stockpiled for future use as 
reclamation cover on the waste dumps. 
 
The East Pit Phase II mining will commence in at the same time as Phase I but will follow a few 
benches behind in development with completion in Year 3.  
 
East Pit Phase III will commence in Year 3 and will be completed by Year 6.  The East Pit will 
then remain dormant until the Year 11 when the final Phase stripping will commence.  The 
access to the bottom of the East Pit Phase IV requires several switchbacks and mines out a 
portion of the final Main Zone Phase V Pit.  Some scavenging of pit bottom material has been 
scheduled using narrow ramps and excavator extraction. 
Production Mining Main Pit  
 
The development of the Main Zone Phase I Pit will also commence during pre-production period 
and will be completed by Year 1.   Phase II mining will commence in Year 2 and be completed 
by Year 6.  The typical vertical separation of Phase I and Phase II will be approximately 75 m. 
 
The Phase III pit will be mined during Year 2 through Year 5 with a one-year overlap with Phase 
II.  The average sinking rate is approximately 5 benches per year. 
 
The Phase IV Pit is a relatively large pit and will be mined from Year 5 through Year 10.   
 
The Phase V pit mining will commence a year later in Year 6 and will be completed by Year 15.  
This phase will typically be mined 8 benches behind the Phase IV Pit. 
 
Stockpile Recovery 
 
Stockpile recovery will be begin in Year 17 and will continue until Year 25.  The mining rate 
will be equal the processing rate of 30,000 tpd.  Although 92.5 Mt of low grade material was 
scheduled to be placed on the East Stockpile, the current schedule 90.6 Mt recovered.  The 
balance is assumed to be stockpile loss.

Drilling  
 
Drilling at the Red Chris Project will encounter a variety of rock types including some 
sedimentary units, volcanics, intrusives and post mineral dikes with various degrees of alteration.  
The average compressive strength is 80 MPa.  Moderate drill penetration rates and steel 
consumptions are to be expected.   
 
The estimates of drill requirements are based upon the drilling of 311 mm diameter production 
and buffer blastholes. The primary production drills at Red Chris should be capable of single 
pass drilling to 16.5 m with a bit loading of up to 50,000 kg.  Equipment suppliers have forecast 
of approximately 29 minutes for a 16.5 m hole.  Based on this penetration rate and the estimated 
tonnage blasted per hole, only 24 holes per day are required on average to maintain production.  
This could easily be accomplished by one drill.  However due to the phased pit design with mine 
development occurring simultaneously in two separate pits, two primary blasthole drills will be 
required. 
 
A down-the-hole hammer, hydraulic drill, capable of drilling 127mm holes to 30m is provided 
for wall control drilling.  This drill can also provide backup support to the primary drill units if 
required. 
 
Loading 
 
The mining of 9 open pit phases over a period of 17 years will require as many as three active 
work areas in certain schedule overlap years.  The pit phasing has been designed to permit the 
mining of high-grade ore from depth to blend with lower grade material from the upper benches 
of the expansion pits. 
 
The loading fleet will consist of two 38.0 m3 electric cable shovels capable of loading the 230 t 
haulage units with three passes.   The shovels will be supported by an 18 m3 wheel loader. 
 
When the open pit has been exhausted the shovels will be moved to the stockpile areas. 
 
Hauling 
 
Trucks in the 230 tonne class with 1700 kW engines are well suited to the hauls and operating 
conditions that will be encountered at the Red Chris Project.  The selected truck fleet matches the 
loading units and the overall haulage profiles which are designed with adverse grades to 10%.  
These trucks can be fully loaded by the shovels in 3 passes and the loader in ~7 passes.  Five 
trucks will be required in the preproduction period with additions to the fleet made as required.  
This increases to a maximum of 12 units in year 5 and remains at this level until active mining 
within the pit ceases.  The increasing haul distance as the pit deepens and the height of the waste 
dump increases is offset by a commensurate decrease in stripping ratio, thus enabling a constant 
truck fleet size to be maintained. 
 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 155 
December 16, 2004 

Support Equipment 
 
The following complement of road construction and maintenance equipment will support the 
mine operations: 
 

• Three 205 kW class road graders will maintain roads on the property, including the 
23km-long mine access road; 

• One 100 t class water truck and one 100 t class sand truck are included; 
• Four Track dozers of the 425 kW class will be used for typical dozer functions including 

maintenenace of dumps, drill site preparation, road building, ditching, bench repair, 
shovel cleanup and stockpile dozing.  A rubber-tired dozer of the 336 kW class is 
included for the majority of the lighter dozer work such as shovel cleanup and road 
sweeping; 

• Diesel pickup trucks will be supplied for the Mine Superintendent, Maintenance 
Superintendent, Shift Foreman, Blaster, Engineering, Surveyors and the mechanical crew.  
A total of 8 units are provided for initially; 

• Maintenance support vehicles and equipment will include a tire handler; flat deck trucks; 
fuel, water and lube trucks for servicing shovels; welding truck; and 

• Miscellaneous vehicles such as an excavator, lighting towers are also provided for the 
support of mine operations. 

 
Mine Dewatering 
 
Direct precipitation of rain and snow and groundwater inflows will be the major sources of water 
in pit areas.  Diversion ditches will be located above the open pit areas to intercept water flows to 
the maximum extent possible.  This water will be redirected to the tailings impoundment, or 
diverted to existing natural drainages. 
 
Groundwater pressures in the pit walls will be reduced, if necessary, by means of horizontal 
drain holes drilled from the bench floor during mining.  The precise number of holes required 
will be determined by structural discontinuities and locations of perched water tables 
encountered during mining.  At this stage, the requirement for pit wall dewatering/de-
pressurization has not been determined.    
 
Mine dewatering will be carried out using diesel powered submersible pumps installed in sumps 
at the bottom of the pit.  Water will be pumped from the open pits and discharged into the fresh 
water tank for use in the mill with any excess being discharged to the TMF. 
 
18.2.10   Mine Workforce

18.2.11   Explosives Use and Handling 
 
The mine explosives will be stored in two separate areas close to the open pit.  The explosives 
plant office and garage, ammonium nitrate silos and emulsion tank will be stored within a fenced 
compound to be located in accordance with the British Table of Distances.  The storage facility 
will accommodate up to 20,000 kg of emulsion. 
 
A powder magazine will house all high velocity explosives.  The magazine will be bullet proof, 
fire resistant, theft-resistant, weatherproof, well ventilated, and conform to standards set by the 
department of Energy Mines and Resources Canada. 
 
The Company will contract with an explosives supplier to provide the facilities.  Bulk explosives 
will be purchased on an "in-the-hole" basis based on the requirements as determined by the

18.3.1 Site Development 
 
The Red Chris property is located about 18 km southeast of the village of Iskut and 80 km south 
of Dease Lake on the north-facing Todagin Plateau between Ealue and Kluea Lakes in 
northwestern British Columbia.  It is approximately 450 km north of the town of Smithers. The 
deep-sea port of Stewart is situated about 200 km due south, and about 320 km by road.  The 
property is centered on latitude 57°  42' North, longitude 129° 47' West within NTS map sheet 
104H/12W, Liard Mining Division. 
 
The Red Chris property is situated on the eastern portion of the Todagin upland plateau, which 
forms a subdivision of the Klastine Plateau along the northern margin of the Skeena Mountains.  
Elevations on the property are typically 1,500 +/- 30m with relatively flat topography broken by 
several deep creek gullies. 
 
Bedrock exposure is confined to the higher-relief drainages and along mountainous ridges.  
A thin layer of glacial till covers the majority of the property. 
 
The process facilities and ancillary facilities will be located on a benched platform located 
immediately to the east of the open pit. The platform will be formed by a localized sidehill cut to 
fill and cut to waste operation. The volumes of cut to fill and cut to waste will be in the order of 
263,000 m3 and 280,000 m3 respectively. The estimate also allows for the construction of 10 km 
of on site service roads. 
 
18.3.2  Services & Utilities 
 
18.3.2.1 Fresh Water System 
 
The fresh water system has been designed to supply up to 120 m3/hr of make up water.  It will be 
supplied from a series of ten wells located downstream of the north seepage dam and a series of 
five wells located downstream of the south seepage dam, as shown on the site layout drawing. 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 158 
December 16, 2004 

AMEC conducted a single pump test of the aquifer in 2004 yielding approximately 20 m3/hr over 
a 3-day period without noticeable drawdown effects. The wells will be approximately ten metres 
deep, spaced at 100 metre intervals and at about elevation 1040m.  
 
The fresh water will be pumped from these wells via a 150mm diameter pipeline, 9.9 km long, to 
a tank and booster pump station located part way up the hill and adjacent to the tailings and sand 
splitter box at elevation 1340m. From here the water will be pumped to a 9 metre diameter by 9.6 
metre high fresh/fire water tank located at the millsite at elevation 1438m. The pipeline will be a 
buried pipeline for frost protection and will follow the planned service road between the mill and 
tailings impoundment. 
 
18.3.2.2 Fire Water 
 
The fresh / fire water tank at the plant has been designed to store a two hour fire water demand at 
350 m3/hr 
 
A firewater pump skid complete with diesel driven fire pump, jockey pump and controls will be 
installed.  A fire loop complete with hydrants will also be provided.  The 100 tonne capacity 
mine water truck will also be available for fire fighting duties. 
 
18.3.2.3 Potable Water 
 
A potable water well or wells to be installed in a suitable location in close proximity to the 
accommodation camp and mill site;  
 
 The potable water tank, water treatment plant and distribution system have been designed based 
upon a maximum design population of 200 and an average daily demand per capita equal to 284 
litres per day. The water treatment plant will also comprise a chlorination system. Nominal 
potable water use is estimated to be 2.5 m3/hour 
 
18.3.2.4 Process Water 
 
Process water will be used primarily in the grinding, flotation and regrind circuits. Reclaim water 
from the tailings impoundment will be used to provide all process water requirements. Two 
stages of pumping is required to reclaim water from the tailings pond to the plant site. A reclaim 
barge equipped with vertical turbine pumps will reclaim water from the tailings pond and pump 
the water to a booster station located on shore. From there, the water will be pumped using 
vertical pumps to the process water tank located at the plant site. 
 
18.3.2.5 Sewage Treatment 
 
The sewage treatment plant will be supplied with the Permanent Camp. The site sewage 
treatment facilities will consist of a packaged wastewater treatment plant (Filterbox LCU or 
similar type unit) designed for the following criteria: 
 

 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 159 
December 16, 2004 

Flow: 45 m3/day  (174 person capacity camp) 

Design BOD5 loading is 500 mg/L up to max 25 kg/day 

Design TSS loading is 500 mg/L 

Design Oil and Grease 80 mg/L 

 

Treated Effluent Criteria  

CBOD5  20 mg/L 

TSS  20 mg/L 

TFC  <200/100 ml 

Based on 30-day average of composite samples. 

 
The treatment process proposed is extended aeration activated sludge biological treatment. Two 
parallel process trains are proposed with each designed to be installed within a 10' wide x 60' 
long prefabricated industrial trailer. 
 
The influent wastewater is collected within lift stations from which it is pumped to the two 
sewage process trains.  The influent wastewater is directed to the inlet of the solids separation 
tank to trap settled solids as well as oil and grease.  The wastewater then flows into the 
Anoxic/EQ tank that attenuates the peak flows and pre-mixes the influent wastewater with return 
activated sludge from the aeration tank. From the anoxic/EQ tank the wastewater is pumped into 
the aeration tank. 
 
The main treatment is performed by the activated sludge process within the aeration tank.  The 
extended aeration activated sludge process is a suspended growth biological treatment.   The 
process utilizes aerobic (oxygen using) bacteria to remove organic contaminants through a 
process of biological oxidation.  The air required to meet the oxygen demands of the system and 
to provide the mixing of the mixed liquor suspended solids is supplied via a central blower 
system and fine pore bubble diffusers.  The wastewater flows from the aeration tank to a 
secondary clarifier that settles out the biological solids and skims off any residual oil and grease. 
The solids are recycled to the activated sludge system to maintain the mixed liquor suspended 
solids concentration in the aeration tank or pumped to the solids holding tank. 
 
The clarified effluent flows from the clarifier to an effluent holding tank from which it is pumped 
through a cartridge filter for final effluent polishing prior to discharge.  This provides an 
additional measure of process safety in case of a process upset condition.  Filtered effluent is 
then disinfected using UV radiation.  The Filterboxx LCU extended aeration package sewage 
treatment plant is capable of providing effluent with BOD5 and TSS well below typical 
regulatory requirements of 20 mg/L BOD and 20 mg/L TSS. 
 
The treated wastewater from the site sewage treatment plant will be pumped to the tailings 
impoundment by way of the final mill tailings pump box.

18.5  Environmental Considerations 
 
18.5.1  Environmental Assessment and Permitting 
 
British Columbia's Environmental Assessment Act requires that certain large-scale project 
proposals undergo an environmental assessment before they can proceed.   
 
Proposed mining developments that exceed the threshold criteria laid out in the Reviewable 
Project Regulation are required to obtain an environmental assessment certificate from the BC 
Environmental Assessment Office (BC EAO) before any development related permits, licences 
or approvals may be issued.  The Red Chris Project's anticipated extraction of 30,000 tonnes of 
ore per day, or 10.95 million tonnes per annum, exceeds the threshold limit of 250,000 tonnes 
per year established under the Regulation and therefore will require an environmental assessment 
certificate. 
 
The EA process involves six stages, starting with determining how the assessment will be 
conducted, through preparation, review and approval of Terms of Reference for the Application 
Report, preparation and submission of the Application report, review of the Application report, 
preparation of the EA Assessment report by the BC EAO followed by reference to the 
appropriate provincial ministers for a decision, culminating in a decision to either issue or not 
issue an EA Certificate.  The decision to approve a mining project is made jointly by the 
Provincial Ministers of Energy and Mines, Sustainable Resource Management; and Water, Land 
and Air Protection. 
 
The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ("CEAA") is triggered by Federal involvement in 
a project.  CEAA applies when a federal department or agency is required to make a decision on 
a proposed project. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency has made a determination 
that the Red Chris Project will require an environmental assessment under CEAA.  The 
"Responsible Authorities" under CEAA will include the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
Natural Resources Canada.  
 
The Governments of Canada and British Columbia entered into the Canada-British Columbia 
Agreement on Environmental Assessment Cooperation on March 11, 2004. The BC EAO and 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) have indicated that it is their intention 
that the environmental assessment process for the Red Chris project will undergo a single, 
cooperative assessment as provided for in this agreement.  It is intended that the Assessment 
Report prepared by the BC EAO will be written to serve both the needs of the Federal and 
Provincial environmental assessment process.   
 
Red Chris Development Company ("RCDC") submitted its Project Description for the Red Chris 
project to initiate the Environmental Assessment process with the BC EAO on October 27, 2003. 
The Project Description provided a conceptual level outline of RCDC's plans to develop an open 
pit copper-gold mining and milling operation on Todagin Plateau in North-western BC near the 
village of Iskut with construction scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2005 and operations 
by the fourth quarter of 2006. 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 164 
December 16, 2004 

The EAO subsequently issued an Order under Section 10(1)(c) of the BC Environmental 
Assessment Act S.B.C. 2002, c.43 (BCEAA) on November 26, 2003 determining that the Project 
constitutes a Reviewable Project under Part 3 of the Reviewable Projects Regulation (BC Reg. 
370/02). As such an environmental assessment certificate will be required pursuant to the 
BCEAA prior to the project proceeding. 
 
Draft Terms of Reference were developed by RCDC in accordance with the BCEAA in order to 
define the information requirements necessary for inclusion in an Application for an 
Environmental Certificate and submitted to the BC EAO in March 25, 2004. Comments on these 
Terms of Reference were subsequently received from a number of federal, provincial and local 
government agencies. Revised Terms of Reference for the Application for the project 
incorporating the comments received were submitted to the BC EAO on May 12, 2004. Final 
Terms of Reference were subsequently submitted on June 18, 2004 and approved by the BC 
EAO.  
 
The BC EAO issued an Order under Section 11 of the Act on August 4, 2004 setting out the 
scope, procedures and methods to be used for the environmental assessment of the Red Chris 
Project. 
 
RCDC subsequently compiled and submitted its Application for an Environmental Assessment 
Certificate to the BC EAO on September 15, 2004, initiating the 30 day screening period. 
Following receipt and incorporation of review comments the Final Application was submitted on 
November 2, 2004, initiating a 180 day review period scheduled for completion on or before 
April 30, 2005, at which time a recommendation will be made to the Ministers for a decision 
within 45 days.  
 
Under the Concurrent Permitting Regulation, a proponent may request that some provincial 
approval applications be processed concurrently with the environmental assessment. In that case, 
the agency responsible for the approval must make a decision relating to issuing the approval 
within a specified time frame after certification.  
 
In conjunction with its EA Application, RCDC applied for concurrent permitting in accordance 
with the Concurrent Approval Regulation (B.C. Reg. 371/2002) for licenses, permits and 
approvals which are key to initial construction activity scheduled to commence in early 2005, 
including the following: 
 

• All licenses, permits and approvals related to the construction and operation of the mine 
site access road, including a Special Use Permit, a licence to cut, and a Mines Act Permit 
for that portion on mineral claims; 

• A Mines Act Permit for pre-production site construction activity, including the 
development and use of a construction aggregate quarry construction of site roads, 
foundation excavations for the mill, crusher and maintenance facilities, diversion ditches, 
coffer and starter dams in the tailings impoundment facility and other initial construction 
related activity. 

 
Under the Concurrent permitting regulation, these permits will be required to be issued within 60 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 165 
December 16, 2004 

days of the Ministers decision on certification of the project. Additional permits, licenses and 
approvals required for construction and operation of the mine will be applied for as development 
planning proceeds and additional information becomes available through detailed design and 
engineering. 
 
18.5.2  Land Use Planning 
 
The Red Chris Project lies within the area covered by the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and 
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) which received BC Cabinet approval in October of 2000. 
The Cassiar Iskut-Stikine LRMP encompasses 5.2 million hectares in north-western British 
Columbia.  The plan represents the consensus reached as a result of a three-year interest based 
negotiation process that involved approximately 25 public, First Nations, and provincial 
government representatives. 
 
The Red Chris Project falls within the Todagin Zone of the LRMP.  The Todagin zone comprises 
a large area that includes Todagin Plateau and Tsatia Mountain.  The eastern boundary extends to 
the tree line of the Klappan drainage.  The management intent for the Todagin Zone is to 
integrate management for Stone's sheep and other wildlife, recreational activities, mineral 
exploration, mine development and reclamation.  The zone has been recommended for 
designation as a wildlife management area. 
 
While the LRMP recommends that the Todagin Zone be designated as a Wildlife Management 
Area (WMA), the Red Chris copper/gold project was excluded from the WMA and road access 
was acknowledged as being a required and appropriate activity within the context of the overall 
management goals and objectives.  
 
The zone provides habitat for a major Stone's sheep population.  Other wildlife species include 
mountain goats, grizzly, wolves, moose, caribou, marmots and raptors.  The area also has high 
recreation values for hiking, wildlife viewing and bow hunting (including guided hunting trips). 
 
The LRMP states: "The northern portion of the zone, which encompasses Todagin Plateau, has a 
very high mineral potential and includes the Red Chris Project.", and "Because of its proximity 
to the community of Iskut, development of the Red Chris deposit has the potential to provide 
significant local economic benefits."  
 
The LRMP establishes the following objective for the Todagin Zone: "To conserve Stone's 
sheep populations and habitat and other wildlife values integrated with mineral exploration and 
development." 
 
The LRMP contains the following recommendations relating to management of the Todagin 
Zone: 
 
With the exception of the Red Chris property, this zone will be designated as a Wildlife 
Management Area (WMA) with the following conditions: 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 166 
December 16, 2004 

• Mineral exploration and mine development and associated access continue to be 
recognized as appropriate activities; 

• Fully integrate the management of wildlife, mineral exploration and mine development 
north of Todagin Creek. South of Todagin Creek, mineral exploration and mine 
development are acceptable activities, with maintenance of wildlife values as the primary 
consideration; 

• Current approval processes will continue i.e., there will still be a one-window approach to 
project approval with consultation between the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the 
Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection; 

• Locate road access, mining camps and other infrastructure away from critical habitats. 
Only consider exceptions to this strategy after fairly assessing and weighing all 
implications (ecological, economic and safety); 

• Where mineral deposits occur and mine development proceeds within mapped critical 
habitat; 

• Design development to minimize impacts to habitat during operations; and 
• Fully reclaim habitat in a timely manner (on an ongoing basis and when operations are 

completed). 
 
If mine development is proposed, the following should be included as part of the approval 
process: 

• Complete baseline inventories of wildlife population and habitat; 
• Incorporate a mountain ungulate monitoring plan as part of issuing mine permits; 
• Address potential for copper toxicity in Stone's sheep; and 
• When operations are finished, fully rehabilitate mine sites and roads with native species 

ecologically suited to the area and palatable to local wildlife species. 
• Locate road access, mining camps and other infrastructure away from existing tourism 

facilities. 
• Consult fully with the public, including local residents and the LRMP Monitoring 

Committee, regarding any new road locations. 
• Provide access controls, including staffed gates, where needed, to manage public access 

to the plateau area; and 
• Permanently deactivate roads upon completion of operations.   

 
RCDC's Application for an Environmental Assessment Certificate has incorporated management 
and mitigation measures designed so as to meet the goals and objectives of the Cassiar Iskut-
Stikine LRMP. 
 
18.5.3  First Nations 
 
The Red Chris property is located in a geographically isolated and sparsely populated area of the 
Northwest Region of British Columbia, and within the Traditional Territory of the Tahltan and 
Iskut First Nations.  The communities in the area are considered remote and include Iskut, Dease 
Lake and Telegraph Creek. 
 
First Nations community members have used and continue to use the area around the Red Chris 
property to carry out traditional activities such as hunting, trapping and harvesting of a variety of 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 167 
December 16, 2004 

plant species for consumptive and medicinal purposes. 
 
The closest community to the Red Chris property is Iskut (pop. 300), home to the Iskut First 
Nation, 18 km north of the property. Dease Lake (pop. 661) and Telegraph Creek (pop. 296), 
home to the Tahltan First Nation, are located 80 km north and 85 km to the west-northwest of the 
property, respectively. The total population of the Region on May 15, 2001 (Census Day) was 
1,316. 
 
The Tahltan people, particularly through the Tahltan Nation Development Corporation since its 
inception in 1985, have been active in mining and contracting operations within their traditional 
territory for many years, including at the Golden Bear and Eskay Creek mines.  Through these 
employment and associated training opportunities, the Tahltan have developed a well-trained and 
experienced workforce upon which RCDC hopes to draw a significant portion of its employees. 
 
RCDC initiated and has maintained regular communication with representatives of the Tahltan 
and Iskut First Nations beginning prior to the commencement of exploration activity in 2003.  
 
On January 19, 2004 RCDC executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tahltan First 
Nation, the Iskut First Nation, and the Tahltan Central Council. This document sets out the 
principals for joint cooperation on the project development and operation between RCDC and 
the First Nations, including minimizing impacts on traditional use. Discussions have been 
initiated with the First Nations with regard to their involvement in the development of the project 
and the most appropriate means of ensuring that economic benefits accrue to the Tahltan people 
within whose traditional territory the mine is located. 
 
The Tahltan and Iskut First Nations have been included throughout the Environmental 
Assessment Process being led by the BC Environmental Assessment Office. A series of Open 
Houses were conducted in the local communities of Stewart, Iskut, Dease Lake and Telegraph 
Creek in both May and December, 2004.  
 
18.5.4  Reclamation and Closure 
 
Under the B.C. Mines Act and the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for British Columbia, 
the primary objective of the reclamation plan will be to return where practical all areas disturbed 
by mining operations to their pre-mining land use and capability.  
 
The following goals are implicit in achieving this primary objective: 

• The long-term preservation of water quality within and downstream of de-commissioned 
operations; 

• The long-term stability of engineered structures, including the waste rock dumps, open 
pit and tailings impoundment; 

• The removal and proper disposal of all access roads, structures and equipment that will 
not be required after the end of the mine life; 

• The long-term stabilization of all exposed erodable materials;  



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 168 
December 16, 2004 

• The natural integration of disturbed areas into the surrounding landscape, and the 
restoration of a natural appearance to the disturbed areas after mining ceases, to the best 
practical extent; 

• The establishment of a self-sustaining cover of vegetation that is consistent with existing 
forestry and wildlife needs. 

 
A conceptual Reclamation and Closure Plan was presented in Section 6.8 of the Application for 
an Environmental Assessment Certificate (AEAC). 
 
The primary goals of the Reclamation and Closure Plan for the Red Chris site will be: 

• to prevent degradation of the environment, and  
• to enhance the natural recovery of areas affected by mining.  

 
In order to achieve these goals, the specific objectives of the plan will be:  

• to ensure that mine facilities, mine waste disposal sites and tailings areas will be closed in 
such a manner that the requirement for long-term maintenance and monitoring is 
minimized.  

• to identify potential sources of contaminants and to prevent the release of contaminants or 
wastes to the environment.  

• to return affected areas to a state compatible with original undisturbed conditions, 
considering such practical factors as economics, aesthetics, future productivity, and future 
users.  

 
Before exploration began in the Red Chris Project area, the principal land uses were wildlife 
habitat that supported hunting, guide outfitting, trapping and some general outdoor recreation. 
  
The goal of land reclamation program at Red Chris will be the creation of conditions which will 
promote the establishment of a self-sustaining wilderness environment that is consistent with 
surrounding land use potential and compatible with the original undisturbed conditions. The two 
major components of the restoration program will be erosion control and re-vegetation. 
 
To the extent practical, surface drainage will be directed back to original watercourses. Where 
this is not practical, new channels will be excavated to supplement natural watercourses. All such 
excavations will be backsloped, re-contoured and rip-rapped as necessary to stabilize banks and 
control erosion. All works will be designed to minimize the need for future maintenance. 
 
Where necessary, disturbed slopes will be treated to maintain an acceptable degree of stability, 
prevent erosion and facilitate natural re-vegetation to a state compatible with original conditions. 
Reclamation prescriptions will include native species ecologically suited to the area and 
palatable to local wildlife species. 
The reclamation plan aims to achieve the following land use objectives: 
 

• To restore the area disturbed by development of the waste rock dumps into a mixed 
vegetated area with similar use and productivity to that currently in existence in these 
areas; 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 169 
December 16, 2004 

• To restore the area disturbed by the plant site facilities and accommodation camp into a 
revegetated area with similar use and productivity to that currently in existence in these 
areas; 

• To restore the tailings impoundment into a self sustaining shallow pond environment with 
broad revegetated beaches in front of the upstream face of the North and Main dams with 
4H:1V revegetated slopes on the downstream dam faces. 

 
The objective will be over time to achieve similar productivity in vegetation mix and growth 
rates to the productivity rates that currently existing in these areas. The end objective is to permit 
future wildlife use on this reclaimed land similar to that observed in the pre-development period. 
 
The preliminary projected total disturbed area associated with the development and operation of 
the Red Chris mine is estimated at 995 ha, including: 

• Open pit   110 ha 
• Tailings impoundment 465 ha 
• Waste rock dump  220 ha 
• Low grade stockpile area 70 ha 
• Site access roads  25 ha 
• Borrow areas   80 ha 
• Plant site   25 ha 

 
Progressive reclamation will be undertaken over the life of the mine in order to minimize the 
outstanding reclamation liability at the end of the mine life. At the end of the mine life all 
buildings and structures will be removed, foundations removed or cracked and buried and 
disturbed areas re-contoured, capped with suitable growth medium and re-vegetated with 
appropriate species compatible with the surrounding environment. 
 
A breakdown of the estimated cost to complete the anticipated reclamation and closure activity at 
the end of the planned mine life was included in the Addendum to the AEAC report. The 
Preliminary Reclamation Cost Estimate of $10.2 million was based on the currently envisioned 
mine plan and concepts developed for reclamation of the various components which make up the 
Project.  
 
It is anticipated that the Reclamation and Closure Plan, and the associated costs, will be refined 
over the mine life in response to adjustments in the mine plan, the results of reclamation 
research, evolving technology and other such factors. Such refinements will be presented in 
Annual Reclamation Reports and regular updates to the Mine and Reclamation Plan as required 
under the Permit Approving the Mine Plan and Reclamation Program to be issued for the mine 
development under the Mines Act. 
 
18.5.5  Environmental Impact Management 
 
RCDC's development plan and environmental impact assessment are based on an extensive 
database of environmental baseline studies conducted on and around the Red Chris property over 
the past decade. Initial fieldwork was undertaken at the property in 1994 and 1995 by Hallam 
Knight Piesold, and further detailed studies were continued through 1996 and 1997 by Rescan 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 170 
December 16, 2004 

Environmental Services. In addition to meteorology at the site, hydrology and water quality in 
the lakes and streams around the project area, the studies have also covered fisheries and aquatic 
life, wildlife and vegetation resources. The automated weather and hydrology stations continued 
to collect data through to 2000. 
 
As part of the planning to initiate mining development at the Red Chris deposit, RCDC 
contracted specialist consultants to consolidate and synthesize the environmental baseline 
information previously collected in the project area. This information has been incorporated into 
and forms the basis for the Environmental Assessment documentation.  
 
To compliment the extensive existing database, RCDC renewed the collection of baseline 
environmental data with studies commencing in the Fall of 2003 and continuing through the 
summer of 2004. These studies included additional wildlife surveys, water quality sampling, re-
establishment of hydrology stations, collection of samples for ARD testwork, fisheries surveys, 
terrestrial ecosystem mapping, surface and groundwater quality sampling, collection of 
additional hydrometric data and reestablishment of the on-site meteorological station.  The 
results from these additional studies were incorporated into the Application for an Environmental 
Assessment Certificate and the Addendum report submitted in November 2004. 
 
The assessment of potential environmental impacts has led to the development and presentation 
of a series of conceptual level plans to address operational aspects of the development such as:   
 

• Tailings Impoundment Operating Plan; 
• ARD/ML Prediction and Prevention Plan; 
• Materials Handling Plan; 
• Reclamation and Closure Plan; 
• Wildlife Management Plan; 
• Fish Habitat Compensation Plan; 
• Water Management and Sediment Control Plan; 
• Pollution Prevention Plan; 
• Spill Contingency and Emergency Response Plan; and 
• Waste management Plan. 

 
Each of these plans incorporates specific mitigation measures designed to address potential 
impacts associated with specific components of the development plan. 
 
18.5.6  Fish and Fish Habitat 
 
Baseline studies have indicated that the only fish species found to be resident within the lakes 
and streams within the immediate area surrounding the proposed Red Chris Project is rainbow 
trout. Rainbow trout are a relatively common species within the project area and the region in 
general.  No fish species other than rainbow trout have been identified within the Trail or Quarry 
Creek systems proposed for the tailings storage impoundment, or in any of the other streams 
immediately downstream of the project site. 
 
These studies have indicated that the upper reaches of Trail Creek where the proposed tailings 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 171 
December 16, 2004 

impoundment is to be located, including the small pond known as "Black Lake", are devoid of 
fish populations. However, a small population of rainbow trout are present downstream of the 
proposed tailings impoundment within the lower reaches of Trail Creek, up to and including the 
proposed location of the South Dam.  
 
RCDC commissioned additional fieldwork in the 2004 field season to assess, characterize and 
quantify fish habitat within creek systems draining the valley downstream of the proposed 
tailings impoundment. At the same time opportunities for habitat compensation were explored. 
The results of this work were reported in November 2004 in the addendum to the application 
report. This data has been used to quantify the potential for habitat alteration; disruption and/or 
destruction associated with the proposed project development and will form the basis for 
discussions of a proposed habitat compensation plan to be developed in association with DFO 
and WLAP. 
 
18.5.7  ARD and Metal Leaching 
 
An extensive geochemical database has been developed for the Red Chris Project. The results of 
this work have been used as a basis for geochemical characterization of all overburden, waste 
rock, ore and tailings materials to be generated in conjunction with the development of the Red 
Chris Project, and to develop prediction, prevention, mitigation and monitoring strategies for the 
project to deal with Acid Rock Drainage and Metal Leaching (ARD/ML) issues throughout the 
life of the mine and post-closure.  
 
The ARD static database for Red Chris consists of over 1000 Acid Base Accounting analyses 
with associated ICP total metal analyses, 5 – 20 day leach tests and detailed mineralogical 
examinations. As well, kinetic tests, such as humidity cells and column tests, have been 
undertaken to define potential sulphide oxidation and NP depletion rates over time, and the 
potential chemistry of resultant drainage from waste rock dumps and the tailings disposal area. In 
all, a total of 14 waste rock humidity cells, 9 columns and 15 tailings humidity cells have been 
initiated, many of which have been running for about a year. 
 
These programs of work have led to the development of a Material Handling Plan and an ARD 
Prediction and Prevention Plan designed to provide for the long term handling of all potentially 
acid generating materials. The testwork has demonstrated that the tailings can be produced to be 
Non-Acid Generating (NAG) and used in dam construction and to form upstream beaches to 
improve dam stability over the long term. The majority of waste rock, however, has been shown 
to display varying potential to oxidize and generate acidic runoff over a period of many decades 
and as such will require special handling consideration. 
 
Over the mine life it is projected that a total of 307 million tonnes of waste rock and 31.5 million 
tonnes of ultra low-grade ore (LG1) will be placed into the North waste rock dump for 
permanent storage. Of this total some 47 million tonnes is expected to be non-acid generating 
(NAG) rock. The remainder is expected to be potentially acid generating (PAG) with an 
estimated time to onset of acid generation in the order of several decades.  
 
In addition, 92.4 million tonnes of low-grade ore (LG2) will be placed to the east side of the 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 172 
December 16, 2004 

open pit in a separate area in close proximity to the crusher to facilitate the recovery of this 
material for subsequent milling once open pit mining is complete.  It is planned that this low-
grade ore will be reclaimed starting in year 17 of the mine life (once open pit mining ceases) and 
processed through the mill. It is expected that this material will be gone by the end of the 
planned mine life at the end of Year 25. 
 
In order to address issues relating to long term storage of PAG waste rock, a number of design 
considerations have been built into the waste rock storage site. The base of the North Waste 
Dump will be constructed of a thin layer of NAG waste rock where necessary to fill in any 
natural topographic depressions and drainages in order to ensure that surface or ground water 
passing under the dump does not come into direct contact with the PAG rock. An allowance for a 
NAG layer up to approximately 5m in thickness has been allowed for in the design.  PAG rock 
will then be placed onto the North Dump on top of the NAG rock base. By preventing direct 
contact of PAG rock with flowing water, the potential for flushing of oxidation products from the 
waste rock will be minimized.  
 
Waste and low-grade material will be placed in 10 m lifts to facilitate higher compaction thereby 
further limiting water infiltration into the dump.  Berms of 25 m in width will be left on the 
perimeter of each lift effectively flattening the slopes and simplifying the reclamation of the final 
dump surface. The North Waste Dump will be sloped at 4:1 in the north, east and south 
directions and 2:1 in the westerly direction.  The top of the dump will be sloped to the southwest 
and surface drainage will be directed to a constructed channel leading to the existing valley 
draining this area. Low grade LG2 material will be placed in the East Stockpile in close 
proximity to the crusher in order to facilitate reclaim and processing once mining operations 
cease. The East Stockpile will be constructed with 2:1 slopes to reduce the overall footprint of 
the stockpile.  
 
At closure the North Dump will be capped with a "store and release" vegetated soil cover 
(assumed to be 1 m of till) to shed as much "clean" precipitation runoff as possible from the 
surface of the North Dump.  The "clean" runoff would be directed away from the open pit.  The 
purpose of the cover is to minimize the amount of precipitation runoff infiltrating into the 
underlying dump thereby reducing the rate at which ARD and metal contaminants are flushed 
from the PAG rock. 
 
The North dump has been sited immediately to the north of the open pit so that all drainage from 
the dumpsite will flow by gravity into the tailings impoundment area via a constructed side hill 
diversion ditch during the mine's operational life.  At closure all seepage from the waste dump 
will be directed to the open pit for containment via a constructed drainage tunnel. It is expected 
that it will take in the order of 80-90 years for the open pit to fill. 
 
Prior to the water in the pit reaching a level whereby it would discharge to the environment, 
RCDC will control the pit lake level by pumping contaminated water from the pit to a new water 
treatment plant to be constructed near the proposed mill site. This treatment plant will utilize 
proven state-of-the-art technology, such as that which has been successfully demonstrated by 
Bioteq Technologies using a sulphur/sulphate reduction process, to recover metals from the pit 
water. RCDC will treat water from the pit lake annually, or as required, to prevent uncontrolled 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 173 
December 16, 2004 

discharge from the open pit until water quality within the pit reaches acceptable discharge 
quality.  This will only occur once all the sulphides within the waste rock dump and pit walls 
have fully oxidized and have released all of their net acidity (expected to be many years in the 
future, i.e., >100 years).  Provision for such a treatment plant has been built into the reclamation 
costing model for the project and financial security will be put aside to fund the construction and 
operation of such a plant. 
 
18.6  Capital and Operating Cost Estimates 
 
18.6.1  Capital Cost Estimates 
 
18.6.1.1 General 
 
Merit Consultants International Inc. (Merit) has been contracted by bcMetals Corporation to 
provide a Bankable Feasibility Study level of capital cost estimate that is considered to be within 
a 15% accuracy of actual costs. 

 
The total estimated cost to design and build the Red Chris Copper Project described in this report 
is $214,600,000 including an owner provided leased mining fleet and self-performed pre-
development. Capital cost estimate details are included in this section while supporting 
information is included in the Appendices.  Total capital, including working capital and initial 
funding of a surety bond for reclamation funding at mine closure, is estimated at $227.7 million. 

 
All costs are expressed in fourth quarter 2004 Canadian dollars incorporating a 1.19 Cdn to 1.00 
US dollar exchange (84 cents Cdn)   where appropriate. There are no allowances for escalation, 
interest during construction, taxes or duties. All due allowances have been considered for items 
such as: 

 
 Using actual productivity factors and unit prices from similar ongoing and previous projects 
 Understanding of the 'open shop' contracting environment in British Columbia at this time. 
 Using quantity take-offs provided by AMEC E & C Services Limited ("the engineer"). 
 Using capital equipment costs provided by the engineer. 
 Using the geotechnical information available to identify borrow sources for the tailings dams. 
 Using contractor budget costs for the power line and main access road provided by the 

Owner.

offs.  
 Using estimated Construction Management costs based on experience.  
 Assuming a spares allowance of 5% of the equipment costs. 
 Assuming a freight cost of 7% of the cost of the equipment and materials except earthwork 

and concrete materials.  
 Understanding of remoteness of project. 
 Concrete is batched on site and suitable aggregate is available locally. 
 Using a contingency of 25% for the earthworks, 5% for the capital equipment and 10% for 

all other items including labour.  
 

The estimate covers the direct field costs of executing this project, plus the indirect costs 
associated with design, procurement and construction efforts. Construction Management will be 
out-sourced to a competent company that specializes in such work.  

 
18.6.1.2 Basis of Estimate 
 
The capital cost estimate is based on the following project data: 
 
 design criteria 
 flow sheets 
 general arrangement drawings 
 single line electrical drawings 
 equipment list 
 budget quotations from vendors for major capital equipment and buildings 
 quotations from BC contractors  
 regional climatic data 
 in-house database 
 Pre-production mining undertaken by the Owner. 

 
For the purpose of this estimate, the Owner has undertaken to carry out the pre-production work 
themselves using a leased fleet of equipment and new truck shop. The owner will provide the 
fuel storage facilities and all associated mining components.   

 
The level of estimating accuracy and the contingency value have been based on the following 
premises: 

 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 175 
December 16, 2004 

 Labour rate is current and based on the combination of three British Columbian industrial 
contractors conversant with this kind of work.  

 Confirmation by qualified contractors that the labour rate is currently valid.  
 Main Access Road and Powerline work has been priced by competent contractors. 
 Vendor quotations have been received for all major equipment, generally from more than one 

vendor. The lowest qualified vendor price has been incorporated in the estimate.  
 Productivity factors are based on actual experience. 
 Material costs were obtained for the work.  
 Geotechnical information is available in areas of greatest earthwork risk. 
 AMEC (including AEE – AMEC Earth and Environmental) were responsible for providing 

all bulk material quantities for the processing and infrastructure facilities.  
 
18.6.1.3 Direct Costs 
 
18.6.1.3.1    Quantities 

 
The engineer provided material take-offs based project feasibility drawings other than for plant 
piping, electrical and instrumentation quantities which were based on percentages of mechanical 
equipment in each area.  

 
Civil - All earthworks quantities – including mine pre-production stripping - have been 
calculated in-situ with no allowance for bulking or compaction of materials.  

 
Concrete - Concrete quantities were determined from feasibility stage drawings and experience 
from previous projects of a very similar nature. The unit rates have been based on the assumption 
that local aggregates are available with an onsite batch plant.  

 
Formwork - Formwork was estimated for each type of concrete classification and includes 
supply, form oil, accessories and shoring, and stripping. No allowances have been made for re-
use of forms although this will happen and improve the concrete prices during construction.  

 
Reinforcing Steel - Reinforcing steel was calculated based on estimated weight per cubic metre 
of concrete for each type of classification based on projects of a very similar nature. The unit 
price includes the supply of material, cutting and bending on site, accessories and installation. 

 
Embedded Metal and Anchor Bolts - The unit price includes supply and installation of carbon 
steel material including sleeves and anchors.  

 
Structural Steel - Quantities were determined from feasibility stage drawings and experience 
from previous projects of a very similar nature. The weights shown include allowances for 
connections and base plates. The unit price includes steel purchase, detailing, fabrication and 
erection labour. 

 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 176 
December 16, 2004 

Mechanical Equipment - Most large capital equipment is assumed to have to be imported, and 
was itemized and priced in accordance with the flow sheets. Budget quotations were obtained for 
all major items based on preliminary specifications. 

  
Mechanical (Plate work and Tanks) - Plate work weights were calculated with allowances made 
for any necessary stiffeners, weirs, launders, etc. The unit prices include purchase, detailing, 
fabrication and installation. 

 
Piping - Factored allowances - as used on other projects developed by the engineer, have been 
used for in-plant pipe and calculations for overland pipe, and includes supply (not freight), shop 
and field fabrication, and installation with allowances for all hangers and supports.  

 
Electrical and Instrumentation - Allowances were based on one-line diagrams and connected 
loads detail provided on the flow sheets. Major electrical equipment has been assumed to be 
imported and prices were based on quotations. Bulk material prices were based on factored 
allowances provided by the engineer from other similar projects, and includes material supply 
(not freight) and installation. Lengths for overhead lines and high voltage cable were estimated 
from the overall site plan.  
 
18.6.1.3.2 Direct Field Labour      
 
Labour rates have been derived as a composite for a 60 hours per week, 6 days per week 
schedule including travel. The $62 per hour average wage rate is a combined rate for an 
estimated crew mix (supervision, skilled/unskilled labour) using the rates from three industrial 
construction contractors experienced as general contractors in the mining industry in British 
Columbia. The rate includes: 
 
 base labour wage rate 
 government (payroll) burdens 
 benefits including medical 
 small tools and consumables allowance 
 home office overheads 
 contractors' profit  

 
18.6.1.3.3          Direct Field Materials 
 
Bulk materials will be provided from centers in Canada, primarily Vancouver and Edmonton. 
Freight is included as a separate indirect cost line item.  
 
18.6.1.4 Indirect Costs 
 
18.6.1.4.1   Temporary Construction Facilities and Services 
 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 177 
December 16, 2004 

Contractors' field distributable costs allowed for in the capital cost estimate but not included in 
the built-up labour rate or owner's costs are as follows: 

 
 contractors' mobilization and demobilization 
 contractors' equipment 
 construction field offices, furnishings, equipment 
 contractor accommodations 
 temporary power supply 
 temporary water supply 
 temporary heating and hoarding 
 warehouse and laydown costs 
 temporary toilets 
 temporary communications 
 first aid personnel and supplies 
 on-going and final clean-up 
 yard maintenance 
 janitorial services 
 site safety personnel and training 
 material testing 

 
These indirect costs are not applicable to the major earthmoving costs, since unit prices 
submitted by contractors are "all-in" rates, inclusive of all direct and indirect costs. 
 
18.6.1.4.2 Construction Equipment 
 
It is expected that all construction equipment such as cranes, man lifts, welding machines, 
generators, will be leased and managed by the Owner's Construction Management group. An 
allowance for construction equipment has been made in the indirect accounts except for the 
earthworks and concrete scope where equipment is included in the contractor's unit rates with 
the exception of the concrete pump. Specifically, concrete supply unit prices include supply and 
operation of the site aggregate crushing, screening and batch plant as well as the concrete transit 
trucks.  

 
18.6.1.4.3 Construction Accommodation and Catering 
 
An allowance is included for the construction and operation of a 500 man camp based on a lease 
cost quoted by a reputable vendor. The camp kitchen is sized for the estimated peak man power. 
42 man bunkhouses will be installed as required when the work force increases, and demobilized 
as it decreases at the tail end of the project. The owner has elected, for the purposes of this study, 
to retain a portion of the camp on a lease basis, and use it for operations. Costs for catering 
services have been based on quotations.  
 
18.6.1.4.4 First Fill and Spare Parts 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 178 
December 16, 2004 

 
An allowance of 5% of the equipment purchase value has been included for spares, and an 
allowance commensurate with industry standards has been made for the purchase of start-up 
grinding media and reagents. 
 
18.6.1.4.5 Start-up and Commissioning 
 
An allowance has been made for retention of vendor representatives for start-up, as well as a 
selection of ten people from the contractor's crews and the construction management staff for a 
period of about 30 days.  
 
18.6.1.4.6 Freight 
 
A freight allowance of 7% of the material and equipment costs has been included for all 
materials and equipment associated with purchases.  

 
18.6.1.4.7       Owner's Costs 

 
Owner's costs have been developed in conjunction with the Owner and includes items such as: 

 
- All operating costs for the three-month pre-production period. 
- Insurances. 
- Head Office staff assigned to the project.  
- Owners allowances for field operations offices and supplies. 
- Owner's travel costs during construction.   
 
18.6.1.4.8 Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) 
 
Engineering, procurement and construction management costs for the project, as described in the 
project description, are based on information from previous similar projects for the engineering 
and procurement phase separately from the construction management phase of the work.  The 
engineering and procurement costs were derived by AMEC.  The construction management costs 
were derived by Merit.  
 
18.6.1.4.9 Taxes and Duties 
 
No taxes have been included, and it is assumed that much of it is available as a refund through 
recent initiatives enacted by the provincial government.  
 
18.6.1.5 Contingency 
 
The contingency amount is an allowance added to the capital cost estimate to cover 
unforeseeable costs within the scope of the estimate. This can arise due to presently undefined 



Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 179 
December 16, 2004 

items of work or equipment, or to the uncertainty in the estimated quantities and unit prices for 
labour, equipment and materials. Contingency does not cover scope changes, project exclusions 
or project execution strategy changes.   

 
Contingencies are included separately for the civil works, equipment and materials and the 
labour. Earthwork is considered to have the greatest risk and an allowance of 25% of the 
calculated costs has been assigned as a consequence.  

 
Additional contingencies include 5% on the capital equipment, and 10% allowed on the 
remainder of the direct and indirect estimates.   

 
18.6.1.6 Exchange Rates 
 
All estimates herein are quoted in fourth quarter 2004 Canadian dollars.   The CDN$ : US$ 
exchange rate is  CDN$1.19 = US$1.00. 

 
18.6.1.7 Assumptions 
 
The following assumptions were made in preparing the estimate: 
 
 Construction work is based on unit and fixed price contracts. 
 Concrete aggregate and suitable backfill material are available locally and good potential 

areas were identified during the project team site visits. 
 Actual soil bearing conditions will be adequate for the requirements of foundations included 

in the estimate. This has been confirmed through the surficial geology assessment, including 
drilling and test pitting, made by the Owner based on their intimate knowledge of the area.  

 Construction activities will be carried out in a continuous program with no allowance for 
demobilization and remobilization. 

 The tailings area contains suitable and adequate borrow sources for the dams to be 
constructed.  

 
18.6.1.8    Capital Cost Exclusions 
 
The following are excluded from the $214.6 million project capital estimate although some 
items, e.g. working capital, reclamation bond funding are included in its Total Project Cost 
estimation. 
 
 Escalation  
 Scope changes 
 Interest during construction 
 Schedule delays and associated costs such as those caused by: 

- scope change 
- unidentified ground conditions

- extraordinary climatic events 
- labour disputes 
- permit applications  
- receipt of information beyond the control of EPCM contractors 

 Cost of financing 
 Property costs and taxes 
 Sunk costs 
 Taxes 
 Sustaining capital 
 Permitting costs 

 
18.6.1.9  Working Capital 
 
Working capital of 1.5 months of Year 1 estimated mine site operating costs ($9.0 million) has 
been included in the initial funding requirements.  In Year 2 an additional 0.5 months ($3.0 
million) has been budgeted under sustaining capital requirements. 

 
18.6.1.10 Reclamation Bond Funding 

 
Initial capital includes a provision of $1.4 million to fund a surety bond to meet estimated 
funding requirements for mine closure reclamation at the end of mine life currently estimated to 
be in Year 25.  The reclamation funding plan also assumes that funds received from the salvage 
of the mine equipment, process plant and other infrastructure will also be applied to reclamation 
funding. 

 
18.6.1.11    Sustaining Capital 
 
Over the mine life it is estimated that an additional $138.3 in sustaining capital will be required.  
This covers such items as: 

 
 Additional and replacement mine equipment 
 Other capital requirements, including construction of the centre till core of the tailings dam, 

expected to be performed by a contractor. 
 
The major component of this sustaining capital estimate is for additional and replacement mine 
equipment as detailed in Section 18.2.

The process plant operating costs cover all unit operations, including fresh, potable and process 
water systems. 
 
These costs include labour, consumables, power and maintenance with budgetary figures from 
representative vendors. 
 
Power is based on $0.02787 per kW-hr plus a demand charge of 40,000 maximum kVA at 
$4.73/kVA as supplied from the main BC Hydro grid with the mine tie-in at Tatogga. 
 
Total manpower for the plant, including supervision, technical, operations and maintenance is 
estimated at 77 people.  
 
18.6.2.3    Mine 
 
The mine operating costs per tonne of material moved and per tonne of ore have been assembled 
from labour, consumables and maintenance for drilling & blasting, loading, material haulage, 
stockpiling, and property road maintenance. 
 
The open pit will operate for approximately 17 years.  Ore will be crushed while low grade and 
waste will be stockpiled separately.  Following exhaustion of the pit resources, the mine 
operation will be scaled down to re-handling of the stockpiled material only, for the final 8 years. 
 
Total manpower for the mine operation, including supervision, technical, operations and 
maintenance will vary from 133 in year 1 to a high of 181 in year 7 and range from 24 – 28 in

the final years of stockpile re-handle. 
 
18.6.2.4    Realization Costs 
 
The realization costs used in the cash flow model total US$0.35/lb Cu and include the following: 
 
Trucking to port, port storage, ship loading, draft survey, umpire sampling,  
ocean freight, treatment charge, refining charge, price participation, 
losses, and insurance. 
 
18.7 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
The Red Chris Project has been valued using a discounted cash flow approach.  This method of 
valuation requires projecting yearly cash inflows, or revenues, and subtracting yearly cash 
outflows such as operating costs, capital costs, royalties, and taxes.  The resulting net annual 
cash flows are discounted back to the date of valuation and totaled to determine Net Present 
Values (NPVs) at the selected discount rates.  The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is calculated as 
the discount rate that yields a zero NPV. 
 
Section 18.7.1 summarizes the input data used in the base case cash flow analysis.  The results of 
the base case and sensitivity economic analysis are then presented in Section 18.7.2.  This 
analysis includes sensitivities to variation in copper and gold prices, head grades, metallurgical 
recoveries, operating costs, capital costs, concentrate transportation costs, and smelting and 
refining charges. 
 
All amounts are presented in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
 
18.7.1 Basis of Economic Analysis 
 
18.7.1.1 Ore Reserves and Mine Life 
 
The base case economic analysis includes the following life of mine ore reserves: 
 

Total ore milled 276.0 million tonnes 
Average copper 
grade 

0.349 % Cu 

Average gold grade 0.266 g/t Au 
Stripping ratio 1.1:1 after reprocessing stockpiled material after year 

17 
 
These reserves will be processed at a rate of 30,000 tonnes/day over a planned mine life of 
approximately 17 years.  Stock-piled material would be processed in years 18 to 25.

19.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA & INFORMATION 
 
19.1 Classification 
 
19.1.1  Introduction 
 
Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralization of the Red Chris Project is 
classified as a resource according to the following definition from National Instrument 43-101: 
 
 "In this Instrument, the terms "mineral resource", "inferred mineral resource", 

"indicated mineral resource" and "measured mineral resource" have the 
meanings ascribed to those terms by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 
and Petroleum, as the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves 
Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council on August 20, 2000, as those 
definitions may be amended from time to time by the Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum." 

 
"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, 
inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form 
and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for 



 

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 195 
December 16, 2004 

economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 
specific geological evidence and knowledge." 

 
 
The terms Measured, Indicated and Inferred are defined in 43-101 as follows: 
 
 "A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 

quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough 
to confirm both geological and grade continuity." 

 
"An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings 
and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity 
to be reasonably assumed." 

 
"An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological 
evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and 
sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes." 

 
19.1.2 Results 
 
Each block at Red-Chris was classified as measured, indicated, or inferred based on geologic 
continuity and the proximity of drill data. The procedure for classification was as follows. For 
each block estimated by kriging, an estimation error was calculated for both copper and gold. 
These estimation errors are based on the nugget effect, sill value, number of composites used in 
the estimate, and where the composites are located relative to any anisotropy present. A paper by 
Garston Blackwell, (Blackwell, 1999) discusses the merits for such a classification method. A 
relative estimation error ('RKSD') was calculated for each block as follows: 
 
 RKSD Cu =  (Kr. Est. Error Cu / Kr. Cu grade)  
 RKSD Au =  (Kr. Est. Error Au / Kr. Au grade)  



 

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 196 
December 16, 2004 

 
Determining the limits of relative standard errors from which to assign the various classification 
categories is somewhat subjective. Blackwell suggests the arbitrary limits of 0.3 and 0.5 for 
porphyry copper and epithermal gold deposits. For the two mineralized zones at Red Chris 
various level were tried and the blocks were classed as follows:  
 
 Main Zone  
 
 Measured - blocks with copper or gold relative estimation errors < 0.30 
 Indicated - blocks with copper or gold relative estimation errors less than 0.60 and  
   not classified as measured 
 Inferred - all other blocks estimated 
 
 East Zone 
 
 Measured - blocks with copper or gold relative estimation errors < 0.35 
 Indicated - blocks with copper or gold relative estimation errors less than 0.70 and  
   not classified as measured 
 Inferred - all other blocks estimated 
 
Within the Far West and Gully zone there is insufficient geological control at this time to 
establish geologic continuity. As a result all blocks were classed as inferred.  Results are 
presented in grade-tonnage tables for the entire deposit sorted by classification in Tables 48 and 
49. The inferred resource calculated for the Far West and Gully Zone are shown in Tables 50 and 
51 respectively.

Results are presented in grade-tonnage tables for the Main Zone, west of 50,650 E, sorted by 
classification in Tables 52 and 53. Examples of how the classified blocks relate to existing drill 
holes are shown as Figures 54 and 55 for the Main Zone Section 50,010 E and 50,050 E 
respectively. Blocks are colour coded by classification type and drill holes ± 25 m on either side 
of the section are shown as solid lines.

Results are presented in grade-tonnage tables for the East zone, east of 50,650 E, sorted by 
classification in Tables 54 and 55. Examples of how the classified blocks relate to existing drill 
holes are shown as Figures 56 and 57 for the East zone Section 50,750 E and 50,810 E. Blocks 
are colour coded by classification type and drill holes with ± 25 m on either side of the section 
are shown as solid lines.

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 207 
December 16, 2004 

 
20.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 2004 infill drill program was successful in increasing both the confidence and total tonnage 
for the Red Chris Deposit. A total of 25 diamond drill holes were completed on the Main and 
East zones during the summer of 2004 (holes numbered 04-296 to 04-320).  Of these holes 10 
targeted the Main zone, 4 targeted the saddle zone between the Main and East zones, 6 tested the 
East zone and 5 condemnation holes were drilled to the north east of the East zone.  The results 
for the 2004 Resource are compared below in a series of Tables to the Resource reported within 
the February 16, 2004 Resource Report (Giroux, et al., 2004). 
 
The main differences between the two studies resulted from the increased information with the 
addition of holes drilled in the Main Zone, in the East Zone and in the saddle zone between. As a 
result of the increase in information, both geological and assay, the differences are as follows: 

 
- within the East zone, the outer shell and Main Phase were combined and joined 

with the Main zone for estimation purposes 
- the East zone Main Phase was modeled with semivariograms separate from the 

Main zone 
- the former Satellite zone was extended and renamed East zone Extension 

 
The changes within the data base and within the modeling parameters resulted in the following 
changes in the Resource. 
 

- Additional drill holes placed between existing drill fences increased the Measured 
Resource tonnage in all Cu cutoff ranges at reasonably similar grades. 

- Decreases in some Indicated cutoff classes can be explained by material moving 
from the indicated to the measured category. 

- The combined measured plus indicated table shows increases in tonnage at all 
cutoff  ranges at virtually identical grades.  

- Within the Inferred Category tonnes are decreased in all cutoff ranges due to the 
additional drilling and moving material into the higher categories.

Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project 209 
December 16, 2004 

 
 
21.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The Red Chris is a well developed project with an established resource that presents an excellent 
opportunity for exploitation. Over the past decade a tremendous amount of high quality work has 
been completed including geologic mapping and sampling, geophysics, trenching, diamond 
drilling, modelling, preliminary mine planning, metallurgical studies, environmental base lines 
studies, and ABA testing. To date, one scoping study (Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd., 1995) and two 
pre-feasibility studies and have been completed by American Bullion. The first feasibility study 
(Fluor Daniel Wright Ltd, 1996) evaluating the feasibility of a large open pit operation while the 
second (American Bullion Minerals Ltd., 1998) investigated possible smaller open pits using a 
system of ore passes and underground conveyors to move material. 
 
Based on the results for the 2004 infill drill program completed at Red Chris and the 
corresponding increased confidence in the estimated resource, a full feasibility study is both 
warranted and recommended.

Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 3 
December 16, 2004 

SUMMARY 
 
1. The 1994 and 1995 American Bullion assay data for Au and Cu by Min-En lab are of an 

acceptable and consistent quality, based on a re-evaluation of quality control information 
summarized by Smee (1995, 1996) and including (1) replicate analyses of three standards 
and (2) duplicate analyses of many pulps by an independent lab (Chemex). 

 
2.  Three in-house standards prepared for bcMetals Corp. by CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. 

in 2003, have well-established mean values for Cu and Au that make the standards useful 
reference materials for quality control of sampling and assaying related to the 2003 drilling 
program. These standards were inserted routinely with analytical batches to obtain the 2003 
analytical data. 

 
3. The principal lab for assaying samples from the 2003 and 2004 drilling programs is IPL Ltd. 

Repeat analyses of standards indicate that IPL 2003 Cu and Au analyses are of acceptable 
accuracy. 

 
4. Every 20th IPL pulp in 2003 was submitted to an independent lab (Chemex) in order to 

monitor for bias. Results indicate that for both Cu and Au the two labs agree satisfactorily. 
Where bias is noted, it is either negligible in magnitude or affects so few samples near the 
cutoff grade that the bias will have negligible impact on resouce\reserve estimates. 

 
5. 2003 Precision of IPL data is adequate, as demonstrated by independent data sets including 

(1) repeat analyses of standards, and (2) repeat analyses of pulps checked by Chemex. 
 
6. Quality control data for the 2004 drilling/sampling/assaying were obtained in comparable 

manner to the 2003 data. The principal lab, IPL, produced acceptable quality data for both Cu 
and Au. Blanks and standards were analyzed with excellent reproducibility; internal precision 
by IPL is acceptable; comparisons of IPL with Chemex for both Au and Cu are acceptable; 
and blind duplicate analyses by IPL are of acceptable quality. 

 
7. Inherent geological (sampling) variability is the principal contributor to total variability 

within the data. For Cu the sampling variability is about 5 times the combined subsampling 
plus analytical variability; for Au the sampling variability is about 2.5 times the combined 
subsampling plus analytical variability. All these sources of error are random and will be 
minimized during resource/reserve estimation because many data will be used for the 
estimation of each block and the errors are compensating. 

 
8. The Au/Cu ratio for various data sets is consistent, ranging from about 0.8 to 1.0.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This report, prepared at the request of Mr. Ian Smith, has the general aim of reporting on the 
quality and suitability of data to be used as the basis of a resource estimate of the Red Chris 
deposit. The available data includes half-core samples obtained by American Bullion during the 
summers of 1994 and 1995 and half-core samples from fill-in drilling by BCMetals during the 
late summer of 2003 and the summer of 2004. The American Bullion pulps and rejects were not 
available. Hence, quality of data was assessed by a re-evaluation of information in two reports on 
quality control by B. Smee (1995, 1996). For the 2003 drill data, a rigorous quality control 
program was instituted that incorporated  
 

(1)  preparation of 3 in-house standards (low, medium and high grades) and their 
integration into analyses throughout the program,  

 
(2)  duplicate analyses of every 20th pulp by a second lab (Chemex) as a monitor 

for bias, 
  
(3)  duplicate analyses of selected pulps by the principal lab (IPL) as a check on 

analytical precision of the principal lab, and  
 
(4)  an independent sampling of half-cores for analysis by IPL to provide an 

indication of inherent geological (short range sampling) variability. 
 

 
EVALUATE AMERICAN BULLION QC DATA (Smee Reports 1995 and 1996) 
 
1994 QC Data (Smee, 1995)—data file: 94assayd.eas 
 
Min-En was the principal lab for the 1994 assay data. A selection of 248 duplicate pulps were 
analyzed by Chemex as a check on Min-En results. Note that such duplicates do not provide a 
quantitative estimate of the precision of either of the labs in question, rather, they produce an 
average precision of the two labs with no indication as to which, if either, is the better quality 
lab. These paired data for Cu are shown in Figure 1--the two labs compare favourably for values 
below 0.67% Cu—bias is not evident and the scatter about the y = x line is acceptable. If 3 
outliers are omitted the average precision of the labs is 10.4% for low Cu values (Figure 2) with 
an average absolute difference of 0.01% Cu for data averaging 0.209% Cu. For values >0.67% 
Cu (Figure 3) there is no evidence of bias; the average absolute difference is 0.031% Cu and the 
average precision of the two labs is about 7.3%.  
 
The Au/Cu ratio for these data is variable but averages about 0.82; there is a relatively strong 
correlation between Au and Cu values. 
 
The duplicate gold data, shown on Figure 4, are divided into two groups based on density of 
values. A low group (less than 0.48gpt Au) shows no evidence of bias (Figure 5). The random 
error is large with an average 2-lab precision of 61%. The 26 high Au values have an average 2-



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 5 
December 16, 2004 

lab precision of 24.4% (Figure 6) for data averaging about 0.9 gpt Au, and show a small fixed 
bias (demonstrable by a paired t-test) of about (0.938 – 0.863) = 0.075 gpt with Chemex high 
relative to Min-En.  
 
All precisions quoted previously in this section are average precisions for Min-En and Chemex 
data. There is nothing in Smee's 1995 report that allows the quantitative determination of 
precision of the Min-En data. The ability of Min-En to reproduce three standards (average Cu 
values of 0.474%, 1.306% and 0.511%; average corresponding gold grades of 0.137gpt, 0.949gpt 
and 0.260gpt) within narrow limits over a period of approximately 5 months, as shown 
graphically in Smee's report, is a good indication of an acceptable level of random error (i.e., 
acceptable precision).  
 
Overall, the 1994 American Bullion data by Min-En agree adequately with checks by Chemex. 
Where bias occurs it is small and Chemex is high relative to Min-En. Hence, accepting Min-En 
data might involve a small element of conservatism. I agree with Smee's conclusion that Min-En 
replicate analyses of standards represent a reasonable indication that Min-En results are accurate 
relative to those standards. 
 
1995 QC Data (Smee, 1996)—data file: 95assayd.eas 
 
The 1995 quality control program was more extensive than that of 1994 and is described in more 
detail by Smee than his account of the 1994 data. Data reproduced by Smee are re-evaluated in 
the following subsections. 
 

Standards 
 
Three standards, RC-A, RC-B and Min-En were analyzed in replicate by Min-En on an 
ongoing basis during the sampling/analytical program for 1995. Time plots of these 
analyses, in Smee (1996), show a remarkably narrow range of reproducibility in all cases. 
A summary of available statistics is given in Table 1. 
 
TABLE 1: STATISTICAL PARAMETERS* FOR THREE STANDARDS FOR 1994 
AND 1995 ANALYTICAL DATA.

*m = mean value, s = standard deviation; Cu in %; Au in gpt 
Overall precisions can be determined for the 1995 data because standard deviations of the 
replicate analyses are available. These precisions are summarized in Table 2 and indicate 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 6 
December 16, 2004 

remarkably good reproducibility of standard values. In all cases, precisions for Cu are very 
much better than for Au. These levels of precision are optimistic relative to what would be 
expected from routine data because standards are extremely well homogenized materials 
and generally become known to the lab operators (of course the Min-En standard was an 
internal lab standard rather than a client-inserted standard).

Min-En  0.259  6.9%  0.519  3.1% 
m = average, Precision = Pr = 200s/m 
 
There is no way of checking for accuracy quantitatively from the data available in Smee's 
reports because no accepted values for the standards are given.  
 
The data of Table 1 are useful in comparing analytical results for standards in 1995 with 
results for the previous year. The copper data for the two years are consistent for all 
standards. This implies that all the copper data for 1994 and 1995 are of consistent 
accuracy. The gold data, however, present a minor problem as follows: the average gold 
values reported for RC-A and RC-B for 1995 are significantly lower than are the average 
values of 1994. Conversely, the gold average for the Min-En standard for 1995 is slightly 
higher than the corresponding average for 1994 data. The bias in the RC standards can be 
demonstrated by conducting a test to determine if the 1994 values are within the 95% 
confidence limits of the 1995 data. For both standards the 1994 data are outside the 
confidence limits of the 1995 values for Au in the two standards and we conclude that 
there is a small but significant bias between the gold values reported for 1994 and 1995. 
For both RC standards, the 1994 data are high relative to the 1995 values—for RC-A by 
100(.012)/.125 = 9.6% and for RC-B by 100(.03)/.919 = 3.3%. There are no recent, 
independent checks of accuracy of these data. From a practical point of view the great 
majority of very low gold values circa 0.125 gpt (mean value of RC-A) will have only a 
minor impact on resource/reserve estimation—consequently, any potential negative 
impact of these biases will be minor. The bias noted for standard RC-B is within the range 
commonly encountered for data sets of this type. 
 
Duplicate Data 
 
The 1995 duplicate Au data are shown in Figure 7. Although a linear model almost 
superimposes on the y = x line for the total data, complexity is indicated by the 
combination of a positive y-intercept and a slope less than 1.0. Two subgroups are defined 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 7

by a gap in the data. A group of low Au values (<0.4 gpt) are seen to be biased (Figure 8) 
with Min-En high relative to Chemex—the average difference (based on a linear model) is 
shown for a few pertinent values below: 
 
 Chemex value (gpt) 0.1  0.2  0.3  0.35 
 Calc'd Min-En value 0.134  0.240  0.347  0.400 
 Diff as % of Min-En 25.4%  16.7%  13.5%  12.5% 
 
The duplicate, high-Au data, shown on Figure 9, are well-reproduced by Min-En and 
Chemex; the linear model is almost superimposed on the y =x line. The average precision 
of the two labs is 19% for an average Au grade of 0.688 gpt. 
 
The average Au/Cu ratio for these 496 samples is 1.05 + 0.06 (average with 95% 
confidence limits). The relatively strong correlation of Au and Cu is evident in the linear 
trend of Figure 10. 
 
Duplicate Cu data, ranging up to 1.57% Cu, are very well duplicated by Min-En and 
Chemex (Figure 11). Two subgroups are based on density of data; Culo is <0.68% Cu; 
Cuhi is .>0.76%Cu. The low values (averaging about 0.158%Cu) have an average 
precision for the two labs of 11.9% and a mean absolute difference of 0.008%; the upper 
group (averaging about 0.98%Cu) has an average precision for the two labs of 5.9% and a 
mean absolute difference of 0.023%Cu.  
 
In summary: the reproducibility of Cu by the two labs in 1995 is exceptionally good. Au 
values above 0.4 gpt are well reproduced by both labs; for values <0.4 gpt Min-En is 
significantly higher than Chemex on average, but this will have little overall impact on 
resource/reserve estimation because many of the low values will not be important in 
defining reserves. 

 
 
2003 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 
Introduction 
 
A program of infill drilling and sampling was undertaken in August 2003 with quality control 
sampling integrated into the general program. Evaluation of several labs (Assayers, Chemex, 
Acme, IPL) led to IPL being selected as the principal lab for analyses, with Chemex as the check 
lab. The overall QC program involved establishing standards, monitoring of IPL results by 
Chemex and duplicate sampling and analyses, as discussed below. 
 
In-House Standards—data files: umpireL.eas, umpireM.eas, umpireH.eas  
 

Round Robin Analyses 
 
Three in-house standards (high, medium and low grades) were prepared by CDN Resource 
Laboratories Ltd. (CDN) for RCDC. Following the physical preparation, 20 subsamples of 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 8 
December 16, 2004 

each pulped standard were sent to Assayers Ltd to test for homogeneity. The test results 
were deemed satisfactory by CDN and twenty samples of each were then sent to each of 
IPL, Chemex and Acme. Summary statistics for results by Assayers Ltd. and the 3 
additional labs are given in Table 3. Examination of these results indicates that IPL is low 
for Au in two standards, relative to the other three labs and IPL is low for Cu in all 
standards relative to the other three labs. This suggests a problem with IPL analyses (i.e., a 
possible low bias for both Cu and Au) as emphasized in Table 4 where IPL data are 
compared with the 4-lab and 3-lab averages.

To check these contrasting results summarized in Table 4, three tests were undertaken: 
 
1. IPL was presented with the problem and asked to reanalyze all the pulps (i.e., 3 x 20 = 

60 pulps to be reanalyzed). 
2. Drill hole 248 was the first hole to be sampled and assayed after round robin analyses 

of the in-house standards. For Hole 248 all samples above 0.3 % Cu were reanalyzed 
by a lab other than IPL or Chemex (Acme was selected arbitrarily).

December 16, 2004 

3. The first batch of monitor assays by Chemex (which included samples taken shortly 
after the umpire samples were first analyzed) was compared with IPL results. 

 
Reanalyses of Standards by IPL—data file: 

 
The original and check analyses of standards by IPL are summarized in Table 5. The 
check analyses by IPL are much more in line with results from the other three labs than 
are the original data. I conclude, the original IPL data were in error 
 
New, accepted mean values for the 3 standards, calculated as a weighted average of the 3-
lab average and the new IPL results, are listed in Table 5.

Hole 248 Repeat Analyses by Acme—data file: 03-248.eas 
 
Eighty-three sample pulps from ddh 248, with reported Au grades in excess of 0.3gpt, 
were submitted to Acme Lab as an independent check on initial results by IPL. Acme and 
IPL gold values for ddh 248 pulps show no evidence of bias (Figure 12). Scatter about the 
best fit line is less for data pairs averaging less than 1.1 gpt compared with higher values. 
For the lower values the mean absolute difference is 0.048gpt, the relative error is 0.102 
for grades averaging 0.591gpt and the average interlab precision is 20.4%. For values 
higher than 1.1gpt the mean absolute difference is 0.237gpt, the relative error is 0.145 for 
data averaging 2.04gpt and the average interlab precision is 29.1%. 
 
The copper data less than approximately 0.85% Cu are reproduced well by the two labs 
(Figure 13)—the average precision for the two labs for these assays averaging 0.615% Cu 
is 12.1%. The mean absolute difference by the two labs is 0.030% Cu. 
 
 
Paired data above approximately 0.85% Cu are biased (Figure 14a). A linear model fitted

to the data has the equation 
 
   AcmeCu = 0.837IPLCu + 0.104 
 
Applying this equation to a range of IPL values gives the average biases listed in Table 6.  
The Acme-IPL bias in high copper values may relate to the fact that Acme used an ICP 
finishing procedure for the assays they reported.

  *Differences are biases relative to IPL 
 
The disparity between Acme and IPL Cu results for hole 03-248 was investigated by 
submission of the same pulps to Chemex for assay. Chemex results are compared with IPL 
in Figure14b where a bias is evident, albeit a lesser bias than demonstrated in Figure 14a 
and Table 6. For example, for IPL values of 1.0 and 1.4% Cu the Chemex biases are –
5.9% and –8.9% respectively. A disparity of about 5% is widely accepted in the mining 
industry so IPL values above 1.0% Cu must be considered—this bias in high Cu values is 
not consistent with independent checks on Cu values by Chemex as part of the general 
monitoring program (see next section) for which Chemex and IPL Cu values are in 
excellent agreement. Furthermore, the disparity between Acme and IPL Cu values (IPL is 
high, on average) is in contrast to an earlier concern that IPL round robin Cu values were 
low relative to analyses by three other labs that included Acme (Assayers, Chemex and 
Acme). I conclude that the bias of high IPL Cu analyses (>1.0% Cu) for hole 03-248 data 
is a local random aberration that is not evident in the more extensive data base. 
 
Chemex Monitor Analyses—data file check3.eas 
 
Check analyses of pulps received from Chemex are compared with corresponding original 
analyses by IPL. A plot for Au data (AA finish) is shown in Figure 15. In general, the 
comparison is acceptable. With one outlier removed there is no evidence of bias and the 
scatter of paired data about the y = x line is reasonable—the average interlab analytical 
error is sa = 0.0749 giving a mean absolute difference of 0.06 gpt and an average interlab 
precision of 33.6%. Samples >1gpt were also analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric 
finish—for the 11 samples involved, the two labs compare favourably as shown in Figure 
16a. Similarly, the IPL gravimetric analyses compare favourably with the IPL AA-finish 
analyses as illustrated in Figure 16b.

 For Cu duplicates (Figure 17) the two labs (IPL and Chemex) are in even better 
agreement than for gold. The average 2-lab error (standard deviation) is sa = 0.047%, to 
give a mean absolute difference of 0.038%, an average relative error of 0.090 and an 
average 2-lab precision of 17.9%. These data are discussed in greater detail below in a 
section entitled "Regular Chemex Checks of IPL Pulp Analyses". 
 
Conclusion 
 
These tests indicated that the original, poor results by IPL on the RCDC' in-house 
standards are limited to the original round robin analyses of the in-house standards and are 
not representative of the subsequent (2003) assay data. A second set of analyses by IPL 
are consistent with those of the 3 other round robin labs; monitoring data shows IPL to be 
consistent, on average, with Chemex check results. 

 
 
Precision of IPL Data 
 
Two independent sets of data allow quantification of the precision of IPL analyses—(1) pulps 
first analyzed by IPL, checked by Chemex and returned to IPL as renumbered pulps, and (2) 
duplicate analyses of in-house standards.  
 

IPL Rechecks of Chemex Checks on IPL Pulps—data file: checks3.eas 
 
A total of 250 pulps analyzed by IPL (approx. one in every 20 samples) were sent to 
Chemex for check analyses during the 2003 drill program. The pulps were renumbered 
and returned to IPL to be rechecked as 'blind' pulps thus providing a sound basis with 
which to estimate average, IPL analytical precision throughout the analytical program of 
October and November 2003. The paired, non-zero IPL Au analyses are shown on Figure 
18a. Data were divided into two subgroups—low values have a relatively tight scatter 
about y = x; high values have a relatively wide scatter about y = x. For the low-grade 
group (Figure 18b) no bias is evident—the y = x line and the RMA line are superimposed. 
Omitting one outlier, the mean absolute difference is 0.03gpt, the average relative error is 
0.183gpt and the average 2-lab precision is 36%. The high values (Figure 18c) have a 
mean absolute difference of 0.214gpt, a relative error of 0.190 and an average precision of 
38% These results, in general, indicate that IPL Au data are unbiased and have a moderate 
level of random analytical error 
 
IPL duplicate Cu analyses for 240 pulps (non-zero) are shown in Figure 19a. The low 
values (<0.6%Cu), plotted on Figure 19b, are in good agreement. Values below 0.6% Cu 
have a mean absolute difference of 0.02%, an average relative error of 0.096 and an 
average precision of 19%. The high Cu values, shown on Figure 19c, are also in good 
agreement with a mean absolute difference of 0.066% Cu, an average relative error of 
0.062 and an average precision of 12.5%. 
 
The great majority of Au analyses by IPL and Chemex are fire assays with an atomic 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 12 
December 16, 2004 

absorption finish. The relatively small number of monitoring samples that assayed above 
1.0gpt was rerun as fire assays with a gravimetric finish by both IPL (twice—each time 
they analyzed the same pulp) and Chemex. For Chemex (Figure 20a) and the original IPL 
(Figure 20b) gravimetric assays there is remarkably close agreement with corresponding 
AA finish results. For the second set of IPL results (Figure 20c) there is a slight 
underestimation of IPL gravimetric finish relative to AA finish—on average the 
underestimation is 0.225 gpt for values averaging 2.28gpt. Because results by gravimetric 
finish are accepted as the final value in the data base used for resource estimation the use 
of gravimetric-finish values is seen as a conservative decision. 
 
Blanks analyzed routinely by IPL with all analytical batches reported low values at or near 
the detection limit, indicating an absence of contamination of material during analysis. 
The maximum gold value in a blank is 0.03 gpt with an average value of 0.013 gpt. The 
maximum copper value in a blank is 0.02% with an average value of 0.013%. 

 
Replicate Analyses of In-House Standards. 
 
IPL analyzed the in-house standards in replicate on two separate occasions because the 
first set of analyses indicated that a bias existed relative to three other labs involved in the 
round robin analyses of the standards. Precisions, estimated from both sets of replicate 
analyses, are summarized in Table 5. In brief, the results indicate that precision for Au in 
standards is circa 10% whereas precision for Cu is circa 3%. These results are 
significantly better precision estimates than are those based on blind duplicates, as 
discussed in the previous section.

Monitoring IPL Analyses 
 
Two sets of analytical data serve as a monitor of IPL analytical data by independent labs, (1) 
regular monitoring of IPL pulp analyses by Chemex, and (2) selected reanalyses (ddh 248) of 
IPL pulps by Acme.

Regular Chemex Checks of IPL Pulp Analyses—datafile: checks3.eas 
 
IPL pulps checked by Chemex, were returned as renumbered pulps to IPL who produced a 
second analysis. Each of these two analyses by IPL can be compared with the Chemex 
check results. A comparison of original IPL Au analyses with Chemex values has been 
discussed briefly above. The recheck Au data versus Chemex are considered best in two 
subgroups, low and high values, separated at approximately 0.54gpt (Figure 21). Low 
values by the two labs are in exceptionally good agreement with a mean absolute 
difference of 0.020gpt, a relative error of 0.099 and average precision of 20%. The linear 
model for the higher data shows an average bias of approximately 10% (for grades 
averaging about 1.55gpt Au) with IPL analyzing high relative to Chemex. The high values 
have a relative error of 0.074 and an average precision of 15%. Figure 22 shows the 
second IPL AU analyses versus the Chemex monitor values. 
 
Recheck Cu analyses by IPL are shown versus check analyses by Chemex on Figure 23. 
The recheck analyses have a remarkably good comparison with Chemex data, indicating 
no measurable bias and having a high level of reproducibility (i.e., an average precision 
for the two labs of 8% for an average grade of 0.52%Cu). The original IPL data versus 
Chemex, similarly shows no evidence of bias but the average precision of the two labs is 
higher at 17.7%. 
 
It is of interest to note that for both Cu and Au, the routine analyses by IPL show 
substantially more random scatter than do the recheck (nonroutine/special study) analyses. 
This indicates that routine analyses are less precise than are non-routine analyses 
involving analyses of groups of pulps submitted or resubmitted for special studies. Note 
that the original comparison of Chemex Au vs. IPL Au indicated no bias whereas the 
comparison of Chemex Au vs. the second IPL analysis indicated IPL to be about 10 
percent higher for values greater than about 0.7gpt. Considering these results in the light 
of round robin analyses of standards and other check analyses by Acme, it seems that IPL 
has a moderate random variability for Au from batch to batch. 
 
Special Acme Checks of IPL Pulp Analyses for ddh 248—datafile: 03-248.eas 
 
Repeat analyses of pulps for ddh 248 with reported grades greater than 0.3gpt Au or 0.3% 
Cu were sent to another independent lab (Acme) as a check on IPL. These data are 
discussed in detail in an earlier section. In general, they show that the two labs agree 
acceptable for gold analyses and for Cu analyses less than 0.85% Cu. However, for higher 
Cu grades Acme measures low relative to IPL. The pulps were sent to Chemex as an 
independent check and Chemex results for high Cu values, shown plotted in Figure 14b, 
are discussed in an earlier section. In brief, the Chemex-IPL comparison is better than the 
Acme-IPL comparison but there remains about a 10 percent bias in Cu data above 1.5% 
Cu, with IPL high relative to Chemex. The regular monitoring information (see Figure 23) 
indicates that this bias is not present throughout the 2003 data.

Duplicate Half Cores—data file: half-core_rej.eas 
 
Total sampling variability can be quantified by comparing analyses for duplicate samples, in this 
case, duplicate half cores. A plot of 60 such data for Cu, taken as part of the 2003 quality control 
program, is given in Figure 24. These data show extremely good agreement on average, with a 
total average error of st = 0.1187 (giving a precision of 28.2%). The mean absolute difference of 
0.095%Cu means that, on average, any two duplicate core values will differ, on average, by 
about 0.1%Cu. Average relative error is 0.141 for an average grade of 0.843% Cu to give an 
average half-core to half-core precision of 22.5%. 
 
A plot of the second half-core Cu value against a second coarse reject sample grade from the 
same half core is shown in Figure 25. These results are somewhat surprising because they show 
less variability than analytical error alone, a situation that can arise because the analytical error 
was determined for a different data set i.e., the data are not consistent. The subsampling plus 
analytical error based on Figure 25 is sss+a = 0.028. Consequently, the sampling error is estimated 
to be 
 
 ss = (st2- sss+a 2)½ = (0.11872 -  0.0282)1/2 =   0.12%Cu 
 
which is nearly 5 times the combined sampling plus analytical error.                
 
Half-core, paired values that are lower than about 0.38%Cu have much less dispersion than do 
higher values. The lower group of 10 values has an average precision of about 18.2% whereas, 
the higher group of 50 values has an average precision of about 27.1%. 
 
Duplicate half-core data for Au are plotted in Figure 26. The RMA linear model is almost 
coincident with the y = x line indicating no evidence of bias. The data have a relatively wide 
dispersion about the y = x line: the total error is st = 0.245gpt giving a mean absolute difference 
of 0.2gpt, a relative error of 0.345 and a precision of about 69%. A comparable plot for duplicate 
rejects is shown in 'Figure 27 where the combined subsampling plus analytical error is 
0.092%Cu to give a mean absolute difference of 0.073gpt, a relative error of 0.136 and a 
precision of 27.2%. In this case the sampling error for Au is 
 
 ss = (st2- sss+a 2)½ = (0.2452 -  0.0922)1/2 =  0.227 
 
which is approximately two and one-half times the subsampling plus analytical error. 
 
This independent sampling of the 2003 core indicates that the 2003 analytical data are unbiased. 
Moreover, by far the largest source of variability in the analytical data arises because of inherent 
geological variability over short distances i.e., the half-core sampling error is very much larger 
than the combined subsampling plus analytical error—about 5 times larger in the case of copper 
and about two and one-half times larger in the case of gold. All of these sources of variability are 
random in nature and their impact will be compensatory during resource/reserve estimation 
because many samples will be used in the estimation of each block considered.

2004 DRILLING PROGRAM 

 
Introduction 
 
The 2004 quality control program for Red Chris sampling and assaying followed a similar 
pattern to that of 2003. Approximately every 20th sample was selected as a duplicate pulp which 
was first analyzed by IPL, then was sent as a blind pulp to Chemex for a check analysis after 
which the Chemex pulp returned to IPL as a blind pulp. This procedure ensures a reasonable 
control on possible bias and provides a fair check of IPL internal precision. Company standards 
and blanks were inserted with each analytical batch by IPL. 
 
Standards and Blanks (data file: RC04_QAQC_xlsv5.xls) 
 
A total of 25 blank samples were inserted in the stream for quality control assaying of samples 
from the 2004 drilling program. Of these, Cu reported as 0.00% in one sample, 0.01% in 20 
samples and 0.02 % in 4 samples. In the case of gold, all 25 samples reported equal to or less 
than 0.01 g/t. These are very acceptable values and indicate that contamination of samples, in 
general,  is not a problem during analyses of 2004 samples. 
 
Three standards prepared for the 2003 assaying program were also used for the 2004 quality 
control work. The accepted values of these 'high', 'medium' and 'low' grade standards are listed 
in Table 5 and are based on round robin analyses conducted prior to the 2003 sampling/analytical 
program. Table 8 compares the statistics of the 2004 results for these standards with the accepted 
values.

INTERNAL STANDARDS WITH ACCEPTED VALUES

  Cu 0.353% 25 0.347% 0.0131 
 
The data of Table 8 indicate that the averages obtained by IPL for both metals in all three 
standards is acceptable close to the accepted value. In all cases, the accepted value is within the 
95% range of values reported by IPL. Moreover, the standard deviations in all cases are very 
small indicated a high degree of analytical reproducibility of the standards by IPL.

Precision of IPL Data (data file: RC04_QAQC.txt) 
 
IPL ran duplicate Au and Cu analyses of 105 pulps as part of their 2004 internal quality control 
program.  
 
 Copper 
 
The Cu data have been divided into 2 subgroups arbitrarily (at about 0.2% Cu) based on two 
characteristic spreads about the y = x line on an x vs y plot. Results are illustrated in Figures 29 
and 30. The lower grade subgroup plots very close to the y = x line (i.e., no bias) and indicates an 
average analytical error of sa = 0.0058 for data averaging 0.0935% Cu. This translates to an 
average precision of about 12%. 
 
The higher grade Cu duplicates similarly show no indication of bias. The average analytical error 
is sa = 0.0121 for data averaging 0.5389% Cu which gives an average precision of about 4.5%. 
Both the high and low grade duplicate copper analyses show that bias is not present and that 
reproducibility is acceptable. 
 
 Gold 
 
The 105 pulps analyzed in duplicate for Au can be divided into two subgroups (at approx. 0.25 
g/t) based on scatter about the y = x line. These two subgroups are illustrated in Figures 31 and 
32. The lower grade data center closely about the y = x line and thus indicate no bias. The scatter 
about the line gives an average analytical error of sa = 0.01494 for data averaging 0.0767g/t 
which gives an average analytical precision of about 39%. This is equivalent to a precison of 
about 15% at a grade of 0.2g/t. 
 
The high grade subgroup of duplicate Au values plots about the y = x line, indicating no bias. 
The spread of data about the y = x line give an average analytical error of sa = 0.0392 which 
gives an average precision of about 17%. Reproducibility for both the low grade and high grade 
subgroups is acceptable. 
 
 Au/Cu Ratio 
 
The quality control data provide an opportunity to check the character of Au/Cu ratios relative to 
previously obtained data. On an x vs y plot the data have a pronounced linear trend with a slope 
of about 0.8 and substantial scatter. This result is consistent with data from previous drilling 
campaigns. 
 
 
External Lab Check for Bias in IPL Data. data file: RC2004_Rechecks_ALS_IPL.txt 
 
 Introduction:  
 
One hundred and two pulps were analyzed as check analyses by Chemex. These pulps were 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 17 
December 16, 2004 

subsequently returned to IPL as 'blind' pulps for reanalysis by IPL. 
 
 Copper 
 
Duplicate Cu analyses by IPL (initial analyses) and Chemex are illustrated in Figure 33. The data 
group closely about the y = x line with very little scatter indicating that no bias exists between 
the two labs. The very slight scatter of data about the y = x line suggests that both labs have a 
acceptable quality precision. An acceptable comparison also exists between IPL (second Cu 
analyses) and Chemex check analyses. 
 

Gold 
 
 In the case of Au, a single high grade sample produces values of 1.23 and 1.15g/t, relatively 
good agreement for such a high value. With this influential value removed, the duplicate Au 
analyses by IPL (initial analysis) and Chemex scatter about the y = x line acceptably indicating 
no bias between the two labs as shown on Figure 34. Two samples are somewhat removed from 
the y = x line relative to the bulk of the plotted points; in both cases IPL measured high relative 
to Chemex. In contrast, the high grade value omitted on the diagram was analyzed high by 
Chemex relative to IPL. The second set of IPL Au analyses show a slight bias of about 5% or 
less relative to Chemex check analyses, with Chemex values being slightly higher on average. 
This level of difference is common between laboratories and is considered acceptable; in any 
case,  IPL values are conservative relative to Chemex values. In general, the dispersion of data 
indicates acceptable quality of check analyses. 
 
 
IPL Blind Precision Test. data file: RC2004_Rechecks_ALS_IPL.txt 
 

Introduction 
 
The 102 samples analyzed by Chemex were returned to IPL as 'blind' pulps for Au and Cu 
analyses. These second sets of analyses are compared with the original IPL analyses to establish 
the true lab analytical precision for the 2004 data. 
 
 Copper 
 
Blind duplicate Cu analyses of pulps by IPL are plotted on Figure 35 and show a small but real 
bias of about 4.5% between the two sets of data.. A bias of this magnitude in duplicate samples, 
analyzed at different times, is expectable for routine analyses in a lab and is generally acceptable. 
The blind precision for copper analyses, taken relative to the mean value of the duplicate pulps 
analyzed, is about 11.5% for data averaging approximately 0.24% Cu. 
 
 Gold 
 
Original IPL Au analyses of pulps are plotted versus blind duplicate analyses by IPL on Figure 
36. This diagram and related statistics indicate no recognizable bias. If the highest (influential) 
value plotted is omitted, the statistics change slightly but, again, no bias can be recognized (see 



Quality Control Assay Data – Red Chris Exploration 1994 – 2004 18 
December 16, 2004 

Table 9). Similarly, if only the data less than 0.4 g/t Au are considered, no bias is recognized.

The precision for blind gold analyses, taken relative to the mean grade of the duplicate pulps 
analyzed (0.187 g/t Au), is about 41%, almost the same as the precision for internal (known) 
duplicates by IPL. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The writer is in agreement with Smee that the accuracy and precision of the 1994 and 1995 Red 
Chris assay data for Cu and Au, obtained for American Bullion Minerals Ltd., meets quality 
levels that are generally acceptable throughout the mining industry. 
 
An exhaustive quality control program incorporated into the 2003 Red Chris drill program by 
bcMetals demonstrates that the Cu and Au assay data obtained in 2003 isare of acceptable 
accuracy and precision. Moreover, the inherent sampling variability for both metals is 
demonstrated to be very much larger than the combined variability arising from both 
subsampling and analytical protocols. These random errors will be minimized during 
resource/reserve estimation because they are compensating in nature in cases such as this where 
many samples are used in the estimation of a block. 
 
A quality control program for assays obtained for the 2004 drilling program duplicates the 
general procedures of the 2003 drilling. Analyses of standards and internal duplicates by IPL 
demonstrates an acceptable quality for internal lab procedures. Check analyses of pulps by 
Chemex indicate that no significant bias is present in the IPL and Chemex data. Blind checks of 
pulps by IPL indicate a very acceptable level of internal precision by IPL for both Cu and Au. 
 
All data sets examined indicate a strong direct relation between gold and copper—Au/Cu ratios 
are commonly in the range 0.8 to 1.0.
