1.0 SUMMARY 
 
The J&L Property represents one of the largest undeveloped polymetallic deposits in British 
Columbia and is located 35 km north of Revelstoke. The property consists of 20 mineral 
tenure claims and 10 crown granted claims for a total of 3,051.73 ha. The J&L Property had 
been owned for many years by the T. Arnold estate and was optioned to Merit Mining Corp. 
(Merit) in 2007. In August, 2010, Merit exercised its option by advancing cash payments and 
share issuances, resulting in a 100% unencumbered interest in the J&L Property. In 
December, 2010, the company changed its name to Huakan International Mining Inc. 
(Huakan). 
 
Micon International Limited (Micon) has been retained by Huakan to prepare a Technical 
Report in accordance with Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101 to support the 
disclosure of the results of the preliminary economic assessment (PEA) on the potential 
production of gold, silver, lead and zinc from the J&L Main Zone deposit.   
 
The PEA is based on the proposed underground mining and carbon-in-leach processing of 
the mineral resources at a rate of 1,500 t/d to produce gold doré and saleable concentrate(s).  
The mineral resource estimate, on which the PEA is based, was previously disclosed in a 
technical report dated June 23, 2011 and filed on SEDAR. 
 
1.1 HISTORY 
 
The J&L area was first explored as early as 1865, when placer miners discovered gold in 
Carnes Creek. By 1896, two prospectors, Jim Kelley and Lee George, staked the first claims 
at the junction of Carnes and McKinnon Creeks, with the earliest work (1896-1900) carried 
out at the Roseberry mineral zone, 5 km northwest of where the J&L zone was later 
discovered. The property has been referred to as the J&L since its discovery by these two 
prospectors. 
 
The Company entered into an option agreement dated April 13, 2007, whereby it may 
acquire a 100% undivided interest in the J&L Property in consideration for share issuances 
and cash payments totalling $10.79 million over a seven year period. In August, 2010, the 
Company exercised the option by advancing the cash and share issuances to acquire a 100% 
undivided interest in the J&L Property. There are no net smelter return (NSR) royalties 
owing to any parties. 
 
1.2 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 
The Property lies within the Selkirk Mountains near the north end of the Kootenay Arc, a 
complex belt of northwest-trending, east-dipping Neoproterozoic to Lower Paleozoic 
metasedimentary and metavolcanic miogeosynclinal rocks (Logan et al., 1997 A & B). The 
belt is characterized by tight to isoclinal folds and generally west-verging thrust faults. 
Greenschist grade regional metamorphism has affected most of the rocks in the area. Recent 
mapping by provincial government geologists has outlined the regional geology of the area.

The J&L Property contains two distinct deposits:  the Main Zone and the Yellowjacket Zone.  
The Main Zone strikes north-west at about 330° and dips at about 50° to the northeast, and 
contains Au, Ag, Pb, and Zn.  The Ag-Pb-Zn-bearing Yellowjacket is considered to be the 
remnant of a much larger, pre-existing, carbonate-hosted deposit which has subsequently 
been modified (remobilized, augmented and replaced) by the Main Zone structure and 
mineralizing system. Only the Main Zone deposit is considered in this PEA. 
 
1.3 EXPLORATION 
 
The J&L Property has been intermittently explored for over 100 years. The initial recorded 
mapping and prospecting was done by Dr. Gunning of the Geological Survey of Canada 
(GSC) in 1928. Other companies that have mapped and prospected the J&L include 
Piedmont Mines Ltd. (1929), Westairs Mines Ltd. (1963 to 1965), BP Selco (1981 to 1985), 
Equinox Resources Ltd. (1989) and Weymin Mining Corporation (1996 to 1997). The results 
of these mapping programs identified the surface trace of the Main Zone and several other 
parallel mineralized structures.  
 
The Company, known as Merit Mining at the time, completed a 1,363-m, nine hole surface 
drill program on the Yellowjacket Zone in November 2007 with the objective of verifying 
historic drilling over a portion of the Yellowjacket deposit. The program successfully 
achieved this objective by intercepting multiple Ag-Pb-Zn zones similar in grade and width 
to previous drilling. The Yellowjacket Zone has no resources reported on in this technical 
report. 
 
In November 2010, Merit/Huakan commenced a Phase I 2,000-m underground drill program 
with the objectives of verifying historic drilling and broadening the known resource in the 
Main Zone. This drilling was intended to provide more data for a mineral resource estimate 
compliant with the reporting requirements of NI 43-101. The program was expanded to 7,897 
m and was completed by early February, 2011 with the completion of 60 BQTW (thin wall) 
core holes.  
 
1.4 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The basis for the PEA is the mineral resource estimate prepared by P&E Engineering Inc. 
(P&E), which was dated June 23, 2011 and filed on SEDAR, as shown in Table 1.1 below.

1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate 

of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

2) Confidence in the estimate of Inferred Mineral Resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of 
technical and economic parameters. There is no guarantee that all or any part of a mineral resource can or will 
be converted into a mineral reserve. 

3) The mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by 
the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council. 

4) The following parameters were used to derive the NSR block model values:  
-April 30/11 two year trailing average. metal prices of Au US$1,183/oz, Ag US$21/oz, Pb US$0.99/lb, 
Zn US$0.95/lb  

-Exchange rate of US$0.95 = $1.00 
-Process recoveries of Au 92%, Ag 88%, Pb 80%, Zn 72%  
-Smelter payables of Au 96%, Ag 91%, Pb 95%, Zn 85%,  
-Refining charges of Au US$15/oz, Ag US$0.50/oz 
-Concentrate freight charges of $65/t and Smelter treatment charge of US185/t 
-Mass pull of 5% and 8% concentrate moisture content. 

5) The NSR cut-off of $110 per tonne was derived from $75/t mining, $25/t processing and $10/t G&A 
6) The effective date of the mineral resource estimate is May 16, 2011. 

 
Fred Brown, CPG, of P&E was the independent Qualified Person (QP) responsible for 
preparing the mineral resource estimate. The mineral resource estimate involved 3D 
modeling methods and parameters, and statistical and grade continuity analyses. Gemcom 
GEMS modeling software was used for the 3D block model and subsequent grade estimates. 
Grade capping was used to restrict the influence of statistical outliers during inverse distance 
squared (ID2) interpolation of block grades. A total of 266 drill holes have been completed on 
the property. The resource estimate utilized a total of 396 bulk density measurements 
determined by on site by the Company, utilizing the wet immersion technique. 
 
1.5 MINING 
 
An underground mine plan developed by Micon comprises 1.09 million tonnes of measured 
resources at an average grade of 6.32 g/t Au, 65.91 g/t Ag, 4.16% Zn, and 2.28% Pb; 1.05 
million tonnes of indicated resources at an average grade of 7.10 g/t Au, 66.08 g/t Ag, 3.94% 
Zn, and 2.04% Pb; and 2.76 million tonnes from inferred mineral resources at an average 



 
 

 4

grade of 6.20 g/t Au, 72.43 g/t Ag, 3.24% Zn, and 2.22% Pb.  The mine plan includes 
provision for mining losses and dilution.  The PEA is based on a 1,500 t/d underground bulk 
mining operation, using ramp access.  The main mining method considered is mechanized, 
longhole stoping with truck haulage and stope backfill using waste rock and process tailings. 
 
1.6 METALLURGICAL TESTWORK AND PROCESSING 
 
1.6.1 Metallurgical Testwork 
 
Huakan has recently initiated metallurgical testing on the samples obtained from the 830 
Drift on the J&L Property.  This testwork includes heavy media separation (HMS), grinding, 
and several stages of flotation and pressure oxidation and bioleaching on a portion of the 
flotation products prior to cyanidation.   
 
The results of Huakan's current testwork program were not available at the time this report 
was prepared.  The PEA relies, therefore, on the results of extensive previous programs.  The 
general thrust of the previous testwork has been to separate the base metals from the ore by 
selective flotation, and then recover the precious metals from the tails by some combination 
of additional flotation and hydrometallurgical processing (such as oxidation and 
cyanidation).   
 
The majority of the testwork to date focused on producing saleable lead and zinc 
concentrates by various flotation separation techniques. In addition, some tests have been 
carried out on the refractory arsenopyrite concentrates.  These have included Cashman 
(chloride leach), Redox (nitrate leach), batch roasting, pressure oxidation and biooxidation, 
followed by cyanidation, to recover the precious metals.  
 
1.6.2 Recovery Methods  
 
Two process flowsheet options were considered for this PEA and each includes an HMS 
circuit ahead of milling to remove 40% of the rock by weight, with estimated metal losses of 
2%.  The main difference between the two proposed options is whether a single lead 
concentrate or two concentrates, lead and zinc are produced for sale.  
 
Each option involves a similar set of processing steps including crushing, HMS, grinding, 
flotation, oxidation, and cyanidation.  The main source of assay data for this report is a study 
dated November 2, 2006, prepared on behalf of BacTech Mining Corporation (BacTech) by 
Process Research Associates Ltd. (PRA).  This study used the closest flowsheet arrangement 
to the recommended program today, and was conducted on samples which had been pre-
concentrated using heavy liquid separation similar to earlier flotation testwork conducted in 
1998. The conceptual plant design for the single saleable concentrate is based on the results 
of testwork carried out by PRA on mineralization making up a composite sample with head 
grades of 8.1g/t Au, 72.4 g/t Ag, 3.2% Pb, and 4.8% Zn.  For this PEA, Micon has estimated 
the life-of-mine (LOM) average feed grades as follows:  6.42 g/t Au, 69.8 g/t Au, 2.2% Pb, 
and 3.6% Zn.

Only a summary of the PRA report was available through Huakan.  Thus, additional process 
parameters (including suitable HMS density, reagent consumption, et cetera) have been 
identified from a report dated October, 1998 report prepared by H.A. Simons (Simons).  The 
Simons report was based on testwork conducted by PRA under the direction of Beattie 
Consulting Ltd.    
 
1.7 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
There is a fully functional 40-man camp as well as a large shop and office facility located at 
the property.  A preliminary review has been carried out of infrastructure required for the 
J&L Main Zone project, and cost allowances have been allocated.  Existing buildings and 
facilities will be upgraded, as well as services, including water supply, electrical power 
supply and main substation upgrades.  A more detailed investigation of the existing 
infrastructure is recommended to be carried out during the next stages of project 
development. 
 
1.8 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
 
Previous operators in the 1980's and early 1990's collected some background environmental 
data including water samples.  Environmental baseline studies were initiated in 2007 by 
Merit/Huakan for the J&L Property, including meteorology, water quality, waste 
characterization, vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries studies. 
 
Previous exploration activities generated PAG waste rock which is currently stored on a lined 
pad near the portal and being managed following provincial requirements. Ongoing costs 
with managing this material have not been included in the financial model. 
 
The proposed project is expected to require a provincial environmental review under the 
British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and a Screening level assessment under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. For economic scheduling purposes, this was 
estimated to take two years.  
 
The J&L project falls within three First Nation territories, the Okanagan, Shuswap and 
Ktunaxa Nations. Huakan has initiated consultation in conjunction with exploration activities 
and it is understood that these activities will continue as the project moves forward. 
 
Micon understands that all exploration permits are in place and maintained in compliance. 
Following good industry practice, it is assumed a social, environmental, health and safety 
management system will be implemented to meet the company's commitments to protect the 
environment and the health and safety of the workers and the surrounding communities. The 
management system and plans will monitor and maintain permit compliance and a social 
licence to operate.

1.11 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
Micon has prepared its assessment of the Project on the basis of a discounted cash flow 
model, from which net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback and other 
measures of project viability can be determined. Assessments of NPV are generally accepted 
within the mining industry as representing the economic value of a project after allowing for 
the cost of capital invested. 
 
The base case evaluates to an IRR of 26% before tax and 21% after tax. At the selected 
discount rate of 8%, the net present value (NPV8) of the cash flow is $344 million before tax 
and $202 million after tax.

Annual cash flows are presented in Figure 1.1. 
 

Figure 1.1  
Life-of-Mine Cash Flows 

 

 
 
1.11.1 Sensitivity Analysis 
 
The sensitivity of the project returns to changes in all revenue factors (including head grades, 
recoveries, prices and exchange rate assumptions), together with capital and operating costs, 
was tested over a range of 25% above and below base case values.  Figure 1.2 shows the 
results of this analysis. 
 
The results show that the project is most sensitive to revenue factors, with an adverse change 
of 25% reducing NPV8 to $41 million.  The project is less sensitive to capital costs, with an 
adverse change of 25% required to reduce NPV8 to $133 million. Operating costs have the 
least impact on returns, with a 25% increase in cost reducing NPV8 to $145 million. 
 
In further analysis, Micon notes that simultaneously applying an increase of more than 40% 
to both capital and operating costs simultaneously will be required in order to reduce NPV8 
to zero.

1.12 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Following the completion of the positive PEA study, it is recommended that Huakan advance 
the development of the J&L Property to the pre-feasibility stage and that baseline data 
collection and community and First Nations consultation continue in order to support 
potential permitting. 
 
Huakan has carried out Phase I of its work on the J&L deposit. It is estimated that to 
complete a pre-feasibility study on the J&L deposit, including drilling, metallurgical testing, 
and engineering design will cost in the range of $24 million, spread over a further two 
phases.  The next phase, Phase II, of the work program is estimated to cost $4.4 million and 
consist of 250 m of drifting, drill bays and 40 drillholes.  Phase III is expected to cost $19.6 
million and consist of 2,180 m of drifting, drill bay development and 47 new drillholes.  
Although no detailed budget has been completed for Phase III, this cost estimate is derived 
from industry experience with similar scale projects.  A budget for Phase II has been 
compiled by Huakan and is shown in Table 1.4.  Micon believes that both estimates are 
reasonable.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The qualified persons have not carried out any independent exploration work, drilled any 
holes, or carried out any sampling and assaying on the J&L Property, other than 
examining/verifying mineralization on drill cores and visually examining the existing 
underground workings. Check-sampling and analysis was carried out by Fred Brown as part 
of his site visit in December, 2010 as described in Section 11.0. While exercising all 
reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, the authors of this report have 
relied upon Huakan's presentation of data for the J&L Property and the findings of its 
consultants in formulating their opinion.  
 
The status of the mining claims under which Huakan holds title to the mineral rights for the 
J&L Property has not been investigated or confirmed by the Micon, and Micon offers no 
legal opinion as to the validity of the mineral titles claimed. The description of the J&L 
Property, and ownership thereof, as set out in this report, is provided for general information 
purposes only.  The existing environmental conditions, liabilities and remediation have been 
described where required by NI 43-101 regulations. These statements also are provided for 
information purposes only and Micon offers no opinion in this regard.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1 ACCESS 
 
Vehicle access to the area is via Provincial Highway 23, 35 km north of the town of 
Revelstoke, where Highway 23 intercepts the Carnes Creek Forest Service Road. The 
Property is then reached by travelling eastward 13 km along the Carnes Creek Forest Service 
Road before reaching the J&L mine camp. Travel time to camp is approximately 45 to 60 
minutes from Revelstoke. The Forest Service Road is radio-controlled, but currently is not 
being used for logging activities. Due to lack of activity by logging companies, road 
maintenance and winter snow ploughing is undertaken wholly by Huakan. Helicopter access 
from Revelstoke takes approximately 15 minutes. 
 
Road access within the property is via four-wheel drive or tracked vehicle. Several 
overgrown trails access the majority of the workings on the property but are slow and 
difficult. 
 
5.2 CLIMATE 
 
The summer weather is considered moderate with average temperatures between 16° to 
30°C, with long stretches of sun and rain. The rain at times can be very heavy. The average 
precipitation is 65 cm/y. Winters are long and are characterized by heavy snowfalls (1 to 4 
m) with cool temperatures (-15°C to +5°C). Snowfall typically occurs between October and 
May at higher elevations and between November and April at lower elevations. 
 
Exploration and mining activities may be conducted year-round. 
 
5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES 
 
There is a large, skilled workforce of trades and technical professionals as well as equipment 
suppliers available throughout the region. The economy of Revelstoke is dependent on four 
primary sectors, forestry, tourism, transportation (mainly CP Rail) and public services. 
 
5.4 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The property has several adits and numerous trenches. Only two adits are accessible but are 
currently locked for safety requirements (830 Adit and 832 Adit). There is a fully functional 
40-man camp as well as a large shop and office facility located in the immediate vicinity of 
the portal to the 832 Adit. Electric power is produced by on-site diesel generators and a 
satellite phone and internet system is in place. Selkirk Helicopters occasionally uses the 
Property as a re-fueling station for their operations. A skid-mounted fuel tank is located 
about 200 m from the 832 portal on the Forest Service Road. 
 



 

 20

The nearest population centre is the town of Revelstoke (population approx. 8,500), which is 
located approximately 35 km to the south of the Property. Revelstoke lies on the Trans-
Canada Highway. The Canadian Pacific Railway runs through the town and a rail siding and 
load-out facility (owned by Huakan) is present on the eastern end of the town. A short 
asphalt airstrip on the south side of town can accommodate small charter planes and 
helicopters. 
 
The Revelstoke Dam on the Columbia River is located 2 km north of Revelstoke and 
produces power for a large portion of British Columbia. There are no power lines running 
along Highway 23, although there is an underground telephone line. 
 
There is a helicopter-accessible ski chalet located 5 km east of the J&L Property on the lower 
portion of the Durrand Glacier. It is used for heli-skiing in the winter and alpine hiking in the 
summer. 
 
5.5 PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The topography is characteristic of the Selkirk Mountains. The elevation ranges from 700 to 
3,050 m amsl. The topographic relief is a result of recent alpine glaciation. Incised creeks 
such as McKinnon Creek created narrow valley floors while major creeks (e.g., Carnes 
Creek) exhibit a broader U-shaped appearance with potentially deep valley-bottom 
overburden. The talus covered slopes are steep, ranging from 28° to 40° while bedrock slopes 
range up to near vertical, depending on the lithology. All of these conditions make traversing 
the property hazardous and time-consuming. 
 
Numerous avalanche chutes occur in the area. An avalanche chute occurs beside the 830 Adit 
portal which prompted the driving of the 832 trackless Drift. The 832 Drift allows safe year-
round access to the underground network. Flat ground is limited on the property, but appears 
to be sufficient enough for a millsite, tailings and waste rock storage.  
 
The main watercourse on the Property is Carnes Creek, which transects the area. Its source is 
the Durrand Glacier, which is east of the Property. McKinnon Creek is a tributary of Carnes 
Creek and is a more juvenile watercourse in which the flow volume can change rapidly. The 
area surrounding the intersection of McKinnon and Carnes Creeks has been the focus of the 
majority of the work over the life of the property. 
 
Vegetation on the property changes from alder, devil's club, stinging nettles and deadfalls in 
the valley floor, through stands of cedar, hemlock and minor fir on the mountainsides, to sub-
alpine to alpine plants at approximately 1,980 m elevation. The Carnes and Tumbledown 
Glaciers are immediately east of the Property boundary.

6.3 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
An historic mineral resource estimate was prepared by Equinox Resources Ltd. in 1991 for 
the Main Zone; however, it is not discussed further since the resource could not be validated 
and has been superseded by an NI 43-101 compliant resource. The P&E mineral resource 
estimate, as of the date of this report, is considered to be the only current and valid estimate 
for the J&L Main Zone deposit that is verified by a Qualified Person. 
 
In 1991, Equinox Resources Limited completed a historical resource estimate for the J&L 
deposit as shown in Table 6.3.  
 

Table 6.3  
Summary of the Historical Resource Estimates for the J&L Deposit 

 
Zone Type Tonnage and Grade 

Main Zone Proven & Probable Ore Reserves 1.7 Mt grading 7.38 g Au/t, 75.9 g Ag/t, 2.64% Pb, 4.43% Zn. 
Main Zone Possible Ore Reserves 1.9 Mt grading 7.12 g Au/t, 85.5 g Ag/t, 3.32% Pb, 3.48% Zn. 
Yellowjacket Zone Probable Ore Reserves 693,000 t grading 52.3 g Ag/t, 2.45% Pb, 7.06% Zn. 
Yellowjacket Zone Possible Ore Reserves 337,000 t grading 53.1 g Ag/t, 2.50% Pb, 7.15% Zn. 

 
The reader is cautioned that the above listed Resource and Reserve Estimates are dated prior 
to 2001 and are not compliant with the reporting requirements of NI 43-101.  Estimates for 
the Main Zone have been superseded by the 2011 P&E resource estimate for the J&L 
Property dated 23 June, 2011, as described in Section 16 of this report.  
 
In 2007, David Makepeace, P.Eng., authored a technical report on the J&L Property in which 
a mineral estimate map was created using the historic data to depict the non-compliant 



 

 24

historic mineral resource (see Figure 6.2). Makepeace used a standard circular polygonal 
calculation, weighted average method for both zones.  
 

Figure 6.2  
Historical Mineral Estimate Map for the J&L Property 

 

 
 
The 1998 scoping study by H.A. Simons provided analyses of six cases, exclusively on the 
Main Zone (i.e., the Yellowjacket Zone was not analyzed). The two favoured cases were: 
 

 Base case at 1,000 t/d with all processing at McKinnon Creek; 
 

 Base case at 1,500 t/d, grind, float and pressure oxidize at Goldstream, required a 4 
Mt deposit.  
 

The capital costs for the above scenarios above were $81.7 million and $115 million, 
respectively. At metal prices of US$ 350/oz Au, US$6/oz Ag, US$ 0.55/lb Zn and 
US$0.30/lb Pb, and a Canadian to United States dollar exchange rate of 0.70, the following 
key economic analyses for the two scenarios were: 
 

 IRR of 13.8 and 18.0 respectively; 
 Net Cash Flow of $75.7 million and $103.8 million, respectively; 
 NPV @ 5% Discount Rate of $36.0m and $58.7m, respectively; 
 Operating costs/tonne of $87/tonne and $64/tonne, respectively; 
 Operating cost/oz Au Equivalent Recovered of $242/oz and $180/oz, respectively.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 GEOLOGY 
 
The J&L Property is underlain by north to northwest striking, moderate to steeply east 
dipping metasediments and metavolcanic rocks of the Hamill and Lardeau Group and 
Badshot and Mohican Formation rocks. These units consist, for the most part, of sheared to 
intensely folded impure quartzites, quartz sericite to sericite to chlorite schists and phyllites, 
and grey banded to carbonaceous limestones. 
 
A stratigraphic column displaying the age relationships of units is presented below and 
detailed in Figure 7.1.

Badshot Formation - limestone/marble 
Mohican Formation (quartzite, phyllite) 
 
Neoproterozoic – Lower Cambrian 
 
Hamill Group (quartzite, micaceous quartzite, phyllite) 

 
7.1.1 Hamill Group 
 
The Hamill Group rocks are predominantly interbedded medium brown to green-black 
sericitic and/or chloritic quartzite and phyllite with minor layers of argillite and graphite. 
This unit appears as the upper Hamill unit described by Logan et al. (1996), and is probably 
Lower Cambrian in age. Hamill group rocks form part of the footwall and hanging wall of 
the Main Zone deposit. The unit has a gradational upper contact with the Mohican/Badshot 
Formations. 
 
7.1.2 Mohican Formation 
 
The Mohican Formation is Lower Cambrian in age (Fritz et al., 1991). This unit is located at 
the eastern and southern boundary of the property. The eastern unit is in the hanging wall of 
the Main Zone. It is characterized as limonite-rich, sericitic chloritic calcareous phyllite and 
quartzite interlayered with narrow layers of marble. Logan describes the Mohican as a 



 

 26

"transition between quartz-rich sediments of the Hamill Group and the carbonate-rich rocks 
of the Badshot Formation" (Logan et al., 1997A). 
 
7.1.3 Badshot Formation 
 
The Badshot Formation is the most visible and distinctive lithologic unit within the claims. It 
is Lower Cambrian in age. This white to grey, fine to medium-grained 
limestone/dolomite/marble varies in its silica content. The Yellowjacket Zone is totally 
contained within this unit. The higher silica content of the Yellowjacket Zone appears to be 
alteration specific to the Yellowjacket mineralizing system. The Main Zone crosscuts the 
Badshot Formation as observed in the 830 tracked Drift. Several diamond drill holes display 
elevated grades and widths where the Main Zone cross-cuts the Badshot Formation. Thin 
interlayers of black graphite are seen within the Badshot in the 832 Level portal. 
 
7.1.4 Index Formation 
 
The Index Formation can be subdivided into at least four units (i.e. black phyllite, marble, 
greenstone and quartz breccia), but only two have been identified on the Property. 
 
The black phyllite unit is in the footwall of the Main Zone. Logan has also traced the unit in 
the northern portions of the claims around the A&E showings (see Section 7.5). The unit can 
be calcareous and graphitic and may contain minor marble and quartzite layers. 
 
The greenstone units within the Property occur as a series of diorite sills. The diorite is 
composed predominantly of coarse-grained chlorite and plagioclase feldspar. The closest sill 
is approximately 500 m northwest of the intersection of the Main Zone with McKinnon 
Creek). Another diorite sill is immediately east of the Roseberry showing. A third sill is at 
the summit of Goat Mountain. 
 
7.1.5 Micaceous Quartzite Unit 
 
This unit is predominantly at the western edge of the Property and is well exposed along the 
Carnes Creek Forest Service Road. The unit is composed predominantly of quartzite to 
siliceous phyllite to quartz muscovite schist and may be loosely correlated to the Broadview 
Formation (Brown, 1991). 
 
7.1.6 Jowett Formation 
 
This unit is exposed in the first kilometre of the Carnes Creek Forest Service Road. It is an 
interlayered green metavolcanic and non-carbonaceous marble. This unit forms the hanging 
wall of the Columbia River Fault in the area of the claims.

7.2 DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
Proximal to the Main Zone, the lithological assemblage consists of phyllite and schist (87%), 
limestone (8%), quartzite (5%), and rare dykes as shown by core logging from the 
2010/2011 drill campaign. 
 
The phyllite and schist units are moderately to well foliated, consisting of variable amounts 
of sericite, chlorite, and quartz. Chlorite, though in minor amounts, is considered the major 
contributor of the distinctive green hue in the units. Some banded sericite-chlorite-phyllite 
zones, ranging in width from 0.5 to 2.0 m, have a distinctive brownish hue due to the 
presence of fine-grained biotite or phlogopite. Although the phyllite is highly sheared and 
strongly foliated, feldspar phenocrysts are noted in the core indicating a possible mixing of a 
volcanic and/or sedimentary protolith. 
 
There are two types of intercalated limestone seen in core proximal to the Main Zone, 
namely carbonaceous limestone and banded limestone. The interlayered beds vary in width 
from 1.0 to 20.0 m. The carbonaceous limestone units are fine to medium grained, dark grey 
to black in color, weakly to moderately foliated, and intensely jointed. The banded limestone 
units are light to medium grey in color with a medium-grained texture.  
 
Quartzite beds consist of centimetre to metre thick intercalated layers of milky white quartz 
of varying purity. Minor amounts of sericite and/or chlorite are developed on foliation 
planes. 
  
Late stage porphyritic intrusions are present as rare dykes. They are dark greyish green to 
brown in colour and medium-grained, composed of feldspar, quartz, and varying amounts of 
biotite. Only one dyke occurrence was seen in one drill hole from the 2010/2011 drill 
program. Its upper and lower contacts were sharp. 
 
7.2.1 Structure 
 
The dominant structure on the Property is a lithologic fabric that strikes north-westerly 
(striking about 330°) and dips (about 50°) toward the northeast. Near the southern edge of the 
J&L Crown-granted claims the lithology changes strike to a more east-west orientation 
(striking about 290°) and dipping northeast (about 40°). This change may be part of the 
Carnes Creek anticline (Logan et al., 1997A) or late stage deformation. 
 
In general, the rocks in the area are faulted and intensely folded. One penetrative foliation 
has been imposed on all rock types and is the most readily recognizable feature. An early-
stage foliation is still preserved and is best observed in silicified phyllite or quartz schist. 
However, most early-stage deformation features are only rarely preserved due to intense late-
stage folding and strong shearing. 
 
The Badshot Formation in the vicinity of the known deposits is recumbently overturned 
(Logan et al., 1997A). This rather ductile unit tends to flow under tectonic pressure and can 



 

 29

form random boudinage structures that have become dispersed by the flowage. Some 
structural folding can be seen underground but is not excessive and is usually confined to the 
Main Zone wall rocks although the Main Zone mineralization is not affected. Limestone is 
much more ductile than argillite or quartzite, and only locally where completely enclosed by 
deformed limestone, is the mineralization affected by folding. 
 
Two thrust sheets that strike north-westerly and dip to the east (Logan et al., 1997A) have 
been identified in the project area. Otherwise, faulting is almost exclusively confined to the 
Main Zone. Barely visible slips with a thin smear of gouge have been observed running along 
portions of the Main Zone. Occasionally, the heaviest of these faults can become randomly 
diverted into one of the walls, carrying the mineralized zone with it. Displacement along the 
faults is generally minor. 
 
The Main Zone is a shear-hosted, sheeted, sulphide replacement deposit, which has 
overprinted a pre-existing carbonate hosted Ag-Pb-Zn deposit. The Main Zone appears to lie 
within a high angle thrust fault and crosscuts lithology along strike at a low angle. The shear 
zone is preferably developed near the contact between the limestone and phyllite or between 
quartz-rich schist and phyllite. Limestone tends to occur on the footwall of the mineralized 
zone along about half of the exposed underground strike length. 
 
For much of the Main Zone exposed along strike in the underground workings, the zone is 
quite tabular with parallel sheeted massive and stringer sulphide bands but there are segments 
along strike where the banded massive sulphide units within the zone exhibit complex 
deformation textures. There are a number of indicators of shear sense, such as stretching 
lineation, rotated clasts, sheath folds, and asymmetric micro-folds. The asymmetrical folds 
indicate a dextral rotation. 
 
The Ag-Pb-Zn-bearing Yellowjacket Zone is considered to be the remnant of a much larger 
pre-existing carbonate hosted deposit which has subsequently been modified (remobilized, 
augmented and replaced) by the Main Zone structure and mineralizing system. 
 
7.3 MINERALIZATION  
 
7.3.1 Main Zone Mineralization 
 
The Main Zone is a structurally-controlled precious metal and polymetallic base metal 
sheeted sulphide (Au-Ag-Pb-Zn-As) deposit. The deposit has quite a reliable and predictable 
geometry. The zone is sheet-like or tabular with an average dip of 55° to the northeast. The 
zone of sheeted massive and stringer sulphide veining has an average width of 2.5 m but the 
sheeted sulphide veining can reach 15 m in true thickness. The continuity of the zone is 
broken by its absence in a few places within narrow sections as shown in Figure 7.2. 
 
The deposit comes to surface with a surface strike trace of at least 3.34 km and a vertical 
extent of at least 0.8 km. It is speculated that the Main Zone is linked to the Roseberry 
Prospect and may also be linked to the former Mastodon Mine. This gives a collective 



 

 30

distance of 9 km. Underground drifting has traced the deposit for 850 m (830 Level) and 
drilling has traced the deposit for 1,500 m along strike.  
 
The Main Zone is composed of closely spaced bands of massive sulphides which frequently 
coalesce at its widest parts. Individual bands, which are generally tabular, may die out along 
strike over tens of metres but appear to resume in an adjacent band. Individual massive 
sulphide bands frequently range from 5 cm to 1 m thick. Sulphide minerals include pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, gold-bearing arsenopyrite, iron-rich sphalerite (blackjack), galena, tetrahedrite and 
trace chalcopyrite. There are also traces of silver-lead-antimony and lead-antimony 
sulphosalts. The banding ranges from predominantly arsenopyrite (high gold), to mixed 
arsenopyrite and massive sulphides, to massive sphalerite with no arsenic present. 
 

Figure 7.2  
Main Zone Inclined Longitudinal Section 

 

 
 
Where the mineralization narrows, it is almost completely composed of arsenopyrite. As the 
zone of mineralization widens, the sulphide assemblage is more diverse where it is in contact 
with, or is completely enclosed by, limestone. Between mineralized bands, the host rock has 
been altered (sericite-quartz) and contains disseminated mineralization or thin massive to 
stringer sulphide streaks. 
 
Three distinct types of mineralization have been noted. Type I mineralization is comprised of 
massive bands, lenses and sulphide stringers in a sericitic shear zone. Sulphides consist of 
medium to coarse grained pyrite, variously grain sized arsenopyrite, and fine-grained 
fracture-filled sphalerite and galena. Some coarse-grained pyrite and arsenopyrite display a 



 

 31

brecciated texture. Type II mineralization is characterized by "milled" massive sulphide 
texture consisting of fine to coarse-grained, rounded to sub-rounded pyrite, arsenopyrite, 
quartz, and wall rock clasts in a very fine grained sulphide matrix. The matrix is composed of 
fine-grained pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena and quartz. Clasts derived from the host 
rock such as phyllite and schist contain sulphide stringers, which in part may represent Type 
I form of mineralization. This milled feature is interpreted as a mylonite texture developed by 
reworking within a structurally active shear zone. Milled sulphides carry high values of gold, 
silver, lead and zinc, and elevated mercury and antimony. 
 
Type III mineralization consists of narrow stringers and fine to medium disseminations of 
principally sphalerite, with lesser amounts of galena and pyrite and very little arsenopyrite. 
Sphalerite is red to honey yellow in color, seeming to replace limestone. Although Type III 
mineralization can reach widths of 6-10 m, it appears to have limited extent both along the 
strike and vertically. 
 
Gangue minerals include quartz, calcite, siderite, sericite, chlorite and graphite. 
 
The wall rock in the hanging wall and footwall is mostly composed of sericite-chlorite-
phyllite, quartz-sericite-chlorite-schist, and limestone. Phyllite and schist contain 1-5% 
pyrrhotite in the form of micro lenses on the foliation. An increase in pyrite development, 
concurrent with a sharp decrease in pyrrhotite, occurs in close proximity to the mineralized 
zone. Phyllite and schist are bleached due to sericitic alteration and silicification, resulting in 
apparent colour contrast between altered and unaltered rocks. Pervasive sericitization is 
extensively developed within the shear zone and its immediate hanging wall and footwall. 
The sericitic selvage ranges from 2 to 30 m wide. Marblization occurs immediately at the 
contact between limestone and the margins of the mineralized zone, varying in width from 
0.1 to 1 m. 
 
Pyrrhotite is disseminated ubiquitously throughout much of the non-mineralized rock in 
minor amounts. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite and pyrite are observed. 
 
Sub-parallel intermittent footwall and hanging wall zones of similar Type I, II and III 
mineralization occur proximal to the Main Zone. The HM1 zone lies approximately 5 m into 
the hanging wall of the Main Zone. The HM2 zone lies approximately 8-10 m into the 
hanging wall of the Main Zone. 
 
The FM1 zone lies approximately 2.5-10 m into the footwall of the Main Zone and has a 
degree of continuity. The FM2 zone lies approximately 15-20 m into the hanging wall of the 
Main Zone. 
 
7.4 YELLOWJACKET ZONE MINERALIZATION 
 
The Yellowjacket Zone is a stratabound carbonate-hosted, lead-zinc-silver deposit that is 
generally sub-parallel to the Main Zone. It is located approximately 30 m into the hanging 
wall of the Main Zone. The lead-zinc-silver mineralization is confined to multiple discrete 



 

 32

zones related to siliceous carbonate units. The deposit does not outcrop but is defined only by 
drilling. Limited drilling (35 holes) has traced the deposit along strike for 500 m but remains 
open laterally in both directions and at depth. The deposit appears to pitch to the southeast at 
30°. 
 
The Yellowjacket deposit has no arsenic content. The mineralization is composed of patchy 
massive zinc-rich honey-coloured sphalerite (yellowjack) with minor medium-grained 
disseminated galena with elevated silver values. Other minerals include calcite, silica and 
minor sericite and siderite. Texturally, the mineralization can be foliated and/or laminated 
with sphalerite and galena running along cleavage surfaces. Other textures include brecciated 
or lacework patterns. Dolomite sections show discontinuous banding and are usually lower in 
grade. 
 
The carbonate units hosting the Yellowjacket deposit may be located in the hinge of a 
recumbent isoclinal fold, fringed by phyllite and quartzite. The mineralization appears to 
thicken in the apparent fold hinge where darker coloured sphalerite and coarser and more 
abundant galena occurs. The Yellowjacket Zone is intensely silicified. Sericite has also been 
observed in core samples. Silicification also appears to intensify towards the apparent fold 
hinge. Fluorite is common in most mineralized sections, particularly near higher grade 
sections. Pyrite and pyrrhotite are present in low amounts. 
 
7.5 OTHER MINERALIZATION 
 
The Roseberry showing lies on the J&L Property (082M 091) 4.5 km to the northwest of the 
Main Zone (see Figure 7.1). The polymetallic (Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag-Au) vein-type showing lies just 
below the contact of Lardeau graphitic schists and Badshot Formation limestones. Although 
it has been known for almost a century, it has received only minor surface exploration due to 
its remote location. The mineralization is composed of coarse disseminated to semi-massive 
arsenopyrite in discontinuous quartz carbonate veins hosted by intensely sheared graphitic 
schist. The mineralization resembles the Main Zone mineralization. Chip sampling of the 
Roseberry showing returned values such as 15.03 g/t Au and 37.4 g/t Ag across 0.3 m. 
 
The A & E showing lies on the J&L Property (082M 099) 5 km north of the Main Zone and 2 
km northeast of the Roseberry showing. The mineralization is related to sheared schistose 
zones with intense deformation and complex folding, interlayered with or in contact with 
limestone. This polymetallic (Ag-Pb-Zn-As) showing represents a series of three parallel 
mineralized zones similar to the Main Zone. One of the zones averaged 11.01 g/t Au, 356.7 
g/t Ag, 10.75% Zn and 5.48% Pb from four muck samples. It is a narrow arsenical zone of 
massive sulphides. There are several hand-tooled short adits and surface showings that have 
traced the zone for 400 m along strike and 160 m vertically. It has not been drill tested at 
depth. The A & E prospect represents the potential for multiple parallel zones of 
mineralization. 
 
The Copper Zone is located 100 to 150 m into the footwall of the Main Zone. It is a narrow 
stringer sulphide zone hosted by quartzites and chloritic phyllites and schists, and has been 



 

 33

traced for 320 m horizontally and 90 m vertically. Although it does not appear to return 
economic grades at surface, the showings are leached and weathered. A chip sample by 
Equinox returned 3.55 g/t Au, 21.7 g/t Ag and 0.19% Cu over 1.0 m. This zone could be 
tested further by diamond drilling.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The J&L Property lies at the northern end of the Kootenay Arc which is known for its Irish-
type carbonate hosted Zn-Pb, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) and sedimentary 
exhalative (Sedex) deposits. The two deposits on the J&L Property are the Main Zone and 
the Yellowjacket Zone. An idealized generic Sedex-type deposit model is shown in Figure 
8.1.  
 

Figure 8.1  
Generic Sedex-type Deposit Model  

 

 
Wilkinson, 2007. 
 
8.1 MAIN AND YELLOWJACKET ZONES 
 
8.1.1 Main Zone 
 
The Main Zone mineralization lies in an inferred shear zone, characterized by sheeted 
massive to semi-massive sulphide bands and stringers spatially associated with the 
Yellowjacket Zone. 
 
The Main Zone mineralization cross-cuts lithologies at low angles and appears to represent a 
high angle thrust zone. The deposit is relatively tabular, continuous and predictable, much 



 

 35

like a replacement vein in a broad sense. Surface exploration has traced the Main Zone for 3 
km. The drilling to date demonstrates that the Main Zone continues for a strike length of at 
least 1.2 km and in the down dip direction for at least 800 m. There remains good potential 
for additional resources on the Main Zone, which remains open in the down dip direction and 
along strike to the northwest and southeast. In the respect to this size, the deposit fits a large 
structure. The Main Zone averages 2.5 m thick of sheeted sulphide veining but the sheeting 
can reach up to 15 m true thickness. It is a complex banded zinc-lead-silver-gold-arsenic 
deposit, partly having a close spatial relationship with limestone. Massive to semi-massive 
bands and stringers parallel or subparallel the dominant lithologic foliation, reflecting a 
strong structural domain, which is typical of fracture-fill deposits. 
 
A long-standing oversimplification stated by previous workers that Main Zone occurs at the 
contact of footwall limestone with hanging wall phyllites. In fact, 2010/2011 drill program 
identified that the majority of Main Zone is more likely to occur at the base of the limestone 
unit in contact with footwall phyllites. 
 
The close spatial relationship between mineralization and limestone can be interpreted for 
four reasons. Firstly the contact of limestone and phyllite is favourable for the development 
of a shear zone. Secondly the competency contrast between limestone and phyllite creates a 
favorable condition to allow dilation within the shear zone. Thirdly, limestone is a good 
structural seal. Fourthly, carbonaceous limestone is a good reducing agent in the process of 
gold precipitation. 
 
Based on the detailed geological core logging, the mineralization is stronger when the shear 
zone cuts the phyllite unit rather than more schistose lithologies. This can be interpreted that 
the schist units are more competent than phyllite, so the hydraulic fracturing is more 
susceptible in phyllites than in schists at the same fluid pressure. 
 
The Main Zone does not easily fit into a specific genetic model. Geologists who have worked 
on the Main Zone in the past have proposed a sedimentary exhalative model (Sedex) model, 
a volcanogenic massive sulphide model (VMS), a replacement model and a shear hosted 
model. 
 
Huakan geologists interpret the Main Zone to be a shear hosted sheeted sulfide replacement 
deposit, which has overprinted the pre-existing carbonate hosted Ag-Pb-Zn Yellowjacket 
deposit and that the Yellowjacket is essentially a mere remnant of its former self. That much 
larger pre-existing carbonate hosted deposit has been cut and modified (remobilized, 
augmented and replaced) by the Main Zone structure and mineralizing system. 
 
8.1.2  Yellowjacket Zone 
 
It has been interpreted that the Yellowjacket Zone was first formed as a carbonate-hosted Zn-
Pb deposit and was followed by the shear-hosted Main Zone. The Yellowjacket Zone has a 
close affinity to the Irish-type carbonate hosted Zn-Pb deposits which are characterized by: 
 



 

 36

 Active tectonics during sedimentation and some of the mineralization; 
 
 Deposits are hosted by Carboniferous carbonates; 
 
 Strong structural control seen in the deposits; 
 
 Mineralization is stratabound with some local sections which cross cut stratigraphy; 
 
 Mineralization textures are generally replacive and brecciated but locally banding is 

evident; 
 
 Iron and magnesium carbonates seen in and around the mineralization; 
 
 Zinc, lead, iron, copper and silver are known in the deposits and have some zoning 

laterally and vertically (see Figure 8.2); 
 
 Isotopes point to two fluids being involved in the process, one hydrothermal and the 

other Carboniferous sea water, 
 
 Fluid inclusions indicate that the temperature ranges from 100°C to 300°C. 
 

Typically, the Yellowjacket deposit occurs about 30 m into the hanging wall (northeast) from 
and sub parallels the Main Zone, however, locally there is Yellowjacket type mineralization 
in the immediate hanging wall of the Main Zone as observed in the underground cross-cuts. 
The Yellowjacket deposit is stratiform, exclusively hosted within folded intensely silicified 
carbonate rocks. The Yellowjacket Zone is composed of a patchy massive honey-coloured 
(zinc-rich) sphalerite with minor disseminated galena and elevated silver values. The 
mineralization appears to be confined to favourable carbonate rocks that have been folded 
into a recumbent overturned anticline straddled by phyllite. Grade and thickness increases 
towards the hinge of the fold. Fluorite is present and barite is absent in the Yellowjacket, 
unlike the Irish-type deposits.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
9.1 PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
There remains good potential for additional resources in the Main Zone, which remains open 
in the down dip direction and along strike to the northwest and southeast. Extensive drilling 
has indicated a traceable continuous plane with virtually no fault offsets, cut-offs or fault 
drags zones. Exploration over the Property life has confirmed persistent vertical and 
horizontal continuity although there is reference to an element of improved grade in en-
echelon series of northwest plunging lenses that strengthen with depth. 
 
Details of historical exploration on the property can be found in Section 6.0, History.  
 
9.1.1 Geology/Prospecting 
 
The J&L deposit has been intermittently explored for over 100 years. The initial recorded 
mapping and prospecting was done by Dr. Gunning of the GSC in 1928. Other companies 
that have mapped and prospected the J&L deposit include Piedmont Mines Ltd. (1929), 
Westairs Mines Ltd. (1963 to 1965), BP Selco (1981 to 1985), Equinox Resources Ltd. 
(1989) and Weymin Mining Corporation (1996 to 1997). The results of these mapping 
programs identified the surface trace of the Main Zone and several other parallel mineralized 
structures. No geological mapping or prospecting has been carried out by Huakan on the J&L 
Property. 
 
9.1.2 Geochemistry 
 
Geochemical surveys were conducted on the J&L deposit by BP Selco (1981 to 1985), 
Equinox Resources Ltd. (1989) and Weymin Mining Corporation (1996 to 1997). 
Geochemical soil anomalies (Zn, Pb and As) identified the surface trace of the Main Zone 
and the Copper Queen Zone. No geochemical soil sampling surveys have been carried out by 
Huakan on the J&L Property. 
 
9.1.3 Geophysics 
 
The first geophysical survey on the property was a helicopter-based, input electromagnetic 
survey completed in May 1982 by Selco Inc. The center of the Questor survey was located at 
51º22'N and 118º 15'N with a total of 699 km flown covering an area of 232 km2. The main 
purpose of the survey was to delineate the structure which hosts the J&L zone and to trace 
any extension to the known mineralization. Approximately 22 anomalous responses were 
picked up from the Questor survey, 11 of which were found within the existing claim 
boundaries. 
 
Nine of these responses were in potentially favorable geological settings and three were 
considered priority targets. No response was shown over the J&L deposit itself, although the 
survey did not adequately cover the extent of the known surface trace of the J&L Main Zone. 



 

 39

Due to incomplete cover of the Questor Input survey, a helicopter-based Dighem II 
electromagnetic survey was flown in August, 1982, covering a portion of the area covered by 
the earlier Questor survey. The Dighem II survey was carried out along 396 km of flight lines 
covering an area of 396 km2. During the Dighem survey, only three new anomalies were 
recognized and comparisons were made between the Questor and Dighem surveys to 
delineate any anomaly commonalities between the two surveys. A weak response was 
detected approximately on strike with the J&L Main Zone, 1 km south of the McKinnon 
Creek valley. 
 
During July, 1991 a program of ground transient Electromagnetic surveying was carried out 
on the J&L Property by Frontier Geosciences Inc. on behalf of Equinox Resources Ltd. The 
survey entailed 7.2 km of coverage testing 700 m of strike of the surface expression of the 
Main Zone. A base line was established along the northwest-southeast projected axis of the 
target and perpendicular lines were established every 100 m. A transmitter loop was laid out 
downslope and to the southwest of the survey grid. 
 
Two EM anomalies typical of the proposed geological target were observed as a result of this 
survey. The stronger of the two anomalies occurred at the south-west corner of the north-
west end of the survey grid near the valley bottom and appeared unrelated to the 
location/strike of the Main Zone. No geologic explanation was given for this anomaly, which 
was speculated to be caused by graphitic content as found in outcrop 400 m to the north-west 
of the anomaly. 
 
The second anomaly was clearly attributed to the Main Zone. Responses to the target zone 
were observed on all lines surveyed across the main grid. The zone is typically evident as a 
strong anomaly, observed into the middle time channels. Although the overall response 
reflects a large, tabular zone, particularly on the more north-westerly lines, there is evidence 
which suggests the zone may contain multiple conductors.  
 
No geophysical survey work has been carried out by Huakan on the J&L Property. 
 
9.1.4 Trenching 
 
There have been a total of 52 trenches excavated on the property from 1925 to 1982. Twenty 
of these trenches were dug by Westairs Mines Ltd. between 1962 and 1967. The trenches 
assisted in delineating the surface expression of the Main Zone over Goat Mountain. The 
primary documentation related to surface trenching on the J&L Property is found in the 
Summary Report on the J&L Option by R. Pegg for Selco Inc. In Pegg's report there is 
detailed documentation regarding the geological description of 26 individual closely-spaced 
surface trenches following approximately 1.2 km of strike along the Main Zone. This report 
also provides the assay data for each of the sampled mineralized trench intervals. Also 
included within Pegg's 1982 report are the descriptions of 11 mineral showings, mainly 
located between trench 24 and trench 26 at the south-east end of the surface expression of the 
Main Zone. 
 



 

 40

Micon is aware of 545 samples that were taken within the various trenches on the property. 
 
No trenching work has been carried out by Huakan. 
 
9.2 RECENT EXPLORATION 
 
Huakan has not performed any exploration on J&L Property except underground drifting and 
drilling.  Drilling was carried out from the existing mine workings during the fall of 2010 
into the winter of 2011.  The goal of the drilling was to increase the amount of indicated 
resources for the main zone.  Details are provided in Section 10.1. 

 
9.3 CURRENT EXPLORATION 
 
Huakan has recently implemented Phase II of its exploration program, the goal of which is to 
increase measured and indicated resources to 1.35 Mt.  Phase II is estimated to take 
approximately 8 months to complete.   
 
9.3.1 Permitting 
 
For the Phase II program, Huakan submitted an application for permit amendments to the 
government.  The submittal includes design work for the relocation of the sulphide-bearing 
waste rock pile. This was a condition before any new tunneling was allowed. The 
government also requested that the 832 portal be shotcreted before resuming underground 
activities.  The second portion of the submittal is to increase the permitted amount of new 
drifting. The permit was granted and Phase II is underway. The portal has been shotcreted. A 
lined PAG waste rock pad was constructed and the PAG waste rock generated from the 2008 
tunnelling campaign has been re-located to the lined pad.  
 
9.3.2 Drifting 
 
An estimated four months will be required to drive 452 m of track drift, at a rate of 113 
m/month.  
 
9.3.3 Drilling  
 
It is anticipated that drilling will take place after drifting has been completed.  Drilling will 
require approximately two months, with two underground drill rigs completing a total of 
6,700 m of drilling.   
 



 

 41

10.0 DRILLING 
 
10.1 HUAKAN DIAMOND DRILLING 2007-2010 
 
In November, 2007, Merit completed a 1,363 m, nine hole surface drill program on the 
Yellowjacket Zone which had the objective of verifying historic drilling over a portion of the 
Yellowjacket deposit. The program successfully achieved this objective by intercepting 
multiple zinc-lead-silver zones similar in grade and width to previous drilling.  
 
In November, 2010, Merit/Huakan commenced Phase I of the exploration program, a 2,000 
m underground drill program which had the objective of verifying historic drilling and 
broadening the known resource in the Main Zone. The program was expanded to 7,897 m 
and was completed by early February, 2011 with the completion of 60 BQTW (thin wall) 
core holes.  
 
10.1.1 Collar Surveying 
 
At the completion of both the 2007 surface and 2010/2011 underground drill programs, 
drillhole collar locations of all holes were marked and surveyed by B.C. professional land 
surveyors. 
 
10.1.2 Downhole Surveying 
 
During the 2007 surface diamond drill program downhole surveys were carried out using an 
Easy-Shot tool, taking measurements at the bottom and midway for the first three holes. Due 
to a defective tool, the final three drill holes were tested by acid tests at the bottom of each 
hole.  
 
Downhole surveying in the 2010/2011 underground drill program utilized the FLEXIT 
SmartTool Drill Hole Survey system. Measurements were taken every 30 m down the hole, 
usually including a near-to-collar test as well as a near-to-bottom test. A declination factor of 
17º was added to all azimuth readings taken during the downhole surveys to give true 
azimuth readings for this region of British Columbia. Other data collected were dip angles 
recorded at the various downhole reading sites as well as magnetic susceptibility. A small 
number of the azimuth readings gave erroneous results caused by strong magnetism, and 
those readings were therefore eliminated. 
 
10.1.3 Core Recovery and Storage 
 
Core recoveries throughout the 2010/2011 underground J&L drill program were normally 
over 90% and often over 95%. All drillcore from both the 2007 and 2010/2011 drill programs 
are securely stored on the property, near the camp facility. 
 



 

 42

10.1.4 Contractor 
 
The 2007 diamond drill program was carried out by Elite Drilling Ltd. of Revelstoke, B.C. 
over the period October 23 to November 13, 2007. 
 
DMAC Drilling Ltd. of Aldergrove, B.C. was the drilling contractor for the 2010/2011 
program. Drilling took place between November 11, 2010 and January 31, 2011. Drilling 
was carried out on two 10-h shifts using two Hydracore drill rigs mounted on steel wheels, 
thus providing drill access to the tracked 830 main drift and cross-cuts. 
 
10.1.5 Security Procedures 
 
After taking custody of the drillcore, Huakan's geologists conduct an industry standard 
program of geological and geotechnical logging, photography, density measurements and 
core sampling. The core was logged in detail onto paper logs, and then entered into digital 
summary format. 
 
In the author's opinion the core transfer procedures and security measures conducted and 
described by Huakan conform to standard industry practice 
 
 



 

 43

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The following points describe the sampling procedures and steps taken during the 2010/2011 
drill program: 
 

 Core was first cleaned, organized and photographed;  
 
 Geotechnical logging was undertaken by a trained technician;  
 
 Core boxes were labelled using scribed aluminum tags; 
 
 Core logging and sample selection was performed by the site geologists; 
 
 In areas of Main Zone mineralization, sampling intervals were determined by similar 

sulphide abundance. Samples were generally 0.5 m long but rarely greater than 1.5 m 
long. A minor number of samples taken were less than 0.5 m in length, but not less 
than 0.25 m long; 

 
 Sampling was carried out beyond the limits of the Main Zone sulphides both into 

barren hanging wall and footwall rocks; 
 
 Every 18th, 19th and 20th sample tags were designated as a duplicate, standard and 

blank, respectively. The duplicate sample was a split of the sample preceding it (i.e., 
duplicate sample #18 is a 50% split of sample #17). Splitters retained the standards 
and blanks and placed the entire pouch of material into the labelled plastic sample bag 
in the corresponding tag order; 

 
 Core was logged, sampled and stored on site. The logging geologist placed a colour 

crayon line along the desired sample cut to provide an even bisection of the core; 
 
 The core was cut in half, bisecting fabric or vein material evenly; 
 
 Technicians were instructed to place the same side of core back into the box and the 

other into a labelled clean plastic sample bag that was then sealed using a zap-strap; 
 
 Sample bags were placed in address-labelled rice bags, sealed with plastic zap-straps 

and shipped from Revelstoke, B.C. by Greyhound Bus to Eco Tech Laboratory Ltd., 
Kamloops, B.C.; 

 
 Sample shipment records were maintained. Records were also kept of sample 

preparation, analysis requested and the person intended to receive the results;  
 
 Core sampling was carried out by use of a diamond blade core saw. The core sampler 

was highly experienced and sampling work was closely monitored by on-site core 
logging geologists; 



 

 44

 
 No core samples were taken by an employee, officer, director or associate of Huakan. 

 
Analytical work for the 2010/2011 drill programs was carried out by Eco Tech Laboratory 
Ltd. (Eco Tech) of 100041 Dallas Drive, Kamloops, B.C. Huakan has archived all of the 
original assay certificates for both the 2007 and 2010/2011 drill programs. 
 
Eco Tech is registered for ISO 9001:2008 by KIWA International (TGA-ZM-13-96-00) for 
the "provision of assay, geochemical and environmental analytical services". Eco Tech also 
participates in the annual Canadian Certified Reference Materials Project (CCRMP) and 
Geostats Pty bi-annual round robin testing programs. The laboratory operates an extensive 
quality control/quality assurance program, which covers all stages of the analytical process 
from sample preparation through to sample digestion and instrumental finish and reporting. 
 
Samples (minimum sample size 250-g) are catalogued and logged into the sample-tracking 
database. During the logging in process at the laboratory, samples are checked for spillage 
and general sample integrity. It is verified that samples match the sample shipment 
requisition provided by the clients. The samples are transferred into a drying oven and dried. 
Rock samples are crushed on a Terminator jaw crusher to -10 mesh ensuring that 70% passes 
through a Tyler 10 mesh screen. This is verified each batch. 
 
Every 35 samples a re-split is taken using a riffle splitter to be tested to ensure the 
homogeneity of the crushed material. A 250-g sub-sample of the crushed material is 
pulverized on a ring mill pulverizer, each batch ensuring that 85% passes through a 200 mesh 
screen. The sub-sample is rolled, homogenized and bagged in a pre-numbered bag. A barren 
gravel blank is prepared before each job in the sample prep to be analyzed for trace 
contamination along with the actual samples. 
 
For gold, a 30-g sample size is fire assayed along with certified reference materials using 
appropriate fluxes. The flux used is pre-mixed, purchased from Anachemia Science which 
contains Cookson Granular Litharge, (silver and gold free). The ratios are 66% litharge, 24% 
sodium carbonate, 2.7% borax, 7.3% silica. These charges may be adjusted with borax or 
silica based on the sample. Flux weight per fusion is 120g. Purified silver nitrate is used for 
inquartation. The resultant doré bead is parted and digested with aqua regia and then 
analyzed on an atomic absorption instrument (Perkin Elmer/Thermo S-Series AA 
instrument). Gold detection limit on AA is 0.03-100 g/t. Any gold samples over 100 g/t are 
run using a gravimetric analysis protocol. Each batch submitted is fire assayed as a batch.  
 
Appropriate standards and repeat/re-split samples (quality control components) accompany 
the samples on the data sheet for quality control assessment. For 30 element ICP, a 0.5-g 
sample is digested with a 3:1:2 (HCl:HNO3:H2O) for 90 minutes in a water bath at 95°C. The 
sample is then diluted to 10 ml with water. All solutions used during the digestion process 
contain beryllium, which acts as an internal standard for the ICP run. The sample is analyzed 
on a Thermo Scientific IRIS Intrepid II XSP/iCAP 6000 Series ICP unit. Certified reference 
material is used to check the performance of the machine and to ensure that proper digestion 



 

 45

occurred in the wet laboratory Quality control (QC) samples are run along with the client 
samples to ensure no machine drift or instrumentation issues occurred during the run 
procedure. Repeat samples (every batch of 10 or less) and re-splits (every batch of 35 or less) 
are also run to ensure proper weighing and digestion occurred. Results are printed along with 
accompanying quality control data (repeats, re-splits and standards). Any of the base metal 
elements that are over limit, Ag >100g/t; Cu, Pb, and Zn >10,000ppm) are run as an assay. 
 
Appropriate standards and repeat/re-split samples (quality control components) accompany 
the samples on the data sheet. The digested solutions are made to volume with reverse 
osmosis water and allowed to settle. An aliquot of the sample is analyzed on a Perkin 
Elmer/Thermo S-Series AA instrument. (Detection limit 0.01% AA). Instrument calibration 
is done by verified synthetic standards, which have undergone the same digestion procedure 
as the samples. Standards used narrowly bracket the absorbance value of the sample for 
maximum precision. 
 
It is the author's opinion that the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures 
employed by Huakan were satisfactory.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
12.1.1 P&E Site Visit 
 
The J&L Property was visited by Mr. Fred Brown, CPG, on December 17, 2010. Data 
verification sampling was done on diamond drill core, with 18 samples distributed in 18 
holes collected for assay. These samples were collected from both the current drill program 
as well as from a number of the historic (1991 and earlier) drill holes. An attempt was made 
to sample intervals from a variety of low and high-grade material. The chosen sample 
intervals were then sampled by taking complete sections of the remaining half-split core. The 
samples were then documented, bagged, and sealed with packing tape and were delivered by 
Mr. Brown to ALS Minerals (formerly referred to as ALS Chemex), 2103 Dollarton 
Highway in North Vancouver for analysis. 
 
ALS Minerals is the leading full-service provider of analytical geochemistry services for the 
global mining industry. With over 60 laboratories located in key mining districts on six 
continents, ALS Minerals maintains ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 17025:2005 certifications, 
provides clients with all internal quality control data, and maintains a library of detailed 
laboratory analytical methods required as the necessary documentation for 43-101 reporting. 
 
The quality system is composed of: 
 

 Certified Data Analysis: ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditations: The 
ALS Quality Management System (QMS) complies with the requirements of

 Fire Assay Au, Pt, and Pd by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), 
 Aqua Regia Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn and Mo by AA, 
 Four Acid Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Co by AA, 
 Aqua Regia Multi-element by ICP and MS, 
 Four Acid Multi-element by ICP and MS, 
 Peroxide Fusion Multi-element by ICP. 

 
At no time, prior to the time of sampling, were any employees or other associates of Huakan 
advised as to the location or identification of any of the samples to be collected.  
 
A comparison of the P&E independent sample verification results versus the original assay 
results for gold, silver, lead and zinc can be seen in Figure 12.1 to Figure 12.4.

12.1.2 Micon Site Visit 
 
On October 27, 2011, Micon conducted a site visit to the J&L Property for the purposes of 
this PEA.  
 
Micon's team at the site visit is listed below. 
 

Christopher Jacobs, CEng, MIMMM  Project Manager/Economic Analysis 
Catherine A. Dreesbach, P.E.    Senior Mining Engineer 
Bogdan Damjanović, P.Eng.    Senior Metallurgist 

 
Huakan was represented on site by Mr. Paul Cowley, VP Exploration, Mr. Fred Sveinson and 
Ms. Sandy Sveinson. Mr. David Willms, geological engineer with Klohn Crippen Berger 
Limited (KCBL), was present during the site visit, as part of KCBL's assessment of potential 
tailings storage sites. 
 
The following are some of Micon's observations during the site visit: 
 
Existing development at the J&L Property has been aimed at exposing ore for sampling and 
providing access for underground drilling. The 830 Adit, a track drift (8 ft by 8 ft) has been 
developed mostly in mineralization. Cross-cuts into the hanging wall provide drill cubbies, 
and a footwall cross-cut (15 ft by 15 ft) leads to the 832 Adit portal, which is currently used 
as the main access; the 830 portal lies too close to an avalanche chute for it to be used year-
round. Some earlier development on the 990 m elevation is no longer accessible. Some raises 
mined in mineralized material from the 830 Level are blind. 
 
Huakan has established an all-year camp, mobilized mining and maintenance personnel, and 
equipped a surface shop facility near the 832 Adit portal. Equipment on site includes EJC 
430 ADTs (30 short tons) and EJC 210 (6 yd3) scoop-trams. 
 
There has been a significant amount of metallurgical testwork studies completed on the 
deposit to date. Huakan confirmed that it plans to conduct a comprehensive metallurgical 
study, managed by Frank Wright, P.Eng., independent metallurgical consultant to the 
Company, which will produce adequate quantities of material to test the above flowsheet and 
provide data for equipment sizing and metal recovery forecasts.  Presently, this testwork is 
focused on the use of HMS to upgrade the mill feed. 
 
A helicopter tour of the site gave a very useful overview of some of the potential sites for a 
tailings storage facility (TSF).  
 
The proximity to Highway 23 and the town of Revelstoke are positive factors for the project. 
Re-alignment of the Forest Service road into the mine site is expected to be straight-forward.

12.2 HUAKAN QC PROGRAM 
 
12.2.1 Reference Material 
 
For the 2010/2011 drill programs, Huakan geologists inserted certified reference materials 
and blanks, which were obtained from CDN Resource Laboratories (CDN) of Langley, B.C. 
In addition, duplicate sampling was added to the sample stream.  
 
The CDN standards were CDN-ME-7 and CDN-ME-11. Standards were inserted into the 
sample stream at a rate of 1 in 20 by the project geologists. Certified reference material is 
inserted regularly into batches of samples sent to the lab for analysis in order to monitor the 
accuracy (lack of bias) of the lab results. 
 
The CDN-ME-7 had a total of 36 data points and CDN-ME-11 had a total of 19 data points. 
Both standards were certified for gold, silver, lead and zinc and both performed extremely 
well with all data points falling within the +/- two standard deviations from the mean. 
 
12.2.2 Blanks 
 
Huakan purchased blanks consisting of pulverized river rock (predominantly granite) from 
CDN for use in the 2010-2011 drilling programs. CDN's assaying of the blank material 
found it to contain <0.01 g/t Au. 
 
Blanks were inserted into the sample stream at a rate of 1 in 20, for a total of 55 data points.  
 
All data points for gold and silver were well below the upper threshold of three times the 
detection limit for the element in question, which was the upper threshold set for monitoring 
blank results. Lead returned an average value of 0.002% with a standard deviation of 0.0006. 
Zinc returned an average value of 0.005% with a standard deviation of 0.0005. All results 
indicate no contamination present at the analytical level. 
 
12.2.3 Duplicate Sampling Program 
 
For the 2010/2011 J&L drill program a duplicate core sampling procedure was implements in 
order to quantify precision (reproducibility) of analytical results at the field level.  
 
For the purposes of this data verification, drill core duplicates were inserted into the sample 
stream at a rate of 1 in 20. A duplicate sample consisted of a 50% split of the numbered 
sample interval immediately preceding the duplicate sample. For example in a normal 
sampling stream, every 17th core sample provides the 50% split for the 18th or duplicate 
sample.  
 
In addition, P&E examined the laboratory coarse reject duplicates and pulp duplicates for 
gold, silver, lead and zinc. The coarse reject data set contained on average 27 pairs, and the 



 

 51

pulp data set contained 239 pairs for gold, 95 pairs for silver, 100 pairs for lead and 104 pairs 
for zinc.  
 
Simple scatter graphs were plotted for the field, coarse reject and pulp duplicate pairs for the 
four metals. Precision improved steadily from the core duplicates through to the pulp 
duplicates. The precision at the pulp duplicate level for all four metals was excellent, with a 
1:1 ratio. 
 
12.2.4 Sampling and QC Recommendations  
 
The QC program as implemented and monitored by Huakan has ensured a robust, accurate 
and precise database that is suitable for resource estimation. It is recommended however, to 
source a coarse material to be used as a blank, such as sterile drill core or landscaping 
material that is required to pass through all stages of sampling reduction. The current 
pulverized blank material only monitors contamination at the analytical level.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Huakan has recently initiated metallurgical testing on the core samples obtained from J&L 
Property.  This testwork includes heavy media separation, grinding, several stages of 
flotation and pressure oxidation and bioleaching on a portion of the flotation products prior to 
cyanidation; however, these results were not available at the time this report was prepared; 
therefore this report has relied on previous test results, which are quite extensive The 
information in this section describes historical metallurgical testing performed by previous 
companies. Micon has not independently reviewed or assessed this testwork.  
 
13.1 SUMMARY  
 
Numerous mineralogical and metallurgical studies and reports have been carried out for the J&L 
Main Zone deposit. The metallurgy studies and assessments date from 1982 through to 2005 with 
particular effort made throughout the 1980's and 1990's in concert with exploration programs 
carried out by BP Canada (Selco) Ltd., Pan American Minerals Corporation, Equinox Resources 
Ltd., Cheni Gold Mines Ltd. (CGM) and Weymin Mining Corporation. The Weymin bulk 
sample work was substantial and was incorporated into the H.A. Simons 1998 scoping study. 
The most recent J&L report completed was for a metallurgical study carried out in 2005 on 
behalf of BacTech by PRA. The 1998 report by HA Simons and the 2006 report summary 
prepared by PRA are the primary sources of process data for this PEA. 
 
The payable metals in the ore include Au, Ag, Zn and Pb, roughly in order of economic 
importance.   
 
The general thrust of most testwork has been to try to separate the base metals by selective 
flotation, and then recover the precious metals from the tails by some combination of additional 
flotation together with hydrometallurgical process such as oxidation and cyanidation.  A number 
of schemes for this have been proposed and some tested. It is possible to carry out an important 
pre-treatment of the ore by HMS so as to reduce the mass that must be treated in the mill. 
 
The majority of the testwork to date has focused on producing saleable lead and zinc concentrates 
by various flotation separation techniques. In addition, some tests have been carried out on the 
refractory arsenopyrite concentrates where Cashman (chloride leach), Redox (nitrate leach), 
batch roasting, pressure oxidation and biooxidation techniques have been used, followed by 
cyanidation, to recover the precious metals.  
 
The J&L deposit is a fine grained massive polymetallic mineralized body with complex 
mineralogy. Major minerals present include pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, bournonite, freibergite, 
sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Preliminary test work indicated that the ore is amenable to heavy 
media separation (HMS) whereby up to half of the feed weight can be rejected with an estimated 
2% losses of the metal values. The liberation size and specific gravity for heavy media separation 
have not yet been optimized. The ore does require very fine primary grinding (P80 =44 μm) 
followed by regrinding to achieve only partial liberation.  
 
Gold appears in two modes.  The majority (80%-90%) occurs as solid solution within the 
arsenopyrite matrix. The second mode of gold occurrence (10%-20%) is as fracture 



 

 53

filling/veinlets in arsenopyrite or as coarse grains locked to gangue or other sulphides. This 
secondary gold occurrence liberates on grinding, floats with the lead concentrate and is cyanide 
leachable. The majority of the silver is present as freibergite and is in solid solution with the lead 
minerals.  Impurities are present either due to mineralogical makeup, or as less than 10 μm 
locked particles. Metal recoveries to sulphide concentrates are in the order of 98%, however, high 
recoveries of lead and zinc are limited because of cross-contamination resulting from fine particle 
locking.  
 
Gold and silver extraction from arsenopyrite concentrates treated by pressure oxidation and 
cyanidation were approximately 90% and 50%, respectively. Extractions for arsenopyrite 
concentrates treated by biooxidation and cyanidation were approximately 90% and 80%, 
respectively.  
 
13.2 METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
 
In May 1991, Bacon Donaldson Laboratory carried out work commissioned by Cheni Gold 
Mines Inc. (CGM) that focused on separating of the pyrite from arsenopyrite concentrates in 
order to upgrade gold grade and reduce sulphide in arsenopyrite concentrates. Bacon 
Donaldson developed a novel flotation process for removing a pyrite concentrate before 
activation of the sphalerite. It was possible to achieve 60% pyrite rejection with an arsenic 
content of 1%. The pyrite contained between 5% and 10% of the gold in the ore. In the same 
test, an arsenopyrite concentrate containing 30.4% arsenic and 35.5 g/t gold was produced. 
Locked cycle testing of the process was carried out before all parameters were optimized 
resulting in significant zinc loss to the arsenopyrite concentrate.  
 
In June, 1991, Bacon Donaldson carried out sink float separation on two samples of the 
Yellowjacket Zone for CGM. Bulk samples were crushed to -½-inch and screened at 4, 8 and 
14 mesh. HMS was carried out on material with specific gravities of 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9. Tests 
indicate that 33% to 51% of the feed weight could be rejected at less than 8% of the lead and 
zinc values.  
 
A flotation procedure developed in earlier test work by Bacon Donaldson was employed to 
produce lead, zinc, pyrite and arsenic concentrates. In this process, a lead rougher 
concentrate was floated first, followed by pyrite and zinc/arsenic. The lead and pyrite 
rougher concentrates were reground and cleaned. The zinc/arsenic rougher concentrate was 
reground and separated into a zinc concentrate and an arsenic concentrate.  
 
The arsenic concentrate was pressure leached to oxidize the arsenopyrite and to release the 
associated gold. Nearly complete arsenopyrite oxidation was achieved when leached at 8% 
solids for 3 hours at 190°C with 100 PSO oxygen over-steam pressure, and with the addition 
of 5 g/L H2SO4, 1 g/L Fe

2+ and 1 g/L Fe3+. The sulphide sulphur content in the arsenic 
concentrate was reduced from 18.3% to 0.21% and 92.4% of the arsenic and 97.4% of the 
iron were fixed in the leach residue. Cyanidation of the residue extracted 96% of the gold at a 
sodium cyanide consumption of 3.77 kg/t of arsenic concentrate.  
 



 

 54

A pressure leach test was also performed on a rougher tail generated from a conventional Pb-
Zn rougher float circuit. The rougher tail contained both pyrite and arsenopyrite. The 
pressure leach was aimed at selectively oxidizing the arsenopyrite to release the gold. While 
the pressure leach seemed to have oxidized the arsenopyrite, cyanidation of the residue only 
extracted 29.2% of the Au at a sodium cyanide consumption of 8.76 kg/t.  
 
Further test work was recommended to increase the recovery of zinc to the zinc concentrate.  
Based on all of the historic test work, H.A. Simons used recoveries of 80.4% Pb, 72.0% Zn, 
91.8% Au and 88.1% Ag in its 1998 scoping study.  
 
In 2005, BacTech continued metallurgical testing on the same six samples extracted by 
Weymin Mining Corporation. The samples were tested for bulk density and Bond Work 
Index (test data not available). Flotation tests were initially done using the individual 
samples. The three flotation concentrates were a gold-bearing arsenopyrite/pyrite 
concentrate, a lead concentrate, and a zinc concentrate.  A locked-cycle flotation test on 
three-product procedure returned acceptable recoveries and product grades. The results 
indicated that the total gold recovery obtained was 98.7%, of which 74.4% reported to the 
gold-bearing arsenopyrite/pyrite concentrate, 19.8% to the lead concentrate and 4.4% to the 
zinc concentrate. The grade of the arsenopyrite/pyrite concentrate was 18.9 g/t Au, 16.2 g/t 
Ag, 16.8% As and 37.5% Fe. The lead recovery was 79.7% in the lead concentrate. It had a 
grade of 45.1% Pb, 18.3% Zn, 2.2% As, 28.8 g/t Au and 1,028 g/t Ag. Approximately 80% 
of silver was recovered into the lead concentrate. The zinc concentrate recovered 73.6% Zn 
in a concentrate grade of 49.6% Zn, 5.1 g/t Au, 124.9 g/t Ag and 2.0% As. In addition, gold 
and silver recoveries in the zinc concentrate were 4.4% Au and 12.3% Ag.  Heavy liquid 
separation tests were done on each individual sample as a possible method of rejecting waste 
rock and pre-concentrating flotation feed material. These tests indicated that using a heavy 
medium separation process at a specific gravity of 2.96 g/cm3, significantly reduced the 
volume of material to be milled at a relatively low metal loss.  The three-product flotation 
procedure was demonstrated to be a robust and a practical procedure, suitable for use in the 
pre-feasibility study. However, more testing will be required to optimize the procedure to 
reduce the zinc content in the final lead concentrate, the lead grade in the final zinc 
concentrate, and the arsenic content in both the lead and zinc concentrates.  
 
Potential issues to be resolved include the potential for penalties in smelter contracts that may 
materially affect economics or render concentrates unsaleable:  
 

 As levels in zinc concentrates; 
 As and Sb levels in Pb concentrates; 
 Hg levels in zinc concentrates; 
 Zn levels in Pb concentrates. 

 
13.3 FUTURE TESTWORK PROPOSAL  
 
It has been proposed that Huakan should proceed with the testwork to produce two 
concentrates, along with a basic bioleach and a pressure oxidation test on the gold 



 

 55

concentrate. The results of that program will allow two flowsheet arrangements to be considered 
further: 
 
Option A – single saleable concentrate (lead concentrate) flowsheet comprising:  
 

 HMS to reduce the quantity of feed to further processing;  
 Flotation of lead concentrate for sale to smelter; 
 Bulk sulphide flotation concentrate produced as feed to an autoclave; 
 Total pressure oxidation of the bulk sulphide concentrate; 
 Cyanidation of the pressure oxidation residue for gold recovery. 

 
Option B – Two saleable concentrates (lead and zinc concentrates) flowsheet comprising: 
 

 HMS to reduce the quantity of feed to further processing;  
 Flotation of lead concentrate for sale to smelter;  
 Flotation of a zinc concentrate for sale to a smelter; 
 Asenopyrite/pyrite concentrate produced as feed to an autoclave; 
 Total pressure oxidation of the asenopyrite/pyrite concentrate;  
 Cyanidation of the pressure oxidation residue for gold recovery. 

 
The two flowsheets are shown in Figure 13.1 and Figure 13.2, respectively.  It should be 
noted that for the purpose of the economic analysis of the J&L project, only Option A was 
evaluated further.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
14.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The mineral resource estimate presented herein is reported in accordance with NI 43-101 and 
has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral 
reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or 
any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. Confidence in the 
estimate of Inferred mineral resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of 
technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy 
of public disclosure. Mineral resources may be affected by further infill and exploration 
drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent mineral resource estimates 
 
All mineral resource estimation work reported herein was carried out by Fred Brown, M.Sc. 
(Eng), CPG, Pr.Sci.Nat., an independent Qualified Persons in terms of NI43-101, from 
information and data supplied by Huakan. The effective date of this estimate is May 16, 
2011.  
 
Mineral resource modeling and estimation were carried out using the commercially available 
Gemcom GEMS TM and Snowden Supervisor TM software programs.  
 
14.2 DATA SUPPLIED 
 
All sampling data were compiled by Huakan, which supplied a Microsoft AccessTM format 
database containing collar, survey, assay, specific gravity and lithology data, as well as a 
topographic surface and AutoCAD format wireframes of the underground workings. Huakan 
also supplied conceptual wireframe models of the Main Zone, Hanging Wall Zone and 
Footwall zone. All spatial data are relative to NAD 83 - Zone 11. 
 
As implemented by P&E the database contains 537 records, encompassing surface trenches, 
underground chip sampling and drilling (summarized in Table 14.1). Of the 537 records, 29 
records contained no associated assay data, were outside the project limits, or were 
incomplete, and therefore were not used for mineral resource estimation.

14.3 DATABASE VALIDATION 
 
Industry standard validation checks were completed on the supplied databases. P&E typically 
validates a mineral resource database by checking for inconsistencies in naming conventions 
or analytical units, duplicate entries, interval, length or distance values less than or equal to 
zero, blank or zero-value assay results, out-of-sequence intervals, intervals or distances 
greater than the reported drill hole length, inappropriate collar locations, and missing interval 
and coordinate fields. Several minor out-of-sequence errors were detected and corrected. 
P&E believes that the supplied database is suitable for mineral resource estimation. 
 
14.4 SPECIFIC GRAVITY 
 
The supplied database contains a total of 396 specific gravity measurements. Huakan 
selected representative samples of dry halved drill core from within the Main Zone and the 
margins of the Main Zone. Huakan measured the dry weight of the drill core sample, and 
then determined the volume of displaced water from submerged drill core. Specific gravity 
was calculated from the ratio of the dry weight of the drillhole core to the weight of the 
displaced water. The supplied specific gravity measurements were used to estimate block 
density values (Table 14.2). 
 
In addition, P&E collected eighteen bulk density measurements from drillhole core for 
verification purposes, which are in agreement with values reported by Huakan.

14.5 ECONOMIC PARAMETERS 
 
Based on the economic parameters listed in Table 14.3 net smelter return (NSR) value was 
calculated for individual assay values, which were used to construct economic mineralization 
domains, as well as block NSR grades. NSR values were calculated as: 
 

NSR = (Pb% x $17.46) + (Zn% x $13.49) + (Ag g/t x $0.56) + (Au g/t x $34.91) - $18.25

14.6 DOMAIN MODELING 
 
The Main Zone and Footwall Zone mineralization domains have been defined by Huakan 
along the primary structure, based on underground sampling, drilling, geological mapping 
and grade continuity. Based on the supplied interpretations, domain models were generated 
by P&E from successive polylines spaced every ten metres and oriented perpendicular to the 
trend of the mineralization. The outlines of the polylines were determined by the defined 
NSR cut-off of $110.00/t with demonstrated continuity along strike and down dip, and 
include low-grade material where necessary to maintain continuity between sections. All 
polyline vertices were snapped directly to drillhole assay intervals, in order to generate a true 
three-dimensional representation of the extent of the mineralization. Domain wireframes 
were then clipped above the topographic surface. The resulting domains were used for rock 
coding, statistical analysis and compositing limits. See Figure 14.1.

14.7 COMPOSITING 
 
Assay sample lengths for the Main Zone range from 0.03 m to 2.10 m, with an average 
sample length of 0.61 m. The mode of the sample interval length data is 0.50 m, and a 
compositing length of 0.50 m was therefore selected for use for mineral resource estimation. 
 
Length-weighted composites were calculated for within the Main Zone and the Footwall 
Zone domains. The compositing process started at the first point of intersection between the 
drillhole and the domain intersected, and halted upon exit from the domain wireframe. The 
wireframes that represented the interpreted domains were also used to back-tag a rock code 
field into the drillhole workspace. Assays and composites were assigned a domain rock code 
value based on the domain wireframe that the interval midpoint fell within. A nominal gold 
grade of 0.001 g/t was used to populate a small number of un-sampled intervals. Composites 
that were less than 0.25 m in length were discarded so as to not introduce a short sample bias 
into the estimation process. The composite data were then exported to extraction files for 
grade estimation. Only assay values and underground channel samples were extracted for 
mineral resource estimation, and all trench samples were excluded.

14.8 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
 
P&E generated summary statistics for the Main Zone composite data (Table 14.4) and the 
Footwall Zone composite data (Table 14.5). A total of 2,474 composites were generated for 
the Main Zone, and 79 for the Footwall Zone.

The correlation between grade elements was also examined for the Main Zone, indicating a 
high degree of correlation between Ag, Pb and Zn, and a moderate degree of correlation 
between Au and Ag as shown in Table 14.6.

In addition, a comparison was made between underground chip sample values and drillhole 
assay values after compositing. The results indicate no significant bias between the two 
sample populations (Figure 14.2).

14.9 TREATMENT OF EXTREME VALUES 
 
The presence of high-grade outliers for the composite data was evaluated by a combination 
of decile analysis and review of probability plots. Decile analysis results indicate that 
minimal capping is required, with 22% of the mineral content contained in the upper decile 
and 7% in the upper percentile for Ag, 21% of the mineral content contained in the upper 
decile and 9% in the upper percentile for Au, 22% of the mineral content contained in the 
upper decile and 8% in the upper percentile for Pb, and 24% of the mineral content contained 
in the upper decile and 7% in the upper percentile for Zn (Figure 14.3). Minimal capping 
levels were therefore selected. Composite grades were capped to the selected threshold 
values prior to estimation (Table 14.7).

14.10 CONTINUITY ANALYSIS 
 
Domain-coded, composited sample data were used for continuity analysis. Strike orientations 
for the domains were modeled using the known geometry of the mineralization. Dip and dip 
plane orientations were modeled using orientations developed from variogram fans, which 
were assessed for geological reasonableness. Anisotropy was modeled with an average south-
easterly strike and a north-easterly dip.  
 
Based on the analysis of the resulting semi-variograms a strike distance of 60.0 m, a dip 
distance of 60.0 m, and a cross-dip distance of 20.0 m was selected as appropriate for mineral 
resource estimation. Continuity ellipses based on the observed ranges were then generated 
and used as the basis for estimation search ranges, distance calculations and mineral resource 
classification criteria.

14.11 BLOCK MODEL 
 
A rotated block model was established across the property with the block model limits 
selected so as to cover the extent of the mineralized domains and the block size reflecting the 
generally narrow widths of the mineralized zones and the drill hole spacing (Table 14.8). The 
block model consists of separate models for estimated grades, rock code, percent, density and 
classification attributes and a calculated NSR block grade. A percent block model was used 
to accurately represent the volume and tonnage that was contained within the constraining 
grade domains. As a result, the mineral resource boundaries were properly represented by the 
percent model's capacity to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages. The volume of 
the historical underground workings was deemed insignificant and was not depleted from the 
model.

14.12 ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION 
 
Block density values were calculated using a single pass. Anisotropic inverse distance 
squared (ID2) linear weighting of between three and six bulk density values was used for the 
estimation of individual block density values. 
 
Anisotropic inverse distance squared linear weighting of capped composite values was used 
for the estimation of block grades, with the anisotropy defined by the axes of the search 
ellipse. 
 
A three-pass series of expanding search spheres with varying minimum sample requirements 
were used for sample selection, grade estimation and classification. Composite data used 
during grade estimation were restricted to samples located in their respective domains. 
Individual block grades were then used to calculate a NSR block model. 
 
During the first pass, five to six composites from three or more drillholes or underground 
channel samples within a search ellipsoid defined by 50% of the observed continuity ranges 
were required for estimation.  
 
During the second pass, three to six composites from two or more drillholes or underground 
channel samples within a search ellipsoid defined by 100% of the observed continuity ranges 
were required for estimation.  
 



 

 65

During the third pass, three to six composites from one or more drillholes or underground 
channel samples were required. The search ellipse was expanded to insure that all blocks 
within the defined domains were estimated.  
 
Mineral resources were classified in accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: 
 

Measured Mineral Resource: "A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical 
characteristics are so well established, that they can be estimated with confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters 
to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 
deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and 
testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to 
confirm both geological and grade continuity." 
 
Indicated Mineral Resource: "An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical 
characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be 
reasonably assumed." 
 
Inferred Mineral Resource: "An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a mineral 
resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of 
geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and 
sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drillholes." 

 
Huakan supplied detailed summaries of underground chip sampling, and believes that the 
information is of sufficient quality to justify the use of Measured resources (personal 
communication Paul Cowley). Based on the information supplied by Huakan, P&E therefore 
considered that there is sufficient drilling and sampling information, and that this information 
is of a sufficient quality, to support  Measured, Indicated and Inferred classifications for the  
J&L Main Zone deposit. 
 
Resource classification was conducted by generating three-dimensional envelopes around 
those parts of the block model for which the drill hole data and grade estimates met certain 
criteria. The resulting classifications were iteratively refined to be geologically reasonable in 



 

 66

order to prevent the generation of small, discontinuous areas of a higher confidence category 
being separated by a larger area of a lower confidence mineral resources. 
 
Measured mineral resources were defined based on the results of the first pass, and then 
consolidated into a envelope digitized around the central area of blocks estimated during the 
first pass. This process downgraded isolated higher confidence blocks and combined the 
Measured mineral resources into a continuous unit. 
 
Indicated resources were defined based on the results of the second pass, and then 
consolidated into a envelope digitized around the central area of blocks estimated during the 
second pass. This process downgraded isolated higher confidence blocks and combined the 
Indicated mineral resources into a continuous unit. 
 
All remaining blocks estimated were classified as Inferred, including all blocks in the 
Footwall Zone (Figure 14.4).

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 
estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 
(2) Confidence in the estimate of Inferred Mineral Resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful application 
of technical and economic parameters. There is no guarantee that all or any part of a mineral resource can or 
will be converted into a mineral reserve. 
(3) The mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 
and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared 
by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council. 
(4) The following parameters were used to derive the NSR block model values:  

- April 30/11 US$ two year trailing avg. metal prices of Au US$1,183/oz, Ag US$21/oz, Pb 
US$0.99/lb, Zn US$0.95/lb  

- Exchange rate of US$0.95US =  CAD $1.00 
- Process recoveries of Au 92%, Ag 88%, Pb 80%, Zn 72%  
- Smelter payables of Au 96%, Ag 91%, Pb 95%, Zn 85%,  
- Refining charges of Au US$15/oz, Ag US$0.50/oz 
- Concentrate freight charges of C$65/t and Smelter treatment charge of US185/t 
- Mass pull of 5% and 8% concentrate moisture content. 

(5) The NSR cut-off of CAD $110 per tonne was derived from $75/t mining, $25/t processing and $10/t G&A. 
 
14.14 VALIDATION 
 
The block model was validated visually by the inspection of successive section lines in order 
to confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-
grade samples. As a further check on the model the average model block grades were 
compared to the minimum de-clustered mean as well as the mean of the composite data 
(Table 14.10). No significant bias between the block model and the input data was noted.

In addition, local trends were evaluated by comparing the ID2 block estimates to a nearest 
neighbour estimate (NN) at zero cut-off along the strike of the Main Zone (Figure 14.5). In 
general the ID2 block estimates are in good agreement with the NN estimates, and 
demonstrate no evidence of systematic bias in the model.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
No mineral resources on the J&L Property can be classified as mineral reserves at this time.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
16.1 SUMMARY 
 
The potentially mineable portion of the J&L Main Zone mineral resource extends along the 
strike length of the deposit for approximately 1 km, and over 500 m vertically from the 1120 
Level to the 600 Level.  Figure 16.1 depicts the potentially mineable areas in tan.  The 
currently known mineral resources, comprising the J&L Main Zone, are outlined in yellow in 
the figure, while the existing 830 Level development is shown in pink. 
   

Figure 16.1  
View Showing Portion of J&L Main Zone Included in the Mine Plan 

 

 
 
The basis for the mine plan is a block model developed by P&E (Brown et al., 2011).  
Currently, there is an exploration drift on the 830 Level, accessed by the 832 Adit portal.  
There are also several other adits, none of which are anticipated to be used for mine traffic 
during mining operations.  Portions of the mine plan, above and below the 830 Level, are 
referred to as the upper and lower mine, respectively.   
 
Micon has developed a conceptual mine plan using Vulcan software to economically 
optimize resource extraction over the life-of-mine.  The mine design is based on a net smelter 
return (NSR) cut-off value of $110/t.  NSR was included as a variable in the P&E block 
model.  The mine plan involves mechanized, longhole stoping with truck haulage, and 
backfill using cemented process tailings and development waste.   
 
The production schedule was generated by Micon with the aid of iGantt software.  At full 
production, just over 1,500 t/d of process feed will be mined and, during the first six years, 
about 1.24 million tonnes of development waste will be produced.  The upper and lower 



 

 71

mine will be developed simultaneously.  As well as providing access to the resource for 
production purposes, development in the lower mine will establish a location from which 
further exploration drilling can proceed.  Development in the upper mine will focus on 
preparing production headings to offset capital costs, including costs associated with the 
drilling program. 
 
16.2 DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT 
 
Initial waste development involves accessing both the upper and lower mine with ramps from 
the existing workings, as well as from a new portal.  An incline, at a grade of 12%, will 
provide access to the upper mine from the existing 832 Adit, up to the 1120 Level.   
 
The mine plan calls for collaring a new portal during the first year of development.  This 
portal will increase mine productivity, as well as provide secondary egress from the mine.  
The location of the proposed portal is approximately 100 m south of the 832 Portal, and 
makes use of an existing road-cut above the PAG Waste Pile (location marked denoted by 
"X" in Figure 16.2).  In the interest of minimizing ramp development and haulage distance, 
the elevation of the portal is matched as closely as possible to the surface facilities.  Because 
of the steep terrain characteristic of the area, avalanche danger is also a consideration in 
choosing a suitable site for the portal.  An avalanche chute can be seen in Figure 16.2, behind 
the proposed portal location.  From this portal, the decline Ramp 1 will be driven with a 
gradient of -8% to access the lower mine.   
 

Figure 16.2  
Location of the Existing (832) and Proposed (Ramp 1) Portals 

 

 
 



 

 72

The priority for equipment resources dedicated to Ramp 1 is reaching and establishing the 
exploration drilling area at the southeast end of the 700 Level.  Once this priority has been 
met, the ramp will be driven as far as the 660 Level.  Access to the southeast end of the 
sublevels in the lower mine will be established from Ramp 1.  A second decline, Ramp 2, 
will be driven from the existing 832 Drift at a gradient of -12%.  Ramp 2 will access the 
northwest end of the lower mine, terminating at the 600 Level.  Figure 16.3 depicts the 
conceptual layout for lower mine development.  The view is from the south looking toward 
the north.  Existing workings are shown in pink, proposed development in blue, and the 
mineralized zone in brown.   
 

Figure 16.3  
Schematic Showing Conceptual Plan for Waste Development in the Lower Mine 

 

 
 
Access to the mine will be through the two portals:  the existing 832 Adit portal and the 
proposed Ramp 1 Portal.  The 832 Adit portal will initially be used for haulage, as well as 
transport of workers and materials.  However, once breakthrough has occurred in the lower 
mine, connecting the two lower ramps, Ramp 1 will serve as the primary long-term haulage 
route for the lower mine.  For this reason, Ramp 1 is designed with a milder grade.  Ore 
transport from the upper mine will eventually require an ore pass in order to streamline mine 
traffic.    
 
For the purpose of this PEA, all pre-production development, including access ramps and initial 
stope development, has been included as operating development, as shown in the schedule 
presented in Table 16.4, below.  Accordingly, in Year one, a full year of operating development 
is planned, together with approximately six months of sill development and, in the first year, the 
equivalent at steady state of approximately two months of stope production. In subsequent years, 
a steady output at full rate is scheduled. Over the life-of-mine, approximately 22,850 m of waste 
development are planned, including ramps, drifts, and raises. 
 
 



 

 73

16.3 STOPING  
 
Micon has designed the Main Zone stopes using the block model provided by P&E and third-
party stope optimization software, supplied with the Vulcan software package.  A cut-off 
value of $110/t for NSR and block model data (Brown et al., 2011) are input to the 
optimization model.  Stope orientation is constrained by the geologic wireframe provided by 
P&E.  Stope height is confined to 20-m sublevels, with 5-m high sill ore development on 
each level.  Stope width is allowed to follow the width of the vein to a minimum of 2.5 m.  
Dilution is accounted for in the stope optimization process, and varies with the width of the 
vein, ranging between about 10% and 40%.  The portion of the mineral resources included in 
the mine plan, with dilution taken into account, is shown in Table 16.1. 
 

Table 16.1

Inferred 2,759,263 6.20 72.43 2.22 3.24 

 
Longitudinally oriented stopes are planned, with cemented tailings and development waste as 
backfill. Mine sublevels, where drilling, blasting, and mucking will take place, are vertically 
spaced 20 m apart, with main haulage levels at 60-m vertical intervals.  Sublevels are 
conservatively spaced to allow for gravity flow of the ore, given the intermediate dip of the 
mineralization (about 55o, or less).  Stopes are also designed to aid in gravity flow.  On the 
haulage levels, crosscuts will be driven every 40 m along strike to access the muck.   
 
To the extent possible, mining will progress in an overhand fashion with the lower blocks 
being mined first and progressively higher blocks being mined subsequently.  The stoping 
cycle will include longhole drilling, blasting, mucking, and backfilling.  Backfill plant 
construction will commence at the beginning of the first year, most likely on the 830 Level.  
Both development waste and cemented backfill will be used.  Floats from the HMS plant will 
be available for use in backfill.  PAG waste will report directly to the PAG Waste Pile and 
will not be used for backfilling.  Combined sill development and stoping are expected to 
provide approximately 1,500 t/d of mill feed.  Over the life-of-mine, sill development will 
contribute about 1.3 million tonnes and stoping will contribute about 3.6 million tonnes.   
 
Stopes are expected to remain stable between mining and backfilling.  Geomechanical 
evaluation by KCBL in 2007 (Klohn Crippen Berger Limited, 2007)was based on the CSIR 
Classification System: 
 

"The overall combined rating of the rock mass was 65/100, which is Class II rock and 
indicative of 'good rock.'  The average stand-up time, for unsupported rock with a 4 
m span is 6 months and the rock mass has high cohesion (>150 kPa) and a friction 
angle (40-45 degrees), again indicative of good quality rock."

16.4 UNDERGROUND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL 
 
The proposed work schedule for underground operations consists of a day shift and a night 
shift, with 3 crews rotating every four days.  The mine will operate 7 days per week.  
Management and technical staff will work day-shift only, 5 days per week.  Table 16.2 
summarizes the underground personnel requirements.

16.5 EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS 
 
Current surface facilities include an insulated shop that is suitable for initial mine 
development activities (Figure 16.4).  As production increases, an underground shop will 
need to be added to the maintenance facilities.  Surface and underground laydown areas will 
also be needed for storage of consumables and other supplies.  Basic mobile equipment needs 
for underground operations are listed in Table 16.3.

Power demand for the underground mine is expected to be approximately 32,000 MWh/y.  
This includes power supply for the shop, yard, underground operations, pump station and 
compressor.  A surface load centre will feed the shop, office, and other miscellaneous surface 
support facilities.  Underground power supplied at 4,160-V will be distributed through a 
1,000-kVA main mine load centre and several 500-kVA load centres.  These will run the 
underground pump station, sumps, fans and other electrically-powered equipment.     
 
16.6 SCHEDULE 
 
Micon has used iGantt and Vulcan software to create the mine schedule.  Development 
headings are prioritized to meet production goals, and mine production is scheduled such that 
four different areas of the mine can be mined independently.  Higher productivity is realized 
by effectively dividing the mine into four separate production quadrants, opening multiple 
development and production headings simultaneously.   
 
Sill ore production will commence in both the upper and lower mine during the first year.  
The first stopes will be taken in the upper mine during the second year of mining.  As more 
production areas become available, production will increase to about 1,570 t/d by the third 
year.  Production is expected to remain consistent throughout the mine life.   
 
A summary of the annual mine development and production is shown in Table 16.4.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 
17.1 SUMMARY 
 
The process flowsheet options reviewed for this PEA study are shown in Figure 17.1 and 
Figure 17.2, respectively.  Notable features are the HMS which will remove 40% of the rock 
by weight with negligible metal losses of 2%.  The main difference between the two options 
is whether a single saleable concentrate (Pb) or two saleable concentrates (Pb and Zn) are 
produced.   
 
Each option involves a similar set of processing steps including crushing, HMS, grinding, 
flotation, oxidation, and cyanidation.  The main source of assay data for this report is a study 
dated November 2, 2006, prepared for BacTech by PRA.  This study used the closest 
flowsheet arrangement to the recommended program today, and was conducted on samples 
which had been pre-concentrated using heavy liquid separation similar to earlier flotation 
testwork conducted in 1998. The conceptual plant design for the single saleable concentrate 
is based on the results of testwork carried out by PRA on ore types making up a composite 
sample with a head grade of 8.1g/t Au, 72.4 g/t Ag, 3.2% Pb, and 4.8% Zn.  In comparison, 
Micon estimates the life-of-mine (LOM) average feed grades for this PEA as follows:  6.42 
g/t Au, 69.8 g/t Au, 2.2% Pb, and 3.6% Zn.    
 
Unfortunately, only the summary of this referenced PRA report was available through 
Huakan.  Thus, additional process parameters (including suitable HMS density, reagent 
consumption, etc.) have been identified from the earlier October 1998 report prepared by 
H.A. Simons.  The Simons report was based on testwork conducted by PRA under the 
direction of Beattie Consulting Ltd.    
 
Table 17.1 summarizes the milling plant production.

17.2.1 Crushing 
 
The ore is delivered by mine trucks to the plant and fed through a grizzly with 400 mm 
openings to the ROM feed hopper.  The ore is extracted from the feed hopper by an apron 
feeder and fed to a jaw crusher with an opening of 18-20 mm.  The crushed ore is discharged 
onto a conveyor which will transport the ore to the plant. Secondary Crusher product is 80% 
passing 18.3 mm. 
 
17.2.2 Heavy Media Separation 
 
HMS may be used to selectively remove non-sulphide gangue materials by applying an SG 
of 2.95-3.00.  By removing the lower grade material prior to the grinding circuit, the HMS 
plant allows the mill feed tonnage to be increased without having to increase the grinding or 
flotation capacity.   
 
The HMS plant is fed with ROM material from the storage bin by variable-speed drum 
feeders discharging onto conveyors, where the ore is measured by weightometer and tramp 
metal is removed by an electromagnet.   
 
The separators are filled with a bath of ferrosilicon slurry at a specific gravity of 2.9.  The 
low specific gravity waste floats on the bath, while the high specific gravity ore sinks.  
Approximately 40% of the mill feed is removed as float with less than 2% of the contained 
metals being lost.  
 
Float is removed from the separators by paddles and laundered to drainage screens with 
drilled holes for medium recovery.  The recovered medium is circulated back into the 
separator, while the float rock crosses washing screens (with drilled holes), where adhering 
medium is removed using water sprays.  Washed float passes over a weightometer to a 
stockpile outside the plant.  Float can be reclaimed by a loader and dump trucks and used for 
construction, reclamation, or backfill activities. 



 
 

 86

 
Sink is removed from the separators by bucket elevators and fed to single deck screens.  Here 
the medium on the sink drains and is washed off.  The sink is then transferred by conveyor to 
a tripper and into a live bin ahead of the rod mill.   
  
17.2.3 Grinding 
 
The HMS concentrate reporting to the grinding circuit, comprises 60% of the feed to the 
HMS circuit or 900 t/d of coarse sink. The primary grinding rod mill discharge product 
typically has a size passing of 800 µm. 
 
The secondary grinding ball mill will operate in closed circuit with a cyclone, with the target 
cyclone overflow 80% size passing 65 µm. 
  
17.2.4 Lead Flotation  
 
The ball mill ore slurry discharge, at 40% solids, is fed to a conditioning tank, which then 
overflows to the lead rougher flotation cells.  The conditioning tank also acts to buffer 
flotation from upsets in the sink/float and grinding areas.   
 
The lead flotation circuit is a conventional lead-zinc differential flotation circuit.  The initial 
lead flotation tails are cycloned, with the oversize returning to the ball mill and the fines 
reporting as feed to the lead scavenger circuit. 
 
Aero242, Xanthate and cyanide are added to the roughers, cleaners and regrind circuit.  
MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol) is used as a frother, and lime is used as a pH modifier.   
 
The concentrate from the rougher cells is fed to the cleaner cells, from which the final 
concentrate is sent to a pressure filter for dewatering. 
 
17.2.5 Zinc Flotation  
 
Lead rougher tailing, lead-scavenger tails, and zinc spill returns are conditioned with copper 
sulphate and lime in a conditioner.  The overflow is treated with lime to raise the pH, and 
mixed with xanthate, Dowfroth 250 and MIBC, and pumped to the zinc roughers.  The zinc 
rougher tailing is discarded from the circuit as final flotation tails. The final concentrate is 
pumped to the dewatering circuit. 
 
The cleaner-scavenger tails are combined with the zinc rougher tails and pumped to the 
tailings pond.    
 
17.2.6 Dewatering 
 
Lead concentrate is thickened to 80% solids in a 10.6-m diameter thickener.  Lead thickener 
overflow is recycled to the water reclaim tank.  This reclaim water tank can serve as a head 



 
 

 87

tank for the reclaim water pumps and provide the bulk of process water to the mill. It also 
serves as the water supply for the emergency diesel-powered fire pump. 
 
Zinc concentrate is thickened to 70% solids, using an 11.6-m diameter thickener.  Zinc 
thickener water is also returned to the reclaim water tank.  A de-aeration sump is located 
immediately before the zinc thickener to promote breakdown of the froth and improve the 
effectiveness of flocculation and subsequent settling within the thickener. 
 
Concentrates are filtered using pressure filters with an area of 31 m2 for lead concentrate, and 
(for flowsheet option B) 35 m2 for zinc concentrate.   
 
17.2.7 Bulk Sulphide Flotation 
 
For Option A, tails from lead flotation are run through bulk sulphide flotation to recover all 
remaining sulphides, including gold and silver bearing minerals, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, and 
pyrite. 
 
The flotation concentrate is thickened, filtered, and sent to pressure oxidation. 
 
For Option B, the same process is carried out on the zinc flotation tails. 
 
17.2.8 Pressure Oxidation 
 
For Options A and B, total pressure oxidation (PO) of the bulk sulphide concentrate is carried 
out in an autoclave, using oxygen produced in a dedicated plant on site. The resulting 
autoclave discharge slurry is neutralized using limestone.  The PO residue is then filtered, to 
produce a solids feed to cyanidation. 
 
For option A, zinc recovery from the neutralization filtrate is realized either by lime 
neutralization (to precipitate zinc hydroxide), sulphide precipitation, or Zn solvent extraction 
(ZnSX), to recover a saleable Zn product.  
 
This PEA assumes precipitation of zinc hydroxide using lime. Filtrate from Zn recovery is 
neutralized with lime and discharged to tailings or recycled to PO. 
 
For Option B, the same process is used, except that no zinc recovery circuit is needed. 
 
17.2.9 Cyanidation 
 
A six-stage carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit is designed based on a retention time of 6 hours and 
a new carbon concentration of 20 g/L.  Solids from filtration of the PO residue are slurried 
and fed to the train of six CIL tanks in series, where the slurry is leached using sodium 
cyanide in the presence of activated carbon.  Each of the tanks has an in-tank screen to allow 
the slurry to flow by gravity through the CIL train, while retaining the carbon in the tanks.  
The carbon is transported counter-current to the slurry flow by means of carbon advance 



 
 

 88

pumps.  The loaded carbon from the first CIL tank is collected on a screen and is sent to the 
carbon stripping circuit.  The slurry leaving the last CIL tank is passed over a safety screen to 
capture any carbon particles before it is sent to the cyanide destruction circuit. 
 
17.2.10 Carbon Stripping/Carbon Reactivation/Gold Room 
 
A carbon stripping/carbon reactivation circuit treats the loaded carbon to remove gold and 
silver, and to recycle the carbon to the CIL circuit. 
 
The loaded carbon is acid-washed and then fed to a pressurized Zadra circuit to strip gold and 
silver from the carbon.  The pregnant solution is then sent to two electrowinning cells to 
recover the gold and silver.   
 
The carbon from the stripping circuit is fed to a diesel-fired rotary kiln to reactivate the 
carbon which is passed over a sizing screen prior to being recycled to the CIL circuit. 
 
The stainless steel wool, containing the gold from the electrowinning cells, is fed to an 
induction furnace to produce gold doré bars for sale.   
 
17.2.11 Cyanide Destruction 
 
A cyanide destruction circuit is used to treat the slurry discharge from the CIL circuit. 
 
The CIL discharge slurry is pumped to two agitator tanks in series, and SO2 and air are added 
to destroy the cyanide before the slurry is pumped to the tailings disposal area. 
 
17.3 PROCESSING PLANT LAYOUT 
 
The planned location of the mill concentrator is shown in Figure 17.3.  By locating the mill 
above the tailings storage facility, gravity can be used to assist the flow of the tailings slurry.  
Ore will be hauled in trucks from the mine to the crusher feed bin at the mill.  Material is 
then processed through the plant with concentrate load out located on the north side of the 
mill, and tailings gravity fed from the west side of the mill into the proposed tailings storage 
facility.

17.5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The capital and operating costs for the concentrator have been estimated on the basis of 
available data. Additional flowsheet development and pilot studies are required before design 
specifications can be finalized.  
 
In Option A, it has been assumed that a zinc hydroxide precipitate will be produced. 
However, there is also the potential to produce a high grade Zn product by precipitating Zn 
from the leach solution as a sulphide or as a sulphate.  It is recommended that this 
hydrometallurgical option should be explored further in future testwork.   
 
Option B was not evaluated as Micon is doubtful that the quantity of Zn flotation concentrate 
that would be produced at J&L would find a market, considering its arsenic content.   
 
Huakan should investigate further reducing the arsenic content of the lead concentrate, with a 
view to optimizing the trade-off between TC/RC penalties and lead recovery.  
 
Based on Micon's preliminary hydrometallurgical calculations regarding the oxidation circuit 
design, the oxygen plant power requirements are likely to be significant, possibly exceeding 
the power requirements of the rest of the plant and mine site. This will be an important 
consideration in choice of supply and estimation of the infrastructure capital. However, it 
was also noted that the capital and/or operating costs of the oxygen plant may potentially be 
off-set by the production of other gases (for example, argon) as valuable by-products which 
are in high demand elsewhere.  This opportunity should be further investigated during further 
project development. 
 
Bioleach testwork has also been previously proposed. However, this process typically 
requires 7-d retention times, at relatively low pulp density. Given that mountainous terrain at 
the J&L site limits the amount of level area available, it may not be possible to accommodate 
the amount of bioleach tankage needed.  



 
 

 91

 
Micon suggests the plant layout should take advantage of the sloping terrain and use gravity-
assisted process flows where possible. This could include locating the process plant further 
upstream along Carnes Creek and, if possible, above the selected site of the tailings storage 
facility (TSF) to minimize pumping costs.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
18.1 ACCESS 
 
Vehicle access to the area is via Provincial Highway 23, 32 km north of the town of 
Revelstoke, where Highway 23 intercepts the Carnes Creek Forest Service Road. The 
Property is then reached by travelling eastward 13 km along the Carnes Creek Forest Service 
Road before reaching the J&L mine camp.  
 
18.2 POWER SUPPLY 
 
Electric power is currently produced by on-site diesel generators and a satellite phone and 
internet system is in place.  In the PEA, a provision is made for power supply which includes 
an allowance for incoming transmission line and tie-in to Mica Dam or Revelstoke Utilities, 
on-site substation and emergency generators.  The total power demand of the mine and mill 
is approximately 12.8 MW, and requires a substation capacity of approximately 16 MW.  
 
18.3 WATER SUPPLY 
 
Process water will be reclaimed from the tailings area.  Mine water will be recycled and used 
underground for drilling, dust suppression, and maintenance needs.  All mine water will 
report to a main sump underground.   
 
18.4 TAILINGS DISPOSAL 
 
Provision has been made in the PEA for the cost of constructing a tailings dam, based on a 
conceptual design prepared independently for Huakan in respect of one of several potential 
tailings storage sites identified for the project. The conceptual tailings dam consists of a 20 m 
high starter dam, transitioning to centerline construction.  The maximum embankment height 
is 48 m, at an elevation of 833 m.  The embankment is designed to contain a total fill volume 
of 3.3 Mm3, with a final tailings elevation of 832.8 m.    The footprint area is 205,977 m2.   
 
18.5 FUEL STORAGE 
 
A diesel storage tank will be required at the mine yard and, as the mine continues to develop, 
underground diesel storage tanks will be located in the underground shop and other locations 
in the mine as needed.   
 
Heavy fuel oil will be used for the carbon kilns; a storage tank and distribution pumps are 
required. 
 



 
 

 93

18.6 BUILDINGS 
 
Existing buildings will be used for the new mine.  The cafeteria, administration, 
warehouse/maintenance shop were confirmed to be in suitable condition.  A new change 
facility is required and surface facilities will probably be expanded as operations ramp up. 
 
For construction, the local operators will provide accommodation for their workers.  
 
18.7 SEWAGE TREATMENT 
 
The existing sewage treatment was not visited.  It has been assumed that these facilities will 
need to be upgraded to accommodate operations ramp up. 
 
18.8 FIRE PROTECTION 
 
A fire protection system will need to be installed.  Firewater pumps are provided in this 
study.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT  

 
20.1 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND ISSUES 
 
Previous operators in the 1980's and early 1990's collected some environmental data 
including water samples. Merit/Huakan commenced environmental baseline studies for the 
J&L Property in 2007, including meteorology, water quality, waste characterization, 
vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries studies. 
 
20.1.1 Aquatic Resources 
 
The J&L project site is located at the confluence of McKinnon and Carnes Creek. Carnes 
Creek then flows into the east side of Lake Revelstoke on the Columbia River. Lake 
Revelstoke is controlled at the south end by the Revelstoke Dam. 
 
Water quality in Carnes Creek is typical of glacial fed streams (Table 20.1). It is moderately 
hard (average hardness 118 mg/L CaCO3), has average pH of 8.0, average dissolved solids of 
80 mg/L, and average total suspended solids of 35 mg/L with the highest suspended solids 
occurring during glacial melt in July and August. Total iron and aluminium occasionally 
exceed the water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life, but these metals are 
typically associated with streams with high suspended sediment loads. 
 
Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) conducted a fish assessment in the autumn of 2004 at the 
J&L project site to determine species presence, relative abundance, and distribution of fish 
species within Carnes Creek and McKinnon Creek watersheds. In addition, habitat within the 
streams was also assessed. Kokanee and bull trout were confirmed present in McKinnon and 
Carnes creeks. (Golder, 2008). There are no barriers on the creeks; however, both streams are 
glacial fed and have high turbidity and low temperatures which may be limiting factors for 
fish habitat quality (Golder, 2008a).

20.1.2 Terrestrial Resources 
 
The project site is located within the Interior Cedar-Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone (ICH) and 
within the very wet, cool variant subzone (ICHvk1). The area consists of areas of old growth 
western red cedar and western hemlock and areas of young planted spruce and Douglas fir 
with natural regeneration of red cedar, spruce and hemlock. Upper areas of the watershed, 
above 1,500 m, include the Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir (ESSF) biogeoclimatic zone 
and the Alpine Tundra (AT) zone at the peaks (Golder, 2008c). Vegetation surveys were 
completed in 2004 and 2008. Thirteen invasive plant species were noted during the 2008 
vegetation surveys. Rare plants have the potential to occur in the area, but were not observed 
during the 2008 surveys (Golder, 2008c). 
 
Golder conducted wildlife surveys in January, March and June, 2008. Results indicate the 
area is used by red squirrel, mouse, chipmunk, marten, beaver, coyote, moose, white-tailed 
deer, snowshoe hare, bear, pine siskin, pileated woodpecker, sapsucker, black capped 
chickadee, house and purple finch, red-breasted nuthatch, common raven (Golder, 2008b). 
Thirty one species of birds were recorded during the June 2008 breeding bird survey. The 
most common species included the dark-eyed junco, MacGillivray's warbler, winter wren 
and Swainson's thrush. Other species of note included nesting barred owls (Golder, 2008d). 
The western toad was observed during the June survey and is listed as a species of Special 
Concern (Golder, 2008d). Although no sign were found, there is the potential for fisher, 
caribou, and wolverine (Golder, 2008c). 
 
20.2 WASTE AND WATER MANAGEMENT 
 
20.2.1 Waste Characterization 
 
MESH Environmental reported the following: 
 

"No evidence of existing acid generation could be delineated, despite exposure of the 
832 Adit since development in 1991, indicating a substantial buffering potential in the 
deposit host rocks."  
 
"The database suggests that development rock with greater than 0.6% sulphur may 
have uncertain acid generating potential." "Arsenic was identified as a possible metal 
of environmental concern from the 832 Level Adit drainage water quality analyses. It 
was shown through shake flask extractions that noteworthy levels of arsenic were 
solubilized from a limestone sample containing approximately 300 ppm of solid-
phase arsenic. A slightly higher solid-phase As cut-off level of 500 ppm was selected 
because the SFE are not representative of actual drainage and are designed to remove 
any solubility constraints" (MESH Environmental, 2007). 

 
In September, 2008, Merit suspended operations at the J&L Property and kept the site on a 
care and maintenance status with on-site security until early December, 2008. Subsequently, 
mobile equipment was removed. In 2009, the PAG pile of waste rock was covered with 



 
 

 98

overlapping panels of heavy duty non-rip nylon tarping as a temporary measure to minimize 
or eliminate precipitation onto the pile and thereby minimize possible oxidation effects. 
(Huakan 2011). 
 
In October 2011, Huakan constructed a lined pad for PAG waste rock. In the spring of 2012 
the existing PAG waste rock was re-located onto the lined PAG pad. 
 
Huakan (2011) also reported: 
 

"Merit's 2008 development on the 832 drift generated 45,000 t of waste rock 
separated into two waste dumps based on their potential risks for ARD/ML. With the 
aid of an on-site portable low detection limit XRF machine, mining crews were able 
to determine the rock's sulfur and metal content on a round-by-round basis. When 
rounds were over "concern" threshold values, material was sent to a PAG/ML waste 
dump. When rounds were under "concern" threshold values, material was sent to a 
non PAG/ML waste dump. Three on-site kinetic test barrels loaded from the two 
waste dumps were established in September 2008. Two water samples were taken 
from the test buckets in 2010 before the system froze up for the winter. The kinetic 
test work sampling will continue in 2011 to provide in-situ ARD and metal leaching 
information which will ultimately aid in the final reclamation plan of the waste piles."   

 
Sampling of the field barrels continued into 2011 and continued to show elevated sulphate, 
antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc. These results indicate that waste rock 
placement and waste rock runoff and seepage will need to be carefully planned and managed 
during operations and closure to minimize costs and long-term liabilities. 
 
20.2.2 Water Management 
 
Historic water quality samples were collected from the project area by other workers in 1984 
and 1985.  Merit began water quality sampling in December, 2007.  Monthly drainage water 
quality testing of McKinnon and Carnes Creeks was discontinued in August 2008, but 
resumed at seven sites in November, 2010 (Huakan 2011). 
 
Water will be managed during operations to maximize recycle and minimize discharges. 
Nonetheless, there may need to be a discharge. Any discharges will need to meet set permit 
criteria and be of a quality and quantity that will protect the receiving water quality for 
aquatic life. Seepage from the tailings and waste rock disposal areas are potential discharges 
that will require consideration in the water management design, monitoring program and 
management plans. An emergency response, spill contingency plan will be developed to help 
prevent and respond to accidental release of contaminants as is standard practice for mine 
operations. 
 



 
 

 99

20.2.3 Social and Environmental Management 
 
Following good industry practice, it is assumed a social, environmental, health and safety 
management system will be implemented to meet the company's commitments to protect the 
environment and the health and safety of the workers and the surrounding communities. The 
management system and plans will monitor and maintain permit compliance and a social 
licence to operate.  
 
For the purposes of the PEA, it is assumed that an operation of this size will employ one 
Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Manager with additional help coming from 
consultants and contractors as necessary. Annual environmental, social, health and safety 
operating costs are estimated at $500,000 in addition to the full time EHS Manager. 
 
20.3 PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
Micon understands that all exploration permits are in place and maintained in compliance; 
however, a legal opinion has not be obtained to confirm this and Micon offers no opinion on 
this.  
 
The J&L project will exceed the threshold of 75,000 t/y set in the Reviewable Projects 
Regulations; therefore, the project will be subject to a provincial environmental review under 
the BC Environmental Assessment Act. At the production rate of less than 3,000 t/d, the 
project is likely subject to a Screening level assessment under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act which will be harmonized with the BC environmental assessment process.   
 
The time required for the environmental assessment depends on the complexity of the project 
and the requests for additional information.  For the purposes of the PEA, it is assumed that 
permitting will take approximately two years.  Permitting costs are included as indirect costs 
and are applied in the pre-production period.   
 
Mine reclamation costs in British Columbia require financial assurance prior to construction. 
 
In addition to the environmental assessment, the project will require a number of other 
permits which will likely include: 
 

 Mines Act Permit from the B.C. Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Responsible for 
Housing; 
 

 Explosives Magazine Storage and Use Permit from the B.C. Ministry of Energy, 
Mines, and Responsible for Housing; 

 
 Water Licence and possible approvals or authorizations from the B.C. Ministry of 

Environment;  
 



 
 

 100

 Mining Lease from the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource 
Operations; 

 
 Possible Licence to Cut or Free Use Permit from the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands 

and Natural Resource Operations;  
 

 Possible Navigable Waters Protection Act Authorization, Transport Canada for 
bridges. 

 
At this stage, project designs are not expected to affect fish or fish habitat and therefore will 
not require a HADD (habitat alteration, disturbance or destruction) authorization under the 
Fisheries Act, or a Schedule 2 amendment under the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations. 
More time and resources will be needed if this assumption changes. 
 
Similarly, it is currently assumed that the project will not affect critical wildlife habitat or 
protected species; therefore, no special provisions have been made for the Species at Risk 
Act or Migratory Birds Act. 
 
20.4 SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY ASPECTS 
 
The J&L project falls within three Nation territories, the Okanagan, Shuswap and Ktunaxa 
Nations. Table 20.2 presents the Nations and the associated bands that have been determined 
to have potential interest in the project. Consultations have taken place with the First Nations 
during the exploration phases and will continue with the goal of developing an agreement(s), 
as the project plans become more defined and the project moves closer to development.

20.5 MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
 
The object of the final reclamation is to return the disturbed area to as close to the original 
condition as possible. The wildlife species expected to re-inhabit the area are deer, black and 
grizzly bear, moose and a number of bird species that will use the area at various times of the 



 
 

 101

year. The site area is considered prospective for future logging and mineral exploration as 
well as wildlife and occasional recreational use such as hunting. (Huakan, 2011). 
 
"[The] Mine [was] put on care and maintenance in September, 2008; both portals gated and 
locked; explosives destroyed and explosives magazines removed; mining equipment stored 
and secured on site until December, then removed; buildings secured; and underground mine 
electrical utilities pulled out. Road access on Carnes Creek Access Road [was] gated 
(Huakan 2011)." 
 
"During 2009 the PAG pile of waste rock generated in 2008 was covered with overlapping 
panels of heavy duty non-rip nylon tarping as a temporary measure to minimize or eliminate 
precipitation onto the pile and thereby minimize possible oxidation effects. In 2010 the pile 
and tarps were inspected and found to be stable with only minor tarp corner re-anchoring 
(Huakan 2011)."   
 
In fall 2011, Huakan constructed a lined pad for PAG waste rock. In spring 2012, the existing 
PAG waste rock was re-located onto the lined PAG pad. A toe collection pond was excavated 
with seepage from the lined pad draining by PVC pipe to the collection pond. Huakan will 
collect leachate from the toe collection pond on a quarterly basis or more frequently 
depending on accumulations.  Huakan does not expect much water accumulation. The 
samples will be analyzed for water quality and results will be submitted to the Forests, Lands 
and Natural Resources Operations Cranbrook office. If the analyses display acid generation 
or unacceptable metal leaching levels, Huakan will neutralize by adding lime before 
discharging. More preventative action will be taken depending on the severity of water 
quality to protect the receiving environment. Figure 20.1 shows the new lined PAG and non-
PAG waste rock piles. 
 
For the purposes of the PEA, it is estimated that the mine will require the following: 
 

 Dismantling of the plant and ancillary facilities; 
 Securing and closing off underground works; 
 Re-contouring and capping of waste rock dumps; 
 Closure and reclamation of the tailings impoundment; 
 Scarification and revegetation of all other disturbed areas including the access road; 
 Ongoing monitoring of the dam and reclamation. 

 
Preliminary closure costs are estimated to be $6.5 million. This estimate is based on cost 
estimates from similar metal mines and scaled for an estimated 1,500 t/d underground mine 
with approximately 20 ha of disturbance, a 30% contingency and assumes that the waste rock 
and tailings impoundment closure is designed to avoid long-term water treatment. Mine 
reclamation costs in British Columbia require financial assurance prior to construction.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 
21.1 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE 
 
The total estimated project life-of-mine capital expenditure amounts to $299 million 
comprised $264 million pre-production capital and $35 million sustaining capital, including 
closure costs. A summary of the estimated pre-production capital costs is provided in Table 
21.1. All costs are stated in 1st quarter 2012 Canadian dollars. Accuracy is in the range of

Basic Engineering 7,439 - 7,439 
Total Indirect Capital 18,714 - 18,714 

 
In addition to the above, the economic evaluation makes provision for the following charges 
which are applied in the pre-production period: 
 

 $22.3 million for Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) 
fees in respect of the processing and infrastructural aspects of the project; 

 
 $14.9 million owner's costs, to cover the costs of staffing, recruitment, training and 

subsistence during the pre-production period, as well as insurance, permitting and 
environmental monitoring costs. 

 
21.1.5 Contingency 
 
Contingency is a monetary provision in the estimate to cover additional costs that can be 
expected to be identified during the basic engineering and detailed design stages. 
 
An allowance of 25% has been made in pre-production capital costs, excluding owners' costs 
and closure bonding, which amounts to $49.8 million. Micon considers this to be appropriate 
given the preliminary nature of this estimate. 
 
21.1.6 Closure Costs 
 
A provision of $6.5 million has been provided for mine closure and reclamation, within the 
total LOM sustaining capital provision of $35 million. For the purposes of economic 
evaluation, it has been assumed that this amount will be required for bonding, payable during 
the construction period. 
 
Pre-operational testing costs were estimated by approximating the crew size and assigning an 
average labour rate over a typical start-up period based on information from similar projects. 
 
Cost of initial fills is based on the estimated plant inventories including allowances for such 
items as specialty chemicals and reagents.

Process labour costs include 64 people, including crews for maintenance and operation of the 
oxygen plant that supports operation of the autoclave. 
 
Electrical power consumption comprises 20% of total process operating costs, based on an 
average demand of 8.1 MW for the processing facility and associated oxygen plant. The 
latter accounts for more than 75% of the processing power demand. 
 
Process consumables include crushing and grinding media, ferrosilicon for the DMS plant, as 
well as reagents for the flotation, neutralisation, cyanidation, and cyanide destruction circuits. 
 
A provision for maintenance spares is made at the rate of $2.5 million per year, in addition to 
the annual sustaining capital provision discussed above.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
22.1 BASIS OF EVALUATION 
 
Micon has prepared its assessment of the Project on the basis of a discounted cash flow 
model, from which Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback and 
other measures of project viability can be determined. Assessments of NPV are generally 
accepted within the mining industry as representing the economic value of a project after 
allowing for the cost of capital invested. 
 
The objective of the study was to establish the economic viability of the proposed 
development of an underground mining operation and processing for the production of a 
marketable lead concentrate, and gold and silver doré from the J&L deposit. In order to do 
this, the cash flow arising from the base case has been forecast, enabling a computation of the 
NPV to be made. The sensitivity of this NPV to changes in the base case assumptions is then 
examined. 
 
22.2 MACRO-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 
 
22.2.1 Exchange Rate, Inflation and Discounting 
 
The project cash flow model, and all results derived from the model, is expressed in 
Canadian dollars ($). The assumption was made that parity with United States currency 
(US$) will be maintained over the project life. 
 
Constant, Q4-2011 money terms are used throughout, i.e., without provision for inflation. 
The cash flow is discounted to the period in which a decision is taken to proceed with project 
construction, two years prior to first production. 
 
22.2.2 Expected Metal Prices 
 
Figure 22.1 shows the monthly average price of gold and silver over the period 2007 to 2011 
inclusive. During the period Q4-2010 to Q2-2011, silver prices rose briefly to more than 
$40/oz, giving rise to a gold/silver price ratio of as low as 35:1, compared to a longer term 
average of around 60:1. The price of silver has subsequently fallen back in line with this long 
term trend. 
 
The base case has been evaluated using a gold price of $1,320/oz, equating to the three-year 
trailing average price at the end of March, 2012. The silver price of $22.00/oz assumes a 60:1 
ratio of the gold and silver prices is maintained, notwithstanding a spike in the silver price 
during 2011. The study also uses the three-year trailing average prices for zinc and lead, 
being $0.98/lb and $0.94/lb, respectively.  As part of its sensitivity analysis, Micon also 
tested a range of prices 25% above and below the base case values, and over a range of prices 
that include recent values.

22.2.3 Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
 
In order to find the NPV of the cash flows forecast for the project, an appropriate discount 
factor must be applied which represents the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 
imposed on the project by the capital markets. The cash flow projections used for the 
valuation have been prepared on an all-equity basis. This being the case, WACC is equal to 
the market cost of equity, and can be determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model 
(CAPM): 

β E R  R  
 
where E(Ri) is the expected return, or the cost of equity. Rf is the risk-free rate (usually taken 
to be the real rate on long-term government bonds), E(Rm)-Rf is the market premium for 
equity (commonly estimated to be around 5%), and beta (β) is the volatility of the returns for 
the relevant sector of the market compared to the market as a whole. 
 
Figure 22.2 illustrates the real return on CAD long bonds computed by the Bank of Canada, 
taken as a proxy for the risk-free interest rate. Over the past year, this has dropped from 
around 2.0% to 0.5%. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that using a long-term average 
rate will give a more reliable estimate of the cost of equity. Micon has therefore used a value 
of 2.0% for the risk free rate, close to the real rate of return averaged over 10-years. 
 
Although principally a gold mine, the J&L project is expected to drive close to 40% of net 
revenue from sales of base metal concentrates. Taking beta for this sector of the equity 
market to be in the range 1.2 to 2.0, CAPM gives a cost of equity for the J&L project of

22.2.4 Taxation Regime 
 
The J&L project will be subject to Canadian federal income tax and British Columbia 
provincial mining and income taxes. These have been provided for in the cash flow model. 
 
22.2.5 Royalty 
 
Micon understands that the project is free of any royalty attributable to prior owners of the 
mineral title at the J&L Property, and none has been provided for in the cash flow model.  
 
22.2.6 Marketing Costs 
 
Provision has been made for the costs of concentrate transport and the refining of gold and 
silver contained in concentrates produced at the mine, at the rate of $5.00/oz and $0.50/oz 
respectively.

22.3.1 Mine Production Schedule 
 
Figure 22.3 shows the annual schedule for mining of process feed from the underground 
mine.  The grade of process feed varies from 8.6 g/t to 4.9 g/t gold, and averages 6.4 g/t over 
the LOM period.  The silver grade averages 70 g/t Ag, together with 2.2% Pb and 3.6% Zn. 
 

Figure 22.3  
Underground Mining Production Schedule 

 

 
 
22.3.2 Stockpiling 
 
Stockpiling of up to a maximum of 41,400 t of process feed has been taken into account in 
the production schedule. Stockpile tonnage peaks in Year 8 and is drawn down at the end of 
the LOM period in Year 11. 
 
22.3.3 Processing Schedule 
 
The annual tonnage of material processed ramps up from 135,000 t in Year 1 to steady state 
operations of 540,000 t/y processed in Years 2 to 11.  Annual average gold, silver, lead and 
zinc grades of process feed are shown in Figure 22.4.   
 
22.3.4 Product Sales 
 
The production schedule allows for 60 days inventory of lead concentrate, and 15 days for 
gold and silver in doré for material locked-up in the processing circuit, as well as 21 days 
accounts receivable. 
 
The breakdown of LOM revenues by product is shown in Figure 22.5.

22.3.5 Operating Costs 
 
Cash operating costs average $113.27/t treated over the LOM period, including $58.67/t 
mining, $44.30/t processing and $10.30/t for general and administrative costs. Mining costs 
assume an owner-operated fleet, including ancillary equipment, supervision and technical 
support. Stoping costs include a provision for backfill.  Processing costs include labour, 
electrical power, process consumables, maintenance, and concentrate handling. 
 
Figure 22.6 shows the operating expenditures over the LOM period. In the base case, costs 
equate to just 35% of net revenue, leaving an average LOM operating margin of 65%.

22.4 BASE CASE EVALUATION 
 
At the end of Year 1, the project has a cumulative funding requirement of $270 million and 
in Year 1, working capital of $5 million is required prior to first revenue receipts, bringing 
the total funding requirement to $275 million. Thereafter, the project is forecast to be cash 
positive in each year of operation, generating a cumulative net cash flow of $751 million 
before tax, and $484 million after tax. On the undiscounted cash flow, payback occurs after 
4.6 years. On the cash flow discounted at 8%, payback occurs after 5.9 years, and leaves a 
production tail of more than 5 years, based on the current mineral resources.  
 
Figure 22.9 shows the principal LOM project cash flows as a percentage of net revenue: 
 

Figure 22.9  
LOM Project Cash Flows 

 

 
 
Over the LOM period, the average cash operating cost equates to $113/t treated, or $377/oz 
payable gold. Taking into account by-product revenues for silver, lead and zinc totalling 
$434/oz gold reduces the cost of payable gold production to $172/oz. 
 
The base case evaluates to an IRR of 26% before tax and 21% after tax. At the selected 
discount rate of 8%, the net present value (NPV8) of the cash flow is $344 million before tax 
and $202 million after tax. The base case cash flow evaluation results are shown in Table 
22.3. In Micon's opinion, the results demonstrate economic viability of the project base case, 
under the conditions described above. 
 
It should be noted that this PEA is preliminary in nature and it includes inferred mineral 
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that will enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, 
and there is no certainty that the conclusions of the PEA will be realized.

22.5 SENSITIVITY STUDY 
 
22.5.1 Sensitivity to Revenue Factors, Operating and Capital Costs 
 
The sensitivity of the project returns to changes in all revenue factors (including grades, 
recoveries, prices and exchange rate assumptions) together with capital and operating costs 
was tested over a range of 25% above and below base case values.  Figure 22.10 shows the 
results of this analysis.

The results show that the project is most sensitive to revenue factors, with an adverse change 
of 25% reducing NPV8 to $41 million.  The project is less sensitive to operating costs, with 
an adverse change of 25% required to reduce NPV8 to $145 million. Capital costs have the 
least impact on returns, with a 25% increase in cost reducing NPV8 to $133 million. 
 
In further analysis, Micon notes that simultaneously applying an increase of more than 40% 
to both capital and operating costs simultaneously will be required in order to reduce NPV8 
to zero. 
 
Micon concludes that project returns are sufficiently robust to withstand adverse changes in 
the principal value drivers of the project within the limits of accuracy of the estimate. 
 
22.5.2 Gold Price and Discount Rate 
 
The sensitivity of project returns to changes in the gold price was determined, while 
maintaining a 60:1 ratio between the gold and silver price, and holding lead and zinc prices 
constant at base case values. The results are as shown in Table 22.4. Trailing averages are 
calculated as of 31 March, 2012.

All else being equal, economic break-even for the project (i.e., an NPV8 of zero) occurs with 
a gold price of $850/oz and $14.17/oz silver. 
 
22.6 CONCLUSION 
 
Micon concludes that this study demonstrates the economic potential of the project as 
proposed, and that further development is warranted.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The J&L Property is situated in a well mineralized area of British Columbia, surrounded by 
several different types of mineralized showings, all within 10 km of Main Zone portals. 
 
The following information has been obtained from internet sources.  The mineralization 
described is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the J&L Property and the author 
has not independently verified the information. 
 
The Mastodon deposits are located 5 km to the south of the Main Zone. The Mastodon is a 
group of deposits and showings which include the Mastodon (082M 005), Mastodon North 
(082M 195), Lead King (082M 094), Little Slide (082M 006) and Little Slide No. 3 (082M 
196). The area is a series of polymetallic (Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Au, Cu) breccia, replacement-type 
bodies that are tabular (Mastodon - 90 by 60 by 3 m) in Badshot Limestone which may be 
structurally controlled. Teck-Cominco had the property up until 1992. It has many of the 
same characteristics as the J&L Main Zone and could be a parallel mineralized structure. 
Their programs failed to discover sufficient surface indications of mineralization. The entire 
Mastodon group has had several geochemical surveys completed with several lead/zinc 
anomalies having been outlined to-date. Surface drilling of the anomalies, though, has been 
discouraging. 
 
The Copper Queen showing (082M 004) is 7 km to the southwest of the J&L. This 
polymetallic (Cu, Zn, Ag) showing is considered a Kuroko massive sulphide-type deposit 
(G06). Little work has been done on this deposit to define its overall dimensions. 
 
The Locojo showing (082M 264) is 5 km to the east of the Main Zone. It is a new discovery 
that has recently been exposed from under a glacier. Weymin Mining Corporation was the 
original group to stake this showing. The showing is considered a Besshi-type massive 
sulphide (Cu-Zn-Pb) deposit (G04). It has had very little exploration due to its remote 
location.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
This PEA was completed by Micon based on a resource estimate by P&E.  It was prepared to 
analyze the potential economic viability of developing Huakan's J&L Main Zone deposit as 
underground mining operation with an on-site mineral processing facility. 
 
The PEA is based on the proposed mining and processing of the combined measured, 
indicated, and inferred mineral resources as defined in Section 14.  The portion of the 
resources included in the mine plan is based on an NSR cut-off value of $110/t, and is 
presented in Table 25.1.

(1) Numbers are rounded to reflect the precision of a resource estimate. 
(2) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other 
relevant issues. 

(3) The NSR cut-off of $110/t was derived from $75/t mining, $25/t processing and $10/t 
G&A. 

 
The results of the PEA study comprise the following: 
 

 Target nominal mill feed rate of 1,500 tonnes per year; 
 

 Total mill feed of 4.9 million tonnes; 
 

 Life-of-mine waste development of 1.2 million tonnes; 
 

 Life of mine operations just under 10 years, with mill running through Year 11; 
 

 Longhole stoping with backfilling; dense media separation, milling, flotation, 
pressure oxidation and carbon-in-leach processing to produce gold doré, a lead 
concentrate and by-product zinc hydroxide; 

 
 Estimated LOM feed head grades of 6.4 g/t Au, 69.8 g/t Au, 2.2% Pb, and 3.6% Zn; 

 
 Estimated LOM gold recovery of 90.6% to doré and Pb concentrate; 

 
 Estimated LOM silver recovery of 80.4% to doré and Pb concentrate; 

 



 
 

 123

 Estimated LOM lead recovery of 74.2% to Pb concentrate; 
 

 Estimated LOM zinc recovery of 74.5% to Zn hydroxide; 
 

 Estimated LOM payable gold production of approximately 915,000 oz and average 
annual production of approximately 101,000 oz; 

 
 Estimated LOM payable silver production of approximately 8,831,000 oz and average 

annual production of approximately 973,800 oz; 
 

 Estimated LOM lead production of approximately 176,198,000 lb and average annual 
production of approximately 19,431,000 lb; 

 
 The project will employ approximately 200 workers; 

 
 Access to the site will be via the existing Forest Service road, upgraded as required; 

 
 Electrical power will be provided by the local utility supplier; on-site generation will be 

for emergency purposes only; 
 

 Mine closure costs are estimated to be approximately $6.5 million. 
 
The results of the PEA study are summarized in Table 25.2.  All costs are in Canadian 
dollars. It should be noted that this PEA is preliminary in nature and it includes inferred 
mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that will enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, 
and there is no certainty that the conclusions of the PEA will be realized.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Following the completion of this positive PEA study, it is recommended that Huakan 
advance the development of the J&L Property to the pre-feasibility stage and that baseline 
data collection continue in order to support potential permitting. 
 
26.1 BUDGET 
 
Huakan has carried out Phase I of its work on the J&L deposit. It is estimated that to 
complete a pre-feasibility study on the J&L deposit, including drilling, metallurgical testing, 
and engineering design will cost in the range of $24 million, spread over a further  two 
phases.  The next phase, Phase II, of the work program will cost $4.4 million.  A budget for 
Phase II has been compiled by Huakan and is shown in Table 26.1.  Micon believes that the 
estimate is reasonable.

Snow Removal and Routine Road Maintenance 92,000 

Subtotal 1,060,700 
Contingency 400,000 
Total 4,400,000 

 
The Phase II program comprises the following: 
 

 Extend the length of the main track drift 250 m, for a total of 452 m of drift with 
dimensions 2.2 m by 2.5 m; 

 
 Drive seven new drill bays; 

 



 
 

 126

 Drill 40 holes totaling 6,700 m; 
 
The selection of drillhole locations is based on 60 m centres, with the objective of increasing 
mineral resources in the indicated category. 
 
On completion of work in Phase II, a third phase is planned.  Work in Phase III is expected to 
cost $19.6 million.  Although no detailed budget has been completed for Phase III, this cost 
estimate is derived from industry experience with similar scale projects.  Micon believes this 
estimate is reasonable. 
 
Phase III drilling includes: 
 

 Drive Ramp 1 decline approximately 2,180 m; 
 
 Drive five cross cuts totaling 976 m at elevations ranging from approximately 730 m 

to 660 m; 
 

 Drill 47 holes totaling 7,800 m.
