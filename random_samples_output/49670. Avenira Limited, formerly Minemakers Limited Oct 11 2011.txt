SUMMARY 
 

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
In October 2008, Bonaparte Diamond Mines (Namibia) (Pty) Ltd ("Bonaparte"), 
Tungeni Investments cc ("Tungeni") and Union Resources Limited ("Union") 
concluded a joint venture agreement to form the Sandpiper/Meob Phosphate Joint 
Venture to jointly develop their respective marine phosphate tenements located off 
the Namibian coast. The Sandpiper/Meob Phosphate Joint Venture interests 
comprised Bonaparte (42.5%), Union (42.5%) and Tungeni (15%). Bonaparte was a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Bonaparte Diamond Mines NL ("BDMNL"). BDMNL was 
appointed by the JV to manage the marine exploration and resource development 
programme. During 2009, Australian listed company Minemakers Ltd. [Minemakers] 
was successful in its bid to take over BDMNL.  As a result, BDMNL has since been 
delisted and is now a wholly owned proprietary limited subsidiary of Minemakers. The 
interests in the Joint Venture project have also now been transferred into a Namibian 
Registered JV Company , Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Limited which is held as 
follows: Minemakers Limited subsidiary (42.5%), Union Resources subsidiary 
(42.5%) and Tungeni  (15%). 
 

The JV project area comprises a total of 7 Exclusive Exploration Licences (EPL's) 
covering 7000km2 in total. In 2009, work within the Sandpiper JV Project area was 
focused on the three key tenements in the JV area namely EPLs 3414, 3415 and 
3323.  EPL 3415 lies to the south of EPL 3414 for which an updated resource 
estimate was produced in July 2009. EPL 3323 lies to the east of EPL 3414 in the JV 
area.  
 
On 13th July 2011 a 20 year mining license, ML170, was awarded over the whole of 
EPL 3414 and portions of EPL's 3415 and 3323. ML 170 covers an area of 2233km2, 
while the remaining areas of EPL 3415 and 3323 are now 250km2 and 560km2 
respectively. There also remain 4 other EPL's covering 4000km2 in total. The 
locations of resources and their geological context within ML170 are still referred to 
by their original EPL numbers in this update report to prevent confusion and maintain 
continuity with earlier reports. 
 
This report provides an update of the resources of the Sandpiper Project following 
the completion, in March 2011, of a new programme of gravity corer sampling in EPL 
3414 and 3323. This programme of 100 cores (including 10 cores for bulk sampling) 
was concentrated on intermediate lines between existing 4000m spaced sampling 
lines and thus reduced the line spacing to 2000m. No additional drilling has been 
undertaken in the "Indicated Resource Areas" (IRA) or in EPL 3415. 
 
1.2 Scope of Work 
 
This report has been prepared in compliance with the Canadian Securities 
Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 for Minemakers Ltd subsequent to their 
listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in September 2010. 
 
The writer of this report and Qualified Person (QP) was appointed by Minemakers to 
produce an updated independent assessment and classification of the insitu 
resources of EPL 3414 and 3323 using the data available as of March 2011. These 



 vi

estimates update those made in previous reports dated 15th April 2009, 24th June 
2009, 25th July 2009 and 21st March 2011 (see References in Section 16). All of 
these reports were produced by the Qualified Person for the joint venture company 
and partners on instruction from BDML. Reference should thus be made to these 
documents for more detailed information concerning the local geology and the 
sampling techniques employed. In addition, the QP has been asked to provide 
resource estimates for the Inferred Mineral Resources for both licences and for EPL 
3415 using a 10% block cut-off grade (BCOG) to allow comparison with previous 
estimates based on a 15% BCOG and also to produce grade-tonnage data for a 
range of BCOGs for the grab sample data in the area of EPL 3323 remaining after 
removal of resources based on core data. 
 
1.3 Qualified Person 
 
The Qualified person responsible for the content of this report is:- 
 

Dr Alwyn E. Annels FIOM3  C.Eng 
 

He is an independent resource consultant with 44 years' experience in the 
exploration, geological interpretation and resource estimation of mineral deposits. 
More specifically, he has audited and undertaken resource estimation for offshore 
diamond deposits along the Namibian portion of the southern African continental 
shelf since 2000. The phosphate deposits, for which he has undertaken resource 
estimation since 2008, are in very similar geological environments to, and are 
spatially associated with, the alluvial diamond deposits. The latter may occur at the 
base of the phosphatic sediments though the processes of formation differ. 
 
2.0 GEOLOGY 
 
The phosphatic horizon, which overlies a grey-green clay of Miocene age, is 
subdivided into two distinct layers; an upper 0.1 to 1.0 m thick shelly phosphorite 
identified as Holocene in age and demonstrating a downward fining sequence and a 
lower 0.05 to >2.0 m (up to 5.5m in some Gencor vibrocores) thick clayey 
phosphorite identified as Pleistocene in age. 
 
These phosphate deposits are characterized by their spatial continuity (especially in 
a NNE direction) and general uniformity in grade. Thickness variations are generally 
the product of thicker accumulation of sediment in palaeotopographic depressions in 
the underlying clay surface. The phosphate is thought to be the product of 
synsedimentary chemical precipitation and early diagenetic concretionary growth 
within the unconsolidated sediment. 
 
Grades for individual samples rarely exceed 23% P2O5 and the majority lie between 
17 and 21% P2O5. Average layer grades are typically 19 - 20% P2O5 for the lower 
layer (1) and 18 -19% for the upper layer (2). Overall deposit grades decrease both 
laterally and vertically reflecting the pinchoutout of Layer 2 to the east and to the west 
so that Layer 1 then sits directly on the underlying clay. In addition, decreases in 
grade may also be due to the local increase in clay infiltration or deposition or to the 
winnowing action of bottom currents near the water-sediment interface. 
 
3.0 SAMPLING  
 
Details of the sampling method using a gravity corer and all the associated 
procedures are to be found in the April 2009 report but a brief summary is presented 
below. 



 vii

 
In 2010 and 2011 three generations of a new gravity corer were built and utilised. 
These newer gravity corers weighed between 350 and 700kg and could be fitted with 
steel pipe sections that ranged from 3m to 4.5m long and contained 75mm or 90mm 
diameter plastic sample barrels in which the core could be recovered. The gravity 
corer is lowered towards the sea bed on the main winch cable until 5m above the sea 
bed it takes a controlled drop on a built in 13mm wire spool to impale the sediments 
before being pulled out again and recovered to the vessel.  Although good core 
recovery was obtained in most areas there were areas where the corer failed to 
penetrate the phosphorite horizon due to the presence of dense shell concentrations. 
 
The 2010/11 programme of sampling was completed in March 2011 when 100 
sample sites had been occupied on a regional infill sample grid in EPL 3414 and the 
western portion of EPL 3323. This sampling area also incorporates the Initial Target 
Mining Area (ITMA) which lies in water depths of <225m. This programme was aimed 
at demonstrating the continuity of the mineralization in the ITMA over an area of 
approximately 25 x 8 km and to identify areas of consistent thickness and 
mineralization grading above 20% P2O5 in the upper levels of the deposit. In addition, 
it was undertaken to define an area for detailed follow-up sampling to further upgrade 
current Inferred Mineral Resources to the higher category of Indicated Mineral 
Resource to support a 25 year mine development plan for the Definitive Feasibility 
Study (DFS). 
 
The 100 sample sites included 10 closely spaced sites from which cores were 
obtained to create a bulk sample for preliminary processing studies. Sampling was 
concentrated on intermediate lines between existing 4000m spaced sampling lines 
and thus reduced the line spacing to 2000m. The sample spacing on these lines was 
1600m though locally, in the east, it was reduced to 800m. 
 
The use of the upgraded gravity corer system allowed greater penetration depths 
than in the initial phase of sampling in 2008/9 with an average penetration depth of 
1.65m (previously 1.22m) and a maximum penetration depth of just over 3m in water 
depths of between 180 and 300m.  
 
No additional sampling has been undertaken in the two "Indicated Resource Areas" 
(IRAs) or in EPL 3415. 
 
4.0 RESULTS OF CURRENT SAMPLING 
 
Compilation of available data for all three JV licence areas shows that there are two 
distinct parallel zones of thicker phosphatic material. The best developed passes 
through EPL 3414 into the north of EPL 3415, however, water depths are increasing 
to excess of 300m at this southwestern extremity. Within this zone, which is up to 9 
km wide, phosphatic sediments exceed 100 cm in thickness. The full thickness of 
phosphate is not known as holes have generally penetrated to depths of less than 
200cm and only 40% reached the underlying grey-green clay. There is thus a 
considerable upside potential in terms of tonnage. 
 
The second zone, to the east, passes through the southwest part of EPL 3323 
(where it is weakly developed) into EPL 3415 where it is much better developed in an 
area with water depths of 200 to 300m. 
 



 viii

5.0 RESOURCE ESTIMATION 
 
Inferred Mineral Resources have been calculated for EPL3414 and 3323 combined 
using combined assay and thickness data for Layers 1 and 2.  
 
2D Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) methods were used to interpolate thicknesses, 
metal accumulations and grades into 1000 x 1000m blocks in both areas. 
Extrapolation has been constrained by boundary files representing the perimeter of 
the resource under evaluation and 2D search areas were used whose dimensions 
were controlled by examination of the distribution and trends of data and by the 
results of current and previous geostatistical studies. 
 
In the case of Inferred Resources, volumes have been converted into wet tonnages  
using a conservative estimate of 1.68 tonnes / m3. The dry tonnage was then 
estimated using a factor of 0.75 based on the average of all measurements available 
at the time of writing. 
 
No additional sampling has been undertaken at a density necessary to support 
Indicated Mineral Resources hence these resources remain unchanged since the 
March 2011 report. 
 
6.0 QA/QC PROCEDURES AND RESULTS 
 
The quality of sampling and analysis continues to be monitor using the now well 
established QA/QC protocol which includes the following. 
 

a) Close spaced drilling to test the reproducibility of sample data at a specific 
location. 

b) Duplicate sampling and analysis of core to determine the combined sampling 
and analytical precision. 

c) Repeat analysis of samples in the laboratory to determine the analytical 
precision. This procedure is undertaken by the laboratory. 

d) Repeat analysis of 'blind' samples previously analysed by the laboratory but 
resubmitted under new numbers. 

e) Analysis of commercially available accredited standards with each batch of 
routine samples to determine analytical accuracy. 

f) Analysis of blanks to monitor potential contamination in the sample 
preparation process. 

 
No referee samples were submitted to an internationally accredited assay laboratory 
during this particular programme but a batch will be selected and sent during a future 
programme. 
 
In all cases, the results were found to be very satisfactory and there is no evidence of 
any systematic bias. Intra-laboratory comparisons all indicated repeatability of results 
to a precision of better than 5%. 
 
7.0 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
Though the density of regional sampling in most of EPL 3414 and 3323 is too low to 
allow anything but an Inferred status to be applied, within the 10 km2 areas of 
detailed sampling in each of the EPLs, the density of sampling (400 x 400m) is more 
than adequate to allow the assignment of an Indicated Mineral Resource 
classification. Variographic studies are now available which indicate that 
geostatistical ranges for thickness, metal accumulation and grade are generally in 



 ix

excess of 450m and as high as 1250m in the case of EPL 3323, for some directional 
variograms. The boundary between Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources in 
terms of sample spacing is set at the point at which no serial correlation (Covariance) 
exists between samples. This spacing is represented by the geostatistical range. The 
level of geological understanding and knowledge of this area of the Namibian 
continental shelf is also more than adequate to support the reporting of Mineral 
Resources meeting International Codes as are the results of QA/QC procedures. 
 
The gravity core sampling has clearly defined the existence of a significant 
phosphate deposit in terms of areal extent and thickness, at grades which are 
potentially economic.  
 
8.0 STATEMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES 
 
8.1 Current Resource Statements for EPL 3415 and 3323 
 
Based on the information presented above, all the Mineral Resources estimated for 
the gravity cored areas of EPL 3414, 3415 and 3323 are considered to be fully NI 43-
101 compliant. Estimates are rounded to reflect the level of confidence in these 
resources at the present time. 
 
The updated Mineral Resources listed in Table 8.1 are based on a flexibly applied 
10% block cut-off grade and on a minimum thickness of 25cm. Average wet tonnage 
factors of 1.68 tonnes per cubic metre are applied to Inferred Mineral Resources 
which are converted to dry tonnages using a factor of 0.75. In the case of Indicated 
Mineral Resources (see Table 8.2), Layer 1 and 2 tonnages are produced using new 
SGs of 1.75 and 1.69 tonnes per m3 respectively and new dry tonnages conversion 
factors of 0.80 and 0.71 respectively.

All of the resources estimated in this report are in tenements owned by Namibian 
Marine Phosphates (Pty) Ltd ("NMP") and that company advises that all of the 
tenements are currently in good standing. 
 
A Definitive Feasibility Study on the economics of development of the phosphate 
resources is being carried out for NMP by independent and appropriately qualified 
local and international consultants. NMP advises that, at this time, is not aware of 
any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or 
other factors which are likely to cause a material effect on the mineral resource 
estimates herein. 
 
9.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

1) Compilation of available data for all three licence areas shows that there are 
two distinct parallel zones of thicker phosphatic material. The best developed 
passes through EPL 3414 into the north of EPL 3415, however, water depth 
is increasing to excess of 300m at this south-western extremity. The second 
zone, to the east, passes through the south west part of EPL 3323 (where it is 
weakly developed) into EPL 3415 where it is much better developed in an 
area with water depths of 200 to 300m. 

 
2) The modifications undertaken to the gravity corer since the March 2011 report 

have improved sample recovery in EPLs 3414 and 3323 and also achieved a 
significant improvement in depth penetration. However, this is still not 
sufficient to obtain complete intersection of the phosphate horizon down to 
the footwall clays. 

 
3) The completion of infill lines, reducing the line spacing to 2000m, has 

confirmed the continuity of mineralization and P2O5 grade. 
 

4) Coverage of EPL 3415 is still incomplete as no additional sampling has been 
undertaken in this licence area, priority being given to 3414 and 3323 due to 
their shallower water depth. Though three separate areas exist from the point 
of view of sampling, two of these have been merged as a result of 
extrapolation by the software. As a consequence, assessment of the full 
extent of the potential mineralization remains incomplete. 

 
5) Sampling, core logging and petrographic analyses appear to have been 

undertaken with great care though these procedures have not been directly 
witnessed by the Qualified Person.  

 
6) Close spaced drilling continues to confirm that sample grades revealed by the 

gravity corer are representative of the area in which they lie. Thicknesses 
obtained from complete intersections reveal some variability over distances of 
10s of metres reflecting variable compaction rates and local changes in the 
floor of the depression in which the phosphate has accumulated. 

 
7) Inter-laboratory analytical comparisons have not been made during the 

current programme but previous studies did indicate that there is no 
systematic bias in the results from the routine laboratory though comparisons 
give repeatability precisions no better than 10%. 

 
8) Improvements in analytical precision are evident compared with previous 

studies of QA/QC results and are now considered very satisfactory. 



 xi

 
9) QA/QC procedures have been followed and the results have been examined 

by the Qualified Person and have been found to be compatible with the level 
of confidence expected for NI 43 -101 compatible Mineral Resources. 

 
10) The deletion of some of the previous data from the resource database is 

justified as it would have affected the quality of the resource model by 
introducing line anomalies where poor penetration depths were achieved. 

 
11) The 2010/11 sampling programme was aimed at completing the coverage of 

EPLs 3414 and 3323 at a sampling density sufficient for the determination of 
an Inferred Mineral Resource. This work has allowed the definition of priority 
target areas for the next phase of closer spaced sampling (currently in 
progress) aimed at the production of Indicated Mineral Resources for the 
Definitive Feasibility Study. 

 
12) The increase in Inferred Mineral Resource reported in this study largely 

reflects the deeper penetration of the modified gravity corer and the slightly 
extended coverage. Despite the removal of some of the previous data from 
the database, there has been no significant change in grade and there is 
every indication that grade variations are gradual and predictable. 

 
13) The reduction in the Block Cut-off Grade from 15% to 10% has only slightly 

increased the tonnages available with a concomitant small reduction in grade. 
 

14) The resource estimates presented are considered to be conservative in terms 
of tonnage as phosphate is known to continue below those intersections 
which failed to reach the underlying grey-green clay. 

 
15) Preliminary mineral processing tests and studies undertaken in 2001 and 

2004 suggest that there is the potential for economic upgrading of Run of 
Mine material to a saleable product. This has also been support by October 
2010 scoping study results. This is accepted by the QP as further support for 
the definition of Mineral Resources within the Sandpiper Project Area.

1) Attempts should continue to be made to improve depth penetration in Layer 2 

in all three EPLs possibly through the introduction of a vibracorer. 
 

2) Coverage of EPL 3415 at a 4000m line spacing needs to be completed with 
localized infill lines where warranted. 

 
3) Once the drilling for Indicated Mineral Resources is complete, further 

investigation of the eastern margin of the main 3141/3323 phosphate zone 
should be undertaken to resolve some of the problems relating to the thick 
low grade Layer 2 sediments that were intersected in previous sampling work 
and also whether the second lower phosphate rich layer intersected in two 
holes in this area during the recent programme have any spatial continuity 
and should thus be included in future resource estimates. 

 
4) As a large portion of the central and eastern areas of EPL 3323 has only 

been subject to grab sampling, it is recommended that some reconnaissance 



 xii

lines be sampled, using the gravity corer, over areas with elevated grades to 
determine whether they have any economic potential in terms of grade and 
thickness.

UPDATED ESTIMATION OF PHOSPHATE RESOURCES FOR 
THE SANDPIPER PROJECT IN ML170, NAMIBIA 

(A NI 43-101 Compliant Technical Report) 
 

For  
Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd 

 
 
 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
In October 2008, Bonaparte Diamond Mines (Namibia) (Pty) Ltd ("Bonaparte"), 
Tungeni Investments cc ("Tungeni") and Union Resources Limited ("Union") 
concluded a joint venture agreement to form the Sandpiper Phosphate Joint Venture 
to jointly develop their respective marine phosphate tenements located off the 
Namibian coast. The Sandpiper Phosphate Joint Venture interests comprised 
Bonaparte (42.5%), Union (42.5%) and Tungeni (15%). Bonaparte was a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Bonaparte Diamond Mines NL ("BDMNL"). BDMNL was 
appointed by the JV to manage the marine exploration and resource development 
programme. During 2009, Australian listed company Minemakers Ltd. [Minemakers] 
was successful in its bid to take over BDMNL.  As a result, BDMNL has since been 
delisted and is now a wholly owned proprietary limited subsidiary of Minemakers. The 
interests in the Joint Venture project have also now been transferred into a Namibian 
Registered JV Company , Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Limited (NMP) which is 
held as follows: Minemakers Limited subsidiary (42.5%), Union Resources subsidiary 
(42.5%) and Tungeni  (15%). 
 
The JV project area comprises a total of 7 Exclusive Exploration Licences (EPL's) 
covering 7000km2 in total. In 2009, work within the Sandpiper JV Project area was 
focused on the three key tenements in the JV area namely EPLs 3414, 3415 and 
3323.  EPL 3415 lies to the south of EPL 3414 for which an updated resource 
estimate was produced in July 2009. EPL 3323 lies to the east of EPL 3414 in the JV 
area. 
 
On 13th July 2011 a 20 year mining license, ML170, was awarded over the whole of 
EPL 3414 and portions of EPL's 3415 and 3323. ML 170 covers an area of 2233km2, 
while the remaining areas of EPL 3415 and 3323 are now 250km2 and 560km2 
respectively. There also remain 4 other EPL's covering 4000km2 in total. The 
locations of resources and their geological context within ML170 are still referred to 
by their original EPL numbers in this update report to prevent confusion and maintain 
continuity with earlier reports. 
 
This report provides an update of the resources of the Sandpiper Project following 
the completion, in March 2011, of a new programme of gravity corer sampling in EPL 
3414 and 3323. This programme of 100 cores (including 10 cores for bulk sampling) 
was concentrated on intermediate lines between existing 4000m spaced sampling 
lines and thus reduced the line spacing to 2000m. No additional drilling has been 
undertaken in the "Indicated Resource Areas" (IRA) or in EPL 3415.

1.2 Scope of Work and Qualified Person 
 
This report has been prepared in compliance with the Canadian Securities 
Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 for NMP subsequent to their listing on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange in September 2010. 
 
The writer of this report and Qualified Person (QP) was appointed by Minemakers to 
produce an updated independent assessment and classification of the in-situ 
resources of EPL 3414 and 3323 using the data available as of March 2011. These 
estimates update those made in previous reports dated 15th April 2009, 24th June 
2009, 25th July 2009 and 21st March 2011 (see References in Section 16). All of 
these reports were produced by the Qualified Person for the joint venture company 
and partners on instruction from BDML. Reference should thus be made to these 
documents for more detailed information concerning the local geology and the 
sampling techniques employed. In addition, the QP has been asked to provide 
resource estimates for the Inferred Mineral Resources for both licences and for EPL 
3415 using a 10% block cut-off grade (BCOG) to allow comparison with previous 
estimates based on a 15% BCOG and also to produce grade-tonnage data for a 
range of BCOGs for the grab sample data in the area of EPL 3323 remaining after 
removal of resources based on core data. 
 
The Qualified Person responsible for the content of this report is:- 
 

Dr Alwyn E. Annels FIOM3, C.Eng 
 

Dr A. E. Annels is a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Institute of Materials, 
Minerals and Mining (IOM3). He is an independent resource consultant with 44 years 
experience in the exploration, geological interprtetation and resource estimation of 
mineral deposits. More speciifically, he has audited and undertaken resource 
estimation for offshore diamond deposits along the Namibian portion of the southern 
African continential shelf since 2000. The phosphate deposits, for which he has 
undertaken resource estimation since 2008, are in very similar geological 
environments to, and are spatially associated with, the alluvial diamond deposits. The 
latter may occur at the base of the phosphatic sediments though the processes of 
formation differ. 
 
1.3 Sources of Information and Databases 
 
All data used for the production of this report has been provided by Minemakers in 
the form of Excel spreadsheets. 
 
1.4 Disclaimer 
 
Dr Annels has not directly observed sample collection on board ship or the 
preparation and analysis (petrographic and chemical) of these samples relying 
heavily on Dr Morrison (see below). No visit to sample storage and preparation 
facilities in Namibia has been undertaken by the Qualified Person and thus he has 
not directly examined grab and core samples. Dr Annels has thus taken the sampling 
data provided at face value having full confidence in the work undertaken by 
Minemakers and Bonaparte prior to the acquisition of the JV licences by Minemakers 
and also in its QA/QC procedures. The author bases this confidence on having been 
consulted by the Bonaparte/Minemakers team regularly throughout the resource 
sampling operation in relation to sampling grid layout and detailed sample handing 
and QC/QA procedures.

2.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
Details of the local geology and sampling methodologies applied have been supplied 
to Dr Annels by Dr C. Morrison who has 21 years experience in exploration and 
sampling in the submarine environment. He had full responsibility for the supervision 
of sample collection and also undertook the sampling of phosphatic material for 
analysis. He also compiled and validated the databases on which the resource 
estimates are based and has supervised QA/QC procedures specified by Dr Annels 
both in the sample collection facility and in the analytical laboratory. The Qualified 
Person has, however, undertaken his own checks on the database and has 
undertaken statistical studies of the QA/QC data. 
 
3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
Through the Joint Venture Company, Minemakers have an interest in granted tenure 
over 7 phosphate licences totalling 7000 km2. These Exclusive Prospecting Licences 
(EPLs) were issued by the Namibian Ministry of Mines and Energy for periods of 
three years, renewable for periods of two years, and lie off the coast of Namibia 
between Walvis Bay and Luderitz (see Figure 4.1). The EPL's were all transferred 
from the original JV partners into the JV company effective 4 October 2010. On 13th 
July 2011 a 20 year mining licence, ML170, was awarded over the whole of EPL 
3414 and portions of EPL's 3415 and 3323. ML 170 covers an area of 2233km2, 
while the remaining areas of EPL 3415 and 3323 are now 250km2 and 560km2 
respectively. 
 
Areas and renewal dates for these licences are listed in Table 3.1 below.

Exclusive prospecting licences are granted on payment of an annual fee of N$10,000 
and on the submission of proposed expenditure programmes for each EPL and for 
each year of the licence period. Monthly financial statements are then submitted 
which are then combined at the end of the licence period in support of applications 
for licence renewal. In addition, environmental impact assessments and 
environmental management plans have to be submitted and approved by the 
Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism. The terms of the licence also require 
6 monthly environmental impact reports.  
 
The mining licence is subject to an annual fee of N$5,000. A monthly report is 
submitted which reflect monthly production, stock and reserve figures as well monthly 
employee demographic and salary information. In addition, environmental impact 
assessments and environmental management plans have to be submitted within 6 
month of issuance of the license and an environmental contract entered into with the 
Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) and the Ministry of Mines and 
Energy (MME) before mining can commence. Mining must commence in terms of the 
proposed work programme and budget submitted with the original mining license 



 4

application although variations can be made on approval by the MME. The terms of 
the environmental contract will probably require annual environmental impact reports. 
 
Exploration work carried out todate had had no significant environmental impact. 
Environmental Baseline studies have been completed involving physical (grab) 
sampling of the seabed for the characterization of fauna and sediment type 
concentrating on areas targetted for initial mining operations. 
 
The licences lie within a regional phosphate province located on the continental shelf 
off Namibia at water depths of between 130 and 400m. In these areas, the sea floor 
is sediment covered and the main phosphatic horizon extends downward to depths of 
in excess of 6m with thicker zones trending parallel to the coast in a NNE direction. 
Exploration activity is largely concentrated in 3 licence areas, ML170, EPL 3323, and 
3415 (see Figure 3.1), which together constitute the Sandpiper Phosphate Project. 
 
Preliminary mining studies, involving ship-borne dredging, have indicated that current 
dredging systems (grabs, flexible fall pipe) are capable of operating in water depths 
of up to 700m. Moreover, existing trailing suction arm dredges are capable of 
operating to 225m with minor adjustment but, with development of more specialized 
systems, could attain 250m. EPL 3323 lies at water depths of 130 – 170m while 
ML170, immediately to the east, lies at water depths of 150m to in excess of 300m. 
EPL 3415 which is now immediately to the southwest and contiguous with ML170 
(see Figure 3.2), lies at a water depth over 300m. The combined total area is 
approximately 3000,000 ha with a strike length of 110 km.

4.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
4.1 Topography, elevation and vegetation 
 
All the properties are marine properties, as such they cover flat areas of the sea floor 
and have no terrestrial type vegetation. 
 
The neighbouring coastline of Namibia has an arid flat (peneplain) coastal belt 
approximately 50km wide and rising from sea level to 300m over the 50km from west 
to east. Vegetation is limited to scatter bushes in dune free or stable dune areas and 
acacia trees along seasonal river courses. Dune fields cover the coastal plain 
adjacent to the properties but they terminate when intersected by a seasonal river 
course (the Kuiseb River) that flows to the Walvis Bay area which lies to the NE of 
the properties. 
 
4.2 The means of access to the property 
 
The properties can be accessed by boat from the nearest ports of Walvis Bay or 
Luderitz. 
 
4.3 The proximity of the property to a population centre, and the nature of 

transport 
 
The properties lie in a zone between 60km and 100km off the coastline and 
extending from Walvis Bay for 350km southwards to the vicinity of Oyster Cliffs, 
which lies 80km to the North of Luderitz. (see Figure 4.1). Transport is by boat.

4.4 The climate and the length of the operating season 
 
The Namibian coastal district has an unusually cool dry and windy climate, which is 
caused by the cold Benguela current, which flows northwards. The cold ocean water 
maintains low temperatures with very small differences from month to month. The 
average temperature is 16.8°C with a range of 6°C. The coast is characterized by 
frequent fog (usually burning back during the heat of the day) and a very low annual 
rainfall (average 20mm but ranging from 0 to 100mm per annum). The driest weather 



 9

is in January, October, November and December while the wettest weather is in 
March when an average of 8 mm of rainfall occurs across 2 days.  
 
Exploration operations (and eventually mining operations) are constrained by 
weather and sea conditions. 
 
Wind and wave directions are dominantly from the south to southwest. The weather 
tends to cycle in a 3 to 6 day pattern due to frontal systems passing to the south of 
Southern Africa. These cycles are associated with persistent strong southerly winds 
that periodically drop and swing to a north-westerly or easterly direction. The 
southerly winds are persistently strong with prolonged periods during which wind 
speeds range from 15 to 30 knots. Wind speeds gusting to 50 knots are a more or 
less monthly occurrence. 
  
The average significant wave height for the entire year is below 2m for 28% of the 
year, 2.6m for 54% of the year and below 3m for 72% of the year. Marine operations 
are most likely to be affected during the period August to November.  
 
The dredge vessel would be able to operate in spring (Sept-Nov) and autumn 
(March-May) when sea conditions are more favourable. However, marine diamond 
mining vessels are designed to operate throughout the year on a 24/7 basis. 
 
4.5 Infrastructure 
 
The resource areas are located approximately 120 km to the south east of Walvis 
Bay, Namibia's major port.  Within the Walvis Bay area, there is significant 
infrastructure and resources available to support the project development, including 
rail, road, freshwater, engineering facilities, major port services as well as human 
resources.  The emergence of the uranium industry in the region is also driving 
significant new investment into infrastructure and services in the area.  In due course 
it is likely that a sulphuric acid plant, and/or significant upgrades to sulphuric acid 
handling infrastructure will be developed to support the uranium industry, further 
enhancing the prospects for on-shore treatment of phosphate rock to phosphoric 
acid. 
 
Mining (recovery of ore) will be undertaken at sea using a large dredging vessel. As 
such, all mining recovery infrastructure will be contained on the dredge vessel.  
 
Electrical power is available in Walvis Bay through the national grid which is operated 
by Nampower. Nampower can supply power at various voltages depending on where 
it is taken from the grid (e.g. 3kV, 7kV or 11kV).  
 
Approval has been granted in principle by Walvis Bay municipality for access to 
excess sweet water derived from the sewage treatment works. For all other 
processing purposes saltwater is accessible and can be used. 
 
Namibia has a well developed and regulated land and marine mining industry from 
which mining personnel can be sourced and this resource can be supplemented from 
the South African mining industry as required. 
 
There are light and heavy industrial sites designated for development in Walvis Bay, 
close to the port of Walvis Bay. Port-storage and bulk loading facilities are available 
in Walvis Bay. The port currently handles approximately 1.5 million tonnes of bulk 
commodity exports per annum. The port can currently take vessels with lengths of up 
to 300m and maximum drafts of 12.8m at the container quay. The current bulk 



 10

terminal quay has a draft of 10.6m and can accept bulk shipping vessels up to 
32,000 GRT in size. If needed, bulk vessels can be diverted to the deeper draft 
container quay. The port has 6 cranes (mobile) rated to capacities of 80 – 140 
tonnes. Plans for port expansion have also been approved and are in progress. 
Maximum draft is expected to be increased to 13.5m. 
 
Rail and road infrastructure is well established in the Port and surrounding area.  The 
rail link passes through the designated heavy industry area located near the Walvis 
Bay Airport located approximately 8km out of town and terminates in the port. 
 
5.0 5.0 HISTORY 
 
5.1 Prior ownership of the property and ownership changes 
 
EPL 3323 was granted to Bonaparte Diamond Mines Namibia (Pty) Ltd in 2005 for an 
itial period of 3 years and was transferred to Bonaparte Tungeni Joint Venture 
Exploration (Pty) Ltd. on the 7th September 2006, which was re-named Minemakers 
Tungeni Joint Venture Exploration (Pty) Ltd., before being transferred to Namibian 
Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd. on the 4th October 2010. 
 
EPL 3414 was granted to Sea Phosphates Namibia (Pty) Ltd. on the 25th April 2006 
before being transferred to Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd. on the 4th October 
2010. 
 
EPL 3415 was granted to Sea Phosphates Namibia (Pty) Ltd. on the 25th April 2006 
before being transferred to Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd. on the 4th October 
2010. 
 
ML170 was awarded to Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd. on 13th July 2011 and 
incorporates the whole of EPL 3414 and parts of EPL's 3415 and 3323. 
 
EPL's 4009, 4010, 4021 and 4059 are new issued license areas which were issued 
in the name of Bonaparte Tungeni Joint Venture Exploration (Pty) Ltd., which was re-
named Minemakers Tungeni Joint Venture Exploration (Pty) Ltd., before being 
transferred to Namibian Marine Phosphate (Pty) Ltd. on the 4th October 2010. 
 
5.2 The type, amount, quantity and general results of exploration and 

development work undertaken by previous owners or operators 
 
This is covered by Section 9 (Previous Exploration) of this TSX resource report. 
 
5.3 Historical mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates  
 
There are no historical mineral resource estimates for the properties. In 1994 Gencor 
produced a feasibility study based on 3 billion tonnes, but this was not compliant with 
international reporting codes for stock exchanges. 
 
6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
6.1 Stratigraphy  
 
The stratigraphy throughout both the ML and EPL's has been ascertained from 
gravity cores (with a penetration potential of up to 3m) and older (Gencor) vibrocore 
(with a penetration of up to 6m). The phosphatic horizon, which overlies a grey-green 



 11

clay of Miocene age, is subdivided into two distinct layers; an upper 0.1 to 1.0 m thick 
shelly phosphorite identified as Holocene in age and demonstrating a downward 
fining sequence and a lower 0.05 to >2.0 m thick clayey phosphorite identified as 
Pleistocene in age. Within EPL 3323 the upper shell layer locally thickens to in 
excess of 1.5 m (to 1.8m). 
 
Comments provided in subsequent sections relate to the results obtained by gravity 
coring which is restricted to the upper 3m of the deposit. 
 
6.2 Spatial Variation 
 
Figure 6.1 shows that a well-defined SSW trending zone of thicker phosphatic 
sediment (>1m) exists throughout the central portion of EPL 3414 into the north-
western part of EPL 3415. It may well continue further to the south but here it is in an 
area of deeper water. The true thickness of phosphatic sediment within this zone 
cannot yet be determined due to the limited depth penetration of the gravity corer and 
thus variations in the palaeo-topography of the upper surface of the underlying grey-
green clay cannot be precisely established. Along its margins, the thickness declines 
gradually to less than 25cm in areas where the upper shelly horizon lies directly on 
the grey-green clay with little or no intervening sandy or clayey phosphate. This 
thicker zone also coincides with an area of higher grade (see Figure 6.2) reflecting 
the influence of the thickening of the higher grade Layer 2. 
 
EPL3323 is clearly separated from the EPL 3414 deposit by a zone in which 
phosphatic material is thin and in which Layer 1 generally lies directly on the 
underlying grey-green clay. This same zone can be traced into the northern and 
central portion of EPL 3415. The thicker area of EPL3323 is partly explained by the 
localized reappearance of Layer 2 but as the eastern edge is approached, this is the 
product of a thick low-grade clay section (see Figure 6.2) which may represent a 
facies equivalent of Layer 2 or the underlying grey-green clay. 
 
Figure 6.1 indicates that the central part of EPL3415 appears to be the 
southwestward continuation of the thicker zone in EPL3323 showing a westward 
thinning as in EPL 3323. However, it has a higher grade as Layer 2 is better 
developed and contains an area that has been allocated an Indicated status.

6.3 Mineralization 
 
The phosphatic material within the sediment is predominantly comprised of 
unconsolidated fine sand sized phosphorite ooliths and pellets, falling in the 100 to 
500 micron grain size range (mostly 150 to 250 microns). These pellets are formed of 
concentric phosphate layers and predominantly comprise calcium carbonate and 
P2O5. They can also contain quartz grains, ilmemite and sulphides. 
 
The phosphorite pellets form a matrix with organic rich mud and supports a 
downward fining and declining bed of coarse to fine shell fragments (bivalves and 
foraminifera) in the winnowed upper part of the deposit.  The lower part of the deposit 
is shell free and clay rich in the matrix. 
 
Grades for individual samples rarely exceed 23% P2O5 and the majority lie between 
17 and 21% P2O5. Average layer grades are typically 19 - 20% P2O5 for the lower 
layer (2) and 18 -19% for the upper layer (1). Overall deposit grades decrease both 
laterally and vertically, reflecting the pinchoutout of Layer 2 to the east and to the 
west so that Layer 1 then sits directly on the underlying clay. In addition, decreases 
in grade may also be due to the local increase in clay infiltration or deposition or to 
the winnowing action of bottom currents near the water-sediment interface. 
 
7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
These phosphate deposits are characterized by their spatial continuity (especially in 
a NNE direction) and general uniformity in grade. Thickness variations are generally 
the product of thicker accumulation of sediment in very shallow palaeotopographic 
depressions in the underlying clay surface. The phosphate is thought to be the 
product of synsedimentary chemical precipation and early diagenetic concretionary 
growth within the unconsolidated sediment. 
 
8.0 EXPLORATION 
 
Prior to the 2008 and 2009 programmes of work undertaken by Bonaparte and the 
Joint Venture, licences EPL 3414, 3415 and 2027G have been investigated in some 
detail by previous explorers. The locations of the previous samples, and the results, 
are shown in Figure 8.1 which also shows Bonaparte's 2008 grab sampling results in 
the adjacent licence EPL 3323. 
 
Union Resources Ltd (part of the Sandpiper JV) record that phosphates were 
originally discovered in this area in the 1970s during regional marine surveys. In 
1992 and 1994 Gencor drilled 50 vibrocorer holes, mainly in EPL 3414 and 3415 and 
at waters depths of between 200 and 300m though some holes did stray into EPL 
3323. Though data only exists for 38 of these holes, the results were very 
encouraging with grades between 15 and 22% P2O5 and thicknesses in 8 holes in 
EPL 3414 lying between 2.62 and 5.05m, Peripheral areas displayed thicknesses of 
between 1 and 2.0 m. As can be seen from Figure 8.1, the spacing of these holes 
was too large to demonstrate continuity of the phosphate horizon. However, bulk 
sampling in 2004 by the Ocean Phosphate Consortium in EPL 3415 demonstrated 
the local continuity of grade and thickness (see Figure 8.1) in an area where grades 
lay between 16.66 and 18.35% P2O5 and thicknesses between 3.1 and 6.36m. 
Grades and thicknesses in the northern part of EPL 3415 were, however, lower and 
those in EPL 2027G were very low.

Figure 8.1:  Location of Gencor vibrocorer samples (large squares) 

 
The above results provided sufficient evidence to support the view that the Sandpiper 
Project Area could host significant quantities of phosphate, a view that was later 
confirmed by the 2008 / 2009 grab and core sampling programme.  
 
9.0 DRILLING 
 
9.1 The Gravity Corer 
 
Samples collected for the purposes of the current updated resource estimates were 
obtained using gravity coring techniques. Details of the sampling method using a 
gravity corer and all the associated procedures, are to be found in the April 2009 
report (see References) however, a summary is presented below. 
 
The original gravity corer used in 2008 and 2009 comprised a 1.5m long dart section 
which weighs 110kg. The corer had a hollow mid section that could be filled with 
cement to increase the weight of the corer to over 400kg. The corer was lifted by 
three lifting wires gathered at a shackle, which allowed it to hang vertically over the 
side of the ship with the point down. A tail fin provided stability when it was free 
falling through the water. Attached to the dart section was a 3m long steel pipe 



 16

section that contained a 3m long 2-inch internal diameter plastic sample barrel. The 
corer was lowered to within 15m of the seabed and then dropped in third gear for the 
remaining 15m to impale the seabed before being pulled out of the sediment and 
recovered to the vessel.  
 
In 2010 and 2011 three generations of a new gravity corer were built and utilised. 
These newer gravity corers weighed between 350 and 700kg and could be fitted with 
steel pipe sections that ranged from 3m to 4.5m long. The steel pipe was fitted with 
75mm or 90mm diameter plastic sample barrels in which the core could be 
recovered. The gravity corer is deployed using the vessels main winch. This winch is 
not a free fall winch. The gravity corer works with a lever controlled mechanical 
braking system. A 50kg weight on a 5m cable keeps the brake in a locked position 
while the gravity corer is lowered towards the sea bed on the main winch cable 
(16mm). When the 50kg weight reaches the sea bed the weight on the lever goes 
slack, releasing the lever, which allows the brakes to release. The gravity corer then 
takes a controlled drop of up to 5m to the seabed on a built in 13mm wire spool that 
sits at the top of the corer.  Although good core recovery was obtained in most areas 
there were areas where the corer failed to penetrate the phosphorite horizon due to 
the presence of dense shell concentrations. 
 
9.2 Sampling Programme and Approach 
 
Reconnaissance sampling during the 2008/9 programmes was largely concentrated 
in those areas where water depths are between 200 and 300m and thus potentially 
mineable given additional modifications to the proposed dredging vessel. This work 
brought the total strike length covered to 90 km at an east-west line spacing of 
4000m and with a spacing along lines of close to 1600m.  
 
The 2010/11 programme of gravity corer sampling was completed in March 2011 and 
occupied 100 sample sites on a regional infill sample grid in EPL 3414 and the 
western portion of EPL 3323 (the northern portion of the Sandpiper Project Area). 
This sampling area also incorporates the Initial Target Mining Area (ITMA) which lies 
in water depths of <225m for development using the Jan De Nul dredger "Christobal 
Colon". This programme was aimed at demonstrating the continuity of the 
mineralization in the ITMA over an area of approximately 25 x 8 km and to identify 
areas of consistent thickness and mineralization grading above 20% P2O5 in the 
upper levels of the deposit. In addition, it was undertaken to define an area for 
detailed follow-up sampling to further upgrade current Inferred Mineral Resources to 
the higher category of Indicated Mineral Resource to support a 25 year mine 
development plan for the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). 
 
The 100 sample sites included 10 closely spaced sites from which cores were 
obtained to create a bulk sample for preliminary processing studies. These sites were 
concentrated on intermediate lines between existing 4000m spaced sampling lines 
and thus reduced the line spacing to 2000m. The sample spacing on these lines was 
1600m though locally in the east it was reduced to 800m. The location of these new 
sites in relation to previous sampling sites is shown in Figure 9.1. This spacing is 
considered adequate for the assignment of an Inferred Mineral Resource status.  
 
The use of the upgraded gravity corer system allowed greater penetration depths 
than in the initial phase of sampling in 2008/9 with an average penetration depth of 
1.65m (previously 1.22m) and a maximum penetration depth of just over 3m in water 
depths of between 180 and 300m. The average thickness of mineralization (Layers 1 
and 2) intersected was 1.51m. 
 



 17

No additional sampling has been undertaken in the two "Indicated Resource Areas" 
(IRAs) or in EPL 3415. 
 
Standard QA/QC procedures were followed during the sampling programme and 
included an examination of: 
 

 The effectiveness of the GPS positioning system (by comparison with an 
independent GPS and reference to a fixed position). 

 
 The quality of samples collected (by observation). 

 
 The reliability of the record keeping (records kept and signed off). 

 
 The labelling of samples (all samples inspected and labelling improved as 

necessary). 
 

 Whether samples were missing or if extra samples were collected. 
 

 Whether storage of samples was satisfactory (no leakage, and careful 
handling of samples).

10.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
10.1 Sample Collection 
 
Sample collection and preparation took place in Luderitz and was under the control of 
geologists directly employed by Minemakers. 
 
Gravity cores are contained within 55mm, 75mm or 90mm internal diameter blue 
plastic piping cut and capped at the length of the core onboard the vessel. These 
cores are split longitudinally and then sub-sampled to obtain approximately 120 to 
170g of wet material to generate 70 to 120g of dry material for XRF analysis. 
Sampling was done separately for the shelly phosphate unit and the clayey 
phosphate unit, except where very thin, when it was included in the shelly sample. If 
a unit exceeded 75cm in length then that unit was sampled as two or more sub-
samples ranging from 35cm to 70cm depending on the length to be sampled. 
Samples were taken as channels scooped along the interval to be sampled.  
 
10.2 Sample Storage and Security 
 
The majority of samples are stored in Luderitz, Namibia in a workshop facility. The 
samples are in the form of core halves (cut plastic core sleeves) which have been 
cling wrapped to keep the sediment in place and laid out in a dry store room, or grab 
samples in plastic bottles stored in large plastic crates. The premises are surrounded 
by barbed wire fencing and buildings have a linked alarm system. 
 
A number of samples are also stored in Cape Town (selected cores and all 
laboratory pulp samples). Pulp samples are in zip-lock bags sealed in larger batch 
bags. These samples are in a locked store room within a modern rental storage 
building with access control and CCTV monitoring. 
 
10.3 Sample Analysis 
 
Samples were collected for laboratory analysis of major elements by XRF methods 
and also for sediment grain size, petrographic information and metallurgical and 
other tests. Only the data produced by the core sampling has been used in the 
current resource estimation.  
 
Sample analysis was carried out by Scientific Services (Pty Ltd) in Cape Town, South 
Africa. Samples sent to this laboratory are powdered using a swing mill. A portion of 
the sample is taken and then weighed before being heated to 105o C to remove 
water. The sample is re-weighed to establish moisture content, then heated to 750o C 
and weighed again. This gives a Loss on Ignition value. The sample is then used to 
make a glass bead, which is used to run XRF whole rock analyses for major 
elements.  
 
The major elements analyzed for include: 
 
Fe2O3 
MnO 
Cr2O3 
TiO2 
CaO 
K2O 
P2O5 
SiO2

Al2O3

10.4 Quality Control Measures 
 
QA/QC procedures relating to the analytical process were described in Section 10 of 
the June 2009 report (see References) produced by the current Qualified Person for  
Minemakers Limited. Control samples are run using commercially available 
international standards and in-house blanks. The QA/QC procedures included the 
determination of combined analytical and sampling precision and analytical precision 
and used data from both of the JV's licences currently under investigation. 
 
The confidence in a resource estimate, and hence its classification, is not just a 
matter of sample density but also the quality of the sampling and analytical 
procedures. These can be monitored by adherence to a formalized QA/QC protocol. 
The protocol followed by Minemakers normally involves as many of the following 
procedures as possible; 
 

a) Twin drilling to test the reproducibility of sample data at a specific location. 
b) Duplicate sampling and analysis of core to determine the combined sampling 

and analytical precision. 
c) Repeat analysis of samples in the laboratory to determine the analytical 

precision. This procedure is undertaken by the laboratory. 
d) Repeat analysis of 'blind' samples previously analysed by the laboratory but 

resubmitted under new numbers. 
e) Analysis of commercially available accredited standards with each batch of 

routine samples to determine analytical accuracy. 
f) Analysis of a selected batch of samples covering the normal assay range at 

an internationally accredited assay laboratory (referee laboratory). 
g) Analysis of blanks to monitor potential contamination in the sample 

preparation process. 
 
Analysis of samples has been undertaken by Scientific Services CC, Cape Town, 
RSA using XRF methods calibrated using Certified Reference Material. The 
standards inserted into batches are thus based on SARM 32 (39.96% P2O5 with 95% 
confidence limits of 39.71 to 40.23%) using phosphate rock from Phalaborwa 
distributed by the SA Bureau of Standards, Pretoria, and on NIST 694 (30.2% P2O5 
with 95% confidence limits of 28.698 to 31.711%) distributed by the National Institute 
of Standards & Technology, Gaithersburg USA – Western Phosphate Rock. In the 
case of NIST 694, a 50% dilution was made using laboratory grade silica. The 
majority of analyses were internally controlled using the latter standard following 
concerns expressed in previous reports by the QP in June 2009 and March 2011. 
 
Only P2O5 analyses are involved in the resource estimation process and thus only 
P2O5 quality issues are discussed in detail in the following sections. 
 



 21

10.4.1  Twin Drilling 
 
Closely spaced twin holes are usually drilled to confirm grades and thicknesses at a 
specific location but also, if a sufficient number are drilled, they provide an insight into 
the likely nugget effect of a deposit in that differences in values for each pair of holes 
reflect local small scale geological variability as well as sampling and analytical 
errors. In this programme of sampling no twinned holes were planned, however, a 
series of 10 holes were completed in a limited area around old hole number 1797 in 
order to produce a bulk sample for mineral processing test-work. 9 of these fall within 
an area 33x35m and three sets of holes are closely spaced enough to be considered 
as twins with separations of approximately 5m.

  Paired Holes      

 
Table 10.1 shows that for both Layers 1 and 2 the grades are very similar between 
paired holes and also for all 6 of these holes. Thicknesses are however more 
variable with some significance differences in Layer 2. However, it should be pointed 
out that we are dealing with thickness differences of the order of only a few tens of 
centimetres. Within the bulk sample area as a whole, the grades are reasonably 
uniform but the thicknesses are much more variable reflecting local fluctuations in the 
phosphorite accumulations in sea floor depressions. Tonnage estimates for 1000 x 
1000m blocks will thus be of slightly lower confidence.  
 
10.4.2 Duplicate Sampling and Analysis 
 
18 sets of duplicate samples were obtained from 6 holes (1797, 1870, 1882, 1901, 
1923 and 1924), the average grade of which is 21.29%. 
 
The combined sampling and analytical precision is significantly less than 10% at 
6.2% and is thus deemed very satisfactory. Had one pair of samples been removed 
then the result would have been considerably improved. This study confirms that 
sampling and analytical procedures are of high enough confidence to support the 
estimation of Mineral Resources at both Inferred and Indicated levels. 
 



 22

 
10.4.3 Repeat Analysis 
 
Routine repeats 
 
A total of 35 samples were subjected to repeat analysis in the laboratory selected at 
random from a total of 356 routine samples representing 10%; this thus exceeds the 
minimum of 5% normally considered appropriate. The results of this exercise for 
P2O5 are presented in Table 10.2.

Date Repeats Routine 
Average 

Repeat 
Average

Precision 

Up to August 2011 35 18.85 18.69 3.96% 
 
The analytical precision is 3.96% which is satisfactory being less than the 5% 
normally considered acceptable. The means of the two populations are very similar 
which is also very encouraging. 
 
10.4.4 Standards 
 
The analysis of both routine and duplicate samples plus laboratory repeat analysis of 
pulps, was undertaken in conjunction with the analysis of selected standards. A total 
of 14 standards were included in routine analytical batches including one in a batch 
of repeat samples. The first batch used SARM 32 but all subsequent batches were 
analysed with the NIST 694 standard (50%). A total of 391 routine and repeat 
analyses were accompanied by the 14 standard analyses representing 3.6%. A 
breakdown of the results for each standard is presented in Table 10.3.

value 

Average 
Value 

SARM 32 2 39.96 40.94 
NIST 694 (50%) 12 15.10 15.32 

 
The average deviation from the 'accepted' values was less than 2.5% and the worst- 
case deviation was 3.5%. No systematic trend is observed that would indicate 
instrumental drift though all analyses except one were above the 'accepted' value. 
 
The implication of this QA/QC procedure is that the analyses of the routine samples 
may be a little on the high side. However, the Qualified Person (QP) does not 
consider this to have any major impact on the confidence of the quoted Mineral 
Resource. 
 
10.4.5 Blanks 
 
A total of 18 blanks (laboratory grade silica) were inserted into the four batches. No 
evidence of laboratory contamination was produced by their analysis which ranges 
between 0.00 and 0.02% P2O5, close to the limit of detection by XRF (0.01%). 
 
10.4.6 Conclusion 
 
The conclusion is that sampling and analytical procedures are more than adequate to 
allow the assignment of NI 43-101 compatible Mineral Resource classifications to 



 23

resources based on this sampling. It is also apparent that samples are stored 
appropriately and in secure facilities. 
 
11.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
11.1 General introduction and database construction and manipulation 
 
Previous studies, prior to the estimation of Inferred Resources for EPL 3323 
(December 2008 Report for Bonaparte) have clearly demonstrated that the 
phosphate deposit in the area of detailed sampling in this licence can be subdivided 
into an upper horizon, Layer 1, characterized by its high shell content, its lower grade 
and by its general uniformity in thickness and spatial distribution and into a lower 
horizon, Layer 2, characterized by its lower shell content and higher clay content and 
by its higher grade. 
 
The 2010/11 infill sampling programme covered both EPL 3414 and 3323 and thus 
the decision was taken to combine both new and old data for both areas into one 
database and produce one combined mineral resource estimate. This can be justified 
as both EPLs cover the same phosphate deposit. As one of the aims of the recent 
sampling programme was to improve depth penetration, this approach would 
necessitate the deletion of some of the previous holes which, if retained, would have 
resulted in line anomalies. In addition, duplication of hole data would occur because 
samples outside each of the EPL boundaries were originally used to assist in the 
modelling of areas close to the boundary. Database construction and manipulation 
was a two stage process; the first involved the combination of all three databases 
with some deletions and the second additional deletions to remove old data that 
would result in an unrealistic geological model for the deposit. 
 
The current mineral resource update is targeted at Inferred Mineral Resources only 
and no attempt was made to revise the Indicated Mineral Resources in the two areas 
selected for early mining, one in each licence. Their databases (separate Layer 1 and 
2) thus remain unchanged. 
 
The data provided to the Qualified Person for the 100 new sites sampled with the 
gravity corer, consisted of P2O5 values for specified assay intervals and also 
weighted averages for each of the various layers recognized in the stratigraphic 
profile. Depth ranges and thicknesses in each case were also provided. 
 
All databases were thoroughly checked for transcription errors, missing or duplicated 
data and for errors in coordination (plots of sample points used to detect anomalous 
locations).  
 



 24

11.2 Global Resource Database – EPL 3414 and 3323 
 
The first phase of verification and manipulation for the new sampling data involved 
the deletion of all replicate sample results in favour of the first "routine" samples. Four 
holes re-drilled to attain greater depth were also deleted in favour of the re-drill. 
 
A series of holes were drilled in the proximity of old hole 1477 to provide a bulk 
sample referred to as 1797-1. Nine of these holes were sampled and assayed. 
However, one was not accepted for use as it only penetrated the upper Layer 1. The 
remaining 8 were retained in the database, despite data clustering, allowing the 
software to average out the thicknesses and grades over the area covered. Though 
grades were fairly uniform in this area, there was clearly some local scale variability 
in thickness reflecting variability in the topography of the floor of the deposit. 
 
In two holes (1873 and 1918), a second high grade layer was penetrated at the base 
beneath a clay layer that had been labelled on sections as Layer 3. There is 
insufficient data at this time to determine its spatial continuity and to make any 
attempt at resource estimation and thus this mineralization was not included with 
Layer 1 and 2 in the database. 
 
The Minemakers' raw assay database contains weighted grades and combined 
thicknesses for Layers 1 and 2 for use in the estimation of Inferred Mineral 
Resources. However, in 31 cases these grades were enhanced by the application of 
a 10% P2O5 assay footwall cut-off grade to remove low-grade material at the bottom 
of these holes above the footwall clays. 
 
Following these modifications to the new data, the original databases for EPL 3414 
and 3323 were added. The former includes 8 samples from the northern extremity of 
EPL 3415 needed to improve modelling in the nearby area of 3414. 
 
A plot of old and new sample locations then revealed that some of the old sites had 
been revisited and deeper intersections obtained. These old holes were thus 
removed from the database. However, in one case (1854), a new hole was deleted in 
favour of the previous hole at a nearby location (1474). Another old hole 1439 was 
deleted because it had a suspiciously low grade compared with surrounding 
information. 
 
Following this first phase 453 holes remained in the database. During the second 
phase of data processing, all old data (pre 2010/11) was removed except where: 
 

a) old data extended further westwards beyond the new data, 
b) its thickness values are compatible with those on adjacent new infill lines and 
c) old holes reached footwall clay (Layer 3). 

 
At this time all duplicated holes were removed; i.e., holes appearing in both the 
separate EPL 3414 and 3323 databases. The final fully vetted database now 
contained data from 377 sampling sites. Of these 154 cores (40.8%) reached the 
underlying footwall clay, 142 (37.7%) penetrated into mineralized layer 2 while a 
further 81 (21.5%) failed to reach beyond Layer 1.  In the latter two cases, it is 
possible that some were close to the footwall of the deposit. Resources computed 
using this data will thus be conservative in terms of tonnage but the general 
uniformity of grade down through the profile means that there will be little impact on 
overall resource grade. 
 



 25

The average thickness and grade for these sites is 121.5 cm and 18.98% P2O5 
respectively. 
 
Figure 11.1 shows the distribution of all samples used for resource estimation within 
the combined licence areas.

12.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
In 2004, pilot processing tests and mineralogical analysis and were performed on a 
sample of from the Sandpiper project area.  
 
The pilot tests on phosphoric acid production were done by Prayon–Rupel 
technologies, (Wet Phosphoric Acid process specialists) on beneficiated sample 
(screened to 125-450micron). The tests confirmed that merchant grade phosphoric 
acid with 52% P2O5 could be produced from Sandpiper rock phosphate concentrate 
of 27% P2O5 with appropriate treatments for handling contained organics, Fe, Al and 
Mg. Tests by Bateman Phosphate Technologies in 2001 also showed that a 25% 
P2O5 concentrate can be produced from an in-situ sample grade of 18% P2O5 by 
simple gravity screening to 125-450 micron.   
 
Historical testwork suggests there is an adequate expectation for the resources to be 
utilised on a commercial basis. 
 
13.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
13.1 Introduction 
 
For Inferred Mineral Resources, the entire intersection of phosphate, constrained by 
a 10% footwall assay cut-off grade, has been used in contrast to Indicated Mineral 
Resources where the deposit has been subdivided into two layers reflecting their 
different lithological and continuity characteristics. Grade values have been 
interpolated into a 2D matrix of resource blocks using IDW methods. This has been 
achieved indirectly by the 2D modelling of thickness and metal accumulation. 
 
Excessive extrapolation of block information has been limited by the parameters 
used to define search areas and the relative weighting given to sample values. In 
addition, a resource perimeter has been constructed around the area whose 
boundaries coincide with the boundary of the EPL. 
  
The JV has undertaken preliminary in-house techno-economic studies of the cost of 
dredging using a trailing suction hopper dredge and on-shore processing which 
indicate that insitu grades of 15% P2O5 are economic and potentially mineable at 
currently forecast future prices. Minimum mineable thicknesses achievable by the 
dredge are still under consideration but are at least 1m and could go down to 0.5m. 
For the current resource update, a 10% block cut-off grade has been selected to 
define the margins of a potentially economic deposit. Cost estimates have been 
received for modification of an existing dredge to allow it to mine at water depths of 
up to 225m initially and to depths of 250m with further development. 
 
Tonnages estimates are based on densities and moisture contents whose 
determination is described in Section 8 of the June 2009 report to which the reader is 
referred. 
 
In the case of Inferred Mineral Resources, volumes have been converted into wet 
tonnages using a conservative estimate of 1.68 tonnes / m3. The dry tonnage was 
then estimated using a factor of 0.75 based on the average of all measurements 
available at the time of writing. 
 



 27

13.2 Global Resources - EPL 3414 and 3323 
 
The parameters used for interpolation of thicknesses and metal accumulations into 
the block matrix are unchanged from previous estimates for these licences and are 
shown in Table 13.1.  
 
Table 13.1: IDW parameters

The block dimensions (1000 x1000m) reflect the wide spacing of the holes in the 
licence area (see Figure 11.1). Reconnaissance holes were laid out on a 4000 x 
1600m grid and infill lines reduced this to 2000 x 800m. An elliptical search area, with 
major axes on an azimuth of 24o and an axial ratio of 2:1, was used to reflect the 
geometric anisotropism of the sampling grid and also the geological trends in the 
data (greater NNE continuity). 
 
Figures 13.1 and 13.2 show the thicknesses (cm) and metal accumulations (cm%) 
respectively interpolated into blocks while Figure 13.3 for grade is derived by dividing 
these two variables in each block in a spreadsheet and then re-importing them into 
Surfer. The results database was then modified to delete the two "Indicated 
Resource Area" using internal blanking files.  
 
13.3 Inferred Mineral Resources – EPL 3414 and 3323. 
 
Peripheral blocks in the global resource block matrix with less than the 10% P2O5 
grade threshold were deleted to produce a Mineral Resource estimate at this cut-off 
grade. Some internal blocks with marginally lower grades were, however, retained as 
were some peripheral blocks surrounded on three sides by higher grades. 
 
In addition, all blocks with thicknesses of <25cm were deleted in areas where very 
thin or no phosphate had been recorded above the grey-green clay. This threshold is 
not to be considered as a minimum mining thickness but as a means of screening out 
areas which are barren but into which value has been extrapolated by the IDW 
process. A minimum mining thickness will be applied during the conversion of 
resources to reserves at a later stage. 
 
The resultant block plots for thickness and grade are presented as Figures 13.4 and 
13.5.  
 
This exercise was also repeated using a 15% block cut-off grade but no plots are 
provided here. Table 13.2 shows a comparison of the results obtained using these 
two cut-off grades. The application of a lower cut-off grade has only marginally 
increased the tonnage available at the expense of a lightly lower grade.

13.4 Inferred Mineral Resources – EPL 3415 
 
No additional sampling has been undertaken in EPL 3415 and hence the mineral 
resources reported in September 2009 still stand. The block plots based on a 15% 
block cut-off grade and a 25cm minimum thickness are thus reproduced in Figures 
13.6 and 13.7.  However, new estimates based on the previous global resources 
block matrices have now been produced using a 10% cut-off grade in order to assess 
the impact of this change in cut-off from 15%. The results are shown in Table 13.3. It 
should be noted that the results for the Northern area remain unchanged as no 
blocks had been assigned grades of between 10 and 15% in this area.

13.5 Grade Tonnage Relationships for EPLs 3414, 3415 and 3323 Combined 
 
All global resource blocks (thickness and grade) for EPL 3415 were combined with 
those for EPL 3414 and 3323 to produce a combined Sandpiper Project Mineral 
Resource spreadsheet. 29 of these with thicknesses below 25cm were deleted but 2 
others originally in the 3414/3323 block database were retained though they were 
marginally below this threshold. The combined file, containing 1159 blocks, was 
sorted by grade and the tonnages of each block accumulated above a series of 
thresholds from 0 to 20%. The results are presented in Table 13.4 and in Figures 
13.8 and 13.9. 
 
The tonnages curves in Figure 13.8 clearly show that the tonnage remains stable 
until a 15% cut-off grade is reached but beyond this, the tonnages fall as the cut-off 
increases. Similarly, the "grade above threshold" curve in Figure 13.9 remains stable 
between 10 and 15% after which there is a steady increase.

13.6 Revision of Grab Sample Resources in EPL 3323 
 
The extension of core sample based Inferred Mineral Resources into the Western 
Resource Area of EPL 3323 (Compare Figure 13.1 and Figure 13.10) has 
necessitated the revision of grab sample based resources to exclude these 
resources. At the same time, the opportunity has been taken in this update to 
determine the grab sample resources at a range of cut-off grades (0, 5, 10 and 15%) 
and to produce estimates for the whole of this licence area not just for the Western 
and North-Eastern Resource Areas as was the case in the December 2008 
Statement of Resources (based on a 10% cut-off grade alone). 
 
In order to remove those grade blocks now covered by core based blocks, a series of 
blanking files were produced each based on a cut-off grade boundary around the 
eastern margin of the core blocks in EPL 3323. These blanking files were used to 
remove grab-based blocks below each of these cut-offs from the block matrix 
covering the whole of EPL 3323 (produced in December 2008). Figure 13.11 shows 
an example of the grab sample block matrix after deletion of the >10% core blocks.

The tonnages and grades of the remaining resources were then calculated and the 
results presented in Table 13.5. The information in Table 13.5 is also presented in 
graphical form in Figures 13.12 and 13.13.

13.7 Resource Classification 
 
Though the density of regional sampling in most of EPL 3414, EPL 3415 and EPL 
3323 is too low to allow anything but an Inferred status to be applied, within their 
respective "Indicated Resource Areas", the density of sampling (400 x 400m) is more 
than adequate to allow the assignment of an Indicated Mineral Resource 
classification. Variographic studies are now available which indicate that 
geostatistical ranges for thickness, metal accumulation and grade are generally in 
excess of 450m and as high as 1250m, in the case of a directional variogram in EPL 
3415. The boundary between Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources in terms of 
sample spacing is set at the point at which no serial correlation (Covariance) exists 
between samples. This spacing is represented by the geostatistical range. The level 
of geological understanding and knowledge of this area of the Namibian continental 
shelf is also more than adequate to support an Indicated status as are the results of 
QA/QC procedures which were initially described in Section 10 of the June 2009 
report and later updated in this Section 12 of the March 2011 report and also in 
Section 10.4 of the current report. 
 
13.8 Statement of Mineral Resources 
 
Based on the information presented above, all the Mineral Resources estimated for 
the gravity cored areas of EPL 3414, 3415 and 3323 are considered to be fully NI 43-
101 and JORC compliant. Estimates are rounded to reflect the level of confidence in 
these resources at the present time. 
 
The Mineral Resources listed in Table 13.6 are determined using a 10% block cut-off 
grade and a minimum thickness of 25cm. Previous resource estimates based on core 
samples were based on 15% block cut-off grades as shown in Tables 13.7 and 13.8. 
This change has been made at the request of Minemakers. For Tables 13.6 and 13.8 
average wet tonnage factors of 1.68 tonnes per cubic metre are applied to Inferred 
Mineral Resources which are converted to dry tonnages using a factor of 0.75. In the 
case of Indicated Mineral Resources in Tables 13.7 and 13.9, Layer 1 and 2

13.8.3 Factors affecting Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
All of the resources estimated in this report are in tenements owned by Namibian 
Marine Phosphates (Pty) Ltd ("NMP") and that company advises that all of the 
tenements are currently in good standing. 
 
A Definitive Feasibility Study on the economics of development of the phosphate 
resources is being carried out for NMP by independent and appropriately qualified 
local and international consultants. NMP advises that, at this time, is not aware of 
any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or 
other factors which are likely to cause a material effect on the mineral resource 
estimates herein. 
 
13.9 Reconciliation of Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
Where new gravity core sample coverage has been obtained, the grab sample 
resources in the old Western Area of EPL 3323 have been deleted from the new 
updated table (Table 13.6) as they have been converted to the core resources 
quoted in this table. Table 13.6 quotes all Inferred Mineral Resources at a 10% cut-
off grade; previously a cut-off grade of 15% was applied. This also accounts for some 
of the change in total resources. The updated resource now contains the remainder 
of the grab resources in EPL 3323 not previously included in resource statements. 
 
There has been no change in the magnitude of Indicated Mineral Resources since 
the 2010 NI 43 -101 compliant report. The combined area of these three separate 
resources is 37.86 km2. 
 
The Inferred Mineral Resources based on gravity coring in the combined 3414 and 
3323 areas has increased from 1.232 billion wet tonnes at 19.3% P2O5 to 1.705 
billion wet tonnes at 19.0% P2O5. If the equivalent resources for EPL 3415 are 
included then the total Inferred Mineral Resource for the Sandpiper project area is 
2.364 billion wet tonnes at 18.7% P2O5. The new resource estimates are based on a 
10% cut-off grade. These increases in tonnage reflect change in the cut-off grade, 
the deeper penetration of the modified gravity corer employed in the latest 
programme and the slightly extended coverage.  
 
The combined area of Inferred Mineral Resources in the 3414 and 3323 areas 
(based on core sampling) has increased from 656 km2 to 791 km2 as a direct result of 
the recent programme of sampling and also the change in block cut-off grade to 10% 
P2O5. Addition of the revised estimates for EPL 3415 using the new cut-off grade 
increases these areas to 946.5km2 and 1109.5 km2 respectively.

14.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

1) Compilation of available data for all three licence areas shows that there are 
two distinct parallel zones of thicker phosphatic material. The best developed 
passes through EPL 3414 into the north of EPL 3415, however, water depth 
is increasing to excess of 300m at this southwestern extremity. The second 
zone, to the east, passes through the south west part of EPL 3323 (where it is 
weakly developed) into EPL 3415 where it is much better developed in an 
area with water depths of 200 to 300m. 

 
2) The modifications undertaken to the gravity corer since the March 2011 report 

have improved sample recovery in EPLs 3414 and 3323 and also achieved a 
significant improvement in depth penetration. However, this is still not 
sufficient to obtain complete intersection of the phosphate horizon down to 
the footwall clays. 

 
3) The completion of infill lines, reducing the line spacing to 2000m, has 

confirmed the continuity of mineralization and P2O5 grade. 
 

4) Coverage of EPL 3415 is still incomplete as no additional sampling has been 
undertaken in this licence area, priority being given to 3414 and 3323 due to 
their shallower water depth. Though three separate areas exist from the point 
of view of sampling, two of these have been merged as a result of 
extrapolation by the software. As a consequence, assessment of the full 
extent of the potential mineralization remains incomplete. 

 
5) Sampling, core logging and petrographic analyses appear to have been 

undertaken with great care though these procedures have not been directly 
witnessed by the Qualified Person.  

 
6) Close spaced drilling continues to confirm that sample grades revealed by the 

gravity corer are representative of the area in which they lie. Thicknesses 
obtained from complete intersections reveal some variability over distances of 
10s of metres reflecting variable compaction rates and local changes in the 
floor of the depression in which the phosphate has accumulated. 

 
7) Inter-laboratory analytical comparisons have not been made during the 

current programme but previous studies did indicate that there is no 
systematic bias in the results from the routine laboratory though comparisons 
give repeatability precisions no better than 10%. 

 
8) Improvements in analytical precision are evident compared with previous 

studies of QA/QC results and are now considered very satisfactory. 
 
9) QA/QC procedures have been followed and the results have been examined 

by the Qualified Person and have been found to be compatible with the level 
of confidence expected for NI 43 -101 compatible Mineral Resources. 

 
10) The deletion of some of the previous data from the resource database is 

justified as it would have affected the quality of the resource model by 
introducing line anomalies where poor penetration depths were achieved. 

 
11) The 2010/11 sampling programme was aimed at completing the coverage of 

EPLs 3414 and 3323 at a sampling density sufficient for the determination of 
an Inferred Mineral Resource. This work has allowed the definition of priority 



 45

target areas for the next phase of closer spaced sampling (currently in 
progress) aimed at the production of Indicated Mineral Resources for the 
Definitive Feasibility Study. 

 
12) The increase in Inferred Mineral Resource reported in this study largely 

reflects the deeper penetration of the modified gravity corer and the slightly 
extended coverage. Despite the removal of some of the previous data from 
the database, there has been no significant change in grade and there is 
every indication that grade variations are gradual and predictable. 

 
13) The reduction in the Block Cut-off Grade from 15% to 10% has only slightly 

increased the tonnages available with a concomitant small reduction in grade. 
 

14) The resource estimates presented are considered to be conservative in terms 
of tonnage as phosphate is known to continue below those intersections 
which failed to reach the underlying grey-green clay. 

 
15) Preliminary mineral processing tests and studies undertaken in 2001 and 

2004 suggest that there is the potential for economic upgrading of Run of 
Mine material to a saleable product. This has also been support by October 
2010 scoping study results. This is accepted by the QP as further support for 
the definition of Mineral Resources within the Sandpiper Project Area. 

 
15.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The following recommendations are made for consideration by Minemakers Ltd.  

 
1) Attempts should continue to be made to improve depth penetration in Layer 2 

in all three EPLs possibly through the introduction of a vibracorer. 
 

2) Coverage of EPL 3415 at a 4000m line spacing needs to be completed with 
localized infill lines where warranted. 

 
3) Once the drilling for Indicated Mineral Resources is complete, further 

investigation of the eastern margin of the main 3141/3323 phosphate zone 
should be undertaken to resolve some of the problems relating to the thick 
low grade Layer 2 sediments that were intersected in previous sampling work 
and also whether the second lower phosphate rich layer intersected in two 
holes in this area during the recent programme have any spatial continuity 
and should thus be included in future resource estimates. 

 
4) As a large portion of the central and eastern areas of EPL 3323 has only 

been subject to grab sampling, it is recommended that some reconnaissance 
lines be sampled, using the gravity corer, over areas with elevated grades to 
determine whether they have any economic potential in terms of grade and 
thickness.
