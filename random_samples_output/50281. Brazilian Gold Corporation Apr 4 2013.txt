1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining Pty Ltd (Coffey Mining) under its Canadian office, in collaboration with its 

Brazilian office, has been commissioned by Brazilian Gold Corporation (BGC) to conduct a 

preliminary economic assessment (PEA) and prepare an Independent Technical Report, in 

compliance with NI 43-101, on the São Jorge Gold Project, in Para State, Brazil. This report 

includes the amended resource estimate published with Effective Date of 7 December 2012 

and the results of an engineering study with an Effective Date of 31 January 2013.   

The São Jorge gold project has defined mineral resources, at a 0.3 Au g/t, comprised of an 

Indicated Resource of 14.42 Mt at an average grade of 1.54 g/t Au and an Inferred Mineral 

Resource of 28.19 Mt at an average grade of 1.14 g/t Au. The PEA study has included the 

Inferred and Indicated Resource as is allowed under NI 43-101 Guidelines. 

All programs of sampling, assaying and exploration drilling to the effective dates have been 

included in this report.  Changes in commodity pricing and operational costing, as well as the 

improved and updated mineral resource basis, have been incorporated into the PEA study 

and report, as per the respective Effective Dates of the mineral resource and subsequent 

engineering study. 

This report complies with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 'Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects' of June 2011 (the Instrument) and the resource classifications adopted by 

CIM Council in December 2010. 

All costs in this study have been expressed in US dollars unless noted otherwise.  

1.2 Location 

The São Jorge Gold Project is located in the southwest of Pará State Brazil, in the 

municipality of Novo Progresso. The region is known as Tapajós, and São Jorge is located 

70km north of the city of Novo Progresso.  Access to the São Jorge Gold Project from the 

cities of Novo Progresso or Itaituba, is via highway BR163 (+90% paved) or by commercial 

flights from Belem (Pará) or Cuiaba (Mato Grosso) both of which are serviced by international 

flights. Novo Progresso has a population of approx. 60,000 people and will form the base of 

operations for the São Jorge Gold Project. The city provides many of the services and 

supplies required for a project of this size including a skilled work force, fuel, housing, etc. The 

project is connected to the power grid, however it will require upgrading to higher capacity 

from Novo Progresso and installation of a sub-station at site before the start of commercial 

production.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

1.3 Ownership 

BGC, through its Brazilian subsidiaries Brazilian Resources Mineração Ltda., is the sole 

registered and beneficial holder of eleven gold exploration concessions and applications in 

the São Jorge area for a total landholding of 58,500ha; two of these concessions (850.044/06 

and 850.631/04) are under appeal and waiting a decision by the DNPM, however these areas 

are covered by newer BGC concessions with the first right of refusal that are owned by BGC. 

BGC has one of the largest land positions in the Tapajos (approx. 3,500 km2) and completed 

an extensive exploration program in 2011 with over 27,000m of diamond drilling and 

expenditures of approximately $15M, with over 14,000m of the drilling completed on the São 

Jorge Gold deposit. 

1.4 Geology 

The São Jorge property is underlain by a number of granitoid plutons. The gold mineralization 

is hosted in a circular shaped body comprised of the younger São Jorge monzogranite. The 

intrusive body measures approximately 1.2km in diameter and is generally massive, grey to 

pink in colour with a porphyritic granular texture. The São Jorge intrusion trends 290° and is 

sub-parallel to the strike of the regional Cuiú-Cuiú - Tocantinzinho shear zone, which also 

hosts several important gold deposits including the Palito mine, Tocantinzinho and Cuiú-Cuiú 

deposit, and Bom Jardim and Batalha gold prospects. 

1.5 Mineralization 

Gold mineralization is related to a hydrothermal alteration zone in the monzogranite along a 

structurally controlled fracture - vein system approximately 1,400m long and up to 160m wide, 

and intersected in drill holes up to 350m below surface; the mineralization is open along strike 

and down dip.  The main trend is 290° with an almost vertical dip. The main mineralized zone 

is defined by a fairly sharp but irregular contact between altered and unaltered monzogranite 

to the southwest and a more gradational transition from altered to unaltered rocks to the 

northeast. Strong alteration is associated with discrete quartz veinlets (1 to 2cm wide), 

associated with coarse pyrite grains and clusters that cut zones of intense quartz flooding. 

1.6 Project Status 

BGC conducted an exploration program on the São Jorge Gold Project, during 2011, in an 

effort to increase the mineralized resource and raise confidence in the continuity of the 

deposit.  

The 2011 exploration program consisted of soil geochemistry (2,240 samples), geophysics 

(120 line km IP) and diamond drilling (14,708m in 37 holes) in the deposit area as well as 

limited regional prospecting and sampling on the surrounding property. 

The results from the program have been made public and the results of the diamond drilling 

program were used to estimate the updated mineral resource that is reported in this

document. The resources were originally reported in September 2012 and a revision to that 

resource estimate was published and filed in December 2012. This report incorporates wholly 

and completely the information from the December 2012 NI 43-101 technical report. 

The project is managed under an exploration permit granted by Brazilian authorities, which is 

in good standing. 

Work in 2012 included metallurgical testwork in preparation for the new PEA study. 

At the time of reporting, the project awaits the recommendations of the study and project 

financing to proceed. 

1.7 Metallurgy and Mineral Processing 

As an update to the PEA (Coffey 2011), Coffey Mining has undertaken a process flow design 

and scoping-level cost estimate for a gold processing mill based on limited metallurgical 

testwork conducted in 2006, 2012 and 2013 as reported in previous and current technical 

reports. 

The testwork that has been completed, in conjunction with costing estimates, has resulted in 

the proposal of a fairly standard gold plant process flowsheet for precious metal recovery. 

Carbon-in-Leach (CIL), an established gold recovery process, is included in the flowsheet 

while flotation and gravity separation are excluded, as available information currently indicates 

that high recoveries can be achieved by a combination of fine grinding (P80 of 75 microns) and 

leaching.  

The proposed flowsheet incorporates crushing, grinding, thickening, CIL and an Elution 

(adsorption-desorption-recovery or ADR) circuit to produce gold bullion. In addition, a Counter 

Current Decantation (CCD) circuit is incorporated into the flow sheet for tailings management 

and cyanide recovery. 

A heap leach option was briefly explored by Coffey, although the metallurgical performance 

testing had been limited to a single column leach test on both an oxide and sulfide sample. 

The leach recovery rate for the sulfide sample was low, approximately 53 %, whereas the 

oxide material responded well to heap leaching, exhibiting an overall recovery of 79% in the 

column test.  

As the economics for the heap leach option have yet to be proven as viable and recovery 

rates were indicated to be inferior to conventional tank leaching it has been omitted from this 

report, however may be re-examined in future studies as further testwork is completed.    

Coffey and BGC have selected a conventional CIL plant for both oxide and sulfide material 

with a plan to selectively process the oxides before the sulfides. 

Coffey has drawn on the metallurgical testwork results combined with the current resource 

report to develop the input criteria for the São Jorge process flow diagram (PFD). A gold

recovery rate of 93.7% with a 1.56 g/t head grade has been specified for the sulfide material 

while a recovery rate of 88 % with a head grade of 1.26 g/t for the oxides ore is specified. The 

recovery rates cited herein were derived from limited metallurgical testing therefore further 

testwork is required to validate the results. 

Preliminary metallurgical results do indicate that a finer grind can achieve slightly higher 

recovery rates for gold from sulfides while recovery rates from the oxides are largely 

unimproved by grinding to smaller grain sizes.  

The study process design criteria are shown in Table 1.7_1.

The proposed flowsheet for processing both the sulfide and oxide ores includes  

 Primary crushing;  
 SAG milling – when processing of sulfide ore only; 
 Ball milling – for both oxide and sulfide ore; 
 Thickening; 
 CIL; 
 Reagent handling and addition; 
 ADR – elution, carbon regeneration, electrowinning; 
 Calcining; 
 Smelting; 
 CCD; and  
 Tailings disposal 

 

The processing plant footprint is estimated to be ~ 30 000 m2 for a plant site processing 2.5 

million tonnes per annum.  The process plant will be constructed in two phases, the first being 

designed to treat the oxide ore for the first 18 months of operation. After Year 1 of operation, 

additions will be made to the oxide plant in order to treat the remaining sulfide material. These 

additions include the installation of, a SAG mill for the grinding circuit, 3 additional CIL tanks 

with agitators for the leach circuit and a single high rate thickener for the CCD circuit. 

Manpower requirements for the processing plant are summarized in Table 1.7_2

1.8 Resources 

Resource estimates for the São Jorge Gold Project have been generated by Coffey Mining on 

the basis of analytical results available up to 30 April 2012. The resources are reported in this 

Amended Independent Technical report on Mineral Resource São Jorge Gold Project, Para 

State, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101, dated 7th December, 2012.  

The Resource Statement has been determined with an effective date of 7th December 2012 

and has been prepared and reported in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-

101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the Instrument) and the classifications 

adopted by CIM Council in December 2010. The resource estimate has been classified as an

Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource based on the confidence of the input data, geological 

interpretation, and grade estimation. 

In recognition of a significant improvement in the three year trailing average gold price since 

the resource declaration in the report dated September 2010 and consistent with the PEA 

dated July 2011, in this report Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-

off grade of 0.3g/t Au.  

The cutoff grade value estimated by Coffey Mining is based on economic criteria, process 

recovery, government taxes, etc. and represents total revenue value in grams per tonnes that 

is explained as the sum of process cost + mining costs plus G&A + other costs divided by 

price (US$) per ounce (31.1035 g) and multiplied by process recovery. These results are 

shown in the Table 1.8_1.

CoG 0.3 g/t 

Note: The CoG input criteria for the resources estimate pre-dates the 2013 PEA. 

The summary of the total resources (oxide +sulfide) is: 

 14.42 Mt at an average grade of 1.54g/t Au of Indicated Mineral Resources; and 

 28.19 Mt at an average grade of 1.14g/t Au of Inferred Mineral Resources. 

Table 1.8_2 lists the resource tonnes, grade and contained gold ounces per category and for 

alternative cutoff grades above the preferred cutoff of 0.3 g/t Au for the total resource.  Tables

The independent qualified persons responsible for the mineral resources estimate in this 

report and summarised in Tables 1.8_2 are Messrs Porfirio Rodriguez and Hebert Oliveira.  

Mr Rodriguez is a professional Mining Engineer with 33 years of experience in mineral 

resource and mineral reserve estimation. His experience includes uranium, iron ore, gold and 

nickel.  Mr Rodriguez is a Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG).   

Mr Hebert Oliveira is a geologist with 9 years of experience, mostly in resource estimation on 

gold properties. His experience includes iron ore, gold and copper. Mr Oliveira is a Member of 

the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG) and the Australian Institute of Mining and 

Metallurgy (MAusIMM).  Both Messrs Rodriguez and Oliveira are independent of BGC as that 

term is defined in Section 1.5 of the Instrument. 

Dr Norman Lock, BSc, PhD, CGeol FGS is the supervising principal for the work undertaken 

by Rodriguez and Oliveira.  He is a qualified person but not a signing author for this report. 

Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, 

permitting, legal, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

These mineral resources have been estimated on the basis of a block model of the deposit 

which, in the opinion of Coffey Mining, has been constrained to honour appropriate geological 

domains. Grades have been interpolated into individual blocks by Multiple Indicator Kriging 

(MIK), using search radii and these are fully supported by the variography analysis. Coffey 

Mining has estimated and classified the mineral resources contained within the São Jorge 

Gold Project deposit using procedures which are generally accepted within the industry, and 

that these procedures have been properly applied.

1.9 Mine Design 

The São Jorge Mine has been designed as an open pit operation.  The base case operational 
model assumes that all waste stripping and mining operations will be completed by a 
contractor.  The alternate option, illustrated in detail in this report, is an Owner-operated mine.  
The primary difference between these two options is that capital costs for contract mining are 
significantly reduced as compared to Owner-mining, although project operating costs would 
be higher.   
 
Mining at the São Jorge Project will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase will 
comprise removal and processing of the oxidized (laterite and saprolite), gold-mineralized 
layer above the main ore body, referred to as the oxide ore body.  The operation will extract 
and process approximately 3.5 Mt of oxide material in the first two years of operation.  
 
The majority of the deposit volume exists in a granite with sulfide mineralization that contains 
free milling gold.  This is referred to as the sulfide ore body. Subsequent to extraction and 
processing of the oxide cap, mining of the sulfide deposit will commence during the second 
year of operations and ramp up to 2.5 Mt per year, continuing for the next seven years and 
tapering off in the 10th year of mining activity. 

 
The in-pit mining resources were calculated for the engineered pit design at a cut-off grade of 
0.30 Au g/t. The mineable mineral resources estimated inside the present pit shell are 21.7 
Mt, with an average grade of 1.51 g/t. The total waste contained in the São Jorge pit is 
106.4 Mt, resulting in a total of approximately 128.1 Mt of material to be mined.  This results in 
an engineered stripping ratio of 4.90 : 1, approximately 5% higher than that indicated in the pit 
optimization exercise. Table 1.9_1 segments and summarizes the mineralized material and 
estimated gold yield contained within the designed pit shell. The results of the optimized pit 
design and the engineered pit design are similar and compare well, verifying the general 
veracity of the results.

Table 1.9_2 presents the tonnes of ore and waste mined by year based on the operational requirements of a production rate of 2.5 Mt/y of ore 
(run-of- mine, or ROM) delivered to the mill.  It also illustrates the initial mining of the oxide ore body followed by pre-stripping to expose the sulfide 
ore body and then the ramp up to full sulfide production as the oxide ore is exhausted by the end of Year Two. The mine life is estimated at 9.5 
years with the current parameters.

The base case for BGC is a contract mining scenario. BGC has secured a budgetary price 
quote from an experienced Brazilian mining contractor in support of the strategy.  Nevertheless, 
an evaluation of mine plan, schedule, equipment, maintenance, manpower and costs have 
been estimated by Coffey in this study. The estimate is useful as a comparison to contract 
mining and may serve as a benchmark against tendered contracting prices.  
 
Mine support facilities would include a maintenance shop, warehouse, fuel and lubricant 
storage facilities, a fueling station, waste management facilities, maintenance office and backup 
generator. The mine would also have an employee locker room, offices for mine operations and 
technical services.  
 
Requirements for primary mining equipment, consisting of drills, haul trucks, loaders and a 
shovel, have been estimated based on haul distance, expected equipment availability, 
utilization and overall productivity data.  Road maintenance and various other functions within 
the mine will be conducted with secondary equipment and the site will require additional 
support equipment.  Each of the primary, secondary and auxiliary mobile equipment fleets will 
be built up to 17, 8 and 25 units, respectively, over the first few years of operation.  The total 
fleet will number 50 machines at peak production. 

 
Mining operations will be conducted 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 365 days per 
year with two 12 hour shifts per day on a rotating schedule. It is envisioned that three hourly-
paid crews would work a roster of two weeks on, two weeks off, altering shifts on each turn 
around. Manpower requirements for the mine are presented in Table 1.9_3.

1.10 Infrastructure 

The São Jorge Gold Project is located 4 km east of paved highway BR-163 and 70 km north 

of the city of Novo Progresso and is well situated with respect to infrastructure. The town of 

Novo Progresso will form the base of operations for the project and can supply many of the 

consumables and skilled workforce for a project of this size. Staff and workers will live in Novo 

Progresso and be bussed to the site daily, removing the cost of building and operating an 

onsite camp. 

The project will require investment in local infrastructure, localized to the site plus upgrading 

of the existing 75 km power line to tie in to the sub-station at Novo Progresso.  Hydroelectric 

power to the site greatly reduces the power costs for the project as compared to more remote 

projects where power is generated by diesel generators.  The tailings storage facility must 

also be constructed prior to processing mined ore. Service, office and ancillary structures will 

be erected and the site access road upgraded during the construction year.  

1.11 Capital and Operating Costs 

It is recognized that contract mining would enable the São Jorge gold project to be put into 

operation with the least amount of capital expenditure.  The base case of this study presents 

contract mining and the economics of the project on that basis.  In addition, an Owner mining 

scenario has been evaluated, which details and results are also included herein. 

The project capital costs for the contract mining option, estimated at US$100.5 million in start-
up capital and $125.5 million for the LOM, are summarized in Table 1.11_1.  No capital costs 
have been included for mine equipment as the base case reflects the use of contract mining.  
Additionally, the capital cost timing reflects the phased process plant construction with the 
oxide plant constructed in Year 0 followed by the necessary plant additions to process the 
sulfide ore expended in Year 2.

The major capital items for the sulfide processing circuit (Year 2 capital) are the installation of 

the SAG mill, an additional thickener and more leach tanks, complete with the civil works 

required for erection. 

By choosing to utilize contract mining BGC may save as much as 39% on LOM capital as 

compared to purchasing a fleet of mining equipment at the outset of the project. 

The capital cost estimate for the Owner mining option is detailed in Table 1.11_2.

Owner mining would require an additional $49.4 million in LOM capital, with $28.4 million 

required in the first two years of operations and the balance expended as sustaining capital.

A facility for Working Capital will be required, which amount has been estimated at two 

months Accounts Payable and one month labour costs and which, for the accuracy pursuant 

to a PEA, is considered to be funded from a line of credit, yet to be established. 

Mine operating costs have been secured by BGC from a budgetary quotation from a local 

contractor and provided to Coffey. The contractor would be engaged to remove overburden, 

dig saprolite material, strip waste rock and mine the gold-bearing ore.  The average LOM cost 

of contract mining is estimated to be US$3.11 per tonne mined. At a 4.90 : 1 stripping ratio, 

the cost of ROM becomes $18.35 per tonne. BGC would operate the processing mill and 

manage the mine site through the life of the operation. 

The cost estimates for contract mining and gold ore processing at São Jorge are summarized 

in Table 1.11_3.

Owner mining operating costs are estimated to be 23% less for the LOM as compared to 

contract mining. 

The total mine operating costs for an Owner-mining scenario are summarized in Table 

1.11_5, which sum may be directly compared to contract mining.   

Even for an Owner-mining scenario, certain activities would be contracted to local service 

providers, examples being tire maintenance, crew transportation, crane rental, etc. These 

contract services are estimated to represent approximately 5% of mine operating costs.

1.12 Economics 

The economics of the São Jorge project have been evaluated using conventional discounted 
cash flow techniques based on the production schedules, capital expenditures and operating 
costs discussed in this report.  In addition, the following key parameters were integral to the 
cash flow model and the economic results: 

 

 The base case metal price was $1,500 per ounce gold; 
 The analysis is based on 100% equity financing with no debt component; 
 All costs and revenues are reported in "real" or constant US dollars without 

escalation; 
 A base income tax rate of 25% was applied with a 75% reduction as per the general 

understanding of Brazilian income tax laws and associated incentives for projects 
located in underdeveloped Brazilian states; 

 Provision was also made for the Brazilian Social Contribution Tax of 9%; and 
 A base case of contract mining.  

 
Under the estimates and assumptions used for the base cash flow analysis (contract mining 
case), the São Jorge project would be expected to generate an undiscounted, life-of-mine 
after-tax cash flow of US$610.7 million.  At a discount rate of 5% the after tax NPV is 
US$406.6 million.  The life-of-mine economics are presented in Table 1.12_1

Contract mining requires lower capital to get the project up and running.  However, once 

operating, Owner mining presents an opportunity for lower operating costs and superior LOM 

return on investment. A comparison of the costs of capital, operating costs and the resultant 

economic outcomes is presented in Tables 1.12_2, 1.12_3 and 1.12_4.

Owner mining would require 39% more LOM capital, deliver 23% lower operating costs and, 

ultimately, a 5% IRR improvement over contract mining. The investment payback for Owner-

mining is one month shorter than that for contract mining. 

As shown in Table 1.12_5 and Figure 1.12_1, the economics of the São Jorge project are 
most sensitive to variations in the gold price and less sensitive to variations in capital 
expenditures and operating costs.

of the total flow below the confluence.  If this assumption is reasonable then the requirement 

to maintain 80% of the flow downstream of any industrial consumption implies that the 

available water, even at the long term minimum flow rate of about 24m3/s, is far in excess of 

the required off-take by the São Jorge project. The São Jorge project will require less than 1% 

of the allowed off-take (20% of 65.8 m3/s, or 12 m3/s or 43,200 m3/h) to maintain the flow 

downstream of the consumption off-take point which suggests that there is the possibility to 

use the surface water system as a source of water for the mining project.  Site specific studies 

will need to be undertaken to confirm the results of the assumptions made above. 

Identified environmental issues are: 

 Finding a water source for the project; and 

 Gaining a better understanding of the biological and social environments potentially 
affected by the project. 

Baseline environmental studies (both biological and social) are required for the São Jorge 

Gold project site and surrounding local communities to better understand the information that 

is directly applicable to the project in that site specific information is limited.  An Environmental 

Impact Assessment (EIA) needs to be undertaken for the project to assess potential impacts 

as a result of the São Jorge project. 

1.14 Interpretations and Conclusions 

Coffey Mining, in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 which regulates the 

public disclosure of mining companies in Canada, has concluded that the São Jorge Gold 

Project is validated in accordance with industry best practices. 

It is further concluded that: 

 The São Jorge gold project exhibits a robust return on investment - greater than 45% 

after-tax IRR; 

 The option of contract mining would enable BGC to commence operations at São Jorge 

for $50 million less than the alternative of Owner mining; 

 Contract mining operating costs could be as much as 23% greater than the costs of 

Owner mining; 

 The Owner-mining alternative will provide a LOM investment return 5% higher than a 

contract mining option; 

 More metallurgical testing is required to raise the confidence in the projected gold 

recovery, to better ascertain the optimum process configuration and to provide 

adequate data for engineering work at the PFS level of accuracy; 

 The deposit remains open at depth and along strike to the NW and the SE;

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 There is exploration potential on the São Jorge site and at nearby properties close 

enough to enable São Jorge to contemplate providing a toll milling service. 

 The resource tonnage has increased significantly since the estimate in 2011 as a result 

of new drilling by BGC. 

 The resource grade has increased significantly since the last estimate in 2011 as a result 

of in drilling and sampling which enabled a smaller search ellipse in this estimate. 

 Potential head grade enhancement may be possible through selective mining of internal 

waste based on pit mapping and grade control; 

 Potential head grade enhancement may result from further upgrading of inferred 

resource to indicated.  

 Recommended exploration and other technical investigations should be focused on the 

graduation of Inferred resources to at least Indicated resources to be able to incorporate 

more tonnes of mineralized material into a PFS; and 

 The project exhibits certain risks – primarily to fluctuations in the price of gold, but also to 

an inexperienced work force, variations in mineral grade and uncertain metallurgical 

recovery. Mitigating the risks will require effort in personnel training, selective, controlled 

mining, and additional metallurgical testing. 

1.15 Recommendations 

Coffey Mining has considered as recommendations: 

 A new exploration program and budget to drill test and support the conversion of targets 

to mineral resources; and 

 A study to determine the optimum drilling grid for Mineral Resource conversion from 

Inferred to Indicated, based on the current database.  One method is based on analysis 

of kriging variances for existing samples in the study area.  Usually this kind of study can 

save costs and time for the exploration drilling campaigns;  

Coffey Mining recommends the following specific exploration programs for the São Jorge 

project: 

 Deposit drilling to upgrade any near surface (surface to approx. 200m depth) inferred 

resources to indicated resources. 

 Modelling and interpretation of geophysical data: 

 Airborne magnetic survey completed by Fugro in 2006 that covers the entire 
property to identify possible structures for follow-up exploration. 

 Induced polarization survey (120 line km) completed by Fugro in 2011 that covers 
the strike extents of the São Jorge deposit with a particular emphasis on the

resistivity +/- chargeability anomaly located along strike and for 2.5km southeast of 

the São Jorge deposit. 

 Trenching and sampling of targets identified by the modelling and interpretation of the 

geophysical data. 

 Near-deposit diamond drilling of geophysical-geochemical targets. 

 Regional geochemical program to identify new targets on the largely unexplored São 

Jorge property. The program would consist of regional soil traverses using the existing 

east-west roads that cross the property. 

Coffey Mining recommends an exploration program for the São Jorge project to fulfil these 

points that is estimated will cost of the order of $4,000,000. 

Oriented core drilling, geotechnical testing and pit slope engineering is recommended in the 

next engineering study and is required for a preliminary feasibility study (PFS).  

A detailed list of metallurgical testwork is included in the Mineral Processing section of this 

report (Chapter 13), which costs are estimated at US$75,000. 

An environmental base line study, in preparation for an Environmental Assessment, is 

strongly recommended at the outset of the next engineering study.

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Scope of Work 

Coffey Mining Pty Ltd (Coffey Mining) under its Canadian office, in collaboration with its 

Brazilian office, has been commissioned by Brazilian Gold Corporation (BGC) to conduct a 

preliminary economic assessment (PEA) and prepare an Independent Technical Report in 

compliance with NI 43-101 on the São Jorge Gold Project, in Pará State, Brazil. This report 

includes the amended resource estimate published with Effective Date of 7 December 2012 

and the results of an engineering study with an Effective Date of 31 January 2013.  All 

programs of sampling, assaying and exploration drilling to the effective date have been 

included in this report.  Changes in commodity pricing and operational costing, as well as the 

improved and updated mineral resource basis, denote that the economic analysis in the 2011 

PEA is no longer current or material.   

This report complies with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 'Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects' of 30 June 2011 (the Instrument) and the resource classifications adopted 

by CIM Council in November 2010.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Background Information on Brazil 

Brazil occupies a land surface area of about 8.5 million square kilometres, slightly larger than 

Australia. The climate is largely tropical, with more temperate regions in the south.  The 

topography is mostly flat, with rolling lowlands in the north, some plains and a narrow coastal 

belt. The total population is about 198 million and literacy is about 89%. The official language 

is Portuguese, while English, Spanish and French are also spoken. The capital city is Brasilia, 

located in the centre of the country. 

Political conditions in Brazil are stable. Brazil has been a member of the World Trade 

Organisation since 1995 and is a founding member of Mercosul, a trade liberalisation program 

for South America. 

The fundamentals of Brazilian macro-economic policy are based primarily on fiscal austerity, 

the control of inflation and free foreign exchange. The strength of the world economy and the 

high level of liquidity in international financial resources have accelerated production, led to 

more intense global trade, and created favourable conditions for foreign investment and the 

recovery of the country's economy since 2004. 

Brazil's economy, aided by a benign international environment, rebounded very positively 

after the global financial crisis and grew approximately 2.5% in 2012 (2.7% in 2011, 7.7% in 

2010, -0.2% in 2009, and 5.1% in 2008). Sustained growth, coupled with booming exports, 

healthy external accounts, moderate inflation, decreasing unemployment, and reductions in 

the debt-to-GDP ratio.  President Rousseff and her economic team have continued the 

prudent fiscal and monetary policies of former president Lula da Silva and have pursued 

necessary microeconomic reforms. 

Brazil has made strong progress in the last decade.  Brazil's (largely domestic) government 

debt has been reduced in recent years to 38.8% of GDP, of which 15.6% is external debt.  

Total foreign debt, while falling, is still large in relation to Brazil's export base.  Over time this 

concern will be reduced by healthy export growth, which has anchored the positive trade and 

current accounts.  Personal incomes improved since 2004 after a significant decline over the 

previous decade.  Income and land distribution remains skewed. 

Sustaining high growth rates in the longer term depends on the impact of President 

Rousseff's structural reform program and efforts to build a more welcoming climate for 

investment, both domestic and foreign.  Only in its first year, the Rousseff administration has 

yet to produce any changes of significance.   

Brazil's export of resources, oil and gas has been reported for January 2011 as being up 

37.2%, primarily driven by strong commodity prices.  Brazil is the world's largest producer of 

niobium and iron ore, the second largest producer of tantalum, and the third largest producer 

of aluminium, graphite and manganese.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

The 1995, constitutional amendment provided a landmark in Brazilian mining legislation by 

granting foreign companies the right to hold majority ownership in Brazilian projects and 

equality of fiscal and economic treatment.  Today, numerous multi-national mining companies 

are active in Brazil, including Anglo American Plc, Rio Tinto Plc and BHP Billiton Limited. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

Tenements in Brazil are granted subject to various conditions prescribed by the Mining Code, 

including the payment of rent and reporting requirements, and each tenement is granted 

subject to standard conditions that regulate the holder's activities or are designed to protect 

the environment. These standard conditions are not detailed in this report, however where a 

tenement is subject to further specific conditions, these are detailed in the notes 

accompanying the tenement schedule. 

Mineral tenements in Brazil generally comprise Prospecting Licenses, Exploration Licenses 

and Mining Licenses. 

The holder of a granted Prospecting License, Exploration License or Mining License is not 

required to spend a set annual amount per hectare in each tenement on exploration or mining 

activities.  Therefore, there is no statutory or other minimum expenditure requirement in 

Brazil. However, annual rental payments are made to the DNPM (Departamento Nacional de 

Produção Mineral) and the holder of an Exploration License must pay rates and taxes, 

ranging from R$2.36 (Years 1-3) to R$3.58 (Years 4-6), or ranging from US$1.18 to US$1.78 

per hectare, to the Local Government. 

Lodging a caveat or registering a material agreement against the tenement may protect 

various interests in a Mining License. 

If a mineral tenement is located on private land, then the holder must arrange or agree with 

the landowners to secure access to the property. 

4.2.1 Prospecting Licenses 

A Prospecting License entitles the holder, to the exclusion of all others, to explore for minerals 

in the area of the License, but not to conduct commercial mining.  A Prospecting License may 

cover a maximum area of 50 hectares and remains in force for up to 5 years.  The holder may 

apply for a renewal of the Prospecting License which, is subject to DNPM approval.  The 

period of renewal may be up to a further 5 years. 

4.2.2 Exploration Licenses 

An Exploration License entitles a holder, to the exclusion of all others, to explore for minerals 

in the area of the License, but not to conduct commercial mining.  The maximum area of an 

Exploration License is 2,000 hectares outside of the Amazonia region and 10,000 hectares 

within the Amazonia region (Amazonas, Para, Mato Grosso, Amapa, Rondonia, Roraima and 

Acre states).  An Exploration License remains in force for a maximum period of 3 years and 



Coffey Mining 

Coffey Mining 
Av. Afonso Pena 4001 12º andar - Bairro Serra 

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  35 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

can be extended by no more than a further 3 year period.  Any extension is at DNPM's 

discretion and will require full compliance with the conditions stipulated by the Mining Code 

that must be outlined in a report to DNPM applying for the extension of the License. 

Once the legal and regulatory requirements have been met, exploration authorisation is 

granted under an Exploration License, granting its holder all rights and obligations relating to 

public authorities and third parties.  An Exploration License is granted subject to conditions 

regulating the conduct of activities.  These include the requirement to commence exploration 

work no later than 60 days after the Exploration License has been published in the Federal 

Official Gazette and not to interrupt it without due reason for more than 3 consecutive months 

or 120 non-consecutive days, to perform exploration work under the responsibility of a 

geologist or mining engineer legally qualified in Brazil, to inform DNPM of the occurrence of 

any other mineral substance not included in the exploration permit and to inform DNPM of the 

start or resumption of the exploration work and any possible interruption. 

If the holder of an exploration License proves the existence of a commercial ore reserve on 

the granted exploration License, the DNPM cannot refuse the grant of a mining License with 

respect to that particular tenement if the License holder has undertaken the following: 

 An exploration study to prove the existence of an ore reserve. 

 A feasibility study on the commercial viability of the reserve. 

 The grant of an environmental License to mine on the particular tenement. 

4.2.3 Mining Licenses 

A Mining License entitles the holder to work, mine and take minerals from the mining lease 

subject to obtaining certain approvals. 

Mining rights can be denied in very occasional circumstances, where a public authority 

considers that a subsequent public interest exceeds that of the utility of mineral exploration, in 

which case the Federal Government must compensate the mining concession holder. 

A Mining License in Brazil covers an area of between 2,000 hectares and 10,000 hectares, 

depending on the geographical area, as detailed above, and remains in force indefinitely.  The 

holder must report annually on the status and condition of the mine. 

As with other mining tenements, a Mining License is granted subject to conditions regulating 

the conduct of activities.  Standard conditions regulating activities include matters such as: 

 The area intended for mining must lie within the boundary of the exploration area. 

 Work described in the mining plan must be commenced no later than 6 months from the 
date of publication of the grant of the Mining License, except in the event of a force 
majeure.

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  36 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 Mining activity must not cease for more than 6 consecutive months once the operation 
has begun, except where there is proof of force majeure. 

 The holder must work the deposit according to the mining plan approved by the DNPM. 

 The holder must undertake the mining activity according to environmental protection 
standards stipulated in an environmental License obtained by the holder. 

 The holder must pay the landowner's share of mining proceeds according to values and 
conditions of payments stipulated by law, which is a minimum of 50% of CFEM (see 
below), but is usually agreed to be higher under a contract between the holder of the 
Mining License and the landowner. 

 The holder must pay financial compensation to States and local authorities for exploring 
mineral resources by way of a Federal royalty being the CFEM, which is a maximum of 
3% of revenue, depending on commodity.  In Pará State, the royalty on gold deposits is 
1%. 

An application for a Mining License may only be granted solely and exclusively to individual 

firms or companies incorporated under Brazilian law, which will have a head office, 

management and administration in Brazil, and are authorized to operate as a mining 

company. 

4.3 Project Location 

The São Jorge Gold Project is located in the southwest of Pará State, in the municipality of 

Novo Progresso, approximately 70km north of the town of Novo Progresso.  Regional paved 

highway BR-163 passes through the São Jorge project site.  The region is known as the 

Tapajós, and São Jorge is located 320km south of the main regional city Itaituba (Figures 

4.3_1).  Itaituba is located at the intersection of the Trans-Amazonica Highway with the 

Tapajós River.  The topographical coordinates of the project are 6.48º latitude South and 

55.58º longitude West.  The nearest major cities with connections to international flights are 

Belém, Manaus and Cuiba.  Several small regional airlines service Novo Progresso from 

Belem and Cuiba. 

BGC plans to make Novo Progresso its base for operations.  Novo Progresso has a 

population of approximately 60,000 people and can supply the project with labour, fuel and 

equipment that will be necessary to develop the project.

4.4 Tenement Status 

BGC, through its Brazilian subsidiaries Brazilian Resources Mineração Ltda. (BRM)., is the 

sole registered and beneficial holder of eleven gold exploration concessions and applications 

in the São Jorge area for a total landholding of 58,500ha; two of these concessions 

(850.044/06 and 850.631/04) are under appeal and waiting a decision by the DNPM, however 

these areas are covered by newer BGC concessions with the first right of refusal.  

Concession 850.631/04 is currently held by Brazmin, but will be transferred to BRM once a 

decision is made by DNPM. 

The description of the mineral tenure is based on information supplied to Coffey Mining by

4.5 Royalties and Agreements 

Based on information supplied to Coffey Mining by BGC's lawyers FFA, of Rio de Janeiro, 

BGC has complied with all its contractual obligations in respects to the original owners of the 

licenses (see Section 6.2 regarding Ownership History).  The following payments and 

agreements listed below are the remaining contractual obligations to be completed by BGC: 

 License 275 includes a royalty of 1% of the proven mineable reserves as demonstrated 
by a feasibility study relating to the São Jorge deposit (no reserves have been defined 
yet) and Exploration licence 627 includes a 2% NSR, to which BGC can purchase 1.5% 
of this NSR for U$500,000.  

 BGC has a 1% NSR agreement with Talon Metals Corp. on any metal produced from the 
project. 

BGC has the following Landowner Agreement in the São Jorge area: 

 BGC has the obligation to pay R$10,000 per month to Mrs. Laudaete (the current 
landowner of the property on which the Wilson Pit is located), with an option to buy the 
land and associated 0.5% NSR for US$750,000. 

4.6 Environmental Liabilities 

Prior to acquisition of the property by BGC, Talon had completed and filed at the Secretaria 

Estadual de Meio Ambiente– SEMA, an Environment Control Report ("Relatório de Controle 

Ambiental- RCA") and a request for an extension to the Environmental License for Exploration 

License 024(replaced by Concessions 058 and 275). 

This license was previously obtained on May 26, 2006 and was valid until May 25, 2007. 

An extension has been submitted and is under review by SEMA. BGC expects to extend the 

environmental license 058 and 275 (covering the São Jorge Pit) for one additional year, 

starting on the effective date that it will be approved by SEMA. BGC has not yet undertaken 

any environmental study since acquiring the São Jorge Gold Project from Talon and Coffey 

has no new information about that issue. 

4.7 Permitting 

No additional permits are required at the current stage of exploration.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Project Access 

Access to the São Jorge Gold Project from the city of Novo Progresso is via 70km of mostly 

paved roads on highway BR 163, and secondary roads that transect the property (Figure 

4.3.1). 

Itaituba is a well-established city with good port facilities on the Tapajós River, and a capacity 

for large freight aircraft.  Itaituba is located on the Transamazon highway, and is 

approximately 1,000km west of Marabá, which is 1,500km from Brasília via the Belem-Brasília 

highway.  Itaituba can be reached by scheduled jet aircraft from Manaus and Belem, where 

international connections are available.  The area can also be reached by a one hour flight 

from Itaituba using the un-paved airstrip in the village of Morais de Almeida. 

BGC plans to base its operations in Novo Progresso as this town is much closer to the 

project. 

 Located 70km by paved tarmac road south of the project; 

 Town of 60,000 people capable of supplying manpower and services to the project; 

 Novo Progresso airport is currently being upgraded with a longer and wider tarmac 

runway; 

 Commercial daily flights from Belem and Alto Floresta; 

 Hydro-electric transmission line from Novo Progresso supplies power to the project; and  

 Rapidly improving infrastructure. 

5.2 Physiography and Climate 

The climate is tropical with an annual rainfall of around 2,000mm and seasonal variations with 

a drier period between July and November and a wetter period between December and May.  

The average annual temperature is approximately 27.5ºC with minimal month to month 

variations. 

The topography is gently rolling with elevations of 150m to 400m above mean sea level.  

Vegetation varies from tropical rainforest, with the project area located within farmland. 

5.3 Local Infrastructure and Services 

São Jorge is an exploration camp comprising: 

 Housing facilities for 40 persons (exploration and drilling crews); 

 Kitchen and mess hall; 

 Office with phone and internet;

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 Core storage and logging facility; 

 Hydro-electric and generator power. 

A core shed has been constructed to house all the drillcore from the project.  The São Jorge 

exploration site is connected to the regional power line from the locality of Novo Progresso 

with emergency backup supplied by diesel generators.  However, as reported in Coffey 

(2011), the power line will require upgrading to 138 kV capacity along with a local substation 

at the plant site. 

A skilled work force and labour are mainly sourced from Novo Progresso located 70km to the 

south.  Fuel, food and service companies are located in Novo Progresso. 

A small open pit and 2 small leach pads remain from the previous garimpo operation that was 

in place in early 2000. 

The local economy consists mainly of cattle ranching, logging and small scale mining.

Gold is reported to have been first discovered in the Tapajos region in the 18thcentury.  

Significant production has been recorded since the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 

1980s, when the BR 163 (Cuiaba - Santarém road) was opened.  A gold rush started in the 

Tapajos region with thousands of garimpeiros entering the region that was until then totally 

isolated.  Production from the region apparently peaked between 1983 and 1989, with as 

many as 300,000 garimpeiros reportedly extracting somewhere between 500,000oz and 1Moz 

per year, predominantly based on alluvial gold.  Up until 1993, production was officially

estimated at 7Moz, but real production is unknown.  Production has since declined, reaching 

an average of 160,000oz of gold per year in the late 1990s. 

São Jorge is located in the eastern part of the so called "Tapajos Gold District".  São Jorge 

garimpo mining reportedly commenced in the 1970s.  There are no published records to 

support the timing or amount of production.  The exploration of the São Jorge area was 

initiated by Rio Tinto Desenvolvimento Minerais Ltda ("RTDM"), a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Plc 

Mineral Group, in 1993.  At that time the São Jorge garimpeiro workings (Wilton Pit), was 

approximately 30m in diameter.  Following sampling in this small open pit, RTDM applied for 

four exploration licences in order to acquire the bedrock mining rights.  Additionally they 

negotiated an agreement with the landowner Wilton Amorim, which enabled them to initiate 

exploration on the property. 

The RTDM exploration program involved a 300m line spacing airborne magnetic survey, 

200m by 200m soil sampling grid around the São Jorge garimpo workings, 202 auger holes 

totalling 1,868m (drilled on a 50m by 20m grid with infill 8m by 8m), trenching with channel 

sampling (total of 1,071 samples collected in 16 trenches), detailed geological mapping to 

define the geological and structural framework, and 26 diamond drillholes for a total of 

4,350.3m. 

In 1997, as part of a scoping study, RTDM estimated a non-compliant NI43-101 mineral 

resource for the São Jorge Property, and completed an additional 16 diamond drillhole 

program to test conclusions of the scoping study (see Section 6.3 below). 

In March 1998, Altoro Gold Corp. (Altoro) negotiated an agreement on the property with 

RTDM and reviewed all data by check sampling of drillholes and surface sampling at the 

garimpeiro pit.  However, due to a merger with Solitario Resources Corporation, no further 

work was completed on the property.  In early 2003, RTDM relinquished the four São Jorge 

exploration licenses. 

From 2001 to 2005, garimpeiro operations were undertaken by Tapajós Mineração Ltda 

(TML).  These operations included small heap leach pads using cyanide solutions to recover 

gold.  Production by TML is reported at 15,000t of ore per month grading 0.3 to 0.7g/t of gold.  

Harron (2004) reported an estimated production of "approximately 1,500 oz of gold per year." 

After garimpeiro operations ceased on the property, a pit of approximately 400m long, 80m 

wide and 20 to 30m deep had been excavated over the Wilton Pit area. 

On July 16, 2004 Talon acquired from Centaurus a 100% interest in the São Jorge exploration 

licenses and in April 2005 entered into an agreement with Jaguar Resources Limited 

acquiring a 100% interest in the three adjacent claims. 

On 14 June, 2010 BGC acquired from Talon a 100% interest in the São Jorge exploration 

licenses.  BGC initiated a new exploration program in early 2011 consisting of soil sampling, 

geophysics and core drilling.  The conclusions from the program are published in this report.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

6.1.1 Resource History 

In 1997, RTDM reported a saprolite resource of 3.2Mt at a grade of 1.31g/t gold and a fresh 

rock resource of 33Mt at a grade of 1.49g/t gold.  This historical resource estimate was 

classified as "potential resources" and did not comply with current NI 43-101 guidelines.  

Coffey Mining has not reviewed this resource estimate and methodology as only the reference 

of the results has been located in historical technical reports, and it has been superseded by 

subsequent resource estimates. 

In 2006, SRK Consulting Inc. (SRK) completed a NI43-101 compliant mineral resource 

estimation for Talon (formerly BrazMin Corp) which is filed on SEDAR.  Although this report 

was relevant and compliant at the time of preparation, it should not be relied upon as it is no 

longer current.  Comment is provided here purely to present historical background. 

In 2008, Coffey Mining released a NI43-101 compliant mineral resource estimation for Talon 

which is filed on SEDAR. 

In 2010, Coffey Mining released a NI43-101 compliant mineral resource estimation for BGC 

which is filed on SEDAR. 

In 2011, Coffey Mining released a NI43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessments for 

BGC (Brazilian Gold Corporation) which is filed on SEDAR. 

6.1.2 Production History 

Harron (2004) reported a non-official garimpo production for São Jorge Gold Project of 

approximately 1,500oz of gold per year between 2001 and 2005.  No official records are 

available for the Garimpo operation that had existed at São Jorge.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The São Jorge Gold Project is located within the Tapajós District (Figure 7.1_1) situated in the 

south-central portion of the Amazon Craton.  The Amazon craton became tectonically stable 

at the end of the Late Proterozoic period.  The Craton is generally divided into the Guyana 

Shield north of the Amazon River and the Brazil Shield south of the Amazon River.  The 

provinces have a northwest trend across the shields.  The Brazil Shield has, as its nucleus, 

the Archean granitoid - greenstone terranes of the Carajás-Imataca Province in the east.  The 

structural provinces become younger towards the west and are dominantly granitic rocks of 

Paleoproterozoic age.  There is a general agreement that in this region, initial oblique collision 

tectonism was associated with crustal shortening linked to subduction and or accretion of 

magmatic arcs and early continental nucleation. 

The main units that forms the basement of the Tapajós Gold Province are the 

Paleoproterozoic Cuiú-Cuiú Metamorphic Suite (2.0 to 2.4Ga old), and the Jacareacanga 

Metamorphic Suite, also of possible Paleoproterozoic age (>2.1Ga).  The Cuiú-Cuiú Suite 

comprises gneisses, migmatites, granitoid rocks and amphibolites.  The Jacareacanga Suite 

comprises a supra-crustal sedimentary-volcanic sequence, which has been deformed and 

metamorphosed to greenschistfacies.  Both Suites are intruded by granitoids of the Parauari 

Intrusive Suite consisting of a monzodiorite dated at 1.9 to 2.0Ga.  These form the basement 

of the extensive felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks of the Iriri Group, dated at 1.87 to 

1.89Ga, including co-magmatic and anorogenic plutons of the Maloquinha Suite with intrusive 

events dated at 1.8 to 1.9Ga.  The Iriri- Maloquinha igneous event is associated with a strong 

extensional period.  Regional structural analysis in the Tapajós area has identified important 

lineaments that trend mainly northwest to southeast with a less well defined transverse east to 

west set. 

The primary gold mineralization in the Tapajos region is related to: 

 Lode like mesothermal orogenic gold deposits, in the context of quartz veins in shear 
zones with local hydrothermal alteration in the context of  the basement rocks, and 

 Stockwork and disseminated gold with a more pervasive hydrothermal alteration in the 
context of the granitic and volcanic rocks, similar to porphyry and epithermal styles of 
mineralization. 

The São Jorge gold deposit is related to the east extension of the regional 450km long northwest-
southeast Cuiú-Cuiú - Tocantinzinho lineament which also hosts several important gold deposits 
including the Palito mine, Tocantinzinho deposit and Cuiú-Cuiú, Bom Jardim and Batalha gold  
prospects (Figure 7.1_1).

Regional Geology Map 

 

7.2 Project Geology 

The São Jorge property is covered by a granitoid pluton dominantly composed of an 

amphibole-biotite monzogranite (Figure 7.2_1).  In the past, this pluton was interpreted to 

comprise one granitoid series, however geological research completed by the Federal 

University of Pará (UFPA) indicates that the pluton is heterogeneous and is comprised of two 

main granitoid series including: 

 Older São Jorge granite - massive granites and granite porphyries composed of 

amphibolite, biotite monzogranite to quartz monzogranite rocks and biotite 

leucomonzogranites to syenogranite rocks, massive, displaying only local, non-

penetrative foliation; 

 Younger São Jorge granite - massive granites composed of biotite leuco-monzogranite 

and syenogranites occurring as circular shaped bodies, with locally brecciated foliation 

indicating brittle-ductile deformation as in the vicinity of gold mineralization. 

The São Jorge granites frequently include 5 to 10cm long, oval-shaped mafic enclaves.  They 

also display local rapakivi texture characterized by sparse crystals of K-feldspar mantled by 

plagioclase.

contribution of hornblende, biotite and magnetite, a prefix of hornblende or biotite may be 

added to the rock name. The 'original' unaltered composition is typified by that of the 3rd 

sample (Figure 7.2.1_1 from Pedley, 2011). 

Figure 7.2.1_1 

Typical São Jorge lithologies. 

 

 

The Figure 7.2.1_1 shows typical São Jorge lithologies; from top to bottom they are 

monzogranite with large orange/pink microcline crystals, 35% plagioclase (largely altered to 

sericite), 20% quartz; granodiorite comprised of 35% quartz, 30% plagioclase, 15% microcline 

and 15% chlorite (reddish colouration is due to fine hematite within plagioclase); and very 

weakly altered hornblende monzogranite comprised of 20% quartz, 30% plagioclase, 20% 

microcline, 18% hornblende, 6% biotite and 1 % chlorite. This sample is most representative 

of the original rock composition (Pedley, 2011). 

The São Jorge granites are mostly medium grained and equigranular but where potassic 

alteration is advanced, microcline crystals up to 100mm size may give the rock a coarse 

porphyritic texture. A small percentage (<0.5%) of the rock mass is comprised of fine grained 

aplites which are pink/orange K-feldspar rich, cross-cutting and up to three metres thick. A 

small amount of leuco-granite is present in some boreholes; comprised mainly of K-feldspar, 

possibly as a result of pervasive potassic alteration. Where intensely sheared, the granite 

composition and texture is unrecognisable and the lithology is best described as a low-grade 

metamorphic granite or meta-granite (Pedley, 2011).

7.2.2 Alteration minerals 

The main variable in the São Jorge lithology is alteration. The main visible alteration types 

are: 

 Sericitisation of plagioclase 

 Chloritisation of hornblende and biotite 

 Microclinisation (potassic) alteration of plagioclase 

 Epidotisation of mafics and as a sassauritisation product within plagioclase 

 Hematite development probably after magnetite 

 Carbonatisation. Although widespread (in small quantities of 0 to 4%) it is difficult to 

recognise in core samples and has not been used in the classification of assemblages. 

In addition to the above is the development of new quartz (silicification) (Pedley, 2011). 

7.2.3 Alteration assemblages 

The intensity of alteration and the relative proportions of the main alteration minerals is 

variable and changes are typically gradational, but five alteration assemblages have been 

recognised as those which can be identified relatively easily in core and importantly, 

correlated between boreholes. The alteration minerals, in probable order of 

genesis/advancement, reflecting change from potassic to phyllic alteration, are: 

Fe-oxide→ chlorite→ microcline and epidote→ sericite and quartz 

The alteration assemblages of São Jorge rocks are illustrated in Figures 7.2.3_1 to 7.2.3_5.

Figure 7.2.3_1 illustrates the pale grey hornblende-magnetite monzogranite, sometimes with 

clusters of biotite and magnetite, in this case totally unaltered. Crystals are typically euhedral.

B. Fe-oxide +/- chlorite alteration (Fe-Ox-chl zone) 

 

Figure 7.2.3_2 

Fe-oxide +/- chlorite alteration (Fe-Ox-chl zone) 

 

 

Figure 7.2.3_2illustrates the Fe-oxide +/- chlorite assemblage, in this case very little chlorite 

present (hornblende remains largely unaltered). 

Hematite formation within feldspar crystals gives this alteration type a distinct reddish 

colouration. Chlorite typically forms veins and patches. Hornblende is partially/largely 

preserved. Crystals are euhedral to subhedral. Primary magnetite is largely replaced. Widely 

spaced narrow (<0.2m) mineralised zones of quartz-sericite alteration may be present. With 

increasing pervasive alteration this zone grades into the K-feldspar – epidote – chlorite zone, 

or; with a greater frequency of fracture controlled alteration/mineralisation may be classified 

as the heterogeneous ore type.

C. K-feldspar – epidote– chlorite alteration (K-feld – ep – chl zone) 

Figure 7.2.3_3 

K-feldspar – epidote– chlorite alteration 

 

 

Figure 7.2.3_3illustrates the K-feld – ep – chl zone. It presents large K-feldspar crystals and 

visible chlorite veins. 

Sericite comprises less than 4-5% of the rock. Increased alteration is present, notably 

microclinisation forming overgrowths and new large K feldspar crystals. Microcline crystals 

may reach 100mm or more. Plagioclase takes on a light greenish appearance due to 

replacement by epidote. New quartz is not as abundant as it is in the mixed assemblage. 

Chlorite is abundant forming veins and aggregates, and with increasing alteration this 

assemblage grades into:

D. Sericite – K-feldspar – chlorite – epidote alteration (mixed zone) 

Figure 7.2.3_4 

Sericite – K-feldspar – chlorite – epidote alteration 

 

 

Figure 7.2.3_4illustrates the mixed zone, in this case sericite is present in relatively small 

amounts (15%). 

Sericite is an essential component of this assemblage, and epidote and K-feldspar are always 

present in varying amounts. A distinguishing criteria of this assemblage is that the alteration is 

pervasive. There is some variation in the relative proportion of sericite which may comprise 

between 5 and 50% by volume; largely reflecting the intensity of the alteration. With 

increasing intensity the epidote and K-feldspar component is reduced, replaced by a sericite-

quartz assemblage; it may be possible to subdivide the assemblage based upon the amount 

of sericite and epidote present. 

Typically this alteration assemblage has a greenish/grey patchy or 'marbled' appearance. 

Original crystal forms are largely/entirely destroyed though less intensely altered varieties 

exist. New quartz is common, probably after K-feldspar (Pedley, 2011).  It is distinct in core 

and provides a useful 'marker' for correlation. 

E. Heterogenous (variable) zone 

The importance of this assemblage was recognised midway through the re-logging exercise; 

on some sections it may be incorrectly logged as Fe-Ox +/- chl or K-feldspar-epidote-chlorite 

assemblage. It is typified by weak to moderately altered rock of these assemblages but with

small (10mm to 0.5m) altered zones with quartz,sericite, epidote and appears to be fracture 

controlled as opposed to pervasive. 

Figure 7.2.3_5 

Heterogenous (variable) zone alteration 

 

 

Figure 7.2.3_5 illustrates the heterogeneous (variable) zone alteration. In this picture there are 

several small zones of intense sericite-quartz alteration separated by sections of weak Fe-Ox 

+/- chl alteration. This heterogeneous appearance is typical of this mineralisation type. 

7.2.4 Alteration Intensity 

Alteration intensity is logged using a scale of 0 to 3: 

0 - none or very minor alteration 

1 - weak alteration 

2 - moderate to strong alteration 

3 - intensely altered.

As is illustrated in Figure 7.3_4, mineralisation is best developed within the central portions of 

the deposit, typically associated with sericite (phyllic alteration): 

 within the mixed zone, as disseminations and semi-massive accumulations. Sulfide is 

more abundant in the mixed zone than in any other assemblage but gold mineralisation 

appears to be equally well developed within the less pervasively altered heterogeneous 

zone.  

 within numerous small fracture controlled altered and mineralised concentrations within 

the heterogeneous and Fe-Ox +/- chlorite zones (Figure 7.3_4). This style of 

mineralisation is typically within sulfide veins up to 100 mm thick and is more likely to 

contain chalcopyrite than the other mineralisation styles. Some of the best grade 

intersections are within this fracture controlled ore-type.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The São Jorge mineral deposit is a post-tectonic granite intrusion related gold deposit.  The 

origin of gold mineralization is thought to be related to late stage volatile enriched intrusive 

phases controlled by extensional tectonics in the context of a regional lineament. 

Analogous deposits associated with granitic intrusives in the Amazonia craton are the multi-

million ounce Omai gold deposit in Guyana (Goldfarb et al 2001) and the Tocantinzinho gold 

deposit owned by Eldorado Gold, located approximately 80km northwest from the São Jorge 

property along the same regional lineament (Figure 7.2_1).

9 EXPLORATION 

BGC has finalized the exploration programs on the São Jorge project and the database 
generated up to 2011 is reported in this Technical Report. 

Talon (operating under Brazmin) commissioned MPH Consulting Limited ("MPH") to review 

and rebuild the RTDM geophysical database comprised of processed IP data.  In a memo 

dated March 2004, MPH identified 3 conductors at São Jorge in the vicinity of the Wilton Pit 

and the Wilton West Areas.  The strongest conductor (Zone 1) corresponds to the 

mineralization associated with the Wilton Pit and extending along a northwest-southeast trend 

from 656,600mE to 6,568,300mE.  MPH also identified a conductor (Zone 2) that appears to 

trend west from Zone 1 at 656,800mE, and a conductor south of and sub-parallel to Zone 1 

(Zone 3). 

In July 2006, an airborne magnetic and radiometric survey was carried out by Fugro with a 

total of 2,284 line kilometres completed (with line spacing between 100 to 400m).  The 

preliminary interpretation identified major northwest-southeast trends.  At the same time, a 

28.55 line kilometre ground IP and 33.26 line kilometre ground magnetometer survey was 

completed covering the Wilton Pit. 

In 2011, BGC completed 14,708m of drilling and infill sampling of historic drill core, over 120 

line km of soil geochemistry and geophysics (IP) across and along strike of the São Jorge 

deposit (Figure 9_2). This work has outlined a significant IP anomaly southeast and along 

strike of the deposit that has a similar geophysical signature to the São Jorge deposit, i.e. high 

resistivity and moderate to high chargeability. The high resistivity likely represents silica 

alteration and the moderate to high chargeability disseminated sulfides, both directly 

correlated to gold content. Figure 9_2 shows that the IP target with soil geochemistry extends 

for 2.5km south of the deposit and represents a sizeable target for future exploration.

10 DRILLING 

BGC in 2011 completed a diamond drilling program (14,708m in 37 holes) at the São Jorge 

Gold Project to test the continuity of mineralization 100m below previous intercepts (0 masl) 

and infill along strike where previous drilling was widely spaced.  The results of this drilling are 

now available and have been incorporated with the previous drilling and were used in the 

resource estimate that is the focus of this report. 

Diamond drilling has been completed at the São Jorge Gold Project, as summarized in Table 

10_1 below.

Data collection can be subdivided into three distinct periods: The first period relates to data 

collected by RTDM.  The second period relates to data collected under work programs 

managed by Talon and a third period by BGC.  As such, further comments are directly 

attributed to each company. 

Data collection methods applied by BGC and Talon have been reviewed by Coffey Mining 

and, as such, have been directly assessed.  Drilling completed by RTDM was undertaken 

prior to Coffey Mining involvement so no detailed review has been undertaken.

deposit and topographic contours, Figure 10_2 presents drillhole positions (in red) and deposit

10.1 RTD Drilling 

Diamond drilling undertaken by RTDM was comprised of an initial phase of 10 drillholes 

comprising FSJ-01 to FSJ-10 for a total of about 1,700m with the deepest drillhole penetrating 

150m below surface.  These holes were inclined at 50º to 55º.  All core drilled was BQ 

(36.5mm) diameter.  The second phase of drilling by RTDM comprised 16 drillholes (FSJ-11 

to FSJ-26) for a total of approximately 2,690m.  Drillholes were drilled with a 50º to 55º 

inclination with a north or south azimuth.  Five drillholes were drilled at an azimuth ranging 

from 20º degrees to 35º degrees, approximately perpendicular to the deposit strike.  Core 

drilled during this campaign was HQ (63.5mm) and NQ (47.6mm) in diameter.  Details of 

RTDM drilling procedures were reviewed by Harron (2006).  Down hole surveys were not 

completed for RTDM holes and possible deviation may have occurred but verification of this 

deviation is not possible. 

10.2 Talon Drilling 

In 2005 Talon completed a Phase I diamond drilling program with a total of 10,104m from 48 

drillholes completed, mainly targeting the Wilton Zone. 

From May to September 2006, Talon conducted a Phase II drilling program with a total of 34 

drillholes completed for 7,952m.  From this phase, 8 drillholes for 2,302m targeted an in-fill 

program at the Wilton pit, and another 5,650m tested prospective targets.  Two new 

extensions, the "Kite zone" located northwest, and the "Wilton East zone', located east of the 

pit, were defined. 

Drilling was contracted to Geoserv Pesquisas Geologicas SA of Rio de Janeiro, a subsidiary 

of Boart Longyear.  Drilling equipment used on the project included two Diakore and one 

Longyear 38 drilling rigs.  Overburden, laterite and saprolite rock was drilled using HQ core 

equipment.  Unweathered rock was drilled with NQ diameter core. 

The majority of drillholes over the Wilton Pit area were drilled with a north or south azimuth 

and inclined about 55º.  Talon drilled 5 vertical drillholes and some drillholes with northeast 

and southwest orientations to test for sub-horizontal and oblique structures in the deposit. 

The Talon drilling procedures include: 

 Storage of all core in wooden core boxes at drill site; 

 Twice daily collection of core from drill site; 

 Storage of core in secure corrugated metal and wood core shed; 

 Run markers with metal tags indicating drilled depth; 

 Measurement and recording of core recovery for each drilling run; 

 Photography of core before splitting; 

 Measurement of RQD, and magnetic susceptibility for part of the drillholes;

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 Detailed logging of alteration, lithology, structures and sulfides. 

Collar coordinates are based on the UTM coordinate SAD69, UTM zone 21S.  Talon holes 

were surveyed by the drilling contractor using a Sperry Sun multi shot tool and later a reflex 

single shot tool.  Initially holes were surveyed at 3m intervals and then with a better 

knowledge of drillhole deviations, variably from 40 to 90m intervals.  Several holes were 

oriented using the downhole "spear" technique.  Drill collar coordinates are recorded using a 

differential GPS system by Terra Engineering based in Novo Progresso, Pará state. 

10.3 BGC Drilling 

BGC had drilled about 14,708 metres in 37 drillholes from January to December 2011. All of 

this data, along with the historic drill hole information, supports the updated mineral resource 

presented in this report. BGC implemented the exploration program keeping the same 

procedures and philosophy as Talon. 

The Figure 10.3_1 shows a drill rig operating on the São Jorge Gold Project site in 2011.

10.3.1 Density Determinations 

BGC has taken a total of 1,099 measurements of density on core using the immersion in 

water method. 

This method is commonly used to determine the Density (Specific Gravity) in the mining 

industry. The immersion method for obtaining specific gravity on the basis of displaced water 

volume (weight) is extremely simple and straightforward, and requires only two 

determinations: the weight of the completely water-immersed sample and its oven dry weight 

(in air). The specific gravity (SG) of the samples was calculated by substitution in the formula:

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

The density used in the resource estimation was discussed and agreed during the site visit 

and is summarized in Table 10.3.1_1.

Pedley, 2011, tested variation in density for each type of alteration zone. These results are 

presented in Table 10.3.1_2.  As can be observed; there is no significant variation of density 

between the different alteration assemblages.

Average Specific Gravity of all monzogranite samples with grades <0.3 g/t Au is 2.69 

The average Specific Gravity of all monzogranite samples with grades ≥0.3 g/t Au is 2.72. 

Coffey Mining concurs that the method to determine the Density was in accordance with 

mining industry best practices. 

10.4 Drilling Results and Quality 

Core recovery data for RTDM holes was not available for review.  Harron (2006) indicates that 

RTDM drilling had an overall core recovery greater than 95% with the exception of the 

transition from saprolite to fresh rock. 

Talon drillhole core recovery averaged 99% with a minimum recovery of 68% for one drilling 

run.  Coffey Mining inspected 4 representative drillholes and noted that all had excellent 

recovery.

BGC drill core recovery averaged 99.3%; the mineralized hosted rock is very competent thus 

providing a good drill core recovery.  

Significant drill results have not been individually reported as this is a resource estimate and 

would involve an extensive table that is summarised in the resource section of this report 

(Section 14.2 and Figure 14.2_1).  Generally drilling was orientated north-south and the holes 

inclined to the north or south.  These drill intersections were all significant and included in the 

resource estimation process as discussed in Section 14; the nature of the mineralization has 

been described in section 9. 

Coffey Mining considers the drilling procedures to be of an acceptable industry standard, in 

accordance with the best practices.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

BGC has undertaken new exploration activities at São Jorge in 2011 for which the results are 

released in this document. BGC geologists supervised all core sampling undertaken and 

collected samples at 2m or 3m lengths for most of the sampling.  Talon and RTDM collected 

core samples between 0.5m and 1.5m intervals based on the geological logging of rock types, 

geological controls and observed mineralization consistent with the mineralization model 

discussed in Section 9. 

BGC, as Coffey Mining had recommended, sampled historic core not previously sampled 

between the higher grade intervals. This contributed to an improved model and estimate 

confidence.  The gold mineralization in São Jorge is very subtle with no clearly defined visible 

geological controls. 

Coffey Mining has reviewed and verified the exploration data from the 2011 exploration 

program that is included in this document. 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

The sample preparation and analysis of core samples completed by RTDM were discussed by 

Harron, 2004. 

Sample preparation and analysis of core samples taken by Talon were performed by SGS 

Lakefield-Geosol Ltda. ("Geosol"), an ISO 9000-2001 certified laboratory.  Sample preparation 

procedures completed by the Geosol preparation laboratories based in Parauapebas and 

Itaituba were: 

 Drying and weighting of whole sample; 

 Crushing of sample to -2mm; 

 Sample homogenization and splitting to a 1kg sub-sample; 

 Pulverization to 95% passing -150 mesh; 

 Splitting of pulverized material to 50 gram pulp. 

Sample pulps were air freighted to the Geosol analytical laboratory in Belo Horizonte, Minas 

Gerais State Brazil.  Sample pulps were analysed for gold using a lead flux fire assay 

technique with an atomic absorption finish.  Selected samples were subsequently sent for 

silver, lead, zinc analysis by ICP spectrometry using a multi-acid digestion technique.  

Abnormally high assays were re-analysed by the laboratory.  The detection limit of gold 

assays was 5ppb Au.  Coarse rejects from the Parauapebas and Itaituba laboratories were 

sent to the São Jorge exploration office and stored in the core shed.  Fifty gram pulp rejects 

were also stored in the Talon offices in Rio de Janeiro. 

Sample preparation and analysis of core samples taken by BGC, for the 2011 / 2012 

campaign were performed by Acme Laboratories.

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  75 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Acme Labs performed each procedure for sample preparation and analysis, as follows: 

 Crush split and pulverize 500g drill core to 200 mesh 

 Fire Assay fusion Au by ICP-ES on 50g charges 

Coffey Mining has reviewed and verified the procedures for sample preparation and analysis  

from the 2011 / 2012 exploration program as described here, and concurs they are in 

accordance with mining industry best practices. 

11.2 Sample Security 

Core is stored in a locked and secure core shed.  After logging, core samples are marked for 

splitting and sampling by BGC geologists.  Core sample intervals are measured and collected 

by BGC technical staff.  Each core sample is placed in a doubled plastic bag and with two 

sample tags.  Each bag is closed with a uniquely numbered plastic seal that is tamper proof.  

Seal numbers, sample numbers and sample intervals are recorded by BGC.  Sample bags 

are collected for shipping in rice bags with each rice bag closed with a numbered plastic seal.  

Samples are stored in the BGC core shed until transported by truck to the Acme preparation 

laboratories in Itaituba in Pará state.  The referred laboratory is 320km by road from the São 

Jorge project.  After samples are received by the lab, seal numbers and sample numbers are 

reported to BGC for confirmation. 

Coffey Mining considers the core sampling security to be above current industry best practice. 

11.3 Adequacy of Procedures 

The current analytical method is appropriate.  Sufficient quality control data exists to allow 

thorough review of the analytical performance of samples taken by BGC. 

Quality control data from the RTDM period is not available for analysis as it has not been 

located. 

The sampling methods, chain of custody procedures, and analytical techniques are all 

considered appropriate and are compatible with accepted industry standards although the 

sample preparation of gold should be reviewed in light of the QAQC analysis in the following 

section.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Geological Database 

Coffey Mining had validated the BGC database for São Jorge Gold Project using the Gemcom 

Surpac Software System Database Audit tool with no inconsistencies noted. 

A comparison of hardcopy assay and geological logging versus the digital database was 

performed on a total of 10% of the BGC São Jorge Gold Project drillholes.  No errors were 

identified with the original log and the digital database. 

12.2 QAQC 

12.2.1 RTDM Drill Samples 

Coffey Mining has not been able to verify the RTDM drill sample QAQC data as it has not 

been located. 

12.2.2 Talon Drill Samples 

Talon set in place a QAQC programme that included the submission of blanks, field 

duplicates, standards and pulp duplicates with ALS (Umpire assays). 

This quality control data of drilling used in the resource estimation has been assessed 

statistically using a number of comparative analyses for each dataset.  The objectives of these 

analyses was to determine relative precision and accuracy levels between various sets of 

assay pairs and the quantum of relative error.  The results of the statistical analyses are 

presented as summary plots, which include the following: 

 Thompson and Howarth Plot, showing the mean relative percentage error of grouped 

assay pairs across the entire grade range, used to visualize precision levels by 

comparing against given control lines. 

 Rank % HARD Plot, which ranks all assay pairs in terms of precision levels measured as 

half of the absolute relative difference from the mean of the assay pairs (% HARD), 

used to visualize relative precision levels and to determine the percentage of the assay 

pairs population occurring at a certain precision level. 

 Mean vs % HARD Plot, used as another way of illustrating relative precision levels by 

showing the range of % HARD over the grade range. 

 Mean vs %HRD Plot is similar to the above, but the sign is retained, thus allowing 

negative or positive differences to be computed.  This plot gives an overall impression 

of precision and also shows whether or not there is significant bias between the assay 

pairs by illustrating the mean percent half relative difference between the assay pairs 

(mean % HRD).

 Correlation Plot is a simple plot of the value of assay 1 against assay 2.  This plot allows 

an overall visualisation of precision and bias over selected grade ranges.  Correlation 

coefficients are also used. 

 Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot is a means where the marginal distributions of two datasets 

can be compared.  Similar distributions should be noted if the data is unbiased. 

 Standard Control Plot shows the assay results of a particular reference standard over 

time.  The results can be compared to the expected value, and the ±10% precision lines 

are also plotted, providing a good indication of both precision and accuracy over time. 

Au Standards 

Talon used a total of 20 Au standards (inserted by the SGS- Geosol sample preparation 

laboratory at a rate of 1 in every 20 samples).  The standards were supplied by the SGS-

Geosol Parauapebas and Itaituba sample preparation laboratories.  The standards supplied 

and inserted by SGS-Geosol are a combination of internal and commercial standards.  As the 

SGS made standards may not be as reliable as commercially available certified standards, 

and do not represent external control (as SGS-Geosol know the expected result of these 

standards). 

In general the standard assay result indicated acceptable accuracy was being achieved, with 

the majority of standards falling within 90% of the Standard Tolerance Values (Table 12.2.2_1).  

The minor outliers identified are potentially associated with sample submission errors (mixing of 

samples). 

All standards were analysed using the Coffey Mining's QC Assure statistical software, with an 

example of the summary figures produced below in Table12.2.2_1. 

Blanks 

Coffey Mining performed an analysis on blanks data provided by Talon.  The blank material 

was sourced by Talon from unmineralized São Jorge Granites collected at one specific site at 

the project and submitted at a frequency of about five percent.  

Overall the blank data is within acceptable limits.  The results are presented in Table12.2.2_1 

below. 

Field Duplicates 

Talon completed field duplicate assaying ¼ of the NQ sized core at a frequency of 5% (1 in 20 

samples).  The procedure was to split the NQ sized core in half then ¼ the half core.  Coffey 

Mining considers this practice to not be representative as it does not represent the normal ½ 

NQ core submitted and creates a bias in the sample size submitted.  The results are 

presented in Figure 12.2.2_2 below. 

Based on the analysis, Coffey Mining can conclude: 

 A good precision was achieved for 81.81% of the data within 20% HARD.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 No apparent bias exists represented by both samples returning a similar mean value. 

 In summary the analysis of the 1/4 sized core has poor precision with no apparent bias 

present.  It is clear that for this ¼ NQ size of sample (which doesn't represent the ½ NQ 

size taken) that there is a significant nugget effect resulting in low precision results.

12.2.3 BGC Drill Samples 

Coffey Mining confirmed BGC sampling procedures are in accordance with mining industry 

best practices. All procedures were summarized in this section as demonstrated by BGC´s 

geosciences team.  

Coarse Reject Duplicate Sampling 

When an original sample is made into a smaller sub- sample, it is crushed and split then 

pulverised and split again. The final sub-sample is never exactly the same grade as the 

original. The coarse duplicates measure this error.  

 A coarse reject sample (returned from the lab) is split into two equal halves (CDA and 

CDB) ideally using a clean riffle-splitter. If a riffle-splitter is not available a good cone-

and-quarter split is acceptable. The duplicates (CDA and CDB) are inserted at every 

44th and 46th number in the sampling sequence. 

 The coarse reject samples were chosen to grade between 0.3 and 1.0 g/t Au. 

 ¼ core samples are not duplicates and they are not used as duplicates because it is 

expected to indicate the short range variability of the mineralisation (in the case of gold 

it is normally high). 

Blank Samples 

Contamination can occur in a lab especially with gold as it sticks to the equipment. A blank 

sample tests if contamination has occurred due to inadequate clean out of equipment 

between samples; it should return an Au value of less than 2x the detection limit. 

 BGC blank material consists of coarse crushed aggregate from the "Geraldo Mineiro" 

Granite quarry which contains less than 0.005 ppm Au. 

 Insert 2 blanks within/after mineralisation per 100 samples and a blank as the first 

sample of each batch. 

Standard Samples 

Standards are the best way to measure the instrument or analytical error and are inserted by 

the mining company. 

BGC used low, medium and high grade standards. The standard samples are pre-packaged 

as 50g sachets purchased from Rocklab. 

The analytical results for the Blanks and Standard samples are presented in Table12.2.2_1. 

Sample dispatch and sample logs 

BGC sent the samples as each batch was ready. The team confirmed that they followed the 

procedures as described below: 

 Do not submit a batch with less than 80 samples and a batch should never mix projects.

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  81 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 The senior technician must prepare the sample submission sheet and the laboratory 

requisition form, and email to the laboratory before the samples arrive at the lab. The 

document for the lab should only be a list of the sample numbers, security tags and 

volume numbers (there must be nothing to indicate which samples is a QAQC 

samples). 

 The complete sample sheet (showing QAQC samples) should be emailed to the Senior 

Geologist and the Database Manager as soon as the samples have been dispatched. 

 The senior technician must keep an organised digital and paper directory of all the 

sampling information.

12.3 Data Quality Summary 

The standards data has shown a high accuracy as returned by the SGS Geosol laboratory 

although it is noted that SGS supplied the standards to Talon. 

The standards data returned by Acme Labs shows relatively good accuracy and is suitable for 

resource estimation. 

The field duplicate data determined by the analysis of the ¼ NQ core returned relatively poor 

precision suggesting a significant nugget effect although not changing the actual mean of the 

samples.  It also suggests that the sample size is too small.  This ¼ sized core is considered 

by Coffey Mining to not be a suitable practice in that it does not represent the ½ NQ core 

normally analysed and has the potential to introduce a sample size bias. 

All data was detailed in Appendix B.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 

The São Jorge project has been explored for some years with the primary focus on defining 

the in situ resource.  A limited amount of metallurgical sampling and analysis has been 

conducted since 2006, with the latest work completed early in 2013.   

Coffey has compiled the results of all prior testwork and studied the outcomes of the tests to 

derive a metallurgical design that will enable maximum gold recovery with a minimum impact 

on the local environment. The derivation of the process flow diagram and the plant designed 

to recover the gold are detailed in this section. 

13.2 Metallurgical Testing Phase 1 (2006) 

In 2006, SGS was commissioned to undertake metallurgical tests. Test work was performed 

on three carefully composed drill core samples from the São Jorge gold project, of high, 

medium and low grade samples. The gold head grades of samples SJ MET-01, SJ MET-02 

and SJ MET-03 were 6.5g/t, 1.8g/t and 0.6g/t Au respectively. Coffey Mining has reviewed the 

test work results and judges them to have been completed to industry standards. 

SGS performed a comprehensive mineralogical and analytical approach of sample SJ MET-

01, including fire assay, heavy liquid separation, super-panning, ore microscopy, and electron 

microprobe. Results showed that the gold was present mainly in its native form with the native 

gold content ranging from 74.6% to 95.5% of the total gold occurrence. In terms of liberation, 

gold occurred as liberated particles, particles associated with pyrite and particles associated 

with non-sulfides. The grain size ranged from 1μm to 212μm, with the majority of grains below 

50μm. 

The gold balance shows that liberated gold accounted for approximately 17% of the head 

grade, with the majority of gold grains being less than 50μm in size. Approximately 62% and 

13% of the gold was associated with pyrite and pyrite/non-sulfide binaries, respectively.  Test 

work showed this gold can be recovered by flotation, followed by cyanidation. Gold attached 

to pyrite can be recovered by direct cyanidation. To extract gold locked in pyrite, however, 

finer grinding will be required. 

The Bond ball mill work index of a composite of the three samples was determined to be 

16.8kWh/t (metric) in a test using a 150 mesh closing screen. 

The recovery of gold by gravity separation ranged from 33% to 43%. Gold extraction by CIL 

from the gravity separation tailing ranged from 97% from the highest grade sample to 86% 

from the lowest grade sample, resulting in overall gold recoveries by gravity separation and 

CIL ranging from 98% (SJ MET-01) to 91% (SJ MET-03). The cyanide consumption was low 

at 0.1 to 0.3kg/t NaCN. Test results of the recovery of gold from the gravity separation tailing 

by flotation ranged from 94% to 98%.

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  85 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Overall gold recoveries by gravity separation and flotation were 96% to 99%. Further 

upgrading and/or subsequent treatment would be required after flotation which could lead to 

some additional loss of gold. 

The São Jorge samples responded well to the conventional gold recovery processes tested. 

A summary of test work results is shown in the Tables 13.2_1 to 13.2_4 and Figures 13.2_1 to 

13.2_3 below.

Several basic metallurgical tests were carried out on the master composite sample in order to 

reaffirm the conceptual flow sheet that was selected for the 2011 PEA. The test work focused 

on estimating reagent consumption rates, metal recovery, grind size and leaching kinetics. 

Results from the test work program were then used to determine a preliminary operating and 

capital cost estimates for the process plant and associated infrastructure. 

The test work program was designed to obtain metallurgical information that is required in 

order to develop the most appropriate flow sheet for the deposit. The test work comprised 

chemical analysis on head samples, size by size distribution, leaching of the individual size 

fractions in order to establish leaching kinetics and gravity test work. Leaching was conducted 

on both gravity concentration tails and non-gravity tails with and without the addition of 

activated carbon. Finally, the effects on recovery with variation in cyanide addition rates were 

examined. Refer to Appendix 1 which contains the metallurgical report generated by Testwork 

Desenvolvimento de Processo Ltda on the head sample identified as MET-01. 

13.3.1 Sample Selection and Location 

Samples were selected from 9 bore holes covering a strike length of 600 m over a vertical 

depth of 60 to 350 m below surface in the main portion of the São Jorge deposit. The samples 

are the remainder of the original 3.5 to 4.0 kilogram core samples submitted for assays. A 

selection of 30 samples with a grade of between 0.5 and 1.5 g/t Au were taken. A weighted 

average grade calculated for the 30 samples was made. From the 30 samples selected, 

samples were added and removed until a representative combination of 18 samples with an 

average grade of close to 1.0 g/t Au was defined. All samples were crushed to P80 = 1.68 mm 

and composited into a single representative sample from which a number of 1 kg sub-samples 

were taken for leach and gravity recovery testwork. The mean calculated head grade for the 

range of tests carried out was 0.78 g/t, well below the diluted resource grade of 0.91 g/t as 

reported by the Preliminary Economic Assessment and NI-43-101 Technical report dated 

June 12, 2012. 

The mineral samples were delivered in bags that were labelled MET-01. This was the only 
sample that was used for the metallurgical test work program for this phase.  
 

13.3.2 Head Samples and Assays 

Four 1-kg sub-samples were selected at random, homogenized once more and divided into 
six 500g samples and one 1-kg sample in order to perform: 
 

 Au analysis via fire assay on the six 500g samples; 
 Ag, S, Fe, Cu, As, Hg, CO3

2-, ICP multi-element, CTOTAL (total carbon) analyses on the 
one, 1-kg sample. 

 

Assay results obtained from the head sample MET 01 analysis are listed in Table 13.3.2_1.

If a gold nugget effect exists, then metallic screening will need to be performed.  This was 

partially simulated in the Granulometric test work on a sample screened and each size 

fraction individually leached with cyanide.  The grades for the individual screens ranged from 

0.63 g/t Au to 1.44 g/t Au.  The highest grade reported in the plus 150 micron fraction. 

13.3.3 Granulometric Test Work 

A 3kg sample was crushed to P80 = 125 µm, dried and separated into size fractions of +100, 

+115, +150, +200, +325 and -325 mesh.  

These fractions were leached and both the solids and the solutions were analysed to verify 

gold distribution by fraction. Results can be seen in the Table 13.3.3_1.

The recovery of gold per fraction varied between 90.6% and 74.4%, with an average of 81.8%. 

The recalculated concentration of gold per fraction varied between 1.44 and 0.63g/t, having a 

head concentration of 0.91g/t. The gold assays for the screen fractions varied from 0.63 g/t Au 

to 1.44 g/t Au in the coarsest fraction.  This suggests that there is either nugget effect or 

encapsulation of gold in complexes such as pyrite  

 From the results obtained a grind versus recovery curve was derived.  The total gold recovery 

can be determined based on the summation of the grams of gold recovered passing a certain 
screen fraction divided by the summation of the grams of gold from the assayed head passing 

that same screen fraction.  The graph in Figure 13.3.3_1 indicates that the recovery increases 
for the finer fractions (0 is actually minus 45 micron).

13.3.5 Gravity Concentration Test Work 

The test was conducted to determine the GRG (Gravity Recoverable Gold) according to the 

Knelson procedure for small quantities of ore. 

A 10kg sample was crushed into three different granulometric fractions (P80 = 212, P80 = 106 

and P80 = 75 µm), and at each increment of crushing the ore was passed through the Knelson 

MD3 concentrator to recover the free coarse gold. See Figure 13.3.4_1.

From the results contained in Table 13.3.6_1, it is concluded that it will not be necessary to 

pre-dose this particular ore with lime as it was not necessary to add lime to adjust the pH. 

 

13.3.7 Kinetic Curves for Leaching Without Gravity Concentration 

The leach kinetic curves were conducted individually for different values of P80 (106 and 75 

µm).  For each assay, a 1.2kg sample was taken from the mill feed, ground to the desired P80 

size, dried, homogenized and sampled into six 200g sub-samples that were then individually 

leached during various pre-determined time periods. 

Test conditions are defined below: 

 With and without the addition of activated carbon to the pulp; 
 P80 = 75 and 106 µm; 
 Without pre-dosing the ore with lime; 
 pH adjusted to between 10-11; 
 50% solids; 
 Total residence time of 32 hours; 
 Leaching kinetics (recovery of gold as a function of time) – Collection of aliquots (gold, 

cyanide, pH) at 2, 6, 10, 20, 24 and 32 hours; and 

 Cyanide concentration – 1000 mg/L.   

 
It is not entirely understood why a carbon-in-leach test was performed other than perhaps to 

demonstrate that a CIL circuit may be beneficial for feasibility design.  The problem with this 

test is that some of the results showed high tailings gold grades which suggests that some 

carbon was still present in the tailings.  Screening of the solid tailings that includes carbon 

must be performed carefully to ensure that no carbon, which contains gold, reports to the 

tailings.  Such a result was reported in the 24 hours bottle roll test where the recovery was 

only 71.8%. Results are listed in the Table 13.3.7_1.

13.3.8 Kinetic Curves for Leaching With Gravity Concentration 

Gravity concentration on the sample was carried out prior to leaching in order to remove the 

maximum amount of free gold possible with the least amount of mass.  

The leach kinetic tests were conducted on individual tailing samples that were generated from 

the gravity tests having P80 values of 106 and 75 µm.  For each assay, a 1.2kg sample of 

gravity concentration tailings was sampled and sub-divided into six 200 g samples that were 

leached individually. 

Test conditions are defined below: 

 With and without the addition of activated carbon to the pulp; 
 P80 = 75 and 106 µm; 
 Without pre-dosing the ore with lime; 
 pH adjusted to between 10-11; 
 50% solids; 
 Total residence time of 32 hours; 
 Leaching kinetics (recovery of gold as a function of time) – Collection of aliquots (gold, 

cyanide, pH) at 2, 6, 10, 20, 24 and 32 hours; and 

 Cyanide concentration – 1000mg/L.   
 

Tables 13.3.8_1 and 13.3.8_2 indicated the result of the gravity test work on the different grind 

sizes prior to gravity separation.

Recovery rates for the samples that were subjected to gravity separation followed by leaching of 

the gravity tails have been adjusted to reflect possible overall recovery rates for the combined 

processes. In order to derive a final recovery it was estimated that a recovery rate of 98 % can be 

achieved when the gravity concentrate is subjected to leaching. This needs to be confirmed in the 

next phase of metallurgical testing. The results are listed in Table 13.3.8_4.

From the data obtained, it has been observed that a finer grind size of P80 75 microns results in 

higher gold recovery. When comparing overall recovery rates for samples ground to P80 75 

microns the recovery was similar regardless if the samples were subjected to gravity separation 

prior to leaching. A coarser grind size of P80 106 microns resulted in lower overall recoveries even 

when the samples were subjected to gravity separation prior to leaching. This is illustrated in 

Figure 13.3.8_1 below

When comparing the cyanide consumption for all tests that were conducted for this phase of 

work, the average consumption rate is in the range of 600 g/t. Further test work needs to be 

performed in order to establish optimum cyanide consumption rates.  

13.4 Additional Metallurgical Testing  

Additional bottle roll tests were conducted on left over samples from column leach tests. This 

work was conducted by Testwork Process Development Ltda for Brazilian Gold  Corporation, 

AusIMM registration number 304552, Report 002-2013 Brazilian Gold Rev 0 entitled, "Leaching 

tests with São Jorge Ore", dated January 2013. Refer to Appendix 2 which contains the 

metallurgical report generated by Testwork Desenvolvimento de Processo Ltda. 

A number of 24 hour bottle roll tests were carried out on both the oxide and sulfide ore in order to 

determine the effect of grind size on recovery and also to estimate a gold recovery value for the 

oxide ore. The tests were performed on material containing a slightly higher head grade for the 

sulfide ore than that used in earlier metallurgical test work. The samples were taken from left over 

material from earlier column tests and were identified as SJ-LCH-001, and SJ-LCH-002. 

The leaching tests were carried out in the following conditions: 

 Size:    P80 = 106 and 75 µm 

 Carbon: Without 

 % solids:  50% solids 

 pH:   10.5 to 11.0 

 Cyanide:  1000 ppm (initial) 

 Time:  24 hours 

 Sampling:  24 h (Au, pH and NaCN).

Initial results indicate that grind size has little effect on the oxide ore with both grind sizes 

achieving virtually the same average recovery rate of 88 %. The finer grind size on the sulfide ore 

resulted in an increase in recovery of 1.3 %. The oxide ore exhibited a lower gold recovery as 

compared to the sulfide ore which may indicate some sort of organic fouling during the leaching 

cycle thus leading to possible preg robbing of gold laden solution. This needs to be further 

examined in the next phase of test work. 

 

13.4.1 Column Tests 

Two column tests were performed on the São Jorge ore samples, one on the oxide ore and one 

on the sulfide ore in order to evaluate the potential for heap leaching of low grade material.  

Samples were received in plastics bags and were identified as SJ-LCH-001, and SJ-LCH-002.  

For the oxide ore, samples were selected from 8 drill holes and for the sulphide ore samples were 

selected from 9 drill holes all at different depths along the deposit. A total of 20 samples for the 

oxide and 23 samples for the sulphide with varying grades were composited using a weight 

average to generate the final master composite. 

The samples were crushed to 3/8", homogenized and divided into a 20 kg sub-sample which were 

then used in the column leaching tests. The rest of the sample was homogenized again and one 

head sample was taken for gold analysis from each of the two original samples, SJ-LCH-001 and 

SJ-LCH-002.  

The 20 kg sub-samples SJ-LCH-001 (oxidized material), and SJ-LCH-002 (sulfide material) were 

placed in two separate columns.  

To determine the gold grades in the head samples, three sub-samples of 500 g of each material 

(oxidized and sulfide) were sent for gold analysis. Tables 13.4.1_1 and 13.4.1_2 show the results.

The samples were leached in the following conditions: 

 Agglomeration with 500 g/t of cyanide and 1 kg/t of lime 
 Leaching solution – 500 mg/L of NaCN 
 pH – 10.5 

The cyanide solutions were prepared every day, no carbon adsorption was used. 

Total leach time was 30 days.  After that water was pumped through the column to wash the 

residual cyanide for 4 days.  The columns were than discharged, the samples were dried, 

crushed to 1/8" (3 mm), homogenized and sampled for gold analysis. 

A summary of the results is shown in the Table 13.4.1_3.

The testwork that has been completed, in conjunction with costing estimates, has resulted in the 

proposal of a fairly standard gold plant process flowsheet for precious metal recovery. Carbon-in-

Leach (CIL), an established gold recovery process, is included in the flowsheet while flotation and 

gravity separation are excluded, as available information currently indicates that high recoveries 

can be achieved by a combination of fine grinding (P80 of 75 microns) and leaching.  

The proposed flowsheet incorporates crushing, grinding, thickening, CIL and an Elution (ADR) 

circuit to produce gold bullion. In addition, a Counter Current Decantation (CCD) circuit is 

incorporated into the flow sheet for tailings management and cyanide recovery. 

A number of specific conclusions have been drawn from the results of tests conducted in 2006, 

2012 and 2013, as segmented and summarized below. 

Column Tests 

 Further column test work on the oxide material should be performed in order to test the 
technical and economic viability of heap leaching.  It is recommended that further leach tests 

be carried out using coarser feed material, i.e. P80 50 mm, P80 25mm and P80 13mm in order 

to establish optimum crush size. 

 Heap leach recoveries for both the oxide and sulfide material were 78.9 % and 53.0 %, 
respectively. 

 Cyanide consumption for the oxide was determined to be approximately 1.1 g/t while for the 
sulfide it was 1.2 g/t. Column leach tests do not accurately predict reagent consumption for 

full scale heap leach operations. Typical cyanide consumption for a heap leach operation 

would be 25 % to 40 % of the consumption predicted from column leach tests. Lime 

consumption predicted from column tests would also be higher than full scale operation. 

 Due to the nature of the Oxide ore which contributed to poor permeability during the initial 
column tests, further column tests incorporating cement in the agglomeration mix needs to 

be explored.  

 Column tests should be performed over a 60 day period in order to obtain leach cycle times, 
establish maximum recovery rates and generate leaching kinetic curves for  coarser crushed 

material.   

 Bottle roll test work on material ground to P80 1.7mm (10 mesh), P80 250 micron, P80 106 
micron and P80 75micron should be performed in order to establish ultimate recovery of the 

ore.   

 Moisture content of the heap leach ore should be determined before and after leaching in 
order to establish the amount of make- up water required. 

 Further column tests should be carried out using site water as opposed to tap water in order 
to determine the effects of site water on leach kinetics. 

 Percolation rates were measured to be 10 L/m2/h.

Gravity and Leach Testwork Sulfide & Oxide Ore Phase 2 

 The data reviewed suggests that collection of gold through gravity concentration is viable 
based on recovery, but not feasible based on the low concentrate grades reported.  It would 

have been beneficial to have performed gravity upgrading and/or leach tests on the first pass 

gravity concentrate in order to establish cyanide consumption rates and overall recoveries. 

 

 Gravity concentrate recoveries should be revised and stated with the grade of the 
concentrate produced. 

 

 The selection of the metallurgical sample needs to be verified in order to determine if the 
samples represents the deposit as it is currently defined. 

 

 The recoveries by granulometric fraction were between 74 % and 87 % for the finer fractions 
and 90.6 % for the coarser, 150 µm, fraction.  As the process of sieving classifies material 

exclusively with respect to size, this may indicate that part of the gold (coarse and liberated) 

has been retained in the mesh.    

 

 For met samples SJ-AL1-T1 which represents the sulfides and SJ-AL2-T2 which represents 
the oxides,  gold recovery for the finer ground  samples P80 75 microns ranged from 91.1 to 

95.8 % for the sulfides and between 86.1 to 91.2 % for the oxides. 

 

 For met samples SJ-AL1-T1 which represents the sulfide ore, gold recovery was increased 
from an average of 92.4 % to 93.7 % using a finer grind that is a P80 75 microns as 

compared to a P80 106 microns. 

 

  For met samples SJ-AL2-T2, which represents the oxide ore, the finer grind size did not 
affect recovery as both a grind size at P80 75 microns and of P80 106 microns resulted in the 

same recovery rates. 

 

 For met sample SJ-AL2-T2 low gold recoveries averaging 88 % may be attributed to organic 
fouling; 

 

 The GRG tests show how the gold is gradually liberated during the crushing process, and the 
results indicated that it was possible to attain a maximum gold recovery of 66% when the ore 

is crushed in stages to a P80 equalling 74 µm.  It should be noted that the material was 

initially ground to a P80 of 212 microns and then subjected to gravity concentration.  From the 

test results it was shown that an overall recovery of 36.5% with a gold grade of 38.91 g/t Au 

was achieved when the entire sample was ground to a P80 of 212 microns.  The gravity 

tailings were further ground to a particle size of P80 106 microns which then recovered an

additional 17.2% of the gold in relation to the feed grade.  The tailings from the second stage 

of concentrating were then ground to a particle size of P80 75 microns and returned a further 

gold recovery of 12.4%. The cumulative recoveries total 66 % recovery. As a result of the 

three stages of grinding, the final gravity recovery that was achieved could be overstated. 

 

 The tailings from the gravity concentration were subjected to leaching with and without 
carbon present.  It was observed that carbon reported to the solid residue which increased 

the reported tailings grade and reduced the gold recovery (24 hour test).  

 

 Gravity gold recovery reached 49.5 % and 40.7 % when the ore was crushed at P80 levels of 
106 µm and 75 µm, respectively. 

 

 For met sample MET -01, a grind size of P80 = 75 microns resulted in an overall recovery of 
92.1 % and was achieved without the use of gravity separation. With gravity separation gold 

recovery can be slightly increased to 93 %. At the coarser grind size of P80 = 106 microns 

overall recovery was slightly lower at 91.0 % with the aid of gravity separation. Overall 

recovery is a combination of gravity recovery and leaching. Further test work is 

recommended to validate the benefit of gravity separation. 

 

 As the testwork was performed on a lower grade material, it is expected that as the head 
grade is increased, so too will the recovery of gold. This can be seen in Figure 13.4.2_1

program. The results of this testwork would be inputted back into the block model in order to 

allow for metal extractions to be predicted across the deposit. 

 Future samples must be chosen to be representative of the ore that will be mined in the first 5 
years of the mine life. They should be selected by the Project Geologist in collaboration with 

the Lead Process Engineer and Mining Engineer.  

 The different lithologies along with the master composite for each deposit should be submitted 
for head analysis. Elements for analysis would include gold, silver, copper, sulphur and iron. 

 A representative sample from each lithology along with the master composites for the deposit 
should be submitted for mineralogical examination in order to obtain bulk modal analyses data 

and liberation data. Also QEMSCAN analysis should be performed on the final tails from the 

deposits in order to better understand the mineral composition within the ore body thus 

indicating how metallurgical performance may be affected. 

 The next phase of the program requires more comminution data such as;   Modified Bond ball 
mill work index tests, several full Bond ball mill work index determinations, Bond rod mill work 

index, crushing work index, abrasion work index, Unconfined Compression tests (UCS), SAG 

Mill Comminution tests (SMC) and JKTech drop weight tests in order to properly size the 

comminution circuit. 

 On the master composite for the sulfide ore, a HPGR (high pressure grinding rolls) evaluation 
should be considered as an option to SAG milling. This would require a Static Pressure Test 

(SPT) to be performed. 

 A series of flotation tests should be considered on both ore types in order to establish if 
flotation would be an appropriate flowsheet option in order to optimize gold recovery.  

 Further gravity tests should be carried out on both ore types at various grinds in order to 
confirm original findings. 

 Leaching of the gravity concentrate should be carried out in order to determine overall 
recovery rates and establish leach kinetic curves along with reagent consumptions. 

 Leach kinetic curves need to be established on master composite samples for both the oxide 
and sulfide ore.   

 Once optimum conditions have been established with the master composites, further bench 
tests should be performed on the variability samples using the same set of conditions. 

 Once optimum conditions have been established from bench tests, locked-cycle testing and 
potentially a pilot plant trial should be conducted in order to confirm initial findings.  

 Reagent optimization for both ore types needs to be established.

 Settling tests on the tailings for both ores types are required. This would involve appropriate 
flocculent selection (ionic, cationic, neutral, coagulant) settling test work (feed percent solids, 

dosage, pH), specific gravity determination and viscosity measurements on tailings, with and 

without thickening.   

 As the deposit consists of approximately 15 % oxide (laterite and saprolite) material and 85 % 
sulfide material the next phase of test work needs to include both gravity and leach test work 

on a composite sample that represents this ratio in order to determine what effect a blended 

ore has on recovery, if any, as this may be a possible process route. 

 Further testing needs to be carried out on the oxide material as it may be processed 
separately for the first 18 months of production. This would include the same testwork that has 

been carried out on the sulfides. 

 Testwork involving thickening of the leach tails is recommended for the next phase of work for 
both oxide and sulfide material in order to establish maximum obtainable densities for the 

CCD circuit. 

 The ore rheology needs to be well defined and understood to thwart any potential viscosity 
issues which may arise from the processing of the oxides alone. 

 Environmental testwork, as it relates to the processing plant and tailings storage facility is 
required.

14 MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATE 

14.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining has estimated the Mineral Resource for the São Jorge Gold Project as at 17th 

September 2012 and amended on 7th December 2012.  All grade estimation was completed using 

Multiple Indicator Kriging ('MIK') for gold.  This estimation approach was considered appropriate 

based on a review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of available data, the 

interpreted controls on mineralization, and the style of mineralization.  The estimation was 

constrained by a wireframe that separated altered mineralized rock from unaltered rock. 

The resource estimate was amended because Coffey Mining identified a grade variance between 

the resource published with Effective Date 17 September 2012 and the block model which was 

imported for engineering studies for a new Preliminary Economic Assessment. Coffey Mining's 

standard procedure when importing a block model into the mine design software includes internal 

verification of the block model data. Coffey Mining has completed a thorough and detailed 

investigation and has confirmed that the data in the block model is correct. Further "independent 

verification" was completed by a Coffey Mining office outside of Toronto, not associated with the 

São Jorge study, and proficient in the commercial software used for the resource estimate. This 

work has confirmed the variance and the resulting positive grade revisions to the São Jorge 

resource estimate. 

14.2 Geological Modelling 

Previous resource estimates for São Jorge did not use a geological model; simple grade shells 

were used to control the estimation.  

BGC geologists mapped alteration 'assemblages' to define meaningful zones that could be 

correlated between drill holes and sections. Alteration intensity, sulfide percentage and gold 

grade data are also helpful, particularly in areas of uncertainly (Pedley, 2011). 

Coffey Mining has modelled an envelope based upon BGC geologists' geological model (Figure 

14.2_1).  The interpretation was completed using 27 vertical sections oriented as shown in Figure 

14.2_2.  The interpretation and wireframe models have been developed using the Gemcom 

Surpac mine planning software package. 

For the purpose of resource estimation, one mineralized domain was interpreted and was 

modelled around all alteration zones.  The domain is depicted in plan and section in Figure 

14.2_2 and Figure 14.2_3.  As the mineralization is very diffuse, internal waste intervals were 

accepted within the mineralized domain.  There are no non-sampled intervals; every interval was 

sampled for the estimation process.

An oxidation domain was defined based on the contact of the weathered rock (oxide) with the 

fresh rock (sulfide) using codes defined in the geological description table of the database.  This 

domain was built using an intersection between the surface weathering DTM created using the 

contacts points.  The Figure 14.2_3 shows the oxidation example.

14.3 Block Model Development 

A three-dimensional block model was constructed for the São Jorge Gold Project, covering all the 

interpreted mineralization zones and including suitable additional waste material to allow later pit 

optimisation studies.  The block model has been developed using Gemcom Surpac software. 

A block size of 5mE x 5mN x 5mRL has been used for all materials without sub-blocking.  The 

attributes coded into the block models included mineralization, grade and weathering.  A visual 

review of the wireframe solids and the block model indicates robust flagging of the block model.  

Bulk density has been coded to the block model based on the defined density values listed in 

Table10.3_1. 

Table 14.3_1shows the summary of the block model created.

14.4 Statistical Analysis 

The drillhole database was composited to a 1m downhole composite interval, recording the 

geological model.  The 1m composites were used for all statistical, geostatistical and grade 

estimation studies.  The decision to use 1m composites was based on the sample lengths in the 

database, considering the samples inside the zone estimated and reported in this document. 

Figures 14.4_1 and 14.4_2 illustrate the predominant sample lengths for oxide and sulfide rock 

respectively.

Statistical analysis of the composite datasets was completed on the 2 domains (oxide and 

sulfide).  The element included in the composite database is Au (grams per tonne).  Descriptive 

statistics are presented in Table14.4_1.

Indicator classes have been defined for the single mineralized domain.  The conditional statistics 

for the mineralized domain to be estimated by Multiple Indicator Kriging are listed in Table 14.4_2. 

Multiple Indicator Kriging estimates the cumulative grade distribution frequency rather than the 

grades itself for each block, then it uses the interclass means of grade to estimate the median 

grade inside the block. 

Multiple Indicator Kriging works on a probabilistic basis to define the distribution of the grades of 

samples within each search window, providing a discrete approximation to the conditional 

cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for each block.  As this distribution is based on the 

samples found within the search window centred on any given point, it changes from block to 

block to reflect local grade variability.

14.5 Variography 

14.5.1 Introduction 

Variography is used to describe the spatial variability or correlation of an attribute (gold, silver, 

etc).  The spatial variability is traditionally measured by means of a variogram, which is generated 

by determining the averaged squared difference of data points at a nominated distance (h), or lag 

(Srivastava and Isaacs, 1989).  The averaged squared difference (variogram or γ(h)) for each lag 

distance is plotted on a bivariate plot, where the X-axis is the lag distance and the Y-axis 

represents the average squared differences (γ(h)) for the nominated lag distance. 

Several types of variogram calculations are employed to determine the directions of the continuity 

of the mineralization: 

 Traditional variograms are calculated from the raw assay values. 

 Log-transformed variography involves a logarithmic transformation of the assay data. 

 Gaussian variograms are based on the results after declustering and a transformation to a 
Normal distribution. 

 Pairwise-relative variograms attempt to 'normalise' the variogram by dividing the variogram 
value for each pair by their squared mean value. 

 Correlograms are 'standardized' by the variance calculated from the sample values that 
contribute to each lag. 

Fan variography involves the graphical representation of spatial trends by calculating a range of 

variograms in a selected plane and contouring the variogram values.  The result is a contour map 

of the grade continuity within the domain. 

The variography was calculated and modelled in the mining planning software, Gemcom Surpac 

Software.  The rotations are tabulated as input into Gemcom Surpac Software (geological 

convention), with X representing the bearing, Y representing dip and Z representing plunge.  Dip 

and dip direction of major, semi-major and minor axes of continuity are also referred to in the text. 

14.5.2 São Jorge Variography 

Grade and indicator variography was generated to enable grade estimation via MIK and change 

of support analysis to be completed.  Nine indicator thresholds (Table 14.5_1) were investigated 

for the mineralized domain.  Interpreted anisotropy directions correspond well with the modelled 

geology and overall geometry of the interpreted domain.  This interpretation appears to cross-cut 

the trend of the interpreted alteration envelopes, while being contained within them.  

Extensive variogram modelling was done, before deciding on the final variogram attitude.  This  

was selected close to the secondary behaviour found in the attitude of the altered zones.

Meanwhile the global bearing of the mineralised domain is seen to be aligned with the direction 

N115°, and a secondary alignment is roughly east-west (Figure 14.5.2_1).

nominated cutoff or threshold, is assigned a value of 1, with those below the nominated 

indicator threshold being assigned a value of 0.  The indicator estimates, with a range 

between 0 and 1, represent the probability the point will exceed the indicator cutoff grade.  

The probability of the points exceeding a cutoff can also be considered broadly equivalent to 

the proportion of a nominated block that will exceed the nominated cutoff grade. 

The estimation of a complete series of indicator cutoffs allows the reconstitution of the local 

histogram or conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for the estimated point.  Based 

on the ccdf, local or block properties, such as the block mean and proportion (tonnes) above 

or below a nominated cutoff grade can be investigated. 

14.7 Multiple Indicator Kriging Parameters 

MIK estimates were completed for relevant domains using the indicator variogram models 

(Section 14.5), and a set of ancillary parameters controlling the source and selection of 

composite data.  The sample search parameters were defined based on the variography and 

the data spacing.  A total of 9 indicator thresholds were estimated for oxide and sulfide 

mineralised domains (see Table 14.5_1). 

The sample search parameters are provided in Table14.7_1.  Soft boundaries were used in all 

estimation passes.  The specific effect of this is to allow samples lying within the sulfide grade 

domain to be used for the estimation of the oxide domain and vice versa.  This strategy allows 

adequate estimation in areas where the estimation domains are adjacent to each other which 

might otherwise remain unestimated in any given estimation pass due to a lack of available 

composites in the search neighbourhood..  A three-pass estimation strategy was applied to 

each domain, applying progressively expanded and less restrictive sample searches to 

successive estimation passes, and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate.

 Comparison of the MIK CCDF estimate versus the CCDF of the composite dataset, 

including weighting where appropriate to account for data clustering. 

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans. 

 The comparison of the distribution of gold grades in the block model and the composite 

dataset, confirming the same distribution, and honouring the first law of resources 

estimation. 

The Figures 14.7_1 and 14.7_2 present these comparisons. 

 "Part_Samp" represents the cumulative distribution of samples 

 "Au Avg" samples are the gold grade for each cutoff grade  

 "part_Blk" represents the cumulative distribution for all mineralised blocks 

 "Au Avg BLK" are the gold grades for each cutoff grade in all blocks

14.8 Resource Reporting 

The summarised Amended Resource Statement in Table 14.8_3 has been determined with 

an Effective Date of 17th September 2012 and has been prepared and reported in accordance 

with Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the 

Instrument) and the classifications adopted by CIM Council in December 2010.  

The definitions of resources established by CIM are as follows: 

 A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 

material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, 

coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of 

such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The 

location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral 

Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and 

knowledge. 

 An "Inferred Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 

grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 

sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. 

The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 

drill holes. 

 An "Indicated Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a 

level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability 

of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological 

and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

 A "Measured Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established 

that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 

application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and 

evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed 

and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate 

techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that 

are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

This resource estimate has been classified as Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources 

based on the confidence of the input data, geological interpretation, and grade estimation.

In recognition of a significant improvement in the three year trailing average gold price since 

the resource declaration in the report dated September July 2010, and consistent with the 

PEA dated July 2011, in this report Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources are reported at 

a cut-off grade of 0.3g/t Au.   

The cutoff grade value estimated by Coffey Mining is based on economic, process recovery, 

government taxes, etc. and represents total revenue value in grams per tonnes that is 

explained as the sum of process cost + mining costs plus G&A + other costs divided by price 

(US$) per 1 ounce (31.1035g) and multiplied by process recovery. These results are shown in 

the Table 14.8_1.

A summary of the estimated resources for the São Jorge Gold Project is provided in Tables 

14.8_3 to 14.8_5 below.  The resource was classified to the -200mRL.  Material below -

200mRL was considered too far from data and shows atypical grade distribution as a result 

and remains unclassified. The notable difference in grade between indicated and inferred 

mean grades can be explained by lack of drilling and variability of the gold mineralisation.  It 

can be expected that with additional drilling the average grade of the Inferred Mineral 

resource will increase as higher grade zones are intersected.  This grade increase may be 

partly at the expense of tonnage.

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Introduction and Overview  

The São Jorge Mine has been designed as an open pit operation.  The base case operational 
model assumes that all waste stripping and mining operations will be completed by a 
contractor.  The alternate option illustrated in detail in this report is an Owner-operated mine.  
The significant difference between these two options is that capital costs for contract mining 
are reduced by $49.4 million as compared to Owner-mining but operating costs increase 23% 
to $26.27/tonne versus $20.31/tonne for Owner mining.   
 
Mining at the São Jorge Project will be conducted in two phases.  The first is removal and 
processing of the oxidized (laterite and saprolite) and gold-mineralized layer above the main 
ore body, referred to as the oxide ore body.  The main ore body is a granite with sulfide 
mineralization that contains free milling gold.  This is referred to as the sulfide ore body.  
 
The mine will extract and process approximately 3.5 Mt of oxide ore in the first two years of 
operation. Subsequently the sulfide ore body mining will commence part way through the 
second year of operations and ramp up to 2.5 Mt per year for the next seven years and then 
taper off in the 10th year of operation.    
 
Pre-stripping of the sulfide ore body will commence in the first year of operation with 
approximately 10.6 Mt of waste laterite, saprolite and unweathered rock being removed.  Total 
barren material stripped during the life of mine will be 106.3 Mt.    The average stripping ratio 
for the life of mine is 4.90 : 1 but stripping ratios early in the mine life are higher to facilitate 
the exposure of mineralized material.   
 
The layout of the mine, mill, tailings basin and waste dump is illustrated in Figure 16.1_1

16.2 Mine Design Criteria 

The mine design and optimization were based on a block model prepared by Coffey in 
November 2012.  The block models were created using Gemcom Surpac and imported into 
MineSight™, a commercially available mine design application. The model was checked to 
ensure its validity and the integrity of the data.  The block sizes are 5 m 
(x-coordinate) x 5 m (y-coordinate) x 5 m (z-coordinate).  The in situ density used in the model 
for oxide ore is 2.64 t/m

3
  sulfide ore 2.72 t/m

3
 and waste rock 2.69 t/m

3
.  

 
Pit optimization was conducted by the pit optimizer algorithm Lerchs-Grossman 3-D ("LG 3-
D") with MineSight Economic Planner. The LG 3-D algorithm is based on the graph theory and 
calculates the net value of each block in the model based on mining costs, processing costs, 
processing recoveries, weighted recovery values, overall pit slope and searches for the pit 
shell which would deliver the highest undiscounted cash flow.  
 
For this Study, all blocks with resource classifications of Indicated and Inferred lying within the 
pit shell have been included in the economic calculations and in the pit optimization process. 
 

16.3 Pit Optimization 

The cost estimates used in the optimization were based on historical data, benchmarking of 
similar active mining operations in the region and Coffey data. The gold price for the Pit 
Optimization is based on a three year trailing average of $1,487/oz as of the end of October 
2012.  The break-even cut-off grade (COG) was used to classify the material within the pit 
limits as ore or waste. The cut-off grade used for the pit optimization was 0.30 g/t Au.  
 
The optimized pit slope was set at 57o as Coffey Mining has assumed stable geotechnical 
conditions at São Jorge based on the observed physical properties of the host rock (granite) 
with no notable faults or joints. This assumption is supported by the Garimpo pit previously 
excavated by Tapajós Mineração Ltda during 2001-2005, exhibiting an overall slope angle of 
60o. Additional site specific geotechnical data will need to be collected and analysed to 
confirm and refine this design parameter.  Additionally, the slope is, on average, a few 
degrees shallower than necessary for stability in order to allow for operational factors to be 
incorporated in the pit design such as safety berms and haulage ramps.

Using the technical and economic parameters described previously, the LG 3-D algorithm was 
run and produced an optimum pit shell for the São Jorge gold deposit.  The optimization also 
calculated the contained resources, recovery and theoretical stripping ratio.  The results of the 
pit optimizations for São Jorge deposit are shown in Table 16.4_1.

16.5 Engineered Pit Design and Results 

The preliminary mine design was conducted with the MineSightTM LG 3-D optimized pit shell 
as a base. Operational factors that are required for a mine were then incorporated into the 
optimized shell to yield an engineered pit shell. Features added were haulage ramps, safety 
berms, bench face angles, inter-ramp angles and bench heights.   
 
One constant bench face angle (BFA) and inter-ramp angle (IRA) was used for the pit designs 
in this study, due to the lack of geotechnical data for the different rock strata in the pit area. 
The design parameters for the engineered pit shell are shown in Table 16.5_1.

consecutive benches will be combined to yield a final high wall height of 30 m (triple benching) 
with an 8 m wide safety bench between the next 30 m high final bench.  This design feature 
was incorporated to maximize extraction of the sulfide ore body.  The 30 m final bench height 
was seen as practical due to the high rock quality data indicated for the main granitic rock 
body.  Additional geotechnical data is required to further substantiate this assumption and 
more detailed operational analysis in later studies may yield better alternatives. 
 
The width of the in-pit haulage ramps are designed at 23.5 m to accommodate uninterrupted 
two-lane traffic. The final few benches at the bottom of the pit are designed with a ramp width 
of 12 m, assuming single-lane ramp access in order to reduce the stripping ratio and 
maximize ore recovery. The ramp grades have been designed at a 10% slope.  
 

16.6 In Pit Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources for the engineered pit design are based on the parameters described 
previously. CIM Definition Standards – For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves require 
that for a Preliminary Economic Assessment, all material classified as Measured, Indicated or 
Inferred shall be reported as an in-pit resource. 
 
The in-pit mining resources were calculated for the engineered pit design at a cut-off grade of 
0.30 g/t Au. The mineable mineral resources estimated in the present pit are 21.7 Mt, with an 
average grade of 1.51 g/t. The total waste contained in the São Jorge pit is 106.4 Mt resulting 
in a total of approximately 128.1 Mt of material to be mined.  This results in an engineered 
stripping ratio of 4.90 : 1, 5% higher than that indicated in the pit optimization exercise. Table 
16.6_1 segments and summarizes the mineralized material and estimated gold yield 
contained within the designed pit shell.

The results of the optimized pit design and the engineered pit design are similar and compare 
well, verifying the general veracity of the results.

Two operational scenarios were evaluated for the Project.  The base case scenario has the 
mine being developed and operated by a contractor, engaged to complete all of the stripping 
and mining operations required for the life of mine. The second option considered was that the 
mine owner would purchase mining equipment and hire operating staff, with contractors being 
used only for support activities such as blasting, routine mobile equipment maintenance and 
employee transportation.   
 
Operational criteria for both options are identical, utilizing the same production and stripping 
schedules.  Operational costs for the contract mining scenario were provided by Brazilian 
Gold Corporation based on local knowledge.  Contract mining costs will vary for the saprolite, 
which is not expected to require blasting, and the fresh, or hard, rock. The weighted average 
contract mining costs are estimated to be US$3.11 per tonne of material (US$18.35/t ROM) 
and are utilized in the base case financial model for this scenario. Coffey has reviewed the 
cost assumptions for contract mining and found them to be reasonable.  Coffey has detailed 
the Owner operator mining scenario in detail to provide operational and cost details that can 
stand alone or be used as a check against tendered contract mining costs in due course.  
 
Mining activity in the first two years will focus primarily on the oxide ore body to maximize its 
extraction, minimize the mixing of the ore types due to potential operational challenges and to 
reduce costs to maximize early cash flow.  Once the oxide body is removed the mining of the 
sulfide ore body will be ramped up quickly to full production.  Stripping of waste rock will be 
minimized in the first two years also to enable a quicker repayment of invested capital, with 
care being taken to not jeopardize future ore mining rates. 
 
Figures 16.7_1 to 16.7_3 depict plan view sections at 10 m elevation intervals across the 
entire ore body that illustrate the transitional relationship between the oxide and sulfide ore 
bodies, with the oxides overlying the sulfides. Oxide ore is indicated in blue with sulfides in 
green and waste rock in red.

Table 16.7_1 details the tonnes of ore and waste mined by year based on the operational requirements of a production rate of 2.5 Mt/y of ore 
delivered to the mill.  It also illustrates the initial mining of the oxide ore body followed by pre-stripping to expose the sulfide ore body and then 
the ramp up to full sulfide production as the oxide ore is exhausted by the end of Year Two.  The stripping ratio tapers off in the latter years of 
the operation as the only waste to be moved is contained in the pit versus waste stripped to push the pit walls to their outer limit in earlier 
years.  The mine life is estimated at 9.5 years with the current parameters.  Mill production will commence late in the first half of the first 
operating year, reaching nameplate design capacity early in Year Two.

16.8 Waste and Overburden Dump 

Waste rock and overburden material mined from the São Jorge pit will be dumped at the 
northeast section of the property as indicated in Figure 16.1_1 (shown earlier).  The waste dump 
is located close to the pit to minimize truck cycle times.  The current anticipated dump location 
appears to be distal to any potential additional gold mineralization but condemnation drilling 
should be conducted prior to mining to confirm this assumption.  Additional land area is available 
on the property for dumps if the operation expands in the future. 
 
The maximum waste rock dump height is limited to 50 m above the natural surface of the land. 
This height was deemed adequate for the purpose of mine closure and rehabilitation. The ground 
conditions and assumed pit and waste rock dump design criteria need to be validated by 
additional geotechnical studies. The design parameters used for the waste dump are: 
 

 Face angle: 36° 
 Overall slope: 27o 
 Bench height: 10 m 
 Minimum berm width: 7.8 m 
 Maximum height: 50m 
 
Based on an average swell factor of 30%, the dump has been designed to accept an in excess of 
110.7 Mt. The designated dump footprint and profiles provide sufficient capacity for the waste 
rock generated over the LOM. Some waste material generated during the pre-production period 
may be used as construction aggregate, for haul road material at later stages of development or 
as an aggregate source for the surrounding roads and municipalities.  Geotechnical drilling will be 
required to verify the engineering properties of rock under the waste dump. 
 

16.9 Mine Operations  

Mining operations will be conducted 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 365 days per 
year with two 12 hour shifts per day on a rotating schedule.  
 
Initial mining will be of the soft, lateritic - saprolitic oxide ore body.  This material will be excavated 
without drilling and blasting.  Once this material is exhausted, in Year Two of the Project, drilled 
and blasted run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be delivered to a primary crusher located approximately 
750 m to the southwest of the pit.  
 
BGC has investigated mine contracting costs in Pará State and advises Coffey that experienced 
mine contracting firms of repute are readily available to provide turnkey mining services with the 
key deliverables being drilling and blasting services, delivery of ore to the crusher (or ROM pad), 
delivery of blasted waste rock to the waste pile, road and pit wall maintenance, dewatering, 
manpower, training, maintenance and supervision at contract prices segmented by rock type.  
Price estimates provided to Coffey are US$2.00/tonne for the mining of oxide (laterite and 
saprolite) material and US$3.25/tonne for fresh ore and waste rock.  These prices are subject to 
adjustment at time of tender but represent current pricing in the Brazilian market.

Requirements for primary mining equipment, consisting of drills, haul trucks, loaders and a 
shovel, have been estimated based on haul distance, expected equipment availability, utilization 
and overall productivity data. Availability profiles for major equipment have been estimated using 
vendor benchmarks, similar projects in the databases of Coffey as well as operating experience. 
 
The nominated truck fleet consists of Caterpillar 777F trucks, or equivalent, having a payload 
capacity of 90 metric tonnes. Up to 11 trucks will be required to support the mine plan and 
schedule. Operating truck requirements were determined using the appropriate operating time 
parameters, fill factors, cycle times, and tonnes to be moved per material type. The truck fleet size 
was calculated using the applicable equipment availability factor and was subsequently rounded 
upwards to the nearest truck. The calculated truck fleet size, on a yearly basis, was then 
smoothed out to better estimate and represent an actual operation.  
 
The proposed excavation fleet initially consists of one Caterpillar CAT992K hydraulic front-end 
wheel loader, or equivalent, and one Caterpillar 390D hydraulic track-mounted shovel, or 
equivalent. A second 992K loader is scheduled to be added in Year Two of the operation.  Annual 
excavation productivity was determined using the appropriate operating time parameters, fill 
factors, material properties, and bucket capacities. Ore loading will be conducted mainly by the 
hydraulic shovel and most waste loading will be assigned to the front end loaders. Early in the 
mine life, the hydraulic shovel will be assigned to waste removal to open up the main pit.  Due to 
the nature of the gold bearing material it is recommended that a smaller (up to 4.6 m3) bucket 
should be used on the shovel to improve material selectivity, maximizing mining recovery to 95% 
and reduce ore dilution. 
  
It is estimated that two diesel-powered track drills with a capacity to drill 6" diameter blast holes 
will be required (Atlas Copco PV235, or equivalent). Additionally, a reverse circulation drill 
(Sandvik DR500 series, or equivalent) should be used for grade control. This drill will perform the 
confirmatory grade control drilling and ore sampling ahead of the production drills. The reverse 
circulation drill would have the same drill hole diameter and the grade control drilling pattern 
would be merged with the production drill pattern. 
 
Routine road maintenance and various other functions within the mine will be accomplished with 
the following secondary equipment: 
 

 Track-Dozers: Two CAT D9, or equivalent, with rippers, used to maintain the waste dumps, 
ripping of saprolitic (oxide) material as well as perform the general earthwork and rockwork 
within the mine.  

 

 Wheel Dozer: One CAT 844, or equivalent to be used for road maintenance, blast hole 
stemming, face cleanup etc. The unit will be equipped with a quick-release coupling to 
allow easy change over from one attachment to another (dozer blade, bucket, forklift, etc).  

 
 Graders: One CAT 16M, or equivalent used to maintain roads on the entire mine site.

 Water Truck: One water truck with a capacity of 10,000 liters will be used for site dust 
abatement.  This truck can be locally sourced and be a converted fuel tanker. 

 
The site will require additional support equipment.  The complete list of primary, secondary and 
auxiliary equipment requirements on an annual basis, is presented in Table 16.9_1.

When mining of the fresh rock commences the mineralized rock and waste rock will be drilled and 
blasted using conventional techniques. Drilling will be conducted with common diesel-powered 
track-mounted drills. The explosives and blasting accessories will be supplied by an explosives 
supplier. Blast design is based on the use of 152 mm (6 inch) diameter blast holes, 10 m high 
working benches and the use of bulk ANFO in dry conditions and emulsion explosives in wet 
conditions. The projected powder factor for an assumed 5.0 m x 5.0 m pattern in ore grade 
mineralization and an assumed 6.0 m x 6.0 m pattern in the waste rock are 0.251 kg/t and 0.175 
kg/t, respectively. 
 
The preliminary selection of drilling equipment and drill pattern design takes into consideration the 
control of damage to final pit walls, minimization of blasting costs and control of material size and 
distribution. The pit design concept of triple benching and final design for pre-split and trim blast 
patterns, will be based on the results of geotechnical testing and assessment.  
 
A high energy bulk emulsion explosive, with an in-hole density of 1.25 g/cc, and electronic 
detonators should be investigated for application in wet or dry conditions. There are potential cost 
advantages and operational simplicity of using only one type of bulk explosive based on a 
reduction of explosive plant and requirement of trucks for product mixing. 
  
Drilling and blasting activities will be directed by mine operations personnel who will be 
responsible for the development of drilling and blasting procedures, drill site preparation and 
cleanup and supervision of the explosive provider. The explosive plant, including the supply and 
delivery of explosives and detonators into the blast hole through the mine life, will be outsourced. 
Table 16.10_1 presents the drilling and blasting design parameters used in this Study.

16.11 Fuel and Electricity 

 
An electrical power line will be constructed to the mine site during the pre-production phase. The 
mine electrical power distribution system would service the mine dewatering pumps and other 
support requirements. Electrical costs are estimated to be US$0.075/kWh for the purposes of the 
mining study but may be as low as US$0.058/kWh during the first three years of operation by 
offsetting the capital cost of $7.59 million to upgrade the existing power line to 138 kV capacity 
and installation of a substation at site (initial discussion with CELPA – Centrais Elétricas do 
Pará).. Potential savings may be achieved by purchasing power on the spot market as a result of 
several new hydroelectric power plants coming on stream and an abundance of power in Pará 
state.

Mining equipment fuel usage was based on the manufacturer's estimated benchmark data for 
each piece of equipment in the equipment list, expressed in L/h of unit operation. Electric power 
consumption was also estimated based on vendor data sheets for the required dewatering 
pumps. 

 

16.12 Mine Equipment Maintenance 

The base case of contract mining assigns the responsibility for equipment maintenance facilities, 

maintenance operations, overhaul and replacement to the contractor which costs are included in 

the contracting rates. 

For the Owner-mining alternative, mobile equipment maintenance has been estimated on the 

basis of parts and labour applied on a cost-per-operating hour basis.  Costs to maintain the 

equipment fleet are depicted in Section 21.  

16.13 Manpower Requirements 

Mining operations are planned on two 12 hour shifts per day, 7 days a week, 365 days per 
annum. Three hourly-paid crews would work a roster of 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, altering shifts on 
each turn around. Manpower requirements for the mine are presented in Table 16.13_1 and 
Table 16.13_2. At peak production the mine labour complement will total 187 hourly and salaried 
personnel.

16.14 Support Facilities and Services 

Mine support facilities would include a maintenance shop, warehouse, fuel and lubricant storage 
facilities, a fueling station, waste management facilities, maintenance office and backup 
generator. The mine maintenance shop would be responsible for maintaining all mining 
equipment and light vehicles. The mine would also have an employee locker room, offices for 
mine operations and technical services. The maintenance shop building would consist of 5 
service bays, offices, lunchroom and storage areas for tools and parts. Three bays will be 
required for trucks; one of the bays will be used for loaders, dozers and grader. One bay would be 
a wash bay. 
 
Various support services will be contracted to local vendors.  Examples are tire maintenance, 
crew transportation, crane rental, etc. These contract services are estimated to be approximately 
5% of mine operating costs. 
 

16.15  Summary and Recommendations 

 
The São Jorge mine will employ typical open pit mining methods for a mid-sized operation.  The 
current design and operating plans are based on the current block model and metallurgical data.  
Coffey recommends that the following additional tasks be completed as a part of later studies for 
the project: 
 

 Geotechnical work to verify rock quality data and rock mechanics data to assist in 

optimizing pit slope angles, bench heights, final bench heights and ultimate pit limits;   

 Geotechnical drilling will be required to verify design criteria for foundation rock under the 

proposed waste dump; and 

 Cost verification for operating and capital costs as well as detailed pricing of the base 

case mining contractor option through a firm quotation.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Philosophy 

Based on the testwork completed by BGC to date, the objective of the preliminary plant 

design is to minimise capital and operating costs and propose a flow sheet that is simple and 

capable of recovering the maximum amount of gold from the São Jorge deposit, initially from 

the processing of oxide ore then configured for sulfide ore processing.  

The current flowsheet design, which is based on processing a sulfide ore, incorporates 

crushing, semi-autogenous (SAG) and ball mill grinding to liberate the minerals, a carbon-in-

leach (CIL) circuit for leaching and metal recovery, an ADR plant for  the extraction of gold 

metal to  bullion and a counter-current decantation (CCD) circuit for tailings slurry thickening, 

handling and preparation for storage.  

Flotation and gravity gold recovery processing routes may offer potential advantages to the 

overall flowsheet design and recovery rates, however a lack of optimisation testwork 

precludes the viability of flotation and gravity separation at this stage. Metallurgical information 

obtained from testwork on Sample MET-01 was used to derive the plant design and layout.  

Testwork for a heap leach option was briefly explored by Coffey, although the metallurgical 

performance testing had been limited to a single column leach test on both an oxide and 

sulfide sample. The leach recovery rate for the sulfide sample was low, approximately 53 %, 

and subsequently a higher sulfide head grade has been reported for the new resource 

estimate (Coffey NI 43-101 Technical Report update, December 2012) for the sulfide. 

Therefore, at this stage, it was decided that if heap leaching was contemplated it would be 

carried out on the oxide material only as it responded well to heap leaching exhibited an 

overall recovery of 79% in the column test.  

Based on this premise, the  heap leach plant would  be designed to incorporate the oxide 

material only, in which the  design would include single stage crushing, agglomeration, 

stacking, heap leaching and ADR plant, based on a two-year mine life. The sulfide ore would 

be treated separately in a conventional CIL plant. The main purpose of the oxide heap leach 

would be to generate a positive cash flow in the initial years of the operation and to pay down 

some of the mechanical equipment costs which would be common for both the heap leach 

and CIL plants, such as the ADR plant and refinery. Both the ADR facility and refinery would 

be sized initially to meet the demand of the CIL plant which would come into production at the 

end of the oxide ore mine life. As the economics for the heap leach option have yet to be 

proven as viable and recovery rates inferior to conventional tank leaching it has been omitted 

from this report, however may be re-examined in future studies as further testwork is 

completed.    

The most recent metallurgical test program was conducted on a lower grade sample for both 
the oxide and sulfide samples as compared to the new resource estimate.  Testwork 
applicable to conventional leaching indicated a gold in oxide recovery of 88% and a gold in 
sulfide recovery rate of 93.7%.

Coffey and BGC have selected a conventional CIL plant for both oxide and sulfide material 
with a plan to selectively process the oxides before the sulfides. 

Coffey has drawn on the metallurgical testwork results combined with the current resource 
report to develop the input criteria for the São Jorge process flow diagram (PFD). A gold 
recovery rate of 93.7% with a 1.56 g/t head grade has been specified for the sulfide material 
while a recovery rate of 88 % with a head grade of 1.26 g/t for the oxides ore is specified. The 
recovery rates cited herein were derived from very limited metallurgical tests and further 
testwork is required to validate the test results. 

Preliminary metallurgical results do indicate that a finer grind can achieve slightly higher 
recovery rates for gold from sulfides while recovery rates from the oxides are largely 
unimproved by grinding to smaller grain sizes. Again, further metallurgical testwork is required 
to confirm the latest results obtained. 

The processing plant footprint is estimated to be ~ 30 000m2 for a plant site processing 2.5 
million tonnes per annum. 

17.2 Process Design Criteria and Plant Overview 

The flowsheet option proposed by Coffey Mining is based on metallurgical testwork work 

completed to date and, to some extent typical gold plant operations, to derive an estimate of 

plant capital costs within the accuracy specifications of a preliminary economic assessment 

(PEA).  The optimum process route may be established on completion of further testwork and 

during the feasibility phase of the project.  The cost of the processing facility for the purpose of 

this exercise is somewhat simplified in both the comminution and recovery aspects.   

For preliminary assessment process work, a treatment rate of 2,500,000 Mtpa has been 

considered by Coffey Mining. The study process design criteria are shown in Table 17.2_1.

The proposed flowsheet for processing both the sulfide and oxide ores includes: 
 

 Primary crushing;  
 SAG milling – when processing of sulfide ore only; 
 Ball milling – for both oxide and sulfide ore; 
 Thickening; 
 CIL; 
 Reagent handling and addition; 
 ADR – elution, carbon regeneration, electrowinning; 
 Calcining; 
 Smelting; 
 CCD; and  
 Tailings disposal 

 

Infrastructure requirements such as power and water are assumed to be available for the 

plant. Local power distribution for the project will be supplied via a new 138kV high voltage 

transmission line that must be constructed and will originate in Novo Progresso. 

Approximately 10.24 Megawatts of operating power is required for the processing of the 

sulfide-ore. The oxide-ore will require approximately 6.7 Megawatts of operating power. A 

pipeline may be required in order to supply fresh water to the project site. Water for industrial

and potable use is assumed to be drawn from the Jamanxim River, 9 km to the west of the 

project site or, if tests prove positive and permits are secured, water may be drawn from a 

man-made reservoir created on site by damming a creek, thus eliminating the pipeline capital 

cost.  For this study, the costs of the pipeline and the power line have been estimated and are 

captured in capital costs. 

The process plant will be constructed in two phases, the first being designed to treat the oxide 

ore for the first 18 months of operation. After Year 1 of operation, additions will be made to the 

oxide plant in order to treat the remaining sulfide material. These additions include the 

installation of a SAG mill for the grinding circuit, three additional CIL tanks with agitators for 

the leach circuit and a single high rate thickener for the CCD circuit. 

It is assumed that a jaw crusher can be used to crush the oxide ore and produce an 

appropriate feed size for the ball mill. It remains unclear and undefined at this stage the size 

and competency of the oxide ore the crusher will receive from the oxide deposit. This will 

need to be confirmed in the next phase of work. The oxide circuit will employ a ball mill only 

for grinding and will operate in a closed circuit with a hydrocyclone and screen to produce an 

overflow product with ~35% solids and a P80 of 75 microns, depending on further testwork. 

The cyclone fines product will be thickened to ~50% solids and treated in a CIL circuit for 

leaching and gold adsorption on activated carbon. Four CIL tanks will be required to process 

the oxides, representing a total residence time of approximately 14 hours. As no information 

was available for leaching kinetics on the oxide ore total residence time was estimated based 

on similar operations leaching saprolite oxide ore. 

For the sulfide circuit the jaw crusher will produce -150mm size material to be treated in the 

grinding circuit. The crushed product will be milled in a SAG-ball mill (SAB) configuration. The 

closed-circuit cyclone and screen configuration will remain in place with cyclone overflow 

reporting to the tank leaching circuit. For the sulfide ore, seven CIL tanks will be required for a 

total leach time of approximately 24 hours.  

CIL tails will be screened and pumped to a two-stage CCD circuit for the sulfide ore and a 

single CCD for the oxide ore in which the overflow from each CCD thickener will be pumped 

back to the process water pond for re-use in the plant while the underflow from the final CCD 

thickener will be pumped to the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) for disposal. Decanted water at 

the TSF will be recycled to the plant for re-use. 

The proposed flowsheet incorporates a 2.5 Mtpa crushing, grinding, CIL and ADR for recovery 

to produce gold bullion for refining and CCD for cyanide management. Flotation and gravity 

separation may have merit, pending adequate testwork in the next project phase however 

neither has been contemplated in this study. 

For the next phase of the study, work may continue on the engineering of the selected 

process plant to a level of detail commensurate with the costing accuracy required. This will 

include:-

17.3 Process Description  

17.3.1 Crushing Circuit 

ROM ore will be delivered by haul trucks and dumped either on the ROM pad or directly into the 

primary crusher feed hopper.   Critical to achieving optimum throughput in the mill will be 

management of the feed to the primary crusher to ensure a constant ore blend in the mill feed. 

ROM ore will be direct dumped from mine haulage truck (CAT 777 or equivalent, 90 metric 

tonnes).  A front end loader will be used as required to sustain the instantaneous crusher feed 

requirement.  

Ore will be fed onto a stationary grizzly screen located on top of the crusher feed hopper. The 

screen aperture is set at 800 mm for the sulfide ore. Oversize material will be broken using a rock 

breaker. 

A variable speed apron feeder will reclaim the ore from the hopper at a rate of 380 dry tonnes per 

hour (dtph) and discharge the ore onto a vibrating grizzly screen. The oversize material will 

discharge from the grizzly into the 1,200 mm by 1100 mm primary jaw crusher fitted with a 200 

kW drive. The undersize from the grizzly will discharge onto a transfer conveyor. The product 

from the jaw crusher will combine with the grizzly screen undersize material which will be 

conveyed to the primary ore stockpile which will have a live capacity of 12 hours.   The crushing 

circuit will be designed to operate 24 hours a day with a plant utilisation of 75%.  

In order to satisfy the environmental needs and reduce the dust to acceptable limits, conveyor 

skirtings at discharge points and dust suppression systems utilising atomised water sprays will be 

used at points identified as potentially high in dust generation. 

17.3.2 Grinding Circuit 

SAG Mill for the sulfide ore 

The coarse ore stockpile will provide crushed ore surge capacity so that the process plant SAG 

mill can be supplied with a continuous source of feed stock. 

The stockpile reclaim system will consist of two reclaim belt feeders, each with variable speed 

drive motors.  Reclaim belt feeders will be installed in line with the SAG feed conveyor, which will 

deliver the reclaimed ore to the SAG mill.   

Each feeder will have a maximum design capacity of 310 t/h.  The nominal feed rate to the SAG 

mill will be achieved with one of the two feeders operating at design capacity but they may be 

operated in unison to ensure a regular feed to the SAG mill and to compensate for segregation on 

the pile.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

A lime silo fitted with a bin activator and variable speed rotary valve will be used to dose quicklime 

onto the SAG mill feed conveyor.  A reverse pulse filter system will be used to collect lime dust 

generated at the transfer point and this dust will be returned to the conveyor. 

The grinding circuit will consist of a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill in open circuit followed 

by a ball mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones. 

The 6.4 m diameter x 3.00 m EGL (Effective Grinding Length) SAG mill will be fitted with a single 

2650 kW drive and will operate at a maximum 18% volumetric ball loading. Variable speed control 

of the mill, accomplished through a water-cooled liquid resistance starter, will provide flexibility for 

processing of the various ore types and blends.  A speed range of 65% to 78% of the critical 

speed will be available. 

The SAG mill slurry will discharge onto trommel screen for separation and dewatering of pebbles 

and steel scats.  A high pressure water spray system will wash agglomerated fine particles from 

the oversize material and keep the coarser size material in the mill for further grinding. The 

undersize product from the SAG trommel screen will discharge by gravity to the mill discharge 

hopper.  This hopper will also receive the discharge material from the ball mill. 

The SAG mill will not be installed into the circuit for the treatment of oxide ore as it is not required 

at this stage. The SAG mill will be installed and operational for milling of the sulfide ore. 

Ball Mill 

The 5.5 m diameter x 9.6 m EGL ball mill will be fitted with a single 5,200 kW drive and will 

operate up to 34% volumetric ball loading producing a product size of 80% passing 75 microns.   

The ball mill will operate in a closed circuit with a cluster of primary cyclones from which the 

overflow will feed the pre-leach thickener while the underflow will return by gravity to the mill 

discharge hopper. The discharge from the mill will pass through a trommel mounted on the mill 

trunnion to remove tramp metal.   

The discharge underflow product from the ball mill will combine with undersize product from the 

SAG mill in the mill discharge hopper.  The combined products of the SAG and ball mill, as well 

as additional process water, will be pumped to the cyclone cluster.   

Two ball bins, for delivery and storage of grinding balls will be located adjacent to the grinding 

mills, one for the SAG mill and one for ball mill.  The SAG ball bin will house 125 mm grinding 

balls, while the ball mill bin will house 80/50 mm grinding balls.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 An overhead crane will be employed in order to service the grinding and cyclone classification 

area.  The crane will also handle the movement of maintenance supplies and will be equipped 

with an auxiliary hoist to perform this duty. A hydraulic mill liner-handling machines will be 

provided for servicing the SAG and ball mills respectively.  The machines will operate through the 

feed end of the mills.  

The mill floor slab will be sloped towards a large drive-in collection sump at the discharge end of 

the mills where vertical sump pumps will return spillage to the mill discharge hopper or tails tank.  

Scats from the ball mill will be collected in a drive-in scats bunker to facilitate bulk scats removal 

via a front end loader.  The scats bunker will drain into the mill area collection sump. 

Classification and Trash Screening 

The discharge from both the SAG and ball mills will be combined in a common mill discharge 

hopper and diluted with process water prior to classification.  The combined mill discharge slurry 

will be pumped to a cyclone cluster. The cyclone feed pump will be driven by a variable frequency 

drive.  The variable speed drive will be used to adjust the pump speed to control the slurry level in 

the mill discharge sump. 

The cyclone cluster will comprise of a number of operating units under normal flow conditions, two 

standby units and 1 blanked off unit for the possible addition of a gravity circuit in future.  The 

number of operating cyclones will depend on plant conditions.  Cyclone overflow at 35% w/w 

solids and a product cut size of 80% passing 75 microns will gravitate to the trash screens.  A 

portion of the cyclone overflow stream will flow to a particle size analyser to assist in monitoring 

and maintaining optimal grind size. The underflow from the cyclone cluster, at a density of 70 % 

w/w, will gravitate to the ball mill feed chute.  The ability to add cyanide to the cyclone underflow 

will be provided. 

Trash screen oversize material will flow to the tails hopper while the underflow will gravitate to a 

28 m diameter high-rate thickener. Trash screen underflow will be de-aerated in a thickener feed 

tank prior to entry into the thickener. 

A 28 m diameter high-rate thickener will thicken the leach feed from 35% solids to approximately 

50% solids. The thickener underflow discharge line will be furnished with instruments to measure 

slurry flow rate and slurry density.  Flocculant will be added into the auto-dilution feedwell of the 

thickener.  

Thickener overflow will gravitate to the process water pond for return to the milling circuit.  Decant 

and/or process water will provide the balance of the milling circuit water.   

Sumps in the grinding area will reclaim slurry spills and transport the spills to the grinding mill 

pump box for processing.

17.3.3 Carbon-In-Leach 

Thickener underflow slurry for the oxide ore will be pumped into the first tank of a train of four 12.2 

m diameter by 13.1 m tall tanks. Each of the CIL tanks will have sufficient live capacity to store 

3.4 hours of production slurry so that the leaching can continue in spite of minor stoppages of the 

grinding circuit. The CIL tanks will provide approximately 14 hours of retention time to leach the 

gold with a cyanide solution. Fresh cyanide solution and milk of lime will be added into the CIL 

circuit to maintain a cyanide concentration of about 600 ppm and a pH of 11.0. The slurry of the 

first CIL tank will flow by gravity into the second tank. The slurry of the second CIL tank will flow 

into the third CIL tank and so on until the slurry discharges from the last tank onto the carbon 

safety screen.  

For the treatment of the sulfide ore, an additional three CIL tanks will be added to the oxide circuit 

for a total of seven tanks resulting in a combined overall retention time of 24 hours. 

Each of the CIL tanks will contain activated carbon at a concentration of about 25 kg per cubic 

meter of slurry. The carbon contained in the CIL tanks will be advanced counter currently to the 

slurry flow into the previous tank by pumping slurry containing the carbon with recessed impellor 

pumps into the previous tank. The carbon advance sequence will begin at the last tank and will 

proceed to the first tank where the slurry containing the loaded carbon will be transported to the 

loaded carbon recovery screen to extract the loaded carbon for processing in the ADR plant. The 

gold content or loading of the carbon in the last CIL tank will be the lowest and the gold content of 

the carbon of the first CIL tank will be the highest. The screen overflow containing the loaded 

carbon will be washed with spray water after which the loaded carbon will discharge into the 

loaded carbon holding bin. The screen undersize containing the ore slurry will flow by gravity back 

to the first or second CIL tank. 

Each of the CIL tanks will contain carbon retention screens to avoid uncontrolled flow of carbon 

from one tank into another. 

The slurry of the last CIL tank will discharge by gravity onto a carbon safety screen. The screen 

oversize material containing any transient carbon will be washed with water and discharged by 

gravity into a portable holding bin. The screen underflow will discharge directly into a CIL tailing 

pump box from where it will be pumped to the CCD circuit. 

17.3.4 CCD Thickeners 

Slurry from the last CIL tank will discharge onto a vibrating safety screen designed to recover any 

carbon leaking from a holed screen in the last CIL tank. Carbon recovered on the carbon safety 

screens will be collected in carbon collection bins. For the oxide ore, the underflow from the safety 

screen along with flocculent will be pumped into a single stage CCD thickener in order to wash 

the pulp to reduce cyanide concentrations before being sent to the tailings storage facility. For the 

sulfide ore, two CCD thickeners will be utilized for tailing disposal.  In this arrangement the

underflow from the first CCD thickener will be mixed with decant or raw water and pumped to the 

second CCD thickener. Under normal operating conditions, all the decant return water pumped 

back from the tailings storage facility will be used as wash water in the CCD circuit, along with a 

portion of the raw water. The underflow from the second CCD thickener will then be sent to the 

final tailings tank. Solution overflow from the second CCD thickener will be mixed with the feed to 

the first CCD thickener while overflow solution from the first CCD thickener will go to the process 

water pond.  

Each CCD thickener will be capable of being bypassed if required for maintenance. Each 

thickener underflow line will be furnished with mass flow consisting of slurry flowmeter and slurry 

densitometer. The second CCD thickener used for the sulfide tailings will be installed and ready 

for operation once the oxide ore is no longer being processed. 

The CIL tails will then be pumped directly to the final tailings tank.  Cyanide levels in the feed and 

discharge streams from the CCD circuit will be measured using a free cyanide analyser. 

17.3.5 Adsorption, Desorption and Recovery Plant ("ADR")  

Acid Wash 

Four tonnes of loaded carbon will be transferred with a recessed impellor pump from the loaded 

carbon bin to the acid wash vessel where carbonates and other acid soluble compounds will be 

removed prior to processing the loaded carbon in the stripping vessel.  

Loaded carbon will be received into the four-tonne capacity stripping column.  Transfer and fill 

operations will be controlled manually.  All other aspects of the acid wash sequence will be 

automated. 

During acid washing a 3% solution by weight of hydrochloric acid will be circulated through the 

bottom of the column in order to remove contaminants, predominantly carbonates, from the 

carbon.  This process will improve the elution efficiency and has the beneficial effect of reducing 

the risk of calcium-magnesium slagging within the carbon during the regeneration process. Upon 

completion of the acid rinse, the carbon will be allowed to soak in the 3 % hydrochloric acid 

solution for an additional 30 minutes. 

After the soak period of 30 minutes has elapsed the loaded carbon will be rinsed with water.  This 

rinse water will displace any residual acid from the loaded carbon. 

When the acid wash is complete and the acid solution neutralized with caustic soda to a pH of 

8.0, the neutralized solution will be pumped to the final tailing pump box where it will be mixed 

with the final tailings and transported to the impoundment area. A weak solution of caustic soda 

will be pumped to the acid washed carbon to neutralize the remaining acid contained in the 

carbon.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Elution 

Precious metals from the loaded carbon are recovered by utilizing the Pressure Zadra elution 

process and electrowinning. From the electrowinning circuit a precious metal sludge is recovered 

with further processing in the gold room. 

For the elution process, barren strip solution is heated to approximately 80°C by a single pass 

through a diesel-fired indirect solution heater. Once a temperature of 80°C is achieved, sodium 

cyanide and sodium hydroxide are added so that a 1% w/w sodium cyanide and 1% w/w sodium 

hydroxide solution is obtained. 

The barren strip solution is then pumped through a solution heater so that the temperature of the 

solution is increased to approximately 115°C prior to entering the elution column. In order to 

enhance desorption of gold from loaded carbon, the loaded carbon is first soaked for 30 minutes 

in the strip solution. After completion of the soak period, the remaining heated barren solution is 

pumped through the solution heater and into the elution column. 

During the stripping cycle, the loaded strip solution is continuously circulated from the elution 

column to the electrowinning cell to maximize the recovery of gold. The loaded strip solution is 

sent to the single electrowinning cell for metal recovery. At the conclusion of the strip cycle, the 

stripped carbon will be pumped to a horizontal rotary kiln for thermal regeneration. 

Electrowinning and Refining 

Gold bearing sludge produced from the cathodes is washed off and collected in a cathode wash 

box. It is then pumped by an electric sludge diaphragm pump to a plate and frame filter press to 

remove excess water. The filtered cake is collected and sent to an oven for drying. 

Dried sludge is mixed with flux and charged into an electric induction furnace for smelting. Gold 

doré is poured out of the tilting furnace and collected in several cascade style moulds. The slag 

exits the melting furnace first and is later displaced by the heavier gold doré. The slag ultimately 

collects in the slag pot, which is placed below the cascading moulds. 

The electrowinning and gold filtration system will be contained within a secured system which will 

have full security surveillance using both a security guard and CCTV cameras. 

Carbon Regeneration 

The carbon regeneration circuit is sized to handle a carbon transfer rate of four tonnes per day, 

based on the assumption that all of the barren carbon is thermally regenerated prior to re-use in 

the CIL circuit.  Barren carbon is transferred to the dewatering screen before entering the kiln. 

The majority of organic compounds fouling the barren carbon will be removed in this process. 

Carbon is thermally regenerated in the kiln to restore its activity and effectively recover gold from 

the CIL circuit. The carbon will be heated to 650-750°C and held at this temperature for 15

minutes to allow effective regeneration to occur.  Regenerated carbon from the kiln will discharge 

to a quench tank.  The quenched carbon will be pumped to the carbon sizing screen.  Carbon 

sizing screen oversize will enter the CIL tanks and screen undersize will join the CIL tailings flow 

to the carbon safety screen. 

17.3.6 Tailings Disposal 

Thickener underflow from either the first or second CCD thickener will be pumped to the tailings 

tank.  Final tails will be pumped to the tailings storage facility.  Deposition of the tailings will be 

managed to develop beaches to drive the supernatant water away from the embankments. Cyclic 

spigot deposition at various locations will be practised to allow consolidation and drying of the 

deposited material. 

It is anticipated that as part of the tailings dam design that discharge of water from the tailings 

dam will not be required within the proposed life of the operations. This needs to be further 

investigated in order to be confirmed. 

17.3.7 Reagents and Consumables 

Lime  

Quicklime will be delivered in bulk 20 tonne road tankers and will be pneumatically unloaded 

directly to a silo. Quicklime will be metered and fed onto the mill feed conveyor.  The pH in the 

CIL circuit will be monitored and a slow acting control loop will control quicklime addition based on 

the mill feed rate and the measured pH. 

Cyanide 

Cyanide will be delivered to site as solid briquettes of sodium cyanide in 1 tonne bulk bags. 

Cyanide will be stored in the dry reagent storage area prior to mixing. Bags will be placed in the 

cyanide mixing area as required and hoisted up to the mixing tank. Raw water will be added to the 

tank along with cyanide to obtain a 20% w/w solution. Cyanide solution will be added to the CIL 

tanks and to the elution circuit. 

Caustic 

Caustic will be delivered in 1 tonne bulk bags.  The bulk bags will be lifted by monorail hoist to an 

enclosed bag breaker above a caustic mixing and storage tank.  Caustic will be mixed to a 

20% w/v solution with raw water.  Caustic will be added to the elution circuit.    

Hydrochloric Acid

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  175 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Hydrochloric acid will be delivered in bulk 1000 litre isotainers and will be pumped into a 

concentrated acid storage tank.  The concentrated acid (32% w/v) will be transferred from the 

concentrated acid storage tank on a batch basis to the dilute acid storage tank where raw water 

will be added to achieve a 3% concentration. Dilute hydrochloric acid will be used in the elution 

circuit. 

Activated Carbon 

Fresh activated carbon will be delivered in 500 kg bulk bags.  The bulk bags will be lifted by 

monorail hoist to the chute above the regenerated carbon transfer vessel / quench tank.  Fresh 

carbon will then be pumped to the carbon sizing screen.  The carbon sizing screen will remove 

carbon fines from the fresh material before adding it to the circuit.   

Flocculant  

Flocculant will be received in 25 kg bags and manually added to the dry hopper of a package 

mixing plant.  The powder will be initially mixed to a solution strength of 0.25% w/v.  It will then be 

transferred to an aging tank.  The flocculant will be diluted to a solution strength of 0.025% w/v 

prior to it being added to the thickener feed. 

SAG Mill Balls 

The 125 mm SAG mill grinding media will be delivered in bulk and stored in the SAG ball bunker.  

The quantity of SAG mill grinding media added on a daily basis will be determined by the plant 

metallurgist based on the SAG mill power draw and the ore type being treated.     

Ball Mill Balls 

The 80 mm and 50 mm ball mill grinding media will be delivered in bulk and stored in the ball mill 

ball bunker located on the periphery of the grinding building. 

The Ball Bunker is serviced by an electric hoist allowing balls to be lifted into a kibble using an 

electro magnet. The loaded kibble is then lifted up to the feed chute of the Ball Mill. 

17.3.8 Water Supply 

All fresh water required for the project is assumed to have to be drawn from the Jamanxim River 

located approximately 9 km west of the plant site. The fresh water tank provides capacity for 

process, gland and firewater requirements.  Estimated water requirement at this phase for the 

process is 65 m3/ hour of fresh water. 

Potable Water 



Coffey Mining

Av. Afonso Pena 4001 12º andar - Bairro Serra 

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  176 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Potable water will be supplied to the plant and mine area from the fresh water tank.  This water 

will be treated in containerised potable water treatment packages that will treat the water by 

flocculation, filtration (sand and carbon filtration), pH adjustment, chlorination and ultra-violet 

sterilisation.  Potable water will be distributed to the plant (safety showers) and the mine service 

facilities. 

17.3.9 Plant and Instrument Air 

High pressure plant air for general purpose requirements will be supplied by plant air 

compressors.  

Instrument air requirements will be supplied by an instrument air compressor. Instrument air 

provided will be dried by high capacity combination desiccant / refrigerated dryer / after coolers to 

ensure clean, low-moisture air is delivered to all plant instruments.  

17.3.10 Fuel 

Fuel will be received into a storage facility located at the mine services area to be provided by the 

fuel vendor.  Pumps will deliver fuel to a day tank which will service the smelting furnace, 

regeneration kiln, strip solution heater and emergency generator fuel tank. 

17.4 Control Philosophy 

The general control philosophy is for a plant with a medium level of automation.  The plant will be 

provided with a crushing area control room and a central plant control room from which the control 

and monitoring of plant equipment will be carried out. 

A Central Control Room (CCR) will provide operations personnel with a window to the process. At 

this location, the operator will be able to access and control all aspects of the process: from 

the introduction of ROM ore via the crushing plant, through the grinding circuit and from 

processing solution through the ADR Plant to the pouring of gold doré in the refinery.  

Additionally, a local control room at the crushing plant will provide the operator control of all 

aspects of the crushing circuit.  

Equipment in the plant will be controlled by Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) located in 

Motor Control Centres (MCC) and vendor control panels throughout the plant.  An overlying  

Distributed Control System (DCS-type system) will be used to monitor and control process 

equipment in the plant.  The process control system will also have process data trending and 

alarming capabilities and the ability to be interfaced with higher level control systems. 

Every motor in the field will have a local Start / Stop pushbutton and a Remote/Local switch, thus 

allowing the operator the flexibility to start and stop a device either locally or from the CCR. 

Regardless of from where a device is started, all safety requirements will be maintained at all 

times via hardwired interlocks, as per the electrical code.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

The Project is located in Pará State in central Brazil approximately 70 kilometres north of the town 

of Novo Progresso. The town of Morais de Almeida, located on highway BR-163, is approximately 

35 kilometres to the north. Access to the site will be via paved highway (BR-163) and a new 4 km 

gravel road connecting the mine and the highway. Local power distribution is established along 

BR-163 however, for the project, a new 138 kV high voltage transmission line must be 

constructed and will originate in Novo Progresso. Water is readily available from the site. 

Provisions have been made for storage of critical commodities on site to accommodate potential 

problems with road access to the mine during the rainy season. 

The region of Tapajós has limited infrastructure for the support of mining activities.  Some of the 

needed investment is expected to soon be provided by other, further advanced projects, and 

possibly by government investment.  For this study, nevertheless, Coffey Mining has assumed 

infrastructure investments for this project will be entirely borne by BGC.  Infrastructure investment 

will represent approximately 19% of the capital required to construct the São Jorge Mine for the 

base case alternative of contract mining. 

18.1 Access 

The project site is currently accessed by an 8 km unimproved dirt track to the west of BR-163.  

São Jorge lies 35 km south of Moraes de Almeida which connects to the regional centre of 

Santarém, 460 km to the north, via the Cuiabá-Santarém Highway.  Santarém, on the Amazon 

River, is serviced by air and river transport.  The nearest regional centre is the city of Itaituba, on 

highway BR-230 just west of BR-163, 300 km to the north, with daily commercial air service to 

Manaus and Belem. 

The closest community from which workers may be drawn, and housed, is Novo Progresso, 

approximately 70 km to the south on highway BR-163.  Novo Progresso can supply fuel, labour 

and many of the services required for the project. Novo Progresso has daily commercial air 

service to Belem and Cuiaba with stops in cities in between. International connections to cities in 

North and South America and Europe are available in Belem, Manaus and Cuiaba. 

18.2 Power Supply 

The national power grid in Pará provides a 138kV connection at Novo Progresso.  From previous 

studies on potential mining projects in the same region (Brazauro Resources, Tocantinzinho), it 

was estimated that the cost to construct a 138kV power line from the 138kV Busbar of the Novo 

Progresso Substation was US$196,000 per kilometer.  As the Tocantinzinho Project is 110 km 

northwest of São Jorge, and presently inaccessible by road, the transmission line construction 

costs for São Jorge are estimated to be in the order of US$114,000/km plus transformer sub-

station, representing a capital investment of US$8,530,813 (Table for infrastructure capex?).  



Coffey Mining

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  179 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

BGC has indicated that the cost may be mitigated by using the existing right-of-way and possibly 

the existing utility poles for the transmission line. 

Brazil maintains an infrastructure enticement in the form of discounted power supply rates which 

would be delivered via the sole electrical distribution company in Pará State, CELPA (Centrais 

Elétricas do Pará S.A.), now owned by Equatorial Energia S.A. following bankruptcy proceedings 

concluded in late 2012. The scheme enables constructors of transmission lines to recoup the 

capital cost through reduced electrical utility rates for a maximum of three years, currently the 

equivalent of US$0.058/kWh versus the ordinary rate of US$0.075/kWh. Coffey has applied the 

lower electricity tariffs to the operating costs of São Jorge. 

18.3 Water Supply and Tailings Containment 

Water for industrial and potable use has been assumed to be drawn from the Jamanxim River, 9 

km to the west of the project site.  Coffey Mining has conducted a preliminary hydrologic and 

hydrogeologic study of the project site which concluded there is inadequate sub-surface and local 

surface water to supply the mine but potable water will be piped from the river.  A pipeline must 

be constructed to supply the Project which cost to lay the pipeline has been estimated and is 

captured in capital costs.  

A tailings impoundment area will be constructed adjacent to the mine.  The initial dam will be 

constructed from pre-stripped waste rock and borrow pit material, the source of which will be 

determined in subsequent studies. 

18.4 Earthmoving 

A flat area will be required for the processing plant, maintenance shops and ancillary buildings. 

Deforestation will be required prior to earthmoving activities, in an area 5 % larger than the 

ground area to be disturbed. 

Dikes for deviation of rain water will be required around the entire site, particularly in proximity to 

the open pit mine. 

Tailings dam construction is included in the factored earthmoving cost estimates, the source 

material being drawn from mined waste rocks and clay overburden materials sourced locally to 

the site. 

18.5 Explosives Storage 

A remote explosives storage area will require deforestation, minor earthmoving at the site, in an 

area 50 m x 50 m, and the construction of a small access road.

18.6 Accommodations, Offices and Ancillary Installations 

The project location is within easy driving distance of the town of Moraes de AlmeidaNovo 

Progresso located on paved highway BR-163 approx. 70 km to the south, where most workers 

will be bussed daily to the site.  and some employees will commute from there.  Others are 

expected to travel from Novo Progresso, some 70 km to the South Some workers will be drawn 

from the smaller community of Moraes de Almeida, located on highway BR-163 approx. 30 km to 

the north.  The project plan does not include an on-site camp for the boarding of workers. 

Administrative office buildings of 500 m2 in area will be required for the project and have been 

included in capital cost estimates. 

18.7 Sanitation 

Basic sanitation for the mine and processing plant will include: 

 Raw water treatment, pumping and storage; 

 Sewage treatment station and installations for 100 people; 

 Potable water disposal;; 

 Industrial water disposal with 10,000 L capacity; and 

 Distribution nets for potable and industrial water. 

18.8 Contractors and Machinery 

The costs for construction contractors and machinery have been factored with Indirect costs 

which are expressed as a percentage of Direct costs.  Field Indirect costs for construction 

equipment, facilities and service are estimated to be 3% of Direct costs.   

18.9 Logistics 

Freight costs, which have been expressed as Indirect costs, have been estimated at 3% of the 

capital cost of mining equipment, building materials and civil construction.  Spare equipment has 

been estimated at 4%.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

Coffey has not conducted market studies on behalf of BGC nor have studies been brought to 

the attention of Coffey by BGC. There do not exist, to the knowledge of Coffey, forward or off-

take agreements related to god production from São Jorge. 

There does exist a royalty held by Talon Resources, the previous owner of São Jorge. The 

NSR royalty is set at 0.50% of revenue generated from the sale of gold and BGC has an 

option to purchase the royalty back for US$750,000. 

The state imposes a landholder royalty of 1% on the value of gold produced in Pará state.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

The project was not submitted to environmental assessment in 2012. Consequently, the 

information provided herein is the same that was developed and reported in the PEA of July 

2011. 

20.1 Preliminary Evaluation of Project Setting 

In its 2011 preliminary assessment study Coffey Mining undertook a preliminary evaluation of 

the environmental project setting information for potentially significant environmental or 

permitting constraints.  The São Jorge Gold project is located in a region known as Tapajós, 

and São Jorge is located 300 km south of the regional city of Itaituba in the Pará State.  The 

project site is located in the municipality of Novo Progresso (meaning "New Progress" in 

Portuguese) belonging to the Tapajós region.  The Tapajós region has a rich history of alluvial 

gold production, and is historically the largest alluvial gold field in Brazil. 

From the viewpoint of the environment it is important to note that mining projects have taken 

place at the São Jorge Gold project site between 2001 and 2006 and included the processing 

of gold ore and the use of cyanide to recover gold.  A small open pit of approximately 400 m 

long, 80 m wide and 20 to 30 m deep in the Wilton Pit area as well as two small leach pads 

remain from the previous garimpo operation.  Production of gold-bearing material during this 

time is reported at 15,000 t of ore per month. It is unknown how much gold was produced 

from the site during the garimpo activity. 

The sub-basin of the Jamanxim River was the subject of the Jamanxim hydroelectric 

inventory, along with the main course of the Tapajós River. This work, developed by 

Eletronorte, the CNEC and the engineering company Camargo Correa, identified the 

feasibility of four hydroelectric sites along the Jamanxim River, namely: Garden of Gold, with 

227 MW; Cachoeira dos Patos, with 528 MW; Waterfall fell, with 802 MW and Jamanxim, with 

881 MW.  These identified hydroelectric sites are part of the Ten Year Expansion Plan of the 

Ministry of Energy Mines and Energy and are expected to come into operation in 2019.  

Among the hydroelectric sites listed above, the Garden of Gold is located nearest the São 

Jorge Gold project site with, however, no known direct interference.   

20.2 Review of Existing Data 

Coffey Mining reviewed available, existing data such as environmental studies assessments 

or audits; regulatory inspections, waste handling practices or management plans for the 

project site.  With the exception of a hydrogeological report completed for the project site by 

HIDROVIA Hidrogeologia e Meio Ambiente Ltda., dated May 2011, no other environmental 

reports were provided to Coffey Mining for review for the site.  As a result, Coffey Mining also 

undertook a review of information available on the internet along with photographs of the area 

taken by Coffey Mining personnel during a site visit completed in March, 2011.

Water Resources Evaluation 

The HIDROVIA report looked at the aspects inherent to the groundwater and surface water 

potential of the São Jorge Gold project site area in Pará State.   HIDROVIA's study focused 

on the entire watershed area of the Jamanxim River, in that this information will be required by 

BGC for licensing the São Jorge Gold project if it is determined there is a requirement for the 

use of surface water for the mining project.   

HIDROVIA's evaluation included the collection of geologic and hydrologic data at the regional 

scale, and the main aspects that control the regional hydrology.  The investigation included 

the specific tasks of: 

 A survey of regional geology: 

 A survey, based on data and secondary information, of collection wells and users of 
groundwater; 

 Characterization and evaluation of existing hydrogeological information; 

 A general characterization of the watershed and drainage network of interest; 

 An analysis of climatic data; 

 An hydrologic analysis of: 

 The gauging stations in the National Water Agency – AN; and 

 Historical watershed system flows. 

Climatic Data 

Data from three metereological stations was considered for this project site.  Two selected 

stations are noted in the Table 20.2_1.

The third, a meteorological station located in Itaituba, was selected because it is located 

closest to the project site.   

According to the data recorded for this season, it appears that the average annual 

temperature is 26.7 ° C.  The lowest temperatures occur in July and August and the highest in 

the month of October. The annual relative humidity is about 88%.    

However, taking into account the moisture regime or, more specifically, the existence or 

absence of dry periods, it appears that this area of hot weather has a well-differentiated sub-

domain that determines climate (Nimer, 1989). 

Considering the seasonal amount of precipitation the area is transitional in nature towards a 

tropical climate, making it typically tropical in the area of semi-humid climate (with 4-5 dry 

months).  The transition to the rainy season occurs in August and September, while the latter 

shows higher values of total monthly precipitation.   

The project site is characterized by observing the maximum rainfall in summer and minimum 

in winter, typical regimes characteristic of Central Brazil.  The average annual rainfall is 

around 1950 mm and average annual evaporation rate for the region ranges from around 900 

mm.  The rainy season runs from October to May.  The trimester with the greatest amount of 

rainfall in the area is represented by the months of December, January and February 

(average total of 833.7 mm), about 42.5% of the annual total rainfall. The lowest amount of 

rainfall occurs in July. 

Groundwater 

When HIDROVIA reviewed the available groundwater well information from the Information 

System for Groundwater (SIAGAS), for the region of interest there were only a total of 6 wells.  

The wells in question, despite being located in distant parts of the São Jorge project area, 

present values of pump flow ranging from 0 to 8 m3/h, with only the material being drilled, 

almost always being linked to the geological zones that are typically poor aquifers.   

Looking at the relationship between the hydrodynamic properties of the various rock types 

present in the São Jorge Gold project area, there is a small portion with a high potential for 

groundwater yield, given the predominance of crystalline and metamorphic types. However, 

the use of this groundwater lends itself to a small area of aquifers at a localized level. 

This data suggests there is not sufficient groundwater in the area to consider using it as a 

source of water for the mining process. 

Surface Water 

Three basins cover the state of Pará, those being (Virtual Brazil, 2011): 

Amazon - the rivers of the Amazon basin have a very low slope and slow flow.  

Tocantins (Northeast)

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

The main river in Pará State is the Amazonas (Virtual Brazil, 2011). The biggest tributaries- 

Tocantins, Xingu and Tapajós, join the Amazon by the right, or southern, bank.  Tributaries to 

the left (northern) bank are comParátively smaller, those being Jari, Trombetas and Maicuru, 

among several others.  

The Jamanxim River occupies an area of 21,092 km2, located completely within the Pará 

State, such that the state has sole jurisdiction over the water resources.  The São Jorge Gold 

project site is located in the sub-basin of the northward-flowing river Jamanxim, which is one 

of the main tributaries of the Tapajós River (sub-basin 17), Amazon River Basin (1).  The 

Jamanxim River is located in the central-eastern town of Novo Progresso, with the mouth at 

the boundary between the municipalities of Itaituba and Trairão.   

More specifically, the project site is located south of the confluence of the Riozinho Stingray 

River and the Jamanxim River, a few kilometers upstream of New River. The drainage area of 

interest comprises virtually the headwaters of the unnamed tributary stream of the left bank of 

the Riozinho Stingray River. 

HIDROVIA identified that there is a lack of information in the vicinity of the project site 

regarding the flow regime of the applicable surface water courses.  However, it is worth 

mentioning, besides having large gaps in the data, there are wide variations between average 

monthly maximum flows and average monthly minimum flows of 3,705 m³/s and 24.4 m³/s 

respectively.  According to the data analysed at the station, long-term average flows at the 

monitoring site is 1,072 m³/s with 95% of the flow staying at approximately 65.8 m³/s.    

Pará State has no legislation regulating the minimum flow needed in a system downstream of 

water-consuming activity so as to assure consumptive use by others.  Therefore, the 

recommendation of the National Water Agency is to adopt the flow rate as 80% of Q95 (flow 

with 95% retention over time).   

In summary, HIDROVIA's report indicates that the groundwater resource is insufficient to 

supply water to the project and that the surface water resource is the only source of water to 

meet the requirements of the mining project.  There is a need for additional studies, closer to 

the project site, to determine if there is sufficient water within the river during low flow periods 

to meet the water requirements of the project.   

Terrestrial Community 

The soils in the Tapajós province are classified as yellow latosols and the topography is 

slightly rolling (Gardingen et al, 2006) with elevations of 300 m to 400 m above mean sea 

level.  This area of Brazil is considered forested, tropical and represents more than half the 

planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical 

rainforest in the world.  The forests are generally evergreen tropical rain forest on non-flooded 

land (WWF, 2001). Typically, they are characterized by patches of dense sub-montane forest 

in a matrix of open-canopy sub-montane forest. The ecoregion that lies between the Tapajós 

and Xingu rivers is characterized by a high density of lianas (woody vines), which creates a 

low open understory.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

The most important family containing lianas is Bignoniaceae, followed by Leguminosae, 

Hippocrateaceae, Menispermaceae, Sapindaceae, and Malpighiaceae (Gentry 1991). These 

forests also host large trees such as Apuleia molaris, Bagassa guianensis, Caryocar villosum, 

Hymenaea parvifolia, Tetragastris altissima, Astronium graveolens, A. le-cointei, Apuleia 

leiocarpa var. molaris, Sapium marmieri, Acacia polyphylla, and Elizabetha sp.  

The São Jorge Gold project site has been historically mined over the past decade resulting in 

the site itself consisting of predominately grasses and herbs and a few trees scattered across 

the site.  The site is considered to be developed within farmland.   

The fauna of the region includes 161 species of mammals and 556 species of bird (WWF, 

2001).  Large mammals found in this area include white-lipped peccaries (Tayassus pecari), 

collared peccaries (T. tajacu), pumas (Puma concolor), panthers (Panthera onca), tapir 

(Tapirus terrestris), and brocket deer (Mazama spp.).  The many birds found here include 

ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), harpy eagles (Harpia harpyia), toucans (Ramphastos vitellinus), 

little chachalacas (Ortalis motmot), nine tinamous (Crypturellus spp., Tinamus spp.), seven 

macaws (Ara spp.) including hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) which live in a 

few other places, many Parákeets (Parátinga spp., Pyrrhura spp., Brotogeris spp.), parrots 

(Amazona spp., Pionus spp.), and hoatzins (Opisthocomus hoazin). 

The Tapajós River is a barrier to the distribution of animals, plants, and insects- therefore 

many species found in this region are endemic (WWF, 2001). For example, the white-fronted 

capuchin (Cebus albifrons) and saki (Pithecia hirsutus) occur on the west-side of the river but 

not on the east, while the bearded saki (Chiropotes albinasus) only occurs on the east. The 

tiny titi monkey (Callicebus moloch) also occurs here, and the gray-necked night monkey 

(Aotus infulatus) and spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) are endemic to this and the interfluve 

to the east. 

Aquatic Community 

No information specific to the Jamanxim River, the Riozinho Stingray River, the New River or 

the headwaters of the unnamed tributary of the left bank of the Riozinho Stingray River was 

found, however it is known that hundreds of fish species are known to exist in the Jamanxim 

River based on information provided in mercury studies carried out in the Tapajós River 

system. 

Known, regional river wildlife includes the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), black 

caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted sideneck turtle (Podocnemis unifilis), American 

manatee (Trichechus inunguis), and river dolphins (Ina geoffroyensis, Sotalia fluviatilis).  

A report released in 1995 identified that the Tapajós River basin was the first to be intensively 

exploited in the modern Amazon gold rush. Fish and hair samples as the best indicators of 

human methylmercury contamination were investigated in the main cities and villages along 

the Tapajós river basin.  The upper basin has typical fish fauna with much larger carnivorous 

fish with higher mercury levels reaching an average value of 0.69 μg·g−1 wet wt. in 43 fish.

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

This was accompanied by high levels of mercury in the hair of the human population living in 

the same area. 

Social Setting 

According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2007) 7,136,000 

people live in the state of Pará.  The population density is approximately 5.7 

inhabitants/square kilometer.  In this state the population density remains low because of the 

dense distribution of the jungle.  The principal gateway and staging area for exploration 

operations in the Tapajós region is the city of Itaituba, a city of 70,000 that was founded in 

1883 (West,2009). The economy is based on gold mining, forestry, minor agriculture, although 

now it is mostly a local trade and transport hub.  For a short period in the 1980's, Itaituba was 

the world's busiest airport through the sheer volume of small aircraft destined for and arriving 

from the nearby alluvial goldfields.  

The Tapajós region comprises 25 municipalities, over one million people, and covers 722,358 

square kilometers (AGS, 2011). The region is much poorer than the rest of Brazil.  In recent 

years, however, several large multinational agribusiness companies have begun to clear-cut 

the region and grow soy and rice. 

Currently the Tapajós has approximately 30,000 - 60,000 active miners estimated to be 

producing approximately 200,000 to 300,000 ounces of gold each year (West,2009). 

In a period of 5 years, the population in Novo Progresso, the nearest community to the Sáo 

Jorge project site from which a workforce could be drawn and housed, doubled to 40,000 

(Clendenning, 2005). According to a 2000 census, this municipality had the highest men to 

women ratio when compared to any other municipality in the country (Richardson, 2001). 

According to IBGE, 2000, there were approximately 14,984 men and 10,001 women 

(Richardson, 2001). This shows how women do not have the motivation to remain in the 

countryside — there is no diversion, work, or other attractions, while men are more likely to 

succeed in finding employment. The largest part of the male population in the city is outside 

the city limits working in the mines or lumber mills.  

The September 2010 NI 43-101 technical report on the São Jorge property indicates that the 

village of Riozinho is located 9 km from the São Jorge Gold project mine site.  This village has 

been the source of all workers used in the exploration program to date but will be too small for 

the additional requirements of constructing and operating a mine.   

Economy 

Since colonial times in the state, the economy has been based primarily on the exploration 

for, and exploitation of natural resources (Virtual-Brazil, 2011).  Cattle breeding and agro 

business are increasing as an important source of local income.  The local economy consists 

mainly of cattle ranches.

Due to the presence of a large number of minerals, Pará is recognized as one of the richest 

states in Brazil.  For example, according to Virtual-Brazil, 2011: 

 Serra dos Carajás has proven large reserves of iron, copper, manganese, nickel, 
aluminum, tin and gold; 

 Large veins of manganese have been found in the basin of Rio Vermelho; and 

 Gold veins are present along Serra Pelada and São Jorge. 

Tapajós is amongst the largest gold provinces in Brazil (Jacobi).  Up until three decades ago, 

Novo Progresso was considered a remote jungle.  However, in more recent years it has 

begun to show signs of development, which is being driven by foreign investments.  

Brazil's government is preparing to let private companies embark on a $417 million paving 

project to turn BR-163 into a modern two-lane toll highway stretching 1,100 miles 

(Clendenning, 2005).  Not only will the construction of the highway allow more investors to 

easily access the municipality, but residents will have easier and cheaper access to outside 

markets.  

20.3 Conceptual Plans 

Identified environmental issues are as follows: 

 Finding a water source for the project; and 

 A better understanding of the biological and social environments potentially affected by 
the project. 

Baseline environmental studies are required for the São Jorge Gold project site and 

surrounding local communities to better understand the information that is directly applicable 

to the project in that site specific information is limited.  An Environmental Impact Assessment 

(EIA) needs to be undertaken for the project site to confirm whether significant plant or animal 

species or their habitat are present.   

A conceptual layout plan for the site has already been developed independent of any site 

specific environmental information.  That aside, as previously noted, the site has been 

historically cleared and mined with disturbances observed across the site.  The proposed 

conceptual mine layout is located within this disturbed footprint.  The necessary containment 

facilities will be constructed for tailings and waste rock and treatment of mine and/or process 

water will occur before release off site.  Roads already present will be upgraded and used to 

continue to access the site. 

20.4 Permitting Requirements 

In Brazil, mining is subjected to a set of regulations, where the three levels of state 

government have authority.   

According to BGC documentation, the Company had completed and filed an Environmental 

Control Plan ("Relatório de Controle Ambiental - RCA") to request the extension of an

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

Environmental License for the Exploration License 024 (replaced by Concessions 058 and 

275).  This license was previously obtained on May 26, 2006 and was valid until May 25, 

2007. BGC's NI 43-101 report, dated September 2010, indicated the application for the 

Environmental License was expected to be extended for an additional year, starting on the 

effective date that it was approved by Secretaria Estadual de Meio Ambiente (SEMA). As the 

project develops, other environmental permitting requirements are as follows:  

 An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) : National Environmental Council 
(CONAMA) for the Environmental Permit with the State of Pará; 

 License for the use of surface water (INGA) with the State of Pará.  National Water 
Agency (ANA) responsible for granting of surface water and groundwater use; 

 Environmental Impact Report (RIMA); 

 Environmental Control Plan (PCA); 

 License for production; 

 Conceptual closure plan; 

 Provisional License (LP): which governs the engineering study period; 

 Installation License (LI): is secured for the mine construction period;  

 Operating License (LO): in provisional form, is granted verbally which gives authority to 
commission and operate until a formal government inspection has been effected, 
following which the full LO is granted.  

20.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The Tapajós Region is a sub-tropical climate which, at São Jorge, exhibits an average annual 

temperature of 26.7 C at 88% humidity.  The average rainfall is 1,950mm with most rainfall 

occurring between October and May.  The dry season is of 4-5 months duration. 

The population density of the region is 5.7 souls/square kilometre with a local skewing in the 

male : female population segmentation in favour of males.  The economy of the region is 

primarily agrarian and the people of the Tapajós are considered to be of a lower economic 

station than other regions of Brazil. 

There is not adequate groundwater to supply the requirements of the São Jorge mining 

operation.  There is adequate surface water, drawn from the Jamanxim River, to the west.  A 

study is required to determine whether the river flow volume is such that it can supply São 

Jorge without a negative effect on the flow volume or on downstream users of the resource. 

For the purpose of this study it is necessary to make an assumption about the relative flow 

rates between the Jamanxim and Novo Rivers at the Jardim do Ouro fluviometric station.  The 

Novo River is a tributary of the Jamanxim River and is assumed to contribute only about 10% 

of the total flow below the confluence.  If this assumption is reasonable then the requirement 

to maintain 80% of the flow downstream of any industrial consumption implies that the 

available water, even at the long term minimum flow rate of about 24m3/s, is far in excess of

the required off-take by the São Jorge project. The São Jorge project will require less than 1% 

of the allowed off-take (20% of 65.8 m3/s, or 12 m3/s or 43,200 m3/h) to maintain the flow 

downstream of the consumption off-take point which suggests that there is the possibility to 

use the surface water system as a source of water for the mining project.  Site specific studies 

will need to be undertaken to confirm the results of the assumptions made above. 

Identified environmental issues are: 

 Finding a water source for the project; and 

 Gaining a better understanding of the biological and social environments potentially 
affected by the project. 

Baseline environmental studies (both biological and social) are required for the São Jorge Gold 

project site and surrounding local communities to better understand the information that is 

directly applicable to the project in that site specific information is limited.  An Environmental 

Impact Assessment (EIA) needs to be undertaken for the project to assess potential impacts as 

a result of the São Jorge project. 

 

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

All capital and operating costs estimates are based on the scoping definition.  No escalation 
provision has been made in the capital estimates.   

Coffey Mining assigns a low to moderate risk to the capital and operating cost aspects of the 
plant. 

21.1 Capital Costs 

Conceptual study estimates are prepared based on very limited information, and subsequently 

have low accuracy. These types of estimates are prepared for initial viability, evaluation of 

alternate schemes, project screening, project location studies, evaluation of resource needs 

and budgeting etc. 

The base case capital cost estimate (CAPEX) covers the design and construction of the 

processing plant together with certain on-site and off-site infrastructure. The estimate has a 

base date of fourth quarter 2012 (Q4 2012) and is reported in United States dollars (US$). 

The capital cost estimate has been prepared on the basis of installing new equipment for 

treating an oxide ore for the first 18 months of operation after which additional equipment will 

be purchased in order to effectively treat a sulfide ore while maintaining the same annual  ore 

throughput of 2.5Mtpa. Email quotations have been obtained for major items of equipment; 

otherwise, current prices from the Coffey Mining database were employed.  A contingency 

allowance of 25% has been included on the total direct costs in this estimate.  The capital cost 

has been developed to an expected accuracy of ± 50%.

São Jorge Gold Project – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  191 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

The capital cost estimate does not include interest, taxes or duties nor financing during 

construction. 

Budgetary prices for processing equipment were obtained from in-house historical data for 

similar projects. Commodity pricing for earthwork, concrete, steel, architectural, electrical, 

instrumentation and piping has been factored from equipment costs.  The cost estimate, in 

this report, has a predicted accuracy level of ±50%. 

21.1.1 Basis of Estimate 

The capital cost estimate includes the following: 

 direct costs of new equipment for processing facilities; 

 construction materials and installation labour; 

 project infrastructure; 

 construction of Tailings storage facility (TSF); 

 temporary buildings and services; 

 construction support services; 

 construction field indirect costs; 

 vendor supervision; 

 spare parts and initial fills (inventory); 

 freight, transport and insurance; 

 EPCM; 

 third party engineering; 

 start-up and commissioning;  

 owner's costs; and 

 contingency 

The following items are excluded from the estimate: 

 Import duty (included in financial model); 

 All Owner-payable taxes; 

 License and royalty fees (included in financial model); 

 Cost changes due to currency fluctuation; 

 Project insurances; 

 Permits or cost of permits; 

 Mine/plant closure and rehabilitation; 

 Working capital; 

 Project interest and financing cost during construction; 

 Land acquisition;

PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 Environmental studies, permitting, mitigation, monitoring and consultants; and 

 In-pit mining haul roads (mine development costs covered in contractor mining costs) 

21.1.2 Direct Cost Elements 

The direct costs are all the costs associated with permanent facilities. This includes 

equipment and material costs, as well as construction and installation costs. 

21.1.3 Mine Capital Costs 

The base case for this PEA study assumes contract mining in which case the mine contractor 

would provide all mobile equipment necessary for mining and support activities thus 

precluding the need for Owner capital. By choosing to utilize contract mining BGC may save 

as much as 39% on LOM capital as compared to purchasing a fleet of mining equipment from 

the outset of the project. 

BGC recognizes that contract mining would enable the São Jorge gold project to be put into 

operation with the least amount of capital expenditure.  The base case of this study presents 

contract mining and the economics of the project on that basis.  In addition, an Owner mining 

scenario has been evaluated by Coffey, which details and results are also included herein. 

The project capital costs, estimated at US$100.5 million in start-up capital and $125.5 million 

for the LOM, for contract mining are summarized in the following table.  No capital costs have 

been included for mine equipment as the base case reflects the use of contract mining.  

Additionally, the capital cost timing reflects the phased process plant construction with the 

oxide plant constructed in Year 0 followed by the necessary plant additions to process the 

sulfide ore expended in Year 2.

Relative to the contract mining base case, owner mining would require an additional $49.4 

million in LOM capital, including a 15% contingency, with $28.4 million required in the first two 

years of operations and the balance expended as sustaining capital, as shown in Table 

21.1.3_3.

21.1.4 Process Equipment 

For the processing plant, equipment pricing is based on the equipment list, which is generated 

from the process flow diagram. 

Other direct costs were factored based on the total installed cost of process equipment for 

such as: 

 earthworks (related to the process plant); 

 concrete; 

 structural steel; 

 buildings and architectural; 

 electrical; 

 instrumentation and controls; and 

 piping. 

The major capital items for the sulfide processing circuit are the installation of the SAG mill, 

an additional thickener and more leach tanks, complete with the civil works required for 

erection. 

21.1.5 Infrastructure 

The costs for the infrastructure are primarily allowances based on in-house experience from 

other similar projects. One area that requires special attention is the TSF. The cost in the 

estimate is based on the assumption of a 2-year starter dam. The cost for raising the dam 

after the first 2 years is included as sustaining capital in the preliminary financial model. This 

area needs input from a specialist geotechnical company at the next stage of the Project to 

develop more accurate costs. 

Cost estimates to construct and install the major infrastructure items are summarized in Table 

21.1.5_1.  Ancillary buildings, including administration offices, cafeteria and nursing station 

are accounted in Plant Capital costs.

office operations, security buildings and services, construction warehousing and material 

management, construction power and utilities, site transportation, medical facilities and 

services. 

21.1.8 Owner's Costs 

Owner's costs were allocated a total of $4.3 M for the construction of the oxide plant and $1.1 

million for the plant additions to accept sulfide ore, spread over the pre-production years and 

first years of operation until the plant reaches nameplate capacity. Owner's costs include on-

going engineering studies, corporate overhead, tenement upkeep, etc.

guarantees or warranties, has been included in the estimate.  Typically, the cost for this item 

is inclusive of salary, travel, accommodation and subsistence. 

21.1.12 Taxes and Duties 

Taxes and duties are excluded. 

21.1.13 Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management  

EPCM is estimated as a percentage of the total project direct cost. The percentage was 

benchmarked against other similar and recent projects using North American engineering 

costs. 

21.1.14 Owner's Pre-production Costs 

The Owner's pre-production costs up to Year 1 of production includes for the following: 

(a) Site maintenance and mobile equipment; 

(b) Community relations; 

(c) Emergency response (from commencement of  mining pre-production activities); 

(d) Environmental / permitting / government relations; 

(e) Finance and general administration costs; 

(f) Health and safety (including provision of medical clinic facilities during construction); 

(g) Human resources (recruitment for operations personnel); 

(h) Insurance costs; 

(i) Information technology; 

(j) Legal costs; 

(k) Logistics costs; 

(l) Management costs associated with senior BGC personnel during construction; 

(m) Training costs for operations personnel;

(q) Mine costs associated with Mining Department personnel ramp-up. 

21.1.15 Contingency 

Contingency is a provision of funds for unforeseeable capital costs within the defined project 

scope. The project contingency is understood to cover the normal inadequacies that are 

inherent in design definition, execution definition and estimating deficiencies. A contingency 

allowance of 25% has been included on the direct costs of the mill plant construction project.  

Further, a contingency of 15% on mining equipment costs has been included in the Owner 

mining alternative. 

21.2 Operating Cost Estimate 

The estimated LOM total operating costs for both the oxide and sulfide ores are shown in 

Table 21.2_1 to illustrate the variability in costs from the soft oxidized material and the 

underlying fresh rock.

21.2.1 Mining Costs 

Mine operating costs for a local contractor to remove overburden, dig laterite and saprolite 
material, strip waste rock and mine the gold-bearing ore have been sourced in Brazil by BGC 
and provided to Coffey. The average LOM cost of contract mining is estimated to be 
US$3.11/t mined, which represents a blended cost which includes the mining of fresh ore, 
saprolite and waste rock. At a 4.90 : 1 stripping ratio, the cost of ROM becomes $18.35/t. In 
this scenario, BGC would operate the processing mill and manage the contractor activities at 
the mine site through the life of the operation. 

The cost estimates for contract mining and gold ore processing at São Jorge are summarized 
in Table 21.2.1_1.

21.2.2 Plant and Infrastructure 

The operating costs have been estimated in fourth quarter 2012 United States Dollars, using 

costs from comparable projects. The level of accuracy of the operating cost is ±30%. 

Contingency of 10% on the estimate has been applied on the transportation costs for all 

consumables. 

The operating costs for the São Jorge study were developed based on the following criteria: 

a. Labour: All around the clock operations are based on a four shift rotation of 12-hour 

shifts using a 1-week on, 1-week off cycle.  Non-shift labour is based on a 40-hour work 

week, working 5-8 hour shifts.  Transportation to and from the site will be the 

responsibility of each employee, future considerations may be given to mine provided 

transportation. Apart from some senior positions, it is assumed that labour for the entire 

complex will be Brazilian based. 

b. The man power costs for this Project were estimated using other mining projects in 

South America, based on labour rates and payroll burdens (% overhead). Based on this 

information, a master labour list was compiled by Coffey Mining. A total of 305 people 

will be employed site wide, of which 187 will be required by the mining contractor (or 

mining department), 82 will be required for the process plant and the remaining 36 

personnel will comprise the general and administration ('G&A') staff.  

c. Commodity usage rates were developed from recent test work.  Unit pricing for 

commodities was taken from Coffey's data base for South American projects. In order 

to cover the cost of transportation and duties, a 10% premium on the costs of all 

consumables was added. 

d. Electrical power cost used for this study was US$ 0.058/kWh, which was estimated by 

the client based on advice that a discounted power cost would be applied for three 

years until the capital cost of the São Jorge power line has been recouped.  Electrical 

power consumption and estimates were based on equipment connected loads. A factor 

of 80% was used to estimate the operating load from the connected load. A utilization 

factor of 92% was estimated from the anticipated processing plant availability. 

e. Maintenance supplies for stationary equipment are based on 3.5% of installed 

mechanical and electrical equipment costs. For piping, electrical, and instrumentation, a 

factor of 1.5% was used to estimate maintenance supplies.  Factor rates are based on 

experience. 

A summary of the Process Plant operating costs is shown in Table 21.2.2_1, and includes 

labour, consumable supplies, electrical power usage, maintenance supplies, and other 

applicable costs.

Coffey notes that for the purpose of this study, value added taxes and other taxes, along with 

import duty costs, have not been included. Transportation and refining charges for gold bullion 

bars are not included in the operating costs but are considered in the financial model as are 

rehabilitation costs (included in deferred capital schedule), land tenure and tenement fees, 

exploration costs and all costs associated with areas beyond the São Jorge Project battery 

limits. 

21.2.3 General and Administration Costs

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The economics of the São Jorge project have been evaluated using conventional discounted 
cash flow techniques based on the production schedules, capital expenditures and operating 
costs discussed in this report.  In addition, the following key parameters were integral to the 
cash flow model and the economic results: 
 

 The base case metal price was $1,500 per ounce gold; 

 The analysis is based on 100% equity financing with no debt component; 

 All costs and revenues are reported in "real" or constant US dollars without 
escalation; 

 A base income tax rate of 25% was applied with a 75% reduction as per the general 
understanding of Brazilian income tax laws and associated incentives for projects 

located in underdeveloped Brazilian states; 

 Provision was also made for the Brazilian Social Contribution Tax of 9%; and 

 A base case of contract mining  
 

22.1 Cash Flow Assumptions 

Mine Production Sequence 

The mine production is based on the mine plan and sequencing described earlier in this 
report. Following a one year construction and pre-production period, approximately 3,500 
ktonnes of oxide resources will be mined and processed in the first two years of operations 
followed by approximately 18,200 ktonnes of sulfide resources over an additional eight-year 
period.  The average oxide gold grade is 1.26 g/t and the average sulfide gold grade is 1.56 
g/t for an average ROM grade of 1.51 g/t over the life-of-mine.  The average strip ratio is 4.90 
:1, waste tonnes to ore tonnes. 
 

Metallurgical Recovery 

Metallurgical recoveries of 88.0% and 93.7% have been assumed for the oxide and sulfide 
resources, respectively.  The design capacity of the mill is modeled at 2,500 ktonnes per year 
for years 2 to 10.  A reduced capacity is modeled for year 1 at 1,500 ktonnes per year.  After 
year 1, an average of 114,000 ounces of gold are expected to be produced on an annual 
basis.  The total gold production through the life-of-mine is 980,300 ounces. 
 

Metal Prices and Net Revenues 

The long-term gold price incorporated into the cash flow analysis is US$1,500/oz. This price is 
based on the 36-month average historical gold price as shown in Table 22.1_1.  The use of 
historical metal prices is a generally accepted methodology for modeling long-term commodity 
prices.

Gross revenues are determined as the product of the recovered ounces of gold and the long-
term metal price. The gross revenues are adjusted to account for royalty charges and refining 
costs to arrive at a net revenue value.  The following parameters were applied in determining 
the annual net revenue values.

Capital Costs, Depreciation and Amortization 

The capital costs included in the cash flow analysis are summarized in the following table.  No 
capital costs have been included for mine equipment as the base case reflects the use of 
contract mining.  Additionally, the capital cost timing reflects the phased process plant 
construction with the oxide plant constructed in Year 0 followed by the necessary additions to 
process the sulfide ore in Year 2.

Total Capital 100.5 25.0 125.5 

 
The capital costs have been fully depreciation or amortized on a unit production basis over 
the life of the mine. Based on Brazilian tax rules, if the useful life of an asset is longer than the 
concession period of the mine, a unit production depreciation method can be applied. 
 

Taxes 

The standard Brazilian corporate income tax rate is 15% which is increased by a surtax of 
10% on taxable profits that exceed R$240,000 annually, resulting in a total income tax rate of 
25%.  A 75% reduction of the income tax rate has been incorporated into the cash flow model 
to reflect the SUDAM 10-year tax incentive for projects located in underdeveloped states in 
Brazil, including Para.  In addition, a Social Contribution Tax of 9% is levied on the income 
before taxes.  The overall tax rate is 15.25%. 
 
Brazilian tax laws allow for tax losses to be carried forward indefinitely.  Tax losses are 
allowed to offset up to 30% of the taxable income in any year. 
 

Working Capital 

The annual calculated cash flows were reconciled to account for annual changes in accounts 
receivable and accounts payable.  The basis for the reconciliation is a one month balance for 
the accounts receivable (based on revenues), a two month balance for accounts payable as 
based on reagents and consumables and a one month balance for accounts payable based 
on labour costs.  Outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are 
recovered in year 10.

22.2 Financial Performance 

 
Under the estimates and assumptions used for the base cash flow analysis (contract mining 
case), the São Jorge project would be expected to generate an undiscounted, life-of-mine 
after-tax cash flow of US$610.7 million.  At a discount rate of 5% the after tax NPV is 
US$406.6 million.  The life-of-mine economics are presented in Table 22.2_1

22.3 Contract Mining Compared to Owner Mining 

Contract mining requires lower capital to get the project up and running.  However, once 

operating, Owner mining presents an opportunity for lower operating costs and superior LOM 

return on investment. A comparison of the costs of capital, operating costs and the resultant 

economic outcomes is presented in Tables 22.3_1, 22.3_2 and 22.3_3.

22.4 Sensitivity Analysis 

Contract Mining 

As shown in Table 22.4_1 and Figure 22.4_1, the economics of the São Jorge project are 
most sensitive to variation in gold price and less sensitive to variations in capital expenditures 
and operating costs.

22.5 Economic Analysis Conclusions 

The São Jorge gold project exhibits a robust return on investment based on the production 

rate, cost estimations and assumptions made in this study.  The base case alternative of 

contract mining will require 39% less capital than the owner operated scenario as the mining 

fleet will be provided by the contractor. There will remain some uncertainty of the ultimate 

mining cost by a contractor until a tender process can be executed.  However, the estimate as 

provided in this study satisfies the accuracy requirement of a PEA. 

The project exhibits economic robustness at a gold price of US$1500 per ounce, which price 

is equal to the three-year trailing average price at the end of January 2013 as published by 

Kitco.  The project is most sensitive to gold price – a 30% drop in the price of gold, to 

US1,050/oz, would reduce the project NPV by 64%, but the NPV would remain positive thus 

indicating a positive economic investment at the selected hurdle rate of 5%. 

There remain a number of uncertainties to the project, which are itemized in the following 

section. Addressing the uncertainties will prepare the project for the next level of engineering 

study. Coffey concludes that the São Jorge gold project is worthy of advancement to a 

preliminary feasibility study.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

There are no adjacent or nearby concessions to those of BGC although the São Jorge gold 

deposit is related to the east extension of the regional 450km long northwest-southeast Cuiú-

Cuiú - Tocantinzinho lineament which also hosts several important gold deposits including the 

Palito mine, Tocantinzinho and Cuiú-Cuiú deposits, and Bom Jardim and Batalha gold 

prospects. 

BGC is actively engaged in mineral property exploration in the vicinity of São Jorge with 

reported mineral occurrences at Surubim and Joao. Should those prospects prove viable, 

there may be the option of processing ores from proximal mining operations at the São Jorge 

site on a toll basis.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Coffey Mining, in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 which regulates the 

public disclosure of Resources, concludes that the São Jorge Gold Project is validated in 

accordance with best practices. 

Coffey further concludes that: 

 The São Jorge gold project exhibits a robust return on investment - greater than 45% 
after-tax IRR; 

 The option of contract mining would enable BGC to commence operations at São 
Jorge for $50 million less than the alternative of Owner mining; 

 Contract mining operating costs could be as much as 23% greater than the costs of 
Owner mining; 

 The Owner-mining alternative will provide a LOM investment return 5% higher than a 
contract mining option; 

 More metallurgical testing is required to raise the confidence in the projected gold 
recovery, to better ascertain the optimum process configuration and to provide 

adequate data for engineering work at the PFS level of accuracy; 

 The deposit remains open at depth and along strike to the NW and the SE; 

 There is exploration potential on the São Jorge site and at nearby properties close 
enough to enable São Jorge to contemplate providing a toll milling service. 

 The resource tonnage has increased significantly since the estimate in 2011 as a 
result of new drilling by BGC. 

 The resource grade has increased significantly since the last estimate in 2011 as a 
result of in drilling and sampling which enabled a smaller search ellipse in this 

estimate. 

 Potential head grade enhancement may be possible through selective mining of 
internal waste based on pit mapping and grade control; 

 Potential head grade enhancement may result from further upgrading of inferred 
resource to indicated.  

 Recommended exploration and other technical investigations should be focused on 
the graduation of Inferred resources to at least Indicated resources to be able to 

incorporate more tonnes of mineralized material into a PFS; and 

 The project exhibits certain risks – primarily to fluctuations in the price of gold, but 
also to an inexperienced work force, variations in mineral grade and uncertain

metallurgical recovery. Mitigating the risks will require effort in personnel training, 

selective, controlled mining, and additional metallurgical testing.

26.2 Metallurgical Testwork 

Coffey recommends the following metallurgical testwork to ascertain optimum grind size, 

reagent consumption, gold recovery circuit design and processing cost determination: 

 New samples representative of typical oxide and sulfide ROM streams must be gathered; 

 Comminution testing; 

 Grind versus recovery testwork; 

 Gravity recovery tests; 

 Leach tests on gravity concentrate; 

 Established leach kinetics for oxide ore 

 Variability tests utilizing various head grades and lithological domains; 



Coffey Mining 

São Jorge Gold Project  – CM_BGC_21414 Page:  220 
PEA_NI43-101 – 31 March 2013 

 Mineralogical analysis on oxides and sulfides; 

 Optimized reagent consumption  

 Settling tests for both ore types 

The estimated cost for such testwork, which largely depends on the laboratory proximity to the 

project site and the number of tests to be conducted, is estimated at US$75,000. A closer 

approximation of testwork costs can be determined once a laboratory has been identified and 

selected. 

26.3 Other Recommendations 

Oriented core drilling, geotechnical rock property testing and pit slope engineering is 

recommended in the next engineering study and is required for a preliminary feasibility study 

(PFS).  

An environmental base line study, in preparation for an Environmental Assessment, is 

strongly recommended at the outset of the next engineering study.
