1. SUMMARY   

 
Excelsior Mining Corp. ("Excelsior") requested Independent Mining Consultants ("IMC") to 
complete an independent Technical Report ("Report"), compliant with the Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101 ("N43-101") standards for reporting mineral properties, for the Gunnison 
Copper Project (the "Project") in Cochise County, Arizona, USA.  

The Gunnison Copper Project contains copper oxide and sulfide mineralization with associated 
molybdenum, in potentially economic concentrations. IMC authored a technical report in 2010 on 
the resource estimate for the two deposits within the project area, the North Star (formerly I-10) 
and the South Star (formerly Dragoon) along with recent and historical independent reports 
(Welhener, 2010).  Subsequent to that report, Excelsior has commenced core drilling on the 
property for confirmation, infill and step out drill holes.  Incorporated into the updated mineral 
resource estimate issued on July 19, 2010 and incorporated into this technical report are the 
results of 19 of those drill holes. 

The Gunnison Project is located about 65 miles east of Tucson, Arizona on the southeastern flank 
of the Little Dragoon Mountains in the Johnson Camp Mining District. The property is within the 
copper porphyry belt of Arizona. The North and South Star deposits contain copper mineralization 
in potentially economic concentrations. 

Excelsior has an exclusive Option to acquire 100% of the title to the mineral interests that 
constitute the Gunnison Project located in Cochise County, Arizona, including all drill core, 
samples, reports, information and data, for $350,000 payable to the Trust on or before January 1, 
2013.  A further $300,000 is payable to certain land holders of the North Star deposit with 
$150,000 of the $300,000 due on exercise of the Option and the remaining $150,000 due on or 
before December 31, 2016.     

No mining or processing of the resources have occurred, although similar mineralization has been 
successfully mined 1.5 miles north at Johnson Camp (Nord Resources Corporation) as an open 
pit.  It is considered possible that portions of the Gunnison deposits could be mined using an open 
pit, dump leach and SXEW mining scenario.  Challenges to a possible North Star open pit include 
overburden removal and avoiding or moving the I-10 freeway. However, significant mineralization 
at North Star occurs greater than 800 feet (~250m) south of the freeway and this portion of the 
resource remains open to the south, thus having open pit potential.  

Excelsior's preferred alternative to open pit or underground mining is In Situ leaching ("ISL"), either 
from the surface or combined with open pit or underground mining.  Both deposits show significant 
fracturing and jointing of the host rocks resulting in broken ground that is water saturated and 
permeable. The copper carbonates and oxides occur preferentially as coatings on the fracture 
planes and as veinlets or matrix fill to the broken fragments. This should result in preferential 
exposure of the copper minerals to any lixiviant (the liquid medium used for metal extraction), thus 
reducing the amount of acid consumed by the un-exposed carbonate rocks. The above features, 
combined with the large size of the deposit, suggest ISL is a viable approach to mining.  

The techniques for ISL have evolved to the point where it is considered a controllable, safe and 
environmentally benign mining method with low capital and operating costs. The technology has 
been proven, with over 90% of 2006 uranium production in the United States coming from ISL 
operations.  In addition to uranium the technique has been successfully applied to the mining of 
oxide and sulfide copper, gold, sulfur, salt, phosphate and boron.

ISL is a closed loop mining system, where ground water from the aquifer is utilized as the 
transport medium. Minerals or metals are dissolved in situ within the host formation using an 
appropriate lixiviant. Patterns of screened and cased bores or wells are used to deliver the lixiviant 
to the ore horizon enabling it to contact the mineralization whilst passing through the aquifer. 
Similarly, patterns of recovery or extraction wells fitted with pumps deliver the pregnant fluid (the 
lixiviant plus dissolved metals) to the surface for processing. After processing, the fluid is recycled 
to the well field to beginning the leaching cycle again. Thus, ISL takes place on a continuous 
mining basis.  

Several ISL operations for copper have operated or been permitted in Arizona including Miami 
(BHP-Billiton), San Manuel (BHP-Billiton), Silver Bell (ASARCO), Old Reliable (Ranchers 
Exploration), Santa Cruz (ASARCO et. al.), Florence (BHP-Billiton), and Safford area (Kennecott 
Copper).  Considerable expertise in copper oxide ISL mining is available in Arizona and elsewhere 
in the USA.  

Technical reports prepared by experts in the fields of metallurgy (Dr. Roshan Bhappu), hydrology 
(Dr. Shlomo Orr), and geochemistry (Dr. Aberra Getahun) have been relied on for the preparation 
of this report.  

1.1.  Mineral Resource Summary 

IIMC has updated the mineral resource of the North Star Deposit with the inclusion of additional 
drill hole and assay data, including 19 holes drilled by Excelsior during 2010 and 2011.  The 
geologic framework of the resource block model has been updated for the geologic formations and 
the oxidization zones within the deposit.  The mineral resource meets the requirements of the CIM 
Definitions Standards – For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and thus is NI 43-101 
compliant.  The mineral resources for the project are shown below in Table 1-1.  The 0.10% 
copper cutoff grade in the oxide zone and the 0.30% copper cutoff in the mixed-sulphide zone 
define the tonnage that could be potentially extracted using the ILS method.

1.2.  Geological Summary 

The deposits (North Star and South Star) form part of the Mexican Highland section of the Basin 
and Range province.  The province is characterized by fault-bounded mountains, typically with 
large intrusive cores, separated by deep basins filled with Tertiary and Quaternary gravels. 

The Gunnison project lies on the eastern edge of the Little Dragoon Mountains.  The ages of the 
rocks range from 1.4 billion years ago (Ga) Pinal Group schists to recent Holocene sediments.  
The southern portion of the Little Dragoon Mountains consists predominately of the Tertiary Texas 
Canyon Quartz Monzonite whereas the Pinal Group schists and the Paleozoic sediments that host 
the regional Cu mineralization dominate the northern half.   

Copper sulfide mineralization has formed preferentially in the proximal (higher metamorphic grade) 
skarn facies, particularly along stratigraphic units such as the Abrigo and Martin Formations and 
within structurally complex zones. Primary mineralization occurs as stringers and veinlets of 
chalcopyrite and bornite.  Primary mineralization remains open at depth and to the north and 
south. 

Oxidation of the mineralization occurs to a depth of approximately 1600 feet, resulting in the 
formation of chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, copper oxides and secondary chalcocite.  The bulk of 
the copper oxide mineralization occurs as malachite and/or chrysocolla that have formed as 
coatings on rock fractures and as vein fill.  The remainder of the oxide mineralization occurs as 
replacement patches and disseminations. 

The geology has been well documented and all materials including logs, reports and diamond core 
have been preserved and are stored at the core storage facility in Casa Grande, Arizona.

Future geological documentation includes identifying transitional sulfides and mapping out the 
carbonate content of the host rocks.  Detailed RQD and structural analysis will also assist with the 
hydrological model and contribute to a more refined resource model.   

1.3.  Metallurgical Summary 

A metallurgical review by Dr. Roshan B. Bhappu of Mountain States Research and Development 
International (MSRDI) summarized all past metallurgical work and reviews the use of sulfurous 
acid as a potential lixiviant to extract the copper. Metallurgical data have been compiled with the 
average acid consumption of 10 to 12 pounds of sulfuric acid per pound of copper extracted and 8 
to 9 pounds of sulfurous acid per pound of copper obtained. 

With the use of sulfurous acid, the potential of the Gunnison Copper Project may be very desirable 
and could have a huge impact on the projects economics.  Hazen Laboratory in Denver, Colorado 
did a series of test using sulfurous acid as the lixiviant in 1996 for BHP Copper (now BHP-Billiton).  
The results from the Hazen testing are encouraging enough to warrant continued examination of 
this lixiviant and it's potential.  AzTech commissioned column testing on core shed material using 
sulfurous acid that confirmed the Hazen results.  The test results indicated that similar extraction 
and acid consumption rates were obtained using both sulfuric and sulfurous acid. 

1.4.  Geochemical Summary 

The important mineralization zones are localized in the Abrigo and Martin formations, 
approximately 89% of the leachable copper oxides.  The mineralization is primarily chrysocolla, a 
copper silicate, which is leachable as long as the pH of the lixiviant is below 1.8 (similar to most 
copper oxide leaching operations).  The rock mass matrix is carbonate in nature, called a skarn, 
and generally considered a strong acid consumer unless heavily altered.  The copper 
mineralization is found primarily in the fractures with very little disseminated copper.  As 
dissolution of copper begins, other gangue minerals associated with the fractures also are 
mobilized, especially calcite when sulfuric acid is used.  With sulfuric acid, calcium may precipitate 
out of the leach solution as gypsum, primarily within the fractures. 

Geochemistry is an integral part of the technical disciplines associated with In Situ technology and 
its applicability.  This aspect becomes even more critical when there is a choice of lixiviants.  The 
geochemist will have to evaluate the two lixiviants including determining the acid concentrations 
that are critical to optimizing the leaching process.  There is a detailed explanation of the 
requirements of geochemistry in Section 13.2. The oxide copper mineralization consisting of 
predominately chrysocolla and malachite is readily treatable with current and proven technology 
using sulfuric acid.  Sulfurous acid may prove to be a better lixiviant than sulfuric acid. The results 
from the Hazen Testing of sulfurous acid have raised some potentially very economic production 
scenarios for an In Situ leaching facility where sulfurous acid is the lixiviant.  One of the first tasks 
for the project team will be the investigation into the potential of sulfurous acid and the means to 
produce it on site. 

1.5.  Hydrological Summary 

An Independent report summarizing the hydrology of the Gunnison Copper Project was 
commissioned by AzTech Minerals and completed by Dr. Shlomo Orr in August 2007.   Dr. Orr 
has significant expertise in the field of hydrogeology specializing in In Situ applications. 

Dr. Shlomo's conclusions based on limited historical data is that the system has similarities to the 
Florence oxide copper deposit and the Gunnison project requires a thorough investigation.  In

addition Dr. Shlomo has suggested potential avenues of innovation that may lead to hydrological 
improvements and cost savings for the project.  

The general hydrogeology of the region is characterized by a complex terrain – Paleozoic 
sedimentary rocks trending NW-SE, overlying the Texas Canyon quartz monzonite intrusive rocks, 
which, in turn, outcrops SW to the domain of interest. The Gunnison Hills Fault to the east is the 
dominant structure in the region, which is faulted and fractured throughout.  

The mineralized units suitable for in situ leaching are the consolidated limestone and dolomites 
(the bedrock), particularly, the Abrigo and Martin formations (and Horquilla formation in the South 
Star resource area), which were intruded by quartz monzonite rocks along the NW trending ridge 
that formed the central core of the deposit. The complex NW striking normal faulting has resulted 
in large displacements within the Paleozoic rock sequence, with potentially preferential vertical 
pathways (i.e., hydraulic anisotropy on a large scale). Overlying the host rocks is the semi-
consolidated alluvium, which constitutes the main aquifer, rendering the underlying (submerged) 
formations "bedrock" aquifers (or aquitards). In that sense and on this large scale, the large-scale 
hydrogeology of the Gunnison Copper Project has some similarity to the Florence aquifer system 
(essentially, low-permeability rocks (mineralized) underlying a high-permeability sedimentary 
layer). 

Groundwater recharge seems to occur along the western portion of the mineralized zone, along 
the contact of the quartz monzonite outcrop and the alluvium. Groundwater in the alluvium seems 
to move generally from west to east, above the mineralized zone.  

1.6.  Conclusions and Recommendations 

Excelsior's aim is to bring the North Star copper oxide deposit into production by using proven In 
Situ leach ("ISL") technology.  This will be done in a staged approach through to a pre-feasibility 
study dependant upon a successful resource upgrade to indicated status; and into feasibility 
studies dependant upon a positive pre-feasibility study. The main areas of activity include resource 
extension and up-grades, detailed geological/metallurgical modeling, hydrological investigations, 
environmental monitoring, community engagement and mine design (including mining scenarios 
alternative to ISL). 

IMC concludes that the mineral resources as presented in Section 14 and summarized in Table 1-
1 are representative of the deposit and the next steps to upgrade the resource estimate and 
evaluate potential extraction and production options should be taken.   

After reviewing the metallurgical test work on sulfuric acid and the Hazen Report on sulfurous acid, 
it is Dr. Bhapuu's opinion that the use of sulfurous acid in the Gunnison Copper Project makes the 
project very desirable and could have a huge impact on the projects economics. Metallurgical data 
have been compiled with the average acid consumption of 10 to 12 pounds of sulfuric acid per 
pound of Cu and 8 to 9 pounds of sulfurous acid per pound of Cu obtained. 

The important mineralization zones are localized in the Abrigo and Martin formations, 
approximately 89% of the leachable copper oxides.  The mineralization is primarily chrysocolla, a 
copper silicate, which is leachable as long as the pH of the lixiviant is below 1.8 (similar to most 
copper oxide leaching operations).  The rock mass matrix is carbonate in nature, called a skarn, 
and generally considered a strong acid consumer unless heavily altered.  The copper 
mineralization is found primarily in the fractures with very little disseminated copper.  As

mobilized, especially calcite when sulfuric acid is used.  With sulfuric acid, calcium may precipitate 
out of the leach solution as gypsum, primarily within the fractures.

2. INTRODUCTION  

Excelsior Mining Corp. requested Independent Mining Consultants ("IMC") to complete an 
independent Technical Report, compliant with the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-
101") standards for reporting mineral properties, for the Gunnison Copper Project (the "Project") – 
North Star Deposit in Cochise County, Arizona, USA.  

The purpose of the Technical report is to provide information regarding the geology, mineralization 
and mineral resource potential of the Gunnison Copper Project, review the past and current 
exploration on the project and to make recommendations for further exploration and development 
activities for the project. 

The Gunnison Copper Project contains copper oxide and sulfide mineralization with associated 
molybdenum, in potentially economic concentrations. There are two deposits within the Project 
area, the North Star (formerly I-10) and the South Star (formerly Dragoon) deposits.  North Star 
was reviewed in detail along with numerous recent and historical independent reports. For further 
information on South Star please refer to an earlier 43-101 report (Welhener 2010) which was 
prepared for AzTech Minerals, Inc. and Excelsior Mining Corp. 

On October 15, 2010, Excelsior Mining Corp. (the "Company" or "Excelsior"), completed a reverse 
takeover ("RTO") by acquiring all of the issued and outstanding common shares of AzTech 
Minerals, Inc. ("AzTech") in exchange for 22,359,173 voting common shares and 7,007,876 non-
voting and non-publicly traded common shares of the Company. The Company is listed on the 
TSX-V under the symbol "MIN".   

Legally, the Company is the parent of AzTech, however, as a result of the share exchange 
described above control of the combined companies passed to the former shareholders of 
AzTech. This type of share exchange is referred to as a "reverse takeover".  The executive 
management of AzTech continued on as the executive management of Excelsior. 

Herb Welhener is the IMC Qualified Person responsible for this report and he visited the Project 
site on April 13th, 2011 and the core storage facilities on April 20th, 2011.    

This report is in English units. Tons are short tons and ktons mean 1000 short tons. Copper and 
molybdenum grades are in % per short ton. All tonnages reported in this document are in dry tons. 
Lengths are in feet (except where noted) and currency is in US dollars (except if noted otherwise). 

2.1. Definitions of Terms Used in This Report 

In Situ leaching  A closed loop mining system, where ground water from the aquifer is utilized as 
the transport medium of the lixiviant and minerals or metals are dissolved in situ within the host 
formation using an appropriate lixiviant.   

Lixiviant  Liquid mediums used in hydrometallurgy to selectively extract the desired metal from 
the ore or mineral. It assists in rapid and complete leaching. The metal can be recovered from it in 
a concentrated form after leaching.

Sulfuric acid  A dense, colorless liquid chemical (H2SO4) used extensively to leach copper ore. 
Sulfuric acid is primarily produced as a by-product of smelting, but it may also be generated by 
other means.  The lixiviant containing sulfuric acid percolates through a surface stockpile or in situ 
rock, dissolving copper minerals contained in the rock. This copper laden water called PLS 
(pregnant leach solution) is recovered from the bottom of the surface stockpile or by recovery 
wells in an in-situ leach approach and flows to a collection pond or tanks for further processing. 

Sulfurous acid  The chemical species H2SO3, which is formed by dissolving sulfur dioxide, SO2 , in 
water was used briefly as a lixiviant for copper in the 1920's.  

3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS AND DISCLAIMER 

IMC has relied on information provided by Excelsior, its consultants, and information provided in 
numerous previous reports on the Project.  IMC relied on information provided in earlier reports on 
the Project provided by Excelsior.  The key reports relied on are listed below. 

1. Dr Shlomo Orr (SME, B.E.), 2007; President, Orr and Associates, "Preliminary Review of the 
Hydrogeology of the Gunnison Copper Project Site" 

2. Dr Roshan B. Bhappu (SME, P.E.), President, Mountain State R & D International, Inc., 2007; 
"An Evaluation of the Metallurgy and Geochemistry of the Gunnison Copper Project with 
Special Emphasis on In Situ Leaching". 

3. Dr Aberra Getahun, Senior Geochemist, Water Management Consultants, 2007; "An 
Evaluation of the Geochemistry of the Gunnison Copper Project with Special Emphasis on In 
Situ Leaching Technology 

Where possible, IMC has confirmed the information provided by comparison against other data 
sources.  Where checking and confirmation were not possible, IMC has assumed that all 
information supplied is complete and reliable within normally accepted limits of error. During the 
normal course of the review, IMC has not discovered any reason to doubt that assumption. 

IMC has not reviewed the ownership rights of the Project and agreements between Excelsior and 
others concerning the rights of Excelsior to explore on the Project. IMC has not verified any of the 
claim or exploration permit boundaries in the field but has reviewed the claim location 
documentation as provided by Excelsior. Excelsior has provided information regarding the 
property ownership of the Project within this report. 

IMC has not field reviewed the environmental situation at the property. IMC has assumed that any 
required permits for exploration are current. IMC has briefly field checked some of the drill hole 
locations and has not found any inconsistencies, and has reviewed data supplied by AzTech 
during AzTech's 2006 and 2007 field checking of drill hole locations. Excelsior has completed a 
differential global position survey (DGPS) for all holes in the resource. 

IMC has reviewed the proposed expenditure budgets of Excelsior and finds them to be reasonable 
but does not offer a professional opinion regarding the reliability of future Excelsior budgets or 
expenditure activity. 

IMC has not audited the metallurgical test work and has relied on the metallurgical review and 
conclusions by Dr. Roshan Bhappu of Mountain State R & D International, Inc.   Dr. Bhappu was a 
co-author with Herb Welhener of the June 2010 technical report titled "Gunnison Copper Project, 
Cochise County, Arizona, USA – Mineral Resource of the North Star and South Star Deposits".

4. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The properties are held by the James Sullivan Trust (dated November 24, 2004) either directly or 
via Delta Exploration Group LLC and Delta Exploration Holdings LLC, both 100% owned by the 
James Sullivan Trust (the "Trust"). These assets represent, among other things, the mineral rights 
to the North Star and South Star Copper deposits (the Gunnison Copper Project).  

Excelsior has an exclusive Option to acquire 100% of the title to the mineral interests that 
constitute the Gunnison Project located in Cochise County, Arizona, including all drill core, 
samples, reports, information and data, for $350,000 payable to the Trust on or before January 1, 
2013.  A further $300,000 is payable to certain land holders of the North Star deposit with 
$150,000 of the $300,000 due on exercise of the Option and the remaining $150,000 due on or 
before December 31, 2016.  The properties included in the Option Agreement that constitute the 
Project are described below and are shown on Figure 4.2. 

The Project is located in Cochise County, Arizona, approximately 65 miles east of Tucson and 1.5 
miles southeast of the historic Johnson Camp mining district. Figure 4-1 is a general location map 
and property location near the I-10 freeway.  The property includes portions of Section 35 and 36 
T15S R22E, Sections 1, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25, and 26 T16S R22E, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17 and 18 
T16S R23E, and Sections 29, 31 and 32 T15S R23E and is centered at 32o 04' 55" N latitude and 
110o 02' 40" W longitude.  Total area is approximately 6,405 acres (2,592 Ha).   

Figure 4-2 shows the claim status for the Gunnison Copper Project as of August 2011.  Table 4.1 
contains a summary of the land packages that constitute the Project.  Following Table 4.1 are brief 
descriptions of the claims, permits, deeds and land holdings. Appendix A contains a detailed list of 
all the mining claims and land packages.   

For the project to go into production Excelsior will need to apply for and receive a number of 
permits.  The environmental and permitting process involves, among other things, preparing a 
Mine Operating Plan (a BLM requirement), an Environmental Impact Statement for public comment 
and a Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan. In addition, several permits must be obtained, the most 
important of which are the Aquifer Protection Permit (a State requirement), the Underground 
Injection Control Permit (a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") requirement) and the Air 
Quality Permit (a State requirement). Currently, there are no known environmental liabilities for the 
Gunnison Copper Project.

Unpatented Mining Claims. 

There are 128 unpatented mining claims held in the name of Delta Exploration Holdings LLC 
totaling 1,753 acres (710 ha). A completed list of the claims is provided in Appendix A. The claims 
are administered by the US Bureau of Land Management and are for minerals only, that is, there 
is no surface ownership. Surface rights include the right to use the surface for exploration, mining, 
mineral processing and related activities subject to the General Mining Law of 1872 as amended 
and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Maintenance for the claims is limited 
to an annual fee of US$140 per claim for an annual total of $17,920 and all payments are current. 
The claims have no expiration dates and under current mining law can be held indefinitely if 
properly maintained. The claims are located on the ground and the location descriptions are filed 
with the US Bureau of Land Management. 

State Mineral Lease and Prospecting Permits. 

Delta Exploration Holdings LLC holds the Arizona State Mineral Lease and Prospecting Permits. 
The tenements are administered by the Arizona State Land Department and are for minerals only. 
Rents, fees and expenditure commitments are due each year and all payments and expenditure 
commitments are current. The 2011 expenditure commitment will be up to $36,541.30 with fees of 
up to $2,500.00.  A detailed list of these fees and the due dates is supplied in Appendix A. A state 
royalty is payable on state leases. The amount is set by the Arizona State Land Department for 
each lease based on an appraisal of "market royalty rates". The exact wording on the lease states 
"The Lessee further agrees to pay as royalty 5% of the gross value of all copper produced from 
the leased premises, until such time as Lessee submits certain geologic and economic 
information, to Lessor's satisfaction, sufficient for Lessor to formulate and replace the royalty rate 
set forth above, with a sliding scale royalty.  The sliding scale royalty shall be mutually agreed to in 
writing at the time Lessor agrees to institute it."   Mineral lease and prospecting permit boundaries

are described by the Arizona State Land Department. Surface rights include the right to use the 
surface for exploration, mining, mineral processing and related activities subject to a state 
approved Mineral Development Report or Exploration Plan as the case may be.  The mineral 
lease expires on June 15, 2014, however the lease may be renewed for an additional 20 year 
period if the lessee is in compliance with the terms of the lease. The individual expiration dates of 
the Prospecting Permits are shown in Appendix A and range from October 27, 2015 to June 30, 
2016.  There are provisions in the Arizona State mining law to retain the area held by the permits, 
subject to meeting certain state requirements, by converting the permits to mineral leases or by 
applying for new exploration permits. 

"Connie Johnson" Deed. 

Delta Exploration Group LLC owns the mineral rights in Section 31, T15S., R23E, subject to the 
provisions of the Deed of Trust dated January 22, 1998 between Delta Exploration Group LLC and 
the seller of the mineral rights. The area (approximately 616 acres or 249 ha) covers about 1/3 of 
the North Star deposit, is for the minerals only and is defined by the boundaries of Section 31, 
T15S.and R23E. The purchase cost, via a promissory note held in the Deed of Trust, is 
US$150,000 to be paid before the year 2016. The Deed of Trust also provides for a 6% "Net 
Proceeds" royalty up to a maximum of US$150,000. This royalty is payable in cash when Excelsior 
exercises the Option Agreement with the James Sullivan Trust on or before December 31, 2016. 
Mineral and surface rights are defined by the Deed of Trust and include "All mines and minerals in 
and under Section 31, Township 15 South, Range 23 East, Gila and Salt River Base and Meridian, 
containing 615.62 acres, more or less, together with the power to take all usual, necessary or 
convenient means for working, getting, laying up, dressing, making merchantable, and taking 
away the said mines and minerals, and also for the above purposes, or for any other purposes 
whatsoever, to make and repair tunnels and sewers, and to lay and repair pipes for conveying 
water to and from any manufactory or other building…". 

Fee Simple Land. 

Mineral and in some cases mineral and surface rights to a small portion of the South Star deposit 
are held directly by the James Sullivan Trust. Mineral rights only pertain to Parcel F (approximately 
15.3 acres), Section 25 T16S., R22E and Parcel A (approximately 39 acres), Section 19, T16S., 
R23E., Union Pacific Railroad that covers an easement along the Union Pacific Railroad. Surface 
and Mineral rights are held via Parcel D (approximately 14.24 acres), Section 19 T16S., R22E., 
and Parcel E (approximately 4.28 acres), Section 19 T16S., R23E. Holding costs for the fee 
simple land amount to approximately $32 per year in property taxes.  Property boundaries are 
defined by the property descriptions on public record.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHISIOGRAPHY 

The Gunnison Property is located in a sparsely populated, flat to slightly undulating ranching and 
mining area about 65 road miles east of Tucson, Arizona (Figures 4-1). Tucson metropolitan area 
is a major population center (approximately 1,000,000 persons) with a major airport and 
transportation hub and well developed infrastructure and services that support the surrounding 
copper mining and processing industry. The towns of Benson and Wilcox are nearby and 
combined with Tucson can supply sufficient skilled labor for the project.   

Access to the Gunnison Project is via the I-10 Freeway from Tucson and Benson in the west or 
Wilcox in the east.  The North Star deposit can be accessed via good quality dirt roads heading 
approximately 1 mile east from the south side of the "Thing" roadhouse on the Johnson Road exit 
from I-10.   

The area has well developed infrastructure for mining. The closest operating mining complex is 
Nord Resources' Johnson Camp mine located 1.5 miles to the north of the Gunnison project. Nord 
Resources has a SXEW plant. The Union Pacific Railway exists 3 miles south of the North Star 
deposit.  There is also access to electrical power on the property and the project could produce 
some of its own power through the sulfur burning process if this processing option is taken for the 
production of sulfuric acid. Abundant water is available in the area to support a mining operation 
and the deposit is saturated, below the water table, however the water requirements for the project 
have not been defined at this time.  There are sub-surface water sources available in particular the 
Dragoon water company, also owned by the James Sullivan Trust, that supplies water to the 
region. These along with the project water requirements will be evaluated during the pre-feasibility 
stage of the project. Potential SX-EW (Solvent Extraction – Electrowinning) plant sites are near 
roads and infrastructure on state permits northeast and south of the North Star deposit (Figure 4-
2). 

The project area encompasses about 10 square miles within Cochise County, Arizona and 
includes unpatented mining claims, private land, Arizona State Prospecting Permits, a single 
Arizona State Mineral Lease and direct ownership of mineral rights. Unpatented mining claims 
give the owner exclusive right to possess the ground (surface rights) covered by the claim, as well 
as the right to develop and exploit valuable minerals contained within the claim, so long as the 
claim is properly located and validly maintained. For the Fee simple lands both the land and 
mineral rights are owned by Jim Sullivan and the Connie Johnson Deed grants the mineral right to 
Jim Sullivan as well as access to mining.  The Arizona State Prospecting Permits gives lessee the 
right to explore and convert mineral discoveries to Arizona State Mineral Leases so long as the 
claim is validly maintained. Surface rights for the various land packages appear sufficient for 
Excelsior to conduct its mining operations, subject to applicable laws and permits particularly since 
the proposed mining is In Situ in nature and the surface footprint is comprised of the well fields 
over the deposit, a recovery plant and some tanks or ponds. 

The elevation on the property ranges from 4,600 to 4,900 feet above mean sea level in terrain of 
the eastern Basin and Range physiographic province of southeastern Arizona. The climate varies 
with elevation, but in general the summers are hot and dry and winters are mild. The area 
experiences two rain seasons in general, one during the winter months of December to March and 
a second summer season from July through mid September. The summer rains are typical 
afternoon thunderstorms that can be locally heavy. Average annual rainfall for Dragoon is 13.2 
inches and the average highs range from 58oF in January to 94oF in June.  Occasional light snow 
falls at higher elevations in the winter months. Exploration programs and mining activities operate 
year around in the region.

6. HISTORY 

There is no direct mining history of the North Star deposit, however the district has seen 
considerable copper, zinc, silver and tungsten mining beginning in the 1880's and extending to the 
present day.  Mining operations at Johnson Camp, just 1.5 miles north of North Star, are currently 
run by Nord Resources Corporation.  

Between 1882 and 1981, the Johnson Camp district, also known as the Cochise district, produced 
12 million tons of ore containing 146 million pounds of copper, 94 million pounds of zinc, 1.3 
million pounds of lead, 720 thousand ounces of silver and minor gold (Keith et. al., 1983).  

6.1.  Pre 1960 

The Johnson Camp mining district, also known as the Cochise mining district, the Bluebird 
mining district and the Dragoon mining district began with the mining of copper oxides pre 1880 
by Mexican miners (Cooper & Silver, 1964). With the advent of the Southern pacific railroad in 
1881, numerous claims were staked in the district; however by the late 1800's most of the 
surface oxide mineralization was mined out.  Sulfide copper production began around 1906 at 
Johnson and continued through to 1958 when low metal prices forced the closure of the last 
mines.  During this time considerable zinc was also mined from the district.  Most of the mining 
activity in the late 1940's to late 1950's was done by Coronado Copper and Zinc Company or 
the Keystone Copper Mining Company (Cooper & Silver, 1964).  

In 1898, tungsten was discovered in the district (Cooper & Silver, 1964) and by 1903, the 
Johnson-Dragoon area was one of the principal tungsten mining districts of the United States.  
Estimates of tungsten production range from 750 tons (Cooper & Silver, 1964) to over 6,550 
tons (Keith et. al., 1983). 

6.2.  1960 to 1979 

In the early 1960's, the Cyprus-Johnson mining company (related to Coronado Copper and 
Zinc Company) discovered low grade copper oxide mineralization at Johnson camp and later 
undertook copper oxide open pit, acid leach and electro-winning operations at Johnson from 
1975 to around 1985.   

By the 1960's it was recognized that economic, low-grade, copper skarn mineralization could 
be identified remotely and beneath overburden by magnetic highs related to the magnetite 
content of these mineralized bodies.  Using this technology a magnetic high south of Johnson 
was drilled in the 1960's and the North Star deposit was discovered.   

By the late 1960's, the North Star deposit was partly controlled by Cyprus and partly by private 
owners. In 1970 a division of the Superior Oil Company ("Superior") joint ventured into the 
northern half of the North Star deposit with Cyprus and the private owners (J. Sullivan, pers. 
Com.).  During the early 1970's Superior did most of the drilling and limited metallurgical 
testing on North Star and by early 1974 had defined several million tons of low-grade acid 
soluble copper mineralization.  During this time the southern portion of the North Start deposit 
was controlled by Quintana Minerals Corporation, who drilled several diamond holes and 
completed metallurgical testing. 

By the late 1970's, Superior had relinquished its rights to North Star, deciding instead to focus 
on oil and gas (J. Sullivan, pers. com.).  Cyprus maintained the ground holdings on North Star 
for a period of time but did very little work. In 1977 Cyprus handed most of the ground covering 
the North Star back to the private owners.

Exploration in the 1960's and 70's resulted in the discovery of the North Star deposit. The 
ultimate results of these exploration efforts were a non NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource 
calculation  for North Star by Superior (Table 9-3).  For pre-Excelsior exploration results, see 
sections 9.1, 10 and 11. 

6.3.  1980 to 1992 

By the early 1980's, Mr. Sullivan had gained full control of Section 6 of the North Star deposit 
and by 1991 had gained control of Section 31 and Section 36 via the State Mineral Lease.   

6.4.  1993 to 2000 

In 1993, Magma Copper Company ("Magma") optioned North Star from Mr. Sullivan. Magma 
drilled 8 holes, completed several metallurgical tests (some on six inch diameter core), 
undertook limited hydrological studies and calculated a copper oxide resource.  Magma's 
interest in the project was for in situ leaching of the copper oxide resource. Shortly after being 
acquired by BHP-Billiton, Magma (BHP) relinquished the project in 1997 due to low copper 
prices and competing interests. 

After Magma relinquished its option on North Star in 1997, Phelps Dodge Mining Company 
("Phelps Dodge") optioned the North star deposit, and in conjunction with Mr. Sullivan drilled 
several holes on the outskirts of the deposit. In 1998, before Phelps Dodge finished their 
investigation of both deposits, the company decided to focus it's exploration activities outside 
the continental US and handed both projects back to Mr. Sullivan (J. Sullivan, pers. com). 

In late 1998, a junior exploration company optioned the Project from Mr. Sullivan but by early 
1999, the relationship between the parties had deteriorated to the point where the option was 
dissolved with no physical work being done.  

Metallurgical test work completed by Magma that mimicked ISL indicated that acid 
consumption of 8 to 12 lbs of acid per lb of Cu and greater than 70% recovery is possible. 

6.5.  AzTech 

AzTech acquired an option over the project in May 2007.  Prior to this Steve Twyerould and 
AzTech had spent nearly two years compiling, summarizing and digitizing historical data and 
calculating new resources.  

AzTech conducted biological and anthropological surveys.  Nine lines of ground magnetic data 
were completed in June 2010 and were used by Excelsior to target further drilling.  A water 
table depth study was completed in June 2010.

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The deposits form part of the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range province.  The 
province is characterized by fault-bounded mountains, typically with large intrusive cores, 
separated by deep basins filled with Tertiary and Quaternary gravels (Fig 7-1). Generalized 
stratigraphy in the region of the deposits is shown in Table 7-1 below (Weitz, 1976, Clayton, 
1978).

7.1.  Regional Geology 

The Gunnison project lies on the eastern edge of the Little Dragoon Mountains (Fig 7-2).  The 
Little Dragoon Mountains are an isolated fault bounded up thrown block within the basin and 
range province in southeastern Arizona.  The ages of the rocks range from 1.4 billion years 
ago (Ga) Pinal Group schists to recent Holocene sediments.  The southern portion of the Little 
Dragoon Mountains consists predominately of the Tertiary Texas Canyon Quartz Monzonite 
whereas the Pinal Group schists and the Paleozoic sediments that host the regional copper 
(Cu) mineralization dominate the northern half.

(modified from Drewes et al, 2001) 

 
The oldest rocks in the area, the Pinal Group schists are composed of sandstones, shales and 
volcanic flows that have been metamorphosed to greenschist-amphibolite facies.  The 
Precambrian Apache Group unconformably overlies the Pinal Group Schists and is composed 
of conglomerates, shales and quartzite.  The Apache Group is then unconformably overlain by 
the Paleozoic rocks that host the mineralization including the Balsa, Abrigo, Martin and 
Escabrosa Formations.  Overlying the mineralized rocks are the Black Prince and Horquilla 
Limestones, Earp Formation and the Colina Limestone.  Holocene Alluvium has filled in the 
valleys.   

The Texas Canyon Quartz Monzonite is thought to be the source of the Cu mineralization and 
is porphyritic with potassium feldspar phenocrysts from 1 to 10 cm.  Livingston et. al. (1967) 
determined the age to be 50.3  2.5 million years (Ma) and Reynolds et. al. (1986) list eight

determinations ranging from 49.5 to 55.0 Ma.  The intrusion outcrops to the west of the North 
Star deposit. 

Several deformations have occurred in the area with the most relevant being the Laramide 
Orogeny that was related to the mineralization and the Basin and Range that has modified the 
topography to its current appearance.  Pre-Apache Group deformation of the Pinal Schist 
Group included isoclinal folding with steep to overturned fold axes with a general northeastern 
structural trend.  Minor deformations took place in the late Precambrian and post Paleozoic-pre 
Cretaceous.  The post Paleozoic - pre-Cretaceous deformation consisted of steep northeast to 
easterly striking faults with offsets up to hundreds of feet.   

The Laramide deformation was at right angles to the Pre Apache Group deformation with 
structures striking in a northwesterly direction.  Older faults were reactivated and modified and 
folding and thrust faulting are common features of the Laramide.  The Centurion Fault of 
Laramide age occurs south of the North Star deposit.   

Two episodes of block faulting have created the Tertiary Basin and Range topography that 
dominates the current landscape and postdates the mineralization.   

7.2.  North Star Geology   

The North Star deposit is covered by about 450 feet of un-mineralized alluvium, varying 
between 250 and 600 feet.  The mineralized Paleozoic host rocks below the alluvium strike 
approximately north-northwest and dip 20 to 45o towards the east.  Baker (1953) recognized 
three sets of faulting in the Johnson Camp area and have been interpreted in the North Star 
area.  These faults include "Northeaster" ( N 10o to 30o E striking with 70o to 75o dip to the SE), 
"Easter" ( N 60o E to S 60o E striking faults dipping 30o to 50o S and higher angle reverse faults 
dipping 75o S) and "Northwester" orientations (N 15o W strike with steep E or W dip).  Only 
minor displacements are thought to have occurred in the North Star area; however numerous 
sheared and brecciated faults generally filled with Cu oxide mineralization cut through the 
deposit.  Folding of the mineralized horizons at the north end of North Star may represent 
further targeting opportunities to the Northwest of North Star (Fig 7-2). 

The Paleozoic host rocks have been intruded by the Texas Canyon quartz monzonite along the 
western margin of the deposit. The intrusion has formed wide zones of calc-silicate and 
hornfels alteration as well as extensive low-grade copper sulfide mineralization within the 
Paleozoic rocks.  Metamorphic alteration grading outward from the stock includes; garnet-
wollastonite-idocrase, forsterite-diopside, tremolite and chlorite-talc (Kantor, 1977)(Fig 7-3).   
More specifically the Martin Formation grades from a wollastonite-diopside rich rock near the 
porphyry to a distal diopside-tremolite-actinolite assemblage and finally a dolomite.  The Abrigo 
has garnet-actinolite-epidote-diopside alteration with some biotite hornfels near the porphyry 
and this grades to a distal tremolite alteration leading into un-metamorphosed limey shale.  
Quartz-orthoclase-carbonate  magnetite and chalcopyrite veins are characteristic of the lower 
Abrigo. 

Copper oxide mineralization extends over a strike length of 9,800 feet, has an aerial extent 
across strike of up to 2,500 feet and is in places over 900 feet thick.  Figure 7-4 shows the plan 
view geology of the deposit and Figures 7-5 and 7-6 are east-west cross sections.  Note the 
thickness and continuity of the mineralization.  The north-south section view in Figure 7-7 also 
confirms the thickness and continuity of the mineralization.   

Copper sulfide mineralization has formed preferentially in the proximal (higher metamorphic 
grade) skarn facies, particularly along stratigraphic units such as the Abrigo and Martin 
Formations and within structurally complex zones. Primary mineralization occurs as stringers 
and veinlets of chalcopyrite and bornite.  Primary mineralization remains open at depth and to

the north and south. 

Oxidation of the mineralization occurs to a depth of approximately 1600 feet, resulting in the 
formation of chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, copper oxides and secondary chalcocite.  The bulk 
of the copper oxide mineralization occurs as malachite and/or chrysocolla that has formed as 
coatings on rock fractures and as vein fill (Figure 7-8).  The remainder of the oxide 
mineralization occurs as replacement patches and disseminations.

7.3.  Mineralization 

Within the project area the important mineralized host rocks include the Abrigo and Martin 
Formations and to a lesser extent the Horquilla Limestone and the lower parts of the Escabrosa 
Limestone.  Mineralization is also found in the Bolsa Quartzite. The Martin Formation grades from 
a wollastonite-diopside rich rock near the porphyry to a distal diopside-tremolite-actinolite 
assemblage and finally a dolomite.  The Abrigo has garnet-actinolite-epidote-diopside alteration 
with some biotite hornfels near the porphyry and this grades to a distal tremolite alteration leading 
into unmetamorphosed limey shale. Copper mineralization is related to calc-silicate skarns that 
have formed within these carbonate rocks adjacent to the Texas Canyon quartz monzonite 
("TQM").  

Copper oxide mineralization extends over a strike length of 9,800 ft, has an aerial extent across 
strike of up to 2,500 ft and is in places over 900 feet thick.  Figure 7-4 shows the plan view 
geology of the deposit and Figures 7-5 and 7-6 are east-west cross sections.  Note the thickness 
and continuity of the mineralization.  The north-south section view in Figure 7-7 also confirms the 
thickness and continuity of the mineralization.   

Copper sulfide mineralization has formed preferentially in the proximal (higher metamorphic grade) 
skarn facies, particularly along stratigraphic units such as the Abrigo and Martin Formations and 
within structurally complex zones. There are three types of sulfide mineralization occurrences 
within the skarns.  In decreasing order of abundance these are fracture coatings and vein filings, 
disseminations and in distinct quartz-orthoclase-carbonate  magnetite and chalcopyrite veins 0.2 
to 10 cm wide (Weitz, 1976). These veins have retrogressive haloes of chlorite, actinolite and 
epidote.   

Texturally pyrite and magnetite are later than and replace the skarn minerals and chalcopyrite 
formed last.  The magnetite occurs as disseminated 0.2 to 0.5 mm euhedral to anhedral grains 
and is closely associated with pyrite. Ninty percent of the magnetite is in the skarns and may 
compose up to five percent by volume of the rock.  The disseminated magnetite and magnetite 
bearing veins are most likely what is giving the magnetic response for the deposit (Colburn and 
Perry, 1976).  Primary mineralization remains open at depth and to the north and south.  

Primary chalcopyrite-molybdenite disseminations and veins also occur in the mineralized porphyry 
below and to the west of the skarn mineralization at North Star.  Only six drill holes intersected the 
quartz monzonite over significant lengths (lengths over 100 feet, 30m), most were mineralized with 
a best interval of 289 ft (88m) at 0.31% Cu and 0.028% Mo including 30 ft (10m) at 1.35% Cu. 
This mineralization has never been fully assessed.   

Both oxide and sulfide mineralization exhibits strong fracture control. This fracturing and faulting 
are best developed in terms of width and close spacing in a zone around the intrusive contact and 
this decreases away from the intrusive contact in the less altered rocks to the east.  The initial 
formation of the skarn created denser minerals and removed CO2 resulting in a volume reduction 
of the rocks, which in turn created significant fracturing, and therefore an increase of porosity and 
permeability allowing the later copper mineralization access.  Weitz (1976) calculated a 30% 
volume reduction in the metamorphosed Abrigo and Martin formations at North Star.   

Oxidation of the mineralization occurs to a depth of approximately 1600 feet, resulting in the 
formation of chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, copper oxides and secondary chalcocite.  The bulk of 
the copper oxide mineralization occurs as malachite and/or chrysocolla that has formed as 
coatings on rock fractures and as vein fill (Figure 7-8).  The remainder of the oxide mineralization 
occurs as replacement patches and disseminations. 

The morphology of the mineralization at North Star is predominately a large flat blanket 
presumably hugging a paleo water table (Figure 7-12).  The mineralization is fairly uniform in 
distribution, however there are some large higher grade 1% Cu pods within the overall mineralized

Regionally high grade Cu skarn mineralization is known to exist (Cooper and Silver, 1964).

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

The North Star and deposit is a classic Cu Skarn deposits (Einaudi et al, 1980 and Meinert et al, 
2005). Skarn deposits range in size from a few million to 500 million tones and are globally 
significant, particularly in the American Cordillera.  They can be stand alone Cu skarns which are 
generally small or can be associated with mineralized porphyry Cu deposits and tend to be very 
large.  The North Star deposit is a large (+750 million tones combined sulfide and oxide resource) 
being at the upper end of the range of size for skarn deposits and are associated with a 
mineralized porphyry Cu system that has been virtually unexplored. 

These deposit types generally form in calcareous shales and dolomites to limestones around or 
adjacent the mineralizing porphyry.  Significant mineralizing Cu rich hydrothermal fluids are 
focused along structurally complex and fractured rocks and convert the calcareous shales and 
limestones to andradite rich garnet assemblages near the intrusive body and to pyroxene and 
wollastonite rich assemblages at areas more distal to the stock.  Retrograde hydrothermal fluids 
produce actinolite-tremolite-talc-silica-epidote-chlorite assemblages.  The mineralization is typically 
pyrite-chalcopyrite-magnetite nearer the mineralizing porphyry and chalcopyrite-bornite more 
distally from the body.  The classic Cu porphyry-skarn model by Sillitoe, 1989 is being used for the 
deposit (Figure  8-1).  The model basically entails exploring magnetic anomalies (potential skarns) 
around magnetically quiet areas (Cu porphyry).   

No mining or processing of the resources has occurred, although similar mineralization has been 
successfully mined just 1.5 miles north at Johnson Camp (Nord Resources Corporation).  
Regionally Cu-Zn skarns dominate and have been historically mined from the Republic, Copper 
Chief and Mammoth mines from underground operations (Baker, 1953).  These Cu-Zn rich skarns 
are probably more distal to the mineralized porphyry, whereas the North and South Star skarns 
contain only Cu and are proximal to the mineralized porphyry system. Tungsten and minor lead-
silver-gold have also been produced in the district (Cooper and Silver, 1964)

9. EXPLORATION 

9.1.  Historic Exploration 

In the 1960's, it was recognized that economic, low-grade, copper skarn mineralization could be 
identified remotely by magnetic highs related to the magnetite content of these mineralized bodies.  
As result a magnetic high south of Johnson was drilled in the 1960's and the North Star deposit 
was discovered.  Since North Star's discovery numerous companies have explored the area (see 
Section 6).  During this time period extensive drilling and assaying, magnetic and IP surveys, 
metallurgical testing, hydrological studies, In-situ Leach (ISL) tests and preliminary mine design 
and evaluations have occurred.  The focus since the 70's has been to utilize ISL or a combination 
of ISL and open pits as a potential mining strategy. 

The USGS completed an aeromagnetic survey flown at ½ to 1 mile spacing in 1947.  CF&I flew an 
aeromagnetic survey at a ¼ mile spacing in 1968 (Brooks and Gillespie, 1969).  An IP and SP 
survey was also conducted by CF&I in 1968 and was determined these methods to be of little 
value due to the thick oxidation profile.   

Historic resource estimates for the North Star mineralization were completed by Phelps Dodge in 
1998 and Superior Oil and Gas in 1974 (these are historical estimates only and are not compliant 
with CIM definitions and may therefore not be relied upon) (Table 9-1). These previous non NI 43-
101 compliant estimates for North Star generated more tons and grade than AzTech's 2010 
mineral resource estimated (Welhener, 2010), suggesting the current estimate in Section 17 is 
conservative.

9.2.  Work by AzTech 

Steve Twyerould first became involved with the Gunnison Project in mid 2005 and later AzTech 
became involved in mid 2006.  Significant work has been completed since that time. A large 
component of this work has involved cataloguing, reviewing and compiling high-quality historical 
data spanning over thirty years of investigations by Superior Oil and Gas, Cyprus, Quintana, CF&I, 
Magma Copper Corporation, Phelps Dodge and James Sullivan. This process has involved 
building a digital database, verifying historic data, re-interpreting the geology in 3D, calculating a 
new resource and compiling numerous technical documents. Individual Due Diligence items are 
listed below. 

 Locate, compile and review previous work. 
 Locate and re-survey existing holes using GPS. 
 Re-survey portions of the Project boundaries. 
 Geological mapping. 
 Locate and examine existing drill core and validate against existing drill logs.

 Geological logging of existing drill core. 
 Acid reactivity testing of drill core. 
 Entering data into a digital database, validating, manipulating and analyzing this data. 
 Completion of a new three dimensional (3D) geological interpretation. 
 Validation of the geological interpretation against previous geological interpretations. 
 Independent resource calculation and reporting using 3D block modeling and the geology

 Interview and review sessions the principle Magma and Phelps Dodge geologist that 

worked on the project in the 1990's. 
 Review and summarize past metallurgical test work. 
 Interview with past metallurgists. 
 Complete basic metallurgical tests verifying applicability of sulfurous acid. 
 Complete a basic financial analysis on in-situ mining using expert input. 
 Review and validate geophysical and geochemical data and reports. 
 Complete target analysis and formulate exploration strategy. 

AzTech conducted biological surveys and found that no federally listed endangered, threatened, 
proposed and candidate species occur in the survey area from their known distribution and range.  
In addition, the survey area does not contain suitable habitat necessary for survival or life history 
requirements of these species.  Anthropological surveys conducted by AzTech indicated only 
random artifacts were present and occasional clusters of artifact scatters outside of the area of 
mineralization.  No burial sites or significant cultural sites were identified. 

In addition, AzTech conducted detailed ground magnetics over the exploration targets in June 
2011.  A water table depth study was also completed in June 2010.   

9.3.  Excelsior Exploration 

In December 2010 Excelsior initiated a re-logging program that is anticipated to be complete in the 
third quarter of 2011.  In addition a re-assaying program began in March 2011 during which all of 
the  MCC (Magma Copper) holes were re-assayed.  Prior to the re-assay historical CS holes that 
had both total copper (TCu) and acid soluble (AsCu) results were re-split and checked at Skyline 
Labs in Tucson.  The results are described in Section 12.  In May 2011, a re-assay program was 
initiated for the Quintana Minerals holes (DC,S and T series) to include sequential Cu analysis.  
Previous results only included TCu assays. 

Down hole geophysics was conducted on the majority of holes where permitted.  Due to bad 
ground conditions some holes were un-surveyable and the total depths of the surveys were often 
shortened. Data collected includes temperature, caliper log, sonic log and acoustic televiewer.  
The data are still in the process of being analyzed and evaluated.    

A regional groundwater study was completed in April, 2011 by compiling available data for the 
region surrounding the deposit. Groundwater movement is largely to the east and southeast of the 
deposit.   

The results and interpretations of the work completed by (or commission by) Excelsior are 
contained in the various technical sections of this report.  It isIMC's view that these results and 
interpretations are reasonable.

9.4.  Future Exploration Plan 

Future work will include a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) based on the current mineral 
resource.  Additional work will be incorporated into the PEA (see below). For details see section 
26 (Recommendations). 

 Initiate modern metallurgical testing with the results to be incorporated into the PEA. 

 Initiate hydrological testing of the mineralization with the results to be incorporated into the 
PEA. 

 Complete structural interpretation for the deposit using down hole geophysical data 

 Continue re-logging and re-assaying historical core to improve the validity of the historical 
data as well as the interpretation.

10. DRILLING 

10.1. Historical Drilling 

Previous drilling has been completed by several companies for North Star as shown in Table 10-1.  
Drilling extends to a depth of approximately 2450ft below surface at North Star.  The number of 
assay results for the 88 holes drilled by previous owners is shown in Table 10-2. 

The drill holes are vertical and the mineralization ranges from flat lying to a 30o dip to the east 
resulting in a 1 to 1 relationship between sample length and true thickness to a 1 to 0.87 
relationship between sample length and true thickness depending on the dip of the mineralization 
(Fig. 7-5 and 7-6).

Sampling of the deposits has been completed by various companies using diamond drill core 
spaced relatively evenly over the aerial extent of the deposits (see Figure 10-1 for North Star 
deposit). Drilling within the North Star resource covers an area of approximately 310 acres (125 
ha) with additional drilling extending beyond this area. There is a slightly higher density of drilling 
down the central high-grade axis of the North Star deposit.  This higher density of drilling is not 
likely to generate a bias in the resource estimate as the resource estimate takes into account drill-
hole location and spacing when assigning grade within the block model. Table 10-3 list all drill hole 
intersections used to calculate the oxide portion of the North Star inferred mineral resource for 
AzTech in June 2010.  Drill core recovery has been good with the exception of individual fault 
zones of a few meters in length.  Intervals in Table 10-3 are approximately true width due to the 
flat lying nature of the oxide portion of the deposit.

* Indicates hole finished in good mineralization. ** Indicates hole has limited sampling and is not representative. 

 

Sampling of the drill core has been on irregular down-hole intervals based on geology using a half 
core split. For the most part the entire mineralized intersections have been sampled without any 
indication of bias towards "high-grading" the sampling. Individual down-hole sample intervals range 
from less than 2 feet to about 30 feet.  Tables 10-4 show the range of sample intervals in the data 
base for North Star.  Samples intervals larger than 25 feet generally represent sample intervals in 
the overburden (composite chip sampling).  The sample interval statistics below are for the entire 
data base, sample interval statistics change when only the intervals used in the resource 
estimations are considered, these intervals are discussed in Section 12. The sampling method and 
distribution of sampling appears representative and does not appear to have generated any bias.

Samples have mostly been assayed at commercial laboratories using best practice sampling and 
analytical techniques at the time. The list of commercial or in-house laboratories used is contained 
in Table 10-5.  All laboratories are located in Arizona.

To the best of the author's knowledge, there is nothing related to the historic drilling and sampling 
protocol that could adversely impact the accuracy or reliability of the results. 

10.2. Excelsior Drilling 

Twenty diamond holes were completed for 33,793 feet (10,300m) from December 2010 to May 
2011 (Table 10-6, Figure 10-2).  6 ¼ inch pre-collars were drilled to the base of alluvium (100 to 
700 feet) and then cased with 4 ½ inch steel casing. HQ diamond core tails were drilled up to a 
depth of 2000 feet and where required the core was downsized to NQ.  Of the 20 holes drilled, 19 
had been assayed for inclusion into the mineral resource estimate included in Section 14. 

The drill holes are mostly vertical and the mineralization ranges from flat lying to a 30o dip to the 
east resulting in a 1 to 1 relationship between sample length and true thickness to a 1 to 0.87 
relationship between sample length and true thickness depending on the dip of the mineralization 
(Fig. 7-5 and 7-6).  

Interpretation of the drilling was done by completing east-west geological cross sections that 
include interpretations of the oxide and sulfide mineralized zones (see Section 7).  These were 
then used to create a 3-D model of the deposit used in the categorization of the resource 
calculation in Section 14.

Core recovery was very high (average of 96.3%) with only rare occurrences of poor recovery due 
to discrete structures and or narrow voids.  Selected intervals shown in Table 10-7 are 
approximately true width due to the flat lying nature of the oxide portion of the deposit.

10.3. Excelsior Sampling Method and Approach 

The core handling process involved several steps including: 

 The driller places the core into core boxes. 

 The core boxed are stacked on pallets, strapped, and transported to the Excelsior core storage 
facility in Casa Grande, Arizona. 

 Presentation and cleaning of the core: 

o The core was laid out to ensure all boxes were present, correctly labeled and 
adequately cleaned before being processed. 

 Measure core loss: 

o Core loss was measured from core block to core block (drill run) and recorded.   

 Measure RQD 

o RQD measurements were taken for the whole of the core recovered.  At the drill site 
core broken by the drillers was marked and taken into account in the RQD process. 

 Log core 

o Core was logged using the Excelsior legend into Access logging sheets and then 
forwarded on to the database administrator.   

 Mark up the core for splitting 

o The geologist marked up the core for splitting prior to photographing the core. 

 Photograph core 

o The core was photographed both wet and dry prior to splitting. 

 Magnetic susceptibility readings 

o Magnetic susceptibility readings were taken the correlated with sampled intervals. 

 Density 

o Density measurements using classic water displacement methods were taken that 
correlate with the sampled intervals.  The core was not wrapped or waxed for the 
density measurements. 

 Split core 

o Samples were split using hydraulic splitters and bagged for shipment to the assay lab. 
Care is taken to ensure that no bias is introduced into the splitting by observing the 
mineralization in the core and splitting appropriately.  The fines that are produced are 
also manually split and sampled.

11. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1. Historical 

All of the drilling, sample preparation and analysis of the samples presented in this report was 
under the control of the previous property owners. 

The laboratory sample preparation and analysis procedures used by the previous owners of the 
deposits are unknown; however, major commercial laboratories using best practice at the time 
completed the majority of analyses ( see Table 10-5).  

The data, information, samples and core (collectively, the "Information and Samples") from the 
deposits have been under the control and security of AzTech Minerals since November 2006 and 
then Excelsior since October 2010. The original Information and Samples are stored at Mr. James 
Sullivan's core storage facility ("Core Facility") in Casa Grande, with numerous copies held by 
Excelsior at its Phoenix, Arizona office.   

Prior to November 2006, the Information and Samples were under the control and security of Mr. 
James Sullivan, stored at his Core Facility from dates ranging from 1970's to 2006.   

Magma Copper Corporation had security and control of it's own Information and Samples from 
approximately 1993 to 1997, after which Magma relinquished control to James Sullivan who 
relocated all Information and Samples to his Core Facility. 

Phelps Dodge maintained it's own Information and Samples until 1998, after which time they were 
transferred to James Sullivan and were relocated to his Core facility. 

The bulk of the Information and Samples collected by Superior, Cyprus and Quintana in the 1970's 
to 1980's were handed over to James Sullivan and relocated to his Core Facility between 1980 
and 1998.  

For the most part, James Sullivan has maintained sole security over the Information and Samples 
since the early 1980's. Figure 11-1 shows the Core facility in Casa Grande.

11.2.1. Sample Preparation and Handling 

The core is logged by the geologist with the Gunnison Project geological legend using 
customized Microsoft Soft Access data entry forms.  Rock Quality Data (RQD) and 
magnetic susceptibility readings are also taken and recorded in the Access form.  The core 
is photographed wet and dry.  Specific Gravity measurements are also taken. 

For each drill hole, all original digital data files are organized individual folders and stored 
on a local field server computer.  The field server data is continuously synchronized to the 
Vancouver office server for offsite data backup purposes and to make the data available to 
the project data manager.  Drill hole data files are imported into the master drill database 
on a daily basis. 

The sampling procedure is as follows: 

o Assay tickets are placed at the start of the assay interval.   

o Sample intervals are recorded within the Access form as well as written within the ticket 
books.

o All skarn and porphyry units are sampled.  Additional sampling of rock 
types/mineralization is left up to the discretion of the geologist, consulting with senior 
staff. 

o Sample intervals are based on lithologic boundaries and are not be taken across the 
boundary with the following exceptions: 

 short intervals (~<1 foot) can be included within a larger sample where isolating 
the unit would be problematic, 

 thin lithologic units can be included within a larger sample when sampling such 
a unit is impractical. 

o Sample length is 10 feet within all rock types.  It is understood that irregular sample 
lengths may be needed at geological boundaries. 

o In areas of poor ground conditions or poor recovery, sample lengths may extend up to 
20 feet due to unknowns regarding the correct footage since the only known distance 
marker is the footage block placed by drillers. 

o Single samples will not be taken.  Samples must be bracketed on either side by an 
additional sample. 

o Exceptions can and will occur when areas of high mineralization do occur, at such 
times it will be up to the judgment of the geologist to determine sample intervals. 

The QAQC process is as follows: 

Excelsior submits samples to Skyline Labs in batches which often include an entire hole.  
The following protocol is used for the inclusion of standards, blanks and duplicate samples 
for assay. 

 
A) Batches with greater than (>) 30 samples 

 
A standard, blank or duplicate is inserted on every tenth sample (any sample ending in a 
zero) in the following order; 

 
Standard 
Blank 
Standard 
Duplicate 

 
The cycle repeats thus ensuring 10% of samples submitted are control samples. 

 
B) Batches with less than ( <) 30 samples 

 
A minimum of two standards and a blank are required for the sample series.  This will 
result in>10% control samples for the drill hole.  It is at the discretion of the geologist where 
to place the control samples within the sequence, preferable evenly spaced through the 
sequence (control samples are NOT to be placed back to back within the sample 
sequence). 
 
Check sample: 
 
Five percent of samples were selected randomly from the entire analytical range and split

from the original pulp and sent to an outside laboratory (ALS, Reno, NV).   
 
In addition, during the drill program a selection of 30 reject samples had 2 pulp samples 
prepared labeled A and B (ALS). The A and B series were assayed at Skyline labs and 
ALS. 
 
Specific Gravity process: 
 
Specific Gravity measurements are taken for every assay sample in zones of 
mineralization and every 10 feet outside of mineralized zones.  The geologist makes the 
determination on where SG measurements are taken with regard to mineralized and non 
mineralized material.  The procedure is the water displacement method on whole core 
samples which are not wrapped or waxed for the measurements. 
 
For measurements of specific gravity (SG), a quartz (2.645 sg) and marble (2.71 sg) 
standard were used alternatively every 20 samples for quality control of the SG 
measurements.  Readings outside of acceptable limits resulted in all samples back to the 
previous successful standard measurement being repeated.  Duplicates were measured 
every 20 samples. 

11.2.2. Assay method and Analysis 

Skyline Labs in Tucson, AZ were used for the analysis.  Skyline is accredited with 
international standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 General Requirements for the Competence of 
Testing and Calibration Laboratories. Total Cu (TCu), acid soluble Cu (ASCU) and cyanide 
soluble Cu (CNCu) were analyzed.  Where molybdenum was present was also assayed for.  
Excelsior has no relationship with Skyline Labs other than Skyline being a service provider.   

ALS Minerals laboratories in Reno, NV were used for the check sample analysis.  Most 
ALS Minerals laboratories are registered or are pending registration to ISO 9001:2008, and 
a number of analytical facilities have received ISO 17025 accreditations for specific 
laboratory procedures. Total Cu (TCu), acid soluble Cu (ASCU) and cyanide soluble Cu 
(CNCu) were analyzed.  Excelsior has no relationship with ALS Minerals other than ALS 
Minerals being a service provider.   

Sample preparation: 

Samples are lined up and coded into Skylines system.  Any missing, illegible or damaged 
samples are reported.  Washed river rock is used to clean the crusher between samples.  
Samples are crushed to 70-80% minus 10 mesh.  The sample is then split and recombined 
3 times and 250 to 280 grams of material are split to create the pulp.  The split sample is 
then pulverized for 1 ½ to 2 minutes to 95% passing 150 mesh.   

Total Cu analysis (TCu): 

Samples are digested in hydrochloric, nitric and perchloric acids. This solution is taken to 
dryness. The contents are treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the solution is 
brought to a final volume of 200 mL with de-ionized water. Solutions are read by Atomic 
Absorption using Standard Reference Materials made up in 5% Hydrochloric Acid. 
 
Sequential Analysis, Acid Soluble Cu (AsCu) and Cyanide Soluble Cu (CNCu):

Samples are digested in 5% sulfuric acid and supernatant solution is diluted to 
100 mL with de-ionized water. The residue is digested in 10% sodium cyanide 
solution and diluted to 100 mL. The AsCu samples are read on Atomic Absorption units 
using 0.5% H2SO4 calibration standards. The CNCu samples are read on Atomic 
Absorption units using 1% NaCN calibration standards. 

11.2.3. Security 

On site drilling was 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  Core was stored at the drill rig 
supervised by both the driller and the site geologist.  The drilling occurred on isolated ranch 
land behind a locked gate limiting the access from anyone from the public. The core was 
placed on pallets and banded for pick up by Pinch Express.  A transfer form was signed by 
both parties upon pickup and delivery of the core to Excelsior's core shed facilities in Casa 
Grande.  Once in Casa Grande the core was stored in a locked facility.   

After splitting the core and placing the samples in storage bins, Skyline Labs was contacted 
to pick up the samples.  A chain of custody form was signed and the samples were turned 
over to Skyline Labs.   

The information and data are stored on secure servers in both the core shed in Casa 
Grande as well as at Excelsior's office in Vancouver.   

11.2.4. Author's Opinion 

It is the opinion of IMC that the sample procedures, processes and security are reasonable 
and adequate. 

12. DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1   Historic Data 

During the author's site visit in 2007, a number of the drill hole locations were checked with a hand 
held GPS and found to reasonably match the recorded collar coordinated.  During the authors visit 
to the core storage in Casa Grande, it was noted that there are some original certificates of assay 
available in the files.  The author has not independently checked the database with the original 
certificates of assay.  Database checks were completed and documented by Excelsior (then 
AzTech).  The author has reviewed the documentation and the procedure used to assimilate and 
verify the database and finds the work to be reasonable. 

No data are presently available on assaying procedures of historic assay results, however all 
assays were performed by reputable commercial laboratories with the exception of Magma 
Copper Company's assays that were performed at their San Manuel laboratory.  It can reasonably 
be presumed that the commercial laboratories were competent and used best practices at the 
time.  

The North Star data base contains assays from a number of earlier drilling campaigns that date 
back to 1956, and no original check assay or other QAQC data are available for these campaigns. 
Two approaches have been used to check the representativeness of the assays from these earlier 
drilling campaigns – repeat assays run on original pulps and pulps prepared from fresh core splits, 
and paired comparisons of the grades and grade distributions measured in different hole series.

12.1.1. Repeat Assays 

 
After compiling data from different sources IMC identified the following sets  of tcu and ascu repeat 
assays run on samples from older drilling campaigns.  All of the repeat assays were run by 
Skyline, which is the lab that ran the assays on the Excelsior's 2011 NSD hole samples: 
 

1.) 519 Skyline assays on fresh pulps prepared from core from holes MCC-1 through 6 

2.) 80 Skyline assays on old Magma pulps from holes MCC-1, 2, 4 and 5 

3.) 40 Skyline assays on fresh pulps prepared from core from holes CS-02 and 06 

4.) 101 Skyline assays on fresh pulps prepared from core from holes T-01 and 05 

5.) 112 Skyline assays on old SW Assayers pulps from holes T-01 and 02 

6.) 101 Skyline assays on old American Analytical pulps from holes SD-17, 30 and 40 in 
the South Star (Dragoon) area. 

 
The Skyline repeat assays on the MCC samples (data sets 1 and 2) identified severe repeatability 
problems with the original Magma assays, and for this reason the Magma total copper (tcu) and 
acid soluble (ascu) assays were removed from the database used for the current mineral resource 
estimate.  For a subsequent estimate of tcu and ascu mineralization in the block model ,the 
original MCC assays were replaced in their entirety with the Skyline assays from data set 1 before 
grades were estimated in the check model. The Figure 12-1 is a XY plot, which compares the 
Skyline tcu assays with the original Magma tcu assays, illustrates the repeatability problem.  
 
The 40 Skyline repeat tcu and ascu assays on fresh pulps for CS-hole core (data set 3) are 
compared with the original CS assays in the Figures 12-2 and 12-3 XY plots.  The CS mean tcu is 
13% higher than Skyline mean tcu (0.42 versus 0.37%) and CS mean ascu is 10% higher (0.23 
versus 0.21%). These results indicate that CS may be biased high relative to Skyline for tcu and 
ascu, but the number of pairs is too small and the scatter of points too large to confirm that a 
systematic bias is present. However, the mean ascu/tcu ratios are the same (0.54) in both sample 
sets, indicating that the Skyline and CS hole ascu assays are not skewed relative to each other by 
different ascu assaying procedures (the NSD ascu assays are also from Skyline). This increases 
confidence in the ascu estimates in the block model, which are over 90% based on NSD and CS 
ascu assays. 
 
The 101 Skyline repeat tcu assays on fresh pulps prepared from core splits from T-01 and T-05 
(data set 4) are compared with the original assays in Figure 12-4 (ascu assays were not run in the 
T holes). Mean T-hole tcu is 11% higher than mean Skyline tcu (0.23 versus 0.21%), but again the 
scatter of points is too large to confirm that a systematic bias is present.  As shown in Figure 12-5, 
however, the 112 Skyline repeat tcu assays on original Southwest Assayers T-hole pulps (data set 
5) show no indication of bias, matching the original assays to within a percent.  
 
The 101 Skyline repeat assays on pulps from the SD holes at South Star (data set 6) are outside 
the North Star area, but they were run on American Analytical pulps from the 1970s, which is 
when most of the older North Star holes (CS, T, J and S) were drilled. They therefore act as an 
indirect check on the assaying procedures in use at this time.

The XY plots for the tcu and ascu comparisons are shown in Figures 12-6 and 12-7. The tcu 
match is almost exact.  The ascu match shows Skyline biased about 7% high relative to American 
Analytical, but  this could well be a result of oxidation of sulfide copper minerals in the pulps over 
time. Overall the results confirm that the acid soluble digestion procedures used by American 
Analytical and Skyline return comparable ascu values.

12.1.2. Hole Series Comparisons 

The repeat assay run by Skyline on old pulps and core samples indicate that the T hole tcu grades 
are probably verifiable, but there are not enough checks to verify the CS-hole tcu and ascu assays 
and there are no checks at all on samples from the other hole series.   

Paired comparisons of individual 25ft composites from the different hole series were tabulated to 
obtain more information. The underlying concept is that if mean grades and grade distributions in 
the different hole series are substantially the same it can be assumed a) that there are no large 
grade biases between the series and b) that the assays are globally representative of true grades, 
since it is unlikely that all the series will be biased by the same amount in the same direction. This 
approach does not validate individual assays or groups of assays, but give confidence that they 
are representative and can be included for grade estimation.    

Tcu comparisons were performed with the hole series divided into four main groups – the 
NSD/MCC holes (both now with Skyline assays), the CS holes, the T holes and the "Other" holes 
(D, DC, J, JD, JS, K, S and SULLY). The NSD/MCC holes contain 38% of the 25ft composites 
used to estimate tcu in the model, the CS holes 29%, the T holes 22% and the Other holes 12%. 
Pairing was conducted out to a limiting distance of 500ft, with individual composites paired only 
once.  

Each hole series was compared with the combined data from the other three series, giving four tcu 
comparisons. The results are summarized in Table 12-1 and in Figures 12-8 through 12-11 ("Feet" 
shows the total footage of assaying in the two data sets being compared, with each pair 
representing two 25ft composites, or approximately 50ft of assaying)

Mean tcu grades agree to within 6% or better in all cases. Grade distributions are similar in the last

Ascu/tcu ratio comparisons were performed with the hole series divided into three main groups – 
the NSD/MCC/T holes (all with Skyline assays), the CS holes and the "Other" holes (the T holes 
have no ascu assays).  The NSD/MCC/T holes contain 55% of the 25ft composites used to 
estimate ascu/tcu in the model, the CS holes 40% and the Other holes 6%. The results are 
summarized in Table 12-2 and in Figures 12-12 through 12-15:

Mean ascu/tcu ratios and ratio distributions compare quite well except in the case of the Other vs. 
NSD/MC/CS comparison, where the Other hole ratios are biased 19% high on average relative to 
the NSD/CS/T hole ratios. This bias could indicate that the ascu assay procedures in the Other 
holes were more aggressive or it could simply be an artifact of hole location (the comparison 
includes only 79 pairs). Even if a bias exists, it would not be a matter of serious concern because 
the Other holes contain only 6% of the ascu composites in the data base.  If samples from the 
Other holes exist, further work is recommended to investigate the differences.

12.2. Excelsior Drill Data 

 
Excelsior's assaying is performed by Skyline Labs in Tucson. Assaying and QAQC procedures 
were industry-standard. Details are given in Excelsior's sample preparation_extracted_2011.doc. 
file and summarized in Section 11.2.1. 

The tcu assays run on Standard AMS0118 are consistent with time and within acceptable limits 
(mean 0.466, standard deviation 0.010). Except for a single sample (NSD-08, 780ft) the ascu 
assays that were run at the same time are also consistent (mean 0.159, standard deviation 0.008). 
However, it is not known how they compare with the AMS0118 Standard grade because no 
Standard grade is given for ascu (in part because each lab has different procedures for an ascu 
assay). 

Assays were run on duplicate samples prepared from fresh core splits during the QAQC program. 
The comparisons for tcu and ascu are shown in the Figure 12-16 and 12-17 XY plots. The plots 
show scatter but no indication of any systematic bias between the original and the duplicate 
assays. 

Selected pulps prepared by Skyline from NSD-hole samples were also sent to ALS Chemex for 
tcu and ascu check assays during the QAQC program. The Chemex tcu and ascu check assays 
are compared with the Skyline original assays in Figures 12-18 and 12-19. Mean Skyline tcu is 6% 
higher than mean Chemex tcu (0.293 versus 0.275%) and the clustering of pairs on the Skyline 
side of the 1:1 line confirms that this difference is a result of a small but systematic bias between 
Skyline and Chemex. The ascu comparison shows similar results. Again, however, the data sets 
give the same mean ascu/tcu ratios (0.54 Skyline, 0.55 Chemex). 

The 6% difference between the Skyline and the Chemex assays does not invalidate the Skyline 
assays, but additional work should be done to determine the cause of this bias.  Excelsior has 
started this research and determined that the two labs use different procedures for both tcu and 
ascu assaying, which could explain the difference. 

IMC recommended that future check assaying be done, including that a check lab prepare a new 
pulp from coarse reject material and this pulp be assayed by both the check and original labs.  
This will act as a check on both sample preparation and assaying procedures.  Excelsior has 
completed this program for a 30 sample batch and IMC will review this data as part of its ongoing 
program with Excelsior. 

Cyanide soluble assays were not reviewed. However, they should be run as a matter of course in 
any new drilling programs and also on any un-assayed samples from previous drilling. The cncu 
assays run to date suggest that a small but significant fraction of the material that does not report 
to an ascu assay consists of potentially-leachable secondary sulfides.  

Based on its reviews of the available repeat, check, duplicate, standard and blank assays, and on 
paired comparisons of assay data from different drilling campaigns, IMC considers that the tcu and 
ascu assays used to estimate grades in the North Star model are acceptable for estimating 
resources in accordance with 43-101 guidelines.

13. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Dr. Roshan B. Bhappu of Mountain States R & D International, Inc has completed an independent 
report (Bhappu, 2007) on the metallurgical aspects of the Gunnison Cu project with special 
emphasis on the application if In Situ leaching.   

Dr. Aberra Getahun of Water Management Consultants has completed an independent report 
(Getahun, 2007) on the geochemical aspects of the Gunnison Cu project with emphasis on the In 
Situ aspects of the project.  Dr. Getahun is a geochemical expert with significant experience in Cu 
ISL and has been employed by Excelsior since December 2010.   

13.1. Metallurgical Summary 

Several metallurgical studies have been carried out on representative core samples from North 
Star resource, by various mining companies during a 40 year period. The average grade of the 
majority of this test work is 0.57% TCu and is similar to the overall deposit grade at a 0.30% TCu 
cut off.  In particular the column leach test work using sulfurous acid was performed on samples 
with a head grade of 0.426% TCu. The companies included Superior Oil Co., Quintana Minerals 
Corporation, Cyprus Minerals, BHP (Magma Copper) and Phelps Dodge Mining Company.  A 
summary of all known test work is contained in Table 13-1.

There is a lengthy explanation of the results from a laboratory test using sulfurous acid as a 
lixiviant run by Hazen Laboratory in Denver, Colorado (Bhappu, 2007).  The results from the 
Hazen testing are encouraging enough to warrant continued examination of sulfurous acid as a 
lixiviant.  Additional column testing, commissioned by AzTech at MSRDI on available core, 
mirroring the Hazen methods gave results that established the repeatability of the metallurgical 
tests.

The following is the summary from the MSRDI report on the Gunnison Project (Bhappu, 2007). 

The Gunnison Copper Project has sufficient oxide copper mineralization to be considered a 
serious target for leaching.  However, the host rock mass is a skarn, altered beds of limestones 
and dolomites.  The copper mineralization is chrysocolla, an oxide copper silicate.  It is leachable 
with sulfuric acid however, because the host rock mass is a skarn, one has to expect there may be 
high acid consumption although the tests summarized in Bhappu, 2007, indicate 10 to 12 pounds 
of sulfuric acid per pound of Cu metal recovered.  The technical problem is can we find another 
lixiviant other than sulfuric acid that will leach chrysocolla but not increase the acid consumption 
sufficiently to affect the projects economics.   

In the hunt to find another lixiviant for the project, it came to the attention of the project team that 
Magma Copper Company (BHP Copper) conducted some metallurgical testing of the North Star 
core samples in 1995 and 1996 in which initial testing of sulfurous acid were made.  It was 
discovered that the kinetics of sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid are similar but the acid consumption 
values for sulfurous acid are lower.  No gypsum precipitation occurred.  There are reasonable and 
practical methods for producing sulfurous acid.   

These results from the Hazen testing are encouraging enough to warrant continued examination of 
this lixiviant and its potential.  Initial testing indicates 8 to 9 pounds of sulfurous acid consumed per 
pound of Cu. Column testing on core shed material and additional testing mirroring the Hazen 
methods closely enough so that convincing results establishing the repeatability of the testing are 
obtained.  With the new drilling program planned, much additional assay work and metallurgical 
testing of fresh samples will be required.  The metallurgical processing circuit must also be defined 
and tested.    

At this junction, the project team began looking at sulfurous acid, generated by mixing sulfur 
dioxide in water.  Sulfurous acid will leach chrysocolla but not as aggressively as sulfuric acid and 
the acid consumption is lower.  Also sulfurous acid eliminates secondary precipitation of gypsum, 
calcium sulfate, by not having the sulfate anion in the lixiviant.  The lack of a sulfate anion also 
could lower closure costs by not having to remove any sulfate in the rock mass. 

After reviewing the metallurgical test work on sulfuric acid and the Hazen Report on sulfurous acid, 
it is my opinion that the use of sulfurous acid in the Gunnison Copper Project makes the project 
very desirable and could have a huge impact on the projects economics.  However, there is still 
much metallurgical and hydrological test work that will be demanded in order to completely 
mitigate any technical risks to the project.   

 Design the metallurgical process including flowcharts 

 Continue column testing with six inch core, establishing repeatability of the results from the 
Hazen testing 

 Initiate column testing with old core for dissolution rates and acid consumption for sulfuric 
and sulfurous acid. 

 As new drill core is made available, assay core and continue the column test work 

13.2. Geochemistry Summary 

The mineralization zones are localized predominately in the Abrigo and Martin formations, 
approximately 89% of the leachable copper oxides.  The mineralization is primarily chrysocolla, a 
copper silicate, which is leachable as long as the pH of the lixiviant is lower than 1.8.  The rock 
mass matrix is carbonate in nature, called a skarn, and generally considered a strong acid 
consumer.  The copper mineralization is found primarily in the fractures with very little 
disseminated.  As dissolution of copper begins, other gangue minerals associated with the 
fractures also are mobilized, especially calcite when sulfuric acid

is used.  With sulfuric acid, calcium may precipitate out of the leach solution as gypsum, primarily 
within the fractures. 

The alternative lixiviant for this project is sulfurous acid.  Sulfurous acid appears to have identical 
kinetics to sulfuric acid in the limited metallurgical testing that has been conducted.  However, of 
greater importance, sulfurous acid will eliminate secondary precipitation of gypsum within the 
matrix fracturing.  This is a critically important advantage.  The "plugging" of the fracturing (with the 
precipitation of gypsum) can prevent future solutions from penetrating to the leachable copper 
mineralization and prevent higher extraction rates for the contained oxide resource.   

Another feature of sulfurous acid leaching is the ability to open fractures and expose the copper 
mineralization.  This advantage must be verified in future laboratory testing but if this theory 
becomes true, than the penetration of the sulfurous acid to contact all the leachable copper 
minerals can ultimate increase overall extraction.  The sulfurous acid removes the blind calcite and 
opens the fractures.   

The results from the Hazen Testing of sulfurous acid have raised some potentially economic 
production scenarios for an In Situ leaching facility where sulfurous acid is the lixiviant.  One of the 
first tasks for the project team will be the investigation into the potential of sulfurous acid and the 
means to produce it on site as it is not commercially available and is formed by mixing SO2 gas in 
water. 

Geochemically, there are some tasks that must be completed during future phases of the project 
as recommended by Dr. Getahun (Getahun, 2007). 

1. Obtaining repeatability of the results from the Hazen testing of sulfurous acid on fresh core 
samples is critical to future use of this lixiviant for leaching copper. 

2. Determining acid consumption by size fraction and ultimately in six inch core samples 
which best mirrors an In Situ leaching scenario. 

3. Characterization of the host rock mineralogy and whole rock chemistry 

a. Initial leach and attenuation laboratory & numerical experiments 

b. Tailoring leach solution chemistry 

c. Help to isolate deleterious affects from the leach circuit 

d. Minimize affects of secondary precipitates by isolating sections or geologic 
formation from the leach field (benefit of sulfurous acid) 

e. Minimize ore blinding or armoring, channel infilling and well clogging 

4. Complete the characterization of the leach solution chemistry. Typical sulfuric acid based 
lixiviants that are widely used to leach oxide copper are highly mineralized brines with high 
concentrations of sulfate, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, and other trace metals.   

5. The fundamental geochemical questions that must ultimately be answered in order to 
optimize an In Situ operations are: 

a. Degree of leachability 

b. Type of mineralization 

c. Mineral locations 

d. Access of lixiviant to the ore mineralization 

e. Size and nature of the occurrence of the resource 

f. Possibility of secondary deposition armoring (coating) ore minerals

14. MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The North Star deposit model has been updated to include the results of additional drilling and to 
incorporate oxide zone and geologic formation shapes provided by Excelsior. 

14.1. Drill Hole Data Base 

The North Star data base supplied to IMC contains 109 drill holes aggregating 141,252 feet (ft) of 
drilling, 91 of which, aggregating 124,326ft, are inside the IMC model area for North Star. However, 
reviews identified a number of drillholes with suspect total copper (tcu) or acid soluble copper (ascu) 
assays, and these assays were replaced or set to no-data values before modeling commenced. The 
specific changes made were: 

● MCC-1 through MCC-6: Original Magma tcu and ascu assays replaced in their entirety by 
Skyline repeat assays on split core samples from these holes. 

● JD-1 and JD-3: Isolated high-grade intervals separated by no-data values set to no-data 
values. 

● K-04 and K-06: Identical assay values entered in multiple intervals set to no-data values. 
● SULLYI97-1: Default 0.01 tcu values set to no-data values. 

The ascu assays from Skyline repeat assays on split core samples from holes T-01 and T-05 were 
also added to the data base. 

Basic drilling and assaying statistics following these changes are summarized in Table 14-1.

14.2. Grade Statistics 

Table 14-4 summarizes 25ft composite grade statistics by geologic formation using the assay data 
base formation coding.  The MCC holes are excluded.  Formations are tabulated stratigraphically and 
blank cells signify insufficient data. Composite ascu grades tend to be biased high relative to tcu 
because of the incomplete ascu assaying (mean ascu exceeds mean tcu in the Escabrosa). The "ascu 
from ascu/tcu" ratio grades provide a better indication of actual mean ascu grade.

Figure 14-3 is a probability plot showing total copper grade distribution in the main formations. The 
grade distribution in the Texas Canyon quartz monzonite is lognormal. The sedimentary unit 
distributions exhibit inflections that may be indicative of separate lower- and higher-grade populations.  

14.3. Mineralization and Oxidation 

The distribution of mineralization in the deposit is illustrated in Figure 14-4, which shows 25ft drillhole 
composite tcu grades along EW section 391300N. The higher-grade copper horizons dip generally at 
about 30 degrees to the east, following the dip of the sedimentary hosts. 

The distribution of oxidation in the deposit is illustrated in Figure 14-5, which shows ascu/tcu ratios in 
drillholes along the same section line. The oxidized zones give the appearance of being flat, and the 
ascu/tcu ratios show that oxidation in the deposit tends to be gradational. There are usually no sharp 
cutoffs between oxide and sulfide material.

14.4. Grade Estimation 

The North Star model covers the area from 385,700N to 397,500N, from 534,600E to 542,400E and 
from 2,300 to 4,900 elevation. With a block size of 100x100x25ft vertical the model contains 118 rows, 
78 columns and 103 tiers for a total of 948,012 blocks.  The block model is un-rotated with respect to 
UTM coordinates. 

Total copper (tcu) grades in the model were estimated using ordinary kriging, a 700 x 700 x 50ft 
search dipping 30 degrees east (parallel to the dip of the sedimentary units) and a minimum of one 
and maximum of 12 25ft bench composites could be used to estimate a block grade. The 700ft search 
is 70% of the variogram range.  No composites were capped because no high-grade outlier 
composites are present.  Grades in the model were estimated only in bedrock using only composites 
located in bedrock. Composites with grades in the overlying alluvium were set to no-data values.  

Composites in intervals with no assay values were left as no-data values. There is a possibility that 
some of these composites exceed the 0.1% total copper leach cutoff, and inserting low-grade default 
values in such intervals could therefore cause underestimation of resources. It could also result in the 
identification of indicated resources in areas where assaying is insufficient to demonstrate continuity of 
mineralization. 

Acid Soluble (ascu) grades were estimated using the following procedures: 

1.) Calculate ascu/tcu ratios in assay intervals where both tcu and ascu are present and where tcu 
exceeds 0.02% (detection limit effects distort ascu/tcu ratios at lower grades). Set all intervals 
where ascu/tcu is greater than 1.0 to 1.0. 

2.) Composite the ascu/tcu ratios into 25ft bench composites. 

3.) Estimate ascu/tcu ratios in the model by ordinary kriging using an 1100 x 1100 x 200ft flat 
search and 1/12 minimum/maximum 25ft bench composites. The 1100ft search represents 
100% of the variogram range. 

4.) Estimate ascu as ascu/tcu times tcu.  

Ascu was not estimated directly because the incomplete ascu assaying has high-graded ascu relative 
to tcu in some formations (Table 14-4).  

The ascu estimation parameters resulted in ascu values being assigned to effectively all of the 
indicated model blocks in Excelsior's lease area and to about 70% of the inferred blocks. The average 
ascu/tcu ratio in inferred blocks was assigned to the 30% of the inferred blocks that were not 
estimated.   

The variograms used to krige tcu and ascu are shown in Figure 14-6.  

Model grades estimates are shown in Figures 14-7 and 14-8, which plot east-west block grade tcu 
grades and ascu/tcu ratios along the 391,300N section line used for the Figure 14-4 and 14-5 drillhole 
composite sections.

The formation (Escabrosa, Martin etc.) and mineral zone (oxide, transition, sulphide) geometries were 
interpreted by Excelsior on east – west cross sections and provided to IMC.  The sectional 
interpretation was wire framed and assigned to the block model.  These shapes were used to tabulate 
resources but not to control grade estimation.  The trends of the copper mineralization were used to 
guide the orientation of the grade estimation parameters. 

Model block tonnages were estimated by applying the following average formation densities, 
calculated by Excelsior from an extensive suite of density measurements on core samples, to the 
formation shapes in the model: 

    Escabrosa  2.73 g/cc 
    Martin   2.81 
    Upper Abrigo  2.86 
    Middle Abrigo  2.93 
    Lower Abrigo  2.73 
    Bolsa    2.64 
    Texas Canyon QM 2.59 
    Others   2.69 

14.5. Resource Classification 

The Mineral Resources are classified as if North Star is a large bulk tonnage deposit.  Model blocks 
where tcu composites from three or more holes are present within the 700x700x50ft tcu search ellipse 
are classified as indicated and blocks where tcu composites from one or two holes are present are 
classified as inferred. This approach provides a visually-reasonable indicated-inferred distribution, with 
indicated blocks located dominantly internal to the drilling and inferred blocks on the periphery (Figure 
14-9). 

The three-hole criterion is supported statistically by tcu kriging variances, which are a measure of the 
uncertainty in the model block tcu estimates. Tcu kriging variances increase only slowly as the number 
of holes decreases from ten to three but begin to increase rapidly as the number of holes falls below 
three (Figure 14-10).  

The North Star Mineral Resource based on the information provided above is summarized in Table 
14-5.  The mineral resource is tabulated for the oxide portion of the deposit at a 0.10% tcu cutoff and 
the sum of the mixed plus sulphide portions of the deposit at a 0.30% tcu cutoff.   Other cutoffs are 
included in the table for reference.  The mineral resource is the model contained tonnage and grade 
estimated within the sedimentary formations only, thus excludes any tonnage and grade estimates in 
the adjacent porphyry and undefined areas.  As well, the mineral resource is limited to within the area 
for which Excelsior has the rights to explore (claims and leases). The mineral resource is based on the 
drill hole data discussed in Section 14.1 except that the six MCC holes (MCC 1-6) which had 
questionable original assays were not used for the estimate.  This is the mineral resource contained in 
the July 19th press release and is the mineral resource for this report. The effective date of the mineral 
resource estimate is June 20th, 2011. 

At this time there are no known factors impacting the resource statement regarding environmental, 
permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors.  This 
does not imply that these will not have an impact on future resource estimates.

23. ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Gunnison Project lies within the porphyry copper metallogenic province of the southwestern 
United States. There are several adjacent properties that have been or are still potentially major 
producers of copper.  Nord Resources Corporation are the current owners of the Johnson Camp 
deposits that have mined 161 million lbs of Cu since mining began in 1975 (Nord Resources 
Corp., 2007).  They intend on recommencing open pit mining, heap leaching and SXEW 
processing (Nord Resources Corp, 2007).  The ores at Johnson Camp are hosted in the Abrigo 
Formation, the same unit that hosts the majority of the mineralization at North Star, however the 
information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Excelsior property.  

Regionally Cu-Zn skarns dominate and have been historically mined from the Republic, Copper 
Chief and Mammoth mines from underground operations (Baker, 1953).  Tungsten and minor 
lead-silver-gold have also been produced in the district (Cooper and Silver, 1964).  As mentioned 
before high grade Cu skarn mineralization is known to exist on adjacent properties, in particular 
north of Johnson Camp where historic copper grades were in the order of 7% copper and several 
ounces per ton of silver (Cooper and Silver, 1964).  Mineralization on adjacent properties is not 
necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Excelsior properties. 

The author has relied on reports by others (as referenced) for the information presented in this 
section and has been unable to verify the information.

24. OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION (HYDROLOGY) 

An Independent report summarizing the hydrology of the Gunnison Cu Project was commissioned 
by AzTech Minerals and completed by Dr. Shlomo Orr in August 2007.   Dr. Orr has significant 
expertise in the field of hydrogeology specializing in In Situ applications. 

The general hydrogeology of the region is characterized by a complex terrain – Paleozoic 
sedimentary rocks trending NW-SE, overlying the Texas Canyon quartz monzonite intrusive rocks, 
which, in turn, outcrops SW to the domain of interest. The Gunnison Hills Fault to the east is the 
dominant structure in the region, which is faulted and fractured throughout.  

The dominant (mineralized) units for potential in-situ leaching are the consolidated limestone and 
dolomites (the bedrock), particularly, the Abrigo and Martin formations (and Horquilla formation in 
the South Star resource area), which were intruded by quartz monzonite rocks along the NW 
trending ridge that formed the central core of the deposit. The complex NW striking normal faulting 
has resulted in large displacements within the Paleozoic rock sequence, with potentially 
preferential vertical pathways (i.e., hydraulic anisotropy on a large scale) Overlying the host rocks 
is the semi-consolidated alluvium, which constitutes the main aquifer, rendering the underlying 
(submerged) formations "bedrock" aquifers (or aquitards). In that sense and on this large scale, 
the large-scale hydrogeology of the Gunnison Copper Project has some similarity to the Florence 
aquifer system (essentially, low-permeability rocks (mineralized) underlying a high-permeability 
sedimentary layer). 

Groundwater recharge seems to occur along the western portion of the mineralized zone, along 
the contact of the quartz monzonite outcrop and the alluvium. Groundwater in the alluvium seems 
to move generally from west to east, above the mineralized zone.  

Below is the executive summary from Dr. Shlomo's report titled 'Preliminary review of the 
hydrogeology of the Gunnison Copper Project site' (Orr, 2007). 

This report is a preliminary investigation of the hydrogeology of the Gunnison Copper Project 
(GCP) site, based on very limited information on hydraulic tests and inferred hydraulic properties 
of the formations/aquifers that host the North Star and South Star resources.  

A partial pumping test done in the South Star aquifer seems to indicate favorable permeability (on 
that medium scale) although still low. Partial packer test interpretations in the North Star aquifer 
provide mixed indications of low permeability on small-scale.  Although these low permeabilities on 
that (small) scale are consistent with the tight fractures observed in core samples, the vertical 
geologic structures that dominate the terrain (esp. faulting and fracturing) may have a major effect 
on lowering apparent permeability along vertical holes, and hence, additional tests are necessary.  

The report also lists environmental concerns and the major steps needed for environmental 
permitting (particularly, Aquifer Protection Permit), including closure. The main concern is of 
excursion (or flaring) of solution upwards into the high-permeability sedimentary rocks.  

The main conclusion of this report is that the current overwhelming uncertainty in the hydraulic 
properties on all scales requires starting with a more thorough study in order to reduce the 
uncertainty (of the In Situ evaluation) to an acceptable level.  

 

Due to the uniqueness of the Project site, other innovative avenues of investigation could include:  

 inclined and horizontal wells;  

 push-pull pilot test;  



 INDEPENDENT   
MINING  CONSULTANTS, INC.

GUNNISON COPPER PROJECT

 systematic fracturing (starting with surgical/local hydro-fracturing, and continuing with 
propellants, while investigating the potential of new "high explosives");  

 advanced geophysical methods for monitoring (particularly, high-resolution resistivity);  and  

 recent methods of In Situ crystallization – both for closure and for sealing potential 
excursion zones 

Finally, the report briefly describes the steps needed to design a successful well field and 
(subsequent) optimal in situ operation. At the center of such design and operation is a reactive 
transport model that can predict well field and operational scenarios, and thereby, can assist in 
optimizing and controlling in situ mining.

A metallurgical review by Dr. Roshan B. Bhappu of MSDRI summarized all past metallurgical work 
and reviews the use of sulfurous acid as a potential lixiviant to extract the copper. After reviewing 
the metallurgical test work on sulfuric acid and the Hazen Report on sulfurous acid, it appears that 
the use of sulfurous acid in the Gunnison Copper Project could have a large impact on the projects 
economics. Metallurgical data have been compiled with the average acid consumption of 10 to 12 
pounds of sulfuric acid per pound of Cu and 8 to 9 pounds of sulfurous acid per pound of Cu 
obtained.  The proposed test work program to continue investigating the use of sulfurous acid 
should be done. 

The important mineralization zones are localized in the Abrigo and Martin formations, 
approximately 89% of the leachable copper oxides.  The mineralization is primarily chrysocolla, a 
copper silicate, which is leachable as long as the pH of the lixiviant is below 1.8 (similar to most 
copper oxide leaching operations).  The rock mass matrix is carbonate in nature, called a skarn, 
and generally considered a strong acid consumer unless heavily altered.  The copper 
mineralization is found primarily in the fractures with very little disseminated copper.  As 
dissolution of copper begins, other gangue minerals associated with the fractures also are 
mobilized, especially calcite when sulfuric acid is used.  With sulfuric acid, calcium may precipitate 
out of the leach solution as gypsum, primarily within the fractures.

Dr. Shlomo's conclusions based on limited historical data is that the system has similarities to 
Florence and requires a thorough pre-feasibility study.  In addition Dr. Shlomo has suggested 
potential avenues of innovation that may lead to hydrological improvements and cost savings for 
the project. 

At this time there are no known uncertainties in the data which would significantly impact the 
current resource estimate.  As the project moves forward there is the risk of newly discovered 
impacts to the data or environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, 
political or other relevant factors which could impact the project timeline or completion. 

Excelsior's goal was to upgrade the resource from inferred to indicated status.  The author 
believes that Excelsior has achieved this goal and the size of the indicated and inferred resource 
is sufficient to warrant further investigation.  The data used is sufficient to define an indicated and 
inferred resource.  There is uncertainty as to whether the project will have a positive outcome as 
further work is completed.  That said, it is the author's opinion that the project should be carried to 
the next step which is: 

Future work will include a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) based on the current indicated 
mineral resource.  Additional work will be incorporated into the PEA (see below). For details see 
section 26 (Recommendations). 

 Initiate modern metallurgical testing with the results to be incorporated into the PEA. 

 Initiate hydrological testing of the mineralization with the results to be incorporated into the 
PEA. 

 Complete structural interpretation for the deposit using down hole geophysical data 

 Continue re-logging and re-assaying historical core to improve the validity of the historical 
data as well as the interpretation.

26. RECOMMENDATIONS 

Excelsior's aim is to bring the North Star copper oxide deposit into production by using proven In 
Situ leach ("ISL") technology.  The project will be advanced in a staged approach through a 
preliminary economic assessment (PEA) and dependant on a successful PEA a pre-feasibility and 
dependant on a successful pre-feasibility a feasibility study. The main areas of activity include 
resource verification, extension and up-grades, detailed geological/metallurgical modeling, 
hydrological investigations, environmental monitoring, community engagement and mine design 
(including mining scenarios alternative to ISL).  Specific items to be addressed are listed below. 

IMC agrees with the approach presented below and has reviewed the budget proposed by 
Excelsior to accomplish the PEA during the work period of 2011.  The budget appears appropriate 
for the amount of work to be accomplished with total expenditures estimated to be $500,000 US 
dollars for the period.  A 20% contingency would bring the budget to US $600,000.  

26.1. Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) 

A series of 3 metallurgical samples were collected from 2 diamond holes drilled to collect these 
samples. These were submitted to Hazen Laboratories in Golden Colorado for metallurgical 
testing designed to simulate in situ leaching by epoxy coating unnatural surfaces.  These results 
will be incorporated into the PEA. 

Two hydrological test wells were initiated in the North Star deposit with one centered at the 
northern end of the deposit and the other at the southern end.  Pump and injection tests as well as 
spinner tests will be conducted in these holes with the results being incorporated into the PEA.  

Complete a structural interpretation for the deposit using down hole geophysical data modeled 
with WellCAD, and then domain the oriented structural data from the acoustic logs.  Use this data 
to determine preferred orientations for fractures, faults, veins and porphyry dykes to then be used 
to aid in the structural interpretation of the deposit. 

Continue re-logging and re-assaying historical core to improve the validity of the historical data as 
well as the interpretation. 

26.2. Budget 

Excelsior has developed the budget presented in Table 26-1 for expenditures during the year 2011 
for the PEA.  The work required and the budgeted amounts appear reasonable.  It is 
recommended that the 2011 budget work program be completed.  The PEA work includes; 
metallurgical testing, hydrological testing, structural analysis and further interpretation.

Budget  2011

Metallurgy  $100,000

Hydrology  $250,000

Geology  $50,000

26.3. Recommendations in Advance of Further Modeling 

IMC recommends that further work be done in the following areas of the deposit definition as the 
project moves forward. 

Review Formation shapes: 

The formation shape codes in the model blocks conflict with the 25ft-composite formation codes in 
the assay data base in 586 out of 2,820 cases, or 21% of the time, with the largest conflicts 
occurring in the Upper Abrigo (112 out of 385, 29%). It is recommended that the formation shapes 
in the model and/or the composite formation codes be reviewed and modified where necessary to 
obtain a better match. 

Special attention should be given to conflicts at the gravel/bedrock contact. The model shapes and 
the 25ft composite codes disagree as to the location of this contact by a bench or more in 51 out 
of the 78 holes for which comparative data are available and by two benches or more in 18 holes. 
There are large differences in NSD-02, NSD-19 and NSD-16 and T-05. 

Review Oxide zone shapes: 

The oxide zone shapes in the model do not robustly segregate the deposit into oxide, transition 
(mixed) and sulfide zones. Probability distributions of 25ft-composite ascu/tcu ratios in the NSD 
holes that intersect the oxide, transition and sulfide zones in the model show that the oxide zone 
and (arguably) the sulfide zone contain substantial amounts of transitional material.  

It is recommended either that the oxide, transition and sulfide zone boundaries be modified to 
make them a better fit to the ascu/tcu ratios, or that recovery estimates be based directly on tcu 
and ascu model block grades. 

Obtain more Ascu data: 

Acid soluble copper is implicitly a better indicator of acid leach recovery than total copper, but ascu 
assaying at North Star is less complete than tcu assaying. It is therefore recommended: 

● That ascu assays be run on any available core, reject or pulp samples from previous drilling 
campaigns that have not been assayed for ascu, particularly on T-hole samples.  

● That future drilling target areas where holes remain in the ascu coverage.  

Figure 26-1 shows the locations of holes with ascu assays for reference.
