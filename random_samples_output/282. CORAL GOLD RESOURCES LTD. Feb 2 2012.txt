SECTION 1.0 SUMMARY 
 
1.1 SCOPE 
 
A Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) has been prepared, to meet the NI 43-101 criteria for a 
technical report on the Robertson property by Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd. (Beacon Hill) 
on behalf of the property owners, Coral Gold Resources Ltd. (Coral).  
 
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
The Robertson Property is an advanced-stage gold exploration project located in eastern Lander 
County, Nevada, 60 miles southwest of Elko.  Coral Resources, Inc., a subsidiary of Coral Gold 
Resources Limited of Vancouver, B. C., acquired control of the Robertson Property in 1986.  The 
property consists of 601 unpatented federal lode claims, mill sites, placer claims and nine patented 
lode claims covering over 7,300 acres of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management.  Coral is record owner of 525 claims and controls an additional 76 claims through a 
series of mineral leases and option agreements.  
 
Site location and claim map are shown on Figure 1-1 and 1-2 respectively.

1.4 MINE PLAN 
 
The mine plan as described in this report evaluates the open pit mining of three deposits of the 
Robertson property, the Altenburg Hill, Porphyry and Gold Pan zones.  These deposits contain 
mineralization which is considered based upon metallurgical work to have cyanide heap leach 
potential.  The estimated inferred resources at a cut-off of 0.005ozAu/t are some 78.2 million tons 
containing 1.08 million oz of gold.  Based upon cut-off of 0.0147ozAu/t for a crushed higher grade 
heap leach recovery of 67% and a run-off-mine lower grade heap recovery of 45%, the recovered ozs 
are 604,100 oz.  The mine life has been estimated at 10.5 years at a maximum production rate of 
approximately 40,000 tons per day for both mineral and waste. The waste to mineral strip ratio is 
0.6:1. 
 
The production rate was determined to establish a life of at least 8 years and no more than 15 years to 
minimize capital and operating costs and provide an acceptable yearly gold production and return on 
investment. It was determined that to meet these goals it was beneficial to leach the higher grade 

                                                 
2 Since this is a property located in the USA all units are shown in imperial unless specifically noted as otherwise. 
3 Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to an inferred mineral resource, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred 
mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured resource as a result of continued exploration.

separate from the lower grade. The schedule was optimized by mining the zones that would provide 
the lowest strip ratio, Altenburg Hill together with the larger Porphyry first and then Gold Pan. The 
production schedule for each deposit and the combined rates is shown on Table 1.2.

1.5 PROCESSING AND METALLURGY  
 

A considerable amount of metallurgical work has been completed over a number of years for 
forecasting leach recoveries for the Altenburg Hill, Porphyry and Gold Pan mineralized zones. In 
2011 further laboratory test work was performed by McClelland Laboratories, Inc., Sparks, Nevada 
based upon samples from the Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan Deposits.  No recent metallurgical test 
work has been done on the Porphyry deposit.   
 
In this study, based on previous work and the recent work completed by McClelland Laboratories 
recoveries have been assumed as follows; 
 

1. Mineralization that grades 0.0147ozAu/t or higher that will be crushed prior to being 
placed on the leach pad -  67% leach recovery; 

2. Run-off-mine mineralization that has a grade lower than 0.0147ozAu/t and a cut-of 
0.005ozAu/t – 45% recovery.   

 
It should be noted that considerable further work is required to confirm the foregoing leach 
recoveries and they should be considered as indicative only. 
 
1.6 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The general arrangement drawing, which includes the open pits, haul roads, leach pads, pipelines, 
ponds, offices, dry, ADR plant, warehouse and maintenance facilities is shown on Figure 1-3. 

 
1.7 ENVIRONMENTAL 
 
The Project area consists of approximately 7300 acres, of which 169 acres are private lands, held as 
patented mining claims either owned or controlled by Coral Gold Resources, Inc. (Coral). The 
remaining 7131 acres are public lands administered by the BLM Mount Lewis Field Office (MLFO) 
in Lander County; Coral controls approximately 601 unpatented lode and placer claims on these 
public lands. 
  
This mixed estate makes the MLFO the primary agency for authorizing mining activities on public 
and private land; the MLFO works with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection – Bureau 
of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) under a memorandum of understanding to authorize 
mining on projects on both public and private lands. 
 
As a result of the foregoing there are a number of environmental evaluations, reports and approvals 
required to allow for work to be done on the property.   
 
The first of these is an Environmental Assessment (EA) which upon approval by the regulatory 
authorities will provide the basis for work to commence on the property.  It is expected that the EA, 
being performed by SRK Elko Nevada, will be completed by January 2012 and approval achieved 
during the third quarter 2012. Coral have indicated that they expect a number of drill holes to be 
approved prior to approval of the EA such that drilling can commence in the second quarter 2012. 
The EA approval will allow for the further drilling and the removal of samples for laboratory 
metallurgical test work and on-site bulk leach program to confirm laboratory results. 
 
The second study will be site environmental work to provide data for an EIS based upon the 
proposed mine plan for the property.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 1-8 January, 2012  

 
These studies and associated approvals are the critical timeline for the project and any improvement 
to shorten this timeline will be beneficial to bringing the project on stream as soon as feasible. The 
schedule of these activities is shown on Figure 1-4. 
  
1.8 DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE 
 
An overall development schedule of activities has been derived.  The schedule provides a two stage 
approach to the development of the project; the first stage is the work program required to advance 
the project to prefeasibility. This program on the Altenburg Hill, Porphyry and Gold Pan deposits 
includes exploration and drill definition activities, metallurgical test work, environmental studies, 
geotechnical open pit and infrastructure test work and evaluations, infrastructure requirements, and 
capital and operating costs. The work is intended to upgrade the level of confidence in the resource 
estimates to measured and indicated categories and based on prefeasibility cost estimates move the 
resources into reserves.   
  
It should be noted; 
 

 there is no guarantee that resources will be designated as measured and indicated and that 
reserves will be designated on the Robertson property; and 

 while the schedule indicates a timeline for the overall project, the period after the completion 
of a prefeasibility study is subject to the results of that study.

1.9 CAPITAL COSTS 
 
The project initial capital costs, based upon 2011 dollars and Owner operation, to construct the 
facilities have been estimated at $122.1 million with expenditures of $16.5 million to develop the 
property. Ongoing costs are estimated at $54.2 million. The initial capital cost schedule is shown in 
Table 1.3 and ongoing cost Table 1.4 and is based upon budget estimates from suppliers for major 
items, cost data from Mining Cost Service, InfoMine USA, Inc. and in-house data.  These costs are 
preliminary and should be considered as indicative. 
 
An alternative case has been developed using a Nevada Contractor to develop and mine the open pits 
with the Owner operating all other facilities. The initial capital cost for this approach is $97 million 
with ongoing capital of $26.1 million.  The initial capital cost is shown in Table 1.5 and the ongoing 
cost Table 1.6. Under this alternative the Contractor provides all the mining associated equipment 
which reduces the initial capital expenditures.  
 
The capital costs are intended to reflect those costs that Coral would incur to further explore the 
Robertson property, complete environmental and permitting studies, obtain permits, environmental 
bonding of the property, purchase of all equipment, buildings and supplies, construct all facilities, 
preproduction development, commissioning all facilities, construct all surface infrastructure 
including leach pads and waste disposal areas and commence production.   
 
Coral have an agreement with Albany Gold Corp. on all the claims on which the Robertson property 
sits.  This agreement calls for a 3% NSR to be paid or a purchase payment of $1.25 million paid at 
any time to purchase outright the 3% NSR on the claims.  It is understood from Coral representatives 
that this purchase would be made upon Coral making a construction decision.  Thus this cost has 
been added to the capital cost estimate. Tenabo Gold Mines have a royalty on a claim that slightly 
covers non mineable Gold Pan mineralization. 
 
Environmental bonding will be required by the USA and Nevada regulators prior to obtain the 
permit(s) to commence construction of the project.  An allowance of $7.5 million has been added to 
the capital cost of the project to cover this item, based upon bonding requirements to those 
experienced for similar projects in Nevada.   At the end of the life of the mine reclamation will be 
required and this has been estimated at a similar cost to the bond, $7 million.  In addition if the 
reclamation is completed then the bonding would be returned to the company and this is included in 
the financials. 
 
Salvage of equipment can be expected for the mobile equipment, ARD and crusher plant. The capital 
cost for these are some $45 million. A salvage allowance of 15% has been used amounting to $6.75 
million. 
 
The capital costs include allowances for Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management, 
Construction Indirects, Freight, Start-up and Commissioning and First Fills and Capital Spares.  A 
contingency of 15% has been added to the estimated capital cost. 
 
Ongoing capital costs are shown separately and include ongoing construction of the leach pads and 
replacement equipment that are used for maintaining operations.

1.10 OPERATING COSTS 
 
The operating costs have been estimated based upon prevailing labour rates for Nevada and the 
expected costs for supplies and materials.  Efficiencies of equipment have been based upon costs 
developed by the suppliers of the equipment which reflects their operational experience.  Overall 
costs have been compared to adjacent operations where possible. No contingency has been added. 
The average operating cost estimated to mine and process the mineralization is $5.28/t mined for the 
Owner operated base case and $6.45/t for the Contractor operation.  This includes mining of mineral 
and waste, leaching, processing, general and administration and owners cost.  The costs are indicative 
only and are in 2011 US$.  
 
Table 1.7 shows a summary of the estimated cost by year and area for the Owner operated and Table 
1.8 the Contractor operated alternative.

1.11 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
The financial analysis has been prepared using standard discounted cash flow methods to determine 
the NPV and IRR of the project based upon 100% equity financing and metal price of US$1350/oz 
Au for the Base Case.  This gold price is based on the trailing three year average.  The analysis was 
performed in constant 2011 US dollars, excluding inflation.  Various sensitivities have been 
completed to determine the effect of changes to metal prices, grade, capital costs, operating costs and 
leach recovery. 

1.12 RESULTS 
 

1.12.1 Base Case (Owner Operated) 
 
Case 1 economic evaluation is are based on an initial construction capital expenditure of US$122.1 
million operating cost of $5.28/ton mined and metal prices of US$1350/oz4. The project will generate 
an after-tax IRR of 15.44% and an NPV of US$180.6 million undiscounted and US$97 million

Case 1 financial analysis summary is shown on Table 1.9. 
 
Case 5 reflects a gold price of US$1500/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an after-tax 
IRR of 20.03% and an NPV of US$247.2 million undiscounted and US$147.1 million discounted at 
5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 4.72 years.  
 
Case 7 reflects a gold price of US$1750/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an after-tax 
IRR of 27.24% and an NPV of US$358.3 million undiscounted and US$230.7 million discounted at 
5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 3.91 years.  
 
Sensitivity studies have been prepared varying the price of gold, the operating and capital cost, grade 
and leach recovery. The project is most sensitive to gold price, sensitive to operating cost, grade and 
recovery and least sensitive to capital cost. The sensitivity results are shown on Table 1.10. 
 
It should be noted that the financial analysis has been evaluated on the basis of the construction 
activities being set against proceeds and those costs for the period to a construction decision have 
been included as sunk costs although these development costs have not been incurred at the time of 
writing this report.  This is considered as an acceptable approach since any decision to construct will 
be based upon the financial analysis at the time following completion of the development activities.  
Thus the expenditures for construction only are set against the proceeds of the project and not the 
development costs.  To include the development costs in the capital costs will not provide a basis for 
a fair evaluation of the project.

1.13 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The following is a list of the conclusions; 
 

1. The Robertson property is one of merit upon which further work is warranted consisting 
of exploration and definition drilling, metallurgical test work, geotechnical test work 
and associated work that will allow the preparation of a project evaluation to a 
prefeasibility level.  

2. The relative low capital cost provides an opportunity for a junior company such as Coral 
to raise those funds and operate the project.  

3. The project is seen as one where a contractor operation would be beneficial due to the 
increased operating cost is offset by the lower capital cost expenditures.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 1-20 January, 2012  

4. The Nevada project approval system has elongated the development period for the 
project. Every effort should be made to attempt to reduce the time to achieve regulatory 
approval of the project and allow the project to be developed as quickly as is feasible.  

5. The financial analysis results indicate that the project breaks even at US$950/oz gold for 
the Owner operation and US$1010/oz for the Contractor alternative. 

 
1.14 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
It is recommended that the project be developed in two stages.  The first is that work required to take 
the project to completion of a prefeasibility report and the second work required to complete a full 
"bankable" feasibility, i.e., one on which a construction decision could be made.  Costs have been 
estimated for stage 1 and the cost for stage 2 have been included in the capital cost section for 
guidance only; stage 2 costs will be defined in the report derived from stage 1. 
  
The work in stage 1 consists of; 
 

1. Exploratory and definition drilling. 
2. Metallurgical test work program. 
3. Environmental program. 
4. Geotechnical and associated work. 
5. A prefeasibility study.  

 
A summary of stage 1, estimated to cost $7.9 million, is shown on Table 1.13. 
 
Cost breakdowns are shown on Tables 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16.

1.14.1 Exploration and Definition Drilling 

 
It is recommended that Coral conduct a two phase exploration program focused on expanding and 
up-grading the near-surface oxide and sulfide inferred mineral resources to measured and indicated.   
 
The Phase I should consist of drilling 40 HQ diameter diamond core holes and 42 RC holes having 
an average depth of 400-500 ft and totaling about 40,000 ft in the;   
 

 Porphyry Zone:  "Twinning" 10 percent (20 holes) of the historic drill holes by diamond 
core drilling to determine if "historic" Amax drilling data can be used with confidence to 
upgrade the level of confidence in the resources. In addition an additional 17 RC holes, 
totaling about 7,600 ft, to be drilled along the west and south boundaries of the Porphyry

Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 4-1 January, 2012  

SECTION 4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
4.1 LOCATION 
 
The Robertson Property is located in eastern Lander County, Nevada, on public lands administered 
by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The property is situated in Sections 2-10, 15-18, 20, 21, 
Township 28 North, Range 47 East and Sections 26, 32 and 34, Township 29 North, Range 47 East, 
Mt. Diablo Baseline & Meridian (Figure 4-1).  
 
4.2 MINING CLAIM DESCRIPTION 
 
The Robertson Property consists of 510 unpatented federal lode, 90 placer claims, nine patented lode 
claims and one unpatented mill site, covering approximately 7,300 acres (Figure 4-2).  The claim 
total includes two no-contiguous groups of claims totaling 82 claims that are also controlled by 
Coral.  Coral Resources, Inc. owns or controls the surface and mineral estates within the project area 
through record title, or through mining lease and mining lease with option to purchase agreements of 
the patented and unpatented mining claims.  At the end of 2010, Coral was record owner with 100 
percent interest in 525 claims and controls an additional 76 claims through a variety of mineral 
leases. A comprehensive title search of these claims was completed in 2007 by Harris & Thompson, 
a Reno, Nevada law firm, which found no major title issues. The authors of this report have not 
completed a title search or verified the ownership of the claims and have relied upon the legal advice 
given by Coral. 
 
4.3 AGREEMENTS AND ENCUMBRANCES 
 
In 1986, Coral Gold Corporation and its US affiliate Coral Resources, Inc., acquired an option to 
acquire a 70 percent interest in the "mining properties" owned or controlled by Aaron Mining and its 
affiliates, in the Tenabo mining district, Nevada, under an Option and Joint Venture agreement.  
Coral was granted an undivided 70 percent interest in the Tenabo mining properties in 1987.  Also in 
1987, Coral and its affiliate, acquired an undivided 29 percent interest in the "Tenabo Properties" 
from Geomex Development, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to Albany Gold Corp.).  Geomex had 
acquired its interest from E & B Exploration, who explored the property under a 1980 Option 
Agreement with Aaron Mining Ltd.  As part of Coral's acquisition of the Geomex interest, Geomex 
reserved a 3 percent Net Smelter Return Royalty covering all of the "Tenabo Properties", including 
all mining claims owned or controlled by Coral, or its affiliates, in Lander County, Nevada.  This 
royalty has an option to purchase for $1,250,000. 
 
In 1990, Coral and Amax Gold Exploration, Inc. ("Amax") entered into an Amended and Restated 
Option and Earn-In Agreement in which Amax could earn a 60 percent interest in the property by 
producing a bankable feasibility study.  A feasibility study was completed by Amax in November, 
1994, but because of marginal economics of the project, the parties determined that additional 
exploration was necessary.  Both companies agreed that Amax did not fulfill the requirements of the 
agreement and did not earn any interest in the property.  Amax withdrew from the project in 1996. 
 
In 1995, Coral and Amax agreed to "carve out" 219 claims (the "Excluded Claims") from the 
original block of 755 claims and place them under a separate Earn-In and Mining Venture 
Agreement.  In 1996, Amax withdrew from the 1990 agreement but maintained its interest in the 
agreement covering the "Excluded Claims".   Cortez acquired the Amax interest in the "Excluded 
Claims" and in 1998, Coral and Cortez signed an Option and Earn-In Agreement covering the 
Robertson Property (non-Excluded Claims).  After completing an exploration program on the 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 4-2 January, 2012  

Robertson Property in 1999, Cortez withdrew from the Option and Earn-In Agreement.  Under terms 
of the agreement, Cortez did not earn an interest in the property. 
 
In December 2004, Coral and Agnico-Eagle (USA), Ltd., then known as Nevada Contact, Inc., 
entered into an agreement covering 71 mining claims owned by Mauzy et al. and controlled by Coral 
through a 1989 Mineral Lease and Purchase Option (amended).  Coral assigned and subleased the 
underlying 1989 Mauzy Agreement to Agnico-Eagle, along with the obligation to pay required lease 
payments under the Mauzy Agreement and minimum advance royalty payments to Coral.  Coral also 
reserved a 2.5 percent net smelter return production royalty.  In 2007, Agnico-Eagle withdrew from 
the agreement without earning an interest in the property. 
  
As part of the Coral-Agnico agreement, the parties agreed to amend the underlying 1989 Mineral 
Lease and Purchase Option Agreement with Mauzy et al.  The amendment included extending the 
term of the agreement, reducing the royalty to 2 percent of the net smelter return and adjusting the 
purchase price for all claims subject to the agreement.  
 
In 2005, Coral acquired 39 unpatented lode claims and two association placer claims, covering 
approximately 960 acres, within the Robertson project area, from the Marcus Corporation.  Under a 
Share Exchange Agreement dated July 12, 2005, Marcus shareholders were offered one common 
share of Coral stock for 4 common shares of Marcus stock and one warrant for additional common 
shares of Coral stock at a reduced fixed price for every 2 common shares of Marcus stock.  As of 
December 2005, Coral had acquired 1,391,860 shares, or 99.98 percent, of the outstanding Marcus 
common shares.  Certain of the Marcus claims cover portions of the Altenburg Hill inferred resource. 
 
Twenty of the claims acquired as part of the Marcus acquisition include the Ruf unpatented lode 
claims which are subject to a 1995 Option and Joint Venture Agreement with Levon Resources Ltd.  
In 2002, after incurring a minimum $200,000 in exploration expenditures, as required under terms of 
the agreement, Levon was deemed to have earned an undivided one-third interest in the Ruf claims.  
 
In 2008, Coral entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with Dianne Breckon 
et al, owners of the June 1-6 unpatented lode claims.  Terms of the agreement include annual rental 
payments of $25,000, renewable in successive 4 year terms, provided the rent increases by $5,000 
every four years.  The property is subject to a 3% NSR which can be purchased for $3,000,000 and 
the property for $1,000,000.     
 
During 2007, Coral exercised its option to purchase 76 unpatented lode and placer claims and 6 
patented mining claims owned by Elwood Wright and 16 unpatented lode claims owned by Florence 
Johnson.   
 
Approximately 76 of the 601 claims that comprise the Robertson Property are controlled by Coral 
through six mining leases and option agreements.  Total annual payments for the various leases and 
minimum advance royalties or rental payments are US$91,700. A summary compilation of the terms 
of these agreements are presented in Table 4.1.  The location of claims subject to the various 
production royalties are shown in Figure 4-2.  It should be noted that a 3% NSR royalty owned by 
Albany Gold Corp. applies to all Coral-owned mining claims within the Robertson project area, as 
well as throughout Lander County, Nevada.

Claims fee of US$6,310.50 payable to Lander County have been paid for the 2011-2012 assessment 
year.  
 
Effective September 2004, Coral changed its name from Coral Gold Corporation to Coral Gold 
Resources Limited.  The company is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.  
 
4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
 
In 1988-89, Coral operated a small open pit gold mining operation and heap leach facility on the 
Robertson Property.  The resulting disturbances include three small open pit mines, waste dumps, 
haul roads, drill roads, open drill holes, and a 350,000 ton heap leach facility and related recovery 
plant.  In 1994, a reclamation plan was prepared by Amax and submitted to the Mount Lewis Field 
Office (formally the Battle Mountain office) of the BLM.  The cost to perform the reclamation of the 
Robertson mine site was estimated at that time to be $2 million.  In 2001, Coral began reclamation 
activities which were accelerated in 2002, with the recontouring of waste dumps, reclamation of the 
leach pad, haul roads and the filling of all open drill holes.  As a result of this activity, in June, 2003, 
the BLM lowered the bonding requirements for the project to $406,000.  
 
In March 2003, on behalf of Coral, SRK Consulting submitted a Final Plan for Permanent Closure 
with the BLM and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) which was approved by 
both agencies.  The major component of the closure plan was the installation of a site fluid 
management system.  During 2004, a terminal evapo-transpiration basin with a designed annual 
evapo-transpire capacity of 422,300 gallons per year was constructed.  In 2007, the recovery plant 
was dismantled and removed from the property and additional road and drill site reclamation was 
completed.  As a result of this work, the BLM lowered the bonding requirements to $352,934.  Coral 
currently maintains a state wide performance bond totaling $63,650 with the Nevada State Office of 
the BLM covering its various drilling programs conducted under a Notice of Intent (TRY/View).   
 
Coral's current reclamation obligation at Robertson is $352,934, covering 209.5 acres of disturbance.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 4-4 January, 2012  

4.5 PERMITTING 
 
In 2010, Coral submitted and was granted a five year renewal of Water Pollution Control Permit 
(NEV60035) by the NDEP.  In addition, Coral continues to conduct reclamation and exploration 
activities under a Plan of Operation (NVN-067688) approved in 1989 by the BLM.  In 2007, Coral 
conducted drilling operations in the extreme northwest part of the Robertson core property under a 
Notice of Intent NVN-083095 (TRY/View Notice).  
 
During the period 2000 through 2003, no exploration activity was conducted on the Robertson 
Property.  However, during that period a significant amount of surface reclamation was completed on 
the property.  As a result, new exploration activities in reclaimed areas will require submission and 
approval of an Amendment to the Plan of Operation.  Additionally, the National Historic 
Preservation Act requires that all operators on public lands conduct an archeological survey of the 
proposed sites of new disturbance.  Much of the core Robertson Property has been previously cleared 
under various surveys conducted by Amax.  Recent and planned future exploration activities by 
Coral have moved outside the area covered by previous archeological surveys.  It is possible that 
future exploration will experience delays in receiving approval because additional surveys will be 
required by state and federal agencies.  In 2004-06, Coral conducted exploratory drilling under a 
series of amendments to the Plan of Operation which were approved by the Mount Lewis Field office 
of the BLM and NDEP. 
 
In 2007, NDEP requested that Coral prepare and submit a new Plan of Operation consolidating all of 
the past modifications and amendments to the previous plan into one document.  The new plan was 
submitted in November 2007 and approval was granted in July 2008. 
 
Coral submitted a new Amended Plan of Operation (APO) to the Mount Lewis Field office of the 
BLM in April 2010 to cover proposed drilling operations on approximately 5,169 acres of the 
Robertson core claims.  After reviewing the APO, the BLM determined that Coral would be required 
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to produce an Environmental Assessment 
(EA) to address various potential environmental issues associated with the proposed drilling 
activities.  Approval of the new APO is expected in 2012.    
 
There are no known environmental or threaten and endangered species issues at the Robertson 
Property that would provide grounds for denial of approval of an Amended Plan of Operation.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 5-1 January, 2012  

SECTION 5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 
 
The property is 58 miles southeast of Battle Mountain and 70 miles southwest of Elko, NV (Figure 4-
1).  From Battle Mountain, the county seat, the property is reached by traveling 28 miles east on 
Interstate Highway 80, then 29 miles south on Nevada Highway 306 which passes through to the 
Coral property turn off.  The property is reached by driving two miles west on a well maintained 
gravel road.  A network of unimproved dirt roads and tracks provide access to the remainder of the 
property.  
 
5.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Robertson Property is situated in the Tenabo sub-district of the Bullion mining district, within a 
series of low foothills on the extreme eastern flank of the Shoshone Mountains near the abandon 
town site of Tenabo.   The climate is arid to semi-arid, with high annual insolation, low annual 
precipitation and large daily temperature fluctuations.   Altitude on the project varies from 5,000 ft to 
6,281 ft above mean sea level.  Vegetation is typical of the Great Basin Desert Shrub Steppe, 
comprised of communities of large sage brush, rabbit brush, Sandburg bluegrass and varieties of 
forbs.  Average annual precipitation at the site is less than 7 inches per year, mostly from winter 
snowfall and sporadic summer afternoon thunderstorms.  In the region, the average maximum 
temperature is 63F and the average minimum temperature is 30F.  Mid-winter day-time 
temperatures average 24F and mid-summer day-time temperatures average 90F.  
 
5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Land ownership within the Robertson Property project area consists of federal surface and minerals 
within the Shoshone-Eureka Resource Area, administered by the Mount Lewis Field Office of the 
Bureau of Land Management.  According to the BLM, principal land uses within the project area are 
mining, wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  Portions of the project area are subject to BLM 
livestock grazing permits.   
 
Because the "Komp" well, the previous source of water for past mining and exploration activities at 
Robertson Property is no longer operational, water is available with permission, from the Barrick 
Cortez mining operation as a result of their de-watering operations at the nearby Pipeline mine.  A 
series of infiltration ponds are located Section 22, T. 28 N., R. 47 E. which can provide sufficient 
water for future exploration activities.  Water to support mining operations at Robertson likely will 
likely require new production wells.   
 
A paved state highway provides access to within 2 miles of the property and a major power line that 
currently provides electrical power to a nearby operating mine crosses the east edge of the property.  
Surface rights at Robertson are sufficient to support a major mining operation.  Experienced mining 
personnel are available in the nearby communities of Elko and Battle Mountain.

SECTION 6.0 HISTORY 
 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Robertson property is located in the Tenabo area, a sub-district of the Bullion mining district.  
Historic lode mining in the sub-district dates from about 1905 with a total production of 20,000 
ounces of gold credited to the mines of the area (Stager, 1977).  Placer gold was discovered in many 
of the dry washes in the Tenabo area in 1916.  During the period 1937-39, a small dragline dredge 
and washing plant operated in the district, and a dredge was reported by Humphrey (1945) to be 
operating in lower Mill Gulch in 1945.  Placer production is estimated to have yielded $25,000 worth 
of gold and minor amounts scheelite (Johnson, 1973). 
 
During the period 1966-70, a number of companies explored the district in search of porphyry 
copper-style mineralization.  In 1968, while drilling a series of shallow rotary holes near the Gold 
Pan mine, Superior Oil discovered a small, but relatively high-grade zone of gold at shallow depths 
in what is now known as the Gold Pan Zone.  However, with additional drilling, Superior quickly 
lost interest in the district.  They were soon followed by a number of mainly Vancouver-based junior 
mining companies, including Placer Development (1974-75), Teck Corporation (1977), Aaron 
Mining Ltd. (1975-86), and E & B Exploration Ltd. (1980-81), all of whom sporadically explored the 
Tenabo area with limited success.  A summary of the drilling completed by these companies prior to 
Coral's involvement (1986) is presented in Table 6.1.  The locations of these holes are shown in 
Figure 5-1.

Modern open pit mining and heap leaching began as early as 1974, when Aaron Mines, Ltd., initiated 
a pilot leach operation.  Aaron placed about 15,000 tons of oxide material mined from the "glory 
hole" and waste dumps of the historic Gold Quartz mine on a small leach pad, from which 377 
ounces of gold were recovered (Stevenson & Assoc., 1977). During the period 1978-80, Aaron 
placed 38,400 tons of ore on a second larger pad, from which they recovered 517 ounces of gold 
(Sampson, 1988).  Also during that period Aaron continued exploration and began consolidating and 
acquiring claims in the district.  
 
6.2 CORAL GOLD CORP. (1986-1989) 
 
In 1986, Coral acquired Aaron's interest in the property and immediately began a series of major 
drilling programs beginning in 1986 and continuing until 1989.  By 1988, Coral had reportedly 
defined a reserve of 11 million tons averaging 0.04 ozAu/t (NBMG, 1989).  Mining operations 
commenced in 1988, but were suspended less than one year later.  During the operating life of the 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 6-2 January, 2012  

Robertson mine, approximately 350,000 tons of low-grade material was placed on leach pads from 
which about 6,200 ounces of gold were recovered. 
 
During the period 1986 through 1989, Coral completed approximately 380 RC holes and 7 DDH, 
totaling about 109,377 ft.  Much of this drilling was focused in four resources areas; Gold Pan, Gold 
Quartz, Gold Quartz extension (also called Gold Quartz West) and in the Triplet Gulch area.  The 
purpose of this drilling was to determine the limits and continuity of mineralization within these 
zones.  Nearly all of the RC holes were drilled vertically to an average depth of about 300 ft.  The 
locations of the Coral drill holes and the four resource areas are shown in Figure 6-2.   
 
During the later stages of Coral's exploration program, they completed two "deep" RC holes that 
reached depths of 1,400 ft and 1,810 ft, respectively.  In addition to resource definition, Coral also 
embarked on a program of district-wide exploratory and follow-up drilling of numerous surface 
anomalies.   
 
6.3 AMAX GOLD (1990-1996) 
 
In 1990, Coral and Amax Gold Exploration entered into an Amended and Restated Option and Earn-
In Agreement in which Amax could earn a 60 percent interest in the property by producing a 
bankable feasibility study.  From 1990, until they withdrew from the venture in 1996, Amax 
completed a district-wide exploration program that included drilling 342 RC holes and 62 DDH, 
totaling over 176,000 feet.  The locations of the Amax drill holes are shown on Figure 6-3.   
 
During this time period, Amax discovered a number of mineralized zones which comprised a low-
grade, drill-indicated resource of over 1 million ounces of gold.  These resources are summarized 
below in Table 6.2.  In 1994, Amax began close-spaced grid drilling of the Porphyry Zone resource 
to define a mineable reserve to serve as a basis for completing a bankable feasibility study (Amax, 
1994).  The resulting reserve of about 14 million tons averaging 0.019 and containing about 180,000 
recoverable ounces of gold was deemed marginal at a gold price of $400/oz.  The historic mineral 
resource and mineral reserve estimates cited in Table 6.2 and discussed above are presented for 
the purpose of historic background only and do not represent defined mineral resources on the 
property.  In addition, the classification of these historic mineral resources and reserves do not 
conform to the National Instrument 43-101.

6.4 CORTEZ GOLD MINES (1998-1999) 
 
In 1998, Cortez entered into an Option and Earn-In Agreement with Coral in which Cortez could 
earn a 70 percent interest in the Robertson property by producing a bankable feasibility study.  The 
focus of their exploration was to expand the 39A Zone and test a number of outlying targets.  During 
1999, Cortez completed 46 RC drill holes and a single mud rotary hole, totaling 57,000 ft.  Of the 
thirteen holes directed at expanding the 39A Zone only two holes, 99401 (130 ft/0.05 ozAu/t) and 
99413 (80ft/0.163 ozAu/t), encountered significant mineralization.  However, this drilling program 
did little to expand the resource.  Of the remaining holes drilled by Cortez, only two holes (99406 
and 99419) encountered significant mineralization.  Both holes were designed to offset and (or) 
follow up existing drill intersections and surface gold anomalies. The locations of the Cortez drill 
holes are shown in Figure 5-4. 
 
After completing this drilling program, Cortez declared its interest in renegotiating the terms of the 
Option Agreement.  When Coral declined, Cortez subsequently terminated the agreement and did not 
earn an interest in the property. 
 
6.5 CORAL GOLD RESOURCES LTD (2001-2010) 
  

6.5.1 Coral Drilling Programs (2004-2010) 
 
During 2004 and 2005, Coral conducted three drilling programs consisting of 32 RC holes totaling 
24,020 ft on the Robertson Property (McCusker, 2004, 2005).  The focus of this exploration was to 
expand and further define the 39A Zone, test the "deep" Gold Pan Zone for extensions of the 39A 
Zone and offset previous mineralized intersections in the "distal target area".  The locations of the 
Coral drill holes are shown in Figure 6-5 
 
During 2006, Coral completed a two phase drilling program.  Phase I consisted of drilling 14 RC 
holes totaling 11,355 ft, which were completed in the immediate vicinity of the existing 39A Zone 
indicated mineral resource.  The purpose of Phase I drilling was to define the "economic margins" of 
the 39A mineralized zone and to test the continuity of higher grade intersections between wide 
spaced drill holes.  Phase II drilling consisted of drilling 32 RC holes totaling 24,260 ft, which were 
completed in the Distal Zone, on the northeast flank of Altenburg Hill, in the gravel-covered area 
between the Altenburg Hill and the Porphyry Zone and along a northeast striking structural zone in 
the Porphyry Zone.  Several of these holes were also used to test the north and northwest edges of 
39A Zone (Coral Gold, 2007).  The locations of the 2006 Coral drill holes are shown in Figure 6-6.   
 
In 2007, the NDEP required Coral to consolidate previous amendments to the Plan of Operation 
before they would consider approving a new amendment.  As a result no drilling was conducted on 
any of the defined mineral resources during 2007.  Instead Coral was able to complete two deep 
flooded RC holes (TV07-1 and TV07-2) totaling 6,440 ft, in the extreme northwest part of the 
Robertson claim block under a Notice of Intent (TRY/View Notice).  The purpose of the 2007 deep 
drilling program was to discover high-grade Carlin-type gold deposits on the Robertson Property 
hosted by favorable strata in the lower plate of the Roberts Mountains thrust fault.  Drill targets were 
selected based on the coincidence of multi-element soil and rock chip geochemical anomalies with 
mapped faults having strong geophysical expressions that identified certain structures as major fluid 
conduits (McCusker, 2008).  The locations of the 2007 deep drill holes are shown in Figure 6-6    
 
The 2008 drilling program consisted of 34 RC holes totaling 22,835 ft to further define and expand 
the Altenburg Hill, South Porphyry, 39A and Distal mineralized zones. A total of 15 holes (7,270 ft) 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 6-4 January, 2012  

were completed on Altenburg Hill and 6 holes (3,000 ft) were drilled in the S. Porphyry zones to 
offset and infill known mineralization.  At the 39A zone, eight holes (6,645 ft) were completed in an 
effort to expand the resource to the northwest and northeast and 5 offset holes (5,920 ft) were drilled 
in the Distal zone.   
 
No exploration was conducted at Robertson in 2009. 
 
In 2010, Coral conducted a 12 hole RC program to evaluate the lower Triplet gulch resource (also 
called the South Zone resource).  The drilling program consisted of 12 vertical RC holes totaling 
8,000 ft, drilled on a grid with holes spaced 500 ft apart on lines also spaced 500 ft apart.  Hole 
depths ranged from 600 ft to 1,000 ft.  Only two of the 12 RC holes, CR10-7 and -8, were completed 
to 1,000 ft (McCusker, 2010).  The locations of the 12 RC holes drilled during 2010 are shown in 
Figure 6-7. 
 
Also in 2010, Coral completed 14 HQ diameter diamond core holes totaling 6,350 ft and ranging 
from 400 ft to 550 ft deep.  This limited program was designed to twin 12 existing RC holes in the 
Altenburg Hill (9 holes), S. Porphyry (1 hole) and Gold Pan (4 holes) zones in order to evaluate the 
reliability of the RC drilling and to provide samples for metallurgical testing.  The location of the 14 
diamond drill holes are shown in Figure 6-7.   
  

6.5.2 Coral Resource Studies (2001-2010) 
 
Prior to 2001, the earliest resource estimate that was made on any of the currently defined resources 
was in 1988 by Mintec Inc., using various cutoff grades for the Gold Pan Zone.  An estimate of the 
39A Zone resource was made by Amax in 1993, based on only 21,000 ft of drilling in 25 holes and 
using a 0.02 ozAu/t cutoff grade.  In 1994, Amax and MRDI jointly completed a resource estimate 
for the Porphyry Zone as part of a feasibility study.  The study concluded that a proven + probable 
mineral reserve was present, but was deemed "marginal" at the current gold price ($420/oz).   
  
In 1996, after completing grid and in-fill drilling in the Gold Pan and Altenburg Hill zones, Amax 
completed resources estimates for these mineralized zones using a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade.  Results 
of these studies indicated that while a low-grade "drill indicated resource" was present, it did not 
represent a potential "mineable reserve which is of interest to Amax" (Candee, 1996).   
 
In 2001, Coral Gold contracted R.T. McCusker Geological consulting to prepare a review of previous 
drilling activities and provide a resource summary.  The study concluded that at the prevailing gold 
prices of less than $300/oz, a resource containing about 11 million short tons of mineralized material 
averaging 0.053ozAu/t, at an 0.02ozAu/t cutoff grade, were present on the Robertson property (Table 
6.3).   
 
In late 2005, Barnes Engineering was contracted by Coral Gold Resources to undertake a Preliminary 
Assessment of the currently defined mineral resources at the Robertson Property.  The purpose for of 
this study was to update the 2001 resource estimate, include results of the 2004-2005 Coral drilling 
programs (24,000 ft) in the estimate and examine the effect of higher gold price on the economics of 
the existing resources.

In 2007 Coral contracted Beacon Hill Consultants to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate as 
part of a new NI 43-101 technical report.  The new resource study included the 2006 drilling results 
(35,615 ft) and examined the effect of higher gold prices on the resources.  In January 2008, Beacon 
Hill reported an inferred mineral resource estimated to contain 91.3 million tons averaging 0.0253 
ozAu/t and containing about 2.3 million ounces of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.015 ozAu/t (Table 6.6).

 The database comprised a total of 1,160 drill holes, 533,453 feet (162,638 meters) of drilling 
and 101,757 gold assays. 

 The inferred resource covers 6 distinct and separate areas; Distal, 39A, Gold Pan, Porphyry, 
Altenburg Hill, Southern Area and then all remaining blocks outside these areas that warrant 
inclusion as an inferred resource. In addition, Gold Pan, Porphyry and Altenburg Hill were 
separated into oxide and sulphide zones for analysis and modeling. 

 An interpreted mineralized envelope was modeled into a solid in MineSight 3DTM, with six 
area mineralized zones and then separated into oxide and sulphide zones. 

 Block dimensions of 25 feet (7.6 m) north, 25 feet (7.6 m) East and 20 feet (6 m) vertically. 

 Grade interpolation - 20 foot (6 m) composites. 

 Composites greater than 0.075 ozAu/t (2.33 g Au/tonne) limited in influence to 100 feet 
(30.5 m). 

 Tonnage estimates are based on 200 bulk historic density measurements carried out by 
previous operators. These were assigned to each block by zone. The resources are 
categorized as inferred since the amount and distribution of bulk tonnage factor data is 
sparse.

SECTION 7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
Published geological reports describing the regional geology of the Tenabo district include Gilluly 
and Gates (1965), Wrucke (1974), Wrucke and Armbrustmacher (1975), and Stewart (1980).  The 
regional geology of the Tenabo area depicted in Figure 7-1 is modified from a map by Wrucke 
(1974). 
 
The Robertson property lies along the far eastern flank of the Northern Shoshone Mountains in north-
central Nevada within the Basin and Range physiographic province of western North America.  The 
region lies at or very near the rifted margin of continental crust which was subjected to periodic 
contractual deformation starting in Middle Paleozoic and continuing until Late Cretaceous (Stewart, 
1980, Oldow, 1984).  The most important of these events affecting the region is a complex set of 
branching, low-angle faults that are part of the Roberts Mountains thrust fault (RMT).  Forming the 
upper plate of this regionally significant structure are a series of thick, vertically stacked nappes of 
predominately dark-gray, fine-grained siliceous sedimentary and lesser submarine volcanic rocks of 
early to middle Paleozoic age.  During latest Devonian or earliest Mississippian time, these 
eugeosynclinal rocks were transported eastward many tens of miles along segments of the RMT and 
structurally emplaced over a mostly carbonate sequence of similar age that comprise the lower plate.  
While siliceous rocks of the upper plate are widespread in the region, carbonate rocks of the lower 
plate are comparatively rare and are exposed in a few "structural windows" such as the Gold Acres 
and Cortez windows.  Many of the regions gold deposits, including Gold Acres, Cortez, Cortez Hills 
and Pipeline are within or near to structural windows of lower plate carbonate rocks (Roberts, 1966).   
 
Subduction-related calc-alkaline magmatism began as early as Middle Jurassic and continued 
through early Miocene time (Stewart, 1980).  Beginning in the late Eocene, an important episode of 
magmatism gradually swept from northeast to southwest across northern Nevada which was 
accompanied by widespread extensional deformation (Christiansen and Yeats, 1992).  Many of the 
regions largest gold deposits, including those situated along the Carlin and Battle Mountain-Eureka 
trends, are both spatially and temporally related to this period of calc-alkaline Eocene magmatism 
and extensional tectonics (Ressel and Henry, 2006).  Starting about 17 Ma, regional extensional 
block faulting, accompanied by rift-related bimodal basalt-rhyolite magmatism, further modified the 
region resulting in the characteristic basin and range topography encountered in this part of Nevada 
(Dickinson, 2002). 
 
7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Robertson property covers a series of low hills along the west side of Crescent Valley.  The 
property, including the adjacent "Excluded" claims, lies approximately one mile north of the Pipeline 
open pit gold mine and reaches 4.5 miles north to Indian Creek.  The geology of this area is depicted 
in Figure 7-2.  Most of this area is underlain by a thick sequence of mostly fine-grained, siliceous 
sedimentary rocks that are part of the Roberts Mountains allochthon (RMA).  These highly faulted 
and folded rocks are dominated by middle to late Devonian Slaven Chert composed mainly of 
argillite, chert, lesser shale, siltstone and mafic submarine volcanic rocks.  Structurally overlying the 
Slaven Chert along the west, north and east sides of the property are a sequence of rusty brown 
weathering siltstone, sandstone and very minor limestone of the Silurian Elder Sandstone.  Along the 
far west edge of property, many of these rocks are structurally overlain along the Lander thrust fault 
by massive quartzite of the Ordovician Valmy Fm.   
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 7-2 January, 2012  

Portions of the "Excluded" claims in the southwest part of the property cover the northern part of the 
Gold Acres structural window, which exposes a sequence of mostly carbonate rocks in the lower 
plate of the RMT.  These strata consist of silty limestone, weakly to non-calcareous siltstone, 
calcareous mudstone and argillite of the Devonian-lower Mississippian Pilot Shale (Wrucke, 1974).  
However, this unit is remarkably similar to the Devonian-lower Mississippian Rodeo Creek Fm as 
described from the Carlin Trend (Lenardson and Rahn, 1996) where it overlies the Devonian 
Popovich Limestone.  At Gold Acres, this unit conformably (?) overlies thin to thick bedded 
argillaceous to micritic limestone of the Middle Devonian Wenban Limestone which in turn 
conformably overlies a sequence of predominately finely laminated calcareous siltstone of the 
Silurian Roberts Mountains Fm. 
 
Intruding a portion of the upper plate sequence, at the north end of the property, is an elliptical 
shaped granodiorite stock or lacolith (?), along with related dikes and sills that vary in composition 
from dacitic to rhyolitc.  In its long dimension, the Tenabo granodiorite is exposed for 6,000 ft in an 
east-west direction and over 3,000 ft in a north-south direction.  Its long axis is oriented at about 
280°, whereas a set of prominent dike swarms strike approximately 300° to 340°.  In addition, the 
district is transected by a series of E-W-striking sericite-altered feldspar-porphyry dikes that are 
exposed for at least 3.5 miles.  Based on intrusive relationships the feldspar porphyry dike swarm 
appears to be intra-mineral, cutting early Au-Ag (Cu) mineralization but is cross cut by later Ag-Au 
+As-base metal veining.  
 
A series of recent K-Ar age dates indicate that emplacement of the stock took place about 39.35+0.07 
Ma (Henry, 2011, written communication).  A single Re-Os date on molybdenite from the Tenabo 
stock yielded an age of 39.0+1.4 Ma (Kelson, et al., 2005) and K/Ar age dates on adularia and 
sericite indicate that and the age of gold and base metal mineralization is 39.08+0.08 Ma (Henry, 
2011, written communication). Based on two new K-Ar dates, emplacement of widespread post-
mineral rhyolite porphyry dikes and sills is dated at 35.8+0.07 Ma (Henry, written communication).  
Gold mineralization at Robertson is closely associated with emplacement of the Tenabo stock. 
 
7.3 ROBERTSON PROPERTY STRUCTURES 
 
Mineralization at Robertson is strongly controlled by a system of low- and high-angle faults and 
related fracture zones.  Locally, brecciation associated with the granodiorite and hornfels contact 
zones and to a lesser extent axial plane shears in isoclinal folds are also important hosts for 
mineralization.  Although individual structures host ore-grade gold, higher grades commonly occur 
where one or more structures intersect. 
 

7.3.1 Low-Angle Faults 
 
Rocks of the district are cut by a myriad of low-angle thrust faults associated with the emplacement 
of the Roberts Mountains allochthon.  Reactivation of these faults during emplacement of the Tenabo 
intrusive complex created an important fracture system that, in combination with younger high-angle 
faults and/or favorable lithology, strongly control the distribution gold at Tenabo.  A major low-angle 
structural zone is thought to be the principal control of gold distribution in a broad area extending 
from hole AT-1 westward to 99445, a distance of over 3,000 ft, and containing the 39A and Distal 
zone mineral resources.  Detailed logging has shown that portions of this low-angle structural zone 
are filled by a series of sill-like intrusions that form within or parallel to the broad envelope of 
mineralization and (or) alteration.  In addition, at least two narrow and laterally persistent zones of 
open space quartz and sulfide filling and local sulfide replacement are developed within and along a 
series of low-angle faults with similar orientation as the principal fault system.  The sulfide horizons 
are locally disrupted by post-mineral movement along these same low-angle faults.  These 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 7-3 January, 2012  

relationships are summarized in Figure 7-3, a cross section oriented north-northeast and looking 
west.  The location of C-C' is shown in Figure 7-4. 
 

7.3.2 NNW and East-West High-Angle Faults 
 
In addition to the flat-lying thrust faults associated with reactivated segments of the RMT, rocks of 
the district are broken and offset by series of NNW-striking high-angle faults.  Many of these faults 
extend (?) through the Eocene-age stock and are filled locally by younger dikes.  Gold mineralization 
appears closely associated with NNW faults.  A less obvious, but important east-west fault system 
occurs along the north side of the granodiorite stock which likely controlled emplacement of the 
granodiorite stock itself, as well as, the later feldspar porphyry dike swarm.  At least two east-west 
and (or) north-northwest faults are postulated to have controlled mineralization within the 39A Zone.  
Where these faults intersect the principal low-angle fault zone, mineralization is typically thicker and 
higher grade.  Movement along these faults is suspected to be, at least in part, sinistral.  Within the 
Gold Pan zone, higher grade mineralization forms a series of en echelon ore shoots that trend 
generally east-west and are thought to be controlled by this fault zone.   
 

7.3.3 Northeast and North-South High-Angle Faults/Dikes 
 
A subtle NE-trending structural fabric is reflected mainly by a number of dike-filled faults and the 
apparent control exerted on the distribution of gold mineralization.  In the Porphyry Zone, high-grade 
gold is commonly associated with a series of sub-parallel, NE striking faults locally filled by 
granodiorite and (or) igneous breccia dikes.  The highest grades (0.94 ozAu/t) in the Porphyry Zone 
occur at or near the contacts of the dikes where they intersect prominent N-S faults.  However, the 
overall trend of ore-grade (>0.01 ozAu/t) mineralization in the Porphyry Zone is north-south. 
 

7.3.4 Folds 
 
Paleozoic-age upper plate rocks of the district are locally folded into small-scale isoclinal folds that 
typically strike NNW and plunge 5 to 15 to the NNW.  This fold orientation is largely confined to 
the Devonian Slaven Chert.  Strong shearing and brecciation are often well developed along many 
fold axial planes creating additional structural disruption in the rocks and sites for gold deposition.   
 
In contrast, a series of broad, NE-striking open folds are developed in a nappe (?) of Silurian Elder 
Sandstone along the northeast part of the property.  This variation in fold orientation and style 
suggests that these thrust sheets were emplaced separately and from different directions.  A similar, 
broad anticlinal fold is developed in the Porphyry Zone that is more or less coincident with 
mineralization.  This fold, which strikes N-S, is thought to have formed partly in response to 
emplacement of the Tenabo stock.  Mineralization in this zone is strongly controlled by faulting in 
the footwall of a thick dike/sill.  Any influence on the localization of the mineralization by this fold is 
unclear.       
 
Recent geologic mapping and compilation has defined at least one prominent and potentially 
important fold along the west side of the Robertson Property (McCusker, 2007).  The Shoshone 
antiform strikes about N-S and appears to plunge gently northward.  The axis of this fold lies slightly 
west of the prominent ridge separating the Robertson claims from the "Excluded" claims.  Because of 
the many small-scale folds, the Shoshone antiform is not well defined by bedding attitudes alone.  
However, the general pattern and "stratigraphic" position of certain units (greenstone and Elder 
Sandstone) provide convincing evidence for the existence of this structural feature.  The fold is best 
defined in the northern half of the property even though it is disrupted by a series "major" NNW-



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 7-4 January, 2012  

striking high-angle faults.  Many of these mapped faults coincide with major geophysical features 
and abrupt topographic breaks that interrupt the current ridge line.              
 
This fold also affects both the plane of the RMT and lower plate strata where it is defined by bedding 
attitudes in outcrop, from measurements in drill cores and stratigraphic re-construction based on drill 
logs (McCusker, 2007).  As defined in lower plate rocks, the N-S trending fold is broadly asymmetric 
with a shallow dipping west limb and steep or possibly overturned eastern limb.  Because of 
disruption due to NE- and NNW-striking high-angle faults, the actual strike of the fold is unknown.  
However, its general trend appears to be N-S.   
 
As a result of late Tertiary Basin and Range block faulting, rocks along the east side of the northern 
Shoshone Range, including the Tenabo area, have been tilted as much as 10 to 15 to the east 
(Gilluly and Gates, 1965).  This post-mineral tilting resulted in the rotation of the large diorite dike in 
the Porphyry zone, leading to the original interpretation that this intrusion was a thick sill.  The 
tabular mineralized zone associated with the footwall of the diorite dike was also rotated eastward, 
resulting in a shallow westward dip.

7.4 MINERALIZED ZONES 
 
The currently identified mineral resources occur in five zones localized along the northern and 
eastern contact of the Tenabo granodiorite, forming a general east-west trend.  These resources 
include Porphyry, Gold Pan, Altenburg Hill, 39A  and Distal Zones (Figure 7-4).  The Porphyry, 
Gold Pan and Altenburg Hill Zones occur in highly fractured hornfels and skarn units at the contact 
of the granodiorite stock, whereas the 39A Zone is localized at the intersection of a series of high-
angle faults with a major low-angle structural zone in retrograde-altered hornfels.  In addition, an 
emerging mineralized zone referred to as the Distal Zone occurs 1,500 ft northwest of the 39A Zone 
and at least 2,200 ft from the nearest exposure of Tenabo granodiorite.  Gold in the Distal Zone 
occurs in weakly retrograde-altered quartz and calc-silicate hornfels and skarnoid.    
 

7.4.1 Porphyry Zone 
 
In 1994, Amax defined a proven + probable + inferred "mineable reserve" in the Porphyry Zone, 
using a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade that contained 14 million short tons averaging 0.019 ozAu/t.  These 
historic reserves are presented for informational purposes only and do not represent current 
reserves at Robertson.   
 
The Porphyry Zone was re-evaluated in 2009 using a gold cutoff grade of 0.0106 ozAu/t and was 
estimated to contain a total inferred mineral resource of 51.6 Mt (oxide + unoxidized) containing 
about 850,188 ounces of gold.  Approximately 156 RC and 51 diamond core holes define a tabular 
mineralized zone that dips 30º to 45º west, ranges from 50 ft to over 250 ft thick, reaches over 500 ft 
down dip and has a strike length of nearly 3,000 ft.  Depth to the top mineralization varies from 5 ft 
to 30 ft in the south and 125 ft in the north.  Mineralization is mainly fracture controlled with lesser 
amounts occurring as  Approximately one-third of the Porphyry Zone gold resource is mainly 
fracture controlled hosted by a fine-grained margin phase of the Tenabo granodiorite (also called 
diorite) and two-thirds are hosted by biotite, quartz hornfels and retrograde skarn in Elder Sandstone.  
Locally, higher grade gold values occur as narrow replacement horizons in retrograde skarn.  The 
Porphyry Zone is intruded at least two sets of dikes: a NE-striking set that is spatially associated with 
higher gold grades and an E-W-striking set of sericite-altered, post-mineral dikes that dip moderately 
to the south.  The E-W dikes cut the zone and disrupt the continuity of mineralization.  Overburden 
depth varies from none to 30-ft-thick.  The intensity of surficial oxidation is controlled by the density 
of both high- and low-angle fracture zones and lithology.  As a result the redox front forms a 
complex irregular interface that varies from 15 ft to as deep as 450 ft deep.  It is estimated that 76 
percent of the defined resources has undergone at least 50 percent oxidation. These relationships are 
summarized in section, 12,600 N (Figure 7-5) and section 11,500 E (Figure 7-6), which show the 
general geology and potential ore-grade mineralization at a cutoff grade of 0.01 ozAu/t.  The 
locations of section 12,600 N and 11,500 E are shown in Figure 7-4. 
 

7.4.2 39A Zone 
 
The 39A zone is currently defined by 104 RC holes and 4 diamond core holes, totaling about 54,415 
ft.  In 2009 the 39A Zone was estimated to contain 38.9 Mt (sulfide) averaging 0.0228 ozAu/t and 
containing about 887,962 ounces of gold, using a 0.0106 ozAu/t cutoff grade.  Using a 0.01 ozAu/t 
cutoff grade and a minimum of 20 ft thickness, the 39A mineralization forms a stratiform body 
roughly 1,500-ft-long in the principal north-northeast direction and 900-ft-long in the secondary 
west-northwest direction.  Along these principal directions, mineralization averages about 129-ft-
thick and 400-ft-wide.  In the northeasterly direction, the zone plunges about 16 to the north.  In the 
west-northwest direction, the zone plunges from 21-34 to the southeast.  Depth to the top of

mineralization varies from 300 ft at the south end of the zone to 605 ft at the extreme north end.  
Section D-D' (Figure 7-7) through the 39A Zone shows the general geology and distribution of 
potential ore-grade mineralization at a cutoff grade 0.015 ozAu/t.  The location of section D-D' is 
shown in Figure 7-4.   
 
The 39A Zone is characterized by a broadly and strongly developed zone of retrograde alteration 
consisting of fine-grained dark-green actinolite + dark-green to black chlorite and accompanied by 5-
25 percent sulfides as disseminations and local replacement.  Semi-massive sulfide replacement form 
narrow (5-ft to 25-ft-thick), persistent layers that extend along strike up to 250 ft.  The highest gold 
values are generally encountered at or near the base of these sulfide layers.  Major ore controls are 
exerted by the intersection of NNE and WNW striking high-angle structural zones with a low-angle 
fracture system which are represented by the overall shape of the mineralized zone and distribution 
of higher gold grades.  39A mineralization is cut by a set of E-W-striking, sericite-altered post-
mineral feldspar porphyry dikes that dip moderately to the south.  These dikes disrupt continuity of 
mineralization in the southern part of the 39A Zone.         
 

7.4.3 Gold Pan Zone 
 
Gold mineralization in the Gold Pan Zone is confined to a series of high- and low-angle faults 
forming a number of narrow tabular to lenticular zones oriented generally to the northwest.  Based on 
a gold cutoff grade of 0.01 ozAu/t, the zone is roughly 1,500-ft-long in an east-west direction, 500-ft-
wide and at least 200-ft-thick.    The depth to mineralization within the zone ranges from 10 ft to 200 
ft.  The Gold Pan resource is defined by approximately 135 RC holes spaced 100 ft or less apart and 
7 diamond core holes.  At least 90 percent of the holes were drilled vertical with an average depth of 
less than 300 ft.  
 
The west half of the Gold Pan Zone resource is hosted mainly by a sequence biotite hornfels, quartz 
hornfels and locally abundant retrograde skarn replacing greenstone, whereas the eastern half is 
hosted largely by quartz, lesser biotite hornfels and abundant granodiorite sills extending from the 
north contact of the Tenabo granodiorite.  Higher grades (> 0.05 ozAu/t) form a series en echelon 
shoots and veins aligned in an east-west direction that reach 600-ft-long, 100-ft-wide and 50-ft-thick 
(Candee, 1996).  The depth of oxidation varies from up to 200-ft-deep in the east half to 10-75 ft in 
the west.  The redox front in the Gold Pan Zone is complex particularly in areas of strong retrograde 
skarn development.  
 
In 2009, the Gold Pan inferred mineral resources was estimated to contain a total of 45.0 Mt (oxide + 
sulfide) averaging 0.0167 ozAu/t and containing about 752,211 ounces of gold using a 0.0106 ozAu/t 
cutoff grade.  Included in this resource are 12.6 Mt of material classified as oxide, with an average 
grade of 0.02 ozAu/t.   
 

7.4.4 Altenburg Hill Zone 
 
The Altenburg Hill resource occurs along the southeast contact of the Tenabo granodiorite in highly 
fractured and folded hornfels and intrusive rocks (Figure 7-8).  Gold appears confined to fracture 
zones and vein zones cutting biotitized and calc-silicate altered siltstone and sandstone (Candee, 
1996).  Mineralization is also hosted by dikes and sills of granodiorite porphyry.  Less commonly, 
gold distribution is controlled by fractures and breccia bodies developed along minor fold axes.  The 
highest grade gold mineralization is controlled by the intersection of series of NW- and NE-striking 
dike-filled high-angle fault and fracture zones.  The Altenburg Hill Zone is cut by at least one 
sericite-altered, post-mineral feldspar porphyry dike that locally disrupts continuity of mineralization.

As defined by a gold cutoff grade of 0.01 ozAu/t, mineralization forms a coherent tabular zone that 
extends from just south of the top of the Altenburg Hill (5,440 ft) northeastward approximately 1,500 
ft along the north flank of the hill to the northern extent of current drilling. The mineralized zone 
averages about 500 ft wide.  Depth to the top of mineralization varies from outcropping ore-grade 
material to less than 100 ft and generally occurs within 30 ft of the surface.  Mineralization extends 
as deep as 495 ft and individual zones reach up to 145-ft-thick.  Surficial oxidation is strongly 
developed in the Altenburg Hill Zone reaching as deep as 450 ft and affecting approximately 88 
percent of the identified resource.  Locally the redox front forms a complex interface due to 
persistent but thin layers of unoxidized calc-silicate hornfels. Figure 7-8 is a typical cross section 
through the Altenburg Hill resource showing the distribution of gold grading > 0.01 ozAu/t.  
The location of section C-C' is shown on Figure 7-4.      
 
The Altenburg Hill inferred mineral resource is defined by approximately 57 RC holes and 10 
diamond drill holes.  Twenty-five RC and 10 core holes were drilled by Coral between 2006 and 
2010. The remaining 32 RC holes that define the resource were drilled by Amax in 1991 and 1996.  
Total footage is estimated at 22,000 ft. 
 
In 2009, Beacon Hill estimated the total Altenburg Hill inferred mineral resource to be 14.6 Mt 
(oxide + sulfide) averaging 0.0151 ozAu/t and containing 219,510 ounces of gold.  Of this total 
resource, 12.9 Mt averaging 0.0152 ozAu/t are considered oxide.             
 

7.4.5 Distal  Zone 
 
Mineralization in the Distal Zone is hosted by a thick sequence (>100-ft-thick) of locally retrograde-
altered biotite, quartz, calc-silicate hornfels and a thin yellow-brown skarnoid (?) layer.  The highest 
grade gold is within or immediately adjacent to the possible skarnoid layer.  These rocks are cut by at 
least one prominent high-angle fault that strikes NNW and dips steeply southwest.  This fault may 
exert significant control on the distribution of ore-grade mineralization.  The Distal Zone 
mineralization is structurally overlain by a succession of hornfelsed and retrograde-altered 
greenstone followed by a locally hornfelsed sequence of carbonaceous argillite, shale, chert, minor 
siltstone and very minor silty limestone.  The favorable mineralized horizon in The Distal Zone 
appears to be in the same "stratigraphic" position as the mineralized horizon in the 39A Zones, but in 
a more distal position with respect to the Tenabo stock contact.  This is reflected in the higher 
average arsenic values (2,427 ppm) and lower average copper values (337 ppm) in the Distal Zone 
versus lower average arsenic values (577 ppm) and higher copper values (757 ppm) in the 39A Zone.       
 
As shown in Figures 7-9 and 7-10 the "distal target" is currently defined by 14 vertical and 
one inclined RC holes collared from 160 ft to 625 ft apart and totaling 20,140 ft.  The 
location of sections A-A' and B-B' are shown in Figure 7-4.  At present, these holes outline 
an apparently flat-lying mineralized zone at least 1,200-ft-long in a northerly direction, 500-
ft-wide east-west and ranging from 55-ft- to 170-ft-thick with an average thickness of 109 ft 
at a 0.01 oz Au/t cutoff grade.  Except where disrupted by faulting, the continuity of 
mineralization between holes appears good especially for the N-S trending higher grades 
zones.  Near its margin the zone begins to rapidly break up into a series of narrow 
mineralized intervals ranging from 15 ft to 55 ft thick.  Depth to the top of mineralization 
ranges from 800 ft to 995 ft.  A summary of assay results at a 0.05 oz Au/t cutoff grade is 
compiled in Table 7.3.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 7-11 January, 2012  

In 2009, the Distal Zone was estimated to contain an inferred mineral resource of 13.3 Mt averaging 
0.0287 and containing about 383,010 ounces of gold using a 0.0106 ozAu/t cutoff grade.  
 
7.5 HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION 
 
Hydrothermal alteration forms a broadly concentric halo surrounding the Tenabo stock and affecting 
certain rock units as far as 2,000 ft from the stock contact.  Alteration patterns in the district are 
complex due to intense fracturing of the wall rocks, thin bedded nature and rapid compositional 
change that characterize the sedimentary sequence.  Gold-related alteration consist of an early-stage 
intrusion-related potassic, a later "retrograde" skarn(?) stage and still younger quartz (silica)-sericite-
(pyrite) and clay-chlorite-sulfide stages which appear to cut all earlier phases. 
 

7.5.1 Potassic Alteration 
 
Early potassic alteration is widespread and strongly developed in early phases of the intrusion, and is 
often spatially associated with gold mineralization, particularly in the Porphyry and Altenburg Hill 
Zones.  In intrusive rocks, this alteration assemblage is characterized by widespread fine-grained 
secondary biotite replacing coarse-grained magmatic biotite, hornblende and pyroxene, and as 
veinlets accompanied by adularia (Honea, 1994).  Fine secondary biotite also forms narrow 
envelopes surrounding quartz veinlets that cross-cutting early calc-silicate and biotite hornfels, and 
certain phases of the stock.  In several localities, coarse-grained (> 5mm) adularia occurs as fracture 
fillings, accompanies quartz + calcite veins and as cement in several pebble dikes.   Potassic 
alteration is generally associated with Au-Ag (Cu) mineralization having an overall Au to Ag ratio of 
about 1.5:1. 
 

7.5.2 Retrograde Skarn(?) 
 
Gold mineralization at Robertson is closely associated with moderately to strongly retrograde-altered 
quartz + calc-silicate and biotite hornfels.  While not always obvious in deeply oxidized portions of 
mineralized zones both chlorite-actinolite and fine-grained quartz alteration form a strong fracture-
controlled "stockwork" and local pervasive replacement of the biotite and calc-silicate hornfels.  
Locally, the chlorite-actinolite alteration is accompanied by semi-massive to massive sulfides (up to 
50 percent) composed mainly of pyrrohotite, chalcopyrite, marcasite-pyrite, and  arsenopyrite, which 
form 5-ft to 25-ft–thick semi-continuous replacement horizons and (or) open space fracture fillings.  
Gold grades exceeding 0.25 ozAu/t are sometimes, though not always, spatially associated with the 
strongest chlorite-actinolite-sulfide alteration.  While the intensity of chlorite-actinolite alteration 
diminishes rapidly below the semi-massive sulfide layer, the highest gold grades are often 
encountered immediately beneath the sulfide replacement horizons and ore-grade gold values often 
persist well below the bottom of the chlorite-actinolite-sulfide alteration zone. This alteration is 
characterized by Au to Ag ratios of 1:<1.  
 
 

7.5.3 Late Stage Quartz (Silica)-Sericite-(Pyrite) 
 
The youngest (?) gold-related alteration consists of narrow envelopes of quartz (silica)-sericite-
(pyrite) surrounding quartz-sulfide +calcite veins and zones of fine-grained "jasperoidal" 
silicification carrying Au-Ag, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite - tennantite, stibnite, galena, sphalerite and 
chalcopyrite.  The age of the Q-S-(Py) alteration and related mineralization is indicated from its 
relationship with a series of intensely Q-S-(py-mc)-altered, post-mineral dikes that cut proximal Au-

Ag (Cu) skarn-type mineralization in the 39A and Porphyry Zones.  Locally, Au-Ag, As-Sb + Hg, Cu 
+ Pb + Zn veins cut and are hosted by the same post-skarn dikes.  
           

7.5.4 Chlorite-Clay 
 
A late-stage, pale green chlorite + clay (montmorillonite ?), accompanied by coarse-grained euhedral 
pyrite-marcasite and arsenopyrite with minor galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite, forms narrow 
replacement envelopes along fractures cutting hornfels and, less commonly, intrusive rocks.  This 
alteration assemblage occasionally carries moderate to high-grade gold.  The position of the chlorite-
clay assemblage within the alteration sequence is currently equivocal.      
 
7.6 GOLD DISTRIBUTION 
 
A number of unpublished petrographic (both thin and polished sections) and SEM studies to 
determine the distribution, locations and close mineralogical associations of gold in the various 
resource areas were conducted by Russ Honea from 1993 through 1996.  Result of those studies 
indicates that gold occurs mainly as native particles of generally high fineness that range in size from 
2 to 200 microns and average about 40 microns.  Where oxidized gold and rare native silver occur 
mainly as liberated grains that are closely associated with goethite.  In the deeper 39A zone 
(unoxidized), native gold (88-92 % Au) is often associated with arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and 
chalcopyrite.  When present, very minor bismuth tellurides, including tetradymite, hedleyite and 
tellurobismuthite, are closely associated with gold and electrum (minor), which occur as irregular 
blebs on telluride grain margins.   
 
Locally, gold is encapsulated in fine silicate gangue and occurs as small grains hosted by pyrrhotite, 
arsenopyrite and loellingite.  A summary of major and trace minerals identified during the various 
petrographic and SEM examinations are presented in Table 7.1.  Samples used for these studies 
include metallurgical pan concentrates, selected intervals of RC cuttings and diamond drill core.

7.7 COPPER DISTRIBUTION 
 
Copper mineralization is widespread and locally reaches economically significant concentrations on 
the Robertson Property.  Copper is closely associated with ore-grade gold and is best developed in 
the Porphyry Zone, where Cu occurs mainly as secondary sulfides replacing chalcopyrite and pyrite, 
and as lesser oxides.  Within selected five-foot assay intervals containing ore-grade gold (>0.01 
ozAu/t), copper values range from < 0.001 percent to over 9.5 percent, but averages less than 0.02 
percent Cu.  A tabulation of significant copper intercepts in the Porphyry Zone are presented in Table 
7.2.  The weighted average grade from this tabulation is 0.29 % Cu, over an average thickness of 
about 96 feet.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 7-13 January, 2012  

In the 39A Zone, copper occurs primarily as discrete grains of chalcopyrite closely associated with 
pyrrohotite, pyrite-marcasite, and less commonly with arsenopyrite.  Within selected 20 ft composite 
assay intervals containing ore-grade gold (>0.015 ozAu/t), copper values range from 0.009 percent to 
8.28 percent, but averages only about 0.03% Cu.

SECTION 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
8.1 EXPLORATION TARGET CONCEPT 
 
Economic gold mineralization at Robertson is both spatially and temporally associated with the 
Eocene-age Tenabo granodiorite.  Gold mineralization in the Porphyry Zone occurs at the contact 
between a locally potassic-altered, fine-grained phase of the Tenabo granodiorite and calc-silicate 
hornfels and skarnoid units in the Elder Sandstone.  These relationships suggest that this 
mineralization represents a proximal Au-Ag (Cu) skarn system as defined by Orris, et al. (1987) and 
Ray, et al. (1990).  Gold in the Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan zones occur in a similar proximal 
position in biotite and calc-silicate hornfels at the faulted (?) contact of the granodiorite stock, related 
dikes, sills, and irregular diorite endoskarn bodies (Candee, 1996).  The higher-grade 39A Zone is 
strongly controlled by intersecting high-angle fault zones developed in a highly fractured layered 
sequence of retrograde-altered biotite, calc-silicate hornfels and skarnoid.  The deposit is developed 
800 ft to 1,000 ft from the contact of the granodiorite stock and shares many mineralogical and 
geochemical characteristics of "distal" gold skarn, as defined by Ray et al., (1990).     
 
The "Distal" Zone consists of a series of persistent, but narrow flat-lying mineralized zones, situated 
well outside the thermal metamorphic aureole of the stock that are postulated to represent a more 
distal position of the Tenabo Au-Ag (Cu) hornfels/skarn system.  This mineralization is hosted 
locally by biotite, quartz, calc-silicate hornfels and skarnoid which developed in layered sequences of 
silty carbonaceous shale, siltstone and very minor silty limestone.  Along with the lack of hornfels at 
the surface or the presences of intrusive rocks at depth, the highest grade gold mineralization is 
closely associated with an 80-ft-thick sequence of quartz and calc-silicate hornfels and a distinctive 
fine-grained yellow-brown skarnoid layer.  Mineralization is often accompanied by weak retrograde 
actinolite-tremolite-chlorite alteration along with very strong enrichment in arsenic.  
 
Also outside the metamorphic aureole are a series of locally mineralized, NNW-striking moderate to 
high-angle faults marked by discontinuous 5-ft- to +50-ft-thick, weakly to moderately silicified 
breccia zones in argillite, shale and chert.  Surface rock chip sampling and RC drilling of these 
breccia outcrops have returned significant ore grade values.   Many of the anomalous gold values 
from outcrop sampling have not been followed up and at least three ore-grade gold drill intercepts 
remain open along strike and down dip. 
  
High-grade, east-west striking (?), quartz-sulfide + calcite veins and (or) silicified zones with strong 
quartz (silica)-sericite-(pyrite) alteration envelopes, have been defined in the Gold Pan Zone and 
include a number of veins in the Phoenix and Silver Safe mines.  The highest grades (+0.5 ozAu/t) 
occur at intersections with NW-striking faults and fracture zones.  These veins and silicified 
structural zones carry significant values in Au-Ag, As-Sb + Hg, Cu-Pb-Zn.  
 
Deep drilling at Robertson in 2007 intersected Carlin-type (C-T) mineralization in hole TV07-2 
hosted by variably altered limestone in the lower plate of the RMT.  The gold values and trace 
element geochemistry returned in this hole, along with its geologic setting, host rock composition 
and hydrothermal alteration, meet the criteria for sediment hosted C-T mineralization as defined by 
Teal and Jackson (1997).  These criteria include the following features: 
 

 Single to multiple dike-filled faults, locally mineralized and showing evidence of protracted 
episodic movement. 

 Multiple intrusive events (Cretaceous-Late Eocene). 
 Significant gold mineralization in the district (>1million ounces of gold).

 Major NNW- to NW-trending fault zones with intersecting NE-trending faults.    
 Map-scale anticlinal folds in lower plate carbonate rocks. 
 Evidence that faults acted as major fluid conduits (positive geochemistry).  
 Favorable carbonate host strata in the lower plate.    

 
8.2 GEOLOGICAL MODEL FOR THE ROBERTSON PROPERTY 
 
Gold mineralization within the Tenabo intrusive complex exhibits characteristics of an Au-Ag (Cu) 
hornfels/skarn system.  Near-term exploration at Robertson will focus on expanding currently 
defined low-grade near surface resources (Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan Zones) and assess 
their potential to be brought into production.  Longer term, the deeper resources (39A and Distal 
Zones) will be further evaluated for their potential to contribute to future production.  Additional 
continued exploration for high-grade C-T Au mineralization hosted by favorable lower plate rocks 
should also be continued.    
 
The geological setting for these deposit-types includes:  
 

 structural intersections of high-and low-angle faults, 
 replacement of relatively favorable lithologies for development of skarn, 
 late-stage quartz-sulfide + calcite "gash" veins within a strike-slip fault environment, 
 proximity to the tenabo stock for proximal and distal au-ag (cu) hornfels/skarn, 
 Igneous dike-filled faults. 
 Deep high-grade Carlin-type mineralization hosted in lower plate carbonate rocks. 

 
The Robertson Au-Ag (Cu) hornfels/skarn system contains a series of mineralized zones spatially 
associated with an intermediate-composition intrusive complex of late Eocene age.  Gold occurs in 
highly fractured, fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary and lesser volcanic rocks at or near contacts 
with intrusive rocks.  Major fault zones controlled not only emplacement of the Tenabo stock and 
later dike swarms, but also provided pathways as well as sites of deposition for Au-Ag (Cu) 
mineralization.  In northern Nevada, a number of Au-Ag (Cu) skarn systems have become significant 
producing gold mines and several identified mineral resources remain unexploited.  Examples of 
deposits with similar geologic settings include McCoy/Cove mine, Phoenix Project (Battle Mountain 
district), Buffalo Valley mine and Redline prospect, all of which are on the Battle Mountain-Eureka 
trend.    
 
At Robertson local Au-As-Hg + Sb anomalies, thought to represent leakage of potential Carlin-type 
mineralization, occur in upper plate rocks outside or near the edge of Ag-base metal zones located 
southwest and north-northwest of the Tenabo stock (Figure 7-1).  Similar relationships are described 
at Cove/McCoy where Au-Ag base metal retrograde skarn occurs at or near contacts with the Eocene 
age Brown stock, with fracture controlled sediment hosted Ag-Au base metal mineralization in a 
distal position and "true" Carlin-type mineralization located at the outer margin of the Ag-base metal 
mineralization (Johnston, 2000).  Also, the close spatial and partly cross cutting relationship of a 
Carlin-type gold system in the East and West Archimedes deposits with Ag-base metal 
mineralization at Eureka, Nevada (Dilles et al., 1996), suggests a genetic association between the two 
assemblages that may also exist at Robertson.

SECTION 9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
9.1 PRE-CORAL EXPLORATION ACTIVITY 
 
The most important modern exploration activity prior to Coral's involvement in the property are 
those of Superior Oil (1968-70) and E & B Exploration (1980-81).  The intersections of  high-grade 
gold in holes T 29 (20 ft/1.154 ozAu/t) and T 83 (10 ft/0.525 ozAu/t), near the Gold Pan mine by 
Superior, along with at least six +100-ft-thick drill intercepts of lower grade mineralization, were the 
first indications that real potential for open-pit-mineable gold existed on the property.   E & B 
Exploration advanced the property by undertaking the first district-wide mapping and sampling 
programs which succeeded in identifying a number of high priority gold anomalies.  More 
importantly, they followed up the Superior drilling results in the Gold Pan Zone and provided a basis 
for defining a resource in that area.   
 
9.2 CORAL GOLD EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES (1986-1989) 
 
Exploration of the district by Coral during the period 1986-89, focused mainly on developing a 
resource base from which a mineable reserve could be defined.  As a result, much of their activity 
was confined to drilling the known resource areas at Gold Pan, Gold Quartz and Gold Quartz 
Extension (West).  At this time Coral also contracted two geophysical surveys (Barringer, 1987 and 
E-Scan, 1988) and an extensive geochemical orientation study (Barringer, 1987).  None of these 
studies provided significant encouragement.  During 1988, Coral decided to place the Gold Quartz 
West and poorly defined Gylding zones into production.  But overly optimistic and aggressive 
resource estimates, and poor geological understanding resulted in less than expected head grades and 
poor heap leach recoveries.  This ultimately led to the decision to halt mining less than a year later.  
In 1989, Coral focused its exploration in the upper Triplet Gulch area, where several widely scattered 
drill intercepts provided some encouragement.  However, additional drilling has failed to define even 
a modest resource in this area.   
 
9.3 AMAX GOLD ACTIVITIES (1990-1996) 
 
From 1990, until they withdrew from the agreement, Amax completed a district-wide exploration 
program that included drilling of over 176,000 ft of combined RC and diamond core, detailed 
geological and geochemical reconnaissance of the entire claim block (including the Excluded 
Claims), rock chip and mine dump sampling, detailed geological mapping and site-specific 
geophysics.  During that time period, Amax identified the 39A, Porphyry, and Altenburg Hill Zones 
and continued to define the previously identified Gold Pan Zone.  As a result of the detailed 
reconnaissance stream sediment and follow-up rock chip sampling programs, a series of strong gold 
anomalies were identified within the claim block, but outside the main district.  In 1999, Cortez drill-
tested one of the Amax anomalies that was outlined on the Lander Ranch claims.  
 

9.3.1 39A Zone 
 
Beginning in 1990, Amax drilled three "deep" RC holes totaling about 9,340 ft to test the concept 
that potential high-grade gold mineralized hosted by lower plate carbonate rocks existed at depth in 
the Tenabo district.  All of the holes failed to reach the lower plate, but did provide substantial 
encouragement for near surface gold resources.  These holes ultimately led to discovery of the higher 
grade 39A Zone near the west end of the district.  As constrained by a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade, the 
39A Zone is currently defined by 104 RC and 4 core holes, totaling about 54,415 ft, including 13 RC 
holes drilled by Cortez in 1999 and 58 RC holes drilled by Coral Gold Resources in 2004-2008.

Table 9.1 is a compilation of significant gold intercepts from holes drilled in the 39A Zone, using a 
0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade and a 20 ft minimum thickness.   
 

9.3.2 Porphyry Zone 
 
Sampling a series of small bedrock exposures at the east end of the district in areas disturbed by 
historic placer mining, returned ore-grade results from highly fractured outcrops of potassic-altered, 
fine-grained diorite.  Follow-up RC drilling encountered several +150-ft-thick intervals of low-grade 
Au mineralization beginning at the bedrock surface.  Later, after a series of wide spaced RC holes, it 
was determined that a potentially large, shallow, low-grade oxidized resource was present.  This led 
to grid drilling on approximately 120-ft-centers with 147, mostly vertical RC holes and 50 core holes, 
for a combined total of about 80,000 ft of drilling.  The drilling defined a proven + probable mineral 
reserve estimated to contain 13,556,125 short tons of ore at a grade of 0.019 ozAu/t and containing 
about 255,000 ounces of gold (Amax, 1994).  The presentation of data form this historic mineral 
reserve is intended to provide context for the Amax exploration activities and should not be 
construed as representing a current mineable reserve.  A compilation of significant gold 
intercepts from holes drilled in the Porphyry Zone are presented in Table 9.2.  
 

9.3.3 Altenburg Hill Zone 
 
As a result of ore-grade gold values returned from several surface rock chip samples on Altenburg 
Hill and significant gold in follow-up grid soil sampling, a series of 15 shallow, vertical and inclined 
RC holes were drilled in 1993 by Amax.  Results of this drilling suggested potential for shallow, 
structurally controlled, low-grade mineralized zone.  In 1996, these intercepts were followed up by 
grid drilling on approximately 100-ft-centers with 38 vertical RC holes and one core hole, totaling 
9,485 ft.  The drilling defined an indicated resource of 3,500,000 short tons of mineralized material 
with an average grade of 0.018 ozAu/t, using a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade (Candee, 1996).  The 
presentation of data form this historic mineral resource estimate is intended to provide context 
for the Amax exploration activities and should not be construed as representing a current 
mineable reserve.

9.3.4 Gold Pan Zone 
 
Also in 1996, Amax drilled 25 RC holes in the previously identified and partly defined Gold Pan 
Zone resource area.  The drilling was designed to provide further detail on the distribution and 
continuity of high-grade mineralization, as well as close off possible extensions to mineralization 
along the northwest edge of the zone.  Upon completion of this program an indicated resource of 
8,300,000 short tons of mineralized material with an average grade of 0.024 ozAu/t, using 0.01 
ozAu/t cutoff grade, was estimated by Amax to be present in the Gold Pan Zone (Candee, 1996).

9.4 CORTEZ ACTIVITIES (1999) 
 
In 1999, Cortez completed a 56,000 ft RC drilling program comprised of 47 holes that  focused on 
extending the 39A mineralization, following up gold-anomalous surface samples mainly in upper 
Mill Gulch with a series of shallow trenching and testing a series of NW trending structures in upper 
Triplet Gulch (Hebert, 1999).  Additionally, Cortez completed a grid enzyme leach survey over the 
pediment gravel east of Altenburg Hill, which was followed up by drilling a single 3,000-ft-deep 
mud rotary hole.  A series of four RC holes were drilled in the vicinity of AT-3 to test a mineralized 
zones thought to represent a distal position of the porphyry system.  Finally, single 1,500-ft-deep RC 
hole was drilled on the Lander Ranch claims, located about one mile north of the main district, to test 
a group of strong gold-anomalous surface samples taken from a moderately silicified fault breccia.   
 
In the 39A Zone, Cortez focused 13 RC holes along an apparent NE-SW trend of mineralization 
testing for possible extensions of the zone.  Only three of the holes encountered significant 
mineralization, but they failed to substantially expand the zone.   
 
Four step-out holes were drilled by Cortez in the vicinity of AT-3, providing additional evidence that 
distal hornfels-skarnoid mineralization, hosted by a thick sequence of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks 
and forming a broad zone up to 800 ft in a NNW direction and 350 ft to the northeast. 
 
A single 1,500-ft-deep RC hole was completed in the vicinity of a mineralized fault zone on the 
Lander Ranch claim block, which encountered significant gold values in two intervals from deep in 
the hole.  These intersections suggest that ore-grade mineralization encountered in this drill hole at 
1,100 ft may extend to the surface where ore-grade samples have been taken.  
 
The deep mud-rotary-drill hole (99432) collared on an enzyme-leach-generated anomaly in the 
pediment east of Altenburg Hill, failed to cut any significant gold values and remained in siliceous 
upper plate rocks.  The hole is located very close to the sites of USGS drill holes No. 2 and 3, 
diamond core holes that reached over 2,000-ft- and 1,250-ft-deep, respectively (Wrucke, 1974).  
Except for hole No. 3, which end in granodiorite of the Tenabo stock, these holes also encountered 
thick intervals of siliceous upper plate rocks. 
 
9.5 CORAL GOLD RESOURCES ACTIVITIES (2004-2006) 
 
During 2004 and 2005, Coral conducted three drilling programs consisting of 32 RC holes totaling 
24,020 ft on the Robertson Property.  The focus of this exploration was to expand and further define 
the 39A Zone, test the "deep" Gold Pan Zone for extensions of the 39A Zone and offset previous ore-
grade intersections in the "distal target area".  Results of the 2004-2005 drilling programs succeeded 
in increasing the contained ounces in the 39A Zone by expanding the area of higher-grade gold 
within the defined resource area and by modestly expanding the resource to the north and east. A 
total of 22 holes were directed at expanding and testing continuity of the 39A Zone.   
 
In 2006, Coral completed 48 RC holes totaling 35,615 ft on the Robertson Property.  This drilling 
program focused on expanding and defining the 39A, Altenburg Hill and Porphyry Zone mineral 
resources, and offset drilling of the emerging Distal Zone.   
 
A summary of Coral's 2004-2006 drilling programs were previously reported in the NI 43-101 
compliant technical report Mineral Resource Estimate for the Robertson Property, Lander County, 
Nevada, USA (Stokes et al., 2008) available on SEDAR.

Also during 2006, Coral completed a program designed to evaluate the potential of its Robertson 
Property to host deep CT-type gold deposits in favorable carbonate rocks in the lower plate of the 
RMT.  The program consisted of geological mapping, 100 m x 100 m grid soil sampling (1,032 
samples), collecting about 196 rock chip/dump samples and conducting a detailed gravity survey 
(300 stations/400m spacing).   
 
The 2006 soil samples were submitted to ALS Chemex for sample prep and multi-element analysis.  
All samples were dry screened to +80 mesh-10 mesh.  The -80 mesh and +10 mesh fractions were 
discarded.  The samples were then pulverized to approximately 80 % passing -80 mesh and analyzed 
for Au by FA/AA, using a one-assay ton charge, and multi-element analyses using a combination of 
ICP-MS (inductive coupled plasma with mass spectroscopy) and ICP-AES (inductively coupled 
plasma with atomic emission spectroscopy) using a 5 g sample and aqua-regia digestion.  The gold 
determination using FA/AA has a lower limit of detection (LLD) =5 ppb.  The multi-element (61 
elements) analysis using a combination ICP-MS and ICP-AES included Ag (LLD=0.01 ppm), As 
(LLD=0.2 ppm), Sb (LLD=0.05 ppm), Hg (LLD=0.01 ppm), Tl (LLD=0.02 ppm), Ba (LLD=10), Bi 
(LLD=0.01 ppm), Se (LLD=1 ppm), Cu (LLD=0.2 ppm), Mo (0.05 ppm), Pb (LLD=0.2 ppm), and 
Zn (LLD=2 ppm).    
 
In 2006, Coral collected 196 rock chip and mine dump samples from the area of the recently acquired 
View claims and from the NW part of the Robertson property.  Samples were analyzed by ALS 
Chemex for Au by FA/AA with a lower limit of detection (LLD) of 5 ppb.  Multi-element 
determinations were made using a combination of inductively coupled plasma with mass 
spectroscopy and atomic emission spectroscopy for 61 elements including Ag (LLD=0.01 ppm), As 
(LLD=0.2 ppm), Sb (LLD=0.05 ppm), Hg (LLD=0.01 ppm), Tl (LLD=0.02 ppm), Ba (LLD=10), Bi 
(LLD=0.01 ppm), Se (LLD=1 ppm), Cu (LLD=0.2 ppm), Mo (0.05 ppm), Pb (LLD=0.2 ppm), and 
Zn (LLD=2 ppm). 
 
Coral completed a detailed gravity survey during 2006 that covered all of the Robertson property as 
well as adjacent portions of the Excluded claims and claims owned by Cortez (with their permission).  
The survey was planned, supervised and the data interpreted by Bob Ellis, a consulting geophysicists. 
The acquisition and processing of the gravity data was completed by Magee Geophysical Services 
using state-of the-art gravity meters with high-accuracy GPS units to determine UTM coordinates 
and altitude of gravity stations.  Gravity measurements were taken at approximately 300 stations 
spaced roughly 400 meters apart.  In addition, Coral acquired detailed gravity data for the adjacent 
Lander Ranch and Blue Nugget claims as well as compiling all public domain gravity data     
 
Result of these studies defined at least two target areas: The NNW-striking high-angle Try and 
Tomcat fault zones. Both are strongly developed structural zones that reach >5,000 ft along strike 
and up to 1,000 ft wide and show evidence of recurrent movement over a long time period.  Certain 
fault segments are filled by multiple igneous dikes and contain local zones of strong silica-clay 
alteration that carry gold values up to 6.06 ppm and arsenic values >10,000 ppm.  These structural 
zones are further defined by coincident linear gravity and magnetic features interpreted to represent 
deep expressions of the faults mapped at surface.  Evidence that these structural zones served as 
important conduits for the transport of gold is provided by soil and rock geochemistry which define a 
series of strong gold-arsenic and silver-base metal anomalies that coincide precisely with the areal 
extent of the mapped faults zones and geophysical linear features (McCusker, 2007).

SECTION 10.0 DRILLING 
 
10.1 CORAL DRILLING (2007) 
 
Because of various permitting delays in 2007, Coral was unable to drilling targets in the "Core" area 
of the Robertson Property.  Instead, Coral drilled two vertical flooded reverse circulation holes that 
tested deep targets which were identified along the west side of Coral's Robertson claim block during 
the 2006 evaluation.  Holes TV07-1 and TV07-2 were drilled to depths of 2,990 ft and 3,450 ft, 
respectively.  TV07-1 intersected a thick sequence of fine grained siliceous sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks followed by biotite and quartz hornfels equivalents in the upper plate of the RMT. Although 
the hole failed to reach the lower plate rocks, it did intersect a number of narrow low-grade zones.  
TV07-2 was collared along a dike-filled splay of the Try fault zone and intersected limey mudstone 
in the lower plate of the RMT starting at 3,080 ft.  The hole returned a 200-ft-thick interval of weakly 
to strongly anomalous gold values ranging from 0.031 to 2.190 ppm gold, hosted by altered lower 
plate carbonates rocks (McCusker, 2008).  A summary of significant assay results for the 2007 deep 
drilling are presented in Table 10.1.

10.2 CORAL DRILLING (2008) 
 
During 2008, Coral completed 33 RC drill holes totaling 22,835 ft.  Of the total drilling, 15 vertical 
holes were drilled on the north flank of Altenburg Hill mainly as infill and offset of the wide spaced 
2006 drilling.  Six holes were completed in the gravel-covered South Porphyry Zone, an extension to 
the Porphyry Zone, as follow up of the intercept in CR06-30 (140 ft/0.04 ozAu/t).  The six vertical 
holes were offset up to 350 ft east and 420 ft north of CR06-30.  Seven vertical holes were drilled in 
the 39A Zone to test the potential for expanding the current resource to the northeast and five vertical 
holes were completed in the Distal Zone to test for extensions north and west of the currently defined 
resource.  Assay results for the 2008 drilling program are presented in Table 10.2. 
 

10.2.1 Altenburg Hill Zone 
 
The infill and offset drilling of the 2006 drilling in the Altenburg Hill Zone resulted in a modest 
expansion and increased confidence in the continuity of mineralization.  The drilling also indicated 
that mineralization remains open for potential expansion northward and with limit expansion both to 
the east and west of the current resource.  The most significant assay results were returned in holes 
CR08-21 (100 ft / 0.019 ozAu/t starting at surface), CR08-26 (130 ft/0.020 ozAu/t from 25 ft), 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 10-2 January, 2012  

CR08-30 (160 ft/0.023 ozAu/t from 5 ft) and CR08-31 (135 ft/0.018 ozAu/t from surface).  These 
intervals were calculated using 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade.    
 

10.2.2 South Porphyry 
 
The results from offset drilling in the gravel-covered South Porphyry Zone indicate that 
mineralization diminishes rapidly to the east but is continuous to the north for at least 350 ft.  Hole 
CR08-37 was collared 350 ft north of CR06-30 and intersected 135 ft averaging 0.020 ozAu/t from 
135 ft, under 30 ft of gravel, and CR08-38 was located 125 ft north of CR06-30 and returned 50 ft 
averaging 0.039 ozAu/t from 160 ft, followed by 50 ft averaging 0.017.  Mineralization in both holes 
is disrupted by a series of E-W striking post-mineral feldspar porphyry dikes.   
 

10.2.3 39A Zone 
 
Drilling in the 39A Zone resulted in a modest expansion to the northeast of CR06-8 (125 ft/0.084 
ozAu/t from 615 ft).  CR08-13 was collared 105 ft to the northeast and returned 100 ft/0.075 ozAu/t 
starting at 680 ft, CR08-17, collared 355 ft northeast intersected 90 ft/0.057 ozAu/t from 820 ft and 
CR08-16 located 560 ft northeast returned 130 ft/0.014 ozAu/t starting at 830 ft.  These results, as 
well as other holes in this area, indicate that higher grade 39A mineralization is diminishing to the 
northeast but that lower grade gold values continue to define the zone. 
 

10.2.4 Distal Zone 
 
Drilling in the Distal Zone clearly identified the west edge of mineralization and a single hole CR08-
1 drilled north of the zone returned only scattered low-grade gold values suggesting that 
mineralization is diminishing in that direction.  However, offsetting CR06-16 (110 ft/0.068 ozAu/t 
from 955 ft), the southern-most hole in the Distal Zone 125 ft to the southeast, intersected 120 ft 
averaging 0.071 ozAu/t from 910 ft, including 10 ft that average 0.354 ozAu/t, in CR08-6.  Drilling 
results indicate potential for expanding the Distal Zone resource farther south.

10.3 CORAL DRILLING (2010) 
 
During 2010, Coral completed 12 RC holes totaling 8,000 ft in the lower Triplet Gulch area where a 
previously identified historic resource was located.  The purpose of this drilling was to verify the 
gold grade, reported thickness and continuity of mineralization in this zone.  Also in 2010, 14 HQ-
diameter diamond drill holes totaling 6,450 ft were completed as twins of existing RC holes in the 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 10-6 January, 2012  

South Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan Zones to test the reliability and continuity of gold 
grades returned by RC drilling acquire specific gravity and geotechnical data. 
 

10.3.1 Lower Triplet Gulch RC Drilling 
 
The primary purpose of this drilling program was to verify the historic drilling results used to 
calculate the Triplet Gulch (also referred to as the "South Zone") inferred mineral resource in the 
2008 NI 43-101 Technical Report (Stokes, et al., 2008).  In addition, the drilling was also directed at 
expanding the resource. 
  
To evaluate the validity of this resource, Coral conducted a 12-hole RC program drilled on a grid 
with holes spaced 500 ft apart on lines also spaced 500 ft apart (Figure 10-6).  The program consisted 
of 12 vertical RC holes, CR10-1 through CR10-12, totaling 8,000 ft and ranging in depth from 600 ft 
to 1,000 ft.  Only two of the 12 RC holes, CR10-7 and -8, were completed to 1,000 ft.  A summary of 
assay results, using a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade is shown in Table 10.3. 
 
The Triplet Gulch drilling occurred in an alluvial covered area that lies between 2,000- 4,000 ft 
southeast of the exposed southern contact of Tenabo granodiorite.  The area is also 3,000 ft south of 
the Altenburg Hill inferred resource.  Rocks exposed in the immediate vicinity if the drilling are 
mainly thermally metamorphosed upper plate greenstone, chert and argillite of the Devonian Slaven 
Chert, which are converted locally to biotite and quartz hornfels.  Based on mapping and drilling, the 
overburden ranges from a few feet to 125-ft-thick. 
 
The 2010 drilling results indicate that the while broad zones of anomalous gold values (>0.1 ppm) 
are present in the Lower Triplet Gulch area, only widely scattered narrow and discontinuous intervals 
of mineralization exceeding 0.01 ozAu/t were encountered.  These results cast serious doubt as to the 
validity of the historic drilling and assaying that are the basis of the "South Zone" inferred mineral 
resource.  The South Zone resource represents about 5.6% of the total of the total Robertson inferred 
mineral resources.    
 

10.3.2 Diamond Drilling (2010)    
 
Also in 2010, Coral completed a 14-hole diamond drilling program (CC10-1 through CC10-10 and 
CC10-12 through CC10-15) aimed at accessing the reliability and continuity of mineralization 
returned in the 2008 RC drilling in the South Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan Zones.  Core 
drilling also provided geological and geotechnical data (RQD), and bulk samples for metallurgical 
testing.  Eleven of the 14 core holes were drilled as twins of existing RC holes and were collared 
between 4 ft and 17 ft from their respective twin RC holes and with less than one foot of collar 
elevation difference.  The drilling produced 960 twinned sample pairs, each representing a "twinned" 
five foot assay interval.  A summary of assay results for the 2010 diamond drilling is presented in 
Table 10.4. 
 
To compare the core vs. RC results the global average grades returned by all the core and 
corresponding twin RC holes were calculated.  The average for all twin RC holes is 0.011 ozAu/t 
whereas the average grade of all core holes is 0.0107 ozAu/t, a difference of 0.0003 ozAu/t.  If the 
top one percentile of assays is removed from the data

Calculated using a 0.010 ozAu/t cutoff grade 
 
(>2.244 ppm Au for RC and >3.296 ppm Au for core), the RC holes average 0.01 ozAu/t and core 
holes average 0.0095 ozAu/t, a difference of 0.0005 ozAu/t.  In both cases the average grade for all 
core holes is slightly lower than the twinned RC holes by 2.7 percent and 5 percent, respectively.  
The correlation coefficient for the two data sets is 0.2705, indicating that short range correlation of 
the assay data is poor. 
 
When compared on a grade zone basis, defined by the 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade and at comparable 
elevations, the RC holes averaged 0.0225 ozAu/t and the cores holes averaged 0.0232 ozAu/t, a 
difference of 0.007 ozAu/t (+3 percent higher in core).  Individual grade zones in twinned RC holes, 
defined by a 0.01 ozAu/t cutoff grade, are well reproduced in the corresponding core holes.  When 
the average grade and thickness of all intervals within the defined grade zones are compared between 
the twin core and RC, the difference is 0.0014 ozAu/t and less than one foot in thickness. 
 
These analyses indicate that while individual assay intervals vary between the 2008 twinned RC 
holes and the 2010 core holes, the corresponding grade zones are well within the acceptable range of

10.4 DRILLING PROCEDURES 
 
The Robertson Property has had a long and varied drilling history during which time at least 1,238 
drill holes totaling 512,737 ft have been completed.  About 13 percent of the total footage drilled 
occurred prior to Coral's involvement in the property.  As a result, much of the documentation 
regarding the early drilling programs is no longer available.  What remains available is a digital 
compilation produced by Amax in the early 1990's, that includes collar coordinates in local mine and 
UTM grid systems, elevation in feet, assay interval, and gold assay value.  The sources of this 
information were manual compilations by Coral and Amax taken from driller's logs, assay reports 
and assay certificates.  In most cases no geologic logs were available. 
 
The drilling methods employed by some early explorers are unknown (e.g. Aaron) or are not 
precisely known.  It is known that the Superior and Placer Development drilling programs employed 
both conventional rotary drilling methods and "percussion" drilling methods.  Conventional "open 
hole" rotary methods produce generally unreliable results because of chronic contamination problems 
and poor sampling technique.  Except where twin RC or DDH have verified the original assays, 
much of the early results were not used in resource evaluations.  Table 10.5 provides a summary of 
drilling in the district by companies known to have operated there since about 1968.

The E & B Exploration drilling is described in various reports by J. DeLeen (1980 and 1981) as 
"percussion", but it is believed to have been reverse circulation.  Except for the Amax digital 
compilation, the only remaining record of the E & B drilling is a complete set of drill cuttings 
retained for each sample interval.  In addition, approximately 20 chip boards have also been 
preserved.  The cuttings are stored on site in 20-compartment plastic chip trays identified by hole 
number and footage.  E & B routinely sampled the drill holes on even 5-ft intervals.  Of the 148 
"percussion" holes drilled by E & B, the majority of which were 200 ft or less in depth and all were 
drilled vertical. 
 
In 1987, Coral developed a local north-south, east-west survey grid consisting of surveyed 
triangulation stations.   All of the pre-Coral drill collars located in the field were subsequently tied to 
the local grid.  Elevation control was determined from the USGS "Tenabo" bench mark (5,164.1 ft) 
situated at the east edge of the local survey grid. 
 

10.4.1 Coral RC Drilling (1986-1989) 
 
Documentation of the Coral RC and core drilling is incomplete.  At the time of the Amax 
compilation (c.1991-92), the Coral drilling records were well organized and complete, and included 
driller's logs, sample interval, and assay report.  Of the 380 RC holes drilled by Coral, the majority 
were less 250-ft-deep and fewer than 20 holes were inclined.  Most holes had summary geologic logs 
and are on file in Coral's Crescent Valley office.  The summary logs are included in the Amax digital 
compilation.  A complete set of drill cuttings are retained for each RC sample interval and are stored 
on site in 20-compartment plastic chip trays identified by hole number and footage.  Sampling was 
routinely done on even 5-ft-intervals over the length of the hole, including overburden.  All drill 
collars were surveyed and tied to the local mine grid.  No down-hole surveys were done on the Coral 
RC holes.      
 
The majority of the Coral RC drilling was completed by two local drilling contractors: Eklund 
Drilling Company of Elko, NV and Rimrock Drilling also of Elko.  The 7 core holes were drilled by 
Coates Drilling of Delta, B.C., Canada.

10.4.2 Amax RC Drilling 
 
The methodology of the Amax RC drilling is well documented.  Amax completed 342 RC holes, AT-
1 through AT-341, totaling nearly 142,000 ft.  Over 90 percent of the RC holes were drilled vertical 
to depths ranging from 400 ft to 2,830 ft (AT-3).  Overburden depths varied from none to 60 ft.  
Where thin overburden was encountered, a minimum of 10 ft of steel surface casing was installed.  In 
deeper overburden, 20 ft to 40 ft of steel casing was installed.  Drill hole diameter averaged 5.5 
inches and samples were collected on even 5-ft interval starting at the overburden-bedrock interface.  
Because of the low-angle orientation or flat-lying nature of most mineralized zones at Robertson, 
sample length (5 ft) is believed to represent true thickness.   
 
Most RC holes drilled to depths of <1,000 ft, were completed using conventional down-the-hole 
hammer bits with conventional cross over assembly.  Holes exceeding 1,000 ft feet were completed 
using standard tricone bits.  All RC holes exceeding a depth of 400 ft had down-hole surveys using a 
multi-reading magnetic vertical deviation tool.  Measured deflection in deeper hole ranged up to 105 
ft, but averaged about 55 ft and is not considered serious.  Surveys were conducted by Century 
Geophysics of Elko, NV.  Prior drilling experience indicate that hole less than 400 ft deep had 
negligible deflection.  Drill collars were surveyed and tied to the local grid system by registered 
surveyors from Desert Mountain Surveying of Winnemucca, NV. 
 
Character samples for each 5-ft assay interval were collected from the reject port of the sample 
splitter and logged at the drill site.  The drill cuttings are stored in 20-compartment plastic chip trays 
and stored on site.  Geologic observations were recorded on standardized logging forms and included 
percentage oxidation, primary and secondary lithology, alteration and mineralization.  The Amax 
drill logs are no longer in the possession of Coral. 
 
The drilling contractor for 90 percent of the holes was Eklund Drilling Company of Elko, NV.  The 
remaining holes were drilled by Lang Exploratory Drilling of Salt Lake City, UT and Becker Drills 
of Denver, CO.  All of the contractors are well regarded and highly experienced. 
 

10.4.3  Amax Diamond Drilling 
 
Amax completed 62 DDH, CAT-1 through CAT-62, totaling over 34,000 ft.  The principal drilling 
contractor was Longyear Drilling of Dayton, NV, a well-respected drilling company, who generally 
preformed above industry standard.  The initial four core holes were completed by Tonto Drilling 
Company of Spokane, WA.  At that time, their performance on the project was considered 
substandard due to their poor core recovery efforts. 
 
Of the 62 DDH, 56 were drilled using HQ-diameter (2.5 inches) diamond impregnated bits, 5-ft core 
barrels and wire-line method.  Six holes were inclined and nine were drilled using PQ-diameter (3.33 
inches) tools in order to collect samples for metallurgical testing (column leach tests).  Core 
orientation studies were attempted in four of the HQ core holes with only limited success.  All hole 
collars were surveyed and tied to the local grid coordinate system.  Down-the-hole surveys were 
completed on 90 percent of the core holes using a standard single shot camera survey tool.  Shots 
were taken at regular 100 ft intervals. 
 
Core was retrieved from the drill site in standard waxed cardboard core boxes (5 ft/box).  Wooden 
blocks indicating footage were placed at the end of each core run by the driller.  Prior to logging, the 
core was measured and marked into even 5-ft or less sample intervals.  The percentage of core 
recovery was determined and RQD data collected and recorded on a standardized form.  The core 
was cleaned of drilling mud and grease, and photographed.  Detailed geologic observations of the

core were made using a standardized logging form.  Key observations included percent oxidation, 
primary and secondary lithology, alteration, mineralization and structure.  In addition, 15 secondary 
fields were also visually estimated.  Small lengths of representative core were collected at regular 
intervals over the entire length of the holes as a visual record.  The "skeleton" core is stored on site in 
standard cardboard core boxes identified with hole number and footage interval.  Individual core is 
identified by hole number and footage in permanent marker. 
 

10.4.4  Cortez RC Drilling 
 
The Cortez drilling consisted of 46 RC holes totaling 54,000 ft and one "mud rotary" hole drilled to a 
depth of 3,000 ft.  The RC drilling contractor was Eklund Drilling Company of Elko, NV, a well-
respected and experienced drilling company.  The mud rotary hole was completed by the Lang 
Division of Boart Longyear of Salt Lake City, UT, a well-respected and experienced drilling 
company. 
 
Of the 46 RC holes 34 were drilled to a depth of between 1,000 ft to 2,000 ft and 12 were drilled to a 
depth of 500 ft to 900 ft.  Twelve holes were inclined from 52 to 62.  All of the RC holes had 
down-hole surveys using a multi-reading magnetic vertical deviation tool.  The surveys were 
conducted by Silver State Surveys, Inc., of Elko, NV.   None of the measured deflection is considered 
serious. 
 
Cortez routinely sampled the RC holes at 10-ft intervals over the entire length of the hole. Because of 
the low-angle orientation or flat-lying nature of most mineralized zones at Robertson, sample length 
(10 ft) is believed to represent true thickness.  No geologic logging was completed and no other 
details, except assay results were provided.  Character samples were collected for each 10-ft assay 
interval in 20-compartment plastic chip trays which are stored off-site. 
 

10.4.5  Coral RC Drilling (2004-2006, 2008 and 2010) 
 
The methodologies employed during the period 2004 through 2010 for the various Coral RC drilling 
programs are well documented.  During that time period Coral completed 125 RC holes totaling 
90,470 ft.  A summary of the Coral RC drilling from 2004 through 2010 is presented in Table 10.6.  
Depths of the holes varied from 345 ft to 1,500 ft.  Overburden depths ranged from none to 125 ft. A 
total of 122 of the RC holes were drilled vertical to depths ranging from 345 ft to 1,500 ft.  Three 
holes were inclined at angles of between 60 and 70 and drilled to depths of 600 ft to 725 ft.  Where 
thin overburden was encountered, a minimum of 10 ft of steel surface casing was installed.  In deeper 
overburden, 20 ft to 40 ft of steel casing was installed.  Drill hole diameter averaged 5.5 inches and 
samples were collected on even 5-ft interval starting at the overburden-bedrock interface.  Because of 
the low-angle orientation or flat-lying nature of most mineralized zones at Robertson, sample length 
(5 ft) is believed to represent true thickness. 
 
The drilling was conducted using truck-mounted TH-75 Ingersoll Rand and Drill Tech D40K drills 
with 900 cfm/350 psi compressors.  These drills employ air-cyclone sample collection equipment that 
meet current industry standard.  Auxiliary air compressors were employed when extremely hard rock 
conditions were encountered.  Standard care was taken to minimize contamination during all parts of 
sampling procedure.  In addition, a geologist was at the drill site during all phases of the drilling and 
sampling procedure.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 10-14 January, 2012  

Most RC holes drilled to depths of <1,000 ft, were completed using conventional down-the-hole 
hammer bits with conventional cross over assembly.  Holes exceeding 1,000 ft feet were completed 
using standard tricone bits. 
All RC holes exceeding a depth of 600 ft had down-hole surveys using a multi-reading gyroscopic 
vertical deviation tool.  Measured horizontal deflection at the bottom of holes with total depth 
between 600 ft and 1,000 ft ranged from 9 ft to 24.5 ft on azimuths varying from nearly due north to 
east-southeast.  Within ore-grade intersections, deflection varied from 7 ft to 21.5 ft along similar 
azimuths.  The measured deflections are considered negligible.  Measured horizontal deflections in 
deeper holes (>1,000 ft) ranged up to 67 ft, but averaged about 22 ft and is not considered serious.  
Surveys for holes drilled in 2004 were conducted by Wellbore Navigation, Inc of Elko, NV.  Surveys 
of holes drilled in 2005 and later were done by International Directional Services of Elko, NV.  Prior 
drilling experience indicated that holes less than 600 ft deep had negligible deflection.  Drill collars 
were surveyed and tied to the UTM and local grid systems by registered surveyors from Summit 
Engineering of Elko, NV. 
 
Character samples for each 5-ft assay interval were collected from the reject port of the sample

stored on site.  Geologic observations were recorded on standardized logging forms and included 
percentage oxidation, primary and secondary lithology, alteration and mineralization.  
 
The drilling contractor for the 2004-2010 drilling programs was Lang Exploratory Drilling, a division 
of Boart Longyear, Inc. of Elko, NV.  Lang is a well-regarded and highly experienced RC drilling 
company.

10.4.6 Coral Flooded RC Drilling (2007) 

 
The 2007 deep drilling was conducted using an LM 120 drill capable of reaching depths exceeding 
3,000 ft and which employs a flooded RC method.  This method uses conventional RC drilling 
starting at the surface with a 9 inch hammer bit and conventional crossover assembly.  The 
conventional RC drilling is advanced as deep as possible, typically 600-900 ft deep, in order to reach 
at least 250 ft below the local water table.  Once the hammer bit has reached its maximum depth, the 
hole is converted to flooded RC.  This method employs a 9 inch tricone bit followed by a series of 
stabilizers, several hundred feet of drill collars (for added weight), a series of crossover assemblies 
and finally conventional 20-ft-long dual-walled RC drill rods.  Drilling fluid is introduced into the 
hole through the casing between the drill rods and the wall of the hole.  A portion of the fluid reaches

the drill bit and working face while the rest is captured by the crossover assembly.  At the same time 
high pressure compressed air is introduced through the outer annulus of the dual-walled RC rods and 
mixes with the drilling fluid that enters through the crossovers, creating a highly buoyant air-charged 
fluid that rises at high velocity (>1,000 ft/sec) through the center tube of the RC rods to the surface.  
This rapid upward movement creates a significant vacuum at the bit face where the sample, entrained 
in the fluid, also passes rapidly upward through holes in the bit face, stabilizers and collars, mixes 
with the buoyant air-charged fluid and ascends at high velocity to the surface.  The sample and fluid 
are discharged into a cyclone where, once their velocity is slowed, they empty on to a series of 
stacked vibrating screens.  At this point the drilling fluid and some very fine sample are separated 
from the bulk sample and sent to a de-sander where the fine rock material is available for sampling 
and discharged into the mud sump.  The drilling fluid is returned to a holding tank to be reused. The 
entire sample interval is discharged into a Gilson-type sample splitter directly from the 
vibrating screens.   
  
Down-the-hole directional surveys were conducted on both holes by International Directional 
Services, Inc. of Elko, Nevada, using a gyroscopic directional survey tool that measures horizontal 
and vertical deflection in the hole.  TV07-1 had a total deviation of 500 ft in a northeasterly direction 
at the bottom of the hole.  TV07-2 had a total deviation of 118 ft in a due east direction at 3,200 ft.   
 
The drilling contractor for this program was Lang Exploratory Drilling, a division of Boart Longyear, 
Inc., of Elko, Nevada.  Lang is a highly experienced drilling company specializing in reverse 
circulation and is an industry leader in deep exploration.  Lang's performance on this project was 
excellent and met current industry standard.  
 

10.4.7 Coral Diamond Drilling (2010) 
 
In 2010, Coral completed 14 vertical, HQ diameter diamond core holes, CC10-1 through CC10-15 
(CC10-11 abandon) totaling 6,450 ft.  The drilling contractor for this program was Major Drilling 
Inc. of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Major Drilling is a highly experienced core drilling company.  Their 
performance on this project was plagued by inexperienced drilling crews, equipment breakdowns, 
crew absenteeism and generally poor core recovery in critical mineralized areas.  
 
All 14 core holes were drilled using a truck mounted LF-70 diamond core drill using conventional 
HQ-diameter (2.5 inch core) diamond impregnated bits, 5-ft core barrels and standard wire-line 
method.  Overburden depth ranged from none to 30 ft.  A minimum of 10 ft of casing was installed in 
all holes.  Hole CC10-1, which was collared on the gravel-covered South Porphyry Zone, employed 
35 ft of casing.  Hole depths varied from 400 ft to 500 ft.  Drill collars were surveyed by Summit 
Engineering of Elko, Nevada.  No down-the-hole surveys were conducted.  
 
Core was retrieved from the drill site in standard waxed cardboard core boxes (10 ft/box).  All core 
boxes were marked with hole number, footage interval and box number.  Wooden blocks indicating 
footage were placed at the end of each core run by the driller.  Prior to logging, the core was 
measured and marked into even 5-ft or less sample intervals.  The percentage of core recovery was 
determined and RQD data collected and recorded on a standardized form.  The core was cleaned of 
drilling mud and grease, and photographed.  Detailed geologic observations of the core were made 
using a standardized logging form.  Key observations included percent oxidation, primary and 
secondary lithology, alteration, mineralization and structure.  In addition, 15 secondary fields were 
also visually estimated.  Small lengths (3-6 inches) of representative core were collected at regular 
intervals over the entire length of the holes for specific gravity measurements and as a visual record.  
A total of 279 samples were collected and measured for specific gravity.  The "skeleton" core is

stored on site in standard cardboard core boxes identified with hole number and footage interval.  
Individual core is identified by hole number and footage in permanent marker. 
 
Because the core was to be used for metallurgical testing, it was not split or sawed prior to bagging in 
pre-numbered heavy 17 in x 28 in canvas bags. 
 
Core recovery for individual 5-ft assay intervals varied 0 to 100 percent.  However, core recovery in 
the top 10 ft to 30 ft of most holes and within certain mineralized intervals was considered to be poor 
(<50 percent recovery).  Overall core recovery for entire holes ranged from 87.4 to 97.5 percent and 
averaged 93.4 percent.

SECTION 11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
  
11.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The authors have no first-hand knowledge of the sampling procedures employed during the 
exploratory drilling programs prior to Coral (pre-1986) (85 holes), as well as the procedures used by 
Coral (1986-1989) (403 holes).  In addition, no written documentation or description of the sampling 
procedures employed by these companies was found in the Coral files.  It cannot be assumed that the 
sampling procedures used by these companies would meet industry standard of today. However, the 
authors also have no reason to believe the procedures used in the past were, in any way, suspect or 
unprofessional. For the purpose of the inferred resource estimate, all holes were utilized due to 
confidence factors. These holes are distributed throughout the Gold Pan, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill 
and in particular the Triplet Gulch areas. Further validation and verification is required in order to 
utilize these holes in an upgraded resource however the grade distribution with and without these 
holes is within acceptable limits. Therefore, the inclusion or exclusion of these holes will not 
adversely affect the resource with the exception of Triplet Gulch were a much more rigorous 
validation program is required. 
 
Additionally, the authors have no first-hand knowledge of the sampling procedures employed by 
Cortez (1999).  No written documentation or verbal description of the sampling procedures used at 
the Robertson Property was provided by Cortez.  However, it can be assumed that Cortez employed 
the same or similar sampling protocol on this project as is used at their nearby mining operation and 
that it meets current industry standard. 
 
The sampling procedures employed by Amax and Coral Gold during their RC and the core drilling 
programs are well documented and, as Senior Project Geologist for Amax and as the supervising 
Qualified Person for Coral at the Robertson Property, the author has first-hand knowledge of their 
sampling methodologies.  The sampling protocols used by Amax and Coral Gold on this project meet 
current industry standards. 
 
11.2 AMAX RC AND CORE DRILLING 
 
A summary of sampling methods employed by Amax during RC and core drilling operations at 
Robertson were previously reported in the NI 43-101 compliant technical report Mineral Resource 
Estimate for the Robertson Property, Lander County, Nevada, USA (Stokes et al., 2008) available on 
SEDAR.  
 
11.3 CORAL GOLD RESOURCES RC SAMPLING (2004-2006) 
 
A summary of sampling methods employed by Coral during their 2004-2006 RC drilling operations 
at Robertson were previously reported in the NI 43-101 compliant technical report Mineral Resource 
Estimate for the Robertson Property, Lander County, Nevada, USA (Stokes et al., 2008) available on 
SEDAR.  
 
11.4  CORAL GOLD RESOURCES RC SAMPLING (2007) 
 
The 2007 deep drilling was conducted using an LM 120 drill which employs a flooded RC method.  
This method uses conventional RC drilling starting at the surface until the hole is advanced as deep 
as possible, typically 600-900 ft deep.  Once the hammer bit has reached its maximum depth, the hole 
is converted to flooded RC.

Since the two deep holes were drilled from the surface using conventional RC methods, samples 
were initially collected using an air-cyclone collection system.  From the cyclone, samples were 
discharged into a radial rotating wet splitter.  The split assay sample is collected in 5 gallon plastic 
buckets.  Samples were decanted of excess water and transferred to pre-numbered 11 x 17 inch 
micro-pore sample bags.  The reject material from the splitter is discharged into the mud sump.  The 
sample collection buckets were cleaned after every sample using high pressure water hose.  The 
splitter was routinely cleaned using a high pressure hose at every 20 ft rod change. 
 
While using flooded RC, samples were collected in a similar air-cyclone collection system that 
discharged on to a series of stacked vibrating screens.  Samples are discharged directly from the 
vibrating screens into a Gilson-type sample splitter.  The split assay sample was collected in a 2.5 
gallon pan.  The split assay sample is transferred to a pre-numbered 11 x 17 inch micro-pore sample 
bag.  The reject material from the splitter is discharged into the mud sump.  The vibrating screens, 
sample splitter and sample collection pans are cleaned using a high pressure water hose after every 
sample.   
 
Samples for assay were collected on even 10 ft intervals starting at the surface.  During sampling, 
pre-numbered "rig duplicate" samples were routinely collected from the reject outlet of the splitter.  
These samples were used to assess the effectiveness of the sampling procedure and the natural 
distribution of gold in the rock by comparing them with the "original" sample. 
 
Once the samples were dry, all drill samples were weighed at the lab.  The average dry weight for a 
10-ft sample was about 6.7 kg.  Together with observations at the drill site, monitoring sample 
weights provided data from which sample recovery could be estimated. 
 
11.5 CORAL GOLD RESOURCES RC SAMPLING (2008, 2010) 
 
The 2008 and 2010 drilling programs were conducted using a truck-mounted Drill Tech D40K drill 
with 900 cfm/350 psi compressor.  These drills employ air-cyclone sample collection equipment that 
meets current industry standard.  Standard care was taken to minimize contamination during all 
phases of the sampling procedure.  In addition, a geologist was at the drill site during the drilling and 
sampling procedure. 
 
All drill holes were drilled wet beginning at the surface.  Under these conditions, a small amount of 
water is injected during the drilling process until the water table is encountered, which varied from 
220-ft- to 475-ft-deep.  Samples for gold assay were collected on even 5-ft intervals starting at the 
surface.  During wet drilling conditions, drill cuttings were spit on site using a radial rotating wet 
splitter.  The purpose of splitting the sample was to obtain a consistent and representative sample 
weighing 3-4 kg.  When drilling wet, samples were collected using a series of 5 gallon plastic 
buckets.  The samples were decanted of excess water and transferred to pre-numbered heavy 10 inch 
x 17 inch sample bags.  The sample collection buckets were cleaned using a high pressure water hose 
after each sample.  The wet splitter was routinely cleaned with a high pressure water hose at every 20 
ft rod change.  In zones of high water flow, the 5-gallon sample buckets filled and overflowed with 
water and fine-grained material.  These "fines" were not captured.  Previous sampling studies of this 
material indicated that the gold content was negligible in the overflow material.  
 
Character samples for each 5-ft assay interval were collected from the reject port of the sample 
splitter and logged at the drill site.  The drill cuttings are stored in 20-compartment plastic chip trays 
that are stored on site.  Geologic observations were recorded on standardized logging forms and 
included percentage oxidation, primary and secondary lithology, alteration and mineralization.

During RC drilling, "rig duplicate" samples were routinely collected from the reject outlet of the 
splitter.  These samples were used to assess the effectiveness of the sampling procedure and were 
compared with the "original" sample.  Additionally, specially collected coarse "blank" (<0.005 ppm) 
and very low-level material (<0.025 ppm Au) were inserted into the sample sequence at pre-
determined intervals to monitor possible lab contamination such as smearing of coarse gold on 
sample preparation equipment.   
 
Once the samples were dry, all RC samples were weighed at the lab.  The average dry weight for a 5-
ft sample was about 4.0 kg.  Together with observations at the drill site, monitoring sample weights 
provided data from which sample recovery could be estimated. 
 
11.6 CORAL GOLD RESOURCES DRILL CORE SAMPLING (2010) 
 
Drill core was delivered to Coral's logging facility directly from the drill site at the end of each shift 
in core boxes containing approximately 10 ft of 2.5 inch diameter core. Each box is marked with hole 
number, interval footage and box number.  Wooden core blocks are inserted at the end of each drill 
run with the measured depth marked on the block.  At the logging facility the core is measured and 
core recovery was determined for each 5-ft assay interval.  Individual assay intervals were marked by 
wooden blocks.  Core recovery averaged 93.4 percent.  After cleaning, photographing and detailed 
logging, the entire unsplit, 5-ft assay interval was placed in a pre-labeled heavy canvas bag.  Each 
bag was labeled with hole number and a unique sample number.  The samples remained in the 
logging facility until they were picked by the assay lab. 
 
A total of 279 representative core samples (3-6 inches long) were collected and measured for specific 
gravity, which are stored on site.  
 
Specially collected coarse barren material were inserted into the sample sequence at pre-determined 
intervals to monitor possible lab contamination and smearing of coarse gold on sample prep 
equipment. 
 
11.7  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.7.1 Introduction 
 
The authors have no first-hand knowledge of the sample preparation protocols, analytical 
methodology and sample security that were employed at the Robertson Property by companies prior 
to Coral (pre-1986), as well as the procedures used by Coral (1986-1989).  No written documentation 
or description of these procedures was found in the Coral files.  Further, it cannot be assumed that the 
sample preparation, analytical procedures and sample security measures used by the early companies 
would meet industry standard of today. However, the authors also have no reason to believe the 
procedures used in the past were, in any way, suspect or unprofessional. For the purpose of the 
inferred resource estimate, all holes were utilized due to confidence factors. These holes are 
distributed throughout the Gold Pan, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and in particular the Triplet Gulch 
areas. Further validation and verification is required in order to utilize these holes in an upgraded 
resource however the grade distribution with and without these holes is within acceptable limits. 
Therefore, the inclusion or exclusion of these holes will not adversely affect the resource with the 
exception of Triplet Gulch were a much more rigorous validation program is required. 
 
The authors have no first-hand knowledge of the sample preparation protocols, analytical procedures 
or sample security measures employed by Cortez (1999) during their evaluation of the Robertson

Property.  It should also be noted that no written or oral description of these procedures was provided 
by Cortez.  However, it may be assumed that the sample preparation, analytical procedures and 
sample security used by Cortez on this project would meet industry standard of today.  
 
The sample preparation protocol, analytical procedures and sample security measures employed by 
Amax (1990-1996) and Coral Gold (2004-2010) during their RC and core drilling programs are well 
documented and, as Senior Project Geologist for Amax and as the supervising Qualified Person for 
Coral Gold at the Robertson Property, the author also has first-hand knowledge of these 
methodologies.  The sample preparation protocols, analytical procedures and sample security 
measures used by Amax and Coral Gold on this project meet current industry standard practices. 
 

11.7.2 Amax Drill Sample Security Measures 
 
All RC and core samples remained on the project site until they were picked up by the analytical lab.  
No sample preparation occurred on-site.  Access to the samples prior to pick up by the lab, by non-
Amax or Coral personnel was controlled during both daylight and night-time hours.   While it is the 
opinion of the author that no tampering with samples occurred during this period and, within the 
context of the entire drilling program, large-scale tampering would have been impossible to achieve.  
 
 

11.7.3 Analyses of Amax Drill Samples 
 
During the period 1990-91 and 1993-94, Amax employed Monitor Geochemical Laboratory, with 
sample prep and analytical facilities in Elko, NV, as its principal analytical lab for the Robertson 
Property.   In 1992, the principal laboratory was Bondar-Clegg, with sample prep facilities in Reno, 
NV and analytical laboratories in Vancouver, B.C.  In 1993-94, during the Porphyry Zone evaluation, 
Chemex Labs, Inc. was chosen as the secondary (umpire) lab and used primarily to verify sample 
prep and check assaying. 
 
The Amax sample preparation protocol was used at the Monitor, Bondar-Clegg and Chemex sample 
prep facilities and is summarized below: 
 
 Entire drill sample was dried in the sample bag and weighed; 
 Entire 25-35 pound (11-16 kilograms) sample jaw-crushed to 95% -10 mesh; 
 Crushed material reduced to 6 kilograms (13 pounds) with Jones-type splitter; 
 Reject material saved and stored at lab; 
 Entire 6 kilogram sub sample disk-pulverized to 95% -80 mesh; 
 Pulverized material reduced to 350 gram with Jones-type splitter 
 350 gram sub sample passed through rotary mill to 95% -200 mesh; 
 nominal 350 gram pulp sample sent for analysis; 
 Jaw crusher, rotary mill and pulverizer were cleaned by passing barren gravel and sand between 
samples; Jones splitter cleaned by compressed air. 
 
The gold assay procedure used at both Monitor and Bondar-Clegg facilities is summarized below: 
 
 Re-homogenization of the 350 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton (nominal 29.1 grams) weighed from 350 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton fire assay followed by bead digestion in aqua regia and AA determination; 
 All values exceeding 10 ppm gold are re-assayed using one-assay ton with gravimetric finish.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 11-5 January, 2012  

11.7.4 Metallic Screen Analyses 
 
During the Porphyry Zone evaluation, concern over the presence of "coarse" gold prompted Amax to 
initiate "screen fire" analysis, considered the most accurate assay method for assessing coarse gold.  
The evaluation consisted of 132 screen fire assays (about 1 percent of all sample in the Porphyry 
Zone).  The screen fire assay procedure employed at Monitor is summarized below: 
 
 Split a 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) sub sample from the –10 mesh reject material; 
 1 kilogram sub sample pulverized in ring and puck mill to nominal –150 mesh; 
 Pulverized material weighed (weight recorded); 
 Entire sample wet sieved through 150 mesh screen; 
 Entire +150 mesh (oversize) collected, dried, weighed and fire assayed; 
 Entire –150 mesh (undersize) collected, dried and a 2-assay ton split (58.3 grams) fire assayed; 
 Assay results of the two size fractions are combined by weighted averaging to determine the 
reported assay. 
 

11.7.5 Cyanide-Soluble Gold and Copper Analyses 
 
During evaluation of the Porphyry Zone resource, cyanide soluble gold and copper analyses were 
routinely performed on all samples with FA/AA gold values > 0.01 ozAu/t (over 2,100 samples).  
The cyanide soluble analytical procedure consisted of leaching 10 grams of –200 mesh pulp material 
in a flask for 24 hours in a 100 ml solution of one gram/liter NaCN solution.  The leach solution was 
analyzed for gold and copper by atomic absorption spectrometry. 
 

11.7.6 Use of Standards and Blanks 
 
In order to assess the Monitor and Bondar-Clegg sample prep and analytical performance, Amax 
developed a QA/QC program consisting of submitting "blind" coarse blank material (3.5 %), rig 
duplicates (4 %) and Amax prepared standard pulps (9.3 %) into the sample stream.  All reference 
materials were pre-numbered in sequence with the drill samples and submitted blind to the labs 
without unique identifiers.  Standard pulps were chosen to match as closely as possible the oxidation 
state, expected grade and sulfide content of the accompanying drill samples.   
  
Over 900 samples, representing coarse reject material and pulps, were randomly selected for sample 
preparation and gold assay determinations by Chemex.  These materials were shipped by the primary 
lab.  Sample prep and analytical procedure used by the secondary lab were same as those used by the 
primary lab facilities. 
 

11.7.7 Coral Gold RC Drill Sample Security Measures (2004-2010) 
 
All RC samples remained on the project site until they were picked up by the analytical lab.  No 
sample preparation occurred on-site.  No Coral personnel were involved in any aspect of sample 
preparation.  Access to the samples prior to pick up by the lab by non- Coral personnel was 
controlled during daylight hours only.   While it is the opinion of the author that no tampering with 
samples occurred during this period and, within the context of the entire drilling program, large-scale 
tampering would have been impossible to achieve.

11.7.8 Analyses of Coral Gold RC Drill Samples (2004-2010) 
 
During the period 2004-2010, Coral employed ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in Elko, NV 
and analytical laboratories in Reno, NV to perform sample preparation and gold assays.  ALS 
Chemex laboratories in North America are registered to ISO 9001:2000 by QMI Quality Registrars.  
  
The sample preparation protocol used at the ALS Chemex sample prep facilities and is summarized 
below: 
 

 Entire drill sample was dried in the sample bag and weighed; 
 Entire 7-15 pound (3.2-6.7 kilograms) sample jaw-crushed to 70% -2mm; 
 Crushed material reduced to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) with riffle-type splitter; 
 Reject material saved and stored at lab; 
 Entire 1 kilogram sub sample disk-pulverized to 85% -200 mesh; 
 Pulverized material reduced to 250 gram with riffle-type splitter; 
 nominal 250 gram pulp sample sent for analysis; 
 Jaw crusher and pulverizer were cleaned after every sample by passing barren gravel and 

sand. 
 
The gold assay procedure used at ALS Chemex facilities is summarized below: 
 

 Re-homogenization of the 250 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton (nominal 29.1 grams) weighed from 250 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton fire assay followed by bead digestion in aqua regia and AA determination; 
 All values exceeding 10 ppm gold are re-assayed using one-assay ton with gravimetric finish. 

 
11.7.8.1 Use of Standards and Blanks 
 
In order to assess the ALS Chemex sample prep and analytical performance, Coral developed a 
QA/QC program consisting of submitting "blind" coarse blank and low-level gold material (4.3 %), 
rig duplicates (2.1 %) and standard reference pulps (1.2 %) into the sample stream.  All reference 
materials were pre-numbered in sequence with the drill samples and submitted blind to the labs 
without unique identifiers.  Standard pulps were chosen to match as closely as possible the oxidation 
state, expected grade and sulfide content of the accompanying drill samples.   
  
In 2004-2005, over 146 samples, representing coarse reject material and pulps, were selected for 
additional sample preparation and gold assay determinations by ALS Chemex.  In 2006, a total of 
604 samples, representing coarse reject material, were selected for additional sample preparation, 
compositing and gold assay determinations by McClelland Labs and Rocky Mountain Geochemical, 
both located in Sparks, NV, USA.  
 
The sample preparation protocol, analytical procedures and sample security measures employed by 
Coral Gold during its 2004-2010 RC drilling programs meet current industry standard practices.  As 
the supervising Qualified Person for Coral Gold at the Robertson Property, the author also has first-
hand knowledge of these methodologies.  
 

11.7.9 Coral Gold Core Drilling Sample Security Measures (2010) 
 
At the end of each drill shift, core samples were delivered to a secure Coral storage facility in 
Crescent Valley, Nevada.   No sample preparation occurred on-site.  No Coral personnel were

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 11-7 January, 2012  

involved in any aspect of sample preparation.  Access to the samples prior to delivery to Coral 
personnel was controlled at all time during drilling operations (24 hrs).   While it is the opinion of the 
author that no tampering with samples occurred during this period and, within the context of the 
entire drilling program, large-scale tampering would have been impossible to achieve.  
 

11.7.10 Analyses of Coral Gold Core Drilling Samples (2010) 
 
During the 2010 drilling program, Coral employed ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in Elko, 
NV and analytical laboratories in Reno, NV to perform sample preparation and gold assays.  ALS 
Chemex laboratories in North America are registered to ISO 9001:2000 by QMI Quality Registrars.  
 
Because one of the objectives of the 2010 core drilling was to supply samples for metallurgical 
testing, a special sample preparation was designed to provide nominal 3/4 inch crushed material for 
column leach tests.  The modified sample protocol used during the core drilling is summarized 
below: 
 

 Entire drill sample was dried in the sample bag and weighed; 
 Entire 24.2 pound (average sample weight 11.0 kilograms) sample jaw-crushed to -3/4 inch; 
 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) split from -3/4 inch crushed sample with rotary-type splitter; 
 Entire -3/4 inch coarse reject material saved and stored at the lab; 
 Entire 1 kilogram sub sample disk-pulverized to 85% -200 mesh; 
 Pulverized material reduced to 250 gram with riffle-type splitter; 
 nominal 250 gram pulp sample sent for analysis; 
 Jaw crusher and pulverizer were cleaned after every sample by passing barren gravel and 

sand. 
  

The gold assay procedure used at ALS Chemex facilities is summarized below: 
 

 Re-homogenization of the 250 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton (nominal 29.1 grams) split and weighed from 250 gram pulp; 
 One-assay ton fire assay followed by bead digestion in aqua regia and AA determination; 
 All values exceeding 10 ppm gold are re-assayed using one-assay ton with gravimetric finish. 

 
11.7.10.1 Use of Standards and Blanks 
 
In order to assess the ALS Chemex sample prep and analytical performance, Coral developed a 
QA/QC program consisting of submitting "blind" coarse blank and low-level gold material (5.3 %) 
and standard reference pulps (3.7 %) into the sample stream.  All reference materials were pre-
numbered in sequence with the drill samples and submitted blind to the labs without unique 
identifiers.  Standard pulps were chosen to match as closely as possible the oxidation state, expected 
grade and sulfide content of the accompanying drill samples.

SECTION 12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Verifying data collected by companies prior to Coral Resources (1986-1989) is nearly impossible due 
to a lack of documentation.  However, it is possible to make a judgment regarding the E & B 
Exploration and portions of the Coral Resources databases.  While details regarding drilling, 
sampling, sample prep and assay procedures are unavailable, the fact that both companies employed 
reputable assay labs for their analytical work suggests that the assays data is of good quality.  An 
exception is the assay data of Coral Resources reported during a portion of 1988 and all of 1989, 
when Coral prepared and analyzed their own samples on site.  The Coral assays produced during this 
period lack documentation and have been shown to be unreliable and should be excluded from use in 
resource estimates.       
 
Data verification was undertaken by Amax during evaluation of the Porphyry Zone resource.  MRDI 
(Mineral Resource Development, Inc., of San Mateo, CA) was responsible for verification of Amax's 
methodology used to verify the quality of analytical data used in their evaluation at the Robertson 
Property (1994 Amax feasibility study).  It was the opinion of MRDI that the methodology used is 
appropriate in the context of the evaluation being considered and that the work performed by Amax 
meets or exceeds industry standards. 
 
12.2  DATA VERIFICATION OF AMAX DRILL SAMPLE RESULTS 
 
The Amax primary labs were the Monitor facility in Elko, NV and the Bondar-Clegg facility in 
Vancouver, B. C.  The Chemex Labs of Vancouver, B. C. was chosen as the secondary (umpire) lab 
facility. 
 
The primary labs prep facilities were responsible for preparing course "rig" duplicate samples, coarse 
blank samples and for inserting the Amax supplied standard reference materials into the sample 
stream.  The standard reference material was prepared by Amax as part of an internal, company-wide 
program that supplied reference material for all Amax sampling programs.  The standards are highly 
reliable and were routinely monitored by Amax.  Once the drill samples were reduced to pulp 
samples ready for assay, the Amax standards (pulps) were inserted by the lab in pre-numbered 
sequence with the other pulps and assayed sequentially. 
 
In addition, Amax was supplied with and monitored the analytical results of the primary and 
secondary labs own internal QA/QC controls for sample batches. 
 
Amax routinely (6% of all samples) submitted pulp samples prepared by the primary lab to the 
umpire lab for gold assay.   Less frequently, coarse (-10 mesh) reject material was submitted to the 
umpire lab for preparation and analysis.  The primary lab was responsible for shipping all samples to 
the umpire lab. 
 
A complete summary of the verification of analytical data developed by Amax during their 
evaluation of the Porphyry Zone inferred mineral resource (1994 feasibility study) was previously 
reported in the NI 43-101 compliant technical report Mineral Resource Estimate for the Robertson 
Property, Lander County, Nevada, USA (Stokes et al., 2008) available on SEDAR.

12.3 CORAL GOLD DATA VERIFICATION OF RC DRILL SAMPLE RESULTS 
(2004-2006) 

 
The Coral primary lab was ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in Elko, NV and assay facilities 
in Reno, NV.  McClelland Metallurgical Labs, Sparks, NV was used as the secondary (check) lab. 
  
The ALS Chemex prep facilities was responsible for preparing coarse "rig" duplicate samples, coarse 
blank samples, coarse low-level gold samples, and for inserting the Coral supplied standard reference 
materials into the sample stream.  The commercially available certified reference materials were 
supplied by CANMET and MEG.  The standards are highly reliable and were routinely monitored by 
Coral.  Once the drill samples were reduced to pulp samples ready for assay, the certified reference 
pulps were inserted by the lab in pre-numbered sequence with the other pulps and assayed 
sequentially. 
 
In addition, Coral was supplied with and monitored the analytical results of ALS Chemex own 
internal QA/QC controls for sample batches.  
 
The following statistical analysis were calculated by substituting the assay value <0.005 ppm Au 
(below analytical detection) with the value 0.004 ppm Au.  
 

12.3.1 Summary of Verification-Drill Sample Results 
 
To assess the ability of the primary and umpire labs to provide consistently accurate analytical 
results, their performance was monitored using standards, blanks and rig duplicate samples.  A total 
of 11,918 drill samples were submitted to ALS Chemex for initial gold determination from 2004-
2006.  In addition Coral submitted 1,727 control (14.5%) samples to monitor lab performance. 
 

12.3.2 Certified Reference Pulps 
 
Analytical results for the 178 (1.5 % of all samples) certified reference pulps submitted to ALS 
Chemex indicate that the average for all "certified" values was 2.535 ppm Au, versus the primary 
labs average value of 2.530 ppm Au.  This is a relative difference of 0.005 ppm Au, or <1 percent 
lower than the mean of the certified values.  A correlation coefficient of 0.973 was calculated for the 
pair.  These results indicate that relative bias between the two data sets is absent.  However, it should 
be noted that assay results of certified blank samples by ALS Chemex returned gold values ranging 
from <0.005 ppm Au up to 0.085 ppm Au.  Of the 19 certified blank samples submitted, six samples 
returned values >0.005 ppm Au.  This suggests a contamination or precision problem at the assay lab  
 

12.3.3 Check Assays 
 
Check assays on the 2004-2005 pulps prepared by the primary lab were performed on 207 (1.7% of 
all samples) samples.  The average value from the initial assay was 1.544 ppm Au versus the average 
value from the check assay of 1.544, essentially no difference between the mean of both values.  
However on a sample by sample comparison, results between the two data sets (average values) 
varied from 0.027 ppm to 0.116 ppm.  A correlation coefficient of 0.998 was calculated for the data 
pairs.  These results indicate very good analytical reproducibility by the primary lab. 
 
Check assays on the 2006 assays were performed on 604 (5.1% of all samples) coarse reject samples 
which were made into 25 composite samples for metallurgical testing.  The average value from the 
initial assay of the 604 samples was 1.94 ppm Au versus the average value from check assays which 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 12-3 January, 2012  

was 1.65 ppm Au, a difference of 0.29 ppm (14.9%).  A correlation coefficient of 0.9802 was 
calculated for the data pairs.  A comparison of the initial (ALS) assay versus the check assay (RMG) 
results indicates that on average the initial assays are higher than the corresponding check samples.  
On a sample by sample comparison, results between the two data sets (average values) varied from 
0.10 ppm to 0.84 ppm.  These results suggest that either the initial determinations are biased high or 
the check sample assays are biased low.  In addition problems with analytical reproducibility 
(precision) or coarse gold may also be present.  To assess these issues, assay results from both labs 
were compared with the head grades calculated from 2,000 g cyanide leach tests.  The average initial 
assay value for the individual 25 composite samples were compared with the average grade for the 
calculated head grade and plotted on a scatter diagram shown in Figure 12-1.  With the exception of a 
single sample pair, the data are in excellent agreement and show no systematic bias.  The average for 
the initial assays is 1.94 ppm versus 1.92 ppm for the calculated head grade, a difference of 0.02 ppm 
or 1.03% of the average initial assay value.  However, a comparison of the average check assay value 
for each of the 25 composite samples with the calculated head grade, shown in Figure 12-2, indicates 
a systematic low bias for the check assays versus the calculated head grade.  The average value for 
all check assays is 1.65 ppm versus 1.92 ppm for the calculated heads, a difference of 0.27 ppm or 
16.4% of the average check assay value.  These comparisons support the conclusion that no apparent 
bias exists between the initial assays performed by the primary lab and the calculated head grades.  
They also indicate that the check assays performed by a secondary lab are on average lower than 
either the initial assay or the calculated head grade.  A correlation coefficient of 0.9658 was 
calculated for the initial assays versus the calculated head grade and 0.9389 was calculated for the 
check assays versus the calculated head grade.  These correlations also suggest bias between the 
check assays and the calculated head grades. 
 

12.3.4 Rig Duplicate Samples 
 
The "rig" duplicate samples taken from reject material at the drill rig, and submitted blind to the lab, 
were prepared and analyzed along with the routine drill samples.  The primary lab prepared and 
analyzed 245 'rig' duplicate samples (2.1% of all samples).  The average value for the primary assay 
sample was 0.528 ppm Au and the average value for the "rig" duplicate assay was 0.544 ppm Au, a 
relative difference of 0.016 ppm Au, or 3.0 percent higher than the mean value for the primary 
sample.  However, in several instances significant differences between 12 assay pairs were noted.  
The relative difference between these assay pairs ranged from 0.752 ppm to 10.1 ppm.  Despite the 
high variance between these samples, a correlation coefficient of 0.932 was calculated for the data 
pairs. These results indicate an overall very good reproducibility of the sample preparation and 
analytical procedures by the primary lab.  While the variance between the four sample pairs is 
relatively large, it probably reflects the erratic nature of the gold distribution in the sample rather than 
poor sample preparation or analytical precision.    
 

12.3.5 Coarse Blank and Low-Level Gold Samples 
 
A total of 493 samples (4.1% of all samples) containing coarse blank material (<0.005 ppm Au) or 
coarse material containing trace levels of gold (< 0.005 to 0.025 ppm Au), were systematically 
introduced into the sample stream to assess the potential for introducing contamination during sample 
preparation.  The average assay value for the 250 blank samples (sample CO-1 + CO-2) was 0.006 
ppm Au and varied from <0.005 to 0.282 ppm Au.  The average value for the 225 trace-level gold 
material (sample CV-1) was 0.01 ppm Au and ranged from <0.005 ppm to 0.646 ppm Au.  An 
examination of the expected values for the blank and low-level samples as compared with assay 
results of the immediately preceding 3 or 4 samples indicates that no discernible contamination 
occurred during sample preparation.  The 19 detectable gold values (>0.005 ppm) from the coarse 
blank samples might indicate low level contamination or a lack of precision at low level 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 12-4 January, 2012  

determinations.  A more likely explanation is that the control blank samples occasionally contain 
low-level detectable gold.  However, if two samples are removed (0.275 ppm Au and 0.282 ppm Au), 
the average grade for the blank control samples is <0.005 ppm Au.  The low-level sample that 
returned 0.646 ppm Au, as well as the three samples above and below this sample, were re-assayed.  
Results indicate that the analyses were correct, but that the control sample was mixed up with the 
preceding sample on the assay report.  This error was corrected on the certificate of assay and in the 
Coral database.   
 
12.4 CORAL GOLD DATA VERIFICATION OF DEEP RC DRILL SAMPLE 

RESULTS (2007) 
 
The Coral primary lab for the 2007 RC drilling was ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in Elko, 
NV and assay facilities in Reno, NV.   
 
The ALS Chemex prep facilities was responsible for preparing coarse "rig" duplicate samples, coarse 
blank samples, coarse low-level gold samples, and for inserting the Coral supplied standard reference 
materials into the sample stream.  The commercially available certified reference materials were 
supplied by MEG.  The standards are highly reliable and were routinely monitored by Coral.  Once 
the drill samples were reduced to pulp samples ready for assay, the certified reference pulps were 
inserted by the lab in pre-numbered sequence with the other pulps and assayed sequentially. 
 
In addition, Coral was supplied with and monitored the analytical results of ALS Chemex own 
internal QA/QC controls for sample batches. 
 

12.4.1 Summary of Verification-Drill Sample Results 
 
To assess the ability of the primary lab to provide consistently accurate analytical results, their 
performance was monitored using certified reference pulps and rig duplicate samples.  A total of 644 
drill samples were submitted to ALS Chemex for initial gold determination from the 2007 drilling 
program.  In addition Coral submitted 26 control (4.0%) samples to monitor lab performance. 
 

12.4.2 Certified Reference Pulps 
 
Analytical results for the 20 (3.1% of all samples) certified reference pulps submitted to ALS 
Chemex indicate that the average for all "certified" values was 1.047 ppm Au, versus the primary 
labs average value of 1.043 ppm Au.  This is a relative difference of 0.004 ppm Au, or <1 percent 
lower than the mean of the certified values.  A correlation coefficient of 0.997 was calculated for the 
pair.  These results indicate that relative bias between the two data sets is absent. 
 

12.4.3 Rig Duplicate Samples 
 
The "rig" duplicate samples taken from reject material at the drill rig, and submitted blind to the lab, 
were prepared and analyzed along with the routine drill samples.  The primary lab prepared and 
analyzed 13 'rig' duplicate samples (2.0% of all samples).  The average value for the primary assay 
sample was 0.111 ppm Au and the average value for the "rig" duplicate assay was 0.087 ppm Au, a 
relative difference of 0.024 ppm Au, or 21.6 percent lower than the mean value for the primary 
sample.  However, in several instances a significant difference between 3 assay pairs was noted.  The 
relative difference between these assay pairs ranged from 0.048 ppm to 0.350 ppm.  Despite the high 
variance between these samples, a correlation coefficient of 0.993 was calculated for the data pairs. 
These results indicate an overall very good reproducibility of the sample preparation and analytical

procedures by the primary lab.  While the variance between the three sample pairs is relatively large, 
it probably reflects the erratic nature of the gold distribution in the sample rather than poor sample 
preparation or analytical precision.   
 
12.5 CORAL GOLD DATA VERIFICATION OF RC DRILL SAMPLE RESULTS 

(2008, 2010) 
 
The Coral primary lab for the 2008-2010 RC drilling was ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in 
Elko, NV and assay facilities in Reno, NV.   
 
The ALS Chemex prep facilities was responsible for preparing coarse "rig" duplicate samples, coarse 
blank samples, coarse low-level gold samples, and for inserting the Coral supplied standard reference 
materials into the sample stream.  The commercially available certified reference materials were 
supplied by MEG.  The standards are highly reliable and were routinely monitored by Coral.  Once 
the drill samples were reduced to pulp samples ready for assay, the certified reference pulps were 
inserted by the lab in pre-numbered sequence with the other pulps and assayed sequentially. 
 
In addition, Coral was supplied with and monitored the analytical results of ALS Chemex own 
internal QA/QC controls for sample batches. 
 

12.5.1 Summary of Verification-Drill Sample Results 
 
To assess the ability of the primary lab to provide consistently accurate analytical results, their 
performance was monitored using certified reference pulps and rig duplicate samples.  A total of 
6,160 drill samples were submitted to ALS Chemex for initial gold determination from the 2008 and 
2010 drilling programs.  In addition Coral submitted 620 control samples (10.1%) to monitor lab 
performance. 
 

12.5.2 Certified Reference Pulps 
 
Analytical results for the 95 (1.5% of all samples) certified reference pulps submitted to ALS 
Chemex in 2008 indicate that the average for all "certified" values was 1.314 ppm Au, versus the 
primary labs average value of 1.262 ppm Au.  This is a relative difference of 0.052 ppm Au, or 4.0 
percent lower than the mean of the certified values.  This large difference is due to a single sample 
pair for which the lab sample was 0.068 ppm Au versus 4.5 ppm Au for the certified value.  A 
correlation coefficient of 0.950 was calculated for the set of pairs.  If this sample pair is removed for 
the data, the average certified value is 1.280 versus 1.2075 for the average lab value, a difference of 
0.005 ppm Au and a correlation of 0.999.   
 
Analytical results for the 40 (<1% of all samples) certified reference pulps submitted to ALS Chemex 
in 2010 indicate that the average for all "certified" values was 1.426 ppm Au, versus the primary labs 
average value of 1.402 ppm Au.  This is a relative difference of 0.024 ppm Au, or 1.6 percent lower 
than the mean of the certified values.  A correlation coefficient of 0.999 was calculated for the set of 
pairs. 
 
These results indicate that relative bias between the two data sets is absent.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 12-6 January, 2012  

12.5.3 Rig Duplicate Samples 
 
In 2008, the primary lab prepared and analyzed 125 'rig' duplicate samples (2.0% of all samples).  
The average value for the primary assay sample was 0.404 ppm Au and the average value for the 
"rig" duplicate assay was 0.319 ppm Au, a relative difference of 0.085 ppm Au, or 21 percent lower 
than the mean value for the primary sample.  However, in one instance a significant difference 
between a single assay pairs was noted.  The relative difference between these assay pairs 4.69 ppm 
Au.  Because of the high variance between these samples, a correlation coefficient of 0.831 was 
calculated for the data pairs. These results indicate an overall very good reproducibility of the sample 
preparation and analytical procedures by the primary lab.  While the variance between the single 
sample pairs is relatively large, it probably reflects the erratic nature of the gold distribution in the 
sample rather than poor sample preparation or analytical precision.    
 
Forty "rig" duplicate samples were analyzed by the primary lab in 2010.  The average value for the 
primary assay sample was 0.265 ppm Au and the average value for the "rig" duplicate assay was 
0.199 ppm Au, a relative difference of 0.071 ppm Au, or 26.8 percent lower than the mean value for 
the primary sample and a correlation coefficient of only 0.454.  These results indicate a large 
variance between samples possibly due to poor sampling at the splitter.  However, much of this large 
variance is mainly due to a single assay pair having a relative difference of 3.63 ppm Au.  With these 
samples removed from the data, the relative difference between the two data sets is 0.028 ppm Au, or 
an 18 percent higher average for the duplicate assays over the initial assay sample and a correlation 
coefficient of 0.918.        
 

12.5.4 Coarse Blank and Low-Level Gold Samples 
 
In 2008-2010, a total of 320 samples (4.1% of all samples) containing coarse blank material (<0.005 
ppm Au) or coarse material containing trace levels of gold (< 0.005 to 0.025 ppm Au), were 
systematically introduced into the sample stream to assess the potential for introducing contamination 
during sample preparation.  The average assay value for the 233 blank samples (sample CO-1) was 
0.006 ppm Au and varied from <0.005 to 0.246 ppm Au.  Of the 233 "blank" control samples, 65 
samples returned gold values between 0.005 ppm and 246 ppm with an average gold value of 0.013 
ppm.  The average value for the 87 trace-level gold material (sample CV-1) was 0.008 ppm Au and 
ranged from <0.005 ppm to 0.056 ppm Au.  An examination of the expected values for the blank and 
low-level samples as compared with assay results of the immediately preceding 3 or 4 samples 
indicates that no discernible contamination occurred during sample preparation.  The 65 detectable 
gold values (>0.005 ppm) from the coarse blank samples might indicate low level contamination or a 
lack of precision at low level determinations.  A more likely explanation is that the control blank 
samples occasionally contain low-level detectable gold.  However, if a single sample is removed 
(0.246 ppm Au), the average grade for the blank control samples is <0.005 ppm Au.  
 
12.6 CORAL GOLD DATA VERIFICATION OF DDH SAMPLE RESULTS (2010) 
 
The Coral primary lab for the 2010 core drilling was ALS Chemex with sample prep facilities in 
Elko, NV and assay facilities in Reno, NV.   
 
The ALS Chemex prep facilities was responsible for preparing coarse blank samples, coarse low-
level gold samples, and for inserting the Coral supplied standard reference materials into the sample 
stream.  The commercially available certified reference materials were supplied by MEG.  The 
standards are highly reliable and were routinely monitored by Coral.  Once the drill samples were

reduced to pulp samples ready for assay, the certified reference pulps were inserted by the lab in pre-
numbered sequence with the other pulps and assayed sequentially. 
 
In addition, Coral was supplied with and monitored the analytical results of ALS Chemex own 
internal QA/QC controls for sample batches. 
 

12.6.1 Summary of Verification-Drill Sample Results 
 
To assess the ability of the primary lab to provide consistently accurate analytical results, their 
performance was monitored using certified reference pulps and coarse blank and low-level control 
samples.  A total of 1,224 core samples were submitted to ALS Chemex for initial gold 
determination from the 2010 core drilling program.  In addition Coral submitted 113 control samples 
(9.2%) to monitor lab performance. 
 

12.6.2 Certified Reference Pulps 
 
Analytical results for the 43 (3.5% of all samples) certified reference pulps submitted to ALS 
Chemex indicate that the average for all "certified" values was 0.982 ppm Au, versus the primary 
labs average value of 0.974 ppm Au.  This is a relative difference of 0.008 ppm Au, or <1 percent of 
the mean of the certified values.  A correlation coefficient of 0.997 was calculated for the set of pairs.   
 

12.6.3 Check Assays 
 
Check assays of the 2010 initial assay were performed using 17 composite samples composed of 281 
coarse reject samples used for metallurgical testing.  The average value from the initial (ALS) assay 
of the 17 composite samples was 0.89 ppm Au versus the average value from check (RMG) assays 
which was 0.86 ppm Au, a difference of 0.03 ppm (3.4%).  A correlation coefficient of 0.7510 was 
calculated for the data pairs.  A comparison of the initial assay versus the check assay results 
indicates that on average the initial assays are higher than the corresponding check samples (Figure 
12-3).  On a sample by sample comparison, results between the two data sets (average values) 
indicate that the initial assay values varied from 0.39 ppm lower to 0.72 ppm higher than the 
corresponding check assay.  These results suggest that either the initial determinations are biased 
high or the check sample assays are biased low.  In addition problems with analytical reproducibility 
(precision) or coarse gold may also be present.  To assess these issues, assay results from both labs 
were compared with the head grades calculated from 1,000 g cyanide leach tests.  The average initial 
assay values for the individual 17 composite samples were compared with the average grade for the 
calculated head grade and plotted on a graph shown in Figure 12-4.  The average for the 17n initial 
assays was 0.89 ppm Au compared to 0.82 ppm Au for the calculated head grade, a difference of 0.07 
ppm (7.9%).  The 17 sample pairs have a correlation coefficient of 0.8314.  A comparison of the 
average check assay value (0.86 ppm Au) for each of the 17 composite samples with the calculated 
head grade based on results from 17 bottle roll cyanide leach tests is shown in Figure 12-5.  The two 
data sets have an average difference of 0.04 ppm (4.6%) and a correlation coefficient of 0.9162, 
indicating relatively good agreement.  Although the check assays are on average higher that the 
calculated head grades, the variance ranges from 0.18 ppm lower to 0.22 ppm higher values for the 
check assays.  These comparisons support the conclusion that assay results from ALS exhibit an 
overall slightly higher bias verses either the check assays or the calculated head grades for the 17 
composite samples.

12.6.4 Coarse Blank and Low-Level Gold Samples 
 
A total of 70 samples (5.7% of all samples) containing coarse blank material (<0.005 ppm Au) or 
coarse material containing trace levels of gold (< 0.005 to 0.040 ppm Au), were systematically 
introduced into the sample stream to assess the potential for introducing contamination during sample 
preparation.  The average assay value for the 36 blank samples (sample CO-1) was 0.005 ppm Au 
and varied from <0.005 to 0.015 ppm Au.  Of the 36 "blank" control samples, 14 samples returned 
gold values between 0.005 ppm and 0.015 ppm with an average gold value of 0.007 ppm.  The 
average value for the 34 trace-level gold material (sample CV-1) was 0.011 ppm Au and ranged from 
<0.005 ppm to 0.040 ppm Au.  An examination of the expected values for the blank and low-level 
samples as compared with assay results of the immediately preceding 3 or 4 samples indicates that no 
discernible contamination occurred during sample preparation.  The 14 detectable gold values 
(>0.005 ppm) from the coarse blank samples might indicate low level contamination or a lack of 
precision at low level determinations.  A more likely explanation is that the control blank samples 
occasionally contain low-level detectable gold.   
 

12.6.5 Comparison of Twin DDH and RC Assay Results 
 
An objective of the 2010 core drilling program was to evaluate the potential for down hole 
contamination and verify assay results from a series of RC holes drilled in 2008.  This was 
accomplished by twinning 11 existing RC holes with HQ-diameter core which produced 960 sample 
pairs (1,920 samples) from the two sets of twinned holes.   To test the effectiveness of RC drilling to 
return representative gold assays, the global average grades from the twinned RC holes were 
compared with the global average grades returned from the corresponding DDH.  The results are 
shown in Table 12.1 and a plot of results is in Figure 12-1.   The global average grade for all twinned 
RC holes is 0.011 ozAu/t compared with a global average grade for all corresponding core holes of 
0.0107 ozAu/t, relative difference of 0.0003 ozAu/t (<1% of both mean values).  Correlation between 
the twinned RC and cores ranged from 0.0271 to 0.7116, indicating mostly poor short range 
correlation between the holes which were spaced between 4 ft and 17 ft apart.   By removing the top 
one percentile from the data, an average global average grade of 0.010 ozAu/t for the RC holes and 
0.0095 ozAu/t for the core holes results, which is a difference of 0.0005 ozAu/t.

twinned RC and DD holes is 0.0027 ozAu/t.  While the thickness of grade zones varies from 5 ft to 
110 ft, the average thickness indicates that the RC grade zones are on average 5 ft thicker.

To evaluate potential for down hole contamination a comparison was made of the depth at which 
individual grade zones start and end in the twinned RC and corresponding core holes.  The elevation 
difference between the top of grade zones in the twinned RC versus the core holes ranges from 0 to 
40 ft with grade zones in the core starting an of average 20 ft higher.  It should be noted that that all 
of the twinned RC holes had 10 ft of casing installed using open-hole rotary methods which results in 
generally poor sample quality.  Also poor core recovery in the upper 20 ft of most the 2010 core 
holes resulted in small or no samples. 
    
12.7 AUTHORS DATA VERIFICATION 
 
As project manager for Amax during the time period 1990 through 1994 and a supervising Qualified 
Person for Coral Gold (2004-2010), the author was primarily responsible for developing, 
implementing and monitoring the QA/QC program employed by Amax and Coral Gold at the 
Robertson Property.  These results verify the adequacy and effectiveness of these QA/QC programs, 
and justify a high level of confidence in the analytical data generated by Amax and Coral Gold used 
in the evaluation of the Robertson project.   
 
It should be noted that although the overall quality of the assay data from the primary lab appears to 
be good, results reported by the check labs are, on average, lower than either the initial assay or 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 12-10 January, 2012  

calculated head grade for the same sample.  This appears to be the result of a systematic low bias 
introduced during the check assay process or during the AA determination.  A comparison of all 
(2004-2010) assays of certified reference pulp with the primary lab assay results indicates a 
consistent low bias in the primary lab assays.  In addition, the primary lab reported a number of 
inconsistent gold determinations for samples at or below the lower limit of detection (0.005 ppm), 
possibly indicating a lack of analytical precision at lower levels of gold detection.   
 
These results indicate that down hole contamination during RC drilling is minimal.  This is 
confirmed by the twin core holes drilled by both Amax (1994 feasibility study) and Coral (2010) that 
there is no evidence of down hole contamination and the differences in global average grades 
between the twinned RC and core holes are well within acceptable limits.   
 
An additional concern is the high variability between the initial lab assay and the "rig" duplicate 
assay.  This is usually due to significant differences between just one or two sample pairs.  However, 
when compared on a sample by sample basis the gold values from both data sets are in "relative" 
agreement.  Elevated gold values in the initial assay data set are usually mirrored by similarly 
elevated values in the duplicate sample set and low values are likewise mirrored.  The variance is 
likely due to natural short range variability in gold distribution and sampling methodology.   
  
While the author has no first-hand knowledge of the QA/QC program employed by Cortez during 
their 1999 evaluation of the Robertson Project, it is the author's opinion that as a mining industry 
leader, they employed a program which was adequate to justify a high level of confidence in the 
analytical data generated.

SECTION 13.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
13.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Robertson Property has six mineralized zones (resources) or deposits and one mined out 
deposit with the following names: 

 
 Porphyry; 
 39A; 
 Distal; 
 Altenburg Hill; 
 Gold Pan; 
 Triplet Gulch; 
 and the mined out Tenabo Gold Quartz Deposit. 

 
Historical metallurgical studies have indicated that the Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and the near 
surface zone of the Gold Pan and 39A are amenable to heap leach treatment.  The Porphyry 
deposit process response is the best understood.  In 2011 a laboratory program was undertaken at 
McClelland Laboratories in Sparks, Nevada to provide further leaching data for samples 
originating from the Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan deposits, and included some low grade samples 
which were labeled as overburden. 
 
An overview of the historical test work performed on the property, followed by a description and 
results summary of the 2011 laboratory program are provided below. 
 

13.1.1 Historical Studies 
 
Of the six resources and deposits identified at Robertson, the Porphyry has had most of the 
previous test work performed on it as it was the subject of a feasibility study by Amax Gold in 
1994. Its metallurgical characteristics are better defined than the other deposits. Its test program 
can be classed as detailed, while the others are more preliminary in nature. No documentation on 
the metallurgical characteristics of the Triplet Gulch Deposit was available and it is not known if 
such work was carried out in the past. 
 
Details of the metallurgical testwork performed on each of the remaining mineralized zones or 
deposits together with the names of the laboratories that undertook the work are provided below 
summarizing work done from the late 1980's to 2007. 
 
13.1.1.1 Gold Quartz Deposit 
 
According to Mr. Bob McCusker, the Tenabo Gold Quartz Deposit has been mined out and is on 
longer relevant to the current evaluation of the Property but the historical metallurgical testwork 
and process information have been included for the record of this report as this deposit is close to 
the Gold Pan Deposit.  
 
In 1981, the Miller-Kappes Company performed 14 cyanide leach tests. Two of the samples were 
from the small open pit (glory hole) and waste dumps in the original Gold Quartz mine. One was 
taken near the iron stained area of the north rim and the other from a low grade zone from the 
west end of the pit. The other twelve were from an existing ore heap and were taken by back-hoe 
trenching.

All samples were crushed to minus 5/8" and a 50lb split was used for testing. Leach solution 
ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 g/L cyanide and pH 9.5 to 10.7 was slowly dripped from a head tank to a 
column containing the crushed ore sample. Pregnant solution draining from the column reported 
to a bottle containing activated carbon to adsorb the leached gold and silver values. The pit 
samples were leached for 101 days and the ore heap samples for 75 days. Lime and cyanide 
consumptions averaged 2.7 and 3lb/ton respectively.  
 
Results of the tests are presented in the table 13.1 below: 
 

Table 13.1: Cyanide Leach Tests  

 Gold Quartz Pit Ore Heap Weighted Average 
Feed Grade (oz Au/t) 0.026 0.050 0.046 
Leach Residue (oz Au/t) 0.004 0.009 0.008 
Recovery to day 15  57.5  
Recovery to day 27 83.6   
Final Gold Recovery 87.9 77.3 78.8 
 
In 1986, an additional column test by Kappes Cassidy and Associates using a 50kg of bulk ore 
sample of Tenabo ore was tested. The sample was crushed to minus 1 inch and placed in a 6 inch 
diameter column. Height of ore in the column was about 63 inches. Cyanide solution strength of 
0.6g/L was dripped into the column for a period of 24 hours. The column was then left dormant 
for the following 24 hours. This 24 hour leach and rest cycle was maintained for the test duration 
of 40 days. The collected pregnant solution was passed through a bottle containing activated 
carbon before being returned to leach. 
 
From the calculated head grade of 0.033oz Au/t, 75.7% was recovered in the first 7 days and 
84.8% gold recovered in the 40 day test period. Lime consumption was 2.56lb/ton ore and the 
cyanide consumption was 1.35lb/ton. 
 
Analysis of the screen fractions of the column feed showed the gold to be concentrated in the 
minus 1/4 inch fraction which comprised 35% of the weight and 86% of the gold. Recoveries of 
gold from the various fractions range from 50% in the plus ½ inch to 94% from the minus 65 
mesh fraction. 
 
An agitated cyanide leach test was also performed on a sample ground to 100% passing 100mesh. 
Based on a head grade of 0.036ozAu/t, the recovery was 94.7% in 24 hours of leach time. It was 
also reported that solution fouling by soluble copper would be minor.

As part of a 1994 feasibility study of the Porphyry Zone resource, Amax conducted detailed 
metallurgical testing in three phases summarized below.  Phase I testing was performed by 
AMAX Research and Development in Golden, CO and Phase II and Phase III testing were 
performed by McClelland Laboratories of Sparks, NV.

Phase I: Preliminary bottle roll leach tests on 32 composite RC cuttings (assay 
rejects) at 10 mesh and 80 mesh.  Composite samples represent a variety 
of oxidation states, gold grade and copper content. 

 
Phase II: Detailed column and bottle roll leach testing on 13 composite  

samples from PQ-diameter (3.3 inches) core, representing variable gold 
grade, oxidation state and cyanide soluble copper content.  Used crush 
sizes of 1 1/2 inches and ½ inch and grind sizes ranging from 10 mesh, 
100 mesh and 200 mesh.   

 
Phase III: Bottle roll testing on 13 composite samples at ½ inch and 100            

mesh.  Composite material is from 3 PQ-diameter core and RC cuttings 
from a new area within the Porphyry resource. 

 
Phase I 

 
Phase I results indicates gold extractions from thirty 10 mesh samples ranged from 60.9 percent 
to 96.9 percent.  Extractions for the two 80 mesh samples achieved 35.3 percent and 50 percent.  
A summary of Phase I metallurgical testing is shown in Table 13.2.

Phase II 
 
The purpose of Phase II testing was to obtain data for process design. Core composites were 
prepared using Amax interval compositing instructions. The 13 composites for columns, bottle 
roll and crushing tests were prepared by blending, coning and quartering each specified interval.  
All rejects from the coning and quartering of 1 ½ inch material were crushed to 80 percent 
passing ½ inch and were blended and split to obtain samples for testing the 10 mesh and finer 
sizes. A total of 337 intervals of core from five PQ-diameter diamond drill holes were used to 
develop the composite samples.  Results of Phase II are summarized in Table 13.3.

Composite head grades were determined by conventional fire assays for gold and silver, triplicate 
gold metallic screen fire assays, multi-element ICP analysis, sulfur speciation, carbon speciation 
and cyanide soluble gold and copper shaker tests. 
 
Bottle roll leach tests were conducted on 13 composites using 1 ½ inch, ½ inch, 10 mesh, 100 
mesh and 200 mesh material to determine gold, silver and copper extractions and reagent 
sensitivity to ore feed size.  Bottle roll tests were conducted over a period of 96 hours. 
 
Column percolation leach tests were performed on 9 composites at feed sizes of 80 percent 
passing 1 ½ inch and ½ inch.  The ore was charged into 10-ft-high columns with inside diameters 
ranging from 4 inches to 12 inches.  The column leach tests were conducted over a period of 39 
days to 53 days. 
 
Results from Phase II testing indicate that gold extractions are highly sensitive to ore crush size.  
Since recoveries were markedly increased with a finer crush size, Amax chose a nominal ½ inch 
crush size as the basis for their heap leach process design.  
 

13.1.2 Phase III 
       
The purpose of Phase III testing was to obtain additional data on extensions of the Porphyry 
resource that were identified after Phase II testing had begun.  Because of time constraints 
imposed by the November 1994 deadline for producing the feasibility study, only bottle roll leach 
tests were conducted during Phase III.  The core intervals were prepared and assayed using the 
same protocols as were the Phase II samples.  A total of 234 intervals from three PQ-diameter 
diamond drill holes, were made into 13 composite samples at crush sizes of 80 percent passing ½ 
inch and 80 percent passing 100 mesh.  Bottle roll procedures were the same as those used in 
Phase II and test results are summarized in Table 13.4.

The culmination of the Amax and McClelland metallurgical testwork studies resulted in MRDI 
proposing a 17000tpd heap leach operation with relocated crushing, screening and conveying 
equipment from the Sleeper Mine in the feasibility study. Ore was to be crushed to minus ½" and 
conveyed to the leach pad. The projected gold recovery at this crush size was 67% for both the 
oxide and sulfide resources. Carbon columns were proposed for treating the gold bearing 
pregnant solution from the heap and a copper strip using cyanide to remove copper from the 
loaded carbon was included in the flowsheet. The resulting loaded carbon after copper removal 
was then shipped to the Sleeper mine for toll processing of the gold. 
 
Following the Amax feasibility study, there has been no additional drilling or metallurgical 
testwork on the Porphyry deposit. Optimization of the crush size ie 10 mesh in a column test and 
other means for dealing with the soluble copper minerals and the resulting high cyanide 
consumption needs further work. In the Amax feasibility study, the conclusion was made that the 
tonnage of ore with high soluble content was small compared to the overall tonnage of the 
mineable ore, hence it was not considered to be a big operating problem for the plant.  
 
13.2 GOLD PAN, ALTENBURG HILL AND 39A RESOURCES 
 
In 1996, McClelland Labs of Sparks, NV conducted metallurgical studies on shallow oxide and 
mixed oxide/sulfide material from the Gold Pan Zone (composites 1-7, 17-19), oxide material 
from Altenburg Hill Zone (composites 8-11) and ore-grade sulfide material from the 39A Zone 
(composites 12-16, 20-22).  These studies included 40 direct agitation cyanide leach tests (bottle 
rolls) using various grind sizes on all the samples; 11 bulk sulfide flotation tests on the Gold Pan 
and the 39A sulfide resource and 5 column percolation leach tests on the Gold Pan and Altenburg 
Hill samples. Composites samples were prepared and analyzed in the same manner as describe 
above in Phase II of the Amax study.   
  
Samples for testing consisted of 9 composites (1-9) derived from 135 five-foot-intervals from 
drill core, 10 composites (10-19) from RC cuttings and 3 composites (20-22) from pulverized 
drill core assay reject samples.  Bulk sulfide flotation tests were conducted on selected 
composites at a nominal 35 mesh.  Results from these tests are summarized in Table 13.5.  Direct 
agitated cyanidation (bottle roll) tests were conducted on all 22 composites at feed sizes of 80% -
11/2 ", 80% -1/2", 80% -35M, 80% -10M and 80-95% -200M.  Results of these tests are reported 
in Table 13.5.  Column percolation leach tests were conducted on drill core composites 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 9 at a feed size of 80% -1/2".  Results from these tests are summarized in Table 13.7.

As shown in Table 13.5, the selected composites tested generally respond well, except for 
composite 1, to beneficiation using conventional flotation methods at 35 mesh grind size.  Gold 
recovery in the cleaner concentrates achieved by flotation for the remaining composites at 35 
mesh feed size ranged from 74.3 to 88.1 percent.  A single flotation test was conducted using –
200M feed size resulted in lower gold recovery probably due to the oxidation products formed 
during grinding prior to flotation. In general the flotation results improved with depth for the 
Gold Pan and the 39A in fill samples. Flotation was not performed on the Altenburg Hill samples.

As summarized in Table 13.6, bottle roll tests conducted on the drill core composite samples (1-
9) averaged only 45.0 percent gold recovery using 80 percent –1/2 inch feed size. Crushing these 
composites to 80 percent –10 mesh improved gold recoveries significantly, averaging 71.2 
percent.  Also a comparison of composite samples used in the column leach tests with the 
corresponding –1/2 inch feed bottle roll composites, indicates that the column tests achieved 
significantly higher gold recoveries than the bottle roll tests (60.8 % vs. 45%). The higher column 
recoveries were probably on account of the 40 or more days of leach time vs 4 days for the bottle 
roll tests.  
 
RC cuttings composites (10-19) from the Gold Pan, Altenburg Hill and 39A were amenable to 
direct agitation cyanidation treatment at the "as received" nominal 10M feed size.  Gold 
recoveries varied from 42.9 to 78.8 percent and averaged 59.9 percent.   
 
Drill core assay reject composite samples (20-22) from the 39A were readily amenable to direct 
agitated cyanidation treatment at the "as received" approximately 95 percent –35M feed size.  
Gold recoveries from these samples were 94.7, 91.2 and 93.2 percent, respectively and were only 
slightly improved by grinding to 80 percent –200M.

As summarized in Table 13.7, composite 1 was readily amenable to simulated heap leach 
cyanidation treatment at 80 percent –1/2 inch feed size, achieving 84.3 percent gold recovery in 
40 days.  Composite samples 6, 8, and 9 were moderately amenable to heap leach treatment at 80 
percent –1/2 inch feed size.  Gold recoveries from those composites were 65.0, 53.8, and 60.0, 
respectively.  Longer leaching cycles are likely to improve gold recoveries slightly.  Cyanide 
consumptions were generally low and lime added to ore charges prior to leaching was sufficient 
to maintain protective alkalinity. The column tests were performed on the Gold Pan and the 
Altenburg Hill samples only.

13.3 LEACH TESTS RESULTS 
 
Results from the cyanide leach tests carried out by Amax (1993-94) indicate that oxidation and 
cyanide soluble copper content are the most important geological variables affecting process 
operating costs.  Generally, greater oxidation of ore-grade material results in a higher gold 
extraction.  The cyanide soluble copper content (average 185 ppm) does not present gold 
recovery problems, but does slow the rate of gold extraction and results in higher reagent 
consumption.  From the process side, gold extractions are highly influenced by crush size.  For 
the purposes of process scoping studies used in the 1994 Feasibility Study, a nominal ½ inch 
crush size, 1.1 pounds/ton of NaCN and 3.0 pounds/ton of lime were used to design optimal heap 
leach recovery.  Heap recoveries were estimated to be 72 percent for oxide ore, 67 percent for 
mixed oxide ore, and 60 percent for sulfide ore, with an overall recovery estimated to be 67 
percent. 
 
Results from preliminary metallurgical testing carried out on behalf of Amax (1996) on drill 
samples from the Gold Pan, Altenburg Hill and the 39A Zone mineral resources indicate that 
most of the composite samples tested respond well to bulk sulfide flotation at 35 mesh and direct 
agitation cyanide leach tests at 10M feed size.  In addition, four of the five composite samples 
used in the column leach tests are amenable to heap leaching at 80 percent –1/2 inch.  Three of 10 
composite samples from CAT-60 drilled in the Gold Pan Zone respond poorly to direct agitation 
at all feed sizes suggesting possible encapsulation and (or) mineralogical problems.  Similar 
results were returned from CAT-62 drilled on the far west edge of the Altenburg Hill resource.  
The poor results retuned from these two holes negatively impacted the overall metallurgical

studies.  It should also be noted that 63 percent of all 1996 metallurgical tests were on composite 
samples from only three core holes, CAT-60 through CAT-62.  These holes are unlikely to be 
representative of the mineral resources from which they were obtained and results should be 
viewed as very preliminary in nature.   
 

13.3.1 Distal, 39A and Altenburg Hill   
 
The 2007 laboratory metallurgical test program was also conducted by McClelland Labs of 
Sparks, Nevada. This program was started in late 2006 and completed in 2007. 
 
The samples tested were assay rejects from the 2006 RC drill cuttings. The 2006 exploration 
program focused on the 39A, Distal and Altenburg Hill deposits. 
 
The 39A composites tested consisted of high and low grade composites. The low grade 
composites were further broken down into shallow near surface mineralization and deep low 
grade mineralization. 
 
The Distal composites were considered deep while the Altenburg Hill composites shallow for the 
laboratory testing methods. 
 
The shallow composites were tested for heap leach amenability whiles the deep for whole ore 
milling followed by cyanidation and whole ore milling followed by flotation. For the high grade 
composites, gravity was included in the test procedure in addition to whole ore milling and 
flotation. 
 
In total, 25 RC drill cuttings composites were tested. There were 5 high grade samples 
(designated HG1 to 5), 2 low grade shallow (LG1 and LG2) and 4 low grade deep (LG3, 5,6 and 
7) from the 39A; 5 from the Distal and 9 from the Altenburg Hill deposits. 
 

13.3.2 Sample Selection and Composite Make-up Information,  
 
The sample selection and composite make up was based on processing criteria. For the shallow 
near surface deposits, the preferred process specification for testing was its amenability to heap 
leaching while for the deeper mineralized zones, testing was focused on whole ore treatment. 
 
The mineralized zones were identified from the drill logs and if the grade and location from 
surface were on interest for testwork, the drill hole and intercepts were noted for those sample 
intervals to be set aside for metallurgical testing. In total there were 25 composites selected for 
this program. The composite make-up information together with the drill hole numbers, the lab 
received weights and the sample preparation procedure are provided in McClelland 2007 report. 
The drill intercepts used can be found in the drill logs and assay report. 
 
A composite from Hole CR-06-26 was selected as an extra for testing as it represented the 
northern-most hole in the 39A zone to return interesting grade material. 
 
Another composite from Drill Hole CR-06-09 was proposed for testing but the wrong sample 
numbers were shipped. Hence testing of this composite was omitted from this program.

13.3.3 Laboratory Test Conditions  
 
13.3.3.1 Gravity Procedure 
 
This procedure was used on the five high grade composites only. Each sample (10 kg) was stage 
ground, using a lab ball mill to 80%-75um in size.  Each milled sample was subjected to gravity 
concentration by passing once through a Knelson (KC-MD3) concentrator.  The resulting gravity 
rougher concentrate was cleaned once by hand panning to produce a gravity cleaner concentrate 
and gravity cleaner tailings.  The gravity cleaner concentrate was dried, weighed and assayed to 
determine gold content. The gravity cleaner tailings and the gravity rougher tailings were each 
dried and weighed, and the tailings weight distributions were calculated. Each of the gravity 
cleaner tailings samples and the gravity rougher tailings samples were blended and split to obtain 
properly weighted samples for reconstituting a 2.5kg recombined gravity tailings sample for 
flotation testing.  The splits from each sample were recombined, and used as feed for a batch 
flotation test.  
 
13.3.3.2 Bulk Sulfide Flotation Test Procedures and Conditions 
 
The bulk sulphide flotation test procedure was used on the recombined gravity tailings and on 
splits of whole ore from the 39A deep composites and the Distal composites. The whole ore 
samples were staged ground to 80% -75 microns in a laboratory steel ball mill while the 
recombined gravity tailings were subjected to a polishing grind of 2 minutes in a lab steel mill. 
 
Flotation was conducted using a Denver laboratory scale flotation unit at 1200rpm. The ground 
pulp was slurried with water to achieve 30 weight percent solids and conditioned for 10 minutes 
with 0.25kg/t CuSO4. Flotation was conducted in 5 stages with incremental additions of 
0.005kg/t of each PAX, Aero 208 and 3477 promoters. Total addition of each reagent was 
0.025kg/t ore. Aerofroth 65 was used as a frother. The pulp was floated at natural pH. The 5 
stages of concentrate  were combined into a rougher concentrate. The rougher concentrate was 
cleaned once to produce a cleaner concentrate and cleaner tail. No additional reagents were added 
during cleaner flotation. The two float products were dried, weighed and assayed to determine 
precious metal content. The rougher tails were dried, weighed and assayed directly in triplicate to 
determine residual precious metal content. 
 
13.3.3.3 Direct Agitated Cyanidation Test Procedures and Conditions 
 
Direct agitated cyanidation (bottle roll) tests were conducted on all 25 composites to determine 
gold recovery, recovery rate and reagent requirements. Tests were conducted on the 39A low 
grade shallow composites (LG1 and LG2) and on all nine Altenburg Hill composites at the 
received (nominal 1.7mm) feed size to determine amenability to heap leach cyanidation 
treatment. Tests were conducted on the 39A high grade composites, 39A low grade deep 
composites and the Distal composites at an 80% - 75 micron feed size to determine amenability to 
milling/cyanidation treatment. 
 
The 75 micron feeds were stage ground using laboratory steel ball mills. Ore charges were mixed 
with water, or settled in grinding water, to achieve 40 weight percent solids. Natural pulp pHs 
were measured. High calcium hydrated lime was added to adjust the pH of the pulps to 11.0 
before adding the cyanide. Sodium cyanide, equivalent to 1.0g NaCN/L of solution was added to 
the alkaline pulps.

Leaching was conducted by rolling the pulps in bottles on the laboratory rolls for either 96 hours 
(as-rec'd feeds) or 72 hours (75 micron feeds). Rolling of the as-received slurries was suspended 
briefly after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours to allow the pulps to settle so samples of pregnant solution 
could be taken for gold and silver analysis by AA methods. Pregnant solution volumes were 
measured and sampled. Cyanide concentration and pH were determined for each pregnant 
solution. Make-up water, equivalent to that withdrawn, was added to the pulps. Cyanide 
concentrations were restored to initial levels. Lime was added, when necessary, to maintain the 
leaching pH at between 10.8 and 11.2. Rolling was then resumed. 
 
Leaching procedures for the 75 micron feeds were essentially the same, except that a 12 hour 
sampling interval was added and the 96 hour sampling interval was deleted. Slurry dissolved 
oxygen levels were also measured at each sampling interval. Measured D.O. levels generally 
were above 6.0 mg/L, and never were lower than 4.0 mg/L. 
 
After 72 or 96 hours, the pulps were filtered to separate liquids and solids. Final pregnant solution 
volumes were measured and sampled for gold and silver analysis. Final pH and cyanide 
concentrations were determined. Leached residues were washed, dried, weighed, and assayed in 
triplicate to determine residual precious metal content.

The five high grade composites from 39A responded very well to whole ore gravity concentration 
followed by flotation at a grind size of 80% passing 75 microns. Gold recovery by gravity after 
cleaning ranged from 38 to 68% and the combined gravity/flotation recovery ranged from 91 to 96%.  
 
Gold values reporting to the flotation rougher concentrate represented between 29% and 54% 
(additional to gravity recoveries) of gold values contained in the ore. 
 
Gravity cleaner concentrates ranged from 562 - 1,529gAu/t (16 - 45 ozAu/t).  Flotation cleaner 
concentrate grades ranged from 49 - 133gAu/t (1.4 - 3.9 ozAu/t).  Flotation rougher (final) tail grades 
ranged from 0.13 to 0.42gAu/t. 
 
Gravity cleaner concentrate weights ranged from 0.16% to 0.30% of the ore weight.  Flotation 
cleaner concentrate weights ranged from 0.59% to 4.63% of the ore weight.  Flotation cleaner tails 
ranged from 1.7% to 2.8%.  Combined concentrate weights ranged from 3.9% to 6.7% of the ore 
weight. 
 
The low grade deep composites from the 39A and Distal deposits also responded well to whole ore 
milling with bulk sulfide flotation treatment at a grind size of 80% passing 75 microns. 
 
The four from 39A provided rougher concentrate grades between 7 and 62 g Au/t with 3.7% to 9.2% 
of the feed weight and represented gold recoveries of between 89.4% and 96.0%. The five from 
Distal provided similar results with mass recoveries to the rougher flotation concentrate of 7.2% to 
13.2%, assayed between 6 and 25g Au/t and represented gold recoveries of between 87% and 95%. 
Flotation cleaner concentrate grades ranged from 11 to 53g Au/t.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 13-15 January, 2012  

The 39A high grade composites were readily amenable to whole ore milling followed by cyanidation 
at a grind of 80% passing 75 microns. Gold recoveries ranged from 97% to 99% in 72 hours of 
leaching. Gold recovery rates were rapid and extraction was substantially complete in 24 hours. 
Reagent requirements were low. These results are comparable to the 1996 met test results from two 
core holes drilled in the 39A Zone. Head assay results showed that all the high grade composites 
contained less than 7 gAg/t ore.  
 
The 39A low grade deep composites also responded favourably to whole ore milling followed by 
cyanidation at a grind of 80% passing 75 microns. Gold recoveries ranged from 93% to 98% in 72 
hours of leaching. The behaviour of these composites is similar to the high grade composites where 
gold recovery rates were rapid and extraction was substantially complete in 24 hours. The reagent 
requirements were also low and there was good agreement between the calculated and the assayed 
head assays. 
 
The 39A near surface composites were readily amenable to direct cyanidation treatment on the as 
received (approx. 1.7mm) feed size. Gold recoveries for LG-1 and LG-2 were 93% and 92% 
respectively in 96 hours of leaching. Gold recovery rates were rapid and the reagent requirements 
were low. 
 
The Altenburg Hill composites also responded favourably to direct cyanidation treatment on the 
approximately 1.7mm feed size but the gold recoveries were lower than the 39A low grade 
composites. They ranged from 54% to 76%, and averaged 67% in 96 hours of leaching based on the 
calculated head. Gold recovery rates were moderate and a longer leaching cycle would improve 
recoveries. Reagent requirements were low. These results are similar to those obtained in 1996 met 
test results on the core and RC samples at the test size of 10mesh. 
 
The Distal composites varied in their response to whole ore milling followed by cyanidation 
treatment at an 80% passing 75 microns feed size. Gold recoveries ranged from 77% to 94%, and 
averaged 87%, in 72 hours of leaching. Gold recovery rates were rapid, and extraction was 
substantially complete after 24 hours. Reagent requirements were low but were higher than for the 
39A composites. 
 

13.3.5 Summary of Historical Laboratory Studies 
 

Metallurgical testwork completed to date suggests that the Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and the near 
surface deposits of the Gold Pan and 39A deposits are amenable to heap leach treatment. 
Optimization of the crush size would be required in future programs together with a column test on 
an overall or representative composite once the optimum crush size has been defined and selected. 
 
No soluble copper problems were noted or identified in the 2007 test program as most reagent 
requirements in the cyanidation series of tests were low. The work suggests the Altenburg Hill and 
the 39A mineralized zones may not have as much soluble copper content as the Porphyry. 
 
There are more processing options available for the deeper deposits of 39A and Distal. In addition to 
whole ore cyanidation where the best gold recoveries were achieved, these deposits are also 
amenable to flotation as well. Should the process selection lean towards heap leaching for the 
treatment of these two deep deposits, then there is the need to optimize the crush size in future test 
programs. 
 
The 1996 test program on the Gold Pan deposit suggests that flotation is a viable process option for 
this deposit at depth with an increase in sulphide content. Further flotation work would be required

for this deposit and the zone of oxidation from the sulphides better defined for the selection of test 
composites. 
 
There were several unusual observations noted when testing the Distal composites. Composite CR-
06-18 used in the bottle roll cyanidation test had to be repeated due to an unusually high calculated 
head grade when compared to the assayed head grade and the calculated head grade form the 
flotation test. This test was repeated and provided a similar result with poor head assay agreement. 
 
Composite CR-06-16 had a very high silver head assay of 8gAg/t compared to the other Distal 
composites of less than 5gAg/t. This abnormality was noted when the solution assays from the bottle 
roll tests were reviewed and compared to the other pregnant solution assays. 
 
These two occurrences on the Distal composites suggests that there may be coarse gold and native 
silver in this deposit. In addition, the reagent requirements for the Distal were slightly higher than for 
the 39A. Mineralogy on the Distal is therefore highly recommended in any future test program and 
comparison should be made with those of 39A as these are deep deposits. 
 
On the Altenburg Hill bottle roll cyanidation tests, the calculated heads in general were higher than 
the assayed heads. It is not known if this is a lab procedure issue or an assaying issue. Confirmatory 
testing for this series of tests would be recommended together with the longer leach time. 
 
The flotation recoveries in general were slightly lower than the whole ore cyanidation results for the 
deep composites tested. Since the flotation tests were performed on RC drill cuttings, these flotation 
results could be slightly bias to the low side on account of surface oxidation of the sulphides. 
Confirmatory flotation tests with core drilling are better and should be considered in future test 
programs. 
 
There is no documentation or reports on the metallurgical characteristics of the Triplet Gulch 
Deposit. Any future test program should include some preliminary work should this deposit become 
of interest for development. 
 

13.3.6 2011 Laboratory Study 
 
A laboratory program was performed in 2011 at McClelland Laboratories undertaken on samples 
obtained from the Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan deposits.  The samples originated from continuous 
drill core intervals obtained during the 2010 exploration program.  Portions of the samples were 
initially composited for use in bottle roll studies, followed by further re-blending of coarser material 
for column leach testing.  A laboratory report by McClelland labs was not available at the time of 
issuing this report, but the interim resulting data is discussed below.  A final laboratory report is 
expected by year end 2011 for this program. 
 
13.3.6.1 Initial Composites  
 
The initial samples were composited for use in bottle roll testing based on their location and head 
characteristics.  Sample identification was based on a prefix AH for Altenburg Hill and GP for the 
Gold Pan deposit, followed by the drill hole number.  Drill hole numbers and intervals used to make 
up the various composites will be included in the McClelland report expected to be issued in late 
December 2011.  Based on head assays the material was classified as either oxide, partially 
(potentially) oxidized, or as sulfide material and identified respectively with a suffix OX, POX and 
SUL.

There were eight oxide composites originating from Altenburg Hill, and two composites classified as 
partially oxidized from the Gold Pan deposit.  Each was subjected to bottle roll testing.  The 
corresponding head assays of these composites are provided in Table 13.10.  
 

Table 13.10: Head Analyses Oxide and Partial Oxidized Composites 

 
 
The gold grades for these composites varied from 0.34 g/t to 1.9 g/t (0.010 oz/t to 0.055 oz/t).  There 
was low associated silver, which increased slightly with a higher gold content.  The copper content 
ranged from 350 to 1500 ppm.  With one exception (AH-CC10-10-OX) the total sulfur content (ST) 
for the oxide material was less than 0.03%.   Total sulfur content in the POX material was 
significantly higher, and a portion of these sulfides had been oxidized based on comparing total 
sulfur to the sulfide sulfur (S2-) analyses. 
 
 The initial metallurgical composites classified as sulfides are listed along with corresponding head 
analyses in Table 13.11. 
 

Table 13.11: Head Analyses Sulfide Composites 

 
 
Precious metal head grades for sulfide composites varied mid range as compared to the previous 
oxide samples with gold contents of 0.54 g/t to 0.86 g/t (0.016 oz/t to 0.025 oz/t).  Copper grades 
were similar for both oxides and sulfides.  For the sulfide composites the Gold Pan had significantly 
higher sulfur content than those of Altenburg Hill.  Gold Pan and Altenburg composites had similar 
extent of oxidation based on the sulfide to total sulfur ratio.

A final set of three composites was prepared on material with low gold grades and originating from 
rock that would be stripped or mined to access the ore.  The sub-samples used for these composites 
were blended together based on anticipated gold grade (low, medium, and high).  These samples 
were labeled as overburden (OB) for the lab program but are not organic or alluvial and are in 
competent rock, originating from drill holes overlying or adjacent to the higher grade ore zones at 
both Altenburg Hill, and Gold Pan, along with one drill hole located in the south Porphyry area.  
  
The gold content in these OB composites is currently below that envisioned to be suitable for 
crushing and leaching on prepared pads.  The material may be suitable for dump leaching and 
consequently was evaluated for cyanidation response in the testing program.  A summary of the head 
assays for the OB composites is provided in Table 13.12.

Despite an attempt to segregate the three samples based on grade from the exploration geochemical 
gold analyses, the three samples had very similar gold and silver content, as averaged from triplicate 
assay splits.  The medium grade sample had higher sulfide content. 
 
13.3.6.2 Bottle Roll Testing 
 
A series of thirty bottle roll tests were performed on the initial composites, with some of the 
composites subjected to alternate procedures including the use of carbon in leach (CIL) methods to 
evaluate any potential preg robbing effect.  Baseline bottle roll procedures including crushing to a 
particle size of 80% passing 1.7 mm (10 Tyler mesh).  Bottle roll testing was conducted under 
protective alkalinity of pH 10.5 to 11 for 96 hours maintaining 1.0 g/L cyanide at approximately 40% 
solids. 
 
The first set of 8 bottle rolls were performed on the Altenburg Hill oxide composites, with the results 
summarized in Table 13.13

Gold extractions for the various samples ranged from 58% to 88% within the 96 hour leach retention 
time. Detailed results the majority of the gold went into solution within the first 24 hours with 
dissolution nearing the maximum when leaching was terminated. The calculated and assayed heads 
for gold appear to be reasonably close.  Tailing gold grades were variable between 0.06 g/t to 0.44 
g/t.  Higher losses roughly correlated to the increased head grades, indicating there may be a benefit 
to increase leach retention times for higher head grades. 
 
Silver recoveries were 26% to 55% on heads of 2-7 g/t Ag.  Soluble copper was typically less than 
10%, except for composite AH-CC10-10-OX, which had 17% copper dissolution.  This was likely 
due to an elevated  sulphate content as compared to the other oxide samples.  Soluble copper did not 
appear to adversely affect precious metal recovery, but cyanide consumption increased to 0.74 
kg/tonne for sample AH-CC10-10-OX as compared to an average of 0.17 kg/tonne for the other 
seven oxide composites.  Lime consumption was reasonably uniform for all samples in a range of 1.5 
to 2.3 kg/tonne. 
 
The next set of bottle roll leach tests discussed are on the two partially oxidized composites Gold Pan 
composites as shown in Table 13.14.  Composite GP-CC10-15-POX was repeated in triplicate due to 
disagreement between the assayed and calculated heads.

If averaging the 3 tests for GP-CC10-15-POX, the bottle roll results gave gold extractions in the mid 
eighty percent range.   The three tests repeated on GP-CC10-15-POX all gave calculated heads close 
to double the assay head.  The tailing grade also showed considerable fluctuation resulting in a 12% 
variation in gold recovery using the same sample and conditions.  This sample also showed elevated 
sulfide content and approximately 25% copper dissolution during cyanidation that may be

contributing to the variability of the sample.  The average lime and cyanide consumptions of the 
three tests performed on GP-CC10-15-POX were similar respectively averaging ~3.2 kg/t and 0.4 
kg/t.  Leach profiles showed minor increases to precious metal dissolution when the testing was 
terminated at 96 hours.  Further work is required to better understand the reasoning behind the 
variability in composite 15.  GP-CC10-13-POX had a gold recovery of 85% in part owing to the 
higher head of 1.68 g/t (0.049 oz/t).  It showed elevated lime consumption of 7.1 kg/tonne, but a 
moderate cyanide consumption of 0.26 kg/t. 
 
The results for bottle roll testing on the Altenburg Hill sulfide samples is provided in Table 13.15.  
Each of the four composites was run using standard baseline bottle roll procedures, as well as a 
second method consisting of carbon in leach (CIL) as a means of investigating preg robbing

The gold extractions for the Altenburg Hill sulfide composites varied between 53% to 70%, which 
are slightly lower than the oxide samples discussed previously.  This is likely in part due to the lower 
head grades and slower leach kinetic response.  Tailing grades were in a similar, but narrower range 
than shown for the oxide composites.  The use of CIL procedures did not show improved gold 
extraction, indicating a preg robbing component due to gold re-adsorption is not present.  
Inexplicably cyanide and lime consumption were consistently elevated in CIL verses the standard 
cyanide procedures.  Cyanide consumptions with standard procedures ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 kg/t, 
which is higher than with the Altenburg Hill oxides.  Lime consumption for the Gold Pan sulfides is 
in a range of 1.4 to 2.2 kg/t, similar to the oxides. 
 
Bottle roll tests were also performed on four Gold Pan sulfide composites comparing CIL to standard 
leach procedures.  The results as outlined in Table 13.16.

The use of CIL did not show a significant improvement to gold recovery with one possible exception 
on sample GP-CC10-15.  This gave a 0.07gAu/t lower tailing grade, transposing into a 7% increase 
in extraction.  Most of the leaching was completed within 96 hours with the possible exception of 
composite 14.  The final gold recoveries on the sulfide composites were lower as compared to the 
two partially oxidized composites evaluated for Gold Pan, and discussed previously.  Again this is 
partly due to the lower head grades, but the tailing also contained higher corresponding gold losses. 
Cyanide consumptions were elevated ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 kg/t.  Lime consumption for the Gold 
Pan sulfide composites varied from 1.7 to 2.2 kg/t, with one notable exception in GP-CC10-13 which 
was 6.3 kg/t. 
 
The three overburden (OB) samples were run under the standard bottle roll conditions and results are 
summarized in Table 13.17.

Original head assay for OB-Comp-Med, showed 0.25 gAu/t, but follow-up analyses with triplicate 
fire assay gave 0.28 g/t for all three composites (see Table 13.12 previously).   This sample also has 
the highest sulfide content of the three composites.  The results indicate all three composites had a 
similar leach profile with relatively fast kinetics and with similar tailing grades.  Calculated heads 
varied slightly resulting in a gold recovery range of 54% to 63%.  Reagent consumption for the three 
composites was also similar ranging from 0.30 g/t to 0.53 kg/t for cyanide, and 1.9 kg/t to 2.5 kg/t for 
lime. 
 
13.3.6.3 Bottle Roll Comparisons  
 
Plots of gold recovery verses head grade, and verses sulfide content are shown respectively in 
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 for all of the oxide (OX), partially oxidized (POX) and sulfide (SUL) 
composites that were tested.

Comparisons within the various composite types indicate that head grade has a minor effect on 
recovery; and that the sulfide content likely plays a more significant roll.  Higher head grade within 
composite types results in modestly higher recovery, and with higher tailing losses that may benefit 
from continued leach retention time.  Generally higher sulfide content corresponds to lower gold 
recovery.  Evaluation of the detailed lab report indicates that the organic carbon content and preg 
robbing factor may have played a related but minor role with the sulfide content.  There does not 
appear to be a strong preg robbing characteristic for these samples.

Cyanide consumption was significantly influenced by extent of copper dissolution and the sulfide 
content in the feed.  Increased copper dissolution and higher sulfide content translated into a marked 
increase in cyanide consumption as shown in Figures 13.3 and 13.4

Tyler mesh for bottle roll testing.  The remaining composites representing oxidized (OX), partially 
oxidized (POX) and sulfide (SUL) ore samples (that were also used for bottle roll tests) were re-
blended into new master composites for column leaching.  Table 13.18 below provides a summary of 
the feed material used in each of the columns, as well as the height and dry weight of the feed, and 
the inside diameter of the column.  A more detailed explanation of the methods follows the table.

Each of the columns were loaded with >95% passing 19 mm (3/4") rock.  Based on the initial loaded 
weight and column volume the respective bulk density of the solids was calculated to range from 
1.53 to 1.57 for the overburden, oxide and partially oxidized samples.   The bulk density of the 
Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan sulphides were 1.64, and 1.56 respectively.  Upon commencement of 
leaching the solution uptake to saturation ranged from 9.4% to 12.9% for the various columns.  
Particle size distribution was performed on each feed material and assayed head grades for the 
column were based on the weight and analyses of the screened fractions.  Lime was added with the 
dried blended solids to the column and protective alkalinity was maintained throughout the leach.  
Agglomeration with cement was not incorporated.   
 
The column leaching tests (P1, P2, P3) were respectively performed on the three overburden (OB) 
samples Low, Med, High, which effectively all had similar head grades of 0.28 gAu/t.   
 
Test P4 was done on the eight oxidized composites from Altenburg Hill blended with the two 
partially oxidized composites from the Gold Pan resulting in an estimated grade of 0.92 gAu/t.  Each 
of these 10 composites of P4 made up roughly equal mass (~10 wt.% ea.) for the 146 kg loaded into 
the column. 
 
The remaining columns had less material available and used smaller diameter columns of 15 cm. Test 
P5 consisted of the same four Altenburg Hill sulphide composite samples that had been used in bottle 
roll testing.  These were blended together for the column leach in approximately equal amounts of 25 
wt.% each and totalled 71 kg with an estimated grade of 0.67 gAu/t.  Similarly, the four Gold Pan 
sulphide composites were blended in roughly equal amounts to produce 73 kg of feed grading 0.74 
gAu/t for test P6.

The seventh column (P7) used of combination of the eight Altenburg Hill oxide composites in equal 
portions of 7.5 wt.% each, accounting for 60% of the mass total loaded into the column.  The 
remainder was made up from the two partially oxidized Gold Pan composites in equal portions 
accounting for an additional 15% of the loaded mass and the Gold Pan sulphides which made up the 
remaining 25%.  The blended material weighed 71.5 kg was calculated to grade 0.87 g/t Au. 
 
Each column was percolated with 1.0 g/L NaCN solution and routinely monitored to record flow and 
cyanide consumption.  Hydrated lime provided protective alkalinity.  The loaded pregnant leachate 
solutions (PLS) from the column underflow were passed through activated carbon.  Gold and silver 
dissolution was routinely measured in the PLS, as well as the barren recycle solution, and ultimately 
balanced against the loaded carbon.  Rest and rinse cycles were employed as deemed appropriate.  At 
termination of leaching the column had a final wash and leached solids analyzed as part of the 
precious metal balance. 
 
13.3.7.2 Results 
 
The seven column tests (P1 to P7) were performed on -19 mm (-3/4") feed material that consisted of; 
 

 P1, P2, P3: three columns of low grade gold mineralization, labelled as overburden (OB). 
 P4: consisting of oxide composites from Altenburg Hill (80% of weight) mixed with partially 

oxidized material from Gold Pan (20% of the weight). 
 P5, P6: two columns on sulfide material composited respectively from the Altenburg Hill and 

Gold Pan deposits. 
 P7: a blended column of Altenburg Hill oxide composites (60 wt.%) with Gold Pan 

composites that were partially oxidized (15 wt.%), with Gold Pan sulphides (25 wt.%).    
 
The feeds were subjected column cyanide leaching with a summary of the results provided in Table 
13.19 below. 
 

Table 13.19: -3/4" Column Leach Results 

 
 
The columns were run for between 59 to 109 days and were terminated based on the leach profile 
showing that gold dissolution was nearing completion.  The three OB composites (tests P1, P2, P3) 
showed slightly different extents of leaching although the profiles remained similar.  For all three 
tests gold leaching proceeded rapidly for the first 2 weeks to approximately 1/3 extraction.  Slower 
kinetics then prevailed with OB Comp High (P3) having the best results with 53% gold extraction.  
This was followed by OB Comp. Low (P1) and OB Comp. Medium (P2) which had 48% and 44% 
respective gold extractions.  The calculated and screened heads ranged from 0.21 g/t Au to 0.32 g/t 
Au, but were generally lower than assayed heads that were performed for bottle roll testing that gave 
0.28 gAu/t.   
 
Silver and copper extraction was not followed for test P1.  Silver showed 20% recovery for P2, and 
36% recovery for P3, respectively on head grades of 1.1 g/t and 1.5 g/t.  Copper dissolution was 
significantly higher on test P2 verses test P3, but did not appear to significantly affect cyanide

The leach profile indicates relatively slow kinetics with minor improvements to overall precious 
metal recoveries expected by further extending the leach times.  Column tailing grades averaged 0.14 
g/t Au and were modestly higher than corresponding -10 mesh bottle roll tests that averaged 0.11 
gAu/t.  This indicates the OB material gold recoveries can be expected to hold up well with larger 
crush sizes. 
 
Test P4 was performed on the eight oxide composites from Altenburg Hill blended with the two 
partially oxidized composites from Gold Pan in equal ratios.  Each of these composites had 
previously been subjected to bottle roll testing.  The final column gold extraction after 98 days of 
leaching is calculated at 62% on a calculated head of 1.09 g/t.  Silver extraction was 28% on a 
calculated head of 3.2 g/t.  The corresponding leach profile is provided in Figure 13-7.

The final tailing grade for test P4 analyzed 0.42 gAu/t.  This compares to the tailing grades in the 10 
corresponding bottle roll tests that ranged from 0.06 g/t to 0.44 g/t, with an un-weighted average 
tailings grade of 0.21 gAu/t.  The overall column performance provided lower gold recoveries and 
higher tailing analyses as compared to the bottle roll testing done on -10 mesh material.  Looking at 
the screen analyses data by particle size fraction of the spent column shows poor extractions were 
achieved in the 40% of material weight above 12.5 mm (1/2").  Material less than 12.5 mm gave 
correspondingly decreasing tailing grades with finer particle size.  This suggests further investigation 
into using a finer crush size than the 19 mm used is warranted. 
 
Column tests P5 and P6 were respectively performed on sulfide composites from the Altenburg Hill 
and Gold Pan deposits.  Gold analyses for test P5 is being rechecked due to poor agreement between 
the assayed and calculated heads.  Leach profiles for these two tests are provided in Figure 13-8 for 
Altenburg Hill sulfides and in Figure 13-9 for Gold Pan sulfides.

The column data shows a relatively poor leach response as compared to the corresponding bottle roll 
tests done on sulfide composites from each of the two deposits.  The four Altenburg Hill bottle rolls 
done by standard cyanide procedures (not including CIL) gave an average un-weighted gold recovery 
of 66% based on 0.23 g/t tailing and 0.52 g/t average calculated head.  Column P5 had 0.38 g/t Au 
with 0.63 g/t Au in the calculated head resulting in 40% recovery.   
 
Similarly for Gold Pan sulfides the un-weighted average bottle roll gold recovery of 52%, based on 
0.34 g/t tailing from 0.71 g/t averaged calculated head.  This compares to a column (P6) tailing grade 
of 0.57 g/t on a calculated head of 0.75 g/t, Au resulting in 24% recovery.  Silver recoveries generally 
followed the gold dissolution profile for test P6.   
 
The lower gold recovery in columns P5 and P6 are likely primarily due to poor permeability of 
sulfide particles in the coarser crushed material.  Lower oxygen availability and minor preg robbing 
characteristics may have also contributed to the lower column leach response.  Cyanide consumption 
for the sulfide material was in a similar range as the other columns as previously summarized in 
Table 13.19. 
 
The final column test P7 was operated on mixed oxide and sulfide materials, with the leach profiles 
plotted in Figure 13-10. 

 

 
Figure 13-10* Leach Rate Profile Column Leach Test F-7

The blended sulfide and non-sulfide composites provided 58% gold recovery based on a calculated 
head of 0.78 g/t that resulted in 0.33 g/t tailing.   This appears to offer a relatively good correlation to 
the expected recovery based on the ratio of sulfide and non-sulfide feed materials used.

13.4 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 2011 laboratory program was performed on 2010 drill core samples composited from the 
Robertson Property to evaluate heap leaching potential.  The leaching studies included testing on 
both oxide and sulfide material from the Altenburg Hill deposit, and on partially (potentially) 
oxidized and sulfide material from the Gold Pan deposit.  The program also included testing of low 
grade gold composites (~0.28 g/t Au) that were classified as overburden from areas that would need 
to be mined in order to access higher grade zones.  Initial test work included bottle roll cyanidation 
performed on 30 composites from these areas and deposits.  Bottle rolls were undertaken for 96 hours 
on composites that had been crushed to minus 1.7 mm (-10 Tyler mesh).  This was followed by 
column leach test work on seven re-blended master composites that had been crushed to 95% passing 
minus 19 mm (-3/4") and operated for periods between 59 to 109 days.  
 
Three overburden (OB) composites with ~0.28 g/t head grades showed bottle roll recoveries 
averaging 59% recovery, with fixed tailing grades of ~0.11 g/t.  The three corresponding column 
leach tests had lower average calculated head grades and gave an average recovery of 48% with 
tailing grades of 0.14 g/t.  Considering the head grade variation the overall coarser crush size in the 
columns compared well to bottle roll data.  The column leach profiles suggest that extending the 
leach time may improve recoveries slightly.  Future evaluation at coarser crush sizes is required to 
determine how the OB material would respond to dump leaching techniques.  A preliminary estimate 
would suggest a gold recovery of 40% to 50% could be expected for OB type material. 
 
A column leach for non-sulfide ore was performed on a blend of Altenburg Hill oxide material (80% 
by weight), blended with partially oxidized Gold Pan material (~20% by weight).   The results

provided a gold recovery of 62%.  This is considerably lower than the average bottle roll testing gold 
recovery of 71%, which was done on the sub-composites that together made up the column feed 
material.  Examination of the results of the screened column tailing suggest that the majority of the 
losses were in the +12.5 mm (+1/2") fraction.  Historic studies suggested that a minus 1/2" crush size 
appeared to be optimum for the property.  The earlier studies also included more detailed 
investigation on the Porphyry deposit and reported that a 67% gold recovery might be applied with a 
-1/2" crush size.  The most recent test data suggests a similar recovery might be applicable to oxide 
composites from Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan, if crushed to ½".   
 
There were two column leach studies performed on sulfide material, one from Altenburg Hill 
composites and the other on Gold Pan composites.  Both tests experienced significantly lower 
recoveries than the corresponding bottle rolls.  A third column used sulfides blended with oxide 
material.  Based on these three overall column results, heap leach recoveries can be expected to 
decrease with the addition of higher ratios of sulfide ore.  Additional study is required to better 
determine this relationship. 
 
Depending on the schedule of project advancement, on-site testing can be considered for both heap 
and dump leaching evaluation to supplement and /or replace portions of a laboratory program.  This 
would involve bulk mining and building of cribs and/or test heaps (with pads and ponds) in order to 
better evaluate leaching of low grade run of mine rock as well as higher grade crushed material.  
Such a program would be costly as it involves contract bulk mining of several thousand tons of rock, 
mobile crushing and stacking, and long term monitoring.  Costs would need to be developed with 
local contractors and suppliers.

14.2 DATA EVALUATION 
  
A total of 1,266 drillholes were supplied for the Robertson Property in Lander County, Nevada which 
are the combined drillholes for the Gold Pan, 39A, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill and Lower Triplett 
Gulch zones in addition to areas that have drilling but lie outside the main areas of interest. The 
drillholes within the database included collars, downhole surveys, assays, and lithology.  
 
The drillhole database (US Imperial) was delivered in electronic format which was supplied by 
Coral. This included collars, downhole surveys, lithology data and assay data (i.e. ozAu/t) with 
downhole from and to intervals in imperial units. It should be noted that some surface data was 
supplied in metric units and then converted to imperial. It is considered that this conversion has been 
done correctly and the author has verified that the data is valid with respect to location. 
 
Simple statistics for the assay data are shown below in Table 14.2 and 14.3, which shows statistics 
for gold assays weighted and unweighted by assay interval, respectively.

The assay Au database (91,121 Au values) shows that gold distributions are very well behaved (in 
comparison with other deposits), still with a some samples in each case representing a outlier 
populations. The mean overall for Au grade (weighted by sample length) is 0.008 ozAu/t with 
standard deviation of 0.031. However, within the individual zones the mean grade is 0.009, 0.013, 
0.011, 0.007, 0.009 and 0.003 ozAu/t for the Gold Pan, 39A, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill, Distal and 
Triplet Gulch areas, respectively. In addition, the assays that lay outside these specific areas are listed 
with the average grade being 0.004 ozAu/t. 
 
Gold assays have a relatively high coefficient of variation (CV) of 3.797, 3.639, 2.412, 2.749, 3.305 
and 6.424, respectively (weighted by sample length in Table 14.3). This indicates a relatively modest 
scatter of the raw data values. The coefficient of variation is defined as CV=σ/m (standard 
deviation/mean), and represents a measure of variability that is unit-independent. This is a variability 
index that can be used to compare different and unrelated distributions. 
 
Figure 14-1 shows the histogram weighted by assay interval length, of all Au assays along with the 
corresponding probability plots in Figures 14-2. The histograms and cumulative probability plots 
shows that the assay data all demonstrate log normal distributions. Figure 14-3 and 14-4 shows a plan 
and long section views of the drillholes.

14.3 TOPOGRAPHY 
 
Topography was imported from an AutoCAD topographic map supplied by Coral in DXF format. 
The topography was surveyed and is believed to be accurate. Checks against drillhole collars 
illustrate and accuracy to within 1 meter with the exception of one drillhole which was identified and 
corrected. In addition, in an effort to delineate the top of mineralization, a model of bottom contact of 
the Quaternary Alluvium layer (QAL) was triangulated from drillhole intercepts. This surface is 
shown in Figure 14-6.

14.4 COMPUTERIZED GEOLOGIC MODELING 
 
Solids models of the main ore zones within the Robertson Deposit were created that encompass the 
Gold Pan, 39A, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill, Distal and Triplet Gulch deposit areas. The ore zones to be 
included within the solids model and then to be used for constraining the interpolation procedure are 
split into an Oxide Zone and a Sulphide Zone where sufficient data existed to do so which included 
that Gold Pan, 39A, Porphyry and Alteberg Hill areas. Due to its depth, the Distal zone is considered 
to be sulphide material. 
 
Once the solids models were created, they were used to then code the drillhole assays and composites 
for subsequent geostatistical analysis. For the purpose of the resource model, the individual solid 
zones were utilized to constrain the block model by matching assays to those within the zones in a 
process called geologic matching so that only composites that lie within a particular zone are used to 
interpolate the blocks within that zone. The orientation and ranges (distances) utilized for search 
ellipsoids used in the estimation process were derived from previous reports, site observations and 
geostatisical analysis. 
 
Figure 14-7 shows the solids created that encompass the Gold Pan, 39A, Porphyry, Altenburg Hill, 
Distal and Triplet Gulch deposit areas. Figure 14-9 illustrates the oxide solid that identifies the 
oxide/sulphide interface. All material lying outside the oxide solid is considered sulphide by default.

14.5 COMPOSITES 
 
It was determined that the 20 foot composite lengths offered the best balance between supplying 
common support for samples and minimizing the smoothing of the grades in addition to reducing the 
effect of high grades to a small extent. However, the primary reason for the choice of 20 feet for the 
composite length was that bench heights are likely to be 20 feet and this will be the selective mining 
unit.  Table 14.4 shows the basic statistics for the 20 foot composites for Au listed by zone and by 
oxide/sulphide sub-zone. Figures 14-13 and 14-14 illustrate the histogram, grade-tonnage curve and 
cumulative distribution plots for gold composite grade intervals. Figure 14-15 shows the box plots 
for each of the zones split by oxide and sulphide with the numeric codes as listed in Table 14.4.  It is 
important to note that the oxide and sulphide for Gold Pan, Altenburg Hill and Triplet Gulch are 
markedly similar and that separation by domaining is not necessary whilst the oxide and sulphide 
within the Porphyry zone so illustrate differing populations and presents a case for domaining. The 
same could be said for Distal however only a small percentage of the assays are in oxide and are of 
very low grade therefore Distal is considered to be sulphide. In addition, 39A illustrates distinctively 
higher grades and character which confirms the need to segregate 39A into an individual domain and 
interpolate separately.

14.6 OUTLIERS 
 
Limiting the influence as opposed to capping of gold assays were performed for although the 
distribution of grades followed a normal distribution the probability plots showed "breaks" which 
indicated multiple populations. The author used the commonly accepted method of determining 
metal-at-risk, which employs the utilization of cumulative frequency plots and identifying "breaks" 
along the plot trend. The grade threshold chosen was determined to be 0.18 ozAu/t. 
 
However, it is important to note the method employed for this study is not to cut the high grade 
outliers but to limit their influence. The range chosen at which to limit grades greater than the outlier 
cutoff was determined to be 50 feet. In other words, composite grades greater than 0.18 ozAu/t  
would not influence blocks greater than 50 feet from where that composite is located.

14.7 SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS 
 
Approximately 215 historic core samples were analyzed for dry bulk density using the volume 
displacement method. Densities for both ore and waste are primarily related to lithology, 
argillization, calc-silicate content and sulfide content. The average density for country rock was 
determined to be 12.2 cu ft/ton and 15.5 cu ft/ton for alluvium (2 determinations). These are historic 
determinations, are located for the most part, within the Porphyry Zone. In addition, 279 specific 
gravity measurements were derived for samples from Altenburg Hill and Gold Pan in 2010. 
 
 
14.8 VARIOGRAPHY 
 
The author carried out geostatistical analysis on the composites to evaluate the search parameters to 
be used in the grade estimate.   
 
Downhole correlograms were generated in order to make an estimate of the nugget effect as that is 
the direction in which there is most abundant data. The downhole correlogram for the complete 
dataset within the zones indicates that the nugget effect is in the order of 55% of the sill for Au as 
shown in Figure 14-17. Although this is relatively high, it is to be expected to some extent and within 
acceptable ranges for a typical gold deposit.

Figure 14-17: Downhole correlogram for Au within all zones. 

 
Geostatistical analyses were also performed on the composites in all directions using no constraints 
in addition to the coded intervals within the zone solids split out by oxide/sulphide. 
 
The ellipsoid direction chosen for the estimation process was chosen to be 0 degrees azimuth and 0 
degrees dip for the major axis and -90 degrees for the vertical axis as there appears to be no 
predominant direction of mineralization. The 39A Zone appears to dip 270 degrees at an azimuth of 
30 degrees so this direction was utilized for the 39A Zone. The Porphyry Zone appears to strike at 45 
degrees at an azimuth of -30 degrees and a rotated vertical orientation of -20 degrees. 
 
The spatial continuity estimator chosen for this study was the correlogram, which has been shown in 
previous work to be more robust with respect to drift and data variability, allowing a better 
estimation of the observed continuity (Parker and Srivastava, 1988). Note that the sill of the 
variograms has been standardized to one, and therefore they are in fact relative variograms.

14.9 BLOCK MODEL DEFINITION 
 
The Block Model used for calculating the resources was defined according to the following limits: 
 
 

 
Figure 14-18: Block Model Origin 

 
The block model is non-rotated as there appears to be no predominant orientation that reflected 
regional or local mineralization trends. Figure 14-18 shows the position and orientation of the block 
model used for the study. The block size chosen was 25 x 25 x 20 foot to roughly reflect drill hole 
spacing available and to adequately descretize the deposit.

Figure 14-19: Block Model Limits. 

 
Of the potential 36,946,000 blocks to be estimated (490 columns, 520 rows, 145 levels); less than 
1,327,655 blocks or 3.6% have estimated values in them (weighted against topography).  This is 
primarily due the geologic constraints applied to the estimation process in addition to the limited 
search distances applied, search ellipsoid direction and the use of ordinary kriging as the modeling 
method.  
 
14.10 INDICATOR ESTIMATION 
 
To further domain the mineralized material within the large, broad zones the author created iso-
volumes of ordinary kriged probability indicators at a 0.005 ozAu/t cut-off grade within which to 
constrain the grade estimation. This methodology entails coding all grades above 0.005 ozAu/t with 1 
and those below with a zero. Variography is then performed and the values are then kriged using the 
correlogram parameters which results in the blocks being assigned with values between 0 and 1 
which represents the probability that the block will have a grade greater than 0.005 ozAu/t (i.e. 0.5 
represents essentially 50% probability). Those blocks that have an indicator greater than 0.5 are then 
clustered into iso-volumes which are edited in order to exclude isolated blocks and portions of the 
iso-volumes that have tails. 
 
These iso-volumes as shown in Figure 14-19, are then used to further domain the zones and constrain 
the resource interpolation

14.10.1  Resource Interpolation 

 
The estimation plan includes the following items: 
 

 Storage of the mineralized zone and iso-volume code and percentage of mineralization. 
 

 Application of density based on limited SG measurements. 
 

 Estimation of the grades for Au using ordinary kriging. 
 

 Ellipsoid orientation was orthogonal and ranges were set to 300 feet in the northing and 
easting whilst 200 feet in elevation. 

 
The estimation strategy employed a minimum of four composites and a maximum of 15 with a 
maximum of two from any one drillhole. 
 
Also, an octant search was used as it aids in declustering the estimate. This means that it helps to 
avoid over-influence of individual drill holes or sectors being overly informed, avoiding the use of 
samples that clustered together and thereby redundant. The maximum number of composites allowed 
in any one octant was two. 
 
The resultant block model is illustrated in plan view in Figure 14-20 at a 0.0147 OzAu/t cut-off grade 
through one level.

 Gold ounces were calculated on the basis of US$1,350/oz Au and 70% Au recovery. 
 The 0.0067 ozAu/t cut-off grade utilized to report the resource was derived from a mining 

cost of US$1.02/ton, process cost of US$5.00/ton and waste cost of US$1.14/ton. 
 The mineral resources in the table above were estimated using the CIM Standards on Mineral 

Resources and Reserves.  
 

14.11.1  Model Validation 
 
A graphical validation was done on the block model.  This graphical validation serves several 
purposes: 
 

 Checks the reasonableness of the estimated grades, based on the estimation plan and 
the nearby composites. 

 Checks that the general drift and the local grade trends of the block model, compared 
to the drift and local grade trends of the composites. 

 Insure that all blocks that should be filled in, are in fact filled in. 
 Checks that topography has been properly accounted for. 
 Checks against manual "ballbark" estimates of tonnage to determine reasonableness. 
 Inspection of and an explanation for high grade blocks created as a result of outliers. 

 
A full set of cross sections, long sections and plans were used to check the block model on the 
computer screen, showing the block grades and the composite.  No evidence of any block being 
wrongly estimated was found: it appears that every block grade can be explained as a function of the 
surrounding composites, the correlogram models used, and the estimation plan applied. 
 
Table 14.6 lists the total inferred resources for all zones by cut-off grade.

Validation techniques are as follows: 
 

 Visual inspections on a section-by-section and plan-by-plan basis. 
 Histogram  at varying cut-off grades demonstrate a very uniform, normal 

distribution. 
 The use of Grade Tonnage Curve as shown in Figures 14-20.  
 Swath Plots showing the comparison of the Ordinary Kriged blocks vs. Inverse 

Distance and Nearest Neighbor estimates. 
 An inspection of histograms of distance of first composite to nearest block, average 

distance to blocks for all composites.  
 Analysis of Relative Variability Index which quantifies variability within the deposit. 

 
It is important to note the nearest distance to composite, average distance to composite and RVI as 
useful tools for categorizing resources may be utilized for future resource classification as a measure 
of quantifying risk and qualifying resources. 
 
14.12 PIT OPTIMIZATION 
 
A series of pit optimizations were run at varying price scenarios. For the purposes of this report, the 
following parameters were used as the basis for the optimization which was the basis for the 
preliminary pit design: 
 

 Ore mining cost of US$1.27 per ton 
 Waste mining cost of US$1.43 per ton 
 Processing cost of US$6.25 per ton 
 Metallurgical recovery of 70% 
 Gold price of US$1,000 per ounce 
 Tonnage factor of 12.2 cubic foot per ton 
 Pit slope angles of 45 degrees

14.13 PIT DESIGN AND RESOURCES 
 
Based on the pit optimization study as described above, the preliminary pit design was created using 
the following parameters: 
 

 Bench interval  20 feet at double benches for a total of 40 feet 
 Berm width  25 feet 
 Pit slope angle 45 degrees 
 Slope angle bench 70 degrees 
 Roadway gradient 8% 
 Roadway width 105 feet

SECTION 16.0 MINING METHODS 
 
16.1 MINING 
 

16.1.1 Resources and Production Rates 
 
The estimated open pit resources for the Altenburg Hill, Porphyry and Gold Pan deposits contained 
within the Robertson property are described in Section 14.  These resources were used to derive the 
yearly mineral production rate based upon mining a maximum 40,000tpd (14 million tons per year).  
This production rate was chosen based on the configuration of the mineralized zones and a mine life 
that balances capital expenditures against operating costs to provide the optimum return on 
investment.  The open pit design incorporates mining the Altenburg Hill and Porphyry deposits first 
as a combined operation.  This is based upon the following; 
 

 size; 
 location and proximity; and 
 strip ratios. 

 
Size 
 
The resources estimated for the Altenburg Hill and the configuration of the deposit is relatively small 
and to mine this independently would not allow for the production rate developed within this plan to 
be achieved.  Thus the Porphyry commences production at the same time as the Altenburg Hill and 
by combining the production from each open pit the required production rate is achieved while 
meeting practicable mining criteria and acceptable operating costs. 
 
Location and Proximity 
 
The Altenburg Hill and Porphyry deposits lie adjacent to each other and close to the proposed 
location for the leach pads to the south and the proposed waste rock disposal area.  The location of 
the ramp entrance to each pit can be accessed by a single haul road located between the pits. This 
allows for an interchange between open pit mining equipment since it can be considered as a single 
pit with two access ramps and provides for a flexible and efficient mining operation. 
 
Strip Ratios 
 
When starting a mine operation such as envisaged at Robertson it is advantageous to minimize the 
strip ratio and maximize grade; often a starter pit will be established to enable this to occur.  
Unfortunately the present resource estimate does not allow for this to be achieved since mining the 
higher grade material only in year 1 and 2 amounts to approximately 1.9 million tons. The grade 
difference between HG and LG is only 0.008 ozAu/t and the extra cost involved in mining this 
material as a starter pit would be more than offset by mining lower grade material in subsequent 
years.  Also the Porphyry pit does not readily lend itself to a starter pit.   
 
The Altenburg Hill deposit is basically a mineralized hill and thus has a low strip ratio, on average 
0.4: 1 waste to ore with a ratio of 0.35:1 for the initial two years whereas the Porphyry averages 2.44 
for the first two years. Thus mining the two deposits together reduces the initial strip ratio 
significantly.

These mineral resource estimates are designated as inferred5.   

Table 16.1 shows the yearly production schedule.  

16.1.2 Pit Design 
 
Open pit operations are planned as a conventional truck-and-shovel operation, utilizing diesel-
powered equipment to maintain flexibility and minimize capital costs.  Several combinations of 
truck/shovel size ranges were evaluated, with the most cost effective being a 40 cuft excavator in 
combination with100 ton haul trucks. Overall pit design was based on an overall slope angle of 45° 
for all walls. This is considered conservative since the geotechnical evaluation indicated 50o.  Ore 
and waste will be mined on 20 ft benches.  Bench width on the northwest and south walls will be 25 
ft; on the east and west it will be 30 ft.  The overall height between benches will be 40 ft, with a 
bench face angle of 70°.   

The crusher will be located at the lower elevation below and to the south east of the Porphyry pit. and 
adjacent to the HG leach pad. These locations have been chosen to minimize haul distances for waste 
and rock (see Figure 1.2).  The haul road within the pit has a maximum grade of 10%.    

16.1.3 Mining Operations 
 
Mining activities at the pits will be conducted on 7 days per week, two 10-hour shifts per day, 350 
days per year. (based upon 52 weeks, 7 days per week gives 365 days less 15 statutory holidays).    
The study has been based upon owner-purchased and owner-operated equipment.  Budget costs for a 
contractor operated open pit operation were obtained from a USA contractor who has experience in 
Nevada 

Ore and waste will be drilled and blasted using 6.5 in. diameter holes on a 15 ft x 15 ft pattern.   

Blasting operations will use a combination of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) and water-
resistant emulsion explosives.  Estimated powder factors range between 0.31 and 0.33 kg/t material.  
There should be no water concerns with the pit envelopes since the pit bottoms are above the water 
table.  Precipitation, due to the low rain/snow fall, is not considered a concern thus it has been 
assumed that about 20% of the holes will be "wet."  

                                                 
5 Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to an inferred mineral resource, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred 
mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured resource as a result of continued exploration.

SECTION 17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 
17.1 PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
 

17.1.1 Introduction 
 
The process description as indicated below is based upon the production rates and proposed mine 
plan.  The general approach is to utilize two heap leach pads one for crushed ore and the other for 
run-off-mine material. The run-off-mine material will required a closer blast pattern than that 
required for the ore to be crushed to reduce the size of material to be placed on the leach pad. 
 

17.1.2 Recovery Methods 
 
Ore will be loaded onto two separate heap leach pads based on gold grade, and at a combined rate of 
20,000 tons per day (tpd).  A high grade pad will be will be employed for ore above a cutoff grade of 
0.0147 oz/ton (0.50 g/mt) following crushing to a nominal ½ inch (12.5 mm) particle size.  A second 
pad will operate on run of mine low grade ore projected to be minus 6 inch (150 mm) and using a 
cut-off grade of  0.0050 oz/ton (0.17 g/mt).  Pregnant leachate solution (PLS) from both pads will be 
directed to a PLS storage pond and pumped to the adsorption desorption recovery (ADR) plant for 
recovery of gold, along with minor silver credits with on-site Dore production.  A simplified 
flowsheet is provided in Figure 17-1. 
 
The high grade (HG) run of mine ore will be hauled by ore trucks from the open pits to the crusher at 
an average expected rate of 7,500 tpd.  The HG ore will be direct dumped into a 150 t capacity dump 
pocket through a 20 inch (500 mm) static grizzly screen.   Closed circuit crushing will consist of a 
200 HP primary 42" X 48" jaw crusher feed feeding a reclaim feeder and conveying to a 200 HP 5.5 
foot standard cone crusher for secondary crushing.  Secondary crushed product would be screened 
with the oversize directed to final crushing using a 200 HP 5.5 foot shorthead cone crusher.   Final 
crushed and screened product will be transported to the heap leach by an overland conveyor and a 
series of portable conveyors to a radial stacker that will place the HG ore onto the pad.  There is no 
agglomeration. The final pad design consists of five lifts, each approximately 10 m high.  The run of 
mine low grade (LG) ore would be trucked at an average rate of 12,500 tpd and transferred to the pad 
by direct dump methods.  ARD plant plan and elevation views are provided in Figures 17-2. 
Crushing plant plan and elevations are shown on Figures 17-3 and 17-4. 
 
The heap leach pads consist of an underlying compacted layer of low permeability soil or clay 
overlaid with a 2 mm thick HPDE/LLDPE synthetic liner.  Overlying material for liner protection 
will consist of crushed and screened HG ore.  Heap irrigation will be by drip emitters for the HG ore 
pad and sprinklers for the LG ore pad at a projected rate of ~12 L per h/m2.  Collected PLS will be 
directed to the pregnant solution ponds.  The process solution ponds will be double HDPE lined and 
equipped with leak detection pumps. 
 
PLS will be pumped to the ADR plant where gold adsorption will be accomplished in two trains, 
each consisting of five 10 ft (3 m) diameter carbon tanks.  Barren solution from the ADR plant will 
be directed to a barren storage pond and reapplied to the heaps.  Gold will be stripped from the 
collected loaded carbon, followed by standard electrowinning and smelting techniques to produce 
Dore.  Operations will be 365 days per year.

SECTION 18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
18.1 GENERAL 
 

18.1.1 Introduction 
 
In order to provide leach pads for the different grades of mineralization two separate heap leach 
pads will be constructed, one for the low-grade ore and another for high-grade ore respectively.  
Low-grade run-of-mine ore will be stacked on the low-grade heap while high-grade ore will pass 
through a crushing circuit prior to being stacked on the high-grade heap. 
 
The heap leach facilities will be constructed on a gently sloping hillside that will drain freely 
under the effect of gravity.  The heap leach pads will be dosed with weak cyanide solution to 
dissolve gold contained within the ore.  Lined collection channels placed along the downstream 
toe of the leach pads will drain gold-bearing solution to the pregnant solution pond.  The cyanide 
solution that has passed through the heaps is referred to as "pregnant" solution.  Pregnant 
solution is then pumped to an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery (ADR) plant.  The ADR will 
strip gold from the solution, rendering the solution "barren".  The barren solution is contained in 
a second pond (termed the barren solution pond) where it will be re-circulated to the heap leach 
pads. 
 
The retained gold will be refined and cast into gold doré bars using facilities located on site. 
 
This report addresses the general civil and geotechnical design conditions that affect the 
development of major mine site earthworks (open pit development, foundation design), heap 
leach pad design, waste management, and site wide surface water management. 
 

18.1.2 Site conditions 
 
18.1.2.1 Climate 
 
Limited climate data is available for the Robertson Property project; however, the project area 
can be described as cold, semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: type Bsk).  Regions of this 
type often exhibit hot and dry summers and very cold winters.  Snowfall often occurs in winter 
months, albeit at much lower quantities than more humid areas at similar latitudes. 
 
The site exhibits a climate that is typical of Northern Nevada high desert.  The area is 
characterized by a short warm to hot summer season, relatively long and cold winters and 
moderate springs and falls. 
 
Mean monthly temperatures (Fahrenheit) are estimated in the low to mid-20s during December 
through February; low to mid-30s in November and March, 50s in May and September and low 
to upper-60s from June through August.  Summer time highs can reach nearly 90 degrees and 
winter lows can fall below zero.  The following table summarizes the monthly climate data that is 
available for the region.

18.1.3 Seismicity 
 
A preliminary review of the regional seismicity has been carried out to enable selection of an 
appropriate design earthquake event for seismic stability assessment of the heap leach facility. 
 
According to maps generated by the US Geological Survey (Figure 18-1), this area has a peak 
horizontal ground acceleration ranging between 0.10g to 0.15g corresponding to the 475-year 
event, defined as an event which has a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years.

18.2 OPEN PIT DESIGN CRITERIA 
 

18.2.1 Information Review 
 
A slope stability study to determine pit slope angles at the Porphyry Open Pit was conducted in 
1994 for Amax Gold Inc. (Watters R., 1994).  The study was based on information derived from 
diamond drill core and core logs.  Four simplified geological domains were delineated, including 
diorite, skarn/endoskarn, Calcite-silicate hornfels and biotite-hornfels.   
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-5 January, 2012  

The 1994 geotechnical study indicated that the East Wall had unfavourable discontinuity 
orientations where 'discontinuities may dip towards the slope face' based on limited outcrop 
stereographic analyses.  The adverse structural features were found to be less significant for the 
rest of the pit walls.   
 
Rock mass characterization was conducted during the 1994 geotechnical study using the Rock 
Mass Rating (RMR, Bieniawski, 1976) classification system.  Rock mass within the East Wall 
was identified to be weaker based on unfavourable discontinuity orientations and resulted in the 
lowering of the calculated RMR.  The average values of the equivalent rock mass shear strength 
parameters for the 1994 Porphyry Pit are below: 
 
East Walls – Friction Angle = 23 degrees, Cohesion = 5100 psf, and  
West, North and South Walls – Friction Angle = 29 degrees, Cohesion = 7400 psf.  
 
The conclusions of this study identified six sectors of the preliminary pit walls for overall slopes 
ranging from 50 to 56 degrees for the West, North and South Sectors and 45 degrees for the East 
Sector.  
 

18.2.2 Slope Stability Analysis 
 
The Porphyry Pit has been expanded and two additional smaller pits, Altenburg Hill and Gold 
Pan, have been included in the current PEA study.  The maximum slope heights for the expanded 
Porphyry Pit, Altenburg Hill Pit, and Gold Pan Pit will be in the order of 700 ft, 500 ft and 300 
ft, respectively (Garth Kirkham, January 2011).  The geological information for the new pits is 
very limited. 
 
A series of limit equilibrium stability sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine 
appropriate overall slope angles for the proposed open pits.  The targeted Factor of Safety (FOS) 
for the overall slopes was 1.3 and the following assumptions were made in the analyses: 

 Average rock mass strength parameters determined from the 1994 study were applied in 
the analyses.   

 It is assumed that the rock mass structural features and rock mass qualities are similar in 
these proposed pits (i.e., weaker rock mass presents in the East Sector). 

 Groundwater table was considered to be below the pit bottom, as the existing drillhole 
data suggests that the regional groundwater table is below the extent of all open pits. 

 The sensitivity analyses cover the following variations: 
 Overall slope angles: 40, 45, 50 and 55 degrees 
 Total slope heights: 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ft, and 
 Rock mass strength parameters: Lower bound (1994 Porphyry Pit East Wall data) and 

upper bound (1994 Porphyry Pit West, North and South Wall average data). 
 
The results of the analyses are illustrated as an FOS vs. slope height chart in Figure 18-2.  The 
currently proposed maximum slope heights, preliminary overall slope angles, and resulted FOS 
for each pit design sector are highlighted as follows:

It should be noted that these analyses considered the overall rock mass stability only.  Rock mass 
structures were not taken into account.  Coarse assumptions of geotechnical parameters (rock 
mass including were made to cover the variation of site uncertainty.  Further geotechnical site 
investigations should be carried out to verify these assumptions.  
 

18.2.3 Summary 
 
Based on limited geotechnical data and the corresponding stability analysis results, the 
recommended overall pit slope angles for the PEA study are summarized below:  
 
Porphyry Pit: 40º (East Wall), and 50º for the rest of pit walls 
Altenburg Hill Pit: 50º, and 
Gold Pan Pit: 50º.  
 
It should be noted that these preliminary recommendations were based on limited information 
and a geotechnical site investigation program should be performed to collect rock mass structural 
and quality data for detailed slope stability assessment.  It is reported that Barrick operations at 
Cortez, located a short distance to the Robertson Project, has achieved overall slope angles 
varying from 45 to 50 degrees.  There may be potential to optimize slope angles when additional 
geomechanical data becomes available. 
 
18.3 LEACH PAD DESIGN CRITERIA 
 

18.3.1 Summary 
 
The proposed heap leach facilities will include fully contained pads capable of treating gold ore.  
Preliminary plans involve the extraction of gold by heap leaching.  The heap leaching process 
will involve the irrigation of weak cyanide solution over successive lifts of heaped ore.  A total 
of 78 million US short tons (Mt) of ore is assumed for the design with consideration for potential 
expansion.  Of this ore, it is assumed that 26 Mt will be routed to the high-grade heap leach pad 
via a mechanical crushing circuit and 52 Mt will be routed to the low-grade heap leach pad as 
run-of-mine ore.  Geotechnical site investigations have not been carried out.  Site investigations, 
design studies and ore characterization will be required to confirm preliminary design 
assumptions and the feasibility of the project as the project advances. 
 
The site selection, general site conditions, geotechnical implications and design requirements for 
the heap leach pads are discussed in the following sections. 
 

18.3.2 Site Selection 
 
The selection of the locations for the heap leach pads was based on the following criteria: 
 

 Proximity to the proposed open pits 
 Minimizing the overall project footprint 
 Storage capacity requirements 
 Potential for expansion 
 Satisfying stability requirements, and 
 Mitigating environmental impact.

While other locations were considered, the preferred site for the heap leach facilities is located 
between the eastern limits of the proposed Porphyry and Altenburg Hill open pits and Nevada 
State Route 306.  This site can accommodate both the low-grade and high-grade heap leach 
facilities and their associated infrastructure.  The gently sloping terrain (1-2%) is conducive to 
heap leach operations, allowing pregnant solution to drain via gravity to solution transfer 
channels located along the downstream toes of each of the heap leach pads. 
 
The proposed heap leach pads will be sited on relatively-uniform gently sloping terrain directly 
to the west of Nevada State Route 306.  The east-facing slope runs down gradient from the 
eastern limits of the Porphyry and Altenburg Hill open pits at approximately 1%.  The site was 
chosen for its proximity to the proposed open pits and the fact that the area has been previously 
disturbed by historic placer mining operations.  Vegetation is comprised primarily of hearty 
shrubs and grasses with no apparent tree cover.   
 
A number of surface expressions exist along the slope.  It is likely that the channels were formed 
by both natural (erosive effects of surface runoff) and anthropogenic means (placer mining 
activities).  The channels are ephemeral and run dry for most of the year.  It is anticipated that the 
channels may be used to further facilitate gravity drainage of the heap leach pads. 
 

18.3.3 Design Objectives 
 
The primary design objectives for the proposed heap leach pads are as follows: 
 

 Provide a stable and cost effective configuration for staged heap development 
 Effectively collect and convey leachate solutions to the pregnant solution pond while 

ensuring maximum recovery 
 Provide secure containment of events solutions while monitoring and minimizing losses 

due to leakage 
 Minimize surface runoff entering the leach pad area while accounting for the collection 

of direct runoff from the heap area 
 Sequential, staged development and leaching operations, and 
 Effective decommissioning and reclamation of all heap leach facility components. 

 
The following sections discuss the storage requirements and preliminary design assumptions and 
parameters for the proposed leach pads.  Design features for each component are discussed 
below. 
 

18.3.4 Design Basis 
 
The following sections outline the criteria for the engineering design of the Robertson Property 
heap leach facilities, associated ponds and drainage controls. 
 

18.3.5 Foundation Preparation 
 
Foundation preparation includes the removal of vegetation, existing structures and unsuitable 
materials, and site grading as follows: 
 

 Vegetation: clear and grub any vegetation. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-9 January, 2012  

 Structures: remove any existing structures or infrastructure that interferes with the 
construction or operation of the proposed facilities. 

 Surface soils: strip organic soil cover to a maximum of 10 feet beyond the leach pad 
limits; organic soil should be placed in a temporary topsoil stockpile for use in 
subsequent reclamation; the exposed ground surface should be scarified, conditioned and 
re-compacted in at-grade and fill areas. 

 Site grading: site grading cut and fill according to design; fill to be compacted as 
directed. 

 
18.3.6 Leach Pads 

 
The two leach pads will be constructed to process run-of-mine (low grade) and crushed (high 
grade) ore.  Components of the pads are described below: 
 

 Arrangement: two single-cell pads (high grade and low grade). 
 Grade: native hillside slopes not to exceed 2.5H: 1V in lined areas; nominally 2.5% in 

the pad base near the toe; minimum of 1% along pregnant pipeline route from pad to 
pond. 

 Perimeter berm: bench graded along perimeter for liner installation; heap to be kept 
within pad perimeter and 2 feet minimum below perimeter elevation. 

 
18.3.7  Pad Liner Systems 

 
The leach pad liner systems provide an impervious boundary to contain leach solution and to 
prevent solution loss.  The components of the pad liner systems are listed below: 
 

 Underliner: geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) deployed on prepared surface; final re-graded 
subsurface or fill surface to be compacted with a smooth drum roller to form a smooth, 
firm and unyielding surface with no protruding particles exceeding 1 inch; GCL installed 
permeability at 1 x 10-6 cm/sec or less. 

 Geomembrane: 80 mil textured HDPE. 
 Geomembrane anchor trench: 3 feet minimum depth. 

 
18.3.8 Overliner and Solution Drainage System 

 
The leach pad overliner protects the geomembrane from exposure to the elements and from 
vehicle traffic during ore loading.  The free-draining overliner, supplemented by drain pipes, also 
reduces the hydraulic head on the geomembrane and speeds solution recovery.  Components of 
the overliner system are listed below: 
 
Overliner: 36 inch minimum thickness of minus 2-inch nominal well-graded, free-draining 
granular material with less than 10% by weight particles passing the No. 200 ASTM sieve size; 
placed in a single lift with no compaction; permeability of 1 x 10-3 cm/sec or higher. 
 
Solution drain pipes: 4 inch diameter perforated (Type SP) corrugated polyethylene tubing (CPT) 
lateral pipes on 30-foot centers to collector pipes and to solution collection channel; perforated 
CPT collector pipes of varying diameters placed across the pad as designed; all CPT lateral and 
collector pipes to be ADS N-12 dual wall smooth interior pipes, or approved equivalent.

Drain pipe capacity: solution flow at not more than 80% of pipe-full capacity for spare capacity 
to handle storm and other upset conditions. 
 

18.3.9 Pregnant Solution Transfer 
 
The pregnant solution transfer allows leach solution and storm runoff to pass from the leach pad 
to the pregnant solution pond.  The pregnant solution transfer system components are listed 
below: 
 

 Location: the solution transfer channels will run along the downstream toe of each heap 
leach pad. 

 Depth: at grade. 
 Bottom Width: 6 feet. 
 Slopes: 2H:1V. 
 Grade: maximum of 2.5%. 
 Liner: transfer channel connected to leach pad geomembrane liner. 
 Capacity: Application solution flow rate at less than 80% bank-full capacity to 

accommodate surges due to storm and other upset conditions. 
 

18.3.10 Pregnant Solution Pond 
 
Solution and storm runoff flows conveyed by the pregnant solution transfer channel drain into 
the pregnant solution pond.  The pond components consist of the following: 
 

 Depth: 12 ft. 
 Crest width: 25 ft. 
 Slopes: 2.5H:1V liner interior; 2H:1V unlined exterior. 
 Bottom grade: graded to drain towards the south corner to facilitate transfer to the ADR 

facility. 
 Liner: 60 mil smooth HDPE bottem (secondary) geomembrane; 60 mil smooth HDPE 

top (primary) geomembrane (surface may be textured for traction); leak detection system 
consisting of geonet between geomembranes on pond slopes and bottom to corner leak 
detection sump and riser/monitor system; 3 foot minimum depth for geomembrane 
anchor trench. 

 Capacity: total: 370,800 ft3; operationally: 286,500 ft3 with upset capacity storage to 
contain 24-hour process solution draindown plus 25-year, 24-hour storm from leach pad 
catchment area plus freeboard. 

 Freeboard: 2 feet minimum. 
 

18.3.11 Barren Solution Pond 
 
Barren solution is delivered to the barren solution pond from the ADR facility.  The pond 
components consist of the following; 
 

 Depth: 12 ft. 
 Crest width: 25 ft. 
 Slopes: 2.5H:1V liner interior; 2H:1V unlined exterior. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-11 January, 2012  

 Bottom grade: graded to drain towards the southeast corner to facilitate transfer to the 
ADR facility. 

 Liner: 60 mil smooth HDPE bottem (secondary) geomembrane; 60 mil smooth HDPE 
top (primary) geomembrane (surface may be textured for traction); leak detection system 
consisting of geonet between geomembranes on pond slopes and bottom to corner leak 
detection sump and riser/monitor system; 3 foot minimum depth for geomembrane 
anchor trench. 

 Capacity: total: 370,800 ft3; operationally: 286,500 ft3 with upset capacity storage to 
contain 24-hour process solution draindown plus 25-year, 24-hour storm from leach pad 
catchment area plus freeboard. 

 Freeboard: 2 feet minimum. 
 

18.3.12 Solution Application 
 
Solution application involves the uniform application of barren solutions, reagents, low grade 
pregnant solution recycle and mark-up water to the heap surfaces for controlled infiltration and 
leaching of the ore.  The solution application parameters are listed below: 
 

 Flow rate: provided by others. 
 Application rate: 56,500 ft3/hr (provided by others). 
 Application method: emitters and/or wobblers. 
 Leach cycle: variable. 
 Active leach surface: 365 acres (low-grade: 188 acres / high-grade: 177 acres) at 

maximum application rate. 
 

18.3.13 Event Pond 
 
The event pond provides addition (dry) capacity to prevent excess storm water runoff from 
overwhelming the pregnant solution pond.  An emergency spillway, sized for the 1 in 25 year 
event, will allow overflow from the pregnant solution pond to drain directly into the event pond.  
As the overflow solution will likely contain cyanide, the event pond will require lined 
construction and leak detection similar to the primary solution ponds.  The event pond design 
criteria are listed below: 
 

 Depth: 22 ft. 
 Crest width: 25 ft. 
 Slopes: 2.5H:1V liner interior; 2H:1V unlined exterior. 
 Bottom grade: graded to drain towards the south corner to facilitate transfer to the ADR 

facility. 
 Liner: 60 mil smooth HDPE bottem (secondary) geomembrane; 60 mil smooth HDPE

consisting of geonet between geomembranes on pond slopes and bottom to corner leak 
detection sump and riser/monitor system; 3 foot minimum depth for geomembrane 
anchor trench. 

 Capacity: Operationally, zero storage.  Upset capacity storage to contain 24-hour process 
solution draindown plus 25-year, 24 hour storm from leach pad area catchments.  7,050 
gpm x 24 hrs = 10,137,600 gallons draindown storage plus 14,219,000 gallons storm 
runoff for a total of 24,356,600 gallons plus freeboard.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-12 January, 2012  

 Freeboard: 2 feet minimum. 
 

18.3.14 Diversion System 
 
Diversion ditches will be constructed up gradient of the heap leach pads to divert storm runoff 
from uphill catchments into natural drainage courses.  Ditches concurrently serve as pad liner 
installation benches.  The diversion system components are listed below: 
 

 Design: trapezoidal channel. 
 Depth: varies. 
 Bottom grade: 1% minimum. 
 Side slopes: varies. 
 Freeboard: 1 foot minimum. 
 Armour: pad liner, riprap or grouted riprap as needed. 
 Capacity: peak flows from the 100-year, 24 hour storm from upstream catchments. 

 
18.3.15 Leach Pad Design 

 
18.3.15.1 General 
 
The two leach pads will be constructed on the east-facing slope of the foothills located to the 
west of Crescent Valley.  The leach pads will extend over an area of approximately 365 acres, 
filling much of the eastern extent of the property (as shown on Figure 1-3).  This area will be re-
graded, lined and configured to drain to the pregnant solution pond located downslope to the east 
of the two pads.  This section contains additional description of the leach pad features and their 
design. 
 
18.3.15.2 Grading Plan 
 
The grading plan involves development of a lower floor area for the pads to facilitate heap 
stability and controlled solution drainage from the pads to the pregnant solution pond.  The 
majority of the pad area is presently situated over mildly sloping terrain with occasional 
undulations.  The natural slopes tend to lie within the range of 1%-2% so significant regrading 
will not be required; however, local undulations may need to be smoothed out. 
 
Perimeter roads or benches may be required to facilitate the construction of the pads.  These 
features may also serve as external storm water diversion.  Drill and blast work is not anticipated 
in the heap leach pad areas.  Benches will be retained operationally for pad perimeter access and 
functionally for storm water diversion. 
 
The pad floors will be backfilled and built up to form surfaces upon which the pad drainage 
systems will be constructed.  The built up floor area occupies the flatter terrain near the toe of the 
pads.  The floor area will be graded to a consistent 2.5% gradient, draining the toe limit of the 
pads.

18.3.15.3 Lining System and Overliner 
 
The lining system is designed to prevent seepage from within the leach pads from escaping into 
the underlying subsurface and groundwater environment.  The liner system will be comprised of 
a composite liner and an overliner containing a leachate collection pipe network.   
 
The composite liner system consists of a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and an 80 mil textured 
HDPE geomembrane.  The GCL will be placed directly on the prepared subgrade using 
conventional installation, overlapping and sealing techniques.  This material is designed to have a 
hydraulic conductivity of 10-6 cm/s or lower.  The 80 mil textured HDPE geomembranes will be 
placed directly on the GCL using conventional deployment, installation, and seaming techniques. 
 
A protective layer of coarse crushed ore will be required over the liner system.  This layer will 
protect the geomembrane from damage during ore placement and will act as a drainage layer to 
maximize solution recovery while reducing hydraulic head on the liner.  The overliner will be a 
3 feet (approx.) thick lift over the full extent of each pad. This is required to cover the main 
solution collection pipes.  For an 80 mil (2 mm) HDPE geomembrane, maximum particle size for 
overliner material should be minus 1.5 inch with low fines content.  The solution collection pipe 
network system will consist of 4 inch HDPE slotted lateral pipes that will drain by gravity into 
12 inch HDPE slotted trunk lines or secondary headers.  These secondary headers will flow by 
gravity into 20 inch HDPE slotted primary headers which will drain to the solution transfer 
channels located at the toe of each heap.  The spacing of the pipes should be designed to limit the 
potential head expected on the liner system. 
 
Sections and details of the proposed liner and overliner system are shown on Figures 18-3 and 
18-4.

18.3.15.4 Solution Transfer Channels 
 
The downstream toe of each heap leach pad will include a lined pregnant solution transfer channel.  
The channels will be lined with 80 mil textured HDPE geomembranes.  These liners will be 
integrated into the pad liner systems using conventional installation, overlapping and sealing 
techniques.  The downstream end of the liner will be anchored into soil to prevent detachment. 
 
The solution transfer channels will drain via gravity to the pregnant solution pond.  A minimum 
gradient of 1% should be maintained to ensure gravity drainage.  
 
Sections and details of the proposed solution transfer channels are shown on Figure 18-5. 
 
18.3.15.5 Solution Ponds 
 
Two separate solution ponds are required for the operation of the heap leach facilities.  The pregnant 
solution pond will receive gold-bearing solution from the two leach pads via the solution transfer 
channels.  Solution from the pregnant solution pond will be pumped directly to the adsorption-
desorption-recovery plant for gold extraction.  The barren solution would then be pumped to the 
barren solution pond. 
 
Each pond will be designed to contain the same volume of solution.  The design criteria are 
consistent with best practices to provide dual-liner protection to semi-permanent cyanide solution 
storage areas. 
 
Figures 18-6 and 18-7 show common details shared between the two ponds. 
 
 
18.4  FRESHWATER SUPPLY 
 
It is anticipated that fresh water will be procured from Barrick's Cortez Operation located 
immediately to the south of the Robertson Property.  Barrick operates a collection of ponds that are 
located directly across State Route 306 from the proposed plant facilities. 
 
This water should provide a suitable source and quantity to sustain heap leach operations; however, 
this component of the project is being assessed by others. 
 
18.5 WASTE ROCK STORAGE AREA 
 

18.5.1 Summary 
 
A preliminary location and layout has been developed for the storage of non-reactive mine waste 
rock.  The waste dump is to be located in the centre of the mine site, approximately equidistant from 
each of the three open pits. 
 
A total of 50 Mt of mine waste rock will be mined from the three open pits over a 13 year period.  
Preliminary waste characterization indicates that it is unlikely that the waste rock is potentially 
reactive.   
 
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-20 January, 2012  
 

18.5.2 Geotechnical Conditions 
 
The Waste Rock Storage Area is situated on a north-facing slope south of the deposit area.  
Vegetation is comprised primarily of scrub brush and grasses.   
 
Geotechnical conditions at the proposed Waste Rock Storage Area have not been assessed. 
 

18.5.3 Waste Rock Storage Area struction and Operation 
 
The following are recommended methods of construction and operation to ensure on-going stability 
and performance of the Waste Storage Area.  These methods may be updated and revised, as 
necessary, based on field observations and performance monitoring during the initial stages of waste 
pile construction. 
 

Pre-Production: 
 

 Strip the foundations of the Waste Rock Storage Area prior to loading to remove the topsoil 
and other deleterious foundation materials 

 Clear vegetated areas prior to placement of waste materials, and 
 Construct diversion ditches and runoff collection ditches where required. 

 

Operations: 
 

 Waste/ore material will be transported from the pit using haul trucks.  The material will be 
end dumped and spread by dozers over the crest of the pile. 

 Load the waste/ore pile in lifts starting at the toe and working progressively upslope.  Each 
lift may be developed at the angle of repose for the material, however, benches should be left 
along the toe of each successive lift to establish a maximum overall slope angle of 2H:1V. 

 The lifts should be loaded and developed in a direction parallel to the slope wherever 
possible to avoid stress concentrations associated with "nose" configurations where the axis 
of the pile extends outward and perpendicular to the slope. 

 Trial sections shall be constructed in the field during the initial stages of development to 
monitor pile stability and foundation performance.  The various waste/ore materials should 
be sampled for characterization and for durability test work to confirm the design parameters. 

 Waste rock material shall be end dumped over the crest to allow for maximum segregation of 
the coarser material at the base of each bench. 

 The construction of sediment control structures consisting of a series of small embankments 
will likely be required downstream of the waste dump to act as sediment entrapment ponds 
for runoff from stripped foundation areas and dump surfaces. 

 
Additional site investigations will confirm if excavating down to competent bedrock is required.  
Bedrock is anticipated at shallow depths throughout the Waste Rock Storage Area with an assumed 
average depth of approximately 10 feet, and will provide a suitable foundation.  In areas where the 
depth to competent bedrock is deeper it may be preferable to stage the waste pile configuration to 
provide suitable stability by buttressing the toe of the waste pile.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-21 January, 2012  
 

18.5.4 Stability Assessment 
 
Stability analyses have not been carried to examine the stability of the proposed waste rock pile.  The 
stability analyses should be carried out using the limit equilibrium modelling application such as 
SLOPE/W.  The program utilizes a systematic search to obtain the minimum factor of safety from a 
number of potential slip surfaces.   
 
The minimum acceptable factor of safety for the waste rock pile under static conditions is 1.3 for 
short-term operating conditions and 1.5 for long-term conditions (after closure).  The consequences 
of failure of the waste rock pile during an earthquake event are likely to be minimal and restricted to 
some displacement of the waste pile slopes.  There would be a negligible impact on the integrity of 
the waste pile and little, if any, impact on other Mine site facilities.  However, for design of the waste 
pile a conservative design earthquake corresponding to the 1 in 475 year earthquake event has been 
adopted with a corresponding mean average maximum acceleration on rock of 0.10-0.15 g.    
 
The seismic stability assessment of the waste rock pile should include an estimation of potential 
seismically induced deformations from the design earthquake.  Potential deformations under 
earthquake loading may be estimated using the simplified methods of Newmark (1965) and Makdisi-
Seed (1977).   
 
Detailed site investigations and stability analyses will be required for future design studies and prior 
to development of the Waste Rock Storage Area.   
 

18.5.5 Reclamation 
 
Preliminary closure requirements for the Waste Rock Storage Area will include on-going monitoring 
of surface and groundwater quality and flow rates, and periodic inspection of the waste rock dump 
slopes.   
 
Reclamation will be carried out in conjunction with on-going environmental monitoring to ensure 
that sediment control and water quality objectives are met.  The final waste rock bench crests will be 
rounded to provide long-term stability.  The bench tops of the final waste rock dump will be covered 
with a suitable topsoil layer and re-vegetated. 
 
18.6  OPERATIONAL STRATEGY 
 
The proposed heap leach pad will be developed in stages.  This will minimize initial capital costs 
while allowing mine operators to maximize efficiency and recovery during leaching.  The general 
operational strategy will involve placing the ore in successive lifts followed by irrigation with leach 
solutions.  The lifts will be placed by conveyor or truck, as appropriate, and spread with dozers.  The 
ore will then be placed in strips parallel to the slope and loaded upslope to ensure ongoing stability 
and to prevent trafficking over the liner.  Proposed bench lifts of 25 feet should be constructed at 
bench face angles of approximately 1.4H:1V.  Berm widths of 36 feet will be left at the toe of each 
lift resulting in an overall slope of 2.5H:1V.  Ongoing pad development will involve extending the 
composite liner upslope to allow for continued lift placement. 
 
Leachate solution will be collected by a series of drainage pipes within the coarse drainage layer at 
the base of the pad.  The drain pipes will connect to main leachate collector pipes for transport to the 
vertical riser pipe within the potential ponding area.  
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-22 January, 2012  
 

The sequence of lift placement and leaching will likely be as follows: 
 

 Place 1.5 inch minus overliner material on the surface of the geomembrane liner to 
provide liner protection and base drainage. 

 Place 25 foot lift of ore, as required, by moveable ore transport conveyors or haul trucks.  
Spread with dozers to establish an evenly graded surface for leaching.   

 Layout irrigation lines for drip leaching.  Sprinkler leaching may also be possible during 
summer months as part of a rotational, cell-type leach operation. 

 Cover irrigation lines with ore having a thickness greater than the depth-of-freeze in the 
fall to prevent freezing during winter operations. 

 Leach the lift of ore above the irrigation lines prior to loading with the next 25 foot lift. 
 
18.7  MONITORING AND RECLAMATION 
 
Monitoring and reclamation will be carried out on an ongoing basis to ensure the safe and effective 
operation of the heap leach facility while minimizing impacts to the surrounding environment.  
Preliminary recommendations for monitoring and reclamation are summarized below: 
 

18.7.1 Monitoring: 
 
Surface water quality sampling in surrounding creeks downstream of the facility.  
 
Installation of monitoring wells around the facility to monitor groundwater quality during operations 
and at closure.  These wells would be installed prior to development to obtain baseline information 
for comparative assessment. 
 
Installation of an LDRS to monitor and recover any leakage through the liner systems within the 
solution transfer channels and process water ponds. 
 
Slope movement monuments and survey control points will be installed and monitored to ensure the 
integrity and stability of the ore heap. 
 

18.7.2 Reclamation: 
 
Grading and re-vegetation of final heap slopes to provide adequate drainage and erosion protection 
from surface runoff.  This may be carried out during operations as the final slope of the heap is 
developed. 
 
Detoxification of the ore at the end of operations. 
 
Removal of geosynthetic liners from the heap leach pad areas including pregnant and barren solution 
ponds as required. 
 
Decommissioning of the pregnant solution recovery system. 
 
Removal of pregnant solution pond pumps and pipe works. 
Application of topsoil and seed mixture to all disturbed areas, as required. 
 
Details of the monitoring and reclamation plans will be developed in conjunction with the 
appropriate regulatory authorities.

Storm water diversions are required to redirect surface runoff away from mining-related 
infrastructure and disturbances.   
 

18.8.2 Design Storm 
 
The Robertson Property is located in central Nevada.  The average rainfall intensity for the design of 
storm water diversion structures utilized data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Point Precipitation Frequency Estimates and the National Weather Service's 
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center.  Table 18.2 lists the annual return interval (ARI) events 
for the region and Figure 18-9 depicts the depth-duration-frequency curves for the project area.

18.8.3 Design Methodology 
 
A hydraulic analysis was carried out for mine site to determine the storm water runoff volumes and 
flow rates for sizing on site diversion channels.  The SCS curve number method presented in the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Technical Release 55 (TR-55) Urban Hydrology 
for Small Catchments was used for the analysis.

18.8.3.1 Catchment Characteristics 
 
It is anticipated that the mine site footprint will be approximately 1,500 acres.  The hydrologic 
characteristics of the on-site soils are currently undefined; therefore a curve number (CN) of 70 was 
assumed for analysis based on the following assumptions: 
 

 Soils in the site belong to hydrologic soil group D. 
 Vegetation at the site consists of sagebrush with grass understory in fair condition. 

 
Disturbed areas were assessed a CN value of 80, while the waste rock storage area and heap leach 
pads were given CN values of 70. 
 

18.8.3.2 Channel Geometry 
 
In order to determine the appropriate size of the storm water diversion channels the peak runoff from 
the hydrologic analyses was used to determine the capacities.  For analysis it was assumed that all 
channels will be designed with 2H:1V side slopes and minimum longitudinal slopes of 1%.  Channel 
roughness was assumed to correspond to a Manning's coefficient of 0.025 based on relatively smooth 
constructed channel conditions.

18.8.3.4 Event Pond Design 
 
The event pond is hydraulically connected to the pregnant solution pond via a broad-crested overflow 
located along the east side of the pregnant solution pond.  The overflow is sized to convey flows in 
excess of the 25-year storm event of 24 hours duration.   
 
The pond will be maintained in dry condition to provide contingency storage in the event of a large 
storm water event or to accommodate planned or unplanned draindown of either or both heap leach 
pads.  Once the given event has passed, the solution will be pumped to the ADR plant for gold 
recovery and cyanide detoxification if required.

18.9   ELECTRICAL SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION 
 

18.9.1 Summary 
 
This  portion of the project Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) covers electrical power, control 
and communications aspects and includes both capital and operating costs. 
 
This electrical report is based on the development of a 40,000 ton per day surface mine and 
processing facility.  The cost estimates are expressed in US dollars and are based on constant 2011 
prices. 
 
The proposed facilities covered by the electrical PEA  include the mine (mining equipment, 
dewatering pumping (if required) and portable lighting will be diesel powered) and surface facilities 
including a crushing plant, ore conveyors, leach pads, ponds, ADR plant, fresh water pumping and 
ancillary buildings consisting of a gate house, offices, warehouse, dry, workshop/service garage and 
fuel storage.  
 
Electrical power will be supplied by NV Energy (formerly Sierra Pacific Power Company).  In 2017, 
it is planned to establish a 25 kV service via a tap from an existing nearby 120 kV line, a 120 - 25 kV 
substation and two miles of 25 kV distribution line.   
 
The Robertson Project's service point will be located at a main site substation to be built and owned 
by Coral Gold adjacent to the ADR Plant.  The main substation will include NV Energy's revenue 
metering, two step-down transformers and the main secondary 4.16kV distribution switchgear.  This 
switchgear will then distribute power to the various load centers around the site via buried cable to 
nearby loads and overhead lines to more distant loads, e.g. crushing, pregnant solution and fresh 
water pumping and the mine workshop.  To provide power during a utility outage, an emergency 
generator will be installed to allow an orderly shutdown of the plant, ongoing communications, and 
freeze protection. 
 
Electrical services will be generally designed and built to current North American best available 
technology standards and will include grounding, lighting, security, small power, welding, heating, 
process power, process control, instrumentation, fire protection, site and off-site communications 
systems.  For this study, all materials and equipment have been assumed to be new. 
 

18.9.2 Introduction 
 
This section of the report has been prepared by Kaehne Consulting Ltd. (KCL) of North Vancouver, 
BC under the direction and at the request of Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd., consultants to the 
project, who are conducting the overall Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) of the Robertson 
Project near Crescent Valley, Nevada on behalf of Owners, Coral Gold Resources Ltd. (Coral).   
 
The purpose of this report is to provide a PEA of the design, capital and operating cost of electrical 
power supply, distribution and services for the Robertson project based on development of a surface 
mine, crushing, conveying, leach pads, pumping, processing plant and ancillary buildings. 
 

18.9.3 Electrical Power Supply 
 
The Robertson project is estimated to have a peak electrical load demand (15 minute thermal 
average) of 2 MW, a load factor of 0.8 and an average annual energy consumption of 14 GWh.  



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-27 January, 2012  
 

Average power factor will be 0.95 lagging or better, achieved with power factor correcting 
capacitors. 
 
Electrical power supply will be provided by NV Energy who will develop a new tap from a nearby 
120 kV transmission line, install a 120 - 25 kV step-down substation near the tap, and run two miles 
of new 25 kV distribution line to a new main substation near the project main entrance and gate 
house.  NV Energy has provided a preliminary capital estimate of $1 million to cover this work.    
 
Coral will build and own a 25 - 4.16 kV main site substation and the downstream 4.16 kV three 
phase distribution system from the service point at the main substation to various load centres around 
the property.  
 
NV Energy has indicated that the addition of the Coral load of 2 MW to the existing 120 kV 
transmission system is most likely possible under present system loading conditions.  They do 
advise, however, that before their offer can be considered firm, a system study would be required at a 
possible cost to Coral of about $20,000.  In our opinion, this is normal utility practice and is 
considered reasonable. 
 
Correspondence has been done with NV Energy to determine the details of the GS3 tariff applicable 
to Coral and their calculation of the present average unit cost of energy that would apply.  Note that 
the GS3 tariff is a "time of use" tariff, meaning that the rate changes with summer and winter seasons 
and on-, mid-, and off-peak daily periods. 
 
18.9.3.1 Main Site Substation 
 
Coral will build and own a new main site substation consisting of twin 1.5/2.0 MVA 25 - 4.16 kV 
three phase outdoor power transformers complete with primary isolation and protective devices.  NV 
Energy's revenue metering will be located here and check metering may be installed if desired.  
Either one of the main transformers will have sufficient capacity to carry the plant load at its forced 
cooling rating.  A line-up of secondary 4.16 kV switchgear will provide the source for various power 
feeders to the mine, crushing, ADR plant, pumping, ancillary buildings and miscellaneous loads.

18.9.4 Electrical Distribution 
 
Power will be distributed from the main site substation at 4.16 kV, three phase, 60 Hertz to load centres via 
overhead power lines or cable feeders mounted on ladder trays or buried underground, as appropriate.   Local 
to each load centre, a unit substation will step power down to 480 volts and lower for general consumption.  
Overhead power lines at 4.16 kV will extend to the mine area, crushing and freshwater pumping.   
 

18.9.5 Process Drive Motors 
 
Process drive motors will be totally enclosed fan cooled (TEFC), high efficiency.  These motors have been 
priced as part of the mechanical equipment they drive and are not included in this portion of the cost 
estimates.  With the exception of the 200 HP crusher motors which will be 4 kV, all other process motors will 
be 460 volt three phase or, for small auxiliary motors, 120/208 or 120/240 volts.  Larger drives will include 
power factor correction via static capacitors. 
 

18.9.6 Grounding 
 
The main substation will be provided with an overall ground grid, gradient control mats where required and 
structure and fence grounding systems.  Overall ground resistivity is limited to 1 ohm to ensure acceptable 
touch-and-step potentials.  If necessary, a remote ground electrode will be used.  All buildings and major 
outdoor structures will be connected to a buried grounding system with a maximum resistance to ground of 5 
ohms.  This may be achieved with grounding rods or few deep holes with copper piping installed.  
 

18.9.7 Lighting 
 
Lighting will be provided to meet safety and statutory requirements.  Highbay discharge lighting will be used 
in process and service buildings with a mounting height of 20 feet or more.  Lowbay vapourtight discharge 
lighting will be provided in other process and service areas, fluorescent lighting in offices, control rooms and 
similar.  Exit lights will be provided where required.  Emergency lighting will provide minimal lighting for 
safe egress in event of a power failure.  Outdoor lighting will be provided where required from fixtures 
mounted on building exteriors.  Pit lighting will be provided by mobile trailer-mounted units. 
 

18.9.8 Fire Detection & Suppression 
 
POC (products of combustion) and ROR (rate of rise) detector heads will be installed in transformer rooms, 
electrical rooms and control rooms.  No sprinkling is permitted in these areas.  Suppression systems will be 
either CO2 or halon replacement, manually operated. 
 

18.9.9 Security 
 
An allowance has been made for surveillance/security systems consisting of cameras and monitoring 
equipment.  It is expected that all site security will be located at the guardhouse located at the main property 
entrance. 
 

18.9.10 Process Control / Instrumentation 
 
The main elements of the process control equipment will be controlled/monitored through a fully redundant 
PC based HMI (Human-Machine Interface) similar to Wonderware's Factory Suite and will be centralized at 
a control room in the ADR  building.  Control will be PLC based and will not have manual override.   
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 18-31 January, 2012  
 

Conveyors will have standard control devices: emergency pull cord switches, belt misalignment switches, 
speed and plugged chute switches where applicable. 
 
The primary ore conveyor will have a weightometer.  Process water tanks will have continuous level 
monitoring with ultrasonic level transmitters. 
 

18.9.11 Plant Site Communications 
 
An allowance has been made for an in-plant intercom system. This will be a self-contained system with 
multi-channel selective calling. 
 
Allowance has been made for telephone, data and internet communications to and from the Robertson project 
site. 
 
18.10  OTHER SURFACE INFRASRUCTURE 
 

18.10.1 Transportation of Doré Bars 
 
The transportation of the gold doré bars does not pose any concerns. It is likely that they would be 
transported to Bratislava by a security truck specially designed for carrying small value loads.  Security 
personnel trained for this purpose will travel with the truck.  
 

18.10.2 Fuel Storage 
 
Fuel storage requirements at the site have been estimated at 500,000 liters based upon an average one-month 
consumption.  Access to the site is available at all times, thus delivery of fuel would be on a regular schedule.   
 

18.10.3 Explosive Storage 
 
Minimal explosives will be stored on site since access to explosives in the area on a regular basis is feasible.  
 

18.10.4 Warehouse/Shops 
 
The warehouse will be 67ft (20 m) wide x 140ft (42 m), and will include offices.  The maintenance facilities 
will have two service bays, a wash bay, a tire repair bay, small truck repair bays, offices, and a shop area. 
 

18.10.5 Administration Building / Security and Gatehouse 
 
The administration building consists of a two-storey building designed to provide sufficient area for the 
projected staff and associated persons.   
 
The security building will have sufficient facilities to store emergency vehicles and serve as a gatehouse. 
Figures 18-9 through 18-15 outline the proposed surface ancillary facilities.

The Project area consists of approximately 7300 acres, of which 169 acres are private lands, held as 
patented mining claims either owned or controlled by Coral Gold Resources, Inc. (Coral). The 
remaining 7131 acres are public lands administered by the BLM Mount Lewis Field Office (MLFO) 
in Lander County; Coral controls approximately 601 unpatented lode and placer claims on these 
public lands. 
  
This mixed estate makes the MLFO the primary agency for authorizing mining activities on public 
and private land; the MLFO works with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection – Bureau 
of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) under a memorandum of understanding to authorize 
mining on projects on both public and private lands. 
 
The Robertson Project was developed in the Tenabo Sub-district of the Bullion mining district, which 
has been the focus of historic and modern mineral development operations. The historic operations, 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 20-2 January, 2012  
 

which began in 1869, are comprised primarily of underground and placer operations while the 
modern facilities have been focused primarily on open pit/heap leach facilities in the western portion 
of the district.  
 
The Project area was first mined in 1905, and the town of Tenabo was founded. Placer gold was 
discovered in 1907 and again in 1916, but significant production did not begin until 1931. Since that 
time, mining has been limited, and production has been small. Coral operated the Robertson Mine in 
1988 and 1989. The site is presently in post-closure monitoring; however, exploration activities have 
continued. Reclamation activities associated with previous mining disturbance as well as recent 
exploration disturbance have been ongoing. The site also has extensive mining-related disturbance by 
other parties. 
 

20.1.2 Authorized Exploration Activities 
 
Exploration operations on public lands administered by the MLFO have been authorized under the 
previous Plan for the Robertson Project (Plan) (NVN-067688 submitted in September 1986 and 
subsequently modified in June 1990, January 1991, July 1997, October 2003, September 2004, May 
2006, and November 2007) and under a Notice of Operations (Notice) for the Try-View Project 
(NVN-087413 authorized June 8, 2009). The BMRR issued Reclamation Permit #0055 to cover this 
disturbance. 
 
Coral is authorized to create 211.5 acres of surface disturbance under the Plan and reclamation permit 
for the Robertson Project and 2.45 acres of surface disturbance under the Notice for the Try-View 
Project, for a total of 214 acres. The site also has extensive mining-related disturbance by other 
parties of which Coral has elected to reclaim some portions. 
 
To date, about 19 acres of waste rock dump and 13 acres of process area have complete surety 
release leaving about 214 acres that have not been entirely reclaimed and released. Of these 214 
acres, about 39 acres are associated with roads and 11 acres are associated with exploration.

4 Previously categorized as disturbance by others that Coral recontoured and now assumes 
reclamation responsibility. 
 
The bond amount that is presently obligated to reclaim the 214 acres of disturbance is US$352,934. 
 
Coral is presently constrained on disturbance associated with exploration activities as the allotted 
acreage and number of holes and pads authorized in the 2007 Plan amendment. The authorized 
disturbance included 10.4 acres for 50 drill sites and sumps as well as cross-country travel and new 
roads. 
 
In addition to the water pollution control permit, the reclamation permit, and BLM authorization, 
Coral presently maintains a general stormwater permit with a stormwater pollution prevention plan. 
 

20.1.3 Proposed Exploration Activities 
 
An amended Plan and reclamation permit application was submitted to the MLFO and BMRR in 
April 2010 and was then withdrawn at the MLFO's suggestion to incorporate a different strategy. 
The revised Plan was re-submitted to the MLFO and BMRR in November 2010 and has undergone 
multiple MLFO reviews. This Plan proposes an additional 80 acres of disturbance associated with 
exploration and baseline data collection activities; the Try View notice will be rolled into this action, 
and the notice will be retired 
 
An environmental assessment (EA) will have to be prepared to analyze potential environmental 
impacts associated with the proposed drilling activities. Baseline data collection for threatened and 
endangered plant and animal species has been completed, and Class III cultural resource surveys are 
underway. According to the cultural resources consultant, Kautz Environmental, Inc., the area 
contains numerous cultural resources that may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places 
(NRHP) (personal comm. B. Malinky). Further, the Gylding Pit contains an eagle nest which has 
potential ramifications for curtailing exploration and mining activities within a buffer zone during the 
nesting season. 
 
The May 2011 Plan responding to the MLFO comments has been re-submitted and has been deemed 
complete, so the EA can be formally initiated. This process usually takes six to eight months to 
complete; however, the MLFO presently has a staff shortage, so work on some projects has been 
delayed indefinitely. The best case scenario is that the EA can be initiated in July 2011 and be 
completed in seven months. 
 

20.1.4 Future Mining 
 
20.1.4.1 Conceptual Plan 
 
A conceptual mining plan was provided that depicted the following facilities: 
 

 three pits: Gold Pan, Porphyry, and Altenburg Hill; 
 a waste rock dump; 
 a low grade heap and a high grade heap; and 
 a transmission line. 

 
Other components that will be needed include:

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 20-4 January, 2012  
 

 haul and secondary roads; 
 processing facilities and solution ponds; 
 water wells, pipelines, and water storage; 
 shops, warehouse, and fuel and reagent storage; 
 sanitary facilities and potable water; 
 growth media stockpiles, borrow areas, fencing, exploration, power lines, landfill, and 

stormwater controls.  
 
Because the future mine will be located on both public and private land, federal, state, and local 
permits will have to be acquired as shown in Table 20.2.

20.1.5 Federal Permitting 
 
A mine plan of operations (Mine Plan) will have to be prepared to describe the construction, 
operation, reclamation, and closure of each facility along with a bond cost estimate that presents the 
reclamation and closure costs.  
 
The Plan has to provide sufficient detail in order to identify and disclose potential environmental 
issues during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, which will require the 
preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS).  
 
The primary difference between the two types of documents is that an EA is prepared when no 
significant impacts are expected or the potential impacts are unknown. An EIS acknowledges the 
potential for significant impacts to occur, and analyzes and discloses what those potential impacts 
are. The BLM will look at several triggers to determine whether an EA or an EIS is the most 
appropriate document to disclose potential environmental impacts.  
 
Because the Coral Project area is in such close proximity to the Cortez Gold Mines, the BLM may 
consider the development and operation of the mine to be significant. Based on recent experience the 
BLM will likely require an EIS due to the potential for cumulative impacts.  
 
There are potential issues and risks of preparing and EA in lieu of an EIS. The greatest risk is that an 
EA is imminently more appealable than an EIS. It is far easier to appeal an EA than and EIS. Due to 
the size of the environmental footprint of the project and the general opinion that the EIS route is the 
likely requirement by governmental agencies this approach forms the basis for approval process for 
this project. 
 
Recent experience in the Battle Mountain District indicates it is likely that an EIS for a 
mining/mineral processing project will take at least 36 months. The process is controlled by internal 
BLM situations that are beyond the control of the project proponent, and also a number of potential 
external events such as public or cooperating agency opposition that could, and often do, delay the 
EIS schedule. Thus, it is not uncommon for a mining EIS to take three to five years. 
 
The MLFO is requiring that at least one year of baseline data be submitted with the Plan of 
Operations/Reclamation Permit Application. The ongoing cultural resources survey is expected to be 
completed in the fourth quarter of 2011, which will be a major milestone in baseline data acquisition. 
 
Long-lead items that must be considered include groundwater sampling in the project area for depth 
and quality for use in the NEPA analysis and water pollution control permit application. 
Geochemical characterizations of waste rock, ore, and spent ore are another study that should be 
started as soon as possible and include acid base accounting (ABA), meteoric water mobility 
procedures (MWMP) testing, and humidity cell (HCT) testing. The geochemical characterization 
program must be approved in advance by the BLM and the NDEP. 
 
Table 20.3 presents a listing of the types of studies that should be undertaken during the mine 
planning phase and in advance of the NEPA process; these studies will also be used to support the

Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 20-9 January, 2012  
 

20.2.1.1 Schedule 
 
The time to acquire permits is expected to be on the order of four years as the MLFO is now 
requiring a year of baseline data collection prior to submitting the Plan of Operations and 
Reclamation Permit Application. Much of the data has been collected or will be completed by the 
fourth quarter of 2011; however, the MLFO may request groundwater sampling to determine the 
depth and quality of water in the project area. 
 
The EIS process is expected to take on the order of 36 to 48 months based on experience on Nevada 
over the last 10 years.  
 

20.2.2 Liabilities 
 
Historical Workings 
 
The Robertson Project area has been mined since 1905 with many features left from that time. These 
artifacts not only include surface disturbance but also old features from processing. Liabilities 
associated with surface disturbance and feature related primarily costs and delays from having to 
mitigate site potentially eligible for the NRHP. The processing facilities constructed prior to 
environmental regulation may be associated with contaminated soils petroleum, mercury; however, 
signs of petroleum spills were not evident during the site walk on September 17, 2010. 
 
Numerous underground openings can found within the Project area. No liability exists provided 
Coral does not use these as part of their exploration or mining. If underground openings are used, 
Coral will be responsible for fencing the openings to prevent inadvertent access. 
 
A review of the Nevada Bureau of Corrective Actions web database did not identify active corrective 
actions as of April 28, 2011 or closed corrective action cases from 1990 and April 28, 2011. 
. 
Fresh Water 
 
The heap leaching facilities will require at a minimum several hundred gallons per minute of fresh 
make-up water. The Crescent Valley hydrographic sub-basin is presently over allocated with most of 
the water allotted for mine dewatering. Acquiring water rights under these circumstances may be 
difficult; however, Coral may be able to negotiate with Barrick Cortez Mines to purchase excess 
dewatering water. 
 
Eagle Nest 
 
A golden eagle nest is located in the Gylding Pit; this nest has been known to be active within the last 
several nesting seasons. Golden eagles have recently come under closer scrutiny by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and subsequently the BLM. 

Bald and golden eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (Act) (16 ISC 
668-688d). The Act prohibits the taking or possession of and commerce in bald and golden eagles, 
parts, feathers, nests, or eggs with limited exceptions. The definition of "take" includes pursue, shoot, 
shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest, or disturb. "Disturb" means to agitate or 
bother a bald or golden eagle to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific 
information available: 

 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 20-10 January, 2012  
 

 Injury to an eagle; 
 A decrease in its productivity by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, 

or sheltering behavior; or 

 Nest abandonment by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or 
sheltering behavior. 

Further , Instruction Memorandum  2010-156, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act – Golden 
Eagle National Environmental Policy Act and Avian Protection Plan Guidance for Renewable 
Energy has been adopted by the BLM for mining activities on public land. This guidance requires the 
BLM to consider direct, indirect, and cumulative effects be considered. Best management practices 
and avian protection plans have to be developed to prevent or reduce impacts to golden eagles. 
Surveys will have to be conducted prior to ground disturbance in the breeding and nesting seasons to 
determine the presence or absence of eagles as well as other migratory avian species protected under 
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If nesting or brooding eagles are determined to be present, Coral 
would have to avoid the area using a buffer zone developed in coordination with the BLM and/or 
NDOW biologists. Some mines in the area are required to use a ten-mile buffer zone. 

 
The presence of nesting and foraging habitat may limit future exploration and mining during the 
nesting season. Because the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the BLM are presently determining 
the scope of the protection measures that will be required, the effect to mining operations cannot be 
ascertained.  
 
Native American Concerns 
 
The Western Shone Tribe and Great Basin Resource Watch continue to protest against the U.S. 
government (BLM) and the presence of the Barrick Cortez mines. This dispute is long-standing, but 
is unlikely to affect Coral's existing and proposed operations. Other nearby mining operations such 
as Klondex Mines Limited's Fire Creek Mine have not encountered concerns from the Native 
Americans during the permitting process. 
 
Cultural Resources 
 
The Project area contains many prehistoric and historic sites that are eligible for the NRHP. Ideally, 
Coral will avoid eligible sites and by doing that, save on time and expense. Sites cannot be mitigated 
until the NEPA process is complete, and construction will have to wait until the field work is 
completed and the BLM issues a Notice to Proceed. Based on correspondence with Margo Memmott 
(Kautz Environmental), at least two of these sites are likely to occur within the area of proposed 
disturbance. 
 
Proximity of Cortez Gold Mines 
 
The Robertson Project area is in close proximity to Barrick Cortez Inc.'s Cortez Gold Mines 
(Cortez). This operation is one of the largest open pit/underground mine complexes in Nevada. 
Numerous EIS's have been prepared over time to document baseline conditions and potential impacts 
from the operations. The proximity to Cortez offers some unique advantages: 
 
 
 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 20-11 January, 2012  
 

 The baseline conditions are well-documented and can be used to supplement future NEPA 
analysis performed by Coral; 

 Social and economic conditions are well known in Crescent Valley as a result of past studies; 
 The hydrologic regime is well-studied; 
 Cortez must dispose of dewatering water not utilized in their process. Coral may consider 

approaching Cortez to see about acquiring a portion of the dewatering water; 
 

Claims by Others 
 
Presently, two claim blocks held by others but without use agreements are located adjacent to and 
overlap into some of the proposed development areas. SRK understands Coral has attempted to 
negotiate agreements with the owners (Newmont and John Filipini) for use of the claims. Although 
the developments can be redesigned to avoid these claims, the presence of these claims without a use 
agreement is likely to cause problems for Coral in the future. The BLM and the BMRR will closely 
review the original mine plan and subsequent amendments with an eye to ensuring these claims are 
not affected by Coral's development. The claim owners will have to be notified of each proposed 
activity and subsequent amendments before the agencies will proceed with approvals 
 
Mercury 
 
The limited MWMP tests conducted did not identify mercury as occurring over the Nevada water 
quality standards. The Nevada Mercury Control Program (NMCP) is a state regulatory program that 
requires mercury emissions controls on thermal units located at precious metal mines. The program 
achieves mercury reduction via add-on control technologies. At this time, the NMCP regulations 
focus on the potential for mercury emissions from thermal processing units only.  
 
At the core of the NMCP is "NvMACT." NvMACT is the Maximum Achievable Control 
Technology designated by the NDEP in accordance with NAC 445B.3677. Pursuant to NAC 
445B.3625, owners or operators that operate, construct or modify a thermal unit that emits mercury 
must apply for, and obtain, a mercury operating permit to construct. Construction of a new or 
modified thermal unit that emits mercury requires a permit before construction begins.  
 
A brief review of some available data indicated mercury appears to occur if fairly low concentrations. 
A mercury operating permit will not be necessary if Coral can demonstrate that less than five pounds 
per year of mercury will be processed. 
 
Long Term Trust Fund 
 
The MLFO is presently asking about long term trust funds (LTTF) for mining and exploration 
projects and implying that an LTTF is necessary. In the past, an LTTF was used to cover 
uncertainties identified during an EIS process. The MLFO has been considering LTTFs in 
conjunction with the reclamation bond instead of as a contingency; the reclamation bond already 
contains a ten percent contingency in the indirect costs. Coral may be asked to provide additional 
funds in an LTTF for the Robertson Project if uncertainties are identified during the NEPA process.

SECTION 21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 
21.1 CAPITAL COSTS 
 

21.1.1 Introduction 
 
The capital costs for the Owner operated alternative have been estimated based upon budget quotes 
from suppliers, Costmine Mining Cost Data (Infomine USA Ltd.) and in house data.  The contractor 
operated (Alternative 1) capital cost estimate mirrors the Owner operated cost and excludes that 
mining equipment as provided by the contractor. 
  

21.1.2 Basis of Estimate 
 
The cost of mobile equipment is based upon budget vendor pricing of new equipment for a recent 
North American project and from in-house files.  All other equipment prices have been based on the 
cost of new equipment 
 
The purchase of trucks has been timed to reflect the requirements throughout the mine life.  
 
The equipment requirements were derived from the proposed mine plan and projected equipment 
performance criteria. Costs for replacement equipment were included as ongoing capital throughout 
the mine life. 
 
All costs are expressed in fourth quarter 2011 US dollars, with no allowance for escalation, interest 
during construction, taxes, or duties.  Rates of exchange are stated as CDN$1.00 to US$1.00.  A 15% 
contingency has been added to the estimate to allow for unforeseen capital requirements and 
overruns.

21.2 OPERATING COSTS 
 

21.2.1 Basis of Estimate  
 
21.2.1.1 Mining Base Case 
 
Project operating costs were estimated based on an overall  average  production rate of 20,000 tpd 
mineral and an average stripping ratio of 0.6:1 (i.e., a total average daily production of approximately 
32,000 tons of material) which includes the low grade (0.005 to 0.0147 ozAu/t) leached on a separate 
pad. An operating schedule of 2 x 10 hr shifts per day for 350 days per year was incorporated into the 
mine plan based upon a seven-day week. Statutory holidays were not worked (52 weeks @ 7 days 
per week is 365 days, less 15 for allowance for all statutory holidays, 350 days).   

The operating cost estimate is based on local labour rates and productivity factors, as well as local 
material and supply costs where applicable for Nevada.  The labour rates obtained covered a broad 
range of job categories for both hourly rated and staff personnel and included all allowances for shift 
premiums, statutory social benefit premiums, vacations, medical benefits, etc.  The costs for some 
bulk supply and consumable items, such as fuel and explosives, were obtained from local sources, 
but items such as drilling supplies, tires, and equipment maintenance costs were estimated from 
typical North American cost criteria.   

21.2.1.2 Mining Alternative 1 
 

 The open it operating cost are based on the following; 
 Production is based on 5 days/week, one and then 2 shifts per day and from 8 hours 

per shift up to 10 hrs per shift.

haul roads is included. 

 An estimate for topsoil r e m o v a l  and stockpiling in the pit and waste dump areas is 
included. 

 All bulk explosives, explosives accessories, drilling, and drill accessories are included. 
 All management and supervisory costs are included. 
 Transportation of hourly employees to and from the worksite is included. 
 The capital costs  for a maintenance facility, an equipment wash facility, and a fuel 

storage facility are  not  included  in the estimate per your  instructions, however; the  
cost  to operate and maintain the  maintenance facilities are  included in the  estimated

21.3 CRUSHING AND ARD PLANT 
 
The process costs are based upon the crushing plant to crush at 7500tpd the HG ore and the ARD 
plant to process leachate for both the HG and LG leach pads. 
 
The operating cost estimate for the crushing facilities and ARD plant have been based upon the costs 
established in Costmine documentation derived by Infomine. 
 
These costs are indicative of the costs for projects similar to the conditions in northern Nevada, USA.  
The operating cost shown on Tables 21.13 reflects the cost to process 7500tpd which is the crushed 
HG mineralization and Table 21.14 the estimated cost to process 12500tpd of run-off-mine material.

SECTION 22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
22.1 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 

22.1.1 Financial Analysis Method 
 
The financial analysis has been prepared using standard discounted cash flow methods to determine 
the NPV and IRR of the project based upon 100% equity financing and metal price of US$1350/oz 
Au.  This gold price is some 8% greater than the trailing three year average and reflects most analysts 
opinion of higher gold prices Than the trailing price would suggest.  The analysis was performed in 
constant 2011 US dollars, excluding inflation.  Various sensitivities have been completed to 
determine the effect of metal prices, capital costs, operating costs and leach recovery. 

22.1.2  Results Base Case 
 
Case 1 (Base Case) economic evaluation is are based on an initial construction capital expenditure of 
US$122.1 million operating cost of $5.28/ton mined and metal prices of US$1350/oz6. The project 
will generate an after-tax IRR of 15.44% and an NPV of US$180.6 million undiscounted and 
US$97 million discounted at 5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 5.91 years.  The 
inferred resources established in this study are 78.2 million tons grading 0.0138 oz/t of gold. 

Case 1 summary is shown on Table 22.1. 
 
Case 5 reflects a gold price of US$1500/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an after-tax 
IRR of 20.13% and a NPV of US$247.2 million undiscounted and US$147.1 million discounted at 
5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 4.72 years.  
 
Case 7 reflects a gold price of US$1750/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an after-tax 
IRR of 27.24% and a NPV of US$358.3 million undiscounted and US$230.7 million discounted at 
5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 3.91 years.  

Sensitivity studies have been prepared varying the price of gold, the operating and capital cost, grade 
and leach recovery. The project most sensitive to gold price, sensitive to operating cost, grade and 
recovery and least sensitive to capital cost. The sensitivity results are shown on Table 22.2. 
 
Graphs have been prepared showing the sensitivities and are included in this section.   
 
It should be noted that the financial analysis has been evaluated on the basis of the construction 
activities being set against proceeds and those costs for the period to a construction decision have 
been included as sunk costs although these development costs have not been incurred at the time of 
writing this report.  This is considered as an acceptable approach since any decision to construct will 
be based upon the financial analysis at the time following completion of the development activities.  
Thus the expenditures for construction only are set against the proceeds of the project and not the 
development costs.  To include the development costs in the capital costs will not provide a basis for 
a fair evaluation of the project. 

                                                 
6 It should be noted that the authors of this report have not and do not forecast the future price of gold.  The alternatives 
shown in this report are intended to indicate the variation of the project financials based upon sensitivity criteria shown.

22.1.3  Results Alternative Case A1 
 
Case A1 economic evaluation is are based on an initial construction capital expenditure of 
US$97 million operating cost of $6.45/ton mined and metal prices of US$1350/oz. The 
project will generate an after-tax IRR of 15.43% and an NPV of US$159.4 million 
undiscounted and US$85.2 million discounted at 5%.  Payback of initial capital can be 
achieved in 5.94 years.   
 
Case A1 summary is shown on Table 22.3. 
 
Case A5 reflects a gold price of US$1500/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an 
after-tax IRR of 20.96% and an NPV of US$226.4 million undiscounted and 
US$135.9 million discounted at 5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 4.86 years.  
 
Case A7 reflects a gold price of US$1750/oz. Under this scenario the project will generate an 
after-tax IRR of 29.18% and an NPV of US$337.8 million undiscounted and 
US$219.7 million discounted at 5%.  Payback of initial capital can be achieved in 3.82 years.  
 
Sensitivity studies have been prepared varying the price of gold, the operating and capital 
cost, grade and leach recovery. The project most sensitive to gold price, sensitive to 
operating cost, grade and recovery and least sensitive to capital cost. The sensitivity results 
are shown on Table 22.4.

SECTION 23.0ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The Robertson Property is completely surrounded by unpatented mining claims owned mostly by the 
Cortez JV and a few junior companies.  Immediately west of the core Robertson claim block are the 
"Excluded" claims which are subject to a joint venture between Coral and Cortez Gold Mines in 
which Coral has a 39 percent carried interest.  There are no known mineral resources located on the 
"Excluded" claims.  North of the Robertson core claims are a series of scattered and mostly small 
groups of unpatented claims and private property (part of the Newmont "checkerboard").  Most of 
these properties are in the early stages of exploration and none have reported mineral resources.      
 
Approximately 4 miles south of the center of the Robertson core claims is the Pipeline/South Pipeline 
mine complex owned and operated by Barrick Gold Corporation.  As reported in Barrick's 2010 
annual report, proven and probable reserves are estimated to be 317 million tons having an average 
grade of  0.046 ozAu/t.  However, this estimate includes proven and probable reserves from Cortez 
Hills and the Pediment deposits.  For the 9 months ending September 30, 2007, the last year it was 
reported separately, Pipeline/South Pipeline mine produced 240,000 ounces of gold from 15,948,000 
tons of ore (Barrick, 2007 third quarter mine statistics).  Mining is by open pit, while processing is by 
conventional milling using cyanide and CIL and standard heap leach technology.  
 
The Pipeline/South Pipeline are Carlin-type, sediment hosted gold deposits within the Gold Acres 
structural window.  The gold deposits are hosted by favorable carbonate rocks in the lower plate of 
the RMT.  Besides favorable lithology, major ore controls include a series of northeast striking 
fault/fracture zones and a set of stacked, flat-lying shear zones.  These deposits are in sharp contrast 
to the smaller and lower grade hornfels-hosted deposits that are developed at Robertson in the upper 
plate of the RMT.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 25-1 January, 2012  

SECTION 25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
25.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Based on drilling results through 2008 the Robertson Property has an inferred mineral resource 
estimated to contain 178.9 million tons of mineralized material having an average grade of about 
0.0189 ozAu/t at a 0.0106 ozAu/t cutoff grade (Beacon Hill, 2009).  Of this total resource, about 64.5 
million tons having an average grade of 0.017 ozAu/t and containing about 1.1 million ounces of 
gold are considered shallow oxide mineralization potentially amenable to open pit mining and 
possible heap leaching.  In addition, approximately 85.7 million tons of the total resource, having an 
average grade of 0.0188 ozAu/t, are classified as sulfide and could potentially be mined by open pit.  
The amenability of the sulfide resource to heap leaching is unknown at this time and must be 
determined before the sulfide resources can be considered.  It is anticipated, but not certain, that a 
large portion of the 178.9 million tons of inferred resources will be upgraded to a measured and 
indicated mineral resource as a result of the proposed 2012-13 drilling program.  This will be 
accomplished by offset and in-fill drilling by diamond core drilling where needed and by conducting 
appropriate metallurgical and geotechnical studies.  
 
With the exception of the Gold Pan Zone, the remaining resources were drilled out by either Amax 
Gold (1990-1996) or Coral Gold Resources (2004-2010).  It is the opinion of the author that the 
quality of work by these companies justifies a high degree of confidence in the data that was 
generated.  The use by these companies of highly skilled drilling companies, high quality assay labs 
and the routine employment of QA/QC programs provides additional confidence in the data 
generated during their exploration programs.  One concern is the general lack of diamond drilling in 
most of the resources, except for the Porphyry Zone.  It is strongly recommended that future resource 
definition drilling be conducted using mainly diamond drilling. 
 
About one-half of the Gold Pan inferred resource was originally drilled out by E & B Exploration 
(1980-1981).  While only a limited record of their work is available, it appears that the drilling and 
assaying met or exceeded industry standards of that time.  During 1990-1996, Amax drilled 
approximately 25 RC holes in the Gold Pan Zone within the area initially drilled by E & B, as well as 
to the west where the zone overlies the 39A mineralization.  In addition, Coral Gold also drilled the 
same areas during the period 2004-2010.  The drilling by both Amax and Coral appear to confirm the 
results of the E & B drilling.  However, one area where follow up drilling was unable to confirm the 
earlier drilling is the area now covered by an existing heap leach pad.  The leach pad was constructed 
in 1989, well after the E & B drilling, but prior to the Amax and Coral drilling.  Drilling on or in 
close proximity to the leach pad has been and continues to be prohibited by the BLM.  The leach pad 
is approximately 850 ft by 800 ft and may cover as much as one-third of the resource.  As a result, 
the portion of the resource that underlies the leach pad was estimated using only historic drilling (E 
& B and early Coral 1986-1988), some of which is considered of marginal quality.

25.2 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The following is a list of the conclusions; 
 

 The Robertson property is one of merit upon which further work is warranted consisting of 
exploration and definition drilling, metallurgical test work, geotechnical test work and 
associated work that will allow the preparation of a project evaluation to a prefeasibility 
level.  

 The relative low capital cost provides an opportunity for a junior company such as Coral to 
raise those funds and operate the project. 

 The project is  seen as one where a contractor operation would be beneficial due to the since 
the increased operating cost of some 49% above that estimated as an owner operation is off 
set by the decrease in capital cost, thus providing a lower capital cost6 for the Owner while 
maintaining similar economic benefits. 

 The Nevada project approval system has elongated the development period for the project. 
Every effort should be made to attempt to reduce the time to achieve regulatory approval of 
the project and allow the project to be developed as quickly as is feasible.  

 The financial analysis results indicate that the project breaks even at US$950/oz gold for the 
Owner operation and US$1010/oz for the Contractor.

SECTION 26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
It is recommended that the project be developed in two stages.  The first is that work required to take 
the project to complete a prefeasibility report and then that work required to complete a full 
"bankable" feasibility, i.e., one on which a construction decision could be made.  Costs have been 
included for stage 2 in the capital cost section for guidance only and will be defined in the 
prefeasibility report. 
  
The work in stage 1 consists of; 
 

1. Exploratory and definition drilling. 
2. Metallurgical test work program. 
3. Environmental program. 
4. Geotechnical and associated work. 
5. Preliminary Feasibility Study.  

 
A summary of stage 1, estimated to cost $7.9 million, is shown on Table 26.1. 
 
Cost breakdowns are shown on Tables 26.2 and 26.3.

26.1 EXPLORATION AND DEFINITION DRILLING 
 
It is recommended that Coral conduct a two phase exploration program focused on expanding and 
up-grading the near-surface oxide and sulfide inferred mineral resources to measured and indicated.  
The details of the proposed work program and budget are presented in Table 26.2.  The size of Phase 
II is contingent upon favorable results of Phase I.  
 
The Phase I should consist of drilling 40 HQ diameter diamond core holes and 42 RC holes having 
an average depth of 400-500 ft and totaling about 40,000 ft.   
 

 Porphyry Zone:  Is currently defined by approximately 200 drill holes (150 RC holes and 
50 core holes) totaling 80,000 ft drilled by Amax in 1992-94.  Because these holes were 
completed prior to implementation of NI43-101 Standards of Disclosures for Mineral 
Projects, these drill holes are considered to be "historic" and, therefore, the Amax data must 
be verified before the Porphyry resource can be ungraded to measured and indicated.  To 
comply with the NI43-101 rules, it is recommended that 10 percent (20 holes) of the historic 
drill holes be "twinned" by diamond core drilling.  If the twin core holes compare favorably 
with the historic drilling, it can be assumed that the "historic" Amax drilling data can be used 
with confidence.

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 26-2 January, 2012  

 It is also recommended that an additional 17 RC holes, totaling about 7,600 ft, be drilled 
along the west and south boundaries of the Porphyry Zones to test for possible extensions to 
mineralization.  

 
 Altenburg Hill/South Porphyry Area:  Twenty-five RC holes totaling 12,400 ft as offset 

drilling on the north flank of Altenburg Hill and in the gravel-covered area south of the 
Porphyry Zone.  Of particular importance is testing the undrilled granodiorite-hornfels 
contact area extending at least 1,500 ft north of holes CR08-31/CC10-3.  The 
intrusive/hornfels contact is the principal control of mineralization in the Porphyry and 
Altenburg Hill Zones.   

 
 Gold Pan Zone:  Twenty wide-spaced diamond core holes totaling 10,000 ft to verify 

continuity and grade retuned in historic drilling.  These holes will also provide material for 
additional metallurgical test work. 

 
 Phase II should consist of 20 HQ diameter diamond core holes totaling about 10,000 ft.  The 

purpose of core drilling is to provide geological data on the controls of mineralization, 
acquire geotechnical data (RQD and specific gravity), confirm grade and continuity and 
provide material for metallurgical testing.   

 
 Altenburg Hill/South Porphyry:  Assuming the Phase I RC drilling identifies a substantial 

increase to the Altenburg Hill/South Porphyry it is recommended that follow up diamond 
core drilling (20 holes) be conducted in these areas to provide ore-grade oxide and sulfide 
mineralization for metallurgical studies and confirm the grade and continuity of 
mineralization. 

 
Total cost of both phases of the proposed 2012-13 drilling program is expected to be about US$3.1 
million.  Phase I will begin as soon approval of the 2010 APO is granted by the BLM and NDEP, 
pending drill rig availability and weather conditions.  As proposed and assuming two RC rigs and 
two core rigs are employed, it is estimated that Phase I RC drilling will take about 50 days to 
complete and core drilling will take 120 days to complete, including days off.  The timely completion 
of Phase I will depend on the availability of diamond core drills which have been difficult to secure 
in Nevada during the last few years.  Assuming that two core rigs are employed, the Phase II program 
should take about 60 days to complete, including days off.

26.2 METALLURGICAL TEST WORK PROGRAM 
 
Testing of oxidized ore zones from Altenburg Hill, and Gold Pan deposits have been shown to 
respond to heap leach processing.  Further evaluation of these two deposits and any other additional 
ore zones being considered for development are needed as the project proceeds into prefeasibility.  
Further testing will be required on the Porphyry deposit which has had prior studies performed by 
AMAX and others, but additional confirmation laboratory work will be needed.  
 
Variability testing would be performed on samples obtained both spatially and at depth for the oxide 
and transition to sulfide ore zones.  Prior to variability testing composited material representing 
larger zones of each deposit require more detailed work to better define the crush size and other 
process conditions. These master composites should be based on similar physical characteristics of 
the rock including SG, mineralogy, lithology, as well as chemical similarities based on the analyses.  
Once characterized, then representative samples need to be submitted for crushing work index and 
abrasion testing, as well as mineralogical evaluation of column feed and products.  Some of this work 
requires receiving whole drill core.  Extensive column work would be undertaken to determine 
optimum crush size and other process conditions.  The recent 2011 laboratory program focused on 19 
mm (3/4") product crush size.  However, when comparing to some historical work a 12.5 mm (1/2") 
crush size and work will include this size as well as other sizes.  Optimization and variability testing 
for oxide and partially oxidized material is expected to approach $350,000, not including the cost of 
generating the sample from drilling programs.  
 
Similar testing as was performed on oxide materials would be required for sulfide and transition zone 
materials.  The amount of column studies would be rationed depending on the resource tonnage 
identified in these deposits. In addition to gold grade it will be important that resource development 
and mine scheduling include classification of ore as oxide, partial oxide (transition) and sulphide 
material. Sulfide materials have shown a decreased leach response and additional processing 
parameters might be investigated including reagent use and concentrations.  Dependent on grade 
shell characteristics the evaluation of alternate processing procedures can be investigated for higher 
grade sulfide feeds.  This could include tank leaching and flotation studies.  The estimated budget for 
this portion of a test program performed on sulfide material is $200,000. 
 
A lower gold cut-off grade of 0.005 oz/ton (0.17 g/tonne) was included in this study.  For the 2011 
test program samples of this material were labeled as overburden (OB) and evaluated for cyanide 
amenability.  The results show an encouraging response and the possibility of dump leaching of run 
of mine low grade materials.  The next step of evaluation for these materials should involve large 
particle size rock.  North American laboratories are capable of handling up to 10 tons of 100% minus 
300 mm (~12") feed.  Several such samples would need to be mined, transported, studied and 
disposed.  The work should also include some conventional columns using coarse crush material.  
Estimated budget for such a program is $350,000.     
 
Depending on the schedule of project advancement, on-site testing can be considered for both heap 
and dump leaching evaluation to supplement and /or replace portions of a laboratory program.  This 
would involve bulk mining and building of cribs and/or test heaps (with pads and ponds) in order to 
better evaluate leaching of low grade run of mine rock as well as higher grade crushed material.  
Such a program would be costly as it involves contract bulk mining of several thousand tons of rock, 
mobile crushing and stacking, and long term monitoring.  Costs would need to be developed with 
local contractors and suppliers. 
 
The overall cost is estimated to be $900,000 as shown on Table 26.3.

26.3 GEOTECHNICAL AND ASSOCIATED INVESTIGATIONS 
 
The proposed geotechnical and associated investigation costs are included in the feasibility costs 
estimates.  It is planned to geotechnically log the core holes drilled as part of the exploration 
program. This information together with the list below will form the basis for this work. 
  

26.3.1 Heap Leach Pad Stability Assessment 
 
The geotechnical stability of the heap leach pads has not been assessed.  It is recommended that 
embankment stability analyses be carried out using a limit equilibrium model such as SLOPE/W.  
Such models utilize systematic algorithms to obtain the minimum factor of safety from a series of 
potential slip surfaces.  The models assess the susceptibility of a given embankment to fail in 
circular, translational or composite slip modes. 
 
The embankments should be analysed under both static and pseudo-static (seismic conditions) to 
ensure that appropriate design factors of safety are achieved by the design. 
 
A minimum factor of safety of 1.3 is recommended for the static case.  The consequences of failure 
of the heap leach pad during an earthquake event are likely to be minimal and restricted to some 
displacement of the heap leach pad slopes.  There should be negligible impact on the integrity of the 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 26-6 January, 2012  

heap leach pad and little, if any, impact on other mine site facilities; however, for the design of the 
heap leach pads a conservative design earthquake such as the 1 in 475 year earthquake event is 
recommended. 
 
The stability of the heap leach pads is likely to be controlled by the interface friction angles between 
the overliner, geomembrane liners and the GCL.  Potential slip surfaces should be assessed and the 
design should have an appropriate factor of safety against this failure mode. 
 
Pad stability during earthquake loading should be assessed by performing a pseudo-static analysis, 
whereby a horizontal force (seismic coefficient) is applied to the embankment to simulate earthquake 
loading to determine the critical acceleration required to reduce the factor of safety to 1.0.  
Deformation of the leach pad may occur if the critical acceleration is lower than the predicted 
average maximum ground acceleration along the potential slope surface from the design earthquake. 
 
Potential deformations under earthquake loading should be estimated using the simplified methods of 
Newmark (1965) and Makdisi-Seed (1977).  These two methods estimate displacement of the 
potential sliding mass based on the average maximum ground acceleration and the yield acceleration.  
The yield acceleration corresponds to the seismic coefficient required to initiate movement of the 
sliding mass.  The yield acceleration may be determined by iterative stability analyses.   
 
The stability of the heap leach facility is very sensitive to the interface shear strengths associated with 
the liner system.  Direct shear testing will be required for future design studies to provide more 
definitive interface friction angles between the various proposed liner surfaces. 
 

26.3.2 Open Pit and Plant Site 
 
Detailed foundation assessments have not been carried out for the pit and plant site areas; however, 
based upon a review of the site, it is unlikely that geotechnical conditions will preclude the 
development of mine site infrastructure. 
 
It is recommended that the following points be assessed; 
 

 Evaluation of the allowable soil bearing pressures induced by plant site facilities for a range 
of different footing shapes and sizes, and consideration of potential settlements 

 Estimation of the allowable bearing pressures of the bedrock 
 Seismic design parameters for the plant site, and 
 Recommendations for the plant site foundation design. 

 
 
26.3.2.1 Other Studies 
 
The following is a list of recommendations for additional site investigations, test work and design 
studies required to carry the project through to final design and construction: 
 

 Geotechnical Investigations and Test work: 
 Test pits in the leach pad area to investigate foundation conditions, overburden materials, and 

depth to bedrock. 
 Drill holes to investigate depth and quality of bedrock, for permeability testing, and for the 

installation of groundwater monitoring wells. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment  Robertson Property 
 
 

Coral Gold Resources Ltd. 26-7 January, 2012  

 Additional test pits to prove suitability, availability and quantity of borrow materials for 
earthworks construction. 

 Additional laboratory index test works (including compaction tests) on potential borrow 
materials. 

 Strength and permeability test work on potential borrow materials for pad foundation and 
embankment construction. 

 Direct shear testing of the geosynthetic liner interfaces, to determine interface friction angles 
for stability assessment. 

 Ore testing (including gradation, leaching moisture content, residual moisture content, 
Altenburg Hill limits, load-permeability, and load-density). 

 

26.3.2.2 Design Studies and Analyses: 
 

 Detailed hydrology studies to predict surface runoff and storm flows. 
 Leach testing to determine optimal ore densities, leaching rates and resulting in-heap 

moisture contents. 
 Detailed water balance analyses, based on results of hydrology and leach testing, to estimate 

solution storage area water volumes, peak storm flows for ditch design, and for the sizing of 
pump and pipework systems. 

 Stability analyses based on results of laboratory strength test work. 
 Seepage analyses to predict seepage flow patterns and solution losses for the design of the 

LDRS. 
 
Detailed design of all civil and mechanical works, including sumps, intakes, outlets, pumps, pipe 
systems etc. 
 

26.3.3 Foundation Design  
 
The foundation recommendations provided are preliminary based on limited and preliminary 
information on site layout and design loads.   
 
It is recommended that footings for critical plant site structures are constructed directly on bedrock or 
otherwise suitable foundation materials.  Bedrock is anticipated at shallow depths of from 5 to 15 feet 
and should provide a solid foundation.  Strip footings at least 3 feet in width are recommended for 
the plant site structures.  They may be designed to impose a maximum pressure of 75 psi on the 
weathered bedrock, with negligible settlements. 
 
Overburden materials should be removed at a 2H:1V slope.  The site should be maintained dry and 
well drained during and after construction activities.  Surface runoff from building roofs and access 
roads, etc., shall be directed away from foundations, and perimeter drains of coarse grained materials 
shall be installed to effectively carry water around the perimeter of the structures to a low sump. 
 
26.4 ENVIRONMENTAL WORK 
 
The proposed environmental work consists the following as shown in Table 26.4.  It is expected 
based upon present legislation to be complete and the project approved in 2017. It may be possible to 
reduce this period and it is recommended that this be reviewed to see if a reduction in the 6 years can 
be reduced.
