As of August 23, 2007, Oro Silver Resources Ltd. has approximately $3,260,000 (in part 
audited) in available funds when combining the proceeds, net of commissions and 
corporate finance fees, of the Arrangement Financing (February 8, 2007), the Oro Silver 
Financing (February 21, 2007) and the Non-Brokered Financing (August 17, 2007).  It is

Payments toward the option to purchase of the El Compas

General and administrative expenses for August 2007 through 
March 2008: 400,000 

Unallocated working capital to fund ongoing operations and 
additional acquisitions: 960,000 
TOTAL:  $3,260,000

Additional funds will be available as a result of the exercise of the remaining Agent's 
Warrants, which will be added to working capital. 

There may be circumstances where, for sound business reasons, a reallocation of funds 
may be necessary. 

Administration:

The Issuer estimates its aggregate monthly administration costs for the next 12 months to 
be $50,000 per month or $600,000 annually.
