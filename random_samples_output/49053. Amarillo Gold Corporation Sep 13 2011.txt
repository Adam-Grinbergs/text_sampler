1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
Hoogvliet Contract Services (HCS) and Australian Exploration Field Services Pty Ltd (AEFS) 
have been retained by Amarillo to undertake a review of the site procedures adopted with 
the latest drill program undertaken at the Posse Deposit near the township of Mara Rosa in 
Goiás State, Brazil. Upon completion of drilling an updated Independent Mineral Resource 
Estimate of the gold mineralisation contained in the Posse Deposit was made.  This report 
details the work carried out with the site visit and subsequent Mineral Resource Estimate in 
accordance with the guidelines set out in NI-43-101, companion policy NI43-101CP and 
Form 43-101F1 
 
The site visit and review of site procedures were carried out in January 2011 by Mr Hoogvliet 
of HCS. The Independent Mineral Resource Estimate was made by Mr Whitehouse of AEFS 
in June 2011. The resource estimate is based on the results of historical drilling and drilling 
conducted by Amarillo between November 2010 and March 2011. The historic data used in 
the resource estimate was detailed in a 43 - 101 compliant report titled Independent Mineral 
Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment, authored by Mr Hoogvliet and 
Mr Whitehouse and dated 30 June 2010 (the 2010 report). 
 
The most recent drilling was designed to provide additional information on the mineralisation 
in order to allow re classification of a substantial portion of the mineralisation contained in 
the optimal pit defined as part of the 2010 report as indicated or measured. 
 
The Posse Deposit is located in Goiás state, central Brazil, approximately 6 km north of the 
town of Mara Rosa. It has a strike length of approximately 1,275m, strike direction of 50° and 
a dip of 40° to 45° to the northwest, terminates at surface and has a true thickness ranging 
from 15 and 30 m. 
 
The property is centred at the approximate WGS84 coordinates 696880 mE, 8454530 mN 
(Zone 22 South).  Presently, Amarillo holds a property position totalling 80,833.9 ha of 
exploration leases and 2,552.62 ha of mining leases as part of the Posse project 
 
The region is characterized by tropical savannah of low to moderate topographic relief 
ranging from approximately 400 m to 500 m above sea level. Much of the area has been 
cleared for farming and as a result is open savannah grassland. 
 
The Mara Rosa District is situated within the Goiás Magmatic Arc ("GMA") which forms part 
of the Tocantins physiographic province, an intercratonic mobile belt that separates the 
Amazonas and São Francisco cratons, located to the northwest and southeast respectively. 
The GMA is a 100 km wide, northeast-trending granite-greenstone terrane that extends 
approximately 700 km. The geology in the Mara Rosa District is principally delineated by 
three northeast-striking, moderately to steeply northwest-dipping belts of metamorphosed 
volcano-sedimentary and associated intrusive rocks. These belts, referred to as the 
Western, Central, and Eastern Belts, are separated by broad zones of tonalitic orthogneiss.

The Eastern Belt is bounded to the southeast by the Rio dos Bois fault, which also defines 
the south eastern limit of the GMA. 
 
Amarillo's land position within the Mara Rosa District primarily covers the Eastern Belt 
greenstone assemblage. The Eastern Belt, which in general strikes to the northeast and dips 
moderately to steeply to the northwest, has a maximum thickness of 6 km. Surface 
topography over the belt is characterized by moderate relief and locally dissected drainages 
that follow lithologic or structural weaknesses. Depth to fresh bedrock is generally shallow, 
ranging from 0 to 15 m. The upper portion of the weathered profile consists of clay-rich 
latosol and saprolite derived from the underlying bedrock. 
 
Several significant mineral deposits occur within 50 km of Mara Rosa including the Posse 
gold deposit, the Zacarias gold-silver deposit and the Chapada copper-gold deposit, in 
addition to numerous historic prospects and garimpos. 
 
Historically Western Mining Corp. ("WMC") operated a small open pit mine at the project site 
during the 1990s. Two pits, Posse South and Posse North, were developed over a 5 year 
period and the ore was processed on-site. As of November, 2006, the mine and mill site had 
been reclaimed and no site infrastructure remained. No significant environmental liabilities 
are known to exist at the former mine site and it is understood that the required remediation 
for mine closure had been met and accepted by the appropriate government agencies 
 
A number of drilling campaigns have been completed on the Property by BHP Billiton from 
1982 until 1987, by WMC from 1988 until 1995, and by Metallica in 2002. In addition Amarillo 
has completed three drilling programs, one in 2005/2006 and another in 2008 and the third 
from October 2010 to March 2011. In all, the drillhole data base contains 277 drill holes for a 
total of 33,600.0 m. 
 
Alteration and mineralization at Posse are characterized by silicification, sericitization, K-
feldspar flooding and pyritization. Carbonatization, usually as ankerite, is present, though 
relatively minor. Pyrite is the dominant sulphide occurring as 1% to 5% finely disseminated 
grains. Accessory metallic minerals (which typically compose less than 1% of the rock) 
include frohbergite (iron telluride), chalcopyrite, molybdenite and sphalerite. Gold occurs as 
10 to 100 micron-sized native grains along the margins of silicates and in association with 
pyrite and frohbergite. In general, gold grade tends to show an overall positive correlation 
with intensity of silicification and total sulphide content. 
 
Since Amarillo has controlled the project several Mineral Resource Estimates have been 
made.  This report supersedes all previous resource estimates. The updated Independent 
Mineral Resource Estimate presented herein is based upon: 
 

 previously compiled historic data 

 New drill data 

 Updated topography 

 The use of three mineralised domains: HW (Hanging Wall), MAIN (MAIN) 
and FW (Footwall) through the use of three sets of wire frames. 

 a revised estimation methodology; and,

 Re-classification of the Estimate. 
 
The Mineral Resource Estimate, summarized below in Table 1.1, was estimated utilizing the 
Median Indicator Kriging method, without top cutting of gold grades. Blocks were classified 
as Measured, Indicated or Inferred based on data density defined via a long section in the 
plane of the vein (i.e. pierce point density).

AEFS/HCS 2011 Inferred 3,630,000 1.34 156,400 

 
 
The Posse deposit has a geometry which presents the potential for an attractive open pit 
scenario, as approximately 70% of the tonnage lies within 200 m of surface. There is also 
the opportunity to expand this Mineral Resource with further exploration work. 
 
No economic assessment of the resource has been made as part of this Technical Report. 
This will be carried out as part of the Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) currently underway. The 
PFS is expected to be finished by the end of Q4 2011 generally in line with the timetable 
outlined in the 2010 Report. HCS and AEFS have reviewed Amarillo's proposed exploration 
program for Mara Rosa and believe the concept is properly conceived and justified. 
 
The opinion of HCS and AEFS is that the character of the Mara Rosa Property, the 
Posse deposit and the Mineral Resource Estimate reported herein is such that work to 
take the Posse Resource through Pre-Feasibility and on to Bankable Feasibility is 
recommended together with ongoing exploration on the Property. 
 
The following draft budget is appropriate to achieve the company's aims.

HCS and AEFS have recommended the following actions by Amarillo to help achieve the 
company's aim of developing the Mara Rosa project. 
 

Obtain where possible, independent down hole survey data on the MRP series 
holes completed in 2011. 
 
Ensure that any future drilling programs maintain sample QAQC charts and 
update them with each batch of samples received from the laboratory. 
 
Establish and document a clear procedure for rejecting assay results when 
QAQC results indicate a sample batch that is either suspect or out of (QAQC) 
control. 
 
Establish up to date density measurements for Waste, Hanging Wall, Main and 
Foot Wall Zones. It is understood that several hundred samples have been 
dispatched to SGS Laboratories in Belo Horizonte for density measurement. 
 
Incorporate the density determinations currently being obtained through a 
commercial laboratory into the next resource estimate 
 
Store all exploration data in a proper data base to ensure its integrity for the long 
term 
 
Compile all historic lithology data into a comprehensive and consistent data 
base, carry out field checking on drill core, and create lithology wireframes where 
appropriate. 
 
Separately model the suspected basalt dyke that may cut through the ore body, 
or at least assess its potential to reduce or offset the mineral resource. 
 
Carry out a systematic check of all historic drill data that was not part of the 2008 
review (the "accepted" data) which, together with the results of the 2010 – 2011 
drilling was used as the base data for the current resource estimate. 
 
Follow up the magnetic susceptibility data and review if it will assist the 
interpretation. If the answer is affirmative, possibly collect magnetic susceptibility 
data on historic drill holes.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

 
 

2.1  Introduction 

 
Hugo Hoogvliet of Hoogvliet Contract Services (HCS), and Keith Whitehouse of Australian 
Exploration Field Services Pty Ltd (AEFS) have been retained by Amarillo Gold Corp. 
("Amarillo") to conduct a review of site procedures associated with the 2010 - 2011 drilling 
program together with an Independent Mineral Resource Estimate of the gold mineralisation 
("the Resource Estimate" or "Estimate") contained in the Posse Deposit ("the Deposit"), and 
to produce a supporting technical document in accordance with the guidelines set out in NI-
43-101, companion policy NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. 
 
The Posse Deposit is located near the town of Mara Rosa which is approximately 360 road 
kilometres northwest of Goiânia, the state capital of Goiás, Brazil. The Posse gold deposit is 
the main deposit along the Posse trend, which also includes several artisanal mining areas 
(garimpos) and geochemical/geophysical anomalies. The Posse deposit is approximately 6 
km north of the Mara Rosa. The property is located in rolling hilly ranch land with numerous 
country roads and farm tracks allowing access, and reasonable infrastructure in the nearby 
town. 
 
Through the acquisition of Metallica Brasil Ltda. ("MBL", the Brazilian subsidiary of 
Metallica), from De Re Holdings, Amarillo has acquired a 100% interest in the Mara Rosa 
project, subject to a 1.0% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalty payable to Franco Nevada and 
a further 1.0% NSR royalty payable to Royal Gold, as well as any mineral royalties due to 
the state and federal governments of Brazil. 
 
Hugo Hoogvliet has visited the Mara Rosa offices of Amarillo, the Posse mine site, the 
former mine offices and core storage facilities on several occasions, most recently from  24 
January 2011 to 31 January 2011. At the time of the visit holes MRP0033, MRP0034 and 
MRP0035 were being drilled. At the time of the visits a well-run team of geologists, field 
technicians and a supervisor was active. 
 
 

2.2  Units 

 
The Metric System is the primary system of measure and length used in this Report and is 
generally expressed in kilometres, metres and centimetres; volume is expressed as cubic 
metres, mass expressed as metric tonnes, area as hectares, and gold grades as grams per 
tonne. Conversions from the Metric System to the Imperial System are provided below and 
quoted where practical. Many of the geologic publications and more recent documents now 
use the Metric System but older documents almost exclusively refer to the Imperial System. 
Metals and minerals acronyms in this report conform to mineral industry accepted usage and

the reader is directed to the online Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms located 
at www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/index.html for a glossary. 
 

Conversion factors utilized in this report may include: 
1 troy ounce/ton = 34.285714 grams/tonne 
1 gram/tonne = 0.029167 troy ounces/ton 
1 troy ounce = 31.103477 grams 
1 gram = 0.032151 troy ounces 
 

The term gram/tonne or g/t is expressed as "gram per tonne" where 1 gram/tonne = 1 ppm 
(part per million) = 1000 ppb (parts per billion). The mineral industry accepted terms Au g/t 
and g/t Au are substituted for "grams gold per metric tonne" or "g Au/t". Other abbreviations 
include ppb = parts per billion; ppm = parts per million; oz/st = troy ounce per short ton; Moz 
= million ounces; Mt = million tonne; t = tonne (1000 kilograms); SG = specific gravity; lb/t = 
pound/ton; and, st = short ton (2000 pounds). 
 
Dollars, $ and Dollar values refer to United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted. 
Gold prices are stated in US$ per troy ounce (USD/oz). 
 
In this report, coordinates where quoted are UTM Zone 22 South projected coordinates 
based on the WGS84 Datum (WGS84) unless otherwise noted.  The WGS84 datum is 
functionally equivalent to the SIRGAS2000 datum which is the legal standard for reporting 
coordinates in Brazil from 2014 onwards. Note that the 2010 report by HCS and AEFS used 
the SAD69 datum for reporting coordinates. In the Posse area coordinates in SAD69 can be 
converted to coordinates in WGS84 by subtracting 43.57m from the Easting and subtracting 
43.04m from the Northing. The decision to use WGS84 coordinates for future work was 
made between the end of drilling and the determination of the mineral resource estimate.  
This means that work such as drill hole planning and the initial measure of drillhole locations 
was carried out using the SAD69 Datum.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 
4.1 General Description 
The Mara Rosa Property (also generally known and referred to as the Posse Deposit) is 
located in Goiás state, central Brazil, approximately 6 km north of the town of Mara Rosa.

The property is centred at the approximate UTM coordinates 696880 mE, 8454530 mN 
(Figure 4.1). 
 
Western Mining Corp. ("WMC") operated a small open pit mine at the project site during the 
1990s. Two pits, Posse South and Posse North, were developed over a five year period. The 
ore, along with feed from the nearby Zacarias mine, was processed on-site. The processing, 
beginning with heap leach and later CIL, was conducted on approximately 10 ha of freehold 
property adjacent to the mining leases. Local infrastructure included adequate power and 
water to run a 600 tonne per day CIL plant and heap leach operation. 
 
As of November, 2006, the mine and mill site had been reclaimed and no site infrastructure 
remained. According to Amarillo, the required remediation for mine closure had been met 
and accepted by the relevant government agencies. No significant environmental liabilities 
are known to exist at the former mine site. 
 
WMC maintained a core logging and storage facility, sample preparation laboratory, assay 
laboratory, and office complex immediately north of the town of Mara Rosa. The facilities, 
which occupy 10 ha of freehold land, have been utilized by Amarillo during their exploration 
programs. As of January 2011 when Mr Hoogvliet visited the project, the structures remain in 
excellent condition. The offices were utilized by Mr Hoogvliet during his site visit and Amarillo 
staff during the drilling program which finished in March 2011; Amarillo also owns two 
houses on contiguous pieces of land on São Paolo Street within the town of Mara Rosa.  
 
4.2 Establishing Mineral Rights in Brazil 
 
The process of acquiring title to mineral property in Brazil is a phased procedure involving 
progressive categories of title as exploration and development work on a property advances. 
Tenure is secure provided the title holder meets clearly defined obligations over time, but the 
process of acquiring title can be lengthy. 
 
Initially, an application for an exploration permit must be filed which meets specific regulatory 
requirements and must include a description of the proposed exploration plan. A 60-day 
period after filing is provided for the applicant to supply any additional information that may 
be required. Then, if the applicant has met all requirements and if the area of interest is not 
already covered by a pre-existing application or an existing exploration license, Exploration 
licenses are issued by the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM; the 
National Department of Mineral Production), the Brazilian government mining agency.

Initially, an application for an exploration permit must be filed which meets specific regulatory 
requirements and must include a description of the proposed exploration plan. A 60-day 
period after filing is provided for the applicant to supply any additional information that may 
be required. Then, if the applicant has met all requirements and if the area of interest is not 
already covered by a pre-existing application or an existing exploration license, Exploration 
licenses are issued by the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM; the 
National Department of Mineral Production), the Brazilian government mining agency. 
 
Exploration licenses are granted for a period of three years, and are renewable upon request 
for a further period of three years and are subject to a nominal charge per hectare. 
Exploration must begin within 60 days following issuing of the license, and must be carried 
out according to the exploration plan. At the discretion of the DNPM, exploration licenses 
may be terminated if exploration activities are suspended for more than three years. An 
applicant may reapply for a terminated license at the end of the three-year license period. 
The reapplication must include a new exploration plan and the re-issued license is subject to 
an increased annual fee. 
 
Mining licenses are only granted to corporations. Normally, applicants have a period of one 
year, following DNPM approval of the final exploration report, on an exploration licence, to 
present a mining plan and a feasibility study, and to apply for a mining license. No fees are 
levied on the holder of a mining license and a mining license does not convey title to a 
mineral deposit which remains vested in the government. Rather, a mining license gives to 
the holder the right to extract, process, and sell minerals from the deposit, in accordance 
with a plan approved by the DNPM, until the deposit is exhausted. 
 
Presently, Amarillo holds a property position totalling 80,833.9 ha of exploration leases and 
2,552.62 ha of mining leases centred over the Posse gold mine (Figure 4.2). The mining 
leases have been surveyed as required by Brazilian mining law; however, the exploration 
leases have not as they are recorded on a graticular system. The list of mining claims over 
and around the Posse deposit, as registered with DNPM on 26/1/2011, is presented in Table 
4.1. 
 
While the granting of an exploration concession gives Amarillo the required permits for 
conducting exploration activities on the property very limited work is currently being carried 
out on the exploration concessions, as all of the company's resources are dedicated towards 
a production decision on Posse. The company is negotiating with the DNPM in good faith to 
retain the exploration leases that are up for renewal on the basis that its resources are 
committed to the task of establishing a mine at Posse. Once the decision on Posse has been 
made, the focus will return to the regional work.

As the Posse mine is no longer in production, the mining concessions have been registered 
as under "Mining Suspension", a status allowing them to be held without production 
occurring. This status is due to expire in August 2011. Amarillo has presented updated 
information on the mining leases to the DNPM in order to extend the current "Mining 
Suspension" while the project proceeds through Pre-Feasibility and Feasibility study status 
at which time a decision to mine can be made. 
 
In the opinion of HCS and AEFS Amarillo have the tenements under suitable tenure to 
enable the future development of the Mara Rosa project. 
 
 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
The Municipality of Mara Rosa is located 356 km north of Goiânia in the Porangatu 
Microregion, 11 km west of the Belém-Brasília highway, between the basins of the Araguaia 
River and the Tocantins River. According to a 2005 estimate, Mara Rosa has a population of 
approximately 25,000 people of whom 11,500 live in the town. Local facilities include several 
public and private elementary and high schools, two hospitals, a public health centre, one 
bank, two small motels and numerous shops. Agriculture (corn, rice, manioc, sugarcane, 
soybeans, and bananas) and cattle ranching are the primary commercial activities in the 
region; Mara Rosa is a regional support community for these activities. The municipality has 
an excellent network of local farm roads, the majority of which are unpaved but in generally 
good condition. The municipality is also serviced by an 800 metre-long, unpaved airstrip. 
Access to Mara Rosa is via Federal Highway BR-153, the main north-south highway in

central Brazil leading to the city of Belém at the mouth of the Tocantins River. Mara Rosa is 
356 km, or 4 hours driving time, north from the state capital of Goiânia, and 320 km, or 4 
hours driving time from the national capital, Brasilia. Highway communications (Figure 5.1) 
with Goiânia are made by GO-080 / Nerópolis / São Francisco de Goiás / BR-153 / Jaraguá / 
GO-080 / Goianésia / Barro Alto / GO-342 / BR-153 / Uruaçu / Campinorte / GO-239. 
 
Electric power is supplied by CELG, the State of Goiás Energy Authority. The local electricity 
grid has an installed capacity of 34.5 megawatts. The water supply is metered and is 
provided by SANEAGO, the state water company. Water for the Posse mine site as well as 
ranches in the surrounding region is derived from a combination of local streams and 
artesian wells. Telephone service, both local and international, is provided by TELEGOIAS. 
Cellular telephone service is available in the area. 
 
The region is characterized by tropical savannah of low to moderate topographic relief 
ranging from approximately 400 m to 500 m above sea level (ASL). The town itself has a 
mean elevation of 520 m ASL. Much of the area has been cleared for farming and as a result 
is open savannah grassland. Trees occur along the abundant water courses.

6.0 PROPERTY HISTORY 

 
This section summarises the work carried out prior to the 2010 - 2011 drilling campaign. The 
work carried out from 2010 is discussed in Section Error! Reference source not found.. 
 
Evidence of small scale surficial-alluvial mining along the Rio do Ouro in the historic Amaro 
Leite area indicates mining activity in the Mara Rosa District dates to the mid-1700s. More 
recent activity dating from the early 1970s to early 1980s began with the successful 
discoveries by INCO (now Vale S.A. or "Vale") of the Chapada gold-copper and Crixás gold 
deposits. These deposits are located approximately 30 km and 100 km to the south-west of 
the town of Mara Rosa, respectively (Figure 8-1). 
 
During the early 1980s, BHP-Utah Mines (now BHP Billiton Limited), through its subsidiary 
Mineração Colorado Ltda., initiated a grass roots reconnaissance program that covered the 
Chapada district and the Mara Rosa area, and eventually led to the discovery of the Posse 
gold and Zacarias gold-silver-barite deposits. From 1981 to 1987, BHP completed 12,300 m 
of diamond and reverse circulation (RC) drilling at Posse and Zacarias. At Posse, a 107 m 
exploration shaft was sunk and 400 m of lateral drifting was completed to test mineralization. 
 
As a result of Brazilian restrictions on foreign ownership at the time, BHP chose to joint 
venture the Mara Rosa properties with Western Mining Corp. in 1988. In 1990, WMC set up 
a subsidiary, Mineração Jenipapo S.A. ("MJSA"), to acquire a 100% interest in Posse, and to 
explore, develop, and operate the asset. The Posse mine was opened in 1992 and operated 
until July, 1995 during which time two pits, Posse North and Posse South, were developed. 
The on-site mill processed approximately 750,000 tonnes of ore grading a combined 3.5 g/t 
Au. Zacarias, which was significantly higher grade, operated at roughly the same time as 
Posse and was processed through the same mill. 
 
In order to provide cash flow for its activities in Brazil, WMC focussed much of its attention 
on development of the Posse and Zacarias mines between 1990 and 1995. This work is 
understood to have been completed as a result of a corporate decision to make each 
business unit self-funding and to encourage efforts to develop known deposits. In addition, 
efforts to replace mined reserves were directed toward both the Eastern and Central Belt 
exploration targets generated previously by BHP as well as new targets identified to the east 
and north of Mara Rosa. 
 
By June 1995, a combination of factors, including low gold prices, the exhaustion of reserves 
at the higher grade Zacarias deposit, and the failure to discover any additional, near-surface 
reserves, caused WMC to discontinue mining and exploration activities at Mara Rosa. As the 
primary exploration objective had been the discovery of near-surface mineralization that 
could be fast-tracked into production, most of the exploration targets identified by BHP and 
WMC had only been evaluated to depths within, approximately, 50 m from the surface. 
 
Upon suspension of its mining and exploration activities, WMC was approached by several 
companies interested in exploring the property under lease-option agreements. The Zacarias

deposit and the rights to its tailings were eventually sold to Minere Mineração Ltda. 
("Minere"), a small Brazilian company interested in exploiting the deposit's very high barite 
content.  The project has since been on-sold to a company called Baribras Mineração Ltda. 
 
In 1996, Barrick do Brasil ("Barrick") completed a full due diligence study of the remaining 
Posse project concessions (the Eastern Belt claims). The due diligence involved a team of at 
least 14 people and a significant program of test sampling, re-logging of core, soil sampling, 
reinterpretation of geophysics, and an estimate of the mineral resource for the Posse 
deposit. Although this program subsequently led to a preliminary offer by Barrick to purchase 
the property in full, negotiations stalled prior to execution of the agreement. Barrick provided 
WMC with a copy of its due diligence report and related correspondence after the failure to 
execute a deal. 
 
Following Barrick's withdrawal, Metallica entered into negotiations with WMC for purchase of 
the Eastern Belt properties, and in November, 1997, successfully completed an agreement 
which called for a total purchase price of US$1.5 million. As part of the previous buy-out 
agreement between BHP and WMC, BHP held a 1% NSR royalty interest on the property. 
This now sits with Royal Gold and as a part of the Metallica purchase Euro-Nevada Gold 
Corporation (later absorbed into Newmont) held an additional 1% NSR royalty. This now sits 
with Franco Nevada Corporation. 
 
Following a compilation of data and a review of the project, Metallica completed a systematic 
soil geochemistry and geological mapping program north-east of the Posse deposit. Induced 
Polarization (IP) and ground magnetic geophysical surveys were completed over some of 
the more promising areas. Metallica suspended exploration operations in September, 1998, 
and placed the project on care and maintenance. In 2001, Metallica revisited the project and 
completed a review of the regional potential. At this time, 5 holes, totalling 940 m, were 
drilled into three separate targets on the northern extensions to the Posse mine trend. 
Following this work, a corporate decision was made to focus on properties in Mexico and 
Chile and Metallica decided to sell the project. 
 
Amarillo Gold Corporation (Amarillo) visited the project in August, 2003 and in October, 2003 
signed a letter of intent with Metallica to purchase MBL and 100% of the Mara Rosa project. 
The project remains subject to the 1.0% NSR royalty to Franco Nevada Corporation and a 
further 1.0% royalty to Royal Gold. 
 
 

6.1  Exploration History 

 
BHP held the Property from 1982 until 1987; WMC from 1988 until 1997; and Metallica from 
1997 to 2003. The site has been controlled by Amarillo since then. The following is a 
summary of work known to have been completed on the Property prior to the release of this 
NI43-101 Technical Report, dated July 2011 for the property: 
 

 244 exploration drill holes totalling approximately 25,070.7 metres (HCS 
& AEFS 2010), these are further discussed in 6.4 below;

 4,011 blast holes with corresponding assay data for 6,598 samples 
(Hoogvliet, 2008); these holes were drilled as part of the WMC mining 
operation on the Posse North and South Pits. 

 307.5 metres of underground sampling recorded as 10 horizontal 
drillholes; 

 278 metres of surface channel sampling; 

 Geochemical sample data, Metallica verification sampling program, 2,947 
samples; 

 Multi-element lithogeochemical data (575 Posse core samples and 31 
regional samples); 

 3D geological model and drill section plots used for the 1997 Posse 
resource estimate; 

 3D geological model and drill section plots used for the 2008 Posse 
resource estimate by CCIC; 

 3D geological model and drill section plots used for the 2010 Posse 
resource estimate by HCS & AEFS; 

 Posse pit geology map at 1:50 scale (Metallica mapping, AutoCAD file); 

 North Posse trend district geologic map at 1:5,000 scale (Metallica 
mapping, AutoCAD file); 

 Eastern Belt regional geologic map compiled at 1:10,000 scale (Metallica 
and BHP mapping, AutoCAD file); 

 Grid E ground magnetics data, unedited BHP data (Excel spreadsheet). 
 
In addition, a total of thirty detailed geologic and alteration sections were constructed by 
Metallica for the Posse Deposit, these remain to be digitized into the project database but 
will be superseded by work currently being undertaken by Amarillo to update formal 
geological cross sections 
 

6.2  Metallica Exploration 

 
Metallica held the Mara Rosa project from 1997 until 2003. Between July 1997 and January 
1999, Metallica focussed on the development of a detailed geologic model for the Posse 
deposit, and on the verification and improvement of exploration targets along its general 
strike extensions. No drilling was completed by Metallica during this time. Exploration work 
completed by Metallica included the following: 
 

 Digital compilation of geological, geochemical, and geophysical 
information from the project data files; 

 Geological mapping and structural analysis of Posse pit and re-logging of 
approximately 8,100 m of Posse drill core; 

 Systematic lithogeochemical sampling through the Posse deposit and 
Eastern Belt stratigraphic sequence; 

 Geological mapping (1:5,000 scale) and soil sampling along 
approximately 23 km of Eastern Belt/Posse strike extensions;

 Completion of detailed IP-resistivity and ground magnetics surveys over 
Posse and its strike extensions; 

 Regional reconnaissance of the Far Eastern, Central, and Western Belt 
areas. 

 
In January, 1999, due to the bear market in gold and Metallica's corporate decision to focus 
on other projects in Chile and Mexico, the Posse Deposit was placed on care and 
maintenance. A soil sampling campaign was completed in 2001. In late 2002, with the 
improving gold price,  5 holes drill program was completed on three separate targets along 
the northern strike extent of the Posse deposit. Following this work, and the completion of a 
resource estimate of the Posse Deposit, Metallica decided to sell the Mara Rosa project. 
 
 

6.3  Amarillo Exploration 

 
Amarillo Gold Corporation first visited the Mara Rosa project in August, 2003 and 
subsequently signed a letter of intent with Metallica to purchase MBL and 100% of the Mara 
Rosa project in October, 2003. Micon International Ltd. was retained by Amarillo to review 
the Property in late 2003. And B. Terrence Hennessey visited the Property November 14

Gold Project, Goias State, Brazil (summary published on www.sedar.com January 13
th
, 2004 

as part of the Amarillo 2003 annual report). 
 
In 2005 further work was undertaken to verify the location of previous drilling and generate a 
volume of waste dumps. This was followed, in 2006, by a trenching program of 28 trenches 
totalling 2,942 m to verify previous soil sampling. Results from the trenching program were 
used to sight some of a series of 28 diamond holes (SPETI-01 to SPETI-28).  The SPETI 
drill program ran from 1 December 2005 until 26 September 2006. Results from the SPETI 
program together with data extracted from the historical drilling database were used by CCIC 
to generate a Resource Estimate. An updated Resource Estimate for the property together 
with a Preliminary Economic Assessment was contained in an NI43-101 Technical Report 
dated 29 February 2008 (published on www.sedar.com 26 March 2008). Further work was 
undertaken in 2008. This consisted of 15 diamond drillholes totalling 3,429 m. This program 
was interrupted by the GFC. At the same time a recompilation of the geological database 
was undertaken by HCS. This (recompiled) database was used as the data source for the 
updated resource estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment contained in a NI43-101 
Technical Report dated 30 June 2010 (published on July 12, 2010 at www.sedar.com. 
 
 

6.3.1  Validation of Drill Hole Locations 

 
In 2005, Kevin R. Kivi, P. Geo, acting as consultant to Amarillo recommended that an 
accurate GPS survey of historical survey locations be undertaken to allow all data to be 
recorded in UTM coordinates based on the WGS84 Datum as previous drilling had been tied 
to survey monuments located in terms of local grids. Subsequently GLOBAL Informática e

Consultoria was contracted by Amarillo to complete a differential GPS survey of available 
landmarks on the Property and UTM coordinates based on the WGS84 datum were 
established for most historical drill collars. 
 
 

6.3.2   Waste Dump Volume 

 
As a part of the work carried out by GLOBAL Informática e Consultoria, 3,275 survey points 
were taken on the waste pile in order to provide data for a volumetric calculation.  This data 
was utilised by CCIC to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the waste pile and the 
volume of this DEM was estimated to be 321,800 m3. 
 
 

6.3.3   Surface Trenching 

 
During 2006, Amarillo excavated 28 trenches generally between 2 m and 3 m in depth for a 
cumulative length of 2,942 m. The purpose of the trenching was to evaluate the better 
geochemical anomalies identified by Metallica's extensive soil sampling program. Following 
systematic 1:100 scale mapping and logging of each trench samples were collected along 
the length of the trenches at 2.5 m intervals. 
 
The degree of metamorphism and weathering was reported to present a significant 
challenge to identifying lithology however some features such as quartz veining, pegmatites 
and dolerite dykes were readily identifiable in the trenches. 
 
The gold values reported by Metallica in the soils were generally confirmed, but the values 
returned from analysis of the trenched, weathered rock were often no higher than the values 
in soils. 
 
 

6.4  Historical Drilling 

 
A number of drilling campaigns have been completed on the Mara Rosa tenements. These 
have been carried out by: 
 

BHP from 1982 until 1987, 
WMC from 1988 until 1995, 
Metallica in 2002 
Amarillo in late 2005 and 2006 
Amarillo in 2008 

 
In all, 233 drill holes were completed by BHP and WMC for a total of 19,876.7 m between 
1982 and 1995 (Hennessey, 2003). The drilling concentrated on the Posse deposit.  
Subsequently Metallica drilled five drill holes and Amarillo a further 42 drill holes.

BHP conducted two main campaigns of drilling. An initial round of percussion drilling (hole 
numbers beginning with W prefix), followed by a second round of diamond drill core holes. 
The percussion drill holes largely targeted potential for a shallow oxide resource and were 
drilled on a 50 m by 50 m grid. The diamond drill holes targeted potential for a deeper 
sulphide resource and were also drilled on a 50 m by 50 m grid mainly over the Posse 
deposit to a depth of 350 m. At the periphery of mineralization, drill hole spacing was 
widened in multiples of 50 m. 
 
Following this work, WMC completed 107 reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drill holes 
which mostly targeted the Posse deposit. The RC drill holes were shallow and drilled on a 25 
m by 25 m grid pattern. The diamond drill holes were deeper and followed on from the BHP 
drilling of the sulphide resource.  
 
The completed drilling was utilized to estimate the ore reserves mined from the Posse North 
and South pits as well as the remaining historical mineral reserves and / or resources 
previously reported by WMC, Barrick, and Metallica. Although both WMC and BHP 
completed some shallow percussion style drilling on a few exploration targets, minimal 
drilling was completed distal of the main Posse deposit area. 
 
In November 2002 Metallica completed five diamond drill holes totalling 940 m on three 
separate targets along the Posse trend. The targets tested were an inferred structural plunge 
projection of the Posse North lode and two geochemical-geophysical anomalies located 
along strike from the Pose deposit.  
 
Between December 1

st
, 2005 and September 27

th
, 2006, Amarillo completed a diamond 

drilling campaign that totalled 3,509.8 m in 28 holes (SPETI-01 to SPETI-28). This drilling 
was completed utilizing a MACH FS 320 (serial number 922) drill rig constructed by 
Maquesonda of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in April, 2005. The objective of Amarillo's drill 
campaign was to confirm and expand known limits of gold mineralization within the Posse 
Deposit, as well as to test previously unevaluated exploration targets identified by 
predecessors. Drill targeting was based on previous data and results from 26 trenches 
completed by Amarillo in 2005. 
 
The drill holes were sunk through the saproltic overburden into fresh bedrock using HWL 
casing; followed by NQ diameter core (47.6 mm) to total depth. Fresh bedrock was generally 
intersected at a true depth of 5 m to 15 m. Each run of the MACH FS 320 is approximately 
3 m and the average core recovery in each hole was reported to range from 70% to 80%. 
 
The drilling outlined above was used for the Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic 
Assessment contained in the NI43-101 Technical Report dated 29 February 2008 prepared 
by CCIC. 
 
In 2008 Amarillo conducted a further diamond drilling campaign commencing May 21 2008 
and finishing October 16, 2008, 15 holes totalling 3,428.7m were drilled. Hole_ID's were 
W002A and MRP0001 to MRP0014 and the drilling was completed by Brazilian company

The drillhole data included in the Posse database at the end of 2009, which was used for the 
2010 resource estimation, was composed of the following holes.

Total 244 holes 25,075.7 

 
There is a discrepancy between the number of exploration holes reported as drilled and the 
number of holes in the assay database for Posse. The discrepancies are in holes related to 
Amarillo drilling as the exploration holes summarized above include holes drilled outside the 
area covered by the Posse dataset.  In addition it would appear that the Metallica holes have 
been renumbered and now appear in the Posse database as being WMC holes.  It is 
recommended that further work be done to reconcile these differences; however it is the 
opinion of HCS and AEFS that the issue does not pose a material threat to the integrity of 
the Posse database or the Resource reported in this technical report. 
 
 

6.5  Historical Resource Estimates 

 
Five mineral resource estimates have been prepared for the Posse deposit subsequent to 
mine closure. These are set out in Table 6.2 below.

6.5.1  WMC Grade Tonnage Estimate 

 
According to the Barrick due diligence documentation, WMC reported, at the time of mine 
closure, a remaining open-pittable reserve of 1,163,433 tonnes grading 2.08 g/t Au (Table 6-
3). This "reserve" was reported at a cut-off grade of 0.6 g/t Au and a stripping ratio of 2.3:1; 
no reference to categorization was given. This reserve was limited to 100 m below the 
surface. WMC documentation pertaining to this estimate has not been viewed by the 
authors.

6.5.2  Barrack Grade Tonnage Estimate 

 
As part of its due diligence, when Barrack was considering purchase of the property, Barrick 
arranged for the completion of a mineral resource estimate for Posse South after 
confirmation of the geological model by the due diligence team. The estimate was completed 
by Pedro Guzman of PGV Consultores in Chile. Barrick's resource was reported at a cut-off 
grade of 1.0g/t Au and to a depth of 300 m below surface. The result of the mineral resource 
estimate, estimated by Ordinary Kriging, was 15,468,300 tonnes grading 1.47 g/t Au (Table 
6-4). No confidence categories were assigned to the estimate

6.5.3  Metallica Grade Tonnage Estimate 

 
In late 1997, Metallica estimated a mineral resource for Posse South after re-logging 
approximately 8,100m of core and remapping exposures in the pit. Shallow reverse 
circulation and blast holes from the pit were also used. The estimate was completed using 
Ordinary Kriging, a 10.0 g/t Au top cut, and a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t Au. Metallica's resource

6.5.4  Amarillo; CCIC Resource Estimate 

 
CCIC was retained by Amarillo to complete an Independent Mineral Resource Estimate and 
Preliminary Economic Assessment of the gold resources located on the Mara Rosa 
Property, and to produce a supporting Technical Report in accordance with the guidelines 
set out in NI-43-101, companion policy NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. CCIC completed 
an initial assessment of an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate in March 2007 and an 
updated mineral resource estimate together with a preliminary economic assessment was 
published in February 2008. 
 
This mineral resource estimate (Table 6.6) was assessed using Ordinary Kriging, with a 
70 m x 50 m search ellipse and top cutting of gold grades at 30 g/t Au.

Inferred 13,326,000 1.26  538,000 

 
In addition to the resource estimate CCIC completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment of 
the Posse deposit based on the results of a Lerch-Grossman pit optimization carried out 
using Gemcom's Whittle software based on a base gold price of $800/oz Au ($25.72/g Au). 
Other optimization parameters for the base scenario include: 
 

Reference mining cost : $1.50/t 
Mining Recovery Fraction : 97.5% 
Mining Dilution Fraction : 2.5% 
Processing Cost : $7.50/t milled 
CIL Recovery Fraction : 0.80 
Selling Cost : 4% 
Discount Rate : 5% 
Processing Limit : 2 Mtpa 
Initial Capital Cost : $80 Million

With the parameters utilized in the CCIC PEA, the break-even gold price for the project was 
approximately $575/oz. At higher gold prices, the project value increased significantly. At 
$600, the project returned approximately $12 Million. At $900 (then market conditions), the 
project returns approximately $153 Million. At $1,500, the project returns approximately $485 
Million. 
 
 

6.5.5  Amarillo; HCS & AEFS Resource Estimate 2010 

 
In 2010 HCS and AEFS were retained by Amarillo to produce a Resource Estimate and 
Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Posse deposit.  The work was the subject of an 
NI43 - 101 technical report published on SEDAR July 12 2010.  The resource model was 
constructed using Median Indicator Kriging with a 70 m x 35 m x 7 m primary search 
ellipsoid to populate a 25 m x 25 m x 10 m block model.  Blocks were allowed to be sub-
blocked to 5 m X 5 m X 5 m to fit the constraining mineralisation wireframes. At a 0.5 g/t cut-
off the resource was as shown in table 6.7 below.

  Inferred 10,164,000 1.38 451,000 

 
In addition to the Resource Estimate a Preliminary Economic Assessment was made based 
on the results of a Lerch-Grossman pit optimization carried out using Micromine software 
based on a gold price of $1,000/oz Au ($32.15/g Au). Other optimization parameters for the 
base scenario include: 
 

 Reference mining cost: $1.38/t 

 Mining Recovery Fraction: 97.5% 

 Mining Dilution Fraction: 2.5% 

 Processing Cost: $8.05/t milled 

 Metallurgical Recovery Fraction: 0.80 

 Selling Cost: 3% + $10 = 4% at $1000 

 Discount Rate: 5% 

 Rock Density: 2.73 

 Pit Slope: 55 degrees 

 Processing Limit: 2 Mtpa 

 Initial Capital Cost: $88.5 Million with a further $11.5 Million spent in year 
3 to upgrade mining fleet 

 Sensitivity work assumed a single capital cost of $90 Million. 
 
The breakeven gold price was approximately $475 per Oz with an optimal pit taken to be the 
"$850" pit shell reached after 12 years of mining. This pit shell has an NPV of USD197m and 
would see a recovery of 800,000 oz of gold at a price of $1,000/oz Au.

6.6  Historical Production 

 
The Posse mill and leach pads processed ore from two deposits, Zacarias and Posse, 
between 1992 and 1995. Until the end of June, 1995 production from the Posse North and 
South pits totalled approximately 388,000 tonnes (Table 6-8). Mining continued for six days 
into July, 1995, however, records for this final part month of production have not been 
located.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 
 

7.1  Regional Geology 

 
The Mara Rosa District is situated within the Goiás Magmatic Arc (GMA) which forms part of 
the Tocantins physiographic province, an intercratonic mobile belt that separates the 
Amazonas and São Francisco cratons, located to the north-west and south-east respectively 
(Figure 7.1). The GMA is a 100km wide, northeast-trending granite-greenstone terrane that 
extends approximately 700 km. It is composed of accreted Middle to Neoproterozoic 
volcano-sedimentary island arc sequences that have been intruded by granitoid and mafic 
plutons (Kuyumjian, 1998). Subsequent metamorphism of these units has resulted in their 
recrystallization between upper greenschist and epidote-amphibolite facies. 
 
The geology in the Mara Rosa District is principally delineated by three northeast-striking, 
moderately to steeply northwest-dipping belts of metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary and 
associated intrusive rocks. These belts, referred to as the Western, Central, and Eastern 
Belts (Figure 7.2), are separated by broad zones of tonalitic orthogneiss. The Eastern Belt is 
bounded to the southeast by the Rio dos Bois fault, which also defines the south-eastern 
limit of the GMA. The Rio dos Bois fault is a major regional fault that has thrust 
Neoproterozoic rocks of the GMA over older, Early to Middle-Proterozoic rocks of the Central 
Goiás Massif positioned to the south and east. Structures within the upper plate of the Rio 
dos Bois fault (i.e. the Central-Eastern shear zone) are understood to be the principal control 
for mineralization in the Mara Rosa region. 
 
 
Several significant mineral deposits occur in the Mara Rosa District. These include the 
Posse gold deposit, the Zacarias gold-silver-barite deposit, and the Chapada copper-gold

deposit. A relatively widespread distribution of potential gold, copper, and silver 
mineralization is suggested by the numerous historic prospects (garimpos) that are 
dispersed in the regions between these deposits. The Crixás gold district, located 
approximately 100 km to the south-west of Mara Rosa, lies immediately outside the mapped 
limits of the GMA.

7.2  District Geology 

 
Amarillo's land position within the Mara Rosa District primarily covers the Eastern Belt 
greenstone assemblage (Figure 7.2). As a result of WMC's sale of the Zacarias deposit to 
Minere, Amarillo's land position includes limited ground covering the Central and Western 
Belts. 
 
The Eastern Belt, which in general strikes to the north-east and dips moderately to steeply to 
the north-west, has a maximum thickness of 6 km. Surface topography over the belt is 
characterized by moderate relief and locally dissected drainages that follow lithologic or 
structural weaknesses. Depth to fresh bedrock is generally shallow, ranging from 0 to 15 m. 
The upper portion of the weathered profile consists of clay-rich latosol and saprolite derived 
from the underlying bedrock. Low-lying areas along drainages channels are covered by a 
relatively thin (<15 m to 25 m) veneer of alluvial sediment. Although fresh outcrop is sparse, 
individual stratigraphic units can be distinguished by surface floats and local soil/saprolite 
composition. The principal stratigraphic units of the Eastern Belt are presented in Table 7-1 
and Figure 7.3.

range from weak to moderate, and generally intensify along sheared contacts. The tonalitic 
orthogneiss which separates the Eastern and Central Belts is composed of coarse-grained 
plagioclase, hornblende, and biotite with localized patches of biotite schist near its contact 
with the Eastern Belt. 
 
The Eastern Belt is structurally dominated by well-developed, penetrative foliation that 
strikes 30° to 50° and dips 40° to 70° north-west – an orientation subparallel to stratigraphy. 
Major structural systems include 50° to 65° striking shears and thrusts and associated drag 
folds. Shears are most commonly developed along zones of elastic disparity such as 
lithologic contacts. Shear sense is typically reversedextral oblique although a sinistral sense 
is locally observed. A second set of structures consists of late cross cutting north-west to 
east-northeast striking brittle faults and fractures that locally offset stratigraphy in apparent 
dextral strike-slip sense. Although the style of deformation for the region is strongly 
suggestive of isoclinal folding and possible stratigraphic inversion, direct field evidence 
indicating the presence of such phenomena remains inconclusive (Metallica personal 
communication to P. Mullens). 
 
Uranium-lead isotopic age determination of zircons from some of the principal lithologic units 
within the district indicates timing of initial rock formation for both the belt rocks and the 
tonalite gneiss to be between approximately 870 Ma to 850 Ma (Viana, 1995). Subsequent 
amphibolite facies metamorphism is estimated to have occurred between 700 Ma to 600 Ma 
based on uranium-lead and rubidium-strontium dating of recrystallised titanate. The latter 
date corresponds to peak metamorphism related to the Brasiliano orogenic event.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

 
As discussed above, several significant mineral deposits occur in the Mara Rosa region 
including the Posse gold deposit, the Zacarias gold-silver-barite deposit and the Chapada 
copper-gold deposit, in addition to numerous historic prospects and garimpos (Table 8-1).

The Posse Deposit is hosted in a regional thrust that probably acted as one of the primary 
dewatering conduits during the Neo-Proterozoic Brasiliano orogeny. The geophysical, 
geological and geochemical data available demonstrate that the Posse Deposit occurs within 
a 50 km long structural zone with potassium alteration and lower order gold- copper-
molybdenum mineralization. The Posse Deposit has a hanging wall of grey gneiss and the 
foot wall of amphibolites, "greenstone", and it is speculated that the rheological contrast 
between the two rock types captured the regional thrust (movement West to East) for a 2 km 
segment. It is also possible that the chemical contrast between these acid hanging wall and 
basic foot wall may have aided in focusing the mineralizing fluids. Observations in the core 
suggest that an earlier potassic event with chalcopyrite, molybdenum, quartz veining, biotite 
and K-feldspar was followed by a later auriferous phyllic event with pyrite, Fe-telluride, and 
sericite. The gold occurs free as well as associated with the telluride and pyrite.  
 
In general, mineralization at Posse is developed along a 50° to 65° striking fault set. 
Mineralization tends to be strongest within mylonitic zones that follow more northerly striking 
(approximately 30° to 50°) shear strands and dilatant jogs within the larger 50° to 65° striking 
major shears that obliquely transect the contact between the Gray Gneiss in the hanging 
wall and the Muscovite Schist and Medial and/or Eastern Amphibolites in the foot-wall 
(Figure 8.2). Shearing of the Gray Gneiss has resulted in the formation of a distinct lithologic 
unit, the quartz-feldspar-mica schist (Posse Schist) that is characteristic of the Posse ore 
zone. This unit has been identified in several other areas including the Posse foot-wall and 
on strike extensions of the Posse Ore Zone to the northeast. 
 
The ore body is about 30 m thick and over 1 km long. It is structurally controlled dipping to 
the NW at about 45

o
, striking NE-SW. The mylonitic appearance is most noticeable in the 

footwall where shearing is the most intense. The intense shearing is associated with

generally increased sulphide mineralisation (up to about 4%), and a slight increase in 
metamorphic grade from greenschist to high greenschist facies in the hanging wall to high 
greenschist/low amphibolite facies in the footwall (large biotite flakes, some garnets). The 
best gold values are associated with intense shearing and higher levels of sulphide 
mineralisation. 
 
Aside from the slight increase in metamorphic grade, there appears to be a chemical 
difference between the hanging wall and footwall, based on ICP analyses obtained from the 
2005/2006 drilling program, this however cannot be visually observed 
 
The shear zone may be more complicated than a simple main shear near the footwall with 
gradually decreasing intensity towards the hanging wall. Based on geochemical evidence 
there is some reason to believe that the shear zone has either been active to varying 
degrees at different levels in the sequence, or that different planes were active at different 
times. 
 
In addition in a number of holes a basaltic dyke has been intersected which may offset the 
ore body however a good 3D understanding of this dyke does not yet exist.  
 
The following intersections with basalt have been observed 

 MRP0001 from 152.36 to 159.25 

 MRP0004 from 103.50 to 108.00 

 MRP0006 from 35.75 to 37.00 and from 164.75 to 166.54 

 MRP0015 from 62.07 to 66.55 

 MRP0019 from 252.80 to 265.60 

 MRP0029A the interval is from 262.70 to 283.25 
 
 
The main ore zone is characterised by the following features 

 potassic alteration 

 silicification 

 small irregular sulphides, mainly pyrite 

 retrograde amphibolite facies 

 greenschist facies 
 
Mineralization at Posse has been traced along strike for approximately 1.5 km with an 
average thickness ranging between 30 m and 75 m and has been drilled to a vertical depth 
of 400 m. The Posse deposit was reported by predecessors to be confined to two separate 
northwest-dipping tabular lens-like lodes, referred to as the North lode and South lode. Both 
lodes have been partially mined by open pit (the North lode pit has been backfilled). Mapping 
of the South lode has indicated the presence of a 34° to 40° westerly plunge which has been 
speculated to be the result of reverse-dextral oblique slip along the main Posse shear zone 
(Caddey, 1997 and Rosendo, 1998). This plunge may control the overall trend of gold 
mineralization in the deposit, and is considered key to understanding and exploring for 
shear-hosted gold mineralization elsewhere in the district. An inclined longitudinal section of 
the Posse Deposit facing southeast is presented in Figure 8.3. The drill intercepts have been

9.0 EXPLORATION SINCE 2010 

 
No new exploration work on the Posse Deposit was carried out between the completion of 
the 2008 drilling and the completion of the 2010 PEA report. The only exploration work 
carried out since then is the 2010/2011 drilling program (the 2011 drilling), the subject of this 
report, which commenced in October 2010 and was completed in March 2011. 
 
 

10.0 2011 DRILLING 

 

10.1 Drill Hole Planning 

 
Drill Hole Planning was carried out in two parts: 
1. By Amarillo Staff with the focus on the collection of metallurgical and geotechnical data 
2. By Mr. Hoogvliet of HCS with the focus on conversion of Inferred blocks from the 2010 
PEA Resource Estimate to Indicated or higher 
 
Initial hole locations were chosen to collect information on metallurgical and geotechnical 
data, these locations were then referred to HCS so that additional holes could be planned 
which would maximise the conversion of blocks identified as Inferred in the 2010 PEA to 
Indicated while at the same time upgrading Inferred to Measured blocks. 
 
 

10.1.1 Conversion of Inferred blocks to Indicated or higher. 

 
The 2010 PEA block model was displayed showing the class of blocks (1=Measured; 
2=Inferred; 3=Indicated). Starting in the southwest on section 1, the most obvious locations 
were chosen for additional drilling to both convert class 3 to a higher class, and to confirm 
'bottom of the pit' (the $1,000 shell from the 2010 PEA report) mineralization. For planning 
purposes fictitious grades and HW, MAIN and FW (expected) intercepts were assigned to 
the planned drill holes. Before moving on to the next section, an Inverse Distance to the 
Power 2 (ID2) modelling run was made using the 2010 PEA search parameters (and 
including the planned holes) for the sole purpose of determining which blocks would be 
converted from Inferred to higher if that hole was drilled as planned. With the 'updated' block 
classification, which reached beyond the sections on either side, new drill holes were 
planned on the next section 50 m to the northeast. In other words, an iterative approach was 
adopted so that effects of drill holes planned for one section were incorporated into the 
planning of the holes on the next section. This process of planning holes, and modelling 
before moving to the next section, was repeated for all sections covering the 2010 PEA 
$1,000 pit shell.

The results of this planning study are presented in Table 10.1 and Figure 10.1 
 
Based on this study, an estimated 82% percent of ore blocks within the $1000 pit shell would 
be classified as Indicated or Measured, and able to be included in ore reserve estimates and 
pre feasibility pit design. This compares to 56% of the blocks in the 2010 PEA study.

10.2 Technical and Support Staff 

With the onslaught of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the then current team was 
dismantled. The only remaining technical staff member from 2008 was Augusto, an 
experienced exploration geologist. For the 2011 drilling a new team was assembled, 
consisting of Wilson, and Rodrigo. Support staff from the 2008 drilling was re-hired from the 
local population, consisting of Jesus and Jose, both very experienced field technicians with a 
significant amount of historical exploration knowledge. 
 
 

10.3 Drill Hole Setup 

Holes are marked up by handheld GPS, but picked up by DGPS. The magnetic azimuth is 
marked up with three pegs in-line, setup with a Brunton compass. The difference between 
magnetic and true north, according to Augusto, is 20

o
 (in the 2008 campaign it was 19

o
). 

This was confirmed on www.magnetic-declination.com which shows the declination for 
Goiania to be -20

o
 27'. So for a hole drilled with a true azimuth of 140

o
 the markup should be 

160
o
 magnetic. A check on the setup of hole (MRP0035 (plan ID 22, one of the holes about 

to be collared during the site visit) showed 157
o
 magnetic (137

o
 true) with a Suunto 

compass. The drillers manoeuvre the drill rig according to the setup string to the best of their 
ability. Before drilling commences, a geologist from Amarillo does a field check of the drill 
hole setup. The field inspection includes a check on the azimuth and dip, both with the 
Brunton compass, Figure 10.2.

10.4 Drilling Execution 

The Drilling contractor was Mata Nativa Comercio e Servicos Ltda, from Nova Lima (MG), 
which utilizes I-800 triple tube wireline drill rigs, equivalent to a Longyear LY44. The three 
rigs used on the 2011 drill program were several years old, but generally in good condition. 
Each rig was operated by a driller with four assistants. The rigs were of the same model, and 
in similar condition. Three rigs were in operation during the site visit, Figure 10.3. The drillers 
as well as the crew appeared experienced enough to do their job in a competent way.

10.4.1 Down Hole Surveys 

Down hole surveys are collected with the Maxibor system, an instrument often used in highly 
magnetic rocks. It is a down hole optical survey system which measures changes in vertical 
dip and lateral variations. It is controlled from a palm top on the surface, which runs the 
Reflex software. It requires input of E, N, RL and Azimuth of the top of the hole (the collar). 
This information is downloaded to the survey tool prior to lowering the instrument. It can read 
in intervals of 1.5 m or 3 m, and read from top to bottom, bottom to top, or both. It does not 
measure azimuth as it does not have a compass. 
 
Upon completion of the survey, the data is downloaded onto the palmtop and sent to a 
Maxibor office for conversion of the data to E, N, RL for each 1.5 m or 3 m reading. This file 
then gets send to the client. The survey takes about 15 minutes for every 100 m. If 
preliminary data are used for E, N, RL and/or azimuth, the downhole data needs to be re-
calculated when final location information becomes available. 
 
The Maxibor tool used at Posse was owned by Mata Nativa, the drilling company doing the 
current drilling. 
 
 

10.4.2 Driller's Field Records 

The field recording by the driller includes: From (m), To (m), Drilled (m), Core Length (m), 
Length of Rod (m). Initially this information is recorded in a field book, which at the end of the 
shift gets transcribed into the official log, which forms the basis for approval and payment. 
 
The drill data records from the driller are not separately captured in a file.

10.4.3 Core mark up (Field) 

As the drill core is extracted from the core tube, it is laid out in a 3 m long V-shaped tray, 
from which the data above are collected (Figure 10.4). The core is cleaned with a cloth and 
water, the relevant drill data is recorded, the core is transferred to core boxes with 4 or 5 
bays (depending on core size), from the top left to the bottom right. The individual runs are 
clearly marked by wooden core markers, with the depth at the end of the run punched into 
aluminium tags, which in turn are nailed to wooden blocks. For each run a spear is lowered 
to mark the base of the core. Upon retrieval of the core, the imprint of the spear is 
highlighted and the pieces of core are re-assembled into their original relative position, and a 
reference line is marked on the piece of core with the spear imprint. Each core box is clearly 
marked with the hole number and other relevant details. 
 
The core is transported to the core shed near Mara Rosa on a daily basis by the drill 
contractor.

10.4.4 Collar Preservation 

After the hole is completed and the rig moved to another location, a piece of PVC pipe is 
cemented in at the location of the hole, (Figure 10.5), with the hole number, start and end 
date and the depth clearly marked. All rubbish is removed; the site is levelled, and 
rehabilitated, or left to rehabilitate itself. Most collars have a cap on the PVC pipe. 
 

  
Figure 10.5: Completed and marked drillholes 

 
 

10.4.5 Core Shed Procedures 

The individual runs of core are re-assembled in a V-shaped tray, with the individual pieces 
matched to each other, and the bottom of the core (based on the position of the spear mark) 
is marked along the core for its entire length, (Figure 10.6). This procedure ensures that the 
core is cut without bias towards veins and structures. It also allows for collection of oriented 
core data. 
 
Magnetic susceptibility data is collected with a frequency of one spot reading per metre.  It 
should be noted however that a search for historic magnetic susceptibility measurements 
has only revealed data for holes F001 to F009. 
 
The following geotechnical data is collected: 

 RQD excluding drillers breaks (not marked but picked by experience) 

 Number of fractures 

 Fractures per metre 

 Number of parts> 12.5 cm 

 Sum of parts > 12.5 cm 

 RQD% 

 Alteration 

 Hardness using ISRM 81 scale (0-6 scale; 0 being very soft, 6 very hard) 

 Conditions of fracture

 Fracture fill 

 Angle of fracture with core axis + depth 
 
Before cutting, the dry core is photographed. 
 
The depth of the core is marked in 1 m or 2.5 m intervals on the side of the bay, and the 
sample number is punched into an aluminium tag, which is nailed underneath the relevant 
depth marking.

10.5 Densities 

Density measurements were collected as part of the 2011 drilling program however at the 
date of this report the most recent measurements had not been validated so the results have 
not been included in this Technical Report. It is however noted that initial results suggest a 
slightly higher SG than was used in the resource estimation reported in Section 14 of this 
report. Amarillo are also preparing a set 200 of samples which will be used for density 
determination by a recognised independent laboratory. It would be expected that the results 
of this work will be used for density estimates in the future. 
 
Historically there have been a number of density measurements used based on the sets of 
data listed below : 
 

 Set 1: The 2008 Amarillo data over three MRP holes (10-12) 

 Set 2: The 2007 CCIC samples 

 Set 3: the WMC data from the mid 1980's 

 Set 4: The 2006 Zonge data 
 
The data in each set of measurements is summarized in Table 11.1

Mean (all) 2.77 2.78 2.56 2.85 

Median (all) 2.72 2.77 2.55 2.82 

Mean (>0.4 g/t) 2.71 NA 2.57 2.85 

 
The 2010 report discussed the validity of each set of data and the authors concluded taking 
into account the uncertainties on the actual determinations, the quality of the Zonge data as 
well as the theoretical determinations, that a density of 2.73 across the board was the most 
appropriate at this time.  This report has adopted the same value for density. 
 
 

10.6 Sampling Method and Approach 

Prior to cutting the core a short log is created to assist sampling.  The core is then cut on site 
using the line marked on the core as a guide. The actual cut is on one side of the line, 
resulting in one half being exactly half, whilst the other half (which is used for sampling) is 
less than half, the difference being the width of the blade, (Figure 10.7). This cut is achieved 
by having a slightly off-centre sledge, or tray, in which the core rests during cutting. This 
procedure is on the advice of AVB (geotechnical consultants). 
 
The core is sampled at 2.5 m intervals in areas away from the main zone and at 1 m 
intervals in the main zone.

10.7 Geological Data Collection 

Detailed logging is conducted on site. However the logging at the time of the site visit was 
lagging well behind drilling. Logging was not completed on drill hole MRP0020, even though 
assays had already been received.  At this time hole MRP0034 was being drilled. The 
logged data is entered into an Excel spreadsheet and prior to final acceptance the logging is 
checked and the holes are manually plotted on sections. Logging includes: 
 

 Lithology: 16 codes 

 Alteration minerals 

 Sulphides: pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite 

 Minerals: magnetite, garnet, chlorite 

 Long hand description

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

Upon completion of the cutting, samples are collected in plastic bags. Each sample contains 
two tickets from a pre-printed sample number book. In the book, the details for each sample 
are recorded, including hole # and from-to. Regular samples are 'half' core, whilst the half 
core is recut to produce 2 quarter sections of core for duplicate samples. Prior to the 2010 – 
2011 drilling program no duplicate samples were collected however on the recommendation 
of HCS and AEFS in the 2010 Report a decision was made to generate duplicates as part of 
the QA/QC sample stream. The results of this work and the other QA/QC sampling are 
discussed in section 12.2.1 below. 
 
Samples are despatched to the laboratory in lots of 150. 
 
The plastic bags containing each sample (Figure 11.1) are packed into canvas bags with 4-5 
samples in each bag for transport to the laboratory. The canvas bags are sealed and marked 
with the requisition number, address, sender's details, and marked 1/28, 2/28 etc. One copy 
of the requisition is retained and stored in the company archives and another goes to the 
driver taking the samples to the laboratory. A copy of the requisition is also sent to ACME, 
the laboratory carrying out the assay work, and Amarillo staff by email. 
 
Initial sample preparation is carried out in Goiania by ACME labs. The procedure at ACME 
includes the following steps: 

 Sorting and checking against the requisition sheet 

 Drying at 60
o
 C 

 A granite wash is used to scour the equipment before the client's first sample is 
crushed 

 Crushing of the samples to 80% passing 10# (2 mm) 

 Samples are homogenised, and riffle split to 250 g subsample 

 A granite wash is used to scour the equipment before the client's first sample is 
pulverised 

 Client's samples are pulverised to 85% passing 200# (75 micron) 

 Equipment is cleaning by brush and pressurised air 

 A granite wash is used to scour the equipment after high grade samples, between 
changes in rock colour, and at the end of each file. 

 
The ACME sample preparation facility in Goiania was visited by Kevin Kivi, an experienced 
exploration geologist from Canada. The procedures were reported to be of a high standard 
and the results of QAQC sampling support this even though the ACME sample preparation 
facility in Goiania is not accredited to ISO 9001. 
 
Approximately 100 g of the final pulverised samples, standards and blanks are sent to the 
assay laboratory, with a pulverised duplicate retained at ACME. Assaying is carried out in 
Canada by ACME's central assay laboratory in Vancouver which was accredited under ISO 
9001 in November 1996. The registration has been maintained in good standing since then.

It is the opinion of Hugo Hoogvliet of Hoogvliet Contract Services that the 2010 – 2011 
drilling program and all its associated procedures is of a sufficiently high quality that 
the data obtained from the program can be considered to be reliable and included in 
this 43-101 technical report.

The logging spreadsheets were used to generate a set of csv files prior to import into 
Micromine. The imported data showed a number of errors, largely related to missing or 
overlapping From and To's, and inconsistencies between bottom of the hole in the collar 
data and the From and To's. 
 

12.2 Amarillo QAQC 

QAQC samples are an important part of the data verification process and should be routinely 
used and analyses as part of any drilling program. At Posse QAQC samples generally 
account for more than 10% of all samples. Initially QC followed 2008 the procedure, which 
included one standard (STD), one blank but no duplicates every 20 samples. This procedure 
was modified from MRP0018 to provide for the inclusion of duplicate samples as 
recommended in the 2010 report. QAQC samples, consisting of a standard, a blank or a 
sample duplicate, are now inserted every 25 samples on average. This allows a degree of 
flexibility in placing the QAQC samples so that they are used to the best advantage. 
 
Standards and blanks have been supplied by Rocklabs from Auckland, New Zealand. 
Standards are shipped in jars of 2.5 kg. A small sample is scooped out, and weighed to get 
100 g and put in a plastic bag, apparently the same type as those used in the sample 
preparation lab in Goiania, (Figure 12.1). 
 
Blanks come in 50 g packets; two are combined into one to make up one 100 g blank 
sample. 
 
Certificates for all three standards have been sighted: 
 

 SK43 has an average grade of 4.086 g/t Au with 0.036 g/t variation for 95% 
accuracy 

 SJ39 has an average grade of 2.641 g/t Au with 0.033 g/t variation for 95% 
accuracy 

 SH35 has an average grade of 1.323 g/t Au with 0.017 g/t variation for 95% 
accuracy

12.2.1 QAQC Results 

 
As part of the data collection process regular standards and blanks were inserted into the 
sample stream. Plotting the expected versus the actual value of a standard or blank over 
time will indicate any major deviations from the expected value. When this happens the 
cause can be investigated and if necessary the batches of assays associated with the out of 
control standards can be submitted for re-assay. Throughout the 2010 - 2011 drilling 
program three Standards were used.  The standards used were all supplied by Rocklabs of 
Auckland, New Zealand and were coded SH35, SJ39 and SK43. The certified value of the 
Standards is set out in Table 12.1. 
 

Table 12.1: Certified values of standards 

Standard Certified Value 

SH35 1.323 g/t 

SJ39 2.641 g/t 

SK43 4.086 g/t 

 
Run charts covering the period of the drill program are shown in Figures 12.2 – 12.4. All 
three charts show samples outside the expected +/- 10% boundary.  In the case of Standard 
SH35 it would appear as though two blank samples have been miscoded as SH35. The 
chart of SJ39 shows one outlier, this has a value of around 4 g/t and is probably actually a 
sample of standard SK43 that has been miscoded. The chart of SK43 has all but one sample 
within the control bands, the one point which is out is only just out of bounds and does not 
suggest any serious issues with the QAQC data.

In addition to the above standards, blanks and sample duplicates were also used for QAQC 
sampling. The blanks are shown in Figure 12.5 and the duplicates in Figure 12.6.  The 
blanks span the period of the 2008 drilling and the 2010 - 2011 drilling and show a major 
change with the start of the 2010 – 2011 drilling program. The 2010 – 2011 drilling program 
shows a much lower incidence of blanks returning higher than expected assay results (i.e. 
Assay results which are more than the assay detection limit) and indicates a major 
improvement in the quality of the sampling and recording of data associated with the latest 
drilling program.

Figure 12.5: QAQC blanks 2008 and 2010 - 2011 drilling programs 

 
The duplicate samples which were taken for holes MRP0018 onwards would be expected to 
show an extremely high correlation with the original sample values. A scatter plot, Figure 
12.6, of the original samples versus the duplicates is the standard way of analysing such 
data and in this case indicates a correlation of better than 98% with no obvious outliers. This 
is a very good result and indicates that the data was well recorded and that the assay results 
are repeatable. The repeatability of the assay results not only indicated that the laboratory is 
doing its job correctly but that there are no large issues with nugget gold where coarse 
grains of gold lead to a lack of repeatability in the assay results.

It is the opinion of both Keith Whitehouse of AEFS and Hugo Hoogvliet of HCS that 
the results of the sample QAQC program associated with the samples from the 2010 – 
2011 drilling indicate a generally high quality of work and do not show any cause for 
concern. 
 
 
 

12.2.2 Due Diligence QAQC 

As part of the site visit Mr Hoogvliet collected 32 samples consisting of ¼ core duplicates, 
pulp duplicates obtained from ACME in Goiania, as well as 2 blanks, and two samples each 
of the three standards. The results are presented in Table 12.2 and Figures 12.8 and 12.9. 
The results show excellent correlation between the original assay results and the repeat 
assay results.

12.3 Drillhole coordinates 

 
One of the recommendations in the 2010 report was that all new drillhole be accurately 
surveyed and that where possible historic collars should also be located in order to compare 
the historical coordinates with modern accurate coordinate determinations. In order to 
facilitate this Amarillo have acquired a high quality differential global positioning system 
(DGPS) receiver. This instrument can measure horizontal coordinates to a precision of +/- 
0.1 m or better. Vertical coordinates are less well defined but are within + / - .5 m. All 
drillhole collars from the 2010 - 2011 drilling campaign were located with the DGPS together 
with other drillhole collars which could be physically located in the field. Final measurements 
were made using the WGS 84 datum and coordinates were recorded in terms of a UTM 
projection, Zone 22S (WGS84 coordinates), these coordinates are effectively the same as 
coordinates in the Zone 22S projection of the SIRGAS2000 datum. From 2014 the

SIRGAS2000 datum will be the only legal datum used in Brazil and the SAD69 datum is 
being phased out. 
 
Coordinates of all holes in the 2010 - 2011 drill program were also recorded in SAD69 
coordinates. Since all the drill data is located in a small (geographic) area a plan grid 
transformation based on the average difference in East and North of all holes located in both 
the WGS84 and SAD69 datum's provided a simple transformation that could be applied to 
convert the locations of holes and other data where the coordinates were only known in the 
SAD69 to the WGS84 datum as shown in Table 12.3.

12.4 Topographic survey data 

The 2010 report used a topographic surface derived from digitized topographic maps 
referenced to the old Corrego Alegre datum. The maps were based on 1985 aerial 
photography with some ground-truthing. Comparison of the digitised data with drillhole 
collars etc. indicated a good fit to the pre-mined surface. With the arrival of a high quality 
DGPS on site at Posse in early 2011 the opportunity is being taken to update the 
topographic surface model. This work has involved surveying all open areas surrounding 
Posse with a DGPS and substituting valid X, Y and Z data points obtained from the DGPS 
for the points in the same areas on the digitized topographic surface. Data used for elevation 
observations is limited to DGPS observations with a PDOP <3.

 PDOP refers to Position Dilution of Precision as is a standard measure of the quality of GPS data. A 

lower PDOP indicates a better satellite geometry and hence reliability of data and accuracy of 
coordinate observations. The Wikipedia entry for DOP includes Table 12.4 which outlines the 
meaning of DOP measures.

of the current location. 

>20 Poor At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 
meters with a 6 meter accurate device (50 DOP × 6 meters) and 
should be discarded. 

 
The revised surface topography provides a good fit to historic collar elevation values, it is 
expected that further work will be carried out to verify the surface topography as the project 
progresses into Prefeasibility and it is hoped, Feasibility. 
 

12.5 Downhole Survey 

 
As part of the data review conducted as part of the validation process it was noted that the 
holes in the 2010 - 2011 drilling program from MRP0020 - MRP0045 showed a noticeable 
deviation. In all but one of the holes this was to the south (a clockwise turn when looking 
down the hole). Drill hole MRP0030 was the only one which turned counter clockwise 
(Figure 12.9).

The reason for this deviation in the holes is not clear and Amarillo would be advised to check 
the actual trajectory of the holes with a multi-shot down hole survey instrument if the holes 
can be accessed. It should be noted however that when the mineralisation wireframes were 
generated particular attention was paid to these holes to check if they caused and disruption 
or irregularity in the wireframes.  No such effects were observed and this would suggest that 
the deviations observed are real. The deviation of the holes has meant that a number of the 
planned holes did not end up in the target location. This was examined and taken into 
account when blocks in the mineralisation model were coded for resource classification. 
 
 

12.6 Improvement of Drilling Programs 

 
The 2010 – 2011 drilling campaign met the objective of improving confidence in relation to 
the mineralization at Posse. There are however a number of issues related to the setup and 
management of the drill program which if addressed will improve the quality of data 
gathered.  Where relevant the suggestions outlined should be adopted for all future drilling at 
Posse. 
 
 

12.6.1 Drill Rig Setup 

Mr Hoogvliet noticed that during the field check of the rig setup before drilling commenced, 
the mast was in a vertical position, and the skids of the rig were perpendicular to the drill 
direction. This removes the two most reliable reference points to properly setup the rig. 
Lowering the mast to a horizontal position while sighting would allow the geologist to better 
gauge how well the rig is aligned with the sighting string. Similarly, reading the dip on the 
Brunton compass with its relatively small dials, is not ideal. Use of 50 cm clinometers would 
make the setup more accurate, and easier. 
 
 

12.6.2 Down Hole Surveys 

The point made under drill rig setup carries through to down hole surveys. Because the 
down hole surveys were done with an optical instrument (Maxibor) which requires azimuth 
as input, the accurate setup of the rig is therefore more important than if a magnetic down 
hole tool were to be used. Any inaccuracy introduced during the setup of the rig carries 
through to the down hole surveys.  
 
In the 2010 – 2011 drilling program the setup at the collar is dependent on a handheld 
compass for both azimuth and dip. The inaccuracies inherent in this setup will therefore limit 
the accuracy of the surveys obtained from the Maxibor survey which is designed to be used 
in a situation where the rock being drilled is highly magnetic. This is not the case at Posse 
and it is therefore recommended that subsequent to drilling, standard downhole survey data 
is collected with an Eastman, Tropari or equivalent instrument where possible.

12.6.3 Data base 

Because the Maxibor is provided with true collar and down dip information for its survey, 
there is no survey of the magnetic dip direction. However, magnetic 'data' is recorded in the 
data base as a calculated number. In data from the 2010-2011 drilling program, the 20

o
 

difference between magnetic and true is subtracted for some holes in the data base, and 
added to other holes in the data base. Even though the determination of the magnetic 
azimuth is in this case mostly academic, part of the magnetic azimuth 'data' is incorrect. If as 
recommended above future downhole survey work use magnetic north based measures of 
azimuth and dip then it is essential that this is calculated correctly. 
 
The website www.magnetic declination.com reports the declination as -20

 o
 27' at Mara 

Rosa, so to go from a true azimuth to a magnetic azimuth requires the declination to be 
subtracted, similarly to go from magnetic to true azimuth the declination must be added. In 
the data provided Holes MRP0015 – MRP0020 had magnetic azimuth correctly calculated; 
the others were incorrect. 
 
 

12.7 Drill Program Assessment 

It is the opinion of Mr Hoogvliet that the 2010-2011 drilling program was executed to 
adequate or higher standards, including the associated sampling, surveying, assaying and 
quality control procedures, and is of sufficient quality to be included in a 43-101 compliant 
report.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The 2010 43 - 101 Technical Report contained an extensive discussion of mineral 
processing and metallurgical tests which had been carried out to early 2010 much of which 
gave conflicting and or poor results due to a lack of understanding of gold telluride 
chemistry, which although not overly complex, is rarely seen in practice with few plants 
treating such ores worldwide. Since that time there has been further test work completed to 
understand the ore and the processes necessary to maximise extraction of Au. This work 
has produced a mineral processing circuit which appears to be capable of processing the 
mineralised material at Posse with recoveries in excess of 90%. This work was discussed in 
an Amarillo press release dated 24 May 2011 and is considered to provide the base case for 
the planned pre-feasibility study of the Posse deposit. 
 
In the latest test work, conducted by Coffey's, it was noted that the Mara Rosa samples 
comprised a free milling component representing around 75% of the sample and a refractory 
component thought to be associated with sulphides and tellurides which comprised around 
25% of the sample. 
 
Gold recoveries in excess of 93% of the contained gold were readily achieved using 
conventional carbon in leach (CIL) technology with the addition of a simple pre-oxidation 
stage (3 agitated tanks) prior to the CIL circuit to account for the refractory gold telluride 
component in the sample. Cyanide consumption was low at 0.26 kg/t, whilst lime 
requirements were slightly higher than average at 1.93 kg/t. The slightly higher lime 
requirement is needed to raise the pH to 12 to accelerate the gold telluride oxidation process 
 
The Coffey report noted that "Ores containing gold tellurides simply need to have an 
allowance for the oxidation of the gold telluride, using agitated tanks similar in size to the CIL 
tanks. The Mara Rosa material needs to be ground to a P80 size of 45 µm prior to a pre-
oxidation stage of 12 hours and a CIL stage of 24 hours. The overall plant residence time of 
36 hours is strongly influenced by the relatively slow process of gold telluride oxidation. 
Given recent improvements in the understanding of aqueous sulphide and telluride 
oxidation, it is considered that there remains considerable scope for a reduction in the 
residence time of the plant with the completion of testwork to feasibility study level. 
 
The samples came from three mineralogical domains; main, hanging wall and foot wall, but 
there were no significant differences between the domains from a metallurgical perspective. 
The samples tested were in the soft to medium range of competency in terms of milling and 
displayed no viscosity issues even at finer grind sizes. The abrasion index of the samples 
was in the medium to high range. 

It is proposed that the process flowsheet would include primary crushing followed by 
secondary and tertiary crushing in closed circuit. Tertiary crushed material would then feed a 
primary mill and secondary mill utilising cyclone classification to achieve a P80 grind of 
approximately 45 µm.

This material would be pre-oxidised at a pH of 12 for a period of 12 hours in agitated tanks 
and then leached under conventional CIL conditions for 24 hours during which an average of 
93% of the gold would be dissolved and adsorbed onto activated carbon. The adsorbed gold 
would then be eluted using a convention desorption plant. 

Tailings would be thickened to recover a significant proportion of the cyanide in the process 
solution, with the remaining thickened pulp detoxified to remove residual free cyanide prior to 
deposition in a tailings storage facility." 

Further metallurgical testwork is planned as the project moves through the pre-feasibility 
study. 

 
 

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 
AEFS completed a Mineral Resource Estimate in July 2011 using drillhole details supplied 
by Amarillo and wireframes supplied by HCS. The Mineral Resource Estimation presented 
below is based upon historic drill holes included as part of the previous resource estimate, 
together with the results from a series of 33 diamond drill holes drilled between late 2010 
and mid 2011 discussed in Section 10. 
 
This estimate represents the fourth Independent Mineral Resource Estimate completed on 
behalf of Amarillo for the Posse deposit. CCIC completed estimation of an Inferred Mineral 
Resource Estimate in March, 2007. An updated resource estimate which complied with the 
"Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves Definitions Guidelines" was provided to Amarillo by CCIC in February 
2008 while HCS and AEFS completed a Mineral Resource Estimate in 2010. 
 
 

14.1  Data Utilised 

 
Data used in the modelling consisted of a Micromine format set of drill collars, downhole 
surveys and assay data together with a set of wireframe boundaries which defined Hanging 
Wall, Main and Foot Wall zones to the deposit and the current surface topography. The 
wireframes were developed by Hugo Hoogvliet of HCS using the latest set of drillhole data. 
The surface topography used reflects the work discussed in section 12.4 and reflects the 
historic pits mined by WMC. A raw block model with primary blocks of 25 (E), 25 (N) and 10 
(RL) meters which was sub-blocked to 5 m x 5 m x 5 m to fit the ore and topography 
wireframes was also generated. The blocks in this model were coded to indicate which 
portion of the ore body a block belonged to. All data had coordinates in terms of the WGS 84 
coordinate system. 
 
A default SG of 2.73 (the same value as used in the 2010 report) was used for all tonnage 
estimates. Further SG measurements were made on site using the drill core from the most

recent drilling which suggest that the density of 2.73 may need to be revised upwards, 
however this data had not been validated prior to the development of this resource estimate 
therefore was not used. 
 
The modelling ellipses (with minor adjustments to improve the orientation of the ellipses) 
together with the variography used in the 2010 model were used in the 2011 model. 
 
The steps taken to generate the final model are discussed in more detail below 
 
 

14.2 The Modelling Process 

Initial modelling work consisted of defining a set of consistent sections to be used in the 
development of wireframes. The sections were all at an angle to the grid so that they are at 
right angles to the strike of the mineralisation. The list of sections is set out in Appendix C.  
For ease of reference all sections are named and these names have been used in this 
report. 
 

Three grade zones were recognised, Hanging Wall, Main and Foot Wall. The grade in both 

the Hanging Wall and Foot Wall was lower than the grade in the Main Zone and neither the 

Hanging Wall nor Foot Wall zones are continuous. There are also occasional spurs off the 

Hanging Wall, these have not been modelled as they are not well defined by drilling, similarly 

the basaltic dyke discussed in Section 8.1 above has not been incorporated in the wireframe 

as there is currently insufficient information to define its spatial orientation. During 

construction of the wireframes the boundary of the Hanging Wall and Foot Wall was 

deliberately allowed to intrude into the Main zone. After the initial wireframes were built they 

were then clipped using the Wireframe Boolean functions in Micromine to produce wireframe 

that had no under or overlap. The wireframes are shown in Figure 14.1.

Assay data was coded according to which wireframe the assay related to and was then 

composited to 1 m intervals for modelling. This had the effect of reducing high grades and no 

further cutting of the grade was used. Key statistical parameters of the raw and composited 

data are shown in Tables 14.1 and 14.2 while probability plots of the raw and the composited 

data are shown in Figures 14.3 and 14.4.

The block model was based on 25 m x 25 m x 10 m blocks sub blocked to 5 m x 5 mx 2 m to 

ensure that blocks fitted the wireframe boundaries. Each block was coded to identify the

topography. The model included blocks above the current topography as the dataset being

modelled included a number of holes drilled from inside the former open pit and 

subsequently mined. The wireframes were constructed to include this data however blocks 

above the current surface were removed from the model. 

The modelling process consisted of four (4) runs through the data for each of the zones to 

be modelled (HW, Main and FW) using different sized search ellipsoids. The different 

ellipsoids were nominally used to differentiate which resource classification code would be 

assigned to a block (i.e. Measured, Indicated, Inferred and Not Classified) this process was 

then modified based on the drillhole data density as shown on a long section in the plane of 

the vein, (Figure 14.13). 

The data was modelled using two different modelling algorithms, Inverse Distance Squared 

(IDS) and Median Indicator Kriging (MIK).  The IDS run was used to provide a result for 

comparison and the MIK model was used for the final results. Median Indicator Kriging was 

run in two parts both using the four (4) search ellipsoids, the second MIK run used modified 

search parameters to specifically model the higher grade portions of the deposit and was 

combined with the data from the first MIK run. This improved the fit of the modelled data to 

the raw data. The final model had a grade that was in keeping with the expected grade and 

showed a good fit to the raw data. The modelling result, while inevitably over estimating 

lower grades and underestimating higher grade, a result of the volume variance effect, 

should still reflect the distribution of the raw data. 

The search ellipsoid used in the modelling process was based on that used in the 2010 

modelling exercise. The orientation of the search ellipsoid was however updated to provide a 

better fit with the model anisotropy defined by the variography. Note that as the median 

value, the indicator modelled remained the same as in the 2010 model and there was no 

need to update the 2010 variography shown in Figures 14.8 – 14.11.

14.3 Model Classification 

 

After generating the block model the blocks within the model were classified. This was done 

by visually assessing the density of drillholes that pierced the ore zone using an inclined long 

section. The classifications applied to different zones within the mineralised horizon are 

shown in Figures 14.13 below. 

 

 

Figure 14.13: Ore classification boundaries applied to the model 

 

The areas of the model enclosed by the red boundary were classified as Measured, Those 

enclosed by the Blue boundary as Indicated and those enclosed by the green boundary as 

Inferred. Any blocks falling outside the green boundary have been classified as NC, Not 

Classified, and have not been reported.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

The mineralization which forms the Posse deposit has had Mineral Resources estimated on 
several occasions, the most recent estimate being the subject of section 14 of this report. 
Similarly there have been several previous Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) 
conducted on the Project, however to date no Mineral Reserve Estimate has been made. It 
is expected a Pre-Feasibility study will be conducted in Q4 of 2011 with a view to declaring a 
Mineral Reserve Estimate. 
 

16.0 MINING METHODS 

Previous Technical Reports which have included a Preliminary Economic Analysis of the 
Posse Mineralization have assumed that the mineralization would be mined by standard 
Open pit methods feeding a mill with the capacity of processing 2 Mt of ore per year for a 
mine life of approximately 12 years. The base parameters used as input to the pit 
optimisation routines used to generate a conceptual pit were : 
 

 Reference mining cost: $1.38/t  

 Mining Recovery Fraction: 97.5% 

 Mining Dilution Fraction: 2.5% 

 Processing Cost: $8.05/t milled 

 Metallurgical Recovery Fraction: 0.80 

 Selling Cost: 3% + $10 = 4% at $1000 

 Rock Density: 2.73 

 Pit Slope: 55 degrees 

 Discount Rate: 5% 

 Processing Limit: 2 Mtpa 

 Initial Capital Cost: $88.5 Million with a further $11.5 Million spent in year 
3 to upgrade mining fleet 

 
It is expected that the assumptions used in the PEA included as part of the 2010 Report will 
be updated by a Pre-Feasibility study to be conducted in Q4 of 2011 as part of the 
declaration of a Mineral Reserve Estimate. 
 
 

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

The 2010 Report assumed recovery of gold by a conventional gold processing plant 
involving Crushing and Grinding of ore, with liberation of ore using cyanide and recovery of 
gold using a Carbon in Pulp circuit. The recent metallurgical studies discussed in section 13 
have proposed a similar process with an additional step to process the refractory portion of 
the ore. A Pre-Feasibility study to be completed in Q4 of this year will update the planned 
mineral processing and recovery methodology.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

 
This report has primarily examined the Mineral Resources at the Posse Deposit. As such no 
investigation of the infrastructure necessary to support a mining operation has been carried 
out. It is however noted that the deposit lies 6 Km from the regional town of Mara Rosa and 
has previously supported a mining operation when the project was owned by Western 
Mining Corporation (WMC). 
 
WMC maintained a core logging and storage facility, sample preparation laboratory, assay 
laboratory, and office complex immediately northwest of the town of Mara Rosa, 
approximately 1 km from the town centre and 4.75 km from the previous plant area. The 
facilities, which occupy 10 ha of freehold land, are now owned and maintained by Amarillo 
and have been utilized during their exploration programs. The structures were upgraded by 
Amarillo in 2007 and remain in excellent condition, with operating connections to the power 
and water supplies. 
 
Administration of mining and exploration activities can be centred from these facilities. It is 
expected based on the PEA in the 2010 Report that a future mining operation at Posse will 
be significantly larger than that run by WMC, and that further improvements and expansions 
will be necessary. 
 
Amarillo also owns two houses on contiguous pieces of land on São Paolo Street within the 
town of Mara Rosa. One house is occupied by a caretaker and the other is utilized as 
accommodations for staff and visitors. 
 
 

18.1.1   Labour Forces 

The Municipality of Mara Rosa is located 356 km north of Goiânia in the Porangatu 
Microregion, 11 kilometres west of the Belém-Brasília highway, between the basins of the 
Araguaia River and the Tocantins River. According to a 2007 estimate, Mara Rosa has a 
population of approximately 25,000 of whom 11,500 live in the town. Mara Rosa is the 
biggest producer of saffron in the state of Goiás and there are also important plantations of 
corn, soybeans, and rice. Cattle herding and agriculture are the primary industries. Portions 
of the labour force may be sourced from Mara Rosa; however, skilled labour and 
administrative positions will require sourcing from larger urban centres. 
 
 

18.1.2   Power Supply 

Electric power will be supplied by CELG, the State of Goiás Energy Authority. The local grid 
has an installed capacity of 34.5 megawatts. In order for WMC to mine at Mara Rosa a 
special power line was requested to CELG; the contract expired in 1995. In order to restart 
the activities negotiation of a new contract would be required. The sale or transfer of electric 
power is not allowed. There may be a requirement to upgrade the capacity of the local

supply to the mine site, considerable more power will be needed for the 5,600 tpd 
processing operation envisaged in the PEA included as part of the 2010 Report than was 
used for WMC's 600 tpd plant operated during the 1980's. This study would be included as a 
part of a PFS.  
 
 

18.1.3  Water Supply 

The water supply is metered and is provided by SANEAGO, the state water company. Water 
for the previous Posse mine site as well as ranches in the surrounding region is derived from 
a combination of local streams and artesian wells. 
 
 

18.1.4  Waste Management 

Solid waste generated from the mine plant site, including ancillary buildings, will primarily be 
domestic and industrial non-hazardous waste. Development of a comprehensive Waste 
Management Plan will be required for the project. Solid waste will include refuse from 
construction (scrap wood, metal, concrete, etc.), refuse from the mine (empty drums, 
packing materials, etc.), and general domestic garbage from the offices and ancillary 
buildings (paper, refuse food, etc.). Construction debris, inert waste and used tires will be 
placed in designated cells and covered within the waste rock dumps. This is an accepted 
method in the mining industry. Solid domestic and industrial waste from the mine plant 
facilities will be recycled and re-used in an approved manner, where feasible. Other solid 
waste will be placed in waste receptacles. 
 
 

19.0 MARKETING STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

 
A gold price of $1000 USD per ounce was utilized as the base scenario in the PEA 
conducted as part of the 2010 report. The PEA concluded that there was potential for 
economic extraction of ore at Posse. Since that time there has been a general increase in 
the gold price towards $1500 USD per ounce.  
 
To date there have been no marketing studies carried out or Contracts signed. 
 
 

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 

COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 
Amarillo has started baseline environmental studies as part of work towards a Pre-Feasibility 
report expected to be completed in Q4 of 2011. Similarly work is underway to determine the 
permitting required and to obtain these where appropriate keeping in that the Pre-Feasibility

study is only expected to be completed later in 2011 and that most permitting will not be 
required until the project commences mine development. 
 
A social Impact study will be conducted as part of the Pre-Feasibility study. 
 
 

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

In the PEA included as part of the 2010 Report an Initial Capital Cost of $88.5 Million with a 
further $11.5 Million spent in year 3 to upgrade mining fleet was assumed. No further work 
has been carried out on this area as it will be investigated as part of the Pre-Feasibility 
study. 
 
 

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The 2010 Report included a PEA, whilst some reference to that has been made in this 
report, it is now considered to be out of date and is to be updated by data included in the 
Pre-feasibility study, planned for Q4 of 2011. 
 
 

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

As mentioned in Section 8 above, several significant mineral deposits occur in the Mara 
Rosa region including the Posse gold deposit, the Zacarias gold-silver-barite deposit and the 
Chapada copper-gold deposit, in addition to numerous historic prospects and garimpos 
(Table 23.1).

23.1  Zacarias 

The Zacarias gold-silver-barite deposit is hosted within the Central Belt of the Mara Rosa 
volcano-sedimentary sequence and is located 11 km west-northwest of the town of Mara 
Rosa. The occurrence was first identified by BHP through regional gold-colour-count stream 
sediment sampling circa 1985. A follow-up surface exploration program involving extensive 
surface grid mapping, soil geochemistry, trenching, geophysics and diamond drilling resulted 
in the delineation of a "drill-indicated resource" of 650,000 t grading 4.40 g/t Au, 48 g/t Ag, 
and 10% barite (Poll, 1994). The resource occurs in two separate along-strike lensoidal 
bodies, the Central and South lenses. The South lens contained approximately 90% of the 
known resource. Mine production at Zacarias began in 1991 and continued until August, 
1994. Mining was conducted in a two-stage open pit-underground operation, which was 
combined with Posse ore for processing at the MJSA heap leach/CIL facility. 
 
Two potential models for the formation of mineralization at Zacarias have been proposed. 
The first is that it formed as a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit at or shortly 
after sedimentation. The strata-bound nature of the mineralization and the presence of barite 
support the VMS model. In this case, mineralization would pre-date metamorphism, and was 
Metallica's preferred model during the 1980s. The second model suggests mineralization 
occurred in a high strain zone, probably during granite emplacement. The structural setting 
and location in the roof zone of a large pluton support this mode of formation and may also 
suggest all mineralization within the district formed contemporaneously. 
 
 

23.2  Chapada - Suruca 

The Chapada deposit is currently held by Yamana Gold Inc. (Yamana), a TSX-listed 
exploration company. When Yamana acquired Chapada in July 2003, the project had an 
outlined zone of continuous copper-gold mineralization approximately 3,500 m long by 900 
m wide, with a depth of up to 220 m. The Suruca deposit lies six km north-east of Chapada 
and was discovered in 2009. 
 
The mine commenced commercial production in 2007 with a conventional copper sulphide 
flotation plant with a capacity of 16 million tonnes per annum.  The plant produces a copper - 
gold concentrate that is shipped to smelting and refining facilities. In 2010 the capacity of the 
float plant was increased to 22 million tonnes per annum and the mine plan has recently 
been updated to maintain production at this level for the next 15 years with ore from both 
Chapada and Suruca.  According to the Yamana website Suruca currently has in excess of 1 
million Oz Au in mineral reserves. 
 
Current reserves and in situ mineral resources reported by Yamana are presented in Tables 
8-2 and 8-3.

The Chapada orebody has generally a tabular shape that strikes northeast within the 
anticlinal fold that hosts the mineralization. The deposit is near surface with only minor 
saprolite cover. 
 
Some oxidation minerals are present at the bedrock-saprolite contact, but they are minor 
and are not currently considered economic. Secondary copper minerals have not been 
observed in any measurable quantity.  
 
The primary copper-gold mineralization at Chapada is epigenetic. Copper is principally 
present as chalcopyrite with minor amounts of bornite. Fine grained gold is closely 
associated with the sulphide mineralization and was likely contemporaneous with copper. 
Copper mineralization occurs as finely disseminated sulphide crystals, elongated pods, 
lenses along foliation, crosscutting stringers, and coarse clots in occasional late stage quartz 
veins or pegmatites. The copper mineralization and grade are somewhat better in the central 
zone of the deposit along the anticline axis than in the surrounding anticlinal limbs. However, 
copper mineralization is pervasive over a broad area. Gold mineralization is more uneven 
spatially and may have been remobilized by post mineral low temperature alternation events.  
 
Mineralisation occurs disseminated in a sedimentary sequence of sandstones, greywackes 
and shales, associated with biotite alteration. All mineralization is intimately associated with 
the development of biotite, and gold is intimately associated with the sulphide suite. 
Mineralization is also interpreted to postdate the peak of metamorphism, which is 
amphibolite facies. 
 
Current formation models suggest a relationship to a large tonalite batholith which outcrops 
to the north. The Posse deposit occurs in a high strain zone adjacent to the edge of this 
intrusion. Yamana and Santa Elina have noted "the Chapada deposit occurs within a 50-
kilometre long geochemical copper anomaly. The potential exists for the discovery of

additional mineralization of economic interest within the exploration licenses controlled by 
Santa Elina." 
 
 

23.3  Crixás 

The Crixás mine belongs to Mineração Serra Grande, a joint venture of Kinross and 
AngloGold Ashanti. The Crixás deposit occurs within schists, volcanics and carbonates of 
the Pilar de Goiás group which forms much of the Crixás Archaean greenstone belt. 
Although proximal to Mara Rosa, the Crixás deposit does not occur within the GMA but, 
rather, is found in older rocks. According to AngloGold's website, "gold mineralization is 
associated with massive sulphides and vein quartz material related to various schists and 
dolomites". The Mineral Reserves and Resources as of December 31st, 2009, are presented 
in Tables 8-4 and 8-5. These are based on 2 times Kinross's 50% share.

23.4  Garimpeiros Workings 

In addition to the major deposits at Posse, Zacarias and Chapada, numerous small workings 
completed by garimpeiros (independent small scale miners) occur throughout the district. 
Mineralization, which occurs within sheared sediments (mica schists) and gneisses and is 
often associated with carbonate alteration, has been reported to be of similar style to 
mineralization at Posse. 
 
Two of the larger garimpos, Bousseau and Maria Alice, are reported to be substantial for 
what was essentially hand-dug artisanal mining. Bousseau consists of a series of flooded 
pits 10 to 20 m wide over a strike length of approximately 150 to 200 metres. The largest of 
these water-filled pits is reported to have a small ramp at its bottom, leading to limited 
underground workings in the saprolite. The Maria Alice workings consisted of a group of 
three shafts with a large 20 m wide water-filled pit in between them. The pit appeared to be a 
large collapsed stope. Both garimpos had piles of unprocessed rock nearby which contained 
weakly carbonatized and/or silicified quartz muscovite schists similar in appearance to the 
rocks seen at Posse.

24.0 OTHER RELEVENT DATA AND INFORMATION 

 
The authors are not aware of any additional information relating to the mineralisation at 
Posse which is of a material nature, it is however worthwhile reviewing the progress which 
has been made in completing the recommendations made in the 2010 report. 
 

Carry out comprehensive density determinations across the Posse ore body 
using a recognised laboratory 
 

At the time of writing this work was in progress with 279samples 
submitted to the SGS Laboratory in Belo Horizonte, Brazil for 
analysis of bulk density. 

 
Resurvey the 2006 and 2008 Posse exploration holes with either a differential 
GPS or a total station survey 
 

Amarillo have acquired a DGPS unit and all historic collars which can 
be located at Posse have been surveyed. 
 

Compile all historic lithology data into a comprehensive and consistent data 
base, carry out field checking on drill core, and create lithology wireframes where 
appropriate 
 

No progress has been made on the compilation of historic data. Work 
has started on the construction of lithological wireframes. 

 
Store all exploration data in a proper data base to ensure its integrity for the long 
term 
 

No progress has been made on this recommendation 
 
Carry out a systematic check of all historic drill data that was not part of the 2008

since the start of mining by WMC in 1992 
 

Amarillo have started extensive survey work of the Posse site 
 
Continue in-fill drilling of the Posse Deposit to a nominal 70x70m grid (down dip). 
For this purpose a first pass drill hole plan has been compiled, which indicates a 
further 5,741m needs to be drilled. This will convert the majority of inferred

blocks to indicated blocks. This item will cost approximately USD1.1m but some 
additional money has been allocated in the budget for additional drilling to 
convert some indicated blocks to measured.  
 

The 2010 – 2011 drill program has achieved this objective. 
 
Future drill programs should ensure all holes are accurately surveyed and 
sampling QAQC procedures should be extended to include the use of Field 
Duplicates 
 

The drill holes completed as part of the 2010 – 2011 drilling program 
was accurately surveyed and the QAQC program included field 
duplicates from most holes. 

 
Drilling of up to eight geotechnical holes 
 

Drilling of 6 geotechnical holes as recommended by the Amarillo's 
Geotechnical consultants Coffey was completed 

 
Continuation of target generation and exploration drilling 
 

Work since mid 2010 has focused on moving the Posse project into 
and through Pre-Feasibility study.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Posse Deposit is hosted by a mylonitic shear hosted zone in a high greenschist to low 
amphibolite metamorphic terrain. The ore body strikes NE-SW and dips about 45

o
 to the 

NW. On average, the ore body is about 30m wide. Alteration is dominated by silicification, 
sericitization, K-feldspar flooding and pyritization. Gold is positively correlated with the 
intensity of silicification and total sulphide content, and occurs as 10-100 micron sized 
particles along the margins of silicates and in association with pyrite and frohbergite. 
 
The 2010-2011 drilling program was successfully completed in March 2011, resulting in an 
additional 33 holes and 8524.35 metres of drilling. 
 
It is the opinion of Mr Hoogvliet that the 2010-2011 drilling program was executed to 
adequate or higher standards, including the associated sampling, surveying, assaying and 
quality control procedures, and is of sufficient quality to be included in a 43-101 compliant 
report.  
 
The new resource, reported in this document, has established a mineral resource above a 
cutoff of 0.5 g/t Au of 24.5Mt with an average gold grade of 1.69 g/t Au containing 1.33Moz. 
This is an increase of 256,000 oz compared with the 2010 estimate (+24%). 
 
The updated resource includes Inferred, Indicated, and for the first time Measured, 
categories. The new drilling has significantly increased the confidence in the resource 
estimate with the inferred category being reduced from 42% in the 2010 estimate to 12% in 
the current estimate. 
 
The new drilling did not require major changes to the mineralization envelopes (wireframes), 
further confirming the robustness of the Posse Deposit. 
 
The exploration and mining leases held by Amarillo over the Posse Deposit appear to be up 
to date and valid. The Mining Lease Suspension is due to be renewed and Amarillo have this 
in hand. 
 
The opinion of HCS and AEFS is that the character of the Mara Rosa Property, the 
Posse deposit and the Mineral Resource Estimate reported herein is such that work to 
take the Posse Resource through Pre-Feasibility and on to Bankable Feasibility is 
recommended together with ongoing exploration on the Property.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

"The CIM Definition Standards requires the completion of a Preliminary Feasibility Study as 
the minimum prerequisite for the conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves.  
A Preliminary Feasibility Study is a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project 
that has advanced to a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground mining, 
or the pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, has been established and an effective 
method of mineral processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based 
on reasonable assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, and 
environmental factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors which are sufficient for a 
Qualified Person, acting reasonably, to determine if all or part of the Mineral Resource may 
be classified as a Mineral Reserve." 
 
This work is currently underway and a Pre-Feasibility Study is expected to be completed by 
Q4 of 2011.  The resource estimate included in this report will form the basis of that report. 
The recommendations setout below therefore assume the completion of the Pre-Feasibility 
Study and the advance of the project to Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS). 
 
To achieve a resource estimate that meets Bankable Feasibility Study standards, the 
following recommendations are made: 
 

Obtain where possible, independent down hole survey data on the MRP series 
holes completed in 2011. 
 
Ensure that any future drilling programs maintain sample QAQC charts and 
update them with each batch of samples received from the laboratory. 
 
Establish and document a clear procedure for rejecting assay results when 
QAQC results indicate a sample batch that is either suspect or out of (QAQC) 
control. 
 
Establish up to date density measurements for Waste, Hanging Wall, Main and 
Foot Wall Zones. It is understood that several hundred samples have been 
dispatched to SGS Laboratories in Belo Horizonte for density measurement. 
 
Incorporate the density determinations currently being obtained through a 
commercial laboratory into the next resource estimate 
 
Store all exploration data in a proper data base to ensure its integrity for the long 
term 
 
Compile all historic lithology data into a comprehensive and consistent data 
base, carry out field checking on drill core, and create lithology wireframes where 
appropriate.

Separately model the suspected basalt dyke that may cut through the ore body, 
or at least assess its potential to reduce or offset the mineral resource. 
 
Carry out a systematic check of all historic drill data that was not part of the 2008 
review (the "accepted" data) which, together with the results of the 2010 – 2011 
drilling was used as the base data for the current resource estimate. 
 
Follow up the magnetic susceptibility data and review if it will assist the 
interpretation. If the answer is affirmative, possibly collect magnetic susceptibility 
data on historic drill holes. 

 
To ensure that Amarillo can take the project through Pre-Feasibility and, assuming a 
favourable result from the Pre-Feasibility study, Bankable Feasibility the company has 
proposed a budget as summarised below, in Table 26.1, to cover the period from September 
2011 to December 2012. HCS and AEFS have reviewed Amarillo's proposed work program 
and budget for the Posse mine development and consider that it is appropriate.  
 

Table 26.1: Draft Budget 
Item Cost 

Environmental studies $    135,000 

Hydrology work $      80,000 

Geotechnical drilling $    860,000 

Additional exploration and resource drilling $ 1,720,000 

Pre-Feasibility Study $    600,000 

Bankable Feasibility Study $    400,000 

Metallurgical test work $    200,000 

Social impact studies and reporting $      80,000 

Land management $ 3,200,000 

Initial mine engineering $      80,000 

Total $ 7,525,000 

 
 
HCS and AEFS have reviewed Amarillo's proposed exploration program for Mara Rosa and 
believe the concept is properly conceived and justified. The opinion of HCS and AEFS is 
that the character of the Mara Rosa Property, the Posse deposit and the Mineral 
Resource Estimate it represents, and the potential for developing new mineral targets 
and expanding the current Mineral Resources are very good. Further work to take the 
Posse Resource to PreFeasibility and ongoing exploration on the Property is 
recommended.
