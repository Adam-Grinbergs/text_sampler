1.0 SUMMARY 

Western Lithium Corporation ("WLC USA") requested that AMEC Mining & Metals Inc 
("AMEC") provide an independent Qualified Person's Review and Technical Report 
("the Report") for the McDermitt Lithium Property ("the Property") located in northern 
Nevada, USA, to develop a lithium mineral resource estimate conforming to Canadian 
National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the 
Canadian Securities Administrators, and to provide the results of this work in a report 
conforming to Form 43 101F1, Technical Report. 

1.1 Geological Setting 

The Kings Valley lithium deposits occur within sedimentary and volcanosedimentary 
rocks in the moat of a resurgent caldera.  The extent and nature of the host rocks is 
well documented and understood.   

At the present time, five areas of significant lithium mineralization have been identified 
– the North Lens, North Central Lens, South Lens, South Central Lens, and PCD.  In 
each of these areas hectorite, a lithium-bearing clay mineral occurs in thick, apparently 
continuous accumulations.  The general continuity and geometry of the deposits has 
been defined by drilling in all three areas on about 500 m centers.  Drilling at PCD has 
confirmed continuity of the mineralization to as close as 50 m. 

1.2 Tenure 

Based on the records provided, AMEC concludes that WLC USA has rights to the Li 
mineralization within the PCD lens and that all appropriate permits for exploration have 
been obtained.  Those same documents indicate that the mineral tenure covering the 
other four lenses is also secure. 

1.3 Deposit Type 

To AMEC's knowledge, there are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide.  The 
hectorite deposits at Hector, California have similar mineralogy, but the geological 
setting is significantly different.   

These deposits are believed to have formed by hydrothermal alteration of layered 
volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  What is not clear is whether the alteration was 
essentially syngenetic with deposition of the sedimentary rocks or whether the 
alteration is a post depositional event.  During the site visit, AMEC observed textures

and other evidence that suggests that the alteration was post depositional, but 
additional work is required to resolve the origin of these deposits.   

1.4 Mineralization 

Mineralization consists of layered beds of lithium-bearing clay-rich volcaniclastic 
sedimentary rocks.  The beds exhibit very good geological lateral continuity over 
kilometers with drill spacings on the order of 500 m.  The thickness of mineralization 
varies from less than a meter to more than 90 m with typical intercepts of about 30 m.  
The extent of mineralization is well known.  At PCD, the continuity of the mineralization 
has been confirmed by drilling at spacings as close as 50 m.  Twin holes separated by 
10-15 m also show very good continuity of lithium grade. 

1.5 Exploration 

Exploration on WLC's lithium project consisted of geological mapping to delineate the 
limits of the moat volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and drilling to determine the grade 
and location of mineralization.  Some, if not most, of the area has been covered by 
airborne gamma ray spectrometry, but those data are not pertinent to exploration for 
lithium.  Initial exploration in the region was for Uranium; however, there is no record of 
other exploration in the PCD area.   

This report is restricted to the PCD Lens which has had sufficient drilling to produce a 
preliminary resource estimate.  A total of 70 core, reverse circulation (RC), and rotary 
holes (7,770.7 m) occur in the PCD database.  The record indicates that of the 70 
holes in the database, 25 are rotary holes (1,040.9 m), 8 are RC holes (1,798.62 m) 
and 37 are core holes (4,931.16 m).  Of these holes, all except the RC holes were 
used for the resource estimate. 

Claim surveying was performed by Tyree Surveying Company, Albuquerque, New 
Mexico and Desert Mountain Surveying Company, Winnemucca, Nevada (Chevron, 
1980).  According to Chevron (1980) both companies utilized theodolites and laser 
source electronic distance meters to survey the claims.  Records indicate that both 
companies surveyed drill collar locations and it is presumed that the same 
instrumentation was used for those locations.  WLC USA is using a Trimble differential 
GPS to survey collar locations.  These are industry standard instruments. 

AMEC is not aware of any downhole surveys for the Chevron holes.  All of the holes 
were drilled vertically and are assumed to not have deviated.  WLC USA began 
performing downhole surveys beginning with WLC-024c.  Results indicate very little 
deviation and support the assumption of verticality for previously drilled holes.

AMEC believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the 
extent and general tenor of the deposits is reasonably well known.   

1.6 Drilling 

In 1979, 34 rotary percussion holes were drilled to evaluate selected tailings disposal 
sites for anticipated uranium production.  Those holes were analyzed for lithium and 
found to contain anomalous lithium.  In 1980 and 1981, four core holes were drilled to 
obtain uncontaminated and undisturbed samples to more effectively determine lithium 
grades and coincident volcaniclastic stratigraphy.  After logging and analysis of the first 
two core holes, a portion of the core was sent to Chevron Research Company (CRC) 
for metallurgical test work.   

The record suggests that 213 rotary percussion and 15 core holes were drilled to test 
the lithium mineralization between 1980 and 1984, but that is not certain.  These drill 
procedures were standard for the industry at that time.  Rotary percussion drilling is 
not widely used today because of the likelihood of contamination of samples using this 
procedure and the difficulty of obtaining representative samples.   

During the period of 1982 through 1987, Chevron drilled 223 additional holes on 
lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the hectorite deposits 
to determine amenability of the deposits to extraction of lithium (Section 16).   

In 2007-2008, WLC USA drilled 37 core and 8 RC holes at PCD to explore that area.  
Assays of RC holes are biased significantly lower than assays of the core holes 
suggesting loss of Li to fines during the RC drilling process.  Additional work is 
required to identify the reasons for the grade bias.  RC drilling has been suspended. 

At this time, AMEC believes that the drill-hole spacing is adequate to define a minerals 
resource estimate at PCD that complies with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, 
and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (Dec. 11, 2005).   

1.7 Sampling 

Approximately 95% of the samples were between 1.52 m (5 ft) and 3.05 m (10 ft) in 
length.  The maximum sample length was 10.43 m (34 ft).  Sample intervals greater 
than 10 feet were in waste and generally not analyzed.  The minimum sample interval 
was 0.24 m (0.8 ft).  WLC USA sample intervals were limited by lithology thus the 
variable lengths are possible.  The record provided to AMEC does not contain details 
of sampling methods for rotary holes.  During that time period, a portion of the cuttings

from rotary holes were typically captured at the collar of the hole and placed in sample 
bags.  Samples were not captured in their entirety.  This type of sampling is now 
generally considered to be inappropriate for mineral exploration because the likelihood 
of contamination and the lack of proper splitting.  WLC USA has drilled three twin 
holes at PCD.  Those holes represent 12% of the total holes.  Those holes confirmed 
the location and tenor of the Li mineralization.  Chevron grades exhibit a conditional 
bias relative to the WLC USA core results.  Grades above 2,000 ppm Li were not 
biased so AMEC opted not to adjust the Chevron data. 

WLC USA has sampled on nominal 1.524 m (5 ft) intervals with modification of the 
sample interval by geological contacts.  Some longer intervals (as long as 9.1 m) are 
due to lithologies such as basalt that are unlikely to contain significant Li. 

AMEC believes that sample intervals are acceptable for resource estimation. 

1.8 Sample Preparation, Assaying, and Security 

Sample Preparation 

Few records of Chevron sample preparation procedures exist.  Hand-written notes 
indicate that core was split and one-half was archived.  The other half was crushed in 
a jaw crusher and then split "until a single representative sample bag" was obtained.  
The mass of the sample is not specified.  The remainder of the split was retained in 
labeled bags.  The record suggests that sample crushing, splitting, and bagging was 
performed by Chevron employees and that the crushed and split sample was sent to 
the analytical laboratory for final preparation and analysis.  There is no indication in the 
record that company employees were involved with final sample preparation. 

Sample preparation for rotary hole samples are presumed to be the same as for core 
samples except for splitting which would have been performed by riffle splitter. 

Chip samples from rotary holes were split and one-half retained.  The second split was 
prepared as above.   

The mass or granulometry of the final analytical split (crushed sample) is not specified 
nor has AMEC located records of those data.  

Details of crushing, splitting, and pulverization are not provided.  During the time 
covered by this exploration Cone Geochemical Inc. (the primary analytical laboratory) 
routinely dried the samples at 250oF (120oC), crushed to 10 mesh, split 150 g 
minimum with a riffle splitter, and pulverized to 150 mesh with a steel ring and puck

mill unless otherwise directed by their customer.  There is no record of deviation from 
this procedure for these samples.   

AMEC believes that sample preparation was typical for the period and that those 
procedures would be similar to current industry procedures.  AMEC has no concerns 
about sample preparation. 

WLC USA sample preparation occurs at AAL where the samples are crushed to 90% 
passing -10 mesh, splitting to 250 g, and pulverizing in "flying saucer" mill to 95% 
passing 200 mesh.   

AMEC believes that sample preparation is adequate. 

Assaying 

Assaying for both Chevron and WLC USA was accomplished using a four acid 
digestion followed by determination on an AA.  That was, and continues to be, a 
standard analytical procedure within the mineral industry. 

QA-QC 

There is little in the way of QA-QC in the record for the Chevron data.  The few 
duplicate sample data suggest that precision was adequate, but too few data exist to 
allow any significant conclusions.  Relative to current industry practices, QA-QC for the 
historical data for this project is substandard.   

WLC USA employs standard samples, pulp duplicate analyses, blank samples, and 
check assays for QA-QC.  Standard samples indicate adequate accuracy.  Duplicate 
analyses indicate acceptable precision.  Blanks are blank, indicating no significant 
contamination.  Check assays at Hazen Research confirm the AAL data.  AAL also 
analyzes each sample for Li by AA and by ICP, using different solutions.  Those 
results are very close indicating that the accuracy is likely adequate.  Standard sample 
results were used to identify analytical problems during the course of the program.  
Those problems were related to the analytical laboratory and the samples reanalyzed 
and new certificates issued. 

Sample Security 

Sample security for Chevron samples is not discussed in the project records.  AMEC 
assumes that it was typical for that time period and did not include any secure storage 
or significant chain of custody protocols.  Because of the reasonably high grade of the 
materials and the relatively low unit value, AMEC has no concerns about the integrity

Project No.:  160237 TOC 1-6  
15 December 2008 
   
 

of the sample results.  Future exploration efforts should have secure storage areas 
and chain of custody procedures in place to minimize the likelihood of tampering. 

WLC USA periodically collects core and cuttings from the drills and transports the core 
and cuttings to their office in Orovada.  There both sample types are stored in lockable 
storage facilities.  AMEC believes that the security of samples is adequate. 

1.9 Data Verification 

AMEC compiled an assay and lithology database from physical records in the 
possession of WLC.  Subsequent to that compilation, AMEC verified approximately 
50% of the assay data by comparison to original assay certificates.  Lithology data 
were taken from graphic logs.  Collar locations were provided to AMEC by WLC USA 
and were verified, where possible, against original data.   

Collar surveying for Chevron holes is believed by AMEC to have been performed by 
conventional surveying techniques that were standard at the time the holes were 
drilled.  AMEC located eight drill hole collars in the field and generally confirmed the 
locations of those holes.  AMEC has little concern about the locations of drill holes but 
recommends that the holes be resurveyed and that the conversion from local to UTM 
coordinates be verified.  WLC USA uses a Trimble GPS for surveying.  This is an 
industry standard instrument. 

AMEC collected a single large sample from the Huber Pit (mine) which was 
subsequently split into four subsamples and 21 samples from core from the archive.  
Those samples were collected, not to verify specific grades in core holes, but to 
generally confirm that the reported grades exist on the properties.   

Historical density data are lacking from the record.  Chevron used 1.8 g/cm3 for wet 
clay and 2.16 g/cm3 for dry clay but the origin of those values is not known.  WLC USA 
performed 32 density determinations that form the basis for densities assigned to rock 
types in the resource model.  Additional density data would be useful to refine the 
density values used for resource estimation. 

WLC USA drilled three core holes to twin Chevron holes.  Those holes confirmed the 
location and tenor of mineralization in the Chevron holes.  AMEC requested, and 
received, assay data directly from AAL and compared those data to the data received 
from WLC.  No discrepancies were noted.

1.10 Adjacent Properties 

There are no adjacent properties that bear on the lithium properties and there are no 
nearby operating mines.  Several gold mines are in operation several tens of miles to 
the southeast and are mentioned to illustrate that mining permits are possible in the 
area.  In the past century, a large mercury mine operated to the northeast of the lithium 
properties.  To the west of the lithium properties, uranium and gold were produced 
from small mines in the past century.  Those properties are being actively explored, 
but there is no current production.    

The Huber Pit at the north end of the lithium mineralized trend is operated sporadically 
and possibly a few tens of tons of material are produced per year, but production 
generally occurs in a short period every two or three years.   

American Colloid has a small number of claims in the area of the South Lens but those 
claims have not produced in recent times.   

1.11 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Chevron patented a process to extract lithium from hectorite.  That process was 
demonstrated to be effective, but was not economic at the prices of lithium in the mid-
1980's.  AMEC reviewed the documentation and believe that the process is viable, but 
concludes that both the process and operating cost estimates must be verified by 
additional testing.  Hazen Research completed initial testwork on samples from the 
PCD Lens confirmed the viability of the Chevron process.  Kappes Cassiday & 
Associates is currently performing additional process testwork.  

1.11.1 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

 AMEC E&C Services Limited (AMEC) completed a review of lithium exploration work 
on the Kings Valley property in Humboldt County, Nevada and has developed lithium 
mineral resource estimate for the PCD area that conforms to Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian 
Securities Administrators. 

Table 1-1 presents the mineral resource for the PCD area, Kings Valley property, at a 
base case cut-off grade of 0.20% Li.  AMEC is of the opinion that exploration potential 
exist at the Kings Valley property to increase the resource.

1.11.2 Marketing 

AMEC briefly reviewed the possibility of marketing Li and Li-bearing clays.  Li would 
most likely be marked as Li2CO3 which is used in batteries, lubricants, cosmetics, and 
myriad other products.  According to Roskill (2007), the market has been expanding in 
recent years and will likely continue to expand.  Recent price increases suggest that 
supply is not keeping pace with demand.  This suggests that lithium produced from this 
project would be marketable.  

Hectorite is used for high-temperature drilling fluids and other specialty clay 
applications.  It has a relatively high value per tonne, but it is marketable in small 
quantities. 

WLC USA has performed a number of marketing studies, most of which are 
confidential, and have concluded that there is a market for Li and Li-bearing products. 

AMEC concludes that markets exist for the commodities that could be produced from 
these properties. 

1.12 Recommendations 

1.13 Drilling 

Additional infill drilling will be required for prefeasibility-level resource estimation.  
Drilling is adequate for estimation of resources at PCD and for a preliminary economic 
assessment of those resources once more information is available regarding process 
flow sheets and process operating costs.

1.14 Database verification 

AMEC recommends that additional dry density data be acquired to better refine 
density estimates for each rock type.  Those data should be determined using a wax-
coat, immersion procedure.     

1.15 Processing 

AMEC recommends that metallurgical testwork continue in order to finalize the 
process flowsheet and to quantify estimated process operating costs.  This work is in 
progress at both Hazen Research, Golden, Colorado, and Kappes Cassiday & 
Associates, Reno, Nevada. 

1.16 Marketing Study 

AMEC recommends that WLC USA continue to investigate the lithium carbonate 
market and lithium clays.   

1.17 Additional Exploration 

At the present time, exploration at the PCD deposit is sufficient to produce a mineral 
resource estimate that complies with CIM Definition Standards.  Upon completion of 
the resource estimate and a positive marketing study, a preliminary economic 
assessment of the PCD resource (termed a Preliminary Assessment under NI 43-101) 
would be the next step with the currently available drilling information.  A Preliminary 
Assessment may be followed by additional drilling, metallurgy and preliminary 
engineering designs to bring the project to prefeasibility level.  Additional drilling may 
be required to fill gaps in the drill pattern to upgrade the resource to Indicated.   

1.18 Proposed Budget 

Table 1-2 presents a proposed budget that would advance the project to the stage of 
Prefeasibility assessment.  Additional engineering studies may follow the successful 
completion of a Prefeasibility Assessment but AMEC has not proposed a budget for 
these because the characteristics of the project for more advanced engineering 
studies will not be determined until a Prefeasibility Assessment is completed.

2.1 Introduction 

Western Lithium Corporation (WLC) commissioned AMEC E&C Services Limited 
(AMEC) to review exploration work completed on the Kings Valley property (the 
Property) in Humboldt County, Nevada USA (Figure 2-1), to develop a lithium mineral 
resource estimate conforming to Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and to provide the results of this work in a report 
conforming to Form 43 101F1, Technical Report.  WLC is a Canadian based resource 
company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and operates in the United States as 
WLC USA. 

AMEC understands that this report may be filed by WLC with Canadian securities 
regulators.  One of the purposes of this report is to develop and report a NI 43-101 
compliant Lithium mineral resource estimate on the Kings Valley project that will be 
suitable to support a future Preliminary Assessment as defined under NI 43-101. 

Information for the Technical Report was obtained from work completed by AMEC at 
the project site, at WLC's offices in Reno, Nevada; at AMEC's offices in Phoenix, 
Arizona and Sparks, Nevada; materials provided by, and discussions with, WLC USA 
personnel; and from previous technical reports on the Kings Valley property. 

Sections of the Technical Report on history, geologic setting, deposit types, 
mineralization, and exploration were in part derived from a previous NI 43-101 
technical report on the Kings Valley property.   

The Qualified Persons responsible for preparation of the Technical Report include 
Mark Hertel, PG, MAusIMM, AMEC Principal Geologist and Ted Eggleston, Ph.D.,

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Mineral Tenure 

WLC USA has leased the Lith and Neutron Claims from Western Energy Development 
Corporation for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation.  Figure 4-1 shows 
the location of the Lith and Neutron Claims which cover the prospective lithium areas.  
The claims are detailed in Table 4-1.  The PCD Lens is entirely included within the 
Neutron Claims, 320 claims covering an area of 6,400 acres.  The Lith claims, 1,049 
claims, cover an area of 20,980 acres.  

The lease agreement, signed on 20 Dec 2007, grants WLC USA exclusive rights to 
explore for develop, and mine or otherwise produce, any and all lithium deposits 
discovered on the claims subject to royalty payments described below.  Lithium 
deposits include, but are not limited to, deposits of amblygonite, eucryptite, hectorite, 
lepidolite, petalite, spodumene, and bentonitic clays which are all lithium-bearing 
minerals.  Rights to all other mineral types, including base and precious metals, 
uranium, vanadium, and uranium or vanadium-bearing materials or ores are expressly 
reserved by Western Energy Development Corp.  The term of the lease agreement is 
30 years.  There are no known economically significant base and precious metals, 
uranium vanadium, and uranium or vanadium-bearing materials coincident with the Li 
deposits on the Lith and Neutron claims based on recent exploration performed by 
WLC USA. 

Under the terms of the lease, WLC USA will pay Western Energy Development 
Corporation the Minimum Payments summarized in Table 4-2. 

The foregoing minimum payments will constitute advance payments of the royalty 
which shall be cumulatively credited in WLC's favor against its royalty payment 
obligations.  WLC USA is required to pay Western Energy Development Corporation a 
production royalty for the production of minerals from the property.  The royalty shall 
consist of a net smelter returns royalty equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the 
net smelter returns and a net profits royalty equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) 
of the net profits from the production. 

The lease grants WLC USA the exclusive right to purchase the unpatented mining 
claims which comprise a designated discovery, subject to the royalty and other rights 
reserved by Western Energy Development Corporation and subject to WLC's 
obligations under the deed executed and delivered by Western Energy Development 
Corporation on the closing of the option.

Project No.:  160237 Page 4-2  
15 December 2008 

WLC USA is obligated by the lease agreement to perform all work and to pay any and 
all fees required for maintenance of the claims under U.S. mining law beginning with 
the annual assessment work period of September 1, 2008, to September 1, 2009.  All 
required legal filings are the responsibility of WLC. 

4.2 Claim Status 

A letter from Erwin & Thompson LLP dated 31 July 2007 to Pamela Klessig, President 
of Western Energy Development Corporation and others, on the status of the claims 
concludes that the Federal annual claim maintenance fees for the annual assessment 
year from September 1, 2006 to September 1, 2007 were properly paid and that no 
legal actions were pending in the courts against the owners of the property.  

4.3 Permitting 

Western Energy provided AMEC with all documents relating to permitting for the 
lithium exploration AMEC reviewed Western Energy's Notice of Intent to conduct 
lithium exploration on federal lands submitted to the Winnemucca Field Office of the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management (dated 29 May 2007).  The letter response from the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management, dated 26 June, 2007, and signed by Dave Hayes, 
Assistant Field Manager Nonrenewable Resources, Winnemucca Field Office, 
indicated that the Notice of Intent was complete and that other permits were not 
required because the area of disturbance is less than 5 acres.  That letter required that 
Western Energy have a cultural resources study performed and acknowledgement that 
the required financial guarantee was accepted for the project prior to beginning work 
on the project.  A letter from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management dated 3 October 
2007 signed by Dave Hayes, Assistant Field Manager Nonrenewable Resources, 
Winnemucca Field Office, acknowledged receipt and acceptance of the cultural survey 
and permitted operations as soon as the financial security was received.  Financial 
security was acknowledged in a letter from the State of Nevada Commission on 
Mineral Resources Division of Minerals dated 5 September 2007 signed by Doug 
Driesner, Deputy Administrator, for Alan R. Conyer, Administrator.  The letter indicates 
that copies were sent to the appropriate U.S. BLM Field Offices.  AMEC was also 
provided with the Surface Management Personal Bond Rider form OMB No.1004-0194 
detailing Surface Management Bond No. NVB-000493, and a receipt for the total 
amount of the bond. 

4.4 Conclusions 

AMEC has reviewed the lease and Erwin & Thompson documents and concludes, 
based on the lease agreement and the expert findings in the Erwin & Thompson letter

that these documents provide a reasonable basis to support WLC USA's statements 
on their legal right to explore for and exploit any and all lithium deposits discovered on 
the Lith and Neutron claims and WLC USA's statement that those claims are in force 
under the U.S. mining law.  AMEC's review of the permitting documents supports WLC 
USA's statements that they have all of the required permits for exploration.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The WLC USA's Kings Valley lithium project is located in Humboldt County in remote 
northern Nevada, approximately 100 km north-northwest of Winnemucca and 40 km 
west-northwest of Orovada, Nevada.  The area is sparsely populated ranching land.  
Some of the property is very near the border with Oregon.  Access to the project is via 
paved road (U.S. Highway 95) north from Winnemucca to Orovada and then west on 
paved state highway 293 to the project area.  Local access is via numerous gravel and 
dirt roads.   

Northern Nevada has a high desert climate with cold winters and hot summers.  
Elevations are 1,225 to 2,150 m (4,000 to 7,000 feet).  Snow is expected from October 
to May, although it may melt quickly.  Nearby mining operations operate continuously 
through the winter.  Vegetation consists of sagebrush and grasslands at all elevations.   

Because of the large-scale gold mining industry in the Winnemucca area, local 
resources include all of the amenities required for large-scale mining.  The area is 
about 50 km north of the now depleted Sleeper gold mine and 100 km northwest of 
Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge, and Getchell gold mines.  Several other gold and 
copper mines are in the area providing an experienced work force and adequate 
support for mining operations.  Although the workforce in the area is knowledgeable 
about mining, most of the workers may have to be sourced in Winnemucca because of 
the sparse population in the project area.   

Adequate electrical power is available, but power lines may need to be added and/or 
upgraded to provide power to the project site.  Roads are in generally good repair and 
are all season roads but may be closed for short periods due to extreme weather in the 
winter.  The nearest railroad access is in Winnemucca.

6.0 HISTORY 

The following history to 1980 is taken from Glanzman and Winsor (1982).  Post 1980 
history is taken largely from the data provided to AMEC.  AMEC is not aware of any 
reports that discuss the post-1980 history of the project that are specific to lithium 
exploration and development.  MDA (2005) mentions the lithium prospects in passing. 

Chevron began exploration for uranium in the McDermitt caldera area in 1975.  In 
September 1977, personnel of the U.S. Geological Survey alerted Chevron to the 
presence of anomalous concentrations of lithium associated with volcaniclastic moat 
sediments within the McDermitt caldera.  In September and October of that same year, 
418 additional lode claims were staked over the mapped extent of moat sediments that 
paralleled Chevron's original uranium claim block.  Drill cuttings from rotary percussion 
drill holes drilled in September on radiometric anomalies were also analyzed for 
lithium.  One hundred and forty feet of hole number MJB-7-4 averaged 0.278% Li; 
eighty five feet of MJB-7-5 averaged 0.236% Li.  These results confirmed the presence 
of significant lithium hosted by a massive, green claystone within the moat sediment 
section. 

In 1978, Chevron's activities focused on the uranium resource hosted by volcanic 
rocks in the caldera.  In 1979, 34 rotary percussion holes were drilled to evaluate 
selected tailings disposal sites for anticipated uranium production (Table 6-1).  Those 
holes were drilled to test the thickness of the clays, to obtain samples of the clay for 
engineering analysis, and to further investigate the lithium resource potential.  Results 
were encouraging with respect to the level and consistency of the lithium contained by 
the clays.

In 1980 and 1981, four core holes were drilled to obtain uncontaminated and 
undisturbed samples to more effectively determine lithium grades and coincident

volcaniclastic stratigraphy.  After logging and analysis of the first two core holes, a 
portion of the core was sent to Chevron Research Company (CRC).  CRC was 
charged with finding an economic process for extracting lithium from the clays.   

During the period of 1982 through 1987, Chevron drilled an additional 223 holes on 
lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the hectorite ores to 
determine amenability of the ores to extraction of lithium (Section 16).  Approximately 
370 auger holes were drilled during the project (Table 6-2).  From the record, the holes 
are 1 to 3 m deep and each was sampled only once.  Each of these holes was drilled 
and analyzed for lithium in 1982, based on the assay certificates.  These holes appear 
to have been drilled for geochemical exploration purposes, since there is no record of 
the reason that these holes were drilled.

In 1985, Chevron produced polygonal estimates of the Li resources on their properties 
at Kings Valley (Table 6-3).  A cutoff grade of 0.25% Li, minimum thickness of 5 feet 
(1.52 m), and a minimum 9.0 ft% Grade x Thickness (GT) were used for the estimate.  
The tonnage factor used was 17.8 ft3/short ton (1.8 g/cm3).  This estimate is not 
compliant with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (2005) as required by NI 43-101 and is included here for historical 
purposes only.  Because of the lack of documentation of criteria used to classify the 
historical estimate, AMEC is unable to compare the categories used by Chevron to 
current CIM Definition Standards and has thus not reported the tons and grade of the 
deposits in this report.  Table 6-3 summarizes the parameters used for the estimate.

Chevron leased many of the claims that comprised the lithium project to the J. M. 
Huber Corporation (Huber) in 1986.  From the record, it appears that not all of the 
claims were leased.  In 1991, Chevron, U.S.A., sold their interest in the claims to 
Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation.  In 1992, Huber terminated the lease.  In 1992, it 
appears that Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation allowed the claims to lapse and 
provided much of the exploration data to Jim LaBret, one of the claim owners from 
which they had leased claims. 

From 1992 to 2005, there is no record of any activities on the project. 

Western Energy Development Corp., a Nevada corporation, leased LaBret's claims in 
2005 at which time, LaBret provided Western Energy Development Corp. access to 
the Chevron data and to core and other samples that were available.  In 2005, 
Western Energy Development Corp. staked 1634 federal lode claims covering the area 
that are prospective for Li and subsequently dropped 320 claims over the area with 
1314 claims remaining active.  Those claims cover much the same area as the original 
Chevron Claims.  Western Energy Development Corp. compiled the Chevron 
exploration data and undertook preliminary marketing studies during 2007. 

In 2007, Western Lithium Corp. ("WLC USA"), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated 
for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation.  Western Energy Development 
Corp. provided the Chevron exploration data and access to available geological 
materials to WLC USA as part of a lease agreement for the properties described in 
Section 4 between the two companies.  Those data form the basis for this report.   

From late 2007 to May 2008, WLC USA completed 37 core holes (4,861.98 m) and 8 
reverse circulation (RC) (1,798.63 m) holes in the PCD lens (Table 6-4).  WLC USA 
also began additional metallurgical testing at Hazen Research.  The metallurgical 
testing has not been completed at the time of this report however; an interim report 
confirms the technical feasibility of the Chevron process.  WLC USA performed a 
mineralogical study of the mineralization in 2008 (Hudson, 2008).  That study

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geological Setting 

The Kings Valley lithium project is located in the McDermitt Caldera, a well preserved 
Miocene collapse structure in north-western Nevada and southern Oregon (Figure 7-1; 
Glanzman and Winsor, 1982).  Because of the good exposures and preservation of the 
caldera complex, the area has been the focus of significant research activity over 
several decades by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The USGS has produced a 
number of maps and other reports on the area.  Some of those reports were used in 
preparation of this report (Glanzman, et al, 1978; Rytuba and Glanzman, 1979).  The 
author is personally acquainted with Rytuba and others from the USGS that worked in 
the area and believes that the reports are of sufficient quality to be used as a basis for 
discussion of the geological setting of the area.   

Volcanic activity began approximately 27 million years ago with eruption of interlayered 
basaltic, andesitic, and dacitic flows and tuffs.  The volcanic units were deposited on 
basement of Cretaceous granitic rocks with significant topographical relief.  Explosive 
rhyolitic volcanism began approximately 18.7 million years ago and resulted in 
formation of a number of extensive ignimbrites (ash flow tuffs) and resultant, nested 
calderas.  The rhyolites of the McDermitt caldera are anomalous in Li and Hg and 
slightly anomalous in U when compared to average rhyolite.  Li reaches 300 ppm in 
both ignimbrites and glassy tuffs, approximately six times greater than average 
rhyolite.  Volcanic activity concluded by resurgence of the central part of the caldera, 
intrusion of rhyolite into the ring fracture zones around the caldera, and formation of a 
"moat" between the topographic wall of the caldera and resurgent dome in the center 
of the caldera.  This moat then filled with volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks in a 
lacustrine environment.  

Rytuba and Glanzman (1979) provide the following summary of the geology of the 
McDermitt Caldera: 

"The caldera complex is developed on a terrane of Mesozoic granodiorite 
and Cenozoic basalt, andesite and dacite flows.  The mafic and 
intermediate lavas were erupted 24 to 18 m.y. ago and have a total 
thickness of 420 m in the northern part of the complex.  Rocks of equivalent 
age in the south are dominantly dacite and andesite with a total thickness of 
greater than 150 m.  Reconstruction of the Miocene surface in relation to 
eruption of flows at the end of volcanic activity shows that a structural 
depression existed in the area now occupied by the complex.  This 
depression may have formed because of the large volume of erupted

magma; within this basin, local deposits of clastic and tuffaceous rock 
accumulated." 

"Explosive rhyolitic volcanism began with eruptions of a large-volume ash-
flow tuff sheet.  The sheet is a simple cooling unit with a maximum 
thickness of 230 m in the Double-H Mountains.  To the north, the unit thins 
to 70 m in the vicinity of Hoppin Peaks and is absent in the Oregon portion 
of the complex.  " 

Chemical analysis of the unit showed that it is peralkaline rhyolite.  Between 18 and 
15.8 Ma, four additional large-volume ash-flow tuff sheets were erupted.  Most were 
peralkaline rhyolites with a total thickness of approximately 560 m.  Each of these ash-
flow tuff eruptions caused caldera collapse which formed a complex of nested 
calderas.  The best preserved caldera is located in the extreme southern part of the 
complex and is informally known as the Calavera caldera which is nearly circular and 
approximately 18 km across.  The Long Ridge caldera (informal name) is another well-
preserved caldera is located in the northernmost part of the complex.  This caldera is 
approximately 27 km across.  Each of these calderas resurged so that a resurgent 
dome formed within the caldera.  This caused a general uplift of the center of the 
complex (Figure 7-2) which, in turn, formed a depression (moat) between the 
resurgent dome and the topographic wall of the caldera.  That moat then filled with 
volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and some volcanic rocks.  Hydrothermal alteration of 
the volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks or other processes produced hectorite and 
possibly other lithium-bearing minerals within the moat sediments.

7.2 Local Geological Setting 

WLC USA's Kings Valley lithium project is divided into five general areas, the North 
Lens, North Central Lens, South Lens, South Central Lens, and PCD areas (Figure 7-
3).  Only the PCD Lens is of consequence for this report.  The important rock type is a 
lithium-rich claystone that may be the product of intense hydrothermal alteration of

volcaniclastic rocks or the product of clay formation in the bottom of an alkaline lake 
(See section 8 for a more complete description of origin). 

7.2.1 PCD Lens 

The PCD lens is the southernmost mineralized lens in the area and appears to be the 
smallest of the known mineralized areas.  The PCD lens comprises relatively unaltered 
volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstones which are the dominant rock types (Figure 7-4)  
Lithium-rich beds are generally 1 to 10 m thick with some areas (holes PC-84-21 and 
PC-84-24) where the mineralization is more than 60 m thick at economically interesting 
grades.  Colluvium as thick as 10 m covers much of the area.  Recent drilling by WLC 
USA shows that the average thickness of Li mineralization is much thicker than 
indicated by Chevron data because many of the Chevron holes stopped in 
mineralization.  A zone of mineralization greater than 50 m thick trends southwest-
northeast across the area (Figure 7-5). 

7.2.2 Discussion 

The regional geological setting of these deposits is quite well known and very well 
understood.  The local geological setting and degree of local lithium grade variations 
are adequately known for the PCD area to allow preliminary resource estimation.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Kings Valley lithium deposits are part of a small group of deposits of a Li-rich clay 
mineral known as hectorite.  Hectorite was named for its first known source, the Hector 
Mine, 34 miles (55 km) east of Barstow in San Bernardino California.  This is the only 
hectorite deposit currently known to be in production; however, other small producers 
may sporadically mine hectorite.  The production is used primarily for specialty clay 
products.  Lithium is not extracted from the clays from Hector.   

The Hector deposit occurs along a northwest-trending fault zone for about 5 miles (8 
km).  It overlies a series of andesitic volcanic rocks of presumed Pliocene age (Harben 
and Bates, 1984).  This volcanic sequence consists of lava flows with interbedded 
agglomerate and tuff.   

Hectorite is the dominant clay mineral in an altered series of volcanic ash beds 
interbedded with lake sediments and a series of hot springs deposited cherty 
travertines (Sweet, 1980).  These vitric tuff beds were deposited in and along a 
travertine ridge crest and in the northwest trending shallow trough parallel with a fault-
terrace shoreline bordering the lake to the northeast.  The tuff beds in the upper series 
of lake sediments are interbedded with mudstones and claystones and have been 
altered to clay minerals or zeolites.  To the northeast and adjacent to the deposit, 
significant amounts of colemanite (borates) exist at depth in an evaporite section 
consisting of rhythmic laminations of anhydrite, clay, and calcite, and beds of 
claystone. 

The hectorite-rich beds are 1.8 to 2.4 m (6 to 8 ft) in thickness.  

The Hector deposit parallels an active major northwest-trending strike-slip fault zone.  
Mudstones and claystones overlying the deposit were partially eroded during a period 
of post-depositional faulting and warping.  This exposed the more resistant travertine 
limestone beds as a ridge-like outcrop that is higher than the alluvial gravels overlying 
the lake sediments.  A recent olivine basalt flow parallels the limestone ridge, fills a 
fault zone trough for approximately seven miles, and almost completely covers the 
hectorite deposit.   

Harben and Bates (1984) suggest that the Hector deposits were formed when 
Pliocene (?) tuff and volcanic ash were deposited in a restricted alkaline lake 
environment on and adjacent to travertine which was forming by hot springs emanating 
along the fault.  The tuff was initially converted to clinoptilolite which, in turn, was 
altered to hectorite by hot springs waters rich in Li and F.

AMEC is aware of one or two similar, but poorly documented, hectorite deposits in 
California and Nevada.  AMEC is not aware of any Li production from any of these 
deposits. 

Although no work has been reported on the genesis of the Kings Valley deposits, the 
geology suggests that the deposits occur over the ring fracture zone of the caldera 
complex.  Post volcanic intrusions along those fractures likely powered hydrothermal 
cells that formed the deposits.  Hydrothermal solutions ascended through the volcanic 
section along the ring fractures and other faults and passed through the volcanic 
section and into the lacustrine environment of the moat.  These ascending fluids 
extracted lithium from the rhyolitic ash flow tuffs and the volcaniclastic sediments that 
immediately overlie the rhyolites.  Glanzman and Winsor (1982) suggest that the fluids 
were deposited into the moat where a lithium-rich gel formed within the lake and 
precipitated as a statabound, massive layer of Li-rich claystone.  Thin intervals of 
volcaniclastic sediments were deposited below, within, and above this claystone.  
Another possibility is that the Li-bearing clays were the product of alteration of in situ, 
clay-rich horizons by the hydrothermal fluids as they traversed the geological column.   

Additional work is required to determine the origin of these deposits, but AMEC logged 
core from holes FJ-81-1c and FJ-81-2c and found armored and accretionary lapilli in 
both holes, especially FJ-81-1c.  Armored and accretionary lapilli indicate that the 
rocks are the product of nearby explosive volcanic eruptions, and that they have not 
been significantly transported by sedimentary processes.  These rocks are altered and 
locally contain elevated Li which suggest to AMEC that the rocks were deposited and 
then altered by hydrothermal fluids.  The timing of the alteration is an open question; 
did it occur during and immediately after deposition or was there a significant time 
interval after deposition before alteration commenced?  Fine-grained volcanic and 
volcaniclastic material was converted to hectorite-bearing clay beds by that 
hydrothermal event.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

9.1 Introduction 

The primary mineral of interest is hectorite; a trioctahedral smectite clay, that contains 
variable amounts of lithium.  The general formula is Na0.3(Mg, Li)3Si4O10(F,OH)2 where 
Li substitutes for Mg in the lattice.  Hectorite is associated with calcite (CaCO3), 
dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) and analcime (a zeolite group mineral (NaAlSi2O6·(H2O)).  The 
clay in which the hectorite occurs is generally light- to dark-green or brown depending 
on the oxidation state of the iron in the clay (Glanzman et al, 1978).  The clay that 
occurs in the tuffaceous sediments is chiefly montmorillonite.  No other clays have 
been identified by whole rock X-ray diffraction.  Hectorite and montmorillonite are both 
considered to be "bentonite" which expands significantly when it is exposed to water.  
Hectorite is used in applications where high temperatures are encountered because it 
is more stable at high temperatures than montmorillonite.   

In the McDermitt Caldera complex, Glanzman et al (1989) state that hectorite is 
associated with three distinct zeolite alteration assemblages: relatively unaltered 
volcanic glass, clinoptilolite-feldspar, and analcime-K-feldspar.  These zones 
correspond, in a general way, to the amount of lithium enrichment in the clays.  Clay in 
the glassy sediments generally contains the least amount of lithium, clinoptilolite-
feldspar contains an intermediate amount, and analcime-K-feldspar contains the 
highest concentrations.  Analysis of unaltered rocks indicates an original average Li 
concentration of 230 ppm (Rytuba and Glanzman, 1979).  During zeolitization of the 
rocks, lithium was depleted in the alteration zones of erionite, clinoptilolite, and 
mordenite and concentrated in the alteration zones of analcime and K-feldspar. 

Clay beds in the volcanic glass are generally thin with an aggregate thickness of less 
than 0.3 m.  The volcanic glass is generally white to gray and many meters thick.  
Lithium is generally less than 0.07%, but is as high as 0.34% locally.  The most 
abundant glassy sediments are along the southern limit of the caldera. 

The clinoptilolite-feldspar zone occurs in the fluviatile-lacustrine series principally on 
the northern rim of the caldera.  Clay beds in these sediments are generally thicker 
than clay beds in the volcanic glass, commonly as thick as 0.6 m.  The clay is dark 
brown or green in color and is thinly laminated to massive.  Grades are commonly on 
the order of 0.1 to 0.2% Li with local areas to 0.4% Li.   

Near the western edge of the caldera, the clinoptilolite-feldspar zone and the analcime-
K-feldspar zone overlap.  This zone produces grades on the order of 0.1 to 0.2% Li.

The analcime-K-feldspar zone occurs along the western edge of the caldera.  Here 
clay beds are as much as 30 m or more thick and contain as much as 0.65% Li.  This 
is the area under consideration by WLC USA.  Here the rocks consist of multiple Li-
bearing clay beds.  These beds are reasonably well indurated and uniformly light to 
dark green.  Calcite and gypsum form veinlets, clots, and nodules.  Box-form vugs may 
be casts of halite crystals.   

Petrography indicates that K-feldspar pseudomorphically replaces analcime and that 
the rock was initially altered to analcime and then to K-feldspar.  Pyrite is a ubiquitous 
gangue mineral and secondary quartz is common. 

The age of the Li deposits is likely about 15.7 Ma which is the date obtained for the 
mercury mineralization at the McDermitt Mine by Noble et al (1988).  

9.1.1 PCD Lens 

The PCD Lens is the southernmost lens in the area of interest.  The mineralized area 
is about three km east-west and 2 km north south (4109000 to 413000 E; 4616500 to 
4618500N) (Figure 9-2).  The mineralization is continuous over significant areas and 
appears to be thicker than other areas based on recent drilling (see Figure 7-5).  Three 
to twelve meters of colluvium cover much of the deposit.  Drill density is about 250 m 
(Figure 9-3), with local areas where drill spacings are about 50 m.  Recent drilling 
confirms hole-to-hole and section-to-section correlations.  According to the available 
records, five of the 26 Chevron holes in this area did not penetrate past the colluvium, 
thus there are significant questions about the presence of mineralization in the area 
represented by the holes that did not penetrate the colluvium.  All WLC USA holes 
encountered mineralization and most penetrated through the mineralization.  The 
average grade for intercepts greater than 1,000 ppm is about 2,300 ppm with 
maximum grades in excess of 5,000 ppm Li. 

9.1.2 Discussion 

Mineralization at PCD consists of hectorite replacing volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  
The South Lens is the highest grade and possibly the most continuously mineralized 
area with the North Lens being the largest, but lowest grade deposit.  PCD is the 
smallest area of the five identified by Chevron and is locally covered by colluvium.  
PCD contains significant shallow, high-grade (>3,500 ppm Li) mineralization in zones 
that appear to correlate well from hole-to-hole and section-to-section.  Assuming that 
Li can be extracted economically, the PCD area would likely be the best area to begin 
production because of the grade, low strip ratio, and proximity to infrastructure.

10.0 EXPLORATION 

Exploration on WLC USA's lithium project has consisted of geological mapping to 
delineate the limits of the moat volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and drilling to 
determine the grade and location of mineralization.  Some, if not most, of the area has 
been covered by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, but those data are not pertinent to 
exploration for lithium.  There is no record of other exploration in the area.   

Section 6 History discusses the drilling in detail.  A total of 283 core, RC, and rotary 
holes (25,781.8 m) occur in the database.  Records indicate that 268 holes were drilled 
specifically to evaluate the lithium mineralization.  The record is not entirely clear, but it 
appears that of the 283 holes in the database, 223 are rotary holes (18,136.2 m), 52 
are core holes (5,731.11 m) based on the "c" suffix on drill hole names, and 8 are 
reverse circulation holes (1,798.62 m).  In addition to those holes, 370 auger holes 
(902.5 m) were drilled.  The reason for the auger holes is yet to be discovered.   

Claim surveying for the Chevron holes was performed by Tyree Surveying Company, 
Albuquerque, New Mexico and Desert Mountain Surveying Company, Winnemucca, 
Nevada (Chevron, 1980).  According to Chevron (1980) both companies utilized 
theodolites and laser source electronic distance meters to survey the claims.  Records 
indicate that both companies surveyed drill collar locations and it is presumed that the 
same instrumentation was used for those locations.  The reported error was within 0.5 
ft horizontally and 1.0 ft vertically. 

Collar surveying for the 2007-2008 drill program was conducted by WLC USA using a 
Trimble GPS.  The NAD 83 global reference system is used.  WLC USA compared the 
locations of several points surveyed by Chevron and found that the easting and 
northing coordinates were more or less identical.  The elevation; however, was found 
to have a systematic difference of 10.2 feet (3.11 m).  As a result, 10.2 feet (3.11 m) 
was subtracted from the GPS elevations to conform to the older surveys. 

Beginning with hole WLC-024c, WLC USA performed downhole surveys on all holes.  
Those data indicate that there is little deviation of the holes from vertical supporting the 
assumption of verticality of previously drilled holes. 

AMEC believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the 
extent and tenor of the deposits is reasonably well known.  The data are adequate at 
this time to support inferred and indicated mineral resource categories, but additional 
drilling may be required to adequately define the local stratigraphy and grade of the 
deposits in order to improve the confidence of the mineral resource estimate.

11.0 DRILLING 

11.1 Drilling 

Cuttings from rotary percussion drill holes drilled in September, 1977, on radiometric 
anomalies were analyzed for lithium.  That work revealed that 43.9 m (144 ft) of hole 
MJB-7-4 averaged 0.28% Li and that 25.9 m (85 ft) of MJB-7-5 averaged 0.24% Li.  
These results confirmed the presence of economically interesting grades of lithium 
hosted by a massive, green claystone within the moat sediment section. 

In 1979, 34 rotary percussion holes were drilled to evaluate selected tailings disposal 
sites for anticipated uranium production (Table 6-1).  Those holes were drilled to test 
the thickness of the clays, to obtain samples of the clay for engineering analysis, and 
to further investigate the lithium resource potential.  Results were encouraging with 
respect to the level and consistency of the lithium contained by the clays. 

In 1980 and 1981, four core holes were drilled to obtain uncontaminated and 
undisturbed samples to more effectively determine lithium grades and coincident 
volcaniclastic stratigraphy.  After logging and analysis of the first two core holes, a 
portion of the core was sent to Chevron Research Company (CRC) for metallurgical 
test work.   

During the period of 1982 through 1987, Chevron drilled 223 additional holes on 
lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the hectorite deposits 
to determine amenability of the ores to extraction of lithium (Section 16).  
Approximately 370 auger holes were drilled sometime during the project (Table 6-2).  
The holes are 1 to 3 m deep and each was sampled only once.  Assay certificates 
indicate that these holes were analyzed for lithium in 1982.  They were likely drilled 
during 1982.  These holes appear to have been drilled for geochemical exploration 
purposes, but there is no record of the reason that these holes were drilled. 

A total of 283 holes appear in the database and 227 have lithium assay data.  There 
are indications that an additional six holes were drilled, but there are no locations for 
those holes.  The record indicates that 213 rotary percussion and 15 core holes were 
drilled to test the lithium mineralization between 1980 and 1984.  These drill 
procedures were standard for the industry at that time.  A total of 37 core and 8 RC 
holes have been drilled by WLC USA in the PCD area during 2007-2008 (Figure 11-1). 

Rotary percussion drilling has been found to be somewhat problematical where 
samples are to be collected from the cuttings and subsequently geochemically 
analyzed.  Contamination is a problem that can not be confidently overcome.  In this 
case, there is little chance that significant contamination of samples will occur during

the drilling process.  The grades of the material and the fact that it appears to be 
uniformly distributed throughout the mineralized interval suggest that contamination 
may not be a problem.  Twin holes should be drilled to investigate the possibility of 
contamination.  Drilling is in progress on the PCD Lens and three of the 26 holes have 
been twinned.   

For most deposits, core drilling provides superior geological information and quality of 
sample over percussion methods.  Core drilling is recommended by AMEC for these 
deposits.  Although reverse circulation (RC) drilling can reduce drilling costs, at PCD, 
RC drilling has been shown to produce biased assay results.  WLC USA has 
suspended RC drilling.  The core reviewed by AMEC was HQ (63.5 mm) diameter. 

WLC USA has recovered some of the historical core and has been in the process of 
re-logging that core.  The core was stored at a local prospector's home (Jim LaBret) 
and the total amount of core that is preserved is not known at this time.  AMEC 
reviewed two holes that were drilled in the North Lens.  In those holes, half of the core 
is retained except for the very high-grade zones which were consumed by Chevron 
and the U.S. Geological Survey for metallurgical and other testing. 

11.2 Logging 

Chevron core was collected from the drills twice a day and descriptively logged by 
geologists at Chevron's field camp.  Chip samples from rotary drills were logged at the 
drill.  Two composite samples were collected every five feet and bagged.  The 
geologist logging the hole made a chip board at the drill site.  The chip boards 
consisted of drill cuttings glued to a 1" x 4" board whose vertical scale was 1 in = 10 ft.  
Lithological logging of both core and chip samples stressed lithologic units, their 
contacts, mineralization, alteration and brecciation. 

WLC USA core is collected at the end of each shift and transported back to the 
Orovada field office.  Core is cleaned and logged for lithology, oxidation, alteration, 
and core recovery.  All core samples are stored in a lockable steel storage container.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Table 12-1 summarizes the sample lengths at PCD.  Approximately 95% of the 
samples were between 1.52 m (5 ft) and 3.05 m (10 ft) in length.  The maximum 
sample length was 10.43 m (34 ft).  Sample intervals greater than 10 feet were in 
waste and generally not analyzed.  The minimum sample interval was 0.24 m (0.8 ft).  
WLC USA sample intervals were limited by lithology thus the variable lengths are 
possible.

The documentation provided to AMEC does not contain details of sampling methods 
for rotary holes.  During that time period, a portion of the cuttings from rotary holes 
were typically captured at the collar of the hole and placed in sample bags.  Samples 
were not captured in their entirety.  Contamination was likely.  The samples were then 
sent to the sample preparation facility.  This type of sampling is now generally 
considered to be inappropriate for mineral exploration other than uranium because the 
likelihood of contamination and the lack of proper splitting.  Open hole rotary drilling is 
appropriate for uranium because downhole spectrometers are typically used to 
determine uranium grades.  

Chevron samples were apparently collected on nominal 5 ft (1.52 m) intervals 
regardless of the lithology.  This is an appropriate sample length and philosophy for 
this type of deposit which, if developed, would most likely be mined as an open pit with 
bench heights of 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m).  Core was split, the details of which are not 
specified, and one-half was sent to the sample preparation and analytical laboratory.   

Current WLC USA drilling on the PCD Lens is utilizing nominal 5 ft (1.5 m) sample 
lengths which AMEC considers optimum.  Those sample lengths are modified to match 
geological contacts where necessary with a maximum sample length of 30 ft (9.1 m) 
(only 207 of 5,011 samples are longer than 5 ft (1.55 m)).  Longer intervals were in 
areas where core recovery was poor or where lithologies such as basalt were 
intercepted.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

13.1 Sample Preparation – Chevron  

Few records of sample preparation procedures exist for the project.  Hand-written 
notes indicate that core was split and one-half was archived.  The other half was 
crushed in a jaw crusher and then split "until a single representative sample bag" was 
obtained.  The mass of the sample is not specified.  The remainder of the split was 
retained in labeled bags.   

Chip samples were split and one-half retained.  The second split was prepared as 
above.  The mass or granulometry of the final analytical split is not specified nor has 
AMEC located records of those data.  

Details of crushing, splitting, and pulverization are not provided.  During the time 
covered by this Cone Geochemical Inc. (the primary analytical laboratory) routinely 
dried the samples at 250oF (120oC), crushed to 10 mesh, split 150 g minimum with a 
riffle splitter, and pulverized to 150 mesh with a steel ring and puck mill unless 
otherwise directed by their customer.  There is no record of variance from this 
procedure for these samples.   

The record suggests that sample splitting and bagging was performed by Chevron 
employees and that the entire sample was sent to the analytical laboratory for final 
preparation and analysis.  There is no indication in the record that company 
employees were involved with final sample preparation. 

13.2 Sample Preparation – WLC USA 

WLC USA has used American Assay Laboratories (AAL) of Reno, Nevada as their 
primary assay laboratory for their 2007 and 2008 drill campaigns.  AAL is an ISO 
17025 certified laboratory, holds other certificates of laboratory proficiency from 
standards groups in Canada and Australia, and participates in the Society of Mineral 
Analysts round robin testing. 

AAL prepares RC samples for assay by crushing the entire sample to 90% passing -6 
mesh, and pulverizing a nominal 250 gram split of this material to 90% passing -150 
mesh.  Core samples are prepared in the same manner except that a secondary rolls 
crusher is used to produce a better crush product.

13.3 Analysis – Chevron  

Samples were analyzed for Li at Cone Geochemical, Inc. (Cone) and Skyline Labs, 
Inc. (Skyline) by dissolving 0.1 g of sample in a boiling HF-HNO3-HClO4 to dryness.  
The residue was then dissolved in 6N HCl, diluted to 100 ml with H2O, and read on an 
atomic absorption spectrometer (AA).  This four acid digestion is an industry standard 
procedure.  Skyline experimented with a number of other procedures, but the record 
indicates that they used the four acid digestion followed by AA determination as the 
primary analytical procedure.  In most cases, Li was reported as ppm, but in some 
cases, Li2O was reported as percent.  In the database, Li2O was converted to Li (ppm).   

A small number of samples were analyzed for As, Sb, Au, Ag, Zn, Mo, and MgO.  As, 
Sb, and Au were determined by digestion in aqua regia followed by AA.  Mo, Zn, Ag, 
and MgO were determined by four acid digestion followed by AA.  These are standard 
analytical procedures.   

AMEC is not aware of any certifications for Cone and Skyline at the time the work was 
performed; however, both labs were well respected and widely used by the mining and 
environmental industry.  

13.4 Analysis – WLC USA  

AAL is the primary laboratory for WLC.  Samples were analyzed two ways.  The 
primary Li analysis is done by a four acid digestion of 0.5 g of sample followed by 
determination by atomic absorption spectrometry (AA).  The second analysis is done 
by four acid digestion of a separate aliquot of sample followed by determination on an 
ICP.  Both methods are standard for the industry.   

13.5 Density 

WLC USA submitted six core samples from the PCD to MACTEC Engineering and 
Consulting in Reno Nevada for density determinations.  Density was determined by 
two methods; results are summarized in Table 13-1.  Four samples were tested using 
the method described in ASTM C127 (AASHTO T85) and two were tested using a 
paraffin coat method.  Both are standard methods. 

An additional 31 samples were submitted to Kappes Cassiday & Associates, Reno, 
NV, for density determination.  The material received was weighed, the weight 
reported and then dried at 75oC for 24 hours.  The dry material was then weighed 
again and the weight reported.  A rock density test was then completed on the dry 
material using a wax immersion procedure (ASTM Designation C914-95).

Project No.:  160237 Page 13-3

These data were then used to determine the densities to be used in the model (Table 
13-1. 

Table 13-1: Density Data Used for Resource Estimation 

Domain Domain Code Density (g/cm3) Density (ft3/ton) 
Alluvium 1 2 16.02

Volcaniclastic 3 1.6 20.02 
Bedrock 4 2.3 13.93 
Basalt 5 2.4 13.35 

 

Density determinations were performed using standard procedures and are adequate 
for resource estimation.  AMEC recommends; however, that additional density data be 
collected routinely as part of normal exploration activities.  

13.6 Quality Control - Chevron 

AMEC found four duplicate samples analyzed by Cone in the data provided (Figure 
13-1).  Those results suggest that the precision was adequate, but there are 
insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclusions.   

Otherwise, no independent quality control measures were in place.  During this time 
period, Cone normally analyzed a single duplicate sample and a single standard 
sample in each analytical batch, but those data were not routinely provided to their 
customers and are thus not part of the record of this project.

These are the only results that can be identified as quality control results.  This is 
typical of the time period although it was normal to send a number of samples to a 
second laboratory specifically for check assays.  Relative to current industry 
standards, quality control for the Chevron analytical work on this project was 
substandard.  The results were verified by drilling three twin holes and comparing 
Chevron grades to WLC USA grades (see Section 13.8).  

13.7 Quality Control - WLC USA 

Quality assurance-quality control (QA-QC) by WLC USA consists of standard samples, 
blank analyses, duplicate analyses and check assays.  Duplicate analyses were 
performed on pulp samples at AAL.  Those samples were prepared and analyzed in 
the same batch as the original sample.  Check assays were performed two ways.  A 
portion of the samples were sent to Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado for analysis 
and all samples were analyzed by both AA and ICP at AAL.   

Blank Samples 

WLC USA analyzed 127 blank samples.  AMEC considers a sample to be blank if it 
contains less than three times the detection limit of the element in question and 
considers the blank to fail if it contains more than five times the detection limit.  The 
detection limit for Li is reported by AAL to be 30 ppm.  Most of the samples contained 
less than detection limit Li and all but one obvious sample swap contained less than

five times detection limit Li.  Blank samples indicate that there is little, if any, 
contamination in the analytical process.  AMEC considers results from the blanks to all 
be acceptable.   

Duplicate Samples 

Duplicate samples provide information about the precision of the analytical procedure.  
AMEC estimates precision by calculating the relative error of the duplicate pairs: 

Relative error = (S1-S2)/(S1+S2)/2 

The cumulative frequency of the relative error for samples containing more than 20 
times detection limit is then calculated.  AMEC uses the 90th percentile relative error as 
an estimate of precision.  In the case of lithium, precision for AA analyses is estimated 
at + 11.7%.  Precision for ICP analyses is estimated at + 11.6%.  AMEC also uses the 
duplicate data to estimate the detection limit as a check on the reported limits.  In this 
case, the estimated detection limits for Li by AA is about 15 ppm which is one-half the 
reported limit.  The estimated detection limit for Li by ICP is approximately 10 ppm.  

The estimated precision is slightly outside the generally accepted limit of +10%.  Both 
AA and ICP show very similar precision suggesting that Li may be somewhat difficult 
to analyze and that the 10% limit may be too restrictive.   

Figure 13-2 is a min-max plot where the minimum of the duplicate pair is plotted 
against the maximum of the duplicate pair.  This forces the points above the X=Y line.  
AMEC the plots a line with a slope of 1.1 and intercept of five times the detection limit.  
This line is then used as a warning line to flag duplicate pairs with a greater than 10% 
difference.  The difference can be a result of poor precision, sample swaps, or myriad 
other reasons.  These samples should be investigated to determine the source of the 
poor precision.  Poor precision coupled with failing or near-failing standards is cause to 
have the batch reanalyzed.  In this case, five samples fall outside the warning line and 
were checked.  A similar plot for ICP Li shows only one sample outside the warning 
line.

Check Assays 

All of the samples analyzed during the 2007-2008 drill program were analyzed using 
both AA and ICP finishes.  Those results are considered by AMEC to be check assays.  
Figure 13-3 summarizes the results.  The data indicate a small (1.3%) bias between 
the methods.  The bias is not considered by AMEC to be significant.

Check assays were analyzed at Hazen Research in Golden Colorado.  Figure 13-4 
summarizes the results of those analyses.  There is a significant amount of scatter 
around the X = Y line (r2 = 0.87) and the data appear to have a bias, based on the 
least squares regression line (0.9452).  Based on this observation, AMEC calculated 
the reduced major axis line which is a better estimator of bias than a least squares 
line.  The slope of that line is 1.013 indicating no significant bias.  AMEC also 
calculated bin means for 0-1000, 1000-2000, etc ppm bins.  Those bin means are 
plotted on Figure 13-4 and also indicate no significant bias.  AMEC concludes that 
although there is significant scatter about the x = y line, there is no significant bias 
between the Hazen and AAL Li results.

Standards 

WLC USA produced three appropriate standards from Li-bearing clays found in the 
project area.  Those standards were used in the early 2008 exploration work and show 
that the Li data are adequately accurate.  Use of these standards identified analytical 
problems with a small number of analytical batches which were reanalyzed and the 
new data used in the resource estimate. 

13.8 Twin Holes 

In the 2007-2008 drilling program, WLC USA drilled three twin holes to verify the data 
generated by Chevron in 1984 (Table 13-2).  WLC USA drilled both core and RC holes 
adjacent to Chevron rotary holes.  Those holes confirmed the location and tenor of the

mineralization.  The results indicate that relative to the WLC USA core results, 
Chevron results above 2800 ppm Li were unbiased, but below 2800 ppm, Chevron is 
biased somewhat high.  AMEC concluded that no adjustments were necessary and 
used the Chevron results without adjustment. 

RC results showed a conditional bias where samples with more than 2000 ppm Li 
were biased about 21% low relative to the core data.  AMEC opted not to use these 
RC sample data because of the large adjustments necessary to make the data 
comparable to the core data.   

Figure 13-5 shows the comparison of WLC-001c and PC-84-17.  The histogram shows 
that the mineralization is in the same location in both holes and the cumulative 
frequency diagram shows that the tenor, as estimated by the cumulative grade-
thickness diagram, is very similar.

13.9 Discussion of QA-QC 

QA-QC for the Chevron data is substandard relative to current best practices.  
However; twin holes drilled by WLC USA largely confirmed the location and tenor of 
the mineralization and in AMEC's opinion, verified that the Chevron data are adequate 
to use for future resource work. 

WLC USA QA-QC utilizes standard samples, duplicate samples, blanks, and check 
assays at a second laboratory as well as analysis of all samples by two different 
procedures.  AMEC believes that the precision of Li analyses is adequate and that 
accuracy, based on check assays and analysis by two procedures, is also adequate.   

13.10 Security 

13.10.1 Chevron 

AMEC is not aware of any security measures for samples from this project.  Based on 
the time-frame in which the data were collected, AMEC suspects that no formal 
security measures were in place.  Because Li occurs in relatively high concentrations 
and the generally unavailability of Li compounds that could be used to tamper with the 
samples, AMEC believes that tampering with the samples is unlikely, but recommends 
that future sampling programs have rigorous sample security including chain of 
custody documentation.   

13.10.2 WLC USA  

WLC USA stores core from the current drill program in a lockable core 
logging/sampling facility that is locked when no one is present.  Samples are stored in 
a locked facility until they are shipped to the assay laboratory. 

13.10.3 Discussion 

Security during the Chevron drill programs was typical for the time period.  Current 
WLC USA security is adequate.  The possibility of significant tampering with samples 
in the custody of Chevron or WLC USA is unlikely because of the amount of Li 
required to significantly change the tenor of core or cuttings samples.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

Western Energy Development Corp. acquired the physical records of the project from 
Jim LaBret (now deceased), the owner of a number of claims covering uranium 
prospects in the area.  Those records were subsequently transferred to WLC.  In order 
to perform the analyses required for this report, AMEC compiled an assay and 
lithology database from assay compilations (and assay certificates and summary 
geological logs (graphic logs).  Approximately 50% of the assay data in that database 
has been compared to original documents.  The lithological data were taken from 
photocopies of summary graphic logs.   

Assay certificates are available for more or less all of the Chevron geochemical and/or 
assay data.  Those certificates are from Cone Geochemical Inc. and Skyline Labs Inc., 
both of which were well respected laboratories at the time this work was performed.     

During the site visit, AMEC collected a large sample from the Huber pit which was 
subsequently coned and quartered to produce four samples.  Core from holes FJ-81-
1C and FJ-81-2C from the North Lens were preserved as half-core (HQ (63.5 mm) 
diameter) and are currently stored at Western Energy Development Corp.'s Orovada 
facility.  AMEC collected chips from the core boxes to confirm the presence and 
general grade of the samples.  Samples were collected on the same intervals as the 
original samples, but consisted of chips from the bottom of the core boxes and/or chips 
from the core where loose material was not available.  The intent of these samples 
was to determine that the general grade of the samples was in the range of the original 
data, not validate the Chevron data.  Most of the high-grade material has been 
consumed for testing by Chevron and the U.S. Geological Survey who also ran various 
tests on the core.  A skeleton of approximately 1/16 of the core remains from the high-
grade intervals. 

The AMEC samples were submitted to American Assay Laboratories in Reno, Nevada 
for preparation and analysis.  The samples were prepared by crushing to 90% passing 
-10 mesh, splitting to 250 g, and pulverizing in "flying saucer" mill to 95% passing 200 
mesh.  The Huber Pit sample was split (coned and quartered) into four samples prior 
to crushing and pulverization.  The samples were analyzed by four acid digestion 
followed by ICP determination and by four acid digestion followed by AAS 
determination.  The procedure resulted in analyses for 72 elements (only Li is 
considered here).  At the time of these analyses, no appropriate standards existed to 
determine the accuracy of the procedures so AMEC had the samples analyzed by both 
ICP and AAS as a measure of accuracy.  Appropriate standards have since been 
produced prior to analysis of drill samples.  Splitting of the Huber sample was 
performed as a rough measure of precision.

The analytical results indicate that the grade determined by AMEC for the samples are 
within the range indicated by the Chevron results and that there is reasonable 
correlation between the Chevron and AMEC results when the differences in sampling 
methods are considered.   

Based on this limited test, AMEC concludes that the grades indicated by Chevron are 
reasonable and that there is no reason not to rely on those data for this evaluation.  
Additional validation in the form of twin holes also indicates that the Chevron data are 
useable for resource estimation. 

Accuracy of the AMEC samples, as indicated by results of the ICP and AAS analyses 
is judged to be adequate.  Precision is more difficult to evaluate.  The Huber sample 
has Li analyses ranging from 4,680 to 5,260 ppm Li by ICP.  Three of the samples are 
in the range of 5,070 to 5,260 ppm Li which is reasonable.  The low-grade result is 
confirmed by the AAS analysis and unexplained at this time.  Additional duplicate 
samples are required to adequately evaluate the precision of Li analyses by ICP. 

During the site visit, AMEC attempted to find approximately 25 holes drilled by 
Chevron.  The holes are depicted on various maps from the Chevron era and those 
maps were used to locate the holes.  A total of eight holes were ultimately located.  
Evidence of the holes ranged from an open hole at MC-84-75 to recognizable cuttings 
piles for some holes.  The cuttings piles are a combination of rotary cuttings drilled to 
collar casing and remnants of core cuttings.  These were confirmed in the case of hole 
MC-84-75 where an open hole was found with the cuttings.  Some of the later holes 
appear to have been plugged and capped with concrete.  The arid environment has 
allowed the cuttings to be preserved. 

AMEC used a hand-held GPS unit to determine the location of the holes using the 
NAD 83 datum.  Most of the locations are quite close considering the fact that a hand-
held GPS was used to locate the holes.  Some of the holes were not located, but 
AMEC is confident that with proper surveying instruments, most holes can be located.  

For the 2007-2008 work, AMEC requested and received the assay data directly from 
AAL and compared that data to the data provided to AMEC by WLC USA.  No 
discrepancies were noted.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

American Colloid has a group of claims in the area of the South Lens.  No production 
is known from those claims.  The J.M. Huber Corporation owns a small number of 
claims along the eastern edge of the North Lobe from which they periodically obtain 
small quantities of clay materials for specialty uses.  No other clay operations exist in 
the area.  AMEC could find no public records pertaining to production, mining 
activities, or reclamation bonds for this property.  Production from this property is very 
small and sporadic. 

The Kings Valley uranium deposits occur a few kilometers to the west of the lithium 
deposits.  Much of the exploration there is being performed by Western Energy 
Development Corp.  Those are exploration properties at this time, but had limited 
historical production.  Northeast of the lithium deposits, the McDermitt mercury 
deposits were mined until late in the last century.  Those deposits are inactive at this 
time and not related to the lithium resource.  A small number of historical gold 
exploration properties with possible minor production occur several kilometers to the 
west of the lithium deposits. 

Numerous gold deposits are either under exploration or are operating to the south and 
southeast of the lithium deposits.  Those deposits are not related to the lithium 
deposits and are too distant to have any direct impact on any Li operations.  They do 
show, however, that it is possible to obtain the appropriate permits for mining in this 
area of Nevada.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

16.1 Historical Testing 

Chevron Research Company performed preliminary Li extraction tests using soda ash 
and sulfuric acid leach at elevated temperatures (Van Leirsburg, 1982) and patented 
the process (Kluksdahl, 1986).  Those tests yielded a 66% lithium-in-solution recovery 
rate from Chevron clay.  Subsequent work suggests recoveries of 90% Li from the Li-
rich clay by Pug leaching ore with 0.5N sulfuric acid.  The leaches were performed at 
85o C for three hours at 10% pulp density.  The acidity of the pulp was maintained at 
0.5N.  Their work, while preliminary, suggested that a 95 to 100% recovery rate may 
be possible with optimization of parameters of the process.  The main factors for 
optimization are temperature, solid-solution ratio, pH, and time.  Beneficiation of the 
ore by grinding following size fractionation produced the best feed for the acid leach 
process and appears to significantly reduce acid consumption.   

These tests were performed on the +400 mesh fraction of the feed.  The -400 mesh 
would be processed for drilling muds and other value added clay products.   

Three approaches for a lithium product recovery from the leachate include phased lime 
precipitation (only lithium carbonate produced), ion exchange separation followed by 
lithium precipitation, and electrolytic deposition (lithium and magnesium metal 
produced). 

Because the acid leach destroys the hectorite structure, Mg, K, and F will be in 
solution and must be removed.  Marketable Mg and K chloride products may be 
possible and F may be marketable as HF.   

16.2 WLC USA Testing 

As part of the current exploration effort for lithium, WLC USA sent a number of 
samples to Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado for additional metallurgical testing.  
Hazen results indicate that the Chevron process is viable and provided initial estimates 
of operating costs.   

Additional samples were sent to Kappes Cassiday & Associates in Reno, NV for 
testing.  That work is underway and should result in process flowsheets as well as 
estimated operating costs.

AMEC relied on Hazen Research, Golden, Colorado, for process related questions.  
Their report, Extraction of Lithium from Hectorite Ore, dated 09 May 2008, provided 
the basis for conclusions and recommendations relating to processing and process 
testwork.  Hazen is a recognized metallurgical testing laboratory.

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

17.1.1 Introduction 

At the request of WLC, AMEC completed a resource estimate for the Kings Valley 
property, PCD Area, located in Humboldt County Nevada.  The resource estimate was 
made from a three-dimensional (3D) block model utilizing commercial mine planning 
software, (MineSight®).  This is the first time an electronic mine planning software 
package has been used for Kings Valley lithium resource estimation.  

Project limits are in a local grid coordinate system established by converting the UTM 
easting and northing values from meters to feet and subtracting the leading millions 
from the resulting easting and northing values.  Model coordinates are in feet (ft).  
Model extents and cell size are listed in Table 17.1.

17.1.2 Summary and Recommendations 

Kings Valley resources are summarized in Table 17-2.  Resources are summarized by 
Inferred Mineral Resource and Indicated Mineral Resource categories.  AMEC is of the 
opinion that at a 0.20 % Li cut-off the PCD Area has reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction by open pit mining.  AMEC bases this opinion on the economic 
assumptions, current at the time of this report, presented in Table 17-3. Economic 
assumptions were used to generate an economic cone using Datamine® NPV 
Scheduler and all resources are within the cone.

17.1.3 Recommendations 

AMEC recommends that WLC: 

• Collect data to model elements that may affect the economics of the project, 
estimate grade for each element in the 3D block model.  If elements can be 
produced as a co- or bi- product they could increase value.  If they negatively 
affect processing cost they could decrease project value or influence mining 
extraction sequence. 

• Complete mineralization characterization and metallurgical test work.  Code each 
block in the model with a mineralization type.  Formulate mineralization types to 
give an indication of how the material will perform when processed, and provide 
specific cost and recoveries for Mineralization type. 

• Have digital topography of the PCD Area flown. 

• Prioritize development drilling by optimized mining extraction sequence.  Drill on 
600 ft grid for Indicated Mineral Resources 200 ft grid for Measured Mineral 
Resources, check variography as drilling is completed to adjust spacing. 

17.1.4 Geologic Models 

A close out date of 01 August 2008 was utilized for drill hole data (hole WLC-037c). 

Mineralization is controlled at Kings Valley PCD Area by volcaniclastic moat 
sedimentary rocks containing Li rich claystone.  Surfaces were generated from WLC 
USA drill logs for alluvium, moat sediments, volcaniclastic rocks, and bedrock.  
Indicators were kriged to create probability envelopes for Basalt contained within the 
moat sediments.  The surfaces and the basalt probability envelope were used to code 
the blocks by lithology domains within MineSight®.  Figure 17-1 shows a cross section 
through the lithology domain block models looking to the north.

AMEC checked the domain codes interpretational consistency against WLC USA drill 
hole logs in section and plan and found the WLC USA geologic interpretations to 
match the block domain coding.  The block domain codes were found to honor the drill 
holes and capture WLC USA geologist's understanding of the deposits geology.   

17.1.5 Assays 

Sixty-two drill holes used for grade estimation (Table 17-4).  From a total of 19,983 feet 
of drilling, 8,763 ft were used in grade estimation within the mineralized moat sediment 
domain.

Assay values were not capped because probability plots showed continuity and 
domain composite coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation / mean), was low.  
The moat sediment domain, the only domain with resource potential, had a CV of 0.65.   

17.1.6 Composites 

Assay values were down hole composited into 5 ft lengths and coded by lithology 
domains.  Composites with core recovery of less then 50% were not used in grade 
interpolation due to a relationship between core recovery and Li grade.  Core 
composites with lower recovery were found to have lower Li grade.  Of the 1,875 
composites within the moat sediment domain, 121 were not used because of core 
recovery below 50%.  

17.1.7 Box Plots, Histograms and Cumulative Frequency Plots 

Descriptive statistics completed on the Li composites include box plots, histograms and 
cumulative frequency plots. 

Box plots display summary statistics for data sets graphically along side of one another 
so that they can be readily compared.  All CVs for each of the domains were found to 
be manageable for grade interpolation. 

Histograms and cumulative frequency plots display the frequency distribution of the Li 
composites and demonstrate graphically how frequency changes with increased 
grade.  They are useful in identifying multiple populations within a data set.  AMEC did 
not break out separate populations during this modeling effort.  With more drilling it 
may be possible for WLC USA geologists to identify a higher grade population domain 
within the moat sediments.  It was not necessary to do so for grade interpolation at this 
time. 

17.1.8 Variography 

Variography graphically shows spatial variability of an attribute.  For the Kings Valley 
project variography was completed using Sage 2001® software.  Correlograms (a type 
of variogram) were computed. 

AMEC completed variograms for all of the domains within the PCD Area.  The 
variograms were calculated at 30 degree increments for both azimuth and dip, 
resulting in 36 variograms.

17.1.9 Model Setup 

The block model size selected for the PCD Area model was 50 x 50 x 10 ft.  This cell 
size was selected as reasonable for resources intended to be exploited by open pit 
mining. 

Blocks were coded by domain; alluvium, moat sediments, volcaniclastic, bedrock, and 
basalt.  

17.1.10 Estimation  

Two passes (outside in) were used for Ordinary Kriging (OK) grade estimation.  The 
first pass was used to fill the moat sediment envelope; the second pass was used to 
over write blocks with a more local estimate, restricted to calculated variogram ranges.  
Composite and blocks were matched on domain code. 

Figures 17-2 and 17-3 show cross sections through the Li % OK block models looking 
to the north.

17.1.11 Model Validation 

Detailed visual inspection was completed by AMEC on the Kings Valley model.  The 
model was checked for proper coding of drill hole intervals and block model cells, in 
both section and plan.  Coding was found to be properly done.  Grade interpolation 
was checked relative to drill hole composites and found to be reasonable. 

AMEC checked the block model estimates for global bias by checking the mean NN 
estimate for Li % against model OK grade estimates.  Mean grades were found to 
match very well. 

AMEC also checked for local trends in the grade estimate by comparing mean grade 
estimation from the NN model against the OK model in swaths through the model on 
easting, northing and in elevation.  The trends are behaving as predicted. 

AMEC also used Herco validation, a procedure that uses the declustered distribution 
of composite grades from the NN model to predict the distribution of grades in blocks.  
The Herco validation for the PCD Area matches very well, the estimation procedure 
has adequately predicted grades for the selected block size.   

17.1.12 Recommended Drill Spacing 

AMEC has found that most operating mines can tolerate random discrepancies 
between actual production and estimates of contained metal of as much as 15% in a 
quarter without materially affecting short-term plans.  Similarly, deviations from 
forecast of as much as 15% in any one year do not typically threaten the economic 
viability of an operation.  Therefore, AMEC uses the statistical criterion that yearly ore 
production grade and tonnage should be known at least ±15% with 90% confidence in 
order to fall in the Indicated Mineral Resource category.  The criterion for Measured 
Mineral Resources is ±15% with 90% confidence for quarterly production. 

AMEC ran the confidence limits test for the PCD area.  The test uses the composite 
CV values, ranges from composite variograms, and an estimated annual production 
rate.  AMEC used a nominal mill production rate of 5,000 tons per day.  Based on this 
test, recommended nominal drill spacing for Measured Mineral Resources and 
Indicated Mineral Resources are:   

• Measured Mineral Resource – 200ft * 200ft  

• Indicated Mineral Resource – 600ft * 600ft.

17.1.13 Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources of the Kings Valley PCD Area were classified using logic consistent 
with the CIM Definition Standards incorporated by reference into NI 43-101.  The 
mineralization of the project satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified as an Indicated 
Mineral Resource and Inferred Mineral Resource.  Resources are tabulated in Table 
17-2, criteria listed below. 

• Inferred Mineral Resource, for a block to be classified as an Inferred Mineral 
Resource interpolated blocks had to be within 700 ft of the nearest drill hole; 
have a grade greater than or equal to 0.20 Li  %; and reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction. 

• Indicated Mineral Resource, for a block to be classified as an Indicated Mineral 
Resource interpolated blocks had to have two drill holes within 660 ft and one 
within 470 ft; have a grade greater than or equal to 0.20 Li  %; and reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. 

• Measured Mineral Resource, for a block to be classified as an Measured Mineral 
Resource interpolated blocks had to have three drill holes within 220 ft and one 
within 155 ft; have a grade greater than or equal to 0.20 Li %; and reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction.

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1 Marketing Studies 

Because lithium sales are market driven and the market is somewhat small, WLC has 
initiated marketing studies for both lithium carbonate (and derivatives) and lithium-
bearing clay mineral products found in the Kings Valley area.  Initial indications at the 
time of their study are that the market for lithium carbonate is robust and expanding.  
The market for specialty clay products was also found to be robust and expanding at a 
rate somewhat less that for lithium carbonate. 

18.2 Lithium Use 

Lithium is used in lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries for portable electronic 
devices (20% of market), as flux in glass and ceramic glazes (20% of market), 
lubricating grease (17% of the market), with the remainder being a myriad of other 
uses including gas and air treatment, aluminum smelting, synthetic rubber and 
plastics, pharmaceuticals, aluminum alloys, cement additives for construction, organic 
chemistry, acoustic wave devices, optics, and numerous minor end-uses.   

Roskill (2006) estimated world consumption of lithium is estimated at close to 80,000 t 
LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) in 2005, equivalent to 15,000 t Li metal but 
cautions that these figures should be treated as approximations.  Details on total 
consumption and breakdown by end-use markets are seldom published because of 
the high degree of concentration within the lithium industry.  The largest lithium 
consuming region is Asia, followed by North America and the EU.  Three countries – 
the USA, Japan, and China – are together estimated to account for nearly half of the 
world consumption. 

Total lithium demand is estimated to have increased by 4.5% per year from 70,200t 
LCE in 2002 to 80,000 t in 2005.  Growth has been led by demand for lithium 
carbonate in secondary batteries, while glass and frits (calcined or partially fused 
material used in making glass; substance resembling glass used in making porcelain 
or glazes) and lubricants have also been expanding markets.  The strength of the 
lithium market is reflected in the 20% rise in prices in 2005, with a similar rise forecast 
in 2006. 

Demand 

Roskill (2006), an international marketing research group concludes that:

Project No.:  160237 Page 18-2

The outlook for lithium consumption appears optimistic, with overall growth 
estimated at 4% per year through 2010.  This rate of growth suggests 
demand will rise by some 3,500 tpy lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) 
through 2010 and was the basis for SQM's (Sociedad Quimica y Minera de 
Chile SA, the world's largest producer of lithium carbonate) planned 
expansion in lithium carbonate production capacity from 28,500 to 40,000 
tpy in 2008. 

Growth in lithium consumption will continue to be driven by the lithium 
secondary battery sector.  Demand for lithium carbonate in this market rose 
by up to 30% per year in 2003/04, led by increased production of portable 
electronic products such as laptop computers, digital cameras and cellular 
phones incorporating lithium ion batteries.  Growth in lithium battery 
demand will continue to be led by portable electronic products through 
2010, with rates in Russia and Poland reaching 70% per year.  Lithium-
cobalt oxide demand in China already exceeded 10,000 t in 2005 and 
lithium battery production has been forecast to rise by up to 30% per year 
through 2010. 

This optimistic outlook is shared by WLC.  Not included in the forecast is the likely 
expansion of lithium technology to hybrid and electric vehicles in the next few years.  
Improved lithium ion and/or lithium polymer battery technology may significantly 
increase the role of lithium in hybrid and electric vehicles and thus expand the market 
beyond Roskill's forecast.  Economic recession could also reduce or delay the 
expected growth in lithium demand.  High fuel prices may be cause more rapid growth. 

Supply 

At the present time, all producers are at or near maximum capacity.  SQM plans to 
expand production of LCE from the Salar de Atacama from 28,500 to 40,000 tpy by 
year-end 2008.  Several projects are in various stages of planning in China, Argentina, 
and Chile.  The status of those projects is not known to AMEC at this time.  Roskill 
(2006) indicates that the Chinese projects have the capability of adding approximately 
45,000 t LCE to the market if they are all brought into production at the same time.  
Argentine production is planned to increase by 6,000 tpy LCE by 2008.   

Other projects, unknown to AMEC, may be in planning stages and have an impact on 
the supply of lithium to the market.

Prices 

The price for lithium chemicals and lithium minerals has consistently risen for the past 
several years.  Roskill (2006) summarizes the trends: 

US prices of lithium carbonate were reported at US$2.00-2.50/lb (delivered 
continental USA, large contracts) at the end of 2005, compared with 
US$1.50-2.00/lb in October and US$0.95-1.40/lb in mid-2004.  This 
represented a rise of over 90% in eighteen months.  The average value of 
Japanese imports of lithium carbonate from Chile increased by 25% from 
around US$2,000/t in 2004 to US$2,500/t in 2005.  SQM reported that 
average prices were 20% higher in 2005 than 2004.  The company's sales 
fell by 9% in terms of volume in 2005, but revenues rose by 30%. 

Early 2006 saw further rises in lithium carbonate prices.  Chinese prices 
were reported at Rmb 45,000/t (US$5,580/t), a rise from Rmb 42,000-
43,000/t (US$5,200-5,300/t) in September 2005.  SQM reported the in the 
first quarter of 2006, prices were 40% higher than in the first quarter of 
2005, partly due to raw materials shortages following severe weather 
conditions in Chile in early 2006. 

"Demand for lithium carbonate is estimated to increase by some 4% per 
year through 2010, implying a rise in demand of around 3,500 tpy.  Leading 
producers were already operating near to capacity level in 2005 and tight 
supplies suggest prices will continue to rise through 2006/07.  Sterling 
Group Ventures reports that unless supply increases, downstream lithium 
plants will be unable to expand output to meet rising demand." 

SQM forecasts prices will rise by 25% through 2006, bringing lithium 
carbonate prices back to the nominal 1996 level of around US$3,500/t.  A 
similar rise in 2007 would take prices over US$4,000/t. 

Growth rates for lithium carbonate consumption could accelerate from 
2008, when automotive manufacturers are forecast to start commercial-
scale production of hybrid electric vehicles incorporating lithium technology.  
Further price rises are likely to be tempered, however, by new lithium 
carbonate production capacity due on-stream towards the end of the 2000s.  
SQM in Chile plans to raise capacity from 28,500 tpy in 2006 to 40,000 tpy 
in 2008, while Admiralty Resources plans to start lithium chloride production 
in Argentina in 2007, with output scheduled to increase to 12,000 tpy from 
2008.

Of interest is the potential expansion in Chinese supply.  Projects planned 
by CITIC Guorun, Tibet Lithium New Technology Development and Tibet 
Saline Lake Mining High-Science & Technology have the combined 
potential to produce up to 45,000 tpy brine-based lithium carbonate by the 
late 2000s. 

Prices of lithium carbonate are therefore forecast to continue to rise through 
2006/07, peaking at over US$4,000/t.  Prices may subsequently weaken to 
nearer US$3,000/t as new capacity comes on-stream in Argentina, Chile 
and China. 

Note that the Chinese production increases and increased production by Admiralty 
Resources predicted to occur in 2008 have not yet occurred.   

WLC USA has completed a confidential lithium carbonate (and derivatives) marketing 
study (2007) that has included contacts with end users.  That study concurs with the 
Roskill conclusion that the lithium carbonate market is robust and expanding. 

18.2.1 Specialty Clays 

WLC USA has performed a scoping level marketing study for specialty clay minerals 
targeting natural hectorite found on the Kings Valley property and for clay minerals that 
may be produced by processing of the hectorite (Miles, 2005).  That study concludes 
that the natural hectorite and processed clay minerals are marketable.  Those products 
could likely be marketed for drilling fluids and possibly for iron ore pellet binder, 
foundry sand binder, pet litter, animal feed supplements, and civil engineering and 
sealant uses.  Additional processing may produce products for cosmetic and 
pharmaceutical uses as well as other end uses. The study recommends additional 
testwork to determine the amenability of the natural hectorite to upgrading for specialty 
uses.   

The following is from Miles (2005) report: 

In summary, the current Western Energy Development Corp. claims contain 
significant quantities of hectorite clay.  Hectorite is a rare clay mineral that 
is presently mined near Hector, California for use in many higher added 
value products.  Except for the Hector deposit in California, hectorite is not 
mined in significant quantities anywhere else in the world.  With evaluation 
of Western Energy Development Corp.'s present claims and appropriate 
mining and processing methods, the Kings Valley hectorite may prove to be 
a large deposit that can compete with Wyoming bentonite in many 
commodity markets.  Kings Valley hectorite may also find application in

higher added value hectorite markets if it can be upgraded to sodium 
hectorite by extrusion processing with soda ash and possibly other 
additives. 

With appropriate modifications during processing, the commodity markets 
that the Kings Valley hectorite can enter include: animal feed supplements, 
drilling mud (including geothermal and deep drilling where excessive 
temperatures destroy bentonite properties), fillers and extenders, foundry 
sand binder, pelletizing of iron ore, waterproofing and sealing, and 
miscellaneous applications.  The bentonite commodity market averages 
$43 per ton, with a low of about $20 to $25 per bulk ton for iron ore 
pelletizing to $100 per ton for pesticide carriers and catalyst applications. 

Major commodity markets for bentonite in 2004 show significant changes in 
tonnage.  Since 1993, pet waste absorbents have leveled at about 1 million 
metric tons and foundry sand binders have increased in recent years to 
744,800 metric tons.  Waterproofing and sealants are withheld from 2002-
2004; however, it increased from 213,000 tons in 1993 to 269,000 tons in 
2002.  Iron ore pelletizing has increased significantly from 466,000 metric 
tons in 1993 to 526,100 metric tons in 2004. 

The higher added value markets for hectorite include: organophilic clay 
products for greases, paints, oil based drilling fluids; and, hydrophilic clay 
products for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and water based paints. The 
organophilic clay products reach $1 to $3 per pound; while cosmetic and 
pharmaceutical markets for hydrophilic clay products range from $200 to 
$1,500 per ton. 

18.2.2 Discussion 

At this time, it appears that supply and demand for lithium chemicals and minerals are 
approximately equal.  Inclement weather in Chile is blamed for a production shortfall 
by SQM in 2006 that caused a small price spike, indicating that supplies are somewhat 
tight.  Demand is expanding, primarily in the lithium ion and lithium polymer battery 
sector.  Increasing demand for Li batteries (20% per year, Ed Benson, personal 
comm.) has resulted in a price spike in August 2007 to US$3.66/lb.  This increasing 
demand may be partially offset in the near term by increased production from Chile 
and Argentina and new production from China.  In the short term, prices are likely to 
rise because of increasing demand.  Prices may stabilize to some extent in 2008, but 
the forecasts do not include likely demand for lithium batteries in hybrid and electric 
vehicles which could cause a significant increase in demand that would not be offset 
by currently planned production increases and thus cause the price to increase.  The

magnitude of the demand for lithium in hybrid and electric vehicles is impossible to 
estimate at this time, but the outlook is optimistic. 

AMEC believes that WLC USA should continue detailed marketing studies for lithium 
carbonate (and derivatives) that include development of a strategy for successfully 
entering the market and capturing an appropriate share of that market.  Much of that 
study has been completed and marketing studies are underway.  Results of these 
studies are considered to be confidential by WLC USA and are not discussed here but 
have been reviewed by AMEC and are considered to be supportive of the assumptions 
used in the resource estimates.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

19.1 Geological Setting 

The Kings Valley lithium deposits occur within sedimentary and volcanosedimentary 
rocks in the moat of a resurgent caldera.  The extent and nature of the host rocks is 
well documented and understood.   

At the present time, five areas of significant lithium mineralization have been identified 
– the North Lens, North Central Lens, South Lens, South Central Lens, and PCD.  In 
each of these areas hectorite, a lithium-bearing clay mineral occurs in thick, apparently 
continuous accumulations.  The general continuity and geometry of the deposits has 
been defined by drilling in the all three areas on about 500 m centers.  Drilling at PCD 
has confirmed continuity of the mineralization to as close as 50 m. 

19.2 Tenure 

Based on the records provided, AMEC accepts that WLC USA has rights to the Li 
mineralization within the PCD lens and that all appropriate permits for exploration have 
been obtained. 

19.3 Deposit Type 

To AMEC's knowledge, there are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide.  The 
hectorite deposits at Hector, California have similar mineralogy, but the geological 
setting is significantly different.   

These Kings Valley deposits are believed to have formed by hydrothermal alteration of 
layered volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  What is not clear is whether the alteration 
was essentially syngenetic with deposition of the sedimentary rocks or whether the 
alteration is a post depositional event.  During the site visit, AMEC observed textures 
and other evidence that suggests that the alteration was post depositional, but 
additional work is required to resolve the origin of these deposits.   

19.4 Mineralization 

Mineralization consists of layered beds of lithium-bearing clay-rich volcaniclastic 
sedimentary rocks.  The beds exhibit very good geological continuity over kilometers 
with drill spacings on the order of 500 m.  The thickness of mineralization varies from 
less than a meter to more than 90 m with typical intercepts of about 30 m.  The extent 
of mineralization is well known.  At PCD, the continuity of the mineralization has been

confirmed by drilling at spacings as close as 50 m.  Twin holes separated by 10-15 m 
also show very good continuity of lithium grade. 

19.5 Exploration 

Exploration on WLC's lithium project has consisted of geological mapping to delineate 
the limits of the moat volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and drilling to determine the 
grade and location of mineralization.  Some, if not most, of the area has been covered 
by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, but those data are not pertinent to exploration 
for lithium.  There is no record of other exploration in the area.   

This report is restricted to the PCD Lens which has had sufficient drilling to produce a 
preliminary resource estimate.  A total of 70 core, reverse circulation (RC), and rotary 
holes (7,770.7 m) occur in the PCD database.  The record indicates that of the 70 
holes in the database, 25 are rotary holes (1,040.9 m), 8 are RC holes (1,798.62 m) 
and 37 are core holes (4,931.16 m).  Of these holes, all except the RC holes were 
used for the resource estimate. 

Claim surveying was performed by Tyree Surveying Company, Albuquerque, New 
Mexico and Desert Mountain Surveying Company, Winnemucca, Nevada (Chevron, 
1980).  According to Chevron (1980) both companies utilized theodolites and laser 
source electronic distance meters to survey the claims.  Records indicate that both 
companies surveyed drill collar locations and it is presumed that the same 
instrumentation was used for those locations.  WLC USA is using a Trimble differential 
GPS to survey collar locations.  These are industry standard instruments. 

AMEC is not aware of any downhole surveys for Chevron holes.  All of the drill holes 
are vertical and are assumed to be uniformly vertical.  WLC USA began performing 
downhole surveys beginning with WLC-024c.  Results indicate very little deviation and 
support the assumption of verticality for previously drilled holes. 

AMEC believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the 
extent and general tenor of the deposits are adequately known to support resource 
estimation.   

19.6 Drilling 

In 1979, 34 rotary percussion holes were drilled to evaluate selected tailings disposal 
sites for anticipated uranium production (Table 6-1).  Those holes were analyzed for 
lithium and found to contain anomalous lithium.  In 1980 and 1981, four core holes 
were drilled to obtain uncontaminated and undisturbed samples to more effectively

NI 43-101 Technical Report

determine lithium grades and coincident volcaniclastic stratigraphy.  After logging and 
analysis of the first two core holes, a portion of the core was sent to Chevron Research 
Company (CRC) for metallurgical test work.   

The exploration history suggests that 213 rotary percussion and 15 core holes were 
drilled to test the lithium mineralization between 1980 and 1984, but that is not certain.  
These drill procedures were standard for the industry at that time.  Rotary percussion 
drilling is not widely used today because of the likelihood of contamination of samples 
using this procedure and the difficulty of obtaining representative samples.   

During the period of 1982 through 1987, Chevron drilled 223 additional holes on 
lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing of the hectorite deposits 
to determine amenability of the deposits to extraction of lithium (Section 16).   

In 2007-2008, WLC USA drilled 37 core and 8 RC holes at PCD to explore that area.  
Assays of RC holes are biased significantly lower than assays of the core holes 
suggesting loss of Li to fines during the RC drilling process.  Additional work is 
required to identify the reasons for the grade bias.  RC drilling has been suspended. 

At this time, AMEC believes that the drill-hole spacing at PCD is adequate to support 
indicated and inferred mineral resources as defined under CIM Definition Standards of 
Mineral Resources and Minerals Reserves (2005). 

19.7 Sampling 

Approximately 95% of the samples were between 1.52 m (5 ft) and 3.05 m (10 ft) in 
length.  The maximum sample length was 10.43 m (34 ft).  Sample intervals greater 
than 10 feet were in waste and generally not analyzed.  The minimum sample interval 
was 0.24 m (0.8 ft).  WLC USA sample intervals were limited by lithology thus the 
variable lengths are possible.  The record provided to AMEC does not contain details 
of sampling methods for rotary holes.  During that time period, a portion of the cuttings 
from rotary holes were typically captured at the collar of the hole and placed in sample 
bags.  Samples were not captured in their entirety.  This type of sampling is now 
generally considered to be inappropriate for mineral exploration because the likelihood 
of contamination and the lack of proper splitting.  WLC USA has drilled three twin 
holes at PCD.  Those holes represent 12% of the total holes.  Those holes confirmed 
the location and tenor of the Li mineralization.  Chevron grades exhibit a conditional 
bias relative to the WLC USA core results.  Grades above 2,000 ppm Li were not 
biased so AMEC opted not to adjust the Chevron data.

 Kings Valley Lithium Project 
 Humboldt County, Nevada USA 

 

   

Project No.:  160237 Page 19-4  
15 December 2008 
 

WLC USA has sampled on nominal 1.524 m (5 ft) intervals with modification of the 
sample interval by geological contacts.  Some longer intervals (as long as 9.1 m) are 
due to lithologies such as basalt that are unlikely to contain significant Li. 

AMEC believes that sample intervals are acceptable to support resource estimation. 

19.8 Sample Preparation, Assaying, and Security 

Sample Preparation 

Few records of Chevron sample preparation procedures exist.  Hand-written notes 
indicate that core was split and one-half was archived.  The other half was crushed in 
a jaw crusher and then split "until a single representative sample bag" was obtained.  
The mass of the sample is not specified.  The remainder of the split was retained in 
labeled bags.  The record suggests that sample crushing, splitting, and bagging was 
performed by Chevron employees and that the crushed and split sample was sent to 
the analytical laboratory for final preparation and analysis.  There is no indication in the 
record that company employees were involved with final sample preparation. 

Sample preparation for rotary hole samples are presumed to be the same as for core 
samples except for splitting which would have been performed by riffle splitter. 

Chip samples from rotary holes were split and one-half retained.  The second split was 
prepared as above.   

The mass or granulometry of the final analytical split (crushed sample) is not specified 
nor has AMEC located records of those data.  

Details of crushing, splitting, and pulverization are not provided.  During the time 
covered by this exploration Cone Geochemical Inc. (the primary analytical laboratory) 
routinely dried the samples at 250oF (120oC), crushed to 10 mesh, split 150 g 
minimum with a riffle splitter, and pulverized to 150 mesh with a steel ring and puck 
mill unless otherwise directed by their customer.  There is no record of deviation from 
this procedure for these samples.   

AMEC believes that sample preparation was typical for the period and that those 
procedures would be similar to current industry procedures.  AMEC has no concerns 
about sample preparation. 

WLC USA sample preparation occurs at AAL where the samples are crushed to 90% 
passing -10 mesh, splitting to 250 g, and pulverizing in "flying saucer" mill to 95% 
passing 200 mesh.

 Kings Valley Lithium Project 
 Humboldt County, Nevada USA 

 

   

Project No.:  160237 Page 19-5  
15 December 2008 
 

AMEC believes that sample preparation is adequate to support resource estimation. 

Assaying 

Assaying for both Chevron and WLC USA was accomplished using a four acid 
digestion followed by determination on an AA.  That was, and continues to be, a 
standard analytical procedure within the mineral industry. 

QA-QC 

There is little in the way of QA-QC in the record for the Chevron data.  The few 
duplicate sample data suggest that precision was adequate, but too few data exist to 
allow any significant conclusions.  Relative to current industry practices, QA-QC for the 
historical data for this project is substandard.   

WLC USA employs standard samples, pulp duplicate analyses, blank samples, and 
check assays for QA-QC.  Standard samples indicate adequate accuracy.  Duplicate 
analyses indicate acceptable precision.  Blanks are blank, indicating no significant 
contamination.  Check assays at Hazen Research confirm the AAL data.  AAL also 
analyzes each sample for Li by AA and by ICP, using different solutions.  Those 
results are very close indicating that the accuracy is likely adequate.  Standard sample 
results were used to identify analytical problems during the course of the program.  
Those problems were related to the analytical laboratory and the samples reanalyzed 
and new certificates issued. 

Sample Security 

Sample security for Chevron samples is not discussed in the project records.  AMEC 
assumes that it was typical for that time period and did not include any secure storage 
or significant chain of custody protocols.  Because of the reasonably high grade of the 
materials and the relatively low unit value, AMEC has no concerns about the integrity 
of the sample results.  Future exploration efforts should have secure storage areas 
and chain of custody procedures in place to minimize the likelihood of tampering. 

WLC USA periodically collects core and cuttings from the drills and transports the core 
and cuttings to their office in Orovada.  There both sample types are stored in lockable 
storage facilities.  AMEC believes that the security of samples is adequate.

19.9 Data Verification 

AMEC compiled an assay and lithology database from physical records in the 
possession of WLC.  Subsequent to that compilation, AMEC verified approximately 
50% of the assay data by comparison to original assay certificates.  Lithology data 
were taken from graphic logs.  Collar locations were provided to AMEC by WLC USA 
and were verified, where possible, against original data.   

Collar surveying for Chevron holes is believed by AMEC to have been performed by 
conventional surveying techniques that were standard at the time the holes were 
drilled.  AMEC located eight drill hole collars in the field and generally confirmed the 
locations of those holes.  AMEC has little concern about the locations of drill holes but 
recommends that the holes be resurveyed and that the conversion from local to UTM 
coordinates be verified.  WLC USA uses a Trimble GPS for surveying.  This is an 
industry standard instrument. 

AMEC collected a single large sample from the Huber Pit (mine) which was 
subsequently split into four subsamples and 21 samples from core from the archive.  
Those samples were collected, not to verify specific grades in core holes, but to 
generally confirm that the reported grades exist on the properties.   

Historical density data are lacking from the record.  Chevron used 1.8 g/cm3 for wet 
clay and 2.16 g/cm3 for dry clay but the origin of that value is not known.  WLC USA 
performed 32 density determinations that form the basis for densities assigned to rock 
types in the resource model.  Additional density data would be useful to refine the 
density values used for resource estimation. 

WLC USA drilled three core holes to twin Chevron holes.  Those holes confirmed the 
location and tenor of mineralization in the Chevron holes.  AMEC requested, and 
received, assay data directly from AAL and compared those data to the data received 
from WLC.  No discrepancies were noted. 

19.10 Adjacent Properties 

There are no adjacent properties that relevant to the Kings Valley lithium properties 
and there are no nearby operating mines.  Several gold mines are in operation several 
tens of miles to the southeast and are mentioned to illustrate that mining permits are 
possible in the area.  In the past century, a large mercury mine operated to the 
northeast of the lithium properties.  To the west of the lithium properties, uranium and 
gold were produced from small mines in the past century.  Those properties are being 
actively explored, but there is no current production.

Project No.:  160237 Page 19-7  
15 December 2008 
 

The Huber Pit at the north end of the lithium mineralized trend is operated sporadically 
and possibly a few tens of tons of material are produced per year, but production 
generally occurs in a short period every two or three years.   

American Colloid has a small number of claims in the area of the South Lens but those 
claims have not produced in recent times.   

19.11 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Chevron patented a process to extract lithium from hectorite.  That process was 
demonstrated to be effective, but was not economic at the prices of lithium in the mid-
1980's.  AMEC reviewed the documentation and believe that the process is viable, but 
concludes that both the process and operating cost estimates must be verified by 
additional testing.  Hazen Research completed initial testwork on samples from the 
PCD Lens confirmed the technical feasibility of the Chevron process.  Hazen Research 
and Kappes Cassiday & Associates are currently performing additional process 
testwork.  

19.12 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

AMEC is of the opinion that at a 0.10 % Li cutoff the PCD Area mineralization has 
reasonable prospects for economic extraction by open pit mining.   AMEC bases these 
opinions on the economic assumptions, current at the time of this report, presented in 
Table 17-3.  

AMEC is of the opinion the Kings Valley property has the exploration potential to 
increase the lithium mineral resources. 

19.13 Marketing 

AMEC briefly reviewed the possibility of marketing Li and Li-bearing clays.  Li would 
most likely be marked as Li2CO3 which is used in batteries, lubricants, cosmetics, and 
myriad other products.  According to Roskill, the market has been expanding in recent 
years and will likely continue to expand.  Recent price increases suggest that supply is 
not keeping pace with demand.  This supports the assumption that lithium produced 
from this project would be marketable.  

Hectorite is used for high-temperature drilling fluids and other specialty clay 
applications.  It has a relatively high value per tonne, but it is marketable in small 
quantities.

WLC USA has performed a number of marketing studies, most of which are 
confidential, and have concluded that there is a market for Li and Li-bearing products. 

AMEC concludes that sufficient marketing knowledge exists for the commodities that 
could be produced from these properties to support mineral resource estimation.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

20.1 Drilling 

Drilling is adequate for estimation of mineral resources at the PCD and are sufficient to 
support a preliminary economic assessment of those resources once more information 
is available regarding process flow sheets and process operating costs.  Additional 
infill drilling will be required in order to increase the confidence categories of the 
mineral resources to support a prefeasibility study. 

20.2 Database verification 

AMEC recommends that additional dry density data be acquired to better refine 
density estimates for each rock type.  Those data should be determined using a wax-
coat, immersion procedure.   

20.3 Processing 

AMEC recommends that metallurgical testwork continue in order to finalize the 
process flowsheet and to quantify estimated process operating costs.  This work is in 
progress at Kappes Cassiday & Associates, Reno, Nevada. 

20.4 Marketing Study 

AMEC recommends that WLC USA continue to investigate the lithium carbonate and 
lithium clay markets.   

20.5 Additional Exploration 

At the present time, exploration at the PCD deposit is sufficient to support indicated 
and inferred mineral resources under CIM Definition Standards of Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves.  Upon completion of the resource estimate and a positive 
marketing study, a preliminary economic assessment of the PCD resource (termed a 
Preliminary Assessment by NI 43-101) would be the next step with the currently 
available drilling information.  A Preliminary Assessment may be followed by additional 
drilling, metallurgy and preliminary engineering designs to bring the project to 
prefeasibility level.  Additional drilling may be required to fill gaps in the drill pattern to 
upgrade the confidence of the existing mineral resource.

20.6 Proposed Budget 

Table 20-1 presents a proposed budget that would advance the project to the stage of 
Prefeasibility Assessment.  Additional engineering studies may follow the successful 
completion of a Prefeasibility Assessment but AMEC has not proposed a budget for 
these because the characteristics of the project for more advanced engineering 
studies will not be determined until a Prefeasibility Assessment is completed.
