Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019   

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information 

Certain information contained or incorporated by reference in this technical report, including any 
information as to our strategy, projects, plans, or future financial or operating performance, 
constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, 
are forward-looking statements. The words "estimate", "forecast", "plan", "evaluate", "schedule", 
"project", "potential", "develop", "expect", "possible", "propose", "following", "strategy", 
"continues", "target", "recommend", "develop", "suggest", "indicate", "appear", "update", "design", 
"budget", "can", "will", "would" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In 
particular, this technical report contains forward-looking statements related to Barrick Gold 
Corporation's ("Barrick" or the "Company") Massawa Project ("Massawa" or the "Project"), 
including, without limitation, with respect to: (i) forecasts of cash flow and net present value, 
economic assessments, projected capital and operating expenditure, mine life and production 
rates; (ii) metal or mineral recoveries; (iii) expected grades; (iv) estimates of mineral resources 
and mineral reserves; (v) benefits of proposed mine design and layout; (vi) projected costs; (vii) 
proposed infrastructure and future infrastructure requirements; (viii) future exploration and the 
ability to further add to Massawa's project inventory; (ix) potential environmental and social 
impacts related to the execution of the Project; (x) associated royalties payable; (xi) the ability of 
Barrick to realize the full potential of Massawa in cooperation with the government of Senegal; 
and (vii) planned rehabilitation for the Project following the completion of mining.  

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions 
including material estimates and assumptions related to the factors set forth below that, while 
considered reasonable by the Company as at the date of this technical report in light of 
management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are 
inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and 
contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those projected in the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on 
such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the 
spot and forward price of gold, copper, or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, 
natural gas, and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; 
changes in mineral production performance, exploitation, and exploration successes; risks 
associated with projects in the early stages of evaluation, and for which additional engineering 
and other analysis is required; disruption of supply routes which may cause delays in construction 
and mining activities; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, 
suspensions and technical challenges associated with the development and construction of 
capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development 
activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of 
required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental 
and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, 
necessary permits and approvals; uncertainty whether some or all of targeted investments and 
projects will meet the Company's capital allocation objectives and internal hurdle rate; the impact 
of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and 
liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency 
markets; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations 
and/ or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or 
nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States 
and Senegal; damage to the Company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of 
any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Company's handling of 
environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; lack of certainty 
with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the 
rule of law; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the Company's 
expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019   

may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering 
and socioeconomic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage 
and civil disturbances; litigation and legal and administrative proceedings; contests over title to 
properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other 
required infrastructure; risks associated with illegal and artisanal mining; the risks of operating in 
jurisdictions where infectious diseases present major health care issues; disruption of supply 
routes which may cause delays in construction and mining activities; risks associated with 
working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key 
employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource 
shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining 
inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral 
exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, 
unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode 
or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain 
insurance, to cover these risks). 

Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking 
statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements 
are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this 
technical report are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the 
most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial 
securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying 
forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrick's ability to achieve the 
expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this technical report. 

Barrick disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by 
applicable law.

Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 1 

1. Executive Summary 

The Massawa Gold Project (Massawa or the Project), located in Senegal, was discovered by 
Randgold Resources Limited (Randgold), an exploration and mining company that explored, 
developed, and operated mines in West and East Africa.  

On 24th September 2018, Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) agreed to merge with Randgold in 
a zero premium, share-for-share deal. The merger was completed on the 1st January 2019 and 
resulted in Randgold becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick and delisting from the 
London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Randgold is now part of the Barrick group which is listed 
on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges, and is one of the largest gold mining and 
exploration companies in the world. Randgold continues to be the owner of the Massawa Permit. 
On 22nd January 2019, Randgold changed its name to Barrick Gold (Holdings) Limited.  

This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure of 
Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) and has been prepared to support the 2018 year-end Mineral 
Resource and Ore Reserve estimation at Massawa based on feasibility level studies. Recent 
targeted project development work programmes, including resource drilling and metallurgical 
testwork in 2017 and 2018, have made a material impact on the understanding of the mineralised 
bodies and potential of the Project to provide significant economic returns at a range of gold 
prices. All currency in this report is US dollars ($) unless otherwise noted. 

The Project feasibility study includes the open pit material from four pits, namely, Massawa 
Central Zone (CZ) and North Zone (NZ), Sofia, and Delya. The deposits consist of free milling 
ore from the oxide contribution of the pits and the fresh material of Sofia and the bulk of the CZ 
pit. Refractory fresh material is sourced from the northern part of the CZ pit as well as the NZ and 
Delya pits. The refractory ores have proven to be highly recoverable through a bio-oxidation 
process. Subsequent to the completion of the feasibility study, an application has been lodged 
with the Senegalese government to convert the Kanoumba Permit into a mining licence under 
the 2003 Mining Code of Senegal. 

1.1. Location 

The Project is located approximately 700 km SE of the Senegalese capital city, Dakar. Dakar is 
serviced by commercial daily flights from European cities. The proposed main transport route for 
capital equipment would be by road from the port of Dakar.  

The Millennium highway from Dakar to Bamako runs to the south of the permit. The laterite road 
from Mako to Sabodala, currently being upgraded, provides access to site from the SW. 
Alternative access from the south is via a laterite road from Bembou. Charter flights are available 
from Dakar to Kedougou, the regional centre, located 71 km from Massawa, between Bembou 
and Mako along the Millennium highway. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 2 

Massawa can also be accessed by road from Barrick's Loulo Mine in Mali which is located 90 km 
to the east of Massawa, with an average road journey time of five hours including the international 
border crossing. 

1.2. Ownership 

The government of Senegal presently has a non-contributory 10% share of any mine developed 
on the property. The government's interest is activated at the Exploitation Stage, when a local 
mining subsidiary must be created. Compagnie Senegalaise de Transports Transatlantiques 
Afrique de l'Ouest (CSSTAO), a local partner of Randgold in Senegal, has a 6.75% holding of 
the remaining 90% equity, resulting in Randgold having an effective 83.25% ownership of the 
Project. Conventions under the 1988 Mining Code (Law No 88-06 of 26th August 1988) covered 
the original Kanoumering (2002) and Kounemba Permits (2003). Subsequent to the 1988 Mining 
Code, an updated mining code was passed in November 2003 (Law No 2003-36 of 24th 
November 2003).  

Randgold Senegal had the right under the 2003 Mining Code to accept the new code should it 
negotiate a new single convention that merged the two permits over the Project. This option was 
duly exercised, and on 14th April 2010 the two permits were combined into a single Kanoumba 
Permit of 621 km2 covered by a single convention based on the 2003 Mining Code. The arrêté 
(government legal document signed by the Minister of Mines) was approved on 21st May 2010 
(No. 04638 MMITPME/DMG) and is valid until May 2019. One three-year extension is allowed 
after May 2019. On completion of a final feasibility study (FS) and if Barrick takes the decision to 
construct a mine, a mining permit will be sought for the Kanoumba Permit. 

1.3. Geology and Mineralisation 

Regionally, Massawa is located on the over 150 km long NE trending Main Transcurrent Shear 
Zone (MTZ), which is a significant transcrustal dislocation between the Mako Belt (basaltic flow 
rocks, minor intercalated volcaniclastics, and ultramafic sub-volcanic intrusions) and the Diale-
Dalema Basin (volcano-sedimentary to sedimentary rocks) within the Paleoproterozoic (Birimian) 
Kedougou-Kenieba inlier. Mineralisation is present within various lithologies but is structurally 
controlled within anastomosing shears which converge to the north.  

The Massawa deposit is differentiated into two zones, CZ and NZ, based on differing host rock 
geology, mineralogy, geometallurgical response and structural controls. Both zones are further 
divided into two sub-zones. CZ marks the southerly extent of the deposit and is hosted mainly in 
volcaniclastics, felsic porphyries, and gabbroic intrusions. In the CZ, multiple thin, NE trending, 
sub-vertical mineralized shears have been identified, each with average thicknesses between 3 
m and 10 m and which anastomose horizontally and vertically along strike. Mineralisation in the 
individual lodes is domained into:  

• A distal zone of lower-grade, broad halo of disseminated pyrite and minor arsenopyrite. 

• A proximal zone of quartz-stibnite veins and disseminated arsenopyrite and minor pyrite. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 3 

The proximal mineralisation contains 80% of the grade in the CZ with coarse visible Au within the 
veins and Au inclusions within the arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite disseminations along the 
silicified contacts of the intrusive rocks. 

The northern part of the CZ pit represents a transition zone between CZ and NZ, with structures 
merging into one main mineralised shear which continues towards the north. NZ has a strike 
length of 2.5 km and consists of a main NNE trending mineralised structure with discontinuous 
footwall (FW) and hanging wall (HW) lodes. NZ is further sub-divided into two zones based on 
structure (NZ1 and NZ2). The southern 1.1 km of the NZ (NZ1) hosts discontinuous, weaker gold 
mineralisation (average grade of 1 g/t Au to 1.5 g/t Au). The higher-grade but narrow 
mineralisation is focussed at the margins of a medium-grained greywacke and lithological 
contacts with contrasting grain size.  

NZ2 represents the northern and highest-grade (above 4 g/t Au) portion of the deposit. 
Mineralisation is predominately confined to a single, continuous, narrow zone (10 m to 15 m 
average width), which is sub-vertical to steeply dipping (>70°) to the WNW. The mineralisation 
consists of fine disseminated arsenopyrite and pyrite associated with carbonate and sericite 
alteration. Gold mineralisation in the NZ is largely refractory in nature, locked up in the crystal 
lattice of arsenopyrite. 

Sofia is located approximately 8 km to the west of Massawa, along the Sofia-Sabodala Shear 
Zone which hosts the Sabodala gold deposit approximately 20 km to the north. The deposit has 
been differentiated into two zones based on different structural trends along the tectono-
stratigraphic boundary. At Sofia Main the primary structures strike 040°, whereas at Sofia North 
mineralized structures strike 010°. 

Mineralisation at Sofia Main is defined by a linear altered shear zone, where the mineralisation is 
thought to be structurally controlled. The majority of the high-grade mineralisation (above 2 g/t 
Au) is situated within a plunging tabular dilation zone, which is modelled to terminate on the FW 
structure. There are also a number of small discontinuous FW splays of mineralisation. 

Sofia North consists of one main NNE trending mineralized structure and a discontinuous FW 
lode. The main mineralised structure that controls the alteration is developed at the major eastern 
contact of the Western Mafics that turns in strike from 040° to 010° and has been delineated over 
more than 2 km by trenching and reverse circulation (RC) drilling. 

Delya consists of three parallel zones of mineralisation, over a one-kilometre strike length. The 
main zone of mineralisation is hosted at the lower margin of the gabbro within highly sheared and 
silicified and sericitised schist. The mineralised zone varies in thickness from 3 m to 10 m 
(average of 5 m), contains higher grades (up to 5 g/t Au), and dips to the east at 85°. The other 
branches are located to the west and have an average dip of 84° to the west. Mineralisation has 
been drill tested to a vertical depth of 150 m below the surface. The mineralisation consists of 
strong disseminated fine arsenopyrite and pyrite. Gold is largely refractory in nature and locked 
up in the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite. 

Two satellite deposits with Inferred Mineral Resources occur in a 15 km radius around Massawa 
(Tina and Bambaraya). 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 4 

Tina target is located along the Bakan Corridor, where mineralisation is controlled by the 
Kossanto Shear. Two mineralized branches have been identified; a main western branch, which 
is steeply dipping, occurs on two sub-parallel sets and is hosted by a felsic intrusion and a set of 
eastern lower grade mineralised branches that are related to shears within the tuffs and 
gossanous rocks. Gold mineralisation is primarily associated with disseminated pyrite sulphide 
assemblages, which are non-refractory in nature. 

Bambaraya is located in the NW corner of the Kanoumba Permit along the Sabodala Shear 
Corridor, approximately 18 km to the north of Sofia. The NE trending shear zone marks the 
brecciated contact between pillowed basalts and massive and foliated andesites. These volcanic 
rocks have been intruded by gabbro, dolerite, and felsic plutonic rocks in the vicinity of the 
deposit.  

1.4. Exploration Concepts 

Randgold's extensive integrated exploration programmes resulted in the greenfield discoveries 
of the of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya deposits.  

The Massawa, Sofia, and Delya soil anomalies were initially discovered during the regional 
Kounemba soil grid sampling programme in 2004 by Randgold Senegal. This was followed up by 
detailed soil, regolith, and lithological mapping. Field validation of soil anomalies returned 
mineralised rock chip samples and the first trench identified an intersection of 10.9 m at 2.03 g/t 
Au. This was followed up by rotary air blast (RAB) drilling and then diamond drilling. Initial wide 
spaced diamond drill lines, spaced approximately 400 m apart, were used to determine the strike 
length of mineralisation. Subsequent infill drilling programmes have been completed to build a 
geological model on the controls of mineralisation and to generate mineral resources.  

1.5. Status of Exploration 

Recent exploration has been heavily focussed on better understanding the geological controls 
and the grade distribution along the Massawa CZ deposit and particularly how these relate to the 
mineability and metallurgy. Drilling of orientation grade control (GC) grids has led to an increased 
understanding of the structural and lithological controls on the quartz-stibnite veins and 
surrounding mineralisation. A resource drilling programme at 15 m by 10 m has allowed for 
modelling the continuity of the coarse gold lodes within the pit.  

Follow-up trenching in Massawa NZ and RC drilling over a 150 m strike (5 m by 10 m hole 
spacing) has confirmed the continuity and high-grade nature of mineralisation in the NZ, with the 
remainder of the pit being drilled at 40 m by 40 m.  

Infill surface trenching, RC, and diamond drilling to a nominal 40 m by 40 m spacing have been 
completed over the Sofia Main, Sofia North, and Delya deposits. This has confirmed the 
geological continuity and enabled the estimation of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources for 
these satellite pits.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 5 

1.6. Status of Development and Operations 

The Project has been competed to a feasibility level as of the 31st December 2018. Indicated 
Mineral Resources and Probable Ore Reserves have been estimated at Massawa CZ and NZ, 
Sofia Main, Sofia North, and Delya.  

1.7. Mineral Resource Estimate 

The Massawa Mineral Resources consist of Massawa CZ, Massawa NZ, Sofia, Tina, Delya, and 
Bambaraya.  

The CZ, NZ, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources were re-estimated during 2018 using updated 
geological interpretations generated from both resource definition and advanced GC (AdvGC) 
drilling completed as part of the pre-feasibility study (PFS). Additionally, modifying factors for 
reserve definition have been updated and refined, including updated mining costs, selectivity, 
and recoveries, which are incorporated as part of the cut-off grade criteria. All Mineral Resource 
pit optimisations and associated underground reporting areas have been updated accordingly. 

The 2018 AdvGC drill programmes in CZ, Sofia, and Delya were designed to determine the 
optimal drill spacing required to outline an accurate local estimation, which could be used during 
the mining process.  

Outside of the three principal deposits (Massawa, Sofia, and Delya), Inferred Mineral Resources 
exist for two satellite projects (Bambaraya and Tina). No exploration has taken place on 
Bambaraya and Tina since the last Mineral Resource estimate in 2013. The satellite deposits 
have been delineated at 50 m to 100 m spaced drilling and thus estimated using inverse distance 
squared and as such have been classified as Inferred Mineral Resources. These satellite Inferred 
Mineral Resources represent less than 28% of the total declared tonnes and less than 7% of the 
contained gold ounces of the Project. Accordingly, they do not form part of the declared Ore 
Reserve and have no impact on the current economic evaluation of the Project. Further 
exploration programmes are planned to be completed on these satellites to evaluate their 
prospectively with additional resource development. 

As at 31st December 2018, the open pit (OP) Indicated Mineral Resource is estimated to be 23 
Mt at an average grade of 4.00 g/t Au containing 2.97 Moz of gold and the OP Inferred Mineral 
Resource is estimated to be 3.7 Mt at an average grade of 2.2 g/t Au for 0.26 Moz of gold. An 
underground Inferred Mineral Resource, situated below the NZ1 and NZ2 open pit solid, is 
estimated to be 2.6 Mt at an average grade of 4.1 g/t Au containing 0.35 Moz gold (Table 1-1).

Open pit Mineral Resources are reported as the insitu mineral resources falling within the $1,500/oz pit shell reported at an average 
cut-off grade of 0.8 g/t Au. 
Underground Mineral Resources are those insitu mineral resources below the $1,500/oz pit shell of the North Zone 2 deposit reported 
at a 2.5 g/t Au cut-off grade. 
Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves. 
Mineral Resources for Massawa were generated by Simon Bottoms, MGeol, FGS CGeol, FAusIMM, an employee of the company 
and Qualified Person. 

Barrick is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource 
estimate. 

The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared according to the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves standards and guidelines 
published and maintained by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of 
Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia (the 
JORC (2012) Code). Barrick has reconciled the Mineral Resources to Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources, Mineral 
Reserves dated 10th May 2014 as incorporated into NI 43-101, and there are no material 
differences. 

1.8. Ore Reserve Estimate 

The Massawa Ore Reserves have been estimated in accordance with the JORC (2012) Code. 
Barrick has reconciled the Ore Reserve to CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves dated 10th May 2014 as incorporated in NI 43-101, and there are no material 
differences. 

Only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources have been used for the conversion to Ore 
Reserves and thus the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya deposits have been incorporated into 
reserves. Tina, Bambaraya, and Massawa North Zone Underground only contain Inferred 
Resources and, therefore, have not been converted to Ore Reserves. 

The 2018 Ore Reserve estimate includes an OP Probable Ore Reserve of 7.1 Mt at 4.69 g/t Au 
for 1.1 Moz Au from the Massawa CZ; 4.6 Mt at 4.9 g/t Au for 0.72 Moz Au from the Massawa 
NZ; 5.7 Mt at 2.9 g/t Au for 0.54 Moz Au for Sofia; and 0.7 Mt at 4.4 g/t Au for 0.92 Moz for Delya. 
The OP Ore Reserves are those reserves occurring within a $1,000/oz pit design. 

Total Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Ore Reserve estimates, as of 31st December 2018, are 
presented in Table 1-2.

*Attributable gold (Moz) refers to the quantity attributable to Barrick based on Barrick's 83.25% interest in the Massawa Project.  
Open pit Ore Reserves are reported at a gold price of $1,000/oz and include dilution and ore loss factors.  
Open pit Ore Reserves were generated by Shaun Gillespie, an employee of the company, under the supervision of Rodney Quick, 
MSc, Pr Sci Nat. an officer of the company and Qualified Person. 

Barrick is not aware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or other relevant 
factors that could materially affect the Ore Reserve estimate. 

1.9. Technical and Financial Study 

A technical and financial study has been conducted by Barrick to support the disclosure of 
updated Ore Reserves. The study is based on an open pit mining project whereby the ore is 
mined and fed through an on-site metallurgical plant to produce gold in doré. 

1.9.1. Dilution and Ore Loss  

Mining dilution of 10% and ore loss of 3% were applied to the Massawa NZ, Sofia, and Delya 
deposits, based on knowledge of similar ore bodies at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex.  

The CZ dilution of 36% and ore loss of 8% was applied based on a grade control optimisation 
dilution study carried out by Maptek taking into account the very narrow nature in areas of the CZ 
ore body. 

1.9.2. Hydrogeology 

The hydrogeological assessment for the Massawa mining feasibility evaluation found naturally 
shallow groundwater levels across the site (typically 10 m to 30 m below surface), and therefore 
groundwater inflow to the excavations will occur throughout mining. The groundwater inflow 
horizons are associated with the near surface weathered horizons, and the NNE-SSW fracture 
zones and lithological contacts at depth. In general, the sedimentary units are more permeable 
than the igneous units.  

The inflows depend on the hydraulic characteristics of the units, the pit size, and the mining 
advance rate. Due to the accelerated mining rate of each pit (up to 40 m per year), high 
groundwater drawdown rates need to be achieved to keep pace with the operation. The likely 
range of pumping rates per pit during their Life of Mine (LOM) are as follows:  

• Massawa Central Zone Pit: average 70 L/s (range: 19 – 96 L/s). 

• Massawa North Zone 1 Pit: average 43 L/s (range: 32 – 72 L/s). 

• Massawa North Zone 2 Pit: average 18 L/s (range: 7 – 21 L/s. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 8 

• Sofia Main Pit: average 10 L/s (range: 1 – 14 L/s). 

• Sofia Main Satellite Pit: average 3 L/s (range: 2 – 4 L/s). 

• Sofia North Pit: average 17 L/s (range: 12 – 22 L/s). 

• Delya North Pit: average 3 L/s (range 1 – 3 L/s). 

• Delya South Pit: <1 L/s. 

According to the geophysical surveys, the monitoring data, the insitu hydraulic testing, and the 
calibrated numerical forecast models, the majority of the groundwater can be intercepted by 
perimeter and in-pit dewatering wells (approximately 80% of groundwater inflow). The remaining 
water will be drained using sub-horizontal drains drilled into the pit wall. This groundwater 
seepage will collect in the in-pit sumps.  

The geotechnical slope stability analysis can therefore be based on 'drained' or 'dry' pit slopes. 
In addition to seepage water, the in-pit sumps' storage volume and pumping capacity are 
designed to retain and evacuate a 1:50 year return period storm event (183 mm/24 hours). The 
size of each sump varies between <1,000 m3 and 40,000 m3 and can be accommodated along 
the pit floor.  

The capital and recurring capital investment for the dewatering system is estimated to amount to 
a minimum of $16.5 million for all pits combined. This investment is spread across the LOM in 
accordance with the mine advance rates. The operating costs are estimated to be in the order of 
$3.7 million. An additional contingency should be built into the final costs calculations as 
adjustments and modifications to mine dewatering plans commonly occur.  

1.9.3. Geotechnical Slope Design Parameters 

The slope design is defined in terms of three material types: 

• Soils: free digging, shovel dressed benches with face angle at 60°; dewatering measures. 

• Broken Rock: loosening blasts with vertical buffer wall row and shovel dressed nominal 
bench face angles. 

• Rock: Twin benching with wall control blasting using inclined pre-split, buffer and trim 
shots; wall drilling angle and berm width varies by domain, mid-level operating offset 2 m. 

The standard operating lift (single bench height) has been taken across all material types and 
domains.  

The soils slope design applies across the area and does not depend upon the orientation of the 
pit walls. The soils slopes, which are dependent on the vertical wall height, are differentiated into 
two categories:  

• Slopes down to <40 m depth (top four benches): generally 44° inter-ramp (I-R) or as 
locally adjustment for vulnerable slopes 

• Slopes where the saprolite/saprock are deeper than or equal to 40 m depth, or zones of 
vulnerability: 40° I-R 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 9 

The Broken Rock slopes occur as determined by the base-of-soft and top of fresh planning 
surfaces. The zone may be absent, or in the greatest extent encountered, 40 m thick. Design 
geometry reflects the rock slope design, but the wall drilling is vertical and the berm widths are 
wider to accommodate more loose rock. 

The Rock slopes are divided into two domains according the position of the wall with respect to 
the mineralised zones: 

• HW 

• FW 

The bench face drilling angles and the berm width vary, giving different I-R angles, for each 
domain and for each of the properties, according to the specific stability conditions indicated by 
the probabilistic discontinuity-controlled failure analysis.  

1.9.4. Mining Method 

The mining method proposed for this study is conventional drill and blast followed by truck and 
excavator. Due to the narrow, multi lode and sub-vertical nature of the ore body with a likely strip 
ratio of 7.6:1, an open pit mining method is proposed using 2.0 m flitches in ore blasted in 10 m 
benches, with movement limiting methods such as choke blasting being suggested to minimise 
dilution.  

Using a processing rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) per pit as the current target, a 
mine life of nine years is expected. Based on the average LOM strip ratio of approximately 7:6 
(based upon year by year strip ratio), this requires an average digging rate of approximately 
6 Mtpa per excavator.  

Mine scheduling of the OP reserve is dictated by the different metallurgical ore domains present. 
The plan focusses on the mining of the oxide and oxidised transition material from all pits first, 
followed by Sofia fresh, then CZ fresh, and finally Massawa NZ and Delya refractory ore.  

Randgold has used various mining contractors over the last 20 years in West Africa and has a 
firm idea of realistic and achievable rates, productivities, and costs in the region. Mining costs 
have been based on contract tenders for $3.55/t over the life of the mining operation. The mining 
cost covers drill, blast, load, and haul from the open pit to the Run-of-Mine (ROM) pad, as well 
as the re-handle of the mined material into the primary crusher. In addition, there are owner's 
costs that cover water management, grade control, survey, and mine management. The open pit 
mining schedule is presented in Table 1-3.

The grade profile increases as the depth increases due to the plunging nature of the high grade 
in the NZ. Initial years are dominated by oxide material followed by significant hard rock mining 
from year 3 onwards (Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2).

A total of 3.55 Mt of ore will be hauled from the Sofia pit to the ROM pad at Massawa. The hauling 
cost has been calculated at $3.20/t hauled. This amounts to a total of $11.35 million over the 
LOM based upon existing contracts from other Barrick operating mines.  

1.9.6. Processing and Metallurgy 

The Massawa deposits consist of free-milling ore in Sofia and most of CZ, and a refractory portion 
in the northern part of CZ as well as NZ and Delya fresh. The refractory ores have been proven 
to be highly recoverable through bacterial oxidation (BIOX) as an oxidative step. 

The CZ and the refractory ore contain deleterious elements such as arsenic (As) and antimony 
(Sb). Where the CZ is not processed through BIOX, testwork has proven that the As and Sb can 
be removed successfully by a precipitation plant designed by Multotec. During the refractory 
processing phase, the neutralisation section of the BIOX plant will remove the precipitate and 
these elements. As an additional mitigation, the Multotec precipitation plant will process any liquor 
that is released from the tailings storage facility (TSF) to the environment. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 12 

There have been a number of testwork programmes completed on Massawa ores. Some testwork 
was performed to help validate the results of historic studies. During the PFS and FS phases, 
several trade-offs were completed. Process specific trade-offs were generated and used as part 
of process development, and ultimately the design of the plant.  

The extensive metallurgical testwork campaigns demonstrate two distinct behavioural patterns 
where some ore sources, in particular the oxides, and some fresh rock sulphide sources from 
Sofia Main, Sofia North, and most of CZ, exhibit free-milling characteristics suitable for gold 
extraction by a conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) process. These ores also contain gravity 
recoverable gold (GRG). In CZ, the GRG can be as high as 50% of the available gold.  

Other ore sources in the north of CZ, the NZ pit, and Delya exhibit very low GRG and are highly 
refractory. Flotation and BIOX is combined to achieve recoveries in excess of 85% overall. The 
flotation tailings grades achieved in the testwork were below 0.4 g/t Au and exhibited very low 
CIL recoveries. 

The Massawa plant design has to cater to these observations through two distinct processing 
circuits which will run sequentially: 

• For the first seven years, the free-milling ore sources will run through a conventional 
gravity and CIL circuit, which includes an arsenic and antimony precipitation processing 
plant before TSF release to environment. 

• From year 7 onwards, the refractory ore sources are processed through a flotation circuit 
with a concentrate fine grinding step to P80 = 45 µm, followed by a BIOX step and CIL. 

Sampling for testwork, was completed by the geologists in conjunction with the modelled and 
simulated pits and mine plans. The samples were selected to ensure spatial as well as geological 
representivity. This approach ensured that the testwork completed is representative and that the 
optimal results can be incorporated with high confidence into the design criteria, and ultimately 
the plant design and sizing. 

1.9.7. Recovery 

The gold recovery achieved from the free-milling ores is highly dependent on the grade processed 
through the circuit. 

A best fit linear curve was drawn to give predicted tails grade from head grade values, and using 
this relationship, predicted tails were calculated for each head grade and the corresponding gold 
dissolution were determined. The predicted gold dissolution for the given head assays provides 
a method for predicting the recovery of a reserve, given its feed grade. 

CZ was a special case exhibiting a wide range of recoveries along strike with the result that a 
specific geometallurgical recovery curve was generated for this ore body based largely on grade 
but also the position of the lodes.  

Table 1-7 provides a summary of the recoveries per ore type and weathering.

The proposed whole ore leach (WOL) and refractory process plant design is based on well-known 
and established gravity/CIL technology, which consists of crushing, milling, and gravity recovery 
of free gold followed by leaching/adsorption of gravity tailings, elution and gold smelting, and 
tailings disposal. The refractory process which includes sulphide flotation, regrind, and BIOX 
process, is also a well-known technology which will be supplied by Outotec at a later stage. 
Services for the plant will include reagent mixing, storage and distribution, water, and air services. 

1.9.8. Processing Operating Cost 

Operational expenditure is derived from first principles and reagent consumptions directly related 
to testwork. Benchmarking and the SENET in-house database was used for any assumptions 
when data was not available.  

Plant costs average of $21.2/t ore but include a range of costs dependent on ore feed and process 
route. The process operating costs were generated based on the various process routes possibly 
required. All of the deposits were considered including Massawa CZ, Massawa MZ, Sofia Main, 
Sofia North, and Delya, thus the operating cost estimate was split by the various ore types as 
shown in Table 1-8.

1.9.9. Deleterious Elements 

Mitigation measures are described below and the associated costs have been captured within 
the unit process operating costs. 

Cyanide 

Massawa chooses to abide by the guidelines of the International Cyanide Code. The TSF design 
has been lined with a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner. Protocols call for limited threshold 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 14 

discharges to the TSF and cyanide discharge concentrations are controlled through use of an 
on-line cyanide analyser and controller. Further mitigation is included at the discharge end of the 
TSF, where a polishing cyanide destruction step can be included to ensure legal requirements 
are met before release to the environment. During the refractory ore treatment, an additional 
ASTER cyanide destruction facility, also situated at the TSF, is added to destroy the thiocyanate 
to below the 7 ppm level. 

Arsenic, Antimony and Copper 

The CZ, NZ, and Delya ores have a presence of arsenic, copper, and antimony. The NZ and 
Delya material is processed through a neutralisation step within the BIOX circuit of the main plant. 
Arsenic and other deleterious elements are, to a large extent, eradicated before any tailings are 
pumped to the TSF.  

Testwork has proven that all three deleterious elements can be precipitated and meet the 
stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
standards through mitigation measures via a precipitation plant through which any water released 
from the TSF to the diversion dam will be processed. The plant is of a modular construction 
capable of treating in increments up to a maximum of 300 m3/h. 

In-pit dewatering and other waste dump run-off also indicated the presence of arsenic and 
antimony. These are at much lower levels and a simple greensand filtration system has been 
included in the design, which is highly effective at simple absorption at these lower 
concentrations. The greensand is manufactured by coating the mineral glauconite with 
manganese dioxide, while pyrolusite is a naturally mined ore composed of solid manganese 
dioxide. Greensand media is commercially available and has been shown to be capable of 
removing up to 80% of arsenic by oxidation/adsorption. The filtration sands are then replaced 
every two years and the plant can treat up to 600 m3/h.   

1.9.10. Logistics and Transport 

Transport to site is not expected to pose any issues. A central store at Massawa will hold all 
supplies for the Project and the same transport route as presently used for the Loulo Mine will be 
used at Massawa. Access from Dakar to Massawa will be via the new sealed Millennium highway 
linking Dakar to Bamako. An all-weather laterite service road will run between the sealed road 
and the mine.  

The supply chain will be outsourced to a specialist service provider. Capital goods and services 
will be sourced from the most cost-effective source. Bulk specialized capital items will be sourced 
locally whenever feasible; where not available locally, capital goods and consumables will be 
sourced from the rest of the world, given the favourable costs and freight rates for shipment to 
Senegal. 

1.9.11. Social and Environmental 

Independent consultants Digby Wells Environmental (Jersey) Limited (Digby Wells), in 
conjunction with Tropica Environmental Consultants (Tropica) of Senegal, were contracted to 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 15 

conduct the environmental and social impact assessment of the proposed Massawa Mine. As is 
common with mining projects in West Africa, several potential positive and potential negative 
impacts have been identified. An environmental and social management plan (ESMP) has been 
completed to ensure these impacts are systematically and correctly managed. 

Potential positive impacts include: 

• Employment opportunities. 

• Local procurement of goods.   

• Skills development. 

• Increase in local trade. 

• Increased contribution to the national economy. 

• Community Development Plan (Education and training, local economic development and 
infrastructural improvements for local communities including roads, schools, clinics, water 
provision etc). 

• No physical resettlement required. 

Potential negative impacts include: 

• Dust and noise generation. 

• Visual impact due to the development of rock dumps. 

• Migration of job seekers to the area. 

• Removal of artisanal and small-scale miners out of the mining permit. 

• Direct and indirect impacts to critical biodiversity and habitat within the Niokolo-Koba 
National Park catchment. 

• Disturbance of populations of Critically Endangered Western Chimpanzee populations 
confirmed within the planned mining area. 

No impacts which could present a fatal flaw to the successful execution of the Project have been 
identified to date. The ESMP includes a number of recommended mitigation measures that, if 
implemented effectively, will enhance the positive impacts of the Project, and minimise the 
negative effects. With this effective implementation of the ESMP, none of the negative impacts 
are believed to be sufficiently significant to prevent the development of the proposed Project. The 
potential positive impacts associated with the local and national Senegalese economies are 
expected to be significant.  

1.9.12. Human Resources 

Barrick's well tested and proven human resources policies and procedures including mine safety, 
amended where necessary, will be applied on the Project. Barrick's policy is to promote nationals 
of the host country to manage the Project. Where locally qualified and experienced staff are not 
available, recruitment from elsewhere is undertaken, with the clear understanding that local 
personnel are given the training and experience required to allow them to replace the expatriates 
as soon as possible. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 16 

The Project will comprise the following phases:  

1. Pre-construction phase. 
2. Construction phase. 
3. Operational phase throughout the life of mine. 
4. Closure and rehabilitation phase. 

Community consultation, liaison, and development will be a key focus throughout each of the 
above-mentioned phases, and the Project will employ experts on community development to 
ensure that effective and constructive relationships with the communities surrounding the mine 
are maintained. 

The Project will comply with the guidelines set out in the Senegalese Labour Code  

The Project will comply with all labour provisions as enacted in 'The Employment Act' – Law 
No97-17 of 1st December 1997 and 'The Industrial and Labour Relations Act' Paragraph 2 of the 
law of 15th December 1952 as well as the provisions from the National Collective Inter-
Professional Convention of 27th May 2082 and the Mining Code Law n°2003-36 of 24th November 
2003. The above conventions will be used when recruiting employees and will base recruitment 
decisions on qualifications and experience required to do the job. Preference will be given 
throughout all phases of the Project to job applicants with the required competencies or 
qualifications in the following order: 

1. Applicants from the local villages surrounding the Project. 
2. Candidates who reside in the administrative area, then the region, then from other parts 

of Senegal. 
3. Candidates from other West African countries. 
4. If qualified candidates are not available from the previously mentioned areas, qualified 

candidates from other countries will be sourced.  

It is expected that at the peak of the construction phase of the Project approximately 2,000 
construction employees would be employed on the Project.  

During the operational phase of the mine, it is envisaged that 1,500 employees would be 
employed as Massawa Mine employees, including contractors (Table 1-9). During the operational 
phase, the majority would be provided by the mining contractor. Other contractors would include 
security. Where possible national suppliers will be used, which will have a multiplier effect on the 
national economy.

1.9.13. Infrastructure 

The selected Massawa site is a greenfield site without any existing infrastructure although some 
laterite roads do exist, providing access to local villages scattered around the area.  

The on-site infrastructure required will be related to the processing plant and the supporting 
facilities as follows: 

• In-plant access roads. 

• Plant buildings. 

• Plant reagents and consumables stores. 

• Process plant site drainage. 

• Sewerage disposal. 

• Security. 

• Water supply. 

• Communications. 

• Power supply. 

The proposed infrastructure will support the mining and plant operations. The main off-site 
infrastructure required for the development of the Project will be the following: 

• Airstrip. 

• Road network. 

• Office complex. 

• Accommodation facilities. 

• Rail infrastructure. 

• Diesel fuel storage and refuelling facility. 

• Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) / Light Fuel Oil (LFO) storage facility. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 18 

• Power plant. 

• Water supply system. 

• Waste management. 

• Sewerage disposal site. 

1.9.14. General and Administration 

General and administration (G&A) costs cover all operational costs outside of mining and 
processing. They include administrative, finance, medical, environmental, and social costs, 
together with outside engineering which covers all engineering costs outside of the processing 
plant. The G&A cost equates to $8.60/t of ore processed over the LOM. This correlates well on a 
gross level to Barrick's Tongon Mine, which is also a West African coastal country operation.  

1.9.15. Capital Costs 

The capital programme is broken into a number of phases with each phase employing additional 
processing units and technology to optimally recover the gold content.  

• Phase 1: Initial capital to construct the mine and treat oxide and oxidised transition is 
expended over the first two years of the Project. 

• Phase 2: Processing of fresh ore from Sofia and CZ deposits commences. The processing 
of Sofia fresh ore will continue as per the Phase 1 leach and detoxification process. CZ 
ore will be processed through a gravity circuit prior to CIL.  

• Phase 3: Construction of the BIOX circuit takes place in year six which will be designed 
to process the sulphide material in the northern part of the CZ, NZ, and Delya pits.  

Table 1-10 lists the capital cost estimate by phase.

1.10. Economic Analysis 

1.10.1. Basis of the Economic Analysis 

An economic assessment to confirm the reserve status of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya pits 
was carried out based on the key parameters summarised below: 

• Total ore mined from Massawa, Sofia Main, and Delya pits of 18 Mt of ore at an average 
grade of 4.2 g/t Au containing 2.4 Moz of gold. 

• Strip ratio of 7.6:1 to give total tonnes mined of 156 Mt. 

• Mining costs average of $3.55/t mined over the LOM. 

• Haulage cost average of $1.20/t of ore milled over the LOM ($0.18/t km hauled). 

• Plant cost average of $21.33/t ore but include a range of costs dependant on ore feed 
and process route. 

• G&A costs of $8.76/t ore milled over LOM, including outside engineering costs. 

• Pre-production related capital amounts $16.9 million. $80 million will be spent on pre-
production mining and absorbed in Total Cash Cost as the ore is fed. 

• Capital construction cost of $413 million.  

• On-going capital of $12 million over the LOM. 

• Rehabilitation cost of $23 million at the end of the LOM. 

The financial model is based on annual cash flow projections, with technical and economic 
parameters stated above using constant money terms. No escalation or de-escalation has been 
applied. In generating the financial model for the operations at the Project, the following principles 
were adopted:  

• Financial implication on the methods of funding was not evaluated, since it has been 
assumed that the Project will be financed by Barrick. 

• Annual figures are based on financial years 1st January to 31st December. 

• Real term annual cash flows were used to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR), net 
present values (NPV), and simple and discounted payback periods in real after-tax terms. 

• Costs up to start of construction are considered as sunk costs. 

• No salvage value for plant and equipment on cessation of operations was included. 

• Calculations are based in US dollars ($). 

1.10.2. Production and Cash Flow Forecast 

The estimated production and cash flow forecast are summarised in Table 1-12. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report

1.10.3. Financial Analysis 

A financial model was run using a $1,000/oz gold price feeding the reserve mining schedule, 
together with a 3% royalty on revenue, seven-year tax holiday (two-year construction, five years 
for operation), followed by corporate tax at a 25% rate, which produced a total net cash flow after 
tax of $258 million, and IRR of 12%. Payback is five years from start of production. A sensitivity 
table on NPV, IRR, and payback against gold price is supplied in Table 1-13. The Project is 
profitable at $1,000/oz and thus justified to be reported as an Ore Reserve at $1,000/oz gold 
price.

IRR 12% 25% 37% 
Payback 5 years 2.8 years 2.4 years 

1.10.4. Government Revenue 

The government revenue earnings from the Project are sourced from the following assumptions 
incorporated into the financial model: 

• 3% royalty on revenue. 

• Tax rate of 25%. Payments are made throughout the year after the seven-year tax holiday 
from issuance of the mining permit. 

• Dividends from 10% free carry share of the Project, which are payable after capital has 
been redeemed. 

• Other taxes which include withholding taxes on dividends and salaries.  

Under the current Kounemba Convention, Barrick will be exempt from all taxes, levies, and duties 
for a period of seven years from issuance of the mining title.  

A sensitivity of expected government revenue based on the cash flow is detailed in Table 1-14

1.10.5. Sensitivity Analysis 

The proposed Project is profitable at current gold prices, but sensitive to gold price fluctuations 
and therefore becomes a marginal project at gold prices lower than $1,000/oz, but very attractive 
at current or higher gold prices (Table 22-4Table 1-15).

The Project is fairly resilient to grade changes and at current gold prices would be able to absorb 
a 10% reduction in grade (Table 1-16). The Project is sensitive to gold price fluctuations with a 
$1,000/oz and a 20% reduction in grade making the Project very marginal. Conversely, at higher 
gold prices than current, the Project is very resilient to a grade reduction.

At current gold prices, the Project can absorb a 20% increase in operating costs and still remains 
largely profitable (Table 1-17). The Project will require a gold price of less than $1,000/oz and an 
increase of 20% in operating costs to become a marginal project.

The Project is sensitive to increases in capital cost (Table 1-18). At a $1,000/oz gold prices, an 
increase of 10% on capital reduces the NPV by $42 million, or 16% of the NPV.

1.11. Implementation 

The FS capital cost estimate has been compiled on the basis that Barrick will adopt an 
Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) approach to implementing 
and executing the Project.  

Upon the onset of the Project and following a formal EPCM Contractor tender, selection, and 
award process to be conducted by Barrick, some 1st Phase early project execution activities may 
take place such as front-end engineering and design (FEED) of critical deliverables, which can 
commence in the first quarter of 2019 as Project approval is expected from both the Senegal 
government and the Barrick Board before June 2019. 

The implementation strategy to be adopted is generally structured into four broad stages 
undertaken by the successful EPCM Contractor under the direct auspices of Barrick: 

• Detailed design of the process plant and infrastructure whereby the FS capital cost 
estimate is further developed into a Barrick approved and EPCM controlled budget 
estimate for the Project going forward during execution.  

• Procurement comprising formal tender, adjudication, award and thereafter fabrication and 
expediting with logistics undertaken by the Barrick nominated logistics supplier.  

• Construction management and cost control.  

• Commissioning management and handover to operations. 

1.12. Alternate Case Ore Reserves and Economics at $1,200/oz Gold 
Price 

Historically Barrick estimates its Ore Reserves using a gold price assumption of $1,200/oz. In 
order to investigate the effect on the Massawa Gold Project of using a $1,200/oz gold price, an 
alternate case has been prepared which results in the following upsides to the Project: 

• A reduction in the cut-off grade results in an increase in the total Ore Reserves at a slightly 
lower grade, thus extending the mine life by 1.5 years. 

• The size of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya pits is increased by 6%. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 23 

• The increase in the total Ore Reserves results in a more efficient use of capital as the 
capital construction cost is expended over more tonnes. 

For the alternate case the Ore Reserve was rerun at a gold price of $1,200/oz. No changes have 
been made to the mining dilution, ore loss, or gold recovery between the base case and the 
alternate case. For the alternate case, the cut-off grade for each of the deposits was re-estimated 
based on the higher gold price. A life of mine plan for the alternate case was determined based 
on the $1,200/oz Ore Reserve.  

The 2018 Ore Reserve estimate for the alternate case at a $1,200/oz gold price includes an open 
pit (OP) Probable Ore Reserve of 7.8 Mt at 4.6 g/t Au for 1.2 Moz Au from the Massawa CZ; 5.2 
Mt at 4.7 g/t Au for 0.8 Moz Au from the Massawa NZ; 7.1 Mt at 2.7 g/t Au for 0.6 Moz Au for 
Sofia; and 0.81 Mt at 4.21 g/t Au for 0.11 Moz for Delya. The OP Ore Reserves are those reserves 
occurring within a $1,200/oz pit design. 

Total Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Ore Reserve estimates, as of 31st December 2018 within a 
$1,200/oz OP, are presented in Table 1-19.

*Attributable gold (Moz) refers to the quantity attributable to Barrick based on Barrick's 83.25% interest in the Massawa Project. Open 
pit Ore Reserves are reported at a gold price of $1,200/oz and include dilution and ore loss factors. Open pit Ore Reserves were 
generated by Shaun Gillespie, an employee of the company, under the supervision of Rodney Quick, MSc, Pr Sci Nat, an officer of 
the company and Qualified Person. 

A financial model was run on the alternate case using a $1,200/oz gold price feeding the 
alternative case reserve mining schedule, together with a 3% royalty on revenue, seven-year tax 
holiday (two year construction, five years for operation), followed by corporate tax at a 25% rate, 
which produced a total net cash flow after tax of $696 million, and IRR of 28%. Payback is 2.5 
years from start of production. Table 1-20 compares the base case financial model run at a 
$1,000/oz gold price versus the alternate case financial model run at a $1,200/oz gold price.

1.13. Interpretation and Conclusions 

Barrick has documented standard procedures for the drilling, logging, and sampling processes, 
which meet industry standards. The mineralisation wireframe parameters at Massawa, Sofia, and 
Delya are based on visibly identifiable geological contacts, which ensure that a geologically 
robust interpretation can be developed. Randgold's procedures ensure a reliable database of 
exploration information, but the implementation of a digital system is an opportunity for improving 
the systems and checks in place.  

Massawa Mineral Resources are estimated using industry accepted methods. Portions of the 
Massawa mineralisation have been recognised to have significantly higher grades than the 
remainder of the mineralisation, and the top cutting, domaining, and estimation approach taken 
by Randgold to limit the effects of the high grades is considered to be appropriate. The Qualified 
Persons consider the Mineral Resource estimates at the Project to be appropriately estimated 
and classified. 

The Qualified Persons concur with the parameters used in the Mineral Resource to Ore Reserve 
conversion process. 

The strategic focus for Massawa has been to prioritise the Sofia and CZ ore over the refractory 
ores of the Massawa NZ. Consequently, increasing the reserves of non-refractory material will 
further benefit the Project and active exploration work is continually underway targeting additional 
areas on the permit.  

The open pit mining operations at Massawa, Sofia, and Delya will consist of multiple open pits, 
i.e. CZ, NZ, Sofia Main, Sofia North, and Delya. The open pits are being planned to be mined by 
a mining contractor and a down-the-hole blasting service will be provided by an appropriate 
blasting contractor. The proposed mining method of conventional 90 t truck and excavator open 
pit mining is appropriate for the ore body and suitable dilution and ore loss factors have been 
applied. Randgold has significant experience in other mining operations in the region on similar 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 25 

ore bodies to Sofia, Delya, and NZ and has compared production, modification factors, and costs 
against these operations to ensure they are suitable. The CZ ore body has execution risk in that 
the bulk of the gold is hosted within thin lodes containing a large coarse gold component. Higher 
dilution and ore loss factors have been applied to this ore body to compensate. Any misallocation 
or misinterpretation of the CZ ore body will result in a loss of value. As such, a detailed GC 
programme will be an important requirement to successfully mine the CZ ore body. 

Significant testwork has already been undertaken on the various ore types from oxide and free 
leaching ores of Sofia, to the high gravity and partially refractory ores of the CZ and the highly 
refractory ores of the Massawa NZ and Delya. Based on testwork completed, the overall 
recoveries of 78% for the Project are realistic.   

The processing feed plan extends over a nine-year period where the WOL plant has a nameplate 
capacity of 2.4 Mtpa of fresh ore which can increase to 3.0 Mtpa when treating the softer oxides. 
The plant is divided into two streams, i.e. two parallel grinding ball mills form the hub of the 
processing plant. Each subsequent process route is implemented sequentially from a single 
stream. This means that the flotation circuit is erected well into the mine life in conjunction with 
the BIOX circuit, which matches the phase capital schedule. 

The completed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) analysis includes all 
required specialist studies. The Project is within the Niokolo-Koba headwaters and within a 
relatively environmentally pristine area. Significant effort has been made to generate an 
Environmental Management Plan that is practical and effective in minimising the impact of the 
Project on the environment. An inclusive transparent approach that utilises the concept of 
environmental offsets to benefit the regions biodiversity preservation will be implemented.  

1.14. Recommendations 

It is recommended that additional exploration be conducted to expand the non-refractory ore to 
extend the life of mine and improve the economics and pay back of the Project. It is recommended 
that the entire Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources be drilled to an AdvGC spacing 
suitable to the variography for each of the pit's ore types prior to commencement of mining.  

Process operating costs have been estimated based on specialist studies on the variable ore 
types and it is recommended that optimisation studies be undertaken on the CZ and BIOX 
amenable ore types to further optimise the process recoveries and costs. Mining costs have been 
developed from the first round of mining tender and it is recommended that the final mine plan 
be submitted to the short list of tender contractors to obtain the most efficient cost, and a trade-
off be done against an owner mining option. 

A full updated ESIA has been completed for the Project, and Environmental and Social 
Management workshops will be required including all affected parties to find practical and 
effective management measures to leverage the benefits of the Project to the region and the 
Senegalese economy, but minimise the negative impact on communities and environment. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 26 

It is recommended that Randgold, which owns the permit, submit an application to the 
Senegalese government to convert the Kanoumba Permit into a mining licence under the 
Senegalese 2003 Mining Code.  

It is further recommended that, upon approval of the mining permit by the Senegalese 
government, a new entity company be registered in Senegal into which the mining permit will be 
transferred, and at this stage the State will receive its participation interest in that company. It is 
the intention that the newly registered company will have a new name and that ownership of the 
Kanoumba Permit will be transferred into the newly formed company.  

As previously indicated, Randgold is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick following the 
merger transaction which was completed on 1st January 2019.

2. Introduction  

The Massawa Gold Project (Massawa or the Project), located in Senegal, was discovered by 
Randgold Resources Limited (Randgold), an exploration and mining company which explored, 
developed, and operated mines in West and East Africa.  

On 24th September 2018, Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) agreed to acquire Randgold in a 
share-for-share deal. The merger was completed on 1st January 2019 and resulted in Randgold 
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick and delisting from the stock exchange as a 
separately listed stock on 28th December 2018. The new company is still known as Barrick but 
its trading symbol on the NYSE has changed to GOLD, the ticker formerly held by Randgold on 
NASDAQ. On the TSX, the ticker remains ABX.  

This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure of 
Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) and has been prepared to support the public disclosure of the 2018 
year-end Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation at Massawa based on feasibility level 
(FS) studies. Recent targeted project development work programmes, including resource drilling 
and metallurgical testwork in 2017 and 2018, have made a material impact on the understanding 
of the mineralised bodies and potential of the Project to meet Randgold's corporate investment 
requirements. All currency in this report is US dollars ($) unless otherwise noted.

The Massawa gold deposit straddles the original Randgold Exploration Permit of Kanoumba in 
Eastern Senegal and is located approximately 700 km SE of the capital city, Dakar (Figure 4-1), 
and 90 km due west of the Barrick Loulo Mine in Mali. The deposit is positioned in the centre of 
the Kanoumba Permit (Figure 4-2). 

The original Kanoumering and Kounemba permits were granted to the company by Presidential 
Decrees in 2002 and 2003 and renewed twice by arêtes issued by the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines, the last of which merged the two original permits into the single Kanoumba Permit in 2010. 
The concession boundaries are described by latitude and longitude within the decree. The 
boundaries are located using a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS).

Figure 4-2 Kanoumba Permit 

The original Kanoumering exploration licence of 405 km2 was granted in October 2002 for an 
initial period of four years and further renewed for another three years in June 2006. As per the 
requirements in Senegal, this required a mandatory reduction in size of 102 km2 to a total of 303 
km2 (Table 4-1 and Table 4-2). The original Kounemba Exploration Permit of 408 km2 was 
granted in May 2003 for an initial period of four years. The first renewal occurred in August 2007 
for a further three year period with a reduction in size of 103 km2 to a total of 305 km2 (Table 4-1 
and Table 4-2). The exploration permits are exclusively and lawfully accessible for exploration 
and prospecting purposes and cannot be contested by any other mining company.

The State owns all mineral rights within Senegal. The terms of reference for exploration and 
mining are established through a convention ('Convention de Recherché') between the company 
and the State. The Senegalese government maintains a 10% free carried interest in all projects. 
The government's interest is activated at the Exploitation Stage, and a local mining subsidiary 
must be created. The subsidiary company is required to finance the 10% share of the State in 
the capital. The State does not contribute to the expenses for exploration, feasibility studies, 
development, or mining. In the case of an increase in the capital during the mine life, the State 
will receive a 10% free carried interest in the new investment in order to keep its participation at 
10%. 

Conventions under the 1988 Mining Code (Law No 88-06 of 26th August 1988) covered the 
original Kanoumering (2002) and Kounemba (2003) Permits. Subsequent to the 1988 Mining 
Code, an updated mining code was passed in November 2003 (Law No 2003-36 of 24th 
November 2003). Randgold had the right under the new code to accept the new code should it 
negotiate a new single convention that merged the two permits over the Project. This option was 
duly exercised, and on 14th April 2010 the two permits were combined into the single Kanoumba 
Permit with an area of 621 km2 covered by a single convention based on the 2003 Mining Code 
(Table 4-3). The arête was approved on 21st May 2010.

In 2016, the second renewal of an agreement with the Minister of Mine department combined 
parts of the Tomboronkoto, Miko, and Kanoumba Permits, with the newly merged permit covering 
an area of 606 km2 (Table 4-4).

It is worth noting that within the new 2003 Mining Code, the State can, over and above the 10% 
free carried interest, negotiate for itself or the local private sector a participation in the capital of 
the local mining company (Article 30 of LOI N° 2003-36 du 24th November 2003 Mining Code). 

Randgold's local partner Compagnie Senegalaise de Transports Transatlantiques Afrique de 
l'Ouest (CSSTAO) presently has 7.5% ownership of the remaining 90%, after the government 
10% participation, leaving Randgold with 83.25% ownership of the Project. As previously 
indicated, Randgold is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick following the merger transaction 
which was completed on 1st January 2019. 

Article 19 of the 2003 Mining Code, Rights of the Holder of a Prospection Permit, states: 'Any 
discovery of a commercially exploitable deposit by the holder of a prospection permit gives an 
exclusive right of the granting of an exploitation permit or mining concession of the said discovery 
if requested prior to the expiry of the prospection permit. 

There is a 3% royalty applicable on the Project. 

There are no known environmental liabilities to which the property is subject. The Gambia River 
flows in a westerly direction on the southern limit of the permit. 

There are no know significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability 
to perform work on the property.

5. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography  

Access to the Massawa Project is by road from Dakar in the west, or Loulo Mine via Mali from 
the east. The main transport route for capital equipment will be from the port of Dakar, by road to 
Mako, and to site via a dirt road. The Dakar - Kédougou National 7 road (RN7) cuts through the 
Tomboronkoto perimeter and has been recently upgraded. Upgrading of the road from Mako (see 
Figure 4-1)to site will be required to facilitate the transport of heavy equipment. The Millennium 
highway, which connects Dakar with Bamako is complete and allows very good access between 
the Loulo Mine in Mali and the Massawa Project. A well-maintained laterite road between Bembou 
and Sabodala exists and crosses the permit. Charter flights from Dakar to the Kedougou airstrip 
can be used. The Kedougou airstrip is a 1.5 km long sealed strip. It is approximately 85 km from 
site by road. Kedougou is the regional centre and accessible by off-terrain vehicles on dirt roads 
from site.  

The climate at Massawa is strongly influenced by the north and southward movement of the Inter 
Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which creates distinctive wet and dry seasons. The wet 
season extends from June to October and access to the site can be affected by poor road 
conditions. The site is in the Sahelian Transition Zone between the Sahara Desert in the north 
and the tropical climate in the south. The low altitude of the site (170 m to 240 m above mean 
sea level) and the absence of any intervening mountains mean that the humidity is directly related 
to the wind moving from the south and west.  

The local population are essentially artisanal gold miners and subsistence farmers. Bread and 
small quantities of vegetables may be sourced locally but most supplies are obtained from 
Kedougou.  

Local infrastructure is limited to small rural settlements connected by gravel roads and paths. 
Tinkoto, an artisanal mining village consisting of between 7,000 and 10,000 people, is the nearest 
village to the Project and is located 7 km SW of the southern extent of the deposit. Tinkoto has 
developed around the artisanal mining activities in the area.  

Equidistant to the north, east, and SW of the site are the Peul villages of Mandinkole and 
Kanoumering. These are both predominantly pastoral communities, rearing goats, sheep, and 
cattle. Kanoumering has an estimated population of 700 people, whilst approximately 200 people 
reside in Mandinkole. Cultivation of maize, millet, and peanuts also takes place in the vicinity of 
these villages, although agriculture is limited by poor soils and a relatively long dry season. 

Up to 240 people a day are employed from these villages in the Massawa exploration camp, 
fulfilling roles such as samplers, aides, and general laborers. In general, however, the local 
population is largely uneducated and untrained, and skilled personnel will need to be sourced 
from Kedougou and further afield within Senegal during the subsequent phases of the Project. It 
is Barrick's experience in similar type projects in West Africa that, with the provision of training, it 
is possible to employ local people in the construction and operational phases of the projects. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 41 

Process water is planned to be supplied from an on-site storage facility which will be required for 
the dry periods. No electrical power is available on the permit and it is currently supplied by on-
site diesel generating set for the exploration camp. 

The topography of the area is generally undulating with elevations ranging from 100 m above sea 
level to a maximum of 300 m above sea level. The area comprises a dense network of small 
seasonal streams between undulating hill and ridges. A detailed LIDAR topographic survey has 
been conducted for areas of the permit in which mining activity is planned to take place.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 42 

6. History  

Artisanal mining has long been one of the primary activities of the Malinke people in the region, 
and active artisanal mining areas still exist on the permit. The Massawa deposits themselves 
have never been exploited by artisanal mining, possibly due to their relatively low tenor surface 
expression. 

AngloGold Ashanti Limited (AngloGold Ashanti) previously held the Kanoumering Permit and 
conducted exploration on the permit between December 1996 and January 2000. During this 
period AngloGold Ashanti undertook a multiphase research programme involving regional 
geochemistry, detailed box media sampling and mapping, airborne survey, and multipurpose 
drilling over selected targets. Results of soil sampling indicate that 37% of the samples collected 
returned grades greater than 500 ppb Au and most of the anomalous samples were located in 
the vicinity of the Tinkoto pluton. Numerous other gold anomalies were found within tuffs and 
andesites occasionally associated with the linear trends identified by Landsat imagery. Detailed 
soil sampling was carried out over 12 identified targets, of which four were selected for more 
focussed work where detailed soil sampling revealed some encouraging gold in soil anomalies 
over areas KA, KB, KC, and KD. These areas were followed up with rotary air blast (RAB) and 
diamond drilling. A total of 21 diamond drill (DD) holes for 3,451 m were drilled, which included 
10.9 m at 1.96 g.t Au from 0 m in KB99004D, 18 m at 1.23 g/t Au from 56 m in KA98001D, and 
51.4 m at 0.7 g/t Au from 40 m in KA98003D. 

Randgold conducted a regional and detailed soil survey on the Kounemba Permit which was 
completed in 2004. The area of the Central Zone and North Zone open pits was initially a 
greenfields discovery by Randgold targeting a 3.5 km long gold in soil anomaly at over 20 ppb 
on the Kounemba Permit. In 2006, the first trench, MWTR001, returned an encouraging result of 
10.9 m at 2.03 g/t Au, and subsequent positive results from RAB drilling were followed up with a 
number of phases of diamond drilling. This resulted in work up to 2012 confirming 4.5 km of 
continuous mineralisation at Massawa. The 4.5 km crosses the boundary between the 
Kounemba and Kanoumering Permits, and is the reason that, in 2010, the two permits were 
merged to form the new Kanoumba Permit. 

In 2015, a revised scope of metallurgical testwork was designed to target refractory ore types, 
which in turn, resulted in challengingly high power and processing costs.  

A strategy was implemented to target non-refractory ore types on satellite deposits on the 
property. The Sofia Main pit was subsequently converted to reserve in 2016 and the Sofia North 
pit, in 2017. The Delya pit, which contains refractory sulphides, was converted to reserve in 2017.  

Following the addition of these reserves to the proposed mine schedule, in 2017 and 2018 a 
metallurgical plant was designed and costed along with a tailings facility and mine site 
infrastructure for the FS. 

There have been no historic resource or reserve estimates and there has been no historic 
production from the Massawa deposits.

7. Geological Setting and Mineralisation 

7.1. Regional Geology  

The West African Craton can be divided into three main regions exposed beneath Phanerozoic 
cover. In the north, the Reguibat Rise extends over Mauritania and western Algeria and consists 
of an Archaean terrain in the west and Paleoproterozoic (Birimian) terrain in the east. The 
southern Leo Rise covers a large area over southern Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger, 
Ghana, and Guinea; and is separated from the Reguibat Rise by the Late Proterozoic to 
Phanerozoic sedimentary Taoudeni Basin. The western Archaean portion, known as the Man 
Shield, is separated from the eastern Birimian Supergroup of the Baoule Mossi domain by the 
Sassandra fault. Two Birimian inliers, the Kayes and Kedougou-Kenieba, suggest the continuity 
of the Proterozoic basement underneath the Taoudeni intra-cratonic basin. The Massawa Project 
is located within the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier (KKI) (Figure 7-1). 

 

Figure 7-1 Location of the Kedougou-Kenieba-Inlier in the West African Craton 

Key: 1- Limits of West African Craton; 2+3- Taoudeni Basin; 4- Pan-African Belts; 5- Archean (stripes) and Birimian terranes (Gueye 
et al., 2008 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 44 

Volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Birimian Supergroup form a substantial portion of the West 
African Craton. These rocks and associated intrusive units of the Eburnean tectonic-thermal 
event represent a major Paleoproterozoic juvenile crust forming event that took place during the 
time interval of 2.25 Ga to 2.09 Ga (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher et al., 1992). The Birimian 
crust formed from large ocean closure (Leahy et al., 2005) between two Archaean cratons, 
involving the progressive accretion of island arcs and oceanic plateaus to a growing continental 
mass (Feybesse et al., 2006). Subsequent thickening associated with the intrusion of kinetically 
late granitoids and compressional deformation facilitated the formation of structurally controlled 
orogenic gold deposits. 

7.2. Local Geology  

The KKI is divided into the Mako volcanic series to the west, and an overlying Dialé–Daléma 
sedimentary basin to the east (Dia et al., 1997) (Figure 7-2). The Massawa and Sofia deposits 
are located along the 150 km long Mako Belt. The Mako Belt consists of greenstones and 
sedimentary rocks, dated between 2160 Ma and 2200 Ma, which were intruded by ultramafic to 
felsic plutons yielding ages of 2070 Ma to 2210 Ma (Dia et al., 1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; 
Gueye et al., 2007). All rock types, excluding post-Birimian dykes, were metamorphosed to a 
lower greenschist facies during the Eburnean orogeny. The belt basin margin between the Mako 
and Dialé–Daléma series is structurally controlled and marked by the regional-scale, NE trending, 
Main Transcurrent Shear Zone (MTZ) (Ledru et al., 1991; Treloar et al., 2014) which hosts 
Massawa. A second major first order structure is located further to the west, within the Mako Belt, 
and is referred to as the Sabodala Shear Zone. This structure hosts the Sofia deposit and 
Teranga Gold Corporation's (Teranga) Sabodola deposits, located to the north.  

7.3. The Mako Volcanic Belt  

The Mako Belt consists of folded metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic rocks intruded by various 
generations of granitic and mafic rocks (Figure 7-3). The belt is characterised by NE trending 
corridors, or domains, whose shape is, at least in part, controlled by a network of anastomosing 
north to NE trending lineaments, shear zones, and plutonic belts that form the Badon-Kakadian 
batholith (Gueye et al., 2008; Diene et al., 2012). Massive basaltic and andesitic flows outcrop in 
the southern parts of the belt where they overlie pillowed basalts (Diallo, 1994). The flows are 
inter-bedded with volcanic agglomerates, breccias, and banded tuffs. The mafic Mako volcanic 
rocks are tholeiitic in character (Abouchami et al., 1990; Dia et al., 1997). The pillowed basalts 
have a normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) affinities, whereas the massive basalts have 
an enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt composition (E-NORB) (Ngom, 1995).  

The Mako metavolcanic rocks are intruded by the Badon-Kakadian batholith to the west and 
north; and to the east by small, tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) plutons. The Badon-
Kakadian batholith represents a multi-phase suite of deformed ultramafic to dominantly felsic 
(metaluminous) intrusions (Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2008). The Sonfara-Sandikounda 
intrusive rocks (the Sandikounda Layered Complex and the Sandikounda Amphibolite-Gneissic 
Complex) are dated between 2,158 ± 8 Ma and 2,205 ± 15 Ma (U/Pb and Pb/Pb zircon methods; 
Dia et al., 1997; Gueye et al., 2007). The Lamina Kaoura Plutonic Complex (granites, tonalites, 
and rare mafic lithologies), east of Sandikounda, is dated by Dia et al. (1997) at 2,138 ± 6 Ma 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 45 

(zircon Pb evaporation age). The Badon granodiorite, in the southern parts of the batholith, 
yielded Pb/Pb zircon ages of 2,198 ± 2 Ma to 2,213 ± 3 Ma (Gueye et al., 2007). Calc-alkaline 
felsic stocks on the eastern side of the belt, such as the Tinkoto and the Mamakono plutons, are 
younger than rocks of the Badon-Kakadian batholith, yielding Pb/Pb ages of 2,080 Ma to 
2,090 Ma (Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Gueye et al., 2007). 

The Mako granitoids, along with the volcanic packages, are interpreted to have island arc 
affinities on the basis of their geochemical and petrological characteristics (Dia, 1988; Dia et al., 
1997; Diallo, 1994; Pawlig et al., 2006).

7.3.1. The Dialé-Daléma Sedimentary Basin  

The neighbouring Dialé-Daléma basin is composed of a sequence of sandstones, siltstones, and 
carbonates, inter-bedded with calc-alkaline ash- and lapilli-tuffs (Bassot, 1987; Hirdes and Davis, 
2002). All sedimentary rocks are isoclinally folded, with upright or slightly overturned folds to the 
SE. The Dialé-Daléma series is generally considered to be younger than the Mako series (Bassot, 
1987; Dia, 1988; Abouchami et al., 1990). Siliciclastic rocks show detrital zircon ages ranging 
between 2096 ± 8 Ma and 2165 ± 1 Ma (Milési et al., 1989; Hirdes and Davis, 2002). The 
sedimentary basin is centrally intruded by the Saraya quartz monzonite granite (Pons et al., 
1992), which yielded a U/Pb zircon age of 2079 ± 2 Ma (Hirdes and Davis, 2002), and the plutons 
of Balangouma and Boboti further to the east (Ndiaye et al., 1997). 

7.4. Massawa Deposit Geology 

7.4.1. Regolith 

Gold mineralisation is rarely exposed at surface, with the majority of the Massawa deposit being 
covered from the south to north by three laterite levels Cp3 (Lower), Cp2 (Middle), and Cp1 
(Upper). Cp3 is believed to be transported off Cp2 and is clearly multi-layered and over 7 m thick 
in trench exposures. Percussion RAB drilling has identified Cp2 and Cp1 to be five to seven 
vertical metres thick. Gossanous shears and quartz stockworks hosted by volcaniclastics and 
sedimentary rocks are rarely exposed in Cp1. The relatively thick transported laterites can explain 
the low gold in soil response encountered over the deposit.  

7.4.2. Lithology 

The Massawa stratigraphy is dominated by a western package of volcaniclastic rocks and an 
eastern package of greywackes, with bedding striking at 210° ± 10° and dipping steeply (75° to 
80°) toward the west. This dominantly clastic sequence is intruded by several igneous rocks 
including sills of gabbro, felsic intrusions, and feldspar (and/or quartz-feldspar) porphyries. Core 
photographs of the main lithologies are shown in Figure 7-4.  

Volcaniclastic rocks: The volcaniclastic rocks have a bimodal mineralogy with both mafic and 
felsic variants. They consist of a package of agglomerates, lapilli tuffs, tuffs, ash-tuffs, and fine-
grained carbonaceous ash-tuffs and include both purple and green variants. The purple 
colouration probably indicates deposition in an arid to semi-arid terrestrial environment. 
Laminated, fine-grained, volcaniclastic material is often green and could represent ash fall into 
standing water. The coarser volcaniclastic rocks are matrix supported and include elongated and 
sub-rounded felsic lithic clasts (up to 5 cm in size) with glassy textures and rounded mafic clasts 
(up to 10 cm in size).

A- Volcaniclastic; B- Greywacke; C- Carbonaceous schist; D- Gabbro; E- Quartz-feldspar porphyry 

Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks: Felsic and lithic wackes, which underlie the volcaniclastic rocks 
to the east, are composed of fine-grained layers at the top of the sequence with coarser units at 
the base. Graded bedding is common within these rocks and shows a downward younging 
direction implying that the steeply west dipping volcano-sedimentary package is overturned, with 
the volcaniclastic rocks being older than the greywackes. 

At its northern end, the Massawa deposit is bounded by two prominent carbonaceous shale 
layers which act as the hanging wall and footwall of the mineralisation. The carbonaceous shale 
is very fine grained, well laminated, and is inter-bedded with the coarser-grained greywackes. 
Layers are variable in thickness, on a millimetre scale, and form discontinuous lenses. Graphitic 
bands are common where the rock is more deformed and these units are referred to as graphitic

23rd July 2019  Page 50 

schists. The greywacke and shale package displays soft sediment deformation fabrics typical of 
turbidite systems including load casts, slump and flame structures, and intra-sedimentary faults. 

Intrusive rocks: Two main concordant gabbroic bodies are present at Massawa. The sills are 
up to 30 m in thickness; although towards the north they occur as narrow bands ranging from 
0.5 m to 18 m in thickness. The gabbros predate shearing and host gold when intersected by the 
mineralised structures. Outside of the mineralised system, gabbro sills are massive and coarse 
grained.  

Quartz porphyry and fine-grained felsic sills, forming sheets 2 m to 60 m thick, occur throughout 
the deposit but are generally thicker and more abundant in the southern portion of the deposit. 
The porphyries are intrusive into the volcano-sedimentary sequence and show contacts against 
greywacke, volcaniclastic rock, and carbonaceous shale. The quartz-feldspar porphyry has a 
tonalitic mineralogy, comprising phenocrysts of oligoclase/andesine (altered to sericite) and 
quartz (50:50 ratio), and a groundmass composed of fine-grained plagioclase, albite, and small 
amounts of quartz. The earliest sills display a weak foliation and weak to strong alteration. 
Younger intrusive units are unaltered, undeformed and cross-cut the sheared rocks, and thus the 
emplacement of the porphyries spans the shearing event.  

Late stage (post-mineralisation) mafic dykes (less than 15 m thick) crop out in the southern part 
of the mineralised body, where they intrude both the volcaniclastic rocks and the greywackes. 

7.4.3. Structure 

Massawa lies on a NE trending (030⁰ to 035°) sinistral structure, likely a second order splay off 
the neighbouring MTZ. To the south and north of Massawa, the NE trending shears are dextrally 
offset by discordant north-south structures, resulting in dilation and mineralisation. The 
mineralisation is associated with anastomosing brittle-ductile shearing commonly localised at 
intrusive contacts. 

7.4.4. Mineralisation 

The Massawa deposit occurs over a strike length of 4.5 km and is divided into two zones (Central 
Zone and Northern Zone) that differ in terms of host rock geology, mineralogy, structural controls, 
and metallurgy. The Central and Northern zones are separated by a 0.3 km gap zone, where less 
intense deformation is observed. Both mineralised zones are discussed separately below. 

7.5. Massawa Central Zone  

Mineralisation in the Central Zone (CZ) is hosted by an anastomosing brittle-ductile shear network 
localised by pre-existing gabbro and felsic porphyry intrusive contacts. The CZ is divided into four 
blocks based on metallurgy (Block 1 to Block 4) generally becoming more refractory to the north, 
associated with higher arsenopyrite content and a change in host lithology from volcaniclastics 
to sediments (greywacke) (Figure 7-5, Figure 7-6, and Figure 7-7).

There is a deposit scale correlation between increasing brittle-ductile strain and increasing gold 
grade, with the grade of mineralisation variable along strike and down-dip related to the variable 
strain associated with the structural framework. The continuity of mineralisation is localised along 
gabbro and felsic porphyry intrusive contacts (Figure 7-8) with high-grade mineralisation 
associated with high strain and arsenopyrite (Figure 7-9). 

Numerous vein opening directions and vein styles highlight high fluid overpressure, with 
differential stress trending toward zero. Previously, a genetic link between quartz-stibnite veins 
and high-grade mineralisation was made leading to a 'Phase 1 and Phase 2' nomenclature. 
Subsequent review with additional drilling has advanced the understanding of the geological 
setting and mineralisation style, with quartz-stibnite veins observed parallel to and cross-cut by 
brittle-ductile shearing related to mineralisation. Subsequent analysis highlighted no significant 
statistical correlation between gold grade and stibnite content, with a good correlation noted with 
arsenopyrite. The grade and continuity to mineralisation is now characterised by alteration style, 
deformation intensity, and intrusive contacts.  

Low-grade (+1 g/t Au) mineralisation is associated with weak to moderate shearing with silica-
carbonate alteration and disseminated sulphides with weak strain. Arsenopyrite is rare. High-
grade (+3 g/t Au) mineralisation is associated with high strain including brecciation, extensional 
and shear veins, with moderate to strong silica-carbonate alteration and sulphides. Arsenopyrite 
is the dominant sulphide associated with gold, with arsenopyrite and pyrite also observed as vein 
selvedges +/- visible gold.  

Veins identified by trenching and diamond drilling vary in style and include extensional, sheared, 
and boudinage veins. Veining associated with +1 g/t Au mineralisation is sub-parallel in 
orientation to primary strain (shearing) highlighting the genetic link between deformation and 
mineralisation.

7.6. Massawa Northern Zone 

The Northern Zone (NZ) has a strike length of 2.5 km and consists of a main NNE trending 
mineralised structure with discontinuous footwall (FW) and hanging wall (HW) lodes (Figure 7-10 
and Figure 7-11). Mineralisation is localised in a damage zone adjacent to highly strained bands 
of fine- to medium-grained felsic and lithic wacke, wacke with subordinate carbonaceous shales, 
and gabbros. The NZ is sub-divided into two further zones based on structure (Northern Zone 1 
and Northern Zone 2).  

The southern 1.1 km of the Northern Zone (NZ1) hosts discontinuous, weaker gold mineralisation 
(average grade of 1 g/t Au to 1.5 g/t Au). The weakly silicified, brittle-ductile, mineralised shear is 
less than 10 m in thickness and is sub-vertical to steeply dipping to the ESE. The higher-grade 
but narrow mineralisation is focussed at the margins of a medium-grained greywacke and 
lithological contacts with contrasting grain size. Northern Zone 2 (NZ2) represents the northern 
and highest grade (>4 g/t Au) portion of the deposit. Mineralisation is predominately confined to 
a single, continuous, narrow zone (10 m to 15 m average width), which is sub-vertical to steeply 
dipping (>70°) to the WNW. The mineralisation is bounded by two prominent carbonaceous shale 
horizons within the sedimentary sequence.

Mineralisation in the NZ is characterised by disseminated arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite. No 
quartz-stibnite visible Au veins are seen in the northern parts of the deposit. High grade is 
associated with crack seal carbonate veining where arsenopyrite intensifies at the margins. Early 
silicification is less significant in the NZ, where the alteration is mainly composed of sericite, 
carbonate, and chlorite alteration affecting both sedimentary rocks and the gabbro unit. Primary 
and tectonic rock fabrics are often still clearly visible. 

Two mineralised domains are modelled in the NZ: 

• A higher-grade domain (average 5 g/t Au) consists of 7% to 10% disseminated sulphides 
(arsenopyrite>pyrite) associated with ductile shearing with extensional quartz-carbonate 
veins. 

• A lower-grade domain (average 1.5 g/t Au) consists of 1% to 3% disseminated sulphides 
(pyrite>arsenopyrite) associated with brecciation and extensional quartz-carbonate veins.  

Compared to the CZ, higher total sulphide contents (averaging 3% to 5%); higher average 
arsenopyrite-pyrite ratios (0.5-1); and higher As levels are recorded. Gold is largely refractory to 
direct cyanide leaching developed within the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite and, to a lesser extent, 
arsenian pyrite. 

7.7. Sofia Deposit Geology  

7.7.1. Regolith 

A 3.4 km 120 ppb Au (97th percentile) soil anomaly delineates the mineralisation at Sofia. The 
anomaly, confirmed by trenching and drilling, identified the Sofia Main deposit which strikes NE 
and Sofia North with mineralisation striking north-south. Sofia Main is partially located on the 
upper limits of a more than 800 m wide, transported lateritic hardpan of CP2/3 (Lower) that has 
formed an apron believed to be transported off a steep sloped, topographic high west of the 
mineralisation. At Sofia North, RAB and reverse circulation (RC) drilling confirmed a thick laterite 
cover (>5 m) that extends for over one kilometre where it is overlain by alluvial and colluvium 
sediments into a major east to west trending river. This thick consolidated transported material 
may explain the low Au response of the soils along this area of the Sofia-Sabodala structure. 

7.7.2. Lithology 

Western Mafics: The NE trending Sofia–Sabodala structure defines a major terrane boundary 
that separates a continuous unit of predominantly mafic-ultramafic rocks (dunite, gabbro, basalts, 
and dacitic lavas) to the west, and andesitic lavas and tuffs to the east. The country rocks are 
intruded by gabbros, diorites, and narrow quartz-feldspar porphyries (QFP). The diorites are 
spatially related to the mineralisation and commonly altered to silica-albite. The QFP has a 
tonalitic mineralogy comprising of distinctive rounded quartz and plagioclase. 

Footwall Mafics and Volcaniclastics: The FW geology consists of a package of chlorite altered 
equigranular gabbro with subordinate basaltic-andesite lavas and tuffs. The gabbro package is 
up to 60 m thick thinning toward the north-east ranging from 10 m to 20 m in thickness. The 
gabbro predates shearing and hosts gold when intersected by the mineralised structures. Here it 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 60 

is commonly altered and strained with strong silica-albite-chlorite-sericite on the western margin 
of the package. Underlying the gabbro are lithic-wacke, lapilli and ash tuffs, and occasional 
carbonaceous shales and siltstones. All intrusive rocks have a weak foliation and weak to strong 
alteration with strain developed at the lithological contacts. Late dolerite dykes cross-cut all units 
described above and post-date mineralisation. Core photographs of the main lithologies are 
shown in Figure 7-12, Figure 7-13, and Figure 7-14.

7.7.3. Structure 

Sofia lies on a NE trending (015° to 040°) structure which is likely a second or third order splay 
off the main Sofia-Sabodala Shear (Figure 7-15). At Sofia Main, the structures are modelled to 
be inter-connecting listric (20° to 80°) thrusts with zones of high strain and alteration developed 
in the FW. To the north of Sofia Main, the system turns to the NNE with the steep west dipping 
mineralisation developed at the eastern contact of the Western Mafics.

7.7.4. Mineralisation 

Sofia is located approximately 10 km to the west of Massawa, along the more than 30 km long 
010° Sofia-Sabodala Shear Zone which hosts the Sabodala gold deposit 27 km to the north. Gold 
mineralisation has been delineated over a four-kilometre strike length and is controlled by both 
the host lithology and geometry of strong brittle-ductile structures. The mineralised shear has 
been differentiated into two zones based on different structural trends along the tectono-
stratigraphic boundary. At Sofia Main, brittle-ductile structures strike 040°, whereas at Sofia North 
mineralized structures strike 010° (Sofia North). 

7.7.5. Sofia Main 

Mineralisation at Sofia Main has a strike length of 1.4 km and was developed within a 
compressive system where changes in HW geometry from sub-vertical to steep/moderate west 
dipping has a structural control on the mineralisation. Hydrothermal mineralisation is localised in 
areas of relatively low fluid pressure associated with fault jogs. Prospective zones of localised 
extension can also be created within thrust zones at bends in the HW ramp (low/moderate to a 
high angle) (ii) and/or intersections with lower angle inter-shear thrusts and splays (Figure 7-16). 

In the HW adjacent to the mineralised zone, strained tuffs and a re-crystallised and highly altered 
and magnetised rock of ultra-basic origin are spatially associated to the high-grade 
mineralisation. This dyke or 'Fe-stone' is continuous along strike and is parallel to the 'hanging 
wall shear'. At surface, the 'Fe-stone' is a distinctively highly weathered, iron oxidised, and 
silicified rock that retains its magnetic qualities. The eastern contact of these zones can be 
characterised by proto-mylonitic textures with intense silica-sericite alteration. Within these 
zones, isolated brittle structures develop, fragmenting the rock. These are characterised by high 
sericite-chlorite content and associated silica-carbonate veins that can often be traced down dip. 
These brittle-ductile structures are distinctly developed at the HW contact of the mineralised zone 
where the strain is orientated sub-parallel to the core axis with intrafolial folds prominent with 
increased brecciation associated at the contact with the higher-grade zones. This brecciation and 
associated alteration represents a likely fluid pressure boundary (Figure 7-17) where the 
maximum relative pressure difference (high pressure vs low pressure) is directly related to the 
tenor of gold (extension).

Figure 7-16 3D Schematic of Sofia Main: To the SW of Sofia Main 

The mineralisation is thought to be structurally controlled where an apparent more tabular geometry comes to the surface (over 2 g/t Au mineralisation), that is controlled by a series of splays that are 
modelled to terminate on the FW structure, where the geometry at depth is the same along strike. Mineralisation is observed to increase at the junctions of these structures. Moving further to the NE, the 
FW splays close with the mineralisation and shears become tighter and more acute. Here a high tenor of gold is thought to be controlled by the dilatational/extensional HW geometry.

Main Zone (MZ) 

Mineralisation in the MZ is predominantly hosted in a quartz-diorite intrusive that has been 
strongly altered by albite-silica and overprinted by late silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite 
mineralisation. The silica-carbonate bleaching is distinct and can pervasively alter the dark 
magnetite rich 'Fe–stones' directly implicated at the HW of the high-grade mineralisation. High 
grade is generally developed within stockworks and brecciated zones in the quartz diorite host, 
with the ductile strained zones characterised by high sericite content with lower Au content. The 
albite-silica phase of alteration is thought to act as a ridged body between the bounding structures 
under high strain with slip along the shear facilitated by a high fluid pressure model causing 
brecciation. Albite-silica sericite alteration developed in the HW (Sofia structure 2/SF2) and FW 
zones (Sofia Structure 1/SF1) can display progressively high strain with sulphides up to 5%, 
however, they do not display the high gold grades associated with the MZ and are generally 
below 1 g/t Au. 

The steeply west dipping (65° to 80°) immediate FW geology is commonly composed of a NE 
(035° to 045°) strike continuous mafic sequence (gabbro with subordinate basalts and tuffs) that 
is sub-parallel to the main mineralized lode. Discontinuous zones of high-grade mineralisation 
are commonly hosted in silica albite chlorite veins where the strain transfers and continues into 
the FW of the system. 

The mineralogy is dominated by pyrite with trace Cu-sulphides. Gold is predominately free milling, 
associated with pyrite and silicate gangue. Gold grain compositions consist on average of 93% 
Au with 7% Ag.  

Footwall Zone (FWZ) 

In the south of the Sofia Main, a lode of high grade (above 3 g/t Au) mineralisation is developed 
in the FW gabbro, immediately east of the bounding FW shear of the MZ. Over 300 m in strike, 
the mineralisation is modelled to be related to lower angle splays off the steeper FW shear. From 
the south, the splays open out to the east with a higher tenor of gold where the structures close 
at the angle of the FW shear down dip. Along strike to the north, these secondary structures 
begin to merge with the FW shear, again increasing the tenor of gold. This suggests that there is 
strong structural control on the mineralisation in the south, with strain and grade increasing at 
structural intersection. 

Two styles of mineralisation are evident: 

• Silica-albite-chlorite-pyrite alteration commonly forms at the sheared western margin of 
the FW gabbro. The silica-albite alteration is less intense than the MZ, whereas chlorite 
is more abundant. The alteration typically displays a banded appearance and is not 
completely textually destructive.  

• Silica-carbonate ± albite veining. It is characterised by typically weakly foliated rocks with 
high-grade intercepts associated with localized higher strain zones. The wallrocks appear 
to display chlorite-magnetite alteration typically developed within fine-grained contact of 
the gabbro. This mineralisation style tends to occur at the intersection between the FW 
shear and the secondary lower angle splay. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 67 

The structural model prescribes the fault linkage and shear geometry in the HW as the likely 
primary structural control of the mineralisation. This suggests that the mineralisation can develop 
where these high strain jogs occur with relative low fluid pressures (extension) facilitating fluid 
influx and slip along the shear associated with brittle deformation. In addition, the interaction of 
the intra-shear faults in the HW are likely implicated. Fluid interactions with rock within the FW 
gabbro and the 'Fe-stone' may localise mineralisation at the contact. The lithological variations 
also may have a rheological control.  

7.7.6. Sofia North Deposit 

Sofia North has a strike length of 2.3 km and consists of one main NNE trending mineralized 
structure and a discontinuous FW lode. Mineralisation is mainly hosted in moderately altered 
quartz diorites, andesitic ash tuffs, and gabbros (western mafics). The northern zone is sub-
divided in two mineralisation styles based on structure (strain/alteration) and vein hosted styles 
(intensity). The main mineralised structure that controls the strain and alteration is developed at 
the major eastern contact of the Western Mafics that turns in strike from 040⁰ to 010⁰ and has 
been delineated over more than 2 km by 200 m spaced trenching and RC drilling. The structure 
is strike continuous from Sofia Main. The structure is steep to west dipping and planar with the 
western mafic stratigraphy. 

At Sofia North, the diorite is comparatively narrower compared to Sofia Main with elevated grades 
above the redox boundary suggesting a supergene influence. A second, high-grade (>5 g/t Au) 
but narrow mineralised zone is hosted in silica carbonate veins commonly developed within the 
HW stratigraphy lithological contacts (gabbros/lavas), suggesting that the strain has transferred 
from the FW (Sofia Main) to the HW. 

The mineralisation is defined by a strong occurrence of fine disseminated pyrite (1%) 
accompanied by strong quartz, albite, and carbonate alteration. Mineralisation occurs in quartz-
albite altered intermediate intrusives as at Sofia Main, with quartz ± magnetite ± chlorite. Vein 
hosted mineralisation in the mafic host is spatially associated with chlorite-rich shears with silica 
carbonate veining.  

7.8. Delya Deposit 

7.8.1. Regolith 

Delya is located along the MTZ, approximately 10 km north of Massawa. Detailed soil sampling 
along with detailed mapping and litho-sampling across successive exploration campaigns defined 
a linear 6 km, 100 m wide, 030° trending greater than 100 ppb Au anomaly confirmed by 
subsequent trenching and drilling. The dominant regolith comprises Cuirasse Plateaus (ferricrete, 
Fp2)) and Erosional Outcrops (Es) orientated broadly NE sub-parallel to topography and the trend 
of the MTZ.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 68 

7.8.2. Lithology  

The lithological sequence is composed of massive and foliated andesite to the west, and an 
eastern sedimentary package consisting of shales, carbonaceous shales, lithic, and feldspar-
wacke. These units are intruded by a wide gabbro unit. These lithologies have undergone strong 
ductile deformation, with structures trending NE (030° to 040°) and steeply dipping to the east. 
The main Delya mineralised structure is located at the contact between the gabbro and the 
sedimentary package and is bounded by two carbonaceous shale units.  

The dominant lithologies at Delya are shown in Figure 7-18.

Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 69 

7.8.3. Structure  

Three parallel zones of mineralisation have been defined at Delya, over a one-kilometre strike 
length. The main zone of mineralisation is hosted at the lower margin of the gabbro within highly 
sheared, silicified and sericitised schist. The mineralized zone varies in thickness from 3 m to 
10 m (average of 5 m), contains higher grades (up to 5 g/t Au), and dips to the east at 85°. The 
other branches are located to the west and have an average dip of 84° to the west. Mineralisation 
has been drill tested to a vertical depth of 150 m below the surface.  

7.8.4. Mineralisation  

The mineralisation and alteration assemblage consists of sericite-silica-carbonate and chlorite 
alteration, associated with strong disseminated fine arsenopyrite and pyrite (Figure 7-19). 
Arsenopyrite is dominant over pyrite (similar ratios to the Massawa NZ). Gold is largely refractory 
in nature and locked up in the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite.

7.9.1. Tina Deposit 

The Tina deposit is located along the Bakan Corridor that groups together a number of anomalous 
gold in soil and rock anomalies (Tiwana, Tizia, Tina, Bakan, and Khosa). Mineralisation along 
this corridor is controlled by the over 10 km long Kossanto Shear. This belt parallel structure is 
reactivated at Tina by a north-south belt discordant dextral fault that runs from Teranga Gold 
Corporation's Goulouma targets to the north down to Massawa in the south. The Tina deposit is 
defined by a 1,500 m long and up to 20 ppb Au NE trending soil anomaly. 

The geology of the Tina region comprises of a NE sequence of felsic and intermediate volcanic 
rocks (andesite, dacites, and rhyodacites), tuff, cherts, and felsic intrusive suites ranging from 
diorite to monzonites. Field structural studies show a dominant NE foliation, discrete NS foliation, 
and three mains directions of quartz vein: NE, NS, and ESE. 

Disseminated pyrite-Au mineralisation has so far been intersected in drill core over a 700 m strike 
length, with an average width of 15 m and remains open in all directions and at depth. Two 
mineralized branches have been identified in strongly sheared and altered (silica, sericite, and 
K-feldspar) felsic intrusive and gossanous tuffs:  

• A main western branch, which is steeply dipping, occurs on several sub-parallel sets 
(although two are more continuous), and is hosted by a felsic intrusion.  

• An eastern lower grade mineralised branch, which also forms several narrow sets, dips 
75° to the west, and is related to shear tuffs and gossanous rocks.  

Recent interpretation indicated a potential upside towards the south (still open in all directions) 
and within the tuffs, outside the felsic intrusive. The structure continuity coincides in the field with 
gossanous rocks and a strong soil anomaly over at least one kilometre along strike that remains 
largely untested.  

7.9.2. Bambaraya Deposit 

Bambaraya is located in the NW corner of the Kounemba Permit along the Sabodala Shear 
Corridor, approximately 18 km to the north of Sofia. The NE trending (approximately 032°) shear 
zone marks the brecciated contact between pillowed basalts and massive and foliated andesites. 
These volcanic rocks have been intruded by gabbro, dolerite, and felsic plutonic rocks near the 
deposit.  

The deposit is distinguished by a 50 m to 150 m wide, 2.2 km long gold in soil anomaly (50 ppb 
Au). To date, bedrock mineralisation has been intersected over 900 m. Bambaraya is 
characterised by Loulo-style mineralisation, with gold linked to quartz-tourmaline veins. These 
veins run oblique (010º) to the main shear geometry. An updated geological and structural model 
distinguishes two mineralised bands: a thicker western branch with more consistent grades, 
which dip steeply to the west (approximately 70°); and an eastern branch which moderately dips 
to the east (approximately 60°). The eastern mineralisation is in a potential dilatational zone 
where NE structures were dextrally reactivated by two north-south structures. Within this corridor, 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 72 

the mineralisation is east dipping, whereas it dips towards the west outside the reactivated 
corridor.  

Additional detailed geological mapping along the Bambaraya corridor has proved the continuity 
of the quartz-tourmaline veins towards the south. Subsequently, this work highlighted potential 
upsides on both the eastern and western branches. A strike length of 300 m remains untested 
along the western branch, whereas the updated geological model suggests a possible southern 
extension of the eastern branch over at least 450 m. 

The mineralisation assemblages are dominated by pyrite, with gold mineralisation located within 
the quartz-tourmaline veins (visible gold) and/or in the alterations selvages around these veins. 
Alteration consists of silica-tourmaline-iron carbonate-sericite. 

7.10. Advanced Targets 

7.10.1. KB Target 

The KB target is located 5 km from Massawa CZ along ENE trending mineralisation located 
between the NE Sofia-Sabodala and MTZ structures proximal to the Tinkoto granite. Dominant 
lithologies include gabbro, diorite and mafic volcanics with sedimentary component increasing 
toward the north. 

Mineralisation at KB comprises of multiple ENE/EW mineralised trends coincident with 
+1,175 ppb soil anomalism proximal to intrusives. The mineralisation assemblage is highlighted 
by the presence of quartz-carbonate veining with fine-disseminated pyrite and strong carbonate 
alteration. Variation in the style of alteration and mineralisation is observed including stockwork, 
brecciated and semi-massive veining interpreted to highlight proximity to fluid source.  

Additional drilling is currently in progress to define the exploration upside of the multiple targets 
at KB and to test for additional targets.  

 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 73 

8. Deposit Types 

Mineralogical, structural, and geochemical evidence collected at Massawa suggests that the 
mineralised body represents an epizonal-style orogenic gold deposit (c.f. Groves et al., 1998). 
Fluid inclusion and stable isotope analyses (Treloar et al., 2014) indicate mineralizing pressure 
and temperature conditions of 220°C to 315°C at 1 kbar to 1.65 kbar, at crustal depths of 3.5 km 
to 6.5 km, with gold mineralisation directly linked to the intrusion of the felsic porphyries. Massawa 
shares some features with shallow level orogenic Au-Sb deposits in the Murchison Greenstone 
Belt of South Africa (Ashley et al., 2000; Jaguin et al., 2012) and Au-Sb mineralization associated 
with the Himalayan orogen in Tibet (Zhai et al., 2014).  

In contrast, orogenic gold mineralisation at Sofia appears to have developed at deeper crustal 
levels, however, to date no detailed research has been carried out on the mineralised body.

9. Exploration 

9.1. Massawa Central and North Zone 

Massawa was first identified in early 2004 after completion of the Kounemba Permit regional soil 
survey. The ground was selected based on a mineralised structure that was interpreted from 
Landsat imagery to extend south from the Sabodala gold deposit and Niamia Permit in the north, 
where thick sequences of deformed volcaniclastics including andesitic lithic tuff were found. The 
regional soil sampling programme at 1,000 m by 100 m spacing took place between late 2003 
and early 2004. A total of eleven targets were identified, among which seven were ranked as a 
priority for detailed work. 

Due to the low tenor of the Massawa anomaly, it was originally selected as a secondary target. 
A detailed soil grid at Massawa was completed in mid-2005 which identified a 3.5 km long, 100 m 
to 400 m wide gold in soil anomaly at greater than 50 ppb Au. Subsequent soil sampling in 2008 
extended the anomaly to the south and north by a further 3.4 km for a total strike of 6.2 km. 

The first trench was positioned over the anomaly in November 2006. MWTR001 was located on 
the SW part of the soil anomaly and returned an encouraging result of 10.9 m at 2.03 g/t Au which 
was followed up by exploratory RAB drilling. Positive results from the RAB holes resulted in a 
series of DD phases.  

The southern portion of the Massawa target is within the original Kanoumering Permit, which was 
taken over from AngloGold Ashanti in 2002. This area had been subject to a considerable amount 
of exploration work involving reconnaissance and detailed soil sampling and mapping, airborne 
survey and drilling over selected targets, but no drilling over the Massawa anomaly. Table 9-1 
summarises the work completed by Randgold to date by exploration campaign.

The main exploration objective at Massawa is to increase Ore Reserves to greater than 3 Moz of 
gold. For this purpose, the potential exploration discovery and definition of an additional 600 koz 
of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are required. 

For 2019, the priority exploration target areas are KB, Samina (Delya strike extensions), Tina, 
and Tiwana South (Bakan Corridor). Each of these target areas are associated with anomalous 
soils and litho-samples and, apart from Samina, are located on transfer and/or second-order 
ENE, NE, and NNW structures. RC and Air Core drilling in combination with trenching and 
additional fieldwork is planned for 2019 to further define potential at these priority target areas.

10. Drilling 

10.1. Methods and Procedures 

All soil sampling, mapping, trenching, and geological supervision of drilling has been conducted 
by Randgold geologists. Table 10-1 details the DD, RC, and trenches undertaken on the property 
up until November 2018.

10.2. Survey Grids 

The Massawa Mine uses the UTM Zone 28N datum WGS84 grid for drill hole coordinates. At 
Delya, UTM Zone 29N datum WGS84 is converted into the same grid used at Massawa (UTM 
Zone 28N datum WGS84).  

10.3. Drill Planning and Site Preparation 

Drill holes are principally planned to intersect the mineralisation perpendicular to the main body 
of mineralisation. A few early drill holes were orientated to follow the main azimuth of the 
mineralisation trend to test the continuity of the mineralisation. Most of the holes are drilled on a 
50⁰ to 60⁰ dip angle to cut the steeply dipping mineralised lenses at a high angle.  

Initially, the planned collar location is marked by a surveyor using a differential global positioning 
system (DGPS). An appropriate size drill pad is cleared around the collar marker to ensure 
sufficient room for the drill rig, auxiliary vehicles, and sample collection. If the drill hole is to be 
completed using DD, then a sump is dug in one corner of the pad to collect the drilling returns. 
The sump is fenced off with a temporary barrier and security tape to help prevent accidents. Upon 
completion of the drilling, the sumps are backfilled and all efforts are made to remediate the drill 
site as far as possible whilst retaining the collar concrete pad and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe 
casing. 

10.4. Downhole Surveying 

Since 2016, all drill holes have been surveyed with Reflex EZ-GYRO multi shot system with dip 
and azimuth measurements taken every 30 m down hole during drilling and then re-surveyed 
every 10 m down hole upon completion of the drill hole. All surveying is completed by the drilling 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 82 

contractor. If there is more than 3.0⁰ change in azimuth since the previous sample, a multi shot 
EZ-GYRO survey is undertaken every six or nine metres which overlaps with at least two 'good' 
single survey measurements. 

The Reflex EZ-GYRO units on site are returned to the manufacturer for calibration on an annual 
basis. The tools are also checked once per week on the known survey tool test stand that has 
been erected within the camp (Figure 10-1). 

 

Figure 10-1 Survey Tool Test Stand at Massawa Camp 

Once the surveys have been taken, they are stored on a handheld Panasonic controller which 
connects to the Reflex Hub Management software that uploads the surveys directly to the 
Datashed database, thereby removing any potential human errors during transcription. 

Prior to 2016, drill holes were measured with Reflex EZ-TRAC or Reflex conventional GYRO and 
manually transcribed to the database. 

10.5. Collar Surveys 

Once a drill hole or surface trench is completed, and all machinery has moved away from site, 
the drill hole is surveyed using a DGPS by Randgold surveyors. The drill collar is plugged and a 
concrete collar surround is placed which is labelled with the Hole ID and date of survey. The 
sumps are then backfilled and the drill site is remediated. Trenches are surveyed with a DGPS 
starting at the collar (initial cut) and then additional point measurements are taken every 2 m. 

10.6. Diamond Drilling 

All DD has been conducted by Boart Longyear, Canada. DD is utilised at Massawa for exploration 
and resource development. PQ rods (85.0 mm diameter) and HQ rods (63.3 mm diameter) are 
used in the weathered saprolite (oxides) with NQ (47.6 mm diameter) being utilised after the 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 83 

contact with fresh consolidated rock. The quality of DD is considered to be of industry accepted 
standard with average core recoveries of 84% in the saprolite, 94% in the transition, and >96% 
in the fresh material. 

10.6.1. Diamond Drilling Procedure 

A Massawa field geologist must be on site prior to drilling commencing and ensure that the drill 
rig is lined up as per the drill plan, as well as supervising drilling, core orientation, and down hole 
surveying. Once each drilling run is complete, the drill core is removed from the drill rod and 
placed in an angle iron rack to mark up an orientation line with red chinagraph pencil or crayon 
from the data received from a Reflex ACT II Core Orientation Tool (ACT). The apex of the 
structure is marked on the core in a blue chinagraph pencil or crayon by the core technician. If 
the orientation and apex lines are overlapping, then the apex line is offset by 5 mm. 

DD core is transferred to the core trays and a plastic down hole depth marker is placed at the 
beginning and end of each core run with the depth marked on it. All areas of core loss are 
identified, and the core is marked up for core recovery. Each drill core box is marked with the 
Hole ID, top and bottom depth of the core, and the box number. The core is then transferred to 
the core yard facility by Randgold staff for logging and sampling. 

10.6.2. Diamond Core Logging 

From the commencement of the feasibility programme in 2017, all drill holes have been logged 
digitally into Maxwell LogChief software running on rugged logging tablets. Prior to this, logging 
was completed on paper logs which were transcribed into the database at a later time. The drill 
core is logged for alteration, structure, mineralisation, and geology in detail by a trained geologist 
before being photographed. All structural data including alpha and beta angles of any structures 
are also recorded at this stage.  

10.7. Reverse Circulation Drilling 

RC drilling is used at Massawa for GC spaced drilling, as well as exploration/resource 
development. All RC drilling has been conducted by Boart Longyear, Foraco, IDC, and FTE. RC 
drill holes to date have been drilled at a 5.5 in./140 mm diameter which produces approximately 
25 kg of material per one-metre sample interval. The RC drill rods are 6 m in length. 

10.7.1. Reverse Circulation Drilling Procedures 

A Massawa geologist is present during RC drilling. Prior to commencement of any drilling, cross 
sections for all planned holes are printed indicating the expected geology and mineralisation to 
be intercepted. The geologist lays out the site to ensure that, where possible, the drilling and 
sampling operations will not interfere with each other and that the sampling is not taking place 
down wind of the drilling. 

A 6 m PVC casing is used to collar the hole to help prevent drill hole collapse and sample 
contamination. Once the drill hole has been collared, the geologist ensures that the drill hole is 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 84 

cleaned to remove any material that may have ingressed during collaring before drilling is 
resumed. 

If the drill hole intersects the water table, an auxiliary booster is utilised to ensure that the samples 
are dry. After each rod change, air is blown down the hole prior to recommencing drilling to dry it 
out. If the samples are consistently wet over more than 3 m of drilling within the fresh rock and 
the driller cannot increase the air pressure any further to dry out the samples, then the drill hole 
is terminated and the samples are not analysed.  

10.7.2. Reverse Circulation Sampling and Splitting Procedure 

In soft saprolite or transition material, the cyclone splitter is removed and the entire one metre 
(approximate weight of 25 kg) sample is collected in the dropbox and inspected by the geologist 
on site to ensure that it is dry. The dropbox is cleaned at the end of each drill string. The entire 
one-metre sample within the dropbox is transferred to the splitter. 

If the sample is moist or damp, the bulk sample is weighed and recorded as a 'wet sample weight'. 
The moist or damp samples are transported to the sampling area and dried. Once dry the sample 
is re-weighed and the dry weight recorded in addition to the previously recorded wet weight.  

Prior to Q1 2018, the dry soft saprolite or transitional sample was poured evenly through the 
conventional 3:1 riffle splitter twice to obtain a minimum of 2 kg sample (up to a maximum 
acceptable sample weight of 3 kg). If the sample was underweight (below 2 kg), additional 
material is added by passing the total rejects back into the splitter until the desired sample weight 
is collected. The riffle splitter was cleaned with compressed air hose after every single use. In 
hard transitional or fresh rock drilling, the on-board cyclone and rotary splitter was used to collect 
a 2 kg sample and a reject sample in separate bags. The cyclone splitter was cleaned with a 
high-pressure air hose after every two drill rods or whenever material is observed to be sticking 
to the internal walls. If the RC samples were not entirely dry, the cyclone and rotary splitter were 
disengaged and the dropbox method used instead. 

Since Q1 2018, the samples are taken directly from the dropbox and a 12.5 kg split sample is 
produced from the initial 25 kg RC sample through the primary Gilson splitter. This 12.5 kg 
samples are then passed through the Gilson splitter again (except for CZ where a secondary 
Gilson splitter is used due to the higher nuggety nature of the mineralisation) to produce a 3 kg 
to 4 kg sample which can be submitted for analysis. If a duplicate field sample is required, this 
process is then repeated with the reject material. 

After splitting the sample, both the primary sample and rejects are weighed and recorded. A small 
amount of material is taken from the sample rejects and placed in a slotted plastic rock chip 
sample tray, which are pre-labelled with the drill hole ID and sequence numbered drill hole 
intervals in each sample slot. RC sample recovery is measured by weighing the total weight of 
sample collected over one-metre sample and comparing this to the theoretical expected weight 
for the lithological unit and weathering type. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 85 

Once the primary samples have been taken, the remaining reject sample is riffle split to create a 
3 kg sample for long term sample storage for any potential future analysis and the remainder is 
disposed of. 

The RC samples are believed to be representative of mineralisation present at Massawa and 
Sofia. The quality of RC drilling is considered to be of industry accepted standard, with average 
sample recoveries of 92% in the saprolite, 94% in the transition, and 96% in the fresh material. 

10.7.3. Reverse Circulation Logging 

All RC samples are logged on one-metre intervals as per the sample length received from the 
RC rig. Since commencement of the feasibility programme in 2017, all drill holes are logged 
digitally into LogChief software running on rugged logging tablets. Prior to this, the logging was 
completed on paper logs which were transcribed into the database at a later time. For each drill 
hole lithology, visible mineralisation, vein intensity, alteration, oxidisation, and depth of water 
table are logged as a minimum. 

10.8. Trenching 

Most the trenches were excavated perpendicular to strike of the known mineralisation, with two 
exceptions in the CZ which were cut along the mineralised zone to test the continuity of the 
proximal domain mineralisation along strike. The trenches are excavated through all pedolith 
material until at least 50 cm of insitu saprolite is exposed at the base of the trench. All trenches 
were geologically mapped in detail by a trained geologist on both walls. As part of the mapping, 
the orientation, distribution, and mineralogy of any visible veins was recorded, to better 
understand the formation of the late gold stibnite phase mineralisation. Any veins which contained 
visible sulphide phases were selectively sampled.  

The standard sampling procedure was such that a shallow cut, approximately 30 cm wide 
channel (equivalent sample mass to an RC sample) is excavated at the bottom of the northern 
face of the trench and sampled on geological and mineralisation contacts. The dimensions of the 
channel are kept constant through the entire sample length (Figure 10-2). 

The sample is split on site using a riffle splitter and a 3 kg representative sample placed in cloth 
sample bags with a sample ticket and sent to the laboratory. Additional RC mass equivalent 
channel samples were taken from both the north and south walls of the trenches to quantify the 
closely spaced grade variability. The results show that there is as much as a 40% variance in 
grade within the 1.0 m to 1.5 m along strike range. This high level of close space variability in the 
CZ is directly attributed to the occurrence of coarse gold as part of the proximal domain 
mineralisation.

23rd July 2019 Page 86

10.9. Other Sampling Methods 

RAB and Air Core drilling has previously been used at Massawa for exploration and sterilisation 
purposes, however, neither is used for resource estimation purposes.  

10.10. Sample Volume Variance Bias 

Initial investigations into potential sample volume variance were commenced during 2013 when 
a review of several twin holes showed a low to moderate level of repeatability within the Massawa 
CZ. This had not been previously identified on the Project. However, as further field duplicate 
data was obtained, the CZ assay data correlation decreased. During 2013, as specific sample 
volume and assay method variability studies were completed on each individual geological zone, 
it became apparent that the relative correlations in the CZ were much lower than within the other 
Mineral Resources. The CZ trenching and GC orientation programmes in 2016-2017 highlighted 
and confirmed the strike length continuity of the high-grade (proximal) nuggety gold systems and 
subsequent, orientation grids have consistently demonstrated the relative gold distribution 
between the broad low-grade refractory mineralisation zones and the narrow nugget high-grade 
(proximal) mineralisation zones. 

10.11. Drill Twinning Studies 

10.11.1. Massawa Central Zone  

Gold deportment studies have identified that the gold mineralisation within the Massawa CZ is 
spatially associated with low-grade disseminated sulphides and is largely present as native gold 
inclusions within pyrite and arsenopyrite, as well as lattice bound gold in disseminated 
arsenopyrite. Conversely, the native gold within high-grade zones (proximal) mineralisation 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 87 

domains occurs mainly as free gold in quartz and carbonate gangue, and occasionally as grains 
attached to or marginally embedded in Sb sulphides. Free gold grain sizes range from less than 
20 µm and 1.2 mm in length and show a bimodal size distribution with peaks between 10 µm to 
30 µm and 50 µm to 70 µm, thus giving the high-grade zones (proximal phase) its nuggety nature.  

A series of RC, PQ, HQ, and NQ diamond twin holes were drilled in 2013 to conduct bias tests 
between equally represented areas of DD and RC drilling within the CZ Mineral Resources (Table 
10-2). The primary aim of the drill twin analysis was to investigate any potential smearing of grade 
due to coarse gold and to determine if there was a volume variance effect related to the sample 
size (RC vs DDH).

The results indicated that, when compared to RC drilling, smaller diameter core such as NQ and 
HQ core do not provide a fully representative sample that is repeatable, due to the high nugget 
factor within the high-grade (proximal) zones, regardless of the analysis method selected (fire 
assay or bulk LeachWELL plus tail fire assay).  

A direct comparison of the DD data with 50 g fire assay dataset and RC drill data with bulk 
LeachWELL plus fire assay tails demonstrates a significant negative skew in the grade 
distribution of the former, for both the high-grade zones (proximal) and the low-grade zones 
(distal) domains.  

The Massawa CZ 2016 Mineral Resource estimation dataset comprises a combination of DD 
data with 50 g fire assay determinations and RC drill data with bulk LeachWELL plus tail fire 
assay determination, even with the known volume variance bias.  

There is no significant bias between the mineralised RC wet samples and the rest of the 
mineralised RC data indicating that the wet samples are not inducing grade smearing in the RC 
holes. Considering only the RC data, the percentage of the mineralised wet data is 4.1%. A review 
of all the data (including RC and DDH samples), indicates that the overall percentage of the 
mineralised wet data is 3.7%. 

At the current stage of the Project, the negative bias of the lower volume samples is considered 
to be an acceptable level of conservatism within the resource estimate and subsequent economic 
analysis. 

The 2017 and 2018 drilling programme within Massawa CZ Mineral Resource has effectively 
replaced all historic DD data utilising 50 g fire assay dataset with new RC drill data with bulk 
LeachWELL plus tail fire assay, such that future Mineral Resource updates will exclude all historic 
DD data with 50 g fire assay determination. Pilot Plant campaigns have been conducted on 
subsequent RC drill areas with the aim to reconcile the estimate against the Pilot Plant 
campaigns. 

10.11.2. Massawa Northern Zone 

NZ deportment testwork has demonstrated that the gold mineralisation is largely refractory to 
direct cyanide leaching developed within the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite and, to a lesser extent, 
arsenian pyrite. There is no direct evidence in any work completed to date that could suggest 
that the NZ mineralisation contains a significant coarse free gold component. This is supported 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 89 

by the repeatability of sample results within both twin drill holes and field duplicates to date using 
conventional NQ and HQ DD core sample volumes plus 50 g fire assay analysis.  

Drill sample size bias tests between equally represented areas of DD and RC drilling in NZ 
Mineral Resources have not indicated the presence of any significant bias associated with 
sample volume differences (Table 10-3), due to significantly lower quantities of coarse visible 
gold associated with the mineralisation. Additional gold deportment studies will be completed on 
NZ as part of the feasibility work programme.

10.11.3. Sofia Main and Sofia North  

Gold deportment testwork at Sofia has shown that the gold mineralisation is entirely free milling, 
associated with pyrite sulphide assemblages. Modelled nugget of 0.21 at Sofia Main and 0.22 at 
Sofia North are good representations of the average variance (0.21) between twin DDH and RC 
holes (Table 10-4).

Delya Main is located to the northeast of Massawa CZ along the MTZ. Twin hole analysis

10.11.5. Twinning Summary 

In the QP's opinion the drilling and sampling methodologies are of a suitable quality and the 
samples are representative of the mineralisation.  

It is fully understood that in using the smaller volume, the sample data is creating a negative bias 
within the Mineral Resource estimate of the Massawa CZ. Both the DD data with 50 g fire assay 
determinations and RC drill data with bulk sample LeachWELL plus tail assay determination are 
spatially distributed across the entire of the Massawa CZ domain (Figure 10-3) and as such there 
is no known spatial bias that is skewing the sample size distribution for each of the sample types.

10.12. Drill Spacing Optimisation 

10.12.1. Massawa Grade Control  

Due to the high variability of gold grades associated with the multiple vein sets along the strike 
of Massawa, a close space GC drill programme was undertaken. This drill programme was 
designed to optimise the GC drill spacing by analysing the potential change in tonnage and grade 
associated with a change in the density of close space drilling. 

A 150 m strike length portion of both CZ and NZ2 was selected for the GC drill programme. The 
CZ GC zone was drilled to a 5 m by 5 m (X by Y) spacing, whereas the NZ2 GC portion was 
drilled to a 5 m by 10 m (X by Y) spacing.  

10.12.2. Central Zone Grade Control  

The GC drilled portion of the CZ was selected where abundant phase 2 (proximal) domain quartz-
stibnite veins is present adjacent to a porphyritic intrusion. The NE orientation of the CZ meant 
that the GC drill holes were drilled along a 320° strike and at -50° dip in order to effectively test 
40 vertical meters of mineralisation. This drill grid design also accounted for the general SE dip 
of the phase 2 (proximal) domain quartz-stibnite veins. A total of 640 drill holes (34,542 m) were 
drilled along 29 lines. In total, the GC drilling intersected five of the primary phase 2 (proximal) 
mineralised domains and two sets of discontinuous brittle zones. 

Subsequent change of support GC drill spacing tests were completed by progressively removing 
lines of drilling from the estimation dataset and then creating new mineralisation wireframes for 
the remaining data and creating a new GC model for the reduced spacing. 

All change of support models were generated using the same parameters as definitions as that 
of the 2016 Massawa CZ Resource model. The results of the GC drilling indicate minimal change 
in ounces with a 15 m Y by 5 m X spacing for GC and a 5% to 6% reduction in total contained 
metal at a 15 m Y by 10 m X spacing. All wider drill spacing showed a significant under estimation 
of Au ounces (Figure 10-4). Subsequently a 15 m Y by 10 m X spacing was selected as an 
appropriate advanced GC (AdvGC) spacing to delineate the long thin anastomosing nature of the 
mineralised lodes and complete a reasonable grade estimate.

23rd July 2019 Page 92 

 

Figure 10-4 Grade Tonnage Curves for CZ1 GC Spacing Optimisation Models 

10.12.3. Central Zone Mineral Resource  

The majority of the CZ is drilled on 40 m to 50 m sections with a mixture of RC and DD (see 
Figure 7-5). There are six discrete blocks of RC 15 m by 10 m drilling spread along the strike of 
the CZ which have been drilled to test the impact of the AdvGC spaced drill definition against the 
original model, all of which has consistently resulted in a decrease in tonnes and increase in 
grade with minimal impact on ounces. There is also one large block of 5 m by 5 m RC, which was 
drilled as part of the drill spacing optimisation. 

10.12.4. Northern Zone 2 Grade Control  

The GC drilled portion of NZ2 was selected for drill spacing optimisation in order to intersect the 
known high-grade gold zones. The NE orientation of NZ2 also meant that the GC drill holes were 
drilled along a 300° strike and at -50° dip to effectively test 40 vertical metres of mineralisation. 
A total of 217 drill holes (8,370 m) were completed along 16 lines. The drilling intersected both 
the high-grade domain and the main mineralisation zone, as well as defining some extensions of 
small discontinuous HW brittle zones of mineralisation. 

Subsequent change of support, GC drill spacing tests were completed by progressively removing 
lines of drilling from the estimation dataset and then creating new mineralisation wireframes for 
the remaining data and creating a new GC model for the reduced spacing. 

All change of support models were generated using the same process parameters and definitions 
as the 2016 Massawa NZ Resource model. The results of the GC change of support drilling 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 93 

indicate that 20 m Y by 10 m X spacing resulted in a 2% over estimation of total contained metal 
relative to the 10 m Y by 5 m X spacing. Subsequently, 20 m Y by 10 m X spacing was selected 
as an appropriate AdvGC spacing to delineate the long thin anastomosing nature of the 
mineralised lodes and complete a reasonable grade estimate. All wider drill spacing showed a 
significant over estimation of Au ounces (Figure 10-5). 

 

Figure 10-5 Grade Tonnage Curves for NZ2 GC Spacing Optimisation Models 

10.12.5. Northern Zone Mineral Resource  

Most the CZ is drilled on 40 m to 50 m sections with a mixture of RC and DD. There are two 
discrete blocks of RC drilling at 15 m by 10 m, one in NZ1 and one in NZ2 which have been 
drilled to test the impact of the AdvGC spaced drill definition against the original model. There is 
also one large block of 5 m by 5 m RC which was drilled as part of the drill spacing optimisation. 

The QP is not aware of any drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the results.

11. Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

This chapter summarises the analytical techniques used at Massawa, the quality assurance and 
quality control (QA/QC) performance of the assay data, and the various re-assay protocols that 
were implemented for the feasibility programme. In addition, results from the various round robin 
programmes for the different analytical methods are also discussed.  

11.1. Sample Preparation 

Minimal sample preparation is carried out on site. Core samples are cut in half with a diamond 
saw and broken into smaller rock pieces for packaging. Approximately 3 kg of material per sample 
is sent to the laboratory for assay. Laboratory sample preparation includes weighing and drying, 
and crushing to 75% passing 2 mm. A 250 g or 1,000 g split (for fire assay and bulk respectively) 
is then pulverised to 85% passing 75 μm. 

11.2. Sample Analysis 

11.2.1. Massawa Northern Zone and Satellite Zones 

For the Massawa NZ and satellite deposits, all samples were assayed by conventional 50 g Fire 
Assay (FA) with an Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) finish.  

Massawa NZ samples are analysed by SGS Loulo laboratory at the Loulo mine site in Mali, where 
samples are analysed using lead collection 50 g fire assay with atomic absorption finish with a 
gravimetric finish for any samples reporting above 100 g/t Au. 

Massawa CZ samples are analysed by SGS Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. SGS Ouagadougou 
is used for all bulk 1 kg sample LeachWELL analysis (LWL69M) and 50 g fire assay of the 
remaining tail concentrate (FAA505T). 

All samples for the Sofia Mineral Resource are analysed by SGS Loulo laboratory at the 
neighbouring Loulo mine site in Mali or SGS Bamako laboratory also in Mali. SGS Bamako is 
used for sample overflow, and for analysis that cannot be completed at SGS Loulo. Both 
laboratories are certified and operated independently by SGS. All Sofia Mineral Resource 
samples are analysed using lead collection 50 g fire assay with atomic absorption finish with a 
gravimetric finish for any samples reporting above 100 g/t Au. 

All laboratories are certified and operated independently by SGS. 

In addition, 500 g Metallic Screen (+/- 75 µm) fire assays (MSFAS30K) were also carried out at 
SGS Ouagadougou on the NZ samples. No significant assay bias was observed, likely due to 
lower amounts of coarse gold. No such testwork has been completed on Sofia and Delya samples 
to date, however, recent studies have shown a different sulphide assemblage with gold 
mineralisation directly associated with pyrite and no occurrence of free gold. In the QP's opinion, 
FA remains the most appropriate assay technique for the Sofia, Delya, and Massawa NZ.

For the CZ, where nuggety gold is present, a series of heterogeneity tests were completed on 
RC samples to determine the most appropriate laboratory analytical methodology to provide the 
most representative quantification of gold content. As part of the testwork, duplicate bulk one-
kilogram sample LeachWELL analyses, in addition to standard 50 g FA, were completed at SGS 
Ouagadougou to test what sample size would provide more representative grades for samples 
with significant coarse gold content. LeachWELL is a reagent grade catalyst formulated for fast 
cyanide leach gold assaying, developed by Mineral Process Control (MPC). In addition to assay 
of the LeachWELL solutions, the residues (FA tails) are also assayed by 50 g FA to calculate a 
total gold grade (LeachWELL+FAtails).  

The testwork samples were separated based upon the logged redox boundary in order to 
determine if there were any significant differences in the sample size requirements for assay of 
oxidised mineralisation and reduced fresh (sulphide) mineralisation. Results from this testwork 
indicated that for oxide samples the data shows a consistent bias for all grade ranges, with 
LeachWELL data showing a 24% increase in average grades and 28% increase in median grades 
relative to the FA data (Figure 11-1). For sulphide samples, the bias between the two assay 
techniques is less significant with LeachWELL data showing 8% increase in median grades 
relative to FA. The variance is more obvious above 5 g/t Au.

In addition to this, field duplicate analysis of multiple splits from the same RC sample showed a 
correlation in excess of 85% for LeachWELL, which is considered an acceptable level of 
repeatability. In contrast, both 50 g FA showed low levels of repeatability (<80% correlation of 
field duplicates). As a result, the LeachWELL method was chosen as the preferred assay method 
for the CZ FS to limit the sample volume variance of the nuggety ore. Although significant, the 
assay bias is minimal compared to the bias caused by the sample volume variance of RC vs 
DDH samples as described in Section 10.15.  

Equivalent heterogeneity tests utilising metallic screen fire assays (MSFAS30K) returned lower 
grades than the LeachWELL analysis. Based upon this and the inefficiency of the technique for 
large sample volumes, this method was not chosen for the CZ FS. 

11.2.3. LeachWELL Protocols 

Over the course of the feasibility programme, the LeachWELL parameters at SGS Ouagadougou 
were modified and procedures revised after optimisation cyanide leaching testwork and 
guidelines set out by MPC. The three LeachWELL methods used during the FS are summarised 
in Table 11-1.

The initial LeachWELL method used at SGS (LWL69M) followed the pilot LeachWELL testwork 
at BIGS Global Ouagadougou laboratory in Q4 2014. A small programme of 33 sulphide samples 
from twin RC and DDH drilling from the CZ were analysed on a 12 hr and 24 hr leach. 
Approximately 50% of the samples leached for 12 hrs show notably lower dissolutions and higher 
tail grades (mean grade of 15.1 g/t Au, median grade of 3.04 g/t Au) than samples leached for 
24 hrs (mean grade of 6.6 g/t Au, median grade of 2.74 g/t Au). This bias is observed for all grade 
ranges from <1 g/t Au to >100 g/t Au. Results are presented below in Table 11-2 and Figure 11-2. 
The higher tail grades in the 12 hr LeachWELL samples relative to the 24 hr LeachWELL splits, 
and the variability in the total grades, was explained by incomplete dissolution of coarse gold 
grains over a 12 hr leach period, so the decision was made to use 24 hr leaching times for 
LeachWELL analysis going forward. The incomplete dissolution of the coarse gold grains over

12 hrs was confirmed by gold deportment studies, which showed frequent moth-eaten partial 
dissolution textures.

During the FS, the LeachWELL protocols were modified to meet the guidelines set out by MPC, 
and to standardise the procedure ahead of round robin testwork. The new SGS LeachWELL 
method (LWL69M5) included the following changes: (1) increasing the cyanide (CN)- 
concentration (five LeachWELL tablets instead of one tablet; so one tablet per 200 g of sample 
and 400 mL of water); (2) no addition of lime to prevent pH from rising above 11.5, as high levels 
of Sb can retard cyanidation in highly alkaline, neutral and acidic solutions (optimum pH 10-11.5); 
(3) more stringent controls on recording pH for every sample; and (4) duplicate 50 g FA analysis 
of the tails to validate for any sample bias in residues. In addition, external laboratory audits were 
carried out by senior Randgold geologists which led to alterations to several steps during sample 
preparation and analysis to reduce the risk of cross contamination and improve efficiency.   

The change to five LeachWELL tablets (one tablet per 200 mL of water; five tablets for 1,000 g 
of sample at 50% solids), instead of one tablet, was aimed to maximise Au dissolution over a 
24 hr residence time to better quantify the amenability of the ore to direct CN leaching (Figure 
11-3A). The change in cyanide concentration has no effect on the total assay, only Au dissolution 
(Figure 11-3B).

In March 2018, a final revision of the LeachWELL procedure was made (LWL69M5RG). Two 
phases of testwork at SGS Randfontein and SGS Ouagadougou were designed to test whether 
the residence time could be decreased from 24 hr to 12 hr, and thus increase turnaround at the 
laboratory. MPC suggests that the majority of gold should be leached within four hours using the 
LeachWELL method; although early pilot testwork at BIGS Global Burkina (BIGS Global) 
highlighted incomplete leaching at 12 hr. However, it is noted that this work used lower CN- 
concentrations (one LeachWELL tablet per 2 kg of sample) than suggested by MPC (one tablet 
per 200 g of sample).  

The first phase of testwork was undertaken at SGS Randfontein and included kinetic LeachWELL 
analysis of six composites with intermediate solutions taken at 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, and 18 hr with a 
total residence time of 24 hr, with the same parameters as outlined in the previous section. The 
composites included saprolite, saprock, and sulphide mineralisation with variable grades from 
0.8 g/t Au to 30 g/t Au. The kinetic tests show that on average 95% of the gold dissolution 
occurred in the first four hours (Figure 11-4; Table 11-3), as anticipated by MPC. The kinetic 
curves also do not show a progressive reduction in dissolution with time, suggesting that the 
material is not preg-robbing.

The second phase of testwork at SGS Ouagadougou included duplicate analysis LeachWELL 
(12 hr vs 24 hr) analysis of 75 selected mineralisation samples from the CZ Pilot Plant blocks. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 101 

Results show no bias between the 24 hr and 12 hr datasets, with median weighted total grades 
within 5% variance. Results are highlighted in the scatter and QQ plots in Figure 11-5. Based on 
these results, the residence time in LWL69M5RG update was decreased from 24 hr to 12 hr. 
Other changes to the protocol included reducing standing time to below six to eight hours after 
agitation has ceased and aliquot of solution taken for AAS, and filtration of the tails. Also, a more 
thorough filtration and washing procedure was implemented on the preparation of the tail 
samples. These changes were made to limit the chance of over reporting in the tails analysis.

11.3. Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

In order to ensure that the assay results are reliable, the Project has a robust QA/QC system in 
place to minimise errors at each stage, as well as procedures to be followed when errors are 
identified. This section covers the Delya, Sofia, and Massawa QA/QC analysis, from 20th 
December 2016 to 31st October 2018 (QA/QC review period). The majority of the samples were 
analysed by SGS at various locations including the Bamako, Ouagadougou, and Tarkwa 
commercial laboratories, in addition to the Loulo Mine laboratory. Analysis included conventional 
50 g FA/AAS (FAA550) and one-kilogram accelerated bulk leach (LeachWELL; LWL69M5, 
LWL69M5RG). A minority of samples were assayed at BIGS Global laboratory in Ouagadougou.  

11.3.1. Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates were used to measure the precision of the whole sampling chain from primary 
sample collection, sub-sampling, through to laboratory sample preparation and analysis. 
Duplicates were inserted at a rate of one in every 20 samples. Mid-way through the FS, this was 
changed to one in every 20 samples within the mineralisation. A total of 1,346 field duplicates 
were analysed from the Massawa NZ and the satellite zones by FAA550, and 1,094 field 
duplicates were analysed from the Massawa CZ using LeachWELL (Table 11-4). Field duplicates 
show good correlation for all samples assayed by all the laboratories, with >93% correlation for 
FAA550 analysis method and >91% correlation for LWL69M5+LWL69M5RG analysis method. 
Such correlations can indicate that there is little or no bias in the results. Overall the results 
returned are acceptable.

11.3.2. Duplicate Analysis of LeachWELL Residues 

LeachWELL methods LWL69M5 and LWL69MRG include duplicate FA/AAS analysis of the 
residues for every sample. This was implemented to establish if any sample bias is still present 
in the 50 g tail assays. The tail duplicates for both SGS Ouagadougou and SGS Tarkwa show 
excellent repeatability for both laboratories with a correlation of 0.98, and thus no sample volume 
variance is present in the residue analysis (Figure 11-9 and Figure 11-10).

11.3.3. Blanks 

Blank samples are free media (Au-free for these analyses) assayed to help ensure no false-
positives are obtained from the laboratories and to check for contamination. Commercial blank 
OREAS27b was used for the FS. Blanks were inserted into the sample stream at a rate of 1:20 
samples for LWL69M5+LWL69M5RG (1 kg) and 1:20 samples for FAA550 (approximately 200 
g). These samples undergo the same sample preparation as the drill samples and are used to 
detect contamination due to poor cleaning of sample preparation equipment throughout the 
various sub-sampling processes. 

A total of 4,115 samples were analysed using FAA550 and 3,067 were analysed using 
LWL69M5+LWL69M5RG. All blanks samples were evaluated against 2 to 3 times the standard 
deviation (SD) as the acceptable limit. Blank samples performed well within the period and 
sample contamination is within the acceptable limits at all the laboratories. The overall 
performance shows that approximately 99% of the blanks assayed are within acceptable limits 
(Table 11-5).

11.3.4. Certified Reference Materials 

Certified Reference Materials (CRM) were inserted into each batch at a frequency of one in 20 
mineralised samples for LWL69M5/LWL69M5RG and one in 20 samples for FAA550, in order to 
validate results reported by the laboratory and also monitor the control and calibration of the 
instruments used by the laboratory.  

CRMs used within the QA/QC review period (20th December 2016 to 31st October 2018) were 
sourced from OREAS Australia, with 60 g sachets used for FAA550 and one-kilogram material 
used for LeachWELL. CRMs performed well, however, there is room for improvement. A total of 
3,843 CRMs consisting of 25 types of CRMs were analysed using FAA550 and 2,280 CRMs 
consisting of 11 types were analysed using LWL69M5/LWL69M5RG during the period (Table 
11-6).

11.4. Re-Assay Protocols 

Out of 1,109 batches of results received from 20th December 2016 to 31st October 2018, 57 
batches failed QA/QC and were re-assayed. Both original and re-assayed batches have been 
stored in the database with the re-assay data being prioritized. Although the QA/QC failures are 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the guidelines below were used for the FS (Table 11-7 and 
Table 11-8).

analysed up to and including halfway to the closest passed QA/QC samples. The number 
of samples for re-assay depends on the insertion ratio.

o Example (1): Fire assay (QA/QC insertion ratio 1/20) 10 samples above and below 
the failed QA/QC samples should be re-assayed.  

o Example (2): LeachWELL (>120 m hole – in ore: 1/25 QA/QC insertion ratio) 13 
samples above and below the failed QA/QC samples should be re-assayed. 

• Extended (ext.) Bracketed re-assay: all samples above and below the failed QA/QC 
samples must be re-analysed up to and including the closest passed QA/QC samples. 
The number of samples for re-assay depends on the insertion ratio.  

o Example (1): LeachWELL (<120 m hole – in ore: 1/20 QA/QC insertion ratio) 20 
samples above and below + passed QA/QC samples (CRM-blank-duplicate) totalling 
approximately 46 samples should be re-assayed.  

o Example (2): LeachWELL (>120 m hole – in waste: 1/50 QA/QC insertion ratio) 50 
samples above and below + passed QA/QC samples (CRM-blank) totalling 
approximately 104 samples should be re-assayed.  

• Tray re-assay: all samples run in a single FA furnace tray (typically approximately 74 
samples) should be re-assayed. The number of samples to be confirmed with laboratory 
before re-assay requested. This should include all QA/QC samples in the batch. 

• Whole Batch re-assay: all samples within the batch (100 to 200 samples) including 
QA/QC samples (CRMs-blanks-duplicates) must be analysed.  

11.5. Round Robin Studies 

Various campaigns of round robin testwork haму been carried out on the Massawa deposit during 
the pre-feasibility and feasibility programmes. These studies largely concentrated on the CZ and 
tested the reproducibility and reliability of the LeachWELL analysis and the SGS Ouagadougou 
laboratory. 

11.5.1. Pre-feasibility Programmes  

In Q1 2015, an initial phase of LeachWELL round robin testwork was completed. A total of 50 
representative oxide ore samples from the 5 m by 5 m GC grid of the CZ were selected for 
analysis at SGS Ouagadougou and BIGS Global. The LeachWELL parameters for both 
laboratories at the time of analysis are summarised in Table 11-9, the most notable difference 
being the sample weight.

Results from the round robin work are presented in Figure 11-13 and Table 11-10. The 2 kg BIGS 
Global samples showed lower dissolutions and higher tail grades compared to the 1 kg SGS 
samples. In total, 47 of the 50 (94%) samples analysed by BIGS Global displayed higher tail 
grades than those analysed by SGS, with mean tails grades 87.5% higher (3.44 g/t Au). The total 
grades reflect the bias in the tails grades, with consistently higher total grades reported from the 
BIGS Global samples.

The higher residue grades in the BIGS Global samples were initially explained as lower degrees 
of dissolution in the larger 2 kg samples relative to the 1 kg samples analysed at SGS 
Ouagadougou (twice the material to leach for the same CN- concentration). The cyanide 
dissolution issue at BIGS Global were later confirmed by detailed gold deportment studies on 
selected high-grade (over 10 g/t Au) tail samples. Petrographic analysis of residue gold grains 
shows pronounced moth-eaten textures indicative of partial leaching. However, the amount of 
variance in the tail grades and the bias seen in the total grades suggested an additional factor 
was involved, which was investigated in more detail during the FS round robin programmes. The 
BIGS Global laboratory was resistant to change its LeachWELL procedures and so the decision 
was made to use SGS Ouagadougou as the primary assay laboratory (SGS Tarkwa as overflow 
laboratory) for the CZ pre-feasibility and feasibility programmes. 

11.5.2. Feasibility Programmes  

During Q4 2017 to Q3'2018, a phased inter-laboratory round robin testwork programme was 
carried out on the Massawa CZ. A total of 600 representative mineralised samples from across 
the strike length of the CZ were selected and analysed at ALS Ouagadougou and Bureau Veritas 
(BV) Abidjan to test for the reproducibility of the feasibility SGS Ouagadougou LeachWELL data, 
and to test for any sample bias. The representative sample suite included saprolite, 
oxidised+reduced saprock, and sulphide mineralisation in an approximate 20/15/65 ratio. 

Comparisons of the total grades (LeachWELL solution plus the tail FA) show variability on a 
sample-by-sample basis (a third of the samples show greater than 25% variance); however, 
mean total grades for all campaigns are within 9% variance. Some of the more nuggety parts of 
the CZ system show higher variance with mean grades up to 25% higher in the original SGS 
analysis (Table 11-11). This bias is more evident in samples below 10 g/t Au (Figure 11-14A-B). 
To help explain this bias, a statistical comparison was carried out on both the individual solution 
and FA residue assays. Slightly higher LeachWELL solutions grades are recorded at the round 
robin laboratories (Figure 11-14C-D), but the main difference is seen in the FA residue data 
(Figure 11-14E-F). A consistent bias is seen for all grade ranges, with significantly higher 
(average 30% variance) residue grades reported at SGS (weighted average of 3.15 ± 0.5 g/t Au) 
compared to ALS/BV (weighted average of 2.20 ± 0.43 g/t Au). This bias is seen in all campaigns 
except the northernmost part of the CZ (Block K/L) (Table 11-11). As a result, lower dissolutions 
are reported in the SGS data relative to the repeat testwork.

LeachWELL solution grades and tail assays for Block G are not compared in this table as the leaching parameters for this campaign 
were slightly different between SGS and ALS (original Block G assays collected before the change in LeachWELL procedure outlined 
in the opening paragraph of the feasibility round robin section).  
PP4 round robin analysis was carried out at BV Abidjan, all other round robin campaigns were completed at ALS Ouagadougou. 
RR – round robin. 

Some of the variability shown in Figure 11-57 and Table 11-11 can be explained by the sample 
bias; in particular, PP3 is located in the highest grade (and most nuggety) part of the CZ. 
However, an apparent over reporting of the tail grades was flagged to SGS in early 2018. 
Discussions with SGS technical staff, other laboratories, and external laboratory audits 
highlighted that excessive standing time (>8 hours) between the end of rolling and filtration of the 
residues, and poor washing and filtration of the tails were possible causes. In March 2018, the 
LeachWELL procedure was updated (LWL69M5RG) and lower batch volumes initiated so SGS 
Ouagadougou could filter the residues thoroughly within six to eight hours after agitation has 
ceased and the aliquot of solution taken for AAS analysis.  

11.5.3. Fire Assay Umpire Analysis 

An umpire assaying programme was previously completed on a significant drill programme in 
2010.  This umpire analysis tested the SGS Loulo and SGS Kayes (Mali) laboratories against the 
OMAC Laboratory, Ireland. These results indicated that the OMAC umpire results returned higher 
grades than those of SGS Loulo and SGS Kayes, although they were impacted by one significant 
outlier. Once the outlier was removed, the results were significantly closer overall.  A slight 
negative bias was outlined by Randgold against the SGS Loulo and SGS Kayes laboratory, 
however, both were considered as being acceptable, with the SGS Loulo laboratory noted for its 
higher precision. The more recent round-robin LeachWELL analysis has provided confidence in 
the general SGS Ouagadougou laboratory procedures and analysis in light of any umpire 
analysis. 

11.6. Sample Security 

Labelled samples are placed into large bags (10 at a time) and these are sealed. The samples 
are placed in a crate which are transported to the warehouse and trucked to the relevant 
laboratory by Randgold personnel. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 117 

All laboratory sample backlogs are actively monitored on a weekly basis and the number of 
samples dispatched is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the laboratory backlog does not 
become more than one month's sample processing capability. 

In the instance that the laboratory backlog does exceed that of one week's sample processing 
capability, all samples are retained onsite in Massawa in a secured locked container until they 
can be dispatched. 

Results from all laboratories are emailed to a project email group and are later imported into the 
database by the Database Administrator. A paper certificate is mailed at a later date. 

Until the end of 2016 all project data had been stored in MS Access databases. During the first 
quarter of 2017 all project data has been migrated and secured in industry standard Maxwell 
Datashed SQL database for optimal validation through constraints, library tables, triggers, and 
stored procedures. All site software application databases will be set up to link back to the main 
database for information retrieval via and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) link. 

11.7. Audit 

A full external audit of the sampling methods and procedures was undertaken by Roscoe Postle 
Associates Inc. (RPA) in 2017. RPA did not identify any material issues. Two high priority issues 
were identified, the collection of bulk densities which did not follow Randgold standard operating 
procedures (SOP) from other sites, and laboratory certification and selection with regard to 
LeachWELL analysis. Bulk density sampling has been updated to meet the same standard as at 
other Barrick Africa and Middle East sites. LeachWELL certification does not currently exist, 
however, Randgold undertook a programme of laboratory round robin assaying using its current 
assaying procedures and 1 kg custom OREAS CRM standards which indicated there to be no 
issue with repeatability of these samples. All other minor 'housekeeping' issues outlined in the 
RPA audit have been reviewed and acted upon where required.  

In the QP's opinion, the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures at the Project are 
adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources. The QA/QC programmes as designed 
and implemented by Randgold are adequate and the assay results within the database are 
suitable for use in a Mineral Resource estimate.

12. Data Verification 

All QPs authoring this technical report have been directly involved with the development of the 
Massawa Project since 2012. Consequently, all QPs have been directly responsible for reviewing 
all forms of Project data used for the estimation of Mineral Resources and Reserves. 

The Massawa Mineral Resource databases are considered to be appropriate to be used for the 
estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The inclusion of sample data that is 
negatively biased within the Massawa Mineral Resource is considered to provide an acceptable 
level of conservatism within the estimation of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, and 
economic evaluation. 

The Sofia Mineral Resource databases are considered to be appropriate to be used for the 
estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. 

In April 2017, a dedicated Massawa based database administrator was appointed who is 
overseen by the Loulo regional database administrator. 

Up until Q1 2017, logging took place on paper logging sheets with the geologist later transcribing 
the data into a custom Microsoft (MS) Excel template that contained fixed drop-down options to 
reduce human error. Once completed the Loulo database manager was responsible for verifying 
the data and uploading it to the MS Access database. For this Mineral Resource estimate, a 
selection of assay values in the database were checked against the original assay certificates 
and no errors were observed. 

Since the commencement of the feasibility study in Q1 2017, all logging has been undertaken 
directly into Maxwell LogChief running on Dell Tough Tablets to help reduce transcription errors. 
LogChief also includes many cross-validation tools to ensure that the data is correct. The data is 
automatically uploaded from LogChief to a buffer table pending Senior Geologist's approval prior 
to uploading to the central database. 

During Q1 2017, all Project data was migrated and secured in industry standard Maxwell 
Datashed SQL database for optimal validation through constraints, library tables, triggers, and 
stored procedures. All site software application databases will be set up to link back to the main 
database for information retrieval via Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). 

During the migration to SQL database, initially all assay data was migrated from the access 
database. Subsequently, all assay data has been re-imported directly from assay certificates from 
the laboratory and ranked such that they will have a higher priority than the MS Access imported 
data. Since the upgrade to Datashed, all assay values are directly imported from the raw 
laboratory certificates. 

In the QP's opinion, database verification procedures for the Project are adequate for the 
purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

13. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

13.1. Summary of Metallurgical Testing Programmes 

The Massawa concession currently holds three major gold deposits. These are the Massawa (CZ 
and NZ), Sofia (Sofia Main and North), and Delya deposits. There are several other satellite 
deposits within the permit area.  

Free-milling ore occurs in Sofia and most of CZ, and there is refractory mineralisation in the 
northern part of CZ as well as NZ and Delya. The refractory ores have been proven to be highly 
recoverable through BIOX as an oxidative step. 

The CZ and the refractory ore contain deleterious elements such as arsenic (As) and antimony 
(Sb). Where the CZ is not processed through BIOX, testwork has proven that the As and Sb can 
be removed successfully through a precipitation plant designed by Multotec. During the refractory 
processing phase, the neutralisation section of the BIOX plant will remove the precipitate and 
these elements. As an additional mitigation, the Multotec precipitation plant will process any liquor 
that is released from the tailings storage facility (TSF) to the environment. 

There have been a number of testwork programmes completed on Massawa ores. Some testwork 
was performed to help validate the results of historic studies. A summary of the testwork to date 
can be found in Table 13-1, Table 13-2, and Table 13-3.

Central Zone high sulphide direct cyanidation is not 
an option for the Massawa gold ore. Since most of 
the sub-microscopic gold is in solid solution in 
sulphides, a pre-leach oxidation step is necessary. 
Given the good liberation of the sulphides and gold 
ROM rock at reasonable grinds (P80 = 120-130 µm) 
the recommended treatment option is flotation 
followed by BIOX or POX/CIL or UFG/Albion/CIL 
depending on the gold inventory.

Three process routes for the CZ were 
identified from the PFS and current on-going 
testwork programme indicate that the 
proposed treatment route would require a 
trade-off study to identify the most suitable 
processing route before the BFS 
deliverables can commence. 

The WOL of CZ is financially viable 
down to overall Au recoveries of 
67%. This is measured against CZ 
being processed as a CZ and NZ 
blend, to lower operating cost. This 
necessitates the blending of 25% CZ 
and 75% NZ during flotation and 
utilises flotation tails recycling in the 
neutralisation stage.

Recently SENET was requested by 
Randgold to revaluate the proposed circuit 
and to develop a more simplistic flow sheet 
that would be able to treat both ore types in 
a single CIL circuit to reduce capital costs. 

To conclude the 6 stage adsorption 
at 2500 m3 each can bring down the 
dissolved gold losses to below the 
required 0.010 mg/L Au for the 
flotation concentrates (CZ and NZ). 
The only disadvantage is doubling 
up the carbon inventory. The elution 
batch size of 12 tons is suitable for 
all the scenarios.

plant is bought the operating cost is 
$0.14/t ore and owner operated 
$0.39/t ore. The operating cost for 
the owner bought plant is 60% less 
when compared to the rental option. 

13.2. Summary of Results 

The extensive metallurgical testwork campaigns demonstrate two distinct behavioural patterns. 
The first includes ore sources, in particular oxides as well as some fresh rock sulphides from 
Sofia Main, Sofia North and most of CZ, that exhibit free-milling characteristics suitable for gold 
extraction by a conventional CIL metallurgical process. These ores also contain gravity 
recoverable gold and, in CZ, GRG is as high as 50% of the gold.  

The second ore type is highly refractory, with very low gravity recoverable gold, and is found in 
the north of the CZ pit, in the NZ pit, and Delya. Flotation and BIOX are combined to achieve 
overall recoveries in excess of 85% for this ore type. The flotation tailings grades achieved were 
below 0.4 g/t Au and exhibited very low CIL recoveries. 

Based on the above, the Massawa plant design consists of two distinct processing circuits which 
will run sequentially: 

• For the first seven years, the free-milling ore sources will run through a conventional 
gravity and CIL circuit, which will include an arsenic and antimony precipitation processing 
plant before the liquor is released from the TSF to the environment. 

• From year 7 and onwards, the refractory ore sources are processed through a flotation 
circuit with a concentrate fine grinding step to P80 = 45 µm, followed by the BIOX step 
and CIL. 

Sampling for testwork was completed by the geologists in conjunction with the modelled and 
simulated pits and mine plans. The samples were selected as to ensure both spatial and 
geological representativity.  

Figure 13-1 shows the metallurgical sample location at Sofia North as an example.

The samples selected were based on geological classification, grade, as well as representivity of 
the ore being tested. Scouting tests were then undertaken on a composite sample to determine 
optimum operating conditions in terms of grind, residence time and reagent additions. After this 
optimisation exercise, several samples were grouped to make up a series of variability sample 
tests, which were then tested at the afore-determined optimum conditions. 

This approach ensured that the testwork completed was representative and that the optimal 
results could be incorporated with high confidence into the design criteria, and ultimately the plant 
design and sizing. 

13.3. Recovery 

The gold recovery achieved from the free-milling ores is highly dependent on the grade processed 
through the circuit. The relationship indicates that the lower the grade, the lower the overall 
recovery of the ore.   

For example, 41 CIL results were available on the Sofia Main ROM leach pad with varied head 
grades. To determine the optimal recovery based on grade, the gold dissolution results were 
used to plot a scatter graph of head grade against tails grade distribution. A best fit linear curve 
was drawn to give predicted tails grade from head grade values. 

The following tails–head grade relationship was established from the set of results, in the form of 
a typical linear equation.  

T = (M × H) + C 

Where T = tails grade (g/t Au) 
H = head grade (g/t Au) 
M = slope 
C = constant 

Using the above relationship, predicted tails were calculated for each head grade and the 
corresponding gold dissolution was determined. The predicted gold dissolution for the given head 
assays allows predicting gold recovery based on its feed grade. 

The head grade as determined by the mine plan is the average Sofia Main fresh head grade of 
3.48 g/t Au. Applying the formula in Figure 13-2, the tails grade is calculated as T = 0.073 x (3.48) 
+ 0.103 = 0.36 g/t Au. This value is applied to the head grade of 3.48 g/t Au, which results in a 
gold recovery of 89.7%.  

This recovery of 89.7% was estimated for the ROM leach material but the same dataset also has 
a Gravity + CIL recovery, which was determined to be 88.7%. Therefore, the average gold 
recovery used for Sofia Main fresh material is 89%.

13.4. Deleterious Elements 

13.4.1. Cyanide 

Massawa chooses to abide by the guidelines of the International Cyanide Management Code. 
Massawa will follow the requisite cyanide protocols. The TSF will be lined with an HDPE liner. 
Protocols call for limited threshold discharges to the TSF and cyanide discharge concentrations 
are controlled through use of an on-line cyanide analyser and controller. The current plant 
includes a cyanide destruction circuit before slurry is deposited on the TSF. Maximum water 
return from the TSF is employed, further mitigating release to the environment.  

Further mitigation is included at the discharge end of the TSF, where a polishing cyanide 
destruction step can be included to ensure that legal requirements are met before release to the 
environment. During the refractory ore treatment, an additional ASTER cyanide destruction is 
added to destroy the thiocyanate to below the 7 ppm level. This might have to be installed earlier 
if further testwork indicates that thiocyanate might be building up in the circuit during CZ WOL 
processing. 

13.4.2. Arsenic, Antimony and Copper 

The CZ, NZ, and Delya ores contain arsenic, copper, and antimony. The NZ and Delya material 
is processed through a neutralisation step within the BIOX circuit of the main plant. Arsenic and 
other deleterious elements are to a large extent eradicated before any tailings are pumped to the 
TSF.  

The higher risk during the LOM is posed by the CZ free-milling tailings for which testwork has 
shown arsenic, antimony, and copper levels of 14.5 ppm, 52 ppm, and 13.1 ppm, respectively. 
Multotec undertook confirmatory testwork to determine what type of process is required to 
remove and precipitate these deleterious elements. The testwork indicated that a three stage 
precipitation can remove these elements, with dosing 360 mg/L ferric chloride in the first stage, 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 131 

100 mg/L in the second, and 50 mg/L in the third. The testwork has proven that all three 
deleterious elements can be precipitated and meet the stringent WHO/IFC standards.  

When CZ fresh free-milling is processed, the arsenic precipitation plant designed by Multotec will 
be built. Any water released from the TSF to the diversion dam will be processed though this 
precipitation plant.  

The pit dewatering and other waste dump run-off also indicated the presence of arsenic and 
antimony. These are at much lower levels and have been found at 0.15 mg/L As and 0.12 mg/L 
Sb concentrations. To remove these elements from the run-off, a simple greensand filtration 
system will be used, which is a simple adsorption option. The greensand will be replaced every 
two years. This approach is highly effective at these lower concentrations.

14. Mineral Resource Estimates 

The Massawa Mineral Resources consist of Massawa CZ, Massawa NZ, Sofia, Tina, Delya, and 
Bambaraya. The CZ, NZ, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources were re-estimated during 2018 
using updated geological interpretations generated from both resource definition and AdvGC 
drilling. The 2018 AdvGC drill programmes in CZ, Sofia, and Delya were designed to determine 
the optimal drill spacing required to outline an accurate local estimation, which could be used 
during the mining process.  

All Massawa Mineral Resources have been estimated using a combination of trench, RC, and 
DD date up until November 2018.  

Outside of the three principal deposits (Massawa, Sofia, and Delya), Inferred Mineral Resources 
exist for two satellite projects (Bambaraya and Tina). No exploration has taken place on 
Bambaraya and Tina since the previous Mineral Resource estimate in 2013. The satellite 
deposits have been estimated using inverse distance squared and as such have been classified 
as Inferred Mineral Resources. These satellite Inferred Mineral Resources represent less than 
28% of the total declared tonnes and less than 7% of the contained gold ounces of the Project. 
Accordingly, they do not form part of the declared Ore Reserve and have no impact on the current 
economic evaluation of the Project. Further exploration programmes are planned to be completed 
on these satellites as part of the feasibility programme, to evaluate their prospectivity with 
additional resource development. 

Additionally, modifying factors for reserve definition have been updated and refined, including 
updated mining costs, selectivity, and recoveries which are incorporated as part of the cut-off 
grade criteria. All Mineral Resource pit optimisations and associated underground reporting areas 
have been updated accordingly. 

As at 31st December 2018, the open pit (OP) Indicated Mineral Resource is estimated to be 23 
Mt at an average grade of 4.00 g/t Au containing 2.97 Moz of gold and the OP Inferred Mineral 
Resource is estimated to be 3.7 Mt at an average grade of 2.2 g/t Au for 0.26 Moz of gold. An 
underground Inferred Mineral Resource, situated below the NZ1 and NZ2 open pit solid, is 
estimated to be 2.6 Mt at an average grade of 4.1 g/t Au containing 0.35 Moz gold (Table 14-1).

Mineral Resources for Massawa were generated by Simon Bottoms, MGeol, FGS CGeol, FAusIMM, an employee of the company 
and Qualified Person. 
 

Barrick is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource 
estimate. 

The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared according to the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves standards and guidelines 
published and maintained by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of 
Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia (the 
JORC (2012) Code). Barrick has reconciled the Mineral Resources to Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves dated 10th May 2014 as incorporated into NI 43-101, and there are no material 
differences. 

14.1. Geological Modelling 

14.1.1. Modelling Techniques 

Cross sections were generated for all deposits by drawing vertical sections approximately 
perpendicular to the strike direction of the mineralised zones in Maptek Vulcan, Seequent 
Leapfrog, and Micromine. Geological models, including the mineralisation wireframes, were 
generated by the on-site Massawa geology team who were directly responsible for the geological 
logging, thus ensuring that the wireframes are geologically representative of the mineralised 
bodies. 

The mineralisation wireframes for Sofia, Delya, and Massawa NZ were generated through 
drawing a string outlining the edges of mineralisation intercepts on vertical sections in Vulcan. 
The vertical sections are generally spaced 10 m apart, except in areas where the GC orientation 
drilling has been completed which are spaced at half of the drill spacing (e.g. 5 m sections for 10 
m along strike drill spacing). This allows for two intermediate section strings between each line 
of drilling. The use of intermediate strings allows for the wireframes to be smoothed between 
sections, particularly when the mineralised body anastomoses both horizontally and vertically.  

The vertical section strings are snapped to the exact intersection within all forms of data including 
surface trenches, RC, and DD holes thereby ensuring that the points that define the wireframe 
intersect the drill hole or trench. Thereafter, the strings on each section are connected to form a 
3D triangulated solid. Where a mineralised zone terminates, the wireframe is projected along 
strike by 50% of the drill spacing (mean distance of 25 m). 

The wireframes are again checked against the hardcopy hand-drawn sections, and then cut to 
the 5 m resolution LIDAR topographic surface, for Massawa and Sofia, the sections are cut to 
the 10 m resolution DGPS topographic surface for Delya.  

For the CZ, cross sections were hand drawn for each drill line and flitches were then generated 
every 10 m vertical depth. These interpretations were then scanned and georeferenced into 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 134 

Seequent Leapfrog in order to create the 3D wireframes. The wireframes were generated in 
Seequent Leapfrog through selecting the geological intervals on vertical and horizontal sections 
and then using the vein-modelling tool to model these intercepts in 3D space. Intervals were 
assigned to veins based on the mineralised continuity seen on both vertical sections and 
horizontal flitches cut 10 m throughout the mineralised body. The vein meshes are snapped to 
the exact interval selections, which represent the exact mineralised intersection, within all forms 
of data including surface trenches, RC, and DD holes. The use of vein modelling in 3D allowed 
the wireframes to be smoothed between sections and to provide a more accurate 3D model, 
particularly where the mineralised body anastomoses, merges, and splits both horizontally and 
vertically.  

14.1.2. Massawa Northern Zone 

Massawa NZ1 is composed of a single discontinuous and bifurcating shear zone, with small 
discontinuous zones of mineralisation in the hanging wall and footwall (Figure 14-1) which are 
modelled as separate wireframe solids. 

In contrast, the Massawa NZ2 mineralised zone is primarily composed of a single linear 
continuous shear zone, as well as small discontinuous hanging wall and footwall mineralisation 
zones which are also wireframed as separate domains (Figure 14-2).

There is generally a sharp contact between the mineralised and waste material, with a strong 
correlation between the grade change and that of the alteration and structural deformation. This 
means that the mineralised wireframes are defined by geologically logged intersections. 

Visual data correlations confirm that a suitable geological related cut-off grade was approximately 
0.5 g/t Au in Massawa NZ resource wireframes. During interpretation, efforts were made to 
minimise the amount of sub-grade material included within each of the mineralised lode 
wireframes.  

14.1.3. Massawa Central Zone 

The CZ is defined by an envelope of altered rock containing 51, thin, NE trending, sub-vertical 
lodes. These mineralized lodes anastomose horizontally and vertically along strike, and are 
defined as the low-grade 0.5 g/t Au mineralisation envelopes (Figure 14-3). 

 

Figure 14-3 Surface Level Flitch at 175 m RL of Massawa Central Zone Mineralised Lode (Red) Low-Grade 
Wireframes Inside 2018 $1,500 Pit Shell 

Individual lodes are 1 m to 25 m thick, with an average thickness of between 6 m and 10 m. 
Visual data correlations confirm that a suitable geological related cut-off grade was approximately 
0.5 g/t Au for the low-grade Massawa CZ resource wireframes. During interpretation, efforts were 
made to minimise the amount of sub-grade material included within each of the mineralised lode 
wireframes.  

Within 41 of the low-grade wireframes the mineralisation is sub-domained into a high-grade 
wireframe of brecciated, extensional shear veins with moderate to strong silica-carbonate 
alteration and sulphides. The relationship with the low-grade mineralisation and lithology is 
outlined in Figure 14-4 and the distinct grade distributions in Figure 14-5.

Figure 14-5 Massawa Central Zone Low-Grade (Right) versus High-Grade (Left) Box and Whisker Uncut 
Grade Distribution Comparison 

The high-grade mineralisation contains 94% of the gold content, with coarse visible Au within the 
veins and Au inclusions within the arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite disseminations. These high-
grade domain wireframes have been modelled within 41 of the 51 low-grade envelopes along the 
entire strike length of the CZ as confirmed by the drilling and trenching. 

The contact between the low-grade and high-grade mineralisation domains is very sharp with a 
strong correlation between the grade change and vein plus brecciation and sulphide abundance, 
which means that the high-grade intersections can be defined by both the geological logging and 
the final assay values.  

14.1.4. Sofia  

Sofia Main is defined by a linear altered shear zone, where the mineralisation is thought to be 
structurally controlled. The majority of the high-grade mineralisation (above 2 g/t Au) is situated 
within a plunging tabular dilation zone that is modelled to terminate on the FW structure. There 
are also several small FW splays of mineralisation. Consequently, the Sofia Main mineralisation 
wireframe depth projection is cropped by the modelled structural intersection of the alteration 
envelope and the FW gabbro (Figure 14-6). 

Sectional interpretation correlations confirm that a suitable geological related cut-off grade was 
approximately 0.5 g/t Au for the Sofia Main resource wireframes (Figure 14-7). During 
interpretation, efforts were made to minimise the amount of sub-grade material included within 
each of the mineralised lode wireframes.

Sofia North consists of one main NNE-trending mineralized structure and discontinuous FW and 
HW lodes. The main mineralised structure that controls the alteration is developed at the eastern 
contact of the Western Mafics where the strike rotates from 040⁰ to 010⁰ and has been delineated 
over more than 2 km by trenching and RC drilling. This structure continues along strike from Sofia 
Main.  

The mineralised envelope contacts at Sofia are well defined by a strong correlation between 
grade and alteration intensity, meaning that the mineralisation intersections can be defined by 
both the geological logging as well as the assay values. 

14.1.5. Delya  

Delya is located along a major shear zone and can be defined by three steeply dipping, parallel 
zones of mineralisation, striking 030°, which are hosted in the lower margins of a series of 
gabbros within highly sheared and silicified sericitised schist. The mineralized zones are defined 
by an alteration assemblage of sericite-silica-carbonate and chlorite with fine disseminated pyrite 
and arsenopyrite. This altered unit contains higher grades (up to 5 g/t Au), and dips to the east 
at 85°. The other lodes are located to the west and have an average dip of 84° to the west (Figure 
14-8). 

Sectional interpretation correlations confirm that a suitable geological related cut-off grade was 
approximately 0.5 g/t Au for the Delya resource wireframes. During interpretation, efforts were 
made to minimise the amount of sub grade material included within each of the mineralised lode 
wireframes.  The wireframes are again checked against the hardcopy hand-drawn sections, and 
then cut to the 10 m resolution topographic surface, generated from the DGPS points.

14.1.6. Tina and Bambaraya  

The Tina and Bambaraya satellite deposits have been interpreted using a combination of grade, 
alteration, and sulphide logging in vertical cross sections. 

The distance between the sections is dependent upon the data spacing, typically 50 m to 100 m. 
The vertical section strings are snapped to the exact intersection within all forms of data including 
surface trenches, RC, and DD holes thereby ensuring that the points that define the wireframe 
intersect the drill hole or trench. Thereafter, the strings on each section are connected to form a 
3D triangulated solid. Where a mineralised zone terminates, the wireframe is projected along 
strike by 50% of the drill spacing up to a maximum of 25 m. These wireframes have been built 
using Micromine software. 

The wireframes are again checked against the hardcopy hand-drawn sections, and then cut to 
the 5 m resolution LIDAR topographic surface. 

14.2. Data Analysis and Domaining  

Since the Massawa and Sofia deposits have different drill spacing within different portions of the 
bodies, the wireframes are sub-domained by their relevant data spacing. This means that all 
geological and geostatistical domains are split into exploration and GC sub-domains. The 
application of this sub-domaining technique enables the application of different block sizes within 
each of the data density domains and the application of more localised estimation parameters 
within the GC domains relative to the exploration domains. This estimation methodology is 
applied throughout all other Barrick Mineral Resources in West Africa. 

The GC sub-domains are defined by a wireframe basal surface situated at the base of the GC 
drilled areas. This basal surface is used to split any domain wireframes intersected by it, to create 
exploration and GC sub-domains. 

All data spacing defined sub-domains use soft boundaries for the purposes of the Mineral 
Resource estimation, thus ensuring that their application within the resource model does not 
constrain the estimation from using sample support from an equivalent geological or statistical 
domain. Each data spacing sub-domain will only use its relevant search ellipse estimation 
constraints (size, number of samples, etc.), to take sample support from an equivalent geological 
or statistical domain. 

14.2.1. Massawa North Zone  

NZ1 is split into the following domains for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation: 

• 1103 = HWOZ  

• 1104 = FWOZ Folded 

• 1105 = FWOZ 

• 1106 = FWOZ South 

• 1107 = MOZ1 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 144 

• 1108 = MOZ2 

All drilling in NZ1 is either on an exploration or on a GC drill spacing. Thus, the NZ1 domains are 
sub-domained into exploration or GC domains based upon their sample data density.  

The NZ1 main zone wireframes are discontinuous and bifurcating in nature meaning that they 
have a similar nature to that of the HW and FW domains and the wireframes all intersect one 
another in places. Subsequently, a soft boundary is applied between data in all three domains 
for the purposes of resource estimation. Further support is provided for this by the fact that there 
are no differences in the grade distributions in the main domains relative to the HW and FW lodes.  

The resultant separate grade populations show a significant improvement in stationarity of 
domains relative to the original distribution for application during resource estimation (Figure 
14-9). 

 

Figure 14-9 North Zone 1 Mineralisation Zone Domain Grade Distribution Box and Whisker Uncut Grade 
Distribution Comparison  

NZ2 sample data is split into the following domains for the purposes of resource estimation: 

• 2101 = MOZ Domain 

• 2102 = FWOZ Domain 

• 2103 = HWOZ Domain 

• 2111 = MOZ HG Domain 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 145 

• 10 = Exploration Variable Domain 

• 11 = GC Variable Domain 

The resultant separate grade populations show a significant improvement in stationarity of 
domain relative to the original distribution for application during resource estimation (Figure 
14-10). 

Compared to NZ1, the distribution of sample grades within the NZ2 wireframes is bi-modal. 
Consequently, the main mineralised zone wireframe is sub-domained into a high-grade domain 
which separates the strongly bi-modal distribution into two or more single stationary geostatistical 
population with consistent major directions of mineralisation. The definition of the high-grade 
domain model was based upon the following characteristics: 

• 3% or more arsenopyrite sulphide mineralisation, 

• 2% of less pyrite sulphide mineralisation, 

• Arsenopyrite: pyrite ratio greater than 1.5,  

• Grades mostly greater than 8 g/t Au.

The final high-grade domain model represents 17% of the total NZ2 wireframe volume (Figure 
14-11).

(Left) and the Remainder of the Mineralised Wireframe - Low/Medium-Grade Domain (Right) 

There are still some indications of mixed population within the low/medium-grade domain – likely 
to be caused by small isolated high-grade pods. However, with the current drill density this cannot 
be spatially constrained. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 147 

Contact profile analysis between the high-grade domain and the surrounding main mineralised 
zone shows a sharp change in grade across the boundary (Figure 14-13). However, geological 
observations show that the change in sulphide concentrations can often be gradational. 
Consequently, a hard boundary was applied between the outer mineralisation wireframe and the 
inner high-grade domain.

2111 (Main Zone High-Grade Mineralisation) 

14.2.2. Massawa Central Zone 

Mineralisation in the individual lodes within the CZ is domained into: a low-grade, broader halo 
of weak to moderate shearing with silica-carbonate alteration and disseminated 
pyrite>>arsenopyrite and a high-grade zone of high strain including brecciation, extensional and 
shear veins with moderate to strong silica-carbonate alteration on sulphides.  Arsenopyrite is the 
dominant sulphide associated with gold; arsenopyrite and pyrite are also observed as vein 
selvedges +/- visible gold. The high-grade mineralisation contains 80% of the grade in the CZ1 
with coarse visible gold within the veins and gold inclusions within the arsenopyrite. As a direct 
consequence, the two domains have distinctly different grade distributions due to the sulphide 
assemblages and free gold occurrence within the vein system (Figure 14-14 and Figure 14-15).

Distribution Comparison 

Contact profile analysis between the high-grade proximal domain and the surrounding low-grade 
domain zone (Figure 14-16) shows a sharp boundary and change in grade at the edges of the 
high-grade system. Accordingly, the two domains are wireframed separately and are hard 
bounded from one another for resource estimation purposes, which prevents the very high-grade 
samples, within the high-grade distribution, from influencing the estimation within the low-grade 
domains.

Figure 14-16 Contact Analysis Plot of Central Zone Low-Grade Mineralisation (All Domains) and Central Zone 
High-Grade Mineralisation (All Domains) 

Each of the low-grade and high-grade lodes is effectively treated as its own separate domain 
which is hard bounded from other parallel lodes for the purpose of resource estimation. This is 
because the different lodes have distinctly different grade distributions (Figure 14-15).  

The difference in the grade distributions of the different lodes both within low-grade and high-
grade domains is controlled by the spatial association with the porphyritic intrusions as the 
brecciated contacts of the porphyry provide a rheological contrast, which focusses fluid flow and 
increases the abundance of mineralisation. 

CZ sample data is split into domains, which are in turn spatially grouped geologically and by 
grade distributions for the purposes of top cutting and resource estimation whereby the estimate 
allows each group to see one group across, but no more, thus keeping the estimate tightly 
restricted across strike data continuity associated with geological domains. The domain groups 
are: 

• 6101, 6102, 6103, 6104, 6105, 6110, 6120 and 6130 – Low-grade HW domains 

• 6210,6301, 6304 and 6305 – Low-grade HW/Central Bridge domains 

• 6410, 6411, 6420, 6434, 6436, 6441, 6443, 6444, 6450, 6470, 6471, 6472, 6473, 6474 
and 6480 – Low-grade Central domains 

• 6430, 6460, 6461, 6610, 6620, 6630, 6641 and 6641 – Low-grade Central/FW Bridge 
domains 

• 6440, 6490, 6502, 6710, 6711, 6712, 6713, 6621, 6631, 6640, 6650, 6660, 6670, 6671, 
6690 and 6691 – Low-grade FW domains 

• 7101, 7102, 7104, 7110 and 7120 – High-grade HW domains 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 150 

• 7210, 7304 and 7305 High-grade HW/Central Bridge domains 

• 7410, 7420, 7434, 7441, 7443, 7444, 7450, 7470, 7471, 7472, 7473 and 7480 – High-

• 7430, 7460, 7501, 7610, 7630 – High-grade Central/FW domains

7711 – High-grade FW domains 

These domains are then further sub-domained into exploration or GC domains based upon their 
sample data density (Figure 14-17).

Note: Green domains are low-grade hanging wall, yellow domains are the low-grade hanging wall/central bridge domains, red are

Testwork completed to date has indicated that historic half core diamond drill core data analysed 
with 50 g fire assay will underestimate the gold content relative to larger samples with bulk 
analysis methods. This data is currently used as part of the estimation dataset within the inferred 
portions of the CZ Mineral Resource only. 

14.2.3. Sofia 

Sofia is split into the following domains for Mineral Resource estimation purposes: 

• 6000 = Sofia Main MOZ 
• 6100 = Sofia Main FWOZ 
• 6200 = Sofia Main HWOZ 
• 6300 = Sofia Main MOZ North Extension 
• 6400 = Sofia North FWOZ 
• 6500 = Sofia North MOZ 
• 6600 = Sofia North HWOZ 
• 6700 = Sofia North HW Vein 
• 6900 = Sofia North HWOZ1 

The HW and FW mineralisation zones intersect the main mineralisation zone in Sofia Main and 
Sofia North. Subsequently, a soft boundary is applied between data in all three domains for the 
purposes of resource estimation. This is further supported by the fact that there are no differences 
in the grade distributions in the MOZ relative to the HWOZ and FWOZ.

Contact profile analysis between the mineralised domains and the surrounding main mineralised 
zone shows minimal to no change in grade across the boundaries of the HW and FW 
mineralisation zones. These domains also intersect the main mineralisation zones in Sofia Main. 
Subsequently, a soft boundary is applied for data between domains 6000, 6100, and 6200 and a 
hard boundary for domains 6000 and 6300 for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation 
(Figure 14-20). This is further supported by the fact that there are minimal differences in the grade 
distributions in the MOZ relative to the HWOZ and FWOZ.

There are still some indications of mixed population within the low/medium-grade domain – likely 
to be caused by small isolated high-grade pods. However, with the current drill density this cannot 
be spatially constrained. 

Contact profile analysis (Figure 14-21) between the mineralised domains shows a gradational to 
no change in grade across the boundary. However, geological observations show that the change 
in mineralisation and alteration styles is distinct and, consequently, a hard boundary was applied 
between the mineralisation wireframes.

14.3. Compositing 

Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources have been assessed independently to optimise 
the most appropriate compositing length, by checking the impact of the composite length on the 
mean, coefficient of variation, and skewness of the resultant composite distribution relative to 
that of the original sample distribution. Additional consideration is given to the relevant domain 
true widths and the average raw sample length.  

All drill holes are effectively composited using estimation domain wireframes as boundaries to 
the compositing process, thereby ensuring that the resultant composites respect the modelled 
boundaries between any estimation domains, e.g. NZ main mineralisation wireframe and internal 
high-grade domain. 

Massawa CZ trench and DD samples, as well as Massawa NZ, Sofia, and Delya Mineral 
Resource estimation sample datasets were composited to one metre composites within their 
respective estimation domain wireframes with a tolerance of 0.5 m. This results in a maximum 
composite size of 1.5 m and a minimum composite size of 0.5 m, however, over 95% of the 
composites are equal to 1.0 m. Any residual composites with a length below 0.5 m were excluded 
from the final estimation dataset.  

Massawa CZ RC samples used in the Mineral Resource estimation sample datasets were taken 
on one metre intervals, therefore the samples were flagged within their respective estimation 
domain wireframes, giving one-metre composites.  

A summary of the residuals removed from all datasets is outlined in Table 14-3. The total number 
of ignored data represents less than 0.02% of the total estimation dataset thereby ensuring that 
the effective exclusion of these residuals does not bias the grade distribution within the remaining 
dataset. This compositing methodology, and the flagging for Massawa RC samples, is considered 
to be the most appropriate approach, as it ensures that the resultant composite datasets comprise 
homogenous sample weights.

14.4. Top Cutting and Grade Restrictions 

Top cutting is determined using a multifactor analysis, whereby an appropriate top cut is 
assessed utilising individual methods of analysis including raw composite percentile 
disintegration, analysis of the grade distribution, and log probability plots. Generally, the chosen 
top cutting value is expected to occur between the 95th and 99.9th percentiles. Subsequently, the 
final top cutting value is chosen taking into consideration the results of each of the methods of 
analysis.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 157 

Prior to applying the final top cutting value, all data points with results at or above the selected 
top cut value are spatially reviewed to determine if the sample points are spatially spread out 
illustrating typical outlier characteristics and cannot be domained as discrete high-grade zone 
with a separate distribution. If they are spatially associated with one another, then the application 
of a separate high-grade domain is tested and the top cutting assessments are repeated on each 
of the new domains. 

14.4.1. North Zone 

NZ sample grade distributions were assessed using conventional multifactor analysis methods. 
The grade distributions for NZ1 domains were grouped for the purposes of top cut optimisation. 
The grade distributions for NZ2 were also grouped for the purposes of top cut optimisation but 
split by domains with similar grade distributions.  

The resultant grade distribution for NZ1 domain 1103 indicated that samples over 13 g/t Au did 
not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier characteristics as they were 
spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As such, 13 g/t Au was chosen as 
the appropriate top cutting value and a total of three samples were top cut between 13.5 g/t Au 
and 26.10 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 10% from 1.66 g/t Au to 1.62 
g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 1.45 to 1.3.  

The resultant grade distribution for NZ1 domain 1104 indicated that samples over 27 g/t Au did 
not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier characteristics as they were 
spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As such, 27 g/t Au was chosen as 
the appropriate top cutting value and a total of 11 samples were top cut between 26.5 g/t Au and 
59.2 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 14% from 3.43 g/t Au to 3.22 g/t Au 
and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 1.86 to 1.6.  

The resultant grade distribution for NZ1 domain 1105, 1106, 1107, and 1108 indicated that 
samples over 21 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier 
characteristics as they were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As 
such, 21 g/t Au was chosen as the appropriate top cutting value and a total of 20 samples were 
top-cut between 21 g/t Au and 41.17 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 9% 
from 2.8 g/t Au to 2.73 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 1.49 
to 1.36.  

Log histograms and log probability plots showing the overall grade distributions for the NZ 
domains are shown in Figure 14-23 to Figure 14-25. 

An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all samples over 12 g/t Au 
in domain 1104 and above 21 g/t Au in domains 1105, 1106, 1107, and 1108 where partial 
disintegration point exists within the top 3% to 4% of the total high-grade sample population. This 
search restriction represents 50% of the total variogram range for their respective domains.

The resultant grade distribution for NZ2 domain 2111 (high-grade) indicated that samples over 
65 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier characteristics as 
they were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As such, 65 g/t Au was 
chosen as the appropriate top cutting value and a total of eight samples were top-cut between 
65 g/t Au and 76 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 3% from 10.88 g/t Au 
to 10.86 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 0.88 to 0.87.  

The resultant grade distribution for NZ2 domains 2101 and 2103 indicated that samples over 39 
g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier characteristics as they 
were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As such, 39 g/t Au was 
chosen as the appropriate top cutting value and a total of six samples were top-cut between 
39 g/t Au and 85 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 0.93% from 3.22 g/t Au 
to 3.19 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 1.63 to 1.55.  

The resultant grade distribution for the low-grade and poorly sampled NZ2 domain 2102 indicated 
that samples over 7 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier 
characteristics as they were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As 
such, 7 g/t Au was chosen as the appropriate top cutting value and a total of five samples were 
top-cut between 7 g/t Au and 17.58 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 9% 
from 1.41 g/t Au to 1.27 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 1.7 
to 1.3.  

Log histograms and log probability plots showing the overall grade distributions for the NZ1 
domains are shown in Figure 14-26 to Figure 14-28.  

An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all samples over 48 g/t Au 
in domain 2111 and above 21 g/t Au in domains 2101, 2102, 2103, 1105, 1106, 1107, and 1108 
where partial disintegration point exists within the top 3% to 4% of the total high-grade sample 
population. This search restriction represents 50% of the total variogram range for their 
respective domains.

14.4.2. Central Zone 

All CZ GC samples top cutting optimisations were restricted to RC drill data with bulk sample 
LeachWELL plus tail assay determination. As outlined in Section 11, due to the presence of 
nuggety gold in the Massawa CZ, bulk one-kilogram LeachWELL samples provide not only more 
representative quantification of gold content but also greater levels of repeatability (>85%) 
relative to 50 g FA data. In addition, top cutting was optimised with bulk sample LeachWELL plus 
FA data to ensure that the assessment of what is considered as an outlier from the main grade 
distribution was not biased or skewed by the known negative bias of sample grades within the 
smaller volume diamond drill data with 50 g FA. CZ top cutting outside the RC GC area, with no 
bulk sample LeachWELL data, included smaller volume DD data with the 50 g FA. 

Due to the separate grade distributions of CZ mineralisation, the domains were grouped for top 
cutting based on similarities in grade distributions (Figure 14-29 and Figure 14-30). Domains in 
each top cutting group domain are outlined in Table 14-4.

Low Grade 

Grade distributions in the CZ low-grade domains (top cutting group 1) were assessed using 
conventional multifactor analysis methods. Grade distributions were assessed both 
independently for each of the mineralised zones and also as grouped domains to compare the 
results of the top cut evaluations (Table 14-5).

An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all low-grade samples above 
28 g/t Au within the GC domains, where the search ellipse is restricted to 33% of the total 
variogram range (21 m), which is almost equal to the range of the third structure.  

Within the wider spaced exploration domains, the search ellipse for estimation of all samples 
above 11 g/t Au is restricted to 66% of the total variogram range (42 m), which is almost equal to 
the range of the second structure. The search ellipse restriction is reduced in the exploration 
domains relative to the GC domains, due to the wider spacing of the drill sample data. 

This combination of a restricted search and extreme outlier top cutting is considered to be the 
most appropriate method for estimation within a nuggety gold system, as it retains the areas of 
local very high-grade material but restricts their influence whilst also top cutting the actual outliers. 
The resultant impact on the contained metal ounces is the same as the impact from applying a 
straight top cut.  

High Grade  

The grade distributions were assessed both independently for each mineralised zone and then 
grouped to compare the results of the top cut evaluations. Due to the partial coverage of the RC 
data with bulk LeachWELL assay determination, some lodes were under sampled with respect 
to others and as such the grouped distribution was used to determine the relevant top cut.  

Due to the nuggety nature of the high-grade (proximal) domains, the range of potential top cuts 
established using conventional multifactor analysis methods varied significantly (by >200%). 
Accordingly, it was necessary to run an additional 'metal at risk' simulation which has been 
utilised at other nugget vein gold mine operations. The metal at risk simulation was run on all 15 
m by 10 m AdvGC RC drilling analysed using bulk LeachWELL analysis. The simulation was 
restricted to a tight estimation data analysis envelope area that is restricted to half the drill spacing 
away from the last GC grid intersection.  

The simulation starts by using the lowest (harshest) 'possible top cut' that has been established 
from conventional multifactor analysis (histogram, log probability, disintegration etc.). Using this 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 164 

'possible top cut', the 'top cut metal content' and simulated high-grade metal distribution are 
calculated. From the simulated high-grade metal distribution, the 'target metal content' is 
calculated using 20% percentile (Figure 14-31). 

 

Figure 14-31 Metal at Risk Simulation Grade Distribution Algorithm Graphical Representation 

The simulation tests if the 'top cut metal content' is greater than 'target metal content' and if it is, 
the risk of over estimation is considered to be too significant. The simulation process is repeated 
using different 'possible top cuts' until the 'cut metal content' is equal to 'target metal content'. 
The simulation 'target metal content' is calculated using 20% percentile of the simulated high-
grade metal distribution – such that a minimum of 80% of the mine production will achieve or 
exceed the predicted grade of the model assuming no other modifying factors. Approximately 
20% of the mine production will achieve or fall below the predicted grade of the model assuming 
no other modifying factors. The simulation runs 5,000 'realisations' for each given production 
rates. A number of production rates were tested, however, taking into consideration the current 
mine schedule, the 1.2 Mtpa simulation (average CZ feed over the LOM) where a maximum of 
40% (480 kt) of the production tonnes would be from high-grade domains was selected. The 
results of these simulations are tabulated in Table 14-6 for each top cutting domain individually 
within the CZ except for domains 2 and 3 which were combined due to comparable grade 
distributions and variability plus geological setting. Selection of the final top cutting value took 
into consideration both results of the metal at risk simulation together with other methods (Table 
14-6). Additional restricted estimation search ellipse radii were applied at approximately the 99% 
percentile to reduce the spatial influence of the upper most portion of the high-grade distribution 
tail.

14.4.1. Sofia 

Sofia sample grade distributions were assessed using conventional multifactor analysis methods. 
The grade distributions for Sofia Main domains were grouped for the purposes of top cut 
optimisation. The grade distributions for Sofia North were split by geological domains with similar 
grade distributions for the purposes of top cut optimisation.  

The resultant grade distribution for Sofia Main indicated that samples over 25 g/t Au did not fit 
the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier characteristics as they were spatially 
spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As such, 25 g/t Au was chosen as the 
appropriate top cutting value, and a total of 237 samples were top-cut between 27.79 g/t Au and 
122.92 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 9% from 2.88 g/t Au to 2.63 g/t 
Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 2.16 to 1.44. The resultant grade 
distribution and log probability curve are shown in Figure 14-32.    

 

Figure 14-32 Massawa Sofia Main Log Histogram and Log Probability Plot of 1 m Composite with 0.5 m 
Merge Estimation Data Situated Within Mineralisation Wireframes 

The resultant grade distribution for Sofia North was divided into domains with similar grade 
distributions. The grade distributions for domains 6500, 6700, and 6900 over 16 g/t Au and for 
domains 6400 and 6600 over 7 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical 
outlier characteristics as they were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. 
As such, for domains 6500, 6700, and 6900, 16 g/t Au was chosen as the appropriate top cutting 
value and a total of nine samples were top-cut between 16.68 g/t Au and 90.47 g/t Au. Top cutting 
reduced the average mean grade by 2% from 1.84 g/t Au to 1.79 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 166 

of the coefficient of variation from 1.45 to 1.3. In total, the length weighted metal reduction impact 
of the top cut is also 2%. The resultant grade distribution and log probability curve are shown in 
Figure 14-33.

For domains 6400 and 6600, 7 g/t Au was chosen as the appropriate top cut, and a total of 17 
samples were removed between 7.51 g/t Au and 22.5 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average 
mean grade by 8.13% from 1.04 g/t Au to 0.97 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient 
of variation from 1.81 to 1.37. The resultant grade distribution and log probability curve are show 
in Figure 14-34.

An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all samples over 17 g/t Au 
in Sofia Main and above 13 g/t Au in Sofia North domains 6500, 6700, and 6900, where a partial 
disintegration point exists within the top 3% to 4% of the total high-grade sample population. This 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 167 

search restriction represents 50% of the total variogram range for Sofia Main or the ranges of the 
range of variogram structure for Sofia North.  

14.4.2. Delya 

Delya sample grade distributions were assessed using conventional multifactor analysis 
methods. The grade distributions for Delya domains 6200 and 6300 were grouped for the 
purposes of top cut optimisation.  

The resultant grade distribution (Figure 14-35) for Delya domain 6000 (MOZ) indicated that 
samples over 22 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution and displayed typical outlier 
characteristics as they were spatially spread along the strike of the mineralised wireframe. As 
such, 22 g/t Au was chosen as the appropriate top cutting value and a total of 11 samples were 
top-cut between 22.3 g/t Au and 31.50 g/t Au. Top cutting reduced the average mean grade by 
9% from 4.29 g/t Au to 4.25 g/t Au and resulted in a reduction of the coefficient of variation from 
1.16 to 1.15. In total, the length weighted metal reduction impact of the top cut is also 2.3%. The 
grade distribution for combined Delya domains 6100 and 6200 (Figure 14-36) indicated that 
samples over 8.5 g/t Au did not fit the main sample distribution. As such 8.5 g/t Au was selected 
as the appropriate top cut value and a total of five samples were top-cut.

An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all samples over 16 g/t Au 
in Delya domain 6000, where partial disintegration point exists within the top 3% to 4% of the 
total high-grade sample population. This search restriction represents 100% of the total 
variogram range for this domain. 

14.5. Massawa, Sofia and Delya Estimation Dataset Declustering  

The sample data in Sofia Main and Sofia North are not heavily clustered as the drilling is fairly 
evenly spaced and there are no areas of GC drilling. Subsequently, it was decided that no 
declustering correction was required.  

The sample data in NZ, CZ, and Delya zones are heavily clustered in areas due to influence of 
GC drilling. Subsequently, a cell weighting declustering correction was applied to the domain to 
effectively account for the clustering of data within geostatistical analysis and variography. The 
cell weighting declustering technique applied used a linked Y and Z axis to effectively increase 
the accuracy of the declustering cell size selection. 

Declustering correction is used within geostatistical analysis only and is not applied to estimation 
values because kriging will decluster the data. The final declustering cell size selections are 
detailed in Table 14-7, Table 14-8, and Table 14-9.

14.6. Variography 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted by Randgold using Snowden Supervisor 
statistical software and all modelling and estimation was completed in Maptek Vulcan. 
Variography was completed using Snowden Supervisor v8; to analyse the spatial continuity and 
relation within each of the main domains to determine appropriate search strategy and estimation 
inputs. The variogram modelling process followed involved the following steps:  

• A normal score transform was applied to all data prior to undertaking variography on the 
top cut, declustered composite dataset, where declustering was appropriate. 

• Both the omni-directional and down hole variogram are initially modelled to characterise 
the nugget effect. 

• Orientated variogram directions are modelled in three dimensions and verified with the 
known geological or structural controls to mineralisation to identify the plane of greatest 
continuity. 

• Variogram fans within the plane of greatest continuity are modelled for each structure to 
identify the direction of maximum continuity within this plane.  

• Experimental variograms are modelled in the direction of maximum continuity and the 
orthogonal directions. 

• A back transform to all independent structure experimental variogram models was applied 
to obtain the appropriate nested variogram models for interpolation of raw composite data. 

Prior to completing the final estimation, each semi-variogram model is cross validated to ensure 
that there is no or minimal bias in estimated grade relative to the actual sample grade. This was 
completed by plotting the resultant estimated grades from the first pass compared to the actual 
sample grade, to evaluate the resultant estimation for possible trends. In exploration data spaced 
sub-domains, there is level of smoothing in estimated grade compared to actual sample grade, 
but the overall estimated grade is checked to ensure that it is within 5% of the original sample 
grade and that there is no evidence of conditional bias.  

The search strategy used was based on the modelled variogram ranges considering that in 
nugget shear hosted Au systems the full variogram range is often artificially extended for the last 
3% to 5% of variability. Additionally, the estimation search strategy takes into consideration the 
data distribution for both the geological and data spacing sub-domains.  

14.6.1. Massawa North Zone 

Only one variogram model was constructed for NZ1, as there are no differences in the grade 
distributions in the MOZ relative to the HW and FW zones and, due to their bifurcating nature, 
the wireframes all intersect one another. Subsequently, a soft boundary was applied between 
data in all three domains for the purposes of resource estimation. The variogram model 
parameters as defined are included in Table 14-10.

Separate variogram models were constructed for NZ2 MOZ and the internal high-grade domain, 
as a function of the significant differences of the grade distributions and continuity within each of 
the two domains. Consequently, the high-grade domain variogram models exhibited shorter 
ranges of continuity relative to that of the MOZ domain (Table 14-11 and Table 14-12). This also 
supports the application of a smaller/restricted search ellipse within the high-grade domain.  

The MOZ variogram model was applied to all HW and FW domains due to minimal difference in 
the grade distributions and continuity. Furthermore, the HW and FW wireframes do not contain 
enough data to form independent statistically valid domains due to their limited size and 
discontinuous nature. Accordingly, a soft boundary was applied between data in all three domains 
for the purposes of resource estimation.

14.6.2. Massawa Central Zone 

Separate variogram models were constructed for low-grade and high-grade mineralisation 
domains, as a function of the significantly different grade distributions and continuity ranges within 
each of the two domains.  

A singular variogram model was applied to all top cutting group 1 domains (Table 14-13) due the 
fact that some of the modelled structures do not contain enough RC drill data.  

Similarly, singular variogram models were created for top cutting groups 2, 3, and 4; however, 
top cutting groups 2 and 3 were combined to use the same variogram due to similar grade

distributions (Table 14-14), where the individual variograms had almost identical nugget, 
modelled structure ranges, and directions. Top cutting group 4 (Table 14-15) was modelled 
separately as high-grade domains. The resultant variogram models were re-orientated where 
appropriate to fit the slight variations in strike and dip of each mineralised domain.

14.7. Bulk Density 

Bulk density values were measured by applying the Archimedean principles (density = weight (in 
air) ÷ (weight (in air) – weight (in water)). All results are grouped by weathering profile and 
lithology. The density measurement procedure differed slightly for saprolite, transition, and fresh 
material: 

• Saprolitic density measurements were primarily obtained from trenches, although some 
drill hole core was used. For trench samples, cubes of approximately 25 cm by 25 cm by 
25 cm were excavated and the insitu weight measured to estimate the moisture content. 
The sample is then dried out and wrapped in a waterproof membrane. 

• Fresh and transition density measurements were primarily obtained from drill core. The 
procedure followed involved the selection of 10 cm to 15 cm pieces using the water 
immersion method. 

Once the dry sample weight has been measured using a Mettler 3000 electronic balance, the 
saprolite samples are weighed in water using the lower hook of the balance. 

All density data distributions were checked to remove both lower and upper outliers before the 
mean density value was calculated for each lithology split into weathering groups (Table 14-19, 
Table 14-20, and Table 14-21).

Density values are hard coded into all block models based on the lithology and weathering. 
Where density data does not exist in inferred satellite resources (Inferred resources only), the 
density has been inferred from the nearest deposit on the same shear zone with the same 
weathering and lithology combination. 

14.8. Block Models 

All Mineral Resource block model limits are set such that the block model covers the entire 
Mineral Resource plus a 150 m to 300 m buffer radius, to ensure that any pit optimisation is not 
limited by the extent of the waste blocks within the model.  

Consequently, the NZ block model does overlap with the model extents of the CZ. None of the 
blocks in the CZ portion of the NZ block models contain any grades and are only flagged by 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 174 

connecting waste lithologies. The two block models have remained as separate files due to the 
different timing of updates and to limit the resultant file size of the block models.  

All Massawa and Sofia Mineral Resource block models are sub-cell block models which enable 
accurate definition of geological and domained contacts. 

A different block size was applied to the GC domains relative to the exploration domains. 
Subsequently, using a smaller GC sub-domain block size enables the resource model to be 
estimated through application of a more localised estimation in areas of GC drilling with a high 
sample density. The block sizes used within both GC and exploration areas are intended to reflect 
the average drill hole spacing in both scenarios. The exploration sub-domain block size is 
required to be an exact multiple of GC block size by Maptek Vulcan software, in order to use 
multiple block sizes within the resource model. 

To ensure that all selected block sizes and sub-cell sizes provide an accurate representation of 
the mineralisation wireframes, the respective block volumes are validated against the original 
wireframe volumes to ensure that the variance is less than or equal to 1%. The 2.5% decrease 
in block model volume relative to the wireframe volume is a result of the narrow and 
anastomosing nature of the wireframes relative to the minimum appropriate block size (Table 
14-22).

Block sizes are optimised utilising Qualitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA). This 
optimisation process is repeated for each sub-domain (exploration and GC splits), to ensure that 
the optimisation best reflects the relevant sample spacing. Additional factors including the true 
width of the respective mineralised wireframes and potential selectivity during mining are taken 
into consideration when selecting an appropriate block size considering the geology and 
domaining used.  

Block sizes within the Massawa NZ block model are specified in Table 14-23. A block size limit 
has been applied for GC domains – which physically limits the parent cell size of the blocks within 
the GC areas.

Due to the complex thin anastomosing shape of the high-grade wireframes, the CZ block model 
has been built entirely based upon the GC block size to achieve a close volume reconciliation 
between the block model and wireframes. Consequently, the exploration sub-domains use a 
parent cell size that is exactly double that of the GC block size, meaning that the estimation will 
assign the grades into groups of eight blocks when writing estimated grades to represent parent 
cell estimation (Table 14-24).

Similarly, in the Sofia block model, the thin anastomosing wireframe shapes in Sofia Main dictate 
that the entire block model be built entirely based upon the GC block size to achieve a close 
volume reconciliation between the block model and wireframes. Consequently, the Sofia North 
sub-domains use a parent cell size that is exactly double that of the GC block size in strike length 
(Y axis) to account for the wider spacing along strike (Table 14-25). This means that the 
estimation will estimate a single grade into the groups of two blocks when writing estimated 
grades, representative of the parent cell size.

14.9. Resource Estimation 

14.9.1. Massawa, Sofia and Delya 

All Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources are estimated using an Ordinary Kriging (OK) 
estimation methodology and apply parent cell estimation for the relevant GC or exploration parent 
cell size, thereby ensuring that sub-cells are effectively grouped to provide sufficient sample 
support per estimated block. 

QKNA was utilised to determine the optimal block size, minimum number of samples, search 
radius, and block discretization for each pass, by evaluating the kriging efficiency (KE) and slope 
of regression (SR) across multiple block centroid locations to ensure that the selected parameters 
are robust and appropriate for different areas within the relevant domain.  

All Massawa CZ search radii, number of samples used, and QKNA estimation parameter 
optimisations were restricted to RC drill data with bulk sample LeachWELL (plus tail assay) 
determination in order to ensure that the respective grade distributions and continuity were not 
skewed by the known negative bias of sample grades within the smaller volume DD. Block size 
optimisations were performed to take into account the mining SMUs. 

The estimation search strategies for Sofia, Massawa NZ, and Delya were tested using QKNA 
based on the modelled variogram ranges taking into account that in nugget shear hosted gold 
systems the full variogram range is often artificially extended for the last 3% to 5% of variability. 
Additionally, the estimation search strategy takes into consideration the data distribution for both 
the geological and the data spacing sub-domains. Examples of the QKNA results for Sofia Main 
optimisation are shown in Figure 14-37 to Figure 14-40. The resultant search ellipsoid 
orientations are verified visually against the domain wireframe and, where appropriate, the search 
ellipse and associated variogram directions are locally re-orientated to reflect bifurcation and local 
changes in the strike and dip of the mineralisation wireframes.  

In 2018, dynamic anisotropy (DA) was introduced to the Massawa CZ deposit to better reflect the 
anastomosing nature of the mineralisation and local changes in orientation across the deposit 
(Figure 14-41). Reference surfaces are generated automatically in Leapfrog geo-modelling 
software vein modelling tool for each domain using the centre point of the drill hole intercept. 
These reference surfaces are then flagged to the empty block models by providing a reference 
azimuth to provide the strike, dip, and plunge for interpolation.

All Mineral Resources use multi-pass estimation searches, in order to estimate all blocks, 
whereby each pass uses a varying degree of restrictions before any given block can be 
estimated. Accordingly, the Mineral Resource classification is adjusted per the search pass 
during which the blocks from an area were estimated. Estimation search pass parameters for 
Massawa NZ, CZ, Sofia, and Delya are shown in Table 14-27 to Table 14-32.

Estimation Method All Kriging Kriging Kriging or IVD 

Classification of the blocks was carried out by displaying the estimated blocks (Pass No, SR, and 
KE) on vertical cross sections and generating a wireframe basal surface for Measured, Indicated, 
and Inferred. All block models were then re-blocked to the relevant classification surfaces to 
ensure accurate representation within the sub-cell model.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 185 

Drill densities in CZ and NZ Mineral Resources have been optimised from specific drill spacing 
studies. For Indicated Mineral Resources, there are some allowances for areas where drilling 
density is lower but successive drilling campaigns have shown that there is grade and geological 
continuity. 

Tina and Bambaraya are both classified as Inferred Mineral Resources as they have been 
estimated with inverse distance squared using the resource classification criteria shown in Table 
14-33.  

There are also areas that, although not part of declared Mineral Resources, show geological 
continuity within the current exploration regions. These areas are considered to be potential 
exploration targets which will be followed up and evaluated in future exploration programmes.  

14.11. Resource Model Validation 

Once the block model has been classified, the following procedure were undertaken to check the 
block models and estimated grades which can be used to indicate any major errors during the 
estimation process as well as testing the precision, accuracy, and any bias of the estimated 
grade: 

i. A volume reconciliation between the block model estimation domains and related 
wireframes is undertaken. 

ii. All models are visually checked against the composite data on both cross section and 
long section basis, to validate the estimation and ensure that estimated grades and metal 
show no clear bias or trends that would not be expected from the variography or 
estimation domaining.  

iii. A check of the number of the blocks estimated using the negative kriging weight is 
completed. Any blocks estimated using negative kriging weight have been reset to the 
anisotropic nearest block grade of the closest sample. 

iv. A comparison between the data minimum, maximum, mean, and the estimated grade at 
0 g/t Au cut off for each of the domains (within the open pit or underground reporting 
areas) is created. This is completed to check for possible over or under estimation.  

v. Swath plots are created for each geological domain to validate the estimated grade 
variability compared to the composite along X, Y, and Z axes. This is to check that the 
model estimate follows the trends seen in the data and that there is no general bias with 
over or under estimation. Areas with less data support are also highlighted for further 
drilling and geological work.  

The swath plots for Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources show that the correlation 
between the estimation and the source data is acceptable and that conditional bias is minimised. 
Example swath plots for Massawa NZ2 Y axis (northing) Mineral Resources are shown in Figure 
14-42 and Figure 14-43. Swath plots for Sofia Y axis (northing) are shown in Figure 14-44 and 
Figure 14-45 and Delya in Figure 14-46. CZ high-grade and low-grade swath plots are presented 
in Figure 14-47 and Figure 14-48, respectively. 

The swath plot analysis does, however, highlight a significant increase in estimation smoothing 
within the exploration sub-domains relative to the GC sub-domains. This is considered 
acceptable and is a function of the wider data density and the fact that the estimations in the 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 186 

exploration sub-domains use samples from a much wider search area relative to the more local 
GC sub-domains.   

As part of the optimisation study a pilot plant scale test is planned for the CZ Mineral Resource, 
which will provide a source of reconciliation data to test against the GC blocks estimated within 
the Mineral Resource. 

No external audit has been undertaken on the Massawa Mineral Resource models, however, the 
general procedures used to generate the Mineral Resources are common across Barrick Africa 
and Middle East operations which are externally audited on three-year cycles. The QP for the 
Mineral Resource (Mr Simon Bottoms) is the QP for all Barrick Africa and Middle East operations 
and has ensured the Massawa Mineral Resources.

defined.  

14.13. Massawa Gold Project Mineral Resource Summary by 
Deposit 

The Massawa Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared according to the Australasian Code 
for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves standards and 
guidelines published and maintained by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of 
Australia (the JORC (2012) Code). Barrick has reconciled the Mineral Resources to Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves dated 10th May 2014 as incorporated in NI 43-101, and there are no 
material differences. 

The Massawa Gold Project Mineral Resources are listed in Table 14-39 with the open pit 
resources declared at an average cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t Au, within a $1,500/oz pit shell. The NZ 
Underground resources are estimated below the $1,500 pit at a 2.50 g/t Au cut-off grade. 

The Massawa Gold Project total Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated to be 23 Mt at 4.00 
g/t Au for 3.0 Moz on a total basis with an additional Inferred Mineral Resource of 6.3 Mt at 3.0 
g/t Au for 0.61 Moz.

Barrick is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource 
estimate.

15. Ore Reserve Estimate 

15.1. Ore Reserve Summary 

The Massawa Ore Reserves have been estimated in accordance with the JORC (2012) Code. 
Barrick has reconciled the Ore Reserve to CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves dated 10th May 2014 as incorporated in NI 43-101, and there are no material 
differences. 

Only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources have been used for the conversion to Ore 
Reserves and thus the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya deposits have been incorporated into 
reserves. Tina, Bambaraya, and Massawa North Zone Underground only contain Inferred 
Resources and, therefore, have not been converted to Ore Reserves. 

The 2018 Ore Reserve estimate includes an open pit (OP) Probable Ore Reserve of 7.1 Mt at 
4.69 g/t Au for 1.1 Moz Au from the Massawa CZ; 4.6 Mt at 4.89 g/t Au for 0.72 Moz Au from the 
Massawa NZ; 5.7 Mt at 2.91 g/t Au for 0.54 Moz Au for Sofia; and 0.66 Mt at 4.40 g/t Au for 0.092 
Moz for Delya. The OP Ore Reserves are those reserves occurring within a $1,000/oz pit design. 

Total Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Ore Reserve estimates, as of 31st December 2018, are 
presented in Table 15-1 and a reserve reconciliation, due to model revisions, is detailed in Table 
15-2.

15.1.1. Dilution 

The mining dilution was assumed to be 10% of additional waste for each tonne of ore in Massawa 
NZ, Sofia, and Delya Main and 36% in Massawa CZ. The CZ dilution and ore loss applied are 
based on a dilution study carried out by Maptek taking into account the very narrow nature of the 
CZ ore body. The 10% figure is based on experience with similar steep tabular ore bodies at 
Barrick's Loulo operation. 

Ore loss was set at 3% for NZ, Sofia, and Delya and 8% for CZ, which is also based on historical 
information from nearby operations with similar geology. 

15.1.2. Grade Control Optimiser Study  

Grade Control Optimiser (GCO) work was conducted for Randgold by Maptek consultants. The 
ultimate aim was to produce 'mineable' solids, with an assumed Standard Mining Unit (SMU) size 
of 4.5 m. Blocks are flagged with their preferred destination based on cost and revenue of 
processing individual block model blocks as well as any restriction on destination. These block 
model blocks are grouped together up to the chosen SMU size. If it is not possible to send a block 
to its preferred destination, it is grouped with other blocks in such a way as to minimise the cost 
of sending it to the wrong destination. 

The results were flagged into another block model variable which recorded whether a block would 
be sent to an ore or waste destination. This variable was grade shelled to produce final solids of 
the mineable ore (Figure 15-1). 

 

Figure 15-1 Final Grade Control Optimiser Solids 

15.1.3. Grade Control Optimiser Method 

The starting point of the GCO was a regularised block model. The block model that was used for 
this was 'MAS_CZ_SEP_18_TOTAL_MODEL_GC_BLOCK_AU_ONLY.bmf'.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 203 

Gold processing recovery was calculated into the original model as opposed to being calculated 
as a temporary variable in the GCO script. The script was updated to account for this. Three 
scripts were run on the original sub-blocked model before it was regularised. 

• 01_lithox18_calc_2018.bcf – script to calculate the 'lithox18' variable code based on the 
group, oxidation, and redox variables. 

• 02_rec_calc_2018.bcf – script to calculate metallurgical recovery as a decimal 
percentage based on geometallurgical recovery domain (metdom18), group, oxidation, 
and redox. 

• 03_contained_met_calc_2018.bcf – script to calculate the gold mass in grams in a block 
and the recovered gold grams in each block when taking into account processing 
recovery. 

The original aim, based on experience from the previous work, was to regularise and run the 
GCO process on a 0.5 m regular model. It was believed that this would best honour the original 
data from the sub-blocked model. Reducing the block size increases the number of blocks and 
corresponding processing time but gives better definition of the ore zone. 

Attempts were made to run the GCO using several machines, including tests using two super-
computers in the United Kingdom, but it was ultimately found to be impractical to run the GCO 
on a 0.5 m sized regular model with the lack of block restriction. It was decided to use a 0.75 m 
regularised model to estimate the 4.5 m SMU. The Z height of the blocks was made 2.5 m to 
match the proposed flitch height. 

The block model was run on the scripts described above and the model was regularised to 0.75 
m by Randgold, then provided as the block model 'MAS_SEP18_SMU_0_75m_2_5m.bmf', on 
which further scripts were conducted. These two scripts were: 

• 00_add_variables_to_model.csh – script to add in the requisite variables to run the GCO 
costing script 04. 

• 04_GCO_Calc_for_Values_2018.bcf – script to calculate the relative cost/profit of 
sending each block to each possible destination. Used in the GCO to decide on the 
optimum destinations for blocks. 

These scripts prepared the regular block model to be run through the Vulcan GCO process 
(Figure 15-2). The '.csh' script added the required variables for the values and destination 
restrictions referenced in the GCO script (04_GCO_Calc_for_Values_2018). This was scripted 
to make the process of adding the variables easier and quicker, whilst ensuring that the variable 
types and defaults were correct for later parts of the process.  

In Vulcan, the option 'Block > Grade Control Optimiser > Grade Control Optimiser' was used to 
set up a single run of 4.5 m at one elevation. The middle of the flitch elevation was used and it 
was told to use existing economic block value variables. Under economic value, five destinations 
were defined. These were 'dump', 'fresh', 'oxide', 'trans_oxide', and 'red_trans', with the 
corresponding constraint variables 'cons_dump', 'cons_fresh', 'cons_oxide', 'cons_oxide_trans', 
and 'cons_reduced_trans'. The process was told to use a mining unit of 6 x 6 blocks, this defining 
a 4.5 m mining unit. An edge buffer of one block was used. The destinations assigned were 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 204 

written to 'dest_id_45m' and 'dest_name_45m'. Optimisation took place from feasibility and 500 
maximum iterations were used under the advanced settings. 

 

Figure 15-2 Solid Used to Limit the GCO Process and Reduce Processing Time to the Area of Interest 

Once one spec file was set up, a custom lava script 'GCO_script_v10_B.lava' was run in order 
to produce and run spec files for all required benches. Due to time constraints, the data was 
copied to three different machines which all worked on different elevations of the model. Finally, 
another script was run which flagged blocks that had been sent to ore destinations with a 1. 

• 05_flag_for_grade_shell.bcf – script to flag a variable called 'flag_for_grade_shell_45m' 
with a value of 1 for ore destinations and 0 for waste destination. 

This flagged variable was grade shelled in Vulcan, honouring the exact block boundary to 
produce a solid triangulation. As this process was being run across three different machines on 
different elevations of the block model, each was grade shelled separately and then clipped such 
that the final solids did not overlap. These solids were sent back to Randgold for use in flagging 
back into the block model; those blocks which would be considered ore. 

The number of blocks used in the process should be restricted as much as possible. A pit design 
or economic pit shell solid is the best thing to use for this task, although at the time of running the 
process, these restricting solids were not available. A very basic solid was therefore made for 
this task to restrict as much as possible the area to be optimised while still easily covering any 
reasonable economic pit shell that may be produced. Even with these restrictions, the GCO 
process would take days to run for a single SMU simulation. 

The data therefore had to be used on several computers, each running simulations on different 
elevations of the pit and the results combined afterwards. The number of simulation iterations 
had to be set to 500 to produce a result in a reasonable timeframe. In the deeper parts of the pit, 
a single GCO run may take a few minutes as there are fewer blocks to simulate. Higher up the 
pit, a GCO run with the same settings on a bench could take a number of hours as there are so 
many more blocks to run simulations on. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 205 

The time and technical restrictions of the Project meant that only the 4.5 m SMU could be 
simulated. In the previous work on Massawa, three or four different SMU sizes were run to 
compare the results and ensure consistency. 

It is recommended that for any future GCO runs, a pit shell or pit design be used to restrict the 
number of blocks for the simulations. Time should be allowed for single runs to be performed on 
individual benches at different elevations of the pit to ensure that results and scripts are correct 
for all of the various rock types and destinations throughout the pit. A single machine should be 
used to perform the optimisation work to ensure consistency between different versions of block 
models and scripts.  

15.1.4. Optimiser Results 

The final flagged variable 'flag_for_grade_shell_45m' was grade shelled with the grade shell 
honouring the exact block boundary. These four solids were clipped so that each 2.5 m flitch was 
only covered once, i.e. the triangulations were mutually exclusive. The results are shown below 
in Figure 15-3 and Figure 15-4. The solids were then used to flag into the block model. As they 
were used for flagging, it was necessary to combine them into a single closed valid solid. It may 
be preferable to combine them into one solid and clip by the final pit design, but in this case, it 
was not required to combine the solids into one.

In order to verify the automated method described above, a manual exercise was carried out, 
whereby the mineable polygons were manually digitised, on a 4.5 m flitch, using the ore body 
wireframes and gold grade block model values as a visual guide. Figure 15-5 illustrates the 
results of this exercise which gave an overall 40% dilution and 10% ore loss. This compares 
favourably with the 36% dilution and 8% as determined by the GCO study.

The manual exercise also confirms the ratio of bulk versus selective mining that will be required 
in the CZ pit being 70% bulk mining and 30% selective mining. 

15.2. Cut-Off Grade 

To enable an improved cash flow, a full grade ore classification was implemented, with 
preferential treatment for high-grade ore. Marginal ore is treated only at the end of the mine life 
after being stockpiled, when mining has stopped. 

The cut-off grade, g, is where revenue from the gold produced equals the cost of treating ore that 
includes the cost of refinery and shipping. Cut-off grades are calculated below as: 

𝒈𝒈 = 𝒄𝒄 ÷ 𝒓𝒓 × 𝒑𝒑 

Where;  g = cut-off grade 

c = total operating costs $ /t treated = mining cost + metallurgical cost + G&A costs 

r = metallurgical recovery  

p = selling price $ /g = (gold price – (gold price x royalty)) ÷ 31.10348.

16. Mining Methods 

The proposed mining method is conventional 90 t truck and excavator open pit mining method. 
Concepts considered when making this decision included: 

• Ore bodies at the four deposits are long, narrow, and exposed on surface. 

• Length of Project life - the Project has a current mining life of approximately 10 years. 

• Mill feed, waste, and low-grade material all require storage in separate facilities requiring 
flexibility in haulage options. 

• Loading units have been nominated as excavators in backhoe configuration rather than 
face shovels, due to the selective nature of the mining required together with the 
dimensions of the ore lodes. 

16.1. Mine Design 

16.1.1. Geotechnical Investigations and Implications for Mine Design 

Mine design geotechnical investigations for Massawa were carried out by Dr Peter JS Gash of 
MineNet, an independent Qualified Person, in December 2018 and the work was assessed and 
approved by Barrick. 

The average depth (Table 16-1) of the regolith categories (excepting the NE – holes 215 and 217 
where the carbonaceous schist (CS) sub-outcrop results in deep penetration of broken rock and 
changes the picture) is as follows (note depths are approximate vertical equivalents to the down 
hole depths): 

• Base of SAProlite = 25 m. 

• Base of SAPRock = 40 m. 

• Base of Weathered Rock = 50 m. 

• Base of Broken Rock = 60 m. 

• Base of Broken CS (locally in NE) = 90 m.

Sufficient rock testing was carried out in the Massawa investigations to establish the rock strength 
and modulus characteristics for slope design purposes. The uniaxial strengths of intact rocks at 
the site varied between 70 MPa and 170 MPa.  The key observation related to the CS, which 
were too broken for testing from depths down to 80 m below surface, but at depths were

competent with strength of 70 MPa. The density of all rock types was 2.75 t/m3 with a very tight 
variation. 

The rock types are different at the other sites across the lease area but display a similar range of 
strengths. 

Slope designs for Massawa CZ and NZ, Sofia Main and North, and Delya are based on the

Slopes in soil are based on the following groundwater provisions: 

• Massawa Central and North Zone, Sofia Main 

o The slopes must be depressurised. The dewatering plan for the Massawa pit has 
been derived separately in the report by Artois Consulting (Artois) of December 2018 
'Hydrogeology Assessment for Pit Dewatering'. This report has had input from, and 
has been approved by, Callistus Vog-Enga. This therefore becomes an integral part 
of the slope design. 

o Piezometers around the pit are needed to monitor the effectiveness of 
depressurisation measures. These are additional to the pumping provisions given in 
the Artois hydrogeology report.  

o Prioritise dry season working in soils, which is particularly relevant for the first drop 
cut and integral with the sump strategy. 

o Perimeter drainage and rainy season protection is still needed; sump strategy, run-
off diversions, and ramp cross-falls.  

o Limitation on rate of deepening – not a precise science but an average of one bench 
lift (10 m) per month in order to allow water pressure dissipation under gravity. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 213 

• Sofia North 

o The slopes must be depressurised.  
o The NE sector of the FW will require advance dewatering using borehole wells. The 

requirement for any special measures for the outlying north extension pit should be 
assessed in the light of future investigations. 

o Water retaining structure(s) and diversion(s) will be needed upstream of the river that 
crosses the extreme north of the current target ($1,000/oz) pit. These projects will be 
in the remit of the Construction Team, but design collaboration with 
geotechnics/planning is essential throughout the process. 

o Prioritise dry season working in soils, which is particularly relevant for the first drop 
cut and integral with the sump strategy. 

o Perimeter drainage and rainy season protection is still needed; sump strategy, run-

16.1.2. Hydrogeology 

The hydrogeological assessment for the Massawa mining feasibility evaluation concludes the 
following:  

• Due to the naturally shallow groundwater levels across the site (typically 10 m to 30 m 
below surface), groundwater inflow to the excavations will occur throughout mining. The 
groundwater inflow horizons are associated with the near surface weathered horizons, 
and the NNE-SSW fracture zones and lithological contacts at depth. In general, the 
sedimentary units are more permeable than the igneous units.   

• The inflows depend on the hydraulic characteristics of the units, the pit size, and the 
mining advance rate. Due to the accelerated mining rate of each pit (up to 40 m/year), 
high groundwater drawdown rates need to be achieved to keep pace with the operation. 
The likely range of pumping rates per pit during their Life of Mine (LOM) are as follows:  

o Massawa CZ Pit: average 70 L/s (range: 19 – 96 L/s) 
o Massawa NZ Satellite Pit: average 43 L/s (range: 32 – 72 L/s) 
o Massawa NZ Pit: average 18 L/s (range: 7 – 21 L/s) 
o Sofia Main Pit: average 10 L/s (range: 1 – 14 L/s) 
o Sofia Main Satellite Pit: average 3 L/s (range: 2 – 4 L/s) 
o Sofia North Pit: average 17 L/s (range: 12 – 22 L/s) 
o Delya North Pit: average 3 L/s (range 1 – 3 L/s) 
o Delya South Pit: <1 L/s 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 214 

According to the geophysical surveys, the monitoring data, the insitu hydraulic testing, and the 
calibrated numerical forecast models, the majority of the groundwater can be intercepted by 
perimeter and in-pit dewatering wells (approximately 80% of groundwater inflow). The remaining 
water will be drained using sub-horizontal drains drilled into the pit wall. This groundwater 
seepage will collect in the in-pit sumps.   

The geotechnical slope stability analysis can therefore be based on 'drained' or 'dry' pit slopes. 
In addition to seepage water, the in-pit sumps' storage volume and pumping capacity are 
designed to retain and evacuate a 1:50 year return period storm event (183 mm/24 hr). The size 
of each sump varies between less than 1,000 m3 and 40,000 m3 and can be accommodated 
along the pit floor.   

The capital and recurring capital investment for the dewatering system is estimated to amount to 
a minimum of $16.5 million for all pits combined. This investment is spread across the LOM in 
accordance with the mine advance rates. The operating costs are estimated to be in the order of 
$3.7 million. An additional contingency should be built into the final cost calculations as 
adjustments and modifications to mine dewatering plans commonly occur.   

16.1.3. Mine Design and Road Design 

The Whittle pit optimisation shells were imported into the Vulcan software suite for generating 
practical mine designs. The designs strictly adhered to the geotechnical regimes described in the 
previous section and were applied on the $1,000/oz optimal pit. 

Typical ramp formations used are 25 m width (inclusive of berm) for double-lane ramps. At great 
depth, ramps are reduced to 14 m width (inclusive of berm), to reduce the strip ratio. This 
reduction of ramp width impacts production and has only been applied for the last five benches. 
Passing bays have been provided for at strategic positions. Ramp gradients are 10%. Figure 16-1 
to Figure 16-4 show the design pits for the CZ, NZ, Sofia, and Delya pits.

16.1.4. ROM Pad Design and Mine Rock Dumps 

The ROM pad was designed with a total capacity of 4 Mt, which will allow for 3 Mt of refractory 
ore to be mined and stockpiled for processing later in the mine life (Figure 16-5). The remaining 
1 Mt capacity allows for the blending of WOL ore to maximise the efficiency of the processing. 
This calls for a footprint of 650 m by 500 m, on an assumption that 70% of the floor can be used 
for storage of material up to a maximum height of 20 m. The waste material used for constructing 
the ROM pad will come from the Main Zone pit and will be capitalised. A total of 4.1 MBCM is 
required for construction of the ROM pad.  

 

Figure 16-5 Image of ROM Pad Design 

It should be noted that since the Massawa study in 2010, the waste dump design and 
environmental provisions have developed. There is now a company standard design across the 
region, which has been approved by the Environmental Department. 

The objective of this exercise is to maximise the allowable dump stack geometry and the 
contained volume capacity whilst ensuring that the design will be stable in the long term and will 
respect the environmental commitments for rehabilitation.   

There are two governing parameters: - 

• Angle of repose of dumped materials – 37°.  This angle is remarkably constant across a 
wide range of materials and conditions (always between 35° and 40°). 

• Angle of battering for rehabilitation and revegetation – 30°.  This is the angle defined by 
Environmental Department and is a governance issue.  Historically varied from a 
maximum slope of 1-in-1.5 to below 20° (with many dumps not rehabilitated at all). 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 217 

Thereafter, the design dimensions are a function of the operability and the method statement for 
how the rehabilitation will be carried out and what equipment will be trafficking. There is no 
environmental constraint on the lifts and offsets, only the battering angle. The battering of the 
slopes will be performed by bulldozers working on the end-tipped slope gradient from top to 
bottom. There is a limiting vertical lift over which this can be safely and efficiently performed. The 
size of bulldozer is taken as D9 which has a footprint of approximately 3 m wide. 

The dimensions of the finished rehabilitated dumps should be:  

• Dumping operating vertical lift: 20 m 

• Minimum offset (construction berm): 5 m - with the finished slope profiled and battered to 
30°. 

In order to have sufficient width to carry out the battering, the dimensions of the stacks when they 
are built by tip and push dumping should be:  

• Dumping stack lift: 20 m. 

• Angle of end-tipped dump: 37° – angle of repose. 

• Offset for each stack: 13 m. 

Note that the depositional offset of 13 m narrows down to 5 m as the slope is battered by re-
distributing material from a 37° slope down to a 30° slope. 

The resultant slope angle (equivalent to mid-bench slope angles of the pit walls) for this geometry 
is: 

• 27°. 

• Factor of Safety (FoS) = 1.37. 

This represents an increase in potential volume capacity of approximately 4° compared to the 
previous design. This design angle is shallower than the maximum allowable slope for long-term 
stability, which would be a little over 30° overall. The limiting design angle is a function of the 
requirement for site rehabilitation not dump stability. 

In the case of the Massawa plan, the dump plans have not been referred for geotechnical review. 
The above design has been specified as a reference for any appraisal. 

The locations of both the dumps and ROM pad were selected with the aim of minimising the haul 
distances, given the topography constraints of the area. The ROM pad is located adjacent to the 
plant position.  

Figure 16-6 to Figure 16-8 are 3D images of the CZ, NZ, Sofia, and Delya pits and dump designs. 
Figure 16-9 shows the location of the Massawa CZ and NZ pits and dumps relative to the ROM 
pad.

The grade profile increases as the depth increases due to the plunging nature of the high grade 
in the NZ. Initial years are dominated by oxide material followed by significant hard rock mining 
from year 3 onwards (Figure 16-10 and Figure 16-11).

The potential of owner mining is not excluded for consideration at a later date, however, for the 
purposes of the FS, it has been assumed that a mining contractor will be responsible for the 
mining at Massawa.  

The impact of the owner mining approach is that the open pit operation incurs higher capital costs 
and reduced operating costs primarily due to the outright purchase of mobile mining equipment 
and absence of contractor's profit margin and financing cost. Randgold has made a successful 
transition to owner mining at the Loulo underground operations and therefore has the knowledge 
and experience to transition to operate owner mining at Massawa, if and when appropriate. 

A tender process is in progress for the contract mining of material at Massawa. The first round of 
the tender process has been completed and four companies have been selected to proceed 
through to the second and final round. The tenders received have given a good indication of the 
expected mining cost as well the size of equipment and fleet to be implemented at Massawa. 

The contractor mining activities at Massawa will include GC drilling, drill and blast, load and haul, 
and crusher feeding.  

Grade control will be managed through the use of dedicated GC rigs, directed by the Mineral 
Resource management team using standard procedures from existing Barrick operating mines 
in West Africa. As part of the feasibility programme, Massawa CZ and NZ, Sofia, and Delya will 
be drilled to AdvGC drill spacing detailed in the resources section prior to the commencement of 
mining. 

The supply of explosives emulsion and accessories will be provided by the explosives contractor 
which can deliver service from 'on the bench service' to a complete 'down the hole service'.  

The Project objectives are to: 

• Extract the ore and waste in an optimal manner. 

• Separate the ore based on type and grade. 

• Maximise the recovery of the in-pit ore. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 223 

• Minimise dilution of the ore. 

• Minimise mining costs through improved mining efficiency of waste and ore. 

16.2. Open Pit Mining Operating Costs 

The Massawa OP mining operating costs have been calculated based on tenders received by 
selected reputable mining contractors.  

All mine activity costs are treated as operating costs.  

Crusher feed will be completed by direct tipping and by a Caterpillar 988 front end loader. A re-
handle of 100% is envisaged based on the requirement to blend the ore for the optimal feed ratio 
required by the plant. 

The contractor will provide its own mining equipment and therefore no capital expenditure will be 
required from Massawa. 

Mining costs are based on contactor mining quotations as submitted through a mining tender 
process as shown in Table 16-11, Table 16-12, and Table 16-11. Table 16-12 shows the LOM 
mining operating costs which total $3.55/t mined.

17. Recovery Methods 

17.1. Processing Plant Summary  

The proposed WOL and refractory process plant design is based on well-known and established 
gravity/CIL technology, which consists of crushing, milling, and gravity recovery of free gold 
followed by leaching/adsorption of gravity tailings, elution, gold smelting, and tailings disposal. 
The refractory process, which includes sulphide flotation, regrind, and BIOX process, is also a 
well-known technology that will be supplied by Outotec at a later stage.  Services to the process 
plant will include reagent mixing, storage and distribution, water, and air services. 

Ore will be processed in three phases: 

• Phase 1 – Oxide ore will be processed through primary crushing (mineral sizer), milling, 
and gravity recovery, CIL, gold recovery stages (acid wash, elution, electrowinning, 
regeneration), and detoxification of tails prior to disposal. 

• Phase 2 – Fresh (sulphide) ore will be processed through primary (jaw crusher) and 
secondary (cone crusher) crushing, mill feed bin, milling, and gravity recovery, CIL, gold 
recovery stages from carbon, and detoxification of solids prior to disposal. 

• Phase 3 – Refractory ore will be processed through primary and secondary crushing, mill 
feed bin, milling, and gravity recovery, flotation, regrind mill, BIOX, CIL, gold recovery 
stages from carbon, and detoxification of tails prior to disposal. 

During Phases 1 and 2, the plant will treat 2.4 Mtpa of oxide, transition, and WOL sulphide ore 
campaigned through the plant separately or in a combination, if required. For the refractory 
sulphide ore (Phase 3), the plant feed drops to 1.2 Mtpa. Oxide rock will be crushed through a 
mineral sizer during Phase 1, whereas during Phases 2 and 3, transition and sulphide (including 
refractory) rock will be crushed through a primary jaw crusher and stockpiled with bypass 
allowances directly to the milling circuit for the softer and stickier ores.  

Milling will consist of a primary semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill, secondary ball mill, and a 
pebble crusher. The SAG mill will be operated in open circuit in the initial phase of the Project 
when treating predominantly oxide ores, while the ball mill will be in closed circuit with a 
hydrocyclone cluster which will be installed when the more competent transition and sulphide 
ores are mined. Pebbles generated from the SAG mill will be conveyed to a pebble crusher where 
they will be further reduced in size and re-circulated to the SAG mill, especially when treating 
competent ore. The discharge from both mills will be combined in a cyclone feed sump and will 
be pumped to the cyclone cluster for classification.  

A proportion of the cyclone feed will be fed to the gravity circuit for recovery of gravity gold, with 
the cyclone underflow gravitating to the ball mill for further size reduction. Gold will be recovered 
from the gravity concentrates through a combination of intensive cyanidation and electrowinning 
facilities. The gravity recovery tailings will be transferred back to the mill feed for further liberation. 
Gold that is not gravity recoverable is recovered through the CIL process.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 227 

Depending on the phase, the overflow from the cyclone cluster will either be pumped to a pre-
leach thickener or flotation circuit. The thickener underflow (Phase 1 and 2 material) will feed the 
seven-stage CIL circuit, where gold will be dissolved and adsorbed onto carbon. The resultant 
CIL tailings slurry will be subjected to a partial cyanide destruction process, prior to being pumped 
to the tailings disposal and storage facilities. The refractory (Phase 3) material that was pumped 
to the flotation circuit is concentrated in a single bank of five roughing stages before being sent 
for regrinding and fed to the concentrate thickening.  

The thickened flotation concentrate is pumped to the BIOX stock tank. The BIOX reactors consist 
of five equidimensional reactors configured in parallel followed by four secondary reactors 
operating in series. The feed concentrate from the stock tank is diluted before being fed to the 
primary BIOX reactors.  

The pulp temperature in the reactors is controlled via cooling coils and the excess heat is 
removed by evaporative cooling towers from the cooling water. Low-pressure air is injected into 
the BIOX reactors to supply oxygen for the oxidation reactions.  

The oxidation of pyrite produces acid, while the oxidation of arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite and the 
dissolution of carbonate minerals consume acid.  

The BIOX product contains high concentrations of dissolved ions and must be washed in a three-
stage counter-current decantation (CCD) circuit before being sent to CIL for gold leaching. The 
CCD wash thickener overflow liquor is neutralised in a two-stage process to produce a stable 
precipitate containing all the iron and arsenic. The arsenic is precipitated as a stable ferric 
arsenate and is safe for disposal on a tailings dam.  

The process plant design makes allowance for treating any contaminated water discharge from 
the Return Water Dams (RWD). 

Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit will be acid washed prior to elution, followed by reactivation 
of the eluted carbon. The solution from the elution circuit will be subjected to electrowinning, 
where gold will be deposited onto cathodes as sludge. Periodically, the sludge will be washed off 
the cathodes and dried. The dried gold 'sludge' will then be smelted to produce gold bullion, which 
will be shipped to a refinery. 

A simplified process flow diagram is shown in Figure 17-1.

17.2. Process Plant Design Criteria 

The process plant design criteria of the Massawa process facility were devised based on 
metallurgical testwork results obtained from MMSA, Hazen, SGS, and Outotec, and assumptions, 
where necessary. The plant design is based on the simultaneous treatment of ore from multiple 
pits ranging from oxides, fresh WOL, to refractory material over the LOM.  

The throughput is based on the mining plan and the process plant will be designed to treat the 
following tonnage: 

• Phase 1 – 2.7 Mtpa of a mixed feed consisting of oxide ore only for Phase 1 of the LOM. 

• Phase 2 – 2.4 Mtpa of a mixed feed consisting of predominantly fresh ore blended with 
oxide transition and sulphide ore for Phase 2 of the LOM. 

• Phase 3 – 1.2 Mtpa of a mixed feed consisting of predominantly NZ sulphide ore blended 
with Delya and CZ ores to lower acid requirements in the BIOX process for Phase 3 of 
the LOM. 

Table 17-1 summarises the principal process design criteria established for the Project.

17.2.1. Plant Throughput and Operating Schedule 

The plant has been designed for a throughput of 2.4 Mtpa of fresh ore which can increase to 3.0 
Mtpa when treating the softer oxides. The average and LOM milling rates were determined for all 
the composites by using the operating schedule and the relative abundances of the type of ore 
to be treated as given in the mining schedule. Soft ore crushing will be via a mineral sizer and 
hard ore via a primary jaw crusher, the overall utilisation is assumed to be 69%, after deducting 
maintenance hours, and based on operating experience from similar plants. The overall utilisation 
of the comminution and extraction circuits is assumed to be 91.3%.   

17.2.2. Crushing 

The design of the crushing circuit is based on one of Barrick's operational plants, Gounkoto. The 
design also incorporated SENET's experience with previous projects when treating material with 
similar characteristics, together with recommendations obtained from Orway Metallurgical 
Consultants (OMC) and CMD.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 231 

The initial mine blend will consist of weathered material from various pits. Phase 1 of the LOM 
will have a very high oxide contribution. The competent ore becomes the majority of the feed 
during Phase 2. Crushing the oxides, however, may result in ore handling challenges that have 
to be managed upfront. There will be a single primary crushing station (Mineral sizer) to treat soft 
ore from both the Sofia Main and North pit with inclusion of the CZ and NZ pits. Both the crushing 
and milling circuit will be designed to cater for the variation in ore handling required during the 
LOM.  

When treating the softer oxide material (Phase 1), the crusher product will be conveyed directly 
to the SAG mill feed with no stockpiling, as rat holing may result in a stockpile due to the presence 
of excessive amounts of fines. Soft rock can also potentially cause material handling problems 
when processed through a jaw crusher, therefore, a second-hand mineral sizer will be relocated 
from the Morila Mine in Mali. The soft ore can, at times, contain high quantities of clay and 
moisture that cause flowability constraints and, therefore, this change is considered prudent. An 
apron feeder will be installed for the withdrawal of ore from the ROM bin that is also used when 
treating fresh ore.  

The balance of the ore in Phase 2, which will include medium and hard rock types (fresh ore), 
will be treated through a new jaw crusher (CJ815 Sandvik) to produce a secondary crushing feed.  

The single-stage primary jaw crusher (single toggle) is easy to operate and to maintain, and it 
can withstand heavily abrasive ores when compared to double-toggle jaw crushers. Primary 
crushed material will discharge on a sacrificial conveyor followed by a longer secondary crusher 
feed conveyor which feeds directly into the secondary cone crusher. The secondary cone crusher 
product is conveyed into the mill feed bin with a 90 min live capacity, from which the fine ore will 
be withdrawn at a controlled rate using the mill feed apron feeder onto the mill feed conveyor 
feeding the SAG mill. 

The mill feed bin ensures a constant feed to the mill. When the mill feed bin is full or if 
maintenance work is being carried out on the bin, a provision has been made for the crushed ore 
to be diverted to an emergency stockpile with a minimum of 24 hr emergency storage capacity. 

Conveyors will be designed to transport the wet equivalent of the rated dry capacity at the design 
bulk density. 

Dust suppression systems are included in the design as a means of containing the dust produced 
by the crushing circuit. The dust suppression system uses fine water sprays, which will be used 
to suppress dust at the main dust-generating points. 

17.2.3. Milling and Classification 

The milling and classification circuit was designed by considering the following: 

• Variability testwork conducted on the ore bodies; 

• Rheological characteristics and comminution testwork results; 

• OMC Circuit Modelling (Report No. 7860-02 Rev 0 October 2017); 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 232 

• CMD Circuit Modelling - Second DRAFT report for Massawa 2CSAB 30 May 2018. 

The initial comminution modelling that OMC completed focussed on the best flow sheet selection 
for the three distinct processing phases (oxide (Phase 1), fresh WOL (Phase 2), and fresh 
refractory (Phase 3) material) that was identified in the PFS phase. OMC was requested to 
consider two mill sizes, one sized as new and one sized identical to that which is in operation at 
numerous Barrick sites in West Africa. The mill sizes are 5.5 m by 8.0 m EGL, 4,500 kW installed 
and 6.1 m by 9.5 m EGL, 7,000 kW installed, both in overflow configuration. 

Table 17-2 summarises the selected mills and phases simulated after the first round of modelling.

Comminution circuit modelling was completed using client supplied information that higher than 
normal power draws may be achieved with the nominated mill sizes (6.1 m Ø by 9.5 m EGL ball 
mills), which is in line with observations at Tongon after modifications. Table 17-3 summarises 
the phase and associated mills that were evaluated. 

Table 17-3 Mill Duty Achievable Commentary 

Phases Duty Achievable/Commentary 
1 Yes 

1 - Alternative Yes - where scrubber is omitted and only a single stage ball mill is considered 
2 No - ball mill limited. Duty achievable by sending a portion of primary cyclone underflow back to the primary mill 

3 0.6 Mtpa - Yes,  1.2 Mtpa - No – A larger mill will be required 

Power modelling of the circuit furthermore indicated that the circuit will be secondary ball limited. 
To balance the circuit power draw, recycling a portion of the primary mill cyclone underflow to 
primary ball mill feed will be required. 

The Phase 3 evaluation indicated that the nominated 5.5 m Ø by 5.5 m EGL ball mill with 4.5 MW 
motor is suitable to achieve the lower 0.6 Mtpa throughput duty but not the planned 1.2 Mtpa 
target. It was found that a 6.1 m Ø by 6.1 m EGL grate discharge ball mill with a 5 MW motor, 
operating in a closed-circuit configuration, is suitable. 

To further assist the development of the new comminution circuit, another consultant, CMD, was 
approached to evaluate the now dormant Morila SAG and ball mills in terms of being refurbished 
and made available for the Project. 

Two circuit configurations using mill sizes that are common within the Barrick mines in West 
Africa were evaluated. These are: 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 233 

OPTION 1a 

• A 300 tph, 2C/PM/BM circuit configuration with primary and closed-circuit secondary 
crushing followed by a new low aspect ratio primary mill (20 ft by 30.7 ft EGL) and ball 
mill in series (similar to the Loulo circuit). Common pebble/secondary crushing. 

OPTION 1b  

• A 300 tph, 2C/PM/BM circuit configuration with primary and open circuit secondary 
crushing followed by a new low aspect ratio primary mill (20 ft by 30.7 ft EGL) and ball 
mill in series (similar to the Loulo circuit). 

OPTION 1c  

• A 150 tph, 2CB (or 2C/SS SAG +PC) circuit configuration with primary and closed-circuit 
secondary crushing followed by a two trains of low aspect ratio ThyssenKrupp (20 ft by 
30.7 ft EGL) mills in parallel with common pebble crushing (similar to the Kibali sulphide 
circuit with secondary crushing and coarse feed to the overflow discharge ball mills). 

OPTION 1d 

• A 150 tph, 3CB+scatting PC circuit configuration with primary and open circuit secondary 
crushing followed closed circuit tertiary crushing and a low aspect ratio ThyssenKrupp (20 
ft by 30.7 ft EGL) mills (similar to the Tongon sulphide circuit with quaternary crushing 
and fine feed to the grate discharge ball mills). 

OPTION 2 

• A 300 tph, 2C/SAB(C) circuit configuration with primary and open circuit secondary 
crushing followed by a relocated and refurbished Morila SAG mill (26 by 18 ft EGL) and 
followed by the Morila ball mill (20 ft by 29.5 ft EGL). HPGR was also considered in the 
flowsheet as the SAG pebble crusher (2C/SABC) (similar to Morila/Geita circuit 
configurations). 

The analysis of the available data within the context of the above-mentioned flow sheet options, 
CMD confirmed that either option will meet the 300 tph throughput rate during year 2025 which 
appears to be the most difficult year in terms of ore blending and processing of hard ore. 

CMD also concluded that either of the 300 tph circuits will work, however, CMD indicated that 
Option 1b with a higher capital cost is the lower risk option and that Option 2 would require a 
proper investigation to quantify the extent of refurbishment that is required. This exercise was 
already completed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) including another suitable 
Vendor to validate the intended refurbishment costs.  

Initially, the circuit could cope without the need for a pebble crusher, however, CMD 
recommended that a pebble crusher be designed so that it can be installed at a later date if 
required. The idea of using an HPGR as a pebble crusher is not warranted due to the very low 
pebble rates that would be expected. 

CMD also recommended that the ore blends and ore characteristics should be measured, and a 
forecast model developed that will enable appropriate design changes to the ball charge, ball

size distribution, and grate design to match the operating conditions over six monthly or quarterly 
intervals. 

The proposed comminution circuit specifications for the mills are as follows:  

Morila SAG Mill 26 by 18 ft EGL (19 ft F/F): 

• The mill is 8.0 m in diameter (7.8 m inside liner) by 5.9 m long F/F (5.6 m EGL, measured 
effective grinding length). 

• Feed trunnion diameter is 1.84 m, feed and discharge cone ends at 0°. 

• Effective discharge cone end has zero degrees as it is a flat ended grate design that 
defines the volume of the grinding chamber within the mill. 

• Current grate open area (OA) configuration is 12 segments with 15 mm by 25 mm slots. 
The calculated OA is 8.0%. 

• Variable speed with 60% to 85% of critical. 

• Pinion driven mill is fitted with a 6,000 kW motor. 

• Ball size to initially be a blend of 105 mm and 70 mm. 

• Ball filling range 9% to 12% for the harder ore types (year 2025). 

• Total mill filling with this ore density to range from 22% to 32% filling average 25%. 
 

Morila Ball Mill 20 by 29.5 ft EGL: 

• The mill is 6.1 m in diameter (5.9 m inside liners) by 9.11 m long EGL. Ball mill is an 
overflow mill as is the case at Morila. 

• Feed trunnion diameter is 1.4 m, feed and discharge cone ends at 0°. 

• Effective discharge cone end has zero degrees as it is a flat ended grate design that 
defines the volume of the grinding chamber within the mill. 

• Driven at a fixed speed of 75% of critical by a 6,000 kW motor. 

• Ball size to initially be a blend of 70 mm and 50 mm. 

• Ball filling 38% max for the harder ore types (year 2025) draws 6463 kW. 

• Ball mill is too small for 2C/SABC circuit, unless the Morila mill motor is upgraded to 7 
MW. Total mill filling with this ore density to range from 36% to 38%. 

A variable speed drive is installed on the SAG mill to cater for variations in the hard and soft ore 
characteristics during the LOM. The SAG milling circuit, particularly when operating in a single-
stage configuration, requires a reasonably consistent feed blend to ensure stable operation.  

The installed pebble crusher will operate when needed and is required for hard ore handling. The 
pebble crusher will assist in returning the recycled pebbles that do not readily break down during 
SAG milling. This will result in improved power usage and throughput.  

Calculations have demonstrated that CZ ore is the hardest, however, the Morila mills are capable 
of the task and design throughputs, although it is prudent for CZ ore to be fed as a blend with 
other ore types, with CZ making up a maximum of the order of 75% of the feed. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 235 

Classification of the milled product will be through hydrocyclones. A cyclone cluster will be 
designed, from which a 25% solids cyclone overflow product will be targeted to be fed to a pre-
leach thickener from Phase 2 onwards. Based on the comminution circuit modelling exercise, an 
allowance has been made in the design for recycling the cyclone underflow to the SAG mill, 
required for certain periods during the LOM.  

A linear trash screen will be included in the design prior to leach, i.e. to remove tramp material. 
The trash screen will be configured such that the undersize from the trash screen will gravitate 
to a sump and will be pumped to the pre-leach thickener from Phase 2 onwards and directly to 
the leach tank train for oxides. 

17.2.4. Gravity Concentration 

The results of the GRG batch laboratory tests indicated that free gold is available in all the ore 
types in significant quantities. In addition, intensive cyanidation of the resultant gravity 
concentrates from most of the ore types showed favourable leach kinetics and gold extraction. 
As a result, a gravity circuit consisting of a centrifugal concentrator, intensive cyanidation reactor, 
and a dedicated electrowinning cell for handling the pregnant leach solution will be designed to 
recover free gold from a portion of the cyclone underflow. This circuit will improve the overall gold 
recovery and reduce the residence time in the CIL circuit. Simulation results from the GRG tests 
and the concentrate leach extraction parameters obtained from the tests were used as the basis 
of the design. 

17.2.5. Trash Removal and Pre-Leach Thickening 

The variable operation of the milling circuit due to the varying competency of the materials being 
treated will require the classification circuit to cater for a range of overflow densities expected 
during operation as mill re-circulating loads and feed water dilution are adjusted. To stabilise the 
control of the SAG and ball milling circuit when treating the more competent ore, a dilute overflow 
solids density from the cyclone cluster (25% to 30%) will be required during operation. This is 
much lower than the optimum CIL tank solids density (40%). Pre-leach thickening will, therefore, 
be required to densify the milled product to the optimum solids concentration required in the CIL 
tanks. The basis of design for the 35 m pre-leach thickener and associated flocculant make-up 
system includes settling rates obtained from thickening and rheology testwork conducted by 
specialist thickening consultants Vietti Slurrytec (2018).  

17.2.6. Flotation and Concentrate Production 

Rougher Flotation 

The flotation design is based on results obtained from three campaigns, 22 and 19/20, including 
testwork on NZ and, later, CZ material. The testwork results indicated that a much longer 
residence time was required for NZ material than the faster floating CZ material. A single bank of 
rougher flotation cells was chosen because of the initial low mass pull and high recoveries 
achieved; the minimum number of cells required was four, and five cells were chosen for the 
design. The cell sizes were based on NZ material with a residence time of 120 minutes.   



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 236 

The concentrates from the different cells were combined to form the final concentrate product, 
although allowance have been made to combine the tail end rougher concentrates for possible 
recycling at a later stage when treating the higher mass pull CZ material. 

Concentrate Regrind Circuit 

The regrind circuit design was based on a concentrate mass pull of 20% and an estimate Bond 
Ball Mill Work Index of 28.4 kWh/t. 

Concentrate Thickening 

The basis of design for the 11 m concentrate thickener and associated flocculant make-up system 
includes settling rates obtained from thickening and rheology testwork conducted by specialist 
thickening consultants Vietti Slurrytec (2017).  

17.2.7. BIOX 

Primary and Secondary Reactors 

The proposed flow sheet for the BIOX plant includes the treatment of a blend of Massawa NZ 
and refractory CZ sulphide concentrate at an ore feed rate of 1.2 Mtpa to the plant.  The BIOX 
plant will also be able to treat concentrates generated from various ratios of NZ, CZ, and Delya 
ores as listed in Table 17-4. 

Table 17-4 Massawa Process Plant Ore Feed Scenarios 

Parameter  
Design Scenario 1   Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4

CZ ore in feed mix (%) 25 0 25 0 0 
Delya ore in feed mix (%) 0 0 0 100 24 

The main considerations for developing the flow sheet for the BIOX plant were to consistently 
achieve high levels of sulphide sulphur oxidation in the most cost-efficient way. This will be 
achieved by: 

• Optimally configuring the BIOX reactors, internals, and utilities. 

• Minimising limestone requirement for BIOX pH control through concentrate blend 
optimisation. 

• Minimising limestone requirement for neutralisation pH control through the optimal use of 
available carbonates in the flotation tailings. 

• Minimising gold losses over the CCD circuit. 

• Minimising gravity gold lock-up in the BIOX reactors. 

• Ensuring the disposal of environmentally acceptable process effluent streams on a 
constant basis/ 

• Using ASTER to allow for the recycling of cyanide contaminated tailings water.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 237 

Based on the current design criteria, the BIOX circuit will consist of one BIOX module, configured 
as five primary reactors operating in parallel followed by four secondary reactors operating in 
series.  

CCD 

The BIOX product will be washed in a series of three CCD thickeners to remove Fe(T), As(T), 
and sulphate solubilised during bio-oxidation. Test results indicated that the settling rate of the 
BIOX product is enhanced by the dilution of the feed slurry to a targeted 8% solids. It is therefore 
recommended that the CCD thickeners be equipped with auto-dilution systems to maintain a low 
slurry density in the feed wells.  

The BIOX liquor will report to the neutralisation circuit and the solids will report to the CIL circuit. 

Neutralisation 

Flotation tailings slurry, limestone, and lime will be used for neutralising the BIOX liquor. The 
solution will flow through a series of six neutralisation tanks. Testwork has shown that the use of 
flotation tailings as a neutralising agent can reduce neutralisation reagent consumptions by as 
much as 62%, depending on the percentage of available flotation tailings slurry used. Thickened 
flotation tailings will be added to the first, second, and/or third neutralisation tank.  

Limestone slurry will be added to the second and/or third neutralisation tank to raise the pH to 
4.5. Milk of lime slurry will be added to the fifth and/or sixth neutralisation tank to raise the pH to 
7. 

Aster Circuit 

When water from the Phase 3 TSF is to be returned to the plant, a secondary cyanide 
detoxification treatment using technologies such as the ASTER process will be required for the 
removal of thiocyanate thus enabling the water to be recycled upstream of the BIOX circuit. 

It is important to ensure that no cyanide contaminated water ever reaches the BIOX plant since 
the toxic effect of cyanide on the bacteria used in the BIOX process will be severe. The detoxified 
water returning to the process plant via the ASTER circuit should not exceed the following 
maximum residual concentrations: 

• SCN-   < 1 mg/L. 

• CNO   < 2.5 mg/L. 

• Metal cyanides < 5 mg/L. 

BIOX Services 

The correct distribution and supply of air is critical for optimum BIOX performance and to ensure 
that the required sulphide oxidation is achieved in each reactor. The design flow rate for the 
blowers is based on 10,709 Nm3/hr per primary reactor and 6,622 Nm3/hr per secondary reactor 
and another 4,236 Nm3/hr for the neutralisation circuit.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 238 

The cooling circuit is designed to remove the heat produced by the exothermic sulphide oxidation 
reactions. The upper-temperature limit at which the BIOX culture can operate is approximately 
45°C, and the slurry temperatures should not be allowed to exceed this temperature for extended 
periods. Also, it is critical to maintain the reactor operating temperatures within a narrow range in 
order for a robust microbial culture to be developed and sustained. The slurry temperature in the 
BIOX reactors will be maintained at 42°C by cooling water circulating through the cooling coils. 
The cooling tower flowrate was designed for 2,133 m3/hr based on the maximum heat load that 
would need to be catered for. 

17.2.8. Carbon in Leach 

Gold dissolution and adsorption on the milled ROM and BIOX products (CCD underflow) will be 
done via a seven-stage CIL circuit. Conditioning and pre-leach tanks are included before carbon 
is in contact with the slurry.  

The design will allow for space to include additional CIL tanks if needed during the Project. 
Cyanidation tests conducted on all the composites indicate reasonable gold dissolution within a 
leaching time of 24 hours to 32 hours on gravity middlings and tailings of most of the oxide ores 
under normal CIL conditions. The leaching residence time for the Phase 3 (refractory ores) 
requires extended hours of up to 42 which is offset by the lower design throughput. The leach 
circuit will be designed to treat feed from the thickener underflow at a solids concentration of 40% 
for Phase 2 material and 30% for the Phase 3 refractory material. Tests were conducted at natural 
oxygen levels and the introduction of oxygen will potentially enhance leach kinetics on the fresh 
material. In addition, oxygen uptake rate tests have indicated that aeration is sufficient to meet 
the demand for oxide treatment only, but that oxygen sparging will be required when treating non-
refractory sulphides. The design, therefore, allows for oxygen sparging via two Aachen reactors 
into the conditioning tank and normal sparging into the pre-leach and first seven CIL tanks from 
Phase 1 onwards. A carbon addition of 10 g/L to 12 g/L will be sufficient for the gold adsorption 
in the CIL circuit.  

The SENET internal CIL modelling confirmed the tank volume of 2,500 m3 each, as well as the 
carbon to gold loading ratios (1,000), are achievable. These results were then used to confirm 
the selected daily elution capacity based on the expected carbon movement per day. The 
modelling indicated that adequate gold adsorption could be achieved across the seven stages 
for all the Massawa composites tested. The resulting carbon movement per day was confirmed 
to be not larger than 12 t. 

During Phase 3 the BIOX slurry will be subjected to two stages of pH correction prior to the CIL. 
The pH of the thickened BIOX slurry will first be raised to pH 5, in order to help stabilise and 
precipitate any residual arsenic in solution and then raised to a pH to 10.5 to make it acceptable 
for cyanidation. 

The flow from one CIL tank to another will be through intertank launders, and all tanks will have 
a bypass facility to ensure continuity in production during periods when a tank is taken offline for 
maintenance. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 239 

The design of the CIL area will also incorporate a tower crane on rails, which will be used during 
the construction and operating phases. During the operating phase, it will be used to facilitate 
cleaning of the interstage screens and general maintenance. 

The results from optimised extraction and rheological tests were used as the basis for the CIL 
design. The feed density to the CIL tanks will be designed at 40% solids from Phase 2 onwards 
to cater for flow through the interstage screens. During the oxide ore phase, which tends to be 
associated with higher viscosities, the feed density will be lower being directly from the overflow 
of the classification cyclones.  

Interstage Screens 

The interstage screens will be designed to accommodate the flow that can be expected to arise 
when treating the ores in the CIL tanks. Mineral processing separating pumping (MPS (P)) 
screens were considered for the design as these would maintain the same pulp level in the CIL 
tanks, as the pumping action of these screens would allow pulp movement from one tank to the 
another while carbon is retained in tanks.  

Loaded Carbon Screen 

Loaded carbon from the first CIL tank will be pumped onto a screen, where the screen oversize 
(washed loaded carbon) will gravitate to the acid wash cone, and the undersize (slurry) will report 
to the first CIL tank. A linear screen will be used for this function.  

17.2.9. Carbon Safety and Tails Thickening 

A linear screen will be incorporated into the design to recover any fugitive carbon. 

The basis of design for the 35 m tails thickener and associated flocculant make-up system 
includes settling rates obtained from thickening and rheology testwork conducted by specialist 
thickening consultants Vietti Slurrytec (2018).  

17.2.10. Cyanide Detoxification 

The results of the batch and continuous laboratory tests indicated that cyanide destruction could 
be effected by using SMBS and copper sulphate as catalysts for a period of one hour, reducing 
the WAD cyanide in the final tailings to less than 50 ppm. The cyanide detoxification process will 
thus be designed as two-stage agitated reactors into which compressed air will be blown.  

Using these results, the cyanide detoxification facility in the process plant was designed to 
achieve a nominal WAD cyanide concentration limit of 50 ppm or less in the final tailings to render 
the slurry suitable to be stored in a lined tailings facility according to environmental guidelines. If 
there is a need to detoxify the slurry to a lower WAD cyanide concentration, then additional 
SMBS, copper sulphate, and lime will be required. The design of the reagents storage area, 
therefore, makes provision for the storage of enough reagents to detoxify the tailings slurry to a 
lower discharge concentration of 50 ppm WAD cyanide.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 240 

Allowance has been made for a secondary emergency cyanide detoxification facility at the TSF 
to cater for the detoxification of possible higher than above international standard residual 
cyanide present in the discharge water to the environment.  

17.2.11. Arsenic Precipitation 

The Arsenic Precipitation circuit will receive environmental release quality cyanide solution and 
remove the arsenic in a two-stage precipitation stage. The Arsenic Precipitation plant will be a 
vendor-supplied plant. The design of this facility is based on preliminary testwork, which will need 
to be validated by further testwork during the detailed design phase. 

17.2.12. Acid Wash 

A cold acid wash circuit capable of handling the full 12 t loaded carbon batch will be included to 
remove any carbonates that might otherwise foul the carbon. The circuit will be designed to acid 
wash every batch of carbon before it is eluted by circulating 3% hydrochloric acid through the 
carbon in the acid wash column. The acid wash cone will be designed with an overflow weir to 
facilitate elutriation of the loaded carbon prior to the acid wash step. The elutriation process will 
remove trash from the carbon (such as wood chips and plastics), which might otherwise interfere 
with the flow through the strainers during elution.  

17.2.13. Elution 

Based on the carbon loadings and the amount of gold to be produced per month, the number of 
elutions has been estimated to be 54 per month and a pressure ZADRA elution method was 
selected to strip gold from the loaded carbon in 12 t carbon batches. Heating of the eluant will be 
achieved through diesel-fired thermic oil heaters.  

17.2.14. Electrowinning 

Electrowinning will be affected through sludging-type electrowinning cells. Pregnant solution 
exiting the column will be directed to three double electrowinning cells, operating in parallel for 
CIL, via a flash/header tank where gold will be deposited on the cathodes as sludge and the 
barren solution will be circulated back to the elution tank. A dedicated header tank and 
electrowinning cell will be used to recover gold from the gravity pregnant solution. Electrowinning 
will be affected through sludging-type electrowinning cells. 

17.2.15. Reactivation 

A carbon reactivation facility will be designed to treat the entire eluted carbon batch in a period 
of 11 h. The reactivation kiln will be diesel fired.  

17.2.16. Calcining and Smelting 

Fully loaded cathodes will be periodically removed from the cells, and the gold sludge will be 
washed off using a high-pressure washer and the solution decanted. The gold sludge will be 
calcined (dried) in an electric calcination furnace. The calcined sludge will then be mixed with 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 241 

fluxes and loaded into an induction smelting furnace. During smelting, metal oxides will form slag 
and, once the furnace crucible contents are poured into cascading moulds, gold will solidify at 
the bottom while slag separates easily from the gold. The gold bullion bar(s) will be cleaned, 
labelled, assayed, and readied for shipping. 

17.2.17. Reagents 

Facilities to mix, store, and distribute reagents and consumables will be allowed for in the design. 
These reagents and consumables will include grinding media, cyanide, caustic, lime, limestone, 
flocculant, SMBS, copper sulphate, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), frother, collector, hydrogen 
peroxide, nutrients, water treatment reagents, diesel (for plant use only), hydrochloric acid, and 
smelting fluxes. The reagent consumptions obtained during the testwork for each oxide and fresh 
composite were used to estimate the size of the equipment associated with mixing, storage, and 
distribution. The storage area will allow for minimum of three-month stock holding capacity for 
grinding media, carbon, caustic, flocculant, copper sulphate, PAX, frother, collector, hydrogen 
peroxide, hydrochloric acid, and smelting fluxes.  

Table 17-5 shows the lime and sodium cyanide consumptions based on optimal conditions as 
determined from testwork.

there will be a header tank (5 m3) for general plant use.

The consumptions of smelting fluxes: borax, sodium carbonate, and silica were estimated by 
assuming a flux ratio of 50%, 25%, and 25%, respectively, to the weight of calcine, as per 
standard industry practice. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 242 

17.2.20. Grinding Media 

The SAG and ball mill grinding media consumptions were based on Bond's estimating method 
using abrasion index results obtained from laboratory tests. The consumptions for grinding media 
were estimated by SENET.  

17.2.21. Mill Liners 

The SAG and ball mill liner consumption was based on Bond's estimating method using abrasion 
index results obtained from laboratory tests. Consumptions for liners were estimated by SENET.  

17.2.22. Jaw and Pebble Crusher Liners 

The estimated number of liner changes per annum was determined using the abrasion indices 
obtained from laboratory tests and the expected liner life for the individual composites. The 
expected liner life was supplied by Sandvik.  

17.2.23. Air and Oxygen Services  

Oxygen uptake results obtained through testwork for the CIL circuit will be used as the basis for 
the sizing of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit oxygen plant. Two 10 ton units are allowed 
for in the design with the possibility to increase to three may the need arise.  

The plant air high-pressure compressors, one duty and one standby, supply the plant air required 
(400 Nm3/hr) for the lime plant, workshops and for plant-wide general use. 

Air requirements for the detoxification process needs will be supplied by low-pressure blowers 
(operating and standby) with design based on Phase 3 air requirements (2,748 Nm3/hr).  

Instrument air requirements (250 Nm3/hr) for the entire plant will be supplied by a dedicated 
compressor and air dryer.  

The flotation air blowers (Phase 3), one duty and one standby, will supply the low-pressure air 
required for flotation based on 1,200 Nm3/hr/cell.  

17.2.24. Water Services  

The process water and raw water ponds were sized based on accommodating a 24 hr residence 
time in each.  

Two pontoon pumps will be installed in the diversion dam to enable pumping of water to the 
process and raw water ponds located in the plant. These pumps will be sized to cater for 
commissioning, and dry and wet seasons, where raw water demands vary significantly. During 
the wet season, raw water supply will be supplemented from the RWD. A water balance for these 
three scenarios has been used as the basis to size the transfer pumps, the raw and process 
water ponds, the gland water tank, and all the water pumps including a fire water facility. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 243 

The sizes of the raw and process water ponds are shown in Table 17-6 and Table 17-7, 
respectively. The size for the process water pond was based on the average water requirements 
during Phase 1 (Oxides), for the raw water, it was decided to design a similar size as the process 
water pond. This would cater for maximum requirement during commissioning and ample supply 
during Phase 3.

17.2.25. External Water Treatment Plants 

Arsenic Precipitation Plant 

According to the mining plan, the oxides from either pit will be the predominant feed to the plant 
during the first two years. Thereafter, the CZ sulphides will be blended in significant quantities, 
resulting in higher concentrations of arsenic in the plant tails reporting to the TSF. Consequently, 
the resulting water in the RWD will contain arsenic contaminant.  

The excess water contained in the RWD will discharge into the environment during the wet 
season. The water balance modelling exercise conducted by the environmental team (Digby 
Wells) has stated that arsenic concentrations in the discharge from the RWD will be above the 
IFC guideline limitation during the course of the Project. This is supported by the geochemical 
testwork conducted on the tailings material by Digby Wells. The water will be contaminated with 
arsenic and antimony when the CZ sulphide ore is treated in significant quantities after the first 
two years.  

The treatment plant will be installed to operate from Phase 2 when CZ material is fed and will 
have the capability for arsenic and antimony removal to render the discharge from the RWD 
environmentally compliant. The treatment plant is a vendor-packaged plant provided complete 
by the selected equipment supplier.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 244 

Clarified effluent is collected in the Stage 1 rapid mixing tank 4.5 m (L) by 4.5 m (W) and dosed 
with ferric chloride. The rapid mixing tank will provide for the rapid mixing of the chemicals before 
the water overflows to a concrete flocculation tank. The large flocculated clusters produced will 
settle out in the Stage 1 two lamella clarifiers 12 m (L) by 5 m (W). 

Stage 1 clarified effluent overflows into the Stage 2 rapid mixing tank and follows the same 
treatment process with rapid mixing, flocculation, and settling in final two lamella clarifiers. The 
collected precipitate can either be pumped back to the TSF or solids collected in an impermeable 
lined pond or containers. 

Detailed testwork will be required during the detailed design phase to confirm vendor selection, 
plant sizing, as well as the interfacing with the process plant.  

At this level of study, the arsenic precipitation plant was sized based on a maximum yearly 
discharge volume of 770,268 m3 supplied by Digby Wells; see Table 17-8 for design parameters 
used.

Secondary Detoxification Plant 

The secondary detoxification plant will be installed and operable from the first year of the Project 
and will have the capability of secondary cyanide detoxification to render the discharge from the 
RWD environmentally compliant. The secondary detoxification plant has, therefore, been 
included as a solution to managing the excess water from the RWD. The design was based on a 
maximum yearly discharge volume of 770,268 m3 supplied by Digby Wells (Table 17-9).

17.4. Tailings Storage Facility and Diversion Dam 

17.4.1. Introduction 

As part of the FS, Epoch Resources (Pty) Ltd (Epoch) undertook the FS design of the TSF and 
associated Diversion Dam System (DD), as summarised in this section. The associated capital 
costs were estimated to a Class 3 AACE accuracy (+25%, -15%) and the TSF operational costs, 
to an accuracy of ±25%.  

The design of the TSF comprises:  

• An HDPE lined self-raising Tailings Dam (TD). 

• A HDPE lined RWD associated with the TD. 

• A DD. 

• The storm water management and associated infrastructure for the facilities as mentioned 
above (i.e. perimeter slurry deposition pipeline, storm water diversion trenches, perimeter 
access road, solution trenches, catchment paddocks etc). 

The design criteria associated with the Massawa TSF and DD are summarised in Table 17-10. 
Two types of mineralisation will be mined, namely oxide and sulphide, with gold being extracted 
by three distinctly different metallurgical processes. The oxides and certain of the sulphides will 
be treated by means of the Whole Ore Leach process, while other sulphides will be treated by 
means of the Float Tails process. A small portion of the ore will be treated by means of the BIOX 
process towards the later stages of the mine life.  

In addition, the following legislation, regulations, and design standards have been taken into 
account during the FS design of the TSF and DD:  

• International Cyanide Code Standard of Practice;  

• International Financial Corporation Guidelines; and  

• Since Senegal does not have legislation pertaining specifically to the design of TSFs, 
'Appropriate Best Practice Measures' have been adopted.

17.4.2. Geochemical and Geotechnical Investigations 

Geotechnical Site Investigation 

A geotechnical investigation was conducted by Inroads Consulting LLC (Inroads) during May 
2018. 

Due to the laboratory test results showing very high cohesions under undrained effective stress 
conditions, Inroads recommended shear strength parameters for the remoulded soil types as per 
Table 17-11, which have been utilised in the design of the TSF.

Geotechnical Assessment of the Tailings Residue  

Laboratory testwork was not conducted on the Massawa tailings as representative tailings 
samples could not be provided in time for the completion of the FS. Tailings geotechnical 
parameters were therefore adopted from other projects undertaken in West Africa with similar 
tailings characteristics. During the next phase of the Project, tailings laboratory testwork will be 
required to validate the current assumed tailings geotechnical parameters adopted and presented 
in Table 17-12. 

The indicative particle size distribution (PSD) curves for the Massawa tailings are expected to be 
similar to the PSD curves for other typical West African gold tailings as depicted in Figure 17-4. 
The variation in PSD between the sulphide and oxide feed is also not expected to be significant 
different from each other.

Figure 17-4 Tailings Particle Size Distribution for Typical Gold Tailings Made up of Oxides and Sulphides 

Tailing Geochemistry 

The tailings product produced at Massawa consists of two materials, namely: oxides, originating 
from the CZ and NZ pits located in the SE of the perimeter, and sulphides, originating from the 
Sofia Main ore body located in the NW of the perimeter. The tailings geochemistry testwork and 
evaluation study was completed by Digby Wells; the following results/observations were relayed: 

• The sulphides are found to be benign and thus present no risk to the ground water system 
in the area. 

• The oxides are found to contain cyanide and arsenic. These chemicals present a risk in 
polluting the ground water system should it ingress the soil below the TD and RWD.  

Due to tailings geochemical characteristics both the TD and RWD shall be HDPE lined and the 
discharge water stemming from the RWD into the DD and downstream environment is treated by 
means of an arsenic and cyanide treatment plant located at the RWD.  

17.4.3. TSF and DD Design 

The key design features of the TSF and DD are: 

• A HDPE lined valley dam ring-dyke TD, with an initial starter wall embankment (14 m 
high), to be compacted with remoulded lateritic/saprolitic material from a suitable borrow 
pit within the allocated areas. The TD converts to an upstream self-raising facility above 
the starter wall elevation to a final height of 27 m. This facility has been designed to store 
20 Mt over the LOM at a varying depositional rate and an average insitu placed dry density 
of 1.35 t/m3. 

• The TD has an average rate of rise of 1.5 m/year and an overall upstream slope of 1V:3H. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 251 

• A concrete encased penstock decant system, that decants supernatant water into the 
energy dissipator and silt trap system before reporting to RWD and DD complex. 

• An HDPE-lined RWD, which consists of a maximum wall height of 8.5 m above Natural 
Ground Level (NGL), has been sized to cater for 7 days of slurry water with a storage 
capacity of 189,200 m3 it has a footprint area of 12.3 ha. 

• An unlined DD, with a storage capacity of 4.7 million m3 and an area of 177.24 ha, consists 
of a maximum wall height of 10 m above NGL. 

• Associated infrastructure (i.e. slurry delivery line, storm water diversion trenches, toe 
drains, solution pipeline, silt traps, energy dissipator, and spillways). 

Figure 17-5 displays the general layout of the TSF.  

The zone of influence of a TD may be described as the extent of the area around it that may be 
affected with time taking into consideration possible impacts that may arise from the TD, e.g. flow 
slide, dust, surface and groundwater contamination, sterilisation of arable land etc. Based on the 
zone of influence assessment, the Massawa TD has been classified as a medium-hazard TD.

17.4.4. Seepage and Slope Stability Assessments 

Seepage and slope stability analysis was conducted on the TSF using the material parameters 
determined from the geotechnical investigations of the insitu and assumed assigned tailings 
parameters. The results of the seepage and slope stability analyses indicate that: 

• Operational drains and an operational liner have a significant impact on the position of 
the phreatic surface. 

• Non-functional drains or a punctured/torn HDPE liner decrease the stability of the TSF. 

• The slope stability FoS, probability of slope failure and reliability index, for the various 
departments meet or exceed the minimum requirements, under designed operational and 
upset conditions, namely: 

o A probability of failure and reliability index values less than 0.0007% (< 1:143,000) 
and greater than 4.35, respectively; 

o Deterministic minimum FoS as outlined in Table 17-13.

Notes: 
1 – Long term seepage includes steady seepage, maximum storage pool and spill way crest. 
2 – FoS = 1.1 for drawdown from the maximum surcharge pool. 
3 – FoS = 1.3 for drawdown from the maximum storage pool. 

17.4.5. Deterministic TSF Water Balance 

A TSF deterministic monthly water balance was developed in Microsoft Excel, based on average 
monthly, wettest year monthly, driest year monthly rainfall figures and average monthly 
evaporation figures and the simulated flow of water between the various facilities within the TSF 
over the operational LOM. The outcomes of the balance indicate the following: 

• The TSF water balance is both a positive and negative water balance in the sense that 
during the wet months excess water is discharged, whilst in the dry season water is 
required from alternative water sources to meet the plant's water requirements. 

• Overall, the balance indicates that there is sufficient water within the circuit and from the 
various sources to meet the plant's water requirements except for the month of May when 
approximately 120,000 m3 additional water needs to be sourced from a fresh water 
source, e.g. the open pit ground dewatering etc. This value is over and above the fixed 
fresh water requirement for the plant, i.e. 11%/23%/38% of the slurry water sent to the 
TSF, depending on which metallurgical process is operating at that time. 

• The DD discharges under steady state conditions annually but also runs dry/empty in the 
month of May of every year.

17.4.6. Estimation of Capital and Operational Cost  

The capital expenditure associated with the TSF has been determined to a Class 3 AACE 
accuracy of (+25%, -15%). The rates used were sourced from a recent project located in Guinea, 
which was on a tendered basis, undertaken in June 2018. 

• The total capital cost associated with the Massawa TSF has been determined as $31.16 
million. 

• For the duration of the construction of the TD and DD, a total capital cost of $0.6 million 
has been allowed for; this covers full time supervision and office support from the design 
engineer. This cost has not been incorporated in the total capital cost quoted above. 

• The total capital cost associated with the Massawa DD has been determined as $6.0 
million.

The operating costs associated with the TSF have been estimated at $7.6 million over the LOM, 
or a total of $0.76 million per annum. These operational costs include: 

• $0.7 million per annum for operational management, comprising a team leader/manager, 
a supervisor, unskilled labour, and a spares workshop. This team will be responsible for:  

o Depositional management. 
o Upstream day wall paddock packing and control of raising the TD. 
o Penstock management (increasing the rings, ensuring the sump does not 

discharge, sleeving of the penstock). 
o Maintaining the pool wall, catwalk, and access to the penstocks. 
o Maintenance and repairs to the slurry delivery pipeline and valves. 
o Monitoring and cleaning of the toe drains, leakage detection. 
o Return water pump monitoring/manhole drainage pump monitoring. 
o General maintenance (cleaning trenches, silt traps and the energy dissipator). 
o Monitoring various components (freeboard, drain flows, water returns, rainfall, 

tonnes deposited etc). 

• $0.06 million per annum for quarterly inspections, monitoring, and quarterly reports by the 
design engineer. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 255 

The TSF closure, rehabilitation, and aftercare of the TSF has been undertaken and assessed by 
Digby Wells. 

The total LOM cost associated with the TSF over the duration of the Project life has been 
estimated, at a net present value (NPV) of zero-discount rate, as $39.66 million. This includes 
detailed design of the TSF and construction supervision during the construction of the facility, a 
total of $0.9 million, but excludes the rehabilitation, closure, and post closure monitoring and of 
the TSF. 

17.4.7. Recommendations 

The following recommendations are proposed for consideration and evaluation during the 
detailed design of the TSF: 

• As the location of the RWD main wall was relocated post the test pits being finalised, 
additional test pits should be excavated and profiled prior to construction commencing to 
confirm the design depth of this facility etc. 

• The filter design of the elevated and NGL toe drain systems should be undertaken. 

• A geotechnical laboratory testing on a representative tailings sample is required to verify 
the strength parameters adopted during the FS design. 

• A more comprehensive bill of quantities (BOQ) should be developed and tendered 
Senegalese construction rates be obtained during the next phase of the Project to improve 
the confidence and accuracy of the capital cost estimate. 

• Various construction and operational QA/QC documentation, particular project 
specifications document, operational and inspection manuals for the TSF and DD should 
be developed.

be developed for the Project by Barrick as part of the environmental impact assessment. 

18.2.8. Raw Water Supply and Potable Water Distribution 

Raw Water Supply 

A water management model was developed for the site. The model was used to size the DD to 
supply the mine's raw water demands.  

The DD, located on the NE side of the Sofia North pit, is proposed for the supply of plant raw 
water and potable water. The maximum storage capacity required is estimated to be 706,264 m3. 

A pipeline conveying fourteen million litres of water per day from the raw water supply dam to the 
plant was designed. The pipeline length is approximately 9,000 m. The water is abstracted by 
means of a barge from the DD and discharged into the raw water pond at the plant. 

Potable Water Supply and Water Distribution in the Camps 

Staff Village and Office Complex Potable Water 

The staff village water treatment plant will supply potable water to the village and office complex 
buildings.  

Construction Camp Potable Water

18.4. Potential National Grid Power 

Although this FS assumed self-generation using HFO generator sets, there is a potential upside, 
where one could forego the capital investment associated with a local power plant and take 
advantage of Senegal's electrification expansion programme. Realistically this will only be 
available for Massawa from 2020 onwards; nevertheless, this warranted greater investigation and 
monitoring of the progress, since the potential beneficial effects for the Project are significant.  

Senegal's total installed energy generating capacity is approximately 1,000 MW of which the bulk 
is supplied via the national grid. La Société Nationale d'Électricité du Sénégal (SENELEC) owns 
most of the power stations while the remainder are private, either GTI-Dakar or ESKOM-
Manantali. SENELEC is a Senegalese company created in 1983 and is responsible for the 
generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electrical energy but also, identifies and 
finances new projects, where current initiatives could have a direct bearing on the Massawa 
Project. 

This section gives a brief description of the current status but also then provides some insight 
into the future anticipated projects to expand the national grid. 

18.4.1. Existing Power 

SENELEC 

As indicated below, most of the power is generated by diesel plants, while there are also gas, 
steam, and wind and solar power plants.  

A significant portion of the total installed capacity comes from other countries, such as the 60 
MW that Senegal uses of the 200 MW Manantali hydroelectric power plant across the border in 
Mali.  

The list and split of power attributed to SENELEC and to the other private providers is seen in 
Table 18-5. 

Table 18-5 Total Split of SENELEC Power 

Description Power (MW) % 
Inter-connected network 968.58 92.53 

Isolated 78.25 7.47 

Private Power Stations (IP)  

These consist of power plants belonging to private independent producers, industrialists, or 
entities providing energy to SENELEC through legal purchase contracts. 

18.4.2. Future Projects 

According to a presentation made by the Senegalese Energy authorities in May 2018, there is an 
already underway ambitious expansion of the grid network, such that more than 2,000 MW of 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 269 

generating capacity is envisaged being installed between 2017 and 2035. This is summarised in 
Table 18-6. 

Table 18-6 Proposed Future Power Installations 

Power Generation Type Installed Power (MW) 
Thermal (HFO & LFO) 240 

CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) 960 
Hydro-Electric 435 

Wind Farm 265 
Solar 265 

TOTAL 2,165 

Of special interest to Massawa is the plan for the Kedougou distribution which will reportedly be 
ready to tie-in to the national grid in Q1 2020, with power transmission lines already being 
installed. It is not yet known whether the closest or earliest grid connection will tie in to the OMVS 
grid from Manantali, which is waiting for a SENELEC interconnection to Tambacounda, or the 
OMVG interconnection from Kaolack to Kedougou, or the supply from Sambangalou to 
Tambacounda, presumably via Kedougou. 

18.4.3. Rates 

Massawa was provided with a generic tariff which is seen in Table 18-7, denoting pricing in both 
West African CFA franc (fcfa) plus expected resultant unit power costs in $. Of particular interest 
to Massawa is the medium-tension (MT) long-term rates or the high-tension (HT) general rates, 
which offer a distinct advantage over thermal power generation.

Tariff Special 74.16 106.78 4,206.24 $0.142 

18.4.4. Conclusion 

Further dialogue with the Senegalese authorities is anticipated to occur early in 2019, with 
Massawa intending to have direct representation. This should provide Massawa with a greater 
degree of confidence as to the positioning (offtake), source and cost of the power, including most 
importantly, the timing. Of additional pertinent interest is to understand the risk associated with 
the ability to receive a stable and consistent supply, which is critical for steady operational 
performance.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report

19. Market Studies and Contracts  

19.1 Markets 

The gold market is highly liquid and benefits from terminal markets (London, New York, Tokyo, 
and Hong Kong) on almost a continuous basis. Gold prices were in general downward trend from 
1980 to 2000 where gold traded down to approximately $250/oz. From 2000 the price increased 
annually until 2011 and 2012 where the price peaked at just under $1,800/oz. There was a sharp 
correction to the gold price in 2013 with the end of Quantitative Easing monetary policy by the 
US Reserve Bank.  Since then god has remained range bound between $1,350/oz and $1,050/oz.   

Gold produced at the mine site will be shipped from site, under secured conditions, to a refining 
company. Under proposed contractual conditions, the refiner purchases the gold from the mine 
with the proceeds automatically credited to the mine's bank account. 

Gold production will be sold on the spot market, with no plan currently to hedge any sales. 

19.2 Contracts 

It is Barrick strategy to outsource mining activities to contractors and in all instances ensure that 
the mining operation can purchase the equipment at the end of the contract period at its 
depreciated price or, should the contractor default, at a pre-determined pricing mechanism. Prior 
to start-up, all major mining contractors are requested to tender and the most appropriate tender 
is accepted, thereby ensuring that the best competitive current pricing is achieved. Care is taken 
at the time of finalizing contracts to ensure that the rise and fall formula is totally representative 
of the build-up of the quoted price per unit. At the time of award, prices quoted are compared to 
benchmark prices of other owner mine operations. 

The contract mining costs are highly dependent on when tenders are issued as the price of major 
equipment varies dependent on demand as well as the cost of finance. Rise and fall can be 
negatively affected by currency fluctuations as well as price squeeze due to scarcity. 

The mine will produce doré bars which will be sent to an accredited gold refinery for refining. For 
other operations, Barrick Africa and Middle East presently utilises the Rand Refinery in South 
Africa is used as it has been found to be the most competitively priced. 

Refining prices are subject to fluctuations in the cost of transport as well as insurance costs. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 271 

20. Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessment 

To exploit the mineralisation identified on the Project, Barrick is required to undertake an 
environmental impact study in accordance with Chapter 5 (Article 48) of the Environmental Act 
(Code de l'Environnement - Law (N° 2001-01 of 15th January 2001) and its implementing decree 
(Décret no 2001 – 282 du 12 avril 2001 portant application du code de l'environnement). For the 
FS, Randgold appointed Digby Wells Environmental (Jersey) Limited (Digby Wells) as the 
independent consultant to undertake an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
process for the Project in terms of the national Environmental Act and in accordance with 
international standards including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance 
Standards (PS). Digby Wells has undertaken the ESIA process with in-country partners, Tropica 
Environmental Consultants (Tropica). The partnership between Digby Wells and Tropica ensures 
that there is two-way knowledge transfer during the ESIA in terms of both international good 
practice and local expertise and knowledge. 

The main aim of the ESIA is to outline the Project activities and examine positive and negative 
environmental and social impacts that will be caused by the implementation of the Project. From 
this, the ESIA proposes mitigation/enhancement and management measures for such impacts 
to ensure that the Project is conducted in a manner that allows for future productive use of the 
land and a sustainable social environment following the conclusion of the mining operations. 

20.1. Description of the Project Areas Affected  

The Project will involve the development of open pits, predominantly known as Massawa NZ and 
Massawa CZ located to the east of the Project area as well as Sofia Main and Sofia North located 
to the west of the Project area, and the Delya satellite to the north. Additional satellite deposits 
are located throughout the permit area that may be exploited in the future. The depth of the open 
pits ranges between 70 m and 150 m. Holes will be drilled in targeted areas, and once drilled, the 
drill holes will be filled with explosives to blast overburden rock which lies above the gold ore as 
well as the ore itself. Once blasted, the overburden rock (waste rock) and subsequently gold ore 
can be removed. The waste rock will be transported to designated areas known as Waste Rock 
Dumps (WRDs) for storage. The gold ore removed will similarly be transported by truck to a 
designated area known as the ROM pad where it is temporarily stored before being placed into 
a primary crusher which breaks the ore into reduced pieces before the gold mineral can be 
extracted from the ore in the processing plant utilising various mechanical and chemical 
processes. Various supporting infrastructure including roads, offices, workshops, processing 
plant, and power infrastructure will be required to operate the mine. The mining operation will be 
carried out in three main phases to ensure that all required infrastructure, operational 
components, as well as the activities required to close-off the operation are in place. The phases 
consist of, but are not limited to, the following main activities: 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 272 

Construction Phase: 

• Site clearance and topsoil removal – the preparation of the site will include the removing 
of the vegetation cover and the top layer of soil on the direct footprint areas. 

• Topsoil stockpiling – the topsoil removed will be preserved in stockpiles for use during 
rehabilitation once mining is concluded. 

• Construction of mine related infrastructure – this includes mine housing camp, office 
buildings, haul roads transport people and material between the various areas, pipelines, 
dams which are required to manage water coming into and leaving the mining area, the 
processing plant where gold will be extracted from the ore removed from the open pits, 
as well as storage, workshop, and power facilities. 

Operational Phase: 

• Removal of waste rock - once overburden rock is reached, drilling and blasting will need 
to be undertaken to break the rock material. The waste rock will then be removed from 
the area to expose the targeted ore.  

• Loading, hauling, and stockpiling of waste rock – waste rock removed will be transported 
on the haul roads via truck to designated WRDs. 

• Mining gold ore – similar to the removal of waste rock, this consists of drilling and blasting 
of the ore material for its removal. 

• Load, haul, and stockpiling of ROM ore – the ore will be removed from the pits and 
transported on the haul roads via truck to the ROM pad where it will be temporarily stored 
and subsequently fed into a crusher and mill to break the ore into smaller pieces that can 
be put through the processing plant. 

• Processing plant – once crushed the ore will be transported to the processing plant where 
mechanical and chemical processes will be utilised to extract gold from the ore. 

• Disposal of residue tailings material from the processing plant onto the TSF via pipeline 
– once the gold is extracted from the ore, the remaining material, which will be in slurry 
(semi-liquid mixture) form known as residue tailings, will need to be disposed of. A TSF 
will be constructed as gold processing progresses. The residue tailings will be transported 
via pipeline in their slurry form from the processing plant to the TSF. Once disposed of, 
the slurry will dry and eventually result in a residue tailings stockpile. 

• Water use and storage on site – during the operation, water will be required for various 
domestic and industrial uses. Dams will be constructed that capture water from the mining 
area, which will be stored and used accordingly. 

• Storage, handling, and treatment of hazardous products (including fuel, explosives, and 
oil) and waste – hazardous products will be utilised for machinery and power generation 
for the various activities during operations. Furthermore, domestic and hazardous waste 
will be generated which together with the hazardous products must be handled carefully 
and strategically to prevent pollution. 

• Maintenance activities – through the operations, maintenance will need to be undertaken 
to ensure that all infrastructure is operating optimally and does not pose a threat to human 
or environmental health. Maintenance will include haul roads, pipelines, processing plant, 
machinery, water and storm water management infrastructure, stockpile areas, and the 
TSF. 

Decommissioning and Rehabilitation Phase: 

• Demolition and removal of infrastructure – once mining activities have been concluded, 
infrastructure will be demolished in preparation of the final land rehabilitation. It should be 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 273 

noted that some infrastructure such as buildings may remain in agreement for future land 
users. Furthermore, the TSF, WRDs, and open pits will remain but will be rehabilitated to 
ensure a stable and safe state to prevent future negative impacts as much as possible. 

• Rehabilitation – rehabilitation mainly consists of spreading of the preserved subsoil and 
topsoil, profiling of the land, and re-vegetation. 

• Post-closure monitoring and rehabilitation – given the extent of disturbance that will be 
caused by the operation, monitoring of specific environmental aspects such as surface 
and groundwater water that could potentially be contaminated from the open pits, WRDs 
and seepage from the TSF, the success of vegetation establishment and the general site 
status will need to be undertaken to ensure that no further impacts to the natural and 
social environment will be experienced. 

The operational phase of the Project is expected to run over a 10-year period with a total of 
18.8 Mt ore and 137 Mt of waste mined during this time.  

20.2. Relevant Policies, Legislation, and Institutional Framework 

Similar to many other industrial projects, the extraction of minerals results in a number of 
environmental impacts that must be addressed during the life of the Project. The actions 
associated with construction, installation, operational, and decommissioning phases of the 
Project, have various positive and negative environmental impacts. While the resulting negative 
impacts must be addressed so as to maintain the integrity of the environment, Barrick must also 
ensure compliance to various policies and/or legal frameworks that govern the management of 
the environment.  

As indicated above, the ESIA has been completed in accordance with the Environmental Act 
(Code de l'Environnement - Law (N° 2001-01 of 15th January 2001) and its implementing decree 
(Décret no 2001 – 282 du 12 avril 2001 portant application du code de l'environnement). Other 
applicable legislation includes the following: 

• Mining Code Law No. 2003-36 of 24th November 2003 and updated with Mining Code 
Law No. 27/2016 of 30th October 2016. 

• Water Code Law No. 81-13 of 4th March 1981. 

• The Forestry Code Law No. 98-03 of 8th January 1998. 

• Hunting and Protection of Fauna Code Law No. 86-04 of 24th January 1986. 

• Water Treatment Code Law No. 2009-24 of 8th July 2009. 

• Law n° 96-06 of 22nd March 1996 Local Authorities (full jurisdiction in terms of waste 
management). 

• Atmospheric Emissions standard NS 05-062 of December 2004. 

Furthermore, the Project aims to also demonstrate compliance with international standards such 
as the IFS PS on Environmental and Social Sustainability. The IFC PS comprise eight quality 
standards which the project developer is required to meet throughout the project life which pertain 
to various environmental and social aspects. International best practice will be utilised to 
complement Senegalese legislation and not replace it.

20.3. Project Baseline Conditions 

The Project is located in the SE portion of Senegal within the Kédougou Region between the 
villages of Kédougou and Bembou, Mako and Khossanto. Dakar, the capital of Senegal, is 
approximately 700 km NW of the Project area. Regionally, the Sofia deposit is located 
approximately 45 km north of the town of Kédougou, with the nearest town of Tinkoto located 6 
km south of the Massawa deposit. The Peulh and Malinke villages of Mandakholé and 
Kanoumering are both situated 15 km to the northeast and southwest of the Massawa deposit 
respectively. The Faleme River marks the international border with Mali and is located 75 km 
east of the Project area. Downstream of the proposed Project area, the Niokolo-Koba River flows 
through the Niokolo-Koba National Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Site (approximately 15 km west of the Project area). 

The site is in a largely undeveloped rural area surrounded by informal (artisanal) mining activities, 
communities in small towns and villages founded on the mining legacy of the area. The common 
land uses in the Project surroundings are subsistence agriculture, animal rearing, vegetable 
gardening, and artisanal mining.  

The soils found in the Project area are shallow resulting in low agricultural potential, which is best 
suited for grazing practices. The land cover within the Project area is dominated by low shrubland, 
a mixture of low shrubland/savannah is found in the flatter, low-lying areas, while the savannah 
class dominates the hillier areas in the NE, as well as in the far south of the licence area. The 
low agricultural/land capability is echoed in the fertility status of the soils. The fertility status of the 
soils is acidic and, to achieve full cropping potential, the soils would require lime to counteract 
acidity, as well as supplemented by nitrate, potash, and phosphate fertiliser.  

In terms of terrestrial biodiversity, the proposed Project is located in a largely natural undisturbed 
environment. The larger study area is currently under pressure from existing anthropogenic land 
use including grazing, wood collection, and artisanal mining from surrounding villages. The 
general health of the natural habitat, however, is diverse and of high value, therefore should be 
conserved. Several protected plant and animal species and Species of Special Concern (SSC) 
were identified within the Project area, including the endangered Western Chimpanzee. The 
Project area is in close proximity of the Niokola-Koba National Park where many protected 
species may be recorded which extend into the general area. The Project area is also 
characterised by sensitive wetland ecosystem which currently has minimal disturbance. Further 
chimpanzee baseline studies are being undertaken to determine the home and core ranges of 
the respective communities. 

The Project is located in the upper reaches of the Niokolo-Koba River catchment, approximately 
34 km upstream of the Niokolo-Koba National Park. The status of the main streams within the 
Project area is largely natural with neutral, fast-flowing ephemeral streams, which are largely free 
of clear signs of contamination and/or notable anthropogenic impacts, which is believed to be 
driven by the limited surrounding land-use activities and the limited accessibility. Due to the highly 
dynamic flow regime observed within the area, the macroinvertebrate assemblages present 
within the study area were largely dominated by tolerant, pioneering taxa with a moderate 
tolerance to water quality impairment and a preference for submerged marginal vegetation

23rd July 2019  Page 275 

habitats. On the other hand, representative fish species were collected across a variety of 
habitats during the wet season, which suggested favourable conditions and a potential 
underestimation of the fish assemblage diversity, as demonstrated by the low abundances 
observed over a high-density river network. 

In terms of groundwater, monitoring data shows that the baseline groundwater quality is generally 
suitable for drinking with limited parameters (namely pH, arsenic, and lead) exceeding the World 
Health Organisation (WHO). The elevated arsenic levels are suspected to be a result of natural 
dissolution of the host rocks. The water level in most of the boreholes was found to fluctuate 
seasonally. This indicates that the shallow weathered aquifer is mainly unconfined and is 
susceptible to climatic conditions. 

An environmental noise impact assessment was conducted and baseline noise levels were 
benchmarked against the IFC guideline limits for disturbing noise. The baseline ambient day and 
night time soundscape generally exceeds IFC guidelines. The relatively excessive levels were 
mainly due to intermittent motorbikes passing through, with bird song from the various avifauna 
and socialising activities by the villagers during the daytime and insect noise during the night 
time.  

In terms of air quality, the South African National Dust Control Regulation (NDCS), 2013 were 
utilised to evaluate the baseline air quality associated with the Project area. The dust deposition 
data from 2010 to 2015 shows that the ambient environment is not pristine, due to the levels of 
dust measured. During dry season months (November to May), monitoring records revealed 
some exceedance of the Residential Limit (600 µg/m3). 

A heritage survey and assessment was conducted through which several heritage resources 
were identified with a Cultural Significance range from negligible to very high. These heritage 
resources consist of sacred sites; archaeological metalworking sites; archaeological sites and 
features; and isolated finds – ceramic and lithic scatters. 

20.4. Assessment of Impacts 

The proposed Project is located in a largely natural undisturbed environment and the general 
health of the natural habitat is diverse and of high conservation value. The Project area is 
characterised by a sensitive wetland ecosystem which currently has minimal disturbance. The 
proposed Project will result in the direct loss of approximately 370 ha of wetland area as a result 
of infrastructure development, which has been deemed a major impact. Further indirect loss of 
wetlands is expected downstream of the Project site due to altered hydrology mainly as a result 
of the construction of the diversion dam on the Niokolo-Koba River. The diversion dam 
development will have a major impact on surface water, namely loss of water quantity required 
to sustain floodplains downstream the proposed diversion dam. The diversion dam inundation 
may impact on the wetland systems and ecological functions, aquatic ecology, and potential 
biodiversity between the Project area and the Niokolo-Koba National Park. 

Further chimpanzee baseline studies are being undertaken in the Project areas to determine the 
number of chimpanzee groups, the sizes of the chimpanzee groups, and their respective home 
and core ranges. Potential impacts on chimpanzee groups, and the respective mitigation 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 276 

measures will be determined as part of these studies and incorporated into a Biodiversity Action 
Plan. 

Another major impact identified is the potential migration into the surrounding area. The proposed 
Project is likely to result in the expansion of the local population around the villages and artisanal 
mining sites; this induced impact will further expand the extent of disturbance and consequently 
direct impacts to the natural habitat. 

In addition, the proximity of the Niokolo-Koba National Park is noteworthy. The national park is 
located more than 15 km from the proposed infrastructure area and as such no direct impacts 
are anticipated. However, indirect and/or induced adverse impacts may occur. This will mainly 
be a result of the necessity to divert and dam water from the main stem of the Niokolo-Koba River 
to facilitate access to the Sofia deposits which is likely to affect local streamflows and sediment 
regimes that may extend up to the Niokolo-Koba National Park. Furthermore, a limited potential 
exists for nuisance impacts (visual, air quality, and noise) as a result of the Project activities and 
the induced impact of influx on the surrounding area to occur. 

Of the most significant potential impacts identified, the following require mitigation and constant 
monitoring: 

• Habitat and biodiversity loss (for both terrestrial and aquatic) and the disturbances to 
fauna; 

• Decreased volume of run-off reporting to downstream rivers and reduced quantity of 
groundwater as a water resource for communities and Niokolo-Koba National Park use 
and support to ecosystems; 

• Loss of wetland areas (total wetland loss of 371.3 ha of which 7.2 ha is direct loss 
associated with the mine pits) as well as fragmentation of riverine corridors, erosion, 
sedimentation, and altered wetland Present Ecological State; 

• Direct disturbance of heritage resources;  

• Potential influx into the local area as a result of the Project's presence which will likely 
intensify the existing artisanal mining operations as well as social ills associated with 
increased economic and social activity in the local area;  

• Pressure placed on existing socio-economic infrastructures which were found to be 
limited within the local area. 

With respect to the existing socio-economic conditions, the establishment of the mine will 
necessitate the occupation of land which is mostly virgin land. Therefore, although a loss of 
livelihood is anticipated, this impact has not been deemed as highly significant.  

As indicated above, the establishment of the mine is expected to result in an influx of people into 
the area. This comprises people who are seeking opportunities directly from the mining activities 
and those attracted to the area as a result of the socio-economic improvements that will occur as 
a result of the presence of the mine. The mine will have positive impacts on both local and the 
wider regional economy as the mine will empower local communities through employment, use 
of local goods and services, as well as the establishment of Community Development Plan which 
will result in improvements of socio-economic infrastructure and skills development. On the other 
hand, however, these improvements which will lead to migration into the area will potentially also 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 277 

result in related negative socio-economic impacts including pressure on existing infrastructure, 
degradation of local customs and mixing of cultures which may have negative influences, health 
and safety related issues related to increased social ills. As such, the positive socio-economic 
aspects and improvements need to be closely managed to counter the potential offset of negative 
impacts associated with increased economic activity. 

Furthermore, rehabilitation activities have also been prescribed which fundamentally aim to 
ensure that the natural and social environment can progressively be managed in a manner that 
allows sustainable productive land uses and communities following the completion of mining 
activities. 

20.5. Mitigation Measures 

Mitigation measures proposed are cognisant of the mitigation hierarchy which is international 
best practice for managing risks and impacts, and is listed by the IFC as the primary objective of 
in IFC PS 1 as follows:  

To adopt a mitigation hierarchy to anticipate and avoid, or where avoidance is not 
possible, minimize, and, where residual impacts remain, compensate/offset for risks and 
impacts to workers, Affected Communities, and the environment.  

This mitigation hierarchy is as shown in Figure 20-1. 

 

Figure 20-1 The Mitigation Hierarchy as Defined by the IFC 

Not all of the potential negative impacts identified can be avoided, and as such mitigation 
measures have been provided to minimise the significance of the impacts as far as possible. This 
includes the development and implementation of various action, monitoring, and management 
plans/procedures which are to be utilised throughout the operations.

Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report

An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) as well as an associated monitoring 
programme has been developed as a tool which will be utilised to manage and mitigate as far as 
possible against the identified potential adverse environmental impacts associated with each 
phase of the proposed Project. The ESMP can also be used as a tool to enhance the possible 
benefit that can come as a result of the mine development. 

Furthermore, it is recommended that the Sofia pit WRD be moved to the east of the pit if possible 
while the Massawa pit WRD be moved to the west of the pit and out of the natural drainage lines 
of the systems present. Where possible, remaining infrastructure locations such as the camp 
area, mine offices, and the plant area (all affecting category B wetlands) should be optimised.  

20.6. Rehabilitation and Closure Plan 

The preliminary Rehabilitation and Closure Plan for the Project is presented in the report and has 
been prepared with the aim of ensuring that the area is sustainable in the long term from an 
environmental and social point of view. 

The following points outline the main objectives for rehabilitation and closure at the proposed 
Project: 

• Return impacted land to a sustainable land use in agreement with the current landowner 
or end land user. 

• Remove mining infrastructure that cannot be used by a subsequent land owner or a third 
party. Where buildings can be used by a third party, agreements must be put in place to 
ensure their long-term sustainable use. 

• Manage the impact of physical effects and chemical contaminants on the environment 
such that the environmental quality is not adversely affected after closure. 

• Follow a process of closure that is progressive and integrated into the short- and long-
term plans and that will assess the closure impacts proactively at regular intervals 
throughout the Project life.  

• Start implementing progressive/concurrent rehabilitation measures wherever possible as 
soon as the operational phase commences.  

• Leave a safe and stable environment for both humans and animals and make their 
condition sustainable.  

• Prevent soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination by managing water on site. 

• Ensure monitoring and maintenance of vegetation on all rehabilitated areas. 

• Comply with national closure and rehabilitation regulatory requirements. 

• Follow an appropriate stakeholder engagement process with all interested and affected 
parties (I&APs) and authorities. 

20.7. Project Stakeholders and their Involvement in ESIA 

Forty-four meetings were organised with village communities, institutions, technical services, and 
NGOs between 30th July and 7th September 2018. The presentation was used as a script for the 
Stakeholder Engagement meetings; however, select meetings were altered to focus the 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 279 

discussion based on the aspects that most affected the stakeholder. Key concerns raised are 
summarised as follows: 

• The need for local employment and training, with focus on the youth and woman; 
• Infrastructure and local economic development and improvement; 
• Continued inclusive communication and fulfilment of commitments; 
• Concern over potential economic and physical displacement and the impact on 

livelihoods, particularly orpaillage; 
• Protection of the environment:  

o Potential contamination of water sources from mineral and hazardous waste; 
o Management and conservation of biodiversity. 

20.8. Concluding Statement 

From the information gathered during the ESIA study, it can be concluded that the Project will 
have adverse environmental and social impacts. The key impacts include direct loss of wetland 
habitat and the reduction of water quantity particularly downstream of the proposed diversion 
dam. Impacts associated with the diversion dam include loss of wetland systems (through 
desiccation and inundation) and ecological functions and loss of aquatic ecology and biodiversity 
between the Project area and the Niokolo-Koba National Park. In addition, the Project is likely to 
result in the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat of high conservation value, along with 
environmental and social impacts associated with potential population influx resulting in 
increased pressure on natural resources and increased associated social ills in the local area. 

The endangered Western Chimpanzee was identified in the Project area. Continued studies are 
being undertaken to determine the chimpanzee communities, number of individuals and the 
respective core and home ranges. These baseline studies will determine the level of impact from 
the Project, as well as the mitigation and management measures required as part of a Biodiversity 
Action Plan. 

The mitigation measures and management plans have been developed which, if correctly 
implemented and monitored, can reduce the significance of the impacts. Subsequently, 
successful rehabilitation and sustainable post-closure land uses are possible. Extensive 
stakeholder engagement has been undertaken and will continue throughout the Project life. The 
Project is expected to create job opportunities for local communities, assist in social upliftment 
through community based projects and skills development, as well as contribute to formalising 
mining activities in the area in a manner that exercises duty of care to the natural and social 
environment. 

For this Project to be successful from an environmental and social perspective, the following key 
commitments must be made by Barrick: 

• Ensure continuous monitoring as per the monitoring programme of the following: 

o Surface water. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019  Page 280 

o Groundwater. 
o Dust and air quality. 
o Biodiversity. 
o Soils. 
o Wetlands. 
o Biomonitoring. 

• Develop and continuously maintain storm water management structures to ensure 
effective clean and dirty water separation. 

• Develop and implement environmental action plans to management potential adverse 
impacts and unplanned environmental incidents. 

• Undertake training and environmental awareness of mine personnel, contractors, and 
surrounding communities. 

• Manage soil erosion and establishment of alien species timeously. 

• Undertake concurrent rehabilitation throughout the Project life where possible and 
maintain soil stockpiles for final rehabilitation. 

• Continuously engage with stakeholders during operations and during closure planning as 
well as implement a suitable grievance mechanism. 

• Report and record all monitoring data which should be utilised to identify areas of potential 
improvements. Furthermore, periodic internal and external audits of the ESMP should be 
undertaken, and amendment should be made where necessary in consultation with 
government authorities.

21. Capital and Operating Costs 

21.1. Capital Costs  

SENET was commissioned to conduct a capital cost estimate study for the proposed Project.  

The capital programme is broken into a number of phases with each phase employing additional 
processing units and technology to optimally recover the gold content.  

• Phase 1: Initial capital to construct the mine and treat oxide and oxidised transition is 
expended over the first two years of the Project. 

• Phase 2: Fresh ore from Sofia and CZ deposits commences. The processing of Sofia 
fresh ore will continue as per the Phase 1 leach and detoxification process. CZ ore will be 
processed through a gravity circuit prior to CIL.  

• Phase 3: Construction of the BIOX circuit takes place in year six which will be designed 
to process the sulphide material in the northern part of the CZ, NZ, and Delya pits.  

Table 21-1 lists the capital cost estimate by phase.

21.2. Operating Costs  

21.2.1. Mining and Haul Operating Costs  

It is planned to contract out the mining services for Massawa. Randgold has used various mining 
contractors over the last 20 years in West Africa and the first round of the tender process has 
been completed where four companies have been selected to proceed through to the second 
and final round. The tenders received have given a good indication of the expected mining cost 
as well the size of equipment and fleet to be implemented at Massawa. The contractor mining 
activities at Massawa will include GC drilling, drill and blast, load and haul, and crusher feeding.  

The potential of owner mining is not excluded for consideration at a later date, however, for the 
purposes of the FS, it has been assumed that a mining contractor will do the mining at Massawa. 
The impact of the owner mining approach is that the open pit operation incurs higher capital costs 
and reduced operating costs primarily due to the outright purchase of mobile mining equipment 
and absence of contractor's profit margin and financing cost. Randgold has made a successful 
transition to owner mining at the Loulo underground operations and therefore has the knowledge 
and experience to transition to owner mining at Massawa if and when appropriate. 

Mining operating costs are based on contractor mining as shown in Table 21-3, Table 21-4, and 
Table 21-5.

A total of 3.55 Mt of ore will be hauled from the Sofia pit to the ROM pad at Massawa. The hauling 
cost has been calculated at $3.20/t hauled. This amounts to a total of $11.35 million over the 
LOM based upon existing contracts from other Barrick's operating mines in West Africa.  

21.2.2. Process Operating Costs  

SENET was commissioned to conduct a cost estimate study for the proposed Project. All the 
deposits were considered: Massawa CZ, Massawa MZ, Sofia Main, Sofia North, and Delya, thus 
the process operating cost estimate was split by the various ore types as shown in Table 21-6.

The process operating costs were generated based on the various process routes possibly 
required. 

21.2.3. G&A Costs  

General and administration (G&A) costs cover all operational costs outside of mining and 
processing. They include administrative, finance, medical, environmental, and social costs, 
together with outside engineering which covers all engineering costs outside of the processing 
plant. Table 21-7 is a summary of the G&A costs estimated for the first six years, followed by the 
final three years of production at Massawa. The model equates to $8.60/t of ore processed over 
the LOM. This correlates well on a gross level to Barrick's Tongon Mine, which is also a West 
African coastal country operation.

22. Economic Analysis 

22.1. Basis of the Economic Analysis 

An economic assessment to confirm the reserve status of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya pits 
was carried out based on the key parameters summarised below: 

• Total ore mined from Massawa, Sofia Main, and Delya pits of 18 Mt of ore at an average 
grade of 4.2 g/t Au containing 2.4 Moz of gold. 

• Strip ratio of 7.6:1 to give total tonnes mined of 156 Mt. 

• Mining costs average of $3.55/t mined over the LOM. 

• Haulage cost average of $1.20/t of ore milled over the LOM ($0.18/t km hauled). 

• Plant cost average of $21.33/t ore but includes a range of costs dependant on ore feed 
and process route. 

• G&A costs of $8.76/t ore milled over the LOM, including outside engineering costs. 

• Pre-production related capital amounts $16.9 million. $80 million will be spent on pre-
production mining and absorbed in Total Cash Cost as the ore is fed. 

• Capital construction cost of $413 million.  

• On-going capital of $12 million over the LOM. 

• Rehabilitation cost of $23 million at the end of the LOM. 

The financial model is based on annual cash flow projections, with technical and economic 
parameters stated above using constant money terms. No escalation or de-escalation has been 
applied. In generating the financial model for the operations and project, the following principles 
were adopted:  

• Financial implication on the methods of funding was not evaluated, since it has been 
assumed the Project will be financed by Barrick. 

• Annual figures are based on financial years 1st January to 31st December. 

• Real term annual cash flows were used to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR), net 
present values (NPV), and simple and discounted payback periods in real after-tax terms. 

• Costs up to start of construction are considered as sunk costs. 

• No salvage value for plant and equipment on cessation of operations was included. 

• Calculations are based in US dollars ($). 

22.2. Production and Cash Flow Forecast  

The estimated production and cash flow forecast are summarised in Table 22-1.

22.3. Financial Analysis 

A financial model was run using a $1,000/oz gold price feeding the reserve mining schedule, 
together with a 3% royalty on revenue, seven-year tax holiday (two year construction, five years 
for operation), followed by corporate tax at a 25% rate, which produced a total net cash flow after 
tax of $258 million, and IRR of 12%. Payback is five years from start of production. A sensitivity 
table on NPV, IRR, and payback against gold price is supplied in Table 22-2. The Project is 
profitable at $1,000/oz and thus justified to be reported as an Ore Reserve at $1,000/oz gold 
price.

IRR 12% 25% 37% 
Payback 5 years 2.8 years 2.4 years 

22.4. Government Revenue 

The government revenue earnings from the Project are sourced from the following assumptions 
incorporated into the financial model: 

• 3% royalty on revenue; 

• Tax rate of 25%. Payments are made throughout the year after the seven-year tax holiday 
from issuance of the mining permit. 

• Dividends from 10% free carry share of the Project, which are payable after capital has 
been redeemed. 

• Other taxes which include withholding taxes on dividends and salaries.  

Under the current Kounemba Convention, Barrick will be exempt from all taxes, levies, and duties 
for a period of seven years from issuance of the mining title.  

A sensitivity of expected government revenue based on the cash flow is detailed in Table 22-3.

22.5. Sensitivity Analysis 

22.5.1. Discount Rate and Gold Price 

The proposed Project is profitable at current gold prices, but it is sensitive to gold price 
fluctuations and therefore becomes a marginal project at gold prices lower than $1,000/oz, but 
very attractive at current or higher gold prices (Table 22-4).

25% (141)  (93)  (46) 0  47  94  140  

22.5.2. Grade and Gold Price 

The Project is fairly resilient to grade changes and at current gold prices would be able to absorb 
a 10% reduction in grade (Table 22-5). The Project is sensitive to gold price fluctuations with a 
$1,000/oz and a 20% reduction in grade making the Project very marginal. Conversely, at higher 
gold prices than current, the Project is very resilient to a grade reduction. 

Table 22-5 NPV at 20% Grade Variation at Different Gold Prices

22.5.3. Operating Cost and Gold Price 

At current gold prices, the Project can absorb a 20% increase in operating costs and still remains 
largely profitable (Table 22-6). The Project will require a gold price of less than $1,000/oz and an 
increase of 20% in operating costs to become a marginal project.

22.5.4. Capital and Gold Price 

The Project is sensitive to increases in capital cost (Table 22-7). At a $1,000/oz gold prices, an 
increase of 10% on capital reduces the NPV by $42 million, or 16% of the NPV.

23. Adjacent Properties 

23.1. Sabodala Gold Mine 

The Sabodala Gold Mine, owned by Teranga, is located adjacent to the Kanoumba Permit, 
approximately 20 km NW of Massawa (Figure 23-1). Sabodala reported June 2017 Proven and 
Probable Open Pit Reserves, including stockpiles, of 59.5 Mt at 1.23 g/t Au for 2.36 Moz of 
contained Au, plus Probable Underground Reserves of 2.15 Mt at 5.01 g/t Au for 0.35 Moz. 
Measured and Indicated Resources were reported at 86.0 Mt at 1.59 g/t Au for 4.44 Moz of 
contained Au, and an Inferred Resource of 17.25 Mt at 1.81 g/t Au for 1.0 Moz (Teranga, RPA 
Report August 2017). Resources are inclusive of reserves. These resources and reserves mainly 
consist of open pit, although underground and stockpile material are also included in the total. 
The Sabodala mining concession consists of multiple ore bodies, although to date the majority of 
the treated ore has been sourced from the Sabodala, Masato, Gora, and Golo0075ma deposits.  

The Sabodala deposits are located along the same first-order shear zone (Sabodala Shear Zone) 
that hosts the Sofia deposit approximately 20 km to the south. The shear zone is approximately 
2 km wide and is identified by a subtle magnetic trend that extends through the 7 km long permit 
and transects the Mako belt stratigraphy. Similar to Sofia, deposit geology consists of andesitic 
volcanics and volcaniclastics, gabbro sills, and quartz-feldspar sills/dykes with gold mineralization 
spatially linked to the intrusive rocks.   

23.2. Makabingui Gold Project 

The Makabingui exploration project, owned by Bassari Resources Limited (Bassari), is located 
approximately 25 km NE of Massawa Figure 23-1. Makabingui currently hosts an open pit Mineral 
Resource which comprises 11.9 Mt at 2.6 g/t Au for a contained 1 Moz of gold, and a maiden Ore 
Reserve of 0.9 Mt at 5.7 g/t Au for 158 koz Au (Bassari, 2016). Regionally, Makabingui is located 
in the Diale-Dalema sedimentary basin to the east of the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone which 
hosts Massawa. The deposit is hosted in gabbros in a pressure shadow along the southern 
margin of the Sambarabougou Granite. Exploration is also focussed on a NE trending structural 
zone termed the Lafia Shear Zone which is situated both to the NE and SW of Makabingui.  

23.3. Mako Project  

The Mako project is located to the south of the Kanoumba Permit (Figure 23-1), and is owned by 
private exploration and development company Toro Gold Limited (Toro Gold). Toro Gold reported 
a 2016 Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve of 14.2 Mt at 2.25 g/t Au for 1 Moz and Measured, 
Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources of 22.93 Mt at 1.86 g/t Au for 1.37 Moz. Production 
started at the Mako project in January 2018.

24. Other Relevant Data and Information 

24.1. Project Implementation 

24.1.1. Implementation Strategy 

The FS capital cost estimate has been compiled on the basis that Barrick will adopt an 
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM) approach to implementing 
and executing the Project.  

Upon the onset of the Project and following a formal EPCM Contractor tender, selection, and 
award process to be conducted by Barrick, some 1st Phase early project execution activities may 
take place such as front-end engineering and design (FEED) of critical deliverables, which can 
commence in the first quarter of 2019 as Project approval is expected from both the Senegal 
government and the Barrick Board before June 2019. 

The implementation strategy to be adopted is generally structured into four broad stages 
undertaken by the successful EPCM Contractor under the direct auspices of Barrick: 

• Detailed design of the process plant and infrastructure whereby the FS capital cost 
estimate (CCE) is further developed into a Barrick approved and EPCM controlled budget 
estimate (CBE) for the Project going forward during execution.   

• Procurement comprising formal tender, adjudication, award and thereafter fabrication and 
expediting with logistics undertaken by the Barrick nominated logistics supplier.   

• Construction management and cost control.  

• Commissioning management and handover to operations. 

24.1.2. Implementation Budget Control 

Budget control will be performed by the nominated EPCM's Cost Controller with the EPCM 
Project Manager being ultimately responsible for the accuracy and control of the approved 
budget. Cost control at the construction site will be done by the site based Cost Controller 
supported by the Quantity Surveyors.  

All orders will be signed off by the EPCM Cost Controller, before being signed off by the EPCM 
Project Manager and approved by Barrick before processing further.  

24.1.3. Implementation Teams 

The project implementation teams are sub-divided as follows: 

• Head Office Based EP Team. 

• Site Based Barrick and EPCM Team. 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 293 

24.1.4. Head Office Based EP Contractor Team 

The nominated EPCM Contractor will manage its own head office based engineering and 
procurement (EP) team, including contract management with direct input from Barrick Owners 
Team as required for the Project. The scope of services for the EP works shall include the 
following: 

• Detailed engineering design. 

• Project engineering and drawings. 

• QA/QC. 

• Cost management. 

• Procurement, contracts administration and management of subcontractors. 

• Quality inspections and expediting (logistics/shipping by others). 

• Project planning and scheduling. 

• Project reporting (to include progress and performance measurement and any scheduled 
or event-driven risks). 

• Document control systems. 

• Project standards, specifications, and systems. 

• Recommendation and procurement of mechanical spare parts, consumables, reagents, 
and lubrication first fills. 

24.1.5. Site Based Barrick and EPCM Contractor Team 

The site based Barrick Owners Team and EPCM Contractor will jointly perform the construction 
and commissioning management as required for the Project. The scope of services for the CM 
works shall include the following: 

• Site QA/QC; 

• Site cost management; 

• Site project planning and scheduling; 

• Site project reporting (to include progress and performance measurement and any 
scheduled or event-driven risks); 

• Site document control systems; 

• Site materials control; 

• Site construction management; 

• Snagging, commissioning, and final handover to operations. 

24.1.6. Implementation Schedule 

The Project will be executed over three different phases at estimated durations apart from one 
another. The various project execution schedules reflect the work required from detailed design 
and engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the following work packages:  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 294 

Phase 1: 

• Metallurgical process plant. 

• Morila plant relocation and refurbishment. 

• Raw and process water ponds. 

• Airstrip. 

Phase 2: 

• Secondary crushing and stockpiling. 

• Pre-leach thickening, tails thickening and process water clarifier. 

• Morila plant relocation and refurbishment. 

Phase 3: 

• BIOX circuit and associated infrastructure. 

The work packages are detailed in the Project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with final 
handover to Barrick to start with operation and production. 

The project schedules assume that there will be a seamless advancement of the Project between 
the various phases of the Project evolution. It is also recognised that the schedules are very 
aggressive and that it will require diligent progress and coordination of all the parties involved.   

The summarised project schedules for the various phases are shown in Figure 24-1, Figure 24-2, 
and Figure 24-3 respectively.

24.2. Alternate Case - Ore Reserves and Economics at $1,200/oz Gold 
Price 

24.2.1. Ore Reserve Summary at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

Historically Barrick estimates its Ore Reserves using a gold price assumption of $1,200/oz. In 
order to investigate the effect on the Massawa Gold Project of using a $1,200/oz gold price, an 
alternate case has been prepared which results in the following upsides to the Project: 

• A reduction in the cut-off grade results in an increase in the total Ore Reserves at a slightly 
lower grade, thus extending the mine life by 1.5 years. 

• The size of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya pits is increased by 6%. 
• The increase in the total Ore Reserves results in a more efficient use of capital as the 

capital construction cost is expended over more tonnes. 

For the alternate case the Ore Reserve was rerun at a gold price of $1,200/oz. No changes have 
been made to the mining dilution, ore loss, or gold recovery between the base case and the 
alternate case. For the alternate case, the cut-off grade for each of the deposits was re-estimated 
based on the higher gold price. A life of mine plan for the alternate case was determined based 
on the $1,200/oz Ore Reserve.  

The 2018 Ore Reserve estimate for the alternate case at a $1,200/oz gold price includes an open 
pit (OP) Probable Ore Reserve of 7.8 Mt at 4.6 g/t Au for 1.2 Moz Au from the Massawa CZ; 5.2 
Mt at 4.7 g/t Au for 0.8 Moz Au from the Massawa NZ; 7.1 Mt at 2.7 g/t Au for 0.6 Moz Au for 
Sofia; and 0.81 Mt at 4.21 g/t Au for 0.11 Moz for Delya. The OP Ore Reserves are those reserves 
occurring within a $1,200/oz pit design. 

Total Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Ore Reserve estimates, as of 31st December 2018 within a 
$1,200/oz OP, are presented in Table 24-1.

*Attributable gold (Moz) refers to the quantity attributable to Barrick based on Barrick's 83.25% interest in the Massawa Project. Open 
pit Ore Reserves are reported at a gold price of $1,200/oz and include dilution and ore loss factors. Open pit Ore Reserves were 
generated by Shaun Gillespie, an employee of the company Table 24-1, under the supervision of Rodney Quick, MSc, Pr Sci Nat, an 
officer of the company and Qualified Person. 

A financial model was run on the alternate case using a $1,200/oz gold price feeding the 
alternative case reserve mining schedule, together with a 3% royalty on revenue, seven-year tax 
holiday (two year construction, five years for operation), followed by corporate tax at a 25% rate, 
which produced a total net cash flow after tax of $696 million, and IRR of 28%. Payback is 2.5

24.2.2. Dilution 

The mining dilution was assumed to be 10% of additional waste for each tonne of ore in Massawa 
NZ, Sofia, and Delya Main and 36% in Massawa CZ. The CZ dilution and ore loss applied are 
based on a dilution study carried out by Maptek taking into account the very narrow nature of the 
CZ ore body. The 10% figure is based on experience with similar steep tabular ore bodies at 
Barrick's Loulo operation. 

Ore loss was set at 3% for NZ, Sofia, and Delya and 8% for CZ, which is also based on historical 
information from nearby operations with similar geology. 

24.2.3. Cut-Off Grade 

To enable an improved cash flow, a full grade ore classification was implemented, with 
preferential treatment for high-grade ore. Marginal ore is treated only at the end of the mine life 
after being stockpiled, when mining has stopped. 

The cut-off grade, g, is where revenue from the gold produced equals the cost of treating ore that 
includes the cost of refinery and shipping. Cut-off grades are calculated below as: 

𝒈𝒈 = 𝒄𝒄 ÷ 𝒓𝒓 × 𝒑𝒑 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 300 

Where;  g = cut-off grade 

c = total operating costs $ /t treated = mining cost + metallurgical cost + G&A costs 

r = metallurgical recovery  

p = selling price $ /g = (gold price – (gold price x royalty)) ÷ 31.10348.

24.2.6. Economic Analysis at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

An economic assessment to confirm the reserve status of the Massawa, Sofia, and Delya pits at 
a $1,200/oz gold price was carried out based on the key parameters summarised below: 

• Total ore mined from Massawa, Sofia Main, and Delya pits of 21 Mt of ore at an average 
grade of 3.92 g/t Au containing 2.6 Moz of gold. 

• Strip ratio of 6.9:1 to give total tonnes mined of 166 Mt. 

• Mining costs average of $3.55/t mined over the LOM. 

• Haulage cost average of $1.25/t of ore milled over the LOM ($0.18/t km hauled). 

• Plant cost average of $18.02/t ore but includes a range of costs dependant on ore feed 
and process route. 

• G&A costs of $8.60/t ore milled over the LOM, including outside engineering costs. 

• Capital construction cost of $413 million.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 306 

• On-going capital of $16 million over the LOM. 

• Rehabilitation cost of $23 million at the end of the LOM. 

The financial model is based on annual cash flow projections, with technical and economic 
parameters stated above using constant money terms. No escalation or de-escalation has been 
applied. In generating the financial model for the operations and project, the following principles 
were adopted:  

• Financial implication on the methods of funding was not evaluated, since it has been 
assumed the Project will be financed by Barrick. 

• Annual figures are based on financial years 1st January to 31st December. 

• Real term annual cash flows were used to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR), net 
present values (NPV), and simple and discounted payback periods in real after-tax terms. 

• Costs up to start of construction are considered as sunk costs. 

• No salvage value for plant and equipment on cessation of operations was included. 

• Calculations are based in US dollars ($). 

24.2.7. Production and Cash Flow Forecast at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

The estimated production and cash flow forecast at a $1,200/oz gold price are summarised in 
Table 24-13.

24.2.8. Financial Analysis at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

A financial model was run using a $1,200/oz gold price feeding the reserve mining schedule, 
together with a 3% royalty on revenue, seven-year tax holiday (two year construction, five years 
for operation), followed by corporate tax at a 25% rate, which produced a total net cash flow after 
tax of $696 million, and IRR of 28%. Payback is 2.5 years from start of production. A sensitivity 
table on NPV, IRR, and payback against gold price is supplied in Table 24-14.

24.2.9. Government Revenue at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

The government revenue earnings from the Project are sourced from the following assumptions 
incorporated into the financial model: 

• 3% royalty on revenue; 

• Tax rate of 25%. Payments are made throughout the year after the seven-year tax holiday 
from issuance of the mining permit. 

• Dividends from 10% free carry share of the Project, which are payable after capital has 
been redeemed. 

• Other taxes which include withholding taxes on dividends and salaries.  

Under the current Kounemba Convention, Barrick will be exempt from all taxes, levies, and duties 
for a period of seven years from issuance of the mining title.  

A sensitivity of expected government revenue based on the cash flow is detailed in Table 24-15.

24.2.10. Sensitivity Analysis at $1,200/oz Gold Price 

Discount Rate and Gold Price 

The proposed Project is profitable at current gold prices, but it is sensitive to gold price 
fluctuations and therefore becomes a marginal project at gold prices lower than $1,000/oz, but 
very attractive at current or higher gold prices (Table 24-16).

Grade and Gold Price 

The Project is fairly resilient to grade changes and at current gold prices would be able to absorb 
a 10% reduction in grade (Table 24-17). The Project is sensitive to gold price fluctuations with a 
$1,000/oz and a 20% reduction in grade making the Project very marginal. Conversely, at higher 
gold prices than current, the Project is very resilient to a grade reduction.

Operating Cost and Gold Price 

At current gold prices, the Project can absorb a 20% increase in operating costs and still remains 
largely profitable (Table 24-18). The Project will require a gold price of less than $1,000/oz and 
an increase of 20% in operating costs to become a marginal project.

Capital and Gold Price 

The Project is sensitive to increases in capital cost (Table 24-19). At a $1,200/oz gold price, an 
increase of 10% on capital reduces the NPV by $100 million, or 18% of the NPV.

25. Interpretation and Conclusions 

Barrick has documented standard procedures for the drilling, logging, and sampling processes, 
which meet industry standards. The mineralisation wireframe parameters at Massawa, Sofia, and 
Delya are based on visibly identifiable geological contacts, which ensure that a geologically 
robust interpretation can be developed. Randgold's procedures ensure a reliable database of 
exploration information, but the implementation of a digital system is an opportunity for improving 
the systems and checks in place.  

Massawa Mineral Resources are estimated using industry accepted methods. Portions of the 
Massawa mineralisation have been recognised to have significantly higher grades than the 
remainder of the mineralisation, and the top cutting, domaining, and estimation approach taken 
by Randgold to limit the effects of the high grades is considered to be appropriate. The Qualified 
Persons consider the Mineral Resource estimates at the Project to be appropriately estimated 
and classified. 

The Qualified Persons concur with the parameters used in the Mineral Resource to Ore Reserve 
conversion process. 

The strategic focus for Massawa has been to prioritise the Sofia and CZ ore over the refractory 
ores of the Massawa NZ. Consequently, increasing the reserves of non-refractory material will 
further benefit the Project and active exploration work is continually underway targeting additional 
areas on the permit.  

The open pit mining operations at Massawa, Sofia, and Delya will consist of multiple open pits, 
i.e. CZ, NZ, Sofia Main, Sofia North, and Delya. The open pits are being planned to be mined by 
a mining contractor and a down-the-hole blasting service will be provided by an appropriate 
blasting contractor. The proposed mining method of conventional 90 t truck and excavator open 
pit mining is appropriate for the ore body and suitable dilution and ore loss factors have been 
applied. Randgold has significant experience in other mining operations in the region on similar 
ore bodies to Sofia, Delya, and NZ and has compared production, modification factors, and costs 
against these operations to ensure they are suitable. The CZ ore body has execution risk in that 
the bulk of the gold is hosted within thin lodes containing a large coarse gold component. Higher 
dilution and ore loss factors have been applied to this ore body to compensate. Any misallocation 
or misinterpretation of the CZ ore body will result in a loss of value. As such, a detailed GC 
programme will be an important requirement to successfully mine the CZ ore body. 

Significant testwork has already been undertaken on the various ore types from oxide and free 
leaching ores of Sofia, to the high gravity and partially refractory ores of the CZ and the highly 
refractory ores of the Massawa NZ and Delya. Based on testwork completed, the overall 
recoveries of 78% for the Project are realistic.   

The processing feed plan extends over a nine-year period where the WOL plant has a nameplate 
capacity of 2.4 Mtpa of fresh ore which can increase to 3.0 Mtpa when treating the softer oxides. 
The plant is divided into two streams, i.e. two parallel grinding ball mills form the hub of the

processing plant. Each subsequent process route is implemented sequentially from a single 
stream. This means that the flotation circuit is erected well into the mine life in conjunction with 
the BIOX circuit, which matches the phase capital schedule. 

The completed ESIA analysis includes all required specialist studies. The Project is within the 
Niokolo-Koba headwaters and within a relatively environmentally pristine area. Significant effort 
has been made to generate an Environmental Management Plan that is practical and effective in 
minimising the impact of the Project on the environment. An inclusive transparent approach that 
utilises the concept of environmental offsets to benefit the regions biodiversity preservation will 
be implemented.

26. Recommendations 

It is recommended that additional exploration be conducted to expand the non-refractory ore to 
extend the life of mine and improve the economics and pay back of the Project. It is recommended 
that the entire Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources be drilled to an AdvGC spacing 
suitable to the variography for each of the pit's ore types prior to commencement of mining.  

Process operating costs have been estimated based on specialist studies on the variable ore 
types and it is recommended that optimisation studies be undertaken on the CZ and BIOX 
amenable ore types to further optimise the process recoveries and costs. Mining costs have been 
developed from the first round of mining tender and it is recommended that the final mine plan 
be submitted to the short list of tender contractors to obtain the most efficient cost, and a trade-
off be done against an owner mining option. 

A full updated ESIA has been completed for the Project, and Environmental and Social 
Management workshops will be required including all affected parties to find practical and 
effective management measures to leverage the benefits of the Project to the region and the 
Senegalese economy but minimise the negative impact on communities and environment. 

It is recommended that Randgold, which owns the permit, submit an application to the 
Senegalese government to convert the Kanoumba Permit into a mining licence under the 
Senegalese 2003 Mining Code.  

It is further recommended that, upon approval of the mining permit by the Senegalese 
government, a new entity company be registered in Senegal into which the mining permit will be 
transferred, and at this stage the State will receive its participation interest in that company. It is 
the intention that the newly registered company will have a new name and that ownership of the 
Kanoumba Permit will be transferred into the newly formed company.  

As previously indicated, Randgold is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick following the 
merger transaction which was completed on 1st January 2019.

30.1. Appendix 1 – JORC 2012 Edition – Table 1 – Massawa Gold Project 

The following table provides a summary of important assessment and reporting criteria used at the Massawa and Sofia deposits for the reporting of Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the Table 1 checklist in The Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves (The JORC Code, 2012 Edition). Criteria in each section apply to all preceding and succeeding sections. 

30.1.1. Section 1. Sampling Techniques and Data 

JORC 2012 Checklist of Assessment and Reporting Criteria 

Criteria Commentary 

Sampling 
techniques 

• Diamond drilling (DD) core samples are taken within geological units, and are normally between 0.8 m and 1.5 m.  The core is halved along the apex of the 
structure in the downhole direction. This is to have equal Au value for both halved core.  

o Massawa Central Zone (CZ) core is cut along the apex of the structure in the downhole direction within the two main mineralised structures, being hanging 
wall (VC, QFP, GAB) and footwall (GRW and CARSCH/CS). 

o Massawa Northern Zone (NZ) core is cut along the main ore zone (MOZ) structure host greywacke, greywacke/subordinate carbonaceous schist in the 
downhole direction. This is to have equal Au value for both halved core.  

o Sofia core is cut within the two main mineralised structures, being hanging wall (Quartz Diorite) and footwall (Gabbro). 

• Reverse circulation (RC) samples have been riffle split and composited to 1 m down hole for sampling. RC chips are stored in chip trays. 

• Grab, channel, and soil samples are used for early stage exploration only and not estimation. 

• Trenches have been cut into the oxide portion of the CZ and NZ pits of which 15 are included in the CZ resource database and eight are included in the NZ 
resource database. 

Drilling 
techniques 

• DD is utilised at Massawa for exploration and resource development. PQ rods (85.0 mm) and HQ rods (63.3 mm) are used in the weathered saprolite (oxides) 
with NQ (47.6 mm) being used in the un-weathered consolidated rock. DD core is stored in core trays that are marked up and logged before transfer to the core 
storage. 

• RC drilling is used at Massawa for grade control (GC) as well as exploration/resource development. RC chips are sieved and analysed by the geologist before 
being logged and placed in chip boxes for storage. 

• Rotary air blast (RAB) and Air Core drilling has previously been used at the Massawa Gold Project for exploration and sterilisation purposes, however, neither is 
used for resource estimation purposes. 

• Currently core orientation is measured using the 'Reflex ACT II Core Orientation Tool' (ACT).  

• All drill holes currently surveyed with Reflex EZ-GYRO multi shot system with measurements every 10 m down hole. Some historic holes measured with Reflex 
EZ-TRAC or Reflex conventional GYRO.

Drill sample 
recovery 

• Core recovery is measured in the field and during detailed logging. Core loss is marked out clearly. 

• RC sample recovery is measured by weighing the total weight of sample collected over one-metre intervals and comparing this to the theoretical expected weight 
for the lithological unit and weathering type. 

• External Gilson riffle splitters are used on site for splitting RC samples and field duplicates.  

• Bias tests between equally represented areas of DD and RC drilling in NZ and Sofia Mineral Resources indicate that there is no issue with drilling support due to 
sample volume differences. 

• Bias tests between equally represented areas of DD and RC drilling in CZ Mineral Resources have shown that smaller sample sizes such as NQ and HQ core do 
not provide a fully representative repeatable sample, due to the nuggety nature of the vein related free gold. Consequently, all CZ drilling since 2013 has been 
completed with RC or PQ diamond core – which through field duplicate analysis have shown a good level of repeatability. 

Logging • DD core is logged geologically including weathering, mineralisation, alteration, lithology, structure, and redox. Data is logged directly into paper log sheets and the 
data is transcribed into an Excel entry template. This has been replaced with direct digital entry on rugged tablets using Maxwell LogChief during Q1 2017 so that 
data will auto synchronise with the newly installed onsite Maxwell Datashed SQL database. All drill core is photographed. 

• Geotechnical logging is only performed on holes specifically drilled for geotechnical assessment, as required. 

• RC chip samples are logged on one-metre intervals due to the sampling method. RC chips are sieved and placed into chip boxes for each interval. 

Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation 

• Half core is cut for DD samples and submitted. Drill core length for each assay is determined by the geology and alteration. The core is halved along the apex of 
the structure in the downhole direction. This is to have equal Au value for both halved cores. 

• RC samples are submitted on one-metre intersections. Sub-sampling of RC intervals for GC and field duplicates is carried out at the rig using a riffle splitter. Wet 
samples are dried before manually splitting.  

• To date, field duplicates of CZ samples have shown a good correlation of results when using riffle splitters despite the nuggety nature of the free gold associated 
with the vein mineralisation.  

• To improve the splitting, all riffle splitters were replaced with Gilson splitters in Q1 2018. This is industry best practice for nuggety ore bodies. 

• Historical studies at Massawa NZ and Sofia ore bodies have confirmed there to be no significant grade bias through sample recovery rates. 

• CZ sample analysis has shown that smaller sample sizes such as half NQ and HQ core do not provide a fully representative sample that is repeatable, due to the 
high nugget factor within the high-grade (proximal) zones. Larger whole core and RC sampling methods are required to collect a sample that is representative 
enough, such that it can be split to produce a repeatable result when analysed using a bulk sample gold content analysis method. 

• Consequently, all CZ drilling since 2013 has been completed with RC or PQ diamond core, and the gold content has been analysed using bulk 1 kg LeachWELL 
(LWL69M) plus tail concentrate (FAA505T) fire gold content analysis. 

• Testwork completed to date has indicated that historic half core DD core data analysed with 50 g fire assay will underestimate the gold content relative to larger 
samples with bulk analysis methods; as such, this data is currently used as part of the estimation dataset within the Inferred portions of the CZ Mineral Resource.

Quality of 
assay data and 
laboratory 
tests 

• All 50 g fire assay samples for Massawa NZ and Sofia have been analysed at either SGS Bamako or SGS Loulo in Mali. These samples are analysed using Fire 
Assay High Level (FAA505) with results in parts per million (ppm).  

• Since 2013, all Massawa CZ samples have been analysed by 1 kg LeachWELL (LWL69M) at SGS Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  

• Blank samples are course blank material. Currently these are inserted at least 1 in 20 (5%) with the logging geologist inserting them specifically within mineralised 
zones to improve contamination testing. Blank sample results show that cross sample contamination is currently low. 

• RC field duplicates are inserted at 1 in 20 (5%). DD field duplicates procedure has been updated to include coarse reject duplicates which are submitted blind to 
the laboratory. 

• Insertion of Certified Reference Materials (CRM) is following industry standard procedures. CRMs are currently inserted at 1 in 20 or 25 (4% to 5%). A limitation 
on the Massawa quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) programme has been that no CRMs have been utilised within the 1 kg bulk sample LeachWELL 
analysis (LWL69M). However, Massawa CRMs inserted blind to the laboratory have been utilised to verify the 50 g fire assay of the remaining tail concentrate 
(FAA505T) from the 1 kg bulk sample LeachWELL analysis (LWL69M). This limitation has been addressed as part of the commencement of the 2017 feasibility 
programme where Massawa commissioned OREAS to create custom 1 kg matrix matched shear hosted orogenic gold CRMs that will be used as blind CRMs 
within the 1 kg bulk sample LeachWELL analysis (LWL69M).  

• From commencement of the feasibility programme in 2017 only pre-packaged CRMs were used, which eliminates any potential sample contamination at the 
internal prep stage. 

• A further limitation of the Massawa QA/QC programme is that umpire laboratory tests were last completed with the significant drill programme in 2010 and have 
not been routinely completed afterwards due to the non-continuous nature of the work programme.  Various campaigns of round robin testwork has been carried 
out on the Massawa deposit during the pre-feasibility and feasibility programmes. These studies largely concentrated on the CZ and tested the reproducibility and 
reliability of the LeachWELL analysis and the SGS Ouagadougou laboratory. 

• An umpire assaying programme was previously completed on a significant drill programme in 2010. This umpire analysis tested the SGS Loulo and SGS Kayes 
(Mali) laboratories against the OMAC Laboratory, Ireland. These results indicated that the OMAC umpire results returned higher grades than those of SGS Loulo 
and SGS Kayes, although they were impacted by one significant outlier. Once the outlier was removed the results were significantly closer overall. A slight negative 
bias was outlined by Randgold against the SGS Loulo and SGS Kayes laboratory, however, both were considered as being acceptable, with the SGS Loulo 
laboratory noted for its higher precision. The more recent round-robin LeachWELL analysis has provided confidence in the general SGS Ouagadougou laboratory 
procedures and analysis in light of any umpire analysis. 

Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying 

• A number of RC and DD twins have been completed at Massawa CZ and NZ. The twins in NZ showed good repeatability of assays with an acceptable level of 
variability. 

• During 2013, six RC twins were drilled in CZ to utilise sample for the evaluation of different gold content analysis methods. This tested the repeatability of 
conventional 50 g fire assay, against 300 g screen fire assay, in addition to 1 kg and 2 kg LeachWELL sample analysis. The results indicated that 50 g fire assays 
have a low level of repeatability, 300 g screen fire assays had a moderate level of repeatability, relative to the bulk 1 kg and 2 kg LeachWELL analysis which 
showed a good level of repeatability.  

• The different size LeachWELL analysis tests (2 kg and 1 kg samples) showed no significant variance in the total gold content reported from the sample. However, 
significant differences were observed in the amount of gold recovered during leaching against the gold content in the leach tails, as such, the sample size selection 
was based upon optimisation of the leach recovered gold.

• Data loggers for collection of sample data in the field are used to minimise data transcription errors. 

Location of 
data points 

• The Massawa Project uses UTM ZONE 29N datum WGS84 grid coordinates. 

• All drill hole locations are surveyed using DGPS. 

• Since 2016, all downhole surveys are performed with a multi shot Reflex EZ-GYRO. Previously Reflex EZ-TRAC and reflex conventional GYROs were used. 

• Digital terrain model surfaces are created from LIDAR surveys.  

Data spacing 
and 
distribution 

• Resource classification is clearly defined for the deposit. The Mineral Resources are classified as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred based on drilling density, 
geological continuity and confidence, the variogram range continuity and the slope of regression. Drill densities in CZ and NZ Mineral Resources have been 
optimised from specific drill spacing studies. CZ Mineral Resources also take into account the representability of the sample size and gold content analysis  

• Sample compositing is applied, after top cutting, for samples that are used in the resource estimation. A 1 m composite is currently used with a 0.5 m tolerance 
for mass. Composite samples below 0.5 m are excluded for resource estimation. 

Orientation of 
data in relation 
to geological 
structure 

• Drilling is undertaken perpendicular to the strike of the main body of mineralisation. Commonly, a 50° to 60° dip angle for the drill holes is used to cut the steeply 
dipping mineralised lenses at as high an angle as possible.  

Sample 
security 

• Samples on the rigs are bagged and tied with custom Massawa and Sofia tags as well as being weighed and documented. The samples are stored in a secure 
facility and are delivered to the laboratory by company personnel. 

Audits or 
reviews 

• No external audits have been completed on Massawa and Sofia Mineral Resources in their current form as additional drill data for both CZ and NZ has been 
completed in a number of small local orientation blocks. 

• A full external audit of the sampling methods and procedures was undertaken by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) in 2017. RPA did not identify any areas 
material issues. Two high priority issues were identified, the collection of bulk densities which did not follow Randgold Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from 
other sites, and laboratory certification and selection with regard to LeachWELL assaying. Bulk density sampling has been updated to meet the same standard as 
at other Barrick Africa and Middle East sites. LeachWELL certification does not currently exist, however, Randgold undertook a programme of laboratory round 
robin assaying using their current assaying procedures and 1 kg custom OREAS CRM standards which indicated there to be no issue with repeatability of these 
samples. All other minor 'housekeeping' issues outlined in the RPA audit have been reviewed and acted upon where required.

• No external audit has been undertaken on the Massawa Mineral Resource models, however, the general procedures used to generate the Mineral Resources are 
common across Barrick Africa and Middle East operations which are externally audited on three-year cycles. The QP for the Mineral Resource (Mr Simon Bottoms) 
is the QP for all Barrick Africa and Middle East operations and has ensured that the Massawa Mineral Resources are of the same quality as all other Barrick Africa

status 

• The Massawa gold deposit is located in Eastern Senegal and is located approximately 700 km SE of the capital city, Dakar, and 90 km due west of the Barrick 
Loulo Mine in Mali. The deposit is positioned in the centre of the Kanoumba Permit which was granted to Randgold by Presidential Decree in 2003 and renewed 
by arêtes issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines in 2010, which merged the original permit with the Kanoumering Permit, into the single Kanoumba Permit.   

• The Senegalese government maintains a 10% free carried interest in all projects. The government's interest is activated at the Exploitation Stage, and a local 
mining subsidiary must be created.  The subsidiary company is required to finance the 10% share of the State in the capital.  The State does not contribute to the 
expenses for exploration, feasibility studies, development, or mining.  In the case of an increase in the capital during the mine life, the State will receive a free 10% 
free carried interest in the new investment in order to keep its participation at 10%. 

• Conventions under the 1988 Mining Code (Law No 88-06 of 26th August 1988) covered the original Kanoumering (2002) and Kounemba Permits (2003). 
Subsequent to the 1988 Mining Code an updated mining code was passed in November 2003 (Law No 2003-36 of 24th November 2003). Randgold exercised the 
right to apply the 2003 Mining Code to the merged permit area on 14th April 2010, when two permits were combined into the single Kanoumba Permit of 621 km2.  
The arête was approved on 21st May 2010. 

Exploration 
done by other 
parties 

• The southern portion of the Massawa target had been subject to a considerable amount of exploration work by AngloGold Ashanti Limited (AngloGold Ashanti or 
AGA) between December 1996 and January 2000. During this period AngloGold Ashanti undertook regional geochemistry, mapping, and an airborne survey. In 
addition, some RAB and 21 DD holes consisting of 3,406 m were drilled at priority targets, mostly around the Tinkoto pluton, however, none of which were drilled 
within any of the currently defined Mineral Resources. 

• The Massawa and Sofia Mineral Resources were all greenfield discoveries by Randgold in 2004 after completion of the Kounemba Permit regional soil survey. 
The regional soil sampling programme at 1,000 m by 100 m spacing identified a total of 11 targets, among which seven were ranked as priority for detailed work. 
Due to the low tenor of the Massawa anomaly it was only selected as a secondary target. A detailed soil grid was completed in mid-2005 which identified a 3.5 km 
long, 100 m to 400 m wide soil anomaly at above 50 ppb gold in soil. Subsequent soil sampling in 2008 extended the anomaly to the south and north by a further 
3.4 km for a total of 6.2 km. The first trench was positioned over the anomaly in November 2006. The first trench, MWTR001 which was cited on the SW part of 
the soil anomaly returned an encouraging result and was followed up by exploratory RAB drilling. Positive results from the RAB drilling were followed up with a 
number of phases of DD between 2007 and 2010. 

Geology • The Project is located within the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier which is divided into the Mako volcanic series to the west, and an overlying Dialé–Daléma sedimentary 
basin to the east. The contact between the Mako and Dialé–Daléma series is structurally controlled and marked by the regional-scale, NE trending Main 
Transcurrent Shear Zone (MTZ)   



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 366 

Criteria Commentary 

• Massawa is located along the eastern margin of the 150 km long Mako belt, where Birimian assemblages consist of greenstones and sedimentary rocks, dated 
between 2160 Ma to 2200 Ma, which were intruded by ultramafic to felsic plutons yielding ages of 2070 Ma to 2210 Ma. All rock types, excluding post-Birimian 
dykes, were metamorphosed to a lower green schist facies during the Eburnean orogeny.  

• The Massawa stratigraphy is dominated by a western package of volcaniclastic rocks and an eastern package of greywackes, with bedding striking at between 
210° ± 10° and dipping steeply (75° to 80°) toward the west. This dominantly clastic sequence is intruded by a number of igneous rocks including sills of gabbro, 
felsic intrusions, and feldspar (and/or quartz-feldspar) porphyries. 

• The Massawa deposit occurs over a strike length of 4.5 km and is divided into two zones (CZ and NZ) that differ in terms of host rock geology, mineralogy, and 
structural controls. The CZ and NZ are separated by a 0.3 km gap zone, where less intense shearing is observed. Both Massawa CZ and NZ lie on a NE trending 
(035°) structure which is thought to be a second order splay off the neighbouring MTZ.  

• The NZ consists of one main NNE trending mineralised structure with discontinuous footwall (FW) and hanging wall (HW) lodes. Mineralisation is localised in a 
damage zone adjacent to highly strained bands of fine- to medium-grained felsic and lithic wacke, wacke with subordinate carbonaceous shales, and gabbros. 
The NZ is sub-divided into two further zones based on structure (NZ1 and NZ2).   

• The southern 1.1 km of the NZ (NZ1) hosts discontinuous, weak gold mineralisation (average grade of 1 g/t to 1.5 g/t Au). The weakly silicified, brittle-ductile, 
mineralised shear is less than 10 m in thickness and is sub-vertical to steeply dipping to the ESE.  

• NZ2 represents the northern and highest grade (>4 g/t Au) portion of the deposit. Mineralisation is confined to a single, continuous, narrow zone (10 m to 15 m 
average width), which is sub-vertical to steeply dipping (>70°) to the WNW. The mineralisation is bounded by two prominent carbonaceous shale horizons. Two 
mineralised domains are modelled in the NZ: 

• A higher-grade domain (average 5 g/t Au) consists of 7% to 10% disseminated sulphides (arsenopyrite>pyrite) associated with ductile shearing with extensional 
quartz-carbonate veins. 

• A lower-grade domain (average 1.5 g/t Au) consists of 1% to 3% disseminated sulphides (pyrite>arsenopyrite) associated with brecciation and extensional quartz-
carbonate veins.  

• Mineralisation in the CZ is hosted by an anastomosing brittle-ductile shear network localised by pre-existing gabbro and felsic porphyry intrusive contacts. The CZ 
is divided into four blocks based on metallurgy (Block 1 to Block 4) generally becoming more refractory to the north associated with higher arsenopyrite content 
and a change in host lithology from volcaniclastics to sediments (greywacke). 

• There is a deposit scale correlation in the CZ between increasing brittle-ductile strain and increasing gold grade, with the grade of mineralisation variable along 
strike and down-dip related to the variable strain associated with the structural framework. The continuity of mineralisation is localised along gabbro and felsic 
porphyry intrusive contacts with high-grade mineralisation associated with high strain and arsenopyrite.  

• The grade and continuity of mineralisation in the CZ is characterised by alteration style, deformation intensity, and intrusive contacts. 

• Low-grade (+1 g/t Au) mineralisation in the CZ is associated with weak to moderate shearing with silica-carbonate alteration and disseminated sulphides with 
weak strain. Arsenopyrite is rare. High-grade (+3 g/t Au) mineralisation is associated with high strain including brecciation, extensional and shear veins, with 
moderate to strong silica-carbonate alteration and sulphides. Arsenopyrite is the dominant sulphide associated with gold, with arsenopyrite and pyrite also observed 
as vein selvedges +/- visible gold. 

• In the CZ, veins identified by trenching and diamond drilling vary in style and include extensional, sheared, and boudinage veins. Veining associated with +1 g/t 
Au mineralisation is sub-parallel in orientation to primary strain (shearing) highlighting the genetic link between deformation and mineralisation.

Criteria Commentary 

• To the south and north of Massawa, the NE trending shears are dextrally offset by discordant N-S structures, resulting in dilation and mineralisation. Sofia is 
situated to the west of Massawa along the NE trending Sabodala Shear Zone. 

• The Sofia Mineral Resource is sub-divided into the Sofia Main Zone (MZ) consisting of brittle-ductile structures that strike 040°. The Sofia MZ consists of 
compressional structures and splays, with zones of high strain developed over at least 1.4 km of strike. Several syngeneic weakly mineralized (sub 1 g/t Au) sub-
parallel zones are hosted in the HW and FW stratigraphy.  

• At Sofia North the main mineralized structure that controls the strain and alteration is developed at the eastern contact of the western mafics that turns in strike 
from 040° to 010° and has been delineated along a strike of over 2 km. A second, high grade, narrow vein hosted mineralised zone, is present in the HW 
stratigraphy at the contact between gabbros and lavas, suggesting that the strain has transferred from the FW to the HW on this strike orientation. 

• The mineralisation at Sofia is thought to be emplaced in a compressive system (thrust model/transgression) where changes in HW geometry from sub-vertical to 
steep/moderate west dipping has a structural control on the mineralisation. The mineralisation in Sofia is defined by a strong occurrence of fine disseminated pyrite 
accompanied by strong silica, K-feldspar, and carbonate alteration.

Relationship 
between 
mineralization 
widths and 
intercept 
lengths 

• In Massawa all Mineral Resources drilling is perpendicular to the mineralised zones with holes dipping between 50° and 60°. 

• The southern 1.1 km of the NZ (NZ1) mineralised shear is below 10 m in thickness and is sub-vertical to steeply dipping to the ESE.  

• The northern portion of the NZ (NZ2) has an average mean true thickness of 13 m, which is sub-vertical to steeply dipping (>70°) to the WNW. 

• Massawa CZ consists of eight broad discontinuous Phase 1 mineralised zones modelled over 1.6 km in length striking 023° to 025° and dipping 75° to 85° towards 
the NW, with variable width from 2 m to 12 m, with an average mean true thickness of 8 m. The Phase 2 structures are situated within the broad Phase 1 mineralised 
zones and consist of six main shears striking 023° to 025° over entire length of the CZ.  

• Phase 1 and Phase 2 intercepts are reported separately in all results as the Phase 2 data is hard bounded for the purposes of resource estimation due to the 
distinctly separate grade distributions between the two phases. 

• The Sofia Mineral Resource is sub-divided into the Sofia MZ consisting of a NE-sub-vertical mineralised structure with an average mean true thickness of 8 m to 
9 m. In contrast, the NZ is hosted by an N-S-trending dextral shear with only narrow dykes of felsic intrusives.

Further work • The main exploration objective at Massawa is to increase Ore Reserves to greater than 3 Moz of gold. For this purpose, the potential exploration discovery and 
definition of an additional 600 koz of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are required. 

• For 2019, the priority exploration target areas are KB, Samina (Delya strike extensions), Tina, and Tiwana South (Bakan Corridor). Each of these target areas are 
associated with anomalous soils and litho-samples and, apart from Samina, are located on transfer and/or second-order ENE, NE, and NNW structures. RC and 
Air Core drilling in combination with trenching and additional fieldwork is planned for 2019 to further define potential at these priority target areas.

Database 
integrity 

• All project data is stored in an industry standard Maxwell Datashed SQL database for optimal validation through constraints, library tables, triggers, and stored 
procedures. All site software application databases are set up to link back to the main database for information retrieval via ODBC. A full-time database administrator 
is employed at site to manage the database and is overseen by the Loulo regional database administrator. 

• During the migration to the SQL database in 2017, all assay data was migrated from the access database – but subsequently, assay data was re-imported directly 
from assay certificates from the laboratory and ranked such that they have a higher priority than the MS Access imported data.  

• Data loggers for collection of sample data in the field are used to minimise data transcription errors. 

Site visits • Qualified persons (Simon Bottoms MGeol, FGS, CGeol and FAusIMM and Rodney Quick Pr. Sci. Nat, SACNASP, MSc) regularly visit site. During 2018, several 
visits took place to review both the on-going exploration and resource development programme. 

Geological 
Interpretation 

• Cross sections were generated for all deposits by drawing vertical sections approximately perpendicular to the mineralised zones' strike direction in Maptek Vulcan; 
Seequent Leapfrog, and Micromine. 

• The mineralisation wireframes for Sofia, Delya, and Massawa NZ were generated through drawing a string outlining the edges of mineralisation intercepts on vertical 
sections in Vulcan. The vertical sections are generally spaced 10 m apart, except in areas where the GC orientation drilling has been completed which are spaced 
at half of the drill spacing (e.g. 5 m sections for 10 m along strike drill spacing). This allows for two intermediate section strings between each line of drilling. The use 
of intermediate strings allows for the wireframes to be smoothed between sections, particularly when the mineralised body anastomoses both horizontally and 
vertically. The vertical section strings are snapped to the exact intersection within all forms of data including surface trenches, RC, and DD holes thereby ensuring 
that the points that define the wireframe intersect the drill hole or trench. Thereafter, the strings on each section are connected to form a 3D triangulated solid. Where 
a mineralised zone terminates, the wireframe is projected along strike by 50% of the drill spacing (mean distance of 25 m).

Criteria Commentary 

• The wireframes are again checked against the hardcopy hand-drawn sections, and then cut to the 5 m resolution LIDAR topographic surface, for Massawa and Sofia, 
the sections are cut to the 10 m resolution DGPS topographic surface for Delya. 

• For the CZ, cross sections were hand drawn for each drill line and flitches were then generated every 10 m vertical depth. These interpretations were then scanned 
and georeferenced into Seequent Leapfrog in order to create the 3D wireframes. The wireframes were generated in Seequent Leapfrog through selecting the 
geological intervals on vertical and horizontal sections and then using the vein-modelling tool to model these intercepts in 3D space. The Massawa deposit is 
composed of multiple sub-parallel shear zones, and the wireframe modelling attempts to model the major structures. The mineralised zones are identified by a 
combination of sulphide identification, alteration, and shearing. Full geological interpretation is completed on the sections, using the drilling, lithological, and alteration 
logging in the trench, RC, and DDH data, then from this interpretation, strings representing the outlines of the ore body are digitised. All strings are snapped to the 
exact interval on the drill or trench trace and the strings are connected to form a 3D triangulated representation of the ore body. 

• The wireframes are again checked against the hardcopy hand-drawn sections, and then cut to the LIDAR topographic surface, and further divided into weathering 
profiles namely saprolite, saprock, and fresh portions using the updated weathering surfaces. 

Dimensions • The Massawa CZ and NZ deposits occur over a strike length of 4.5 km. The NZ has a strike length of 2.5 km.  
• The southern 1.1 km of the NZ (NZ1) mineralised shear is less than 10 m in thickness and is sub-vertical to steeply dipping to the ESE. The northern portion of the 

NZ (NZ2) has average mean true thickness of 13 m, which is sub-vertical to steeply dipping (>70°) to the WNW. 

• The Sofia Mineral Resource is subdivided into the Sofia MZ consisting of a 2.1 km of NE striking sub-vertical mineralised structure with discontinuous FW lenses 
and the Sofia NZ consisting of a 2.1 km N-S trending dextral shear zone.  

Estimation 
and modelling 
techniques 

• All Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources are estimated using an Ordinary Kriging (OK) estimation methodology, and apply parent cell estimation for the 
relevant GC or exploration parent cell size, thereby ensuring that sub-cells are effectively grouped to provide sufficient sample support per estimated block. 

• Qualitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) was utilised to determine the optimal block size, minimum number of samples, search radius, and block 
discretization for each pass, by evaluating the kriging efficiency (KE) and slope of regression (SR) across multiple block centroid locations to ensure that the selected 
parameters are robust and appropriate for different areas within the relevant domain.  

• All Massawa CZ search radii, number of samples used, and QKNA estimation parameter optimisations were restricted to RC drill data with bulk sample LeachWELL 
(plus tail assay) determination in order to ensure that the respective grade distributions and continuity were not skewed by the known negative bias of sample grades 
within the smaller volume DD. Block size optimisations were performed to take into account the mining SMUs. 

• The estimation search strategies for Sofia, Massawa NZ, and Delya were tested using QKNA based on the modelled variogram ranges taking into account that in 
nugget shear hosted gold systems the full variogram range is often artificially extended for the last 3% to 5% of variability. Additionally, the estimation search strategy 
takes into consideration the data distribution for both the geological and the data spacing sub-domains. The resultant search ellipsoid orientations are verified visually 
against the domain wireframe and, where appropriate, the search ellipse and associated variogram directions are locally re-orientated to reflect bifurcation and local 
changes in the strike and dip of the mineralisation wireframes.   

• In 2018, dynamic anisotropy (DA) was introduced to the Massawa CZ deposit to better reflect the anastomosing nature of the mineralisation and local changes in 
orientation across the deposit. 

• All Mineral Resources use multi-pass estimation searches, in order to estimate all blocks, whereby each pass uses a varying degree of restrictions before any given 
block can be estimated. Accordingly, the Mineral Resource classification is adjusted per the search pass during which the blocks from an area were estimated.

• Tina and Bambaraya have been estimated using inverse distance squared using one pass of the search ellipse. All searches have been orientated into the average 
strike of each of the deposits. 

• Top cutting is determined using a multifactor analysis, whereby an appropriate top cut is assessed utilising individual methods of analysis including raw composite 
percentile disintegration, analysis of the grade distribution, and log probability plots. Generally, the chosen top cutting value is expected to occur between the 95th 
and 99.9th percentiles. Subsequently, the final top cutting value is chosen taking into consideration the results of each of the methods of analysis. 

• NZ sample grade distributions were assessed using conventional multifactor analysis methods. The grade distributions for NZ1 domains were grouped for the 
purposes of top cut optimisation. The grade distributions for NZ2 were also grouped for the purposes of top cut optimisation but split by domains with similar grade 
distributions.

•  All CZ GC samples top cutting optimisations were restricted to RC drill data with bulk sample LeachWELL plus tail assay determination. Due to the separate grade 

distributions of CZ mineralisation, the domains were grouped for top cutting based on similarities in grade distributions. 

• Grade distributions in the CZ low-grade domains (top cutting group 1) were assessed using conventional multifactor analysis methods. Grade distributions were 
assessed both independently for each of the mineralised zones and also as grouped domains to compare the results of the top cut evaluations. 

o An additional restricted search ellipse constraint has been placed on all CZ low-grade samples above 28 g/t Au within the GC domains, where the search 
ellipse is restricted to 33% of the total variogram range (21 m), which is almost equal to the range of the third structure. 

o Within the wider spaced exploration domains, the search ellipse for estimation of all samples above 11 g/t Au is restricted to 66% of the total variogram 
range (42 m), which is almost equal to the range of the second structure. The search ellipse restriction is reduced in the exploration domains relative to the 
GC domains, due to the wider spacing of the drill sample data. 

o This combination of a restricted search and extreme outlier top cutting is considered to be the most appropriate method for estimation within a nuggety gold 
system, as it retains the areas of local very high-grade material, but restricts their influence whilst also top cutting the actual outliers. The resultant impact 
on the contained metal ounces is the same as the impact from applying a straight top cut. 

• The grade distributions of the CZ high-grade domains were assessed both independently for each mineralised zone and then grouped to compare the results of the 
top cut evaluations. Due to the partial coverage of the RC data with bulk LeachWELL assay determination, some lodes were under sampled with respect to others 
and as such the grouped distribution was used to determine the relevant top cut. 

• Due to the nuggety nature of the CZ high-grade (proximal) domains, the range of potential top cuts established using conventional multifactor analysis methods 
varied significantly (by >200%). Accordingly, it was necessary to run an additional 'metal at risk' simulation which has been utilised at other nugget vein gold mine 
operations. The metal at risk simulation was run on all 15 m by 10 m AdvGC RC drilling analysed using bulk LeachWELL analysis. The simulation was restricted to 
a tight estimation data analysis envelope area that is restricted to half the drill spacing away from the last GC grid intersection. 

o The results of these simulations indicate that the top cut value was 55 g/t Au for CZ top-cutting group 1,150 g/t Au for CZ top-cutting group 2&3, and 465 
g/t Au for CZ top-cutting group 4. In addition, a high yield restriction was used to limit the metal generated by high grades in cutting group 1 and 4. For top-
cutting group 1 and top cutting 2 HW & HW Bridge this was 28 g/t Au, and for top-cutting group 4 this was 230 g/t Au.

• Massawa CZ RC samples used in the Mineral Resource estimation sample datasets were taken on one-metre intervals, therefore the samples were flagged within 
their respective estimation domain wireframes, giving one-metre composites. Massawa CZ trench and DD samples, as well as Massawa NZ, Sofia, and Delya Mineral 
Resource estimation sample datasets were composited to one-metre composites within their respective estimation domain wireframes with a tolerance of 0.5 m. This 
results in a maximum composite size of 1.5 m and a minimum composite size of 0.5 m, however, over 95% of the composites are equal to 1.0 m. Any residual 
composites with a length below 0.5 m were excluded from the final estimation dataset.

• Block models volume checks at all Massawa Mineral Resources have been validated to be within less than 1% variance from the volume of the corresponding 

wireframes. The CZ low grade domains have displayed a higher (2.5%) variance as a result of the relatively low and anastomosing nature of the block model. 

• Due to the complex thin anastomosing shape of the high-grade wireframes, the CZ block model has been built entirely based upon the GC block size to achieve a 
close volume reconciliation between the block model and wireframes. Consequently, the exploration sub-domains use a parent cell size that is exactly double that 
of the GC block size, meaning that the estimation will assign the grades into groups of eight blocks when writing estimated grades to represent parent cell estimation. 

• In the Sofia block model, the thin anastomosing wireframe shapes in Sofia Main dictate that the entire block model be built entirely based upon the GC block size to 
achieve a close volume reconciliation between the block model and wireframes. Consequently, the Sofia North sub-domains use a parent cell size that is exactly 
double that of the GC block size in strike length (Y axis) to account for the wider spacing along strike. This means that the estimation will estimate a single grade into 
the groups of two blocks when writing estimated grades, representative of the parent cell size. 

• The block model parameters are listed below.

Cut off 
Parameters 

• Massawa NZ processing costs are set materially higher than that of CZ, Sofia or Delya due to reflect the BIOX treatment costs. 

• Massawa NZ underground Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 2.5 g/t Au which reflects all costs above except the mining cost where the nearby 
Loulo UG actual costs are applied ($26.79 per tonne mined development and stoping plus $12.15 per tonne mined backfill). 

• Tina and Bambaraya Inferred open pit Mineral Resources are reported at a 0.50 g/t Au flat cut-off grade, because the modifying factors affecting the marginal gold

Mining 
Factors or 
Assumptions 

• The mining dilution was assumed to be 10% of additional waste for each tonne of ore in Massawa NZ, Sofia, and Delya Main and 36% in Massawa CZ. The CZ 
dilution and ore loss applied are based on a dilution study carried out by Maptek taking into account the very narrow nature of the CZ ore body. The 10% figure is 
based on experience with similar steep tabular ore bodies at Randgold's Loulo operation. 

• Ore loss was set at 3% for NZ, Sofia, and Delya and 8% for CZ, which is also based on historical information from nearby operations with similar geology, in the 
Randgold Group.

• The Massawa deposits consist of free-milling ore in Sofia and most of CZ, and a refractory portion in the northern part of CZ as well as NZ and Delya fresh. The 
refractory ores have been proven to be highly recoverable through BIOX as an oxidative step. 

• The Massawa process plant design utilises well-known and established carbon-in-leach (CIL) and gravity technologies to recover gold from oxide and fresh ores that 
will be processed during the first and second phases of the operation, i.e. whole ore leach (WOL). These technologies will be utilised in combination with flotation 
and BIOX leach technologies to recover gold from refractory ores that will be processed during the third phase of the operation. 

• The proposed Massawa process plant design has been compiled for the treatment of different types of ores that will be processed in three phases: 

o Phase 1 – Oxide ore will be processed through primary crushing (mineral sizer), milling, and gravity recovery, CIL, gold recovery stages (acid wash, elution, 
electrowinning, regeneration), and detoxification of tails prior to disposal. 

o Phase 2 – Fresh (sulphide) ore will be processed through primary (jaw crusher) and secondary (cone crusher) crushing, mill feed bin, milling, and gravity 
recovery, CIL, gold recovery stages from carbon, and detoxification of solids prior to disposal. 

o Phase 3 – Refractory ore will be processed through primary and secondary crushing, mill feed bin, milling, and gravity recovery, flotation, regrind mill, BIOX, 
CIL, gold recovery stages from carbon, and detoxification of tails prior to disposal.

Environmental 
Factors or 
Assumptions 

• Independent consultants Digby Wells Environmental (Jersey) Limited together with Tropica Environmental Consultants (Tropicana) were contracted to conduct the 
environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) of the Massawa project.  

• As is common with mining projects in West Africa, several potential positive and potential negative impacts have been identified. An environmental and social 
management plan (ESMP) has been completed to ensure these impacts are systematically and correctly managed. 

• The ESMP includes a number of recommended mitigation measures that, if implemented effectively, will enhance the positive impacts of the Project, and minimise 
the negative effects. 

• No impacts which could present a fatal flaw to the successful execution of the Project have been identified to date. With this effective implementation of the ESMP, 
none of the negative impacts are believed to be sufficiently significant to prevent the development of the proposed Massawa project. The potential positive impacts 
associated with the local and national Senegalese economies are expected to be significant. 

Bulk Density • Bulk density values were measured by applying the Archimedean principles (density = weight (in air) ÷ (weight (in air) – weight (in water)). All results are grouped by 
weathering profile and lithology. The density measurement procedure differed slightly for saprolite, transition, and fresh material: 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report 

23rd July 2019 Page 374 

Criteria Commentary 

o Saprolitic density measurements were primarily obtained from trenches, although some drill hole core was used. For trench samples, cubes of approximately 
25 cm by 25 cm by 25 cm were excavated and the insitu weight measured to estimate the moisture content. The sample is then dried out and wrapped in 
a waterproof membrane. 

o Fresh and transition density measurements were primarily obtained from drill core. The procedure followed involved the selection of 10 cm to 15 cm pieces 
using the water immersion method.

Audits or 
Reviews 

• No external audits have been completed on Massawa and Sofia Mineral Resources in their current form as additional drill data for both CZ and NZ has been 
completed in a number of small local orientation blocks. 

• A full external audit of the sampling methods and procedures was undertaken by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. in 2017. RPA did not identify any areas material 
issues. Two high priority issues were identified, the collection of bulk densities which did not follow Randgold SOP's from other sites, and laboratory certification and 
selection with regard to LeachWELL assaying. Bulk density sampling has been updated to meet the same standard as at other Barrick Africa and Middle East sites. 
LeachWELL certification does not currently exist, however, Randgold undertook a programme of laboratory round robin assaying using their current assaying 
procedures and 1 kg custom OREAS CRM standards which indicated that there to be no issue with repeatability of these samples. All other minor 'housekeeping' 
issues outlined in the RPA audit have been reviewed and acted upon where required. 

• No external audit has been undertaken on the Massawa Mineral Resource models, however, the general procedures used to generate the Mineral Resources are 
common across Barrick Africa and Middle East operations which are externally audited on three-year cycles. The QP for the Mineral Resource (Mr Simon Bottoms) 
is the QP for all Barrick Africa and Middle East operations and has ensured the Massawa Mineral Resources are of the same standard as all other Barrick Africa and 
Middle East operations 

Discussion of 
Relative 
Accuracy/ 
Confidence 

• The resource estimation completed at Massawa follows standard industry protocols and the estimation is a progression of previous models. The Mineral Resources 
have been generated using 

• For all block models, the following validation is carried out: 

o A volume reconciliation between the block model estimation domains and related wireframes is undertaken.  
o All models are visually checked against the composite data on both cross section and long section basis, to validate the estimation and ensure that estimated 

grades and metal show no clear bias or trends that would not be expected from the variography or estimation domaining.  
o A check of the number of the blocks estimated using the negative kriging weight is completed. Any blocks estimated using negative kriging weight have 

been reset to the anisotropic nearest block grade of the closest sample.  



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report

Criteria Commentary 

o A comparison between the data minimum, maximum, mean, and the estimated grade at 0 g/t Au cut off for each of the domains (within the open pit or 
underground reporting areas) is created. This is completed to check for possible over or under estimation. 

o Swath plots are created for each geological domain to validate the estimated grade variability compared to the composite along X, Y, and Z axes. This is to 
check that the model estimate follows the trends seen in the data and that there is no general bias with over or under estimation. Areas with less data 
support are also highlighted for further drilling and geological work. 

• The swath plots for Massawa, Sofia, and Delya Mineral Resources show that the correlation between the estimation and the source data is acceptable and that 
conditional bias is minimised. The swath plot analysis does, however, highlight a significant increase in estimation smoothing within the exploration sub-domains 
relative to the GC sub-domains. This is considered acceptable and is a function of the wider data density and the fact that the estimations in the exploration sub-
domains use samples from a much wider search area relative to the more local GC sub-domains. The application of thorough exploratory data analysis and 
quantitative neighbourhood kriging analysis gives confidence in the model. 

• A pilot plant scale test was completed on the CZ Mineral Resource, which provides a source of reconciliation data to test against the GC blocks estimated within the 
Mineral Resource.

As required by Section 4 of the 2012 JORC Code for reporting of Ore Reserves, a Table 1 is provided that contains a summary of the estimation and reporting 
criteria relevant to the Ore Reserve declared.  Below is the Table 1 covering the 2018 Open Pit Ore Reserves for Massawa and Sofia.

Estimate for 
Conversion to Ore 
Reserves 

• The Ore Reserve statement is based upon the Mineral Resource declared as at 31st December 2018 by Randgold.  Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of 
Ore Reserves.  Mineral Resources are supported by a dedicated Competent Person Report. 

Site Visits • Qualified person Rodney Quick Pr. Sci. Nat, SACNASP, MSc regularly visit site. During 2018, several visits took place to review both the on-going exploration 
and resource development programme. 

Study Status • A technical and financial study has been conducted by Randgold to support the disclosure of updated Ore Reserves. The study is based on an open pit mining 
project whereby the ore is mined and fed through an onsite metallurgical plant to produce gold in doré. 

Cut-Off Parameters Full grade cut-off grade 

• The full grade cut-off is the ore material that is profitable at $1,000/oz, considering all operating costs of mining, haulage, processing, and general and 
administrative costs, as well as the appropriate recovery, dilution, and realised gold price post Royalty at $1,000/oz spot gold price.  It is the principal material 
fed to the plant. 

 

 



Massawa Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report

Criteria Commentary 

Marginal cut-off grade 

• The marginal cut-off grade is the ore material mined within the $1,000/oz pit design that is profitable on a marginal basis (FGO OPEX less mining costs). Both 
marginal and full grade ore form the reserve since it forms part of the LOM plan feed schedule. The marginal ore is the reserve cut-off grade.  

Mining Factors or 
Assumptions 

• The mining dilution was assumed to be 10% of additional waste for each tonne of ore in Massawa NZ, Sofia, and Delya Main and 36% in Massawa CZ. The CZ 
dilution and ore loss applied are based on a dilution study carried out by Maptek taking into account the very narrow nature of the CZ ore body. The 10% figure 
is based on experience with similar steep tabular ore bodies at Randgold's Loulo operation. 

• Dilution is applied to both tonnes and grade (increases the tonnes and drops the grade) and simulates the waste rock that is included into the ore during the 
mining operation. It is not included in the resource model and is applied in the optimisation and mining schedules. 

• Ore loss was set at 3% for NZ, Sofia, and Delya and 8% for CZ, which is also based on historical information from nearby operations with similar geology, in the 
Randgold Group.

• Recoveries vary depending on the ore type and process route.  All oxide, oxidised transition, and Sofia material will go through a gravity circuit and straight CIL 
circuit. The reduced transition and fresh material from Massawa CZ will pass through gravity, flotation, UFG of concentrate and leaching of both the concentrate 
and floatation tails. Reduced transition and fresh material from the NZ, north of Block E will pass through gravity, flotation, and Bio-oxidation. Flotation tails will 
be released. The recoveries used for the study are as shown in the table below:

Environmental • Independent consultants Digby Wells together with Tropica were contracted to conduct the ESIA of the Project.  

• As is common with mining projects in West Africa, several potential positive and potential negative impacts have been identified. An ESMP has been completed 
to ensure these impacts are systematically and correctly managed. 

• The ESMP includes a number of recommended mitigation measures that, if implemented effectively, will enhance the positive impacts of the Project, and 
minimise the negative effects. 

• No impacts which could present a fatal flaw to the successful execution of the Project have been identified to date. With this effective implementation of the 
ESMP, none of the negative impacts are believed to be sufficiently significant to prevent the development of the proposed Massawa project. The potential positive 
impacts associated with the local and national Senegalese economies are expected to be significant. 

Infrastructure • No permanent infrastructure currently exists at Massawa. 

Costs • The mining costs have been based on contractor mining and include GC drilling, drill and blast, load and haul, and crusher feeding.  Updated processing costs 
have been generated based on the different process routes. G&A costs of $8.0/t per tonne processed have been allocated to the OPEX costs

Criteria Commentary 

• Customs duties, taxes, charges, and logistical costs are included in all relevant reagent costs for the Project. 

Revenue Factors • A gold price of $1,000 per troy oz was employed for the Ore Reserve process. 

Market 
Assessment 

• The gold market is highly liquid and benefits from terminal markets (London, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong) on almost a continuous basis. Gold prices were 
in a general downward trend from 1980 to 2000, when it traded down to approximately $250/oz. From 2000 the price increased annually until 2011 and 2012 
where the price peaked at just under $1,800/oz. There was a sharp correction to the gold price in 2013 with the end of Quantitative Easing monetary policy by 
the US Reserve Bank. Since then god has remained range bound between $1,350/oz and $1,050/oz. 

• Gold produced at the mine site is shipped from site, under secure conditions, to a refining company. Under pre-established contractual conditions, the refiner 
purchases the gold from the mine with the proceeds automatically credited to the mines' bank account. Gold production will be sold on the spot market, with no 
plan currently to hedge any sales. 

Economic • Gold Price: $1,000/oz flat 

• Royalty: 3% 

• Income tax: 25% After a five year tax holiday

Social • A full updated ESIA is required for the Project and Environmental and Social Management workshops will be required including all affected parties to find practical 
and effective management measures to leverage the benefits of the mine to the region and the Senegalese economy, but minimise the negative impact on 
communities and environment. 

Potential Positive Impacts 

• Employment opportunities; 

• Local procurement of goods and services; 

• Skills development and training; 

• Increase in local trade. 

• Increased contribution to the National economy through taxes and royalties; and 

• Infrastructure development and improvements for local community (such as roads and potable water). 

Potential Negative Impacts 

• Loss of predominantly pristine wetlands' 

• Loss of habitat and reduction in biodiversity; 

• Potential downstream impacts to the Niokolo-Koba National Park due to surface water reduction and reduced water quality; 

• Reductions in groundwater levels due to pit dewatering; 

• Dust and noise generation; 

• Visual impact due to the development of infrastructure and waste facilities 

• Loss of land use (including agriculture and artisanal mining); and 

• Population influx and associated pressure on natural resources and increased social ills.

Criteria Commentary 

Other • There is a requirement to complete a full feasibility showing the viability of the project to obtain the mining permit. Environmental certification is also required on 
the completion of the full ESIA.  

Classification • The Ore Reserve is classified as Probable based upon the confidence levels determined in the Mineral Resource and accurately reflects the Competent Person's 
views of the deposit. 

Audits or Reviews • No external audits or reviews have been carried out yet, but the process of converting Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves follow similar procedures to those at 
other Barrick Africa and Middle East operations which are regularly audited. 

Discussion of 
Relative Accuracy/ 
Confidence 

• The Ore Reserve estimate is rated as probable in‐line with the Mineral Resource classification.  

• Due to the complex nature of the deposit it is recognised there will be local deviations to the Ore Reserve estimate hence the level of confidence is placed as 
Probable. The highly nuggety nature of the gold mineralisation in the CZ brings complexity of sampling and assay. This has been mitigated by additional RC 
drilling to obtain a larger sample and bulk 1 kg LeachWELL plus tail fire gold content analysis to more accurately analyse the samples.   

• The modifying factors used are considered realistic for this Project based on the geotechnical environment and mining methods selected and assuming good 
practise is applied. The values applied are in‐line with published data from similar scale operations.
