SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Five Star Project consists of 14 Mining Permits (Medium Scale) and 11 Prospecting Permits 
(Medium Scale) held through option agreements between Shoreham Resources and Case 
Development Corp. (a Guyana Company) and Andrew Waaldjyk (a Guyana National).   The 
properties are further subject to an option and Joint Venture Agreement granting Mulgravian 
Ventures Ltd. (a Canadian Company) an option to earn 51% through share purchase and warrant 
exercises in Shoreham Resources Ltd. and investment of $2 million US in acquisition, land 
holding and evaluation expenditures.  This report has been prepared to provide technical support 
for the Mulgravian transaction, demonstrate the merits of the properties and present a budget and 
work plan for the orderly development of the property. 
 
At Five Star free gold occurs in veins and stockworks hosted in Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup 
sub-volcanic and metasedimentary rocks and Trans-Amazonian granitoids. Wide spread grid 
geochemical sampling has been conducted by Golden Star Resources, HB Mining, Dennison, 
Newmont, ValGold, the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission and other companies beginning 
in 1994 in and around the Five Star Permits   The reported rock sample values range from 
detection limits to a 3 foot x 3 foot panel sample in quartz veining in a trench at Green Hill which 
returned 19,800 parts per billion (Hunt Exploration 2007). The results have been consistent in 
their delineation of extensive gold geochemical targets in rolling hills surrounded by increasingly 
active artisanal alluvial mining operations. Bedrock sampling is very limited to date.  Conclusively, 
the Five Star gold occurrences offer a substantial exploration target areas and are part of a larger 
gold system warranting continued investigation 
 
Accompanied by Mr. Jhonni Leon Marquez, B.Sc. Geologist, Mr. Bolen conducted a field 
examination of the Five Star Property from April 31

st
 to May 10

th
., 2010, during which 23 rock chip 

samples were collected from two trenches in the Waaldjyk PPMS portion of the property. One 
end of Trench 2, with an average gold concentration of 1.14 grams per tonne across 13.55 
meters, tested the external margin of the gold geochemical anomaly which was the incentive for 
planning this program.  Trench #1 included 434 meters of weathered feldspar porphyry and 
volcaniclastic rocks without significant gold values.  Although the author Mr. Bolen and the 
accompanying geologist Jhonny Leon Marquez had the benefit of maps documenting a heritage 
of geochemical data it is clear that the trench locations do not correspond to the most significant 
geochemical responses on the property and Trench 1 lies external to the area mapped as 
anomalous. The trenching, therefore, has not tested the key targets within the Five Star Property 
and additional work is appropriate to advance the prospects which are defined by stronger and 
more consistent geochemical responses than these trench locations.  
 
This evaluation included an examination of the Green Hill Target Area within the Case MPMS 
property.  This series of gently rolling hills is central to an area of active alluvial mining .The 
exposures in the hills reveal widespread quartz veining and stockworks from veins several metres 
in width to cm. sized stringers.  The host is a sheared and altered intermediate to mafic volcanic 
rock.   Alteration evident in outcrop consists of oxides after pyrite, porous leaching indicating relic 
carbonate, and silicification.  The unit has been sheared and brecciated.  This is a strong 
structure with undetermined width and length  The large size and the reported success of alluvial 
mining operations, the demonstrated association with historic rock, soil and MMI geochemical 
responses and the evident scale of veining in this prospect support the systematic evaluation 
program proposed in this report. 
 
The initial work discussed within this Technical Report property has identified significant gold 
mineralization and consequently met the original objective of the study.  The sampling and 
observations represent an initial phase of work applied to developing refined geological 
parameters for continued exploration of the project by trenching, mapping, sampling, and drilling.  
The Five Star Project is a property of merit and offers a sound exploration opportunity for 
Shoreham Resources Ltd. and incoming partner Mulgravian Ventures.

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
Preparation of this Technical Report was undertaken on behalf of Shoreham Resources 
Ltd. ("Shoreham") in support of its Option and Joint Venture (the "Joint Venture") with 
Mulgravian Ventures Corporation ("Mulgravian") as part of documenting the merits of the 
Five Star Property for compliance reporting and disclosure requirements pursuant to NI 
43-101.  
 
This Technical Report is primarily a review of historic work by the co–author with 
emphasis on ranking the exploration targets of the Five Star Property.  This is based on 
a foundation of published geologic data from the Guyana Geology and Mines 
Commission ("GGMC"), Denison Exploration, HB Exploration, other publications, and 
internal memos and file data from Shoreham.  
 
Mr. Bolen (Independent Qualified Person) was responsible for the trenching and 
sampling reported herein completed in April and May, 2010 and has reviewed the other 
portions of the report during its preparation. He has confirmed and ratified the 
conclusions, recommendations and proposed work program presented in this report.  
Mr. Bolen is independent and is a Qualified Person pursuant to NI-43-101.   
 
The co-author David Bending,  President and CEO of Shoreham and a concerned party, 
is a Qualified Person pursuant to the standards of NI 43-101.  He is responsible for the 
integration and text of this report excluding those portions specific to the April and May 
2010 trenching program.  The graphics were prepared by Kalen Martens, Ph.D., with 
results from previous work and instructions from Mr. Bending. 
 
Accompanied by Mr. Jhonni Leon Marquez, B.Sc. Geologist, Mr. Bolen conducted a field 
examination of the Five Star Property from April 31

st
 to May 10

th
., 2010, during which 23 

rock chip samples were collected from two trenches in the Waaldjyk PPMS portion of the 
property.  Sampling was restricted to these two trenches. 
 
One end of Trench 2, with an average gold concentration of 1.14 grams per tonne 
across 13.55 meters, tested the external margin of the gold geochemical anomaly which 
was the incentive for planning this program.  
 
Trench #1 included 434 meters of weathered feldspar porphyry and volcaniclastic rocks 
without significant gold values.  Although the author Mr. Bolen and the accompanying 
geologist Jhonny Leon Marquez had the benefit of maps documenting a heritage of 
geochemical data it is clear that the trench locations do not correspond to the most 
significant geochemical responses on the property and Trench 1 lies out of the area 
mapped as anomalous. The trenching, therefore, has not tested the key targets   Five 
Star Property and additional work is appropriate to advance the prospects which are 
defined by stronger and more consistent geochemical responses than the trench 
locations.

RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS - DISCLAIMER 
 
This Technical Report is an accurate representation of the current status and geologic 
potential of the Five Star property based on the information available to the author and 
the field visit conducted April 31

st
 to May 10

th
, 2010.  The gold prospects in this area are 

defined by multiple stages of geochemical sampling and have an extended but 
undocumented history of artisanal mining activity which has been increasingly active 
during the last two years. 
 
A continuing program of exploration work, including but not limited to geologic mapping, 
extensive grid saprolite and rock geochemical sampling, bulldozer or excavator trench 
sampling to augment geologic modeling is planned.  On the basis of existing data and 
continuing surface work a program of systematic diamond drilling is contemplated in 
conjunction with evaluation and development of the adjoining PPMS and PL areas held 
under option from Guiana Shield Resources Inc. Further geological studies, metallurgical 
investigations, and independent engineering will be required to confirm the economic 
importance of the prospects and other gold targets and their collective value for the 
company.  In formulating recommendations herein, the author has considered the most 
appropriate means of determining the true value of the property.

MINERAL PROPERTIES IN GUYANA 

The Mining Act, 1989 allows for four scales of operation: 

1. A Small Scale Claim has dimensions of 1500 feet x 800 feet, and a river 
claim consists of one mile of a navigable river.  

2. Medium Scale Prospecting and Mining Permits. These cover between 
150 and 1200 acres each. 

3. Prospecting Licenses for areas between 500 and 12,800 acres. 

4. Permission for Geological and Geophysical Surveys for reconnaissance 
surveys over large acreages with the objective of applying for Prospecting 
Licenses over favorable ground selected on the basis of results obtained 
from the reconnaissance aerial and field surveys. 

Ownership of small and medium scale property titles (items 1 and 2 above) are restricted 
to Guyanese citizens; however, foreigners have been entering into contractual 
arrangements whereby the two parties jointly develop the property or the foreign 
company manages and develops the property with its authorities defined by irrevocable 
powers of attorney.  The Five Star Properties are all Medium Scale and are thus held 
through this mechanism. 

Foreign companies may apply for Prospecting Licenses and Permission for 
reconnaissance surveys. 

 

Application Procedure  for Prospecting License 

1. Complete prescribed 5D Form.  

2. Payment of US$l00.00 application fee.  

3. Work Program and Budget for first year activities.  

4. Submission of a map on Terra Survey 1:50,000 sheet.  

5. Cartographic description of area.  

6. Proof of Financial and Technical capability.  

 

The required documents are submitted to the GGMC for evaluation and their 
recommendation.  After satisfactory completion of this process the legal description of 
the property is sent to the official gazette for publication. If no objections are raised 
during the 60 days subsequent to gazette publication, ministerial approval is sought. 
When this is obtained the license becomes available on payment of the first year's rental 
and submission of an acceptable Performance Bond.  Rental rates are: US$0.50 acre for 
the first year; US$0.60 for the second year and US$1.00 for the third year. The 
Performance Bond is equivalent to 10% of the approved budget for each respective 
year. Since 1998 the GGMC has granted a 50% rebate on rental rates. 

The term of the Prospecting License is for three years, with two rights of renewal of one 
year each. The Mining Act 1989 stipulates that three months prior to each renewal date 
of the license, a Work Program and Budget for the following year must be presented for 
approval for the work to be undertaken during the following year. 

The Obligations of the licensee include quarterly technical reports on its activities and an 
audited financial statement to be submitted by June 30 for the previous year's 



 6 

expenditure. Licensees which opt to relinquish part or all of the Prospecting License area 
are required to submit an evaluation report on the work undertaken therein. Prospecting 
License properties are subject to ad hoc monitoring visits by technical staff of the 
GGMC.  

At any time during the life of a Prospecting License, and for any part or all of the 
Prospecting License area, the licensee may apply for a Mining License. This application 
will consist of a Feasibility Study, Mine Plan, an Environmental Impact Statement, 
documentation of support from affected communities and an Environmental 
Management Plan. Rental for a Mining License is currently fixed at US$5.00 per acre per 
year and the license is usually granted for twenty years or the life of the deposit, 
whichever is shorter; renewals are possible. 

 

APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR MINING LICENSE 

 

1. The holder of a prospecting license may, within the period of one year 
specified in section 40 (2) or within such further period as may be allowed 
by the Commission under the proviso thereto, apply under this subsection 
for the grant of a mining license in respect of any discovery parcel or 
parcels, which following appraisal, can be shown to contain any mineral 
to which the license relates. 

2. Any person or company holding a prospecting license or a person holding 
a prospecting permit or permits (Medium Scale), and on the Commission 
being satisfied on data supplied by that person or otherwise that a mineral 
is located therein, may apply under this subsection for the grant of a 
mining license in respect of that parcel or parcels. 

 

3.           An application under subsection (1) or (2):  

o shall be made to the Commission;  

o shall be accompanied by such reports, analysis and data resulting 
from the investigations and studies carried out under section 42 or 
otherwise;  

o shall be accompanied by detailed proposals by the applicant for 
the construction, establishment and operation of all facilities and 
services for and incidental to the recovery, processing, storage 
and transportation of the mineral from the proposed mining area; 
and  

o shall be accompanied by such other particulars as may be 
prescribed;  

4. Where an application is duly made under section 43(1) by the holder of a 
prospecting license, the Commission shall grant the mining license 
applied for on such conditions as are necessary to give effect to the 
application and the requirements of this Act; and  

5. Where an application is duly made under section 43(2), the Commission 
may grant on such conditions as it determines, or refuse to grant, the 
mining license applied for.  Negotiation and execution of a Mineral 



 7 

Agreement which defines the details of royalty and tax conditions for the 
Mining License is an integral component of the process. 

 

  APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY 

 

Section 97 of the Mining Act empowers the minister to grant Permission for Geophysical 
and Geological Survey. Basically application for Permission is based on some new or 
special concepts that need to be tested on a Reconnaissance level. The objectives can 
be based on geological hypotheses, the need to obtain regionalized information, and 
generally testing and application of new ideas in a protected environment. 

The GGMC does not specify a fixed format for applications for Reconnaissance 
Permissions, however, an application must contain some fundamental elements such as 
an elaboration of the geological objectives and program, the area(s) of interest, 
proposed fees and scheduling. Technical and financial capability of the applicant will 
also be considered. (http://www.ggmc.gov.gy/lm.html, 2009.   

The policy of the GGMC and the Prime Minister has changed since 2008 and no new 
Reconnaissance Permissions are being granted. 

 

 Five Star Property Agreements 
 
Shoreham has the right to acquire 100% interest in the 25 Five Star project permits 
subject to the terms of two property option agreements.  The August 20, 2009 Case 
Option Agreement defines the terms of purchase of 100% of 14 Mining Permits (Medium 
Scale) from Case Development Company Inc.(a Guyana Company wholly-owned by a 
Guyanese National).  The Waaldjyk Option Agreement was executed December 5, 2009 
with Andrew Waaldjyk (a Guyana National)  
 
Upon completion of Mulgravian's due diligence review, SHOREHAM and MULGRAVIAN 
entered into a Definitive Agreement between the parties which formally states the terms 
and conditions of this Option Agreement. October 31, 2010 Mulgravian completed a pri-
vate placement financing in SHOREHAM for C$210,000 (two hundred and ten thousand 
Canadian dollars) at C$0.30 per Unit (Canadian dollars thirty cents) for a total purchase 
of 700,000 (seven hundred thousand) shares of Shoreham Resources Ltd plus the war-
rants included in the Unit. Each Unit will consist of one common share of Shoreham Re-
sources Ltd. and 1/2 of a share purchase warrant which entitles the subscriber to ac-
quire one further common share of Shoreham Resources Ltd. per full warrant exercised 
at a price of $0.60 per share within one (1) year of the date of Exchange Approval of the 
private placement along with a 1/4 of a share purchase warrant which entitles the sub-
scriber to acquire one further common share of Shoreham Resources Ltd. per full war-
rant at a price of $1.20 per share within two (2) years of the date of Exchange Approval 
of the private placement   
 
The completion of this placement is governed by a private placement agreement be-
tween Shoreham and Mulgravian which is subject to Exchange and Board Approval and 
Exchange Approval of the Definitive Agreement between Shoreham and Mulgravian and

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
Access to the Five Star Project is via Matthew's Ridge in northwest Guyana, located 
within the Amakura Sub-Region of the Barima-Waini Administrative Region.  Scheduled 
air service is available three times per week from Georgetown to Matthew's Ridge (a one 
hour flight) and daily flights connect Georgetown and Port Kaituma.  Heavy sea-going 
barges operate bi-monthly between Georgetown and Port Kaituma requiring two days of 
travel. Shoreham uses these barges for shipping of equipment and bulk supplies to the 
project area and large shipments of samples from Kaituma to Georgetown.  Fuel and 
supplies are shipped to Kaituma from Trinidad and from Georgetown.   
 
From Matthew's Ridge a partial gravel road and unimproved track is traveled west for 40 
kms to a small village (Punto Carretera) and then 15 kms northwest over a narrow track 
(ATV 4 X 4) to the Five Star Area (Figure 3).   During and after periods of heavy rainfall, 
the track is virtually impassable, except by ATV or Bedford vehicles.  Artisanal miners 
are active within the Five Star Project area (Figure 4); permanent wooden structures 
have been constructed and up to 250 people (Case, 2010, Matkovich and Lamazon, 
2010) are documented living in and around the alluvial and eluvial mining operations. 
 
 No goods or services are available within the Five Star Property.  Electricity is provided 
by generators and water from local streams must be purified for household use.  Bottled 
water can be purchased in Matthews Ridge and Port Kaituma.  With a population of 170 
people, basic goods and services are available in Matthew's Ridge including lodging and 
restaurants. 
 



 12 

Elevations at the Five Star property are between 53 to 213 m above sea level. The 
terrain varies from relatively narrow valleys to moderately steep small hills. Natural 
vegetation consists of small to large tropical shrubs and trees.   Despite the tropical 
weathering environment, the laterite profile is truncated and relatively shallow.  Organic 
soil cover ranges up to 0.3 m in thickness and saprolite extends to depths in the range of 
about 20 to 30 meters. 

Guyana has a seasonal, tropical climate with almost uniformly high temperatures and 
humidity, and two distinct seasons of increased rainfall. Seasonal variations in 
temperature are slight, particularly along the coast.  Locations in the interior, away from 
the moderating influence of the ocean, experience slightly wider variations in daily 
temperature, and nighttime readings as low as 12°C have been recorded. Humidity in 
the interior is also slightly lower, averaging around 60 percent.  Rainfall is heaviest in the 
northwest and lightest in the southeast and interior.   Annual averages on the coast near 
the Venezuelan border are near 250 centimeters, south of Georgetown at New 
Amsterdam 200 centimeters, and 150 centimeters in southern Guyana's Rupununi 
Savannah. Areas on the northeast sides of mountains that catch the trade winds 
average as much as 350 centimeters of precipitation annually.  Although rain falls 
throughout the year, about 50 percent of the annual total arrives in the summer rainy 
season that extends from May to the end of July along the coast and from April through 
September farther inland. Coastal areas have a second rainy season from November 
through January. Rain generally falls in heavy afternoon showers or thunderstorms. 
Overcast days are rare; most days include four to eight hours of sunshine from morning 
through early afternoon. (http://countrystudies.us/guyana/21.htm, 2010) 

 

The relatively low elevation and undulating topography of the project setting are well 
suited to mining development.  Road access is inadequate for efficient development and 
significant investments will be warranted to upgrade existing roads and trails for all 
season support.  As and when the project reaches the advanced exploration stage the 
company will certainly consider construction of an airstrip.   Adequate water and timber 
are available on the project to expand exploration and sustain development.

 Local – Property Geology 

 
The geology of the FIVE STAR Project and controls to gold mineralization have been 
investigated by the GGMC, Dennison, HB, Golden Star and the Shoreham/ Mulgravian 
Joint Venture.  Much more detailed mapping include refined stratigraphic work and 
structural analysis will be required to develop reliable target models.

HISTORY 
 
Gold mining and prospecting activities have been active in Guyana since the latter part 
of the last century.   These operations have been restricted almost exclusively to 
exploitation of alluvial and eluvial deposits by gold panning and slicing.  Operations have 
eventually expanded with the introduction of dredging and hydraulic methods.  Gold 
production in Guyana has been almost exclusively small-scale and carried out by miners 
known locally as "pork-knockers" who work small and medium scale claims utilizing 
suction dredges, slicing, hand-crushing, amalgamation and panning to recover gold.   
 
Recorded gold production from 1884 through 1958 (Leroux, Zabev, 1997) is as follows: 
 
 1884 – 1906   1,936,495 ounces;  
 1907 – 1920     670,329 ounces; and 
 1920  - 1958        791,836 ounces. 
 



 20 

In 1998, Veiga reported that 400 dredges were in operation in Guyana and 10,000 
artisanal miners were believed to be active.  Gold production from artisanal miners was 
reported to be 90,000 ounces in 1994, 99,000 ounces in 1995, and 110,000 ounces in 
1996.   
 
Located 160 km south of Georgetown, the Omai mine was the largest lode gold mine in 
Guyana and one of the largest in South America.   After production of 3.7 million ounces 
gold over 13 years the mine shut down in 2005 after exhausting reserves in the Fennel 
Pit (http://www.iamgold.com/omai.php , 2009).  Remaining resources beneath the 
Fennel Pit are currently being evaluated for an underground operation (Bending, 2009). 
 
In 1994 reconnaissance  exploration in the North West Mining District was initiated by 
Golden Star Resources Ltd. at the Fish Creek prospecting license located about 5 km 
north of Matthew's Ridge.   Work included an airborne magnetometer survey and stream 
sediment geochemical survey on the Five Star block (Figure 3).   Subsequently Golden 
Star conducted stream and traverse rock sampling and grid soil sampling programs 
concurrent with geologic mapping.   A total of 293 stream sediment samples, 277 pan 
concentrate samples, 2832 soil samples and 83 rock samples were collected.    In 1996 
anomalies were evaluated by geological mapping, line cutting and grid-based soil 
sampling (200m x 50m).  Golden Star completed a program of trenching, deep auger 
sampling, ground magnetic survey, and diamond drilling in 1997.   Subsequently, 
trenching (591 m) was completed and sampled.  Twenty diamond drill holes were 
completed for a total of 2,870 metres and 1,496 core samples which were assayed for 
gold.  Drilling results mostly indicated sub 1 g gold although occasional high grade (e.g. 
2 m @ 33.98 g Au in DDH FI – 96/10) was encountered (Meixner, 2007).  On behalf 
ValGold Resources Ltd. (TSXV) Meixner in 1997 recommended a program of follow-up 
drilling to further test anomalies identified in the Golden Star program but no work was 
carried out.   
 
Located 32 kms southeast of Matthew's Ridge, the Barama Project (Figure 6) was 
formerly explored by HGB Ventures Inc. ( a private US company).  Following 
geochemical surveys  32 auger (371 m) and 23 diamond drill holes (1334 m) were 
completed in 1996 (Leroux, Zabev, 1997).  An open pit saprolite resource of 30,000 
ounces gold at grades of 0.20 to 0.299 ounces per ton was calculated by MDA 
Associates of Reno, Nevada (Phillion, G. W. 1996).   HGB Ventures also completed 
stream sediment, soil, MMI and grab sampling in 1999, in the land currently held as the 
Five Star (Case Option) property).  John Wark (personal communication 2007) reported 
that the Green Hill area of the Five Star Property was a priority exploration target.  
 
In 2006 ValGold Resources Ltd. (TSXV) and Newmont Mining Corporation entered into 
an agreement for exploration of the Five Star PGGS (Permission for Geological and 
Geophysical Survey - extended by the GGMC) totaling 1,164,610 acres north, 
northwest, and northeast of the FIVE STAR permits.  ValGold was required to expend 
US$5.0 million over four years to earn 100%, subject to Newmont's back-in to options to 
acquire 75% interest in any property.   Initial work included compilation of extensive 
airborne geophysical and geochemical data generated by previous work programs of 
Golden Star Resources beginning in 1994 (Whana grid, Figure 5).   
 
 In 2007, ValGold exploration shifted closer to the FIVE STAR project including the Reis 
and Yearwood PPMS Packages immediately south and southwest of the Five Star 
Property and part of the land currently held in the Waaldkyk Option (Figure 3, Figure 5).

Initial rock geochemical sampling (17 samples) on the Whana permit returned up to 81 
ppb Au.   Rock samples were described as foliated intrusive rocks, felsic volcanics 
(including rhyolite), and intermediate volcanics (dacite, andesite) overprinted by quartz-
sericite-pyrite alteration and cut by occasional quartz veins.  Soil (saprolite) sampling 
was completed at two targets including the Reis (1059 samples, 200 m X 50 m) and 
Yearwood grids (746 samples, 400 m X 50 m), targets which were identified in earlier 
Golden Star wide-spaced grids.   Results, summarized in Figure 6, indicated linear 
northeast trending soil anomalies with peak values of 5,980 ppb Au (Reis) and 226 ppb 
Au at the Yearwood grid.   
 
At present, the most important project in the North West Mining District is the Tassawini 
Project (Figure 9) located 62 km east of Matthew's Ridge, currently being explored by 
Takiera Exploration Ltd. (TSX).   A drill indicated resource of 10,766,000 tons grading 
1.3 g Au/t (437,000 ounces) with an additional 1,926,000 tons at 1.0 g Au/t (62,000 
ounces) is reported (Weiershauer, L, et. al., 2008).   
 
In joint venture with Newmont, StrataGold Corp. (TSX) explored the Monosse  and White 
Creek projects located respectively, 20 kms east-northeast and 50 kms northeast of 
Matthew's Ridge (Figure 3).  Gold is reported to occur in Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup 
(2200-2000 Ma) rocks within shear zones and at the deformed contacts of granitic 
intrusions.  At the Monosse Project (Figure 3) geochemical, mapping, and geophysical 
surveys identified a northwest trending shear which was tested by diamond drilling.  The 
best results, 44 m at 2.39 g/t gold were reported in drill hole MD008 (Yeomans, 2007).  
On December 12, 2008 StrataGold reported trench results of 34 m at 2.98 g/t gold 
(Trench TR-11, Zone 1) from their Arakaka target.  Follow-up drilling was reported to 
include 13.5 m at 7.37 g/t gold (DDH PHD-08-01) (StrataGold, 2008).  
      
The Five Star Project area has been subject to systematic surveys by Golden Star 
Resources, HB Ventures, Dennison Mines, and the GGMC.   
 
The Guiana Shield is regarded as being part of the West African Craton comprised of 
greenstone terrain of the Paleoproterzoic Birimian Supergroup which is referred to in 
northern Guyana as the Lower Proterzoic Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup.  The 
greenstone rocks of the Paleoprotrerozoic Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup are 
intercalated with Archaean-Proterozoic gneiss and intruded by Trans-Amazonian 
granite, mafic and ultramafic rocks (McConnell, Williams, 1970).   The Lower Proterozoic 
Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup is interpreted to have formed by successive back-arc 
closure and extensional oceanic arc systems caused by migrating spreading ridges 
(Voicu, et. al., 2001).  Continental clastic rocks, volcanic flows, and volcanic sedimentary 
units were subsequently deformed by folding and compression and were in turn intruded 
by granitoid bodies.   
  
In Guyana the Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup occurs in three sub-parallel groups with 
broadly similar lithostratigraphy.  The northern belt dated at 2,250 + 106 Ma where the 
FIVE STAR Project is located (Figure 9) trends generally east to northeast.  Syn- to late 
tectonic calc-alkaline intrusives ranging in composition from granite, to granodiorite, 
diorite, tonalite, and adamellite have been dated at 2,250 to 1,960 Ma, (Gibbs, Barron, 
1993).  The tectono-thermal Trans-Amazonian Orogenic Cycle (2,000 Ma) resulted in 
block faulting, crustal shortening, folding, metamorphism, and anatexi (Hurley, et. al. 
1967).     
 



 22 

The Barama Group is comprised of pelitic metasediments with metamorphosed lavas 
and pyroclastic rocks characterized by gondites and manganiferous phyllite, conformably 
overlain by the Mazaruni Group.  Manganiferous phyllite in the upper Barama Group, 
part of the Matthew's Ridge Formation have been investigated in detail since at least the 
1960s (Holtrop, 1965) when the African Manganese Mining Company was commercially 
exploiting manganese at Matthew's Ridge.  The Mazaruni Group includes the Cuyuni 
Formation and conformably overlying Haimaraka Formation.  Cuyuni Formation units 
consist of pebbly sandstone, interbedded conglomerate, greywacke, and felsic to mafic 
volcanic units while the Haimaraka Formation contains mudstone, pelite and greywacke. 
 
Most of the gold deposits and occurrences in the Guiana Shield are hosted in 
Supracrustal terranes which have been metamorphosed to upper greenschist facies 
metamorphism.  Some of the deposits are associated with deformed and undeformed 
calc-alkaline felsic to intermediate intrusives (e.g. Omai) while others are associated with 
shearing and tectonic activity ( e. g. Gros Rosebel) and are synchoronous with- or post-
date deformation (e.g. Kilometer 88, Venezuela).  Gold deposits within the northern 
Guiana Shield are characterized by strong structural control and proximity to intrusions is 
common but not essential to all deposits.   Gold mineralization of most deposits occurs 
within quartz veins or associated stockwork, lenses and breccias within brittle rocks.  
Due to contrasting pressure gradients epigenetic mineralizing fluids emanated along 
structural conduits which developed at brittle ductile boundaries (Voicu, et. al., 2001).   
 
 
MINERALIZATION 
 
Voicu, et. al., (2001) concluded that most gold deposits of the Guiana Shield shows 
overlapping ages with the high-grade metamorphic terranes and late-emplacement time 
compared to the host low-grade metamorphic rocks.  They speculated that the gold 
deposits of the Guiana Shield formed during a period of time that is bracketed between 
peak metamorphism at shallow levels (~ 2100 Ma) and a protracted peak metamorphism 
during the Trans-Amazonian orogeny at deeper crustal levels reflected by the high-grade 
metamorphic gneiss and granulite terranes (~ 2000 Ma). 
 
Within deposits of the northern Guiana Shield, free gold occurs as microscopic and 
macroscopic irregularly shaped grains or as dendritic fillings within quartz or as 
inclusions in pyrite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite and as intimate intergrowths with sulfide 
and tellurides.  Pyrite is the most common sulfide associated with gold which typically 
has very high fineness.  Scheelite, molydenite, tellurides, and bismuth minerals are 
commonly associated with gold hosted in felsic rocks. Although the nugget effect is 
significant, most deposits throughout the Guiana Shield have a constant gold grade 
which ranges from 1.3 to 2.3 g/tonne in bulk (Voicu, et. al., 2001).   
 
Gangue constituents include occasional tourmaline (e.g. strong tourmalinization of wall 
rocks at Las Cristinas) quartz, carbonate (siderite, ankerite, calcite) chlorite, epidote, 
albite, muscovite, and fuschite.  Typical hydrothermal alteration includes silicification, 
carbonatization, and propylitization.  Other deposits are associated with sericitic 
(potassic) and argillic alteration (Voicu, et. al., 2001).  It is probable that the reported 
argillic alteration is related to tropical weathering of sulphide bearing mineralized rocks 
and not part of the original hypogene assemblage.  
 



 23 

The extension of the northern belt of the Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup (see Regional 
Geology, above) and it's stratigraphic equivalent into southern Venezuela, the Pastora 
Supergroup hosts several important gold deposits including El Callao, and the Kilometer 
88 deposits including Lo Incre ble.   The El Callao mine was the most productive gold 
mine in the world in the latter part of the 19

th
 century and reached peak production in 

1885 producing 262,192 ounces gold (Locher,1972).  The mines of the El Callao region, 
with significant production from the Columbia Mine, Tomi and Choco 10 have been 
progressively more productive during the last 15 years.  El Callao veins, ranging from 2 
cm to greater than 10 m are localized by faults and shear zones within the El Callao 
Formation of the Pastora Supergroup.  Native gold occurs with minor to trace amounts of 
pyrite, tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, scheelite, moblydenite, galena, pyrrhotite, and 
sphalerite are present in quartz veins.  Carbonitization, propylitization, sercitization, and 
silicification have overprinted wall rocks several tens of meters away from quartz veins 
(Sidder, 1995).  The superficial geochemical expression in the El Callao district has been 
studied in detail.  The most useful pathfinder elements include gold, lead, mercury, 
manganese, and vanadium.  Each element has a characteristic halo surrounding gold 
bearing quartz veins including Mn and V (great lateral dispersion), Hg (large vertical 
dispersion and moderate lateral dispersion), and Pb and Au (small vertical and lateral 
dispersion) (Pasquali 1972).  At Lo Incre ble similar wall rock alteration and gangue 
constituents are present but fault- and shear zone- controlled veins are gold-quartz-
tourmaline assemblages. 
 
Within the Five Star property area gold geochemical responses and well established 
alluvial production are closed associated with shear zones and silica – carbonate 
alteration with quartz veins and stockworks in carbonate and sericite altered supracrustal 
rocks.  The magnetic data suggest a close relationship to second order shear zones, fold 
closures and crosscutting structures in mafic to intermediate volcanic (flows and tuffs) 
and epiclastic sedimentary rocks..

EXPLORATION 
 
Exploration to date at FIVE STAR has consisted of rock and grid geochemical sampling and 
geologic mapping.  Alluvial mining and exploration coupled with the systematic geochemical work 
have confirmed the presence of gold in the soils and gravels.   Rock sampling by BHV during the 
period 1995 to 1997 showed a range of gold values from detection limits of 1 part per billion to a 
significant 3 foot by 3 foot panel sample with reported gold concentration of 19,800 parts per 
billion.  No drilling or systematic trenching have been documented in the Property area. 
 
Recent Exploration. 
 
The senior author (Bolen) spent 17 days in Guyana in May of 2010, primarily dedicated to a small 
trenching program in the Waaldjyk option area of the Five Star Property.  Two trenches were 
excavated to a depth of approximately 2 metres to expose the saprolite.  A total of 24 rock 
samples were collected to represent the materials encountered in the trenches. 
 
Trench 1 was approximately 400 metres in length, along a strike of 348 degrees. The rocks had a 
strike of approximately 240 degrees.  The trench exposed a mixed package of intermediate 
volcanic rocks which included andesite flows and lapilli tuffs.  Nine samples (9) were taken over 
the most altered interval of 24 metres.  Results were negative. Trench 1 was centered on GPS 
Coordinate's 781903 East, 833270 North.      
 
Trench #2 was approximately 220 metres long excavated  at a strike of 324 degrees. The trench 
was centered on GPS Coordinates 781837 East, 833749 North.  Intermediate volcanics of 
andesitic composition was encountered.  A zone of alteration with a prominent 2.5  metre wide 
quartz vein intersected the trench at 90 degrees to the trench strike.   
 
Wide zones of weathered quartz in saprolite were poorly structured except except for one the 
quartz vein with true width of 1.0 meters which was resistant with relief of 1.5 metres below the 
trench floor.   Residual and mottled zone material with high proportions of white sericite formed 
the bulk of the trench.  Sampling gave two (2) intervals of interest; 2.5 metre of 1.23 g/t Au and 
10.65 metres of 1.12 g/t Au in the saprolite (or, an average of 1.14 g/t across 13.55 meters).   
 
The laterite usually contained roots, variable amounts of iron- manganese pisolites and mottled 
textures.  The saprolite was well preserved, dark red and often strikes and dips with remnant 
structures visible. 
 
This quartz vein has since been uncovered 300 metres to the south west in an artisanal mining 
operation.   
 
Trench 1 was excavated south or any documented geochemical responses and Trench 2 was 
started along the SE margin of a well defined trend of anomalous gold values. More trenching is 
justified on this zone, with special emphasis on the geochemical targets.

OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE GREEN HILL TARGET 
 
Green Hill is a wide exposure of quartz veining in a highly altered intermediate volcanic which is exposed on the road 
leading to the Brazilian mining operation at Trench # 2.  Located at 786339 East and 837962 North the structure is 
represented as a prominent ridge.  The unit strikes at 69 degrees and dips at 54 degrees to the North West. This 
exposure is a high ridge with a surface exposure of a minimum of 50 metres and an undetermined strike length.  
Limited surface exposures have traced the quartz veining intermittently for a minimum of 3 kilometers. Contacts were 
not seen on width or strike, due to overburden. Alluvial mining operations have pitted both sides of the ridge.   
 
Quartz varies from massive quartz veining, several metres in width to cm. sized stringers.  The host is an intermediate 
sheared and highly altered intermediate to mafic volcanic rocks.   Alteration evident in outcrop consists of oxides after 
pyrite, porous leaching indicating relic carbonate, and silicification.  The unit has been highly sheared and brecciated.  
This is a very strong structure with undetermined width and length.  The exposure is red in colour, caused by weathered 
and oxidized sulphides.  Abundant manganese often cements the brecciated portions of the unit as shown in Figures 17 
and 18.    
 
 The large size and the reported success of alluvial mining operations, the demonstrated association with historic rock, 
soil and MMI geochemical responses and the evident scale of veining in this prospect support the systematic evaluation 
program proposed in this report. This target is amenable to rapid advancement to systematic diamond drilling.

DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The author has visited the prospect area and observed artisanal mining activity, collected audit samples from 
outcrops within the Five Star permits, reviewed internal reports and data provided by Shoreham which 
documented ongoing work, reviewed technical reports prepared by junior exploration companies east of the 
project, and reviewed pertinent publications including Economic Geology and other journals.     
 

All samples collected by the author were submitted to the Guyana preparation facility of Loring Laboratories in 
Georgetown, Guyana. Loring Laboratories Ltd. a ISO 9001:2000 certified analytical laboratory based in 
Calgary, Canada.  Rock samples were submitted for gold assays with 50 gram subsamples, fire assay 
preconcentration and AA Finish.  Samples with values exceeding 1000 parts per billion were re-assayed using 
fire assay preconcentration and a gravimetric finish.  Loring Laboratories  ensures industry standard QA/QC 
protocols by utilization of internal blanks and standards.          
 

MINERAL PROCESSING AND PROCESS TESTING 
 
No metallurgical studies have been undertaken by Shoreham in the subject property.  While small-scale 
milling operations have been and are underway, no details on the performance of these programs are 
available to author at this time.  The area is known for the presence of coarse free gold amenable to low cost 
recovery with primitive gravity methods.   
 

MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
The information available for the Five Star Project is insufficient to undertake estimation of NI 43-101 
compliant resources or reserves.  

 
ADJOINING PROPERTIES AND PROSPECTS 
 
Several exploration projects and companies near the Five Star Project extending to Matthew's Ridge are or 
have recently been active including those Newmont, IAMGOLD Corp., Argus Exploration Ltd., Reunion Mining 
Corporation, and Guiana Shield Resources Inc. (Figure 3).  Six Prospecting Licenses, held in the name of 
Guiana Shield Resources Inc. and held via an option agreement with Shoreham Resources.  (Figure 3, Figure 
5).  Results of exploration programs on these permits conducted between 1994 and 2007 are summarized in 
the History section in this report.  In April 2009, these six licenses were acquired by Shoreham (Shoreham, 
2009) and subsequently included in an Option and Joint Venture Agreement with Mulgravian Ventures 
(Shoreham, 2009).  The ten Black Banana Prospecting Permits (Medium Scale) immediately south of the 
Whana PL areas is also held under option by Shoreham and has subsequently been part of an option and 
joint venture agreement with Mulgravian Ventures Ltd. 
 

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
The author found no evidence for environmental problems, social, or security concerns during the course of 
this technical review.  The Five Star project area is famous within Guyana for a sustained history of producing 
large gold nuggets and represents a high priority exploration arena for surficial and bedcock gold deposits. 
 
The Case Mining Permits (Medium Scale) are each subject to Environmental Impact Permissions and 
Environmental Bonds which are renewed annually. 
 
The Five Star area is subject to active alluvial mining activity which is subcontracted by the underlying vendor 
Case Development Ltd.  The GGMC allows for such activity as part of the terms of the medium scale permits.  
The Company has the right, on completion of the option payments (cash and shares) to assume full 
responsibility for surface work and the right to notify any and all miners to cease activity and remove all 
equipment within ninety (90) days.  The Company is expected by the GGMC to occupy and utilize the lands to 
maintain control of the area after assuming this responsibility.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Between April 31st. and May 10th, 2010, Author went to the field for preliminary evaluation of the FIVE STAR 
Project.  Work included field observations and sampling of two backhoe trenches.  The trenches were located 
based on convenient access and the availability of a backhoe rented from an artisanal mining operation within 
the Waaldjyk Prospecting Permits (Medium Scale). 
 
The initial work discussed within this Technical Report property has identified significant gold mineralization 
and consequently met the original objective of the study.  The sampling and mapping documented however, 
represents an initial phase of work applied to developing refined geological parameters for continued 
exploration of the project by trenching, mapping, sampling, and drilling.  The Five Star Project is a property of 
merit and offers a sound exploration opportunity for Shoreham Resources Ltd. and incoming partner 
Mulgravian Ventures.   
       
At Five Star free gold occurs in veins and stockworks hosted in Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup sub-volcanic 
and metasedimentary rocks and Trans-Amazonian  granitoids. Rock/ saprolite chip sampling has been 
completed in two trenches in the Waaldjyk Permits and extensive soil, MMI and rock geochemical sampling 
has been completed by previous workers 
 
Wide spread grid geochemical sampling and limited drilling has been conducted by Golden Star Resources, 
HB Mining, Dennison, Newmont, ValGold, the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission and other companies 
beginning in 1994 in and around the Five Star Permits   The results have been consistent in their delineation 
of extensive gold geochemical targets in rolling hills surrounded by increasingly active artisanal alluvial mining 
operations.  Conclusively, the Five Star gold occurrences offer a substantial exploration target areas and are 
part of a larger gold system warranting continued investigation.  
 
Recommendations 
 
The heritage of soil, rock, and MMI data and active alluvial gold production clearly support recommendations 
for further work.  The field work completed by the Author was limited to two trenches, only one of which tests 
part of a previously defined gold geochemical target but the results confirmed the presence of significant gold 
values across significant widths. 
 
Exploration should proceed as part of a systematic program including geological mapping of rock types and 
regolith from surficial materials, updated survey and grid control, systematic deep mechanized auger (Trado) 
sampling and mechanical trenching in preparation for systematic sections of diamond drillholes and (as 
warranted by the values and continuity of mineralized material encountered) progressively more definitive 
resource estimates. 
 
It is recommended that the next exploration budget be conducted in two phases, the justification and detailed 
planning of which are dependent on the preceding stage.  The total budget for the Phase I and Phase II 
programs is US$314,750 (Table 5).   
 
A comprehensive and systematic QA/QC program of data collection and monitoring is included for each 
budget phase. 
 
The recommended Exploration Budget includes a large component for all support costs, US$160,750.  All 
itemized costs for road rehabilitation and the construction and logistical and operational support of the field 
camps are adjusted allocations to the Five Star Project exclusively, recognizing that concurrent work is 
planned within other lands held in the Shoreham – Mulgravian Joint Ventures. 
 
The relatively remote location of the Property requires careful logistical support and efficient operation of the 
field camp. Expenditures during the Phase I program include road and trail improvements, camp construction 
and fly camps for efficient advancement of the well defined geochemical targets.

field camp. Expenditures during the Phase I program include road and trail improvements, camp construction 
and fly camps for efficient advancement of the well defined geochemical targets.  
 
 
 
Budget Summary – Phase I 
 
The Phase I budget US$122,820 direct plus $159,000 logistics and support) includes expansion and in-fill of 
the existing geochemical grids.   A 2500 meter (500 hole) Trado (deep mechanized auger) drilling program is 
planned to better evaluate existing gold anomalies and provide technical support for planning of subsequent 
diamond drilling campaigns. 
 
Trado drilling provides systematic sampling to depths of about 8 meters and the geological data provided by 
logging of the cuttings supplements surface geologic mapping including documentation of rock type, alteration 
and structural features.  The resulting work will allow coherent interpretation of developing drill targets and 
evaluation of mineralized areas. 
 
Budget Summary – Phase II 
 
The recommended Phase II budget (US$154,000 direct plus $170,400) logistics and support) is focused on 
trenching to better evaluate gold anomalies in anticipation of future drilling programs.  Trench walls will be 
carefully mapped concurrent with sampling.   Expenditures are included for detailed rock geochemical 
sampling to provide further clarification of controls to mineralization.  This budget would reasonably evolve into 
a drilling program in concert with corresponding work on adjoining properties.  The selection of diamond 
drilling, aircore and reverse circulation drilling will be based on target style, logistics and performance 
decisions.
