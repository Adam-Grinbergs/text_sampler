1 Summary 

This Report (the "Report") is written as a Technical Report (the "Report") for the 
Chu Chua Property (the "Property"), which is held 100 percent (%) by Kenneth 
Ellerbeck and Gerald Locke of Kamloops, British Columbia (the "Optionors"). This 
report has been prepared for Strachan Resources Ltd. ("Strachan" or the "Company") 
for the purposes of completing a "Qualifying Transaction" as a Capital Pool Company, 
under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange.  The Chu Chua property consists of 
53 contiguous claims totalling 11,431 hectares (ha).  The Property is located within the 
Kamloops Mining Division approximately 24 kilometres (km) northeast of Barriere, B.C. 
within NTS map sheet 92P/8.  On June 29, 2012, Strachan entered into an agreement 
with the Optionors, subject to regulatory approval, whereby Strachan can acquire a 
100% interest in the 53 contiguous mineral claims that comprise the Chu Chua 
Property (the "Qualifying Transaction").  This report is written to comply with standards 
set out in National Instrument 43-101 for the Canadian Securities Administration.   

 
APEX Geoscience Ltd. ("APEX") was retained by Strachan during June, 2012 as 

consultants to complete an independent technical report on behalf of Strachan specific 
to the Chu Chua Property. Mr. Kristopher J. Raffle, P.Geo., Senior Geologist of APEX, 
and a Qualified Person, conducted a property visit on June 26

th
, 2012. 

 
During 2010 and 2011, Shenul, on behalf of the Optionors, completed 

exploration within the Chu Chua Property that included ground magnetic and VLF-EM 
geophysical surveys, soil and rock grab geochemical surveys, and diamond drilling of 
three (3) holes totalling 521.5 m.  The total expenditures for the 2010 and 2011 Chu 
Chua Property exploration exceed $200,000.   

 
The Property is host to a number of magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies 

along with sporadic rock and soil geochemical anomalies that bear similarities to the 
nearby Chu Chua deposit, a Cyprus-type volcanogenic massive sulphide body first 
discovered in 1978 and currently owned by Reva Resources Corp (Reva). The current 
Strachan claim package completely surrounds the two claims that contain the Chu 
Chua deposit. The Chu Chua deposit occurs within 50 m of the Strachan claims and 
could extend onto them at both the north and south ends of the deposit.  Drill hole CC-
32, drilled during 1979 by Craigmont Mines Ltd. (Craigmont), yield 8.62% copper (Cu), 
0.36% zinc (Zn), 62 grams-per-tonne silver (g/t Ag) and 0.69 g/t gold (Au) over 1.6 m 
core length. This  hole  lies  approximately  50  m  south  of  mineral  claim  523837  
held  by Kenneth C. Ellerbeck (under option to Strachan). The Chu Chua property is 
largely underlain by the Mississippian to Permian aged Fennell Formation which 
comprises basaltic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks, clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks  
and  diabase  sills.  This  volcanic  stratigraphy  is  prospective  for  other Cyprus-type 
and Kuroko-type massive sulphide deposits and also has potential to host precious- 
and/or base-metal-bearing epithermal deposits. 

 
The main Chu Chua deposit, owned by Reva, and currently under option to 

Newport Exploration Ltd. (Newport), consists of two vertical to steeply west-dipping 
lenses of semi-massive to massive pyrite-chalcopyrite and magnetite up to 40 m thick. 
The lenses strike for about 400 metres and have a maximum depth extent of 20 m.  
However, at least one deep hole has intersected massive sulphide at a depth of 630 m

below surface. The deposit is hosted within a 70 m thick chert sequence within a 
package of pillow basalts. Regionally, stratigraphy strikes north–south and dips 
moderately to steeply east. Locally, however, Chu Chua is steep to west dipping with 
stratigraphic top toward the west. Footwall rock units display marked sodium depletion 
and the massive sulphide horizon and immediate hanging-wall are strongly enriched in 
barium.  

 
Drilling to date has confirmed the presence of two major sulphide lenses in the 

main deposit and a separate lens of massive sulphide immediately to the north named 
the North Lens. The main deposit is composed of two parallel massive sulphide lenses 
termed the Footwall and Hanging-wall Zones, respectively. Deep drilling during 1989 
to 1991 by Minnova, Inc. (Minnova) seems to indicate that the main deposit may 
plunge to the south onto claim 523835 held by Kenneth C. Ellerbeck (and under 
option to Strachan) as suggested by the recently acquired airborne magnetic data. The 
North Lens exists northeast and along strike from the main deposit and appears to 
be a separate body. For the most part little in the way of massive sulphide has been 
intersected below about 200 m below surface. However, other than a series of about 10 
deep drill holes with targeted depths of about 500 to 600 m below surface, there 
is little drilling that has targeted the area between the deep drilling and the known 
bottom of the sulphide zones.  Previous drilling by Craigmont within Strachan's claims 
at the north end of the Chu Chua deposit intersected shallow pyrite-chalcopyrite-
pyrrhotite mineralization within drill hole CC-34 that returned 0.17% Cu, 0.06% Zn, 0.25 
g/t Au and 4 g/t Ag over 1.3 m core length.  Minnova drill hole CCF-60 intersected the 
same mineralized zone down dip at a depth of 83 m, that returned assays of 0.18% Cu, 
0.03% Zn and 4.4 g/t Ag over 4.3 m.  Within Reva's claims at the south end  of  the Chu  
Chua  deposit  deep  drilling  by Craigmont and by Minnova encountered narrow 
intersections of massive sulphide and/or wider stockwork breccia zones with 
disseminated sulphide in deep drill holes CC-54, CC-57 and CCF-62. Drill hole CC-
57 yielded 3.82% Cu, 7.47 g/t Ag and 1.17 g/t Au over 2.5 m core length. An initial 
review of the historic drilling indicates there is potential to expand the known extent of 
sulphide mineralization to the north and south of the main deposit with some pointed 
drilling between the existing drill holes and the known extent of mineralization. 

 
On June 26, 2012, Newport announced a NI 43-101 compliant resource 

estimate for the Chu Chua deposit comprising an inferred mineral resource of 
2,500,000 tonnes averaging 2.0% copper, 0.3% zinc, 9.4 g/t silver and 0.5 g/t gold at 
a copper block cut-off grade of 1.0%. The deposit as currently modelled is relatively 
shallow with approximately 75% of the inferred resource occurring within a 100 metre 
depth from surface (Dufresne et al., 2012). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves 
and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or 
any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. The author 
has personally verified the resource estimate for the Chu Chua deposit; however the 
resource estimate is not necessarily indicative of mineralization within Strachan's Chu 
Chua Property. 

Further exploration in the area of the Chu Chua Deposit should be 
staged.  Expansion of helicopter-borne EM and magnetic geophysical survey 
coverage is warranted within the southern and eastern claims.  The estimated cost to 
complete 500 line-km of airborne EM and magnetic surveys at 100 m line spacing is

approximately $80,000 not including GST.  In addition, an exploration database 
comprising 2,408 soil geochemical samples and 161 diamond drill holes exists for the 
Chu Chu Property and adjacent Chu Chua deposit.  This report summarizes all 
significant exploration that has occurred within and adjacent to the Chu Chua Property 
however, a large amount of additional soil and rock geophysical and HLEM ground 
geophysical survey data exists that has not been digitally captured.  Digitization of 
these data will facilitate prioritization of historic base-precious metal soil, rock and 
diamond drill anomalies, EM conductors and mineral occurrences,   The estimated 
cost to complete additional compilation of historic exploration data is $10,000 not 
including GST (Phase 1a).  

 
Based on the results of 2010 and 2011 exploration by Shenul, and as a follow-

up to the proposed airborne EM and magnetic geophysical survey and compilation, 
additional ground geophysical surveys, geologic mapping, soil and rock geochemical 
surveys are warranted to test priority magnetic-EM and magnetic-only anomalies and 
historic Cu-Zn and Au anomalies within the Chu Chua Property (Phase 1b).  The 
total estimated cost to complete Phase 1b evaluation of priority anomalies is $110,000 
not including GST.  The total cost of the Stage 1 program is estimated at $200,000 not 
including GST. 

 
Contingent on the results of Phase 1 exploration, Phase 2 drilling of priority 

targets throughout the Property, and to test the lateral extent of the Chu Chua deposit 
within Strachan's claims is warranted. Any new drilling should include downhole 
electromagnetic surveys measuring conductivity, which can assist in resolving the 
extent of the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses and in targeting new separate zones. 
Additionally, systematic downhole multi trace element and whole rock geochemical 
work should be conducted on any new core in order to identify and better map the 
volcanic stratigraphy associated with the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses.  The 
actual details and associated budget for the Phase 2 drilling program will depend 
upon the results of the Phase 1 program.  At present, it is anticipated that at least 
2,000 m in a minimum of 10 drillholes will be required to test the extent of the Chu 
Chua deposit and follow-up of the geophysical anomalies at the south end of the 
Property. The estimated cost to complete Phase 2 drilling is $600,000 not including 
GST.

3 Reliance on Other Experts 

As of January 20, 2013, the effective date of this Report, the fifty-three (53) 
mineral claims that comprise the Chu Chua Property are shown on the British Columbia 
Mineral Titles Online (MTO) website (https://www.mtonline.gov.bc.ca), are listed as 
being in good standing, and as owned 100% by Gerald T. Locke and Kenneth C. 
Ellerbeck.  The author has used this source of information to verify the ownership and 
good standing of the claims which comprise the Chu Chua Property. 

4 Property Description and Location 

The Chu Chua property consists of 53 contiguous claims totalling 11,431 
hectares (ha) held by the Optionors (Table 1).  The mineral claims were staked by the 
Optionors through online staking between 2005 and 2012.  

 
On June 29, 2012, Strachan entered into an agreement with the Optionors, 

subject to regulatory approval, whereby Strachan can acquire a 100% interest in the

Zone 10) within NTS map sheet 92P/8 (Figures 1 & 2).   

 
Under the terms of the option agreement the Company shall pay to the Optionors 

the sum of $1,300,000; consisting of $10,000 upon signing the agreement; a further 
$15,000 on regulatory approval of the Qualifying Transaction; a further $25,000 12 
months after the Closing; a further $50,000 24 months after the Closing; a further 
$50,000 36 months after the Closing; a further $50,000 48 months after the Closing; 
and a further $1,100,000 60 months after the Closing. 

 
In addition, to exercise the option the Company shall issue and deliver 275,000 

common shares upon Closing; and a further 275,000 common shares 12 months after 
the Closing. 

 
In addition, to exercise the option the Company shall incur a minimum of 

$200,000 in expenditures on the Property by 12 months after the Closing; and a 
minimum of $100,000 of Expenditures on the Property for each of the following four 
years while the Option is outstanding. 

 
The author is unaware of any royalties, back in rights, payments, or other 

agreements and encumbrances to which the Property is subject. 
 
The Optionors entered into a prior option agreement, dated March 10, 2010, 

with Shenul Capital Inc. (Shenul).  The exploration and drilling described in this report 
was completed by Shenul, on behalf of the Optionors.  Having failed to complete the 
terms of the agreement, and as part of a corporate reorganization, Shenul 
relinquished their option of the Property on September 30, 2011.  The Chu Chua 
claims remained in the name of the Optionors for the entire duration of the agreement.

In British Columbia, the owner of a mineral claim acquires the right to the 
minerals which were available at the time of claim location and as defined in the Mineral 
Tenure Act of British Columbia.  Surface rights are not included.  Claims are valid for 
one year and the anniversary date is the annual occurrence of the date of record (the 
staking completion date of the claim).  To maintain a claim in good standing the claim 
holder must, on or before the anniversary date of the claim, either: (a) record the 
exploration and development work carried out on that claim during the current 
anniversary year; or (b) pay cash in lieu of work.  Payment of cash in lieu of work 
requirements are assessed at double the corresponding assessment work value; and a 
minimum of 6 months and a maximum. The amount of work required in the first 2 years 
is $5 per hectare per year; and $10 per hectare per year in years 3 and 4; $15 per 
hectare per year in years 5 and 6; and $20 per hectare per year in subsequent years.  
Only work and associated costs for the current anniversary year of the mineral claim 
may be applied toward that claim unit.  If the value of work performed in a year exceeds 
the required minimum, the value of the excess work, can be applied to cover work 
requirements for that claim for additional years (subject to the regulations).  A report 
detailing work done and expenditures must be filed with, and approved by, the B.C. 
Ministry of Energy and Mines MTO website. 

Changes to the Mineral Tenure Act effective July 1, 2012 will affect the Chu 
Chua Property claims.  Because of changes to the yearly assessment work 
requirements, as of July 1, 2012, all mineral claims within B.C. will be treated as if they 
are in their first anniversary year, regardless of the issue date of the claim.  This has the 
effect of reducing the overall yearly assessment work requirements for the Property for 
the next two anniversary years.

All work carried out on a claim that disturbs the surface by mechanical means 
(including drilling, trenching, excavating, blasting, construction or demolishment of a 
camp or access, induced polarization surveys using exposed electrodes, and site 
reclamation) requires a Notice of Work permit under the Mines Act and the owner must 
receive written approval from the District Inspector of Mines prior to undertaking the 
work.  The Notice of Work must include: the pertinent information as outlined in the 
Mines Act; additional information as required by the Inspector; maps and schedules for 
the proposed work; applicable land use designation; up to date tenure information; and, 
details of actions that will minimize any adverse impacts of the proposed activity.  The 
claim owner must outline the scope and type of work to be conducted, and approval 
generally takes one month. 

 
Exploration activities that do not require a Notice of Work permit include: 

prospecting with hand tools, geological/geochemical surveys, airborne geophysical 
surveys, ground geophysics without exposed electrodes, hand trenching (no explosives) 
and the establishment of grids (no tree cutting).  These activities and those that require 
Permits are outlined and governed by the Mines Act of British Columbia. 

 
The Chief Inspector of Mines makes the decision whether or not land access will 

be permitted.  Other agencies, principally the Ministry of Forests, determine where and 
how the access may be constructed and used.  With the Chief Inspector's authorization, 
a mineral tenure holder must be issued the appropriate "Special Use Permit" by the 
Ministry of Forests, subject to specified terms and conditions.  The Ministry of Energy 
and Mines makes the decision whether land access is appropriate and the Ministry of 
Forests must issue a Special Use Permit. However, three ministries, namely the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines; Forests; and Environment, Lands and Parks, jointly 
determine the location, design and maintenance provisions of the approved road. 

 
Notification must be provided before entering private land for any mining activity, 

including non-intrusive forms of mineral exploration such as mapping surface features 
and collecting rock, water or soil samples.  Notification may be hand delivered to the 
owner shown on the British Columbia Assessment Authority records or the Land Title 
Office records.  Alternatively, notice may be mailed to the address shown on these 
records or sent by email or facsimile to an address provided by the owner.  Mining 
activities cannot start sooner than eight days after notice has been served.  Notice must 
include a description or map of where the work will be conducted and a description of 
what type of work will be done, when it will take place and approximately how many 
people will be on the site.  It must include the name and address of the person serving 
the notice and the name and address of the onsite person responsible for operations. 

 
Strachan does not currently hold a Notice of Work permit for the Property.  

Approval of a completed Notice of Work permit application takes approximately 1 to 2 
months from the date of submission.  At present, the author does not know of any 
environmental liabilities to which the property may be subject.  The author is unaware of 
any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability 
to perform work on the Property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

Barriere, inhabited by about 3,450 persons, is the closest community to the 
Property with accommodations, RCMP and a health center. Kamloops, the nearest 
major center with drilling, mining and airport services, is located 64 km south of Barriere 
along the Yellowhead Highway 5.  

From Barriere, access is along the paved Barriere Lakes Road to North Barriere 
Lake and Birk Creek forest service road (BCFSR). The BCFSR heads westerly at 8 km 
from the North Barriere Lake road and at 17.5 km, the Newhykulston Creek FSR 
(NCFSR) which is sign posted FSR RD 3300 (10.5 km ) provides access to the EM1 
grid area. The Leone Lake FSR provided access to the southern claims and should 
improve once planned logging is completed. Access to the Bar Grid area is via a 
network of new or renewed logging roads that extend approximately 19 km to the 
headwater area of Sprague Creek. The Bar Grid is at approximately 17.5 km on the 
extension of the Leonie Lake Forest Service Road.  

The Chu Chua property extends across steep hills with elevations that vary from 
600 to over 2000 m with snow remaining at higher elevation and northern slopes in July. 
The climate varies from -30 degrees Celsius (°C) in winter to +30°C in summers. The 
work season generally extends from mid-June to mid-October. Vegetation varies from 
clear cuts with thick second growth with dense spruce, pine and cedar stands at lower 
elevations and sub-alpine and alpine vegetation above 1800m. Logging operations are 
presently active along Birk, Leonie, Delta and Sprague creeks.  

The Chu Chua property is underlain by Crown Land.  Under the provisions of the 
Mines Act of British Columbia, tenure holders have the right to access mineral lands for 
the purpose of exploration.  All work carried out on a claim that disturbs the surface by 
mechanical means requires a Notice of Work permit issued under the Mines Act.  These 
surface access rights are sufficient for the current stage of exploration.  The nearest 
source of power occurs within the North Thompson River valley 3 km west and along 
North Barriere Lakes Road 3 km to the east of the property.  Water for exploration 
activities such as diamond drilling is available from numerous creeks and small lakes 
within the claims.  

6 History 

Much of the flowing history deals with the discovery of the Chu Chua deposit.  
The Chu Chua deposit is currently not part of the claim package that is being optioned 
by Strachan however, the History of the Chu Chua deposit exploration is considered 
relevant and is provided below.  In addition, considerable exploration was conducted on 
the current Strachan claims as part of the Chu Chua historic exploration programs.  

In 1977, Vestor Explorations Ltd. (Vestor) conducted a stream sediment survey 
and located a 10 square-metre (m

2
) limonite gossan on the south slope of Chu Chua 

Mountain near a northerly striking massive magnetite body (Vollo, 1979a). The property 
was optioned by Craigmont Mines Ltd. and subsequently drilled with a total of 2,843 m 
in 23 holes in 1978 (Figure 3). Twenty-two of these holes are located within the Reva 
Resources Corp (Reva) claims.  One hole (CC-8) was drilled within the Property 
(southern edge of 523837 claim). This initial drilling outlined the Chu Chua massive 
sulphide body with thicknesses up to 15 m, a strike length of 300 m and a vertical depth

of 200 m. Highlights from this early drilling include sample 2436 from drill hole 
CC-6 which assayed 4.41% copper (Cu), 0.69% zinc (Zn), 1.23 grams-per-tonne (g/t) 
gold (Au) and 15.09 g/t silver (Ag) over 5 m, sample 2305 from drill hole CC-16 which 
assayed 7.47% Cu, 0.75% Zn, 0.69 g/t Au and 22.6 g/t Ag over 5 m, and sample 2313 
from drill hole CC-17 which assayed 14.54% Cu, 0.93% Zn, 1.03 g/t Au and 9.3 g/t Ag 
over 4.2 m (Vollo, 1979a). 

Between April 5 and May 20, 1979, a Digital Helicopter Electro-Magnetic 
(DIGEM) survey of 2,274 line-km was flown in the North Thompson River Area, 
including within it the Chu Chua deposit, by DIGHEM Ltd. for Craigmont (Fraser and 
Dvorak, 1979). This survey covered the current Reva claims and more than half of the 
current Strachan claims. Following the survey 21 holes totalling 3,329.8 m were drilled 
(all with BQ core; Figure 3). A total of 15 holes (2,655 m) targeted the main area of 
interest identified by the 1978 drilling, these holes fall on Reva's claim. Eleven of these 
holes intersected massive sulfides. An additional 4 holes (CC-34, CC-35, CC-37, and 
CC-39) were drilled to test the extent of the deposit along strike to the north and are 
located within Strachan's current 523837 claim.  At a depth of 15.0 m, drill hole CC-34 
intersected chert matrix agglomerate containing up to 5% pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite 
mineralization at a depth of 15.0 m that returned assays of 0.17% Cu, 0.06% Zn, 0.25 
g/t Au and 4 g/t Ag over 1.3 m.  Drill holes CC-35 and CC-37, collared at distances of 
200 and 400 m to the north of CC-34, respectively, did not intersect significant 
mineralisation.  At a depth of 85.0 m drill hole, CC-39 collared 600 m to the north of CC-
34, intersected rhyolite containing 5-10% pyrite mineralization that returned assays of 
0.3 g/t Au and 0.6 g/t Ag over 5 m (Cu, Pb and Zn were not analyzed).  Two holes (CC-
43, and CC-44) were drilled approximately 1.3 km east of the deposit to test nearby 
conductors that proved to be graphitic cherts (Vollo, 1979b, c). Drill hole CC-43 lies 
within Strachan's claims. 

By the early 1980's it was evident that the Chu Chua deposit consisted of at least 
two sulfide lenses within the Fennell Formation (Vollo, 1981b, 1982a). In October 1980, 
Craigmont conducted a Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) survey on the Chu 
Chua claim group, which did not reveal prospects of similar size and conductivity to the 
Chu Chua deposit (Hallof et al., 1981). In 1981, 3 additional holes were drilled to test 
the extent of the known ore zone (Figure 3). Two holes (CC-45, and CC-46) fall on 
Reva's claims and one hole (CC-47) was drilling within Strachan's 528835 claim. Hole 
CC-45 (319 m total depth) was drilled to test the down-dip extension of Chu Chua 
sulphide zone and encountered tuff with minor chalcopyrite (Vollo, 1981). Hole CC-46 
(420 m total depth) intersected beds of massive, cupriferous pyrite, magnetite and talc 
in a siliceous tuff unit. Hole CC-47 (110.5 m total depth) was drilled on a parallel 
conductor but intersected only basalt (Vollo, 1982a). 

In 1981, Craigmont completed soil geochemical sampling and 20 line-km of very-
low-frequency electro-magnetic (VLF-EM) and magnetic surveys and one diamond drill 
hole within the east-central part of the Property, south of Birk Creek. The VLF-EM 
survey defined a number of north trending conductive anomalies.  A total of 452 soil 
samples were collected along the geophysical grid lines.  A single copper in soil 
anomaly was defined at the head of Sprague Creek where three consecutive samples 
spaced at 25 m intervals returned values of 364, 660 and 1530 ppm Cu.  A single 114.5 
m diamond drill hole (CH-4) tested soil and coincident VELF-EM conductive anomaly.

The hole intersected graphitic tuff and basalt but did not encounter significant 
minerlaization (Vollo, 1981a). 

In June 1981, Kam Creed Mines Ltd. (Kam Creed) conducted soil geochemical 
sampling and vertical loop EM surveys at Birk Creek, immediately east of Strachan's 
claims.  The EM survey defined a northeast trending conductive anomaly and broadly 
coincident lead-silver geochemical anomaly crossing Birk Creek (Pasieka, 1981). 

In 1982, Craigmont drilled eight holes totalling 3,992 m targeting the Chu Chua 
mineralized zone (all within Reva's claims). Hole CC-48 intersected massive to weakly 
banded chalcopyrite, magnetite and talc in a siliceous tuff unit that assayed 2.4% Cu, 
0.34% Zn, 2.61 g/t Au and 13.8 g/t Ag over 6.7 m (Vollo, 1982a). Three additional holes 
(CC-49, CC-54 CC-55) tested the depth extent of the Chu Chua sulphide lens and 
intersected narrow zones of massive sulphides, tuff and altered basalt at downhole 
depths up to 600 m (Vollo, 1982b).  Additionally in 1982, Craigmont conducted VLF-EM 
and magnetic surveys over a 35 km grid, 516 soil samples were collected and four 
holes (CC-50 to CC-53) totalling 229.5 m were drilled, 3 km to the northeast of the Chu 
Chua deposit, within Strachan's claims (Figure 3).  The drilling intersected graphitic 
argillite and tuff containing disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite; no samples were 
submitted for analysis (Vollo, 1982c). 

The Craigmont exploration program at Chu Chua was cancelled in 1983 due to 
the closure of the Craigmont Mine near Merritt, B.C. and difficult deep-hole drilling 
conditions (Morganti, 1983). The property was returned to Vestor. 

Exploration after 1983 has largely focused on the area surrounding the deposit. 
During October of 1984, Vestor conducted a program of vector pulse EM surveying. 
Ninteen line-km was completed at Cowell Creek within the northern Strachan claims. 
This survey detected four north trending conductors of considerable strike length that 
correlated with magnetic highs and the target tuffite horizon (Candy and White, 1984). 

During May 1984, Kam Creed tested their coincident conductive and lead-silver 
soil geochemical anomaly at Birk Creek (east of Strachan's claims) with two holes 
totalling 205 m (Figure 3).  Drilling intersected pyrite mineralized graphitic shale hosting 
quartz vein stringers that returned  assays of 7.5 g/t Au over 0.98 m. Kam Creed drilled 
three additional holes in September 1984 totalling 176 m. One drill hole (84-3) tested 
the EM anomaly and the remaining two (84-4 and 84-5) tested a pyritic shear zone and 
quartz veins exposed on surface and within a short adit located 2 km east of the 
Energite Showing.  Drill hole 84-3 intersected near surface pyrite mineralized graphitic 
argillite containing quartz stringers that returned assays of 1.99 g/t Au over 0.91 m 
(Cardinal, 1984). 

In 1984 Zone Petroleum Corp. and Tylox Resources Corp. completed geologic 
mapping, soil geochemical, VLF-EM and ground magnetic geophysical surveys within 
the southern portion of the Property at Chip Creek (Chip-Dixie Showing).  A total of 677 
soil samples were collected at 25 or 50 m intervals along 100 and 200 m spaced north-
south oriented gridlines.  Geologic mapping defined a 900 x 400 m east-west oriented 
rusty weathering gossan zone hosted within quartz-eye tuff rocks extending east from 
Chip Creek.  A single rock grab sample from this zone returned 655 ppm Zn (DC-9); 
and the soil geochemical survey identified an in part coincident lead-zinc anomaly 
(Kermeen, 1985).

In July 1984, Corporation Falconbridge Copper (Falconbridge) completed an 
exploration program on the their SC/CH and Anna claims (within Strachan's southern 
claims at the head of Sprague Creek) that included geological mapping, and the 
collection of 166 rock and 14 soil samples, none of which returned significant assays 
(Pirie, 1985a). In August 1985, Falconbridge acquired the Chu Chua deposit. 
Subsequently, 82.5 line-km of horizontal-loop EM (HLEM) surveys were carried out on 3 
grids. The Chu Chua grid covers the Chu Chua deposit and Strachan's claims to the 
east. The other two grids (SC/CH and Anna grids) are located south of the Chu Chua 
deposit (Pirie, 1985b). Three drill holes located east of the Chu Chua deposit, totalling 
617.5 m were drilled to test HLEM anomalies and adjacent stratigraphy but no 
significant sulfides were intersected (Pirie, 1985c). 

During the 1986 and 1987 field seasons, Larry Ovington completed prospecting 
at the head of Slate Creek on the Joe claim.  The work resulted in the discovery of a 
shale-hosted sulphide showing containing massive galena and quartz veins.  Four rock 
samples were submitted for assay.  Sample J-1 returned 2.1 g/t Au and 92.75 g/t Ag; 
and sample Q-1 returned 1.44 g/t Au and 43.7 g/t Ag (Moraal, 1986). In 1987, a soil 
sampling program tested the immediate area of the showing and returned anomalous 
lead (Pb), Zn, Cu and Ag values (Ovington & Elliott, 1987). 

In 1986, Falconbridge extended the Chu Chua grid 1.5 km south, and collected 
30 line-km of HLEM data and 1,074 soil geochemical samples to test for strike parallel 
mineralization to the east of the Chu Chua deposit (within Strachan's 523835 claim).  
The geophysical survey defined an approximately 100 x 1400 m, north-south trending 
conductive anomaly crossing the entire survey grid.  An approximately 25 x 300 m, Pb, 
Zn, Cu, Ag soil geochemical anomaly is broadly coincident with the northern third of the 
conductive anomaly.  To the south, diamond drilling of eight holes totalling 937 m 
targeted coincident soil geochemical and HLEM conductive anomalies within the CH 
grid at the head of Slate and Sprague creeks.  The drill holes intersected a sequence of 
diorite, chert and locally pyritic argillite, with locally anomalous zinc values (Pirie, 1986). 

In 1986, Falconbridge carried out diamond drilling of four holes totalling 519 m on 
the SC claim group at the head of Sprague Creek (Figure 3). The drill holes targeted 
HLEM conductive anomalies and a sequence of rhyolite flows and tuff rocks. The 
conductive anomalies were explained by intercepts of graphitic argillite, while rhyolite 
intercepts returned a number of anomalous gold values.  Drill hole BAR-1 intersected a 
10 m wide zone of sericite altered rhyolite tuff that returned assays of 590 ppb Au over 1 
m.  Drill hole BAR-3 tested the SC dome and collared into a 59 m interval of quartz 
veined, silica-sericite altered rhyolite containing an average of 4-7% pyrite.  The interval 
returned assays of 4.45 g/t Au over 2.52 m, including a 30 cm section of massive pyrite 
assaying 17.6 g/t Au and 134 g/t Ag; above a broader mineralized zone averaging 242 
ppb Au over 13.98 m (Evans, 1987).  

In 1987, Falconbridge changed its name to Minnova Inc. (Minnova) and 
completed diamond drilling of 6 holes totalling 852 m (Figure 3). Minnova's drilling 
continued to test the HLEM conductive anomaly east of the Chu Chua deposit; and a 
quartz-feldspar porphyry rhyolite dome within the SC/CH grid at head of Slate Creek.  
Four holes (CCF-12 to CCF-15) drilled within the Chu Chua grid did not intersect 
massive sulphides.  Drill holes CCF-16 and CCF-17 targeted the flanks of a rhyolite 
dome.  Silica-sericite altered rhyolite and tuffaceous argillite intersected within drill hole

CCF-16 returned assays of 1.1 g/t Au over 3 m between 94.5 and 97.5 m depth.  CCF-
17 did not return significant assays (Gray, 1987). Additionally, in 1987 a field program 
was conducted on claim SC1 which included a 1:2,500 scale geological mapping 
program, the collection of 26 rock and 273 soil samples, and approximately 6.5 line-km 
of HLEM surveys. Several weakly anomalous areas and interesting conductors were 
identified but no high priority targets were identified (Pirie, 1988). 

In 1987, Minnova continued diamond drilling of the SC dome; and completed 
HLEM surveys and diamond drilling south of Sprague Creek within their Anna claims. 
Eight holes (BAR-8 through BAR-15) totalling 705 m were drilled within Strachan's 
current claims (Figure 3).  Drilling of the SC dome encountered a number of anomalous 
gold intersections: hole BAR-8 returned two separate near surface intersections 
assaying 1.23 and 1.39 g/t Au over 1.5 m; BAR-9 returned 0.78 g/t Au over 15 m, 
including 2.04 g/t Au over 4 m;  BAR-10 returned 7.51 g/t Au over 0.4 m and, 1.79 g/t 
Au over 1.5 m; BAR-11 returned 0.6% Cu, 3.8% Pb, 4.8% Zn and 110 g/t Ag over 0.45 
m; and BAR-12 returned 0.59 g/t Au over 9 m.  Drill hole BAR-14 intersected pyrite-
sphalerite mineralized tuffaceous chert, south of Sprague Creek, that returned assays of 
0.18% Zn over 10 m; hole BAR-15 did not intersect significant mineralization (Gray & 
Pirie, 1988). 

The 1988 Minnova included a focused drilling program on the Chu Chua deposit 
and extension of the Chu Chua Main HLEM Grid to the north (Blackadar, 1989a and 
Lear, 1989). As noted above, drilling by Craigmont in the late 1970's and early 1980's 
had defined two zones of relatively thick, high grade mineralization  occurring  within  
100  m  of  the  surface  which became known as the Main and North Lenses 
(Blackadar,  1989a). Minnova's  1988  drilling  was  designed  to  test  the  continuity  of  
grade  and thickness of both lenses of the Chu Chua sulfide deposit by establishing drill 
intercepts at 25 m spacing. The program consisted of 13 holes totalling 1,152 m (all 
holes were within Reva's claims). As a result of this drilling significant tonnage was 
added to the deposit and the western margin of the Main sulphide lens was defined. 
The Main Lens was determined to be a funnel shaped body with two zones of 
mineralization termed the Footwall and Hanging Wall Zones. The Footwall Zone was 
found to be a well-developed, continuous zone of highly variable thickness located 
along the footwall contact of the lens. It had an average thickness of about 7.2 m and 
contained the highest grade mineralization in the deposit. The Hanging Wall Zone was 
found to be thinner, less continuous and of lower grade, with an average thickness of 
about 4.5 m. The North Lens was found to be thinner than the upper part of the Main 
Lens, contained uniform mineralization but with lower grades than the Footwall Zone 
(Blackadar, 1989a). 

During the 1989 field season, 21 holes totalling 1,663 m were drilled in the 
deposit area (all holes were within Reva's claims, Figure 3).  The drilling further 
delineated of the near surface mineralization and showed that the highest copper 
grades occurred in the Footwall and Hangingwall massive sulphide zones. Grades 
within the massive sulphide zones tended to be highly variable; though increased 
copper grades correlated positively with zinc, silver, and gold values (Wild, 1989). 
Additionally, Quantech Consulting Inc. completed a 24.3 line-km of transient 
electromagnetic (TEM) survey over the deposit and area to the north and south.  The 
survey defined a subtle conductive anomaly (within Strachan's claims) extending north 
from the Chu Chua deposit a distance of 200 m.  Beyond this, the anomaly is more

evident and extends a further 650 m to the northwest, suggesting the potential for the 
discovery of additional deep massive sulphide mineralization (Wild, 1989). 

During October 1988, Minnova completed diamond drilling of 4 holes (BAR-20 
through BAR-23), totalling 601 m within their FY claim to the east of Chip Creek (Figure 
3).  Drilling targeted rock and soil geochemical, and HLEM conductive anomalies within 
a northwest trending rhyolite, dacite and andesite tuff and quartz-feldspar-porphyry 
rocks of the Eagle Bay assemblage.  Andesite tuff, intersected within drill hole BAR-23, 
returned assays of 0.13% Cu, 5.46% Pb, 13.2% Zn, 203 g/t Ag and 0.91 g/t Au over 
0.40 m in association with a narrow quartz veins.  The remaining holes did not intersect 
significant mineralization (Blackadar, 1989b).  Based on the results of the initial drilling, 
Minnova extended FY grid soil geochemical and HLEM survey coverage to the north; 
and drilled an additional five holes totalling 535 m (BAR-26 through BAR-30).  A total of 
581 soil samples were collected at 25 m intervals along 100 m spaced, north-south 
oriented survey lines.  The soil survey defined three Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag anomalies within the 
Chip Creek drainage interpreted to be the result of secondary hydromorphic processes.  
The HLEM survey identified conductive anomalies paralleling the northwest trend of the 
geologic units.  The diamond drilling did not intersect significant mineralization 
(Heberlein, 1990a).  

In 1989, Placer Dome Inc. optioned Larry Ovington's Joe claim at Slate Creek 
and completed a small soil and rock geochemical sampling program.  A total of 178 soil 
samples were collected at 20 m intervals along 50 m spaced, east-west oriented lines; 
in addition the collection of 14 rock samples.  Soil sampling defined an approximately 
200 x 200 m Au-Ag-Pb-Zn soil anomaly centred on previously discovered massive 
sulphide outcrop and float within Slate Creek.  A sample of quartz breccia float (sample 
42760) collected south of Slate Creek returned assays of 3.2 g/t Au, 164 g/t Ag and 
6.3% Pb (Ovington, 1989).  

During 1990, Minnova drilled eleven holes, totaling 1,731 m. Three holes were 
drilled into the Chu Chua deposit to test specific targets in the footwall and on the plane 
of mineralization (Figure 3). Two holes (CCF-61 and CCF62), totalling 1,014.1 m, are on 
Reva's claim and one hole (CCF-60) totalling 100.9 m lies within Strachan's current 
523837 claim. At a depth of 83 m, drill hole CCF-60 intersected s sequence of fine 
grained siliceous sediments containing 2-10% pyrite bands and stringers and trace 
chalcopyrite that returned assays of 0.18% Cu, 0.03% Zn and 4.4 g/t Ag over 4.3 m.  
Hole CCF-61 did not identify any new mineralization, but did provide an additional, 
shallow intersection of the North Lens. Hole CCF-62 demonstrated that the massive 
sulfide extends to 550 m depth and identified a zone of zinc rich massive sulphide; 
something that had not been previously observed at Chu Chua (Heberlein, 1990b). In 
addition, eight diamond drill holes (MCC-52 through MCC-59) were completed to test 
coincident EM and magnetic anomalies at pass separating the headwaters of Birk and 
Chu Chua creeks (3 km south of the Chu Chua deposit within Strachan's claims). The 
drill holes intersected a sequence of sericite altered sediments, argillite and magnetic 
diorite sills that explained the geophysical anomalies.  Drill hole MCC-56 intersected a 
3.7 m cherty interval containing 1-3% bedded pyrite, trace chalcopyrite, and a 15 cm 
interval of massive sulphide with approximately 3% chalcopyrite.  The massive sulphide 
interval returned assays of 1% Cu and 9 g/t Ag.  Drill hole MCC-37 through MCC-39 
tested the potential for additional mineralization to the north and south but did not 
intersect massive sulphides (Heberlein, 1990b).

Minnova completed their last work in the Chu Chua area in the fall of 1991. Nine 
deep drill holes totalling 4,957 m tested the Chu Chua sulphide horizon along strike and 
down-dip (Figure 3).  Four of the drill holes (CCF-63, 64, 67 and 69) were surveyed with 
downhole pulse EM.  Six holes, totalling 3,793 m, are located within Reva's claims. Two 
holes (CCF-64 and CCF-65) to the north of Chu Chua deposit and one hole (CCF-68) to 
the south occur within Strachan's claims.  Holes CCF-63 to CCF-66 tested the Chu 
Chua horizon at depth to the north of the Main Lens.  Drill hole CCF-63 intersected 
silicified basalt and sulphide stringers interpreted as a footwall alteration zone that 
returned assays of 0.12% Cu over 11.7 m; and drill hole CCF-66 intersected two 
separate intervals of pyrite exhalite that returned assays of 0.21% Cu, 360 ppm Zn over 
4.3 m, and 0.33% Cu, 330 ppm Zn over 1.5 m.  Holes CCF-67 and CCF-68 tested the 
Chu Chua horizon to the south of the Main Lens and did not intersect significant 
mineralization or alteration.  Hole CCF-69 was drilled to test the down-dip extent of the 
Main Lens.  The hole intersected a new hanging wall massive sulphide zone at a depth 
of 381 m that returned assays of 0.97% Cu, 0.84 g/t Au over 14.85 m occurring 1.9 m 
above a second zone assaying 0.75% Cu, 1.37 g/t Au over 4.65 m.  Drill hole CCF-70 
was collared 150 m southwest of CCF-69 and intersected an 11.5 m zone of chert and 
magnetite-hematite-pyrite exhalite; a distance of 230 m further down dip than the 
massive sulphide intersected in CCF-69 (Wells, 1991).  Hole CCF-71 tested the down-
dip and northern strike extent of mineralization within CCF-69, and intersected massive 
sulfide zone at a depth of 658 m that returned assays of 0.69% Cu, 0.13% Zn, 0.14 g/t 
Au and 5.69 g/t Ag over 9.95 m. 

 
In 1995, Eighty Eight Resources conducted a soil and rock geochemical survey 

on their KB group of claims.  The KB claims overlie the area previously explored and 
drilled by Falconbridge in 1986; including the SC dome and zone tested by the BAR 1 
and BAR-2 drill holes 2 km to the north (Evans, 1987).   A total of 168 soil and 48 rock 
samples were collected.  Soil samples were spaced a 20 m intervals over select areas 
of Falconbridge's previously established SC grid.  Twenty-two of the 168 soil samples 
returned assays of greater than 20 ppb (sample L98N 1022+25E collected from the SC 
dome returned 330 ppb Au).  Anomalous gold values were limited to a line crossing the 
SC dome and a number of isolated single sample highs; in addition, lead, zinc and silver 
multi-element anomalies were present along some lines.  A number of rock samples 
returned weakly anomalous lead, zinc and silver values; and a single rock grab sample 
(94KB-33), collected from the SC dome, returned assays of 710 ppb Au (Belik, 1995).   

In 2002, Navasota Resources Ltd. (Navasota) completed soil and rock 
geochemical sampling and a ground magnetic survey within their Gold Creek Property.  
The Gold Creek Property claims covered the area from the Energite Showing south to 
Slate Creek.  Navasota's work during 2002 was centred over Larry Ovington's historic 
Joe claim massive sulphide showing (Ovington & Elliott, 1987; and Ovington, 1989).  A 
total of 283 soil samples were collected at 25 m intervals along 100 m spaced north-
south oriented gridlines; in addition to 18 rock samples.  Soil sampling defined a gold 
anomaly coincident with, and extending downslope from, the previously discovered 
showing in Slate Creek.  Of the 18 rock grab samples, three samples returned assays of 
greater than 1 g/t Au (3666, 3669 and 3670;).  Samples 3669 and 3670 also returned 15 
g/t Ag; and 17 g/t Ag and 0.87% Zn, respectively (Warner, 2003).  Ground magnetic 
survey data was not diurnally corrected therefore, it is not considered reliable.

Navasota followed up their 2002 exploration with the collection of an additional 
25 soil samples at Slate Creek and 15 rock grab samples from the Slate Creek and 
Energite showings.  Of the 25 soil samples, six samples returned assays of greater than 
100 ppb Au, further establishing the gold in soil anomaly at Slate Creek; and a single 
rock grab sample (GK-04-009) collected at the Energite Showing returned assays of 6 
g/t Au, 640 g/t Ag, 29% Pb and 12% Zn (Wild, 2005).   

During 2004, Navasota expanded the Gold Creek grid from Slate Creek 
northwest to the Energite Showing; collected 1,193 soil and 47 rock grab samples; and 
completed diamond drilling of six holes totalling 884.  Of the 1,193 soils samples, 33 
returned assays of greater than 100 ppb Au.  Four diamond drill holes (GC-04-01 to 
GC-01-04) targeted soil anomalies north of Slate Creek.  All four holes intersected 
locally quartz veined and faulted Eagle Bay assemblage argillite rocks  that returned a 
few anomalous gold values over narrow widths; including 130 ppb Au over 1.5 m, and 
120 ppb Au over 1.0 m (GC-04-02); 390 ppb Au over 1.0 m, and 350 ppb Au over 1.0 m 
(GC-04-04).  Drill hole GC-04-05 intersected gabbro and diorite rocks of the Lower 
Fennell assemblage and did not return significant assays; and drill hole GC-04-06 
tested the Energite Showing adits and returned assays of 650 ppb Au over 0.45 m, and 
960 ppb Au over 1.0 m (Wild, 2005).  Both mineralized zones occur downhole, and to 
the west, of a drill intersected fault overlying a sequence of felsic tuff, quartz-feldspar-
porphyry and argillite rocks; probably of the Lower Fennel assemblage.  

Strongbow Exploration Inc. ("Strongbow") acquired the claims overlying the Chu 
Chua deposit by online staking on March 2nd, 2006. During fall 2006, Strongbow 
completed a soil geochemical survey and a compilation of historic Craigmont and 
Minnova soil sampling.  A total of 302 soil samples were collected at a spacing of 50 m 
over a series of selecteast-west oriented gridlines designed to test the geochemical 
response over the Chu Chua deposit, and select conductive anomalies from 
Craigmont's 1979 DIGEM airborne geophysical survey (Fraser and Dvorak, 1979).  Of 
the 302 samples collected by Strongbow, 264 were collected within Strachan's current 
claims.  A series of six consecutive samples collected over the Main Lens of the Chu 
Chua deposit returned anomalous values ranging from between 27 and 335 ppm Cu. A 
line crossing just north of the Main Lens, and a second line 400 m further to the north 
within Strachan's 523837 claim, did not return anomalous values.  A series of 100 and 
400 m spaced soil lines completed DIGEM and HLEM conductive anomalies within the 
southern part of the Falconbridge's Chu Chu grid (Pirie, 1985c; and Pirie 1986) 
correlated with a number of single and two sample greater than 100 ppm Cu anomalies.  
Two soil lines spaced at 100 m tested the area above Minnova's MCC-52 through MCC-
55 drill sites (Heberlein, 1990b), but did not return significant anomalies.  Compilation of 
2,703 historic Craigmont and Minnova soil samples revealed numerous single and 
multi-sample greater than 100 ppm Cu, and 125 ppm Zn, soil anomalies within 
Strachan's claims to the north and south of the Chu Chua deposit (Gale, 2007, Figure 
4). 

APEX on behalf of Longview Capital Partners supervised 2008 exploration at the 
Chu Chua Property. Exploration comprised an 840 line-km helicopter-borne AeroTEM III 
electromagnetic and magnetic geophysical survey covering the Chu Chua deposit and 
an approximately 60% area of Strachan's Current claims (Figures 5 and 6).  The survey 
defines five discreet high-priority isolated and sizeable magnetic anomalies (M1 to M5) 
and two discreet, isolated conductive anomalies (EM1 and EM2) that bear resemblance

to the magnetic and conductive anomalies associated with the Chu Chua deposit 
(Raffle, 2008).  All of the magnetic and conductive anomalies occur within Strachan's 
current claims.  The results of soil sampling by Craigmont and Minnnova (Gale, 2007) 
indicate that the M1 anomaly is coincident with a greater than 100 ppm Cu and greater 
than 75 ppm Zn soil anomaly (Figure 4). 

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Schiarizza and Preto (1987) mapped the Adams Plateau Clearwater-Vavenby 
area at 1:100,000 providing a concise regional geological picture for the Chu Chua 
property. The following regional geology section is taken from that work.  

The Chu Chua area is on the western edge of the Omineca Belt and is underlain 
by the Fennell Formation (Fm) of the Slide Mountain Assemblage to the west and by the 
Eagle Bay Assemblage to the east (Figure 7). The Early Cambrian to Mississippian 
Eagle Bay Assemblage is in the pericratonic Kootenay Terrane and consists of 
metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks which are repeated in four Northwest-dipping 
thrust sheets. The assemblage is comprised of a Lower Palaeozoic succession of 
clastic metasediments, carbonate and mafic metavolcanic rocks, and an overlying 
Devono- Mississippian succession of felsic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks and 
metasediments. The Homestake and Rea VMS deposits are hosted by intermediate to 
felsic metavolcanic rocks of the Lower Devono-Mississippian succession. 

The Slide Mountain Assemblage is part of Slide Mountain Terrane and consists 
of the Devonian to Middle Permian Fennell Formation. The formation is an oceanic 
sequence consisting of two major divisions. The structurally lower (eastern) division 
comprises a heterogeneous assemblage of bedded chert, gabbro, diabase, pillowed   
basalt, clastic metasediments, quartz-feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite and intraformational 
conglomerate. The upper (western) division consists almost entirely of pillowed and 
massive basalt with gabbro and minor bedded chert and argillite. Both intrusive and 
extrusive mafic igneous rocks are tholeiitic. Tops throughout the succession consistently 
face west. 

The Fennell Formation and Eagle Bay Assemblage are intruded by mid-
Cretaceous granodiorite and quartz-monzonite of the Raft and Baldy batholiths. The 
package is locally overlain by Eocene Kamloops Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks 
and Miocene lavas. The map area is dominated by easterly directed thrust faults, which 
imbricate the Fennell Formation and separate it from the underlying Eagle Bay 
Assemblage. Tectonic emplacement of the Fennell Formation over the Eagle Bay 
Assemblage was followed by southwesterly directed folding and associated thrust 
faulting. Folding and fabrics associated with this event are evident in the Eagle Bay 
Assemblage, but are rarely seen in the Fennell Formation. 

7.2 Property Geology 

The following summary of the local geology is reprinted from Heberlein (1990b). 
Detailed discussion of individual lithological units can be found in Wild (1989). The Chu 
Chua property is underlain by rocks of the Mississippian to Permian Fennell Fm (Figure 
8) (Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).

Two litho-structural packages make up the Fennell Formation These are called 
the upper and lower divisions. The lower division forms a north-south belt that extends 
from the Barriere River fault in the south to Clearwater in the north. It is composed of a 
complexly interbedded and thrust imbricated sequence of massive basalt, clastic 
metasediments (greywackes and argillites), ribbon cherts, quartz-feldspar phyric rhyolite 
and intraformational conglomerate. The upper division underlies most of the property 
area and hosts the Chu Chua deposit. It consists of pillowed to massive basalt flows, 
diabase sills, argillite and rare chert. These rocks can be traced from Barriere as far 
north as Wells Grey Park. They are responsible for the rugged cliff exposures on either 
side of the North Thompson River Valley between Little Fort and Clearwater. 

Both divisions of the Fennell Formation are intruded by the Cretaceous Baldy 
Batholith, which forms a prominent easterly trending mountain range to the northeast of 
Barriere. 

Deformation in the Fennell Formation is not intense. Units have been rotated into 
a vertically dipping west facing homocline that is interpreted to be the western limb of a 
thrust-dismembered anticline (Schiarizza and Preto, 1987). There is little evidence for 
mesoscopic folding and penetrative fabrics are mostly absent. Late, north and east 
trending normal faults possibly of Tertiary age caused local offsets of the Upper Fennell 
stratigraphy. A west-dipping thrust fault is inferred to separate the upper and lower 
divisions of the Fennell Formation. This is based on conodont ages determined from 
chert beds in both divisions. The Lower Fennell sequence is also inferred to be thrust 
imbricated based on fossil data (Schiarizza and Preto, 1987). 

Both Fennell Formation divisions are regionally metamorphosed to lower 
greenschist facies. Close to the contact of the Baldy Batholith (within approximately 500 
m) the regional metamorphism is overprinted by a contact thermal aureole. Locally this 
reaches hornfels facies. Despite the metamorphism, primary textures are well preserved 
in both volcanic and sedimentary units. 

7.3 Mineralization 

There are a total of seven (7) principal mineral occurrences within the Property 
(Figure 8). The Chu Chua North and MCC showings occur within the Upper Fennell 
Formation. The North Star, Energite, and Joe showings all fall within Eagle Bay 
Assemblage along the contact with Lower Fennell Formation. To the south of the 
Property the Chip-Dixie Showing is hosted within Eagle Bay Assemblage. The North 
Dome and SC showings occur within felsic volcanic rocks of the Lower Fennel 
Assemblage.  All diamond drill intercepts reported are core length and may not be 
indicative of true width of mineralization.   

7.3.1 Chu Chua North 

The Chu Chua North Showing lies immediately north of the Chu Chua deposit 
within southwestern part of the claim 523837 and is defined by diamond drill 
intersections only.  Historic drill holes intersected anomalous Cu, Zn, Ag, and Au values 
over widths ranging from 1.3 m to 4.3 m.  Mineralization comprising 5 to 10% pyrite 
bands and stringers with trace chalcopyrite is hosted within felsic-intermediate volcanic 
rocks of Upper Fennell Formation and was intersected within two inclined drill holes 
(CC-34 and CCF-60) at drilled depths of 15 and 83 metres, respectively.

7.3.2 MCC 

The MCC Showing was discovered during 1990 diamond drill testing of 
coincident EM and magnetic ground geophysical anomalies at the head of Birk and Chu 
Chua creeks, 3 km south of the Chu Chua Deposit. Anomalous Cu and Ag values were 
intersected within drill hole MCC-56 over 3.7 m.  Mineralization, intersected at a drilled 
depth of 89 m, was hosted within sericite altered wacke, graphitic argillite and chert 
rocks and comprised 1 to 3% bedded pyrite, trace chalcopyrite, and a 15 cm interval of 
massive sulphide.  

7.3.3 Energite 

The Energite Showing is located to the north of claim 890259. Historic production 
from Energite totaled 36 (metric) tonnes producing 3,732 g Ag, 1,581 kg Cu, 1,341 kg 
Pb and 652 kg Zn. Mineralization consists of galena, pyrite, and lesser sphalerite and 
chalcopyrite-bearing quartz veins that cut sheared rocks along the faulted contact of the 
Lower Fennell Formation and Eagle Bay Assemblage. Individual veins and lenses vary 
from a few centimetres to several metres wide and vary in orientation, although 
northerly strikes and moderate (40 to 50 degree) easterly dips predominate (B.C. Minfile 
082M 218).  

7.3.4 Joe 

The Joe Showing is located at the head of Slate Creek within the 889827 claim. 
Exploration during 1986 resulted in the discovery of a shale-hosted sulphide showing 
containing massive galena and quartz veins.  Four rock samples were submitted for 
assay.  Sample J-1 returned 2.1 g/t Au and 92.75 g/t Ag; and sample Q-1 returned 1.44 
g/t Au and 43.7 g/t Ag (Moraal, 1986).  Subsequent soil sampling defined an 
approximately 200 x 200 m Au-Ag-Pb-Zn soil anomaly centred over the occurrence 
(Ovington, 1989). 

7.3.5 Chip-Dixie 

The Chip-Dixie Showing is located at the south end of the Property, within the 
857335 claim.  Geologic mapping during 1984 defined a 900 x 400 m east-west 
oriented rusty weathering gossan zone hosted within quartz-eye tuff rocks extending 
east from Chip Creek.  A single rock grab sample from this zone returned 655 ppm Zn 
(DC-9).  Soil geochemical surveys completed at the same time identified an in part 
coincident lead-zinc anomaly (Kermeen, 1985). 

7.3.6 SC & North Domes 

The SC and North Dome showings were discovered during 1986 diamond drilling 
of HLEM conductive anomalies and a sequence of rhyolite flows and tuff rocks within 
the south central Chu Chua Property claims.  Drill hole BAR-1 tested the North Dome 
and intersected a 10 m wide zone of sericite altered rhyolite tuff that returned assays of 
590 ppb Au over 1 m.  Drill hole BAR-3 tested the SC Dome and collared into a 59 m 
interval of quartz veined, silica-sericite altered rhyolite containing an average of 4-7% 
pyrite.  The interval returned assays of 4.45 g/t Au over 2.52 m, including a 30 cm 
section of massive pyrite assaying 17.6 g/t Au and 134 g/t Ag; above a broader 
mineralized zone averaging 242 ppb Au over 13.98 m (Evans, 1987).

Subsequent drilling by Minnova tested the western flank of the North Dome.  
Silica-sericite altered rhyolite and tuffaceous argillite intersected within drill hole CCF-16 
returned assays of 1.1 g/t Au over 3 m between 94.5 and 97.5 m depth (Gray, 1987). 

 
In 1987, Minnova continued diamond drilling of the SC dome with eight holes 

(BAR-8 through BAR-15) totalling 705 m.   Drill hole BAR-8 returned two separate near 
surface intersections assaying 1.23 and 1.39 g/t Au over 1.5 m; BAR-9 returned 0.78 g/t 
Au over 15 m, including 2.04 g/t Au over 4 m;  BAR-10 returned 7.51 g/t Au over 0.4 m 
and, 1.79 g/t Au over 1.5 m; BAR-11 returned 0.6% Cu, 3.8% Pb, 4.8% Zn and 110 g/t 
Ag over 0.45 m; and BAR-12 returned 0.59 g/t Au over 9 m.  Drill hole BAR-14 
intersected pyrite-sphalerite mineralized tuffaceous chert, south of Sprague Creek, that 
returned assays of 0.18% Zn over 10 m; hole BAR-15 did not intersect significant 
mineralization (Gray & Pirie, 1988). 

8 Deposit Types 

The principal deposit of interest on the Chu Chua property is a Cyprus-type 
volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS). The stratigraphy underlying the property is also 
prospective for Kuroko-type massive sulphide deposits as shown by the presence of 
several of these deposits proximal to the property. In general terms, VMS deposits are 
an important source of copper, lead and zinc with lesser precious  metals  and  
comprise  a  massive  sulphide  ore  lens  underlain  by  a stringer zone of intensely 
altered rocks hosting vein and disseminated ore (Franklin, 1993). These deposits are 
generally hosted in volcanic rocks of varying compositions with associated but less 
abundant sedimentary rocks. Quartz veins hosting base- and/or precious-metals may 
also be significant when considering the numerous occurrences of this mineralization 
type surrounding the Chu Chua property. 

8.1 Cyprus Massive Sulphide 

Cyprus-type massive sulphide deposits are part of the volcanic-associated 
massive sulphide deposits spectrum, present in ophiolite sequences, dominated by 
mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks (Galley and Koski, 1999). These ophiolite 
sequences form in fore-arc and back-arc environments and comprise sheeted dyke 
complexes overlain by volcanic successions of lava flows, pillow lavas, breccias, 
hyaloclastites, feeder dykes and sills and interstitial sediments. Driven by the heat of 
underlying magma chambers, hydrothermal fluids circulate through the volcanic pile 
scavenging metals, redepositing them as massive, stratiform sulphide lenses typically 
composed of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and magnetite; the underlying 
stringer/feeder zone typically consists of quartz and pyrite with minimal base metal 
content. The sulphide lenses are commonly clustered in groups and can often be found 
along strike of other lenses. In British Columbia, workers have noted a common 
alignment of these lenses near steep, normal faults (Hoy, 1995). 

Cyprus-type deposits in British Columbia are primarily Mississippian-Permian or 
late-Triassic in age; the most significant of which are the Anyox deposits which range 
from 0.2 to 23.7 million tonnes in size and average grades of 1.5% Cu, 9.9 g/t Ag and 
0.17 g/t Au (Hoy, 1995). The authors have not verified the size and/or grade of the 
deposits described by Hoy (1995) and the mineralization contained within these 
deposits may or may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Chu Chua Property.

Exploration for these deposits is aided by the highly conductive massive sulphide 
bodies that can be readily identified using various electromagnetic, magnetic, or 
induced-polarization geophysical techniques. Soil sampling typically resolves 
anomalous levels of copper, zinc, and other associated elements. When rock exposure 
allows, prospecting and mapping should focus on altered packages of submarine mafic 
to ultramafic volcanic rocks.  Alteration of these rock types results in common chlorite-
talc-carbonate-magnetite assemblages; the underlying stringer zone can be typified by 
this assemblage with accompanying quartz-pyrite veins (Hoy, 1995). 

8.2 Kuroko Massive Sulphide 

Kuroko (or Noranda) type massive sulphide deposits are typically found within 
felsic volcanic rocks in calc-alkaline, bimodal arc successions. They form during the  
development  of  island  arc  complexes  during  rifting  within  or  behind  an oceanic or 
continental margin (Hoy, 1995). Host rocks to these deposits are typically rhyolite-dacite 
submarine volcanic rocks with associated andesites or, less commonly, mafic volcanic 
rocks or sedimentary rocks. Mineralization, including pyrite, sphalerite, galena and 
chalcopyrite, is found within one or more lenses of massive sulfides, commonly zoned 
with a Cu-rich base and a Pb+Zn-rich top. These deposits can also have significant 
concentrations of precious- metals including silver and gold. Underneath these lenses, 
low-grade stringer zones are common, and barite or chert layers commonly overlie 
these lenses. As with the Cyprus-type deposits, the massive sulphide lens forms above 
a hydrothermal-fluid cell with the stringer zone representing the remains of the conduit 
of these fluids. Individual sulphide lenses vary in thickness from metres to tens of 
metres with strike lengths of tens to hundreds of metres. 

In British Columbia, Kuroko-type deposits are the most common form of VMS 
deposits, principally hosted by the late-Devonian Eagle Bay Assemblage located 
northeast of Kamloops and the late-Devonian Sicker group on Vancouver Island (Hoy, 
1995). Less commonly they are Permian-Mississippian, late-Triassic, early- middle 
Jurassic, or Cretaceous in age. Deposits in British Columbia range from less than 1 
million tonnes to more than 10 million tonnes. The most notable Kuroko deposits in 
British Columbia, the H-W and Kutcho, are reported to contain 10.1 million tonnes 
grading 2.0% Cu, 3.5% Zn, 0.3% Pb, 30.4 g/t Ag and 2.1 g/t Au and 17 million tonnes 
grading 1.6% Cu, 2.3% Zn, 0.06% Pb, 29 g/t Ag and 0.3 g/t Au, respectively (Hoy, 
1995). The authors have not verified the grade and tonnage information provided by 
Hoy (1995) and it is not necessarily indicative of mineralization within the Chu Chua 
Property. 

Exploration for Kuroko deposits parallels that for the Cyprus deposits save 
differences in the host rocks and associated alteration. Felsic volcanic domes and 
centres should be investigated along with pyrite and chert horizons, all of which display 
quartz-sericite-chlorite alteration with distal clay mineral-, albite-, or carbonate-
alteration. 

8.3 Epithermal Veins 

Epithermal veins represent a broad spectrum mineral exploration target in that 
they are present in rocks of all types and ages in a range of tectonic settings and can 
host a wide variety of metals, including but not limited to Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, can be 
either monometallic or polymetallic ores. Because of this variability they are difficult to

describe in general terms. The common association of these veins to massive sulphide 
deposits increases their importance in the Chu Chua area. Deposits of this kind typically 
consist of quartz veins formed penecontemporaneously that may cross-cut one another 
though they were generated from the same event. The location and morphology of 
these veins are largely controlled by rheological contrasts in the host rocks and by ore-
controlling structures. These deposits can also contain multiple stages of mineralization, 
presumably related to episodic tectonism associated with increased intrusive activity 
and magmatic hydrothermal fluid generation (Panteleyev, 1996). The country rock 
surrounding epithermal veins is commonly extensively altered even though the vein 
walls may be sharply defined. Alteration can be laterally restricted but large overprints of 
clay minerals, sericite and chlorite are possible; more proximal alteration will comprise 
pyrite and quartz with lesser carbonate minerals. It is also not uncommon to find large, 
highly colourful supergene gossans covering epithermal ores. 

Lefebure and Church (1996) suggest that for polymetallic veins in British 
Columbia larger than 20,000 tonnes, the average size is 161,000 tonnes with grades of 
304 g/t Ag, 3.47 % Pb and 2.66 % Zn. Within these, gold and copper are of significant 
abundance in only half of the instances with average grades of 4 g/t Au and 0.09% Cu. 
The authors have not verified the information provided by Lefebure and Church (1996) 
and it is not necessarily indicative of mineralization within the Chu Chua Property. 

Exploration for these deposits focuses on second-order structural features 
adjacent to crustal-scale faults or structures surrounding volcanic centres. 
Geophysically, these deposits are commonly linear magnetic lows and may have 
detectable electromagnetic or induced-polarization responses due to the sulphide 
content. Soil geochemistry can show elevations of the aforementioned principal 
elements as well as arsenic, mercury, antimony, bismuth, molybdenum, tin, tungsten 
and manganese. 

9 Exploration 

During 2010 and 2011, Shenul Capital Inc. ("Shenul"), on behalf of the Optionors, 
completed exploration within the Chu Chua Property that included ground magnetic and 
VLF-EM geophysical surveys, soil and rock grab geochemical surveys, and diamond 
drilling of three (3) holes totalling 521.5 m.  Shenul retained PAC Geological Consulting 
Inc. (PAC) in 2010 to complete the exploration program recommended by Raffle and 
Dufresne (2010).  Dr. Peter A. Christopher, P. Eng. of PAC supervised all field 
exploration work.  The total expenditures for the 2010 and 2011 Chu Chua Property 
exploration exceed $200,000.   

A total of 26.3 line-km of ground magnetic, and 28.1 line-km of VLF-EM survey 
data was obtained; in addition to the collection of 928 soil, 35 rock and 27 split drill core 
geochemical samples.  Ground geophysical and soil geochemical surveys were 
completed over the EM1, EM2, and North Dome conductive anomalies (Figure 9). All of 
the exploration on the Chu Chua Property was carried out by Shenul or contractors on 
behalf of Shenul.  To date, Strachan has not conducted any exploration at Chu Chua 
Property.

9.1 Geophysical Program 

Ground magnetic and VLF-EM geophysical surveys over the EM1 (including part 
of the M2 magnetic anomaly), EM2 (including part of the M3 and M5 magnetic 
anomalies), and North Dome conductive anomalies were completed during two 
separate periods; from June 19 to October 19, 2010, and from July 5 to July 29, 2011. 

A total of 26.3 line-km of ground magnetic, and 28.1 line-km of VLF-EM survey 
data was obtained that included: 13.5 line-km of magnetics and VLF-EM at the EM1 
grid; and 8.6 line-km of magnetics, and 7.2 line-km of VLF-EM at the EM2 grid; and 4.3 
line-km of magnetic, and 7.4 line-km of VLF-EM at the North Dome grid (Figure 9). 

Geophysical data was collected at 25 m spacing along a series of 100 m spaced 
east-west oriented gridlines.  Grid placement was based on the location of conductive 
and magnetic anomalies as defined by the 2008 AeroTEM III helicopter-borne 
electromagnetic and magnetic geophysical survey (Raffle, 2008).  Ground magnetic 
survey data was acquired with a Geometrics Portable Proton Magnetometer Model G-
856 (EM1 grid), and a Scintrex MP2 Portable Proton Magnetometer (EM2 and North 
Dome grids) with a staff mounted sensors.  Diurnal variation was determined by the 
collection duplicate readings at a fixed location following completion of each survey line.  
Magnetic diurnal variation for all grids was determined to be less than 10 nano-tesla 
(nT).  Magnetic amplitude of the observed anomalies was approximately 1000 nT, 
therefore it is the opinion of the author that the magnetic data quality is acceptable 
(Figure 9). 

The EM1 grid is centred on the EM1 AeroTEM III conductive anomaly and the 
northern half of two sub-parallel, north-south trending linear magnetic high anomalies 
that comprise the M2 anomaly.  The VLF-EM survey defines an approximately 800 m 
north-northeast trending moderate strength conductive axis coincident with the peak 
conductivity (greater than 100 nT/s) of the EM1 airborne anomaly.  A number of 
peripheral weak single and multi-line conductive anomalies flanking the EM1 anomaly 
were also identified.  The results of the EM1 ground magnetic survey show the EM1 
conductive anomaly is flanked to the west by a prominent north-south trending 1000 nT 
linear magnetic high anomaly.  Mapping by Shiarizza and Preto (1987) indicates the 
EM1 anomaly is underlain by chert, cherty argillite, slate and phyllite flanked to the east 
and west by diabase and gabbro rocks; all of the Lower Fennell Formation.  Similarly, 
PAC observed magnetite-bearing gabbro along the west side of the EM1 grid coincident 
with the magnetic anomaly. 

The EM2 grid comprises a series of four (4) east-west oriented survey lines 
spaced at 100 m intervals that overlaps the northernmost part of the EM2 AeroTEM III 
conductive, and the M3 and M5 linear magnetic high anomalies.  Geophysical survey 
coverage does not extend south due to the steep terrain at the head of Sprague Creek.  
The VLF-EM survey defines two (2) northwest trending weak-moderate strength 
conductive axis anomalies spanning four (4) gridlines and a number of weak single and 
multi-line conductive axis anomalies (Figure 9).  The two weak-moderate strength 
anomalies flank the northern terminus of the EM2 conductive anomaly. Peak 
conductivity values (greater than 100 nT/s) were not expected within the EM2 grid area 
given that much of the EM2 anomaly lies further south.  Similar to the EM1 anomaly, 
mapping by Shiarizza and Preto (1987) indicates the EM2 anomaly is underlain by a

narrow belt of chert, cherty argillite, slate and phyllite flanked to the east and west by 
diabase and gabbro rocks.  The position of the EM2 airborne anomaly is coincident the 
narrow belt of chert, cherty argillite, slate and phyllite occurring along the axis of a broad 
south sloping ridgeline.  Ground magnetics define two north-south tending 
approximately 1000 nT linear magnetic high anomalies within the western half of the 
grid.  The easternmost magnetic anomaly (M3) occurs within a north-south trending 
tributary of Sprague Creek and flanks the EM2 conductive anomaly along its western 
margin.  The northern terminus of the M3 magnetic anomaly lies along the western 
edge of the EM2 grid within an area of low topographic relief. 

The North Dome grid lies on the eastern margin of area covered by the 2008 
AeroTEM III survey.  The grid extends 300 m east of the of the boundary of the airborne 
survey in an effort to cover a moderate 50 nT/s partially defined conductive anomaly 
along the eastern margin of the airborne survey block (Figures 6).  The North Dome 
VLF-EM survey defined a number of weak multi-line north-south trending conductive 
axis anomalies within the western half of the grid that do not appear to directly correlate 
with airborne conductive anomalies.  Isolated moderate line conductive axis anomalies 
within the northeast quadrant of the grid may correlate in part with the airborne 
conductive anomaly.  Ground magnetics defines an apparently northwest trending 200 
nT magnetic high anomaly within the northeast quadrant of the grid that is coincident 
with the airborne conductive anomaly (Figure 9). 

9.2 Geochemical Program 

Soil and rock grab geochemical sampling over the EM1, EM2 and North Dome 
grids was completed during two separate periods; from July 19 to October 19, 2010, 
and from July 5 to July 29, 2011.  A total of 928 soil and 35 rock grab geochemical 
samples were collected.   

Soil geochemical samples were collected at 25 m intervals along a series of 100 
m spaced, east-west oriented gridlines (Figures 10 and 11).  Soil samples were 
collected from the "B" horizon, generally at a depth of 15 to 20 centimetres (cm) using a 
mattock and placed in Kraft paper sample bags labelled with the appropriate grid line 
and station coordinates.  Soil sites were marked in the field on aluminum tags stapled to 
cedar lath pickets, and their locations recorded using GPS accurate to plus or minus 5 
m.  Samples were dried prior to submission by PAC to ACME Analytical Laboratories 
Ltd. (ACME), Vancouver, B.C. for analysis.  Select rock grab samples were collected 
from representative and apparently mineralized lithologies within the EM1, North Dome 
and SC Showing areas.  Rock samples ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 kilograms (kg) in weight 
and were placed in uniquely labelled poly samples bags and their locations were 
recorded using handheld GPS accurate to plus or minus 5 m.  Rock grab samples were 
collected by PAC and Gerald Locke, and were submitted to ACME and Eco Tech 
Laboratories Ltd. (Eco Tech), Kamloops, B.C. for analysis.   

Of the 928 soil geochemical samples collected, a total of 78 samples returned 
greater than 50 ppm Cu and are considered anomalous (the 90

th
 percentile is 46 ppm 

Cu).  Of the 78 samples that returned greater than 50 ppm Cu, a total of 10 samples 
returned greater than 100 ppm Cu, and up to 253 ppm Cu (sample L897+00N  75+25E).

The soil geochemical survey defines numerous spot Cu anomalies, two multi-
sample and multi-line Cu in soil anomalies within the northern half of the EM1 grid, and 
one multi-sample and multi-line soil anomaly within the North Dome grid (Figure 10).  
Within the northeast quadrant of the EM1 grid in area of low topographic relief, six (6) 
adjacent soil samples returned 53 to 186 ppm Cu; and on the sample line 100 m to the 
south three (3) adjacent samples returned 53 to 253 ppm Cu (sample L897+00N  
75+25E).  Within the northwest quadrant of the EM1 grid, 15 samples within a 300 x 400 
m area returned 53 to 136 ppm Cu.  Within the North Dome grid six (6) soil samples on 
adjacent lines within the eastern tributary of Sprague Creek returned 50 to 141 ppm Cu.   

Of the 928 soils collected a total of 85 samples returned assays of greater than 
10 ppb Au and are considered anomalous (the 90

th
 percentile is 9 ppb Au).  Of the 85 

samples that returned greater than 10 ppb Au, a total of 11 samples returned assays of 
greater than 50 ppb Au (sample L56876+00N 7074+00E returned assays of 358 ppb 
Au).  Ten of the 11 samples returning greater than 50 ppb Au were collected within the 
North Dome grid; the remaining sample (L56891+00N 7068+25E) returned assays of 65 
ppb Au and was collected from the EM1 grid (Figure 11).  Eleven soil samples returned 
greater than 10 ppb Au within east half of the EM2 grid (sample L56877+00N 7087+00E 
returned 48 ppb Au), a distance of 1500 m to the south along strike of the lithologic 
units.  In the northern half of the EM1 grid, 12 soil samples returned assays of greater 
than 10 ppb Au (sample L899+00N 68+00E returned 34.7 ppb Au) that define an 
approximately 600 x 200 m, northwest trending gold and coincident copper anomaly.  

Gold in soil anomalies within the North Dome grid are widely distributed and are 
underlain by undifferentiated rocks of the Lower Fennell assemblage (Schiarizza and 
Preto, 1987).  Falconbridge drill hole BAR-1, located 400 m south the North Dome grid 
intersected a 10 m wide zone of sericite altered rhyolite tuff that returned assays of 590 
ppb Au over 1 m (Evans, 1987).  Subsequent drilling by Minnova along the western 
edge of the North Dome grid intersected silica-sericite altered rhyolite and tuffaceous 
argillite (CCF-16) that returned assays of 1.1 g/t Au over 3 m (Pirie, 1988).  Detailed 
geologic mapping, also by Falconbridge, completed over part of the south and east 
quadrant of the North Dome grid indicates gold in soil anomalies are underlain 
predominantly by quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusive, felsic tuff; and lesser chert, argillite-
phyllite and diorite (Evans, 1987).  This suggests anomalous gold values are at least in 
part associated with felsic volcanic rocks of the Lower Fennell assemblage.  The 
possible bedrock source of copper and gold in soil anomalies within the EM1 grid are 
unknown.   

Limited rock grab sampling returned anomalous gold values in the North Dome 
and EM2 grid areas.  Of the 35 rock grab samples collected, eight (8) samples returned 
assays of greater than 100 ppb Au and are considered anomalous.  In the northeast 
corner of the EM2 grid, rock grab sampling within a zone of quartz veined, quartz-
feldspar-porphyry containing disseminated pyrite mineralization, in contact with 
gossanous argillite rocks cut by 5-10 cm west-dipping quartz veinlets returned multiple 
anomalous gold values (now known as the New Discovery Zone).  Six (6) composite 
rock grab samples over a 25 m zone of outcrop exposed in a recent logging road cut 
returned assays of ranging between 0.25 g/t Au and up to 3.67 g/t Au (sample "Sulphide 
#2").  Two additional samples collected 200 m to the east (sample #4-82511), and 800 
m to the north (sample "Chu Chua North CCN1") of the New Discovery Zone returned 
assays of 160 and 170 ppb Au, respectively.

10 Drilling 

Shenul completed three (3) BQTK (40.8 mm diameter) diamond drill holes, 
totalling 521.5 m within the EM1 grid area between the dates of September 20 and 
October 17, 2010.  PAC directly supervised the diamond drill program, and completed 
geologic logging and geochemical sampling of core.  Drill hole locations are 
summarized in Table 2 and shown in Figure 12 below.  Diamond drill hole cross-
sections are presented in Appendix 1.

A total of 27 half-split drill core samples were submitted by PAC to ACME for 

inductively coupled mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) multi-element analysis.  Samples 
were split using a mechanical core splitter and were placed in uniquely labelled poly 
rock sample bags keyed to drill hole number and sample depth interval.  The length of 
each core sample interval was determined based on lithology and the presence of 
mineralization (disseminated pyrite, quartz and/or carbonate veining). Individual drill 
core samples varied from 1.52 to 3.05 m in length.   

 
No significant mineralization was intersected within the three drill holes 

(Appendix 2).  Drill hole CCS10-01 (270
o
az/-58

o
) was collared 375 m to the east of the 

EM1 conductive axis (Figure 12) and collared into gabbro-diorite giving way and depth 
to grey chert until end of hole at 114.91 m (Appendix 1).  These results indicate the 
chert, cherty-argillite unit mapped by Schiarizza and Preto (1987) extends further east 
than currently mapped, or that it may dip eastward.  Drill hole CCS10-02 (270

o
az/-58

o
), 

collared 300 m to the southwest of CCS10-01, intersected a sequence of gabbro and 
diorite, and magnetite bearing basalt-gabbro at depth until end of hole at 203.3 m.  The 
presence of magnetic basalt-gabbro likely explains the M2 magnetic anomaly.  Drill hole 
CCS10-03 (090

o
az/-55

o
) was collared to the north of the EM1 conductive and M2 

magnetic anomalies.  The drill hole intersected fine-grained chlorite altered andesite-
basalt, and locally interplayed chert consistent with the Upper Fennell assemblage.  The 
drill hole terminated in a 12 m core width fault-shear zone.  Given the position of the drill 
hole, the fault-shear zone may correlate with the interpreted thrust fault contact between 
the Upper and Lower Fennell assemblage. 

 
The 2010 drill hole locations appear to have been largely dictated by access 

considerations (i.e proximity to existing logging roads).  It is the opinion of the author 
that the drilling does not adequately test the EM1 conductive anomaly.  Similarly, drill 
hole CCS10-01 was not ideally positioned to test the northwest trending copper and 
gold soil anomaly identified by the 2010 sampling (Figure 12).  The drilling indicates that 
chert-argillite rocks likely underlie the EM1 anomaly.  It is possible that graphitic argillite

rocks may be the source of the EM1 conductive anomaly; though this has not been 
determined.  The conductive response of EM1 anomaly (approximately 500-700 nT/s) is 
comparable to that of the Chu Chua Deposit (approximately 500 nT/s) therefore the 
possibility that the anomaly is due to a massive sulphide source remains. 

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

Soil, rock grabs, and drill core samples were submitted to ACME Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd. (ACME), Vancouver, B.C., Eco Tech Laboratories Ltd. (Eco Tech), 
Kamloops, B.C., and ALS Minerals (ALS), North Vancouver, B.C. for analysis.  Rock 
grab samples collected by the author were submitted to ALS.  Acme, Eco Tech and ALS 
are International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001:2008 and ISO 17025-2005 
certified geochemical analysis and assaying laboratories and are independent of the 
Optionors, Strachan and the author.   

ACME, Eco Tech and ALS did not report anything unusual with respect to the 
shipments, once received.  PAC, Gerald Locke and the author did not have control over 
the samples at all times during transport, and therefore cannot personally verify what 
happened to the samples from shipping up to the time they were received by the 
laboratory.  However, the author has no reason to believe that the security of the 
samples was compromised. 

Shenul did not employ internal quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
measures (including the insertion of field duplicate, Certified Reference Material (CRM), 
or blank samples) during the 2010 and 2011 exploration.  Shenul has instead relied 
upon external QA/QC measures implemented by ACME, Eco Tech and ALS, which 
includes routine analysis of CRM's, blank, repeat and re-split sample analysis.  

ACME QA/QC measures incorporate a coarse blank preceding the first client 
sample that is carried through preparation and analysis. Typically an analytical batch 
will comprise of 34 to 36 client samples, a pulp duplicate to monitor analytical precision, 
a less than 10 mesh (1.7 mm) reject duplicate to monitor sub-sampling variation (rock 
and drill core), a reagent blank to measure background and an aliquot of CRM or In-
house reference material to monitor accuracy.  Using these inserted quality control 
samples each analytical batch and complete job is reviewed and validated before to 
final approval and certification. 

 
QA/QC measures at ALS and Eco Tech include routine screen tests to verify 

crushing efficiency, sample preparation duplicates (every 50 samples), and analytical 
quality controls (blanks, standards, and duplicates). QC samples are inserted with each 
analytical run, with the minimum number of QC samples dependant on the rack size 
specific to the chosen analytical method. Results for quality control samples that fall 
beyond the established limits are automatically red-flagged for serious failures and 
yellow-flagged for borderline results. Every batch of samples is subject to a dual 
approval and review process, both by the individual analyst and the Department 
Manager, before final approval and certification.   

 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, security and analytical 

procedures were adequate for this stage of exploration on the properties.  However, the 
author recommends that future exploration by Strachan should incorporate a 



4

42 

 

comprehensive QA/QC program including the insertion of 10% field duplicate, CRM, 
and blank samples into the sample stream to monitor analytical precision and accuracy. 

11.1 Soil Sampling 

Soil samples were collected by PAC and Gerald Locke from the "B" horizon, 
generally at a depth of 15 to 20 centimetres (cm) using a mattock, and placed in Kraft 
paper sample bags labelled with the appropriate grid line and station coordinates.  Soil 
sites were marked in the field on aluminum tags stapled to cedar lath pickets, and their 
locations recorded using GPS accurate to plus or minus 5 m.  Samples were dried prior 
to submission by PAC to ACME for analysis.  At ACME, soil samples were dried at 60°C 
and a 100 g sample was sieved to -80 mesh (0.18 mm) and subject to ACME's "1DX2" 
method, whereby a 15 g samples split is dissolved in hot (95

o
C) aqua-regia and  

inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.  Detection limits of 0.1 ppm 
to 10,000 ppm Cu and 0.5 ppb to 100 ppm Au were achieved using the 1DX2 method. 

11.2 Rock Sampling 

Select rock samples were collected from representative and apparently 
mineralized lithologies within the EM1, North Dome and SC Showing areas.  Rock 
samples ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 kilograms (kg) in weight and were placed in uniquely 
labelled poly samples bags and their locations were recorded using handheld GPS 
accurate to plus or minus 5 m.  Rock grab samples were collected and submitted by 
PAC, Gerald Locke and the author to ACME, Eco Tech and ALS, respectively. 

Twenty-four rock samples were sent to ACME for analysis by PAC. These 
samples were crushed and a 250 g split was then pulverized to 200 mesh (0.08 mm).  
Samples were then subject to ACME's "1DX2" method, whereby a 15 g sample split is 
dissolved in hot (95

o
C) aqua-regia and subject to ICP-MS analysis.  Detection limits of 

0.1 ppm to 10,000 ppm Cu and 0.5 ppb to 100 ppm Au were achieved using the 1DX2 
method. 

Eleven rock samples sent to Eco Tech for analysis by Gerald Locke.  These 
samples were crushed and a 250 g split was then pulverized to -150 mesh (0.10 mm).  
Samples were then subject to fire assay whereby a 30 g split is fused with a flux mixture 
and inquarted with purified silver nitrate to produce a precious metal bead.  The bead is 
digested using nitric followed by hydrochloric acid solutions and then analyzed by 
atomic absorption (AA).  The detection limit for standard FA analysis is 5 to 1000 ppb 
Au.  Over range values are subject to gravimetric Au determination.  Samples submitted 
to Eco Tech were also subject to inductively coupled atomic emission spectroscopy 
(ICP-AES) multi-element analysis, whereby a 0.5 g sample is digested at 95

o
C in a 

hydrochloric and nitric acid solution and analyzed by ICP-AES against certified 
reference standards.   

Rock samples collected by the author during the Property visit were submitted to 
ALS for FA and ICP-AES analysis.  The samples were crushed to 10 mesh (1.7 mm) 
using a jaw crusher.  The samples were then split using a riffle splitter, and sample 
splits were further crushed to pass 200 mesh using a ring mill pulverizer (ALS PREP-31 
procedure).    For FA/ICP-AES analysis, a 30 g sample is fused with a flux mixture, 
inquarted with 6 mg of gold-free silver and then cupelled to yield a precious metal bead.  
The bead is then digested in 0.5 ml dilute nitric and concentrated hydrochloric acid, 



4

Technical Report on the Chu Chua Property 

 

43 

 

diluted to a total volume of 4 ml, and analyzed by ICP-AES against matrix-matched 
standards (ALS Au-ICP21 procedure).  For copper determination by ICP-AES analysis, 
a prepared sample is digested with nitric, perchloric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric 
acids, diluted to 12.5 ml, and analyzed by ICP-AES (ALS ME-OG62 procedure). 

11.3 Core Sampling 

A total of 27 half-split drill core samples were submitted by PAC to ACME for 
ICP-MS multi-element analysis.  Samples were split using a mechanical core splitter 
and were placed in uniquely labelled poly rock sample bags keyed to drill hole number 
and sample depth interval.  The length of each core sample interval was determined 
based on lithology and the presence of mineralization (disseminated pyrite, quartz 
and/or carbonate veining). Individual drill core samples varied from 1.52 to 3.05 m in 
length. 

Drill core samples were crushed and a 250 g split was then pulverized to 200 
mesh (0.08 mm).  Samples were then subject to ACME's "1DX2" method, whereby a 15 
g sample split is dissolved in hot (95

o
C) aqua-regia and subject to ICP-MS analysis.  

Detection limits of 0.1 ppm to 10,000 ppm Cu and 0.5 ppb to 100 ppm Au were 
achieved using the 1DX2 method. 

11.4 Data Verification 

The author conducted a reconnaissance of the Chu Chua Property on June 
26

th
, 2012 to verify the historically reported exploration results. The author completed 

a traverse of the SC Showing area and observed quartz vein and disseminated pyrite 
mineralized quartz-feldspar porphyritic felsic volcanic rocks of the Lower Fennel 
assemblage and diamond drill hole collars consistent with those reported historically

samples as 'replicate' samples from the New Discovery Zone and SC Showing

13 Mineral Resource Estimates 

There are currently no mineral resources, as defined by as defined in "CIM 
Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves" dated November 27th, 
2010, on the Property. 

14 Adjacent Properties 

The section titled "Adjacent Properties" is based on a review of available public 
company documents including press releases, annual reports, and NI 43-101 
technical reports as listed in the "References" section. All sources of information 
referred to in this section were prepared by Qualified Person's as defined by NI 43-
101 and are assumed accurate.  .  Diamond drill intercepts reported are core length 
and may not be indicative of true width of mineralization.   

14.1 Chu Chua Deposit 

The current Strachan claims surround the Chu Chua deposit owned by Reva 
Resources Ltd. (Reva) (Figure 8).  Pursuant to an agreement dated November 22, 
2010 Reva granted Newport Exploration Ltd. (Newport) an option to acquire a 50% 
interest in the Chu Chua claims.   On June 26, 2012, Newport announced a NI 43-101 
compliant resource estimate for the Chu Chua deposit comprising an inferred mineral 
resource of 2,500,000 tonnes averaging 2.0% copper, 0.3% zinc, 9.4 g/t silver and 0.5 
g/t gold at a copper block cut-off grade of 1.0%. The deposit as currently modelled is 
relatively shallow with approximately 75% of the inferred resource occurring within a 
100 metre depth from surface (Dufresne et al., 2012). Mineral resources are not 
mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral 
reserve. The author has personally verified the resource estimate for the Chu Chua 
deposit; however the resource estimate is not necessarily indicative of mineralization 
within Strachan's Chu Chua Property. 

The Chu Chua deposit is a Cyprus-type volcanogenic massive sulphide body 
hosted and comprises three closely-spaced, north-south striking and sub-vertical 
massive sulphide lenses that outcrop on surface. To date, mineralization has been 
modeled over a 480 m strike length and to a depth of 180 m from surface. Historic 
drilling has intersected mineralization to a depth of 560 m vertically; however relatively 
few drill holes have targeted mineralization below 200 m. The results of historic drilling 
indicate that the deposit thins at depth; however, the massive sulphide lenses remain 
open at depth and along strike (Dufresne et al., 2012). 

14.2 Windpass and Sweethome  

Windpass and Sweethome Properties lie directly to the north of the Chu Chua 
Property and are held 100% by Nevada Clean Magnesium Inc. (Figure 2)  The 
Windpass Mine and Sweethome Showing are located at distances of 1500 and 600 m 
to the north of the Chu Chua Property, respectively (Figure 7).  Historic production from 
Windpass Mine between 1934 and 1939 totalled 93,435 tonnes yielding 1,072 kilograms 
(34,455 ounces) of gold, 53 kilograms (1,719 ounces) of silver and 78,906 kilograms 
(173,958 pounds) of copper (B.C. Minfile 092P 039).

Gold mineralization at Windpass and Sweethome occurs within quartz veins 
cutting gabbro-diorite and chert of the Lower Fennel assemblage (Figure 8).  The 
Windpass workings include 457 m of drift and cross-cut development within the main 
(200 level) adit. Two inclined shafts, the Pioneer and Telluride, were sunk from surface 
to the adit level. An internal shaft (Davis Winze) was sunk to the 900 level and drifting 
carried out east and west on each level. The Sweethome vein was developed by a 36 m 
inclined shaft (30 degrees) that connects with a 106 m crosscut adit, and 137 m of drift 
in the footwall of the vein.  

 In 1972, Dalion Res Ltd performed trenching and 152 m of drilling. Surveying 
and sampling of the Windpass and Sweethome dumps defined 32,655 tonnes of ore 
grading 6.99 g/t Au and 16,146 tonnes at 0.68 g/t Au. The resources are considered 
historic in nature and do not meet the criteria for a NI 43-101 compliant resource of any 
category as defined in "CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves" dated November 27th, 2010, and as such should not be relied upon. In 1987, 
Kerr Addison Mines Ltd carried out geological mapping, magnetometer surveys, 
trenching and diamond drilling of 11 holes totalling 2,010 m. Highlights from 1987 
diamond drilling include 1 m interval of 16.3 g/t Au (Kikauka, 2004).  

Moly Gold Corp. (Moly) completed the most recent exploration during 2003 and 
2004. Rock chip sampling of trenches on the Windpass vein retuned assays of 21.78 g/t 
Au over 0.25 m (Pioneer South Trench) and 1.45 g/t Au over 2.0 m (Telluride Shaft 
Area). Rock chip sampling of a quartz veins and quartz-carboante breccias at the 
Weather Station Zone, 300m north of Windpass, returned assays of 36.94 g/t Au over 
4.0 m (Kikauka, 2004). In 2004, Moly drilled two holes totaling 152 m at the Weather 
Station Zone.  Drilling intersected copper-gold bearing quartz-sulphide and magnetite 
veins that returned assays of 2.25 g/t Au over 0.3 m (Kikauka, 2005). 

14.3 Rea and Somatosum Deposits 

The Rea volcanogenic sulphide deposit is located 20 km to the southeast of the 
Chu Chua Property and was first discovered in 1983 (Figure 7).  Subsequent 
exploration by Corporation Falconbridge Copper (later Minova Inc., now Inmet Mining 
Inc. "Inmet") resulted in the discovery of the Samatosum massive sulphide deposit in 
1986; a distance of 500 m to the northeast.   

The Rea deposit comprises two northwest trending massive sulphide lenses, 
named the RG8 and L100 lenses, which contain fine to medium grained, banded to 
breccia texture pyrite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite 
massive sulphide mineralization.  The RG8 lens occurs over a surface strike length of 
75 m and a down-dip extent of 80 m; the L100 lens has a surface strike length of 50 m 
and down-dip extent of 120 m (Bailey, eta al., 2000).  The Samatosum deposit 
comprises a tabular 5 m thick, shallowly northeast dipping orebody having a 
northwesterly strike length of 500 m and down-dip extend of 100 to 150 m (B.C. Minfile 
082M 244). 

The Rea and Somatosum deposits occur within Devonian to Mississippian 
rocks of the Eagle Bay Assemblage near the stratigraphic top of a unit of mafic 
metavolcanics, flows and volcaniclastics; overlain by phyllite and quartz-sericite schist 
metasediments (unit EBF of Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).  The deposits are hosted 
within two zones of sericite-quartz-carbonate-pyrite altered metasediments termed the

Rea and Samatosum Horizons.  Structurally, the deposits appear to lie on the west 
limb of an overturned, southwest-verging anticline.  Recent mapping by Bailey et al. 
(2000) suggests both deposits occur within the same stratigraphic sequence that has 
been repeated by faulting. 

The Samatosum deposit was mined by Inmet between 1989 and 1992 and 
produced 14 million ounces silver, 21 thousand ounces gold, 8 million pounds copper, 
11 million pounds lead and 21 million pounds zinc from 612,000 tons (555,000 tonnes) 
of ore milled (B.C. Minfile 082M 244).  Before commencement of production, Pirie 
(1989) reported a Samatosum mineral resource of 634,984 tonnes grading 1,035 g/t Ag, 
1.9 g/t Au, 1.2% Cu, 1.7% Pb and 3.6% Zn.  The Rea deposit was never put into 
production, however historic mineral reserves of 376,000 tonnes grading 69 g/t Ag, 6.1 
g/t Au, 0.3% Cu, 2.2% Pb and 2.3% Zn have been reported (Northern Miner, 1987; 
Table 4).  The mineral resources and reserves are considered historic in nature and do 
not meet the criteria for a NI 43-101 compliant resource of any category as defined in 
"CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves" dated November 
27th, 2010, and as such should not be relied upon. The author has been unable to 
verify these sources of information, and the information is not necessarily indicative of 
mineralization on the Chu Chua Property.

14.4 Harper Creek Deposit 

Yellowhead Mining Inc's (Yellowhead) Harper Creek polymetallic volcanogenic 
sulphide deposit is located 20 km to the northeast of the Chu Chua Property (Figure 7).  
Noranda Exploration Company originally discovered the deposit in 1966, and 
subsequent exploration through 1974 defined a historic, non NI 43-101 compliant 
resource of 77.6 million tonnes (Mt) grading 0.39% Cu (Rennie and Scott, 2010, Table 
5).  The mineral resources are considered historic in nature and do not meet the criteria 
for a NI 43-101 compliant resource of any category as defined in "CIM Definition 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves" dated November 27th, 2010, and 
as such should not be relied upon. The author has been unable to verify these sources 
of information and, the information is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the 
Chu Chua Property. Between 1967 and 1996, Noranda and its joint venture partners 
completed diamond drilling of 176 holes totalling 21,292 m.  

The Harper Creek Deposit occurs within rocks of the Devonian to Mississippian 
Eagle Bay Assemblage (unit EBA of Schiarizza and Preto, 1987).  The deposit is 
hosted within a moderately north dipping, thrust-imbricated, sequence of volcanic 
derived felsic to intermediate sericite-chlorite-quartz-feldspar phyllite, and silicified 
sandstone-siltstone rocks.  Mineralization comprises foliation and stratigraphy

conformable lenses of disseminated, fracture-filling and banded pyrite-pyrrhotite and 
chalcopyrite mineralization and accessory magnetite.   

Yellowhead acquired the Harper Creek Property in 2005 and completed re-
logging and sampling of historic drill core, and a 7 hole program of confirmatory 
diamond drilling totalling 2,324 m.  In November 2007 Yellowhead released the first NI 
43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Harper Creek deposit.  The estimate 
comprised an indicated resource of 451 million tonnes grading 0.32% Cu, and an 
inferred resource of 142 Mt grading 0.33% Cu at a copper block cut off grade of 0.2% 
(Rennie and Scott, 2007).  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the 
mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. The author has been unable 
to verify these sources of information, and the information is not necessarily indicative 
of mineralization on the Chu Chua Property. 

Through the end of 2008 Yellowhead completed diamond drilling of 75 holes 
totalling 27,584 m.  During 2009, re-sampling of historic drilling core was completed to 
permit incorporation of precious metal values into the resource model database.  On 
March 8, 2011, Yellowhead released the results of preliminary economic assessment 
(PEA) and an updated resource estimate.  The resource estimate, at a 0.2% Cu cut-off 
comprised measured resources of 90.0 Mt grading 0.30% Cu, 0.033 g/t Au and 1.18 g/t 
Ag; indicated resources of 442.1 Mt grading 0.31% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au and 1.06 g/t Ag for 
a total measured and indicated resource of 532.1 Mt grading 0.31% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au 
and 1.08 g/t Ag (Narcisco et al, 2011).  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and 
do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any 
part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. The author has 
been unable to verify these sources of information, and the information is not 
necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Chu Chua Property. 

During 2010 and 2011 Yellowhead completed an additional 44 diamond drill 
holes totalling 14,330 m (119 diamond drill holes totalling 41,914 m were completed by 
Yellowhead between 2006 and 2011).  On February 16, 2012 Yellowhead released and 
updated resources estimate; and announced completion of a feasibility study (FS) on 
March 2, 2012.  The current resource estimate (effective December 20, 2011) for the 
Harper Creek deposit, at a 0.2% Cu cut-off, comprises measured resources of 348.5 Mt 
grading 0.31% Cu, 0.034 g/t Au, 1.3g/t Ag; indicated resources of 466.5 Mt at 0.28% 
Cu, 0.03g/t Au, 1.3g/t Ag for a total measured and indicated resource of 815 Mt grading 
0.29% Cu, 0.032 g/t Au and 1.3 g/t Ag. A further 80.2 Mt grading 0.30% Cu, 0.033g/t 
Au, and 1.4g/t Ag were classified in the inferred resource category.  Mineral resources 
are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is 
no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a 
mineral reserve. The author has been unable to verify these sources of information, 
and the information is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Chu Chua 
Property. The FS included a mineable reserve estimate for the Harper Creek Deposit.  
The mineable reserve estimate; based upon certain economic parameters, geotechnical 
design criteria and metallurgical recovery assumptions; comprises proven reserves of 
401.2 Mt grading 0.27% Cu, 0.031 g/t Au and 1.15 g/t Ag; probable reserves of 303.3 
Mt grading 0.25% Cu, 0.027 g/t Au and 1.13 g/t Ag for total proven and probable 
reserves of 704.4 Mt grading 0.26% Cu, 0.029 g/t Au and 1.14 g/t Ag (Collins et al,

JC Resource Inc. (JC) currently holds the CM Cyprus-type massive sulphide 
prospect, located 4 km west of the Chu Chua Property.  Similar to the Chu Chua 
deposit, copper, zinc and precious metal mineralization at the Upper and Lower 
showings occur within a chert-argillite horizon hosted within mafic volcanic rocks of the 
Upper Fennell assemblage.  Mineralization at the Lower Showing comprises semi-
massive to disseminated pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite where historic trenching 
returnee assays of 5.7% Cu, 2.95 g/t Au and 29.7 g/t Ag over 3.4 m.  Trenching of 
chert-hosted massive magnetite and pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization at the Upper 
Showing returned assays of 0.4% Cu and 2.0 g/t Au over and 2 grams per tonne gold 
over 3 m (Casselman, 1995).  Mapping by Inco Limited defined a bedding conformable 
zone of intense quartz-calcite-chlorite veining over a 1.7 km strike length and a width of 
approximately 150 m within basalt rocks lying in the footwall of the chert-argillite horizon 
hosting the Upper and Lower showings (Casselman and Cameron, 1994).   

At the Gold Zone, 600 m to the south of the Upper and Lower showings, vuggy 
quartz-carbonate fracture-fill veins occur within locally ankerite altered mafic volcanic 
rocks.  Diamond dril hole 87-2 tested the Gold Zone and intersected siliceous sediment 
hosted semi-massive pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization that returned assays of 
4.8% copper, 0.2% zinc, 14.1 g/t silver and 0.12 g/t gold over 2.9 metres (Casselman 
and Cameron, 1994).

15 Other Relevant Data and Information

Chu Chua property. 

16 Interpretation and Conclusions 

Strachan's Chu Chua Property surrounds the Chu Chua deposit, a Cyprus-type 
volcanogenic massive sulphide body hosted within a 70 m thick chert sequence within 
a package of pillow basalts, first discovered in 1978. The Chu Chua property is largely 
underlain by the Mississippian to Permian aged Fennell Formation comprising basaltic 
and rhyolitic volcanic rocks, clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks and diabase 
sills. The main Chu Chua deposit, which is currently owned by Reva, is comprised of 
two vertical to steeply west-dipping lenses of semi-massive to massive pyrite, 
chalcopyrite and magnetite up to 40 m thick. The lenses strike for about 400 metres 
and have a maximum depth of 200m. However, at least one deep hole has 
intersected massive sulphide at a depth of 630 m below surface. 

 
A 2008 AeroTEM III time domain EM-magnetic geophysical survey has 

resulted in the identification of at least two priority magnetic-EM anomalies and three 
magnetic-only anomalies that compare well with the known signature for the adjacent 
Chu Chua deposit and thus warrant follow-up exploration. In addition, a compilation of 
historic surface rock and soil geochemical data and drilling data indicates that there is 
potential for the Chu Chua deposit, currently held by Reva, to strike onto the Strachan 
claims.  Other Cu-Zn and Au anomalies occur well away from the main Chu Chua 
deposit to the southeast and south; specifically the SC Dome, North Dome, Energite, 
Joe and Chip Dixie showing areas. Some of the geochemical anomalies are 
coincident with linear or discreet isolated EM and/or magnetic anomalies that warrant 
further exploration. The possibility exists for the discovery of Chu Chua style VMS 
deposits as well as base-precious metal veins and stockworks in Paleozoic volcanic 
and sedimentary rocks on Strachan's Property. 

 
Exploration conducted by Shenul during 2010 and 2011 included ground 

magnetic and VLF-EM geophysical surveys; collection of 928 soil and 35 rock grab 
geochemical samples on three separate targets (EM1, EM2 and North Dome grids); 
and diamond drilling of three holes totalling 521.5 m with the EM1 grid.   

 
VLF-EM surveys define a moderate strength conductive axis coincident with the 

peak conductivity of the EM1 airborne anomaly.  The result of 2010 diamond drilling of 
previous geologic mapping indicates the EM1 anomaly is underlain by chert, cherty 
argillite, slate and phyllite flanked to the east and west by variably magnetic diabase 
and gabbro rocks of the Lower Fennell assemblage.  Soil geochemical surveys define 
numerous spot copper and gold anomalies, two multi-sample and multi-line copper and 
coincident gold anomalies within the EM1 grid, and significant widely distributed gold 
anomalies throughout the North Dome and east half of the EM2 grid.  Between the 
North Dome and EM2 targets, six rock samples of quartz-feldspar-porphyry and 
gossanous argillite at the New Discovery Showing returned assays ranging between 
0.25 g/t Au and up to 3.67 g/t Au.  The results of geologic mapping, soil and rock 
sampling indicate gold anomalies within the North Dome and EM2 grids values are 
associated with felsic volcanic rocks of the Lower Fennell assemblage.  The 2010 



5

diamond drilling does not adequately test the EM1 conductive anomaly.  Similarly, drill 
hole CCS10-01 was not ideally positioned to test the northwest trending copper and 
gold soil anomaly identified by the 2010 sampling.   

 

Based on the results of the QA/QC measures and on replicate sampling, the 
author has no reason to doubt the reliability or confidence in the exploration information.  
The EM1 anomaly remains a high-priority target and its conductive response is 
comparable to that of the Chu Chua Deposit; although this does not necessarily indicate 
the anomaly hosts mineralization similar to the Chu Chua Deposit.  The source of the 
EM1, EM2 and North Dome anomalies may also be explained by the presence 
conductive graphitic argillite rocks, which have been intersected in some of the historic 
drill holes.  However, given the presence of copper and gold in soil anomalies within the 
EM1 grid and gold in soil, rock and historic diamond drill hole intercepts associated with 
felsic volcanic rocks within the EM2 and North Dome grids, this is not expected to affect 
the continued viability of the project.  

17 Recommendations 

Further exploration in the area of the Chu Chua Deposit should be 
staged.  Expansion of helicopter-borne EM and magnetic geophysical survey 
coverage is warranted within the southern and eastern claims.  The estimated cost to 
complete 500 line-km of airborne EM and magnetic surveys at 100 m line spacing is 
approximately $80,000 not including GST.  In addition, an exploration database 
comprising 2,408 soil geochemical samples and 161 diamond drill holes exists for the 
Chu Chu Property and adjacent Chu Chua deposit.  This report summarizes all 
significant exploration that has occurred within and adjacent to the Chu Chua Property 
however, a large amount of additional soil and rock geophysical and HLEM ground 
geophysical survey data exists that has not been digitally captured.  Digitization of 
these data will facilitate prioritization of historic base-precious metal soil, rock and 
diamond drill anomalies, EM conductors and mineral occurrences,   The estimated 
cost to complete additional compilation of historic exploration data is $10,000 not 
including GST (Phase 1a).  

 
Based on the results of 2010 and 2011 exploration by Shenul, and as a follow-

up to the proposed airborne EM and magnetic geophysical survey and compilation, 
additional ground geophysical surveys, geologic mapping, soil and rock geochemical 
surveys are warranted to test priority magnetic-EM and magnetic-only anomalies and 
historic Cu-Zn and Au anomalies within the Chu Chua Property (Phase 1b).  The 
total estimated cost to complete Phase 1b evaluation of priority anomalies is $110,000 
not including GST.  The total cost of the Stage 1 program is estimated at $200,000 not 
including GST (Table 6). 

 
Contingent on the results of Phase 1 exploration, Phase 2 drilling of priority 

targets throughout the Property and to test the lateral extent of the Chu Chua deposit 
within Strachan's claims is warranted (Table 6). Any new drilling should include 
downhole electromagnetic surveys measuring conductivity, which can assist in 
resolving the extent of the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses and in targeting new 
separate zones. Additionally, systematic downhole multi trace element and whole rock 



5

Technical Report on the Chu Chua Property 

 

51 

 

geochemical work should be conducted on any new core in order to identify and better 
map the volcanic stratigraphy associated with the Chu Chua massive sulphide lenses.  
The actual details and associated budget for the Phase 2 drilling program will 
depend upon the results of the Phase 1 program.  At present, it is anticipated that at 
least 2,000 m in a minimum of 10 drillholes will be required to test the extent of the 
Chu Chua deposit and follow-up of the geophysical anomalies at the south end of the 
Property. The estimated cost to complete Phase 2 drilling is $600,000 not including 
GST.
