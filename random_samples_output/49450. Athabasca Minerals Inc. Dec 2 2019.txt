1 Summary 

Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s (Athabasca Minerals) Richardson Property (or the 
Property) is located adjacent to the prolific Athabasca oil sands region of northeastern 
Alberta, approximately 130 km north-northeast of the urban service area (or city) of 
Fort McMurray. The Richardson Property comprises 3 contiguous Alberta Metallic and 
Industrial Minerals Leases totalling 3,904 hectares (9,647 acres). Athabasca Minerals 
Inc. maintains 100% interest in all 3 Leases and has the exclusive right to develop and 
mine Alberta-owned metallic and industrial minerals in a specified location.  

 
A maiden inferred resource Technical Report was originally prepared by APEX 

Geoscience Ltd. (APEX) for Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property with an effective 
date of June 8, 2015 (Eccles et al., 2015). Since then, Athabasca Minerals has not 
conducted any exploration activities and/or other work that is material to the issuer; 
however, Athabasca Minerals has been in consultations with the Government of 
Alberta with respect to the implementation of a new Provincial Park (the Kitaskino 
Nuwenëné Wildland Provincial Park) in the vicinity of the original Richardson Property 
permits.  

 
Accordingly, the purpose of this updated Technical Report is to: 1) state Athabasca 

Minerals revised Richardson Property land position; 2) state Athabasca Minerals 
conversion of mineral exploration 'permits' to mineral development 'leases'; and 3) 
show that the original inferred resource estimate prepared in June 2015 is still current 
because the resource area outline is situated entirely within the boundaries of the new 
Property boundary (i.e., the resource area is within the 3 contiguous leases). Hence, 
the change in land position and conversion of permits to leases represent the only 
material change to the issuer as documented in this updated and current Technical 
Report, which supersedes and replaces Eccles et al. (2015).  
 

The Richardson Property is being assessed by Athabasca Minerals for its crush 
rock aggregate potential, which generally refers to materials that are hard and granular, 
and are suitable to be used alone or with other materials as binding agents for a 
number of applications such as: concrete in building construction; road stone; railway 
track blast; mortar; flux in iron and steelmaking; or to reduce coal sulphur dioxide 
emissions. Crush rock aggregate is produced from a variety of materials that are 
usually produced as low-cost, high-volume and bulk mineable commodities. 

 
The Richardson Property is situated along the passive, eastward thinning margin of 

the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin where sedimentary successions 
unconformably overly and onlap the southwest dipping Precambrian basement. Within 
the Property, Precambrian basement, Devonian carbonate and Quaternary surficial 
materials are either exposed, or occur near the surface. From the industrial mineral 
perspective, carbonate rocks are commonly considered to be mechanically strong due 
to their interlocking grain fabrics, carbonaceous mineralogy and subjectivity to 
recrystallization processes, which in turn increase their strength and decrease porosity. 
In addition, igneous Precambrian rocks such as granite typically produce strong 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           2 
 
 

aggregates that are skid resistant and therefore, are favourable road aggregate 
materials.  

 
There are no all-weather roads to the Property; however, a 280 km winter road 

extending from Fort McMurray to the hamlet of Fort Chipewyan traverses through the 
central portion of the Richardson Property and provides intermittent access with 
transport-load capacity.  

 
During 2013, Athabasca Minerals conducted a four-hole diamond drillhole program 

(drillholes GNA-05, GNA-10, GNA-11 and GNA-16; totalling 235 m) intended to test the 
Devonian carbonate and Precambrian basement at the Richardson Property. The drill 
program cored complete stratigraphic sections of the uppermost carbonate 
lithostratigraphic unit (the Winnipegosis Formation) in two of the four drillholes, and a 
single drillhole intersected down through the carbonate stratigraphy and into the 
Precambrian basement. To acquire additional material for evaluation, APEX 
Geoscience Ltd. was retained by Athabasca Minerals Inc. in 2014 to conduct an eight 
drillhole program (14RLD001 to 14RLD008; totalling 843 m) at the Richardson Property 
over an area spanning approximately 20 square kilometres. With the exception of one 
of the eight 2014 drillholes, the program successfully cored entire stratigraphic sections 
that terminated in Precambrian basement granite.  

 
The 2013 and 2014 drill campaigns conducted by Athabasca Minerals Inc. shows 

that the bedrock underlying the Richardson Property includes, from stratigraphic base 
to top: Precambrian crystalline basement granitic rocks of the Taltson Magmatic Zone; 
an Early Devonian (or earlier?) discontinuous zone of detrital basal feldspathic 
sandstone and conglomerate known as the La Loche Formation; marginal marine 
dolomitic silty shale of the Devonian Contact Rapids Formation; and a thick (relative to 
the Contact Rapids and La Loche formations), finely crystalline dolostone known as the 
Winnipegosis Formation. The bedrock is overlain by a layer of Quaternary glaciofluvial 
and glaciolacustrine deposits that have formed kettle depressions and kame deposits 
and redistributed surficial sediments into low-lying areas.  

 
Based on the 2013 and 2014 drill results, Athabasca Minerals Inc. further 

commissioned APEX Geoscience Ltd. to: 1) supervise the logging and sampling of the 
2013 and 2014 drill core; 2) supervise the appropriate aggregate test work and 
geochemical analysis to assess the Winnipegosis Formation and the Precambrian 
basement granite for their suitability as potential source of crush rock aggregate; 3) 
prepare a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report and maiden 
inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate of the Middle Devonian Winnipegosis 
Formation; and 4) make recommendations on future exploration to advance the 
Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property. The Winnipegosis Formation is the focus of 
this Technical Report due to the near surface proximity of the dolostone unit in the drill 
area, which represents a small north-central portion of the Property. A secondary 
objective includes an aggregate assessment of the basement granite, mainly intended 
toward future exploration strategies at Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s Richardson Property.

The drilling strategy was to terminate each drillhole once ten metres of 
Precambrian basement granite was penetrated and cored. A single drillhole 
(14RLD007) tested the granite to a coring depth of 44.5 m to test its uniformity and 
crush rock aggregate potential at depth (and precious-, base- and specialty- metal 
potential). The granite comprised light-blue grey coarse-grained weakly foliated granite 
that is fairly consistent throughout the area of drilling, albeit being variably subjected to 
potassic alteration. The thickness of the Winnipegosis Formation varies from 8.3 m to 
47.9 m (averages 39.5 m) and is comprised largely of competent, light brown 
dolostone. Overburden thickness ranged from 18.0 m to 64.9 m (averages 35.7 m) and 
is comprised largely of unconsolidated glaciofluvial sand and boulders.  

 
The core was logged and sampled in accordance with the appropriate assessment 

of crush rock aggregate, which involves criteria that considers the materials strength, 
continuity, fractures and the presence of weakening particulate matter. Geotechnical 
measurements included: rock quality description, fracture frequency and rock defects, 
and discontinuity and fracture conditions. Density measurements were carried out once 
per every metre using the "hydrostatic" method, which involves weighing the item in air 
and then again while fully submerged in water, to calculate the weight (tonnage) of a 
volume of rock. Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer measurements were 
taken every metre of core to provide an evaluation of the chemical homogeneity and 
potential aggregate strength of the core, and secondarily, to evaluate the metallic 
mineral potential of the core.   

 
The analytical sampling process consisted of two separate sample sets: 1) 

composite samples for aggregate test work; and 2) interval or channel samples for 
major- and trace-element geochemical analysis. The objective of the aggregate 
analytical test work – in the context of this crush rock aggregate resource estimate – 
was predominantly focused on the aggregate mechanical qualities for its use in 
aggregate road building and concrete. A sufficient and appropriate number of samples 
were analyzed to ensure that meaningful sample results were obtained, including: 11 
composite samples of Winnipegosis Formation (one sample per drillhole plus one 
duplicate sample for quality assurance); one composite sample of Contact Rapids 
(amalgamated from all ten drillholes due to the narrowness of the unit); and two 
composite samples of basement granite (amalgamated from all drillholes that 
penetrated basement; n=8). 

 
The results of the aggregate test work were evaluated by making comparisons with 

aggregate specification and screening criteria as set by Alberta Transportation and the 
Canadian Standards Association. The results show that the Winnipegosis Formation 
and Precambrian basement granite met the maximum allowable screening criteria for 
major aggregate test methods, including: plasticity index; Los Angeles abrasion; 
magnesium sulphate soundness; and unconfined freeze-thaw. Based on the results of 
this test work and evidence of the homogeneity and uniformity of the rock units, it is 
concluded that the Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian basement granite 
represent material of merit for several Alberta Transportation aggregate designations, 
including: Designation 1 (asphalt concrete pavement); and Designation 2 (base course 
aggregate).

With respect to reporting a resource estimate and abiding by the General 

Guidelines of NI 43-101, the aggregate test work yields results that suggest the 
Winnipegosis Formation from Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s Richardson Property has 
reasonable prospects of economic viability for an industrial mineral deposit. Despite 
having analyzed only two amalgamated composite granite samples, the Precambrian 
basement granite also yielded positive aggregate test work results and is 
recommended, therefore, to undergo additional aggregate testing in the future. In 
contrast, the single Contact Rapids sample does not meet the screening criteria, and 
therefore, does not meet the reasonable expectation and/or demonstration of economic 
viability of an industrial mineral deposit.  

 
The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate is 

reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators National 
Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using the CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 23rd, 
2003 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" 
adopted May 10, 2014. The senior author performed a site inspection at the 
Richardson Property on October 25, 2017; the date of the site inspection is considered 
sufficient for this Technical Report as there has been no material change at the 
Property since the 2014 drill program.  

 
The CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, Definitions and 

Guidelines, dated August 20, 2000 (the "CIM Standards", NI 43-101 and Companion 
Policy 43-101CP) states that: "when reporting Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates relating to an industrial mineral site, the Qualified Person(s) must make the 
reader aware of certain special properties of these commodities". It should be noted 
that the Richardson crush rock aggregate, in the context of this Technical Report, 
represents an 'early stage project'. The ultimate suitability of an industrial mineral for 
use in specific applications requires detailed marketing and economic investigations, 
which are beyond the scope of this Technical Report. With respect to the Richardson 
Property and northeastern Alberta in general, however, a fundamental statement is that 
the Fort McMurray region is best known for its vast resource of bituminous oil sand, 
and that vast quantities of aggregate materials are required to supplement ongoing oil 
sands infrastructure and construction demand. In addition, it is pertinent to note that 
Government baseline aggregate mapping in the Fort McMurray area has shown that 
sand and gravel deposits are distributed unevenly, of variable quality and quantity, and 
have largely been exploited. Consequently, aggregate exploration has focused on 
importing aggregate, which is difficult from an industrial mineral economics 
perspective, or on locating local sources of buried crush rock aggregate. For example, 
Hammerstone Corporation produces limestone crush rock aggregate from its Muskeg 
Valley Quarry, which is adjacent to the Richardson Property. Lastly, the oil sands 
industry poses no potential conflict or risk to industrial minerals production as separate 
statues regulate the right to metallic and industrial minerals, to coal, to oil/gas, and to 
bitumen (oil sands) in the province of Alberta.

The resource estimation presented in this Technical Report considered data from 
four 2013 drillholes and eight 2014 drillholes drilled by Athabasca Minerals (twelve total 
drillholes). Because two of the 2013 drillholes were terminated at <30 m and did not 
penetrate through the entire lithostratigraphic section of the Winnipegosis Formation 
(the primary focus of this resource estimate), only ten drillholes were utilized in the 
Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource modelling and estimation. 
The 2013 and 2014 drillholes were initially surveyed using a hand-held Garmin GPS 
unit with the collar elevations subsequently being modified using high resolution Light 
Detection and Ranging (LiDar) technology with 1 m resolution. All drillholes were 
vertical holes; no down hole surveying was employed. Spacing between drillholes 
varies from 500 m to 1.37 km, with an average of about 900 m between drillholes. 
Consequently, modelling in MICROMINE utilized seven drill lines that ranged in 
spacing from 570 m to 900 m. In the context of this crushed rock aggregate deposit 
type, style and formation, the drill spacing is sufficient for resource volume estimation. 

 
Stratigraphic logging, which was performed by APEX for both the 2013 and 2014 

drillholes, showed that with the exception of the La Loche Formation–Precambrian 
basement boundary, which can be gradational, the boundaries between formations 
have sharp, visually identifiable contacts. These definitive geological boundaries are 
further characterized as having extensive lateral continuity of the individual formations. 
The homogeneity of the stratigraphic units was further evaluated using geotechnical 
(Rock Quality Description and total fracture data) and geochemical data derived from 
the cores. A positive correlation between the drill logs and the geotechnical/ 
geochemical data confirmed the lithostratigraphic formation divisions, and the 
homogenous nature of the Winnipegosis Formation, which highlights its applicability in 
resource estimation as a potential source of crush rock aggregate.  
 

The single 'impurity' to report involves supplementary bitumen, which is more or 
less confined to the uppermost portions of the Winnipegosis Formation (and the La 
Loche Formation directly overlying the Winnipegosis dolostone). The bitumen ranges in 
intensity from non-existent (in most of the core) to pervasive, the latter of which is 
evident in 25 cm to 90 cm wide 'bituminous horizons' that occur in the eastern drillholes 
14RLD006 and 14RLD008. The bitumen appears to be confined to porosity enabling 
textures in the carbonate such as vugs, sandy horizons and fracture planes. It is not 
known how the bitumen might influence the processing or marketing of the potential 
crush rock aggregate, but the overall consistency and volume of non-bitumen-bearing 
dolostone, and the positive aggregate test work results, provide justification that the 
bitumen does not influence the viability of the Winnipegosis as an industrial mineral 
deposit in the evaluation of this early stage project.  

 
A total of 675 bulk density measurements were collected from drill core within the 

Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource area. Additional density 
measurements (n=14) were also performed as part of aggregate test work, and these 
results were consistent with hydrostatic average formation density values of 2.68, 2.50 
and 2.63 for the Winnipegosis, Contact Rapids and basement granite, respectively, 
that were used in this Technical Report.

Mineral resource modelling was carried out using a three-dimensional model in 
commercial geological modelling and mine planning software MICROMINE (v.14.0.4). 
Block modelling of the resource area was not necessary as no 'grade' was being 
estimated; instead a three-dimensional computer-generated 'solid' of the area was 
generated in MICROMINE to calculate the resource 'volume'. A separate wireframe 
was created for each formation (Precambrian basement granite; La Loche Formation; 
Contact Rapids Formation; Winnipegosis Formation; and overburden), from which, 
separate ensuing formation volumes could be derived for each lithostratigraphic unit.  

 
The surface area of the resource outline reported in this Technical Report is 6.30 

km2. With the exception of two northwestern drillholes (GNA-10 and 14RDL-008), a 
resource outline of 500 m was constructed around the outermost drillholes to clip the 
individual formation wireframes and restrict the lateral extension of the wireframes and 
the main resource model to the general 2013 and 2014 Athabasca Minerals drill area 
which represents only a small north-central portion of the Richardson Property. The 
resource outline of 500 m was deemed appropriate based on the continuous nature of 
the stratigraphic formations within the resource outline area as defined by 2013 and 
2014 Athabasca Minerals drilling, and because the same generally flat-lying 
stratigraphic formations has been intersected in oil and gas wells that are located 
several 10's to 100's of kilometres away from the Richardson resource area. The 
radius of the boundary outlines for drillholes GNA-10 and 14RDL-008 was reduced to 
50 m (from 500 m) due to the proximity of a lake.  

 
This three-dimensional model formed the spatial basis for calculating the volume 

and tonnage for the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource 
estimate. Within the three-dimensional model, the volume of each formation was used 
to multiply against a nominal density value, which was determined on a formation by 
formation basis. This resulted in the reported tonnages. The Richardson maiden 
inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has been classified as 'inferred' 
according to the CIM definition standards.  

 
The classification of the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate 

resource was based on geological confidence, data quality and stratigraphic continuity. 
That is, the criteria and rational for the classification of inferred resource is based upon 
the wide spaced nature of the drilling to date and the fact that the Richardson crush 
rock aggregate project is classified as an early stage project with little mineral 
processing test work completed to date. As this is the maiden inferred resource, no 
mining studies have been employed to constrain the resource within an optimal pit 
shell.  
 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate consists 
of 683 million tonnes of aggregate material situated within the favourable Winnipegosis 
Formation (Table 1). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the 
mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. The Winnipegosis aggregate 
resource is directly overlain by 497 million tonnes of overburden-waste material.

Note 1:  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. 

Note 2:  The quantity of tonnes reported in these inferred resource estimations are 
uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these 
inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or 
measured resource category. 

 
The estimate of mineral resources presented in this Technical Report may be 

materially affected by geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
political, marketing or other relevant issues. Because the Richardson Property is in its 
preliminary exploration stages, specific detail on project's risks and uncertainties has 
yet to be fully investigated at this time.  As the Richardson Property advances toward 
an early stage conceptual assessment of potential economic viability of the mineral 
resources, future discussion on the significant risks, uncertainties and foreseeable 
impacts are required, including those risks to the project's potential economic viability.  

 
The portion of the Richardson property resource that has been classified as 

'Inferred' demonstrates that the nature, quantity and distribution of data is such as to 
allow confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume 
continuity of geological formations. The collective work to date from the Richardson 
Property indicate that while the project is in early stages of exploration/resource work 
that indications of the metallurgical and mineral processing qualities give suggestions 
that they are of high enough quality that the Winnipegosis at the Richardson Property 
is considered to be a 'property of merit' and warrants further exploration. This 
contention is supported by results presented in this Technical Report, which include:  
 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           8 
 
 

• the Winnipegosis Formation is a uniform and continuous target unit that has 
undergone pervasive dolomitization and is therefore a hard, competent and 
resistive lithostratigraphic unit with crush rock aggregate deposit potential;  

 

• sample composites of the Winnipegosis Formation yielded positive 
aggregate test work results in comparison to Alberta Transportation and 
Canadian Standards Association aggregate specifications and standards;  
 

• the Winnipegosis Formation is considered the most favourable unit for crush 
rock aggregate in the resource area given that it is the shallowest 
lithostratigraphic unit (directly underlying the quaternary cover and occurs at 
depths ranging from 18.0 m to 64.9 m) with early stage project crush rock 
aggregate deposit potential;   

 

• a Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate that 
has an aerial extent of 6.30 km2 and consists of 683 million tonnes of crush 
rock aggregate material situated within the Winnipegosis Formation (see 
aforementioned disclaimers); and   

 

• the oil sands region of northeastern Alberta represents an area of enormous 
growth – while continued oil sands development is subject to an infinite 
number of variables (e.g., geology, hydrocarbon prices, environment, 
taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues), the current 
circumstances suggest a continued and positive market demand for 'local' 
aggregate products. 

 
In addition to the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource 

estimate, a stratigraphic compilation of publicly available oil and gas well information, 
historical metallic and industrial mineral assessment reports, and data from Athabasca 
Minerals Inc. 2013 and 2014 drill programs shows that there is good stratigraphic 
continuity of the Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian basement surface in the 
general Richardson Property area. By way of preliminary reasoning, the Richardson 
Property has several potential targets for further exploration. The following statements 
referring to any potential extension of the Richardson crush aggregate deposit are 
conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient exploration to define the extended 
mineral deposit and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral deposit and/or resource. Potential targets for further 
exploration are summarized as follows:   

1. Based on good stratigraphic continuity of the Winnipegosis Formation, an 
extension of the current Winnipegosis crush rock aggregate deposit outwards 
from the resource area to other parts of the Property could create additional 
and/or more accessible Winnipegosis tonnage. For example, a potential 
southerly extension of the Winnipegosis Formation deposit (i.e., an additional 
aerial extent of 7.49 km2) could add between 0.671 and 1.006 billion tonnes of 
aggregate crush rock. There is also justification in targeting the Winnipegosis 
Formation to the east-northeast, where the thickness of overburden is assumed 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           9 
 
 

to be thinner and could potentially lower the strip ratio to access the 
Winnipegosis in comparison to the resource area.   
 

2. If the economics of mining the Winnipegosis Formation are feasible, then the 
Precambrian basement granite represents a potential secondary crush rock 
aggregate target within the resource area due to its uniform nature and overall 
hardness as shown by aggregate test work conducted in this Technical Report. 
Modelling in this Technical Report shows that within the resource area, the 
Precambrian basement granite could account for an additional 165 million 
tonnes of potential aggregate. This estimate is conservative as the volume 
assumes a maximum depth of 10 m (corresponding to when most of the 
drillholes were terminated). Based on drillhole 14RLD007, which confirmed 
uniform granite to a depth of 48.35 m, the granite could easily be extended, 
such that the granite could account for 319 million tonnes if, for example, the 
modelling depth was extended to 20 m instead of 10 m.  
 

3. In scenario 2 above, any potential granite evaluation in the resource area is 
contingent on the Winnipegosis being economic. However, the Precambrian 
basement granite is known crop out on the Richardson Property directly east-
southeast of the resource area. In addition, a multi-technique geophysical 
conducted over the general granite outcrop area helps to define the near-
surface boundaries of the granite body. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) 
profiles and ground magnetic data show that the granite outcrop is fairly 
constrained to the immediate observed exposure; however, the GPR profiles 
suggest that the area directly north of the outcrop has the least amount of 
overburden and/or Winnipegosis dolostone material to overlie the Precambrian 
basement granite. Based on the GPR results, the estimated areas of combined 
surficial overburden and Winnipegosis Formation dolostone material that is 
situated on top of the Precambrian granite and is within 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m 
and 25 m of surface is approximately: 4,600 m2; 15,200 m2; 45,100 m2; 91,300 
m2; and 147,233 m2, respectively. The geophysical interpretations remain 
inherently ambiguous and require other geological information such as drilling 
to properly confirm and classify the identified litho-magnetic zones. However, 
based on the uniformity and positive granite aggregate test results from the 
resource area, and delineation of an exposed and near-surface area of granite 
on the eastern part of the Property, Precambrian granite at the Richardson 
Property represents a potential target for further exploration.   
 

4. Lastly, the Contact Rapids Formation, which underlies the Winnipegosis, 
comprises weakly consolidated muddy and sandy limestone, and is therefore 
not as desirable in comparison to the Winnipegosis (this is evident in poor 
aggregate test work results presented in this Technical Report). There is the 
possibility, however, that the Contract Rapids could provide a source of 
alternative flux material if the Winnipegosis were to be mined as crush rock 
aggregate.

To conclude, there are several hypotheses to potentially increase and diversify the 
current Richardson crush-rock aggregate deposit. Accordingly, a two-Phase approach 
is recommended for 2019-2020 exploration at the Richardson Property consisting of: 
Phase One geophysical work, including a Ground Penetrating Radar survey; and a 
Phase Two extension and infill drill program. Results pending, the Phase Two drill 
program could be contemporaneous with a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) 
scoping study. The total cost of both phases of recommended exploration work is 
estimated at CDN$916,000 (Table 2; not including contingency). With a 10% 
contingency the total budget is CDN$1,007,600.  

The Phase One exploration work includes a 35 line-kilometre Ground Penetrating 
Radar survey to:  

• create a preliminary three-dimensional geological model of the resource area 
and beyond;  
 

• depict those areas that have shallow overburden overlying Devonian 
Winnipegosis dolomite and the Precambrian basement granite; and  
 

• define the drillhole locations for the Phase Two drill program.  

Subject to the results of the Phase One survey, a Phase Two extension/infill 
drillhole program and aggregate test work analyses will:  

• verify the three-dimensional geological model; and  
 

• provide additional confidence to uniformity, extent, depth and quality of the 
Winnipegosis dolomite and the basement granite, which is necessary to produce 
an updated mineral resource estimate.  

It is recommended that the Phase Two extension and infill drilling consists of ten to 
eleven systematically placed diamond drillholes (totalling approximately 1,000 m) 
designed to:  

• extend the Winnipegosis deposit area to the south and to the east-northeast of 
the resource area; and  
 

• verify and define a potential Precambrian granite aggregate deposit to the area 
east-southeast of the resource area (adjacent to a known exposure of 
Precambrian granite).  

The drillhole and analytical results will generate: a revised inferred, and possibly 
indicated, mineral resource Technical Report; and trigger a PEA scoping study that 
includes an economic analysis of the potential viability of crush rock aggregate 
resources at the Richardson Property. The PEA scoping study should include: the 
creation of an initial pit shell; estimations of strip ratios to remove the overburden; 
examination of certain economic and environmental factors related to the market for 
crushed rock aggregate in the immediate vicinity of Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s 
Richardson Property.

2 Introduction 

Athabasca Minerals Inc. (Athabasca Minerals) maintains 100% interest in the 
Richardson Property (the Property), which is located in the Athabasca oil sands region 
of northeastern Alberta, approximately 130 km north of the city of Fort McMurray (Figure 
1). The Property comprises 3 contiguous Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Leases 
totalling 3,904 hectares (9,647 acres; Figure 2; Table 3). Athabasca Minerals has 
exclusive right to develop and mine Alberta-owned metallic and industrial minerals at 
the Property.  

Athabasca Minerals is Canadian mineral exploration company that has identified, 
explored and developed various industrial minerals to support oil sands development in 
the prolific Athabasca oil sands area of northeastern Alberta. For example, Athabasca 
Minerals currently manages the largest open pit gravel pit in Canada, the Susan Lake 
Aggregate Operation, which is located approximately 25 km south-southwest of the 
Richardson Property.   

The Richardson Property, which is the focus of this Technical Report, lies along the 
passive, eastward thinning margin of the WCSB where sedimentary successions 
unconformably overlie and onlap the southwest dipping Precambrian basement. The 
bedrock geology at the Property generally consists of Precambrian basement and 
Middle Devonian carbonate rocks that are either exposed or buried by a veneer of 
Quaternary surficial deposits.  

The Richardson Property is being assessed by Athabasca Minerals for its crush rock 
aggregate potential. From the industrial mineral perspective, carbonate rocks are 
commonly considered to be mechanically strong due to their interlocking grain fabrics, 
carbonaceous mineralogy and subjectivity to recrystallization processes. In addition, 
Precambrian igneous rocks such as granite typically produce strong aggregates that are 
skid resistant and therefore, are favourable road aggregate materials.  

During 2014, APEX Geoscience Ltd. (APEX) was retained by Athabasca Minerals 
to:  

1. complete an eight drillhole program at the Property on behalf of Athabasca 
Minerals intended to increase the amount of material available for the crush rock 
aggregate assessment (the 2014 drill program builds upon a 2013 drill program 
by Athabasca Minerals that drilled four drillholes totalling 235.1 m);   
 

2. review, log, sample and analyze drill cores from the 2013 and 2014 drill 
programs that were completed at the Property by Athabasca Minerals;  
 

3. prepare a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report and maiden 
inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate of the Middle Devonian 
Winnipegosis Formation at Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property; and  
 

4. conduct a multi-technique ground geophysical survey around a granite outcrop 
and make recommendations on potential future exploration target areas.

Out crop exposures of the Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Marguerite River 
Complex are found on the eastern edge of the Property. The Marguerite River Complex 
comprises of undifferentiated granite, Arch Lake-type granitoid, hornblende-quartz 
monzonite and granitoid gneiss rocks (Dufresne et al., 1994; Prior et al., 2013). The 
crystalline basement at the Property is overlain by, from stratigraphic base to top, the: 
La Loche, Contract Rapids and Winnipegosis formations. The Devonian and 
Precambrian rock units are almost entirely overlain by Quaternary surficial deposits, 
which form a thin veneer of ice-contact glaciofluvial and glaciofluvial outwash deposits 
(Bayrock, 1971; Fenton et al., 20012). The Early Devonian La Loche Formation is 
composed of detrital basal feldspathic sandstone and conglomerate and is considered 
equivalent to the Granite Wash (Sherwin, 1962; Norris, 1963; Schneider et al., 2013), 
and the Contact Rapids Formation is comprised of marginal marine dolomitic siltstone-
shale, argillaceous dolostone and shale-siltstone (Sherwin, 1962; Meijer Drees, 1994).  

Most of the bedrock overlying the crystalline basement at the Property comprises the 
Middle Devonian Winnipegosis Formation of the Upper Elk Point Group, which is the 
focus of this Technical Report (a secondary interest is the Precambrian granite). The 
Winnipegosis Formation is the stratigraphic equivalent to the Keg River Formation in 
northwestern Alberta. The Winnipegosis Formation reflects an open-marine platform 
and reef system and is composed of thickly bedded brownish to yellowish-grey 
dolostone containing various brachiopod, bivalve and gastropod fossils (Macoun, 1877; 
Bassett, 1952; Norris, 1963; Schneider et al., 2013).  

The primary objectives of this Technical Report are to: 1) describe the process used 
to assess whether the Devonian Winnipegosis Formation at the Richardson Property 
have reasonable prospects of economic viability for an industrial mineral deposit; and 2) 
prepare a Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate that is 
reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 
43-101. A secondary objective is to report on those potential targets that require further 
exploration and evaluation for crush rock aggregate potential at the Richardson 
Property.  

The authors include R. Eccles and S. Nicholls, all of whom are independent of 
Athabasca Minerals and employed as geological consultants with APEX. Mr. Eccles,

M.Sc. P.Geol., supervised the preparation of, and is responsible for the ultimate 
publication of this Technical Report. Mr. Eccles is a Qualified Person as defined by the 
Canadian Securities Administration National Instrument (NI) 43-101. The Canadian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy defines a Qualified Person as "an individual who is a 
geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration, mine 
development or operation or mineral project assessment, or any combination of these; 
has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical 
report; and is a member or licensee in good standing of a professional association."  

 
Mr. Eccles is a Professional Geologist with the Association of Professional 

Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) and has worked as a geologist for 
more than 25 years since his graduation from University. Mr. Eccles has been involved 
in all aspects of mineral exploration and mineral resource estimations for metallic and 
industrial mineral projects and deposits in Canada. Mr. Eccles was a geologist with the 
Alberta Geological Survey for 21 years (1990-2011). In this capacity, he travelled and 
conducted geological studies in northeastern Alberta's clastic sedimentary rock units, 
including specific studies related to Devonian rock units at the sub-Cretaceous 
unconformity. Mr. Eccles performed a site inspection at the Richardson Property on 
October 25, 2017; the date of the site inspection is considered sufficient for this 
Technical Report as there has been no material change at the Property since the 2014 
drill program.  
 

The resource estimation statistical analysis and three-dimensional modeling was 
completed by Mr. Nicholls, MAIG, a Qualified Person, under the direct supervision of 
Mr. Eccles, P. Geol., who are both Qualified Persons with respect to mineral estimation 
as defined by the Canadian Securities Administration NI 43-101. Mr. Nicholls is a 
resource geologist with over 14 years of exploration and mining experience.  

The maiden crush rock aggregate resource estimate of the Middle Devonian 
Winnipegosis Formation on Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property is classified as an 
"Inferred" Mineral Resource, and was classified in accordance with guidelines 
established by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
"Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" 
dated November 23rd, 2003 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves" adopted May 10, 2014. By definition,  

 
"An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited 
geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to 
imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred 
Mineral Resource is based on limited information and sampling gathered 
through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Inferred Mineral Resources must 
not be included in the economic analysis, production schedules, or

as provided under NI 43-101." 

 
This Report is a compilation of proprietary and publicly available information, as well 

as information obtained during the 2013 and 2014 drill programs. References in this 
Technical Report are made to publicly available reports that were written prior to 
implementation of NI 43-101, including government geological publications and Alberta 
Metallic and Industrial Mineral Permit Assessment Reports that are filed with Alberta 
Energy. These reports are cited in the 'Reference' section.  

 
Government reports include those that depict the geology of northern Alberta (e.g., 

Carrigy, 1959; Bayrock, 1971; Fox, 1980; Meijer Drees, 1980, 1990, 1994; Ross et al.,

3 Reliance on Other Experts 

The authors are not qualified to provide an opinion or comment on issues related to 
environmental, legal, socio-economic, land title or political issues, and are therefore, 
not qualified to comment on issues related to permitting, legal agreements, royalties 
and environmental matters.  

Accordingly, the authors of this Technical Report disclaim portions of this Technical 
Report, particularly in Section 4. More specifically, the authors have not attempted to 
verify the legal status of the Property; however, the Alberta Energy metallic and 
industrial mineral disposition of mineral rights management system shows that the 
Athabasca Mineral Leases are active and in good standing at the effective date of this 
Technical Report: October 24, 2019.  

In addition, the Richardson Property Government of Alberta lease information was 
provided verbally by Mr. Robert Beekhuizen (CEO Athabasca Minerals) on March 20, 
2019 and in Lease documents provided by Mr. Jan Cerny (VP Corporate 
Development, Athabasca Minerals) in October 2019.  

The senior author and QP relied exclusively on the Property information in Sections 
4.1 and 4.4 as provided by Athabasca Minerals. 

4 Property Description and Location 

4.1 Property Description 

Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s Richardson Property is located comprises 3 contiguous 
Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Leases totalling 3,904 hectares (9,647 acres), of 
which Athabasca Minerals holds 100% interest. The Property is located in northeast 
Alberta in the Athabasca oil sands region, approximately 80 km northeast of hamlet of 
Fort Mackay, and 130 km north-northeast of the city of Fort McMurray (Figure 1). The 
Richardson Property lies entirely within the 1:250,000 scale National Topographic 
System ("NTS") Map Sheet 074 E, more specifically the 1:50,000 within Map Sheets 
074E10, 074E11, 074E14 and 074E15. The Property is approximately centered at 57° 
48' 53" North Latitude and 111° 08' 30" West Longitude (491580E, 7277835N UTM). 
The Permits are contained within the Alberta Township Survey ("ATS") system 
Township ("T") 6, Range ("R") 102, west ("W") of the 4th meridian (T06-R102W4), T07-

R102W4, T08-R102W4, T09-R102W4, T06-R101W4, T07-R101W4, T06-R100W4 and 
T07-R100W4. The Richardson Property includes Alberta Metallic and Industrial 
Minerals Permits: 9310060418, 9310060419, 9312060367, 9312060387, 9312060388, 
9312070594, 9312100494and 9312110408 (Figure 2; Table 3). 

4.2 Property Rights and Maintenance 

In Alberta, Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Permits may be held by any 
organization, corporate entity, or individual which is properly registered to conduct a 
business in Alberta. The Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Permits grant 
Athabasca Minerals the exclusive right to conduct metallic and industrial mineral 
exploration for up to 7-consecutive 2-year terms, totalling up to 14 years, subject to 
biannual assessment work and reporting. Permit holders are required to perform work 
compliant to $5.00/ha during the first term, then $10.00/ha for both the second and third 
terms. Over the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh terms, $15.00/ha of work is required. 
Once a mineral deposit has been identified and the 14 years of MIM permits in good 
standing have passed, leases may be granted for a fifteen-year renewal term subject to 
annual payments of $3.50/ha, with no work requirements. 

Athabasca Minerals original (ca. 2014) land position included 8 permits totalling 
60,966 hectares (150,650 acres; Eccles et al., 2015). On January 18, 2019 the land 
position was converted to 3 leases totalling 3,904 hectares (9,647 acres), of which 
Athabasca Minerals holds 100% interest.  

An Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Lease grants the exclusive right to 
develop and mine Alberta-owned metallic and industrial minerals in a specified location. 
The term of a lease is 15 years, and it may be renewed. Annual rent must be paid. 
Royalties must be paid if any mineral production takes place on the lease.  

The Alberta Mines and Minerals Act and Regulations (Metallic and Industrial Mines 
Tenure Regulation 145/2005, Metallic and Industrial Exploration Regulation 213/98) 
states the complete terms and conditions for work and permitting for mineral exploration 
in Alberta. These acts and regulations, among others pertinent to mineral exploration 
and mining in Alberta can be found on the Government of Alberta Queen's Printer 
website (Alberta, 2014).  

4.3 Coexisting Oil, Gas and Oil Sands Rights 

Separate statues regulate the right to metallic and industrial minerals, to coal, to 
oil/gas, and to bitumen (oil sands) in the province of Alberta. These separate regulations 
enable a number of different rights to be held by different grantees and to coexist over 
the same geographic location. Oil/gas leases, coal leases, oil sands leases and permits 
coexist on the, in the vicinity of, and under, Richardson Property.  

4.4 Land Use and Environmental Matters 

In March 2019, the Government of Alberta created the Kitaskino Nuwenëné Wildland 
Provincial Park following discussions with Indigenous Peoples, industry and other 
stakeholders between December 2018 and February 2019. The new Wildland Provincial 
Park covers an area of 161,880 hectares and surrounds the Richardson Property. Note: 

http://www.qp.alberta.ca/Laws_Online.cfm

October 24, 2019           20 
 
 

Based on feedback received during the consultation period, the final boundary of the 
park was adjusted to accommodate industrial activities currently taking place in the 
area.  

Athabasca Minerals Inc. has the right to develop and mine Alberta-owned metallic 
and industrial minerals at the Property subject to procuring the appropriate Exploration 
Approval land use permits from the Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) Land 
Administration Division. The Alberta Metallic and Industrial Minerals Leases identify the 
minor activity restrictions which apply to the granted land.  

The Land Division of the AEP regulates the land use in Alberta, including the 
issuance of surface disturbance permits, in addition to structured local consultations. 
For the 2013 and 2014 drilling programs, a number of consultation meetings were 
conducted between Athabasca Minerals and aboriginal communities in the Fort MacKay 
to Fort McMurray area in order to acquire the Exploration Approval necessary for the 
drilling program.  

At present, the authors and Athabasca Minerals have no knowledge of major 
obstacles to resource development, of any material restrictions, or of pending aboriginal 
claims on the Property or surrounding area. Sensitivities as outlined in Government 
correspondence to Athabasca Minerals include:  

• Exploration and any proposed development activity must comply with all 
applicable provincial legislation and regulations;  
 

• The Government of Alberta's "First Nations Consultation Policy on Land 
Management and Resource Development" may apply to surface activities 
proposed as a result of acquiring Crown mineral rights. 
 

• Environmental concerns will be associated with rivers, creeks, lakes, and any 
sensitive terrain in the mineral permit area. Surface access will normally be 
available for exploration. However, topographic and ground conditions, as well as 
natural resource values, may restrict access in terms of erosion control, slope 
stabilization, access control, buffer zones, timing constraints, equipment 
restrictions, and other operational measures. 
 

• The appropriate consent for surface access, including roads, must be obtained 
from existing landowners or occupants, prior to entry for development. On public 
land, the consent for surface access and development is obtained through a 
disposition under the Public Lands Act. 
 

• Any exploration causing surface disturbance (e.g., motorized ground equipment, 
line cutting, drilling) will require a Metallic Mineral Exploration Approval pursuant 
to the Metallic and Industrial Minerals Exploration Regulation, prior to exploration. 
This requirement applies to public and non-public land. 
 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           21 
 
 

• Environmental reservations may exist on some of the lands for the purpose of 
protecting environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, any Integrated Resource 
Plans (IRPs) in effect for the area will provide guidance on land use zoning, land 
management and potential access restrictions on public land. Areas of potential 
concern include, but are not limited to, fish and wildlife habitat, topography, soil 
and ground conditions, buffer zones, watershed protection, slope stability, 
erosion control, natural areas and recreation sites. Surface access will be 
restricted depending on the location and nature of exploration. Any restrictions 
that are considered appropriate by the public land manager will appear as 
conditions of the Approval. Surface access for development of mineral resources 
may not be available in some areas due to land use zoning in any applicable 
Integrated Resource Plan. 
 

• Alberta Culture and Tourism's regulatory requirements can be satisfactorily 
addressed through Sections 31 and 37(2) of the Historical Resources Act. 
Depending on the location and extent of mineral exploration and the nature of the 
historical resources, there may be restrictions as well as the need for a Historical 
Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA).  

In essence, it is the responsibility of the mineral rights holder to seek clarification 
from the appropriate public land management agency as to any land use or 
environmental concerns that may restrict surface access for exploration and potential 
future development.  

4.5 Royalty Rates 

Royalty reporting requirements in Alberta are documented in the Metallic and 
Industrial Minerals Royalty Regulation (Alberta Regulation 350/1993). If development 
were to occur, Athabasca Minerals is required to fill out a mine royalty form for start-up 
of any new mine operation. Historically, royalty rates for "aggregate" from limestone, 
adheres to the limestone royalty of $0.0441 per tonne. For "aggregate" from gravel, the 
royalty is set by Alberta Environment and Parks, but general guidelines indicate royalty 
fees of $1.20 per cubic yard for gravel or a combination of sand and gravel as per the 
Public Lands Act (RSA 2000).  

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Access and Infrastructure 

There are no all-weather roads to the Property, however, a 280 km winter road 
extending from Fort McMurray to Fort Chipewyan provides intermittent access as it 
traverses through the western portion of the Property (Figure 3). Within the Property, 
the Fort Chipewyan Winter Road leads to the abandoned Richardson airstrip, which is 
located on the northern part of the Property. The winter road is only passable to vehicle 
traffic during the winter months, due to having to cross the Firebag River to the South of 
the Property. Year-round access to the Property can be accomplished by all-terrain 
vehicles (ATV). Fall and spring exploration programs would be possible (October to 
December and March to May) but is not often favourable due to insufficient frozen 
ground access and thin snow cover.

Athabasca Minerals Inc.'s Richardson Property can be accessed by fixed wing and 
helicopter aircrafts from the city of Fort McMurray, which is located approximately 130 
km south-southwest of the Property. Fort McMurray is nearly 500 km north of 
Edmonton, Alberta and accessible by road or by regular daily commercial flights from 
several international airports (e.g., Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton) and other communities.  

Rail shipping services to Fort McMurray are offered by the Canadian National 
Railway Company. Canadian National operates the line that runs from the city of 
Edmonton and passes though the communities of Boyle, Lac La Biche, Conklin, 
Leismer, Chard, Cheecham and Anzac to its terminus at Lynton, which is southeast of 
the Fort McMurray airport (approximately 12.5 km west of Highway 63 on Highway 69). 
The line received a $135 million upgrade in 2008.  

Exploration work in the Fort McMurray region, including the multi-billion-dollar oil 
sands industry, is facilitated by nearby support services and supplies, including medical 
and equipment supplies, rotary air support, expediting and communications. 
Telephones and radio communications are good quality, and cellular phone reception 
has good coverage in many areas, including within the Richardson Property area.  

Accessibility to various areas throughout the region is fairly good, enabled by a 
system of highways, secondary roads and cut seismic lines that service the oil sands 
industry. The access routes are used year-round as winter and rush roads, and 
occasionally by all-terrain vehicles in the summer. The 2014 exploration program was 
undertaken from a trailer camp set up on the abandoned Richardson airstrip.  

5.2 Physiography, Vegetation and Climate 

The physiography of the Fort McMurray area is generally characterized by a flat to 
low relief terrain with land elevation varying between 240 m and 360 m above sea level 
("m asl"). The Property is located within the Athabasca Plain and the Central Mixed 
Wood Natural Sub-regions of the Boreal Forest Natural Region (Downing and 
Pettapiece, 2006). The Central Mixed Wood Natural Sub-region occupies 25% of 
Alberta and is characterized by gently undulating to flat plains, upland forests (white 
spruce, aspen and mixed wood) and wetlands (treed fens). The Athabasca Plain 
Natural Sub-region is characterized by dune fields, sandy plains and gravel-cored hills 
populated by low shrubs and jack pine forests. 

The principal waterways in the region are the Athabasca River and Clearwater River, 
fed by numerous small rivers and streams. Water at the Richardson Property area was 
sourced from nearby lakes and streams, although the ideal source of nearby fresh water 
is the Athabasca River, located approximately 15 km from the Property, because of its 
size and flow continuity. 

The closest weather station producing long-term climate data (years 1971 to 2000) 
is located in Fort McMurray, and is available on the Environment Canada website 
(Government of Canada, 2014). Temperatures in the winter average -18.8 degrees 
Celsius ("°C") and a daily minimum temperature of -24.0° C during the coldest moth of 
January. In general, winters are long, having on average daily minimum temperatures 
below zero between the months of October and April, and below -10° C between

November and March. Summer temperatures are generally warm, averaging 16.8° C 
with an average daily maximum temperature of 23.2° C during the warmest month of 
July. Annual precipitation in Fort McMurray averages 455.5 mm, up to 81.3 mm in July 
and as little as 15.0 mm in February. Oil sands operations, and any aggregate 
operations in support of the oil sands, can operate year-round as can most exploration 
methods.  

6 History 

6.1 Historical Exploration with the Boundaries of the Richardson Property 

Historical exploration work at the Richardson Property is defined by 2013 and 2014 
drill programs completed by Athabasca Minerals. Collectively, these programs drilled a 
total of 12 drillholes totalling 1,078 m. The intent of the drill programs was to test the 
Devonian carbonate and Precambrian basement at the Richardson Property. The drill 
program cored complete stratigraphic sections of the uppermost carbonate 
lithostratigraphic unit (the Winnipegosis Formation) with the majority of the holes 
terminated in Precambrian basement granite. Because these drillholes form the main 
basis for the 3D geological model and mineral resource estimation presented in this 
Technical Report, the drilling description and results are presented in Section 10, 
Drilling.  

6.2 Historical Exploration in the Northeast Alberta and Outside of the Richardson Property 

The authors have been unable to verify the information presented in this historical 
off-Property section, and therefore, the reader should be aware that the information is 
not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Richardson Property.  

The Fort McMurray region is best known for its vast resource of bituminous oil sand. 
Based on the present bitumen recovery technologies, these oil reserves are estimated 
at 168 billion barrels (Alberta Government, 2013). The oil sands industry is a significant 
driver in the search for new sources of aggregate. That is, vast quantities of aggregate 
materials are required to supplement ongoing oil sands infrastructure construction 
demands. The location and status of oil sands operations in the general Richardson 
Property are shown in Figure 4. A total of six energy-related (oil sands) wells are known 
to have previously been drilled by companies other than Athabasca Minerals near the 
Richardson Property (Table 4).

While the energy industry is the main driver of the Alberta economy, several non-
hydrocarbon mineral exploration discoveries have been made in northeastern Alberta 
since the 1990's. A summary of the various mineral commodity and deposit types in 
northeastern Alberta are summarized in the following text and in Figure 5 with 
consideration for their location with respect to Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property. 
With the exception of crush rock aggregate, which is the focus of this Technical Report, 
none of these resources and/or occurrences is known to occur at the Richardson 
Property, nor do the authors infer that the commodity types might exist on the Property. 
Rather this information is provided as general background knowledge for northeastern 
Alberta.  

6.2.1 Crush Rock Aggregate, and Sand and Gravel Aggregate 

South of the Richardson Property, Hammerstone Corporation operates the Muskeg 
Valley Limestone Quarry (also known as the Hammerstone Project), which provides 
aggregate and limestone products for construction aggregate and for flue-gas 
desulphurization for the oil sands extraction process (Figure 5). The quarry has four 
limestone units, each of which produces products with distinct chemical and physical 
properties.  

In addition to the Richardson Crush Rock Property, Athabasca Minerals has been 
awarded Provincial contracts to manage the Susan Lake Public Aggregate Pit, which is 
now closed, and the Coffey Lake Public Aggregate Pit (Athabasca Minerals Inc., 2019). 
These pits are located southwest of the Richardson Property and are situated in near 
existing oil sands developments and have accessible year-round road infrastructure 
such that aggregate from the pits provides gravel to the majority of the oil sands 
companies operating in northern Alberta.  

With respect to crush rock aggregate, the description of limestone aggregate and 
sand and gravel at Hammerstone Corporation's Muskeg Valley Limestone Quarry and 
aggregate from the Coffey Lake Public Pit is in no way implied to extend onto the 
Property, but is provided as supplemental information, and to make note of the potential 
for, and importance of, crush rock aggregate deposits in the expanding oil sands area 
north of Fort McMurray.  

6.2.2 Polymetallic Black Shale 

Southwest of the Property, the Birch Mountains area is known to host near-surface 
polymetallic Ni-cobalt (Co)-Zn-Cu-U-rare-earth elements (REE)- yttrium (Y) black shale 
(Figure 5). The mineralization is hosted in three late Upper Cretaceous shale units: 
Labiche, Second White Speckled Shale and Shaftesbury formations. The shale 
package comprises flat-lying, near-surface mineralization that is envisaged to extend 
over a vast area (100's of km2) across the Birch Mountains.

6.2.3 Uranium 

To the northeast of the Property, the Athabasca Basin accounts for roughly 15% of 
the world's annual uranium production. The majority of the unconformity-associated 
uranium mines and prospects occur in the eastern portion of the basin where ca. 1.7 to 
1.5 Ga Athabasca Group clastic sedimentary rocks unconformably overlie the western 
Wollaston and Wollaston-Mudjatik basement domains. However, significant uranium 
discoveries such as the Cluff Lake Mine and Shea Creek Deposit near the 
Saskatchewan-Alberta border (underlain by the Clearwater Domain), and the Maybelle 
River prospect in Alberta (underlain by the Taltson Magmatic Zone), demonstrated the 
potential for similar unconformity-associated uranium deposits in the western part of the 
Athabasca Basin (Figure 5; Ruzicka, 1997; Jefferson et al., 2007; Pană and Olson, 
2009). Pană and Olson (2009) concluded that shear/fault–controlled hydrothermal 
convection through a fertile granitoid basement which was sealed by the late 
Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic Athabasca Group strata was the key 
mechanism in the origin of these deposits. 

6.2.4 Prairie-Type Precious Metals 

South of the Property, Birch Mountains Resources Ltd. proposed a 'Prairie-type' 
deposit model, in which reduced formational fluids interacted with sulphate-rich 
evaporite and red beds to become oxidized brines (Figure 5; Feng and Abercrombie, 
1994). The latter leached gold and other metals from the basement and/or red bed units 
and carried the metals as chloride complexes. The metal-loaded solutions migrating 
across formations at the solution front of the Prairie Evaporite Formation and/or along 
fault-breccia zones deposited the metals either at a reducing interface (e.g., organic 
matter in the overlying carbonate and clastic rocks) or due to mixing with fluids of 
contrasting activity of electrons (Eh), activity of hydrogen ions (pH) or salinity 
(Abercrombie and Feng, 1997).  

Feng and Abercrombie (1994) first documented 0.5–2 μm scale native gold (Au), 
silver (Ag), bismuth (Bi), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn), 
along with their alloys, sulphides, oxides, chlorides, carbonates and other compounds in 
the Precambrian basement granitoids and overlying Phanerozoic rocks of northeastern 
Alberta (Abercrombie and Feng, 1997). 

6.2.5 Diamondiferous Kimberlite 

During 1998-1999, eight kimberlitic intrusions were discovered in the Birch 
Mountains, which is located southwest of the Property (Figure 5). The Birch Mountains 
kimberlite field contains an eclectic mixture of alkaline to evolved kimberlite 
compositions, and therefore, has significantly lower diamond content than the Buffalo 
Head Hills kimberlite field, which is located in north-central Alberta (Eccles, 2011). All 
eight bodies were sampled for diamond and only two pipes, Phoenix and Legend 
returned minimal diamonds (Aravanis, 1999).  

During 1998-2000, Ashton Mining of Canada Inc. ("Ashton") collected 168 till 
samples for kimberlite-indicator mineral ("KIM") analysis from their Athabasca Property, 
which encompassed a large region of northeastern Alberta (Skelton and Bursey, 2000).

Fifty-eight samples returned positive grain counts, however, none of the sample results 
contained higher than six total grains of combined pyrope, chrome diopside, olivine, 
chromite or picroilmenite. Within the Richardson Property, the Ashton survey sampled 
no sites. Ashton also conducted an aeromagnetic survey. Unfortunately, the Ashton 
assessment report does not include any geochemical data associated with the KIM 
grains (i.e. only grain counts are recorded).  

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The regional inferred basement geology, bedrock geology and stratigraphic table of 
formations are presented in Figures 6 and 7 and Table 5, respectively, and summarized 
in the text that follows.  

The majority of Alberta is underlain by sedimentary sequences of the Western 
Canada Sedimentary Basin ("WCSB"), which is bounded to the west by the Rocky 
Mountains and to the east by the Canadian Shied. In Alberta, the WCSB is composed of 
a Phanerozoic wedge of strata overlying the crystalline Precambrian basement. This 
wedge measures up to 7,000 m in thickness adjacent to the foothills and diminishes to 
its zero edge along the Canadian Shield to the northeast (Mossop and Shetsen, 1994).  

7.1.1 Precambrian Basement Geology 

Basement rocks typically are masked by sedimentary rocks of the WCSB, and as 
such, the basement domains underlying much of Alberta are inferred from the few oil 
and gas wells that have penetrated to basement, and the chronological studies 
performed on relatively few cores; as a result the basement terrains are defined 
predominantly from regional, widely-spaced aeromagnetic data (Thériault and Ross, 
1991; Ross et al., 1991; Ross et al., 1994).  

With the exception of the easternmost portions of the Property, basement rocks on 
the Richardson Property are generally covered by WCSB sedimentary rocks. The 
basement rocks underlying the WCSB in the Property area consist of two main 
lithotectonic zones: the Taltson Magmatic Zone and the Rae Province (Figure 6). The 
Taltson Magmatic Zone is characterized by a 150 to 200 km wide, north-trending belt of 
positive aeromagnetic anomalies (Ross et al., 1991, 1994). The Taltson magmatic zone 
contains a wide belt of meta-plutonic rocks that can be split into ca. 1.986-1.959 Ga 
magnetite-series (I-type) or continental-arc plutons (e.g. Bostock et al., 1987; 
McDonough et al., 2000) and ca. 1.955-1.910 Ga peraluminous (S-type) plutons (e.g. 
Bostock et al., 1987; McDonough et al., 2000). These plutons intruded a narrow belt of 
Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic orthogneisses and granitoid rocks (e.g. McNicoll et 
al., 2000), termed the Taltson basement complex.

Rocks south of, and underlying, the western Athabasca Basin have historically been 
included in the Rae Province (e.g., Ross et al., 1991, 1994). The Rae Province is 
comprised of five domains (Zemlack, Beaverlodge, Tantato, Lloyd and Clearwater 
domains) consisting mainly of deformed and metamorphosed granite and granitoid 
gneiss (Sibbald, 1974; Lewry and Sibbald, 1977; Ross et al., 1994; Hanmer, 1997). The 
Clearwater Domain is an elongated basement trend contiguous with the 1.85-1.78 Ga 
Rimbey Arc in Alberta (Ross et al., 1994), a basement feature that coincides with the 
560 km long Leduc-Homeglen-Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef chain.

7.1.2 Bedrock Geology 

With the exception of the easternmost part of the Property where basement rocks 
crop out, Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks in the Property area are 
unconformably overlain by Devonian rocks of the WCSB (Table 5; Norford et al., 2004; 
Meijer Drees, 1994). Lower Devonian rocks found within the WCSB are only remnants 
of what once where extensive sedimentary rock layers deposited over the majority of 
the Craton, which were subsequently almost entirely eroded. The Lower Devonian 
sedimentary rocks generally consist of shallow-water carbonates and minor evaporate 
and clastic rocks, with a sharp change to basinal limestone and shale along the western 
border (Norford et al., 2004).  

Stratigraphic sequences of the Lower to Middle Devonian Elk Point Group are more 
common and generally occur throughout the Interior Plains. Elk Point Group strata are 
composed of carbonate, evaporate, red bed and clastic rock units. Unconformities 
representing periods of erosion, subaerial exposure and non-deposition separate the 
sequences from one another (Bebout and Maiklem, 1973; Meijir Drees, 1980). Three 
erosional unconformities, the pre-Devonian, the sub-Headless and the sub-Watt 
Mountain subdivide the Elk Point Group (Moore, 1988; Morrow and Geldsetzer, 1988; 
Meijer Drees, 1990). The Elk Point Group measures up to 1000 m thickness in the 
Mackenzie Mountains and as little as 215 m in the southern plains. It is exposed in the 
Cordilleran Orogen and along parts of the WCSB's northeastern margin. Upper Elk 
point Group formations are extensive and define the Elk point Embayment which 
extends from North Dakota through southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan to northeast 
British Columbia (Meijer Drees, 1994).  

The Middle to Late Devonian Beaverhill Lake Group occurs throughout much of 
Alberta and reach thicknesses up to 240 m. It is unconformably deposited over the Elk 
Point Group and is unconformably to conformably overlain by the Woodbend Group. 
Two stratigraphic phases subdivide the succession into a transgressive reefal phase 
dominated by the Slave Point and Swan Hills carbonate formations, and a regressive 
basin-fill phase dominated by argillaceous carbonate and shale of the Waterways 
Formation. The transgressive phases occurred first during sea-level rise, depositing 
sedimentary rocks of the Watt Mountain Formation, and carbonate and evaporate of the 
Fort Vermillion Formation, and carbonate of the Slave Point Formation. Three reef 
complexes (the Hay River Bank, the Peace River Arch Fringing reef Complex and the 
Swan Hill Complex) developed after the formation of a platform. During the regression 
phase, the Souris River Formation (Souris River Shelf) was formed, followed by 
progradational deposition of the Waterways Formation (Oldale and Munday, 1994) 

The Woodbend and Winterburn groups of the Late Devonian are composed of cyclic 
clastic and carbonate with minor cyclic carbonate and evaporite sequences. Deposition 
of the Woodbend Group occurred during a period of gradual deepening of the WCSB, 
filling the basin with marine shale deposits. Alternatively, the Winterburn Group was 
deposited during a period of shallowing and basin filling. Together, the Woodbend and 
Winterburn groups can measure up to 850 m in thickness. They are recognizable by the 
thick (over 275 m) Leduc Formation reef complex and the Muskwa and Duvernay 
formations; both known to be source rocks high in bitumen. Subsequent transgressive 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           34 
 
 

cycles lead to the deposition of the Lower Ireton, the Upper Leduc, the Upper Ireton, the 
Nisku, and the Blue Ridge intervals, although regression was dominant and resulted in 
relatively flat topography (Switzer et al., 1994).  

In 1990, the Woodbend and Winterburn groups were known to contain roughly 11 
and 32 percent of the oil-equivalent gas reserves and initially established conventional 
oil within Paleozoic strata in the Alberta Basin, respectively (Energy Resources 
Conservation Board, 1990). In general, these pools of oil and gas are characteristic of 
ancient reef complexes formed by different depositional settings, size, shape and facies 
composition (Alberta Society of Petroleum Geologists, 1960, 1966 and 1969). 

The Wabamun Group is the youngest Devonian strata of the WCSB found in the 
subsurface of British Columbia, and in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. It is 
composed of a number of cycled shelf and ramp carbonate and associated evaporite 
deposits. These rocks sub crop from Manitoba to Alberta along a 700 km belt. The 
Wabamun Group's northern and eastern margins are characterized by pre-Mesozoic 
erosion. Two major stratigraphic sequences represent the Wabamun Group; the Stettle 
Formation composed of a low and high-stand carbonate sequence unconformably 
overlain by the Big Valley Formation composed of a siliclastic-carbonate low stand of 
the Banff assemblage (Halbertsma, 1994). 

7.1.3 Surficial Geology 

Surficial deposits in northeastern Alberta are dominated by diamicton (till), 
glaciofluvial and lacustrine deposits, which were deposited directly by glacial ice 
comprised of a mixture of clay, silt, sand and minor pebbles to boulders. Factors 
influencing the location of thick accumulations of sediment in northern Alberta are: 1) 
preglacial valleys; 2) bedrock highlands and remnants; 3) ice marginal still-stands; and 
4) bedrock contacts or scarps (Fenton et al., 2013). Glacial advances in northern 
Alberta originated from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which generally flowed across Alberta 
in a southwesterly direction (Dyke et al., 2002).  

7.2 Property Geology 

The Richardson Property area lies along the passive, eastward thinning margin of 
the WCSB where sedimentary successions unconformably overly and on lap the 
southwest dipping Precambrian basement. Within the Property, Precambrian basement, 
Devonian carbonate and surficial deposits are exposed or occur near surface.  

7.2.1 Precambrian Basement Geology at the Property 

The crystalline basement in the Richardson property area is part of the Taltson 
Magmatic Zone and Rae Province. Basement rocks in Alberta typically are observed 
from oil and gas wells that have penetrated through the WCSB to basement. A total of 
twelve oil and gas wells were drilled historically on the Richardson Property (all prior to 
2013). None of these wells penetrated basement, and as such the depth from surface to 
basement, originally, was estimated at zero to 200 m (Wright et al., 1994). In the greater 
Richardson Property area, a total of three wells have penetrated bedrock, the closest of 
which, is located approximately 15 km north of the Property and intersected the 
Precambrian at 70.1 m depth.  



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           35 
 
 

Precambrian basement rocks consisting of meta-igneous and granitoid lithologies 
are known to crop out in the Property area. Exposures of the Mesoarchean to 
Paleoproterozoic Marguerite River Complex are found on the eastern edge of the 
Property, through Permits 9312060387 and 9312060388. The Marguerite River 
Complex comprises of undifferentiated granite, Arch Lake-type granitoid, hornblende-
quartz monzonite and granitoid gneiss rocks (Dufresne et al., 1994; Prior et al., 2013).  

Based on exposures of granite and drill cores, the Precambrian basement at the 
Richardson property area is comprised of a medium to coarse grained granite with a 
weak foliation defined by the alignment of biotite grains. The granite is variably potassic 
altered ranging from light blue grey to salmon pink. Coarse grains of quartz and alkali 
feldspar dominate the granite.  

7.2.2 Bedrock Geology at the Property 

The majority of the basement rocks within the Richardson Property are overlain by 
Devonian bedrock (Figure 8; Table 5), in addition to Quaternary surficial deposits. Most 
of the bedrock found on the Property comprises the Middle Devonian Winnipegosis 
Formation of the Elk Point Group. The Winnipegosis Formation reflects an open-marine 
platform and reef system and is composed of thickly bedded brownish to yellowish-grey 
dolostone containing various fossils (Macoun, 1877; Bassett, 1952).  

The Winnipegosis Formation can be separated into two different members, a thinly-
bedded lower member and a massive upper member. The lower member consists of a 
thick, finely crystalline light brown and moderately vuggy calcareous dolostone 
containing local grey chert nodules and silty crenulated laminae. The upper member 
consists of finely crystalline light brown to mottled medium and light brown, massive to 
irregularly thick-bedded vuggy dolostone which contains greenish-grey chert in its lower 
section. Sparse brachiopod, bivalve and gastropod fossils can be found within the 
Winnipegosis Formation (Norris, 1963). 

Specific to the Property area, and as interpreted in this Technical Report, the 
Winnipegosis has not been subdivided into two members. While the Winnipegosis 
Formation does comprise variable texture, chemical and physical rock properties (e.g., 
RQD) over its entire length, the formation overall, is extremely consistent and there 
does not seem to be a readily identifiable break between and upper and lower 
members. While the lithological units vary from mudstone to packstone to boundstone, 
there was no single consistent stratigraphic position where one particular property was 
dominant over the other (i.e., where one texture was dominant enough to define upper 
and lower members). 

Underlying the Winnipegosis Formation, the Contact Rapids Formation is comprised 
of marginal marine dolomitic silty shale, argillaceous dolostone and shale-siltstone with 
brachiopods, tentaculites and small spores (Sherwin, 1962; Meijer Drees, 1994). A 
conformable gradational to sharp contact separates the Contract Rapids Formation from 
the Winnipegosis Formation (Norris, 1963). The Contact Rapids Formation reportedly 
occurs on the Property between near the Marguerite River Complex (Permits 
9312060387, 9312060388 and 9312110408; Prior et al., 2013).

A discontinuous zone of detrital basal feldspathic sandstone and conglomerate 
known as the La Loche Formation (equivalent to the Granite Wash) typically occurs 
between the Contact Rapids Formation and the crystalline Precambrian basement.  

The La Loche Formation is of Early Devonian age or older, and comprises fine to 
medium-grained pale brown, irregularly lenticular to thinly-bedded arkosic sandstone, 
cemented with hematite and containing sub-rounded to angular coarse quartz and 
feldspar fragments (Sherwin, 1962; Norris, 1963). Core interpretation indicates that the 
upper and lower contacts of the formation the basement rocks and the overlying 
Contact Rapids Formation are gradational (Norris, 1963). 

7.2.3 Surficial Geology at the Property 

A preliminary surficial geology interpretation of a part of the Property (the area of 
exploration interest; see Figure 9) was completed by APEX prior to selecting drill collar 
locations for the 2014 drill program. Using LiDAR data, the Richardson Property is 
dominated by uneven landforms typical of ice-contact glaciofluvial processes, such as 
kettle depressions and kame deposits (Figure 9). Glaciolacustrine processes have also 
affected the Property topography, typically redistributing sediments into low-lying areas 
and erosion. 

Two topography zones have been defined using LiDAR data; a Southeast Zone 
consisting of hilly topography, and the Northwest Zone consisting of relatively flat 
topography (Figure 9). The Southeast Zone is characterized by large hills and valleys 
measuring hundreds of metres in width, generally trending northeast-southwest up to 
ten km long and up to 40 m in elevation. In the Southeast Zone, shoreline features 
seem to be present at an elevation of approximately 295 m, near the base of kame hills. 
Two kame drainage streams have created outwash fans, causing moderate dissecting 
of the kames. Small and sporadic gravel lags may be present within stream valleys 
(McMillan, 2013). 

The Northwest Zone is characterized by a mostly flat landscape commonly littered 
with depressions and lesser hills. The flat landscape likely reflects wave action erosion. 
A number of small moraine ridges formed during retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. 
Two kame deposits are present, likely consisting of mixed sand and gravel material. 
The deposits trend northwest-southeast and measure up to 200 m wide and 400 m long 
and are about 325 m in elevation. Depressions exceeding 50 m (often 100 m) wide and 
3 m deep appear to correlate with one another in linear patterns over several hundred 
metres. 

The division between the Southeast and Northwest Zones of the Richardson 
Property was created by the former shoreline of Lake McConnell; a glacial lake located 
along the western edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Smith, 1994). Glacial Lake 
McConnell inundated the majority of the Northwest Zone, after approximately 10,500 
years before present (Dyke and Prest, 1987; Smith and Fisher, 1993; Smith, 1994). The 
hilly topography of the Southwest Zone prevented it from being inundated by Lake 
McConnell.

In general, the soils on the Property are classified as leached, well-drained soils with 
occasional peaty soils. Soil differences occur where landscape varies between being 
sloped, hummocky and ridged. In the southeastern corner of the Property, soils have 
developed on a hilly landscape, where they drain quickly, contrary to the southern 
region of the Property, where organic-rich soils drain poorly.  

7.3 Mineralization 

One objective of this Technical Report is to assess the rock properties associated 
with the Winnipegosis Formation dolostone and Precambrian granite at the Richardson 
Property for their suitability as potential crush rock aggregate. Dolomite used as crush 
rock aggregate must be strong, durable and have a low porosity in order to limit water 
absorption (Brown et al., 2013). Good aggregate is associated with thick sections of 
pure dolomite that are well cemented (Ault, 1989). Carbonate rocks are generally strong 
due to their interlocking grain fabrics and carbonaceous mineralogy (Langer, 2006); 
although they can become stronger if they are subjected to silicification processes 
(Langer, 2006). Over time, carbonate rocks are often subjected to more recrystallization 
processes, which in turn increase their strength and decrease their porosity. 
Consequently, these older rocks are more favourable aggregate materials than younger 
ones (Bell, 1993).  

Igneous rocks such as granites typically produce strong aggregates that are skid 
resistant and therefore, are favourable road aggregate materials (Brown et al., 2013). 
Igneous rocks of intrusive origin are generally strong and hard due to their mineralogy, 
grain intergrowth and small grain size. Ideal igneous rocks have been subjected to 
minimal weathering and contain few, if any, large grains and soft minerals (Langer, 
2006). 

Geotechnical and geochemical test work to assess the crush rock aggregate 
potential of the Winnipegosis Formation dolostone and Precambrian granite at the 
Richardson Property are reported in the Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Section of this Technical Report.  

8 Deposit Types  

The main deposit type for consideration at the Richardson Property is crushed rock 
aggregate. However, because Athabasca Minerals is drilling some of the first drillholes 
to core Precambrian basement in this area, secondary consideration must also 
contemplate the potential for a variety of metallic mineral deposit types. While this list 
could be exhaustive, we have limited the discussion in this Technical Report to rare-
earth element and Archean lode gold deposits.  

8.1 Construction Aggregate 

Construction aggregate refers to materials that are hard and granular and are 
suitable to be used alone or with other materials as binding agents. They are produced 
from a variety of construction materials that are usually produced as low-cost, high-
volume and bulk minable commodities (Hack and Bryan, 2006; Brown et al., 2013). The 
most common uses of aggregate include: concrete in building construction; road stone; 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           40 
 
 

railway track blast; or mortar. Limestone and dolomite sourced aggregate can also be 
used as a flux in iron and steelmaking, or to reduce coal sulphur dioxide emissions.  

Generally, aggregates should be strong, hard, tough and sound materials with low 
porosity (Langer, 2006; Brown et al., 2013). Rock soundness is influenced by pore 
sizes, continuity and abundance, fractures and channels, degree of water saturation 
and the presence of particles that are weak, absorbing, swelling or have cleavages 
(McLaughlin et al., 1960; Langer, 2006). Important properties to consider include rock 
type, shape, size, orientation, and mineral grain proportions, contacts, layering, and 
porosity (Dolar-Mantuani, 1983; Langer, 2001). Rocks with high specific gravities 
generally have low porosity and therefore are often associated to high-quality aggregate 
material (Langer, 2006). Aggregates used in the load-bearing layers of roads must 
resist impact loads, crushing, and weathering. They must also have good drainage 
properties, which are determined by pore size distribution, grading and pavement laying 
methods. Pavement surfacing aggregates, on the other hand, must resist stripping and 
polishing (Brown et al., 2013).  

Approximately 15 billion tons of aggregate is produced worldwide each year, 
primarily in the United States, the European Union, China, Russia, Japan and Canada 
(Langer, 2006). In the United States, approximately 2.6 billion tons of aggregate is 
produced annually, where crushed stone comprised 71% limestone, dolomite and 
marble, and 15% granite in 2000 (Hack and Bryan, 2006; Langer, 2006). 

In Canada, Alberta accounts for approximately 67,200 kilotonnes ($1.75 billion), or 
30%, of the total volume of Canada's sand and gravel production (Natural Resources 
Canada, 2014). Most of the aggregate resources have glacial origins, with only a small 
amount (approximately 10%) of the provincial aggregate resources resulting from recent 
alluvial deposits (Edwards, 1995). It is fairly common, however, that aggregate 
production in Alberta is disproportionately reliant on alluvium as these sources are 
generally near surface, and consequently, easier to locate and cheaper to extract. 
Bedrock is extracted from below the surface in those areas of Alberta where aggregate 
is not readily available, and/or specific end product qualities are required. For example, 
in the vicinity of the Richardson Property, limestone is currently being extracted for 
crush rock aggregate and for quicklime processing to remove impurities such as sulphur 
dioxide from smokestack emissions associated with oil sand operations.  

8.2 Dolomite Crush Rock Aggregate 

Dolomite is a bedded to massive, often slightly porous sedimentary rock composed 
primarily (over 90 %) of the carbonate mineral dolomite (Freas et al., 2006; Highley et 
al., 2006; Ministry of Energy, 2013). Dolomite is generally a secondary replacement 
rock that typically forms through alteration processes of calcium carbonate sediment or 
rock caused by saline brines, although they can occasionally form by the precipitation of 
seawater (Freas et al., 2006). Dolomite typically form large tabular rock bodies often 
found within thick sedimentary sequences and associated with dolomitic limestone, 
limestone, sandstone, evaporate and argillite, but can also be associated with sills, 
tuffaceous rocks, palagonite breccia, submarine lavas and chert interbeds and layers 
(British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2013).  



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           41 
 
 

Carbonate rocks can vary from Precambrian to Holocene age and constitute low-
value, high-volume commodities. Carbonate rocks have been quarried or mined in 
every state in the US, and in all but one province in Canada (Freas et al., 2006). 
Examples of dolomite quarries include Pilot Point and Rock Creek, British Columbia, 
Stony Mountain, Manitoba, Guelph, Ontario, Havre-Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Keystone, 
Washington, York, Pennsylvania, and a number of quarries throughout the United 
Kingdom, Italy and France (Ministry of Energy, 2013). In 2001, the United States sold 
and used a total of 101,000,000 tons of crushed dolomite, over 90% of which is used as 
construction aggregate (Hopkins, 2002; Freas et al., 2006).  

8.3 Rare-Earth Elements 

Rare-earth elements ("REE") include: lanthanum ("La"); cerium ("Ce"); 
praseodymium ("Pr"); neodymium ("Nd"); promethium ("Pm"); samarium ("Sm"); 
europium ("Eu"); gadolinium ("Gd"); terbium ("Tb"); dysprosium ("Dy"); holmium ("Ho"); 
erbium ("Er"); thulium ("Tm"); ytterbium ("Yb") and lutetium ("Lu"); scandium ("Sc"); and 
yttrium ("Y"). The majority (up to 80%) of light REE ("LREE"; La to Eu) are produced 
from bastnäsite-(Ce), although monazite (Ce) is also a main source of LREE. Heavy 
REE ("HREE"; Gd to Lu) are generally sourced from xenotime (Y) and ion-adsorption 
clays. The abundance and distribution of individual REE in ore is highly variable 
between different ore bodies and is dependent on structural constraints such as the 
coordination of cations and availability of REE during crystallization (e.g., Humphries, 
2013; Linnen et al., 2014). Highly concentrated REE, Y, niobium ("Nb") and zircon ("Zr") 
are found in silica-undersaturated peralkaline granitic rocks. Deposit examples include: 
Khibiny and Lovozero intrusions, Russia; Ilímaussaq intrusion, Greenland; Thor Lake 
Nechalacho layered suite, Northwest Territories; and Strange Lake intrusion, Quebec. 

8.4 Archean Lode Gold  

Archean lode gold deposits, or shear-zone-hosted gold, generally occur within 
steeply dipping shear zones near contacts with volcanic and sedimentary sequences, 
typically anastomosing, sub-parallel to stratigraphy or continuous and measure over 30 
km and up to 2 km wide. Gold in these deposits is hosted within quartz and possibly 
carbonate veins and less commonly stockworks or silicic and/or carbonate replacement 
zones, which contain electrum, auriferous arsenopyrite or pyrite, native gold, and 
occasionally telluride minerals hosting gold. Silver ("Ag") is often associated with the 
gold mineralization in this setting. Common host rocks include supracrustal rocks, which 
have been metamorphosed and highly altered, and competent lithologies abundant in 
iron, such as gabbro and banded iron formations (BIF's; Klein and Day, 1994; Yeats 
and Vanderhor, 1998). Host rocks occasionally include felsic volcanic rocks, tonalite-
granodiorite-quartz monzonite, conglomerate, greywacke and syenite dikes, plugs and 
stocks. Generally, these deposits are found within metamorphic terranes of the 
greenschist-facies, and rarely granulite-facies (Klein and Day, 1994). 

Archean lode gold deposits account for over 9,900 million tons of global world 
production of gold. Examples these gold deposits include the Sigma mine in Quebec, 
the Campbell mine at Red Lake, the Pamour and Dome mines at Timmins and the Kerr 
Addison mine in Ontario, the Giant Yellowknife and Con mines in the Northwest

Territories, in Canada, the Kalgoorlie, Norseman and Golden Mile mines in Australia 
and in the United States ("US"), the Ropes Mine (Klein and Day, 1994). Typical deposits 
contain 0.5 to 1600 tons Au, grading over 1 gram per ton ("g/t") in open pit mines and 
over 5 g/t in underground mines (Yeats and Vanderhor, 1998). Mesothermal deposits 
are almost exclusively restricted in time to the Archean (~2.7 Ga) with only a few 
occurring in the Mesozoic.  

9 Exploration 

9.1 2013 and 2014 Drill Programs 

Exploration at the Richardson Property is focused on near surface Devonian and 
Precambrian aged bedrock. The Devonian stratum is comprised of dolomitic units 
belonging to the Winnipegosis (and Contact Rapids) formations. The Devonian rocks sit 
unconformably over Precambrian granite. The units are being explored for their mineral 
potential and as a source for aggregate crush rock.  

During 2012 and 2013, Athabasca Minerals staff visited the Richardson Property 
numerous times by ATV and helicopter, produced a field data compilation and drilled 
four diamond drillholes. Geological mapping determined that granite out crop is exposed 
bedrock in the eastern part of the Property. During 2014, Athabasca Minerals retained 
APEX to complete an eight drillhole program (totalling 843 m) to obtain additional 
sample material and conduct a resource estimate of the Devonian Winnipegosis 
Formation and make resource estimate inferences on the underlying Precambrian 
granite.  

Summaries of the 2013 and 2014 drilling, core logging, geotechnical measurements, 
sampling and analytical test work are presented in several sections of this Technical 
Report, including: Drilling; Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security; and Mineral 
Processing and Metallurgical Testing. 

9.2 Multi-Technique Geophysical Survey 

During 2014, a multi-technique geophysical survey was conducted at the Richardson 
Property by APEX Geoscience Ltd. (on behalf of Athabasca Minerals). A series of 
surface geophysical surveys were performed over the area immediately surrounding a 
known granite outcrop on the eastern part of the Richardson property, including: ground 
penetrating radar (GPR); frequency domain electromagnetics (EM); and ground 
magnetics surveying (Figure 10). The goal of the surface geophysical surveys was to: 1) 
test the effectiveness of three easily employable surface geophysical tools for 
identifying and characterizing potential aggregate deposits at the Richardson Property; 
and 2) make inferences on the dimensions of the granite body, including the relationship 
between the granite with the overlying overburden and Devonian Winnipegosis 
Formation dolostone.  

The geophysical surveys support the LiDAR surficial geology interpretations in this 
Technical Report (see Section 7.2.3; Figure 9) and depict several distinct geologic 
zones that merit follow up work, including drilling, at the Richardson Property. The 
methodology and results of the geophysical work is summarized in the text that follows.

Several geophysical survey methods and survey instruments were considered and 
evaluated for their ability to characterize and map the near sub-surface at the 
Richardson Property. Distinct geophysical survey methods deemed suitable for this 
geologic setting and selected for field testing include: GPR, EM and ground magnetic 
surveying. More specifically, three geophysical properties were investigated and used to 
characterize the near surface ground at the Richardson Property: bulk dielectric 
permittivity, recorded using an UltraGPR ultra-wide band ground penetrating radar 
system; bulk electrical resistivity, recorded using both a Geonics EM-31 frequency 
domain electromagnetics instrument and the UltraGPR system; and bulk magnetic 
susceptibility, recorded using a GSM-19W walking magnetometer.   

The geophysical survey instruments were selected for a variety of reasons: they 
have the ability to measure physical properties which would provide information useful 
for identifying bedrock and possible aggregate deposits; the survey equipment requires 
no more than two operators; a lack of line-cutting would not be detrimental to the survey 
operations and results; the instruments would append the GPS coordinates to the 
geophysical response measurements; and the signal and noise levels of the 
instruments would not prevent the sought after contrasts of the geophysical signatures 
from being easily discerned. The depth of geologic features was estimated using the 
GPR and EM responses, while the lateral extent of geologic zones was estimated using 
the magnetic and EM responses.  

9.3 Surface Geophysical Survey Methodology 

A survey grid was established with proposed traverse lines centred over a granite 
outcrop. The grids have a bearing of Azimuth 135º/315º and a line spacing of 50 m 
(Figure 10). Using a Garmin GPSmap 62 handheld receiver that was pre-loaded with 
the proposed traverse lines, the line paths were followed as closely as possible by the 
GPS operator, who was followed by the geophysical operator conducting the 
geophysical survey. The paths occasionally deviated from the proposed line paths 
because of: inherent errors of the GPS coordinate; water-bodies located within the 
survey area; and no line-cutting was completed. The deviations from the proposed line 
paths are not an issue because the goals of this survey required that the three 
geophysical surveys be conducted over the same line paths in real space. While the 
surveys were being conducted, the traverse lines that were marked with biodegradable 
flagging tape to ensure accurate overlapping of the three geophysical surveys.  

9.3.1 Ground Penetrating Radar Survey – Ultra GPR System 

The GPR survey at the Richardson property was completed by APEX between July 
7th and July 14th, 2014 and resulted in 9.7 line-km of UltraGPR data collected over nine 
traverse lines and one tie line (Figure 10). The resulting GPR data was processed and 
interpreted for sub-surface geologic contacts by Jan Francke of Ground Radar Inc. 
(Toronto, ON); the GPR responses were converted from two-way travel times, 
measured in nanoseconds and depths were measured in metres. Deliverables from 
Ground Radar Inc. work included XYZ coordinates of the interpreted layer surfaces and 
databases containing the cross-sectional responses recorded along the traverse lines.

9.3.2 Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Survey - EM31 System 

The Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Survey (FDEM) survey using the EM31 
system was completed at the Richardson property between July 7th and July 14th, 2014. 
The EM31 was operated in vertical dipole mode with the boom oriented longitudinally 
along the traverse lines. In total, 8.7 line-km of FDEM data were collected over eight 
traverse lines and one tie line with the EM31 recoding at a frequency of one reading per 
second (Figure 10).  Effort was taken to keep the boom parallel to the ground as 
measurements were being taken, so that the coils proximity to the ground would not 
severely affect the apparent conductivity measurements. The GPS coordinates were 
placed at the mid-point between the transmitter and coil.  

The apparent conductivity was measured over a test line before each day of 
surveying so that any instrumental drift could be accounted for. During the test line 
measurements, the recorded profiles were found to be within acceptable noise levels 
such that no further calibrations were required.  

9.3.3 Total Field Magnetics Survey - GSM 19-W magnetometer 

Using a Gem System GSM 19-W walking magnetometer, the magnetic survey was 
conducted between July 7th and July 14th, 2014. The survey resulted in 24.5 line-km of 
survey data, which was collected along 13 traverse lines and two tie lines (Figure 10). 
The data was collected at a frequency of one reading per second at an elevation of 
between 1.75 and 2 m above the ground (i.e., the height of the operator). The survey 
included the immediate area around the granite outcrop, which mimicked the area 
surveyed by GPR and EM31.  

In addition, two survey lines were extended to the northwest, along lines 8 and 19. 
This extension added approximately 1,700 m of magnetometer readings along lines 8 
and 19 that were intended to tie in the magnetometer survey northwards to two 2014 
drill holes that were completed by Athabasca Minerals (drillholes 14RLD003 and 
14RLD002 respectively).  

The goal of these two regional magnetic survey lines was to investigate the region 
between the granite outcrop (main focus of the geophysical survey) with the 2014 drill 
program to: 1) determine if any major structures occur in this area; and/or 2) make 
some inferences on the continuity of strata between the geophysical survey area (i.e., 
granite outcrop) and the area of drilling and resource delineation, the latter of which is 
the subject of this Technical Report.   

9.4 Geophysical Survey Results 

9.4.1 Ground Penetrating Radar 

The results of the GPR survey are presented in Figures 11 to 13. The GPR 
responses, as recorded along traverse lines 6, 8, 10 and 99, are displayed as grayscale 
cross-section images in Figure 11. The cross-sections illustrate three distinct reflectors 
that are caused by contrasts in the conductivity and dielectric constant of the sub-
surface and are attributed to layers of different rock types and/or compositions. The 
reflectors are assumed to exist between traverse lines because the depth to these 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           46 
 
 

reflectors does not change drastically from one traverse line to the next and are 
therefore interpreted to be the interfaces between distinct geologic layers.  

The three reflectors have been labelled in order of their depth as "Layer 0", "Layer 
1", and "Bedrock", where "Layer 0" is the shallowest reflector, and "Bedrock" is the 
deepest reflector (Figure 11). Based on the known geology (from the 2014 drill program 
and fieldwork mapping and testing), these three reflectors are interpreted to represent 
the following geological units: 

• Layer 0 to Layer 1 - overburden (Layer 0), which includes kame and glacial 
outwash deposits unconformably overlie the Winnipegosis Formation (Layer 1) 
reflector;  
 

• Layer 1 to Bedrock – this area corresponds to the Devonian Winnipegosis 
Formation (Layer 1) reflector down to the Bedrock (Bedrock) reflector, or the 
Precambrian crystalline basement granite.  
 

• Bedrock and below – the Precambrian crystalline basement granite.  

Anything above the Layer 1 reflector in Figure 11 is designated as overburden 
surficial deposits. The Layer 0 reflector in the southeastern portion of the survey area 
must relate to a distinct subset of the overall overburden that was identified by the GPR 
survey (i.e., from surface to the top of reflector Layer 1). This reflector will require further 
investigation, however, to be properly explained. Initial interpretations of the overburden 
(Layer 0) reflector is that it is due to zones of high-water content in the glacial deposits, 
but Ground Radar Inc. suggests it is too strong of a reflection to be entirely attributed to 
a change in water content in the glacial deposits. In addition, the southeast survey area 
is characterized as the driest area on the grid and there is still no re-growth after a large 
2011 wildfire. Hence, Layer 0 could reflect a very dry layer (i.e., a thick sequence of 
sand), but it's unlikely that the water content changes vary that much and that 
abruptly.  The problem, possibly, is that the GPR system is too powerful, and operates 
at too low a frequency to make any details visible within that specific overburden 
horizon.  

The depths to the Layer 1 and Bedrock reflectors have been gridded to show how 
the depths of these interpreted geological layers varies over the survey area (Figures 12 
and 13, respectively). The layers are shown to be generally flat lying. The thicknesses 
of the overburden surficial material (anything above the top of reflector Layer 1), is 
generally attributed to correspond to glacial features (i.e., the kame deposit) that has 
been observed and mapped in the LiDAR data (see Section 7.2.3, Surficial Geology at 
the Property).  

Based on the GPR results, the estimated areas of combined surficial overburden 
and Winnipegosis Formation dolostone material that is situated on top of the 
Precambrian granite and is within 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m of surface is 
approximately: 4,600 m2; 15,200 m2; 45,100 m2; 91,300 m2; and 147,233 m2, 
respectively (Figure 13).

top of the Winnipegosis Formation dolostone; and Bedrock – the top of the Precambrian basement granite.

9.4.2 Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Survey (FDEM) EM31 System 

The apparent conductance measured during this survey fell between -5.75 and 5.97 
millisiemens per meter (mS/m), with a mean value of 0.32 mS/m and a standard 
deviation of 1.05 mS/m.  

Processing of the in-phase data revealed a static shift along several of the lines 
(amounting to 1.9 line-km of in-phase data; Figure 14). Consequently, the in-phase data 
was not considered for interpretation (i.e., the in-phase component of the measured 
electromagnetic field is most valuable for highly conductive features, such as detection 
of buried metal objects).  

In contrast, the EM31 quadrature response shows that the area is weakly conductive 
overall, but that there is a definitive conductive halo occurring in the area immediately 
surrounding the granite outcrop (Figure 15). The apparent conductivity map shows that 
the granite outcrop is a resistive body, and that the conductive halo is due to a 
conductive layer overlaying the granite bedrock. This conductive halo area is directly 
associated with a regional topographic low, which indicates the apparent conductance 
might be a due to a zone in the near surface with elevated water content.  

The GPR data shows that the depth to the granite bedrock is relatively shallow in 
this area of increased conductivity, and it could be that the shallow bedrock is causing 
the water content to remain at relatively shallow depths that can be measured by the 
EM31 system (up to six m). The map of the EM31 quadrature response shows a second 
conductive zone on the northwest end of traverse lines 7 through 12 (Figure 15). The 
traverse lines end where the quadrature response is trending upward, and 
subsequently, this conductive response is thought to represent a gridding artifact where 
there has been no data collected. In addition, it should be noted that the traverse lines 
to the northwest end at the edge of a swamp, so it would be expected that the apparent 
conductance would be higher at this locale. This supports the belief that the conductive 
halo around the granite outcrop is due to near surface having high water content. 

9.4.3 Magnetic Survey Results 

The results from the magnetic survey are presented in Figures 16, 17 and 18. 
Processing of the magnetic survey data included reducing the data to residual magnetic 
intensity (RMI), which levels data that were collected on different days to a common 
reference line, removes spurious readings associated with low signal quality, and then 
grids the survey data to create colour images of the RMI amplitude (Figure 16). The 
geostatistics were calculated for the RMI response measured during the magnetic 
survey, and the range of magnetic field strength over the property is found to be 270.65 
nanoTeslas (nT), with a standard deviation of over 53 nT. In addition, derivative filters 
such as the vertical derivative and analytical signal were applied to the gridded RMI 
map and were used to interpret edges and centres of the causative magnetic source 
bodies (Figures 17 and 18).

The ground magnetics survey data highlights three distinct litho-magnetic zones at 
the Richardson Property geophysical survey area (e.g., Figure 16), including:  

1. The dominant magnetic feature occurring on the Richardson property can be 
identified as a zone with a strong positive magnetic response, occurring over the 
northern half of the EM31 and GPR survey lines – Zone A.  
 

2. The magnetics data over the southern half of the EM31 and GPR survey lines 
identifies a zone with a moderate negative magnetic response – Zone B.  
 

3. The area to the northwest of the magnetic anomaly (Zone A) is magnetically 
quiet, with a weak positive magnetic gradient occurring on the very end of the 
regional magnetic lines extending out to the 14RLD003 and 14RLD002 drill holes 
– Zone C.  

The spatial extent of magnetic Zone A strongly correlates with the area identified as 
a kame deposit by McMillan (2013; see Section 7.2.3, Surficial Geology at the 
Property). The spatial extent of magnetic Zone B correlates with "Layer 0" in the GPR 
interpretation. This suggests that the overburden deposits throughout the survey area 
are not laterally homogeneous and lends further support to the presence of a unique 
kame deposit that is situated directly northwest of the granite outcrop (i.e., the Zone A 
magnetic high). 

9.5 Geophysical Summary and Conclusions 

The interpretations remain inherently ambiguous and require petrophysical data and 
other geological information to properly classify the identified litho-magnetic zones. 
Nevertheless, several preliminary interpretations can help to guide future exploration in 
the eastern part of the Richardson Property. The results of the geophysical surveys 
show that the spatial extent of several distinct geological features can be mapped using 
a combination of GPR and ground magnetics data. There is a strong correlation among 
the physical properties of the overburden (particularly the kame deposit), the 
Winnipegosis Formation and the granite bedrock.  

The GPR was most useful for showing the depth to the geological layers, while the 
magnetics data identified lateral changes in the subsurface that were not observed in 
the GPR response. The GPR profiles display interpretable data to depths of up to 60 m.  
The granite outcrop is fairly constrained to the immediate area; however, the GPR 
profiles suggest that the area directly north of the outcrop yield the shallowest thickness 
of overburden and/or Winnipegosis Formation to the Precambrian basement granite. 
Hence, any further exploration on the granite as a potential source of crush rock 
aggregate can use the results of this geophysical survey to target drill locations.  

Based on the GPR results, the estimated areas of combined surficial overburden 
and Winnipegosis Formation dolostone material that is situated on top of the 
Precambrian granite and is within 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m of surface is 
approximately: 4,600 m2; 15,200 m2; 45,100 m2; 91,300 m2; and 147,233 m2, 
respectively (Figure 13).  



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           57 
 
 

Using the interpreted GPR litho-units, in concert with surficial topography associated 
with the LiDAR data, a rough volume calculation of potential geological units over an 
area of 407,700 m2 yields:  

• 11,758,000 m3 of total combined material (overburden and/or Winnipegosis 
Formation) from surface to the granite bedrock;  
 

• 4,377,000 m3 of overburden from surface to top of the Winnipegosis Formation; 
and  
 

• 7,381,147 m3 of potential Winnipegosis Formation. 

With respect to lateral changes, the GPR was unable to identify changes in 
overburden type across the survey area (apart from vertical layering associated with 
Layer 0). However, the magnetic data clearly shows that there is a lateral change in the 
rock properties of the uppermost surficial materials, as explained by the contrasting 
magnetic zones A and B.

10.1 2013 Drill Campaign  

In 2013, Athabasca Minerals conducted a drilling program that concluded with core 
being derived from four diamond drillholes totaling 235.1 m (out of 16 originally 
proposed drillholes). The program, which was conducted between January 21st and 
February 16th, 2013, had originally proposed 16 drillholes, but the program was 
shortened due to lost circulation problems within overburden and through bedrock. In 
addition, diamond drillholes GNA-05, GNA-11 and GNA-16 were abandoned prior to 
intersecting Precambrian basement due to poor drilling conditions. Hence, drillhole 
GNA-10 represented the lone drillhole from the 2013 drill program to penetrate through 
the entire lithostratigraphic section of Winnipegosis Formation and downward into 
Precambrian granite (Table 6).  

10.2 2014 Drill Campaign 

 During February 2014, Athabasca Minerals undertook an 843 m core drilling 
program over a large section of the Richardson Property. Eight diamond holes 
(14RLD001 to 14RLD008) were completed over an area spanning 20 km2 (Figure 19). 
With the exception of drillhole 14RLD006, the program successfully cored entire 
sections of the Winnipegosis Formation with all but one drillhole terminating in 
Precambrian basement granite (Table 6). The drilling termination strategy was generally 
to end the hole once 10 m of Precambrian basement was penetrated (Table 6). One 
drillhole (14RDL007) tested the granite to depth coring 44.5 m of Precambrian material. 
Drill collar locations were limited to existing access within the property and where 
possible collars were shifted in order to take advantage of natural and pre-existing 
clearings. Final collar locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. Drill pads 
were reclaimed by a combination of back blading to distribute and cuttings left on 
surface as well as redistributing any fallen timber by hand over the drill site. Collars 
were marked with an aluminum tag placed on the southwest corner of the drill pad.  

Overburden thickness averaged 35.4 m and consisted largely of unconsolidated 
sand and boulders. The Devonian stratigraphy averaged 55.1 m in thickness and was 
comprised largely of competent, light brown dolostone with lesser wackestone, 
sandstone and shale. Bitumen content throughout the project area was highly variable 
ranging from minor (<5%) bitumen infilled vugs to moderate (e.g., 40%) amounts 
bitumen infilling vugs, fractures and karsts. The vuginess, sand-content and fracturing of 
the Devonian rocks appears to play a major role in bitumen distribution.  

Minor karsting and bitumen content within the Devonian stratigraphy, as well as a 
conglomerate/pebble lag, mark the unconformity between the Devonian and 
Precambrian units. The granite consisted of light-blue grey coarse-grained weakly 
foliated granite, which remained fairly consistent throughout the property. The granite 
was subjected to variable potassic alteration. The unconformity marking the transition 
from the Devonian rocks to the Precambrian basement was marked by a zone of 
conglomerate lag, and/or brecciated and dolomitic-cemented granite.

Further reclamation may be required due to the sandy nature of the area and the 
development of small depressions that were created by flowing drill water associated 
with normal drill processes, therefore small depressions are likely to form at the collars 
in the spring.  

10.3 Regional Stratigraphic Considerations (based on a compilation of oil and gas wells in 
conjunction with Athabasca Minerals drill results)  

To test whether the Richardson crush rock aggregate deposit has the potential to be 
extended, a regional stratigraphic evaluation was undertaken on the Devonian and 
basement formation tops. Data compilation for the purpose of evaluating the continuity 
of Devonian and basement units include data from: 1) Athabasca Minerals 2013 and 
2014 drill programs; 2) oil and gas well information from GeoSCOUT (an oil and gas 
information system that provides publicly available formation top data); and 3) historical 
metallic and industrial mineral assessment reports (e.g., Laanela, 1977, 1978; 
McWilliams and Sawyer, 1977; Bradley, 1978; Fortuna, 1979; McWilliams et al, 1977; 
Walker, 1980; Orr, 1986, 1989, 1991; Orr and Robertshaw, 1989).  

The investigation consisted of an area encompassed by T96-T1-W4, and T106-
R14–W4 (Figure 20). Within this area, 6,264 Devonian penetrating wells are known 
from GeoSCOUT; only five of these wells penetrated the basement illustrating the 
emphasis on the Cretaceous McMurray Formation as an oil sands prospect. From 
historic assessment reports, 140 and 65 drillholes penetrated the top of the Devonian 
and basement, respectively (Figure 21). A more refined study area measuring 
approximately 1,000 km2 (inset map in Figure 21), contains 29 wells and drillholes that 
penetrated Devonian (including Athabasca Minerals 2013 and 2014 drillholes). The 
depth to the top of the Devonian within these wells and drillholes varies between 18 m 
and 89 m from surface and, in general, the depth to Devonian increases to the 
southwest to depths of 50 m or greater.  

The Athabasca Minerals drillholes, and other historical wells and drillholes to the 
north of the 2013 and 2014 drillholes indicate Devonian depths between 18 m and 334 
m, with only four historical drillholes with Devonian depths of between 48 m and 61 m, 
including Athabasca Minerals 2013 drillhole GNA-16 (depth of 47.80 m). This data 
suggests that the depth to the top of the Devonian as seen within 2013 and 2014 
drillholes has general depth continuity toward the north and northwest of the Richardson 
Property.  

During the investigation, drillhole and well collar elevations were taken into 
consideration. Within the refined area of interest, collar elevations varied between 262 
m and 313 m asl. By adjusting Devonian depths to be calculated with respect to the 
'lowest collar elevation of 262.1 m', the continuity of the Devonian can be evaluated 
(Table 7). This study shows that these units are not continually flat, but rather increase 
in depths to the north and south of the 2013 and 2014 drillhole locations.  Based on the 
data compilation, the depth to the top of the Devonian in the area, as shown in Figure 
21 (and Table 7), is relatively shallow within the Richardson Property, and in particular, 
toward the northeast. The depth to the top of the Devonian increases in thickness 
toward to southwest as distance from the Property increases.

Data for the top of the Precambrian is limited toward the south, southeast, southwest 
and west of the Richardson Property, due to overall shallow nature of the oil and gas 
testing. The top of the Precambrian as represented in Figure 22, is relatively deep within 
the Property and shallows toward the east-northeast. A more refined study area 
measuring approximately 750 km2 contains a total of 32 wells and drillholes that 
penetrate basement (Figure 22). The depth to the top of the Precambrian within these 
wells/drillholes varies between 19 m and 97 m from surface.  

The Athabasca Minerals drillholes shows that the depth to the top of the 
Precambrian generally shallows toward the north and northwest of the Richardson 
Property and that the depth shown in the 2013 and 2014 drillholes is not continuous 
away from this area. Within the refined area, collar elevations varied between 262.1 m

and 338.0 m asl. By adjusting Precambrian depths to be calculated with respect to the 
'lowest collar elevation of 262.1 m', the continuity of the Precambrian supports previous 
observations that the top of the Precambrian decreases in depth to the northeast and 
east of the 2013 and 2014 drillholes (Figure 22, Table 8). However, this conclusion is 
tenuous because the granite is known to crop out in the eastern part of the Property.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1 Core Handling and Initial Geotechnical Preparation Procedure 

The 2014 drill core was quick-logged during the drill program at the Richardson 
Property camp. Upon completion, the core boxes were tightly secured (to circumvent 
core displacement) on flatbed trailers and/or truck beds and transported by road from 
the Richardson Property to Athabasca Minerals warehouse in Edmonton, Alberta. Upon 
arrival, the core was stored inside a steel shipping container in a locked yard – together 
with cores from Athabasca Minerals 2013 drill campaign. The purpose for moving the 
drill core to Edmonton was to commence detailed core logging, geotechnical 
characterization and sampling in indoor, heated and well-lit work bays at Athabasca 
Minerals office. Core handling, geotechnical characterization, logging, sampling and 
shipping was completed by APEX staff under the direct supervision of R. Eccles who 
takes overall responsibility for the core procedures and the content of this Technical 
Report.  

11.2 Geotechnical Characterization 

This Technical Report includes a maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource 
estimate of the Middle Devonian Winnipegosis Formation at Athabasca Minerals 
Richardson Property. In accordance with proper assessment of a crush rock aggregate 
deposit, which involves criteria that considers the materials strength, continuity, 
fractures and the presence of weakening particulate matter, this assessment has 
implemented an expanded geotechnical procedure for drill core evaluation as follows:  

• Length and recovery measurements to record the actual length of core recovered 
from each logging interval. It was recorded in metres and as a percentage of the 
logging interval. The length of core was measured (eliminating gaps by pushing 
pieces together) between each set of blocks. Recovery (percent) was calculated 
by dividing the Theoretical Length (logged interval) by the Recovered Length and 
multiplying by 100. 
 

• Rock Quality Description (RQD) is a modified measure of core recovery and is 
defined as the percentage of core in each log interval in which the spacing 
between natural fractures is greater than 10 cm.  
 

• Fracture frequency and rock defects were measured by recording the number of 
bedding planes, joints, faults and shears (natural) per metre. The most common 
rock defect types were recorded as a numeric code and their angles were 
measured in degrees, with respect to the core axis. 
 

• Discontinuity and fracture condition were examined and classified according to 
the Joint Roughness (Jr) and Joint Alteration (Ja) descriptors of the Tunnelling 
Quality Index Q (Barton et al, 1974).  

 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           67 
 
 

• Rock weathering grade, which was based on rock discolouration extent, rock 
fabric condition, fracture condition and surface characteristics, were used for field 
estimation of weathering observed in drill core.  
 

• Specific Gravity (SG) measurements were carried out once per every metre to 
calculate the weight (tonnage) of a volume of rock using the following formula: 

SG = Weight in air / (Weight in air – Weight in water) 

• Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer measurements were taken every 
metre of core to provide an evaluation of the chemical homogeneity, potential 
aggregate strength of the core, and to evaluate the metallic mineral potential of 
the core. Major elements measurements were recorded directly onto a laptop 
computer with tube settings as follows: 15kV, 23µA, no filter and vacuum pump 
attached. Spectra was collected for a 60 second timed assay and data was sent 
for calibration and interpreted daily. 

11.3 Core Documentation 

Upon completion of geotechnical characterization, detailed lithological logging was 
completed by APEX geologists. Logging was entered directly into an Excel logging 
spreadsheet. Aggregate sample intervals were laid out by Formation. From each hole, 
composite samples were chosen from the Winnipegosis Formation, Contact Rapids 
Formation, and the Precambrian basement granite, when applicable.  

The core was photographed dry and wet. The camera was mounted to a stand set 
up in the same location providing consistent zoom, angle and lighting. Photographs 
were saved directly to the camera and data would be transferred to computer as high-
resolution jpeg images upon completion of a set. All pictures were checked and 
renamed as soon as possible to ensure quality and avoid potential data loss.  

11.4 Core Splitting 

A manual wheel splitter with a four-inch blade was used to halve and quarter the 
core. Composite samples were halved with the exception of the duplicate check and 
geochemical samples, which were quartered. The remaining core (half or quarter) was 
put back into the box to be kept as an archive. Effort was made by the splitter to ensure 
that the side of core sampled remained as consistent as possible, proper placement of 
core back into the box, cleaning between samples to prevent contamination, and proper 
bagging and recording. In rare instances, any interval that included >30 cm of pervasive 
bitumen saturation was not included into the splitting process or sample. 

11.5 Sample Shipping 

All sampling was completed by APEX. Samples for the individual geochemistry 
intervals were collected by placing the material in heavy grade plastic sample bags with 
the sample numbers written on both sides in permanent marker. Sample tags marked 
with the sample numbers were included inside each sample bag, which were sealed 
with plastic cable ties. Samples were then placed into a rice bags lined with a larger 
heavy grade plastic bag for shipment. 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta  

October 24, 2019           68 
 
 

For composite samples, two large heavy grade sample bags were placed into a rice 
bag to create the composite for the respective drillhole and lithology. Composite 
samples typically consist of multiple rice bags with each bag weighing approximately 20 
kg. The composite sample rice bags were sealed with a cable tie for transport to the 
laboratory. Laboratory instructions included crushing and homogenizing all samples 
within the single composite sample to homogenize the sample for test work.  

A hard copy submittal form including sample inventory and instructions for the 
laboratory were placed inside the first bag of each shipment and sealed with plastic 
cable ties. Rice bags were stretch wrapped onto skids to be transported by courier from 
Athabasca Minerals office to the laboratories. The exception is the duplicate check 
sample taken directly to the laboratory by APEX personnel.  

11.6 Analytical Test Work  

The analytical sampling process consisted of two separate sample sets: 1) 
composite samples for aggregate test work; and 2) interval or channel samples for 
major- and trace-element geochemical analysis. The objective of the aggregate 
analytical test work – in the context of this crush rock aggregate resource estimate – 
was predominantly focused on the aggregate mechanical qualities for its use in 
aggregate road building and concrete. Geochemical analyses were also performed to 
make inferences on the potential hindrances to rock strength (e.g., modal clay 
abundance through elements like Al). A secondary component of the geochemical work 
was to test whether the basement granite rocks contain REE and/or precious- and 
base-metal potential.  

The analytical test work was performed in accordance with the thickness and 
lithology of the various units. Drill core from some of the units (Contact Rapids and the 
Precambrian basement granite) did not penetrate thick enough intersections to create a 
large enough sample for certain test work. Consequently, the test work completed as 
part of this study is complicated, and Table 9 is provided to explain the number and type 
of individual analysis (aggregate test work and geochemical analysis) that was 
undertaken for specific lithological units and from each drillhole.  

11.6.1 Aggregate Analytical Test Work 

Composite aggregate samples were collected by taking a continuous ¼ to ½ split of 
core over the entire Winnipegosis Formation. The Winnipegosis unit was thick enough 
to create composite samples from each drillhole (n=10), including one duplicate sample 
from drillhole GNA-10. The composite samples typically comprised 60 kg to 150 kg of 
total material. Because the Contact Rapids and granite intersections are not as thick as 
the Winnipegosis it was not possible to collect a single composite sample from every 
drillhole. Subsequently Contact Rapids and granite composite samples encompass 
more than one drillhole that were amalgamated into a single sample to be analysed 
together (see Table 9). A single composite sample of Contact Rapids was collected 
using material from all 10 drillholes. Two composite samples of basement granite were 
collected from eight drillholes (from all of the drillholes that penetrated basement).

 To summarize, the sample set consisted of the following 14 composite samples:  

• 11 total Winnipegosis composite samples (10 samples from each drillhole that 
were analyzed at AMEC, and one duplicate sample from drillhole GNA-10 that 
was analyzed at Tetra Tech EBA);  
 

• one Contact Rapids composite sample, which includes material from the 10 
drillholes; and  
 

• two Precambrian basement granite composite samples, which included material 
from the eight drillholes that penetrated basement (Table 9).  

The sampling scheme was adopted to place emphasis on the road crush 
aggregate potential of Devonian Winnipegosis Formation, and secondarily, test the 
aggregate potential of the Precambrian basement granite. The Contract Rapids 
Formation was not considered a crush rock aggregate candidate; however, a single 
sample was analyzed to obtain is aggregate specification, particular because the unit 
occurs stratigraphically between the overlying Winnipegosis and underlying granite.  

Aggregate samples were analyzed at AMEC in Calgary, Alberta. A separate 
laboratory 'check aggregate sample' (discussed in the Data Verification Section) was 
analyzed at EBA Tetra Tech in Edmonton, Alberta. The aggregate test work 
methodologies are in accordance with the Alberta Transportation aggregate standards 
for road aggregate and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) concrete standards. 
These test standards are better referenced as:  

1. Alberta Transportation Specification for aggregate production and stockpiling 
(Alberta Transportation, 2010) – more specifically, Test Methods Used to 
Determine Material Characteristics (their Table 3.2.3.2 A, B, C); and  
 

2. CSA-A23.1-09/A23.2-09 Concrete materials and methods of concrete 
construction/Test methods and standard practices for concrete (CSA, 2009) – 
more specifically, Limits for Deleterious Substances and Physical Properties of 
Concrete Aggregate (their Table 12, CSA A23.2). 

The individual analytical techniques for the Alberta Transportation and CSA 
aggregate testing methods are presented in Table 10. Because the Winnipegosis 
dolostone and Precambrian basement granite materials are 'hard rock' and 
uncharacteristic of 'typical' sand and gravel-type aggregate, not all of the Alberta 
Transportation and CSA test methods were performed on the Richardson Property 
core samples. With the exception of sieve analyses, all of the Alberta Transportation 
specifications for aggregate test methods were conducted on the Winnipegosis, 
Contact Rapids and basement granite composite samples. With respect to the CSA 
standard test methods, only two Winnipegosis Formation composite samples were 
tested for unconfined freeze-thaw test. Due to the nature of the competent dolostone 
and granite rock, the majority of the CSA standard test methods were not analyzed. 
Hence, the testing should be viewed as a general aggregate testing, as opposed to 
fine- or coarse-aggregate testing. See Section 13.1 for an explanation of aggregate 
test work processing and a complete set of analytical results

11.6.2 Geochemical Analytical Test Work 

Geochemical samples were taken as ¼ core splits of continuous material for 0.5-3 
m intervals throughout the Precambrian basement granite and approximately every ten 
metres of the Winnipegosis Formation. These samples were sent to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd. (Acme) in Vancouver, British Columbia for analysis. Acme is an 
international accredited laboratory with International Standards Organization (ISO) 
Model for Quality Assurance ISO9001:2008 certification. The Vancouver facility is also 
accredited with ISO/IEC 17025 General Requirements for the Competence of Testing 
and Calibration Laboratories. 

Whole rock geochemical samples were prepared and analysed at Acme Analytical 
Laboratories in Vancouver, British Columbia. One kilogram of the crushed sample is 
passed through a 2 mm screen to +70%. A 250 g split of the sample is then pulverized 
to +85% passing through a 75 µm screen. The sample is then decomposed by Total 
Whole Rock Characterization analysis consisting of standard suite major oxides (21 
parameters) by Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-ES) and 
standard suite trace elements (45 elements) by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass 
Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). This is achieved through fusion techniques which completely 
decompose the sample, account for structural water and provide quantitative silicon 
values resulting in total element concentration data suitable for whole rock 
classification diagrams and molar element ratio studies (BVM, 2014).The sample 
preparation and analysis processes are subject to internal Quality Control and Quality

Assurance (QA/QC) protocols carried out by Acme during the progression of the 
service. 

11.6.3 Density Analytical Test Work 

In addition to Specific Gravity (SG) measurements, which were measured during 
the geotechnical work (one SG measurement per every metre), bulk and relative 
density and absorption tests were also conducted on the composite samples at AMEC 
and Tetra Tech EBA to determine the absorption of water on aggregate, bulk specific 
gravity and the saturated-surface dry bulk specific gravity of aggregate samples.  

11.7 Quality Assurance/Quality Control Measure One 

Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer measurements were taken every 
metre of core to provide an evaluation of the chemical homogeneity, potential 
aggregate strength of the core, and to evaluate the metallic mineral potential of the 
core. Geochemical samples, which were analyzed at Acme, were taken as ¼ core 
splits of continuous material over approximately one- to two-metre intervals throughout 
the Precambrian basement granite and for one sample for every ten metres of the 
Winnipegosis Formation. 

The portable XRF analyzer is a semi-quantitative tool; however, several studies 
have shown that it performs adequately in comparison to laboratory analyses (e.g., 
Lesemann et al., 2011; Knight et al., 2011) and the handheld XRF is used for a variety 
of mining applications, including core analysis, mineral exploration, geochemical 
testing, and waste processing and metal contamination. The XRF measurements taken 
as part of the core geotechnical work generally consider the data as semi-quantitative. 
The measurements were taken predominantly to provide information on the 
homogeneity of the selected rock units, and in this regard, the XRF performed 
adequately (see Section 14.4, Data Type Comparison).  

The technological comparison between the two geochemical methods is at odds; 
that is, the XRF uses a spot measurement versus the whole rock laboratory-analyzed 
geochemistry, which analyzed a one- to two-metre 'channel' sample of continuous 
core. Nevertheless, a brief comparison between the two methods is presented in 
Figures 23 and 24 to provide some measure of QAQC on the work that was conducted, 
and because analytical processing for industrial minerals such as the Richardson crush 
rock aggregate deposit is reliant on mechanical strength tests rather than conventional 
geochemical-type surveys that are more typical of metallic mineral deposits.  

The results show that there is generally positive agreement between the XRF and 
the laboratory geochemistry, particularly for the granite samples. The Winnipegosis are 
more scattered with lower confidence between the two methods. Due to the different 
sampling criteria, as mentioned above, this comparison should be taken with a degree 
of skepticism. The fact that the granite XRF and lab data correlate nicely it is not 
surprising given that the mineralogical composition of the granite is more uniform than 
the Winnipegosis dolostone. The Winnipegosis is more variable that the granite in a 
textural sense, and therefore, is likely mineralogically variable as well (e.g., a larger 
amount of local fossil content). Subsequently, the poor correlation between the XRF 
and lab data for the Winnipegosis Formation is not overly surprising.

11.8 Quality Assurance/Quality Control Measure Two 

A total of 675 bulk density measurements were collected from drill core within the 
Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource area. The measurements 
were conducted directly on drill core sample using the "hydrostatic" method, which 
involves weighing the item in air and then again while fully submerged in water. Density 
measurements were collected once every metre of drill core and were separated by 
formation to calculate an average bulk density for each formation within the resource 
area. The density data are presented as histograms in Figure 25. With respect to the 
Winnipegosis Formation, which is the primary formation target in this resource 
estimation, a total of 395 density measurements using the hydrostatic method were 
collected from the Winnipegosis core sections; these data have an average bulk 
density of 2.68 with a variance over the 395 measurements of 0.01.  

The hydrostatic density measurements for the Winnipegosis Formation were 
compared against density measurements conducted at AMEC and Tetra Tech EBA as 
part of the aggregate test work (Table 11). The average bulk relative density, saturated 
surface dry relative density and apparent relative density of 10 Winnipegosis Formation 
samples yielded 2.65, 2.70 and 2.80, respectively, in the aggregate test work. 
Consequently, these densities are within 0.03 of the hydrostatic average value (2.68) 
that is used for resource estimations in this Technical Report. The nearly identical 
density values that were produced by APEX during core geotechnical work and at two 
separate laboratories provide assurance that the density value used in the Richardson 
maiden inferred crust rock aggregate resource estimate are realistic and represent a 
conservative density value for resource estimation.

measurements) and during aggregate test work at AMEC and Tetra Tech EBA laboratories.

11.9 Quality Assurance/Quality Control Measure Three 

A duplicate composite core sample of the Winnipegosis Formation was collected 
from a single drillhole, GNA-10. The intent of this sample is to serve as an aggregate 
test work check sample. The sample was collected and analyzed by sending a ¼ split 
of core from the same drillhole and sample interval (i.e., the Winnipegosis formation) to 
one lab and the other ¼ split of core to another lab. The laboratories are of 
independent and competitive companies and were instructed to perform the same 
analytical tests.  

A comparison of the results from the two separate analytical laboratories is 
presented in Table 12; and summarized as follows:  

• The plasticity indices were both classified as non-plastic; 
 

• The L.A. Abrasion loss were identical (i.e., a variance of 0.0);  
 

• The MgSO4 soundness loss had the largest discrepancy of the aggregate test 
work comparison with a variance of 10.125; 
 

• The bulk relative density, saturated surface dry bulk relative density and 
apparent relative density all had a variance of 0.0004; and 
 

• The absorption had a variance of 0.0032; 

The test work check sample produced similar results. The only discrepancy was 
MgSO4 soundness loss, which is likely a result of differences of size fractions analyzed. 
That is while all tests were conducted on the coarse fraction, the sizes were subject to 
some variation between the labs. With respect to the MgSO4 soundness loss test, the 
AMEC sample produced an MgSO4 soundness loss of 2.0 based on a 20 mm to 80 
mm size fraction. In comparison, two MgSO4 soundness loss results were reported by 
Tetra Tech EBA: one on a fine aggregate size fraction (160 µm to 10 mm) that yielded 
a loss of 3.2; and a coarse aggregate size fraction (5 mm to 80 mm) that yielded a loss 
of 6.5. It is likely, therefore, that a coordinated measurement on identical size fractions 
might produce a lower variance in this particular test measurement.

composite Winnipegosis sample from drillhole GNA-10. Results are reported from coarse aggregate 
fractions.

12 Data Verification 

The QP's and/or APEX consulting geologists were not involved in Athabasca 
Minerals 2013 drill program. Verification procedures applied to assess the 2013 
exploration work, as conducted by the senior author, included reviewing the original 
hardcopy driller notes, drill logs and laboratory certificates, and comparing this 
information against the electronic datasets. The 2013 drill results were also tested 
against the 2014 drill program, which was managed by APEX.  

In some instances, APEX staff had to convert hard copy data to electronic format, in 
which case the QP reviewed all data conversion. There were no inconsistencies 
between the drill logs and the geology file, and analytical data and the estimation file.  

Mr. Eccles P. Geol. oversaw the APEX-led 2014 exploration operations including 
the drilling, geotechnical core measurements, core logging, core sampling, aggregate 
test work and geochemical analytical work. APEX geologists managed the day-to-day 
operations of the Athabasca Minerals 2014 drill program. Mr. Eccles takes overall 
responsibility for reporting criteria in this Technical Report and the Richardson maiden 
inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate.  

Before commencing work on the core, APEX prepared a core handling, logging and 
sampling procedures protocol. This protocol outlined detailed instructions on the 
procedures used during the testing and data gathering process. These guidelines were 
adhered to by APEX geologist and geotechnical staff, ensuring accuracy and uniformity 
in data gathering during the program and provide an independent methodology for 
future work on the project. The verification procedure applied by the QP ensured that 
the logging, sampling and chain of custody procedures were documented in 
accordance to this protocol.  

Determination of the chemical and physical characteristics of an industrial mineral 
often involves procedures and tests that are not part of the normal activity of an 
analytical laboratory. In order to conduct the proper tests on the Richardson Property 
drill cores, Mr. Eccles determined the appropriate physical and chemical analytical 
work that was relevant to the identification of the properties of interest in the intended 
application. The objective of the analytical test work – in the context of this crush rock 
aggregate resource estimate – was predominantly focused on the aggregate 
mechanical qualities for its use in aggregate road building and concrete. Mr. Eccles 
also ensured that the selected laboratories had the requisite experience and necessary 
equipment to conduct the required tests.  

The sampling and test work processes employed during the 2013 and 2014 drill 
core sampling programs, meet industry standards for accuracy and reliability, and in 
the opinion of the authors of this Technical Report, are sufficiently accurate and precise 
for use in the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate.  

Many industrial minerals deposits are subject to a nugget effect. Within the context 
of the Richardson crushed rock aggregate deposit, a sufficient and appropriate number 
of samples were analyzed to ensure that meaningful average sample results were 
obtained. The Winnipegosis Formation dolostone has a demonstrated physical and 
chemical homogeneity. The one impurity to report is bitumen, which ranges in intensity 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta 

October 24, 2019           79 
 
 

from non-existent (in most of the core) to pervasive, the latter of which is evident in 25 
cm to 90 cm wide 'bituminous horizons' that occur in the eastern drillholes 14RLD006 
and 14RLD008. However, the overall consistency of non-bitumen-bearing dolostone 
provide justification that bitumen does not influence the viability of the Winnipegosis as 
an industrial mineral, at least in the evaluation of this early stage project.   

With respect to analytical precision, the physical test work techniques and 
composite sampling methodology that were adopted to characterize the strength 
characteristics of the dolostone and granite make it difficult to quantify precision in 
comparison to standard chemical analyses. Slight variations in the quality 
assurance/quality control measures are documented in the three measures discussed 
in the previous text. These discrepancies were expected as they represent variations 
between laboratory procedures (aggregate test work at two separate laboratories) or 
analytical techniques (XRF versus laboratory geochemical analysis and SG 
geotechnical measurements versus laboratory density measurements) more than 
within the core itself. Importantly, this work has shown that the assay preparation and 
analytical processes produced valid results. Hence, no inconsistencies were observed 
between the datasets by the QP providing confidence to the stratigraphic continuity of 
the dolostone unit and the 3-D model used in the estimation process. 

To conclude, the senior author has reviewed all geotechnical and geochemical 
data and found no significant issues or inconsistencies that would cause one to 
question the validity of the data. Hardcopy and electronic reviews by the QP confirmed 
the data were generated with proper procedures, has been accurately transcribed form 
the original source and is suitable for use in this Technical Report. The drill program, 
which was managed by APEX, and QA-QC testing conducted by the QP also 
increased the confidence level of the dataset. 

With respect to verification limitations, the analytical test work protocol outlined in 
this Technical Report (summarized in Table 9) did not include standard blank samples, 
certified standards or duplicates samples. The authors justified this as the aggregate 
test work is a determination of the rock character rather than identifying a single 
elemental concentration toward resource evaluation. In addition, the geochemical data 
do not form part of this resource work; rather the geochemical analysis were 
implemented to see if there is any potential for metallic mineral studies at the 
Richardson Property.  

To conclude and in the opinion of the QP, Mr. Eccles, P. Geol. is satisfied to 
include these data in resource modelling, evaluation and estimations as part of 
Richardson resource estimate presented in this Technical Report.  

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The objective of the aggregate analytical test work was focused on the aggregate 
mechanical qualities for its use in aggregate road building and concrete. Geochemical 
analyses were also performed to make inferences on the potential hindrances to rock 
strength (e.g., modal clay abundance through elements like Al). A secondary 
component of the geochemical work was to test whether the basement granite rocks 
contain REE and/or precious- and base-metal potential. 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta 

October 24, 2019           80 
 
 

Geotechnical measurements, aggregate test work laboratory certificates and 
geochemical laboratory certificates are available as described in Appendix 1. The 
following Mineral Processing Section describes the aggregate test work results, 
followed by the geochemical results. The geotechnical and geochemical data are also 
discussed briefly in the Resource Section (see Section 14.7, Demonstration of 
Stratigraphic Homogeneity).  

13.1 Aggregate Test Work Results 

13.1.1 Introduction 

The results of the aggregate test work for 14 composite samples are presented in 
their entirety in Table 13. These data include aggregate test results for:  

• Winnipegosis samples (10 samples from each drillhole that were analyzed at 
AMEC, and one duplicate sample from drillhole GNA-10 that was analyzed at 
Tetra Tech EBA; n=11 total samples);  
 

• One Contact Rapids sample and two Precambrian basement granite samples.  

Published specifications and standards for any industrial mineral project should be 
used primarily as a screening mechanism to establish the marketability of an industrial 
mineral. The ultimate suitability of an industrial mineral for use in specific applications 
can only be determined through detailed market investigations and discussions with 
potential product users. To evaluate the suitability of Winnipegosis, Contact Rapids 
and Precambrian basement granite samples from the Richardson Property, we have 
made comparisons with Alberta Transportation (their Table 3.2.3.2C) and CSA (their 
Table 12) screening criteria as summarized in Table 13 and in the following text. 

13.1.2 Aggregate Test Work Processing Note 

Not all of the aggregate test methods that are outlined in Alberta Transportation's 
Table 3.2.3.2A and CSA's Table 12 were performed on the Richardson Property core 
samples. That is, several analytical methods were not recommended by AMEC – at 
this particular phase of evaluating an early stage crush rock aggregate project – 
including: sieve analysis; flat and elongated; flakiness index; and material finer than 80 
µm test methods. To conduct these test methods, a preliminary crush of the drill core is 
required; however, there are drawbacks associated with this type of pre-processing in 
that any preliminary crush down could not replicate a typical crushing process in the 
field and would therefore produce test results that are different from that of the field. It 
is important to point out that the test methods adopted in this Technical Report (see 
Tables 9 and 13) do provide a good indication of the quality of the material. The only 
difference is that the composite Winnipegosis, Contact Rapids and Precambrian 
basement granite samples that were sent to AMEC were not tested by individual sieve 
sizes of material (due to AMEC's pre-crush cautioning). Hence, the testing should be 
viewed as a general aggregate testing, as opposed to fine- or coarse-aggregate 
testing. In accordance with discussions with AMEC, and in review other crush rock 
aggregate NI 43-101 Technical Reports, the authors of this report acknowledge that 
the test results obtained are valid and applicable to assessing the Richardson crush 
rock aggregate potential and to stating a maiden inferred resource estimate.

   Published specif ications and standards for industrial mineral should be used primarliy as a screeing mechanism to establish the marketability of an industrial mineral. The ultimate suitability of an

          industrial mineral for use in specif ic applications can only be determined through detailed market investigations and discussions w ith potential product users and customers (source: Alberta Transportation,

          Table 3.2.3.2C; CSA, Table 12). Also see the text as some aggregate designations have a range of maximum allow able standards.

13.1.3 Los Angeles Abrasion Test 

A common test used to characterize toughness and abrasion resistance is the Los 
Angeles (L.A.) abrasion test.  In Alberta, the maximum abrasion loss value for:  

• Designation 1 (asphalt concrete pavement) aggregate is 40%; 
 

• Designation 2 (base course aggregate) aggregate is 50%;  
 

• Designation 3 (seal coat aggregate) is 35%; and 
 

• Designation 4 (gravel surfacing aggregate) does not have a maximum 
permissible abrasion loss value (Alberta Transportation, 2007, 2010).  

Sample testing was in accordance with CSA A23.2-17A (ASTM C535). Preparation 
consisted of sieving the sample, which produced nearly identical weights for sieve 
fractions: -50 mm to +37.5 mm and -37.5 mm to +25 mm, followed by placing the 
fractions in a cylindrical mill with twelve spheres at 1,000 revolutions.  

All Winnipegosis and Precambrian basement granite composite samples analyzed 
as part of this Technical Report yielded L.A. Abrasion values that were <29%. The 
Winnipegosis and granite samples yielded L.A. Abrasion ranging between 18.8% and 
29.1% (averaging 24.32%; n=11), and 17.7% to 18.8% (averaging 18.25%; n=2), 
respectively (Table 13; Figure 26). These values exceed the maximum abrasion loss 
value within Alberta Transportations designations 1 through 4.

basement granite samples from the Richardson Property.

The Winnipegosis results fit within the typical L.A. Abrasion loss values for 
dolomite (18%-30%), but the granite samples are significantly lower than the typical 
L.A. Abrasion loss values for granite (27%-49%; Roberts et al., 1996). One sample 
from the Contact Rapids Formation had an L.A. Abrasion of 43.4%, which represents 
the highest abrasion value in this dataset and the only value with abrasion loss of 
>29%.   

13.1.4 Plasticity Index Test 

In Alberta, the maximum permissible plasticity index classification for:  

• Designation 1 (asphalt concrete pavement) is "non-plastic"; 
 

• Designation 2 (base course aggregate) is "non-plastic" to "non-plastic-6";  
 

• Designation 3 (seal coat aggregate) is "non-plastic-4"; and 
 

• Designation 4 (gravel surfacing aggregate) is "non-plastic-8" (Alberta 
Transportation, 2007, 2010).  

Sample testing was in accordance with ASTM D4318 – dry method. The plasticity 
index from all 14 samples tested, regardless of formation, was classified as zero, or 
"non-plastic" (Table 13). An example of the plasticity index for the Winnipegosis 
Formation from drillhole GNA-10 is shown in Figure 27.

Plasticity chart of U.S.B.R (1974). All samples analyzed were classified as non-plastic.

13.1.5 MgSO4 Soundness Loss Test 

Sulphate soundness testing was performed on coarse aggregate specimens (split 
into 80-40 mm and 40-20 mm fractions) in accordance with CSA A23.2-9A (ASTM 
C88). As per CSA A23.1, the maximum allowable MgSO4 Soundness Loss is 12% for 
coarse aggregate exposed to freeze-thaw. 

The majority of the Winnipegosis composite samples yielded an MgSO4 
Soundness Loss of 12.1% or less (n=9 of 11 samples; Table 13; Figure 28). Two 
Winnipegosis composite samples from drillhole 14RLD003 and 14RLD008 yielded 
MgSO4 Soundness Loss of 17.7% and 17.6%, respectively, which are above the 
maximum allowable MgSO4 Soundness Loss for coarse aggregate. The overall 
average MgSO4 Soundness Loss for the Winnipegosis is 8.2% (n=11 samples). Two 
composite Precambrian basement granite samples yielded low MgSO4 Soundness 
Loss of 9.0% and 10.8%. The Contact Rapids composite sample has an MgSO4 
Soundness Loss of 82%, which is significantly above the maximum allowable standard 
MgSO4 Soundness Loss.

13.1.6 Unconfined Freeze-Thaw Test 

In accordance with CSA A23.1, the maximum allowable unconfined freeze-thaw for 
coarse aggregate is 6%. Two composite Winnipegosis samples from drillhole 
14RLD002 and 14RLD007 yielded unconfined freeze-thaw results of 0.19% and 
0.21%, respectively, which are significantly below the maximum allowable unconfined 
freeze-thaw for coarse aggregate (Table 13).  

 

13.1.7 Sieve Analysis 

A single composite Winnipegosis sample from drillhole GNA-10 was subject to 
sieve analysis. The sieve test was done on the duplicate sample at Tetra Tech EBA. At 
Tetra Tech EBA, the sample was preliminary crushed to the -25 mm fraction prior to 
sieve analysis, the result of which is shown in Figure 29. Sieve analysis was not 
conducted at AMEC because the material was submitted as drill core and not as 
processed material (sees Section 13.1.2, Aggregate Test Work Processing Note).

13.2 Geochemical Results 

The objective of the aggregate analytical test work – in the context of this crush 
rock aggregate resource estimate – was predominantly focused on the aggregate 
mechanical qualities for its use in aggregate road building and concrete. Elements that 
are typically elevated in marine sedimentary rocks (i.e., clay and/or mudstone), which 
can be detrimental to the overall strength capacity of a crush rock unit, are extremely 
low in the Winnipegosis Formation dolostone. For example, average Al2O3, Na2O and 
K2O (n=40 analyses) are 0.4 %, 0.1% and 0.1%, respectively (Table 14; Appendix 2a).

With respect to the Precambrian basement granite, the geochemical summary 
statistics of 83 granite core samples is presented in Table 15 (complete analytical 
results are presented in Appendix 2b). As suspected, the granite is dominated by silica 
(SiO2 averaging 67% and up to 77%), which is favourable for the overall strength 
capacity of the rock type and subsequently, for crush rock aggregate.  

Table 15. Summary statistics of major element geochemical results for the Precambrian basement granite 
from the Richardson Property.  

 

 

A secondary component of the geochemical work was to test whether the 
dolostone and basement granite rocks contain metallic mineral potential, such as Pb-
Zn mineralization in the dolomite, and/or precious- and base-metal potential, and rare-
earth element (REE) in the granite. Histograms of selected metallic elements from the 
Winnipegosis and basement granite are presented in Figure 30. Spider diagrams, 
which normalize the Winnipegosis and basement granite with upper continental crustal 
rocks and post Archean Australian shale (PAAS; Taylor and McLennan, 1985), are 
presented in Figure 31.  

The geochemical results show that the Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian 
basement granite has generally poor metallic mineral potential. Three samples from 
drillhole 14RLD005 yield elevated REE relative to this data set. For example, a section 
of core from 113-117 m depth has elevated lanthanum (208-371 ppm) and cerium 
(422-795 ppm). In addition, core from 14RLD005 also yield elevated thorium (167-233 
ppm) relative to this dataset at 108-115 m depth. Drillhole 14RLD007 yielded the 
highest metallic mineral results; for example, an intersection of core from 143-147 m 
depth contains the highest concentrations of Ni (26-31 ppm), Co (11-22 ppm) and V 
(127-148 ppm) in this dataset.  

An important observation is the homogeneous nature of the geochemical data for 
the Winnipegosis and granite rock units. The data are remarkable uniform, particularly 
for the Winnipegosis dolostone (Figure 31), which bodes well for the crush rock 
aggregate potential and for the geochemical validation of conducting a resource 
estimate on these rock units. The granite rock REE distribution pattern (Figure 31) 
shows that some fractionation and/or differentiation has occurred with the core 
samples analysed (as evidenced by the spread out, but parallel distribution of the 
REE), but this patter is not atypical of basement granite and may not influence its crush 
rock aggregate potential. Lastly, it should be noted that the rock units contain low 
uranium, which is also important for a potential crush rock aggregate source.

13.3 Summary of Test Work Results 

Published specifications and standards for industrial minerals should be used 
primarily as a screening mechanism to establish the marketability of an industrial 
mineral. The suitability of an industrial mineral for use in specific applications can only 
be determined through detailed market investigations and discussions with potential 
consumers. 

While detailed market investigations and discussions with potential consumers are 
beyond the scope of this Technical Report, we have demonstrated that the 
Winnipegosis and basement granite rock types have uniform compositions, and that 
the aggregate test work for the 11 Winnipegosis samples and two Precambrian 
basement granite samples meets the screening criteria for most of the aggregate 
designations in Alberta, including asphalt concrete pavement and base course 
aggregate, as per the guidelines set by Alberta Transportation and the Canadian 
Standards Association (see Tables 9, 10 and 13).  

Accordingly, with respect to reporting a resource estimate and abiding by the 
General Guidelines of NI 43-101, it should be emphasized that the aggregate test rock 
results suggest that the Winnipegosis Formation (and secondly, the Precambrian 
basement granite) from the Richardson crushed rock aggregate deposit has 
reasonable prospects of economic viability for an industrial mineral deposit. 
 

In contrast, the single Contact Rapids sample does not meet the screening criteria, 
and therefore, does not meet the reasonable expectation and/or demonstration of 
economic viability of an industrial mineral deposit.  

14 Mineral Resource Estimate 

14.1 Introduction 

Modelling, resource estimation and statistics were performed by Mr. Nicholls, 
MAIG under the direct supervision of Mr. Eccles, who is a Qualified Persons as defined 
by National Instrument 43-101. Mineral resource modelling was carried out using a 
three-dimensional model in commercial geologic modelling and mine planning software 
MICROMINE (v14.0.4).  

 
The project area is based in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate 

system, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 and UTM Zone12. No block modelling of 
the resource area was necessary as no 'grade' was being estimated; instead a three-
dimensional computer generated 'solid' of the area was generated in MICROMINE to 
calculate the resource 'volume'. The resource estimation presented in this Technical 
Report considered data from eight drillholes drilled by Athabasca Minerals in 2014 and 
four drillholes drilled by Athabasca Minerals in 2013 (twelve total drillholes). Because 
two of the 2013 drillholes were terminated at <30 m and therefore did not penetrate, or 
did not penetrate through the entire section of, the Winnipegosis Formation (the 
uppermost bedrock and primary focus of this resource estimate), only ten drillholes 
were utilized in the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource 
modelling that is presented in this Technical Report. Accordingly, this resource section 
hereafter refers to ten drillholes.

October 24, 2019           91 
 
 

Mr. Eccles P. Geol supervised APEX geologists in the 2014 drill campaign along 
with logging and sampling of both the 2013 and 2014 drill core. Specific gravity and 
geologic information are derived from work conducted by APEX personnel, on behalf of 
Athabasca Minerals, during the 2014 field season. A specific gravity measurement was 
taken once every 1 metre of drill core. The density data were confirmed by comparing 
these measurements with a separate set of density analysis on the composite samples 
that were analyzed at AMEC and Tetra Tech EBA in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, 
respectively.  

 
Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate is reported in 

accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 
and has been estimated using the CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 23rd, 2003 and CIM "Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" adopted May 10, 2014. 
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be 
converted into a mineral reserve.  

 
The CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, Definitions and 

Guidelines, dated August 20, 2000 (the "CIM Standards", NI 43-101 and Companion 
Policy 43-101CP) states that:  

 
"When reporting Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates 

relating to an industrial mineral site, the Qualified Person(s) must make the 
reader aware of certain special properties of these commodities".  

 
The authors have attempted to follow this guideline in this resource section and 

throughout this Technical Report. Accordingly, an important up-front statement is to 
acknowledge that the objective of the aggregate analytical test work – in the context of 
this crush rock aggregate resource estimate – is predominantly focused on the 
aggregate mechanical qualities for its use in aggregate road building and concrete in 
support of locale and prolific oil sands operations and development. The reader is 
invited to view Figure 4 and Section 16, Other Relevant Data and Information, for a 
synopsis of the significance of the oil sands industry, its developing infrastructure and 
its limited aggregate resources.  

14.2 Drillhole Database Validation 

The 2013 and 2014 drillholes were surveyed using a hand-held Garmin GPS unit in 
UTM coordinates (UTM Zone 12) and NAD 1983 datum. The elevations of the 
drillholes were initially obtained using the hand-held Garmin GPS, however, the collar 
elevations have been subsequently modified for all 10 drillholes by using high 
resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDar) technology with 1 m resolution. All 
drillholes were vertical holes; no down hole surveying was employed. Upon completion 
of each of the 2014 drillholes, the casing was removed, and the drill sites were 
reclaimed, and no visible collar marker was left.  

 
All drill logs, summaries, survey data and analytical results from the 2013 and 2014 

programs have been imported and stored in a MICROMINE drilling database and in 



National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Richardson Property, Northeast Alberta 

October 24, 2019           92 
 
 

Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Drill core logging was completed in Excel format, with 
hardcopy, PDF and digital back-ups. Drill data, cross sections and 3D plots were 
interpreted and generated in Edmonton using, Excel and MICROMINE software. The 
2013 and 2014 drill core were logged and sampled by APEX personnel under the 
direct supervision of Mr. Eccles. 

 
At the end of the 2014 program, the excel drillhole database was copied into 

MICROMINE by APEX personnel. Using MICROMINE's drillhole database validation 
function, the data was checked for overlapping geological intervals, and survey, collar 
and drillhole length data. A few minor discrepancies were found and promptly fixed 
within the database. All 10 drillholes were manually checked and validated for collar, 
survey, and lithological boundaries data. Collar data was compared back to values on 
the original drill logs. Lithology codes were compared to original drill logs and assay 
results were compared to laboratory certificates. The database is considered reliable 
for mineral resource estimation purposes. 

14.3 Micromine Database 

The drilling database used is still current. The drillhole database was validated 
within MICROMINE and no errors were identified. The database incorporates all 
available diamond drilling and analytical data. All data for the mineral resource 
estimation was copied from Excel into MICROMINE format.  

 
The five MICROMINE.DAT files that were utilized in the resource estimations, 

these include: 
 

• Richardson_collars_all – the drillhole collar file; 
 

• XRF – the portable x-ray fluorescence data; 
 

• Density – the density measurements file; 
 

• 2014_lithos_final – the geology and formation information; and 
 

• LiDar 15m– the surface topography. 
 
There was a total of 10 drillholes within the export that guided the geological 

interpretation of the aggregate resource. Spacing between drillholes varies from 500 m 
to 1.37 km, with an average of about 0.9 km between drillholes. There were seven drill 
lines that ranged in spacing from 570 m to 900 m. In this Technical Report, Mr. 
Nicholls, under the direct supervision of Mr. Eccles, has used reasonable judgment in 
the context of this crushed rock aggregate deposit type, style and formation to 
determine that this drill spacing is sufficient for resource volume estimation. 

 
Data supplied and utilized in MICROMINE included collar Easting, Northing and 

elevation coordinates, lithology information, and bulk density data. The collar co-
ordinates were obtained by hand held GPS and the relative elevation were assigned 
using the detailed one-metre spaced LiDar data. All drillholes are short (up to 147 m)

vertical holes and as such there are no down hole surveys. Dip of the hole was set up 
using a clinometer after the drill was properly levelled.  

14.4 Data Type Comparison 

As there has only been diamond drilling conducted at the Richardson maiden 
inferred crush rock aggregate resource area, a data type comparison is not required. 
Diamond drilling is considered to be representative of a good quality drilling method 
and is suitable for resource estimation.  

14.5 Quality Control 

The drillhole campaign data collected during the 2013 and 2014 drilling programs 
were checked for veracity, then were entered into MICROMINE and validated using the 
MICROMINE's drillhole validation tools. The upper and lower boundaries of the 
Winnipegosis Formation, Contact Rapids Formation, La Loche Formation and the 
Precambrian basement granite have been identified in core and these boundaries were 
confirmed using trace element geochemical measurements from a portable XRF. For 
example, Figure 32 shows that even though the Winnipegosis Formation contains 
several texturally distinct units (via logging), the major element geochemistry of the 
Winnipegosis is fairly consistent and distinct from the other geological units.  

 
This data shows the homogeneity of the individual units, and with respect to the 

Winnipegosis Formation, show that dolomitization of the unit was pervasive. In 
addition, the low Al content of the Winnipegosis Formation (<3.5 wt. %; Figure 32) is 
indicative of a low mud and clay component, which is a favourable indication in terms 
of the strength and quality of the dolostone as an aggregate material.  

 
The XRF data shows that geochemical data can be utilized to distinguish between 

the various lithological formations that are present at the Richardson Property. Based 
on the bivariate plots of selected elements (Mg, Ca, Al and Fe) versus depth, the 
representative geochemical groupings for the Winnipegosis, Contact Rapids and the 
La Loche formations, and the Precambrian basement granite, are respectively 
homogeneous and clearly differentiate the four respective rock types (Figure 32). For 
example, the Winnipegosis Formation has consistently higher Mg and Ca than the 
basement granite; the Contract Rapids and La Loche formations, which typically 
represent transitional rock types between the dolostone and basement, plot between 
the Winnipegosis Formation and the basement granite.  

 
These XRF measurements and subsequent geochemical confirmation of the rock 

units provides an additional level of quality control in the division of samples. This 
observation is an added benefit of non-destructive semi-quantitative XRF analysis 
because it was not possible, or necessary, to apply 'conventional' QAQC geochemical 
test methods, standards and blanks due to the type of applicable test work required for 
an industrial mineral resource.

14.6 Stratigraphic Representation and Resource Estimate Objectives by Formation  

The drillhole lithology was plotted and displayed next to the drillhole (Figure 33a). 
From the top of the drillhole to the base, this includes: Quaternary surficial deposits (or 
overburden); Winnipegosis Formation; Contact Rapids Formation; La Loche Formation; 
and the Precambrian basement granite. The formations are described in detail in 
Section 7, Geological Setting and Mineralization.  

 
The Winnipegosis Formation is the primary unit being assessed in this Richardson 

maiden inferred crushed rock aggregate resource estimate. Athabasca Minerals is also 
interested in the potential of the granite as a crushed rock aggregate and we have 
therefore included a volume estimate of the granite albeit to a depth of 10 m below the 
top of the Precambrian to correlate with drill results. In aggregate operations, different 
kinds of 'Flux' are often required for blending purposes, as a result of this it was 
decided to model up all formations to provide blending option volumes of the other 
formations beside the Winnipegosis Formation.  

14.7 Demonstration of Stratigraphic Homogeneity 

Stratigraphic logging, which was performed by APEX for both the 2013 and 2014 
drillholes, showed definitive geological boundaries that are characterized by extensive 
lateral continuity of the individual geounits. With the exception of the La Loche 
Formation – Precambrian basement boundary which can be gradational, the 
boundaries between formations have sharp, visually identifiable contacts.  

 
To demonstrate the homogeneity of the stratigraphic units using geotechnical and 

geochemical data derived from the cores, Figures 33 and 34 show a comparison 
between the stratigraphic horizons versus selected geotechnical and geochemical 
data, respectively. The Rock Quality Description (RDQ) and total fracture data closely 
mimic the stratigraphic units (Figure 33). This is particularly evident for drillhole 14RLD-
007 because this hole cored the deepest into the Precambrian basement granite. Of 
particular note, the RDQ and total fracture scores are most evident in the Contact 
Rapids and La Loche formations, which occur between the more competent 
Winnipegosis Formation dolostone and Precambrian basement granite. In comparison 
to the majority of the drillholes, the RDQ and total fractures scores are higher in the 
Precambrian basement granite in drillholes 14RDL-001; this is representative of a 
transitional zone between the La Loche Formation and the underlying basement 
granite, the latter of which, is characterized by variable potassic and albite alteration at 
this local area.  

 
The stratigraphic formation divisions are further supported by chemical 

homogeneity, which is illustrated by plotting the one-metre interval XRF data next to 
the stratigraphic units (Figure 34). In conjunction with the stratigraphic cross-section, 
the 'zones' of elevated or depleted Ca+Mg (Figure 34b) or Fe (Figure 34c) closely 
mimic the geological formations (Figure 34a). In addition, the Ca+Mg plot, in particular, 
shows the homogeneous nature of the Winnipegosis Formation, which highlights its 
applicability as a potential source of crush rock aggregate.

14.8 Lithological Model Design and Interpretation 

As a result of the homogeneous and continuous nature of the stratigraphic 
formations, the wireframes were constructed and extrapolated from hole to hole for the 
10 drillholes that were used in this resource model. A resource outline of 500 m was 
constructed around the outermost drillholes to define the outer limits of the resource 
area (Figure 35).  

 
The resource outline of 500 m was deemed appropriate based on the continuous 

nature of the stratigraphic formation within the resource outline area as defined by 
2013 and 2014 Athabasca Minerals drilling, and because the same generally flat-lying 
stratigraphic formations has been intersected in drillholes and/or oil and gas wells that 
are located several 10's of kilometres away from the Richardson resource area 
providing further support of the continuous nature of these geological formations. The 
boundary outline radius directly north of drillholes GNA-10 and 14RDL-008 was 
reduced to 50 m (from 500 m) due to the proximity of the lake. I.e., we have not 
extended the inferred resource estimate under the lake. The surface area of the 
resource outline is 6.30 km2.  

 
A separate wireframe was created for each formation from which, separate 

formation volumes could be derived. The 500 m resource outline was used to clip the 
individual formation wireframes to restrict the lateral extension of the wireframes and 
thereby constrict the main resource model to the general 2013 and 2014 Athabasca 
Minerals drill area. The one-metre LiDar surface topography was reduced to a 15 m 
survey due to file size constraints within MICROMINE; this surface was then used to 
clip the overlying overburden wireframe with the best approximation of surface.  

 
This model formed the spatial basis for calculating the volume and tonnage for the 

Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate.  
 
Eight out of the 10 drillholes used in the resource modelling intersected the 

basement granite. The remaining two drillholes (GNA-16 and 14RLD-006) stopped 
short of penetrating and coring the basement due to drilling conditions. Given, the 
stratigraphic continuity of the Winnipegosis dolostone, which was intersected in these 
drillholes, and the continuity of the basement granite in the resource area, the top of 
basement wireframe was extrapolated to include these two holes.

Figure 35. The 500 m resource boundary outline that was used to constrain the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate. The 
figure also shows the Eccles et al. (2015) resource area is entirely within the 2019 revised Richardson Property lease boundary, the leases of which were 
converted from mineral permits in January 2019.  



 

 

The overall modeling of the basement granite was restricted to a 10 m thick unit 
across the entire resource area. The 10 m thickness is considered to provide a 
conservative estimate because the granite was confirmed to extend to depth in a single 
drillhole (14RLD-007), which cored up to 48.35 m of basement granite. However, all 
other drillholes were terminated once they cored approximately 10 m into the basement 
granite as this drill program (and in this particular part of Athabasca Minerals 
Richardson Property) placed emphasis on the Winnipegosis Formation. 

14.9 Density Results 

A total of 675 bulk density measurements were collected from drill core within the 
Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource area. The measurements 
were conducted directly on drill core sample using the "hydrostatic" method, which 
involves weighing the item in air and then again while it is fully submerged in water. 
Density measurements were collected once every metre of drill core and were 
separated by formation to calculate an average bulk density for the resource area. The 
density values used in the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource 
estimate are shown in Table 16.  

 
The density samples were collected during core geotechnical, logging and 

sampling work on eight drillholes drilled in 2014 and two drillholes completed in 2013. 
All of these holes are situated within the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock 
aggregate resources area. Samples were collected every metre where possible down 
the drill hole. The specific gravity calculation was performed using the weight in 
air/weight in water emulsion methodology.  
 
Table 16. Average bulk density values that were used in the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock 
aggregate resource estimate.  

Formation

Contact Rapids 90 2.50 0.006 

La Loche 19 2.54 0.004 

Basement granite 152 2.63 0.005 

 

The density measurements were examined in relation to the formation in which the 
sample measurement was situated within. As such all density samples were tagged 
with the formation name, in order to examine and assign a nominal density for each 
stratigraphic unit. Statistical analysis was performed on each of the stratigraphic unit 
density datasets in order to asses any potential outliers and to examine the variance of 
the samples. No outliers were identified, and the variance of the density samples was 
very small. The small variance in the density samples is to be expected from the 
uniform and stratigraphically continuous nature of the geological formations. 

 



 

 

It should be noted that the assigned density for the overburden/overlying till of 2.25 
t/m3 was calculated using only 19 samples. This was due to the fact that limited 
overburden drill core was available for sampling due to the fact that the majority of the 
overburden was in drill casing. Given this the calculated density of 2.25 t/m3 is 
considered appropriate and reasonable for the use in the Richardson maiden inferred 
crush rock aggregate resource estimate. 

 
Density measurements (n=14) were also performed as part of aggregate test work 

at AMEC (n=13) with one duplicate sample being analyzed at Tetra Tech EBA. The 
average bulk relative density, saturated surface dry (SSD) relative density and 
apparent relative density of 11 Winnipegosis Formation samples yielded 2.65, 2.70 and 
2.80, respectively. The bulk relative density, SSD relative density and apparent relative 
density of one Contact Rapids sample yielded 2.49, 2.59 and 2.76, respectively. The 
average bulk relative density, SSD relative density and apparent relative density of two 
basement granite samples yielded 2.68, 2.69 and 2.70, respectively. The comparison 
between the hydrostatic density measurements, which were taken during core logging 
and the aggregate test work results are similar. Hence, the hydrostatic method-based 
density values of 2.68, 2.50 and 2.63 for the Winnipegosis, Contact Rapids and 
basement granite, which were used in this Technical Report, are considered realistic 
and a conservative density value for resource estimation.  

14.10   Resource Calculation 

The volume of the Winnipegosis Formation was calculated from 3-dimmenional 
modelling that utilised the commercial mine planning software MICROMINE. In addition 
to the Winnipegosis Formation volume, the separate wireframes and density values for 
each of the sub-surface formations facilitated the calculation of volumes for the 
overburden, Contract Rapids, La Loche and Precambrian basement granite.  

 
The specifics of the three-dimensional modelling is described in section 14.8. 

There was no need to create a block model as no specific chemical elements were 
being estimated. As such the volume of each formation was used to multiply against a 
nominal specific gravity value, which was determined on a formation by formation 
basis. This resulted in the reported tonnages. As this is the maiden inferred resource, 
no mining studies have yet been employed to constrain the resource within an optimal 
pit shell. This work is recommended for future resource studies.  

 
The Winnipegosis Formation is considered the most favourable unit for crush rock 

aggregate as it is the shallowest (directly underlying the quaternary cover) at depths 
ranging from 18 m to 64.92 m – in this particular part of the Richardson Property. This 
unit has undergone pervasive dolomitization; the higher magnesium content makes the 
unit harder and thus more resistive in consideration of crush rock aggregate.  

 
Underlying the Winnipegosis Formation, the Contact Rapids is mudstone-enriched 

(higher aluminum content), is more lime in nature and comprises weakly consolidated 
muddy limestone and sandy limestone in comparison to the Winnipegosis dolostone. 
The Contact Rapids is therefore not nearly as desirable as a crush rock aggregate 
source in comparison to the Winnipegosis. There is the possibility, however, that the 
Contract Rapids may provide some alternative flux material if the Winnipegosis were to 



 

 

be mined as a crush rock aggregate source. There is a distinct unconformity between 
the carbonate units, which is therefore easy to separate if the deposit undergoes 
mining. 

 
If the economics of mining the Winnipegosis Formation are feasible, then the 

Precambrian basement granite represents a secondary crush rock aggregate target 
within the Richardson resource area due to the hardness and the uniform nature of the 
granite. 

14.11   Mineral Resource Marketability 

Industrial minerals are influenced by a number of factors that are less applicable to 
metallic mineral deposits such as: particular physical and chemical characteristics; 
mineral quality issues; market size; the level of the producer's technical applications 
knowledge; market concentration; and transportation costs. Market considerations 
must, therefore, incorporate not only the requirement for detailed market analyses 
and/or contracts of sale, but also recognition that markets for many industrial minerals 
are relatively small, may have a high degree of producer concentration, or may have 
very high technical barriers to entry, thus imposing limits or constraints on achievable 
market volumes. Accordingly, the reader must be made aware of any special 
properties related to the industry specifications.  

 
In the case of the Richardson project, the crush rock aggregate deposit is located 

in proximity to several major oil sands operations and operations in development (see 
Figure 4; the reader is also invited to review Section 16.1, Other Relevant Data and 
Information, for a synopsis of the significance of the oil sands industry, its developing 
infrastructure and its limited aggregate resources.). In light of the continued investment 
in the oil sands industry, it is possible that there is an ongoing requirement for 
aggregate throughout the region. In addition, the close proximity of the Winnipegosis 
Formation to surface, its overall uniformity, and positive aggregate test results in 
comparison to Alberta aggregate standards indicate that the Winnipegosis crushed 
rock aggregate has reasonable prospects of economic viability.  

 
It should be noted that no mining or detailed economic studies have been 

performed and that the Richardson crush rock aggregate deposits represents an early 
stage project. No aggregate price data were integrated into the resource estimate 
presented in this Technical Report. In a brief scan, crush aggregate product varies 
anywhere from CDN$9.00 per ton to CDN$27.00 per ton (e.g., Dufferin Aggregate, 
2014; Hammerstone Corporation, 2014; Jordan River Gravel and Excavating, 2014; 
Polaris Minerals Corporation, 2014). With respect to potential for economic extraction, 
Hammerstone is mining limestone at its Hammerstone Project, which is located 
adjacent to the southeastern Richardson Property (see Section 23, Adjacent 
Properties). Hence, it appears that the Richardson crush rock aggregate would support 
the cost of mining and the removal of the overburden.  

14.12   Reasonable Prospects 

The authors have demonstrated that the Winnipegosis and basement granite rock 
types have uniform compositions, and that the aggregate test work for the 11 
Winnipegosis samples and two Precambrian basement granite samples meets the 



 

 

screening criteria for most of the aggregate designations in Alberta, including asphalt 
concrete pavement and base course aggregate, as per the guidelines set by Alberta 
Transportation and the Canadian Standards Association.  

 
While detailed market investigations and discussions with potential consumers are 

beyond the scope of this inferred resource Technical Report, the Richardson Property 
crush rock aggregate deposit is located in proximity to several major oil sands 
operations that are both active and in development. Given the scale of the oil sands 
operations and international interest in extracting bitumen from the deposits, it is very 
possible that there is an ongoing requirement for aggregate throughout the region. 
Especially because aggregate surficial deposits are difficult to find throughout much of 
northern Alberta.   

 
In addition, the Winnipegosis Formation is near surface (18-65 m below surface; 

average 36 m), is stratigraphically uniform (thickness of 35-48 m; average 40 m) and 
yields positive aggregate test results in comparison to Alberta aggregate standards. 

 
Accordingly, with respect to reporting a resource estimate and abiding by the 

General Guidelines of NI 43-101, it should be emphasized that the aggregate test rock 
results, proximity to the oil sands operations and general characteristics and low strip 
ratio of the target unit suggest that the Winnipegosis Formation (and secondly, the 
Precambrian basement granite) from the Richardson crushed rock aggregate deposit 
has reasonable prospects of economic viability for an industrial mineral deposit. 

14.13   Resource Classification 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has been 
classified in accordance with guidelines established by the CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 23rd, 
2003 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" 
adopted May 10, 2014.  
 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has 
been classified as 'inferred' according to the CIM definition standards. The 
classification of the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource was 
based on geological confidence, data quality and stratigraphic continuity. That is, the 
criteria and rational for the classification of inferred resources was based upon the wide 
spaced nature of the drilling to date and the fact that this is classed as an early stage 
project.  

14.14   Mineral Resource Reporting 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate is 
reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators National 
Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using the CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 23rd, 
2003 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" 
adopted May 10, 2014.  

 



 

 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has been 
classified as inferred only. At this stage of resource classification, no cut-off value has 
been assigned as it is anticipated that the entire in-situ dolostone unit would be bulk-
mined. The aerial extent of the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate 
resource area is 6.30 km2. The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate 
resource consists of 683.14 million tonnes of aggregate material situated within the 
favourable Winnipegosis Formation (Table 17). The thickness of the Winnipegosis 
aggregate resource varies from 8.3 m to 47.9 m. The Winnipegosis aggregate resource 
is overlain by 497.29 million tonnes of overburden-waste material. Mineral resources 
are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral 
reserve.

Note 1:  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. 

Note 2:  The quantity of tonnes reported in these inferred resource estimations are 
uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these 
inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or 
measured resource category. 

 
The estimate of mineral resources presented in this Technical Report may be 

materially affected by geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
political, marketing or other relevant issues. Because the Richardson Property is in its 
preliminary exploration stages, specific detail on project's risks and uncertainties has 
yet to be fully investigated at this time.  As the Richardson Property advances toward 
an early stage conceptual assessment of potential economic viability of the mineral 
resources, future discussion on the significant risks, uncertainties and foreseeable 
impacts are required, including those risks to the project's potential economic viability.  

 



 

 

The quality and grade of reported Inferred resource in this estimation is uncertain 
in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources 
as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration 
will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured resource category. The 
portion of the Richardson property resource that has been classified as 'Inferred' 
demonstrates that the nature, quantity and distribution of data is such as to allow 
confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume 
continuity of geological formations. The collective work to date from the Richardson 
Property indicate that while the project is in early stages of exploration/resource work 
that indications of the metallurgical and mineral processing qualities give suggestions 
that they are of high enough quality that the Winnipegosis is a reasonable prospect for 
potential future economic extraction.  

 
If the economics of mining the Winnipegosis Formation are feasible, then the 

Precambrian basement granite represents a potential secondary crush rock aggregate 
target within the Richardson resource area due to its uniform nature and overall 
hardness as shown by the few (n=2) samples that were processed using standard 
aggregate test work. In the resource area, the basement granite has a volume of 
165.41 million tonnes; the overall volume of the granite was calculated to a maximum 
depth of ten metres from the top of the Precambrian rock unit. This hypothesis is 
conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient exploration to define the extended 
mineral deposit and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral deposit and/or resource. 

 
 

Athabasca Minerals Richardson Project is an Early Stage 
Exploration Project and therefore Items 15 to 22 of NI 43-101 Form 

are not required. 
 

23 Adjacent Properties 

Hammerstone Corporation owns Alberta Metallic and Industrial Mineral Permits and 
Leases that are located southeast of the Richardson Property (Figure 36). No 
exploration details are currently provided to make commodity predictions on these 
particular permits and leases. Hammerstone also owns the Hammerstone Project, 
which is located approximately 30 km to the southwest of the Richardson Property. The 
Hammerstone Project involves the expansion of the pre-existing Muskeg Valley Quarry 
(formerly owned by Birch Mountain Resources Ltd.), from 235 acres to 1,200 acres. 

Graymont Western Canada Inc. ("Graymont") owns the Alberta Metallic and 
Industrial Mineral Permits that are located in the middle of the Richardson Property 
(Figure 36). Graymont is a private corporation and the second largest lime producer in 
North America. The company focuses on producing high calcium and dolomitic lime, 
value-added lime-based products, pulverized limestone and construction stone. 
Graymont also provides construction materials such as sand, gravel, asphalt products, 
construction stone and ready-mix concrete. No exploration or operational details are 
publicly available regarding these Graymont's permits.

24 Other Relevant Data and Information 

24.1 Significance of the Oil Sands Industry and its Developing Infrastructure 

It is important to point out the significance of the oil sands industry and its 
ramifications on any supporting sources of construction product such as a crush rock 
aggregate material. The Conference Board of Canada estimates that, after adjusting 
for inflation, a cumulative $364 billion in 2010 dollars will be invested in the oil sands 
between 2012 and 2035 (Conference Board of Canada, 2012). This estimate includes 
new projects, expenditures on sustaining capital, and pipeline development. This 
statement should be taken at face value, however, because any kind of ongoing 
production level data associated with the oil sands are subject to an infinite number of 
variables such as geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, 
marketing or other relevant issues. Nevertheless, there are estimations that by 2035, 
oil sands bitumen production is projected to reach (5.1 million barrels/day), three times 
the production for 2010 (Energy Resources Conservation Board, 2011; National 
Energy Board, 2014). The majority of the growth is in the in-situ category, which tends 
to be smaller and less expensive to operate. About 80% of the oil sands reserves are 
considered well suited to in situ extraction.  

24.2 Limited Sources of Sand and Gravel Aggregate in the Fort McMurray Region 

With respect to aggregate sources, Government mapping and reporting has shown 
that sand and gravel deposits in the Fort McMurray area, and the Waterways (NTS 
74D) and Bitumount (NTS 74E) map sheets are distributed unevenly, of variable quality 
and quantity, and have largely been exploited (Scafe et al., 1988; Scafe and Edwards, 
2000a,b). These authors mapped small pockets of aggregate but noted that no major 
deposits are present and that any additional aggregate exploration in the region should 
focus on buried deposits, which show no surface expression and have not been 
detected by their or previous research programs.  

In a document prepared for the Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and 
Counties, the Got Gravel? Summary Report states that "the Lower Athabasca Region 
(i.e., the general Fort McMurray area) has the highest population of rural municipalities, 
escalating growth associated with oil sands development and the least amount of 
gravel availability in the province (Poscente and Kurjata, 2013)." These authors 
suggest that the Lower Athabasca Region is subject to a "looming aggregate shortfall" 
due to demands associated with: an expanding community infrastructure; ongoing oil 
sands and associated industrial development (e.g., upstream, midstream and 
downstream hydrocarbon sectors); and regional mega-projects such as the twinning of 
Highway 63, which connects Fort McMurray to the city of Edmonton.   

In summary, sand and gravel in the region is scarce and inadequate to meet most 
industrial windfalls let alone the prolific oil sands industry. Industrial Mineral companies 
are supplying gravel by importing gravel and other products or exploring opportunities 
to mine local underground rock crush aggregate for use as aggregate in the Fort 
McMurray region. Examples of the latter industrial mineral include open pit limestone 
deposit production by Hammerstone Corporation and Suncor Energy Inc., and the 
dolomite and Precambrian basement granite that are being assessed in this Technical 
Report. 



 

 

25 Interpretation and Conclusions 

A maiden inferred resource Technical Report was originally prepared by APEX 
Geoscience Ltd. (APEX) for Athabasca Minerals with an effective date of June 8, 2015 
(Eccles et al., 2015). Since then, Athabasca Minerals has not conducted any 
exploration activities and/or other work that is material to the issuer; however, 
Athabasca Minerals has been in consultations with the Government of Alberta with 
respect to the implementation of a new Provincial Park (the Kitaskino Nuwenëné 
Wildland Provincial Park) in the vicinity of the original Richardson Property permits.  

 
Accordingly, the purpose of this updated Technical Report is to: 1) state Athabasca 

Minerals revised Richardson Property land position; 2) state Athabasca Minerals 
conversion of mineral exploration 'permits' to mineral development 'leases'; and 3) 
show that the original inferred resource estimate prepared in June 2015 is still current 
with the resource area situated entirely within the boundaries of the new Property 
outline and leases. Hence, the change in land position and conversion of permits to 
leases represent the only material change to the issuer as documented in this updated 
and current Technical Report, which supersedes and replaces Eccles et al. (2015).  

25.1 Summary of the Richardson Maiden Inferred Crush Rock Aggregate Resource 
Estimate 

Industrial minerals are influenced by a number of factors that are less applicable to 
metallic mineral deposits such as: particular physical and chemical characteristics; 
mineral quality issues; market size; the level of the producer's technical applications 
knowledge; market concentration; and transportation costs. While the inclusion of a 
detailed market analyses is beyond the scope of this Technical Report, the reader 
should be made aware of several special factors that are related to this 'early stage 
project'. 

 
Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property comprises 3 contiguous Alberta Metallic 

and Industrial Minerals Leases totalling 3,904 hectares (9,647 acres). The Property is 
active, in good standing and 100% owned by Athabasca Minerals, who have—prior to 
the Richardson Property work outlined in this Technical Report—identified, explored 
and operated industrial mineral deposits in other parts of northeastern Alberta. With 
respect to aggregate marketing, technical applications knowledge and production 
experience, Athabasca Minerals is therefore assumed to have familiarity of the 
industrial mineral economics specific to the area.  

 
Proximity to market and market demand are also important industrial mineral 

factors. The Richardson Property is directly adjacent to the Athabasca oil Sands region 
of northeastern Alberta. The oil sands operations represent an area of enormous 
growth opportunity, and subsequently, require substantial sources of local aggregate. 
While continued oil sands development is subject to an infinite number of variables 
(e.g., geology, hydrocarbon prices, environment, taxation, socio-political, marketing or 
other relevant issues), the current development suggests a continued and positive 
aggregate market demand. Of equal note, sand and gravel aggregate in the oil sands 
region is scarce and inadequate to meet industrial demand. Consequently, alternative 
local sources such as crush rock aggregate are required to minimize common 



 

 

industrial mineral impediments such as transportation costs. Crush rock aggregate in 
the form of limestone is being mined adjacent to the Richardson Property region by 
Hammerstone Corporation exhibiting the potential demand for aggregate in the region.   
 

To assess the Richardson Property for its crush rock aggregate potential, APEX 
Geoscience Ltd. has reviewed, logged, measured, sampled and analyzed drill cores 
from a 2013 (4 holes totalling 235 m) and a 2014 (8 holes totalling 843 m) drilling 
programs, both of which were conducted by Athabasca Minerals. Two distinct 
geological units - the Winnipegosis Formation, which is the primary focus of this 
Technical Report, and the Precambrian basement granite – are identified in this 
Technical Report as having reasonable prospects of economic viability for an industrial 
mineral deposit. The thickness of the Winnipegosis varies from 8.3 m to 47.9 m 
(averages 39.5 m) and is comprised largely of competent, light brown dolostone. 
Precambrian basement granite was drill-tested to a depth of 10 m prior to terminating 
the drillholes, although a single drillhole (14RLD007) tested the granite to a coring 
depth of 44.5 m to test its uniformity and crush rock aggregate potential at depth. The 
granite is comprised light-blue grey coarse-grained weakly foliated granite. Based on 
the 2013 and 2014 drill results, Athabasca Minerals Inc. further commissioned APEX 
Geoscience Ltd. to prepare a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report 
and maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate of the Middle Devonian 
Winnipegosis Formation and make recommendations on future exploration to advance 
the Athabasca Minerals Richardson Property. 
 

A review of oil and gas well, historical mineral exploration and Athabasca Minerals 
2013 and 2014 drill program information, indicates that stratigraphic continuity of the 
Winnipegosis appears to extend over large distances in the Property area representing 
an apparently continuous target unit. Geotechnical measurements and geochemical 
analysis show that within the resource area, the Winnipegosis Formation is 
homogeneous, uniform and has undergone pervasive dolomitization attributing to its 
hardness, competency and resistive nature.  

 
The single 'impurity' to report involves supplementary bitumen, which is more or 

less confined to the uppermost portions of the Winnipegosis Formation (and the La 
Loche Formation directly overlying the Winnipegosis dolostone). The bitumen ranges in 
intensity from non-existent (in most of the core) to pervasive, the latter of which is 
evident in 25 cm to 90 cm wide 'bituminous horizons' that occur in the eastern drillholes 
14RLD006 and 14RLD008. The bitumen appears to be confined to porosity enabling 
textures in the carbonate such as vugs, sandy horizons and fracture planes. However, 
the overall consistency and volume of non-bitumen-bearing dolostone, and the positive 
aggregate test work results, provide justification that the bitumen does not influence the 
viability of the Winnipegosis as an industrial mineral deposit, at least in the evaluation 
of this early stage project. 

 
The Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian basement granite were analyzed 

using relevant aggregate analytical techniques, the results of which were compared to 
Alberta Transportation and Canadian Standards Association aggregate specifications 
and standards. The results show that the Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian 
basement granite met the maximum allowable screening criteria for major aggregate 



 

 

test methods, including: plasticity index; Los Angeles abrasion; magnesium sulphate 
soundness; and unconfined freeze-thaw. Based on the results of this test work and 
evidence of the homogeneity and uniformity of the rock units, it is concluded that the 
Winnipegosis Formation and Precambrian basement granite represent material of merit 
for several Alberta Transportation aggregate designations, including: Designation 1 
(asphalt concrete pavement); and Designation 2 (base course aggregate). 

 
The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate is 

reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators National 
Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using the CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines" dated November 23rd, 
2003 and CIM "Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" 
adopted May 10, 2014. The mineral resource modelling was carried out using a three-
dimensional model in commercial geological modelling and mine planning software 
MICROMINE (v.14.0.4).  
 

The resource estimation utilized data from two 2013 drillholes and eight 2014 
drillholes drilled by Athabasca Minerals (to drillholes in total). All drillholes were vertical 
holes and spacing between the drillholes varies from 500 m to 1.37 km, with an 
average of about 900 m between drillholes. A separate wireframe was created for each 
formation (Precambrian basement granite; La Loche Formation; Contact Rapids 
Formation; Winnipegosis Formation; and overburden), from which, separate formation 
volumes could be derived for each lithostratigraphic unit.  

 
Block modelling of the resource area was not necessary as no 'grade' was being 

estimated; instead a three-dimensional computer-generated 'solid' of the area was 
generated in MICROMINE to calculate the resource 'volume'. Within the model, the 
volume of each formation was used to multiply against a nominal density value, which 
was determined as averages on a formation by formation basis from the 675 bulk 
density measurements collected. This resulted in the reported tonnages. 
 

The surface area of the resource outline reported in this Technical Report is 6.30 
km2, representing a small north-central portion of Athabasca Minerals Richardson 
Property. The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has 
been classified as 'inferred' according to the CIM definition standards. The 
classification of the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource was 
based on geological confidence, data quality and stratigraphic continuity. That is, the 
criteria and rational for the classification of inferred resource is based upon the wide 
spaced nature of the drilling to date and the fact that the Richardson crush rock 
aggregate project is classified as an early stage project with little mineral processing 
test work completed to date. As this is the maiden inferred resource, no mining studies 
have been employed to constrain the resource within an optimal pit shell.  
 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has been 
classified as inferred only and consists of 683 million tonnes of aggregate material 
situated within the favourable Winnipegosis Formation (Table 18). Mineral resources 
are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral 



 

 

reserve. The Winnipegosis aggregate resource is directly overlain by 497 million 
tonnes of overburden-waste material.

Note 1:  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. 

Note 2:  The quantity of tonnes reported in these inferred resource estimations are 
uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these 
inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or 
measured resource category. 

 
 

25.2 Discussion of Risks and Uncertainties 

The exploration methodologies employed during the 2013 and 2014 drill programs 
meet industry standards for accuracy and reliability. Mr. Eccles, P. Geol, supervised 
the 2014 drill campaign along with logging and sampling of both the 2013 and 2014 
drill core. The sample collection and test work package has been designed and 
reviewed independently by R. Eccles, P. Geol. In addition, R. Eccles reviewed the 
results of analytical test work and verified that they are sufficiently accurate and 
precise. In the opinion of the R. Eccles, the methodologies of the exploration program 
and resulting data are sufficiently accurate and precise for use in the Richardson 
maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate. 

The Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource estimate has been 
classified as 'inferred' according to the CIM definition standards. The classification of 
the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock aggregate resource was based on 
geological confidence, data quality and stratigraphic continuity. That is, the criteria and 
rational for the classification of inferred resources was based upon the wide spaced 



 

 

nature of the drilling to date and the fact that this is classed as an early stage project 
with little mineral processing test work completed to date.  
 

The quality and grade of reported Inferred resource in this estimation is uncertain 
in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources 
as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration 
will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured resource category. The 
portion of the Richardson property resource that has been classified as 'Inferred' 
demonstrates that the nature, quantity and distribution of data is such as to allow 
confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume 
continuity of geological formations. The collective work to date from the Richardson 
Property indicate that while the project is in early stages of exploration/resource work 
that indications of the metallurgical and mineral processing qualities give suggestions 
that they are of high enough quality that the Winnipegosis is of economic interest. 

 
The estimate of mineral resources presented in this Technical Report may be 

materially affected by geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
political, marketing or other relevant issues. Because the Richardson Property is in its 
preliminary exploration stages, specific detail on project's risks and uncertainties has 
yet to be fully investigated at this time.  As the Richardson Property advances toward 
an early stage conceptual assessment of potential economic viability of the mineral 
resources, future discussion on the significant risks, cut-offs, uncertainties and 
foreseeable impacts are required, including those risks to the project's potential 
economic viability.  

25.3 Potential Targets for Future Exploration at the Richardson Property 

The Winnipegosis Formation is considered the most favourable unit for crush rock 
aggregate in the resource area given that it is the shallowest lithostratigraphic unit 
(directly underlying the quaternary cover and occurs at depths ranging from 18.0 m to 
64.9 m). A stratigraphic compilation of publicly available oil and gas well information, 
historical metallic and industrial mineral assessment work, and data from Athabasca 
Minerals Inc. 2013 and 2014 drill programs shows that there is good stratigraphic 
continuity of the lithostratigraphic units in the Richardson Property area. This includes 
the Winnipegosis Formation and the Precambrian basement granite, which are 
discussed further in the text that follows.  By way of preliminary reasoning to 
extrapolate these formations based on the stratigraphic continuity and observations 
made at the Property, the Richardson Property has several potential targets for further 
exploration.  

 
The following statements referring to any potential extension of the Richardson 

crush aggregate deposit are conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient 
exploration to define the extended mineral deposit and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral deposit and/or 
resource. Potential targets for further exploration are summarized as follows:   

 
1. Based on stratigraphic continuity of the Winnipegosis Formation, an extension 

of the current Winnipegosis crush rock aggregate deposit outwards from the 
resource area to other parts of the Property could create additional and/or more 



 

 

accessible Winnipegosis tonnage. To provide an example of the potential range 
increase in volume, a southerly extension of the Winnipegosis Formation 
deposit equivalent to an additional aerial extent of 7.49 km2 could add between 
0.6707 and 1.0060 billion tonnes of aggregate crush rock (e.g., Table 19). The 
approximate tonnages have been interpreted by extrapolating the formation 
wireframes from the resource area southwards and using the same averaged 
densities that were used for the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock 
aggregate resource. The volume range is within 20 percent of the modelled 
volume for each formation in the Richardson maiden inferred crush rock 
aggregate resource (compare versus Table 18).  

2. There is also justification in targeting future Winnipegosis exploration to the 
east-northeast, where the thickness of overburden is assumed to be thinner. If 
successful, this would lower the strip ratios to access the Winnipegosis in 
comparison to the resource area.    
 

3. If the economics of mining the Winnipegosis Formation are feasible, then the 
Precambrian basement granite represents a potential secondary crush rock 
aggregate target within the resource area due to its uniform nature and overall 
hardness as shown by aggregate test work conducted in this Technical Report. 
In the resource area, the Precambrian basement granite could account for an 
additional 165 million tonnes of aggregate. This estimate is conservative as the 
volume assumes a depth of 10 m (corresponding to when most of the drillholes 
ended). Based on drillhole 14RLD007, which confirmed uniform granite to a 
depth of 48.35 m, the granite could easily be extended, such that the granite 
could account for 319 million tonnes if, for example, the depth was extended to 
20 m instead of 10 m.  
 

4. In in the resource area, any potential granite crush rock aggregate source is 
contingent on the Winnipegosis being economic. However, the Precambrian 
basement granite is known crop out directly east-southeast of the resource 
area. Based on the uniformity and positive granite aggregate test results from 
the resource area, the adjacent exposed and near-surface granite represents a 
potential target for further exploration.  
 

5. A multi-technique geophysical conducted over the general granite outcrop area 
helps to define the near-surface boundaries of the granite body. Ground 
Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiles, which display interpretable data in the area 
of up to depths of 60 m, shows that the granite outcrop is fairly constrained to 
the immediate observed exposure; however, the GPR profiles suggest that the 
area directly north of the outcrop has the least amount of overburden and/or 
Winnipegosis dolostone material to overlie the Precambrian basement granite. 
Based on the GPR results, the estimated areas of combined surficial 
overburden and Winnipegosis Formation dolostone material that is situated on 
top of the Precambrian granite and is within 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m of 
surface is approximately: 4,600 m2; 15,200 m2; 45,100 m2; 91,300 m2; and 
147,233 m2, respectively. The ground magnetic data, which illustrates lateral 
changes in the subsurface that were not observed in the GPR response, shows 



 

 

that the overburden, in particular, is thicker to the northeast of the granite 
outcrop correlating to kame-type deposits delineated using LiDAR data. The 
geophysical interpretations remain inherently ambiguous, and require other 
geological information such as drilling to properly confirm and classify the 
identified litho-magnetic zones.  
 

6. Lastly, the Contact Rapids Formation, which underlies the Winnipegosis, 
comprises weakly consolidated muddy and sandy limestone, and is therefore 
not as desirable in comparison to the Winnipegosis (this is evident in poor 
aggregate test work results presented in this Technical Report). There is the 
possibility, however, that the Contract Rapids could provide a source of 
alternative flux material if the Winnipegosis were to be mined as crush rock 
aggregate.

Note 1:  The potential deposit quantity is conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient 
exploration to define the extended mineral deposit and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral deposit and/or 
resource. 

 

26 Recommendations  

The Richardson Property is considered to be a property of merit and warrants 
further exploration. This contention is supported by results presented in this Technical 
Report, which include: uniform and continuous Winnipegosis Formation target unit (and 
a secondary target unit in the Precambrian basement granite); positive aggregate test 
work results that were evaluated against Alberta Transportation and Canadian 
Standards Association aggregate standards; a Richardson maiden inferred crush rock 
aggregate resource estimate that has an aerial extent of 6.30 km2 and consists of 683 
million tonnes of aggregate material situated within the Winnipegosis Formation; and a 
continuing and positive market demand for aggregate products in the oil sands area of 
northeastern Alberta. 



 

 

In addition to the inferred aggregate resource area (6.30 km2), this Technical Report 
has shown the potential: 1) to extend the Winnipegosis deposit beyond the current 
resource area; and 2) for the Precambrian basement granite to provide another source 
of crush rock aggregate at the Property based on sample results presented in this 
Technical Report and knowledge that the granite crops out in the eastern part of the 
Richardson Property. Note: the potential deposit quantity and suggestion of a granite 
crush rock aggregate source is conceptual in nature as there has been insufficient 
exploration to define the extended mineral deposit and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral deposit and/or 
resource.   

A two-Phase approach is therefore recommended for 2019-2020 exploration at the 
Richardson Property consisting of Phase One geophysical surveying, and Phase Two 
extension and infill drilling in conjunction with a Preliminary Economic Assessment 
(PEA) scoping study. The total cost of both phases of recommended exploration work 
is estimated at CDN$916,000 (Table 20; not including contingency). With a 10% 
contingency the total budget is CDN$1,007,600.  

The recommended Phase One exploration work includes a 35 line-kilometre 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey to:  

• create a preliminary three-dimensional geological model of the resource area 
and beyond;  
 

• depict those areas that have shallow overburden overlying Devonian 
Winnipegosis dolomite and/or the Precambrian basement granite; and  
 

• define the drillhole locations for the Phase Two drill program.  

The proposed GPR survey will include eight northwesterly grid-lines designed to 
connect the 2014 GPR test area (i.e., the test area around the granite outcrop) to the 
2013 and 2014 drillhole collars. The GPR survey will also include four north-easterly 
tie-lines that are designed to verify the grid-line data and add confidence to the 
measured depths of the overburden, Winnipegosis dolomite and basement granite. 
The approximate cost of the Phase One work is CDN$40,000 (Table 20).  

Subject to the results of the Phase One survey, a Phase Two extension/infill 
drillhole program and ensuing composite aggregate test work analyses on the drill 
cores will:  

• verify the three-dimensional geological model; and  
 

• provide additional confidence to uniformity, extent, depth and quality of the 
Winnipegosis dolomite and the basement granite, which is necessary to produce 
an updated mineral resource estimate.  

It is recommended that the Phase Two extension and infill drilling consists of ten to 
eleven systematically placed diamond drillholes (totalling approximately 1,000 m). 
Areas of focus should include two separate justifications for drill testing as follows.  



 

 

1. Winnipegosis Extension. The Winnipegosis Formation deposit could be extended to 
the south, east and northeast of the resource area. It is anticipated that the 
topography (i.e., overburden) thins out to the east-northeast such that the depth to 
the Winnipegosis Formation may be thinner than in the resource area (overburden 
averages 36 m thickness; n = 11 drillholes drilled in 2013 and 2014 by Athabasca 
minerals). The Winnipegosis extension drilling would advance the project by 
increasing the confidence in the continuity and uniformity of the Winnipegosis 
Formation and the depth of overburden overlying the Winnipegosis.  
 

2. Precambrian Basement Granite Extension. This drilling should place emphasis on 
the granite as a potential crush rock aggregate source. Drill targets should be 
collared east-southeast of the resource area in an area directly adjacent to an 
exposure of Precambrian granite. The granite outcrop identified during 2013 field 
program and the 2014 ground geophysical program has the advantage of shallow 
to non-existent overburden and/or Winnipegosis Formation cover rock.  

The Phase Two extension/infill drilling, aggregate test work analysis and an 
updated NI 43-101 inferred and possibly indicated resource estimate Technical Report 
is estimated to cost approximately CDN$576,000 (Table 20).   

In conjunction with the Phase Two work, it is recommended that a PEA scoping 
study of the Richardson Project be conducted and includes: the creation of an initial pit 
shell; estimations of strip ratios to remove the overburden; and examines certain 
economic and environmental factors related to the market for crushed rock aggregate 
in the immediate vicinity of the Project. The completion of a PEA would add confidence 
to the viability of the Project. For example, this maiden inferred resource is reported in 
tonnages, and mining studies are required to constrain the resource within an optimal 
pit shell. The estimated cost to complete the PEA is CDN$300,000 (Table 20).
