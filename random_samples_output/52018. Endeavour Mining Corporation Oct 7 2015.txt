1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining (South Africa) Pty Limited (Coffey) has been requested by Endeavour Mining 

Corporation (Endeavour), the Issuer, to compile an Independent Technical Report on the Ity 

Gold Mine (Ity Mine) in Côte d'Ivoire which is operated by Société des Mines d'Ity (SMI), a 

subsidiary of La Mancha Holding S.àr.l. (La Mancha).  This document complies with 

disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the Toronto Stock Exchange Manual, 

National Instrument 43-101 (NI43-101) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Project, 

Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. 

SMI operates the open-pit and heap leach gold mine in the Ity district of western Côte d'Ivoire.  

Production commenced in 1991, with a total of over 1.0 million ounces (Moz) produced to date 

from multiple deposits.  The mine currently processes 950 ktpa of ore and produced 82,000 

ounces of gold in 2014 and 45,000 ounces of gold production from the first six months of 

2015.  

As the mining progresses and deeper ore is extracted, over the next several years recoveries 

from the heap-leach plant for several ore types will be reduced and the construction of a 

carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant may result in an improvement in overall project economics. 

In 2014, SNC-Lavalin Inc.conducted a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) on behalf of SMI to evalute 

the potential of a CIL plant using a processing rate of 1.5Mtpa.  The results of the study were 

positive and in late 2014 through to early 2015, SMI carried out drilling programs at the 

Daapleu, Zia NE and Mont Ity deposits designed to upgrade all Inferred Mineral Resource 

material from the 2014 mineral resource estimate to Indicated Mineral Resources, the 

Daapleu deposit Indicated Mineral Resource to Measured Mineral Resource, and to delineate 

each deposit further along strike.  The resulting 2015 mineral resource estimate update 

yielded a significant increase in Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources to 2.9Moz of gold 

contained in five deposits, two dumps, decommissioned leach pads and a stockpile. SNC-

Lavalin was mandated by SMI to update the PFS for the CIL Project using a processing rate 

of 2.0Mtpa.  The results of that study are summarized in this report. 

The mineral deposits described in this report are all part of the mine property of SMI's 

exploitation permit or the adjacent exploration permit in the Côte d'Ivoire and are centred on 

06o 52' 16" north latitude and 08o 06' 30" west longitude.  Côte d'Ivoire is located in West 

Africa at the extreme west of the Gulf of Guinea and is bordered by Ghana in the east, Mali 

and Burkina Faso in the north and Guinea and Liberia in the west.  The Ity gold deposits are 

located in the west of Côte d'Ivoire, 480km (direct) from the economic capital of Abidjan, near 

the border with Liberia and Guinea (Figure 1.1_1 and 1.1_2).

The Ity Mine currently operates two open pits; Mont Ity and Tontouo.  As of the Effective Date 

of this report the Tontouo open pit is near the end of its life and is not included in this technical 

report.  Recent drill programs have defined additional mineral resources for Mont Ity, as well 

as new in-situ mineral resources at Daapleu, Zia North East (ZiaNE), Walter and Gbeitouo 

and also the decommissioned heap leach pads at Aires de Lixiviation (Aires) and the former 

waste dumps of Verse Ouest and Teckraie. 

The SMI properties, which are the subject of this report, include two permits which contain the 

Ity gold deposits (Figure 1.1_2).  These permits are: 

 Permis d'Exploitation PE26 (Mining Permit)  

 Permis de Recherche PR61 (Exploration Permit) 

PR61 is situated over parts of the Zouan-Hounien and Blolequin prefectures.  The permit has 

a surface area of 153km2 and is oriented northeast-southwest and is comprised of two sub 

portions, including the following deposits and prospects: Gbeitouo, Daapleu, Yacetouo, 

Morgane, Mlambopleu to the east of the Cavally River and Floleu to the west of the river.  

PR61 was first issued in 1995 and extended in two year intervals with land area reductions 

down to the current holdings.

1.2 History 

Copper and gold were first discovered near the village of Ity in the 1950's during regional 

exploration by the Bureau Minière de la France d'Outre-Mer.  Initial attempts to recover the 

gold were unsuccessful due to the fineness of the gold and the rheology of the ore.  In 1983 

the Société Minière d'Ity was incorporated to develop the Flotouo deposit which poured it first 

gold in 1991.  Substantial exploration was done in the 1990s and many of the deposits were 

discovered or expanded at the time.  Since then ownership has changed several times until 

the La Mancha Group acquired a large stake in SMI in 2012.  In 2014 a change in 

shareholders was authorized by the Government of the Côte d'Ivoire leading to the current 

ownership structure.

1.3 Geology 

The Ity deposits are located in the Lower Proterozoic Birimian Formations of the Toulépleu-Ity 

klippe.  The Toulepleu-Ity klippe is a small remnant of Birimian within the older Archean 

portion of the West African Craton.  The Ity area is characterized by a series of granodioritic 

intrusions into a sedimentary sequence of volcano-sediments and carbonates with a general 

NE-SW strike.  The volcanic rocks are generally tuffaceous with chemistry that ranges from 

basic to acidic.  All formations have been subjected to regional metamorphism. 

The deposits of Ity, ZiaNE, and Walter are skarns developed at the contacts of the 

granodiorite with the carbonates.  The remaining in-situ deposits are more typical shear-

hosted, greenstone deposits.  The Daapleu deposit is characterized by the presence of a 

"rhyolitic" intrusive surrounded by a package of volcanosediments.  The "rhyolite" is locally 

called "daaplite" and is leucocratic (grey to white), microgranular, schistose and rich in micas, 

essentially a fine grained granite.  The Gbeitouo deposit is hosted within volcano-sediments. 

The Teckraie and Verse Ouest deposits are rock dumps of the now depleted Flotouo (skarn) 

open pit and sit on top of weathered granodiorite. Aires consists of the decomissioned heap 

leach pads from the historic operation of the mine. 

1.4 Exploration 

La Mancha's evaluation of the Ity Mine began in 2012 following the change in ownership and 

management.  Exploration since then has been carried out under the supervision of 

technically qualified personnel applying standard industry approaches.  All data acquired 

meets or exceeds industry standards and all exploration work has been carried out by, or 

supervised by technical personnel of the operator.  Work prior to 2012 has been validated or 

replaced with new information. 

1.5 Data 

A summary of the drilling for all eight deposits is given in Table 1.5_1.

Drilling and survey procedures observed are to acceptable industry standards, are appropriate 

to the deposits being drilled and are appropriate for mineral resource estimation. 

The Walter and Gbeitouo deposits still have a large proportion of historical boreholes utilized 

in the mineral resource estimates.  Historical drilling was poorly documented between 2002 

and 2012.  Sufficient additional drilling allowed verification of historic drilling for use in industry 

standard resource estimates.  Drilling practices from 2012 onward were all documented and 

regularly assessed by independent senior consultants and are to acceptable industry 

standards, are appropriate to the deposits being drilled and are appropriate for mineral 

resource estimation. 

Control samples used during drill campaigns on the Aires, Teckraie, Verse Ouest, Daapleu, 

ZiaNe and Mont Ity project areas contained within this report comprised the insertion of 

standards, blanks and field duplicates into the sample stream.  The intended aim should be 

approximately 5% coverage for standards, blanks and duplicates.  The quality control data 

was analysed on an on-going basis and generated some queries with the laboratory that were 

resolved. 

During the different campaigns on the deposit areas the duplicates were comprised of a 

quarter split of the core, a second coarse-split of the RC sample or a second split of the pulp.  

A total of 18 different commercial standards (Geostats, Gannet Holdings and Rock Labs of 

Australia) were used, of various grades.  Two different sources of blank material were used, 

beach sand and coarse rock chips that were confirmed to not contain any gold.   

All assays for the most recent exploration campaigns were done by Bureau Veritas laboratory, 

Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire with 50g fire-assay analyses.  In addition to the above, six batches of 

samples were sent to ALS Chemex, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso as umpire checks.  These 

samples came from the Mont Ity and ZiaNE project areas. 

In general the results of the assays were within acceptable limits and deemed suitable for use 

in the mineral resource database.  Any data deemed not to be suitable was removed from the 

database.

1.6 Metallurgy and Heap Leach Process 

No heap leach testwork has been conducted on the project during the last number of years 

and anything completed historically is no longer available.  The heap leach has been in 

operation for many years and remains in operation and as such production data can be used 

to give an indication of the metallurgical performance expected from the plant. 

It is reported by mine management that regular bottle-roll tests are completed to determine 

the recoverable gold from a -2mm pulverised 50 gram sample.  

Historically, as reported in 2008, regular column leach tests were completed, but this practise 

has been discontinued. 

The analytical techniques available on the mine do not include total contained gold methods 

and as such the actual head grade samples cannot be determined.  Comparing gold 

recovered with the above determined leachable gold content results in a historical yield of 

between 75% and almost 80%. 

1.7 Metallurgy and CIL Process 

Considerable metallurgical testwork has been conducted to confirm the metallurgical 

response for a CIL plant.  The metallurgical testing used for the 2.0Mtpa CIL project was 

completed during 2014 at ALS Minerals Division (Metallurgy) located in Kamloops, BC, 

Canada.  Additional work was conducted in 2015 but has not been integrated into this report 

and is part of ongoing feasibility studies. 

Mineralogical and metallurgical test work was completed in order to generate sufficient 

mineralogical and metallurgical information to: 

 Establish the processing route (process flow diagrams); 

 Determine the plant operating parameters for the ores to be processed; 

 Evaluate the variability in metallurgical performance for the different deposits, and; 

 Define parameters required for the engineering and design of the plant (process design 
criteria, mass and water balance and equipment sizing). 

The mineralogical study and metallurgical test work program were executed on the geological 

samples from the following deposit and facies: 

 Daapleu deposit included three different geological facies called Daaplite, Volcano 
sediment and a High Grade contact zone between both; 

 Gbeitouo deposit included two different geological facies called Oxidized Clay and 
Meta-volcano sediment; 

 Mont Ity Deep Extension test work was on two different geological facies called 
Oxidized Clay and Reduced Clay; 

 ZiaNE deposit test work was on two different geological facies called Oxidized Clay and 
Laterite; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 7 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Aires – four composite samples representing four geographical areas of the heap leach 
pads. 

The sample material was selected and prepared by SMI geologists and personnel to create 

what is believed to be the most representative facies samples.  The metallurgical test work 

results allowed the process development steps described in the following paragraphs. 

A mineral sizer type crusher has been selected for the soft sticky ore facies, such as oxidized 

clay, reduced clay and heap leach residues.  A jaw crusher has been selected for the more 

competent (hard) ore facies, such as daaplite and volcano-sediments. 

The preliminary results from the test grinds indicate the grinding mill has been sized to 

process ore at an average rate of 254tph (tonnes per hour) with a finished product 80% 

passing 75μm.  

Gravity concentration did not improve overall gold recoveries and has not been considered in 

the process development as the mean gold particle diameter is only in the 18 µm range.   

A high rate thickener has been selected for the pre-leach thickener.  The thickener underflow 

density of 43% (w/w) is anticipated.  

Whole ore cyanidation leach tests were performed and a final grind of 75µm has been 

selected with air sparging for the process design criteria.  The cyanide leach kinetic curves 

developed during the test work show that gold extraction with 32-hour retention time was 

selected for the CIL plant process design criteria.  The gold extraction for the composite 

samples averaged about 93% for the non-sulphide composites and 72% for the sulphide 

composites. 

1.8 Mineral Resources 

Ity is an operating gold mine.  The mineral resource models supporting the current mineral 

reserves estimates for Ity were updated as of July 31st, 2015 by independent consultants, 

Coffey and Arethuse Geology Sarl (Arethuse).  

Coffey estimated the mineral resource for the Mont Ity, Daapleu, ZiaNE, Aires, Teckraie, and 

Verse Ouest deposits using a combination of Nearest Neighbour, Inverse Distance methods.  

The volume modelling and mineral resource estimation was completed in the 3D software 

package MicromineTM, Datamine™ Studio 3 and Isatis. 

Arethuse estimated the mineral resources for the Walter and Gbeitouo deposits using a 

combination of Ordinary Kriging and Inverse Distance methods.  Geological modelling and 

mineral resource estimation was done using GEOVIA Surpac 6.6, XLStat, Autotats and Isatis 

software packages. 

The mineral resource estimates were prepared by conventional block modeling techniques. 

Grade shells were generally defined using a threshold assay of 0.50g/t Au as the lower limit 

for inclusion within the grade shell. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 8 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Samples were composited to standard one-metre lengths, starting from the top of the 

mineralized zone wireframe for each hole.  Statistical analysis was employed to define high-

grade outlier gold assays, and all composites inside the grade shells were capped.  Capping 

strategies ranged from Daapleu and Verse Ouest deposits where capping was deemed 

unnecessary to Walter where gold values were capped to 40g/t.  

The quality of the estimations was validated using summary statistics, comparison of the 

estimate mean versus the mean of the composite dataset, visual checks of cross sections, 

long sections, and plans and comparison of different estimation methods. 

The mineral resources are defined within an optimal pit shell generated using the following 

parameters: 

 Overall pit slope of approximately 30 to 40 degrees; 

 Commodity price of USD1,500/oz Au; 

 Process recovery between 73% and 96%; 

 Process cost between USD12.1/t and USD16.5/t;  

 Refinery, selling and royalty costs of 4% of sell price. 

Mineral resource estimates from five in-situ deposits, two rock dumps and the 

decommissioned heap leach pads are given in Table 1.8_1.  The weathered zones are 

generally feed for the Heap Leach Plant over the next three years.  The rest of the material is 

planned as feed for the CIL plant and is mostly comprised of material which cannot be as 

effectively treated in the Heap Leach process.  The Verse Ouest dump has not yet been 

considered for mineral reserve heap leach processing or for the CIL project.

1.9 Mineral Reserves (Heap Leach) 

The deposits planned to be mined during the current mine plan have been optimized for a 

"Heap Leach and CIL scenario" that envisioned a 2016 construction decision on the CIL plant 

with commercial operation at the start of 2018.  If the CIL construction decision was deferred 

then the "Heap Leach scenario" would have to be revised.  The material to be mined is often 

overlying material that will be mined later and included in the optimization of the ""Carbon-In-

Leach scenario".  The goal was to identify the most profitable shell for a "Heap Leach 

scenario" for each suitable deposit with the constraint of processing only the oxidized material.  

The material mined for the "Heap Leach" i.e. the open pit shells, are contained within the 

locations of the material to be mined as the "CIL" shells.  Mineral reserves in the "Heap Leach 

scenario" pit design shells are inclusive of mining dilution and mine recovery, considering 

plant recovery and are summarized in Table 1.9_1.   

Some material that is not processable using the Heap Leach facility (essentially reduced clay 

material and granodiorite) and will be mined before the CIL plant will be operational.  SMI 

aims at stockpiling this material in a dedicated stockpile until the start of the CIL plant.  This 

limited amount of material located inside the Heap Leach pit limit is considered as "mineral 

reserve material" and will be accounted for in the CIL production plan scenario 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 10 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Process costs, inclusive of the general and administrative (G&A) costs, and recoveries were 

used to generate the mineral reserves for the Heap Leach operation.  The metallurgical 

recoveries used to calculate the mineral reserves are based on SMI recommendations and 

are in line with 2014 actual results. 

The cut-off grade parameters used for the models are based on costs, royalties, process 

recoveries and metal prices supplied by SMI.

1.10 Mineral Reserves (Carbon-in-Leach) 

The base case mining production schedule for the CIL operation was completed on a bench-

by-bench level for all deposits.  Daapleu and Ity were designed with interim pits targeting high-

grade material.  In order to mine the Daapleu pit a section of the Cavally River requires 

diversion creating at risk exposure related to hydrogeology.   

The mining recovery used is industry standard for similar type operations and material types.  

The mine operation cost estimation is based on the tonnage of each type of material from the 

different pits and the specific pit location.  Using these parameters, the cycle times were 

calculated based on SMI production factors and hauling distances for each pit.  Finally, an 

operating cost per type of material was calculated based on the labour cost, fuel consumption, 

maintenance cost, etc.  Table 1.10_1 presents the mineral reserves for the CIL operation.

Currently the CIL recovery rate is estimated to be between 93% for the non-sulphide 

composites and 72% for the sulphide composites.  The planned ongoing DFS will investigate 

processing technologies that may enhance the recovery rate. 

1.11 Mining 

The Ity Heap Leach mine is an existing conventional open pit mine using articulated trucks 

(40t class) and hydraulic backhoes or front shovel excavators (80t class).  Limited drill and 

blast activities are required as the material that is currently mined is largely oxidized (clay or 

laterites).  This material is processed at the existing heap leach facility. 

Mining for the CIL scenario is envisioned to be a similar operation developing five in-situ open 

pits, one decommissioned leach pad and two former waste dumps. 

1.12 Infrastructure 

SMI started its mining operation in the area in 1991 with a 200ktpa processing capacity with 

all open-pit mining.  Since that time the facilities have been upgraded to process 

approximately 950ktpa of ore using heap leaching as the processing method. 

The current mine facilities include: 

 Mining administration building; 

 Main workshop and repair facilities; 

 Mining equipment re-fuelling centre; 

 Explosive storage, located away from the main facilities; 

 Plant administration buildings such as the security office, workshop, administration 
offices and metallurgical lab; 

 Warehouses;  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 12 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Camp accomodations for 200 persons; 

 Water services inclusive of raw water abstraction, potable water, fire water, and;  

 Medical facilities. 

The electrical power is supplied from the Ivorian national grid as well as back-up diesel 

generators. 

The CIL operation will require infrastructure development as described in this report.  This will 

include, within the property limits, a CIL plant, the diversion of the Cavally River to allow 

development of the Daapleu pit and associated bridge, construction of the haulage roads for 

the new pits, and the construction of a staged Tailing Storage Facilities (TSF) for disposal of 

the related tailings from the CIL plant.  

Outside the property limit, a new power transmission line will have to be installed by the local 

electrical utility. 

1.13 Environmental 

Several environmental studies have been conducted in the last 15 years.  Geostat Systems 

International Corporation has conducted two internal reports for SMI: an environmental 

management plan (Plan de Management Environnemental) dated March 2000 and a 

rehabilitation plan (Réaménagement du site minier d'Ity) dated June 2005.  An Environmental 

Impact Study (EIS) for the Ity Mine has been carried out in 2000 by SMI.  This study has been 

used as a reference in the rehabilitation report titled "Réaménagement du Site Minier d'Ity" 

(SMI, 2005).  The Ministry of the Environment also conducted an environmental audit of the 

Ity Mine at the end of December 2005. 

In order to renew the Mining Permit PE26 and in consideration of the plans for the CIL project, 

two social and environmental impact assessments (SEIA) have also been completed: 

 Étude d'impact environnemental et social du projet de construction d'une usine de 
traitement de minerai de type CIL sur le permis d'exploitation PE26 de la mine d'or ITY 
(Roche, 2013). 

 Étude d'impact environnemental et social dans le cadre du projet d'exploitation des 
gisements de Gbeitouo et de Daapleu dans le département de Blolequin (2D 
Consulting, 2015). 

In addition to the exploitation of two new deposits, the CIL project includes the diversion of the 

Cavally River (four river closure dams), the construction of a bridge and of three perimeter 

dikes to protect the Walter, Gbeitouo and Daapleu deposits. 

There is an SEIA in progress related to this planned infrastructure for the CIL project.  The 

public meeting process is planned to start at the end of September 2015.  It is anticipated that 

the decree, which authorizes the construction and operation of the planned infrastructure, may 

be granted as early as the fourth quarter of 2015. 

The three SEIAs were performed according to the Loi Cadre No. 96-766 of 3 October 1996 on 

the Environmental Code, the Décret No. 96-894 of 8 November 1996 establishing the rules 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 13 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

and procedures applicable to studies of the environmental impacts of development projects 

and the Arrêté No. 00972 of 14 November 2007 on the application of Décret No. 96-894. 

The SEIA for the construction for the CIL plant was approved by the Ivorian authorities in 

December 2013 (Arrêté 008/Mine SUDD/ANDE).  A revision will be required for a larger 

throughput rate of the CIL plant and modifications to the locations of some of the associated 

infrastructure.  

A resettlement action plan is also currently in preparation. 

1.14 Capital Costs 

Heap Leach 

The total capital expenditure planned for the Heap Leach operation until the end of 2017 is 

approximately at 18.3 MUSD (16.6 MEUR).   

The planned expenditures are as follows: 

 Mining fleet equipment renewal and/or additional equipment – 8.0MUSD (7.3MEUR); 

 Mine dewatering equipment and borehole drilling – 2.2MUSD (2.0MEUR); 

 Processing plant sustaining capital and permanent infrastructure - 2.8MUSD 
(2.5MEUR); 

 Other smaller capital items (light vehicles, buses, IT, security, etc.) – 5.3MUSD 
(4.8MEUR). 

CIL Project 

SNC-Lavalin's mandate for the CIL project was to develop a PFS level capital and operating 

cost estimate with a target accuracy of ±30%.

CIL Project 

The data used to prepare the operating cost estimate are based on the June 2015 geological 

block model and associated mining schedule.  This mining schedule was based on a mining 

plan that excludes Inferred Mineral Resources.  The target accuracy of this OPEX estimate 

update is ±30%. 

The mine operation cost was calculated based on the tonnage of each type of material from 

the different pits and the specific pit location.  Using these parameters, the cycle times were 

calculated based on SMI production factors and hauling distances for each pit.  Finally, an 

operating cost per type of material was calculated based on the labour cost, fuel consumption, 

maintenance cost, etc. 

The mining costs used in the PFS are presented for each facies of each of the deposits and 

range from USD 1.45 /t (1.32 €/t) to USD 3.11 /t (2.83 €/t). 

The processing cost per material type was evaluated in laboratory tested on samples taken 

from the site.  These samples were subjected to various tests to simulate reagent dosing, 

wear factors and other parameters.  The combination of all these results was used to 

calculate the processing cost per material type.  It is important to mention that metallurgical 

testing results used in this PFS update are not including the recent laboratory testing results 

performed in 2015.  The processing costs in the PFS are estimated to be USD 13.67 /t (12.43 

€/t) on average over the life of the CIL project. 

The building maintenance and administrative supplies have been calculated based on building 

CAPEX value and factored plant labour cost. The labour cost has been estimated based on a 

plant general crew by function and salary. 

Site G&A costs, estimated at USD 9.7 /a (8.8m €/a), were provided by SMI. 

1.16 Economic Analysis 

An economic analysis has been conducted using a cash flow model prepared on the basis 

and assumptions as stated in the following discussion.  The results of the economic analysis 

represent forward-looking information (production rates, cash flows, net present value, etc.) 

that are subject to a number of unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause 

actual results to differ materially from those presented here. 

Table 1.16_1 summarizes the property's valuation, on the basis of the below described 

assumptions.  The base case has been run using a flat gold price of USD1,150/oz 

(€1,045/oz), net of USD4.55 (€5/oz) bullion transport, insurance and refining costs.  A flat 

USD/euro exchange rate of 1.10 has been assumed.  A 3.5% gold royalty, payable to the 

State of Côte d'Ivoire, has been applied over the life of both the Heap Leach and CIL 

operations based on the retained gold sale price assumptions.  This royalty is in accordance 

with the rate applicable, under the Ivorian mining code.The financial analysis supports the 

economic viability of both the Heap Leach operation and the CIL project.   

The Heap Leach mine production schedule currently extends to 2017.  The CIL project at 2.0 

Mtpa has a life of mine of 14 years.

1.17 Conclusions 

Historical exploration activities have been of variable quality while the work undertaken in the 

last three years is to international standards.  Current exploration practices are appropriate to 

the deposits being evaluated.  All historical data has been assessed for accuracy and 

incorporated into the database and it was found acceptable for use in geological and mineral 

resource evaluations. 

The mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Ity property are robust.  There remain 

sufficient Heap Leach reserves to be economically exploited over the next several years until 

the CIL project construction decision is made and construction is completed.  Additional 

opportunities exist to increase the Heap Leach reserves with known oxidized mineral 

resources should an extension of the Heap Leach operation life be required.   

The quality and quantity of metallurgical testwork performed for the 2Mtpa CIL is considered 

adequate for the PFS level developed for the project.  The ore facies not containing sulphide 

are substantially free-milling and do not show any preg-robbing characteristics.  However, the 

ore facies containing sulphide are partially refractory and direct cyanidation (CIL process) 

yields a lower gold recovery. 

The PFS demonstrated the economic potential of the CIL project with the possibility of 

extending the Ity Mine Life of Mine by over 10 years by adding substantial mineral reserves.  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 16 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The positive results of the PFS justify proceeding to the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) 

which is now underway. 

Several additional targets at different stages of exploration (i.e. Verse Ouest and others) have 

been identified in the very close vicinity of present Ity facilities, on both the Exploitation Permit 

and Exploration Permit.  The company considers that additional resources could be defined 

and potentially provide additional feed for the Heap Leach operation to extend its life by 2 to 3 

years and also to increase the CIL project mineral resource and mineral reserve base. 

1.18 Recommendations 

A follow-up exploration program aiming at achieving the targets of: (1) providing additional 

feed for the Heap Leach operation to extend its life by 2 to 3 years; and (2) increasing the CIL 

project mineral resource and mineral reserve base has been proposed for the Ity Project.  The 

program consists of approximately 25,000m of drilling (80% diamond/20% RC drilling) and is 

designed to maximize the opportunity to expand the potential of known deposits and for 

discovery of new zones of gold mineralization for the minimum exploration expenditures in the 

shortest time frame.  The total exploration budget to complete most of the required work is 

estimated to be roughly USD 5.5M.  This program is scheduled to begin in Q4 2015 and to be 

completed within 9 to 12 months. 

The mining plan shows that, while most of the planned plant feed was tested, some geological 

facies have not been tested during the PFS stage.  These facies should be tested to confirm 

the adequacy of the currently developed process.  

Additional mineralogical and metallurgical test work is also required to firm up the process 

flowsheet that has been developed.  The additional test work will allow determination of 

optimum operating parameters (final grind, reagent consumption, etc.) in order to minimize 

CAPEX and OPEX.  

Additional rheology and settling testwork is also recommended for equipment selection sizing 

and design, as there are wide variability characteristics in the various facies. 

The increase in mineral resources of the sulphide facies (particularly in the Daapleu deposit) 

may warrant investigation of alternate processing methods such as pressure oxidation 

process (POX) for these sulphidic facies.  Pressure oxidation followed by POX product 

cyanidation along with the flotation tailings stream, will likely produce a higher gold recovery 

than direct cyanidation of the ore.  However the additional CAPEX and OPEX associated with 

the POX processing needs to be investigated and evaluated to demonstrate the economics. 

It is recommended, at the next stage of technical reporting, that a more detailed scheduling 

exercise be undertaken to determine the optimal scenario for feeding ore from the various pits 

and stockpiles to the mill, particularly with the different types of ore coming from the pits (hard 

versus soft, and also based on sulphide contents). 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 17 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

A more detailed pit phasing plan for ZiaNE and Daapleu should also be carried out in future 

studies of the project as these pits have the potential to bring higher grade material to the mill 

earlier in the production schedule, especially from Daapleu. 

During the next phase of the work, an optimization of the TSF in terms of location, dam 

alignment and footprint will need to be carried out.   

During the next phase of the study, significant work will be required to optimize the design 

diversion of the Cavally River and minimize the environmental and social impacts. 

A geotechnical investigation program for all proposed pits to obtain the geotechnical 

information required for the DFS level open pit slope design is recommended in addition to a 

geotechnical field investigation for all infrastructure.

2 INTRODUCTION 

Coffey has been requested by Endeavour, the Issuer, to compile an Independent Technical 

Report on the Ity Mine in Côte d'Ivoire which is operated by SMI, a subsidiary of La Mancha 

Holding S.àr.l.  This document complies with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth 

in the Toronto Stock Exchange Manual, NI43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Project, 

Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. 

SMI operates the open-pit and heap leach gold mine in the Ity district of western Côte d'Ivoire.  

Production commenced in 1991, with a total of over 1.0Moz produced to date from multiple 

deposits.  The mine currently processes 950 ktpa of ore and produced 82,000 ounces of gold 

in 2014 and 45,000 ounces of gold production from the first six months of 2015.   

A Scoping Study for the exploitation of the mineral resource using an alternative processing 

method was conducted in 2013.  The preliminary financial analysis carried out during this 

study showed promising results and SMI decided to continue through the PFS stage.   

In 2014, SNC-Lavalin Inc. conducted a PFS on behalf of SMI to evaluate the potential of a CIL 

plant using a processing rate of 1.5Mtpa.  The results of the study were positive and in late 

2014 through to early 2015, SMI carried out drilling programs at Daapleu, Zia NE and Mont Ity 

designed to upgrade all Inferred Mineral Resource material from the 2014 mineral resource 

estimate to Indicated Mineral Resource, the Daapleu deposit Indicated Mineral Resource to 

Measured Mineral Resource and to delineate each deposit further along strike.  The resulting 

2015 mineral resource estimate update yielded a significant increase in Measured and 

Indicated Mineral Resources for all three areas and SNC-Lavalin was mandated by SMI to 

update the PFS for the CIL Project using a processing rate of 2.0Mtpa. 

All units in this report are metric and distances are in metres, unless otherwise stated.  

All geographic coordinates are UTM WGS84 Zone N29.  Elevation Datum is mean sea 

level 

2.1 Scope of the Report 

This report is intended to document the results of the latest mineral resource estimates, the 

results of the mining studies for the Heap Leach operations and the results of the PFS for the 

CIL Project available to date. 

The mineral resource estimates for the Daapleu, ZiaNE and Mont Ity deposits, the Aires Heap 

Leach pads, and the Verse Ouest dump are provided as of the Effective Date of July 31, 

2015.  The 2014 or earlier mineral resource estimates for the Walter and Gbeitouo deposits, 

and the Teckraie dump have also updated to this Effective Date.  The report documents the 

results of the Heap Leach mining study and the CIL plant PFS of 2014 which was updated to 

the July 2015 Effective Date.   

This report is prepared under the guidelines of NI43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining 

and Metallurgy (CIM) guidelines and is intended to meet the filing requirements of the Issuer.

4.2 Mineral Rights 

The SMI properties which are the subject of this report are located on two permits in the area 

on and near the Ity gold deposit (Figure 4.1_2).  These permits are: 

 Permis d'Exploitation PE26 (Mining Permit), coordinates are given in Table 4.2_1, and 

 Permis de Recherche PR61 (Exploration Permit), coordinates are given in Table 4.2_2. 

Mining Permit PE26 comprises an area of 25km2 and includes the Ity Gold Mine, the deposits 

ZiaNE and Walter, the Aires (decommissioned Heap Leach Pads), the rock dumps Verse 

Ouest and Teckraie and surrounding areas most of which are to the west of the Cavally River. 

Mining Permit PE26 was first granted in 1989 as Arrête 197/MINES/DM/ (14 October 1989) 

and renewed as:  

 Arrête 081/MME/DM (13 December1994);  

 Arrête 0038/MRMP/DM27/07/1998;  

 Arrête 003/ME/DM 3 March 2006 (prorogation de validité), and ;  

 Arrête 005/MME/DM/26/03/2008 for a further period of seven years from 1 November 
2006 (Appendix A). 

The PFS required for the renewal of the permit was lodged with the Minister of Mines in May 

2013.  The renewal of the exploitation permit was granted on 28 August 2014 as Arrête 8-

002/MIM/DGMG.  The renewal is for 10 years from 14 November 2014.   

The Environmental and Social Impact study (ESIS) for the construction of CIL gold plant was 

approved on 17 December 2013 as Arrête 008/MINESUDD/ANDE.

for the cumulative production since January 1st 2001 comprised between 13 and 22 tonnes, 

and of 3% while this cumulative production is comprised between 22 and 35 tonnes. 

4.5 Risk Factors 

Significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work 

on the property include the recent political unrest in Côte d'Ivoire.  SMI management 

continues to believe that the Ivorian political situation will not have a significant impact on the 

long-term of the mine or the recoverability of its investments in the Ity property.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Climate 

The climate of Côte d'Ivoire is tropical with a dry season from December to May and a wet 

season with intermittent sunny days from June to November.  Climatic conditions at Ity are 

tropical and the seasons are distinguished by changes in precipitation and wind direction.  

Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year.  The rainy season at Ity runs from April 

to October, and the dry season from November to April.  Annual rainfall is 1800mm and 

temperatures are generally average between 25-30°C.  Operations are carried out year round 

however access to exploration sites on the east side of the Cavally River may be restricted 

during heavy rains. 

5.2 Vegetation and Soils 

Two types of vegetation cover are found in the Côte d'Ivoire and have a very specific 

distribution.  The vegetation types are delimited by a concave boundary that runs from Man-

Toumodi south to Abengourou (Section 5.3, Figure 5.3_1). 

 The equatorial forest covers the southern domain. 

 The northern domain is a mixed dense humid forest, guinea-type savannah and 
wooded savannah. 

Three types of soils cover are mapped (from north to south) 

 Ferralitic red soils in forested areas.  These are deep, leached, mostly dry and very 
acidic 

 Ferrisols rich in iron hydroxides at the savannah-forest boundaries, and 

 Tropical soils of the savannahs rich in iron. 

5.3 Topography 

The topography of Côte d'Ivoire is characterised by an ensemble of hills and flat-topped 

plateaus in undulating plains.  The elevation rises from sea-level at the coast to approximately 

1700m at Mt Nimba at the border with Guinea and Liberia in the west (Figure 5.3_1).  The 

regions in the west and northwest are marked by the mountains of Dans, Touras and Touba. 

The Ity deposit is situated on a peneplain dominated by small hills typical of humid tropical 

forest morphology.  The area hosts a series of hills of approximately 300m high.  The four 

dominant hills being Mounts Zia, Ity, Flotouo and Zouatouo. 

The Cavally (Cavalla) River is situated approximately 1km from the current operations and 

runs through the Daapleu deposit.  The river winds in a serpentine fashion, runs roughly north 

to south draining the western portion of Côte d'Ivoire and forms part of the border with Liberia 

in the south.

5.4 Access and Infrastructure 

The Ity property and associated exploration areas are located in a remote region.  Access to 

site is possible by road from Abidjan and is a ten hour trip.  The mine can be supplied via this 

route.  Access for staff is generally by air from Abidjan to Man and then by road from Man to 

the mine site.  Flights are run weekly, currently on a Tuesday. 

Roads to the mine are generally tarred but may be in poor repair in places and as in most 

tropical areas can deteriorate rapidly during the rainy season. 

There are no large towns near the mine site but there are numerous villages and settlements 

that could be classified as small towns nearby.  Basic goods supplying the local population 

needs can be found but most supplies and services needed by the mining operation must be 

brought in from Abidjan or imported. 

5.5 Security 

Security issues that affect the SMI property are general lack of access and limited 

transportation due to the remote location.  Political uncertainty due to political conflict in the 

last few years is a concern.  The recent Ebola epidemic did not reach the area but the 

property is close to the border with Guinea and Liberia and the potential for a spread into the 

areas exists if there is another outbreak in neighbouring countries.  SMI management is 

aware of these risks and procedures are in place to deal with potential security threats.

Surface rights are sufficient for all current mining and milling operations, exploration activities, 

and for all required mine facilities.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 General History of the Property 

The general history of the property up to 2008 is taken from reports by Febvey and Bottero 

2013 and Danjou and Furic 2014.  Site specific histories are given in Sections 6.2 - 6.9. 

In the 1950's, copper and gold discovered in placers near the village of Ity attracted the 

attention of Bureau Minière de la France d'Outre Mer (BUMIFOM).  BUMIFOM was initially a 

copper exploration company before switching to gold exploration.  France's state-owned 

Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) estimated an in-house geological 

resource in 1970.  However, various attempts to economically extract gold from the Flotouo 

deposit failed because of metallurgical problems, mainly due to the fineness of the gold and 

the rheology of the ore. 

In 1984, SMI was incorporated in Côte d'Ivoire as a vehicle for developing the Flotouo 

deposit.  Further exploration conducted by BRGM and SMI in the 1980' yielded another in-

house geological resource that confirmed and increased the mineralized zones found earlier.  

Mine construction began in 1990.  The first gold from the Flotouo deposit was poured in 

January 1991.  COFRAMINES was later replaced by Mine Or in 1993, and then by Normandy 

La Source, who raised its stake in SMI to 51% by acquiring 11% from SODEMI in 1997.  

Mining at Zia (the northeast extension of Flotouo) began in 2000. 

La Compagnie Minière Or (COMINOR) was created in 1999 by the BRGM in France to 

receive some of the assets (including SMI and other Côte d'Ivoire exploration properties) from 

the Normandy Mining Group.  In 2000, COMINOR was transferred to Compagnie générale 

des matières nucléaires (COGEMA), now part of the AREVA group, and in March 2002, 

COMINOR acquired its 51% shareholding in SMI from the Normandy Mining Group. 

In September 2002, Côte d'Ivoire was essentially divided in half following civil unrest and the 

mining operations were abandoned from December 2002 to June 2003.  Production resumed 

in February 2004. 

In 2006 COMINOR was subsumed into the La Mancha Group via a reverse takeover of La 

Mancha by Compagnie Française de Mines et Métaux (CFMM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

the Areva group.  This gave La Mancha an effective 45.9% interest in the Ity Gold Mine.  La 

Mancha took over operation of the mine.  La Mancha has subsequently made operational 

improvements to increase gold production and carried out a series of drilling programme 

resulting in the extension of the known deposits and discovery of additional deposits in the 

permit areas. 

The early exploration history of the Ity area is summarised in Table 6.1_1

Exploration between 1995 and 2011 concentrated on areas that are not the subject of this 

report.  Exploration carried out over the properties which are the subject of this report is 

detailed in Sections 6.2-6.5. 

On November 12, 2012 La Mancha delisted from the Toronto and Frankfort stock exchanges 

(http://www.lamancha.ca/en/news/2012/la-mancha-announces-completion-of-compulsory-

acquisition-by-weather-ii ).  The last publically reported mineral resources and mineral 

reserves for the Ity Mine were as at December 31, 2011 (Table 6.1_2). 

In 2014 a change of shareholders was authorised by the government of the Côte d'Ivoire.  

La Mancha was able to acquire additional shares for SODEMI giving it a majority of the 

shares in SMI.  The new set of shareholders is: Groupe La Mancha (55%), SODEMI (30%), 

State of Côte d'Ivoire (10%) and Groupe DIDIER DROGBA (5%).

6.2 History: Aires de Lixiviation (Heap Leach Pads) 

The Aires de Lixiviation (Heap Leach Pads) represents the residues of the leach pads which 

were in operation from 1990 to 2009.  In 2010 the residues were estimated at 5.68Mt at 

1.11g/t Au (Islip, 2014).  This Inferred Mineral Resource (reported in accordance with the 

requirements of NI43-101) was estimated from production records over the period the leach 

pads were in operation.   

A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current 

mineral resources or mineral reserves; and the Issuer is not treating the historical estimate as 

current mineral resources or mineral reserves. 

This is a historic resource estimate which has been replaced by the current mineral resource 

estimation reported in this document. 

No other evaluation work was undertaken prior to 2013. 

6.3 History: Teckraie 

Teckraie is the historical waste dump from the Flotouo deposit.  The cut-off grade at the time 

was 3g/t Au.  No evaluation work has been done on this dump prior to the current study.

Three large pits are exploited by the artisanal miners.  Two of these are oriented east-west 

and a third at N50°near the village.  The artisanal miners extract the mineralized oxidized 

saprolites and the adjacent altered daaplites.  The gold is washed at the Cavally River and 

recovered as a fine grained "gold powder". 

6.5 History: ZiaNE 

Historical exploration at ZiaNE was included as part of the overall exploration and evaluation 

programme of SMI.  In 2008 52 boreholes for 4234.55m of core, were drilled.  There are an 

additional 32 boreholes drilled in the 2015 campaign with a total meterage of 19,526m. 

6.6 History: Verse Ouest Rock Dump 

Between 1996 and 2007, the cut-off of the mine was 2g/t Au.  The material with gold grade 

less than 2g/t Au was dumped at Verse Ouest.  The low grade clays with 1 to 2g/t Au were 

dumped at Verse Ouest from 2008 to 2013.  No evaluation work has been done for this dump 

prior to the current evaluation. 

6.7 History: Mont Ity 

Refer to general history of Ity deposits (Section 6.1).  New drilling was done in 2014 and 

comprised 31 boreholes of which six were for metallurgical samples, five were for hydrology 

studies.  The remainder were drilled to confirm the geological model and are incorporated into 

the mineral resource estimate.

6.8 History: Walter 

Two exploration campaigns have been undertaken at Walter, the first in 2008-2009 and a 

second 2013-2014.  At total of 97 boreholes were drilled of which 72 were cored and 25 were 

Reverse circulation drilling.  A summary of the drilling is given in Table 6.8_1.  The earlier 

campaign was to delineate the deposit to enable a mineral resource to be estimated.  The 

second campaign tested the extensions to the northeast, southwest and filled in gaps to 

reduce the drilling grid to 25m x25m.

6.9 History: Gbeitouo 

Gbeitouo was discovered during regional exploration in the 1990.  Drilling began in 2007.  The 

history of Gbeitouo exploration is given in Table 6.9_1.   

Gbeitouo was explored through four drilling campaigns from 2007 to 2013 and two initial well 

campaigns (in 1996 and 1999) that have not been considered for the mineral resource 

estimations because of the lack of information.  A total of 156 holes for a total length of 

12,998m were drilled, either by diamond core (7,307m), reverse circulation (4,666m) or rotary

air blast (1,025m).  The first DD-RC campaign and the second RAB campaign (2007-2009) 

were to delineate the deposit to enable a mineral resource estimation.  The third DD 

campaign (2010) tested the extension of the mineralization to the Southwest.  The fourth and 

last DD campaign (2013) tested the Northeast, Southwest and depth extensions of the 

deposit, and duplicated drill holes from previous campaigns.  The drilling grid was 40m x 30m 

intercepting the main ore bodies with an angle close to perpendicular.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The description of the regional geological setting is taken primarily from the End of Campaign 

reports prepared by SMI for the Aires de Lixiviation, Teckraie and Daapleu (Febvey and 

Bottero 2013).  The Qualified Person is familiar with most of the references used and is in 

agreement that the description fairly represents the generally accepted interpretation of the 

regional geology. 

The Ity deposits are located in the Lower Proterozoic Birimian Formations of Toulépleu-Ity 

klippe.  The Toulepleu-Ity klippe is a small remnant of Birimian in the West African Craton 

which spans ten countries, between Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, Niger and Ghana. 

Milesi et.al. (1989) and BRGM (1986, 1989), proposed a definition of the Birimian with a 

lithostratigraphic succession separated into two large groups:  

 A Lower Birimian (B1) set essentially flyschoid basin fill.  The whole basin is affected by 
three cycles of deformation: 

 D1 (2090-2100Ma) phase of major collision: duplication of the lower Proterozoic on the 
gneissic Archaean basement, a break in all B1 sedimentation and intrusion of syn-
kinematic granites;  

 D2 and D3 (2090-1970Ma) responsible for the intrusion of granites mantle between 
2080 and 1945my (D2 large sinistral offsets, related overlaps and folding; D3 dextral 
offsets and associated folds); 

 The upper Birimian (B2), volcanic-dominated, with where fluvio-deltaic formations are 
intercalated in volcano-sedimentary facies. 

Figure 7.1_1 shows a simplified geology of the West African Craton, the location of the 

principal gold and base metal deposits and the Birimian window which contains the Ity 

deposit.

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Figure 7.1_1 
Simplified Geology of the West African Craton 

 

According to Milesi et.al. (1989), the Eburnean metallogenic cycle, rich in gold and base 

metals lasted 150Ma with: 

 A first period at the time of the filling of the B1; stratiform deposits of Mn, Fe, Au, Zn-Ag 
are being put in place at about 2150Ma at the top of the stratigraphic pile.  This period 
ends with the deposition of gold mineralization in conglomerates; 

 The second, late-orogenic metallogenic period appears with the latter brittle 
deformation phases of D1 and D2.  It is marked by mesothermal mineralization, 
followed by quartz veins and paragenetic Pb-Zn-Ag-Bi deposits dated at approximately 
201Ma. 

The deposits encountered in West Africa in the Birimian are diverse.  Examples of deposit 
types are: 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 41 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Gold mineralization associated with major shear zones for example, Obuasi (AngloGold 
Ashanti/Randgold Resources) along Ashanti Fault Zone in Ghana. 

 Gold Mineralization associated with conglomerates at the base of paleo-channels 
(placers) as in the deposit at Tarkwa in Ghana (Iamgold). 

 Volcanic Massive Sulphides in the lower Birimian for example the Zinc deposit at 
Perkoa in Burkina Faso (Blackthorn Resources and Glencore International, project in 
development). 

 Sedex deposits of the Nstuta manganese mine in Ghana operated by the Ghana 
Manganese Company Limited since 1916.  Mineralization is associated with turbidites 
within a volcano-clastic terrane (van Bart, 2001). 

 Gold skarn at Ity.  Ity is the only known Au skarn in the Birimian however iron skarns 
are known in the Kéniéba-Kedougou Inlier of the Faleme District in Mali and Senegal 
(Shartz & Melcher, 2004). 

Figure 7.1_2 shows the location of the Toulépleu-Ity klippe and the location of the SMI 
permits.  Two different packages of Birimian rocks are found in the klippe. 

 On the west, plutonic and metamorphic rocks; 

 Sediments and volcano-sedimentary packages (B1) to the east. 

Birimian formations overlie the Archaean basement and were emplaced by large regional 
thrust-faulting.

The Birimian B1 formations correspond to meta-sedimentary series (pelites, gresopelites and 

carbonates) which have been subjected to greenschist-lower amphibolite facies regional 

metamorphism.  The Toulépleu-Ity klippe is oriented NE-SW.  The emplacement of diorites 

and granodiorites in the meta-carbonate sediments resulted in contact metamorphism causing 

skarn development with masses and stockworks of sulphides and magnetite containing gold 

mineralization.  These phenomena are accompanied by extensive hydrothermal alteration 

(Palanque, 2004).  Sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary formations of the Toulépleu-Ity 

klippe are part of the B1 terrane and are therefore affected by the three tectonic phases 

described previously. 

7.2 Local Geology 

The Ity area is characterized by a series of granodioritic intrusions into a sedimentary 

sequence of volcano-sediments and carbonates.  The volcanic deposits are tuffaceous with 

chemistry that ranges from basic to acidic.  All formations have been subjected to regional 

metamorphism. 

The deposits of Ity, Zia, Walter and Flotouo are skarns developed at the contacts of the 

granodiorite with the carbonates.  The Teckraie is the rock dump of the Flotouo open pit and 

sits on top of a weathered granodiorite.  The Daapleu deposit is characterized by the 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 43 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

presence of a "rhyolitic" intrusive surrounded by a package of volcanosediments.  The 

"rhyolite" is locally called "daaplite" and is leucocratic (grey to white), microgranular, schistose 

and rich in micas, essentially a fine grained granite.  The Gbeitouo deposit is in the volcano 

sediments. 

Abbreviations below represent stratigraphic codes used in the Ity database. 

7.2.1 Laterites 

Laterites are soils without texture, formed by supergene alteration of iron rich rocks and are 

generally red in colour.  Four categories have been identified on Mining Permit PE26.  The 

succession described below has been observed to be generally less than 10m thick. 

 Lateritic clays (LF) these are found at the top of the sedimentary pile and include 
limonites and the topsoil.  Residues of organic material found in this layer give the 
laterite a dark red-brick to brown colour. 

 Lateritic gravels (LG) have a brick-red to brown clay matrix (about 30% of the volume) 
and contain abundant concretions of iron oxides and hydroxides (hematite, goethite and 
magnetite) as rounded pisoliths from millimetres to centimetres in size.  Dendrites of 
manganese oxide (pyrolusite) several centimetres long coat fractures and pore spaces. 

 Mixed Laterites (LM) are similar to the gravels in appearance but have a higher 
proportion of matrix to concretions. 

 Mottled laterites (LT) vary in colour from red-orange to yellowish orange with patches 
of white kaolinite.  Rare pisoliths and traces of iron oxides are present in this layer. 

In all lateritic profiles millimetre scale fragments of magnetite and quartz are present. 

7.2.2 Saprolites (Argiles) 

The saprolites in the Ity area have a plastic texture and a grainsize of less than 2m.  The 
saprolites are designated silts, sandy silt and breccia and all retain texture of the protolith to a 

greater or lesser extent.  The saprolites are the result of supergene alteration, hydrothermal 

alteration or a combination of the two.  The facies vary in colour as a function of the protolith 

and degree of oxidation. 

Oxidized Saprolites (Argiles Oxidées AO) - are essentially oxides and hydroxides of iron 

(Fe2+ and Fe3+) which are present in a wide range of colours, yellow, orange, brick-red violet 

etc.  The oxidized saprolites are subdivided into three types, Redox front (AOR), saprolite rich 

in iron oxides and manganese (AOX) and sandy saprolites (AOS). 

Reduced Saprolites (Argiles Réduites AR) - are coloured green to white or light grey.  They 

are generally found deeper than that oxidized saprolites and correspond to the water table 

limit.  The minerals in this zone are principally kaolinite and hydrated minerals, tremolite and 

actinolite.  There is a subtype which has a higher percentage of sandy material and is 

designated ARS in the geological logs. 

In the saprolites breccias are coded BAO and BAR depending on the surrounding lithology.

7.2.3 Rock Dumps 

Rock Dumps present as oxidized saprolite breccia with a brownish orange matrix with an 

assemblage of centimetre sized clasts of different colours (orange, green, grey, whitish, 

yellow, mauve and some with granular textures) giving a multi-coloured deposit.  Various 

clasts of competent material have been identified in the dumps.  These include centimetre 

sized fragments of quartz and gravels, lateritic zones contain pisoliths and iron oxides.  In the 

northern area at Teckraie, the base of the rock dump is lined with fine grey material, 

compacted by the weight of the surrounding material.  These fine particles impregnate the 

laterites which separate the rock dump from the altered granodiorite below.  This facies is also 

in the leach pads. 

7.2.4 Daapleu Rhyolite (Daaplite, IFMD) 

The granitic intrusive at Daapleu is locally called a rhyolite as it has a fine texture.  The 

rhyolite is leucocratic (grey to white), microgranular, schistose and rich in sericite and contains 

fine-grained pyrite or magnetite disseminated and in fractures.  Numerous pink tinged silicified 

zones have been identified (possibly hematite).  Several zones of intercalated volcano-

sediments have been intersected near the edges.  The rhyolites are crossed by veins of 

quartz ± tourmaline.   

7.2.5 MetavolcanoSediments 

The volcano-sediments present are dark greyish-brown to grey-green and finely laminated.  

Minerals are primarily amphibole, chlorite, biotite, traces of magnetite, calcite as veinlets and 

fracture coatings, and quartz veins with tourmaline.  Disseminated and massive pyrite is found 

within the lamination in proximity to the daaplite contact and diminishes with depth (away from 

the contact).  In some places the metavolcanic sediments contain abundant amounts of 

calcite (ex. Borehole DA13-016). 

7.2.6 Other Lithologies 

Greenish microcrystalline carbonates (CM) with chlorite-epidote alteration, disseminated 

pyrites and magnetite (DA13-023).   

Coarse-grained grey-green mafic intrusive (IMG) composed of amphibole, magnetite and 

chlorite with fine-grained disseminated pyrite and calcite veins. 

Coarse-grained grey felsic intrusive (IFG) riche in sericite, magnetite and large straw-like 

crystals of muscovite (borehole DA13-015). 

Grey-green mafic-porphyritic intrusive (IMP) with chlorite alteration and phenocrysts of 

green amphibole (borehole DA13-023).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Introduction 

The SMI property deposits are part of a class of deposits called orogenic gold deposits.  

These can be described as gold-bearing quartz veins, stringers and wall rock replacement 

accompanied by only minor sulphides that are localized by brittle to ductile structures within 

variable rock types. 

These deposits account for up to 18% of the world's gold production, ranking them second 

only to production from placer deposits.  Deposits range in size from 0.5t to 1,600t of 

contained gold with most, typically, containing between 1t and 20t gold.  Gold grades are 

highly variable, but values of >1g/t Au for open-pit and >5g/t Au for underground operations 

can be economic.  Deposits of this type occur in various countries, including Australia, Brazil, 

DRC, Canada, Ghana, Tanzania, the USA and Zimbabwe. 

The rock types that host orogenic gold deposits are highly varied.  Orogenic gold deposits are 

hosted by rocks that have been subjected to a range of metamorphic conditions (from sub-

greenschist though to granulite facies).  However, the majority of deposits (and especially the 

larger ones) occur within rocks that have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies (within a 

metamorphic pressure-temperature regime broadly corresponding to the brittle-ductile 

transition). 

Where gold deposits have been described, the nature of the gold distribution was found to be 

highly variable between deposits.  Mineralization occurs in swarms of discontinuous veins of 

varying thickness and extent and as disseminated impregnations in sheared and altered rock.  

Gold occurs as native gold and/or associated with sulphides, with pyrite and arsenopyrite 

being the most commonly reported, however other metals such as copper and nickel can 

occur in economic quantities.  Veins follow brittle fractures, bedding planes, shear zones and 

schistosity. 

8.2 Skarn Deposits 

The following is a short description of the Ity deposit geology to indicate the style of 

mineralization at ZiaNE, Mont Ity and Walter and of the material from which the Aires and 

Teckraie dumps have been derived.  The primary difference between Mont Ity and ZiaNE 

appears to be the lack of karst development at ZiaNE due to the position of the granite in the 

footwall.  Walter is considered the North-eastern extension of Mont Ity, and is composed of a 

mix of endo- and exo-skarns developed at the interface between the carbonate and the 

granodiorite. 

The interpreted section (Figure 8.2_1) is situated in the centre of the Zia NE and Mont Ity 

deposit.  In this section four types of mineralization are seen. 

 Skarns in fresh rock; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 47 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Reduced saprolites; 

 Oxidized saprolites; 

 Laterites. 

The skarn corresponds to a sulphur rich skarn (pyrite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite, 3-10%) with 

accessory magnetite.  These mineralized zones form discontinuous, sub parallel lenses at the 

contact with the granodiorite.  In the north part of the deposit economic grades and 

thicknesses were intercepted in the boreholes from the 2013 campaign.  The sulphide 

mineralization was intersected in the carbonates and the granodiorite at ZiaNE and is 

continuous with the mineralization in the oxidized portions of the skarn. 

The mineralized portions of the reduced saprolites correspond to the skarns which have been 

oxidized and have had the carbonates dissolved.  These are rocks rich in chlorite, tremolite 

and/or actinolite.  The sulphides are partially oxidized.  The reduced saprolites are the 

transition zone between the oxidized material and the fresh rock. 

The oxidized saprolites form the major part of the mineralization at Mont Ity.  The 

mineralization was originally a skarn which has undergone severe supergene alteration.  The 

alteration was enhanced by the dissolution of the sulphides.  The alteration was responsible 

for the generation of karst into which the saprolite material collapsed.  This is the explanation 

for the geometry of the deposit.  The laterites have historically been mined at Mont Ity and are 

found in a small zone in the southeast of the pit. 

 

Figure 8.2_1 
Schematic Geological Section of the Mont Ity deposit. 

 

The Mont Ity deposit is an unusual deposit not only because Proterozoic skarn deposits are 

rare but because the supergene alteration has completely changed the deposit geometry.  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 48 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Figure 8.2_2 shows the Mont Ity deposit as interpreted before the supergene alteration.  The 

primary mineralization is found in the endo- and exoskarn.  The mineralized zones is found as 

discontinuous, sub parallel lenses in contact with the granodiorite and carbonates  The 

primary Au (Cu-Mo-Ag-Zn) is associated with the intrusion of the granodiorite.  The intrusion 

of the granodiorite is accompanied by the emplacement of a dyke of similar composition in the 

carbonates. 

 

Figure 8.2_2 
Interpreted Pre-alteration Stage of the Ity Deposit 

 

 

The first stage of supergene alteration is characterized by the infiltration of meteoric water.  

The meteoric water reacted with the sulphide rich mineralization, especially in the massive 

sulphide zones.  Oxidation of the pyrite in an aqueous solution generates sulphuric acid.  The 

acid then reacts with the host carbonate.  The Fe is found as goethite, ferrihydrite and other 

Fe-Mn oxides.  The dissolution of the carbonated results in the formation of CO2 and voids. 

Oxidation of the sulphides results in the dissolution of the adjacent carbonates and creates 

cavities (Figure 8.2_3).  The instability in the system causes the collapse of the mineralized 

zone into these karsts.  The carbonates and the calcsilicates zones in the skarns were not 

pure calcite.  This results in the formation of different decarbonized clays.  The well 

mineralized zones in the karst are described a zones rich in iron and magnesium oxides, the 

products of the oxidation of the primary mineralization.  This oxidation was accompanied by a 

loss of volume in the mineralized zones resulting in an enrichment of the gold.

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 49 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 

Figure 8.2_3 
Schematic Diagram of the First Phase of Alteration 

 

The alteration process became self-propagating as the oxidation front went deeper.  The 

dissolution became deeper and collapse followed.  Erosion and laterization affected the upper 

parts of the deposit.  The laterite zones rich in gold in the southwest of the pit are probably 

oxidised clays which collapsed as erosion removed the surface and were themselves 

laterized.  Such a phenomenon would explain the lack of root zone in the mineralization.  This 

also implies that there is a lack of mobility of the gold in the laterites at Mont Ity. 

8.3 Shear Zone Deposits 

The Daapleu and Gbeitouo deposits resemble typical shear zone deposits of the West African 

granite-greenstone terrane.  The deposit itself is associated with a major regional shear zone 

but is developed on a secondary structure (Figure 7.1_1 and 7.1_2).  The host-rock lithologies 

can be any form of sediment, carbonate or igneous rock with the main feature being a shear 

zone between two contrasting lithologies.  Mineralization may also be spatially related to the 

emplacement of intrusives.  The gold mineralization is mesothermal in origin and occurs as 

free gold in quartz vein stockworks and zones of silicification, associated with arsenopyrite 

and to a lesser extent pyrite and antimony.  Depending on the geological terrane other metals 

may be associated with the gold and arsenic. 

The gold mineralization is found in linear zones in or near the contacts between two different 

rock types.  The contacts show evidence of shearing.  Alteration is weak to severe depending 

on the development of the system. 

The Daapleu deposit is hosted at the contact of the granitic intrusive and the volcano-

sediments and within the intrusive itself.  The Gbeitouo deposit is mostly hosted in meta-

volcanosediments is considered to be a structurally controlled deposit similar to Daapleu.

9 EXPLORATION 

The Aires de Lixiviation are residues of a heap leach operation, Verse Ouest is a rock dump 

and Teckraie is a rock dump of the Flotouo open pit.  No exploration has been done over 

these areas.  Walter and Gbeitouo have been assessed in historical campaigns and most 

recently in 2013-2014.  ZiaNE is on the Ity Gold Mine property and has been assessed in 

historical campaigns and most recently in 2015.  Mont Ity is an operational mine and has been 

assessed in historical campaigns or more recently by drilling.  All recent evaluation has been 

in the form of drilling and is detailed in Section 10. 

Daapleu has been the subject of both historical evaluation and recent work in 2013 and 2104.  

Such work is described in detail in Kone and Furic, 2014 and summarized below. 

 No soil or stream sediment sampling has been undertaken on the property in the latest 
exploration campaign. 

 No trenches or pits have been dug for mapping and sampling. 

 No geophysical surveys have been undertaken in this exploration campaign. 

 Mapping and prospecting consists of mapping and sampling of the artisanal workings at 
Daapleu in October and November 2013.  Mapping of the pits was to establish the 
chemical signature of the mineralization, structural control on the mineralization and to 
map the lithological contacts. 

Sampling was in the form of grab samples horizontal channel samples and vertical channel 

samples.  Some evidence of the horizontal sampling was still in existence the time of the site 

visit by Coffey.  Most of the sampling evidence has been destroyed by mining or erosion. 

The following are general observations for the pit mapping. 

Brick-red lateritic gravels cover most of the area mapped.  Thickness does not exceed 3m.  

They cover a thin zone of red saprolites.  Mauve coloured sandy saprolites were encountered 

in all three pits.  They are interpreted as either altered mafic intrusives or as altered meta-

volcano-sediments.  Yellow sandy saprolite with sericite is common in the material extracted.

10 DRILLING 

Due to the large number of boreholes drilled and samples taken it is not feasible to record all 

intersections.  The reader is referred to Section 14, Mineral Resource Estimates for 

representative sections and distributions of gold values. 

Drilling procedures referred to in this section are for the drilling campaigns 2013-2015.  All 

other drilling is considered historical as it was done by a previous owner.  Methodologies 

would not necessarily have been the same.  Historical information is discussed under Data 

Verification (Section 12). 

10.1 Drilling Methods 

Drilling methods used by the drilling contractors follow generally accepted industry practice.  

AirCore drilling was not in progress at the time of the sites visits and no assessment has been 

made.  Diamond drilling (DD) was in progress on Mining Permit PE26 at Walter during the 

2014 site visit and on Daapleu and Ity Flat area the 2015 site visit.  There are no specific 

procedures manuals relating to the actual drilling as this is the responsibility of the drilling 

contractor. 

Drilling was observed and the following general comments apply.  The drilling equipment 

appeared to be in good repair, the drilling team appeared to be experienced and familiar with 

the equipment.  Technicians on site worked fluently and appeared to be well trained.  The 

sites were well ordered, clean and set up so that there was enough space to work safely. 

SMI has a comprehensive procedures document that describes the standards procedures for 

both diamond drilling and reverse-circulation (RC) drilling (Conventional and AirCore) at the 

drill site.  The manuals suggest site layouts and give procedures and examples of the 

handling of samples, marking of boxes, cores, chipbags and boxes etc. The general 

procedures for RC, AirCore and DD are shown in Figure 10.1_1 and general procedures for 

DD are shown in Figure 10.1_2.   

Core is boxed, marked and oriented at the drill rig.  Friable core is packed in plastic to 

minimized loss during transport and handling.  Meterage is measured, recorded and recovery 

calculated at the drill site.  Once drilling is completed the site is cleared, sumps drained and 

boreholes marked with PVC pipe with all relevant borehole information. 

RC samples are collected in bags and either spilt on site (older drilling) or split in the core 

shed (newer drilling).  Reference samples are stored in chip trays for logging. 

A summary of the drilling for all eight deposits is given in Table 10.1_1. 

In Gbeitouo, only the South-Western half has been estimated.  Three of the diamond 

boreholes, most of RAB drilling, and a large part of historical drillings were therefore not 

included in the mineral resource estimate.

10.2 Other Sources of Data Used for Resource Definition 

No other sources of subsurface data were used in the mineral resource estimation.  

Topography is affected by the underlying geology and artisanal workings on the surface 

expressions of the mineralization.  Both the topography and artisanal workings along with 

geological maps, where available, were used to verify the geological and mineralization 

models at Daapleu and ZiaNE. 

10.3 Surveying 

10.3.1 Borehole Collars 

All borehole collars are sited and checked by DGPS by qualified staff.  Some Daapleu drilling 

is visible in satellite images.  Collar positions were plotted on the satellite images to verify 

positions and the coordinate transformations applied.  Collars plot where expected.  

Elevations are compared to the topographic survey and can be corrected if necessary.  

Positions appear to be accurate. 

10.3.2 Downhole Surveying 

Deviations on diamond and reverse circulation boreholes at Daapleu were measured using 

the Reflex EZ SHOTTM system.  The first measurement is between 10 and 15m to verify the 

inclination and orientation of the borehole.  Measurement is taken at 25m intervals for the first 

100m then at 50m intervals until the end of borehole.  The last measurement is at the end of 

the borehole.  Orientation of the core was undertaken on fresh rock using the ACTII system 

with measurements approximately every 30m.

A full procedures manual for downhole surveying including a quality control/verification 

procedure has been prepared by SMI. 

Coffey did not observe any surveying as there were no boreholes at the drilling stage where 

surveying was possible.  However the database was interrogated and where anomalies were 

found the data was either corrected or removed. 

Three boreholes at the Aires were checked for deviation from vertical.  No significant deviation 

was found and all boreholes are considered to be similar.  Aircore boreholes are not surveyed 

as the side walls are not stable.  Boreholes are shallow and no significant deviation is 

expected. 

10.3.3 Surface Topography 

Surface topography for the Daapleu, Verse Ouest, Zia, Walter is from a Lidar survey over both 

Mining Permit PE26 and PR61. 

Surface topography of the Aires and Teckraie, Mont Ity and Gbeitouo are from surface 

surveys by the SMI survey staff.  Survey data is collected in MARREC system used at the 

mine and converted to UTM-WGS84.  The conversion system is documented and is available 

from the mine. 

10.4 Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau) 

Drilling and survey procedures observed are to acceptable industry standards, are appropriate 

to the deposits being drilled and are appropriate for mineral resource estimation. 

10.5 Qualified Person's Comments (Bosc) 

Walter and Gbeitouo still have a large proportion of historical boreholes for their mineral 

resource estimates.  Historical drilling was poorly documented between 2002 and 2012. 

Sufficient additional drilling allowed verification of historic drilling for use in industry standard 

resource estimates.  Drilling practices from 2012 onward were all documented and regularly 

assessed by independent senior consultants and are to acceptable industry standards, are 

appropriate to the deposits being drilled and are appropriate for mineral resource estimation.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling 

Sampling of all SMI projects follows the same protocols.  The processes described below 

applies to all four project areas for drilling campaigns of 2013-2014 and any resampling of 

historical drilling during this period.  SMI has procedures manuals which document all 

sampling protocols in detail.  In addition regular monitoring of sampling procedures is 

undertaken to ensure compliance and to make changes any procedures that may not be 

appropriate for the intended outcomes of the exploration programme. 

11.1.1 Diamond Core Samples 

The sampling procedures are documented in standard procedures manuals.  The following is 

a summary of the main features; 

 Sample lengths should be between 0.5 and 1.5m; 

 There is a procedure for dealing with loss zones, ground core etc; 

 Intact core is cut with a diamond saw; friable core is cut with a blade; 

 Specific formats for marking core and sample bags are laid out. 

11.1.2 RC Samples 

The sampling procedures are documented in standard procedures manuals.  The sample 

splitting procedure at the rig or at the sample preparation facility for RC samples is presented 

in Figure 11.1.2_1.

It is noted that SMI does not use a cyclone splitter to collect the samples but rather splits 

manually.  It is also noted that a three stage splitter is used to reduce the samples.   

Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau): The splitting equipment was discussed with SMI 

exploration staff and the reasons for not using a splitter mounted on the cyclone.  Equipment 

quality, availability and wet samples appeared to be the main problem.  Manual splitting can 

lead to sample bias especially with the three stage splitter which are not always manufactured 

or assembled correctly.  Problems generally are lack of good alignment of the three splitters, 

poor levelling and fatigue in the technical staff are the main contributors to biased sampling.  

SMI appears to be aware of the problem and has the correct equipment. 

11.1.3 Sample Preparation 

Sample preparation facilities were inspected in May 2014 by K. Body and April 2015 by 

M Mudau.  Sample preparation facilities were set up in early 2014 and comments below apply 

to these facilities.  Assay methods are discussed in Section 11.3. 

Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau):  SMI has established a sample preparation facility 

on site for the preparation of exploration samples for analysis.  This facility is separate from 

the mine sampling and testing facility.  The QP did not visit Bureau Veritas (BV) in Abidjan but 

did visit the site facility to view the preparation process. 

 The facility is an open air facility but with closed sections for the splitting and millings 
stages; 

 Core cutting is in a separate room that does not open onto the preparation facility; 

 Equipment is new and appears in good repair; 

 Staff appear to be well trained and could explain, with understanding, the processes 
they were carrying out and the potential sources of error; 

 Errors in insertion of quality control standards continue to occur however steps are 
being put in place to reduce the potential for error; 

 Supervision by experience exploration staff is necessary to ensure that procedures are 
followed; 

 The 2015 site visit noted some housekeeping issues.  Recommendations have been 
made to SMI to address the problems of dust in the open air portion of the facility. 

Qualified Person's Comments (Bosc): Walter and Gbeitouo databases contain historical 

samples, which, until 2012, were processed and assayed on-site.  Historical sample 

preparation documentation shows a number of similarities with later sample preparation.  

Quality and repeatability has been carefully assessed by samples from historical boreholes re-

submitted as umpire samples to an accredited laboratory with fire-assay with recent drilling 

campaigns.  

From 2012 to 2104, half core and split-RC samples were submitted to Bureau Veritas in 

Abidjan, who performed all sample preparation and assay with procedures similar to other 

gold projects in the region.

11.2 Assaying 

SMI uses four analysis techniques on the samples from the exploration programmes.  Fire 

Assay with an Atomic Absorption finish is the primary technique for gold.  Three other 

methods are used depending on the gold grades.  Full assay certificates are provided by the 

laboratories. 

Fire Assay (BV code FA450) –Nominal 50g charge analysed.  Silver used as secondary 

collector, Au is determined with AAS finish.  Samples are analysed at the Abidjan facility. 

ICP-ES (BVcode ACQ300) is carried out at the Acme labs facility in Vancouver for samples 

greater than 0.5 g/t Au 

Fire Assay with gravimetric finish (BV FA550) is carried out on all samples with grade 

greater than 30g/t 

ICP- multi-element analysis by Aqua Regia digest for 36 elements is done for samples of 

greater than 0.5g/t Au by AMCE laboratories in Vancouver Canada.  It must be noted that 

Aqua Regia is a partial digest and major elements are not used for whole rock analysis. 

Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau): Assay methods are appropriate for the deposit 

types encountered on the property.  The full suite of boreholes for Daapleu has not been 

analysed for minor and major elements and not all of the ICP assay results were available at 

the time of the mineral resource estimation.  Of the results analysed only arsenic as was 

useful for defining the mineralized zones at Daapleu.  No ICP results were available for the 

other deposits.  Usefulness of ICP results for other deposits is still to be assessed. 

11.3 Other Samples - Verification Assays 

Samples from historical boreholes have been taken for analysis to verify the accuracy of the 

assays.  Historical sampling from Daapleu appears to be accurate and can be used in mineral 

resource estimation.  Where samples have been rejected the samples along with reasons 

have been recorded in the exploration database. 

Historical boreholes from ZiaNE have been reanalysed.  The verification exercise showed that 

historical assays done at the SMI laboratory at the time are unreliable.  There was no 

correlation between the historical assays and the verification assays.  To this extent all 

boreholes have been reanalysed and these new assays used for the mineral resource 

estimation. 

11.4 Bulk Densities 

11.4.1 Methodologies 

Bulk densities have only been measured on core for all deposits.  Measurements have been 

taken according the SMI procedures manual.  For the 2015 drilling campaign the procedures 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 59 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

manual has been extensively edited.  However the actual measurement procedures have not 

changed. 

SMI uses various methodologies to measure density.  The method chosen depends on the 

type of material.  Three general methods are used, described as hydrostatic, filled volume 

and volume displacement. 

The hydrostatic method is used for whole core and consists of taking measurement of the 

mass of the core in air and suspended in water.  The density is calculated as a ratio of the dry 

weight: difference dry wright and suspended weight. 

The filled volume method is used for unconsolidated material from core or RC drilling.  In 

this method a container of known mass is filled, lightly compacted and weighed.  The density 

is calculated as the ratio of Mass:volume.  

The volume displacement method uses a graduated cylinder filled to a set volume.  The 

piece or pieces of rock are immersed in the water and the change in volume recorded.  The 

density is calculated as the mass of the rock:change in volume.  This method has a large error 

due to the lack of accuracy of the graduated cylinder used for measurement.  This method is 

only used where the other two methods are not feasible. 

Porous samples are covered with plastic wrap (food grade) or paraffin wax before immersion 

in water.  Procedures are set out in the manual for calculating densities if the sample is wet or 

covered with paraffin wax. 

Densities are normally measured on dry samples.  Where samples are not dried, this is 

documented and a separate calculation is used.   

11.4.2 Deposit Densities 

Densities statistics are presented for each deposit in Section 14. 

11.4.3 Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau) 

The QP has reviewed the various methods for measuring and calculating density.  The 

methods used are reasonable and there are several methods available which are considered 

appropriate for the material being measured.  Because the samples are small, errors will be 

fairly common.  It has been suggested to the site geologists that a bulk density be calculated 

per box from the nominal drilling diameter, length of core and weight of core as a check 

against densities measurements on small pieces.  SMI has scales that can measure the larger 

weighs of full boxes. 

A second bulk method for RC samples is to plot the histogram of the RC full sample 

weights/m3 recovered and assess the statistical distribution of the samples.  Where recoveries 

are high the mean gives a good estimate of the density of the rock drilled.

11.5 Analytical Quality Control (QA/QC) Procedures and Data 

11.5.1 Introduction 

A quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) programme was undertaken.  The QA/QC 

programme identifies various aspects of the results that could have negatively influenced the 

subsequent mineral resource estimate.  It is possible to identify samples that have been 

swapped, missing samples, and incorrect labelling amongst other aspects. 

The QA/QC aims to confirm both the precision and accuracy of the laboratory and thereby 

confirm that the data used in the mineral resource estimate is of sufficient quality. 

The control samples used during the campaigns on the Aires, Teckraie, Verse Ouest, 

Daapleu, ZiaNe and Mont Ity project areas contained within this report comprised of 

standards, blanks and field duplicates.  The intended aim should be approximately 5% 

coverage for standards, blanks and duplicates.  The quality control data was analysed on an 

on-going basis and generated some queries with the laboratory.   

Definition of terms related to the QA/QC protocols applied and subsequent evaluations are 

provided below: 

A standard is a reference sample with a known (statistically) element abundance and 

standard deviation (certified independently).  Reference standards are used to gauge the 

accuracy of analytical reporting by comparing the pre-determined values to those reported by 

the analytical laboratory used during an exploration project. 

A blank is a standard with abundance of the element of interest below the level of detection of 

the analytical technique (certified independently). 

A duplicate/replicate is the split of a sample taken at a particular stage of the sampling 

process; e.g. Field Duplicate. 

Certified Standards – Client 

Commercial reference standards sourced from three different manufacturers 

Standards – Laboratory 

Commercial reference standards sourced from three different manufacturers 

Field Duplicates Diamond Core – Client 

Field duplicates are a split of the unprocessed sample- quarter core in the case of diamond 

drill boreholes.  The aim of which is to assess the total sampling error. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 61 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Field Duplicates RC – Client 

Field duplicates are a split of the unprocessed sample- a split off of the original sample 

collected from the drilling rig.  The aim of which is to assess the total sampling error.  This is 

routinely done every 50 samples.   

Coarse Reject Duplicates – Client 

Coarse rejects are taken on the split after the first crush.  Normally undertaken at the sample 

preparation site.  This is routinely done every 50 samples.   

Coarse Reject Duplicates – Laboratory 

Coarse rejects are taken on the split after the first crush.  Coarse rejects are taken by the 

Bureau Veritas laboratory to check their own sample preparation. 

Pulp Duplicates ("B" sample) – Client 

Routinely done every 50 samples. 

Pulp Duplicates ("B" sample) – Laboratory 

Pulp duplicates are taken by the laboratory to check their own systems.  The frequency varies 

but appears to be a minimum of five per batch at Bureau Veritas, Abidjan. 

Repeat Assays (Same Pulp) – Laboratory 

Routinely done. 

Umpire and Check Assaying 

Check assaying, where pulp rejects are submitted to a second, independent laboratory, has 

been undertaken on all historical drilling especially where a recognised commercial laboratory 

was not used.  Umpire assays have not been performed on the current drilling. 

11.5.2 Quality Control Assessment 

Quality control monitoring protocols involved submission of blanks, duplicates and certified 

reference standards with the core sample batches.  These control samples were inserted 

within the samples in a systematic manner on each project area.  During different campaigns 

on these project areas the duplicates have comprised of a quarter split of the core, a coarse 

split or a pulp.  A total of 18 different standards have been used of varying grades.  A 

summary of the expected values for all these standards can be seen in Table 11.5.2_1.  The 

standards were supplied by Geostats, Gannet Holdings and Rock Labs of Australia.  Two 

different sources of blank material were used, beach sand and coarse rock chips that were 

confirmed to not contain any Au.  All assays for the most recent exploration campaigns were 

done by Bureau Veritas laboratory, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.  In addition to the above, six 

batches of samples were sent to ALS Chemex, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso as umpire

11.5.3 Qualified Person's Comments (Mudau) 

In general the results of the assays were within in acceptable limits.  Standards which return 

values within acceptable limits, usually two standard deviations, more than 90% of the time 

are considered to indicate accurate assays.  Only four standards had greater than the number 

of fails in batches.  Two of these have very low grades, <=0.5g/t, and the poor performance is 

attributed to the poor accuracy of the assay method at these concentrations.  Of the two other 

standards, G998_01 and ST502, G998-01 falls within acceptable limits 85% of the time but 

ST504 was outside limits 50% of the time.  This standard generally performed poorly and it is 

considered that the standard itself was the problem and not the analytical method.  This 

standard is no longer used.  Minor sporadic contamination is evident in some blanks with 14 

samples returning grades above 0.5ppm.  This contamination, whilst minor, should be closely 

monitored with the laboratory. 

Of all duplicate pairs 81% are within 20% HARD precision limits.  Many duplicate pairs can be 

identified as fails.  It is not unexpected that the precision slightly poor even once all samples 

below ten times the detection limit have been removed.  A number of duplicate samples 

submitted were quarter core rather than a split of the original after initial crushing which 

provides a poor comparison.  It is also understood that all project areas except Daapleu 

contain coarse gold and therefore a high nugget effect is likely.  With this in mind the precision 

of the assay results is deemed acceptable however it is suggested that the obvious outright 

fails be checked in case of sample transposition. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 64 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Only 509 samples have been submitted for Umpire analysis.  The samples were selected 

from Mont Ity and ZiaNE project areas and were submitted in two batches during the 2013 

campaign.  The comparison between the two laboratories is very poor with only 48% of the 

data falling within 10% HARD precision limits.  In order to complete Umpire analysis correctly 

the pulp tested at the primary laboratory should be re-submitted to the umpire laboratory.  

From the data regarding the umpire samples it is not clear if this was done.  Some samples 

are identified as pulps others are not and appear to have been created from the reject 

material and crushed and pulverised before being sent to the umpire laboratory.  However, 

even if the precision limit is increased to 20% approximately 70% fall within acceptable limits.  

These samples are not acceptable as umpire samples and the results should be rejected.   

The quality control program has improved in the last three years.  SMI has migrated to an 

Acquire database for its data management and all quality control analyses are routinely run 

using the built-in analysis routines.  In general the quality control programme is well managed 

on the sample collection, preparation and analytical side.  The lack umpire of samples is a 

significant gap in the programme.  The analytical results presented for use in the mineral 

resource estimation are considered to be within the acceptable limits of accuracy and 

precision for the deposits being evaluated.   

11.5.4 Quality Control for Walter (Bosc) 

During the 2013 campaign, quality control procedures involved the systematically insertion of 

blanks, certified standards and duplicates which represent about 20% of the total samples 

(Table 11.5.2_3).  All assays were done by fire assay by Bureau Veritas laboratory, Abidjan, 

Côte d'Ivoire.   

There were two kinds of blank: (i) beach sand collected close to Abidjan (190 samples); (ii) 

granite from SISAG quarry in Attinguié (198 samples).  They were previously tested and were 

confirmed barren.  Only two blank samples were contaminated (0.5% of total blanks) during 

Walter samples analyses.  Three standards provided by Geostats Pty were used: G310-10, 

G909-8 and G912-1.  Refer to Table 11.5.2_1 for expected values.   

Three hundred and one (301) standard samples were used for Walter study and only seven of 

them were anomalous (2.3% of total standard samples), probably due to transposition.  Three 

hundred and fifty four (354) "field duplicates" were collected as quarter core.   

The pair results showed important dispersion linked to gold inherent variability, but still the 

correlation was good with no visible sampling errors.  The Rank HARD plot was established 

using Au values higher than 0.3ppm and indicated that 28% of the data had a HARD higher 

than 20% representing a medium repeating quality.  Still it can be explained by the gold 

inherent variability.  In 2014, five drill holes from the 2008 campaign were re-assayed with 

quarter cores and by fire assay by Bureau Veritas laboratory in Abidjan, representing 4.5% of 

the total campaign samples.  Twenty two percent (22%) of the samples analysed were quality 

control samples (blank, standard, duplicate).  Good repeatability was observed although there 

was still some dispersion issue due to gold inherent variability.  The analytical results 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 65 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

presented for use in the mineral resource estimation are considered to be within the 

acceptable limits of accuracy and precision for the deposits being evaluated.   

11.5.5 Quality Control for Gbeitouo (Bosc) 

During the 2013 campaign, quality control procedures involved the systematically insertion of 

one blank, one certified standard and one duplicate about every 25 samples (Table 11.5.2_3).  

All assays were done by fire assay by Bureau Veritas laboratory, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.  The 

blank was made of beach sand that had not been tested and certified by an external 

laboratory at the time of the study.  It was used to test the contamination during pulverisation 

and gave generally gold values lower than 0.05ppm. However minor contamination was 

noticed with values between 0.1ppm and 0.2ppm. The standards that were used were 

supplied by Geostats Pty and are G901-7, G397-3, G909-5 and G998-1.  Refer to 

Table 11.5.2_1 for expected values.  

The results of the analyses indicated that the high-value standard (G901-8) systematically 

showed a positive bias which was considered acceptable as sulphides-rich layers were 

scarce. The other standards were most of the time within the -2stddev / +2stddev range 

showing that the laboratory analyses were of good quality. The duplicates were obtained 

using two separate quarters of core, belonging to the right half of the initial core.  The 

analytical results presented for use in the mineral resource estimation are considered to be 

within the acceptable limits of accuracy and precision for the deposits being evaluated.   

11.6 Data Management 

11.6.1 Database 

Historically data management was done through used of a custom built database using public 

domain software as a base.  This was used during previous campaigns to address the need 

for some form of standard data capture.  The author was not a professional programmer or 

database expert and while useful, the software has failings.  SMI migrated to the AcQuire 

database software in 2014.  This is a widely used commercial database that is especially 

appropriate to operations such as SMI.  Validation of historical data has been undertaken by 

SMI with reviews by Coffey and Arethuse over the last few years.  All historical data has been 

migrated and validated in this new system.  The software is still new to SMI and modifications 

to some portions of the database may be needed.  More operator training is also needed.   

11.6.2 Borehole Logging 

Borehole logging uses standard logging templates and codes.  Logging protocols are given in 

the exploration procedures manuals. 

11.6.3 Sampling Records 

Sample logging uses standard templates and procedures compatible with the working 

database software.  Protocols are defined in the relevant procedures manuals.

11.6.4 Sample Storage 

Sample storage for all drilling is at the SMI exploration camp at the Ity Gold Mine.  The core 

storage facilities were catalogued in 2014/2015 to assist in housekeeping and easy access of 

the borehole samples or cores.  Core is stored in either wooden boxes or metal trays.  RC 

samples are stored in containers with shelving installed.  Two archive samples are stored, 

washed samples in chip trays and an archive sample taken at the drill rig before sample 

preparation. 

Pulps are retrieved from the analytical laboratory and stored in containers in boxes.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Site Visit 

All Coffey site visits were undertaken between 20 and 28 May 2014 (Body, 2014) and 

between 12 and 21 April 2015 (Mudau, 2015).  Amongst numerous visits, ARETHUSE 

specifically performed two assessments of exploration procedures in February and October 

2013.  One of the objectives was to verify data used in the mineral resource estimation.  

Aspects of the drilling and borehole identification are discussed in Sections 10.  Assay and 

sampling have been discussed in Sections 11.  Additional verification was made by random 

selection of boreholes from Daapleu, Mont Ity, ZiaNE, the Aires, Teckraie and Verse Ouest to 

check the accuracy of logging and data records.  Boreholes were chosen from different areas 

of the deposits.  Some of the boreholes chosen were twins of diamond core and RC drilling.  

Borehole logging is acceptable and rock identification between diamond core and RC chips is 

consistent.  However, some boreholes from Mont Ity and Daapleu need to be relogged 

because there are logging errors.  This has been communicated to the SMI geologists.

Comparison of RC and Diamond Core Twins 

 

 

12.2 Historical Data Validation 

There is a large volume of data collected from various exploration programmes prior to the 

current programmes, which began in 2013.  In converting this data to electronic format 

substantial validation of the data has been done to confirm consistency and accuracy.  

Accuracy and completeness of record keeping, logging, surveys and assays have been 

assessed in the validation procedures.

All data that has been validated to date has validation codes attached to them in the 

database.  Where there are multiple data sets of the same type the data sets are ranked on 

accuracy and a preferred data is recorded for use in geological modelling and mineral 

resource estimation.  Assay procedures have been evaluated for accuracy.  Assays have 

been validated for individual campaigns, laboratories and methods.  Validation has included 

reassaying of many of the older boreholes.  Where data is found to be accurate, the historical 

data is flagged for use.  In the case of ZiaNE, reassaying of historical boreholes showed the 

assays to be inaccurate and the entire borehole set was reassayed. 

Independent audits and reviews have been undertaken by both Coffey and Arethuse since 

2013.  Validation exercises are extensively documented in SMI reports as well as mineral 

resource estimation reports by Arethuse and Coffey. 

12.3 Off-Site Data Validation 

Off-site data validation by Coffey and Arethuse includes:- 

 Quality control analysis to identify any irregularities. 

 Comparison of twin boreholes. 

The findings of the quality control results are discussed in Section 11 and the twin borehole 

drilling below. 

12.3.1 Aires 

Four diamond drill boreholes were drilled by SMI to verify the results obtained from the initial 

RC drilling.  This drilling enabled a comparison to be made between the two different types of 

drilling undertaken and the variability of mineralization over a short distance.   

The twin borehole drilling although limited to four boreholes confirmed that the mineralization 

is fairly well defined by the RC drilling.  From the limited data the average grade of the dump 

decreased in two twin diamond drilled boreholes and mean grade increased in two, compared 

to the original RC drilling.  The RC average grade for all 196 samples within the four 

mineralized zones was 1.16g/t compared to 0.94g/t for the diamond drilling a difference of 

23%.  The difference in grade is attributed to the high nugget nature of gold mineralization and 

one outlier of 52.7g/t returned for borehole S831 from 0m to 1m, which was not replicated in 

the twin borehole S1372.  Capping the outlier to 15.6g/t as per Section 2.7, the average grade 

is reduced to 0.96g/t or a 2% difference between the original borehole and the twinned 

borehole. 

12.3.2 Verse Ouest 

No boreholes were twinned at Verse Ouest.

12.3.3 Teckraie 

Twelve diamond drill boreholes were drilled by SMI to verify the results obtained from the RC 

drilling at Teckraie.  This drilling enabled a comparison to be made between the two different 

types of drilling and the variability of mineralization over a short distance.  Comparisons of the 

original boreholes compared to the twin boreholes are presented below Figure 12.3.3_1.   

The comprehensive twin drilling confirmed that the mineralization is fairly well defined by the 

RC drilling.  From the data, the average grade of the dump decreased in seven twin diamond 

drilled boreholes while the remaining five increased in grade.  The difference in grade 

between the individual twin samples is attributed to the random construction of the dump and 

the high nugget nature of gold mineralization.  There however appears a bias at the upper 

assay grades, with higher grade outliers associated with the diamond drilling.  For example an 

assay grade of 72.0g/t Au was returned for borehole S905 at 20m to 21m which was not 

replicated in the original borehole.  This difference is attributed to the different drilling and 

sampling methodologies applied, with the air drilling results tending to be smoothed in 

comparison to the core drilling.  This is not regarded as critical for the mineral resource 

estimation and has been partly addressed by high grade capping (Section 14.2.7) 

 

Figure 12.3.3_1 
Teckraie 

Twin Borehole Drilling Comparison 

 

12.3.4 Daapleu 

RC boreholes were drilled by SMI in 2013 to verify the results obtained from the initial 

diamond drilling undertaken in 1997.  This drilling enabled a comparison to be made between 

the two different types of drilling undertaken and the variability of mineralization over a short 

distance.  A comparison of the original boreholes and the twin boreholes is presented in 

Figure 12.3.4_1. 

From the data there is a moderate to good correlation between the original and current drilling 

for three of the four twin boreholes with the fourth (DA13-039 and S162) displaying a 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 70 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

moderate to poor correlation.  The average grade of the deposit was lower in three of the four 

original boreholes compared to the current RC drilling.  One sample of 64.43g/t Au returned 

for borehole DA13-038 was not replicated in the original borehole S167, although high grades 

in excess of 10g/t Au were obtained in close proximity to the outlier.  The difference in grade 

between the individual twin samples is attributed to the high nugget nature of gold 

mineralization, the boreholes not being exact twins and the mineralization being slightly off set 

between boreholes e.g. DA13-047 and S164.

Twin Borehole Drilling Comparison 

 

12.3.5 ZiaNE 

No twin borehole comparison is available for Zia Northeast.  Data used for the estimation is 

from the 2014 and 2015 drilling campaign.  Assay data from the 2008 drilling campaign has 

been assessed deemed unreliable and has been replaced with the results of the reassay, in 

2014, of all of these cores. 

12.3.6 Mont Ity 

There are seven diamond boreholes were drilled to confirm the results obtained from the RC 

samples.  Overall, the boreholes compare favourably.  Due to nuggety nature of gold and the 

separation between boreholes of up to 10m, some variation is expected between boreholes 

but the width of the mineralized zone and major trends in the mineralization are expected to 

be similar.   

12.3.7 Walter 

There are five twin borehole sets at Walter.  One set of RC/diamond boreholes from 2008 

drilling over a 60m interval, two pairs from the 2008 twinned with 2013-14 drilling campaigns 

and another two sets of RC/Diamond from the 2013-2014 campaign.  The boreholes from the 

2008 campaign show a highly variable mineralization in the weathered zone.  But the higher 

grade zone below 20m has similar trends in both boreholes.   



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 71 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

In the set comparing the 2008 and 2013 drilling the following comments are made: 

 Mineralized zones are all defined by a 0.5g/t cut-off, but will present distinct grade 
variation within the same mineralised envelope; 

 The very high grade interval in S1162 is absent from its twin W08-577BIS.  These 
boreholes are 5m apart; 

 The grades are generally lower for the 2008 boreholes suggesting a possible under 
estimation of the grades from these boreholes. 

The twin boreholes drilled in the 2013-2014.  There is some offset in the high grades between 

the boreholes.  But they show a good correlation between the RC and diamond results.  The 

better similarity between the RC/Diamond of the 3013-2014 campaign can be explained by 

the smaller distance separating the boreholes than in the other campaigns. 

The offsets of mineralization and variation in grades is similar to that seen at Daapleu 

(Figure 12.3.4_1) 

12.3.8 Gbeitouo 

An extensive validation exercise has been undertaken to assess the accuracy of historical 

data and correct errors where possible.  Errors were found in most of the data sets.   

 Collars were projected to the topographic surface where no elevations were recorded or 
errors in the elevation were found; 

 Grid survey coordinates were converted to UTM; 

 Where no downhole surveys were available, the inclination of the collar was taken for 
the entire hole; 

 Minor errors were corrected in the logging and density sampling; 

 Cleaning of the assay data to correct errors in records and assign below detection limit 
codes. 

In spite of the cleaning and correction the quality of the data is only sufficient for, at most, 

Indicated Mineral Resources.  This is primarily due to the large amount of historical data in the 

data set.  Since this review was done, SMI has migrated data into a good quality database 

using commercial software and has undertaken extensive validation of the historical data. 

There are 19 sets of twin boreholes to compare the 2008 and 2013 campaigns.   

The mineralized zone is well defined by historic boreholes which is acceptable for defining the 

limits of the mineralization.  The offsets of the mineralization and variation in the grades are 

similar to that seen at Daapleu (Figure 12.3.4_1).  

The variability in the results is similar to the results of the 2013 drilling and demonstrate and 

acceptable sampling method. 

The values of the historic assay show a bias of +25% when compared with the 2013 results.  

This bias is essentially caused by the low grades in the interior of the mineralized zones.  If 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 72 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

this is a significant error it will cause errors in the interpretation of the mineralized zones and 

estimation of the grade distribution. 

12.4 Qualified Persons Opinion (Mudau) Aires, Teckraie, Verse Ouest, Daapleu, 
ZiaNE and Mt Ity  

The QP's opinion is that the data from twinned boreholes shows that the mineralized zones 

are predictable and that the differences between the twinned boreholes represent the 

variability on the deposits.  The borehole logging and sampling data for the Aires, Teckraie, 

Verse Ouest, Daapleu, ZiaNE, and Mont Ity used in this technical report is satisfactory for the 

purpose of mineral resource estimation and classification reported. 

12.5 Qualified Persons Opinion (Bosc) Walter and Gbeitouo 

Historical work has been assessed through a varied programme of twinning boreholes, 

comparing assay populations and geology and databases were thoroughly verified.  It's the 

QP's opinion that most of the results are comparable for resources at an indicated level, and 

remaining variability is due to both the varied range of practices, all within acceptable level of 

practices, and the intrinsic variability of the deposits.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Heap Leach Operations 

No heap leach testwork has been conducted on the project during the last number of years 

and anything completed historically is no longer available.  The heap leach has been in 

operation for many years and remains in operation and as such production data can be used 

to give an indication of the metallurgical performance expected from the plant. 

It is reported by mine management that regular bottle-roll tests are completed to determine 

the recoverable gold from a -2mm pulverised 50 gram sample.  

Historically, as reported in 2008, regular column leach tests were completed, but this practise 

has been discontinued. 

The analytical techniques available on the mine do not include total contained gold methods 

and as such the actual head grade samples cannot be determined.  Comparing gold 

recovered with the above determined leachable gold content results in a historical yield of 

between 75% and almost 80%. 

This is not based on test work but actual production data. 

13.2 Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) Operations 

Considerable metallurgical testwork has been conducted to confirm the metallurgical 

response for the CIL plant. 

The metallurgical testing used for the 2.0Mtpa CIL project was completed during 2014 at ALS 

Minerals Division (Metallurgy) located in Kamloops, BC, Canada.  Additional work was 

conducted in 2015 but has not been integrated into this report. 

Mineralogical and metallurgical test work was completed in order to generate sufficient 

mineralogical and metallurgical information to: 

 Establish the processing route (process flow diagrams); 

 Determine the plant operating parameters for the ores to be processed; 

 Evaluate the variability in metallurgical performance for the different deposits; and 

 Define parameters required for the engineering and design of the plant (process design 
criteria, mass and water balance and equipment sizing). 

The mineralogical study and metallurgical test work program were executed on the geological 

samples from the following deposit and facies. 

 Daapleu deposit included three different geological facies called Daaplite, Volcano 
sediment and a High Grade contact zone between both; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 74 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Gbeitouo deposit included two different geological facies called Oxidized Clay and 
Meta-volcano sediment; 

 Mont Ity Deep Extension test work was on two different geological facies called 
Oxidized Clay and Reduced Clay; 

 ZiaNE deposit test work was on two different geological facies called Oxidized Clay and 
Laterite; 

 Aires – four composite samples representing four geographical areas of the heap. 

13.2.1 Test Work Program 

Master composite samples were created, representing the majority of the SMI deposits facies 

detailed above.   

The complete test work program comprised the following: 

 Chemical analysis (Head Characterization); 

 Physical characterization (Specific Gravity, Bulk Densities (loose and packed)); 

 Hardness (Hard Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) determinations); 

 Grinding test work, including:  

 SMC test work (for SAG mill amenability); 
 JK simulation (for mills sizing); 
 Bond Abrasion Index (Ai) determinations; 
 Bond Rod Work Index (RWi) determinations; 
 Bond Ball Work Index (BWi) determinations; 

 Cyanidation/CIL test work (with air and oxygen sparging); 

 Gravity concentration;  

 Flotation amenability followed by concentrate ultrafine grinding and cyanidation / CIL of 
products; 

 Detoxication test work (cyanide destruction and arsenic precipitation); 

 Settling test work; 

 Tailings acid generation potential (Acid Base Accounting (ABA)). 

13.2.2 Qualified Person's Comments  

The sample material was selected and prepared by SMI geologists and personnel to create 

what is believed to be representative facies samples.  The samples were packaged into 19 

steel drums and sealed.   

Upon arrival at ALS laboratories in Kamloops, the drums were inspected and stored until QP 

arrival.  It was noticed that the seal of two of the drums were broken (Daapleu – Daaplite and 

Mont Ity Deep Extension – Oxidised Clay).  It is believed that the drums were opened and 

inspected by Canadian customs officers in Vancouver.

13.2.3 Discussion and Process Development  

The metallurgical test work results allowed the process development steps described in the 

following paragraphs. 

Crushing 

A mineral sizer type crusher has been selected for the soft sticky ore facies, such as oxidized 

clay, reduced clay and heap leach residues.  A jaw crusher has been selected for the more 

competent (hard) ore facies, such as Daaplite and Volcano sediments. 

Grinding 

The test work allowed a preliminary sizing of the mills.  The grinding mill has been sized to 

process ore at an average rate of 254tph (tonnes per hour) with a finished product 80% 

passing 75μm.  These results are preliminary and the mills sizing will need to be revisited 

during the definitive study phases of the project. 

Gravity Concentration 

Gravity concentration did not improved overall gold recoveries and not been considered in the 

process development as the mean gold particle diameter is only in the 18µm range.   

Pre-leach Thickening 

A high rate thickener has been selected for the pre-leach thickener.  The thickener underflow 

density of 43% (w/w) is anticipated.  The settling test results are preliminary and the thickener 

sizing will need to be revisited during the definitive study phases of the project. 

Carbon-In-Leach (CIL)  

Whole ore cyanidation leach tests were performed and a final grind of 75µm has been 

selected with air sparging for the process design criteria.   

The cyanide leach kinetic curves developed during the test work show that gold extraction 

with 32-hour retention time has selected for the CIL plant process design criteria.   

The gold extraction for the composite samples averaged about 93% for the non-sulphide 

composites and 72% for the sulphide composites. 

The leach results are summarized in Table 13.2.3_1.

Flotation  

Most of the ore types tested are free-milling.  However the facies containing sulphide 

minerals, namely Daapleu –Daaplite, High Grade contact and Metavolcano sediment and 

Gbeitouo Metavolcano sediment have shown to be partially refractory in nature. 

Flotation of these sulphide minerals followed by ultrafine grinding to below 20μm and 

cyanidation have not improved gold recovery over direct cyanidation. 

Thus flotation has not been considered at this stage for the project, but this may be reviewed, 

subject to more test work. 

Cyanide Detoxification 

Four cyanidation tailings samples were subjected to cyanide destruction test work using the 

SO2/air process.  Residual CNWAD levels less than 2.0mg/L were attained for all four 

cyanidation tailings samples to confirm that this process is acceptable for detoxification. 

The inclusion of an arsenic removal stage after cyanide detoxification will need to be 

considered, as some treated effluents contained an elevated level of arsenic.  An arsenic 

removal test was undertaken on treated detox slurry to demonstrate that arsenic can be 

removed using standard practices such as ferric sulphate and sulphuric acid.  The arsenic 

level in solution was reduced to 0.1mg/L. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 77 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Inadequate work has been completed around the tailings detoxification and more work will be 

required. 

13.2.4 Additional Metallurgical and Geochemical Test Work 

The mining plan shows that some geological facies have not been tested during the PFS.  

These facies should be tested to confirm the adequacy of the currently developed process.   

Additional mineralogical and metallurgical test work is also required to firm up the process 

flowsheet that has been developed.  The additional test work will allow determination of 

optimum operating parameters (final grind, reagent consumption, etc.) in order to minimize 

CAPEX and OPEX.   

The increase in mineral resources of the sulphide facies may warrant to investigation of the 

pressure oxidation process (POX) of the sulphidic facies.  In doing so, previous flotation will 

need to be repeated and optimized to produce the sulphide concentrate.   

Screening level geochemical test work program will also be required to characterize key rock 

types in the vicinity of ore zone of the multiple deposits.  This is to determine probable 

loadings of acidity, metals and sulphate salinity that may be associated with tailings materials 

and confirm problematic rock types that will be the focus of the test work program required to 

characterize waste rock materials generated by the project. 

13.2.5 Status of Testwork 

The quality and quantity of testwork performed for the 2Mtpa CIL is considered adequate for 

the PFS level developed for the project. 

The ore facies not containing sulphide is substantially free-milling and is not preg-robbing in 

nature.  The ore facies containing sulphide is partially refractory and direct cyanidation (CIL 

process) yields lower gold recovery.   

The additional test work is to include additional variability samples and is to concentrate upon 

the ore to be delivered during the first five years of the project.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

All mineral resources are declared as at 31 July 2015.  Mineral resources as reported in this 

section have been constrained by pit shells using the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm, cost, pit 

slope angles and recovery parameters relevant to the deposits at Ity.  The gold price used is 

US$1500 which is approximately 30% higher than the spot price at 31 July 2015.  This allows 

a broader package, including marginal mineralization, to be defined and excludes areas that 

are unlikely to be mined.  The pit shells included all mineralization regardless of classification.  

Input parameters are given in Table 14_1.  No pit shells were applied to the Heap Leach 

(Aires), Teckraie and Verse Ouest as these have 0g/t Au cut-off and all material is assumed to 

be available for mining.

14.1 Aires de Lixiviation (Old Heap Leach Pads) 

14.1.1 Introduction 

Coffey has estimated the mineral resource for the SMI Aires as at 31 July 2015.  The volume 

modelling and mineral resource estimation was completed in the 3D software package 

Datamine™ Studio 3 and Isatis.  The Aires were divided into material placed on the leach 

pads (Domain 1) and gold in the soil below the leach pad (Domain 2).  The grade estimation 

was completed using a Nearest Neighbour estimate for the pad and Inverse Distance 

Weighting to 3rd power (ID3) for the soil.  This estimation approach was considered 

appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of 

available data, the style and geometry of gold distribution and the constraints imposed by 

leach pad design.  The estimation was constrained by hard boundaries based on surface 

survey data and drilling patterns. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 79 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

14.1.2 Data Validation 

The grade estimation was based on the entire borehole database comprising both RC and 

diamond drilling.  No boreholes or data were excluded from the mineral resource estimation. 

The database has been reviewed and validated by Coffey prior to commencing the mineral 

resource estimation.  These included: 

 Checking for overlapping intervals; 

 Consistency of depths between different data tables; 

 Checking gaps in the data; 

 Replacing less than detection limit samples with half the detection limit (0.005g/t); 

 Collar elevation validation. 

No samples were deleted from the database.  Any missing values due to core loss were 

allocated an absent value ("-").   

14.1.3 Geometry and Modelling 

The material is partially leached, open pit material, which has been placed on the Aires in 50m 

wide by approximately 5m high strips on eight levels.  There is some short scale continuity 

due to the mining method from the pits.  No geological modelling, other than the domaining 

between the mined rock and the underlying in-situ soils was attempted. 

The boundary between the rock dump and in-situ soil was interpreted from borehole data 

using cross sections parallel to the orientation of the drill lines.  Lidar survey data was used to 

define the outline of the dump. 

14.1.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

The Aires are the residues of a discontinued heap leach pads.  A description of grade 

distribution is contained in Section 8.   

14.1.5 Compositing  

The lengths of the samples were assessed prior to selecting an appropriate composite length 

for undertaking statistical analyses and grade estimation.  The minimum and maximum 

lengths were 0.05m and 4m respectively.  Summary statistics of the sample length indicates 

that 21.97% of the samples were sampled at less than 1m intervals, 76.67% of the samples 

were sampled at 1m intervals, and 1.36% greater than 1m. 

Compositing was on 5m intervals, to correspond with the block model vertical dimension, 

while the soil was composited at 1m intervals due to the thin nature of the domain.

14.1.6 Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis was undertaken on assay composites for the complete drilling datasets per 

mineralized domain.  All composites inside the individual modelled surfaces were flagged by 

level.  A total of 4,644 samples were used in the modelling process from a total of 151 RC and 

diamond boreholes.  Separate statistics were generated for each domain and are presented in 

Table 14.1.6_1.

The population of gold grades is lognormal; for both the dump and the soil, which is typical of 

many gold deposits.   

For both domains the coefficient of variation (CV) is moderate for a gold deposit (high 

geostatistically) as a result of mixing due to mining operations.  A high CV is consistent with 

the presence of high outlier grades that potentially require cutting (capping) for grade 

estimation.  High grade capping is discussed in Section 14.1.7. 

14.1.7 High Grade Capping 

For the Aires (Domain 1) six values were capped to 19.1g/t, for the soil (Domain 2) one value 

of 16.4g/t Au was capped to 8.54g/t.  The impact of the cutting is shown in Table 14.1.7_1.  

Estimations were done including and excluding top capping.

14.1.8 Bulk Densities 

While it is noted that density changes with depth from about 1t/m3 at the upper surface to 

1.9t/m3 at the base, the change is not uniform.  Sampling has only been undertaken on the 

diamond boreholes.  The density values applied are a single average value for each domain 

(Table 14.1.8_1).

The parent block sizes selected to estimate the deposit approximates half the borehole 

spacing.  Sub-blocking (8x8 sub cells) was allowed for good volume definition. 

The block models were constructed with parameters as displayed in Table 14.1.10_1.

14.1.11 Grade Estimation 

Grade estimation was performed using Nearest Neighbour (Domain 1) ID3 (Domain 2) as this 

gave a gold distribution closest to the borehole grades. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 82 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The Nearest Neighbour estimate selects the value of the nearest assay grade and does not 

consider the value of the neighbouring points nor does it involve weighting sample values.  

This estimation technique was deemed appropriate to be applied to Aires as the pad is man-

made and deposited randomly.  Nearest neighbour adequately maps any continuous 

mineralization without introducing any smoothing and artificial continuity. 

Due to the nature of the soil deposit and the uniformity of the domain, ID3 was considered 

appropriate to be applied in the estimation as there is some continuity of the mineralization in 

the domain. 

Inverse Distance grade estimations were also performed on the Aires material and the 

difference in gold grades between the Nearest Neighbour estimate and the ID3 used in the 

mineral resource classification to assess variability between the estimations. 

14.1.12 Estimation Parameters 

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside the domain 

from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was applied to each 

zone, applying an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and subsequent 

estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an estimate. 

The sample search parameters are supplied in Table 14.1.12_1.

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans;   

 Comparison of Nearest Neighbour estimate using Inverse distance estimates.

14.1.14 Depletion 

No mining has taken place within the area of mineralization hence no depletion has been 

applied to the block model. 

14.1.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

Confidence levels for key criteria are listed in Table 14.1.15_1.  Classification may have been 

downgraded in some areas due to lower confidence in the data as listed in Table 14.1.15_1.  

Applying the following parameters, mineral resource classification codes were assigned to the 

block model: 

Parameters for Classification (Nearest Neighbour estimate compared to ID3) 

 Measured Mineral Resources (all criteria to be fulfilled): 

 First search volume 
 Absolute difference in grade between the two estimates is less than 0.5g/t Au  

 Indicated Mineral Resources(all criteria to be fulfilled): 

 First and second volume 
 Absolute difference in grade between the two estimates is greater than 0.5g/t Au 

and less than 1.0g/t Au

14.1.16 Classification and Grade Models 

Sections through the classification and grade models for Aires are shown in Figure 14.1.16_1  

The drilling grid is sufficiently tight for this deposit to estimate continuity.  The Aires have 

some internal structure and the leaching process leads to some redistribution of gold.  The 

grade distribution reflects this deposition.  The mineral resource is classified as Measured 

Mineral Resources.

14.1.17 Summary of Mineral Resources 

The estimated mineral resources for the Aires are tabulated below per domain perm resource 

category at a cut-off grade of 0g/t Au (Table14.1.17_1).  A cut of grade of 0g/t Au is the 

preferred mineral resources as there may be some selection when the material is 

reprocessed.

14.2 Teckraie 

14.2.1 Introduction 

Coffey has estimated the mineral resource for the Teckraie as at 31 July 2015.  The volume 

modelling was completed in the 3D software packages Datamine™ Studio 3.  The volume 

was divided into; the Teckraie Dump material (Domain 1) and mineralization in the soil below 

the dump (Domain 2).  The grade estimation was completed using a Nearest Neighbour 

estimate for the dump and Inverse Distance Weighting to the second power ID2 for the soil.  

This estimation approach was considered appropriate based on review of a number of factors, 

including the quantity and spacing of available data, the style and geometry of mineralization 

and the constraints imposed by mine design.  The estimation was constrained by hard 

geological boundaries based on geological interpretations. 

14.2.2 Data validation 

See Section 14.1.2. 

14.2.3 Geometry and Modelling 

The mineralization is associated with low grade open pit material randomly placed onto a low 

grade stockpile.  As a result no modelling, other than the domaining between the rock dump 

material and the insitu soils was attempted.  For grade distribution and dump geometry refer 

to Section 14.2.16.  The boundary between the rock dump and insitu soil was interpreted from 

cross sections parallel to the orientation of the drill lines.  Lidar survey data was used to define 

outline of the dump, with the mineral resource estimate confined to 15m (half the drill borehole 

spacing) beyond the drilling limits. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 87 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

14.2.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

Teckraie is a rock dump containing waste from the mining of the Flotouo deposit on the 

property.  A description of the source rock mineralization is given in Section 8. 

14.2.5 Compositing 

Summary statistics of the sample length indicates that 7.0% of the samples were sampled at 

less than 1m intervals, 90.7% of the samples were sampled at 1m intervals, and 2.3% greater 

than 1m.  For mineral resource estimation compositing was done at 1m intervals.   

14.2.6 Statistical Analysis 

A total of 2,249 composites were used in the modelling process from a total of 109 RC and 

diamond boreholes.  Separate statistics were generated for each domain and are presented in 

Table 14.2.6_1.   

Table 14.2.6_1

Domain 2 171 0.050 71.95 1.33 5.45 29.76 4.11 

The soil domain has an extremely high CV (4.11) due to the presence of a single high grade 

value (71.95 g/t).  The impact of capping this high grade value reduces the CV from 4.11 to 

0.71.  High grade capping is discussed in Section 14.2.7. 

The population of gold grades are lognormal; for both the dump and the soil, which is typical 

of most gold deposits.  For the dump domain the CV is relatively low for a gold deposit 

(moderately high geostatistically) as a result of mixing due to mining operations.   

14.2.7 High Grade Capping 

For the Dump (Domain 1) four values were capped to 10.87g/t, for the soil (Domain 2) one 

value of 72.0g/t Au was capped to 4.23g/t.  Estimations were done including and excluding 

top capping and the results reviewed.  It was observed that capping reduced the mineral 

resource gold content, at a zero cut off by 2.6%.  This is consistent with the grade reduction in 

the raw data. 

14.2.8 Bulk Densities 

The density values applied for Teckraie mineral resource estimate per domain are 1.37t/m3 for 

the dump material and 1.62t/m3 for soil.  The dump densities were derived from 

measurements from dump boreholes.  The soil is the average soils density over the mine 

property.

14.2.9 Variography 

As the material was randomly placed on the dump with no spatial continuity the Nearest 

Neighbour estimate was used in preference to constructing variograms and Kriging. 

14.2.10 Block Modelling 

The block models were constructed with parameters as displayed in Table 14.2.10_1.

14.2.11 Grade Estimation 

Grade estimation was done using Nearest Neighbour and ID2.  The dump was estimated 

using the Nearest Neighbour estimate, while the soil was estimated using ID2.  This estimation 

technique was deemed appropriate to be applied to Teckraie, as the dump is man-made and 

deposited randomly. 

ID2 grade estimations were also conducted on Teckraie dump material and the difference in 

gold grades between the Nearest Neighbour estimate and the ID2 used in the mineral 

resource classification.

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied to each zone, applying an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second 

and subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an

14.2.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review

14.2.14 Depletion 

Teckraie is on the edge of the Ity pit and some of the eastern portions have been removed in 

the pushback.  The volumes are small and differences between the topographic surface and 

the current surface are not material to the overall mineral resource for SMI.  Depletion due to 

mining has not been accounted for in the geological model.

14.2.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

All mineral inventory 15m beyond the parameter of the drilling is reported as unclassified due 

to lack of data.  Confidence levels for key criteria are tabulated in Table 14.2.15_1.  Applying 

the following parameters, mineral resource classification was based on the following criteria;  

 Indicated (all criteria to be fulfilled): 

 Estimated using the same estimation pass for both methods 
 Absolute difference in grade between NN and ID estimates < 1.0g/t Au    

 Inferred: 

 Estimated using different estimation passes  
 Absolute difference in grade between NN and ID estimates is > 1.0g/t Au    
 All soil classified as inferred 

 Unclassified: 

 15m (half the borehole spacing) beyond the edge of the drill fence perimeter

Classification is shown for Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral Resources.  The 

drilling grid is sufficiently tight for this deposit to estimate continuity.  Teckraie is a waste dump 

with no internal structure.  The grade distribution reflects the somewhat random deposition.  

The mineral resource is classified as Indicated Mineral Resources as the entire dump is at a 

high enough grade to be considered for reprocessing and the grade distribution is considered 

representative of what will be extracted.

14.3 Verse Ouest 

14.3.1 Introduction 

Coffey has estimated the mineral resource for Verse Ouest as at 31 July 2015.  The grade 

estimation was completed using a Nearest Neighbour estimate.  This estimation approach 

was considered appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity 

and spacing of available data, the style and geometry of mineralization.  The grade estimation 

was based on the entire borehole database.  No boreholes or data were excluded from the 

mineral resource estimation process. 

14.3.2 Data validation 

See Section 14.1.2 

14.3.3 Geometry and Modelling 

Three dimensional models were constructed using Datamine and Micromine software.  The 

base of the dump was interpreted from borehole data using cross sections parallel to the 

orientation of the drill lines.  The 2013 domain was defined by Lidar data for the top surface 

while the 2014 domain was defined by collar data for the top surface and the Lidar data for the 

bottom surface.  The 2014 domain has small volume.  The block modelling and layering is 

defined on Sections 14.3.10 and 14.3.13. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 94 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

14.3.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

Verse Ouest is a rock dump containing the waste material from mining operations on the 

property.  A description of the mineralization is contained in Section 8.  Figure 14.3.13_1 

presents a typical cross section of the deposit.   

14.3.5 Compositing  

The minimum and maximum lengths were 0.10m and 1.55m respectively and samples have 

an average length of 0.9m.  Compositing was done on 5m intervals to correspond with the 

block model vertical dimension.  The borehole samples were flagged based on the level. 

14.3.6 Statistical Analysis 

A total of 193 composites were used in the modelling process.  Separate statistics were 

generated for each domain and are presented in Table 14.3.6_1.

14.3.7 Outlier Analysis 

Some outlier values were identified but it was not deemed necessary to cut or cap the data as 

capping would not have significant impact on the global mean. 

14.3.8 Bulk Densities 

The density values applied for Verse Ouest mineral resource estimate is 1.71t/m3 for the 

dump material.  Table 14.3.8_1 gives the density sample population statistics.  The volume 

replacement method reported unrealistically low densities when compared with the hydrostatic 

method.  The distribution of density data is normal for hydrostatic method and skewed for 

volumetric method.  Density distribution for same lithology would be expected to exhibit a 

normal distribution rather than the log normal the distribution produced by volumetric method.  

The data collected using hydrostatic method was used for mineral resource evaluation.  One 

outlier (3.11t/m3) was identified and capped (at 2.04t/m3) for mean density determination.

calculated and modelled. 

14.3.10 Block Modelling 

The parent block sizes selected to estimate the deposit approximates half the borehole 

spacing.  Sub-blocking (8x8x8 sub cells) was allowed for good volume definition.  The block 

models were constructed with parameters as displayed in Table 14.3.10_1.

14.3.11 Grade Estimation 

Grade estimation used the Nearest Neighbour method.  A good Nearest Neighbour estimate 

using an appropriate block size will map-out any real continuity in the deposit.  This estimation 

technique was considered appropriate to Verse Ouest as it is man-made and deposited 

randomly. 

14.3.12 Estimation Parameters 

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside a 

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied, making use of an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and 

subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate. 

The sample search parameters are supplied in Table 14.3.12_1.

14.3.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review 

included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset; 

 Visual checks of cross sections Figure 14.3.13_1); 

 Comparison of Nearest Neighbour estimate using ID estimates; 

 Comparison of different estimates using composites; 

 Change to search parameters. 

The model validation checks confirmed the suitability of the methodology applied and the 

estimation results.

14.3.14 Depletion and Geological Loss 

No mining has taken place within the area of mineralization hence no depletion has been 

applied to the block model.  The dump is man-made feature expected to be mined in its 

entirety.  No geological/volume losses are applied. 

14.3.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

Confidence levels for key criteria are tabulated in Table 14.3.15_1.  Classification may have 

been downgraded in some areas due to lower confidence in the data.  Applying the following 

parameters, mineral resources were classified based on: 

 Measured Mineral Resources were not considered as the boreholes are not closely 

spaced enough to establish continuity with high confidence. 

 Indicated Mineral Resources (all criteria to be fulfilled) 

 First search-volume and extrapolated for 25m beyond the drill fence perimeter. 

 Inferred Mineral Resources 

 Second pass beyond the edge of the drill fence perimeter. 
 Up to 100m beyond the drill fence perimeter.

14.4 Daapleu 

14.4.1 Introduction 

Coffey has updated the geological model and mineral resource for the Daapleu deposit as at 

31 July 2015.  The deposit was divided into three domains North, Central and South, based 

on the geometry of mineralization.  The grade estimation was completed using Ordinary 

Kriging estimates per domain.  The estimation was constrained by hard geological boundaries 

within the zone of mineralization and soft boundaries between mineralized domains. 

14.4.2 Data Validation 

See section 14.1.2 

14.4.3 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

The geological modelling was completed in the 3D software package Datamine™ Studio 3.  

The model was based on information from survey data, geological mapping, RC and diamond 

borehole data and sample analyses.  The modelling also considered the artisanal mining pit 

positions. 

The geological data and cross sections were used to map the base of the weathered zone.  

The weathered zone has a depth of about 25m to 35m.  The weathered zone is deeper where 

there are structural features such as shear zones or the Cavally River.  The dataset was 

coded with indicator values based on degree of oxidation;  

The partially weathered and fresh lithologies were considered the same as they have similar 

physical properties.  The base of the weathered surface was modelled using DTM Creation 

routine in Datamine and the oxidation indicators. 

Geological Mapping Methodology 

The geological model was produced using indicator estimation of the metamorphosed volcano 

sedimentary unit (VSM) and felsic intrusive - daaplite (IFMD) lithological units.  Daapleu is 

ideally suited to indicator-type estimation because it has two distinct units of sufficient 

thickness to establish lithological domains.  The contact between the two is a zone of mixed 

layers of IFMD and VSM with poor correlation between individual boreholes.  Stratigraphy in 

the borehole logs was retained as given in the original data set.  Only the IFMD and VSM 

units were considered in the initial exercise 

Borehole spacing in the densely drilled northern domain is 20m - 40m.  Various models at 

different block sizes have been run during the current and previous mineral resource 

estimations at 10m, 5m and 2.5m blocks.  A block model of 2.5m x 2.5m x 2.5m was chosen 

as being suitable for estimating the geology with enough detail to identify the main mineralized 

zones. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 101 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The initial estimation method used was ID2 to test the search parameters.  This gave good 

results and mapped the logged lithologies well.  In an attempt to better the estimation, 

variograms were modelled for the IFMD.  While good omnidirectional variograms were 

produced, directional variograms in the plane of the main structural trend were less 

satisfactory.  Laterally there is little variation and the variograms were not showing the 

variability in the mixed zone at all due to the overwhelming amount of data in the thick main 

body of the deposit.  Since the ID2 estimation gave a good result the kriging option was not 

pursued further. 

The search parameters used in the estimation of geology are presented on Table 14.4.3_1.

The results were compared against the raw borehole data using the criteria of the proportion 

of samples informing the block were greater than 75% IFMD then the block was classified as 

IFMD.  Likewise if the samples informing the block were greater than 75% VSM the block was 

considered as VSM for the purposes of the geological interpretation.  Blocks between the 

VSM and IFMD where the proportions were both nonzero are considered as contact zone.  All 

other blocks are considered as waste in the mineral resource estimation.  The mapped 

lithologies from the model correlated well with the borehole data and mapped especially well 

against the artisanal pits (Figure 14.4.3_1).  The artisanal pits were generally dug at the 

lithological contact zone between the VSM and IFMD.  The contact has high grade 

mineralization in the northern portion of Daapleu. 

For structural mapping the contact between the IFMD and VSM was taken as 50% level.   

14.4.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

The gold mineralization models have similar problems to the geological models.  The 

mineralization is spread over a broad zone with no definite contacts.  Because gold 

mineralization is inherently nuggetty defining the edge of the zone based on the gold values of 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 102 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

individual samples is likely to result in incorrect boundaries being chosen.  Because the 

mineralization is spread over a broad zone with no definite contacts, the same mapping 

method as for the geology was applied to the gold using the borehole data.  Indicator sets 

were defined for gold at cut-offs of 0.5g/t, 1.0g/t, 1.5g/t, 2g/t and 3g/t and for arsenic at 50ppm 

and 5000ppm.  Cut-off grades were chosen mostly for convenience however, 0.5g/t Au is the 

generally agreed cut-off for defining mineralization in this deposit and is close to the cut-off 

grade from the mining PFS (SNC, July 2015).  The higher grades are to check for continuity of 

mineralization. 

The same estimation parameters were used as for the geological mapping. 

A set of grade shells were produced for gold using the following criteria 

 >30% samples informing the block were greater the 0.5g/t Au; 

 >30% of the samples were greater than 1g/t Au; 

 >30% of the samples were greater than 2g/t Au; 

 >30% of samples greater than 50ppm arsenic; 

 >30% of samples greater than 5000pm arsenic. 

Of the six shells the model with >30% of sample over 1g/t Au mapped the mineralized 

package well.  The As shell >30% of samples over 50ppm mapped the mineralization in the 

upper IFMD.  It was less useful for the lower areas of the IFMD but does map the higher 

grade mineralization in the VSM. 

The mineralization structure/orientation was then mapped from the gold grade shells and the 

IFMD and VSM distributions.  These structures were used in the domaining of the 

mineralization into North, Central and South areas.  Domaining was used for calculation 

convenience; there are no distinct geological boundaries between theses domains.  The 

differences are primarily in data density and structural orientation of the VSM/IFMD contact.  

The mapped mineralization envelopes for 2014 and 2015 mineral resource estimations are 

shown in Figures 14.4.4_1 and 14.4.4_2.  The differences are minor and show that the grades 

are predictable with high degree of confidence.

14.4.5 Compositing 

Most of the samples were collected at 1m interval.  For the mineral resource estimation, 

compositing was performed per rock type at 1m intervals to preserve the deposit variability in 

the estimates. 

14.4.6 Statistical Analysis 

A total of 10,466 composites were used in the estimation process from a total of 181 RC and 

diamond boreholes within the mineralized zone.  Separate statistics were generated for each 

domain and are presented in Table 14.4.6_1.

For estimation purposes the oxide and fresh domains were treated as a single mineralization 

domain.  Statistics were calculated for the two oxidation zones (oxide and fresh) and for the 

North, Central and South Domains.  All domains and oxidation zones have similar lognormal 

grade distributions typical of gold deposits.  Oxidation and alteration do not appear to have 

resulted in substantial remobilization or concentration of gold.  For estimation purposes the 

oxide and fresh domains were treated as a single mineralization domain.   

14.4.7 High Grade Capping 

There are no outliers and no high grade capping was applied. 

14.4.8 Bulk Densities 

The density values applied for the mineral resource estimate, per rock type, are derived from 

measurements of the core: oxidized material 1.60t/m

, Fresh VSM 2.84t/m

 and IFMD 

2.67t/m3.  The standard deviation and CV are low showing that the average density is suitable 

for use in mineral resource estimation (Table 14.4.8_1).

14.4.9 Variography 

For the North and Central Domains experimental directional variograms were generated in 

Datamine, using all the RC and diamond drilling data composited at 1m interval and contained 

within the mineralized modelled surface.  Soft domaining was applied to include an additional 

line of boreholes as the boundary between the domains is gradational rather than sharp.  

Variograms per domain were constructed parallel to the Domains mineralization strike and dip 

directions.  To reduce variance and assist in the variogram construction, the maximum grade 

outliers per Domain were excluded from the experimental variogram construction.       

Down-the-hole variograms were constructed using Isatis software, perpendicular to the 

mineralization, defining the nugget-sill ratio to be applied for the ordinary kriging (OK) 

estimate.  The down-the-hole variograms were well defined and the relatively low nugget ratio 

obtained compared to similar deposits is attributed to domaining. 

The 2014 variogram parameters were used in the 2015 modelling as there was no significant 

change in the variograms between the two data sets.  The nugget, sills and ranges were all 

tested per domain in 2015 and found to be the same as those used in the 2014 estimation.  

This implies that Daapleu grade distribution is stable and highly predictable. 

Two structure spherical models were fitted with a nugget value determined by down-the-hole 

variograms.  For the South Domain there was insufficient data to construct meaningful 

variograms and the variography modelled for the Central Domain was applied to the South 

Domain.

14.4.11 Grade Estimation 

Grade estimation was done using OK for all Domains.  North and Central Domains were 

estimated using the modelled variograms and search parameters as supplied in 

Table 14.4.11_1.  The South Domain was estimated using the variogram modelled for the 

Central Domain.  Statistical analysis of the gold distribution in the oxidized and fresh zones 

(Section 14.4.6) indicates that they are one population and they were combined and 

estimated as if there was no difference in the host rock.  Likewise with the gold mineralization 

in the IFMD and VSM which were combined as if there was no difference in host rock within 

each domain.

14.4.12 Estimation Parameters 

Hard domain boundaries were used preventing samples lying outside the mineralized domain 

from being used for the estimation.  Soft domaining within the mineralized domains was 

permitted, to include an additional line of boreholes outside of the domain boundaries, as the 

domain boundaries are gradational.  A three-pass estimation strategy was applied to each 

zone, applying an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and subsequent 

estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an estimate 

(Table 14.4.11_1). 

14.4.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review 

included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset. 

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans (Figures 14.4.13_1 to 
14.4.13_4). 

 Swath Plots

14.4.14 Depletion and Geological Losses 

No mining has taken place within the area of mineralization.  No depletion has been applied to 

the block model.  Geological losses where known are accounted for in the geological model 

and classified as waste.  Artisanal mining has been accounted for in the topographic survey.  

All other losses will be treated at the mine planning stage. 

14.4.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

Classifications are based on the confidence levels of the key criteria that were considered 

during the mineral resource estimation.  Confidence levels for key criteria are listed in Table 

14.4.15_1.  Classification may have been downgraded in some areas due to lower confidence 

in the data.  Mineral resource classification is based on: 

 Measured Mineral Resources: 

 Estimated within the first search volume; 
 Minimum of three boreholes; 
 20m borehole spacing. 

 Indicated Mineral Resources: 

 Estimated within the first or second search volume. 

 Inferred Mineral Resources: 

 Estimated within the second or third search volume.

14.4.16_2) there is insufficient information in the adjacent lines to give the same confidence 

as the North domain. 

Gold mineralization in the North domain occurs in three zones, at the top of the IFMD, in and 

near the contact between the IFMD and VSM and in the VSM.  Only the first two are 

considered for inclusion in the mineral resources.  The zone in the metasediments is thin, 

poorly defined by drilling, not connected to the main zone of mineralization and would need 

more information to be considered as potentially economically minable.  The mineralization in 

upper part of the IFMD is a persistent low to moderate grade zone with an arsenic anomaly.  

The gold mineralization in the contact zone is moderate to high grade with continuity over a 

few hundred metres.  The zone is persistent over all domains.

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Gold grades in the Central Domain follow those of the North but with lower grades.  The 

mineralization in the IFMD is persistent but the grade in the contact zone is lower. 

Mineralization in the South Domain appears to be only associated with the contact zone.

14.4.18 Comparison with Historical Estimates 

Coffey estimated Daapleu mineral resource in 2014.  The 2014 model is compared against 

the 2015 boreholes as shown in Figures 14.4.18_1 to 14.4.18_3.  The figures show that the 

mineralization was correctly identified and the grades are predictable.  This has been 

considered when classifying the mineral resource.

14.5 ZiaNE 

14.5.1 Introduction 

Coffey has updated the mineral resource for the ZiaNE deposit as at 31 July 2015.  The 

geological modelling was completed in the 3D software packages Micromine and Datamine™ 

Studio 3.  The grade estimation was completed using an ID2 which was considered 

appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of 

available data, randomness of the grade; and geometry of mineralization and the constraints 

imposed by mine design.  The grade estimation was constrained by hard geological 

boundaries based on geological interpretations. 

14.5.2 Data Validation 

See Section 14.1.2. 

14.5.3 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

Introduction 

The geological modelling was completed on the 3D software packages Datamine™ (CAE 

Mining) Studio 3 and Micromine.  The geological model was based on information from survey 

data, geological mapping, RC and diamond borehole data and sample analyses.  This 

geological model was based on current assays results.  Historical data was found to be 

inaccurate and replaced with results of the reassay of this historical drilling. 

Geological Modelling 

The 2D mineralization sections constructed by the project geologist were analysed and used 

in improving the understanding of the mineralization style.  The sections contained the grade 

shells of gold above a nominal 0.5g/t Au.  The sections were drawn at 335° Azimuth assuming 

that the mineralization dips at strikes at 335°.  The sections showed that the mineralization is 

interpreted as a series of parallel veins but is highly discontinuous (Figure 14.5.3_1).  The 

veins and gold mineralization are not restricted to any lithology.   

Lithological data from the historical boreholes was still considered accurate and this data was 

combined with the new assays data to form the basis for a new geological model.  Geological 

interpretations were available from the project geologists as hand drawn sections due to 

insufficient time to prepare a digital geological model on site.  Discussions with SMI geologists 

on possible interpretations guided the modelling process. 

The lithologies were categorized into five main groups: 

 Laterite; 

 Oxidised Saprolites;  

 Reduced Saprolites; 

 Granite; and  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 126 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Dolomite. 

 The mafic intrusives are irregular and were ignored when constructing the geological 
model. 

The lithologies were composited so that top and bottom surfaces could be defined.  The 

laterite is fairly flat and other lithologies have irregular dips.  The top and bottom surfaces of 

major lithologies were mapped using Datamine's Studio 3 DTM creation routine.  The 

dolomite and weathering surfaces were mapped in Micromine and then exported to Datamine 

for further manipulation.

Weathered Zone 

The geological logs and cross sections were used to map the base of the weathered zone.  

The weathered zone has a depth of 25m to 100m.  The transition zone (partially weathered) is 

very thin and non-existent in some areas.  Partially weathered materials were included in the 

highly weathered zone as they have similar characteristics.  The surface was mapped as a 

DTM using borehole contacts to define the base of the zone. 

14.5.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

Due the complexity of the mineralized zone the same modelling method as used at Daapleu 

was tested for ZiaNE.  A nominal cut-off of 0.5g/t Au was used at ZiaNE in creating the 

mineralization volumes.  Gold grades above the cut-off were coded 1 and the grade below the 

cut-off and absent values were coded 0.  The indicator estimation was carried out with the 

coded data (0 and 1) and was completed using the search volume presented in Table 

14.5.4_1.  The estimation method used was ID2 as this method tends to map contacts well.

The isosurfaces on the calculated proportions were created in Datamine.  The 0.3 (>=30% of 

samples above 0.5g/t Au) cut-off isosurface provided the best results when compared against 

the raw borehole data.  The cut-offs of 0.3g/t Au mapped the mineralization well while a cut-off 

below 0.3g/t Au included a large amount of unmineralized material. 

The ID2 estimation provided acceptable results and the model was retained for the grade 

estimation.  A plan and section showing the mapped mineralized envelope is shown in 

Figures 14.5.4_1 and 14.5.4_2.   

The Nearest Neighbour estimation technique was used to extrapolate the extent of the 

potential mineral resource model, up to 40m from the boreholes.  Outside the 40m 

extrapolation, everything was considered waste.

14.5.5 Compositing  

The lengths of the samples were assessed prior to selecting an appropriate composite length 

for undertaking statistical analyses and grade estimation.  The minimum and maximum 

lengths were 0.010m and 7.0m respectively.  Summary statistics of the sample length 

indicates that 21% of the samples were sampled at less than 0.5m intervals, 30% of the 

samples were sampled between 0.5m and 1m interval, 38% at a 1m interval, and 11% greater 

than 1m.  The sample length mode is 1m.   

14.5.6 Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis was undertaken on composited and length weighted un-composited (raw) 

datasets per domain.  All composites inside the individual modelled surfaces were flagged as 

separate domains.  A total of 8,759 composites were used in the estimation process from a 

total of 248 RC and diamond boreholes within the mineralized zone.  The statistics generated 

for the project are presented in Table 14.5.6_1.

The population of gold grades are lognormal, which is typical of many gold deposits.  The CV 

is high which is consistent with the presence of high outlier grades that potentially require 

cutting (capping) for grade estimation.  High grade capping is discussed in Section 14.5.7.   

14.5.7 High Grade Capping 

For ZiaNE no grade clustering of high values was observed and five values were capped to 

100g/t.  The impact of the cutting is shown in Table 14.5.7_1. 

Grade estimations were performed including and excluding top capping and the results 

reviewed.  It was observed that capping reduced the mineral resource gold content, at a zero 

cut off by 3.1%.  This is consistent with the grade reduction in the raw data.

14.5.8 Bulk Densities 

The density values applied for the ZiaNE mineral resource estimate is an average value per 

rock type per oxidation level as per Table 14.5.8_1.  Density data was collected as explained 

in Section 11.5.  No density values were available for the limestone and a value of 2.6t/m

was applied which appropriate for a limestone with 5 to 20% porosity.

14.5.9 Variography 

The mineralization appears to be randomly distributed within the mineralized zone with limited 

spatial continuity.  Variograms calculated show no structure. 

14.5.10 Block Modelling 

A three-dimensional block model was constructed for ZiaNE.  Parent block sizes were based 

on the data configuration (average drill spacing), compositing interval, geometry of the 

mineralization and suitability for mine planning.  The parent block sizes selected to estimate 

the deposit approximates half the borehole spacing.  Sub-blocking (8x8 sub cells) was 

allowed for good volume definition 

The block models were constructed with parameters as displayed in Table 14.5.10_1.

14.5.11 Grade Estimation 

Due to the nature deposit, ID2 was used to give a good balance between local weighting and 

smoothing.  A Nearest Neighbour estimate with a 40m search radius confined the model to a 

maximum distance of 40m beyond the drilling extremities.  All mineralization outside of the 

40m perimeter area was excluded from the estimate.  The mineral resource estimate 

excluded only mineral resources within the laterites and Saprolites (Argiles). 

14.5.12 Estimation Parameters 

The sample search parameters are supplied in Table 14.5.12_1.

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside the 

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied to each zone, applying an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second 

and subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate. 

14.5.13 Model Validation 

The grade estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The 

review included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset; 

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans; 

 Changes to search parameters; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 134 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Swath Plots; 

 Distribution of error plots (relative standard deviation) confirmed the random gold 
distribution. 

The model validation checks confirmed the suitability of the methodology applied and the 

estimation results.   

14.5.14 Depletion 

No mining has taken place within the area of mineralization; hence no depletion has been 

applied to the block model. 

14.5.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

Confidence levels for key criteria are listed in Table 14.5.15_1.  Classification may have been 

downgraded in some areas due to lower confidence in the data.  Applying the following 

parameters, the mineral resource was classified based on: 

 Indicated Mineral Resource: 

 Estimated within the laterite or saprolites stratigraphical units. 
 Estimated within a maximum of a 40m radius of drilling. 
 Estimated within the first search volume. 
 Minimum number of samples 30. 

 Inferred Mineral Resource (Laterite and Saprolite):  

 Estimated within the laterite or saprolite stratigraphical units. 
 Estimated within a maximum of a 40m radius of drilling. 
 Estimated within the second and third search volumes. 
 Minimum number of samples 3. 

 Inferred Mineral Resource (Carbonate and Granite): 

 Estimated within the carbonate or granite stratigraphical units. 
 Estimated within a 40m radius of drilling. 
 Estimated within continuity of saprolite mineralization. 
 Estimated within first, second or third volumes. 
 Minimum number of samples 12.

14.5.16 Classification and Grade Models 

Sections through the classification and grade models for ZiaNE are shown in Figures 

14.5.16_1 and 14.5.16_2. 

The drilling grid is sufficiently tight for this deposit to estimate continuity of a mineralized zone.  

The gold mineralization within the mineralized zone is random, highly variable and patchy.  

Variograms calculated showed pure nugget over distances greater than 7m.  This appears to 

be the nature of the deposit and is considered inappropriate to declare Measured Mineral 

Resource due to the high grade variability of the deposit.

14.5.17 Summary of Mineral Resources 

The estimated mineral resources for ZiaNE are tabulated below at a cut-off grade of 0.5g/t Au 

(Tables 14.5.17_1 to 14.5.17_3).  Mineral resources have been reported by geological zone.  

The saprolites and laterites are combined as they are expected to be processed partially on 

the Heap Leach.  The carbonates and granodiorite are reported separately as they are 

mineralogically different to the saprolites and laterites and may be suitable for processing in a 

planned CIL plant.

14.6 Mont Ity 

14.6.1 Introduction 

Coffey has estimated the mineral resource for the Mont Ity deposit as at 31 July 2015.  The 

grade estimation was completed using the OK estimation technique.  This estimation 

approach was considered appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the 

quantity and spacing of available data, data spatial relationship, the style and geometry of 

mineralization.  The grade estimation was based on the entire borehole database.  No 

boreholes or data were excluded from the mineral resource estimation process.

Three dimensional modelling was completed using Datamine and Micromine software.  The 

mineralized veins, the bottom surfaces of the oxidation and laterites, oxidized clays, reduced 

clays (mixed lithology) and solids for carbonates and cavities were modelled in Micromine.  

The surfaces were extrapolated to cover large area for mining studies.   

The blocks above and below the oxidization surface were coded accordingly.  The top and 

bottom surfaces were added to define a lithological package.  The topographic surface was 

taken as top of the laterite.  The surface defining the bottom of the laterites was used as a top 

of the oxidized clays.  The reduced clay (mixed lithology) was defined by bottom surface of 

the oxidised clay and top surface of the granodiorite.  The granodiorite was defined as 

anything below its top surface.  The model was coded according to the lithology. 

The solids (carbonates and cavity) were filled with blocks and coded accordingly.  Their 

models were added to the main geological model. 

14.6.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

A description of mineralization is contained in Section 8.  The two dimensional sections 

defining the geometry of the mineralization was provided to Coffey by the SMI site geologist.  

Figure 14.6.4_1 presents typical cross sections of the deposit.  The sections defined Au 

envelopes using a nominal cut-off of 0.5g/t.  The sections were geo-referenced and digitized 

in Micromine and 3D mineralization envelopes were created.   

Based on the physical and chemical properties, the mineralization was separated into three 

domains, namely oxidized, partially oxidized and fresh domains.  There were few samples in 

the partially oxidized domain and the domain has some resemblance of oxidized zone.  The 

partially oxidized material has similar processing characteristics as the oxidized material.  In 

consultation with project geologists, a decision was taken to combine partially oxidized and 

oxidized zone into one domain called oxidized domain and estimate as a single unit.  The final 

model was re-coded both with partial and fully oxidized zones for completeness.

14.6.5 Compositing  

A majority of the samples were taken at 1m interval.  A 1m interval was chosen for the 

composite length. 

14.6.6 Statistical Analysis 

Two domains (Oxidized and Fresh) detailed in Section 14.6.3 were statistically assessed.  All 

composites inside the individual modelled surfaces were flagged as separate domains.  

Separate statistics were generated for each domain and are presented in Table 14.6.6_1.

Population of gold grades are lognormal; which is typical of most gold deposits.  For both 

domains the CV is high, typical for a gold deposit.   

14.6.7 Outlier Analysis 

Capping was motivated by the histograms and probability plots.  Using a 99% probability, the 

capping was applied at 30g/t Au. 

14.6.8 Bulk Densities 

Table 14.6.8_1 shows the distribution of densities.  Refer to Section 11.5 for density 

determination methods.  The volume replacement method reported lower density than 

hydrostatic method.  As with Verse Ouest, the hydrostatic method produced a normal 

distribution which is expected distribution for density.  Only hydrostatic measurement were 

used in the mineral resource estimate

14.6.10 Block Modelling 

The parent block sizes that were selected to estimate the deposit are approximately half the 

borehole spacing.  Sub-blocking was allowed for good volume definition.  A parameter file 

confined the estimate to a maximum distance of 50m for the Indicated Mineral Resource and 

100m for the Inferred Mineral Resource beyond the drilling extremities.  The block models 

were constructed with parameters as displayed in Table 14.6.10_1.

14.6.11 Grade Estimation 

The estimation was carried-out using OK, lognormal OK and ID techniques for both domains.  

The veins in each domain were added and estimated together.  Adding veins together has 

several advantages: 

 Variography was possible as there were enough data points. 

 The veins show that there are from a same system, are basically one population.  
Separating them will mean dividing the population into sub-domain which in turn has 
numerous problems. 

 Practical and is time saving while using the best approach available so far.

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside a 

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied, making use of an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and 

subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate. 

14.6.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review 

included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset; 

 Visual checks of cross sections; 

 Comparison of OK, Lognormal OK and IDW estimates. 

The model validation checks confirmed the suitability of the methodology applied and the 

estimation results.   

The section positions are shown on Figure 14.6.13_1 and the sections through the model are 

shown in Figure 14.6.13_2 

14.6.14 Depletion 

Mining has taken place within the area of mineralization.  Depletion has been subtracted from 

the block model after estimation of the mineral resources.  The June 2015 mining surface was 

used to deplete the mineral resource. 

14.6.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

Levels for key criteria are tabulated in Table 14.6.15_1.  Applying the following parameters, 

mineral resource classification codes were assigned to the block model: 

 Measured Mineral Resource: 

No measured category was declared due to complex geology and mineralization style. 

 Indicated Mineral Resource: 

 First and second search-volume and  
 Difference between Au estimated using OK and OKL is less than 1g/t. 

 Inferred Mineral Resource: 

 First and second search volume, if the difference between Au estimated using OK 
and OKL is greater than 1g/t 

 and third pass.

14.7 Walter 

14.7.1 Introduction 

Arethuse has estimated the mineral resources for the SMI Mont Ity deposit as at 301 July 

2015.  Geological modelling and mineral resource estimation was done using GEOVIA Surpac 

6.6, XLStat, Autotats and Isatis software packages.  The grade estimation was completed 

using the both ID and OK estimation techniques.  This estimation approach was considered 

appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of 

available data, data spatial relationship, the style and geometry of mineralization.  The grade 

estimation was based on the entire borehole database.  Six of the twin boreholes were 

excluded from the mineral resource estimation process. 

14.7.2 Data Validation 

See Section 14.1.2. 

14.7.3 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

Comments for this section are included in Section 14.7.4. 

14.7.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

Walter is a vein system similar to Ity and ZiaNE.  Walter was modelled in manner similar to Ity 

where the individual veins were modelled as separate domains with a nominal cut-off of 

0.5g/t Au Figure 14.7.3_1.  This is considered a real physical limit on gold concentration for 

this deposit and is less than the current mining cut-off grade.  Given the erratic nature of the 

gold mineralization this lower grade allows for better modelling of continuous units.   

Intersections were required to be at least 1m thick with a maximum of 3m internal dilution.  

Some flexibility in the creation of solids was allowed to preserve the continuity of the 

mineralization and simplify modelling.  The mineralized zones were extended up to 50m from 

the nearest data point. 

The model consists of 16 solids of which two have large volumes and good continuity.  The 

remaining solids are much more restricted.  In other cases mineralization was not modelled 

because the extent was too localized and continuity could not be determined. 

The mineralization was found into four rock facies, namely laterites, granodiorite, marble and 

volcanosediments (Figure 14.7.4_2).  Based on the physical and chemical properties, the 

mineralization was separated into three domains, namely oxidized, partially oxidized and fresh 

domains.

14.7.5 Compositing  

Most of the samples were taken at 1m interval.  A 1m interval was chosen for the composite 

length. 

14.7.6 Statistical Analysis 

Mineralized intersections were taken from within mineralized domains on composites of 1m.  

Five of the domains had too few samples to calculate meaningful statistics.  Population 

statistics are given in Table 14.7.6_1

Population of gold grades are lognormal; which is typical of most gold deposits.  For both 

domains the CV is high, typical for a gold deposit.  A low CV in this data set reflects a lack of 

data rather than a low variability.

14.7.7 Outlier Analysis 

Capping was applied at 40g/t Au as motivated by the histograms and probability plots, and 

clustering for the largest mineralized domain.  This has the apparent effect of lowering the 

metal content by 7% relative to the uncut population.  This top cut was applied to all domains. 

14.7.8 Bulk Densities 

Walter has a bimodal density distribution with the softer oxidized/weathered saprolites being 

one population and the hard fresh rock another one.  Several attempts have been made to 

establish a density against lithology but data remained too widely distributed to be used here.  

Eventually dry bulk densities have been assigned per domains (Figure 14.7.8_1).

14.7.9 Variography 

Variograms were modelled for domains 1- 3, 7, 8-10 and 16.  The other domains had too few 

data to calculate variograms.  Domains 8-10 were modelled together as they are geologically 

similar (exoskarn) and to ensure enough samples for the calculations.  The variogram models 

have a spherical structure for solids 1-3 and 8-10, and a Gaussian structure for solids 7 and 

16.  Ellipsoids are sub-parallel to the ore bodies, and the main axis is most of the time sub-

horizontal and in the lengthening of the solids.  Along the main axis the ellipsoids are slightly 

elongated (major/semi-major ratio around 1.0-1.5).  The ranges are generally 40m, except for 

solids 7 and 16 which are 90 and 200m respectively.  No minor axis was modelled for solid 

16, thus an omnidirectional variogram was used. 

The variogram models parameters are given in Table 14.7.12_1. 

14.7.10 Block Modelling 

The parameters of the block model are displayed in Table 14.7.10_1.  The block model was 

orientated according to the mean orientation of the mineralised lenses.  The blocks 

dimensions were selected according to the drilling grid mesh, the dimensions of the 

mineralised lenses and the level of characterisation of the Au grades.  The blocks dimensions 

are about a third of the drilling mesh (25mx25m).

14.7.11 Grade Estimation 

The estimation was carried-out using the ID and OK techniques depending on the amount of 

data in each domain.  Domains with variograms modelled (Section 14.6.9) were modelled 

using OK and the rest with ID3.  Estimation Parameters are given in Section 14.7.12_1. 

14.7.12 Estimation Parameters 

The sample search parameters are supplied in Table 14.7.12_1. 

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside a 

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied, making use of an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and 

subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate. 

14.7.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review 

included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset. 

 Visual checks of cross sections. 

 Swath Plots 

The model validation checks confirmed the suitability of the methodology applied. 

14.7.14 Depletion 

Mining activity resumed in April 2015, and resulted in 139,000t@1.21g/t Au = 5.4koz depletion 

of total mineral resources (5% of total ore, and 2.7% of contained gold).  Although not material 

compared to the total mineral resources of the deposit, and given the indicative confidence 

level of the resources, mineral resources at 31 July 2015 have been adjusted accordingly

14.8 Gbeitouo 

14.8.1 Introduction 

Arethuse has estimated the mineral resource for the Gbeitouo deposit as at 27 November 

2013.  Geological modelling and mineral resource estimation were done using GEOVIA 

Surpac 6.5, XLStat and Autostats software packages.  The grade estimation was completed 

using the OK and ID estimation techniques.  This estimation approach was considered 

appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of 

available data, data spatial relationship, the style and geometry of mineralization.  The grade 

estimation was based on the entire borehole database.  No boreholes or data were excluded 

from the mineral resource estimation process. 

14.8.2 Data Validation 

See Section 14.1.2 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 163 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

14.8.3 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

Three dimensional modelling was completed using GEOVIA Surpac 6.5 software.  Four 

geological entities were modelled: laterites footwall, unaltered carbonates, unaltered 

metavolcanosediments and the hanging-wall of the substratum in Metavolcano-sediments.  

Thus laterite and clayey saprolite were deduced from these elements.  Mineralization was 

modelled as envelopes with a minimal cut-off of 0.8g/t Au where intersections were greater 

than 1m, internal dilution was not more than 3m and some flexibility was allowed in the 

digitization of boundaries to conserve the continuity of the volumes.  The model consists of 11 

solids, nine in the clayey area and two in the laterites.  There is one large continuous solid 

with many mineralised borehole intersections.  There are another six which are smaller and sit 

above the large solid.  The last two are of limited extent and uncertain and sit below the large 

body. 

14.8.4 Mineralization Interpretation 

Like Mont Ity, ZiaNE and Walter, Gbeitouo is a series of parallel and subparallel mineralized 

lenses which azimuth is N030° and dipping 40-55° to the northwest (Figure 14.8.4_1).  The 

main mineralised lens is 300m long, 25m thick and has a vertical extension of 150m.  The 

Gbeitouo mineralization is hosted within a Metavolcano-sedimentary sequence.  Carbonates 

are found at the hanging wall.  The area is covered by a thin soil and laterite layer.

14.8.5 Compositing  

Most of the samples were taken at 1m interval.  A 1m interval was chosen for the composite 

length. 

14.8.6 Statistical Analysis 

Two domains (Oxidized and Fresh) detailed in Section 14.8.4 were statistically assessed.  

Two domains were statistically assessed: (i) laterites (solids 10-11); (ii) saprolite and fresh 

(solids 1-9).  All composites inside the individual modelled volumes were flagged as separate 

domains.  Separate statistics were generated for each domain and are presented in 

Table 14.8.6_1.  Seven of the solids do not have enough samples to have representative 

statistics and are thus only indicative. 

The oxidised and reduced domains were also compared separating the samples with the 3D 

geological model.  The obtained gold grades histograms are displayed in Figure 14.8.6_1. 

Population of gold grades are lognormal; which is typical of most gold deposits.   

Figure 14.8.6_1 
Gbeitouo 

Gold grades histograms for the reduced (left) and oxidised (right) domains 

 

14.8.7 Outlier Analysis 

Outlier analysis was undertaken considering the CV, confidence interval (95%), metal content, 

spatial distribution of high grade samples, and the shape of cumulative frequency plots.  

Capping was applied at 15.5g/t.

14.8.8 Bulk Densities 

Bulk densities were taken on 246 in the 2013 campaign.  Some quality control samples (12 

duplicates) tend to show a good repeatability in the measurements.  All lithologies show a 

range of values and the deposit as a whole is bimodal with a lower density saprolites and 

laterite and a higher density for the unaltered rock.  Average bulk densities were used in the 

estimation. 

 Laterites – 1.8t/m3 

 Saprolites - 1.4t/m3 

 Unaltered rock - 2.75t/m3 

14.8.9 Variography 

A variogram for the combined volumes of the six vein structures (solids 1-6) are presented in 

Table 14.8.9_1.  The anisotropy ellipsoid is subparallel to the trend of the mineralization.  

Variograms were modelled as nested spherical structures.

14.8.11 Grade Estimation 

The mineral resource estimation was carried-out using the ID and OK techniques depending 

on the amount of data in each domain.  Domains with variograms modelled were modelled 

using OK and the rest with ID2.  Estimation Parameters are given in Section 14.8.12.

Hard domain boundaries were used throughout preventing samples lying outside a 

mineralized domain from being used for the estimation.  A three-pass estimation strategy was 

applied, making use of an expanded and less restrictive sample search to the second and 

subsequent estimation passes and only considering blocks not previously assigned an 

estimate.

14.8.13 Model Validation 

The estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The review 

included the following activities: 

 Comparison of the estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset; 

 Visual checks of cross sections; 

 Swath Plots. 

The model validation checks confirmed the suitability of the methodology applied. 

14.8.14 Depletion 

No mining has taken place and no depletion has been applied. 

14.8.15 Mineral Resource Classification

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Mining of Heap Leach Operations  

Mineral reserves estimates are based on the geological models of April 2014 for Mont Ity, 

May 2014 for Walter, September 2014 for ZiaNE and Teckraie.  There has been depletion at 

Mont Ity and Walter and new mineral resource estimates for Mont Ity and ZiaNE in 2015.  The 

changes to the mineral resources at ZiaNE are minor in the oxidized zone not material to the 

mineral reserve estimation.  The changes at Mont Ity and Walter are significant to the 

deposits themselves but are a small percentage of the overall mineral resource and mineral 

reserve at SMI.  Mineral reserves were updated at the end of 2014 and will be updated again 

at the end of 2015.   

15.1.1 Mining Recovery and Dilution 

SMI is an existing conventional Open Pit mine using articulated trucks (40t class) and 

hydraulic backhoes or front shovel excavators (80t class).  Limited drill and blast activities are 

required as most of the material that is current mined is largely oxidized (clay or laterites). 

Reconciliation is conducted on a regular basis by the mine technical services on site, and the 

results have been reviewed by the Qualified Person. 

Table 15.1.1_1 indicates the call factors calculation on the mineral resource block model for 

the Mont Ity deposit (the only active deposit in 2013 and 2014).

Note Rounding has been applied 

The tonnage and grade numbers shown in the table concerning the resource models have 

been estimated using the end of year's surveys:  

 2013, the resource model has been constrained between the end of 2012 and the end of 

2013 topographic surfaces;  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 175 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 2014, the resource model has been constrained by the end of 2013 and end of 2014 

topographic surfaces. 

These numbers have been compared to the actual mine production results, and basic call 

factors have been estimated.  This analysis shows that for both 2013 and 2014, the tonnage 

call factor on lateritic ore is negative (the mine actual tonnage results are lower than the 

resource model), whereas the tonnage call factor on Clay ore is positive (mine actual tonnage 

is higher than the resource model).  The grade call factor on the lateritic ore is generally in line 

with the resource model (respectively 101% and 97% in 2013 and 2014), whereas it is 

negative concerning the clay ore (respectively 94% and 91% in 2013 and 2014).   

Overall, the call factor on total metal extracted from mining activities is positive for the clay ore 

(115% in 2013 and 105% in 2014) and negative for the lateritic ore (74% in 2013 and 86% in 

2014). 

The tonnage call factors calculated on site and used to develop the short and medium term 

planning sequences are in line with those calculated above: the tonnage call factor on clay 

ore is 115% and the tonnage call factor on lateritic ore is 90%.  On the other hand, the call 

factor used to estimate the metal recovered is more conservative compared to the one 

calculated above, especially for clay ore: the call factor on total metal extracted for lateritic ore 

is 80% (in line with the 2013 and 2014 calculated call factors), and 92% for clay ore 

(compared to 110% on average for 2013 and 2014). 

The mineral reserve statement and associated reserves estimation has used the call factors 

calculated by the site technical personnel, (Table 15.1.1_2) and used them for short and mid-

term planning for all the deposits that are planned to be processed with the Heap Leach 

operation.

15.1.2 Metallurgical Factors and Assumptions 

The SMI current operation comprises mining, crushing and stacking at a rate of 0.95Mtpa, 

with heap leaching using cyanide to recover just over 80,000 oz. of gold (2014 figures).  The 

current processing facilities are designed for the treatment of oxidized soft clay and laterite 

ore.

Process costs (inclusive of the general and administrative (G&A) costs) and recoveries used 

to generate the mineral reserves for the Heap Leach operation are shown in Table 15.1.2_1. 

The recoveries used to calculate the mineral reserves are based on SMI recommendations 

and are in line with 2014 actual results.

15.1.3 Cut-Off Grade Parameters 

The cut-off grade parameters used for the models are based on costs, royalties, process 

recoveries and metal prices supplied by SMI.  The processing costs and recoveries are 

calculated for each type of ore separately (laterite and clay) but they are assumed to be 

similar for the different deposits (for example, a lateritic ore coming from Zia NE or Mont Ity 

will have a same processing cost and recovery).  Prices and costs have been supplied in 

Euros, with an exchange rate of 1€ = 1.15 US$, the cut-off grades are show for each scenario 

(break-even, marginal and resource) of the deposits in Table 15.1.3_1.

15.1.4 Pit Optimization Parameters 

Pit optimizations have been undertaken for each deposit using the Lerchs-Grossman 

algorithm in the GEOVIA Whittle 4.5 software program.   

The deposits planned to be mined during the 3-year mine plan have been optimized for a 

"Heap Leach scenario" on top of the optimization done for the "CIL scenario".  The goal was 

to identify the most profitable shell for a "Heap Leach" scenario for each suitable deposit with 

the constraint of processing only the oxidized material.  These "Heap Leach" shells were 

contained within the "CIL" shell, and the material mined and processed with the Heap Leach 

facility is obviously not included in the mineral reserve material for the CIL plant: a projection 

of the topography as of the end of 2017 was used to constrain the resource base to run the 

optimizations in the CIL plant PFS. 

Some material that is not processable using the Heap Leach facility (essentially reduced clay 

material and granodiorite) and will be mined before the CIL plant will be operational.  SMI 

aims at stockpiling this material in a dedicated stockpile until the start of the CIL plant.  This 

limited amount of material located inside the Heap Leach pit limit is considered as "mineral 

reserve material" and will be accounted for in the CIL production plan scenario.   

Optimized pit shells considering only mineral resources of the measured and indicated 

categories have been calculated for the Mont Ity, Tontouo, Zia NE, Walter and Teckraie 

deposits.  Table 15.1.4_1 lists the parameters used in the definition of the optimized pit shells 

for mineral reserves.

The optimized pit shells are converted into final pit shells (or pit design shells) with the 

addition of a dedicated ramp for each different pit and a minimum width in the bottom of each 

different pit.  The pit design parameters are detailed in Section 16.

15.1.5 Mineral Reserves 

The mineral reserves calculation for the Mont Ity deposit and the Walter deposit were done 

using the end December 2014 topographic surveys from which the mine declared production 

for the January 2015 to July 2015 period was removed by depletion. 

Mineral reserves in those pit design shells are inclusive of mining dilution and mine recovery, 

considering mill recovery and are summarized in Table 15.1.5_1.

Base case production scheduling was completed on a bench-by-bench level for all deposits.  

Daapleu and Ity were designed with interim pits targeting high-grade material.  Initial Whittle 

Multimine results were used as a guideline for scheduling pit priorities.  Review of the 

Multimine schedule showed opportunity to reduce initial capital and risk associated with the 

Walter and Gbeitouo deposits.  To mine the Daapleu pit an important section of the Cavally 

River needs to be diverted and lot of risks related to hydrogeology will remain.  For this 

reason, Walter deposit was pushed to Year 4.  Table 16.4.5_1 depicts the mine schedule. 

15.2.1 Mining Recovery and Dilution 

The mining dilution and recovery criteria are presented in Table 15.2.2_1.  The mining 

recovery used is standard from the industry for similar type operations and material types.  A 

mining dilution exercise was carried out for each deposit where each block model was re-

blocked to different selective mining unit (SMU) sizes to see the effect to mining dilution.

The dilution is applied directly in the resource model by creating a mining model that is a 

reblocked resource model including all internal and peripheral waste.  Effective dilution from 

the reblocking process is given is Table 15.2.1_2.

Ity 5x5x2.5 8% 

Walter 5x5x2.5 8% 

Zia 5x5x2.5 8% 

 

Block Size Selection 

For the 2Mtpa PFS it was decided that the mining dilution of the various deposits will be 

simulated through reblocking of the mineral resource models.  Once the reblocking is 

performed, a block can only contain one type of rock and one grade, no partial percentage is 

allowed within a single block.  If the grade of a block is above the economic cut-off grade, it 

will be considered as ore and waste otherwise. 

This approach simulates SMU that could be selectively mined by the operational team.  The 

following factors are taken into account in selecting the SMU block size: 

 Grade control methodology 

 Mining method (Open Pit / Underground) 

 Mining equipment size 

 Use of blasting 

 Return of experience when available 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 181 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The deposits considered for the PFS were split into two main categories: 

 Hard rock pits:   Gbeitouo / Daapleu 

 Clay / soft rock pits:  Ity, Zia NE, Walter 

Hard rock pits 

The hard rock pits are anticipated to be grade controlled through systematic RC drilling and 

will require blasting. 

 Standard borehole spacing is typically in the range of 10m x 5m to 10m x 10m. 

 Drilling burden and spacing will be in the range of 4m x 4m to a depth of 6m in the ore. 

Based on the mining practice planned for the deposits a typical block size for the SMU is 10m 

x 10m x 5m.  This is a very standard block size for the equipment planned in a hard rock pit.  

A SMU block size of 10m x 10m x 5m was selected for the Daapleu and Gbeitouo pits 

Clay/soft rock pits rock pits 

The clay/soft rock pits are anticipated to be grade controlled through trenching as is 

performed currently in Mont Ity and will not require blasting. 

 Standard GC trenching spacing is typically with 1 meters interval samples along lines 
spaced at 6.5m. 

 No blasting is required and therefore the GC process can be performed every 2.5m in 
elevation. 

The various potential block sizes for the clay pits were checked versus past production in 

order to check which one provide the best results in a model to mine production reconciliation.  

This analysis shows that reblocking the model to a 5m x 5m x 2.5m dimension gives a good 

estimate of the grade (grade reconciliation is gives a 1% error with the actuals) and gives a 

similar result in term of tonnage dilution compared to the one currently used by the planning 

department on site (12% difference between the actuals and the block model predictions).  

Thus a SMU block size of 5m x 5m x 2.5m was selected for Ity, Zia NE, Walter pits. 

The selected minimum block sizes are as follows: 

 Ity, Zia NE, Walter:  5m x 5m x 2.5m 

 Daapleu / Gbeitouo:  10m x 10m x 5m

15.2.3 Cut-off grade selection 

The mineral resource cut-off grade is used to demonstrate the potential of the mineral 

resource and is not applied prior to pit optimization.  The actual ore cut-off is determined 

during the pit optimization process.  A preliminary cut-off was obtained at the end of the PFS 

update as a result of the pit optimization process using the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm.  

These cut-off grades were then used for reporting the mineral reserves.  See Table 15.2.3_1 

for the cut-off grade used in each pit.

15.2.4 Pit Optimization Parameters

operating cost per type of material was calculated based on the labour cost, fuel consumption, 

maintenance cost, etc.   

The mining costs used in the PFS update are presented in Table 15.2.4_1.

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Hydrogeological Work 

Hydrogeological studies are common to both the Heap Leach and CIL operations.  There is a 

lack of hydrogeological studies for the project.  The limited available data are related to Mont 

Ity area.  The most significant works for the Ity pit were reported by BRGM (1993), Durant et 

Violet (2003) and ANTEA (2009).  According to these studies, there are two different 

groundwater flow systems: shallow groundwater (perched) encountered at the interface 

between laterite and saprolite and deep groundwater encountered at depth with preferential 

flow through fractures and karstic features.  It has been reported that the original groundwater 

was about 10m below the ground surface.  Currently, groundwater level is low at the Ity pit 

due to pit dewatering.  However, seepage has been observed in the as-built saprolite pit slope 

as reported in the technical report.  Groundwater levels in saprolite are not clear yet because 

no piezometers have been installed to measure the water levels in this material (Mecater, 

2014). 

The conceptual hydrogeological system and pit dewatering considerations for the PFS are 

solely developed based on the review of limited hydrogeological studies carried out at Mont 

Ity area.   

Dewatering of existing pits is carried out using wells both perimeter and in-pit.  This water is 

pumped to a holding tank before being released into the environment.  The recent 

measurement at the Ity pit indicated that wells installed in granodiorite west of the pit have 

production rate of less than 10m3/hr while the wells in karstic zones associated with 

carbonate-rich rocks and marbles have the highest productivities with values higher than 

100m3/hr.  Wells in the footwall have productivities in the range of 10-50m3/hr. 

For the other pits in the vicinity of the Ity pit (Walter, Zia Nord Est), permeability is expected to 

be less than observed in the Ity pit because the formations are observed to be less karstic.  

Therefore, it is expected that a dewatering scheme used at Ity pit will be used for the future 

pits.   

No data exist for sites east of the Cavally River (Daapleu, Gbeitouo).  Due to the proximity to 

the river, it is anticipated that the water table could be very high, potentially close to the 

surface or the water level in the river.  It is also anticipated that some inter-connexion will exist 

between the river and the surrounding aquifers.  It can also be speculated that the fact that 

the geological formations in the area appear tighter and that there are no significant karsts in 

the area, groundwater inflow to the pits at east Cavally will be reduced.  Therefore the 

dewatering requirement for on both sides of the river could be different.  This needs to be 

investigated and confirmed during the next phase of the project.  In the analyses carried out 

for the design of the pit slopes, it was assumed that the pit walls are effectively depressurised 

through the dewatering of the pits.

In 2015, SMI has carried out a hydrogeological campaign to better define the hydrogeological 

systems and groundwater flow regimes for each pit.  The results are being analysed and 

therefore were not included in this report.     

16.2 Mine Geotechnical Work 

Geotechnical work is common to both the Heap Leach and CIL operations.  Geotechnical 

work was undertaken during the PFS by SNC-Lavalin during the CIL Plant PFS, and based as 

well on the actual observations at the current operating mines.  The study undertaken by 

SNC-Lavalin was limited to pit slopes assessment and was carried out in two steps: fieldwork 

and slope design.   

 Field work: It consisted of geotechnical mapping at the Ity Pit and review of existing 
exploration cores from the boreholes at the Mont Ity Extension, Daapleu, Gbeitouo, 
Walter and ZiaNE pits.  The work was conducted from 23

rd
 May to 9

th
 June 2014 as 

interim geotechnical work.  During the fieldwork, a total of 15 windows were mapped at 
the current Ity pit; and the core from 12 exploration boreholes was reviewed.  The 
findings of the fieldwork are presented in the technical report. 

 Pit slope design: The pit slope design involved the following: 

 Development of preliminary geotechnical model;  
 Selection of geotechnical parameters; 
 Sectorization of the pits; 
 Kinematic analyses at different slope angles for deferent materials in different 

sectors at different scales; 
 Mass failure analyses considering circular failure at different slope angles for 

different materials for inter-ramp and overall slopes; 
 Design for bench slopes, interamp slopes and overall pit slopes. 

All stability analyses were conducted for the Ity Extension and Daapleu pits.  As stated above, 

two types of analyses carried out are kinematic analyses and rock/soil mass failure.  Stability 

analyses have been conducted for the pit slopes at the bench scale, inter-ramp scale and 

overall pit slopes.  In general, the results of the stability analyses suggest that the failures of 

the soil pit slopes are controlled by both structures and strength of the soil mass; the rock 

slope stability is controlled by the geological structures. 

The summary of the pit slope recommendations for the Heap Leach and CIL operations is 

presented in the Table 16.2_1.

16.3 Heap Leach Operations 

16.3.1 Introduction 

SMI started its mining operation in the area in the early 90's with a 200ktpa processing 

capacity.  Since that time the facilities have been upgraded to process approximately 950ktpa 

of ore using Heap Leaching processing method. 

The typical mining equipment used for ore and waste extraction is a 70-80t class excavator 

and 40t class articulated trucks.  Another smaller excavator (2m3 bucket) is also available for 

better selectivity in some areas where waste and ore zones are closely alternating. 

The main method currently used for geological grade control is based on trenching, done by a 

small excavator (Liebherr R924 type of excavator).  The trenches are dug over a depth of 

approximately 50cm.  All the trenches are perpendicular to the main geological structures 

controlling the shape of mineralization, and they are 7.5m apart.  A sample of 3kg to 5kg is 

taken every meter inside the trenches.  Geological mapping is then done based on 

observations made in the trenches.  After being surveyed all the information is imported into 

the mining software used on site (Surpac). 

This grade control method provides good quality results and good reliability, but it has some 

limitations as it tends to slow down the mining rate. 

16.3.2 Geotechnical Engineering Assumptions 

Refer to Section 16.2. 

16.3.3 Pit Designs Parameters 

The selected optimum shells were then designed using Surpac mining software in order to 

integrate ramp access and catchment berm design.  The mining method being conventional 

open pit using excavators and haul trucks (as well as drilling and blasting when required), the 

design criteria used for the pit designs were the following: 

 Haul road width: 15m 

 Ramp grade: 10% 

 Final bench height: 5m or 10m depending on the deposits. 

 Batter angle: according to geotech recommendations  

 Berm width: according to geotech recommendations  

 Minimum mining width: 20m

16.3.4 Pit Designs 
Mont Ity 

The Mont Ity deposit is the main source of fresh ore of the current operation, and will be the 

main source of ore during the next three years of Heap Leach operation. 

The "Heap Leach" pit is shown on the Figure 16.3.4_1.  It has been designed to optimize the 

recovery of oxidised material (laterites and oxidized clays) and consists of three different 

spatially independent phases ("pushbacks") with the dumping areas on the North (Verse 

Flotouo) or East (Verst Est) of the pit.  The Mont Ity pit strip ratio will average approximately 

8.78:1 (Waste:Ore), which is low compared to industry average in Western Africa.

Plan View Showing Mont Ity Pit – Heap Leach Scenario (blocks are 100mx100m) 

 
 

Walter 

Mining of the Walter Pit (Figure 16.3.4_2) will occur in two phases: the first phase is part of 

the 3-year plan aimed at recovering only the oxidized and shallow ore of this deposit in order 

to be processed in the Heap Leach operation. 

Walter Heap Leach pit is supposed to be mined in 2017, and will need a temporary dyke on 

the east side of the pit, between the pit limit and the Cavally River, in order to prevent flooding 

from the river.  The Walter "Heap Leach" pit strip ratio will average approximately 1.33:1 (t:t), 

which is extremely favourable compared to the industry average.

ZiaNE 

Like the Walter deposit, mining at ZiaNE (Figure 16.3.4_3) will occur in two distinct phases.  A 

first phase of the pit will be mined for the Heap Leach operation, targeting only the shallower 

lateritic material to be processed in years 1-3.  The optimization done on ZiaNE for the Heap 

Leap operation considered only the lateritic ore as the current mining will need more lateritic 

ore in the near future in order to have the proper blend between clay and laterite in the heaps.  

ZiaNE "Heap Leach pit" is supposed to be mined in 2015 and its strip ratio will average 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 192 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

approximately 1.57:1 (t:t), which is again extremely favourable compared to the industry 

average.

Teckraie 

The Teckraie dump will be mined in 2016-2017 towards the end of the heap leach operation, 

as its average grade is less favourable than the previously mined deposits.  The Teckraie pit 

strip ratio will average approximately 1.73:1 (t:t).  Figure 16.3.4_4 shows an isometric view of 

the pit design.

16.4.1 Pit Optimization Parameters  

The block models for the Mont Ity Gold deposits (Ity Flat, Gbeitouo, Walter, Zia and Daapleu) 

were provided by Arethuse Geology and Coffey in various block model formats.  SNC-Lavalin 

standardized each block model for import into Whittle as a Multimine project.  Pit 

optimizations for design purposes were conducted using the Lerches-Grossman algorithm in 

GEOVIA Whittle.  SNC-Lavalin and SMI jointly selected the required optimization parameters 

to determine the most economic open pit profile.  The mine plan based on June 2015 mineral 

resource models and inclusive of pit design parameters discussed in Section 16.4.3 and is 

shown in Figure 16.4.1_1

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Heap Leach Operations 

The existing heap leach process will continue to be used as long as there is weathered ore to 

be treated.  Whilst the recovery from the heap leach is not as metallurgically efficient as the 

CIL route, the tailings from the heap leach can be reprocessed through the CIL plant. 

The heap leach process consists of blending the sources of ore (namely laterite and saprolite) 

crushing to nominally smaller than 20mm with agglomeration of the fines with up to 20kg/t Au 

of cement.  The agglomerated ore is then placed onto the heap leach pads and irrigated for 

about 60 days with a cyanide solution, in two stages.   

The gold released from the heap leach pads is directed to the solution ponds prior to being 

directed to the carbon-in-solution (CIS) columns for gold adsorption.  The resulting barren 

solution is directed to the barren solution pond and pumped back to an older heap leach pad 

for continued gold extraction.  The basic flowsheet is as depicted in Figure 17.1_1. 

The carbon is recovered and the gold is eluted by the ZADRA process with carbon being 

regenerated for reuse in the CIS plant.  The gold is recovered by electrowinning and smelted 

into doré, prior to be dispatched for refining. 

The heap leach process is reportedly recovering between 75% and 80% of the recoverable 

gold, but as there is no total gold analysis, the actual recovery is unknown.  The old heap 

leach pads from the earlier mining operations contain between 1g/t Au and 1.2g/t Au as 

reported in the geological section of this report.  It is assumed these values are total gold. 

During lift management, a 1.2mm HDPE barrier liner is placed between the under material 

and the new production.  This is one way of managing production from the heap but can 

sterilise areas and volumes in the old material from recovery. 

Considering the head grade of the Ity Mine, the heap leach process route would not have 

been the preferred technical option, but there may have been other considerations during the 

selection process for the process route. 

Cyanide detoxification with sodium hypochlorite is reported to be conducted on any excess 

solution that may flow from the ponds intermittently, but generally during excessive weather 

events.   

The available heap leach pads can accommodate up to an additional 5Mt by going to lift 

number 5, or even more if need be by an additional lift.

17.1.1 Utilities Requirements 

Electrical Energy 

As this is an operating plant, the actual energy consumption is available from production 

records.  The heap leach plant consumed 6,372MWhr during the 12 months ending June 

2015.  This is a consumption rate of about 6.5kWhr/tonne treated.   

Water Consumed 

The process plant consumed a total of 96,200m3 of fresh water during the 12 months ending 

June 2015.  This is a consumption of less than 100 litres per tonne treated.  All other process 

water requirements are made up of rain water and water from the mining pits.  The mine pits 

provided 231,000m3 during the same period. 

17.1.2 Reagents 

The major reagents consumed in the heap leach plant are as detailed below: 

 Cement: used for agglomeration – 17.4kg/tonne treated 

 Cyanide: gold extraction – 2.0kg/tonne treated 

 Activated Carbon: gold recovery – not reported but there are excessive quantities of 
activated carbon around the CIS plant 

Sodium Hypochlorite – detoxification chemical – it was reported that €750,000 was spent on 

this reagent during the last 12 months.  It is strongly recommended that mine management 

investigate alternative methods to detoxify solution prior to release. 

17.1.3 Maintenance 

During the site visit, whilst some issues were identified, the level of maintenance is generally 

acceptable, but requires good management and supervision to ensure that standards are 

maintained.  The housekeeping is acceptable, although spillage from the many conveyors 

could be reduced.  Safety issues require continuous management attention. 

17.1.4 Future Operations 

The future Heap Leach operations are expected to carry on beyond the commissioning of the 

CIL plant, scheduled towards the beginning of 2018.  The current forecast production, as 

detailed in Section 22 of this report, is expecting between 800,000t and 1,000,000t  to be 

placed per year on the heaps.  Based on the historical performance for the last 12 months, 

these production rates have been achieved and there is no reason to suspect that they 

cannot be achieved going forward, subject to appropriate maintenance regimes being 

enforced and adequate control of good safety and housekeeping standards. 

The gold recovery is forecast to be greater than 84% of the recoverable gold.  This is higher 

than has been reportedly achieved on an annual basis, but seems to have been achieved in 

recent months.

17.1.5 Qualified Person's Comments 

The heap leach plant is performing adequately.  However maintenance and general 

housekeeping requires attention.  These aspects can impact significantly upon production.   

Based on the achievements during the last 12 months, there is no reason to suspect that the 

plant will not be able to achieve up to 1,000,000t placed per annum.  It is also apparent that 

up to an additional 5Mt can be placed on the heaps. 

The heap leach plant is operating on the day-to-day basis with technical support from 

metallurgists running column leach tests and other functions, but it is apparent that there is a 

lack of experience of similar operations.  There are many suggested improvements that can 

be implemented to improve production or reduce costs.  The management team is very 

willing to consider productivity improvements. 

17.1.6 Analytical Facilities 

There is a basic analytical facility available on the mine which can determine the leachable 

gold in the ore, when crushed and pulverised to smaller than 75μm.  This is adequate as an 

approximation for the mining and processing plant performance but is not regarded by the QP 

as adequate for evaluation purposes.  The laboratory does send daily samples to an 

accredited SGS facility in Abidjan for total gold determination on an irregular basis and the 

data between the mine and SGS is compared, eventually.  It seems that the laterites are in 

close agreement but the clays have a distinct separation, indicating locked gold in this 

material. 

The laboratory can analyse for gold and copper in solutions only.  There is no environmental 

laboratory.  In the past there was a small wet chemistry section, but this is now in disuse.  A 

small muffle furnace is available for analysing gold on activated carbon and other techniques 

requiring 'ashing'. 

A control laboratory is located at the CIS plant to determine solution gold values, cyanide 

strength and solution pH.  This is for control purposes only. 

A metallurgical laboratory performing ore stability and column leach tests is in operation and 

the data generated is used to determine operational parameters such as cement 

consumption and cyanide requirements, as well as the release rate of gold from the heap.   

This analytical facility is regarded by the QP as adequate for the Heap Leach operation.   

The 2Mpta CIL PFS has included staff to operate a laboratory, and a modern laboratory is 

specifically mentioned in the infrastructure description but is not detailed. 

17.1.7 Qualified Person's Comments 

It is recommended by the QP that a well-managed full analytical and environmental 

laboratory be provided with any future projects, or even earlier if possible.

17.2 CIL operations 

The CIL process plant design includes primary crushing, two stage grinding, pre-leach 

thickening, leach and carbon-in-leach (CIL), detoxification (cyanide destruction and arsenic 

precipitation), gold elution/carbon regeneration and refining operations.  The process 

flowsheet is illustrated in Figure 17.2_1.

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

17.2.1 Primary Crushing 

Ore is trucked to the crushing area in mine trucks, and is either directly dumped into the truck 

dump hoppers or placed in a run-of-mine stockpile for later reclaim using a front-end loader.   

Softer and stickier ores, such as oxidized or reduced clay and laterite lithologies, are sent to a 

mineral sizer crusher installation.  The mineral sizer has been designed with a capacity of 

282tph and will operate 24 hours per day.  Harder ore, such as the granodiorite, daaplite and 

meta-volcano sediments lithologies, are sent to jaw crusher installation.  The crusher has 

been designed with a capacity of 282tph and will operate 24 hours per day. 

Both crushers discharge are conveyed directly to the primary SAG mill.  A coarse ore 

stockpile between the crushing stations and the SAG mill is not part of the design because of 

the soft and very sticky characteristics of about 50% of the plant feed material, such as 

oxidized and reduced clays, heap leach residues, etc.  These types of material consolidate 

and agglomerate and are extremely difficult to withdrawn from stockpile.  With the present 

concept including two different crusher types with their own run-of-mine stockpile, each one 

having the capacity to meet full plant tonnage, it is anticipated that 90% plant availability can 

be maintained, but this will need to be reconsidered during a future feasibility study as 

crushing circuits are normally prone to poor availability. 

However, at a later stage of the project, at higher tonnage, an intermediate coarse ore 

stockpile may have to be introduced.  In this instance, reclaiming of the ore is by front end 

loader rather than feeders are likely the route to go because of the soft and very sticky 

characteristics of a major portion of the material. 

17.2.2 Grinding 

The primary grinding mill has been sized to process ore at an average rate of 254tph, with a 

90% availability.  The SAG mill size is 6.7m diameter by 3.4m long (effective grinding length), 

driven by a 2,600 kW motor equipped with a variable speed drive (VFS).  The secondary ball 

mill is 4.8m diameter by 7.2m long driven by a 2,600kW motor. 

This circuit is designed to operate with a circulating load of up to 250% utilizing hydro-

cyclones.  The cyclone underflow stream is redirected to the SAG and ball mill feed chutes in 

the following proportions: 

 Circulating load to SAG mill: 50%; 

 Circulating load to ball mill: 200%.  

The cyclone cluster consists of ten off 375mm diameter cyclones, with eight (8) cyclones in 

operation and two on stand-by.  Cyclone overflow is collected in a common launder, which 

flows to the pre-leach thickening area. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 205 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

17.2.3 Pre-Leach Thickening 

The purpose of the pre-leach thickening area is to increase the solids content of the ground 

ore slurry feeding the leach and CIL circuits from approximately 30.0% solids to 43.0% solids.  

The water recovered at the thickener overflow is re-used as process water throughout the 

plant. 

The pre-leach thickener is preceded by a linear trash screen to prevent oversized grit and 

general blasting and other trash from entering the leach and CIL circuits.  The screen 

undersize falls into a collection launder that feeds the thickener feed box.  Diluted flocculant is 

added to the feed box to promote particles sedimentation in the thickener.  Thickener 

underflow is sampled (for head grade determination) and then pumped to the leach and CIL 

circuit. 

17.2.4 Leach and Carbon-In-Leach 

In the leach and CIL circuit, gold present in the pulp is dissolved using cyanide and then 

adsorbed onto activated carbon.  The circuit consists of two leach tanks followed by six CIL 

tanks with a total of 32-hour residence time in the eight tanks. 

Cyanide is added to the leach tanks for gold leaching.  Lime can also be added to maintain 

the pH level at 10.5 - 11.0.  Cyanide solution can also be added to the first and third CIL 

tanks. 

All eight tanks are fitted with an agitator, incorporating dual axial flow impellers.  Air is 

introduced into each tank through a bottom entering line beneath an inverted cone, located 

below the lower impeller of the agitator.   

Activated carbon is added to the last CIL tank and carbon is advance intermittently from tank 

to tank counter-current to the slurry flow by the vertical recessed impeller pumps.  Loaded 

carbon recovered from the first CIL tank is pumped to the loaded carbon recovery screen.  

The recovered carbon is pumped in 4t batches to the carbon acid wash vessel located in the 

carbon acid wash and elution area.   

Slurry from the last CIL tank flows by gravity to the linear safety screen.   

17.2.5 Detoxification 

The detoxification circuit consists of a linear safety screen, used to capture fugitive loaded 

fine carbon, and three cyanide detoxification tanks providing about one hour retention time 

each.   

In the first cyanide detoxification tank, Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is added in the form of sodium 

metabisulphite solution.  Copper sulphate is added to catalyse the reaction.  Compressed, air 

is injected to oxidize the cyanide contained in the CIL tails.  A second and third detoxification 

tanks are installed in order to precipitate the arsenic present in the slurry.  A solution of ferric 

sulphate and sulphuric acid is used to precipitate the arsenic. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 206 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Slurry exiting the third tank is pumped to the TSF for disposal.   

Tailings Storage Facility 

The tailings dam is discussed elsewhere in this document.  The solution recovered from the 

TSF is recycled back to the process plant to be used as make-up water. 

17.2.6 Carbon Acid Wash and Elution 

The acid wash circuit, using hydrochloric acid, removes acid soluble impurities that have 

accumulated on the activated carbon during the CIL process steps, such as lime scale and 

some heavy metals.  After the acid wash process, residual acid solution is neutralized with a 

caustic rinse cycle.  The acid wash and neutralization cycle is expected to take up to 4 hours 

The acid washed carbon is introduced to the elution column which is operating at elevated 

temperature and pressure to strip the gold from the carbon.  The stripping cycle starts with 

the introduction of cyanide and sodium hydroxide (caustic) solutions.  This barren solution is 

heated through heat exchangers and a heater prior to entering the elution column.  The 

eluate solution, at up to 145°C, enters the pressure column and up-flows through the 

contained carbon bed.  The solution strips the metals that are loaded onto the activated 

carbon and exits from the top of the column,  

This pregnant solution is pumped to the electrowinning cells via recovery heat exchangers, 

where gold (as metal) is recovered onto stainless steel cathodes.  The elution operation is 

expected to take up to 12 hours.  Under normal design conditions, one elution cycle is 

required per day.  However, when high grade ore is process through the CIL plant, two acid 

wash and elution cycles can be accommodated per day. 

17.2.7 Electrowinning and Smelting 

The purpose of electrowinning is to recover by electrolysis the gold and silver dissolved in the 

concentrated solution following the hot elution.  After electrolysis, the gold is smelted into 

doré (gold bars) in an induction furnace.   

Electrowinning and smelting are located within a secured portion of the process plant.  The 

gold bars are kept into a secured vault prior to shipment.   

17.2.8 Carbon Regeneration 

Stripped carbon is transferred to the carbon regeneration circuit where the carbon is 

screened and delivered to the regeneration kiln, operating at about 700°C.  After passing 

through the kiln, the carbon discharges into a quench tank.   

The carbon regeneration kiln is designed to regenerate the entire carbon stream and restore 

the activity of the stripped carbon. 

Carbon losses are made up by introducing fresh attrited carbon into the circuit as required.

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

17.2.9 Reagents 

The reagents used in the process plant are summarily described as follows: 

 Grinding Media: for milling in the SAG and Ball Mills; 

 Hydrated lime: for pH control in the grinding, leach and CIL circuit.  However, at a later 
stage of the project, the usage of quick lime may prove to be advantageous and 
considered, particularly at higher plant throughput.   

 Sodium cyanide: for gold dissolution in the leach and CIL circuit and for the barren 
stripping solution preparation; 

 Hydrochloric acid for the carbon acid wash circuit. 

 Sodium hydroxide (caustic): for the carbon neutralization in the acid wash circuit, and 
for pH control of the barren solution in the elution circuit; 

 Flocculant: to assist pre-leach thickener underflow sedimentation and overflow 
clarification; 

 Sodium metabisulphite: for cyanide destruction;  

 Copper sulphate: to catalyse the cyanide destruction reaction; 

 Ferric Sulphate: to precipitate arsenic in detoxified tails; 

 Sulphuric acid: to dissolve ferric sulphate which requires a pH <3 to solubilize. 

17.2.10 Plant Services 

Plant/Instrument Air 

Three compressors are provided for instrument and plant air requirements. 

Low Compressed Air 

Process air for leaching is supplied by three low pressure compressors.  An air receiver is 

provided between the compressor and distribution. 

Fresh Water 

Fresh water is sourced from existing mine wells and is stored in a fresh/fire water storage 

tank.  The lower portion of the tank provides for demand of fire water and the top portion of 

the tank provides storage for fresh and gland water. 

Process Water 

The process water tank is fed from three sources.  The main source is the pre-leach thickener 

over flow, the second source of water is recycled water from the polishing pond located at 

TSF, and finally the make-up water is coming from the fresh water well.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Current Infrastructures 

18.1.1 Mining Facilities 

The following mining facilities are located on the Ity site:  

 Mining administration building;  

 Main workshop and repair facilities, to maintain the mining fleet;  

 Mining equipment re-fuelling centre;  

 Explosive storage, located away from the main facilities;  

18.1.2 Process Plant 

The processing plant and administration facilities consist of the following:  

 Plant administration buildings such as the security office, workshop, administration 
offices and metallurgical lab; 

 Warehouses;  

 Water services inclusive of raw water abstraction, potable water, fire water;  

 Medical facilities located at the site entrance. 

18.1.3 Power 

The electrical power is supplied from the Ivorian national grid as well as diesel generators. 

The current power supply from the national grid being unstable, the back-up diesel 

generators capacity is sized to maintain all activities on site, including normal operation of the 

plants facilities during power outages.  

18.1.4 Site Access 

Access to the site for employees and contractors is possible via tar road from Abidjan in 

approximately eight hours.  Alternatively, air transportation is possible from Abidjan to Man in 

two hours and then road from Man to the site in additional hours.  The current logistical 

scheme for people transportation will be used for the future CIL operations as well. 

Contracted buses provide transportation to work for personnel living in the nearby villages of 

the Ity site. 

18.1.5 Security 

The main entrance security office is located on the Main Site access road.  All visitors to the 

mine complex report to this security gate for authorization prior to entry.  Personal protection 

equipment (PPE) is available for issue from this point if required.  



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 209 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

18.1.6 Accommodation 

The accommodation camp is located on a hill top to house senior and junior staff members. 

Staff accommodation consists of:  

 Individual block building for senior managers; 

 Shared block buildings with 3 bedrooms for junior staff; 

 Kitchen and camp dining room;  

 Laundry;  

 Potable water plant;   

The camp can accommodate approximately 200 persons.  

18.1.7 Transport and Logistics 

Cote d'Ivoire has been developing country infrastructures for years with a wide network of tar 

roads available as well as 2 industrial ports (Abidjan / San Pedro).  Existing transport 

infrastructures are sufficiently developed and maintained to support active mining operations 

in the country, including for the Ity operations.  SMI has been operating the Ity site for more 

than 20 years based on existing infrastructures (roads/port/tc.) without interruption due to 

logistical issues.  Equipment, Materials and consumables transportation from the port in 

Abidjan to the mine site is carried out by a combination of subcontractors. The distance is 

approximately 700km (by road), and about 2,000t of consumables are transported each year 

to the site of the heap-leach operations..  

Airfreight cargo service into Côte d'Ivoire is supplied by several scheduled flights. 

In addition, the Ity site is accessible via helicopter for Dore transportation to the Abidjan 

airport, from which it is then exported to Europe.  The current logistical scheme for gold 

export will be used for the CIL operations as well. 

18.1.8 Communication 

An on-site communication tower allows cellular phone communication through three mobile 

phone access providers, and internet access.  In addition, a fibre optic access was developed 

in 2014. 

The mobile network is accessible in the mine site, the processing facilities, the administration 

buildings as well as the site camp. 

18.2 Site Access and Infrastructure for the CIL Project 

Logistics for construction materials and equipment as well logistics for consumables for 

current and future operations is considered a low risk given the existing infrastructure in Côte 

d'Ivoire. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 210 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

A more comprehensive review of the various accesses to the site will be conducted in the 

next phase of the project to improve the existing scheme and secure the best access to the 

site for large equipment delivery.  In case of oversized and/or overweight equipment, 

adequately designed equipment will be purchased to ensure safe and efficient delivery to the 

site 

New roads will be designed for 40 t articulated trucks at elevation 262.6m to avoid flooding 

beyond the 20-year-flood zone limit.  A one-way bridge will cross the Cavally River. 

Preliminary geotechnical information shows that excavation material can be used as backfill 

for civil work.  Potable water will be supplied from a well that will be within 500m from the 

process plant.  The treatment of sewage will be done through a tank followed by a septic 

field.  A fire water network will surround the process buildings.  Electricity will be provided by 

a new transmission line of 33kV (transmission Voltage to be confirmed) This new 

transmission line will be built by the local Utility CIE ( Cote d'Ivoire Electricity) and must be 

further  developed at the next phase.  A main substation will step down voltage to 6.6kV for 

site distribution. 

The existing on-site communication system will be available for the CIL Project. 

The mobile network is accessible in the mine site, the processing facilities, the administration 

buildings as well as the site camp. 

Construction facilities will include construction site office, concrete batch plant, prefabricated 

shop and store supply, maintenance shop, storage areas, warehouse, and a laboratory.  The 

construction contractor and labour will be hosted in the hotels of nearby town.  A construction 

camp may be required.  This item will need to be confirmed in the next phase of the study. 

Buildings comprise a gatehouse including the dry, an administrative office including the 

infirmary, a metallurgical and assay laboratory and a reagent storage building.  All other 

process plant facilities will be uncovered structures required to support and operate the 

process equipment.  The only enclose area will be the electrical rooms, compressor room, fire 

protection pump room and refinery area.

18.3 Tailing Storage Facility for the CIL Project 

A site selection study was carried out on four potential sites for the TSF within a short 

pumping distance from the future plant.  Three of the sites were discarded, two for lack of 

detailed topography, proximity to SMI camp and lack of adequate storage capacity and one 

for potential presence of mineral reserves in one of the abutments.  The remaining site, 

namely "Area 1", was identified as the most suitable location for the future tailings storage 

facility.  The selected TSF site provides storage for approximately 10 years of operation 

provided the tailings reaches an in situ dry density of 1.3t/m3. 

The preparation of the TSF basin involves the construction of water management diversion 

ditches, preparation and grading of the basin floor for liner installation and the construction of 

a retaining structure.  The 44m high dam is to be constructed in several stages; the first two 

raises are to be constructed using the downstream method and the upstream method 

thereafter.  The geomembrane on the upstream face is made continuous with that of the 

basin; the membrane is installed on a controlled layer of impervious material providing 

composite liner effect.  

An emergency spillway capable of evacuating the 24-hour probable maximum flood is 

provided for every stage. 

18.4 Water Management for the CIL Project 

18.4.1 Cavally River  

The Cavally River watershed is located in the mountainous central western Côte d'Ivoire.  The 

source of the river is located in eastern Guinea in the area of Nimba Range.  Tropical 

conditions prevail at the mine site at Ity.  The climate in the area is characterized by marked 

dry and wet seasons resulting in a large variation in river flows during the year.  The rainy 

season occurs between April and October and the dry season from November to March 

The Cavally River which runs on the eastern side of the current mining operation constitutes a 

major constraint for the development of the Walter and Daapleu pits.  Hence, a diversion of 

the Cavally River and the construction of perimeter dikes around the Walter, Daapleu and 

Gbeitouo pits are required. 

The original Cavally River diversion plan was to build two diversion canals one for deviating 

the river from the area around Walter and the other one for deviating the river from the area of 

Daapleu.  A trade-off study carried out after the PFS demonstrated that the capital cost and 

the risks associated with the diversion of Cavally River for Walter pit were too significant for 

the quantity of ore recovered from this location.  Hence, SMI decided to partly mine the Walter 

pit and slightly reduce the mine reserve associated with that pit.  Therefore, the diversion of 

Cavally River for Walter pit was cancelled.  The layout of the remaining diversion for the 

bypass of the river at Daapleu pit is presented in Figure 18.4.1_1.

The proposed trapezoidal shaped diversion channel and closure dikes will ensure the normal 

flow of the Cavally River.  During a major rain event, the Cavally River will overflow its banks 

inundating the floodplain.  The diversion channel and closure dikes will then be fully 

submerged. 

Perimeter dikes are required to ensure the stability and continuous safe operation of the 

different pits located in the floodplain, when Cavally River overflows its banks.  The proposed 

location for the different perimeter dikes is presented in Figure 18.2 and takes into account 

the required setback with respect to the pit rim.  The typical cross section of the dykes is 

homogeneous embankment to be constructed of impervious material covered with erosion 

protection material. 

18.4.2 Hydrogeology  

The conceptual hydrogeological system and pit dewatering considerations at the time of 

writing are solely developed based on the review of limited hydrogeological studies carried out 

at Mont Ity area.  According to these studies, there are two different groundwater flow 

systems: shallow groundwater (perched) encountered at the interface laterite and deep 

groundwater encountered at depth with preferential flow through fractures and karstic 

features.  It has also been reported that the original groundwater was about 10m below the 

ground surface at Mont Ity.  

Groundwater dewatering of existing pit is carried out using wells both perimeter and in-pit.  

Dewatering water is pumped to a holding tank before to be released to the environment.  The 

recent measurement at the Ity pit indicated that wells installed in granodiorite west of the pit 

have production rate less than 10m3/hr while wells in karstic zones associated with carbonate 

rocks and marbles have the highest productivities with values higher than 100m3/hr.  Wells in 

the footwall have productivities in the range of 10-50m3/hr. 

For the other pits in the vicinity of the Ity pit (Walter, Zia Nord Est), permeability are expected 

to be less than observed in the Ity pit because the formations are observed to be less karstic. 

Therefore, it is expected that a dewatering scheme used at Ity pit will be used for the future 

pits.  

No data exist for sites east of the Cavally River (Daapleu, Gbeitouo).  Due to the proximity to 

the river, it is anticipated that the water table could be very high, potentially close to the 

surface or the water level in the river.  It is also anticipated that some inter-connexion will exist 

between the river and the surrounding aquifers.  The geological formations in the area appear 

tighter and given that there are no significant karsts in the area, it is possible that the 

groundwater inflow to the pits east Cavally River will be reduced.  Therefore the dewatering 

requirement and scheme for both sides of the river could be different.  This needs to be 

investigated and confirmed during the next phase of the project.

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

In 2015, SMI has carried out a hydrogeological campaign to better define the hydrogeological 

systems for each pit.  The results are being analysed and therefore were not included in this 

report at the time of writing. 

18.4.3 Sitewide Water Balance  

The general water management strategy is to divert the non-contact surface runoff away from 

the mine facilities and manage (collect, control, monitor and treat, if required) the contact 

water prior discharging to the environment.  Final effluents from the mine facilities to the 

environment should meet the effluent discharge criteria.  

Water within the open pits should be collected and pumped out of the active pit areas, and 

released to the Cavally River if water quality meets the applicable discharge criteria.  

At the time of writing this report, it is assumed that there will be no potential Acid Rock 

Drainage (ARD) and toxic metal leaching issues from the waste dumps.  Drainage from the 

waste dumps could be directly released to the environment with adequate erosion and 

sediment control measures in place.  

The TSF water management system includes a water pond created within the tailings storage 

basin and a Polishing Pond downstream of the TSF dam.  Excess water from the tailings 

water pond will spill into the Polishing Pond.  The two water ponds will provide sufficient 

residence time for Total Suspended Solid (TSS) control. 

Effluents from the open pits, waste dumps, TSF and other mine facilities should be monitored 

and tested.  If the test results indicate any chemical issues, water should be collected and 

treated prior being discharged to the environment. 

A preliminary average annual water balance scheme is developed for the mine site based on 

the review of limited information on site climate, hydrology and land use.  Detailed water 

management strategy, drainage plan and site water balance should be developed in the next 

phase of the study.  

18.4.4 Geochemistry  

Tailings and waste rock materials have yet to be characterized in terms of probable loadings 

of acidity, metals and sulphate salinity and thus the requirement for water treatment of 

associated contact water is yet to be determined.   

To address this information gap, a staged approach has been planned that comprises the 

following:  

 A screening level geochemical test work program; 

 A feasibility level geochemical test work program. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 215 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The screening level geochemical test work program will seek to identify potentially acid 

generating waste rock and tailings materials as well as qualify the likely loadings of acidity, 

sulphate salinity and leachable metals and metalloids. 

The feasibility level geochemical test work program will focus upon problematic waste rock or 

tailings materials that have been identified by the screening level geochemical test work 

program. Its intention will be to address data gaps and provide sufficient information to enable 

the water treatment design for the project (where required). 

The screening level for geochemical testing is not available at the time of writing. 

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

The Ity operations have been an ongoing concern for more than 20 years; no additional 

marketing studies were undertaken for the heap-leach operations and future CIL operations. 

The current and future operations produce gold doré bullion that is a fungible commodity for 

which an efficient global market exists.  It is of high value density meaning that the realised 

price of the contained gold is insensitive to the ultimate location of the customer and refinery 

as freight costs are negligible in comparison to contained value. 

The gold price used in the financial analysis is considered net of US$5/oz for bullion transport, 

insurance and refining costs.   

Gold output from the Ity operations is in the form of doré bars.  The doré is shipped to Europe 

(Switzerland) for refining at Metalor Technologies S.A.  The refining contract currently in place 

between SMI and Metalor is valid for an unlimited period of time. 

The SMI does not have any hedging program or forward sales contracts for production 

coming from the Ity Mine property. 

The long term gold pricing forecast used for the heap-leach and CIL operations at €1,045 per 

ounce net of bullion transport cost is consistent with current gold prices.   

No contracts for the sale of the production have been entered into. 

No contracts for the construction of the CIL project have been entered into.  A contract for the 

development of the feasibility study of the CIL project is currently active with SNC LAVALIN 

from Canada.  As of the effective date of this report, the main contractors involved with the 

mine and current heap-leach operations are: 

 Fuel supply: Total Côte d'Ivoire;  

 Contract security staff: G4S;  

 Contract mining: RAZEL; 

 Refining: Metalor; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 216 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Reagent supply (cyanide) for 2015-2016 period: AZAL; 

 Other reagents supply: LDC and CHIMTEC; 

 Cement supply: SOCIM; 

 Tyres supply: TRACTAFRIC; 

 Catering services: DJM; 

 Air transportation: ELITE CORPORATE. 

The various contracts were awarded following a competitive bidding process, prices are within 

the industry range and comparable to other operations in Côte d'Ivoire or West Africa.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Overview 

Several environmental studies have been conducted in the last 15 years.  Geostat has 

conducted two internal reports for SMI: an environmental management plan (Plan de 

Management Environnemental) dated March 2000 and a rehabilitation plan (Réaménagement 

du site minier d'Ity) dated June 2005.  An EIS for the Ity Mine has been carried out in 2000 by 

SMI.  This study has been used as a reference in the rehabilitation report titled 

"Réaménagement du Site Minier d'Ity" (SMI, 2005).  The Ministry of the Environment also 

conducted an environmental audit of the Ity Mine at the end of December 2005. 

Finally, under the mining project CIL and in order to renew the SMI Mining Permit PE26, two 

SEIA studies have also been completed: 

 Étude d'impact environnemental et social du projet de construction d'une usine de 

traitement de minerai de type CIL sur le permis d'exploitation PE26 de la mine d'or ITY 

(Roche, 2013). 

 Étude d'impact environnemental et social dans le cadre du projet d'exploitation des 

gisements de Gbeitouo et de Daapleu dans le département de Blolequin (2D 

Consulting, 2015). 

In addition to the exploitation of two new deposits, this project includes the diversion of the 

Cavally River (four river closure dams), the construction of a bridge and of three perimeter 

dikes to protect Walter, Gbeitouo and Daapleu deposits. 

There is an SEIA on progress related to these infrastructures.  The public enquiry is planned 

to start at the end of September 2015.  The decree, which authorizes the construction and 

operation of the projected infrastructures, should be obtained as early as the fourth quarter of 

2015. 

The three SEIAs were performed according to the Loi Cadre No. 96-766 of 3 October 1996 on 

the Environmental Code, the Décret No.  96-894 of 8 November 1996 establishing the rules 

and procedures applicable to studies of the environmental impacts of development projects 

and the Arrêté No. 00972 of 14 November 2007 on the application of Décret No. 96-894. 

The SEIA for the construction for the CIL plant was approved by the Ivorian authorities in 

December 2013 (Arrêté 008/Mine SUDD/ANDE).  A revision will be required for a larger 

throughput rate of the CIL plant and modifications to the locations of some of the associated 

infrastructure. 

A resettlement action plan is also currently in preparation.

20.2 Project Description 

The site currently uses a heap-leach process with cyanide solution application.  The 

development project encompasses a CIL process plant, water plant services and several on-

site infrastructures.  Descriptions of the mining operations current and planned (Section 16), 

plant processes (Section 17) and Infrastructure (Section 18) are given in earlier sections. 

20.3 Summary of Key Environmental and Social Issues (PFS) 

Important social and environmental issues, potential risks and constraints have been 

identified during the PFS phase in relation to the CIL Gold Project (Roche, 2013; 2D 

Consulting, 2015).  Key impacts that have been addressed within the SEIAs have mainly 

been derived from project information, field inventories and public consultation, existing 

studies and experience on similar projects.   

The environmental impact studies carried out within the framework of the Ity Mine expansion 

project show that there are two major critical issues that are actually addressed in further 

details in the DFS: biodiversity (critical habitats) and the relocation of project-affected people. 

No groundwater data exist for east of the Cavally sites (Daapleu, Gbeitouo).  Due to the 

proximity to the river, it is anticipated that the water table could be very high, potentially close 

to the surface or the water level in the river.  It is also anticipated that some inter-connexion 

will exist between the river and the surrounding aquifers.  The geological formations in the 

area appear tighter and given that are no significant karsts in the area, it is possible that 

groundwater inflow to the pits at east Cavally will be reduced.  Therefore the dewatering 

requirement for pits located at different side of the river is expected to be different.  This 

needs to be investigated and quantified during the next phase of the project. 

The general water management strategy is to divert the non-contact surface runoff away from 

the mine facilities and manage (collect, control, monitor and treat, if required) the contact 

water prior discharging to the environment.  Final effluents from the mine facilities to the 

environment should meet the effluent discharge criteria. 

Water within the open pits should be collected and pumped out of the active pit areas, and 

released to the Cavally River if water quality meets the applicable discharge criteria. 

In the PFS, it is assumed that there will be no potential Acid Rock Drainage and toxic metal 

leaching issues from the waste dumps.  Drainage from the waste dumps could be directly 

released to the environment with adequate erosion and sediment control measures in place. 

The TSF water management system includes a water pond created within the tailings storage 

basin and a Polishing Pond downstream of the TSF dam.  Excess water from the tailings 

water pond will spill into the Polishing Pond.  The two water ponds will provide sufficient 

residence time for Total Suspended Solid (TSS) control. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 219 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Effluents from the open pits, waste dumps, TSF and other mine facilities should be monitored 

and tested.  If the test results indicate any chemical issues, water should be collected and 

treated prior being discharged to the environment. 

Tailings and waste rock materials have yet to be characterized in terms of probable loadings 

of acidity, metals and sulphate salinity and thus the requirement for water treatment of 

associated contact water is yet to be determined. 

Many fauna and flora species occurring in the study area depend upon a particular habitat 

type (or a combination of habitat types), such as the gallery forests.  Loss, fragmentation, and 

degradation of these habitats have a negative impact on the fauna and flora species that 

depend on them.   

Loss of habitat might cause reduction in the populations of species that depend on that 

habitat.  Under normal circumstances, species populations are at "carrying capacity" 

(e.g. species populations expand until they reach the maximum number that the ecosystem is 

able to support, thereafter density-dependent mortality keeps numbers at that sustainable 

level).  Even large, mobile species such as mammals or birds cannot simply "move 

somewhere else" if their habitat is destroyed – other areas will either already be at carrying 

capacity or be unsuitable.   

Habitat fragmentation reduces the viability of populations, because small fragments of habitat 

can only support small sub-populations of plants and animals, which are more vulnerable to 

extinction.  Minor fluctuations in climate, food availability or other factors that would be 

unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations, can be significant in small isolated 

populations.  Fragmentation can cause particular problems for species requiring extensive 

range to satisfy their ecological needs.  Habitat degradation can render habitat unsuitable for 

many species, or can severely reduce the population size that an area of habitat is able to 

support.   

Any destruction, alteration or fragmentation of the residual primary forest is thus a threat to 

fauna species.  Forest habitats are already experiencing strong pressure within the study 

area, primarily as a result of clearance for subsistence agriculture. 

Among the main threats to the aquatic species, the diversion of the Cavally River may 

certainly change significantly the hydrological conditions and consequently affect the habitats 

of certain fish species.  This issue is addressed closely in the DFS considering that the initial 

fish inventory has already identified nine species of conservation concern. 

Considering that 18 species of conservation concern (flora, freshwater fish, fauna) are present 

in the study area and considering that Côte d'Ivoire has the highest level of biodiversity in 

West Africa, the issue of having potential critical habitats in the study area is actually 

addressed in accordance with the requirements of the IFC's Performance Standard 6 during 

the DFS stage (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural 

Resources) which is the internationally recognized reference standard on critical habitats. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 220 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Maintaining and expanding the activities of the Ity Mine will have a considerable positive 

impact on villages located in the surroundings of the mine.  In addition to maintaining the 

current jobs, the continued operation of the mine will have a significant structuring economic 

effect at the local and regional levels mainly because of the weakness of the industrial sector 

at the local and regional level. 

Several livelihood activities are currently conducted in the study area.  The mining of new 

deposits and the construction of supporting infrastructure is likely to generate a negative 

impact on some of these traditional activities. 

According to 2D Consulting (2015) approximately 330 households in Daapleu will be 

displaced in addition to a water point, some cemeteries and farms.  A new appropriate site for 

the relocated population was proposed and approved by the displaced population and the 

Ivorian authorities.   

Involuntary resettlement of population is a very sensitive issue and the exercise is usually 

implemented within the framework of the recognized best practices such as the World Bank 

Safeguard Policy O.P. 4.12.  The exercise is composed of two steps: establishment of the 

resettlement framework (RF) followed by a resettlement action plan (RAP). 

The RF is the resettlement strategy including procedural guidelines for the formulation of 

resettlement and compensation principles, organizational arrangements and design criteria to 

be applied in the RAP, aiming at linking and adapting resettlement policies, standards and 

principles to the project's specific social context and reality.  It should be meant to provide an 

extensive understanding of the situation, and tailor guidelines to ensure the resettlement plan 

and services will effectively answer the needs of the project and the project affected persons 

(PAPs) and communities.  The resettlement action plan is actually updated to be consistent 

with the resettlement framework. 

20.4 Stakeholder's Identification 

Stakeholders consist of organizations and individuals who may be directly or indirectly 

affected (positively or negatively), or have an interest in the project.   

As part of the environmental approval process for the renewal of the Operation License PE26, 

the surrounding villages have been consulted, including: Ity, Bientouo, Floleu, Trogleu, 

Krozialé, Ouyatouo and Kouepleu (Roche 2013).  People consulted include administrative 

and traditional authorities, general population, youth, women, village leaders, owners or 

managers of socio-economic activities. 

Overall, the results of the consultation indicate that people are supportive of the project but 

have several claims (e.g. construction of a water tower, financial aid, local recruitment, 

acquisition of an ambulance, etc.).  The main impacts raised by local population are related to 

the poor management of resettlement, the limited local recruitment and the positive economic 

and social benefits.   



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 221 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Also, within the framework of the SEIA for the exploitation of the Gbeitouo and Daapleu 

deposits, 2D Consulting Afrique conducted public consultation activities in the project area in 

order to promote a participatory approach in collecting the views of all stakeholders involved 

in the project and take them into account during its implementation. 

The consultations revealed that these stakeholders held diverse views on the SMI's gold 

mining project in the department of Bloléquin.  However, the people consulted can be divided 

into two groups: those who view the project positively and those who view it positively subject 

to the concerns rose by stakeholders being addressed.   

The concerns expressed are diverse and related to the destruction of plantations, pristine 

forests, sacred and burial sites, loss of farmlands, relocation of villages and camps and 

children's future.  However, the stakeholders in general want the villages affected by the 

project to be supported by the Project Developer with the construction of new villages with 

modern houses and basic social infrastructure, compensation for destroyed plantations and 

sacred sites and cemeteries, and employment for their children. 

The public consultations showed that all the stakeholders consulted (12 groups out of 17) 

approve the construction of the project on the proposed site.  Five (5) other groups welcome 

the project, albeit with reservations. 

20.5 Environmental and Social Scope of Work for the DFS 

The scope of work is currently in progress for the environmental and social component of the 

Definitive Feasibility Study comprises the following elements: 

 Establish the complementary baseline surveys for the new sites of the CIL plant tailings 
site;  

 Ensure that the content of the SEIAs for the SMI CIL Gold project fulfills the 
requirements of the recognized international standards (Equator principles/IFC 
Performance Standards); 

 Conduct noise and ambient air quality measurements (background) for the entire study 
area; 

 Elaborate a synthesis report (SYR) on the three SEIAs to address the cumulative 
impact issues, including noise propagation assessment, ambient air quality assessment 
and technological risk assessment. 

A synthesis report (SYR) of the three SEIAs of the project will be prepared.  The objectives of 

the impact assessment report are: 

 Regroup and synthesize the impacts in a stand-alone report; 

 Assess effects on a larger study area; 

 Assess effects during a potentially larger period in the future; 

 Consider cumulative effects on valued ecosystem components due to interactions with 
different sources of actions or components; 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 222 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

 Include existing and future reasonably foreseeable actions; 

 Evaluate significance in regards to other than just local or direct effects. 

The global noise propagation calculation, ambient air quality modeling and technical risk 

assessment will be conducted at the stage of the synthesis report. 

The integrated and social assessment report completion is planned for the end of 2015. 

20.6 Environmental Legal Framework 

It should be noted that the Environmental Code (Law No. 96 766) and Decree No 96-894 on 

Environmental impact assessment approval was only adopted in 1996.  Consequently, SMI 

initially operated in 1991 under the following decree – "Permis d'exploitation" 

(No. 147/Mines/DXX-10/14/1989) issued by the Ministry of Mines.  This decree has been 

reissued several times since 1989 (1994, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2013 and 2014). 

According to the legislation of the Côte d'Ivoire Republic there are three major laws which 

have a concern with the environment: a mining law (Loi No 95-553, Code Minier), an 

environmental law (Loi No 96-766, Code de l'Environnement), and a water law (Loi No 98-

755, Code de l'Eau).  Several decrees have been adopted related to these laws. 

The mining law No 95-553 dated July 17, 1995 contains a chapter (Articles 76 to 79) on the 

protection of the environment.  Article 77 obliges the titular of a mine to carry out a complete 

Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and an Environmental Management Program which 

includes a rehabilitation plan and remediation costs before any exploitation.  The obligation of 

keeping a rehabilitation fund is also prescribed by the article 85.  The decree No 96-634 dated 

August 9, 1996 determines the modes of enforcement of the mining law. 

The decree No 98-43 dated January 28, 1998 related to the classified installations having a 

concern with the environmental protection, fixes the nomenclature of these installations.  The 

Decree No D-03 dated January 6, 2005 is related to the procedure of the environmental audit.   

The water law No 98-755 dated December 23, 1998 is related to the management of the 

water resources and the protection against the contamination of the water sources.  The 

article 49 indicated that any rejects of wastewaters in the receiving medium must respect the 

standards.  Decree No. 01164 fixes the environmental discharge criteria (water, air quality, 

noise). 

20.7 Environmental Reports 

An Environmental Impact Study (EIS) for the Mount Ity Mine has been carried out in 2000 by 

SMI.  This study has been used as a reference in the rehabilitation report titled 

"Réaménagement du Site Minier d'Ity" (SMI, 2005).  According to Amireault (2006), the 

Ministry of the Environment conducted an environmental audit of the Mount Ity Mine at the 

end of December 2005.  The report is not available for review. 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 223 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

An environmental management plan (Plan de Management Environnemental) dated March 

2000 and a rehabilitation plan (Réaménagement du Site Minier d'Ity) dated June 2005 were 

elaborated to oversee the operations (Geostat, 2008).   

The environmental management plan described the management of the waste rocks, water 

(underground, surface water, streaming and processes water), fuels, chemical products, 

wastes, noise and dust.  The management of the leaching pads and the cyanide solution 

ponds are well protected with impermeable membranes and systems which permit to detect 

any leakage into the ground.  The wastewater rejected into the environment passes by a 

cyanide destruction pound where the cyanide is destroyed with sodium hypochlorite while the 

pH is adjusted.  Suspended particles are allowed to settle in a settling reservoir.  Chemical 

analyses of cyanide and pH determination are made on every step of the process.  In order to 

control the underground water, weekly sampling is carried out in two monitoring wells of the 

Ity village, from water springs located around the site, in the Cavally river and two other 

monitoring wells used by the mine.  The rainy periods represent a preoccupation for overflow 

of the pond and also for the runoff water on the site.  Precautions have been taking to avoid 

the overflowing of the ponds.  According to environmental management plan, fuels and 

chemical products are well stored and managed.  Noises are reduced by a sound attenuation 

wall.  Heaps are damp by the natural humidity of the ore and by the leaching process. 

Wastes are incinerated and buried into the waste rock dumps.  These wastes include the 

empty sodium cyanide drums, the used PVC piping, the domestic wastes from the mine staff, 

the plastic and metallic packaging from the laboratory, a few tons per year of metal scrap, the 

solids from the water and oil decanting device and some other waste from the laboratory.  

Standard procedures is to separate the waste from the sterile rocks in order to avoid the 

lixiviation of the waste into the waste rock dumps.  Normally, waste is stored in an 

appropriated site as a sanitary landfill constructed with an impermeable layer of clay, thus 

complying with the Côte d'Ivoire legislation. 

The environmental management plan describes that the empty sodium cyanide drums be 

washed with clear water on the platform of supply reagent in order to eliminate any trace of 

the solid sodium cyanide.  The wash water is drained into the cyanide water pond. 

The environmental management plan reveals that the water coming from the dewatering of 

the pit is used as drinking water and that one of the dewatering well supplies the Ity village 

fresh water.   

The solution ponds are protected by a fence and the site is under a 24 hour supervision 

preventing animals from drinking in the cyanide water ponds.   

The rehabilitation plan (Réaménagement du Site Minier d'Ity) details reclamation procedures, 

including preliminary cost estimates and rehabilitating the mine site at the end of the mine life 

(approximately US$ 120,000/year).  The report was written in 2008 for the period covering 

2005 to 2014.  The rehabilitation plan explains how the solution ponds will be finally treated 



Coffey Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 224 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

before the evacuation of the water into the environment; the waste rock dumps and the heaps 

will be reshaped and reforested; the infrastructures will be dismantled, sold, or buried.  The 

rehabilitation program does not include a monitoring program after the closure of the site.   

The rehabilitation plan was updated in 2011 in compliance with the mining code (Law No. 95-

553) and Decree No. 96-600) that states that the plan should be reviewed every 3 years 

(AGTS, 2011).  The dismantling of the mine infrastructure and the rehabilitating program 

(duration not indicated) is estimated at approximately US$ 6.9 Million. 

The elements of the mine closure (remediation, reclamation), the rehabilitation of the section 

of the Cavally River that will be dried, including the associated costs, are addressed in the 

DFS being prepared. 

20.8 Environmental Compliance 

SMI mandated an external firm to conduct an audit of the heap-leach operations (Roche, 

2013). 

Most of the recommendations were related to the improvement process (regeneration, coal 

oven, cyanide dosage, hopper capacity, reduction of the elution cycle, etc.) and health and 

safety practices.  The audit did review neither the environmental management plan nor the 

implementation of the rehabilitating program. 

In accordance with the Environmental Code and Decree No. 98-43 (1998) on environmental 

classified installations, the Ivorian Antipollution Center (Ministry of Environment) conducts 

every three months inspections at the mine siteThe following elements are audited: 

 Soil contamination; 

 Air pollution; 

 Water quality; 

 Water management; 

 Noise. 

Preventative and Corrective Actions taken following an audit ensure that non-compliances 

identified will be audited at the next inspection.

target accuracy of ±30%.  The data used to prepare the mining related operating cost 

estimate are based on a 2Mtpa mining schedule performed with the new geological block 

models received in June 2015.  This mining schedule was based on a mining plan that 

excludes Inferred Mineral Resource.    

21.2.1 Capital Costs (CAPEX) 

The estimate has been developed using quoted currencies and converted to Euros using the 

exchange rate.  The installation labour workweek is based on a sixty hour per week work 

schedule (6 days x 10 hours).  The labour anticipated rotation included in PFS estimate is 42 

working days (6 weeks) followed by 14 days off (2 weeks).  Travelling time will be taken on 

days off.  The construction labour costs are based on sixty-hours per workweek schedule; 6 

days 10 hours/day. For the Expatriates, 40 hours per week will be paid at straight time (1.0),

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

10 hours at time and a half (1½) and the remaining 10 hours at double time (2.0).  The rates 

are based on the project rotation of 42 days in followed by 14 days off.  For the local workers, 

a flat rate is presently assumed for the whole 60 hours per week without overtime premium.  

Except for civil and concrete work, skilled workforce will mainly be expatriates.  This 

proportion could be improved during the next phase by assessing the capacity in Côte d'Ivoire 

of skilled workforce in the mining industry.  The construction hours are based on SLI's 

historical data & experience adjusted for the complexity of specific elements of scope.  

Material and equipment to site are projected to be transported by the government road from 

Abidjan's Portual Terminal.  

The aggregates required for the concrete will be imported from a source to be determined 

during the definitive feasibility study, but is presently assumed to be as far as the region of 

Yamoussoukro.  The concrete unit price includes the transportation of the aggregates. 

The material take-offs were provided by engineering after reviewing all MTO considering a 

throughput increase of 2Mtpa. An allowance of 5.0% of direct costs has been included to 

cover construction indirect.  The construction camp has been excluded and is presently 

considered as part of owner's costs.  An allowance of 7% of the equipment purchase value is 

included under freight item.  The assistance during construction and pre-commissioning are 

included.  The commissioning spare parts have been evaluated based on an allowance of 

0.5% of the Permanent Equipment value.  An allowance is included to cover the Firsts Fills.  

The fuel is excluded from this allowance. 

The contingency has been calculated to both direct and indirect costs excluding Owner's 

costs, Escalation and Risk.  Contingency has been evaluated using a deterministic approach, 

which is the SLI's standard method for contingency evaluation for this stage of project. 

The CAPEX summary breakdown is given in Table 21.2.1_1:

21.2.2 Operating Costs (OPEX) 

The data used to prepare the operating cost estimate are based on the June 2015 geological 

block model and associated mining schedule.  This mining schedule was based on a mining 

plan that excludes Inferred Mineral Resources. The target accuracy of this OPEX estimate 

update is ±30%. 

Mining Related Operating Expenditure 

The mine operation cost was calculated based on the tonnage of each type of material from 

the different pits and the specific pit location.  Using these parameters, the cycle times were 

calculated based on SMI production factors and hauling distances for each pit.  Finally, an 

operating cost per type of material was calculated based on the labour cost, fuel consumption, 

maintenance cost, etc.  

The mining costs used in the PFS update are presented in Table 21.2.2_1.

Processing Plant Related Operating Expenditure 

The processing cost per material type was evaluated in laboratory tested on samples taken 

from the site.  These samples were subjected to various tests to simulate reagent dosing, 

wear factors and other parameters.  The combination of all these results was used to 

calculate the processing cost per material type.  It is important to mention that metallurgical 

testing results used in this PFS update are not including the recent laboratory testing results 

performed in 2015. 

The processing costs in the PFS are estimated to be USD 13.67/t (12.43 €/t) on average over 

the life of the CIL project. 

The building maintenance and administrative supplies have been calculated based on 

building CAPEX value and factored plant labour cost.  The labour cost has been estimated 

based on a plant general crew by function and salary. 

Site G&A costs, estimated at USD 9.7/a (8.8m €/a), were provided by SMI. 

Power Related Operating Expenditure 

The power requirement for the plant has been evaluated at approximately 10.819MW.  The 

PFS study initially evaluated a diesel powered power station at the site with a power cost of 

0.19 €/kWh.  A study to connect the site to the main electrical grid was conducted, by a third 

party, and is being considered to supply electrical power for the processing plant.  In addition, 

the biggest impact is the cost of power which is approximately 0.10 €/kWh from the main grid.  

The Site General & Administrative fees were provided by SMI. 

Table 21.2.2_2 below presents the operating cost summary for each year.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

An economic analysis has been conducted using a cash flow model prepared on the basis and 

assumptions as stated in the following discussion.  The results of the economic analysis 

represent forward-looking information (production rates, cash flows, net present value, etc.) that 

are subject to a number of unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual 

results to differ materially from those presented here.  The analysis shown below does not include 

financing issues and is presented on an unleveraged free cash flow basis.  All amounts are 

presented on a 100% basis unless stated otherwise.  All amounts are for the period ended July 

2015 unless otherwise stated.  

22.1 Gold price and Exchange rates 

While various gold price scenarios were run, the central case has been run using a flat gold price 

of US$1,150/oz (€1,045/oz), net of €5/oz bullion transport, insurance and refining costs.  A flat 

USD/euro exchange rate of 1.10 has been assumed.  No hedging has been assumed within the 

analysis.  Gold payable has been assumed to be 100% of the gold produced.  

22.2 Royalties and taxes 

Royalties applicable are described in Section 4.4. 

A corporate tax rate of 25% has been applied on both the Heap Leach and CIL operations.  While 

there may be a possibility to obtain a 5-year tax holiday on all or some of the deposits mined 

during the CIL phase, applicable to new projects under the Ivorian mining code, this optimization 

exercise has not been included in the presented financial analysis.   

22.3 Inflation 

In line with mineral industry practices, no inflation was applied to the cash flow analysis on both 

the Heap Leach and CIL operations.  

22.4 Operating and Capital Costs 

G&A costs integrated into the Heap Leach and CIL operations are based on currently achieved 

costs.  Starting from year 2029 once mining operations cease and the CIL mill is only 

reprocessing tailings, G&A costs have been reduced from 8.8m€/year to 6.0m€/year, No operator 

management fees have been included in the model.  No exploration costs have been included in 

the model.  

Operating and Capital mining and processing costs modelled are as described in Section 21

Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

22.5 Sustaining Capital 

22.5.1 Heap Leach Operation 

Roughly €16.6m of sustaining capital has been included in the Heap Leach operation, inclusive of 

€7.3m for fleet replacement.  

22.5.2 CIL Operation 

The sustaining capital was estimated on an annual basis accounting for equipment maintenance, 

infrastructures to access new deposits, TSF upgrades, and replacements necessary to maintain 

the mining process and treatment.  The sustaining is estimated to be €41 million over the life of 

the project.  

22.6 Working capital 

22.6.1 Heap Leach Operation 

No working capital is assumed to be recovered at the end of the Heap Leach operation.  

22.6.2 CIL Operation 

A working capital assumption, totalling 2 months of reagents, has been applied to the model for 

the CIL project. 

22.7 Depreciation 

22.7.1 Heap Leach Operation 

Depreciation schedule has been estimated by allocating investments on a per ounce basis to 

deposits mined over the remaining Heap Leach life of mine. 

22.7.2 CIL Operation 

Depreciation for the mill has been modelled using the straight-line method over the life of the 

project.  Depreciation for the mining capex has been allocated of the tonnage moved across the 

life of mine.  Book values of existing assets have been excluded from the depreciation schedule. 

22.8 Closure Costs and Salvage Value 

The costs for the mine and mill shut-down process and salvage value of the assets have not been 

included in the model.

22.9 Production Profile and Cash Flow Analysis 

22.9.1 Heap Leach Operation 

While the Heap Leach operation can extend beyond 2017 based on mineral reserves, the Heap 

Leach business plan has been limited to end of 2017 as the CIL project is expected to start at the 

beginning of 2018.  The Heap Leach and CIL operations are not assumed to run in parallel.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Data - Historical work has been of variable quality.  The work undertaken in the last three 

years is to international standards.  Current exploration practices are appropriate to the 

deposits being evaluated.  SMI has assessed all historical data for accuracy and incorporated 

this data into the database where it was found acceptable for use in geological and mineral 

resource evaluations. 

Procedures in the exploration programmes are continually monitored and reviewed.  

Procedures are described in detail.  Documentation has been updated in 2014/2015 have 

been updated to include reporting lines and new formats required by the Acquire database.  

Core storage facilities have been substantially reorganized and catalogued since the first site 

visit. 

Drilling - Drilling is as complete as it can be on the current deposits.  Some infill drilling may 

be needed at ZiaNE and Mont Ity as mining progresses.  This would be to fill gaps in the 

deeper portions.  Otherwise drilling can be left for the grade control programme. 

Additional drilling is needed at Daapleu to close gaps in the drilling grid.  The Cavally River 

currently prevents drilling these areas.  The infill drilling will need to be done once the river 

diversion is in place.  Additional drilling for deeper resources is indicated for future work. 

Mineral Resources - The geological models and mineral resources for Daapleu and ZiaNE 

are the first models constructed for these deposits.  Geological models constructed in 2014 

have been confirmed as accurate by additional drilling in 2015.  The geological model for 

Mont Ity was substantially revised by site geologist in 2015.  Additional drilling has been 

undertaken for Aires to allow modelling of the slopes of the leach pad. 

Mineralization appears to be well mapped on the dumps, at Daapleu and at ZiaNE.  This had 

been confirmed by recent drilling.  Mont Ity geology was substantially revised in 2015 and 

there are still some uncertainties in the Au distributions.  This is reflected in the classification 

of the mineral resources. 

Walter and Gbeitouo, being drilled and estimated in 2013, rely for a part on historical 

boreholes.  The improvement of drilling and data verification procedures in 2013 together with 

the intense in-fill drilling, significantly improved the confidence in the geological model and the 

grade continuity.  The classification reflects the weaknesses outlined by the historical 

practices. 

Metallurgy - The quality and quantity of metallurgical testwork performed for the 2Mtpa CIL is 

considered adequate for the PFS level developed for the project. 

The ore facies not containing sulphide are substantially free-milling and do not show any 

preg-robbing characteristics. 



 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 241 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The ore facies containing sulphide is partially refractory and direct cyanidation (CIL process) 

yields to lower gold recovery.  

The additional test work is to include additional variability samples and is to concentrate upon 

the ore to be delivered during the first five years of the project. 

Mineral Reserves - The decision not to divert the Cavally River next to the Walter pit results 

in a reduction in mineral reserves from the Walter pit.  However, the cost savings from the 

river diversion greatly outweighs the loss of revenue from reducing the Walter mineral 

reserve.   

High strip ratios in the Ity pit are a result of the large pushback of the north-west wall.  

Although still economic to mine, there is a small amount of mineral reserve recovered from 

this pushback, with most of the mineral reserves coming from the Ity Flat area.  In future 

studies it may be worth abandoning this pushback to lower the overall strip ratio of the Ity pit.  

The resulting loss of mineral reserve would not have a significant impact. 

Tailings Storage Facility - Few options were considered for the tailings disposal based on 

some important assumptions during the PFS.  The quantities for the tailing storage facility 

have been updated based on the 2Mtpa production scenario.  Some important assumptions 

will need to be validated early in the next phase regarding the chosen option.  

Geotechnical - A preliminary geotechnical work was carried out during the PFS based on 

limited data especially for Daapleu and Gbeitouo pits located east of Cavally River.  

Significant assumptions were also made for Zia NE pit.  Pit slopes recommendations provided 

herein are based on these assumptions.  

Hydrogeology - The preliminary assessment of the hydrogeological conditions was solely 

based on existing report prepared for current pits operating west of the river as well as review 

of geological setting of the site.  Based on the assessment, it was assumed that a dewatering 

of the pits will be possible via wells and sumps as per current practice at the operating pits.   

Geochemistry - No geochemical assessment was performed during the PFS.  Daapleu and 

Gbeitouo have important quantities of sulphide ore that could potentially be acid generating.  

This could have an important impact on water management and could lead to the addition of a 

water treatment plant in the project scope of work.  

In addition, all aggregate material, with the exception of the concrete aggregates, will come 

from the granodiorite facies of Ity Mine or other proposed pits.  This represents an important 

assumption that needs to be validated with geochemistry tests during the DFS. 

Environmental - The current facilities are operated within the applicable environmental legal 

framework in the Côte d'Ivoire.  These facilities are also subject to a formal inspection every 

three months by the Environmental Code and the Ivorian Antipollution Center. 



 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 242 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

The new CIL operations and projected infrastructures are subject to a formal SEIA approval 

process; the SEIA for the construction of the CIL plant was approved by the Ivorian authorities 

(December 2013).  The SEIA for the operation of the Gbeitouo and Daapleu is completed, 

and is pending approval. Finally, the SEIA for the projected infrastructures (diversion canal, 

roads, dykes) is under way.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Exploration, Geology and Mineral Resources -  At the Effective Date of the report, Coffey 

is preparing the mineral resource estimation of the Ity Flat deposit on the property and expect 

the final figures to be completed within two months of the effective date. This deposit contains 

both oxidized material similar to current Heap Leach material and fresh material that could be 

considered for CIL.  Recommendations for any additional work on this deposit will be made in 

the final report. 

Some additional drilling is recommended on Verse Ouest to evaluate the undrilled portion of 

the dump to provide material for the Heap Leach operations.  There are some changes that 

need to be made to the quality control programme and the data management systems still 

needs some improvement.  SMI is aware of these needs and will be making the changes as 

part of the normal exploration activities. 

Several additional targets at different stages of exploration (i.e. Verse Ouest and others) have 

been identified in the very close vicinity of present Ity facilities, on both the Exploitation Permit 

and Exploration Permit, which comprise the Ity Project.  The company considers that 

additional resources could be defined and potentially provide additional feed for the Heap 

Leach operation to extend its life by 2 to 3 years and also to increase the CIL project mineral 

resources and mineral reserves base.  

A follow-up exploration program aiming at achieving this target and consisting of 

approximately 25,000m of drilling (80% diamond/ 20% RC drilling) has therefore been 

proposed for the Ity Project.  This program is designed to maximize the opportunity to expand 

the potential of known deposits and for discovery of new zones of gold mineralization for the 

minimum exploration expenditures in the shortest time frame.  The total exploration budget to 

complete most of the required work is estimated to be roughly USD 5.5M.  This program is 

scheduled to begin in Q4 2015 and to be completed within 9 to 12 months 

Metallurgy - Heap Leach - a Site visit and review if the Heap Leach operations was 

scheduled for 14-17 September 2015.  Recommendations for any improvement of the current 

operations will be addressed in the site visit report to be completed at the end of September 

2015. 

Metallurgy CIL - The mining plan shows that, while most of the planned plant feed was 

tested, some geological facies have not been tested during the PFS stage.  These facies 

should be tested to confirm the adequacy of the currently developed process.  

Additional mineralogical and metallurgical test work is also required to firm up the process 

flowsheet that has been developed.  The additional test work will allow determination of 

optimum operating parameters (final grind, reagent consumption, etc.) in order to minimize 

CAPEX and OPEX.  



 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 244 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Additional rheology and settling testwork is also recommended for equipment selection sizing 

and design, as there are wide variability characteristics in the various facies  

The increase in mineral resources of the sulphide facies (particularly in the Daapleu deposit) 

may warrant to investigation of the pressure oxidation process (POX) for these sulphidic 

facies.  Pressure oxidation followed by POX product cyanidation along with the flotation 

tailings stream, are very likely to produce higher gold recovery than the direct cyanidation of 

the ore.  However the additional CAPEX and OPEX need to be investigated and evaluated to 

demonstrate the economics. 

Mineral Reserves -  It is recommended, at the next stage of technical reporting, that a more 

detailed scheduling exercise be undertaken to determine the optimal scenario for feeding ore 

from the various pits and stockpiles to the mill, particularly with the different types of ore 

coming from the pits (hard vs. soft vs. sulphides).  This should be done using mine scheduling 

software such as Minesight MSSO or Geovia Minesched.  

A more detailed pit phasing plan for Zia and Daapleu should also be carried out in future 

studies of the project as these pits have the potential to bring higher grade material to the mill 

earlier in the production schedule, especially Daapleu. 

Tailing Storage Facility - At next phase of the work, an optimization of the TSF in terms of 

location, dam alignment and footprint will need to be carried out.  The validation and the 

design of TSF should consider key issues such as geotechnical investigation, construction 

material sourcing, construction staging, stability, settlement, spillway and liner design.  

Water Management - During the next phase of the study, significant work will be required to 

optimize the design diversion of Cavally River and minimize the environmental and social 

impacts.  The work foreseen includes:  

 Optimization of the diversion alignment  

 Hydrology and Hydraulic studies of the diversion 

 Geotechnical design of the diversion channel and related bridge 

 Assessment of impact of diversion on current river flow system and flooding pattern 

Geotechnical - During the next phase, the following should be carried out: 

 A geotechnical investigation program for all proposed pits to obtain the geotechnical 
information required for the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) level open pit slope 
design. This will include drilling inclined holes with core orientation at selected locations 
especially for pits located at east of Cavally River. The design of pit slopes based on 
the findings of the above investigation program should be re-assessed.  

 A geotechnical field investigation for all infrastructure including TSF, process plant, 
Cavally River diversion, perimeter protection dykes, bridge, access roads, waste rock 
dumps, etc. 



 

SMI Gold Projects, Côte d'Ivoire – JSMI02 Page 245 
Technical Report for the Ity Gold Mine, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa  

Hydrogeology - Considering the proximity of the Cavally River from certain deposits, it is 

strongly recommended to perform water pumping test to better define the dewatering 

requirement and the risk associated with hydrogeology.  An extensive site-wide 

hydrogeological investigation program including pumping test at selected locations to collect 

groundwater data required for the design of an effective pit dewatering program for each pit 

should be carried out. 

Geochemistry - During the DFS, a geochemical characterization of the waste rock, tailings 

and potential aggregate material should be carried out.  This will confirm is the material are 

acid generating or not and provide the basis for the design of various facilities required for 

management of such material. 

Environmental - Considering that three different SEIAs were carried out for the expansion 

project (CIL operations), we recommend that the results (cumulative impacts) pertaining to the 

integrated SEIA be presented to interested parties (mainly local communities).
