1.0 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Aurcana Corporation (Aurcana) owns a controlling interest in Minera La Negra, S.A de C.V. (MLN), a 

Mexican Corporation that owns and operates the La Negra silver-copper-lead-zinc mine. Aurcana 

retained Behre Dolbear & Company (USA), Inc. (Behre Dolbear) to estimate mineral resources at Mina 

La Negra and prepare a Technical Report in compliance with Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101 

Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects. This estimate and report are by Baltazar Solano-Rico Geol. 

Eng. and Betty Gibbs, E.M., both qualified persons in accordance with NI 43-101. 

 

Aurcana Corp. through Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. is concessionaire of 9 Titled Mining Concessions 

covering a total of 4,285.5032 hectares. According to MLN and the information revised by the authors, all 

claims are in force and free of any liens and encumbrances. 

 

The La Negra Mine is located in the Maconí Mining District, in the State of Querétaro, México, 

96 kilometers (km) east-northeast of the State Capital, Querétaro City and approximately 161 km north-

northwest of México City. Coordinates of the location monument of the La Negra mining claim near the 

center of the known mineralized area, is at 20° 50.1'N latitude and 99° 30.9'W longitude (UTM 14Q 

2,303,948 m North – 426,443 m East). The property is in the Sierra Gorda, a rugged terrain within the 

Sierra Madre Oriental, with elevations ranging from 1,900 meters above mean sea level (masl) and 

2,700 masl. 

 

Access from Queretaro, State Capital, is by a system of paved highways and secondary roads to Maconí, a 

road distance of 173 km for a drive of approximately 2 hours. From the town of Maconí, there is a 4 km-

long gravel road to the plant and office facilities. Aurcana Corp. through Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. 

is the owner of 10 Mining Concessions covering a total of 4,285.5032 hectares. 

 

Aurcana Corp. acquired rights to La Negra, in 2006, from Industrias Peñoles, S.A.B. de C.V. (Peñoles) 

for roughly CAN$6 million, with CAN$3.0 million paid in cash in May 2006 with up to CAN$3 million 

in work commitments to get the mine in operation. According to Aurcana information, the property is 

subject to a 2.8% Net Smelter Royalty payable on all concentrates (Cu, Pb, Zn) produced by the La Negra 

operation. No back-in rights, or other agreements and encumbrances are known to exist. Original 

commitments included the refurbishment of the original Peñoles 800 tonnes per day (tpd) mill and 

upgrade to 1,000 tpd capacity. By June 2010, it had been expanded to 1,500 tpd and by April 2012 to 

2,000 tpd. 

 

Important project-related infrastructure includes a flotation process plant that currently operates at a rate 

of 2,000 tpd for the production of lead, zinc, and copper concentrates; and 5 tailings dams, of which 

1 tailing dam is currently operating. Water is obtained from sources underground in the mine and recycled 

from the tailings dam facilities. Electrical power is obtained from CFE's national grid from the Vizarrón 

sub-station through a 34 kilovolt (kV) line to the mine facilities. 

 

La Negra is located near the southwestern edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental Mesozoic Foldbelt of Central 

Mexico within the Cretaceous El Doctor Formation, carbonate unit deposited on a submarine platform 

environment. Eocene calcalkaline intrusive rocks intrude the El Doctor Formation and are central to 

polymetallic skarn mineralization deposit types, such as at La Negra. 

 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 2 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

Mineralization occurs preferentially near the external edge of a contact zone of metasomatic alteration 

along a northeast-trending, suite of intrusive dikes and stocks of diorite composition within medium to 

thick-bedded limestone of the El Doctor Formation. Two northwest trends of intrusive dikes, stocks, and 

mineralization have been identified and designated the Maravillas-Bicentenario and San Pedro-Dificultad-

Virginia Blanca trends. 

 

Silver and base metal mineralization at La Negra is closely associated with skarn deposits in a number of 

manto, chimney, vein, and breccia deposits. Mineralization at La Negra may be massive to disseminated 

in nature and locally complexly folded and irregular. Sulphide minerals of economic interest include 

galena, sphalerite (the iron-rich variety known as marmatite), chalcopyrite, and at least one silver-carrying 

mineral, hessite (silver-tellurium sulphosalt mineral). Accessory minerals include andradite – grossularite 

garnet, hedenbergite, calcite, and quartz, with varying amounts of pyrite and pyrrothite. There seems to be 

a close association between galena and the hessite, such that silver values report to the lead concentrates. 

 

More than 20 different deposits have been discovered at La Negra, some of the deposits coalesce to form 

individual bodies. Mantoes and chimneys have comprised the bulk of silver, lead, zinc, and copper 

mineralization. The deposits include some chimneys that replace beds of La Negra limestone facies. 

These mantoes vary in size and range from 40 meters to 300 meters length and from 0.50 meters to 

40 meters thick. Vein deposits vary from 80 meters to 120 meters length, between 10 meters to 60 meters 

depth, and width from 0.50 meters to 1.20 meters. 

 

Surface and underground exploration at La Negra is ongoing. As a result of the continued and increasing 

exploration programs, Minera La Negra has been able to replace annual production and increase 

"Reserves" by a total of 2.7 million tonnes (Mt), between 2007 and 2012. 

 

Currently, MLN operates a conventional milling and flotation plant capable of operating at 2,200 tpd, 

producing zinc, lead, and copper concentrates (Reference MLN, 2012). MLN also operates its own 

laboratory with well-equipped assay and metallurgical research facilities. The La Negra deposits contain 

four primary metals with economic value. Silver is the key metal although the other metals contribute 

substantially. From January to May 2012, approximately 244,000 tonnes were milled and produced 

1,525 tonnes of lead concentrate, 6,259 tonnes of zinc concentrate, and 3,316 tonnes of copper 

concentrate. Average recoveries for the 5-month period were 84.86% and 81.0% of silver and lead in lead 

concentrates, respectively; 74.62% of zinc in zinc concentrates; and 70.66% of copper in copper 

concentrates. These results are considered representative of production at this time. 

 

The mineral resource tonnages and grades were estimated by generating 3-dimensional block models for 

each deposit. 

 

To consider the contained minerals as a single economic unit, a recovered block value is calculated based 

on the modeled grade estimates using the metal prices and recoveries shown in Table 1.1.

Mining at La Negra is conducted using long hole, open stope mining and room and pillar mining, 

depending on the morphology, width, and attitude of the mineralization being mined. The mining 

operations build upon basic mine infrastructure that has been developed through the more than 40 years of 

history at La Negra. Key features are: 

 

 Four main levels (2100; 2200; 2300; 2400) 

 2000 haulage level 

 Two main service shafts (La Negra and El Alacrán) 

 Two ramp systems, at surface and underground 

 Two main draw shafts to the 2000 level 

 Ventilation shafts 
 

Copper, lead, silver, and zinc concentrates produced by MLN are sold under separate contracts. 

 

The authors suggest that the exploration potential at MLN is good. Exploration at La Negra, previously 

by Peñoles and currently by Aurcana, has replaced and increased the mineralized resources. 

 

The geological exploration model, described in the text, suggests that Carrizal (Zimapán)-type 

mineralization could be present below the current level of development at La Negra. On the other hand, 

the vertical span of mineralization at La Negra is close to 500 meters. Some of the major skarn districts in 

Mexico, such as Naica and Concepción del Oro, can reach depths to as much as 900 meters. It is 

concluded that La Negra shows an important exploration potential at depth. 

 

Exploration and development of deposits of this type require extensive direct exploration by means of 

core drilling, cross cutting, drifting, and development workings. 

 

It is the authors' opinion that an aggressive exploration program is required to continue to keep ahead of 

production.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 

This report relies heavily on the information produced and provided by Aurcana Corp. and Minera La 

Negra, S.A de C.V. (MLN) in the form of databases and numerous internal reports, PowerPoint® 

presentations, maps and cross sections. Several reports from consultants to MLN were also provided; 

however, only limited information was found to be of interest from one of the main sources of 

information, Peñoles, the previous operator of the mine. 

 

The authors have exercised all due care in reviewing the supplied information and believes that the basic 

assumptions are factual and correct and the interpretations are reasonable.  

 

In regard to the legal title of the mining concessions, the authors were provided with copies of the titles of 

concession of La Negra, La Yegua, Mariana, El Negro, El Patriarca, Diana, Ligia, Macon, and Tichi and 

copies of the assessment work maps for the Aurcana I, Aurcana II, Aurcana III, and El Sol mining 

concession applications, recently staked in the State of Querétaro. The authors were also given copy of a 

letter/certificate of the Mines Public Registry (copy attached in Appendix 1.0) stating La Negra's mining 

claims validity, tax payments, annual workings report submittal, annual production report submittal, and 

claim applications pending to be titled, as of October 3, 2011. According to Mexican Mining Legislation, 

this is the only document that certifies the validity of the claims. 

 

According to discussions with MLN and the information reviewed by the authors, all claims are in force 

and free of any liens and encumbrances. While the authors believe the information provided by MLN to 

be correct, they are not qualified to express legal opinion with respect to the property titles, current 

ownership and possible encumbrance status, and therefore, disclaims direct responsibility for such titles 

and status data.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

The Maconí Mining District, in the State of Querétaro, México, is characterized by a cluster of 

polymetallic deposits (Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu) in limestone replacement, manto and chimney ore bodies. Aurcana 

Corp. (Aurcana), through its fully owned subsidiary in México, Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. (MLN) 

holds the concession rights of the La Negra Mine. 

 

The mine was discovered and operated by MLN, then part of the Peñoles Industries Group between 1970 

and 2000, when the mine was put under care and maintenance due to low metal prices. It has been 

reported that approximately 6.6 million tonnes (Mt) with an average grade of 169 grams per tonne (g/t) 

Ag, 1.10% Pb, 2.20% Zn, 0.48% Cu were mined through this period (Reyna Mining, 2006). It has also 

been reported that at the time of the acquisition, the La Negra Mine had a Proven and Probable Reserve of 

1.2 Mt grading 159 g/t Ag, 0.899% Pb, 2.838% Zn, and 0.939% Cu which is an historic estimate and it 

does not meet the current criteria set under NI 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Properties. 

 

Aurcana Corp. through Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. is concessionaire of 10 Titled Mining Concessions 

covering a total of 4,379.8464 hectares in the main subject area. 

 

Currently, Aurcana has the necessary infrastructure and is operating the mine at a rate of 2,000 tonnes per 

day (tpd) after acquiring the property from Peñoles and implementing a series of expansions from the 

original capacity of 800 tpd. 

 

4.1 PROPERTY LOCATION 
 

La Negra Mine is located near Maconí, Cadereyta Municipality, in the Northeastern part of the State of 

Querétaro at 96 kilometers (km) east-northeast of the State Capital, Querétaro City and approximately 

161 km north-northwest of México City, within the Maconí Mining District and near the border between 

the states of Querétaro and Hidalgo. Coordinates of the location monument of the La Negra mining claim 

near the center of the known mineralized area, are at approximately 20° 50.1'N latitude, 99° 30.9'W 

longitude (UTM 14Q 2,303,948 mN – 426,443 mE) between elevations 1,900 mean above sea level 

(masl) and 2,400 masl in the slopes of the Sierra Gorda on a very steep topography and rugged terrain 

where 30° slopes are common. 

 

The main access to the mine area is from Querétaro City through the Querétaro – México City Highway 

57D to San Juan del Río and passing through Tequisquiapan – Cadereyta – Vizarrón and taking a detour 

east toward San Joaquín to the paved road to Maconí, for a total of 173 km, an approximate 2 hour drive. 

From the mine camp at Maconí, there is a gravel road, which is approximately 4 km to the plant and 

office facilities. Figure 4.1 shows the property location.

4.2 MINERAL TENURE 
 

In 2005, La Negra mine and facilities were optioned by Reyna Mining S.A. de C.V. (Reyna) through a 

Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire 100% from Industrias Peñoles, S.A. de C.V. (Peñoles). The options were 

later transferred to Aurcana Corp. Aurcana and Reyna signed a LOI under which a joint venture would be 

formed whereby Aurcana would own 80% interest in La Negra and Reyna the remaining 20%. The 

purchase from Peñoles included the property, mine, mill, mine camp, infrastructure, permits, and 

equipment. 

 

In 2006, Aurcana purchased La Negra from Peñoles for roughly CAN$6 million, with CAN$3.0 million 

paid in cash in May 2006 with up to CAN$3 million in work commitments to get the mine in operation. 

Plans called for Reyna Mining and Engineering S.A. de C.V. to refurbish the 800 tpd mill and upgrade it 

to 1,000 tpd capacity. Concurrently, Reyna would put La Negra's mine infrastructure in good working 

order (Gold Newsletter, September 2006, Aurcana Corp.). During this period, concessions granted almost 

doubled the area controlled by MLN. 

 

In 2007, amendments to the original purchase agreement with Peñoles were made to pay the remaining 

and final payment to Peñoles totaling US$1.0 million by the issuance of 1,114,631 common shares of the 

Company. 

 

In August 2009, Aurcana increased its interest ownership of La Negra mine from the original 80% to 92% 

and from 92% to 99.86% in February 2012. As a result of a capital restructure of Real de Maconi S.A. de 

C.V., Real de Maconi holds 99.99% interest (one share representing a 0.00002% interest held by a third 

party) in Minera La Negra S.A. de C.V., which has a 100% interest in the La Negra mine. 

 

According to Aurcana information, the property is subject to a 2.8% NSR royalty levied on all 

concentrates (Cu, Pb, Zn) produced by the La Negra operation. No back-in rights or other agreements and 

encumbrances are known to exist. 

 

By June 2010, the expansion to 1,500 tpd was completed and by April 2012 La Negra mine completed its 

process plant expansion and is now milling at a rate of 2,000 tpd with plans for a further expansion to 

3,000 tpd by 2013 (Aurcana News Release, April 26, 2012). 

 

4.3 MINERAL CONCESSIONS 
 

Aurcana Corp. through Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. is concessionaire of 9 Titled Mining Concessions 

covering a total of 4,285.5032 hectares, as shown in white and blue in Figure 4.2. Mining claims depicted 

in green are held by others.

Most of these claims were originally staked by the Peñoles Group during their tenure, exploration, 

development, and mining of the property. Figure 4.3 shows a previous version of Figure 4.2 that depicts 

the location of the concessions related to the mine infrastructure, main ore bodies, the 2000 level main

More recently, Aurcana staked the Aurcana I, Aurcana II, Aurcana III, and El Sol claims, covering an 

extension of 103,170.5021 hectares to explore possible targets in the region. The present report makes 

reference to these areas, for information purposes, but these are not covered nor described in the text and 

are not part of the same mining concessions. Figure 4.4, Figure 4.5, and Figure 4.6 show the location of 

these claims.

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 23 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

The authors were informed that most concessions were originally granted to Minera La Negra, S.A. de 

C.V. or Minera Capela, S.A. de C.V., then part of the Peñoles Group and that all mine concessions are 

currently valid having complied with all their obligations including the submittal of annual assessment 

works and payment of mining rights (taxes) and that all related information and copies of documents are 

in their files and available, if necessary. It is noted the material is dated August 30, 2001 all rights and 

obligations of Minera Capela, S.A. de C.V., were transferred on behalf of Minera La Negra, S.A. de C.V. 

 

According to MLN and the information revised by the authors, all claims are in force and free of any liens 

and encumbrances. 

 

However, the authors are not qualified to express a legal opinion with respect to the property titles, 

current ownership and possible encumbrance status, and therefore, disclaims direct responsibility for such 

titles and status data. 

 

4.4 SURFACE RIGHTS 
 

The same document above shows that surface rights are granted by a Temporary Occupation Agreement 

signed with the Maconí Community, Municipality of Cadereyta, Qro., for as long as the concessions are 

valid, dated January 23, 1987. A second agreement signed with the Maconí Community, on the same 

date, grants MLN with Rights-of-Way through their surface properties for as long as the concessions are 

valid. 

 

4.5 ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERMITTING 
 

Section 20.0 of this report describes the current environmental and other permitting status at La Negra. 

Based on the information shown and provided by MLN to the authors, and considering that operations are 

continuous and normal, there is no reason to believe that major risks and/or possible disruptions on the 

production at La Negra, derived of permitting failures may occur. A close follow-up of all permits and 

on-going environmental monitoring is required to prevent any negative impacts on the operation.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE, 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 LOCATION AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

The Maconí mining district is located within the Sierra Madre Oriental Physiographic Province, in the 

central-northern part of the State of Querétaro forming northwest-southeast-trending elongated mountain 

ranges, basically formed of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks intruded by Lower Tertiary calc-alkaline igneous 

rocks. 

 

The district is characterized by a rugged, steep topography with common differences in elevation of more 

than 500 meters. The main physiographic units are the Southern Sierra Gorda de Querétaro, the Maconí 

Canyon, and the Tolimán Canyon, both subsidiaries of the Moctezuma River. Locally, the highest peak in 

the region is at approximately 2,700 masl, while the Maconí River is at 1,800 masl with a difference in 

elevation in the order of 900 meters. As a reference, the main haulage level of La Negra is at 2,000 masl. 

 

5.2 PROPERTY ACCESS AND LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The main access to the mine area is from Querétaro City through the Querétaro – México City Highway 

57D to San Juan del Río and passing through Tequisquiapan – Cadereyta – Vizarrón and taking a detour 

east toward San Joaquín to the paved road to Maconí, for a total of 173 km, an approximate 2 hour drive. 

From the mine camp at Maconí, there is a gravel road approximately 4 km to the plant and office 

facilities. 

 

In spite of its isolated location and rugged terrain, La Negra shows a good infrastructure that has been 

built through a period of 40 years by the state and federal governments, Peñoles and Minera La Negra 

(Aurcana), that includes paved road to Maconí, water availability at the mine and process plant site and 

electrical power. 

 

Local and public infrastructure: 

 

 San Joaquín is the largest town close to Maconí, at 21 km with better than elementary 
services. Local schooling is provided at Maconí through primary basic level while San 

Joaquín provides secondary and high school equivalent levels. For technical and higher 

level education, local people have to attend schools at Cadereyta, Ezequiel Montes, or 

Querétaro, State Capital. 

 

 Health services are provided locally by a first-level health center (SSA/IMSS); for 
higher-level services, local people have to be transferred to a regional health center and 

hospital or a local center at Cadereyta. 

 

 Other local municipal services include water and telephone. 
 

 Public transportation is limited to a private bus service from San Joaquín, (21 km from 
Maconí) to Querétaro and other localities. Transportation to San Joaquín has to be 

privately arranged. 

 

 With a long mining history including that of the neighboring San Joaquín, El Doctor, 
Vizarrón, and Zimapán Districts, however, the La Negra region is well endowed of

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 25 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

mining workers and technicians, including miners, electricians, mechanics, computer 

skilled technicians, etc. 

 

 Higher-level professionals are commonly hired in Querétaro, México City and other 
places in México. 

 

5.3 CLIMATE 
 

Climate in the area varies greatly with elevation. While the upper parts of the Sierra Gorda, above 

2,700 masl, have a temperate to cold climate as the La Negra area; below the 2,300 masl have a warmer 

to hot climate. Climates are classified as steppe (dry, semi-hot, with a dry winter) and an annual average 

temperature of 16.7°C and a maximum of 38°C. 

 

The closest operating weather station to La Negra is located at El Doctor (7 km to the northwest) indicates 

that the average rainfall for the period 1981 to 2010 is of 796.1 mm falling in about 91 days, mostly 

during the months of June through October. The maximum 24-hour rainfall, recorded during the same 

period, is 148.5 mm during the month of August (SMN-CNA, 2012). 

 

It is expected that the average rainfall at La Negra is lower due to its elevation and dry conditions 

(2,700 masl versus 2,000 masl to 2,300 masl). Under similar physiographic conditions, the now idle 

CNA's Zimapán weather station, located 10 km to the southeast at 2,075 masl, records an average 

445.9 mm of annual rainfall in the period 1971 to 2000 but a maximum 24-hour precipitation of 196 mm 

in the month of July. 

 

Mine operations at La Negra are not affected by climate phenomena considering that the access road to 

Maconí is paved and from Maconí to the mine area a gravel road that is firm and constantly maintained 

by the Company. Local rock falls affecting the road between Maconí and the San Joaquín Township may 

occur during the rainy season and temporary flooding of the Maconí River may disrupt access for a few 

hours. 

 

5.4 NATURAL RESOURCES AND VEGETATION 
 

Given the arid conditions of the La Negra area, due to the geographic barrier formed by the Sierra Gorda 

mountain range that collects most of the water coming from the Gulf of México, vegetation in the area is 

of desert to semi-desert nature. While the slopes of the La Negra Mountains are characterized by desert 

bush and cacti like lechuguilla, agave, palmilla, cholla, and varieties of opuntia, larger brush and trees 

include huizache, pirul, mezquite, sangregado, and palo dulce. The lower parts of the Maconí Canyon, 

with abundant year-round sources of water, produce a dense tropical vegetation that include casuarina, 

and some domesticated varieties like eucaliptus, jacaranda, bougainville, and fruit trees like fig, peach, 

lemon, pomegranate, orange, avocado, zapote, and chirimoya. 

 

The most important economic activities in the Maconí District are mining, cattle ranching, limited river 

bank agriculture, and fruit growing. In the neighboring Vizarrón area, marble production and art crafts are 

an important source of income, while tourism, minor logging, and limited mercury mining are part of the 

San Joaquín area economy, 10 km to the northwest. 

 

Land use information in the Cadereyta Municipality indicates that as of the year 2000, there was 

94,212 hectares in cattle-related activities, 9,770 hectares for agriculture, 5,725 hectares in forestry uses 

and 3,393 hectares for other uses.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

6.1 EARLY ACTIVITIES 
 

Archeological evidences of mining activities in the region date back to the 10
th
 and 13

th
 Centuries BC 

when cinnabar mining took place for ritual purposes by Otomí and Chichimeca Indians; later between the 

4
th
 and 7

th
 Centuries BC, silver, fluorite, and "green calcite" as well as opal in the 12

th
 Century BC were 

exploited. 

 

During the colonial period and according to a Cédula Real de 1557, several silver and lead deposits were 

discovered that led to the foundation of most of the relevant mining towns of the area, like San Pedro 

Escanela, El Doctor, San José de Amoles (Pinal de Amoles), Río Blanco, Plazuela, San Joaquín (1682), 

and Maconí. During the beginnings of 17
th
 Century, silver mineralization was discovered and several 

mines were operated by Spaniards in the Maconí region, with the foundation of the Real de Maconí in 

1682 and later administered by the Real de El Doctor in 1742, although mining was not very intensive 

during this period at the Maconí District. 

 

During the late 1800s and through early 1900s, the properties were owned, explored, and partially mined 

by the General Consul of Belgium in México, Sr. Víctor Beaurang; and later by Messrs. Oscar and Tomas 

Braniff by 1900. By 1950, the Compañía Minera Acoma, S. A. acquired and explored the properties 

without success, passing them to Messrs. Eloy Vallina and Antonio Guerrero. 

 

6.2 PEÑOLES TENURE 
 

Peñoles was interested in the area in the early 1930s when it rented a small smelting plant located at the 

nearby location of El Doctor. In the early 1960s, the properties were acquired by Compañía Minera 

Peñoles (Peñoles) exploring with geological mapping, sampling, magnetometry surveys, and core drilling 

that resulted in the discovery of the La Negra and El Alacrán ore bodies starting development in 1967 and 

operations in 1971 (Gaytán, 1973). It has been reported that Peñoles mined approximately 6.6 Mt with an 

average grade of 169 g/t Ag, 1.10% Pb, 2.20% Zn, and 0.48% Cu, through this period (Reyna Mining, 

2006). Due to its favorable location and mining method, La Negra was one of the most productive, low 

cost mining units in México at this time. In the year 2000, the mine was put under care and maintenance 

due to low metal prices. 

 

It has also been reported that at the time of the acquisition by Aurcana, La Negra had "Proven and 

Probable Reserves for 1.2 Mt graded 159 g/t Ag, 0.899% Pb, 2.838% Zn, and 0.939% Cu" (historic 

estimate and it does not meet the current criteria set under NI 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral 

Properties, MLN, 1999). 

 

In 2006, Aurcana initiated the preparation of mine, process plant and facilities to renew mining activities 

with a 1,000 tpd production rate, later increasing to 1,500 tpd in 2007, based on the Mineral Reserves left 

by Peñoles of 1.2 Mt. The reader should note that these reserves, as reported in Table 6.1 and Table 6.3 

are historic and do not comply with NI 43-101 guidelines, and therefore, should not be relied on.

Additional "Possible Reserves" of 968,600 tonnes at 159 g/t Ag, 1.13% Pb, 3.05% Zn, and 0.91% Cu 

were also reported (historic estimate that does not meet the current criteria set under NI 43-101 Standards 

for Disclosure for Mineral Properties). 

 

Ore reserves, as reported by Peñoles in 2000, were estimated following industry standards at the time; 

however, they pre-date implementation of NI 43-101 Standards and were not prepared by a qualified 

person. According to Wardrop (2008), "cut-off grade was not specified but would be based on the historic 

metal prices. The mineral reserves were reported to have been estimated by silling the ore zones at 

15 meters to 20 meters vertical sublevel intervals and channel sampling the back of the sublevels." 

 

During the later phases of mining by Peñoles, sampling control and close drilling of blocks were less 

frequent due to exploration budget cuts resulting in large dilution factors, low heads to the mill, and the 

eventual closure of operations. It is stressed that these figures are historic and were not prepared to CIM 

standards to comply with NI 43-101 (Ref: Behre Dolbear, 2000). 

 

6.3 AURCANA TENURE 
 

Mineral production by Aurcana's Minera La Negra, between 2006 and 2010, was of approximately 

1.0 Mt, as shown in Table 6.2.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 

La Negra is located near the southwestern edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental Mesozoic foldbelt of Central 

Mexico. Figure 7.1 shows the two major geologic domains in the area, Tertiary volcanic dominant rocks 

to the West and Mesozoic miogeosyncline rocks to the East. Figure 7.1 shows the La Negra and Zimapán 

Districts near their border and near the northern flank of the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt (Lang, et al., 

1999, Carrillo, 1990). Locally, La Negra is located within the El Doctor Mesozoic carbonate platform at 

the southwestern margin of the Sierra Madre Oriental terrain, locally in thrust contact against deeper 

clastic deposits of the Zimapán Basin. Both areas are characterized by the intrusion of a series of Tertiary 

calc-alkaline intrusives (Vasallo, 2008).

Both areas contain silver-polymetallic skarn ore bodies, which are connected with intrusions of Eocene 

age in the limestone sediments of El Doctor formation of early-cretaceous age. Plutonic systems are 

represented by multiphase intrusions, such as stocks and dikes, which characterize evolution of magmatic 

systems by middle solution up to felsites. The various displays of metasomatism and ore mineralization at 

different stages are connected to separate intrusive phases. The La Negra deposit is connected by 

intrusion of a granodiorite stocks and quartz-monzonite dikes. The Zimapan deposit is characterized by 

connection of ore mineralization with stocks of quartz-monzonite and lamprophyre. Inclusions have high 

homogenization temperatures with majority of data ranging between 330-600 Ñ. Salinity of these 

inclusions are 33 to 70 weight percent total salts (Vasallo, 2008). 

 

The stratigraphy in this area is formed by a thick group of Upper Jurassic shales and calcareous shales of 

the Las Trancas Formation. followed by Lower and Upper Cretaceous limestone and clastic sediments of 

the Doctor and Soyatal-Mezcala Formations. These formations are unconformably covered by Tertiary 

volcanic rocks and intruded by a granodiorite-diorite intrusive, also of Tertiary age (Table 7.1).

7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 

The main stratigraphic unit in the mine area is La Negra Facies of the Doctor Formation shown in blue in 

the map on Figure 7.2, characterized by black shaly-limestone with local chert nodules. This unit forms 

skarn development (green), in its contact with a diorite-granodiorite body (tan). Mineralized bodies, like 

the La Negra chimney, are commonly found around several small andesite stocks and dikes that have 

intruded the lime-mudstone La Negra Facies of the El Doctor Formation.

The limestone is folded to different degrees and the axes of the structures are oriented to the northwest. 

The dioritic stocks commonly show skarn aureole, and in the central part of these skarns often a rich zone 

of spurrite [Ca5 (SiO4)2 (CO3)] is found (Vasallo, 2008). 

 

Morrison (1982) has reported that three stages of skarn development occurred: (1) Spurrite-Borospurrite 

skarn at approximately 800°C to 890°C; followed by (2) Hedenbergite skarn along the borders of the 

intrusive associated to zone of diopside; (3) Andradite and contemporaneous hematite and wollastonite 

skarn; and (4) a final stage characterized by orthoclase, quartz, datolite, and or calcite vein filling with 

associated sulfides (chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena) replacing recrystallized calcite in garnet skarn. 

 

The aureola of metasomatic replacement is characterized by a massive assemblage of grossularite and 

andradite skarn at the hanging wall of the diorite intrusive (K Ar dating at 38.7 ± 0.08 Ma) followed by a 

clear contact with wollastonite skarn that is generally unmineralized. 

 

In the central part of the La Negra deposit, several post-skarn rhyolitic porphyry dikes are found. Several 

andesitic-basaltic porphyritic dikes related to effusive rocks are considered post-mineralization. 

 

7.3 GEOLOGIC CONTROLS 
 

Mineralized bodies at La Negra are closely related to the external boundary of a metasomatic contact zone 

between a Northeast-trending, generally dioritic intrusive and a series of medium to thick-bedded 

limestones of the El Doctor Formation. A series of minor stocks and dikes follow two northwest–trending 

zones, along which the Maravillas-Bicentenario, and San Pedro-Dificultad-Virginia Blanca ore bodies are 

found (Figure 7.3).

The main controls for the mineralization are (1) Lithological, through the presence of a favorable horizon 

(El Doctor Formation), locally named La Negra Facies, and (2) Structural, mainly along the limestone-

intrusive contact, following limestone bedding and folding (mantos, "chimneys"), and local structures 

(faults and dikes as veins and tabular deposits) – and also in the intersection of major structures as 

chimneys (Gaytán, 1973). 

 

7.4 MINERALIZED BODIES 
 

More than 20 different deposits have been discovered at La Negra, some of the deposits coalesce to form 

individual bodies. Mantoes and chimneys have comprised the bulk of silver, lead, zinc, and copper 

mineralization. The deposits include some chimneys that replace beds of La Negra limestone facies. 

These mantoes vary in size and range from 40 meters to 300 meters length and from 0.50 meters to 

40 meters thick. Vein deposits vary from 80 meters to 120 meters length, between 10 meters to 60 meters 

depth, and width from 0.50 meters to 1.20 meters (Figure 7.4).

Figure 7.6 shows a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the La Negra deposit as of 1974; however, it 

clearly depicts the nature and morphology of the deposit as a narrow chimney-like manto resting on top of 

the skarn aureole that surrounds the main diorite intrusive, in contact with the La Negra limestone. The 

measurements of the La Negra chimney are reported as 150 meters long, 60 meters wide, and 400 meters 

deep (Vasallo, 2008).

The Maravillas deposit is an irregular-tabular northwest-trending replacement deposit along the contact of

smaller, tabular deposit that seems to follow the same trend. 

 

7.4.3 Brecha-Cristo Rey, Trinidad, Alacrán 
 

These chimney-like deposits seem to be located following the northernmost northwest-trend. While El 

Alacrán has almost been mined out between 2150 and 2000 levels, Cristo Rey and Trinidad have been 

explored at depth to above the 1900 level and mineralization seems to be open at depth. 

 

7.4.4 Virginia-Blanca, Dificultad, Cobriza, San Pedro, Nuestra Señora, LaCruz 
 

A series of elongate and chimney-like skarn deposits are closely related to a series of northwest-trending 

intermediate dikes, following the southernmost structural trend known, generally between the 2200 and 

2400 levels. It is likely that the intersection of this trend with the main northeast Alacrán-La Negra trend 

was the loci for the Cobriza and Nuestra Señora deposits, currently indicated between the 2140 and 2000 

levels. 

 

It is important to notice that while the bulk of production has come from the Northeast trend, the Trinidad, 

Alacrán, Mónica La Cruz, and La Negra deposits have been developed above the 2000 level. Only the 

Trinidad, Bicentenario, and Breccia Cristo Rey deposits have been explored and partially developed and 

mined below the 2000 haulage level. 

 

The longitudinal section of Figure 7.6 shows that most other deposits below the 2200 level have not been 

fully explored. More than 1,200 meters of drift are developed from the face of 2300 level to the northeast-

trend. More than 950 meters between La Negra and El Alacrán require more exploration. 

 

7.5 TYPE, CHARACTER, AND DISTRIBUTION OF MINERALIZATION 
 

La Negra is characterized by complex mineralization that varies from massive to disseminated. Minerals 

of economic interest include galena, marmatite, chalcopyrite, and a silver-carrying sulfosalt, hessite 

(silver-tellurium sulfosalt) in a garnet and minor calcite-quartz gangue with variable associated pyrite-

pyrrothite. A close association between galena and the silver sulfosalts that report in the lead concentrates 

is apparent. 

 

The paragenetic sequence defined at La Negra is: 

 

Wollastonite  Diopside  Garnet. 

Replaced by  Pyrrothite Pyrite  Arsenopyrite  Marmatite  Chalcopyrite  Galena. 

 

Sulfide zoning indicates that lead and silver diminish at depth while zinc remains constant and copper 

increases at depth (Gaytán, 1973). 

 

7.6 METALLURGICAL CHARACTERIZATION 
 

Numerous process and metallurgical recovery studies have been performed during the more than 40 years 

of operation. From the mineralogical point of view recent mineral characterization studies, including ore

microscopy and XRF, have updated the type of minerals currently produced in the concentrates, their 

assemblage, predominance, association, mineral specimen intergrowths, liberation size, and potential 

refractory properties. 

 

A summary of mineral characteristics is in Table 7.2.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

8.1 SKARN DEPOSITS 
 

Silver and base metal mineralization at La Negra is closely associated to skarn deposits in a number of 

manto, chimney vein, and breccia deposits, as described in Section 7.0 of this report. Skarn formation is 

closely related to the external boundary of a metasomatic contact zone between a northeast-trending, 

generally dioritic intrusive and a series of medium to thick-bedded limestones of the El Doctor Formation, 

and to the contact of a series of irregular dikes following a general northwest-trend. 

 

Typical skarn deposits are composed of silicates, (pyroxene, garnet, wollastonite, scapolite), 

hydrosilicates (amphibole, epidote, chlorite) oxides, calcite, fluorite, and others, including sulfides (pyrite, 

pyrrhotite, sphalerite/marmatite, galena, chalcopyrite molybdenite, arsenopyrite, and others). 

 

Skarn deposits can be classified according to their origin (hydrothermal, metamorphic, emanation skarn), 

location (endoskarn, exoskarn related to an intrusive body), composition (calcareous, magnesian, silicate 

rich), prevailing mineralization (Fe, W, Cu, Zn, Pb, Mo, Sn). 

 

According to this, the La Negra deposits can be classified as continental magmatic-related zinc-copper 

(silver-lead) calcareous, andradite-grossularite-hedenbergite (mostly) exoskarn deposits. 

 

Typical zoning in these deposits is as follows. 

 

 Pb-Zn Skarn 
 

 Silicified/Silica Rich Intrusive  Garnet Endoskarn (mag-cpy)  Garnet Exoskar  
Piroxena (Sl)  Marble Recrystallized/Silicified Limestone  Limestone 

 

8.2 LA NEGRA DEPOSITS 
 

The manto and chimney skarn deposits at La Negra extend over 500 meters vertically, between elevations 

approximately 1,900 masl and 2,400 masl. 

 

Typical mineralization at La Negra varies with elevation with galena, marmatite, chalcopyrite, and a 

silver-carrying sulfosalt, hessite (silver-tellurium sulfosalt) in a garnet and minor calcite-quartz gangue 

with variable associated pyrite-pyrrothite. Sulfide zoning indicates that lead and silver diminish at depth 

while zinc remains constant and copper increases at depth (Gaytán, 1973). 

 

8.3 EXPLORATION MODEL 
 

Similar to La Negra, the Zimapán mining district, located 8.2 km to the southeast, is characterized by 

skarn replacement deposits along the contact of El Doctor limestone and the Tolimán intrusive 

(Figure 8.1). Skarn is composed of a wollastonite-garnet-quartz assemblage associated to the contact of a 

monzonite intrusive. Similarly also, at El Carrizal mineralization is associated to Mantoes, chimneys and 

fracture-controlled zones with predominant pyrite-pyrrothite, sphalerite galena, chalcopyrite, and lead-

antimony sulfosalts (Juan Morín, et al., 1986). One of the differences between both mineralized districts 

is the presence of Spurrite at La Negra.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 44 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

Comparison of mineral paragenesis, control setting, and fluid characteristics between Zimapan and La 

Negra ore zones shows that both deposits are similar. However, Lang, et al. (1999) report that there are 

three different styles of mineralization related to different formation levels at Carrizal and El Monte at 

Zimapán, in comparison with the La Negra deposit. It seems that the absence of spurrite at Zimapán 

suggests greater depths of intrusions. 

 

While the El Monte deposit is now exposed at the highest elevation it was actually formed at the greatest 

paleo-depth while El Carrizal at an intermediate depth and La Negra, which formed closest to the 

paleosurface (Figure 8.2).

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 45 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

From the discussion above it has been suggested that Carrizal-type mineralization could be present below 

the current level of development at La Negra. It is observed that exploration along the northwest-trend is 

limited to 2200 to 2300 levels. 

 

On the other hand, the vertical span of mineralization at La Negra is close to 500 meters. Some of the 

major skarn districts in Mexico, such as Naica and Concepción del Oro, can reach as much as 900 meters 

depth. 

 

It is concluded that La Negra shows an important exploration potential at depth.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 

9.1 MINERA LA NEGRA EXPLORATION 
 

Surface and underground exploration at La Negra is carried out by the Exploration Department, currently 

developing a detailed mapping and sampling program at surface focused on the western part of the 

District to detect possible drilling targets above the Alejandra-Virginia-Blanca deposits, as shown in the 

map of Figure 9.1.

Preliminary results indicate similar, favorable geology with skarn development along the contact with 

intermediate dikes. Some encouraging gold assay results have been found in local oxidation zones and are 

continuing to be evaluated. 

 

Systematic geological mapping and sampling are carried out underground at exploration, development, 

and mine faces by channel sampling. Figure 9.2 shows an example of mine level mapping, sampling, and 

drilling of 1935 level at Cristo Rey.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 49 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

Preliminary geological interpretations are made in advance plan maps and sections, and mapping and 

sampling data are then digitized and added to the geology database and to the Surpac® database. 

 

Based on the additional data, exploration workings, adits, and crosscuts are planned and developed as 

well as core drilling plans, following in general terms the year's program and budget. 

 

9.2 MINERA LA NEGRA EXPLORATION AND SAMPLING PROCEDURES 
 

Exploration generally follows procedures established during the time Peñoles operated the mine, with 

some modifications and improvements. During the latter part of 2011, MLN started to compile a Manual 

of Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) that will be contained in a single document about current 

methodologies for use by the geology department. A second objective is to standardize all operations to 

fully comply with NI-43-101 and CIM standards. 

 

In general terms, SOPs include purpose, scope, definitions, detailed procedures, formats used, related 

regulations, and photographic appendix. 

 

Preliminary SOPs for most exploration activities are being defined and some have been completed, as 

shown below. 

 

 Mine sampling 

 Surface sampling 

 Underground surveying 

 Underground core handling 

 Core handling and security in the core house 

 Core logging 

 Core cutting and sampling 

 QA/QC core sampling and control 

 Underground geological mapping 

 Surface geological mapping 

 Specific gravity measurements 

 MLN lab sample reception and control 

 MLN lab sample preparation and analysis 

 MLN lab QA/QC program and control 

 MLN lab QA/QC duplicate preparation 

 MLN lab QA/QC sterile sample preparation 

 MLN lab data handling and reporting

9.3 MINE SAMPLING 
 

The estimate of resources, presented in Section 14.0 of this report, is based on 22,289 channel samples in 

addition to 16,422 meters of core drill holes, collected by Minera La Negra S.A. de C.V. during the period 

2006 to February 2012 and by Industriales Peñoles S.A. de C.V. from 1967 to 2000. 

 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 50 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

The sampling database provides assay information of the 13 deposits considered in this report distributed 

over an area of 1,300 meters east-west by 900 meters north-south from Brecha-Crisro Rey to the North, to 

Virginia-Blanca to the West and La Negra to the south. 

 

Mine sampling follows Standard Operation Procedures (SOP). The location, length, and orientation of 

channel samples is defined by the geologist or trained technician, following the local geological 

mineralized structure. Vertical structures are commonly sampled on the ceiling of mine workings. Stopes 

are commonly sampled every cut for production control in parallel channels approximately 3.0 meters 

apart and samples commonly 2.0 meters long. SOP details sampling procedures (as described in 

Section 12.1.2 of this report) and safety procedures before, during, and after sampling are also detailed. 

Sample bags are marked, ID tag inserted, and the bag tied with a rope; control booklets used at MLN have 

three tags for sample bag, laboratory use (pulps), and geology control. Samples are taken to the reception 

area of the lab, where a copy of a sample control format is signed and filed along with the sample tag 

booklet. 

 

The authors made several recommendations to the Company about increasing accuracy in the location and 

mapping of samples and sample collection. Recommendations were also made about numbering and 

sample control format to eliminate duplicate sample numbers. 

 

Underground sampling density is considered adequate for ore control purposes and ore block tonnage and 

grade estimates. 

 

9.4 DRILL HOLE CORE SAMPLING 
 

The estimate of resources presented in Section 14.0 of this report is based on 16,422 meters of core drill 

holes in addition to 22,289 channel samples, collected by Minera La Negra S.A. de C.V. during the period 

2006 to February 2012 and by Industriales Peñoles S.A. de C.V. from 1967 to 2000. 

 

Core drilling is carried out from underground stations either to identify the extension of known deposits 

or to discover potential areas. In the first case, particularly where body definition is needed, drilling is 

made with a fan pattern and the spacing of the patterns vary. Block classification is assigned depending 

upon drilling spacing, commonly of less than 25 meters. 

 

Core boxes from underground diamond drilling are taken to core sample storage facilities. After the 

reception of a control format, they are placed in order on the logging table, to verify continuity and 

completeness, washed with a brush and water, and box numbering, depths, in both the core boxes and 

depth tags, verified. Recovery is then measured between depth tags and the core is logged and for 

lithology, contacts, mineralization, alteration, and structural features are recorded. Simultaneously, 

mineralized zones are marked in the core for sampling with distribution and length depending on 

mineralization characteristics. Sampled lengths vary between 0.10 meters and 2.0 meters. Marked core is 

then split with a diamond saw equipment and half core sampled and placed in plastic bags with the 

corresponding tag filled with ID data, date, and elements to be analyzed. Additionally, a third tag 

(attached to the booklet) includes the location, drill hole number, depth of sample, and date. Sample bags 

are registered in a shipping format that is received and signed in the lab. Elements routinely analyzed are 

silver, lead, zinc, copper, iron, arsenic, and occasionally antimony and bismuth.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 51 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

9.5 SAMPLING QA/QC PROCEDURES 
 

Quality control procedures have been established at La Negra in order to assure that assay results received 

from the lab allow the validation and verification of data that will be used in the mineral resource and ore 

reserve estimates. 

 

In general terms, approximately 10% of all samples sent to the lab are used for quality control purposes 

and an additional 5% sent to a second, external laboratory. 

 

A detailed description of QA/QC procedures, as established by MLN, is found in Section 11.0 of this 

report. 

 

9.6 SAMPLE QUALITY 
 

Several issues about the sampling process were raised during the review of operations: 

 

 Increase accuracy in the location of mine samples 

 Closer supervision during sampling 

 Change assay ticket booklets from 3 to 4 tags 

 Painting sample/channel identification number in the mine 

 Core sample collection equipment in the mine 

 Increasing the amount of large diameter core versus smaller diameters (e.g., HQ, NQ 
versus IEW) 

 

The author believes that these observations do not pose a risk or may affect the quality of data derived 

from the sampling processes. However, it is recommended that these observations are analyzed and the 

process improved. 

 

It is the author's opinion that the quality of sampling at La Negra is good and results, as derived from 

their quality and representativeness, have a high degree of confidence. 

 

9.7 MINERA LA NEGRA EXPLORATION RESULTS 
 

Reportedly, Aurcana initiated operations with historic "Reserves" left by Peñoles of 1.2 Mt graded 159 g/t 

Ag, 0.899% Pb, 2.838% Zn, and 0.939% Cu and additional "Possible Reserves" of 0.9 Mt at 159 g/t Ag, 

1.13% Pb, 3.05% Zn, and 0.91% Cu were also reported (Historic estimate that does not meet the current 

criteria set under NI 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Properties). 

 

During the period of operations by Aurcana, started in 2006 and through 2011, MLN has produced 

approximately 1.6 Mt of ore (Table 9.1).

10.0 DRILLING 
 

10.1 MLN DRILLING – 2006 TO 2011 
 

During the 2006 to 2008 period, Aurcana realized the need to develop Resources and expand Reserves 

with an aggressive exploration program of 50,000 meters. Approximately 33,705 meters were drilled 

between 2007 and 2011 and 12,000 meters per year are planned to be drilled in 2012 and 2013 

(Table 10.1). 

 

TABLE 10.1 

 MLN DRILLING IN THE 2007 TO 2011 PERIOD AND 2012 TO 2013 DRILLING PROGRAM 

 
 

The main purpose of this drilling campaign was to increase the quantity of the mineral resources and 

mineral reserves and to improve their confidence in order to replace reserves being mined. The original 

intent was to identify sufficient mineral resources and mineral reserves to evaluate increasing production 

from 1,000 tpd to 1,500 tpd. Most of the drilling planned for 2011 and 2012 was planned to find 

extensions of La Negra, Cobriza (1, 2, and 3), Mónica, Alacrán Cristo Rey-Breccia, La Cruz, 

Bicentenario, Trinidad, and Maravillas ore bodies.

As a result of the drilling campaigns, MLN has been able to replace reserves mined through the period 

2007 to 2010 (Table 10.2) and increase "reserves" as of June 2011 to 1.8 Mt (Table 10.3 and the 

longitudinal section of Figure 10.6).

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 63 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

It is noticed that MLN carried out, between 2008 and 2010, the certification of approximately 1.0 Mt in 

the Alacrán and Maravillas ore bodies that are included in Table 10.3 (MLN, September 2011 

PowerPoint® presentation). 

 

MLN also estimated in the order of 940,000 tonnes of Inferred resources and 440,000 tonnes of "Drill 

Indicated Resources" in isolated ore intersections through the mine. 

 

The authors believe that the "Reserve" figures shown in Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 should be considered 

as historic estimate and it does not meet the current criteria set under NI 43-101 Standards for Disclosure 

for Mineral Properties. 

 

10.3 DRILLING PROCEDURES 
 

Core drilling at La Negra is carried out by its own drilling department, currently with 6 drilling equipment 

with capacities from 40 meters in IEW diameter to 750 meters in NQ diameter (Table 10.4). 

 

TABLE 10.4 

 MLN DRILLING EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE 

 
 

The drilling capacity of MLN was slightly over 1,000 meters per month through 2011 (Table 10.5 and 

larger for 2012, if we consider the recently acquired LY55 equipment for which we have no production 

information yet (see Section 12.0 for a discussion of sampling procedures and recoveries).

TABLE 10.5 

 MLN CORE DRILLING AT LA NEGRA – MONTHLY ADVANCES 

(JANUARY TO AUGUST 2011) 

 
 

The hardness and massive characteristics of skarn and limestone and to some degree of the diorite 

intrusive and dikes provide good core recoveries. In the case of mineralized sections, core recovery is also 

good, commonly over 85% to 90%, although this can be lower in strongly fractured zones, local breccias 

zones, and strongly altered zones. It is also common that recoveries are lower whenever smaller core 

diameters are used, e.g., Packsack's IEW (25.4 mm) and to some degree Diamec's TT46 (28 mm). It was 

recommended that special care be taken (speed, drilling mud, and additives), when drilling broken ore 

contacts and mineralized zones. 

 

The authors believe that drilling recovery is not a factor that should substantially impact accuracy and 

reliability of resource-reserve estimates.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

MLN has established a QA/QC program that includes sample preparation and assay for duplicate and 

barren samples. The objective is to obtain: 

 

 Assurance in the quality of the sample, its handling and preparation process (QA) in 
order to obtain, and to be able to demonstrate a desired level of reliability in the assays. 

 

 Quality control in the process (QC) includes the procedures used to obtain a desired level 
of accuracy and precision in the assays. 

 

11.2 QA/QC PROCEDURES 
 

MLN standard procedures for QA/QC control include the use of duplicate, standard, and blank samples. 

The lab follows specific protocols for the preparation of both types of samples. Routinely, QA/QC 

samples are inserted in the sampling stream to the lab by the geology department, one barren, duplicate, 

and standard every 30 samples or one check sample every 10. MLN lab also follows an internal 

verification program by inserting one check pulp sample for every 10. 

 

 Barren samples are usually limestone, marble, wollastonite, or quartz samples taken from 
areas outside the mine area. A 50 kg sample of barren material ("Blanks") is provided by 

the geology department and sent to the laboratory, where it is crushed to minus ¼ inch 

and sent back to geology where a thoroughly homogenized split is processed following 

the same protocol and procedures as regular samples and then sent to multiple analysis. 

Once the sample has proven to be sterile, a split of the pulp is inserted every 10 samples 

into the assay stream. In addition, a crushed sample is inserted by the geologists every 

30 samples into the sample stream. Currently, the barren sample comes from a marble 

bank at Vizarrón, approximately 15 km away from La Negra. 

 

 Duplicate samples are inserted every 30 samples by adding a second tag with the 
following number to the sample to be processed and two pulps so that two pulps are 

produced and analyzed. Duplicate pulp samples are also prepared by the lab for internal 

control and analyzed every 10 samples. 

 

"Standard" samples are also prepared internally by the lab with different mineralized samples provided by 

the geology department. A 50 kg composite, representative sample from all stopes under operation is 

taken and sent to the laboratory where it is crushed to minus ¼ inch and sent back to geology and a 

thoroughly homogenized split is processed following the same protocol and procedures as regular 

samples and sent to multiple analysis. Average values, after eliminating highest and lower values, are 

used for the standard; the remaining pulp will be used to be inserted every 10 samples into the assay 

stream. In addition, a crushed standard sample is inserted by the geologists every 30 samples in the 

sample stream. 

 

11.3 INTERNAL MLN QA/QC CONTROL 
 

MLN labs have a program of internal control by duplicating pulps and re-assaying pulps, as previously 

mentioned. 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 66 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

 

A file was created containing the assay results of 323 assay duplicates and 140 repeats between January 

2011 and April 2011. Sample values varied between 2.0 g/t Ag and 1,680 g/t Ag, 0.001% Pb and 

3.93% Pb, 0.0% Zn and 17.51% Zn, and 0.0% Cu and 12.80% Cu. Table 11.1 shows the average percent 

variation between pairs of duplicates and repeats with differences of less than 3.5% in all elements of 

interest, with the exception of copper with a difference of minus 6.3% in repeats but only 0.2% in 

duplicates.

Approximately 20 to 30 pulp samples per month are now sent by the lab for verification at the ALS 

Chemex certified laboratories in Vancouver for additional external control. 

 

11.4 QA/QC COMMENTS 
 

Although there is a procedure for the preparation of blank samples, this does not include a detailed 

description of standard sample preparation and the number of analyses to be made as well as verification 

in the external labs. It is recommended that blanks be obtained from specialized labs and in the meantime 

to acquire high purity silica sand to use as a blank. 

 

It was also recommended that standard samples be purchased from a specialized lab, and preferably have 

the standards prepared with La Negra material at different head grades. 

 

11.5 SAMPLE PREPARATION 
 

Sample preparation protocols have been established in the lab for mine, core, and other exploration rock 

samples collected by the geology department plus duplicates and "blank" samples. Before a batch of 

"exploration" samples are passed, the crushing section is cleaned by crushing and pulverizing barren 

material, previously assayed. 

 

MLN laboratory receives mine and surface rock, mineral, and core samples from the geology department 

in their reception facilities. After checking origin, number of samples, and sample tags received, a copy of 

the sample list format is signed, samples are placed in a tray and dried at 110°C, passed to the crushing 

section, and reduced to minus ¼ inch. Every 15 samples, the crushing-pulverizing section, is cleaned 

again with barren material Every 10 samples is split with a Jones splitter to obtain a duplicate check 

sample. Once homogenized, a 200-gram sample is passed through a ring centrifugal pulverizer to 

minus 100 mesh and split. A 100-gram pulp is placed in an envelope, marked with its respective 

ID number, and sent to the assay section. After every 10 samples, one duplicate pulp is obtained. 

 

11.6 SAMPLE ANALYSES 
 

Gold and silver are fire assayed. Fusion of the sample, with a flux, is made in an electric furnace; 

resulting doré buttons are weighted in electronic balances (Toledo and Sartorius – 0.1 grams to 160 grams 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 67 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

precision), silver is dissolved with nitric acid, the gold button left weighted, and calculations of silver and 

gold weights made. 

 

Lead, zinc, copper, iron, arsenic, bismuth, and antimony are assayed by Atomic Absorption. Pulp samples 

are dissolved in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid (Aqua Regia), dried and diluted in distilled 

water. The solution is passed and readings made in one of the two Varian AA 240Fl analyzers; a third 

Perkin Elmer AA equipment is currently not functional. MLN uses two calibration standards per element 

and the corresponding silver, lead, zinc, copper, iron, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth lamps. A regular 

standard sample from a qualified lab in Canada is inserted with every 15 samples for QC. Readings are 

made, registered manually in a control book, digitized and checked by the supervisor before uploading to 

the MLN intranet for consultation by the geology department. Only two lab supervisors have secured 

access to the database and changes cannot be made externally. 

 

The author recommends the company transfer the analyses stored in the AA equipment directly to the 

assay database to avoid the time-consuming digitizing and potential human errors. 

 

11.7 SAMPLE SECURITY 
 

Mine samples are registered on the chain of custody form and delivered directly to the reception section 

of the MLN labs on a daily basis. 

 

Core boxes at the drill site are tied-up with rubber bands or rope and are transported daily by the geologist 

or geology personnel to the core house to be studied and sampled. No core boxes are left on-site for the 

following day. From the moment the core boxes leave the drill site, they follow a secure path by filling 

out the chain of custody form that it has been received, which is signed by the person in charge at the core 

house. Later, samples are taken from the core house are delivered to the reception area at the laboratory. 

In both cases, the chain of custody forms are signed by the receiving party and the form is filed in the 

geology department. Samples not delivered to the lab remain in the core house premises and stored in 

secure areas with limited, locked access to the geologist in charge. 

 

11.8 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING SAMPLE PREPARATION, ASSAYING, AND 
SECURITY 

 

It is the author's opinion that sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures, as followed by the 

laboratories at La Negra, follow industry standards and are reliable. This assertion is backed by the 

numerous internal sample checks and the mine's pulps and core sample verification carried out by the 

authors and described in Section 11.3 and Section 12.0. 

  

Some improvements to the general process can be made and are found throughout the report as 

recommendations made to the MLN geology and lab personnel.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

La Negra mine has a long history of exploration and mining activities that dates back to the sixties when 

Peñoles' Minera La Negra y Anexas, S.A. carried out an extensive exploration and drilling program that 

resulted in the discovery and partial blocking of the Alacrán and La Negra ore bodies. Mining began at La 

Negra in 1970 and continued through 2000 when metal prices and economic conditions forced the closure 

of the mine. Further exploration and mining activities have been carried out by Aurcana since taking over 

in 2007 through the present time. 

 

A review was made of available information derived from previous exploration work. This information 

included geological and sampling reports, drill logs as well as assay results. Verification consisted of a 

general review of geological characteristics some of the main mineralized areas, spot verification of some 

drill holes shown by MLN, underground mine checking of geology, and MLN sampling procedures as 

well as a review of some mineralized intersections and discussions of detailed sample handling, sampling, 

and security procedures established by MLN. 

 

12.1 MLN OPERATION PROCEDURES 
 

Minera La Negra has developed a series of Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) and is in the process of 

updating and compiling them into a Manual of Exploration Operations.  

 

12.1.1 MLN Exploration Standard Operations Procedures 
 

SOPs have been established and documented and are being in the process of further development by the 

exploration department of La Negra, as discussed in Section 9.1 of this report. 

 

Some written SOP follow common industry standards; however, others are still preliminary in nature and 

are currently being revised and supplemented 

 

12.1.2 Mine Sampling Verification 
 

Reportedly 6.6 Mt, with an average grade of 169 g/t Ag, 1.10% Pb, 2.20% Zn, and 0.48% Cu were mined 

during this period (Reyna Mining, 2006) and 1.2 Mt in (historical) "Reserves" were left with an average 

grade of 159 g/t Ag, 0.90% Pb, 2.83% Zn, and 0.94% Cu (Behre Dolbear, 2000). Between 50% and 60% 

of 2000 Peñoles' historic Proven and Probable reserves were located in the Alacrán, Maravillas, Cristo 

Rey, and La Negra ore bodies. MLN Proven and Probable reserves (MLN, September 4, 2011) of the 

Alacrán, Maravillas, Cristo Rey, La Negra, Brecha Norte, Cobriza 2, and Mónica accounted for 60% of 

the total historic estimates. These estimates do not meet the standards, as set under NI 43-101 Standards 

for Disclosure for Mineral Properties). 

 

Based on this, a mine check sampling program was designed and carried out by MLN personnel under the 

direction of the author. A total of 35 samples out of 40 programmed were taken, in most cases contiguous 

to the original Peñoles' or MLN's channels in 13 ore bodies, as shown below. The number of 

representative samples selected was proportional to the Non-NI43-101-compliant reserves estimated by 

MLN for the ore body, as of September 2011 (Table 12.1). 

 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 69 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

TABLE 12.1 

 REPRESENTATIVE MINE CHECK SAMPLING PROGRAM 

 
 

A review of current sampling methodology was also undertaken from sample location and surveying to 

channel disk cutting, sample taking, recording, transportation, and security to the lab. 

 

In general terms, samples are marked in the walls of the development adits and stope faces, perpendicular 

to the geological grain and with a spacing in the order of 3.0 meters and variable widths. In the mine, a 

review of the sampling site is made and required infrastructure provided (water, compressed air hoses), 

the ceiling of the sampling area is secured and samples located from the closest surveying point. 

 

The sampling location is washed, samples marked and a 10 centimeter (cm) wide, 1.0 cm deep channels 

cut in slabs with the help of a Hilti HS200 diamond saw. Samples are cut with chisel and hammer and 

collected in plastic bags and a sample tag inserted in the bag. Finally, samples and sample number are 

painted with spray in the face. Sample slabs are placed in plastic bags, closed with string, and transported 

daily by geology personnel directly to the laboratory. The author made several recommendations in the 

location and mapping of samples, as well as in the numbering and sample control process. 

 

12.1.3 Drilling and Core Sampling Verification 
 

At the time of the site visit, MLN operated four diamond coring machines, one Diamec 232, one Ingetrol 

JR-60E, and two JKS 25 Packsack for short holes. To these, an additional Diamec 232 and one Longyear 

LM-55 have been added. The author saw the operation of the Ingetrol 500 and sample recovery and 

handling in the operation. It was verified that numbering at the beginning and end of core boxes, as well 

as depth markers and recoveries are recorded properly by the operators. Core boxes are tied with a plastic 

rope and transported by geology personnel once or twice a day.

The author found the operations adequate but made several observations in the core drilling operation, 

particularly in the reception and handling of the core sample with the use of a proper collection tool and 

the filling of a format onsite before delivery to the core house. 

 

Core sample boxes are received in the core shack and placed for review on a logging table. Verification of 

box numbering, beginning and end depths as well as completeness, location and depth intervals of depth 

markers is made by a technician. Core is tightly assembled, washed, and recovery between markers is 

measured and registered in the core logging format by the geologist in charge. Geological logging is then 

made. 

 

RQD measurements are not taken at La Negra, as the host rock is good and stable. 

 

12.2 CHECK SAMPLING 
 

Considering the different exploration and operation stages at La Negra, the author carried out several 

sample checks: 

 

 Internal MLN Lab Assay Verification – Verification of pulps remaining in MLN 
laboratory 

 

 Lab Assay Verification – Verification of pulps remaining in MLN laboratory versus 
ALS Labs 

 

 Mine Sampling, Sample Preparation, MLN Assay Verification – Verification of mine 
channel samples, MLN laboratory versus ALS Labs 

 

 Drill hole core sampling, sample preparation, MLN assay verification 
 

Overall, 146 samples were re-analyzed at ALS Chemex labs with the same assay methodology followed 

by La Negra Lab. Gold was fire assayed in 30 gram pulps with Atomic Absorption finish. Silver, lead, 

zinc, copper, and arsenic were digested in Aqua Regia and analyzed with AAS (Atomic Absorption 

Spectroscopy). Sample preparation, ALS Codes, and analytical procedures are found in the Assay 

Certificate in Appendix 3.0. 

 

12.2.1 Internal MLN Lab Assay Verification 
 

One hundred sixty pulp production samples analyzed between January and April 2011 were retrieved and 

re-analyzed by MLN's own lab. Sample control numbers are shown in Table 12.2.

Thirty-five channel samples were taken from 13 different ore bodies in a number that represented 

approximately the proportion of resources of the same. Samples were taken where old channel samples 

numbers could be identified, and parallel, contiguous channels could be made (Table 12.5).

12.2.4 Drill Hole Core Sampling Verification 
 

Considering the variation in diameters and limited availability of old drill holes core, it was decided (1) to 

retrieve existing pulp samples from old intersections and (2) re-sample some available core (Table 12.7). 

 

 42 pulp samples were sent to ALS Chemex Lab for re-analysis. 

 38 quarter core samples were taken and sent to ALS Chemex Lab for re-analysis.

12.3 ASSAY VERIFICATION CONCLUSIONS 
 

Several observations can be made from this check sampling 

 

1) The internal MLN verification of pulps resulted in good correlations for Ag, Pb, Zn, and 
Cu, with "r" values between 0.95 and 0.99. 

 

2) Verification of production pulps remaining in MLN versus ALS laboratories. Assay 
results had good "r" correlation values between 0.89 and 0.98. 

 

3) Correlation values in all elements are also good in the verification made of underground 
channel sampling, although with a higher dispersion, particularly in Ag. 

 

4) Check sampling of MLN core pulps against ALS Labs is particularly good in all 
elements, in the order of 0.99. 

 

Mine sampling, sample preparation, MLN assay verification, verification of mine channel samples, MLN 

laboratory versus ALS Labs. 

 

It is concluded that results reported are acceptable; therefore, mine sampling, core sampling, and sample 

preparation and assaying at MLN's laboratory are considered reliable.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

MLN currently operates a conventional milling and flotation plant with a capacity of 2,200 tpd producing 

zinc, lead, and copper concentrates. MLN operates a laboratory with well-equipped assay and 

metallurgical research facilities. 

 

Routine metallurgical lab testing is commonly carried out when mining of new sections of the mine or 

new ore bodies are planned to be mined to establish their particular process parameters or sections of the 

mine where specific mineralogical, hardness, grain size, or contents of deleterious materials may be 

expected. 

 

According to the monthly operation reports of MLN, from January to May 2012, approximately 

244,000 tonnes were milled with the production of 1,525 tonnes of lead concentrate, 6,259 tonnes of zinc 

concentrate, and 3,316 tonnes of copper concentrate. Average recoveries for the 5-month period were 

84.86% and 81.0% of silver and lead in lead concentrates, respectively; 74.62% of zinc in zinc 

concentrates; and 70.66% of Copper in copper concentrates, and are considered to be representative of ore 

produced from the different active stopes in different ore bodies throughout the mine, during the said 

period. 

 

Currently, MLN lab is focusing its metallurgical research in their own facilities to improve recoveries, 

improve the quality of concentrates, milling, and reagent use controls, granulometry control, and ore 

blending and feeding according to the material received from different mine stopes. 

 

For such purposes, the metallurgical laboratory has carried out the following activities: 

 

 Mineral characterization of concentrates 

 Metallurgical lab testing for the optimization of lead, copper and zinc circuits 

 Research in the use of different collectors in the copper circuit 

 Research in the use of different promoters in the lead, copper and zinc circuits 

 Standardization and plant automation with the installation of Outotec's Courier 
equipment 

 

Excess bismuth, antimony, and arsenic in copper concentrates is penalized by smelters, as well as excess 

iron in zinc concentrates and excess bismuth, antimony, arsenic, and zinc and insolubles in lead 

concentrates. Therefore, most of the metallurgical testing focuses on the detection of ore zones with 

potential penalized elements and in the improvement of recoveries and operation parameters and costs. 

 

Bismuth in lead concentrates (over 2% bismuth) is the element with the highest NSR penalties. Therefore, 

the analysis of the source of bismuth, tracing back to the stopes and further characterization of the ore is 

recommended.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

14.1 SCOPE OF WORK 
 

Resources for the La Negra property were estimated using several automated interpolation methods, 

including geostatistics. The Company divided the area into 13 separate "deposits." Figure 14.1 shows the 

layout of the deposits and the mineralized envelopes defined by the Aurcana geologists. 

 

 
 

Figure 14.1. Plan view layout of the deposits and the mineralized envelopes 

 

Most of the deposits were analyzed and modeled separately, but several were combined and analyzed as a 

single unit because they are physically close or intersected. Cobriza and La Cruz intersected in a small 

volume so the solids were combined and modeled as a single unit. The drill holes and channel samples for 

Cobriza, La Cruz, and Ntra._Sra. were combined into a single database, checked to eliminate duplicate 

samples, and grades were estimated in a single model. Brecha-Cristo Rey and Trinidad did not intersect, 

but were combined into a single block model because they were separated by about 20 meters.

14.2 RESOURCE SUMMARY 
 

The La Negra deposits contain four primary metals with economic value. Silver is the key metal although 

the other metals contribute substantially. The mineral resource tonnage and grades were estimated by 

generating 3D block models for each deposit. 

 

To consider the contained minerals as a single economic unit, a recovered block value is calculated based 

on the modeled grade estimates using the metal prices and recoveries shown in Table 14.1. The metal 

prices used are the trailing 12-quarter averages as of June 30, 2012 and the recoveries are the average of 

the monthly recoveries reported by the Company from January 2012 through May 2012.

Recoveries are the average of actual mill recoveries from January through May 2012.  

 

The mineral resource estimates were made in accordance with CIM standards and a recovered block value 

of US$40 per tonne was used as the economic cutoff for the Mineral resource summaries. 

 

Table 14.2 through Table 14.7 summarize the mineral resources for all the Aurcana La Negra deposits.

 The resources for each deposit are contained within volumes derived from geological 
limits as defined by the Company. 

 

 Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. The average economic values reported are only a guideline to economic 

potential and are not a concise definition of a reserve. 

 

14.3 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES 
 

The following information summarizes the general methods used to analyze the deposits. Details of the 

analysis for each individual deposit are included after this procedure summary section. 

 

14.3.1 Data Received 
 

The drill hole and underground channel sample data was provided in Microsoft Access® databases, with 

one database supplied for each "deposit." Each database contained tables for collars, surveys, assays, and 

geology (lithology) for the drill holes. Geology for the underground channel samples was not included in 

the digital database. 

 

The Company provided solid models of the mineralized areas generated using the Surpac® geologic and 

mine planning software package. Solid models of the underground workings were also provided in a 

Surpac format (.dtm) and the existing underground workings were subtracted from the final solid. The 

mineral resource quantities (grades and tonnes) were estimated only within the geological solid models 

with the workings extracted. The QP made a review of geological level maps with the Geology Staff of 

MLN, made a series of observations and found that the geological envelopes as interpreted by MLN are 

reasonable to be used in the resource estimate. 

 

All dimensions and distances are metric. 

 

The Company also provided technical reports including the following. 

 

 "Technical Report on the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves of the el Alacrán 
Deposit of the La Negra Silver, Lead, Zinc, Copper Mine Queretaro, Mexico", Wardrop, 

2008. 

 

 "Mineral Resource Estimate Monica Deposit La Negra Mine, Queretaro State, Mexico 
March 14, 2008", GeoSim Services Inc., 2008 

 

14.3.2 Data Analysis 
 

The Micromine® geologic and mine planning software was used for the data analysis and block modeling 

for this report. 

 

Classical statistics were run for each deposit. Details are included in Appendix 2.0 and also with each 

deposit summary. 

 

Compositing at the La Negra deposits was not done because many of the assays were already 2 meters in 

length. Test composites were calculated, but the compositing sometimes fragmented the data and created 

more intervals than the uncomposited data. Compositing fragments the data for these deposits. When the 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 90 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

drill hole assay samples are linked to a geological composite, the intervals are fragmented even more. The 

drill hole assays were not identified by geological zone. 

 

All of the data in each supplied database was used to construct variograms and subsequently estimate 

grades in the block models. The data includes a combination of drill hole core assays and channel sample 

assays. Parts of the mine are heavily channel sampled, so the distribution of data in some areas is 

clustered along the drifts and workings while drill hole data is scattered in both mined and un-mined 

areas. In many of the deposits, the influence of the channels is much stronger than the drill hole 

influences. 

 

Variograms were constructed on the natural log of the raw data using only channel samples, only drill 

holes, and all assays combined. The channel samples influence areas near the mine workings, and the drill 

hole assays are apparent in the more distant areas. In some cases, the difference is distinctive and results 

in "nested" variograms. 

 

Cross validation was used to determine the applicability of the variograms. Plots of the original grade 

versus the estimate obtained from the cross validation results were also used to determine the natural cut 

for silver. A top cut of the silver grade was applied for all the deposits. 

 

14.4 MODELING PROCEDURE 
 

A block size of 5 meters × 5 meters × 5 meters is used for all the models. Many of the assays are spaced 

less than 5 meters apart (especially the channel samples), so the assays are averaged by the modeling 

program when more than one assay appears in a block. 

 

Block model limits are set at the limits of the data. The data limits extend well beyond the geological 

limits defined by the company. 

 

The silver block grade estimates were generated with Ordinary Kriging with limiting factors determined 

by the variograms. The copper, lead, and zinc estimates were determined using an inverse distance 

weighting method with a power of three. The same search radii and ellipsoids were used for both 

methods. Inverse distance weighting to a power of three was used as an alternative block model check and 

to estimate the copper, lead, and zinc. The overall average grades for silver from both estimation methods 

matched closely. 

 

All samples provided for each of the deposit databases were used in the estimation even though many of 

the samples were outside the geological limits. In a few cases, outlying samples with distances greater 

than 200 meters from the other samples were excluded. A few duplicate samples were also deleted from 

the databases. 

 

14.5 VOLUME CALCULATIONS 
 

Resources (grades and tonnes) were estimated in block models encompassing the geological limits and 

the associated data. When the block model was completed, the model was intersected by the geological 

limits solids with the workings removed. The final deposit models included only blocks extracted from 

the full block model contained within each mineralized geologic limit solid.

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 91 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

Volumes inside the geological limits wireframes were calculated with the Micromine software. To fit the 

block models to the geological limits, sub-blocking
1
 was used and set so that a block could be divided 

into four segments in each direction. The smallest sub-blocks could be 1.25 meters on a side. All sub-

blocks are assigned the same grade as the original parent block. 

 

Block model volumes were compared to the volume of the geological limit solids and the volumes 

differed by no more than 0.5%. The sub-block size was accepted as being representative of the geological 

limit solid. 

 

The bulk density was assumed to be 3.2 tonnes per cubic meters (t/m
3
). This is the factor used by Peñoles 

in previous resource estimates at La Negra and in other resource reports. 

 

14.6 CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE 
 

Resource classification can be done using several automated techniques applied to data calculated during 

block value estimation. Classification by Kriging variance is one option that was considered. Another 

classification option considered was to use average distance from the block to the data points used to 

estimate the block value. Resource classification is commonly based on several factors including data 

generated by the estimation methods and judgmental factors such as geology and other physical 

limitations. The author determined that classification by average distance to samples was most 

appropriate for the deposits. 

 

Three runs were made for each deposit using increasing search distances. Data produced by the 

interpolation techniques include statistical variances, number of data points used in the estimation, and an 

average distance from the block to the sample data used to estimate the block value.  

 

The classifications were based on the following. 

 

 Average Distance. For the La Negra deposits, resources were initially classified based on 
average distance to a block from the data points used to estimate the block grades. The 

distance limits used for the first level classification reflect the ranges as determined by 

variography and search distances as used for grade estimates. 

 

 In Situ Metal Value. An in situ metal value was calculated for each block (Table 14.1). 
A block with a value less than US$40 per tonne was not included in the resource. The in 

situ metal value allows for all metals to be considered as contributing rather than setting 

cutoffs for one or more grades. 

 

 Existence of Mine Workings. In addition to average distance and value, where large 
areas of a volume had no mine workings and only drill holes, those volumes were 

allowed a classification of indicated or inferred only and include no measured resources. 

 

Distance classification is a commonly used technique and is based on the distance from the centroid of the 

interpolated block to the samples used for the estimate. Micromine stores the average distance from the 

block centroid to the data used for the estimate. Thus, the lowest average distances become Measured 

resources and the further distances become Indicated and Inferred resource.

Sub-blocking is a process of dividing a block into smaller segments to more closely fit an outline.

Categorization conforms to the CIM definitions for Mineral Resources:  

 

A Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralization that under realistically assumed and 

justifiable technical and economic conditions, might become economically extractable. 

 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 

grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 

sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The 

estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate 

techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

 

Due to the uncertainty which may attach to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be 

assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an 

Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence 

in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and 

economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public 

disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the 

basis of feasibility or other economic studies. 

 

Indicated Mineral Resource 

 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a 

level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability 

of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 

grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

 

Mineralization may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified 

Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow 

confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the 

continuity of mineralization. The Qualified Person must recognize the importance of the 

Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the project. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a Preliminary 

Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions. 

 

Measured Mineral Resource 

 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they 

can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of 

technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the 

economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 

exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México  

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 93 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced 

closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

 

Mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a 

Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity 

and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade of the mineralization can be 

estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate would not 

significantly affect potential economic viability. This category requires a high level of 

confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit. 

 

Resources in the Measured and Indicated classes are reported in Table 14.8 and Table 14.9. Inferred 

resources are summarized in Table 14.10.

14.7 RESOURCE RISK 
 

Resource estimation is based on data interpretation and extrapolation of limited sample volumes to very 

large volumes. Several levels of risk are identified for the La Negra deposits. 

 

 Low to Moderate – Grade Interpretation Methods. Automated grade estimates depend 
on many factors and interpolation methods assume continuity between samples. 

Variography is used to define relationships between data points that helps to mitigate the 

smoothing effects of the interpolations. A risk always exists that a grade estimate at any 

3-dimensional location in a deposit will not match actual mining. An automated 

interpolation cannot account for the vein without restricting the interpolation to those 

areas only inside a solid model representing the vein boundaries. 

 

 Moderate Risk – Geological and Mined Area Definition. The geological limits 
supplied by the company extend laterally beyond known mining areas and can be 

considered a mineral envelope rather than an interpretation of the limits of mineralized 

area. A risk is inherent in the extension of grade estimations into wall rock in the areas of 

previous mining. Many of the mined areas were presumably excavated some years ago 

under different economic conditions and the potential for metal values in the mined areas 

could still exist. Some of the areas appear to be more massive and some appear to be vein 

limited. The ore volume could be over-estimated, if the mined area outlines do not 

include material that was actually mined and never recorded. 

 

 Low to Moderate Risk – Lithology Definition. A lithology model was not used because 
of limited data available and lack of definition of the boundaries of zones such as skarns 

and limestones. Instead, the geological limits of the deposits as provided by the company 

were used to limit geology. 

 

 Low Risk – Density. A general density of 3.2 t/m
3
 has been traditionally used for 

tonnage estimates at the property. A better definition of the density by rock type 

combined with a lithology model could enhance the resource estimate and provide a 

higher level of confidence in the tonnages. 

 

14.8 DEPOSIT MODELS 
 

Resources for the La Negra property were estimated using several automated interpolation methods, 

including geostatistics. The deposit area is divided by the company into 13 separate "deposits" or models. 

The individual deposits show some grade continuity similarities. However, the variograms of the deposits 

were different and resulted in different models. All the deposits exhibit a "nugget" effect. 

 

Some of the deposits, as outlined by the Company's geologists, appear to follow a vein structure, while 

some of the deposits are more massive. The amount of geological information in the databases was 

limited, so the solids as provided are the basis for limiting the models geologically. 

 

The solid models provided by the geologists include the underground workings. The figures with each of 

the deposit summaries include a picture of the solid models with workings removed and pictures of the 

block models with the assay data points.

When the volume of the block model inside the geological limits is calculated, any blocks that intersect 

the mined areas are eliminated. The final block model includes only those blocks inside the geological 

limits that have not been mined. 

 

14.9 ALACRÁN 
 

The Alacrán geological limits are shown in Figure 14.2. The limits are divided into three sections. A 

block model was designed to encompass the three areas and include all the assays in the Alacrán database.

northeasterly 

 

Figure 14.3 shows the block model restricted to the three geological limit volumes along with the assays 

used for estimation. Note that for Alacrán, very few of the channel sample assays are located inside the 

geological limits as defined by the company. The channel samples combined with the drill hole assays 

define the modeling parameters.

14.9.3 Classification and Resources 
 

Resource classification followed the method as described in Section 14.6. In addition, adjustments were 

made to customize the classification to the deposit configuration. 

 

 Upper Area – Only indicated and inferred classifications were assigned above elevation 
2,155. 

 

 Lower Area to East – No changes were made from the classification based on average 
distance and block value. 

 

 Lower Area to West – All model blocks to the west of X = 5,270 were set to inferred 
because of limited data and only drilling penetrated the area. 

 

Table 14.16 shows the summary of Measured and Indicated mineral resources for the Alacrán deposit.

14.11 BRECHA-CRISTO REY AND TRINIDAD 
 

The Brecha-Cristo Rey and Trinidad deposits did not intersect, but were combined into a single block 

model because they were separated by about 20 meters. The databases were combined and statistics were 

run on the deposits separately and together. Variogram analysis was done separately and combined. It was 

determined that a single model was suitable for the two areas. 

 

The Brecha\Trinidad geological limits are shown in Figure 14.6.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 116 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

The Trinidad geological limits used for determining the resources has a minor error. Two mining levels 

below the major mining workings in the upper portion of the limits were not subtracted from the solid. 

The volume of those levels is minor and only affects the total tonnage in the inferred resources. An 

estimate of the volume of the lower workings is not available. 

 

14.12 COBRIZA/LACRUZ/NTRA._SRA. 
 

The deposits for Cobriza, LaCruz, and Ntra._Sra. were analyzed with a single block model for several 

reasons. The geological limits provided by the company for Cobriza and La Cruz intersected (had shared 

volumes), and the Ntra._Sra. deposit is very close to the Cobriza area. Because these areas are located 

close together, the assay data was combined into a single block model. Statistics were run for the areas 

separately and combined (Figure 14.8). 

 

 
 

Figure 14.8. Cobriza, La Cruz and Ntra._Sra. geological limits showing internal workings 

(darker areas) – looking northeasterly 

 

Figure 14.9 shows the block model restricted to the geological limit volumes along with the assays used 

for estimation. The channel samples combined with the drill hole assays define the modeling parameters.

14.17.4 Classification and Resources 
 

Resource classification followed the method as described in Section 14.6. In addition, adjustments were 

made to customize the classification to the deposit configuration. 

 

 Both Sections – Classified as indicated and inferred only because no channel samples are 
in the area. 

 

The areas are relatively small. The distance between mine workings on the upper part is only about 

10 meters. The lower part ends just about 15 meters above the mine workings. It is appropriate to call it 

primarily indicated and the rest of the deposit in inferred. No Measured resource has been classified for 

this deposit. 

 

Table 14.77 shows the summary of Measured and Indicated mineral resources for the San Pedro deposit. 

Table 14.78 shows the summary of Inferred mineral resources for the San Pedro deposit.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 157 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

Mining operations are supported by a series of rock mechanics studies and tests. SOP procedures for 

structural mapping, RQD (Rock Quality Data) logging, and RMR (Rock Mass Rating) are currently being 

developed. 

 

This information will contribute to a better understanding of the type of support required in each area, 

such as the use of split set anchoring, rebar, cable bolting, mechanical support, shotcreting, etc. 

 

Table 16.1 shows mine production in 2010 and 2012 at La Negra. It is noticed a 40% increase in the mine 

production between 2010 and 2011 with the improvements in mine infrastructure and acquisition of new 

equipment.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 

17.1 HISTORY OF OPERATIONS 
 

MLN currently operates a conventional milling and floatation plant with a capacity of 2,200 tpd 

producing zinc, lead, and copper concentrates. Original operations started with the 800 tpd plant, 

previously owned by Peñoles, and upgraded by Aurcana to 1,000 tpd in 2007. At that time, La Negra had 

all the required infrastructure for the operation of the plant, including power line, company owned 

housing, water availability, tailings ponds facilities, etc. The plant was formed by a 3-stage crushing plant 

and an 8-foot × 10-foot ball mill plus floatation and cleaning of lead, zinc, and copper cells, concentrate 

drying, and concentrate handling and shipping sections  

 

By June 2010, the expansion to 1,500 tpd had been completed by Aurcana and by April 2012 La Negra 

Mine completed its process plant expansion to 2,200 tpd and currently running at a rate of 2,000 tpd with 

plans for a further expansion to 3,000 tpd by 2013. 

 

17.2 SUMMARY OF CURRENT OPERATIONS AND FLOW SHEET 
 

A summary of current metallurgical operations at La Negra, for information purposes, follows. 

 

Figure 17.1 shows the flow sheet of the current process plant facilities and a generalized list of major 

equipment is included in Table 17.1.

According to the monthly operation reports of MLN, from January to May 2012, approximately 

244,000 tonnes were milled with the production of 1,525 tonnes of lead concentrate, 6,259 tonnes of zinc 

concentrate, and 3,316 tonnes of copper concentrate. Average recoveries for the 5-month period were 

84.86% and 81.0% of silver and lead in lead concentrates, respectively, 74.62% of zinc in zinc 

concentrates, and 70.66% of copper in copper concentrates. These figures are considered to be 

representative of ore produced from the active stopes in different ore bodies throughout the mine, during 

the said period. 

 



Technical Qualifying Report of the La Negra Mine, Querétaro, México

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 161 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

The MLN operation has the required water, energy, and support facilities for the current operation of 

2,000 tpd. MLN is served by a 34.5 kilo volt (kV) line connected to the National Power Grid through a 

115 kV line to the Ezequiel Montes Substation.  

 

17.3 METALLURGICAL RESEARCH 
 

Current metallurgical research at MLN is focused on improving recoveries, quality of concentrates, 

milling and reagent use controls, granulometry control, and ore blending and feeding according to the 

different mine stopes received. 

 

For such purposes, the metallurgical laboratory has carried out the following activities: 

 

 Mineral characterization of concentrates 

 Metallurgical lab testing for the optimization of lead, copper and zinc circuits 

 Research in the use of different collectors in the copper circuit 

 Research in the use of different promoters in the lead, copper and zinc circuits 

 Standardization and plant automation with the installation of Outotec's Courier 
equipment 

 

The presence of bismuth in lead concentrates (over 2% bismuth) is the element with the highest NSR 

penalties. Therefore, the analysis of the source of bismuth, tracing back to the stopes and further 

characterization of the ore is recommended.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

18.1 MINE INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The following industrial infrastructure is currently operational. 

 

 The Company operates a floatation process plant at a rate of 2,000 tpd with the 
production of lead, zinc and copper concentrates. These facilities include crushing, 

milling, floatation, concentrate drying, and concentrate shipping facilities. 

 

 MLN operates five tailings dams, three of which have been closed and reforested 
(Numbers 1, 2, and 3); Site Number 4, is also abandoned and is currently used for 

temporary ore stock or waste material before their final disposal. Tailings of current 

operations of the process plant are pumped to Site Number 5 to be deposited and excess 

water pumped back to the process plant. 

 

 Water for industrial purposes is obtained from the mine underground sources and 
recycled from the tailings dam facilities. 

 

 Water for domestic sources at the company's compounds comes from the Maconí River. 
 

 Electrical power is obtained from CFE's national grid from the Vizarrón sub-station 
through a 34 kilovolt (kV) line to the process plant and mine facilities. Occasionally, 

power is delivered directly from the larger Ezequiel Montes sub-station. Two major 

hydroelectric plants along the Moctezuma River and one combined cycle 340 megawatt 

(MW) power plant at Ezequiel Montes. 

 

The Company operates a floatation process plant with the production of lead, zinc, and copper 

concentrates. The facilities include crushing, milling, floatation, concentrate drying, and concentrate 

shipping facilities. 

 

Figure 18.1 shows access road and the location of the main haulage adit (2000 level), process plant,

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 164 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

The mine has access from the state capital city of Querétaro through a paved road to the town of Maconí. 

The last stretch to the plant site is managed on a well maintained year-round 4 km long, gravel road. 

Although it narrows to one lane locally, it can handle the introduction of all heavy equipment, like the 

new mill and recent expansion parts. 

 

The following industrial infrastructure is currently operational. 

 

18.2 WATER INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

Water for industrial purposes is obtained from underground mine sources and recycled from the tailings 

dam facilities. Approximately 32,000 cubic meters of fresh water and 129,000 cubic meters of recovered 

water were used in the process during the month of July 2012. Approximately 80% of the water used in 

the process is recovered from tailings pond No. 5. Water usage has increased significantly from the first 

quarter 2012 having increased the production from approximately 1,500 tpd to 2,300 tpd. 

 

Figure 18.2 shows the distribution of water lines from tailings pond No. 5 (to the right) and from the San 

Nicolás pumping station to the south. Water for domestic sources at the Company's compounds comes 

from the Maconí River.

18.3 TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITIES 
 

MLN operates 5 tailings dams, 3 of which have been closed and reforested (UNAM, 2011) (Nos. 1, 2, and 

3). 

 

 Site No. 1 is currently used for the maintenance and scrap deposit, diesel tanks, core 
house, and temporary storage for hazardous wastes. 

 

 Site No. 3 is currently used as emergency pond for possible spills and is provided with a 
pumping system to recover any water leakages and re-pump to the process plant. 

 

 Site No. 4, located above the process plant level, is also abandoned and is currently used 
for temporary ore stock or waste material before their final disposal. Part of the area is 

being adapted to build a sports unit that will include a soccer football stadium that will be 

given to the community. 

 

 Tailings of current operations of the process plant are pumped to Site No. 5 to be 
deposited and excess water pumped back to the process plant. 

 

TSF No. 5 is being constructed with the "upstream" method, as shown in Figure 18.3. In this method, 

cycloned coarse sand is deposited in the curtain of the dam and fine material is settled in the upper part 

where clarified water forms a pond and water is pumped back to the plant. The construction and operation 

of these facilities follows current regulations for the construction and operation of tailings dams (NOM-

141-SEMARNAT-2003). 

 

 
 

Figure 18.3. TSF construction method 
 (MLN, 2011) 
 

MLN has carried out stability analyses of tailings dam No. 5 through the National University and 

specialized local consultants.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 167 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

It is estimated that tailings pond No. 5 will have a final capacity in the order of 1.8 million cubic meters
 

through a 6-year life to the year 2018. 

 

18.4 POWER INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The Maconí-San Joaquín Region is served by a 34.5 kV line departing from CFE's Vizarrón substation, 

which in turn is connected to the National Power Grid through a115 kV line to the Ezequiel Montes 

substation to the 610 megawatt (mW) combined cycle power plant at El Sáuz and to the 292 mW 

Zimapán hydroelectric plant along the Moctezuma River. Electrical power is transformed at the 

Company's substation to 6.9 kV to be distributed to the process plant and mine facilities at 440 voltage.

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 

20.1 ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND ACTIVITIES 
 

Environmental activities and permitting are carried out at La Negra in order to comply with existing 

regulations with particular emphasis in the areas of TFS operations and management and handling of 

hazardous materials including mitigation of environmental impacts and risks and monitoring of sources of 

pollution (atmosphere, soil, sub-soil, and water) as well as training of local personnel in order to comply 

with existing regulations and requirements from the environmental authorities. 

 

Current active programs are: 

 

 Reforestation Program 

 MLN operates 5 tailings dams, 3 of which have been closed and reforested 
(Nos. 1, 2, and 3). 

 Flora and Fauna Studies: Among these activities, a study of endemic 
vegetation in the mine area was carried out in order to be used in the 

Reclamation Program of the Tailings Dam No. 5, as required by the 

authorities (UNAM, 2011). 

 Installation and operation of bio-enzime septic tanks to treat sewage and 
dispose of treated waters conforming to NOM-003-SEMARNAT-2003. 

 

 Tailings Dams (Figure 20.1): 

 MLN operates 5 tailings dams, 3 of which have been closed and reforested 
(Nos. 1, 2, and 3): 

 Site No.1 is currently used for the maintenance and scrap deposit, diesel 
tanks, core house, and temporary storage for hazardous wastes. 

 Site No. 3 is currently used as emergency pond for possible spills and is 
provided with a pumping system to recover any water leakages and re-

pump to the process plant. 

 Site No. 4, located above the process plant level, is also abandoned and 
is currently used for temporary ore stock or waste material before their 

final disposal. Part of the area is being adapted to build a sports unit that 

will include a soccer football stadium that will be given to the 

community. 

 Tailings of current operations of the process plant are pumped to Site 
No. 5 to be deposited and excess water pumped back to the process plant.

October 2012     

 

 

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 174 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

According to current environmental legislation in México, closure and reclamation plans have to be filed 

in Semarnat before the projected closure of operations. These documents have to include a Closure Plan 

and Program, Reclamation Plan and Program, Post Closure Plan and Program with an estimate of costs. A 

Reclamation Bond may be requested by the authorities. 

 

MLN has informed the authors that the La Negra operation are normal and comply with all required 

permits, and copies of corresponding documents are kept in the MLN files and available in case they are 

required. 

 

Based on the information shown and provided by MLN to the authors, and considering that operations are 

continuous and normal, there is no reason to believe that major risks and/or possible disruptions on the 

production at La Negra, derived of permitting failures, may occur. A close follow-up of all permits and 

on-going environmental monitoring is required to prevent any negative impacts on the operation. 

 

20.3 SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY IMPACT AND ACTIVITIES 
 

The resumption of mining activities by Aurcana in 2006 has resulted in a positive impact to the 

community with the reactivation of economic activities in Maconí and the region. This impact extends to 

Maconí's 22 municipal delegations with the creation of 360 direct jobs and more than 1,400 indirect jobs. 

 

MLN's current approach is that of a "Sustainable Development" with the purpose of "satisfying the needs 

of current generations without compromising the possibilities of future generations to fulfill their needs." 

 

MLN has contributed to the development of local infrastructure and activities of social benefit. Some of 

the most relevant programs carried out by MLN in the region are: 

 

 Paving of the 14 km access road from the San Joaquín junction to Maconí 

 Installation of a new water pipe system to the La Blanca, El Huizache, and Cerro 
Colorado communities 

 Support to the electrical power services by CFE to the El Mortero and adjacent 
communities 

 Support to the community to obtain the services from State and Federal organizations, 
such as CFE, STPS, IMSS, and SEDESOL 

 Rehabilitation of IMSS Clinic No. 66 at Maconí 

 Maintenance and support of the local church 

 Maintenance of the local auditorium 

 Maintenance and support of the local primary school 

 Support to the paving of the access road to La Blanca 
 

Based on this information and the site visits made to the area by one of the authors, the author believes 

that major risks and/or possible disruptions on the production at La Negra because of social problems are 

not likely to occur.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

La Negra is a mining operation that has been in production for most of the last 40 years. The mine has 

produced almost 9.0 Mt of silver, lead, copper, and zinc ore from a series of skarn deposits in a number of 

manto, chimney vein, and breccia deposits. 

 

More than 20 different deposits have been discovered at La Negra and some of them coalesce to form 

individual bodies. Mantoes and chimneys have comprised the bulk of silver, lead, zinc, and copper 

mineralization. The authors suggest that the exploration potential at MLN is good. Exploration at La 

Negra, as carried out by Peñoles and currently by Aurcana has replaced and increased resources and 

reserves. 

 

Resource estimates on thirteen of the deposits are presented in this technical report that result in 

substantially higher resource than previously available. Previous resource estimates covered fewer of the 

deposits and were limited in depth. The current understanding of the extent of the deposits includes 

extensions of the areas to depths where drilling shows vertical continuity and mineralization. 

 

Table 25.1 summarizes the Measured and Indicated Resources for all deposits and all blocks with a 

minimum recovered value of US$40 per tonne.

Project 12-064 (NI 43-101) 181 BEHRE DOLBEAR 

La Negra shows important mineralization potential at depth and additional exploration is required for 

further development of resources and reserves. The expansion of resources and reserves in this type of 

deposit requires continuing direct exploration by underground core drilling and channel sampling in cross 

cuts, drifts, and development workings. 

 

MLN follows Industry Standards for exploration, drilling, sampling, assaying, and QAQC procedures that 

produce reliable information for the estimate of Mineral Resources.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The following recommendations are made: 

 

 Increase accuracy in the location and mapping of samples, sample collection, sample 
numbering and sample control format to eliminate duplicate sample numbers. 

 

 When channel samples are collected, include geological information in the database. 
 

 Take special care when drilling broken ore contacts and mineralized zones. Additional 
training for the drillers may be necessary to achieve higher core recoveries. 
 

 Obtain blanks from specialized labs and in the meantime acquire high purity silica sand 
to use as a blank. 
 

 Purchase standard samples from a specialized lab, and have the standards prepared with 
La Negra material at different head grades. 
 

 Transfer analyses stored in the AA equipment directly to the assay database to avoid 
time-consuming digitizing and potential human errors. 
 

 Continue current metallurgical research. The presence of bismuth in lead concentrates 
(over 2% bismuth) is the element with the highest NSR penalties. Therefore, the analysis 

of the source of bismuth, tracing back to the stopes and further characterization of the ore 

is recommended. 
 

 Continue an aggressive underground exploration program for efficient production 
planning and expansion of the resource and reserve estimates. 
 

 Refine definition of the mineralized zones as needed when additional information is 
collected. 
 

 Provide Surpac training to employees related to resource and reserve estimation, and 
mine planning and scheduling.
