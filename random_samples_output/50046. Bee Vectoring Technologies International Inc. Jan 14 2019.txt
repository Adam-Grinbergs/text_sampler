Bee Vectoring Technologies Completes Submission of 

Additional Safety Study for Regulatory Approval Process 

with US Environmental Protection Agency  
 

Mississauga, ON Canada (January 14, 2019) â€“ Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. 

("BVT") (TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) announced today that it has submitted results from the US 

Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) requested honey bee larval safety study along with a weight of 

evidence document in support of its regulatory approval process with the EPA. 

The regulatory approval review process includes performing a risk assessment of the technology by the 

EPA.  This includes looking at the exposure risk to workers and the environment, including bees, along 

with any potential toxicity.  Since this is the first time a product that is being applied by bees is being 

evaluated by the EPA, BVT provided additional information in the form of a "weight of evidence" 

document discussing in particular the exposure risk to honey bee brood to help in EPA's review of the 

regulatory submission. 

"BVT has a unique system which means we are similarly a unique file with the EPA," said Ashish Malik, 

BVT CEO. "The report and analysis of the larval study, and the supporting material were very detailed 

and comprehensive.  Over 800 pages of material in support of the approval process were provided to the 

agency as part of this submission.  We are pleased to be pioneering new science and introducing 

innovative crop protection alternatives to EPA for their review and consideration."
