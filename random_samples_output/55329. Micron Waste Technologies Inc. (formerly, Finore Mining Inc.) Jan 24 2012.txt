1.  SUMMARY 
 
 
Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") has prepared this report for Finore Mining 
Inc. ("Finore") in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") 
standards for disclosure for mineral projects.  Finore, formerly known as Otterburn Ventures 
Inc., had entered into an Option and Joint Venture agreement with Nortec Minerals Corp. to 
acquire the Läntinen Koillismaa ("LK") Project comprising the Kaukua, Haukiaho, Haukiaho 
East, Lipeävaara, and Murtolampi Claim Areas, Finland.  This report is an update of the 
"Technical Review of Kaukua, Haukiaho, Lipeävaara, and Murtolampi Claim Areas, 
Finland" report ("Initial Report") originally prepared by WGM for Nortec Minerals Corp. 
("Nortec") dated March 14, 2011.  The Initial Report presented Mineral Resources of the 
Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits following the guidelines, standards and definitions adopted by 
the Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM").  These 
mineral resources have been updated to reflect current metal prices.  WGM understands that 
Finore's intended use of this report includes filing with securities regulators to support public 
disclosure, pursuant to Canadian provincial securities legislation, and, where required to 
comply with Finore's Finnish reporting obligations including disclosure on SEDAR and, if 
Finore chooses to do so, to support the requirements of the multiple listing applications of 
Finore to other stock exchanges, in addition to its current listing on Canadian National Stock 
Exchange ("CNSX"). 
 
Finore's Kaukua Property consists of three contiguous mineral claims, covering a total of 
262.67 ha, and the Haukiaho Property has four contiguous mineral claims covering 372.34 ha.  
Applications for a further 3,150 ha have been submitted to the Ministry of Employment and 
the Economy of Finland, and are waiting to be registered.  These claims and claim 
applications cover extensions of the existing mineral claims and an intermediate contiguous 
area, known as Haukiaho East and Lipeävaara. 
 
The Finore properties are hosted by the Koillismaa Layered Igneous Complex ("KLIC"), 
which is one of the 2.5-2.4 Ga Fennoscandian Early Palaeoproterozoic layered complexes that 
were emplaced as part of a globally recognized episode of igneous activity that introduced 
layered intrusions and mafic dyke swarms worldwide.  These igneous formations have a 
demonstrated high potential for Cr, Cu-Ni-PGE sulphide, PGE and Fe-Ti-V oxide 
mineralization, such as the well-known economic deposits hosted by the South-African 
Bushveld, Russian Monchegorsk and Finnish Tornio-Näränkävaara belt of intrusions. 
 



   

- 2 - 

The KLIC makes up the eastern most portion of the Tornio-Näränkävaara Belt and consists of 
two main sectors, the Näränkävaara Intrusion in the east and the Western Intrusion to the 
west.   
 
The Western Intrusion has been uplifted and broken into a number of blocks due to 
multiphase tectonic events.  Finore's five targets (Kaukua, Haukiaho, Haukiaho East, 
Murtolampi, and Lipeävaara) are hosted by four separate intrusive blocks covering an area of 
15 x15 km2 within the northernmost part of the Western Intrusion.   
 
The igneous stratigraphy is identical in each block, consisting of a Marginal Series, which are 
tens to over hundred metres thick developed at the base or margins of the blocks, and an 
overlying Layered Series.  The marginal series is characterized by a reversed fractionation 
trend, in which mafic lithologies at the very contact of the intrusions are succeeded by 
pyroxenitic and then by olivine bearing lithologies.  This is contrary to that of the layered 
series, which is entirely composed of mafic cumulates having normal fractionation trend from 
basal gabbronorites to anorthosites at the top. 
 
Most of the observed mineralization is typical of 'contact-type' PGE-Cu-Ni mineralization 
hosted by the marginal series.  Four principal types of base metal - PGE mineralization have 
been identified within the Kaukua block.  The available data from Haukiaho, Haukiaho East, 
Lipeävaara and Murtolampi indicates that only mineralization of types 2-4 are present, but not 
the first type: 
 
1) Hangingwall-type Mineralization (contact-type). 
2) Marginal Series-type Mineralization (contact-type).   
3) Mixed Zone-type Mineralization (contact-type). 
4) Reef-type Mineralization. 
 
The Hangingwall-type mineralization is hosted in strongly foliated gabbronorite of the layered 
series just above the marginal series at Kaukua.   
 
Marginal Series-type mineralization makes up over 70% of the metal deposition at Kaukua.  
The Marginal Series is dominated by pyroxenite that hosts sulphide assemblages comprised of 
pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite.  The sulphide assemblage also occurs as medium-grained, 
disseminated aggregations.  Sulphide content increases towards the base of the Marginal 
Series, which often indicates an increase in grade for both PGE and base metals. 
 
Sulphide mineralization in the Mixed Zone-type at Kaukua varies in thickness between 30 and 
40 metres.  The Mixed Zone is dominated by xenoliths of granodiorite and quartzo-



   

- 3 - 

feldspathic gneisses partially assimilated by the Marginal Series.  Sulphides usually occur as 
fine-medium grained chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite disseminations in the basement unit and in 
cross-cutting gabbroic-pyroxenitic intrusives.  Pyrite is also present. 
 
The typical sulphide assemblage is pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite, and accessory 
sulphides include pyrite, sphalerite, galena and molybdenite.  The main oxides are magnetite 
and ilmenite, with chromite present in trace amounts.  The grades of PGE mineralization 
correlate roughly with the abundance of sulphides, particularly chalcopyrite.  SEM-EDS 
studies reveal that most of the platinum-group minerals ("PGM") are arsenides, 
bismutotellurides, and arsenoantimonides.  PGM are included in base metal sulphides, 
magnetite, and silicates and also occur along gangue mineral grain boundaries. 
 
Finore's Joint Venture partner Nortec's exploration work over the past four years has been 
concentrated on the Kaukua target where they have completed about 10,000 m of drilling to 
date.  The Haukiaho property has been subjected to exploration several times in history but no 
field work has been completed by Nortec to date.  Historically, geophysical exploration at 
Kaukua and Haukiaho has consisted primarily of various IP and magnetic surveys, which has 
served to outline the magnetic phases of the KLIC and the typically disseminated Cu-Ni-PGE 
sulphide mineralization. 
 
As part of Nortec's exploration efforts, a leading-edge 3D IP survey was carried out for 
Nortec by SJ Geophysics on the Kaukua property.  The preliminary analysis presented by the 
contractor indicates an anomalous chargeability source accompanied by lower resistivity that 
is associated with the known mineralization.  However, this interpretation should be carefully 
assessed by additional processing and analysis of the actual chargeability and resistivity data. 
 
It was WGM's judgement that sufficient exploration work including drilling with data of 
sufficient quality along with metallurgical testwork had been compiled on these properties to 
warrant the preparation of a Mineral Resource Estimate for both the Kaukua and Haukiaho 
properties.   
 
Historic drilling on the Haukiaho East claim area suggests similar style mineralization extents 
there from the adjacent Haukiaho claim area.  Work to date, on the other claims is limited to 
only a few historic drill holes, sufficient only to verify the existence of mineralised lithologies 
similar to Kaukua and Haukiaho.

Mineral Resources 
Kaukua 
The mineral resource estimate for the Kaukua deposit is tabulated below.  Ordinary Kriging 
was used to estimate the resources in the Kaukua deposit.  Due to the presence of several 
metals contributing to the value of the deposit, a contained metal value approach was used to 
define the lower cutoff.  The lower cutoff of C$50/tonne was used.

Haukiaho 
The mineral resource estimate for the Haukiaho deposit is tabulated below.  An inverse 
distance squared ("ID") method was used to estimate the resources in the Haukiaho deposit.  
Due to the presence of several metals contributing to the value of the deposit, a contained 
metal value approach was used to define the lower cutoff.  The lower cutoff of C$50/tonne 
was used.  The resource is categorized as an inferred resource.

Metallurgical Testwork 
The PGE enriched Cu-Ni sulphide deposits at Haukiaho and Kaukua are believed to host 
similar styles of mineralization.  Preliminary metallurgical work was carried out on the 
Haukiaho deposit by North Atlantic Natural Resources Ab in 2001 on material consisting of 
surface boulder samples.  The results were similar to the more comprehensive mineralogy and 
metallurgical tests carried out on core samples from the Kaukua deposit in 2009 and 2010.  As 



   

- 5 - 

the surface sample material used in the Haukiaho tests cannot be regarded as representative of 
the deposit it has only been acknowledged in this report and will have to be confirmed when 
testwork can be carried out on core material from the mineralized zones.   
 
The results from the Kaukua mineralogical studies and the bench scale test work indicate that 
the nickel, copper and PGE can be concentrated with bulk sulphide flotation when the 
material is ground to 80% passing 75 microns with indicated recoveries of 86 to 89% Cu, 
35-37% nickel, 44-50% Pt, 68-69% Pd, and 70-76% Au.  The nickel recovery closely tracked 
the nickel mineralization associated with sulphides, with the silicates and other nickel species 
lost to tailings.  Recognized variations in the style of mineralization were tested in four 
separate types of mineralization with a main composite combined in the estimated proportion 
of each type, being used for most of the test work.  The concentrate produced graded in the 
order of 16 to 17% for combined Cu and Ni.  Attempts to produce separate copper and nickel 
concentrates were not successful.  Preliminary work was carried out on treating the bulk 
concentrate by hydrometallurgy as an option to marketing the concentrate to a smelter, 
appearing to be the most viable option.   
 
Exploration Potential 
The Koillismaa complex has an estimated magma volume greater than 2,000 km3.  These 
volumes of basic magma provide large reservoirs of metals for ore forming processes and the 
Fennoscandian complexes are host to a number of known deposits, chrome (Kemi), Fe-Ti-V 
oxides (Mustavaara) and Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides (Monchegorsk).  The contact-type base metal 
– platinum-group element mineralization hosted by the Koillismaa Complex represents 
significant potential for deposition of metals.  Finore's properties cover about 26 km of the 
estimated 100 km total strike length of the zone which varies in thickness from metres to 
several tens of metres. 
 
Mineralization in the contact-type deposits is particularly concentrated in structural positions, 
where the PGE-reef comes in contact with the marginal series due to angular discordance 
between marginal and layered series units.  This kind of structural relationship is found in the 
northern Kaukua Block.  Higher than average PGE tenor and frequent PGE enriched pockets 
have been encountered at Kaukua.  The PGE reef encountered in Finore's Haukiaho claim has 
also been interpreted to have a similar structural setting which is supported by the relatively 
higher metal tenor in historic drilling. 
 
WGM recommends that Finore continues its exploration program to upgrade the quality and 
quantity of the mineral resources at Kaukua and Haukiaho.  Further compilation and review of 
all the existing data, including analytical and metallurgical test work will help to focus future 
exploration.  Metallurgical work should also be extended to further investigate maximizing

the recovery of the PGE as well as Ni and Cu.  This should go hand in hand with the selection 
and utilization of the most appropriate assay techniques to measure recoverable metals.  
Exploration to test the potential of the Lipeävaara, Murtolampi and especially Haukiaho East 
targets is also warranted. 
 
More generally, quantitative interpretation of the prior geophysical surveys should be 
undertaken incorporating physical property data.  In addition, the data from prior airborne 
magnetic and AEM surveys flown by GTK and other parties should be re-assessed to 
complement and assist exploration outside the known mineralized areas. 
 
Given the extensive strike length (~100 km) of the favourable host for potential contact-type 
PGE-Au-Cu-Ni mineralization in the Koillismaa Complex as well as the Complex's potential 
to host reef type PGE deposits and chrome deposits, WGM encourages Finore to also explore 
for other potential mineralized areas within the Complex blocks, including possible associated 
gold mineralization in the underlying metasomatized rocks. 
 
Recommended Budget 
Following two stage exploration schema has been suggested to fulfill Finore's commitments 
to earn 49% interest of the Project by the Second anniversary of the Option and Joint Venture 
Agreement with Nortec Minerals Corp. Based on this schema Finore has contracted 10,000 m 
drilling program and started its execution in Haukiaho target on November, 2011.

2.  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
 
2.1  INTRODUCTION 
 
This report has been prepared for Finore Mining Inc. ("Finore") in compliance with Canadian 
National Instrument 43 101 ("NI 43-101") standards for disclosure for mineral projects.  This 
report updates the "Technical Review of Kaukua, Haukiaho, Lipeävaara, and Murtolampi 
Claim Areas, Finland" initially ("Initial Report") prepared for Finore's Joint Venture partner 
Nortec Minerals Corp. ("Nortec") and dated March 14, 2011.  Subsequent to that date on 
August 30th Nortec had entered into Option and Joint Venture Agreement with Otterburn 
Ventures Inc., who on September 27th completed its name change to Finore Mining Inc. The 
Initial Report presented estimated Mineral Resources of the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits, 
following the guidelines, standards and definitions adopted by the Council of the Canadian 
Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM").  The mineral resources were adjusted 
to reflect changes in metal prices since the preparation of the original mineral resource.  These 
deposits form part of the Finore's Läntinen Koillismaa ("LK") Project.  Finore's intended use 
of this report includes filing with securities regulators to support public disclosure, pursuant to 
Canadian provincial securities legislation, and, where required to comply with Finore's 
Finnish reporting obligations including disclosure on SEDAR and, if Finore chooses to do so, 
to support the requirements of the multiple listing applications of Finore to other stock 
exchanges, in addition to its current listing on Canadian National Stock Exchange ("CNSX"). 
 
The Initial Report and this independent report is prepared by Dr. Markku Iljina (EurGeol), 
Clifford J. Duke, P.Eng, Ross MacFarlane, P.Eng, and reviewed by Joe Hinzer, P.Geo., all 
Qualified Persons as defined by the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and the companion 
policy 43-101CP. 
 
2.2  TERMS OF REFERENCE

4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
 
4.1  LOCATION 
 
The LK Project is situated in north central Finland approximately 60 km north of the 
company's exploration office in the village of Taivalkoski.  The property is 130 km east-
southeast of Rovaniemi and 160 km north-east of the port town of Oulu.  The central point of 
the LK Project is located at longitude 28°10'29.13"E; latitude 65°56'46.36"N (Figure 1). 
 
4.2  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
 
Finore's Kaukua Property consists of three contiguous mineral claims, covering a total of 
262.67 ha, and the Haukiaho Property has four contiguous mineral claims covering 372.34 ha 
(Table 1 and Figure 2).  The original acquisition of the claims was made by Akkerman 
Exploration bv ("AEbv") by map-staking.  Applications for a further 3,150 ha have been 
submitted since that by Nortec to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy of Finland 
("TEM"), and are waiting to be registered (Table 2, and Figure 2).  None of the claims or 
claim applications are adjacent to nature conservation areas, with the closest being Kaukua 
North 3, which is 1.8 km from a Natura 2000 program area.   
 
WGM has checked information sources provided by the Ministry of Employment and the 
Economy of Finland that show the claims have been granted and claim applications registered 
on those dates indicated in Tables 1 and 2.  While WGM has no reason to doubt the claim 
validity WGM has not and is not qualified to conduct legal title searches.

There is no requirement to legally survey the boundaries of claims or claim applications in 
Finland; instead they are assigned Finnish coordinates by the Registry authority. 
 
There is an old 1960s Outokumpu Oy ("Outokumpu") test mine pit at Haukiaho.  The ore 
was brought to a concentrator located 7 km to the south.  There are also several trenches made 
by the same company (c.1960-1990) on Finore's property.  Many of these have been 
reclaimed.  The now closed, fresh water canal, for the Mustavaara Fe-Ti-V mine (Figure 3) 
runs through Finore's property.  Investigations to re-open the Mustavaara mine are currently 
taken by Mustavaaran kaivos Oy.  In the Environmental Impact Assessment 
(ympäristövaikutusten arviointimenettely, YVA) the process water intake for the Mustavaara 
mine is from the River Sirniönjoki, which runs through Finore's Haukiaho East property.  The 
water intake is upstream from Haukiaho East.  WGM is not aware of any environmental 
liabilities associated with the project. 
 
There are three types of licenses necessary to bring a mine from exploration to production in 
Finland.  These are: mining permit, environmental permits (for rights to water supply and 
waste management), and building permits (for project infrastructure).  In addition to these a 
number of other permits are necessary before the start of mining operations. 
 
4.3  OPTION AND JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS 
 
The following Option and Joint Venture agreements, in chronological order, are documented 
by Finore for their properties: 
 
1. Earn-in agreements between Nortec Ventures Corp. and Akkerman Exploration bv 

(Kaukua property) dated on July 26, 2007, and July 29, 2008. 
2. Sale and purchase agreement between Nortec Ventures Corp. and Kylylahti Copper oy 

(Vulcan Resources Ltd) dated on October 7, 2009. 
3. Option and Joint Venture Agreement between Nortec Minerals Corp. and Otterburn 

Ventures Inc. dated August 24th, 2011. 
 
Subsequent to these agreements Nortec Ventures Corp. has changed its name to Nortec 
Minerals Corp. and Otterburn Ventures Inc. to Finore Mining Inc. Since agreement 2, Vulcan 
Resources ltd has merged with Universal Resources ltd. 
 
While WGM has no reason to doubt validity of information on Option and Joint Venture 
agreements provided by the Finore WGM has not and is not qualified to conduct legal search 
of agreements.

4.3.1  EARN-IN AGREEMENT BETWEEN NORTEC VENTURES CORP. AND 
AKKERMAN EXPLORATION BV (KAUKUA PROPERTY) 

 
In a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") dated July 26, 2007 between Akkerman 
Exploration bv ("AEbv") and Nortec Ventures Corp. (later Nortec Minerals Corp.) as 
amended October 26, 2007, January 29, 2008, March 26, 2008 and May 28, 2008, AEbv 
granted Nortec the exclusive right to enter into an Option Agreement ("Kaukua OA") dated 
July 29, 2008 pursuant to which Nortec has the option to earn a seventy percent (70%) 
participation interest in the Kaukua Property.  As part of the MOU, Nortec had to incur Initial 
Exploration Expenditures (the "Minimum Expenditure") of €150,000 on or before 
July 29, 2008 and to earn its 70% interest in the Kaukua property it must incur a further 
€450,000 in exploration expenditures, for a total of €600,000, before July 29, 2011.  WGM 
understands that all these payments have been made. 
 
In addition to incurring the above Initial Exploration Expenditures, Nortec will pay AEbv 
each of the following option premium amounts during the Earn in Period: 
 
i. within 15 days from the date the Licences were issued: €30,000 in cash;  
ii. within 15 days from the first anniversary of the MOU Date: €60,000; and,  
iii. On or before the second anniversary of the MOU Date: €100,000. 
 
Nortec completed the Initial Exploration Expenditures before the second anniversary of the 
MOU date, and therefore was not required to make the second Annual Payment. 
 
In the event that Nortec completes a Bankable Feasibility Study or incurs additional 
Exploration Expenditures in the amount of €2,500,000, within the three year period, Nortec 
will be deemed to hold a 80% Participation Interest and AEbv will be deemed to hold the 
remaining 20% Participation Interest.  There was no net smelter return ("NSR") royalty fee 
included in this agreement. 
 
On September 2009, Nortec signed an addendum to the current Kaukua OA with AEbv.  The 
addendum stipulated that AEbv will transfer all of its remaining equity interest to Nortec, 
whereby the Company will obtain the full and undivided 100% ownership and control of the 
Kaukua Project in exchange for the additional 20% ownership.  AEbv was granted a 2% Net 
Smelter Royalty ("NSR") on any future production from the property and retains the pending 
value added tax ("VAT") refunds applied by AEbv on VAT paid by Nortec on the 
expenditures incurred on the Property since 2007.  Nortec has the option to purchase 1% of 
the NSR from AEbv for €1 million.   
 



   

- 17 - 

By the end of August 2009, Nortec had incurred over C$3 million in exploration expenses on 
the Kaukua Property.  This equated to an earn-in interest for Nortec of 74.2% and a holding 
interest for AEbv of 25.8%. 
 
Based on the encouraging results from the Kaukua Main Zone, Nortec decided to proceed 
with the full 100% acquisition of the Kaukua Property.  The 100% interest in the Kaukua 
Property has now been transferred to the Finland registered company, Nortec Minerals Oy, 
which is a 100%-owned subsidiary of Nortec Minerals Corp.

4.4  FINNISH MINING ACT 
 
New Mining Act, in power since 1st of July, 2011, defines 'Exploration Permit' 
(malmietsintälupa) and 'Mining Permit' (kaivoslupa).  Prior to acquiring an Exploration 
Permit a company can do a 'Reservation notification' (varausilmoitus) and can be granted the 
Reservation Decision (varauspäätös).  The Reservation Decision gives a priority right to the 
company to apply for an Exploration Permit.  Reservation Decisions also allow the company 
to conduct diamond drilling and light exploration field work with the landowner's prior 
consent.  The fees of the Exploration Permit include EUR 20/hectare/year (for the first four 
years) for the compensation to landowner, and collateral to State, the amount of which will be 
decided by the Registry authority.  The Exploration Permit gives to company the full rights to 
do heavier exploration work including test mining and construction of temporary roads and 
buildings if so permitted in the Exploration Permit granted by the Registry authority. 



   

- 19 - 

 
The new Mining Act will not apply to existing claims.  However, the Act will affect new 
Exploration Permits, which have been applied for, but not granted before by the effective date 
of the new Act.  Claims will be granted compliant to old Act in all other respects but the EUR 
20/hectare/year compensation to landowner is applied while the claim fee defined by the old 
Act and paid to the State would be abolished.  No collateral is required for Exploration 
permits applied prior to effective date of the new Act.

5.  ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1  ACCESS 
 
The Kaukua, Haukiaho, Haukiaho east, Lipeävaara, and Murtolampi claim areas are located 
in the municipality of Posio, Finland between the municipal centers of Posio and Taivalkoski 
(see Figure 1).  There are a public main and by-roads crossing or touching all targets and 
access roads reach many corners of the property.  Public roads are kept open all year round 
and the forest roads are maintained only during periodic logging activities.  The main road 
between Posio and Taivalkoski is paved. 
 
5.2  CLIMATE 
 
Weather conditions are characteristic of the northern Fennoscandian climate with temperate 
summers and cold winters.  During the summer months (June-August), temperatures range 
from 10ºC to 25ºC, and during the winter months (November-April) between -5ºC to -30ºC.  
The terrain is snow covered (0.6 to 1.2 m) in winters and bogs, lakes and rivers freeze every 
year for 4 to 5 months.  The annual rainfall is 550 mm, distributed evenly throughout the year.  
Weather conditions do not interfere with open pit or underground mining anywhere in 
Finland.  Water is plentiful around the properties, but permission must be obtained to use it. 
 
5.3  LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The nearest major city is Oulu (some 150,00 inhabitants), which is about 200 km away, and 
the towns of Rovaniemi and Kuusamo are located about 150 and 100 km from the claim 
areas, respectively.  All these three centers have airports with daily scheduled flights to 
Helsinki, capital of Finland.  The nearest major railway station is located in Rovaniemi.  High 
voltage power line (110 kV) crosses the Haukiaho and Lipeävaara groups of claims and runs 
4.5 km on the western side of the Kaukua mineralized body. 
 
Region has mining heritage as the Mustavaara Fe-Ti-V mine (Figure 3) was running in 1974-
1985.  This mining generated mining related metal workshops the Telatek oy's factory being 
the flagship among these.  Telatek oy is a producer of installation, maintenance, quality 
control and workshop services. 
 



   

- 21 - 

5.4  PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Haukiaho and Haukiaho east claim areas are mainly flat, boggy land, approximately 
240 m asl, and are best accessible using crawler vehicles/forest tractor, Taivalkoski-Posio 
mainroad crosses the property along the border between claims Haukiaho 11 and Haukiaho 
east 1.  The rivers Suojoki, Haukijoki and Löytöjoki crossing the claim area are rather wide 
and difficult to cross using vehicles even during the winters.  However, the various parts of 
the claim areas are easily accessible by access tracks and nearby forest roads. 
 
The Kaukua claim area is hilly about 200-260 m (asl) and partially crossed by an 
approximately 700 m long, glaciofluvial erosional channel with steep walls 35 m high and a 
pond in the depression.  The terrain on either side of the channel is easily accessible by 
crawler vehicles/forest tractors.  Eastern Kaukua and the Murtolampi claims areas are flat 
forests while large portions of western Kaukua and Lipeävaara claim areas are covered by 
lakes. 
 
Vegetation is typical of the pine-tree dominated Fennoscandian coniferous forest belt.  Spruce 
and birch are present in smaller amounts.  The forest ground is covered by thin moss while the 
bogs are covered by a layer of peat. 
 
5.5.  LAND USE FORMS IN THE PROPERTIES 
 
The great majority the property areas is in uninhabited forest subjected to logging from time 
to time.  The Haukiaho and Haukiaho east Targets are wholly devoid of habitation.  Some 
agriculture is taking place in all other target areas except Haukiaho.

6.  HISTORY 
 
 
This Section describes the exploration activities undertaken prior to acquisition of the 
properties by Finore's Joint Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp. in 2007. 
 
Copper and nickel showings hosted by the marginal series of the Western Intrusion of the 
Koillismaa Layered Igneous Complex were first documented by the Geological Survey and 
Outokumpu Oy in the early 1960s.  The latter also carried out an extensive drilling campaign.  
This drilling campaign consisted of 75 holes and provided about 12 km of core.  Thirty three 
of these holes were drilled on Nortec's Haukiaho and Haukiaho east properties where a small 
scale test mining operation was also undertaken.  The original exploration carried out by 
Outokumpu Oy located sulphides in the Haukiaho, Haukiaho east and Lipeävaara areas.  
However, the first outcrop observations of PGE enriched sulphides from the Kaukua and 
Murtolampi areas were not discovered until the late 1980s by Outokumpu. 
 
Exploration in the 1960s concentrated exclusively on copper and nickel.  PGE-focused 
exploration started in the early 1980s, when highly anomalous PGE-enriched boulder samples 
(PGE+Au >10 ppm) were reported from the Haukiaho area.  This was followed by detailed 
mapping, surface sampling and geophysical surveys, but no further drilling. 
 
Outokumpu's completed a historical mineral resource in 1983, based on resampling of old 
drill core (Lahtinen 1983 and 1985).  The estimate for Haukiaho to the depth of 100 m was 
7.0 million tonnes @ 0.24% Ni, 0.38 Cu, 0.6 g Pd/t, 0.2 Pt and 0.2 Au using a cutoff grade of 
0.7 wt% (Cu+2*Ni).  This resource was made up of nine separate ore bodies ranging 
0.2-2.3 million tonnes in size.  These resources are historical in nature, not compliant 
with NI 43-101 and have not been reviewed by WGM and should not be relied upon. 
 
In 1996, GTK started an extensive research and exploration program of the entire Koillismaa 
Complex.  In the course of this program, drilling extended onto every one of the current 
Finore properties. 
 
In 2000, the Swedish junior exploration company North Atlantic Natural Resources AB 
("NAN") signed a contract with GTK and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (predecessor of 
TEM) of Finland ("KTM") optioning the claims.  NAN conducted geophysical ground 
surveys on Nortec's present Haukiaho, Murtolampi, and Kaukua claim areas, but only drilled 
the Haukuaho area.  Fugro Ltd flew a low-altitude aerial geophysical survey covering the area 
of Haukiaho, Haukiaho east, Lipeävaara and Kaukua.  NAN also sent a 50 kg sample of 



   

- 23 - 

Haukiaho ore (surface boulders) for metallurgical tests to Lakefield Research Ltd in Canada 
before withdrawing from Koillismaa project in late 2002. 
 
Detailed magnetic surveys have outlined the principal segments or blocks of this portion of 
the basal KLIC, and helped determine probable continuity and discontinuities.  IP surveys 
have outlined a consistent polarisable unit which correlates with the mineralization 
encountered by the drilling. 
 
The Kaukua, gradient IP and ground magnetic surveys have outlined the mineralized marginal 
units with good definition as a persistent, linear source of moderately high magnetic 
susceptibility and moderate chargeability, consistent with the descriptions of typical 
disseminated Cu-Ni-Fe sulphide mineralization.  There is some variability displayed along 
strike, which may indicate thinner and/or weaker mineralization, or minor disruptions related 
to late cross faults. 
 
The research and exploration program, by GTK and NAN (1996-2002), resulted in the 
delineation of two highly mineralized areas in the marginal series.  These two areas, Haukiaho 
and Kaukua, were subjected to further exploration activity in 2004 including 2,628.20 metres 
of diamond drilling. 
 
Historical mineralogical and metallurgical studies show a strong correlation between the 
sulphide content and the Ni, Cu and PGE tenor.   
 
WGM prepared resource estimates for the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits in February 2011.  
Those estimates are tabulated in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
 
7.1  GEOLOGY OF FINLAND 
 
Finland lies within the predominantly Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic Fennoscandian 
Shield, which is exposed over an area of more than 1 million km2.  The Fennoscandian Shield 
bedrock is subdivided into three broad domains, which consist of three crustal units, a 
Neoarchaean cratonic nucleus, flanked, on either side by Palaeoproterozoic mobile belts 
(Figure 3).  To the north-east of the Karelian Craton, several distinct crustal units of both 
Proterozoic and Archean age (Kola–Lapland domain) record the amalgamation of Lapland 
granulite belt and greenstone belts to the Karelian Craton at around 1.9 Ga as a collisional 
tectonic regime.  In contrast, the Svecofennian domain, to the SW of the Karelian Craton, is 
entirely Palaeoproterozoic in age, and indicates relatively rapid formation and accretion of 
new crust between about 1.97–1.80 Ga. 
 
The Karelian Craton is characterized by extensive granitoids and higher grade gneiss domains 
surrounding narrow northerly trending greenstone belts.  The major magmatic and 
metamorphic event had taken place around 2.84 Ga, although rocks up to 3.5 Ga are present 
in the Craton.  Greenstone sequences of lower metamorphic grade were formed after this 
event.  These greenstone sequences were subsequently deformed and intruded by tonalitic to 
granitic magmas between 2.75–2.69 Ga.  The Kuhmo and Suomussalmi greenstone belts are 
the most extensive and well preserved supracrustal units in the Archean of Finland, 
outcropping over a strike length of nearly 200 km, though seldom exceeding 10 km in width.  
Both greenstone belts contain abundant tholeiitic and komatiitic volcanic rocks, together with 
related intrusive and subvolcanic cumulates, and lesser felsic volcanic and volcanoclastic 
units. 
 
The northern part of the Karelian Craton, records a prolonged and episodic history of 
sedimentation, rifting and magmatism throughout the Early Palaeoproterozoic.  The Central 
Lapland greenstone belt is the largest mafic-dominated province preserved in the entire shield.  
A sequence of bimodal mafic and felsic volcanics dated at around 2.5 Ga unconformably 
overlie the Archean basement and represent the onset of rifting.  Continued rifting of the 
Archean crust resulted in the widespread emplacement of mafic and ultramafic layered 
intrusions between 2.5–2.4 Ga clustered to form Tornio-Näränkävaara Layered Intrusion Belt 
("TNB") in Finland (see Figure 3).  These TNB intrusions host the important Kemi chromite 
mine, and also contain widespread PGE-Ni-Cu enrichment.  Clastic sediments discordantly 
overlie these layered intrusions, with further episodes of mafic magmatism

recorded as sporadic lavas and sills dated at around 2.2 Ga, 2.10 Ga, and 2.05 Ga.  The latest 
stage includes the Kevitsa Ni-Cu-PGE deposit and coincided with rifting and subsidence of 
the Karelian Craton margin. 
 
7.2  REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF KOILLISMAA LAYERED IGNEOUS 

COMPLEX 
 
The Koillismaa Layered Igneous Complex ("KLIC") of north central Finland (Figure 4) is 
part of the 2.5-2.4 Ga Fennoscandian Early Palaeoproterozoic layered complexes that were 
emplaced as part of a globally recognized episode of igneous activity that introduced layered 
intrusions and mafic dyke swarms worldwide.  These igneous formations have been found to 
have potential for Cr, Cu-Ni-PGE sulphide, PGE and Fe-Ti-V oxide mineralization.  
Examples of well-known economic deposits of these types are the ones hosted by the South-
African Bushveld, Russian Monchegorsk and Finnish Tornio-Näränkävaara belt of intrusions 
(Iljina and Hanski 2005). 
 
The KLIC makes up the eastern most portion of the Tornio-Näränkävaara Belt and consists of 
two main sectors, the Näränkävaara Intrusion (see Figure 3) in the east and the Western 
Intrusion (Figure 4).  These two intrusions were connected by an unexposed connecting dyke, 
which is shown as a strong positive magnetic and gravity anomaly (Alapieti 1982).  This 
connecting dyke has also been interpreted as a Feeder Intrusion.   
 
The Western Intrusion is rather thin despite its greater area with an average vertical thickness 
for the three major blocks of only 1-3 km, but the exposed igneous stratigraphy is as much as 
3 km.  The Western Intrusion is capped with felsic volcanic rocks that have recrystallized to 
form granophyre unit up to 1 km in thickness.  In contrast, the footwall granite gneisses at the 
base of the intrusion have been partially melted and pervasively metasomatically altered to 
albite-quartz rock.  Gabbroic igneous rocks, chemically different than the layered sequence, 
form the footwall locally such as underneath the Porttivaara, Tilsa, and Kaukua Blocks. 
 
The Western Intrusion has been uplifted and broken into a number of blocks (see Figure 4) 
due to multiphase tectonic events.  The Western Intrusion has been folded slightly and 
possibly even collapsed during the earliest, extensional, tectonic regime to form a synclinal 
structure between the Kuusijärvi and Lipeävaara Blocks (Karinen 2010).  The supracrustal 
sequence deposited along this structure, is known as the Kuusijärvi synform.  The igneous 
layering of the intrusive blocks to the south of the synform, dip to the north, (Tilsa to the NW) 
while the northern blocks dip to the south (Kaukua and Murtolampi) or west-southwest 
(Lipeävaara).

The Cumulus stratigraphy of the Western Intrusion is divided into the Marginal Series or 
Zone and the overlying Layered Series.  The Marginal Series can be up to a couple of hundred 
metres in thickness and be made up of differentiated cumulates ranging from gabbros and 
pyroxenites to peridotites.  The Marginal Series can be repeated on surface due to tectonic 
movements at Porttivaara and Tilsa Blocks, in particular.  The Layered Series is composed 
entirely of mafic cumulates. 
 
7.2.1  ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF THE KOILLISMAA COMPLEX 
 
All mineralization types characteristic of layered mafic intrusions can be found in the Tornio-
Näränkävaara Belt.  These include accumulations of chromite and PGE-enriched base metal 
sulphides in the bottom parts of the intrusions (contact-type PGE deposits), stratiform PGE, 
chromite and magnetite enrichments higher in the cumulate sequences, and offset PGE-base 
metal deposits below the intrusions (Iljina and Hanski 2005).  A world-class chrome deposit is 
located at the base of the Kemi intrusion and a magnetite gabbro layer of the KLIC has been 
exploited for vanadium.  Potentially world-class reef-type PGE deposits are distributed among 
the intrusions of Penikat and Narkaus (Portimo Complex).  Contact type PGE deposits show 
exceptionally high PGE concentrations in places, relative to what is typically found in basal 
sulphide mineralization.  The location of the reefs and better grade contact-type deposits 
seems to be controlled by the megacyclic structure of the intrusions and/or periodic 
emplacement of magma of slightly variable compositions. 
 
There are three principal mineralization types that have taken place in the Western Intrusion.  
The Rometölväs Reef in the layered series, forms erratic and low-grade base metal and PGE 
zone, approximately 20 m in thickness.  These also contains even and fine-grained xenoliths 
(microgabbronorites), gabbropegmatites and anorthositic segregates, all in a gabbronoritic 
adcumulate.  A thick (200 m) magnetite gabbro layer is found higher up in the layered 
sequence, and this layer has been exploited for its vanadium content at the Mustavaara Mine.  
However, the contact-type sulphide-PGE deposits, at the bottom and margins of every 
intrusive block of the Western Koillismaa Intrusion have the largest areal extent (see 
Figure 4).  Due to tectonic sinking of the central part of the original Western Intrusion, the 
bottom parts of the intrusion and related base metal - PGE enrichment zones are exposed on 
the southern margins of the intrusive blocks of Pirivaara, Syöte, Porttivaara, and Kuusijärvi 
and on the northern to northeastern margins of the Lipeävaara, Kaukua, and Murtolampi 
blocks.  Total strike length of the marginal zone is on the order of 100 km (Iljina 2004).

Glacial drift covers the claim areas and only a small proportion of the bedrock outcrops.  The 
drift ranges from 2–7 m thickness, although the overburden encountered drilling in the NE 
corner of the Kaukua deposit was approximately 30 m thick. 
 
The bedrock underneath the till is unweathered and no true saprock is encountered; only the 
westernmost Haukiaho drill hole (3543/04/R393) encountered deeply weathered rock, 
obviously due to local fracture zones which cut the Kuusijärvi intrusive block in the west. 
 
The glacial transport is from W-WNW and the transportation distances are short, being only a 
few hundred of metres in the Haukiaho area as indicated by the numerous ore boulders.  On 
the other hand, sorted sands are also found in the Kaukua area in addition to the till. 
 
7.3.2  KAUKUA 
 
The Kaukua Block is c. 8 km2 and is situated in the northern part of the Western Intrusion.  
The stratigraphy consists of a thick layered series dominated by mottled gabbronorites with 
sub-horizontal layering overlying a sequence of gabbros, pyroxenites and peridotites of the 
marginal series that are preferentially mineralised (Figure 5). 
 
Syn-formational, east-west trending diabase dykes follow the sub-vertical cleavage plane, 
occasionally flexing and thickening along a shallow dipping contact between the upper 
mottled gabbronorites and lower pyroxenites and peridotites. 
 
The Kaukua deposit has a strike length of approximately 1,000 m.  The deposit dips south at a 
20° to 30° angle.  The Kaukua Fault divides the Kaukua main block in the south from the 
smaller northern block.  The Kaukua Fault is a normal fault, bringing the northern mineralised 
succession located at depth in the southern block back to the surface in the north. 
 
The stratigraphy of the Kaukua deposit is traditionally divided into layered series 
gabbronorites and marginal series pyroxenites and peridotites (Table 7).  In gabbronorites 
subhedral augite grains, up to several cm in diameter, are the main cumulus phase with 
plagioclase of unknown composition as intercumulus phase.  Quartz is also discovered as 
intercumulus mineral, primarily due to assimilation of basement granitoids or syn-formational 
silicification.  Gabbronorites of the layered series contain xenoliths of hybrid

The contact between the layered series and the marginal series is normally sharp, occasionally 
tectonized.  The upper most rock type of the marginal series is usually intensely sheared 
pyroxenite which exhibits strong signs of hydrothermal alteration (retrograde metamorphism).   
 



   

- 33 - 

This particular sheared pyroxenite has altered into chlorite schist and/or clay minerals.  The 
presence of sulphides in this rock type is sporadic and difficultly prognosticated.  When 
present they occur as fracture fill along the shear seams.  Sulphides consist of elongated 
intergrown chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite aggregates with pentlandite inclusions in pyrrhotite.  
Chalcopyrite also occurs as independent grains/aggregates. 
 
Below the sheared pyroxenite the middle part of the marginal series presents itself with 
varying units of pyroxenites and peridotites in random order.  To date three different types of 
pyroxenites and two different types of peridotite have been identified by Nortec. 
 
Pyroxenites can be divided into three different sub-types which all are perceived to contain 
sulphides with fluctuating grades.  None of these three sub-types can be pointed as the most 
common.  The first sub-type is fine grained and massive pyroxenite with possible sulphides as 
fine dissemination of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite being the dominating sulphide.  
Aggregates of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite with varying diameters have been discovered.  The 
second sub-type is foliated pyroxenite, similar with one in the contact of the layered and the 
marginal series.  The third sub-type, is augite adcumulate, with sulphides as very fine 
dissemination and occasional aggregates of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite being the 
dominating sulphide (see Table 7). 
 
Hydrothermal alteration can be identified in all of the three pyroxenite sub-types.  Chlorite 
and talc alterations are the most apparent ones in which primary augite has been replaced by 
secondary chlorite, talc, epidote or clay mineral of unknown composition.  Pyroxenites are 
seen to contain basement fragments as xenoliths, contacts between the xenoliths and the 
pyroxenite are either sharp or gradational depending on the degree of partial melting of the 
xenoliths.  In some parts of the Kaukua deposit pyroxenites are influenced by peridotite veins 
which are, according to present assumption, interpreted to represent a possible secondary 
pulse of ultramafic magma into slowly cooling primary intrusion. 
 
Peridotites are divided into two sub-types.  The first one is very fine grained, almost 
aphanitic, massive peridotite which is usually barren.  The second one is foliated and fine 
grained and occasionally sulphide bearing.  The main mineralization types vary from fine 
dissemination and fracture fill to aggregates of up to several centimetres in diameter.  
Sulphides appear as pseudomorphs of olivine grains.  The peridotite sections are not reported 
to contain any basement xenoliths.  Both peridotite sub-types are intensely talc altered. 
 
The mixed basement (basal gabbro) is located between the marginal series and basement 
granodiorite.  The thickness of mixed basement/basal gabbro ranges from 5 m to over 30 m.  
This sequence consists of remnants of the marginal series and molten basement material, 



   

- 34 - 

sometimes sections of augen pyroxenites.  Sulphides are sporadically present as chalcopyrite 
dominating chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite dissemination and aggregates. 
 
Basement rocks around the Kaukua deposit are in most cases granodiorite and granite in 
addition to mafic rock chemically different from the main Kaukua intrusion.  Granitic 
basement is limited to the northern part of the Kaukua deposit whereas granodiorite is the 
most common basement rock in the remaining part of the intrusion.  The granodiorite is 
granular with approximately even sized grains of plagioclase, quartz and potassium feldspar 
with minor amounts of biotite. 
 
7.3.3  HAUKIAHO AND HAUKIAHO EAST 
 
The Haukiaho property (Figure 6) is situated 12 km to SSW from Kaukua and is hosted by the 
Kuusijärvi intrusive block, which itself is part of the Koillismaa Western Intrusion.  The 
igneous stratigraphy of the Haukiaho is rather similar to that of the Kaukua although the 
repetition of pyroxenite and peridotite is less common in Haukiaho.  The stratigraphic units 
are the same as well the metamorphic alteration of primary igneous minerals.  Originally 
gabbroic plagioclase-pyroxene cumulates are now composed of (metamorphic) plagioclase 
and pale amphibole (tremolite-actinolite).  Pyroxene cumulates are presently chlorite-
amphibole rocks, often schistose, while the decomposition of the igneous olivine has given 
rise to serpentine, talc and magnetite.  Minor metamorphic minerals include epidote, 
hornblende and biotite. 
 
The granodioritic Archaean gneiss below the layered intrusion has pervasively metasomatized 
and is mineralogically albite-quartz rock, which often retains primary textures and structures 
(banding).  This albite-quartz rock contains irregular patches, sometimes several metres thick, 
of mafic enclaves or dykes.  The lower contact of the layered intrusion is sometimes 
impossible to map accurately.  In the claim area, the albite-quartz rock is hundreds of metres 
thick (true thickness) and the unaltered footwall rocks have not been reached by any historic 
drill hole. 
 
The footwall contact and the igneous layering are subvertical and dip NNE.  The distance 
between the marginal series and the magnetite gabbro of the layered series, narrows towards 
to the west in the Kuusijärvi block and the two units actually are in contact in the westernmost 
Property area. 
 
The Haukiaho mineralization resembles that of Kaukua both mineralogically and in style.  
The Haukiaho mineralization is hosted mainly by pyroxenitic and gabbroic cumulate 
lithologies.  It is steeply dipping to north-north-east and is generally 15-40 metres thick.

Continuity along strike is very consistent.  Like Kaukua, the mineralization is disseminated in 
character, but contains a few narrow massive sulphide veins.  Pyrrhotite, pentlandite, 
chalcopyrite, and also pyrite in lesser amount, are the main sulphide minerals. 
 
7.3.4  LIPEÄVAARA AND MURTOLAMPI 
 
Lipeävaara is located between Kaukua and Haukiaho while Murtolampi is 2.7 km NNE from 
Kaukua.  Much less is known on the geology of these intrusion blocks, but what is known is 
similar to that of Kaukua or Haukiaho.  The same applies also to mineralization in terms of 
style and grade.  The above information is based on published reports of GTK (Iljina 2004). 
 
7.4  MINERALIZATION 
 
7.4.1  GENERAL 
 
Four principal types of base metal - PGE mineralization have been identified within the 
Kaukua block (see Table 7) and the available data from Haukiaho, Lipeävaara and 
Murtolampi indicates that this applies also to them with the exception of the first type: 
 
1) Hangingwall-type Mineralization (contact-type, see section 8.  'Deposit types'). 
2) Marginal Series-type Mineralization (contact-type).   
3) Mixed Zone-type Mineralization (contact-type). 
4) Reef-type Mineralization. 
 
The Hangingwall-type mineralization is hosted in strongly foliated gabbronorite of the layered 
series just above the marginal series.  The reason, why it is classified as Contact type is that it 
doesn't have the characteristics of reef-type mineralization (high PGE, low base metals), but 
shares metal ratios and absolute metal grades similar to mineralization hosted by the marginal 
series proper. 
 
Marginal Series-type mineralization makes up over 70% of the metal deposition at Kaukua.  
The Marginal Series is dominated by pyroxenite that hosts sulphide assemblages comprised of 
pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite.  The sulphide assemblage also occurs as medium-grained, 
disseminated aggregations.  Sulphide content increases towards the base of the Marginal 
Series, which often indicates an increase in grade for both PGE and base metals.  There are 
occasional thin (<3 m wide) transition zones between the mineralized pyroxenite (Marginal 
Series) and the sulphide-bearing Mixed Zone that have low-grade or barren PGE 
mineralization. 
 



   

- 37 - 

Sulphide mineralization in the Mixed Zone-type at Kaukua varies in thickness between 30 and 
40 metres.  The Mixed Zone is dominated by xenoliths of granodiorite and quartzo-
feldspathic gneisses partially assimilated into Marginal Series.  Sulphides usually occur as 
fine-medium grained chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite disseminations in the basement unit and in 
cross-cutting gabbroic-pyroxenitic intrusives.  Pyrite is also present.  PGE are associated with 
the sulphides, and the highest values occur in chalcopyrite-rich domains.  Upon moving 
deeper into the basement, pyrite becomes a dominant sulphide and PGE values decrease 
below detection limits. 
 
The Kaukua PGE – base metals sulphide reef shares many similar features with the 
Rometölväs Reef described in the Syöte and Porttivaara blocks of the Koillismaa Intrusion.  
This Rometölväs Reef at Kaukua appears is low-grade, erratic enrichments disseminated 
within a 20 m thick gabbronorite adcumulate zone containing fine-grained xenoliths (known 
as microgabbronorites), gabbropegmatites and anorthositic segregates (Iljina, 2004; Karinen, 
2010).  The characteristic feature of the reef in Kaukua is frequent basement xenoliths.  In the 
northern Kaukua this reef looks to come into contact to the marginal series due to angular 
discordance between the marginal series and layered series.  When occurring right above the 
marginal series the Reef is actually determined as Hangingwall-type mineralization described 
above. 
 
The metal ratios and chondrite normalised patterns identified by GTK, show a steady, 
moderately positive slope for PGE; Haukiaho with higher normalised Au content. 
 
Typical sulphide assemblage is pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite (Photo 1), and accessory 
sulphides include pyrite, sphalerite, galena and molybdenite.  The main oxides are magnetite 
and ilmenite, with chromite present in trace amounts.  The grades of PGE mineralization 
roughly correlates with the abundance of sulphides, particularly chalcopyrite. 
 
The four principal types of mineralization require different fundamental ore forming 
processes including syn- to post-genetic hydrothermal activity.  Therefore, a polygenetic 
model is needed to explain the presence of PGE and base metal mineralization rather than a 
simple magmatic sulphide model.  High grades are concentrated largely within the lower 
(marginal) gabbro and lower lying transitional (assimilated) zones.  The granodioritic 
basement rocks immediately below the mafic-ultramafic intrusion are typified by a prominent 
hydrothermally altered low-grade mineralized section.  Below this zone, the granodiorite is 
only sporadically altered and is largely barren, except where discrete chalcopyrite-rich quartz 
veins and sulphidized amphibolitic zones occur.

7.4.2  PETROGRAPHY 
 
There have been three petrological and microanalytical studies carried out by GTK on 
selected samples from the Kaukua drill core.  The first study was an in-house GTK study done 
in 2002 on core samples taken from the GTK holes drilled in 1999.  In 2008, Nortec 
contracted GTK to perform petrological and microanalytical study on samples from holes 
KAU07-002 and KAU07-007 drilled during Nortec's Phase I drill campaign in 2007.  This 
study involved both a polarised light microscope and also a Scanning Electron Microscope 
with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis ("SEM-EDS").  An internal petrographic study 
conducted by Nortec began in October 2008 and was completed in the second quarter of 
2009.  SEM-EDS studies reveal that most of the platinum-group minerals (PGM) at Kaukua 
are arsenides, bismutotellurides, and arsenoantimonides (Johanson and Pakkanen 2008).  
Native forms and alloys are absent.  PGM are included in base metal sulphides, magnetite, 
and silicates and also occur along gangue mineral grain boundaries.  Pd-bearing minerals 
include isomertieite (Pd11Sb2As2), members of the kotulskite-sobolevskite solid-solution 
(PdBi-PdSb), palladoarsenide (Pd2As), majakite (PdNiAs), and paolovite (Pd2Sn).  The 
principal platinum carrier mineral is sperrylite (PtAs2) while Bi-bearing moncheite (PtTe2) is 
also present.  Platinum-group sulphides are rare and those that have been identified belong to 
the vysotskite (PdS) - braggite ([Pd,Pt]S) series. 
 



   

- 39 - 

PGM mineralogy of Kaukua is practically identical to that observed from Haukiaho, where 
the following has been stated (Kojonen and Iljina 2001): "Most of the grains found occur 
within silicates as discrete grains.  To lesser extent, the PGM are intergrown on the grain 
borders of sulphides.  The grain size is less than 40 μm, and most of the grains were 5-10 μm 
in diameter.  The major part of the PGM found belongs to the system (Pd+Ni)-Bi-Te 
including minerals merenskyite (62%), michenerite (1.3%), kotulskite (5%) and Pd-rich 
melonite (25.3%).  Other PGM found were sperrylite (6%) and PGE-rich cobaltite which was 
observed within sulphides." 
 
The common feature for all the rock types examined by Nortec was the varying degree of 
hydrothermal overprinting.  Hydrothermal alteration was consistent and seen in all samples.  
The main alteration types were chlorite alteration of pyroxenes and olivine, talc alteration and 
serpentinization of peridotites, epidotization of pyroxenites, albitization and K-metasomatic 
alteration of mafic units (gabbronorite and diabase).  Nortec interpreted these as evidence to 
suggest that the whole intrusion had undergone retrograde metamorphism of greenschist/low 
amphibolite facies.  K-metasomatism was found to be epigenetic and associated with late 
presence of Na-K-Ca enriched fluids/phase (epidotization, K-metasomatism and albitization). 
 
Sulphide mineralization was found to consist mainly of chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, and 
pentlandite of which the chalcopyrite was prevailing.  Sulphides were discovered as 
dissemination, aggregates and stringers.  Disseminations were usually in the intercumulus 
phase in pyroxenites, and peridotites, sometimes as pseudomorphs of cumulus minerals.  
Pentlandite was found as inclusions in pyrrhotite or as rims around pyrrhotite grains 
(Photo 2). 
 
Based on the above findings Nortec concluded that the parental magma of the Kaukua deposit 
reached the point of sulphur saturation for sulphides to precipitate.  However, it is improbable 
that parental magma itself contained enough sulphur to reach sulphur saturation through 
fractional crystallization.  The source of additional sulphur still remains unknown. 
 
WGM noted that Nortec has made adequate effort in the delineation of mineralization.  
However, to date mineral chemical studies are exclusively concentrated on the platinum-
group minerals and base metal sulphides.  The silicates have been excluded.

8.  DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
 
Platinum-Group Elements ("PGE") constitute of six main metals: platinum (Pt), palladium 
(Pd), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), and osmium (Os).  Economic PGE deposits 
are primarily exclusively hosted by mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks.  On the basis of 
relative amounts (in economic value) of PGE and other metals, PGE deposits can be classified 
to 'PGE only' type of deposits, and deposits, in which PGE's are enriched along with the base 
metal sulphides (Table 8).

PGE deposits can also be classified according to hosting igneous system whether the deposits 
are hosted by intracontinental layered intrusions, other type of intrusions or volcanic 
extrusives including their feeder systems (Table 9).  PGE deposits of intracontinental layered 
intrusions are further classified on their structural position in the intrusion.  Structural 
positions to locate PGE deposits are depicted in Table 10 and Figure 7. 
 
'Contact type' deposits are generally zones within the Marginal Series, which are tens to over 
hundred metres wide and have developed at the base or sides of mafic layered intrusions.  The 
PGE concentrations are lower than in the 'reef-type' deposits and the exploitability is based 
on large tonnages.  Contact type mineralization are erratic in nature and in individual drill 
holes the highest PGE values can be found tens of metres above or below the contact of the 
intrusion; they are also variable along the strike.  High-grade PGE enrichments, contact type 
and others, seem to be related to larger igneous events, but the size of the hosting intrusion is 
not necessarily the unambiguous requirement (Iljina and Lee 2005).

The key conclusion is that the host rocks of contact-type PGE deposits are characterized by 
extensive and prolonged interaction of mafic magma with the surrounding host rock.  This 
results in thick marginal zones, which is often characterized by a reversed fractionation trend, 
in which mafic lithologies at the very contact of the intrusions are followed first by 
pyroxenitic and further by olivine bearing lithologies.  In this respect Kaukua and Haukiaho 
successions are identical to that of Suhanko Project area and are typical representatives for 
'contact-type' PGE deposit.

Since Finore has not undertaken any direct exploration to date, this Section describes Finore's 
Joint Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp.'s exploration activities since acquiring the 
properties in 2007. 
 
Nortec's exploration program consisted mainly of geophysical ground measurements in 
addition to re-logging and sampling of historic drill core that is still available.  Nortec nor 
Finore has to date not undertaken any outcrop mapping, geochemical surveys or surface 
sampling programs on any of its properties. 
 
Nortec reports the following sequence of exploration activities completed since entering into 
an agreement with AEbv in early 2007. 
 
9.1  GROUND GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY 
 
The 'contact-type' PGE mineralization which is typically base metal sulphide bearing and 
commonly enriched in Cu and Ni.  This feature leads to a broad geophysical IP signature 
characterized by elevated conductivity and especially chargeability.  Nortec contracted SJ 
Geophysics, a geophysical contracting and consultancy firm from Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 
June 2008 to conduct a three-dimensional Induced Polarization (3DIP) test survey over the 
Kaukua property.  The purpose of this ground geophysical test survey was to determine if IP 
could locate and trace potential sulphide mineralization and differentiate between possible 
similar responses from fine grained magnetite known to be present in the area.  Data 
collection was carried out on a grid with lines spaces at 100 m, amounting to 20-line 
kilometres of survey. 
 
9.2  RELOGGING AND SAMPLING OF GTK AND NAN HISTORIC 

DRILL HOLES 
 
Ten GTK drill holes located within the Kaukua group of claims were re-logged in 2008 
followed by the 2009-2010 re-logging and sampling of 58 holes derived from Haukiaho, 
Lipeävaara and Murtolampi groups of claims.  Logging was done in accord with Nortec's 
coding formats for geological and geotechnical logging used in the company's own drilling 
program.  The core was also photographed.

9.3  RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPLORATION 
OPERATIONS 

 
The computed inverted chargeability sections calculated from the 3DIP survey outline several 
anomalous sources which were generally observed to correlate with known and projected Cu-
Ni mineralization as determined from drilling, and as seen in compiled cross-sections. 
 
WGM has reviewed the surveys completed by SJ Geophysics and the technical report and 
data presented by Syd Visser, as well as exploration memos by Ian Laurent to Nortec, which 
provides an exploration overview recapitulating key aspects bearing on geophysical surveys 
for identified sulphide mineralization within the Kaukua property. 
 
WGM accepts the following quotation from the geophysical surveys completed by SJ 
Geophysics as provided by the Nortec. 
 

"Comparison of the resistivity and the chargeability shows that the chargeability is 
associated with a relatively low resistivity zone but right at a very high resistivity 
contact making it appear as though the high chargeability is sitting in a type of basin.  
With the exception of the area around the power line near the south of the grid the data 
collected in the survey grid was of very good quality and could differentiate between the 
very low background chargeabilities and only slightly elevated anomalous 
chargeabilities.  The spherics which was bad during the survey period did hamper the 
quality somewhat but not sufficient to delay the survey and only a few parts of the 
survey were resurveyed to check quality.  The data indicated that there was an elevated 
chargeability zone striking northwest to southeast across the central part of the survey 
area.  Inside this elevated chargeability zone there were two distinct higher 
chargeability trends separated by a very high resistivity zone.  The bottom and lateral 
extents of the anomalous chargeability also seemed to be marked by higher resistivity 
making it appear like a type of basin which contained the higher chargeabilities.  The 
historic drilling which had anomalous results in sulphur, copper etc all seemed to 
correlate well with the higher chargeability anomaly in the northeast part of the 
anomalous zone.  The high chargeability to the south appeared to have been barely 
missed by previous drilling therefore it is recommended to drill more into the central 
part of this anomaly.  It is recommended that drilling be confined to the higher 
chargeability values and that the grid is extended to the south-east and possibly to the 
north-west on the northern side of the lake." 

 
As a result of the re-logging Nortec confirmed the quality of GTK and NAN historic drill 
holes sampling and assay data and integrated this information into the drill hole Access 
dataset. 
 



   

- 47 - 

WGM observed that Nortec's exploration concentrated exclusively on known mineralized 
areas in Kaukua and was strongly guided by geophysics.  The chosen approach is adequate 
given available budget and mineralization characteristics (good chargeability).  WGM notes 
that re-logging of GTK and NAN drill core included all holes on Kaukua, Haukiaho and 
Murtolampi groups of claims, but excluded one hole on Lipeävaara.  This excluded hole, 
however, is located outside of the anticipated mineralized zone.  Also, no re-logging of 
historic drill holes in the Haukiaho east property is done till today.  The study of old 
Outokumpu drill holes is also hampered by the fact that mineralised intervals are largely 
missing and hence no further sampling is possible as noted by the author in his site visit in 
2010 to Finland National Drill Core Depot. 
 
9.4  EXPLORATION POTENTIAL IN MURTOLAMPI AND HAUKIAHO 

EAST PROPERTIES 
 
WGM notes, that the Kaukua and Murtolampi claim areas entirely cover the intrusive 
segments, while Haukiaho, Haukiaho east and Lipeävaara claims cover only the 
stratigraphically lower parts of the intrusive blocks mapped in this area.  The entire 
stratigraphy of the Kaukua intrusive Block has been intersected by drilling, but drill hole 
information is limited to the lower intrusive units in other claim areas.  Altogether Finore's 
claims cover a 26 km long section of the Koillismaa marginal zone.  Mineralization has been 
confirmed by drilling along about 16 km, leaving 10 km largely untested. 
 
Erratic ore grade drill hole intersections from the Murtolampi target, as exemplified in 
Figure 8, also indicates the presence of mineralization outside the more intensively explored 
areas of Kaukua and Haukiaho.

WGM also notes that the mineralized zone is likely to continue SE from Target Haukiaho to 
Target Haukiaho east as suggested by historic drilling (Figure 9).   
 
It has been observed within other intracratonic layered mafic complexes, that the metal, 
especially PGE, grades tend to be structurally correlated in a way shown in Figure 7. 
 
The contact-type deposits tend to be more highly mineralized in structurally favourable 
positions, where the PGE-enriched reef comes in contact with the marginal series due to 
angular discordance (see Figure 7).  In the Bushveld complex, the Platreef has been 
interpreted to represent Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef in the Northern Bushveld (Iljina and 
Lee 2005).  In Finland, a similar relationship is found in the Penikat and Portimo Complexes.  
Within the Koillismaa Complex this 'critical' structural position is discerned to likely be 
present in the Kaukua block, where a PGE reef merges with the marginal series in the 
northern Kaukua.  This is also supported by higher average PGE tenor and more PGE 
enriched pockets encountered at Kaukua, unknown elsewhere in Koillismaa this far. 
 
At Haukiaho, close to the eastern end of Finore's property (Haukiaho 11), historic drilling has 
intersected a low-PGE grade reef located structurally hundreds of metres above the marginal 
series.  Going westwards increasingly higher layered series units are in contact with the 
marginal series.  This is the anticipated favourable structural position where the reef is 
tentatively inferred, to be merging with the contact-type mineralization.  This occurs in the 
western end of Haukiaho claims, where historic drilling has revealed higher PGE tenor than 
general found in Koillismaa.  An anomalous high gold intersection of one metre @ 3.0 ppm 
Au has also been encountered in that area. 
 
Based on the above structural interpretation and observations WGM infers that Haukiaho 
warrants further exploration and has the potential to host reasonable (economically 
significant) resources.

10.  DRILLING 
 
 
10.1  DRILLING PHASES 
 
Finore started a 10,000 m drilling program in October 21st, 2011 and had completed 1,450 m 
in ten holes by the time of the second site visit (December 20th, 2011).  These NQ2 size holes 
were infill holes in the westernmost Haukiaho target.   
 
Finore's present core logging, sample processing and custody program follows the principles 
used by Nortec in their previous drilling.  These include standard, spreadsheet-based logging 
format with validated fields, core cutting by Nortec staff and submitting samples to ALS 
Chemex facility in the town of Outokumpu.  Holes are surveyed by Reflex Maxibor II ® gyro 
instrument by the drilling company, Nivalan Timanttikairaus oy.  Only the logging and 
sample preparation facility are different, they now use facilities shared with Mustavaaran 
kaivos oy. 
 
Finore's QAQC program comprises submitting sample blanks, and standard reference 
samples similarly to Nortec's program.  Inter-laboratory check assays are scheduled to be 
made in a Finnish accredited geochemical laboratory Labtium.  Standards inserted in the 
sample flow include AMIS (African Mineral Standards) 56 and AMIS 64 for PGE and base 
metals, and an in-house olivine diabase for precious metal blank.  These standards were also 
used by Nortec in previous drilling phases.  The interval of inserting is about 1/20 sample. 
 
Visual check of these holes confirms sulphide mineralization to exist in expected sections in 
these holes.  No assay results were available at the time of preparing this report. 
 
Subsequent sections describe Finore's Joint Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp.'s drilling 
since acquiring the properties in 2007. 
 
Nortec has conducted four phases of exploration drilling over the Kaukua property since 
October 2007, for a total of 10,308 m (Table 11).  The drill programs explored for shallow 
dipping PGE+Au-Cu-Ni mineralization, which trends east-west, dips to the south and plunges 
to the west-southwest. 
 
The deepest hole KAU08-038 drilled to a depth of 403.95 m, while the average depth of the 
other holes was 202 m.  Three different drill contractors have been used for the four phases of 
drilling.  All holes (excluding KAU08-021 and KAU08-022) are inclined and oriented to the 
north.  A few of the holes are sub-vertical (-85° to the north).  Holes KAU08-021 and 



   

- 51 - 

KAU08-022 have been drilled to the northeast.  Statistics of the four phases of diamond 
drilling are presented in Table 11, and the locations of drill holes on the Kaukua Property are 
shown in Figure 5.   
 

TABLE 11. 
STATISTICS OF PROJECT DRILLING  

(Phases, Contractors, and Used Equipments 2007 to 2009) 

 

The Phase I exploration drill program was carried out by the GTK Technical Services Group 
using a GM-100 based rig and BQTK equipment for 40.7 mm diameter core.  From Phase II 
forward swivel drive drill rigs were used to produce NQ2 size core (50.7 mm).  Downhole 
surveys were done by Nivalan Timanttikairaus oy using the Reflex Maxibor II ® gyro 
instrument for the hole KAU08-017 and later.  All the drill hole collar coordinates have 
surveyed by a contract surveyor, Rovamitta oy. 
 
Nortec had not done any drilling on the Haukiaho, Haukiaho east, Lipeävaara or Murtolampi 
properties. 
 
10.2  GEOLOGICAL LOGGING 
 
Lithological logging was done on drill core in two distinct stages by Nortec geologists.  
Logging included marking of lithological contacts, recording descriptive geology, core 
diameter, and a graphic log (till KAU08-018) depicting all down-hole data.  All information 
was recorded on handwritten logs and subsequently entered into a digital database. 
 
In the logging procedure the first stage was a summary log ("Quicklog") prepared at the drill 
sites as the core is being collected to take back to the core logging and storage facilities in 
Taivalkoski.  The Quicklog records the geological intervals and any specific features such as 
zones of significant mineralization and/or alteration.  The Quicklog was sent to Nortec 
management in the Vancouver office on a daily basis.  Modification or adjustments to the drill 
program were based on these reports.

The "Quicklog" was followed by the second stage of geological logging called Detailed Log.  
This was carried out at the core facility and consisted of recording all the technical 
information about the drill hole and drill core, including a detailed code-based geological 
description of the core.  A standard, spreadsheet-based, logging format with validated fields 
derived from a user-defined library, were designed to record all information.  The drill hole 
specific spreadsheet includes validated worksheets for the following information: 

 

• Collar information (x,y,z, dip, az, total depth, date etc.); 
• Metadata information (drill rig specs, casing, core reductions etc.); 
• Geology information (see below); 
• Geotechnical information (see below); 
• Downhole survey information (see below); 
• Sampling information; and 
• Sample submittal information. 

 
The following fields were recorded in the geology section of the Detailed Log by Nortec 
geologist: 
 
• From (m); 
• To (m); 
• Rock code (lithology code of up to six characters and used for domain and block 

modelling); 
• Strat code (stratigraphic code of two characters); 
• Colour; 
• Grain size; 
• Texture; 
• Structure; 
• Sulph_Style (disseminated, aggregates, vein, massive etc.); 
• Sulph_Int (0 – 3, where 0 = no sulphides and 3 = >5% sulphides); 
• cpy_int (chalcopyrite), po_int (pyrrhotite), py_int (pyrite), pent_int (pentlandite): intensity 

of the individual sulphides (scale of 0 – 3, where 0 = none and 3 = >5%); 
• Ox_int (oxidation intensity, 0 = none and 3 = complete); 
• Alteration; 
• Alt_int (alteration intensity, 0 = none and 3 = complete); 
• Vein_Type (3 or 4 character code for vein description); and 
• Comments (description of interval up to 200 characters long). 
 
10.3  GEOTECHNICAL LOGGING 
 
Nortec has recorded Rock Quality Designation ("RQD") and Core Recovery for all holes.  No 
density information was recorded during the geotechnical logging stage. 
 



   

- 53 - 

10.4  DRILL HOLE COLLAR SURVEY 
 
All drill holes that are collared on the Kaukua Property (including GTK holes) have been 
surveyed by Mr. Jukka Pikkupeura, Land Survey Engineer from Rovaniemi based survey 
contracting company, Rovamitta Oy. 
 
Rovamitta was also commissioned to survey historic drill holes at Haukiaho.  This survey did, 
however, fail to locate many Outokumpu holes drilled in the sixties.  In the case of these 
unfound drilling sites, original coordinates provided by Outokumpu, were used in the mineral 
resource estimate.  The measured DGPS coordinates for discovered old Outokumpu drill 
holes indicate a difference of a few tens of metres in most cases.  One hole did have a 
hundred metre difference. 
 
Rovamitta used a Differential GPS method to determine the location of the drill holes.  A 
Trimble GPS equipment using GNSS-technique was used giving horizontal accuracy to 
0.01 m and a vertical accuracy of 0.02 m. 
 
All coordinates are reported using the Finnish KKJ datum and projection and referenced to a 
multi-angle point 0 m1480.  The elevation is based on the altitude system N60. 
 
Rovamitta has delivered signed off documents on the results of surveys. 
 
10.5  DOWNHOLE SURVEY 
 
The Maxibor II downhole survey tool by REFLEX® was introduced as part of the drill 
program from drill hole KAU08-017 onwards.  REFLEX Maxibor® II is an advanced 
instrument for highly accurate surveys and can be used in highly magnetic rocks, even inside 
metals drill rods. 
 

Reflex Maxibor® II calculates the spatial coordinates along the drill hole path based on 
optical measurements of direction changes and gravimetric measurements of dip changes.  
Reflex Maxibor® II is managed from a handheld computer.  An infrared communication link 
assures fast and reliable data transfer.  Survey data is presented in tabular as well as in 2D and 
interactive 3D graphical format on the handheld computer. 

 

The reports are presented using SProcess® and displayed per drill hole both graphically and 
in a table. 
 



   

- 54 - 

For the historic GTK drill holes, down hole dips were measured.  For both the Outokumpu 
and NAN historic drill holes the drill hole starting dip and bearing was assumed for the entire 
length of the hole.

11.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
 
11.1  CHAIN OF CUSTODY, SAMPLE PREPARATION AND SECURITY 
 
This Section describes Finore's Joint Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp.'s sample 
preparation and analytical procedures since acquiring the properties in 2007.  It also includes 
WGM's due diligence of the analytical results. 
 
Nortec staff was responsible for transportation of the drill core from site to core storage and 
logging facility in Taivalkoski, about 70 km from drilling site. 
 
During the logging stage, the core was measured and sample intervals selected by Nortec 
staff.  These intervals were marked on the core and on the core boxes.  Nortec staff members 
cut the core samples with a diamond saw.  These half core samples from drill holes 
KAU07-001 to KAU08-038 were sent to Labtium Oy (Labtium), and samples from 
KAU09-039 onwards were sent to ALS Chemex Laboratory (ALS Chemex) in town of 
Outokumpu.  Standards were inserted into the sample flow by Nortec.  No other than Nortec 
samples were treated in the room during the sample preparations. 
 
Coarse rejects and pulps not used for assay were sent, by both laboratories, back to the issuer, 
which stores them in its core farm at Taivalkoski.   
 
11.2  SECURITY 
 
Nortec's Taivalkoski core storage facilities consist of 'warm' and unheated 'cold' storages in 
two separate buildings about 500 m apart.  The 'warm' storage is exclusively in Nortec's use 
while the 'cold' one is shared with another tenant.  Both storages are locked. 
 
All project data are stored in Nortec's office server in Vancouver, with data backup. 
 
11.3  SAMPLE ANALYSIS 
 
Based on mineralogical studies the base metals, except Ni, are practically exclusively carried 
by sulphides like pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pentlandite, and pyrite.  The Ni is, however, 
distributed between Ni-sulphides and Ni-bearing mafic silicates.  The assay methods for base 
metals can roughly be classified as follows: 
 
• 'Total' (like Labtium 720P), which gives the total concentration of metals in the rock;  



   

- 56 - 

• 'Sulphide selective' (like Labtium 240P), which gives metal content bound to sulphides, 
and; 

• 'Partial', which gives metal concentrations in sulphide fraction plus some addition from 
silicate phases i.e. the resulting value is likely between the results received by 'total' and 
'sulphide selective' methods.   

 
As the selective sulphide leaching techniques are not accredited methods for assaying nickel 
in sulphides, Partial methods, such as an Aqua Regia leach (Labtium 510P and ALS Chemex 
ME-ICP41), were systematically used for the base metal analyses. 
 
11.3.1  LABTIUM 
 
The analyses for samples from drill holes KAU07-001 to KAU08-038 were performed by 
accredited geochemical laboratory, Labtium.  Labtium is an independent, fully State owned 
laboratory outsourced from GTK in 2007.  The laboratory codes used for the analyses are 
shown in Table 12.

Labtium Aqua Regia leach with ICP-AES finish, method 510P, was used to assay base metal 
and sulphur, while Fire-Assay pre-concentration with ICP-AES finish, was used for precious 
metals.  Sulphide selective (Labtium 240P) and total leach (720P) techniques were used for 
QAQC purpose (Section 11.4).  Eighty samples were also assayed by Fire-Assay pre-
concentration with ICP-MS finish for all six Platinum-Group Elements, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and 
Pd, and gold.

11.3.2  ALS CHEMEX 
 
The analyses for samples from drill holes KAU09-039 to KAU09-050 were performed by 
ALS Chemex, an international laboratory group, with a base in Outokumpu, Finland.  All 
samples are registered and prepared in town of Outokumpu and analysed at the major ALS 
Chemex facility in Vancouver, Canada.  The laboratory methods used for the analyses are 
shown in Table 13.

be automatically re-analysed using these methods.   

 
 
11.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
The data used in the mineral resource estimation and the associated quality control and quality 
assurance (QAQC) data were provided to WGM by Nortec.  Nortec QAQC program 
comprised submitting sample blanks, standard reference samples, and inter-laboratory check 
samples.

Additional checks were done by commissioning of sulphide selective and total nickel analyses 
on duplicate pulps in a schedule depicted in Table 14.

11.4.1  SAMPLE BLANKS 
 
Nortec inserted 60 sample blanks at the frequency of c. 1/65.  Standards used, were AMIS 
(African Mineral Standards) 0025 and AMIS 0052, and an olivine diabase prepared by 
Nortec.  Indicated concentration values for the blank standards are: 
 

 Pd, ppb Pt Au Cu, ppm Ni 
AMIS 0025 ≤5 ≤5 ≤5   
AMIS 0052 ≤5 ≤5 1±0.4 7±2 4±2 
Olivine diabase Unknown 

 
Detection limits of the laboratories were: 
 

 Pd, ppb Pt Au Cu, ppm Ni 
Labtium 10 10 10 1 3 
ALS Chemex 5 5 1   

 
Performance of laboratories for precious metals is depicted in Figure 10.  Three samples, out 
of 52 assayed in Labtium, returned distinct anomalous values, most likely derived from 
sample preparation in Nortec facility or subsequently in the laboratory.  The anomalous low 
values of the sample 13 is real and correct as that sample was assayed by method 705P, which 
is otherwise identical with 704P, but is based on assaying of 50 g sub-sample after Fire-Assay 
pre-concentration.  Method 705P has detection limit of 5 ppb for precious metals.

Figure 10. Precious metal assay results of blank samples 

 
All eight blank samples assayed by ALS Chemex were olivine diabase.  Low number of 
samples renders it impossible to make any firm conclusions although results (see Figure 10) 
suggest that the chosen rock type may prove to be good source material for blank samples 
after further testing. 
 
Indicated values for base metals were only available for AMIS 0052, which was only assayed 
by Labtium with the results shown in Figure 11.  Results show clear contaminated samples or 
instrument "memory" from previous samples and instrument drift.  For Cu the indicated value 
of 7±2 ppm was not reached, the average being 22 ppm (excluding high peak of 700 ppm, 
sample 40).  Results for Ni were similar to Cu except that about one third of the assay results 
were within the range of indicated values for Ni (4±2 ppm).  The excess of Ni and Cu visible

11.4.2  REFERENCE MATERIAL 
 
Reference samples were inserted in the sample stream to check the accuracy of the assay 
laboratories.  Reference material was purchased from AMIS and comprised of four different 
certified standards prepared from Platreef (AMIS 0002 and 0056) and Merensky Reef (AMIS 
0009 and 0064) PGE and base metal deposits of the Bushveld Layered Complex, South 
Africa.  Each assay sample batch contained both Platreef and Merensky Reef references in 
equal number.  For drill holes KAU07-001 to KAU08-017 pair AMIS (0002-0009) was used, 
but was subsequently replaced by the pair AMIS (0056-0064) with DDH KAU08-017 having 
all four references (Table 17).  Totally 112 reference samples were inserted into the Kaukua 
sample stream of about 4,000 samples.

Figure 12 and Table 17 present the results of the reference samples assays for PGE.  In 
general, both laboratories used by Nortec (Labtium and ALS Chemex) succeeded to produce 
the recommended concentrations given by the reference provider.  Nevertheless, the results of 
the pair AMIS 0002/0009 (28 samples), exclusively analysed in Labtium, are rather 
systematically below the standard and in five cases 'off range' i.e. exceeding the standard 
deviation given by AMIS.  On the other hand, the laboratory performances with the pair 
AMIS 0056/0064 is better.  Sixty five of the pair AMIS 0056/0064 were assayed by Labtium 
and 19 by ALS Chemex.  The number of 'off range' readings were nine for Labtium and two 
for ALS Chemex.  Laboratory results for platinum are closer to recommended concentrations 
of standards than for palladium.  This may suggest slight 'less-than-real' values for Pd assay 
results for Kaukua core samples as well.  However, the extensive inter-laboratory check assay 
program (see Table 14) gave rather uniformly equal metal concentrations for each check 
sample lending support that there is no significant systematic difference between the 
laboratories and poorer performance with certain standards may be attributed to mineralogy 
and petrography of the standards, which might have been difficult to both laboratories.

0002 was excellent. 
 
Figure 13 and Table 13 present the results of the reference sample assays for base metals.  
Compared to PGE, the laboratory results were found to be better within the range of 
recommended values.  Instrument drift, however, is visible with some clear off-set values as 
well.  The off-set readings are well below recommended concentrations indicating more 
probably laboratory failure than contamination of the sample.

11.4.3  INTER-LABORATORY CHECK ASSAYS 
 
Before commissioning ALS Chemex at the beginning of the Fourth drilling phase 
(KAU09-039 ) Nortec sent a mix of pulps and coarse rejects, formerly assayed in Labtium, 
to ALS for due diligence.  Total amount of these inter-laboratory check samples were 443 of 
which 245 were pulps.  Sample selection represented different mineralization types and 
lithologies and covered drill holes KAU07-001 to KAU08-026. 
 
Plots of the assay results received from the two laboratories are depicted in Figure 14.  The 
match between the results was found to be good for all elements other than gold.  Statistics of 
inter-laboratory check assays is presented in Table 16.  Apart from Au, the calculated 
averages are close to each other with maximum difference of 4% in Cu.  Relative error is less 
than 10% in over 90% of the sample pairs again with the exception of Au.

laboratory check samples.  Precious metals in ppb and base metals in ppm

The poor reproducibility of gold assays is an ubiquitous feature for Kaukua mineralization, 
not only in inter-laboratory check samples, but also between pulp duplicates of 
intralaboratory checks as observed by GTK (Iljina et al, 2005).  This feature can likely be 
attributed to larger grain size (nugget effect) and petrographic properties of gold bearing 
minerals. 
 
11.4.4  DENSITY MEASUREMENT 
 
Nortec did not do density determinations of their own but used values measured by GTK from 
drill core and bore holes made in 1999 and 2004.  GTK surveys included laboratory 
measurements of c. 5 cm long drill core samples with 1 m spacing (1999 drilling) and 
downholes probing using a Wellmac Instrument, which measured point densities using a 
gamma-gamma method (2004 drilling).  WGM calculated averages for each mineralised rock 
type and used these values for the mineral resource estimate. 
 
11.5  WGM DUE DILIGENCE 
 
11.5.1  KAUKUA 
 
Thirty independent samples were collected from three drill holes of Kaukua for due diligence 
testing by WGM.  Each sample was quarter cut core representing the same intervals formerly 
sampled by Nortec.  Each sample was assayed using the Labtium sulphide specific method 
240P for base metals and fire-assay method 704P for precious metals.  The results are 
depicted in Figures 15 to 19.

Figure 19. Kaukua.  Nortec Au 704P versus WGM Au 704P, ppb 

 
The correlation between the WGM and Nortec assay results was found to be good but 
somewhat scattered, most likely due to the fact that a quarter core is compared to the original 
half core sample, although still from the same interval.  The widest scatter is in gold.  The 
Nortec nickel concentrations are systematically higher than the WGM sulphide specific 
concentrations due to the included silicate nickel, which is discussed in detail in Section 24.1. 
 



   

- 67 - 

11.5.2  HAUKIAHO 
 
A similar study, was also conducted for Haukiaho, where WGM collected 19 samples from 
four holes originally drilled and sampled by Swedish junior company NAN.  In addition to 
NAN, the Haukiaho deposit had also been drilled by Outokumpu and GTK.  The mineralized 
intervals in holes of the former had practically been exhausted in earlier sampling phases and 
adequate re-sampling was no longer possible.  The GTK holes were excluded because of the 
mode of in-house quality control using standards and blanks that GTK had in place. 
 
Instead of original laboratory certificates NAN's internal spreadsheets, provided to GTK for 
archiving, were used for due diligence.  Outcome of the due diligence in NAN's Haukiaho 
assay results is shown in Figures 20 to 24.  Equally good correlation was found between the 
WGM assay results and the NAN results as between the WGM and Nortec results in Kaukua, 
and with similar remarks on gold and nickel.

11.5.3  WGM CONCLUSION, QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY 
CONTROL 

 
It is the opinion of WGM that the assay results of the certified standards and results of the 
blanks, inter-laboratory duplicates, and WGM due diligence samples show that a reasonable 
level of confidence can be attributed to the drill sample assays used in the Mineral Resource 
Estimate of the Kaukua deposit. 
 
For the Haukiaho project assays were performed over a long time span, from the early 
eighties to 2004, and by three different laboratories commissioned by Outokumpu, GTK, and 
NAN.  However, given the existence of in-house quality control utilized by the GTK 
laboratory and the good correlation of WGM due diligence samples with the NAN assay 
results, WGM is sufficiently confident in the quality of data to support an Inferred Mineral 
Resources for the Haukiaho deposit, Section 14.

12.  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
 
Qualified Person, Markku Iljina ("MJI") carried out a field visit to Nortec properties, as well 
as company's field office and sample preparation facilities at Posio and Taivalkoski when 
preparing the Initial Report for Finore Joint Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp. in 2010.  
Discussion with technical personnel, were conducted whenever appropriate.  Site visits were 
also extended (in 2010) to Finland National Drill Core Depot at Loppi in order to collect 
check samples from historic Haukiaho drill holes.  About ten drill holes were studied during 
the site visit trips to verify the correctness of logs and logging procedures.  WGM collected 
55 drill cores samples (1/4 split core from sections and ½ core from new sections) to verify 
both Nortec (Kaukua) and historic (Haukiaho) assay results.  An additional 19 samples were 
taken from Haukiaho cores from zones of visible sulphide dissemination observed to extend 
outside of assayed intervals in the historic drill core. 
 
MJI made new site visits for the preparation of this report for the Finore Mining Inc. on 
October 19, and December 20, 2011.  This visit extended to company's office and sample 
handling facilities as well as to new properties acquired since the previous visit in 2010. 
 
Part of the data verification is also based on MJI previous experience conducting research and 
exploration in the Koillismaa area, including the Kaukua and Haukiaho targets, while 
employed by GTK from 1996-2005. 
 
Qualified persons, Markku Iljina and Clifford J. Duke carried out random check on the 
Kaukua database used in the Mineral Resource Estimate by comparing database to laboratory 
results and drill core logs.  QA/QC procedures are presented in Chapter 11.  Based on its 
verification of data reviewed, WGM finds the data to be of sufficient quality for use in a 
Mineral Resource Estimate. 
 
The database for the Haukiaho Mineral Resource Estimate was constructed by WGM from the 
files Nortec had acquired from GTK.  WGM also examined the Finland Mining Register, 
made available by the Ministry of Labour and the Employment dated October 28, 2011, to 
assure itself of the adequateness of the land tenure depicted in Tables 1 and 2.

13.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
 
13.1  GENERAL 
 
This Section describes mineral processing and metallurgical tests made by Finore's Joint 
Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp. 
 
The PGE enriched Cu-Ni sulphide deposits at Haukiaho and Kaukua are believed to host 
similar mineralization.  Preliminary metallurgical work was carried out on the Haukiaho 
deposit by North Atlantic Natural Resources in 2002 Although the work was preliminary in 
nature and used surface bolder material as samples, the results were similar to the more 
comprehensive mineralogy and metallurgical tests carried out on core samples from the 
Kaukua deposit in 2009 and 2010.  The following summarizes the most comprehensive results 
from the Kaukua testwork and are believed to be generally representative of both deposits at 
this early stage of process development work.   
 
13.2  SAMPLE MATERIAL TESTED 
 
Six separate samples of drill core from the Kaukua deposit were selected on the basis of 
variations in the lithology and style of mineralization.  Each of the samples was subjected to a 
head analysis and was used individually in the testwork as well as forming part of a master 
composite sample.  The composite was prepared using 60% pyroxinite, 15% peridotite, 5% 
gabbronorite and 20% mixed basement which is the estimated proportions that the deposit is 
believed to contain based on the current drilling.  The head analysis of the sample material 
tested is shown in Table 18.

13.3  MINERALOGY 
 
In 2009, a mineralogical study was carried out on core samples from the Kaukua deposit by 
SGS Vancouver using Quemscam, XRD and D-SIMS techniques and documented in a report 
entitled "The Mineralogy of Kaukua Samples, and It's Implication to Processing prepared for 
Nortec Ventures Inc" and dated July 22, 2009.  The study was carried out on a master 
composite sample and four separate samples selected on the basis of variations in the 
lithology.  The study focused on the distribution of the main sulphide minerals and the host 
rock mineralogy to guide the process development testwork.  The master composite was used 
to study the PGE and PGM occurrences relative to the sulphide minerals. 
 
The mineralogical analysis indicated that the sulphide composition was about 35% 
chalcopyrite and 17% pentiandite with the balance pyrite and pyrrhotite.  The main gangue 
and host mineral was talc at approximately 1.2%.  The PGE mineralogy had 10% as solid-
solution in pentlandite and 90% as discrete platinum-group minerals.  At the grind of 80% 
passing 75 microns the PGEs are 38% liberated PGM, 27% as PGE in the pentlandite or PGM 
as locked particles in sulphides, and 35% as PGM locked in silicates.   
 
Based on the relatively coarse grain size of the sulphides and the free PGM at a grind of 80% 
passing 75 microns the mineralogy work correctly concluded that a bulk sulphide float was 
the probable process route with the possibility of a regrind circuit.  It was concluded that the 
metallurgy was similar in nature to the Lac des Isles deposit.   
  
13.4  METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
 
Very preliminary metallurgical tests were carried out by Lakefield Research for North 
Atlantic Research on the Haukiaho deposit in 2005 on surface sample material to assess bulk 
sulphide flotation.  A summary of these results were documented by GTK in 2005 in a report 
entitled "The Haukiaho and Kaukua PGE-Cu-Ni-Au prospects in Koillismaa Layered Igneous 
Complex, Finland" published in 2005/1/10. 
 
In 2010, a series of process development tests were carried out at the SGS facility in 
Vancouver on 161 core samples from the Kaukua deposit selected from recognized variations 
in mineralogy and lithologies.  The results of the testwork were documented in a report 
entitled "Metallurgical Testwork on a Cu/Ni/PGE Ore from the Kaukua Deposit prepared for 
Nortec Minerals Corporation" dated August 19, 2010.  The scope of work included 
communition tests, preliminary optimization of liberation, flotation tests as well as testing the 
metallurgical response of recognized variations in the deposit lithology and mineralogy.  The 



   

- 74 - 

testing of bulk sulphide flotation was guided by the mineralogy work previously completed in 
July 2009.   
 
Preliminary testwork was also completed on production of a separate copper concentrate in 
addition to a copper-nickel-PGE concentrate.  Preliminary hydrometallurgical tests were 
carried out to assess leaching of the concentrate as an alternative to marketing a concentrate.   
 
13.4.1  COMMUNITION 
 
Communition tests were carried out on the four different styles of mineralization to determine 
the grinding power requirements.  The four different styles of mineralization were 
gabbronorite, peridotite, pyroxenite, and a mixed basement composite.  Bond work indices 
and semi autogenous grinding indices were determined for the four sample types as well as 
the grinding power requirements (CI) as determined by the CEET program.  Comparison of 
the results indicates significant variation in the grinding power requirements with 
gabbronorite composite requiring significantly more grinding than the peridotite.  This aspect 
of the project will require further testwork and attention to the probable mix of ore types that 
would be processed in a commercial operation to ensure the installed power in the grinding 
circuit will reach the desired capacity.  The communition test results are shown in Table 19.

Peridotite Composite 20.2 88.30 7.90 
 
13.4.2  FLOTATION TESTING 
 
A series of batch rougher flotation tests were carried out to compare the response under 
differing reagent dosages and grind sizes.  The tests indicated that a grind size of 80% passing 
80 microns was adequate with reagent dosages of 90 g/t frother and 60 g/t of collector 
yielding optimum flotation recovery.  Comparison of the results of each ore type showed that 
the flotation response of peridotite yielded the best recoveries.  Preliminary testing of stage 
grinding did not appreciably improve the results.   
 



   

- 75 - 

The flotation kinetics indicated that copper flotation was quite rapid with over 90% recovery 
reached in 12 minutes but the nickel recovery only reaching in the order of 51% and directly 
proportional to the nickel sulphide portion of the mineralization.  The other forms of the 
nickel occurrence do not respond to flotation concentration.  The rougher flotation indicated 
approximately 80% of the PGE are recovered as a high kinetic fraction with a slower portion 
of an estimated 4% not likely possible in a commercial flotation circuit.  The flotation testing 
indicated that the PGE portion would report with a 10 to 13% concentrate weight yield where 
93% of the copper was recovered and 51% of the Ni.  The indicated grade of the concentrate 
would be in the order of 16 to 17% Cu plus Ni.  The PGE recoveries indicated were 44 to 
50% for Pt, 68 to 69% for Pd and 70 to 76% for Au.   
 
The indications of testing regrind prior to the cleaner flotation step did not show any benefit 
to the grade or recovery with some tests showing a drop in recovery.  The cleaner circuit 
consisted of four stages with a scavenger stage on the first stage. 
 
A brief test work program was carried out to assess separation of the bulk flotation 
concentrate into separate copper and nickel concentrates.  The most successful test produced a 
copper concentrate of 26.4% copper and 73.6% recovery with 5.5% Ni at a 35% recovery.  
No further work was completed.   
 
The four variability samples were tested to the same optimized conditions and showed some 
variation in metallurgical response.  The results show that mixed basement and pyroxenite 
composites achieved a copper recovery above 93% with a 10% mass pull while gabbronorite 
recovery was 86.5 %.  Peridotite reached a copper recovery of 96% with a 30% mass pull due 
to the talc content.  Nickel recovery was about 62% for mixed basement and pyroxenite 
composites at 10% mass pull while nickel recovery from the gabbronorite was low at about 
40% due to the nickel contained in silicates.  The recovery of PGE from gabbronorite and 
pyroxenite was 60 and 75% respectively.  PGE recovery from peridotite was 30% at a 90% 
mass pull but this substantially reduced the Cu, Ni, and PGE grades. 
 
13.4.3  CONCENTRATE QUALITY 
 
The type of concentrate produced can result in limited smelter capacity to enable a high return 
on concentrate sales.  In addition to the copper and nickel grades the MgO content can have a 
negative impact on potential smelters and the return.  Test work on the Kaukua deposit 
demonstrated that the MgO in the bulk concentrate can be maintained in the acceptable 4% 
range with the use of depressants.  Separation of the concentrates into a copper concentrate 
and nickel concentrate may result in a nickel concentrate with a grade too low to market due 



   

- 76 - 

to the low head in the deposit that occurs as a recoverable nickel sulphide.  Indications from 
the test work are that a saleable concentrate can be produced by bulk sulphide flotation. 
 
13.4.4   CONCENTRATE LEACHING 
 
A sample of concentrate from the flotation testing on the Kaukua deposit was subjected to 
hydrometallurgy to leach the copper, nickel, gold, platinum, and palladium.  The process 
applied at SGS Lakefield was the PLATSOL process and the results are documented in a 
report entitled "Treatment of the Kaukua Concentrate using the PLATSOL Process 
Preliminary Assessment". 
 
In preparation for leaching the concentrate was ground to 80% passing 20 microns and 
subjected to a 10 g/l sulphuric acid leach at a temperature of 225°C and oxygen over pressure 
of 100 psi for 120 min.  Greater than 90% of the payable metals was leached with 99.8 Cu and 
98.8 Ni.  Test work did not proceed past leaching but it did demonstrate that high extractions 
to solution could be achieved.

14.  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
Mineral resource estimates of the polymetallic mineralization at Finore's Kaukua and 
Haukiaho deposits were completed for nickel, copper, cobalt, gold, platinum and palladium.  
The resources were estimated with Gemcom version 6.2.4, using data from 50 Finore holes 
(drilled by Nortec) and 10 historic holes for Kaukua, while all the Haukiaho holes were 
historic. 
 
Database used for Kaukua resource estimate was originally delivered in November 2010 for 
the Nortec report, while the database for Haukiaho was reassembled from historic databases 
acquired by Nortec from GTK and subsequently provided to WGM.  The digital drill hole 
data was provided in spreadsheets that were imported into Gemcom. 
 
14.1  DEFINITIONS 
 
The classification of mineral resources and mineral reserves used in this report conforms with 
the definitions standards provided in the final version of National Instrument 43-101 
("NI 43-101"), which came into effect on February 1, 2001, as revised on December 11, 2005.  
The Definitions Standards includes further changes to maintain compatibility with the new 
version of National Instrument 43-101, effective June 30, 2011.  We further confirm that, in 
arriving at our classification, we have followed the guidelines and standards by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") Council adopted on 
November 27, 2010.  The relevant definitions for the CIM Standards/NI 43-101 are as 
follows: 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid 
inorganic, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious 
metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and 
quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity 
of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge.   
 
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence 
and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and 
grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes. 
 



   

- 78 - 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application 
of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of 
the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced 
closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
 
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to 
confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated 
Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This 
Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that 
economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials 
and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined. 
 
A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated 
and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least 
a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate information on 
mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. 
 
A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured 
Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This 
Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that 
economic extraction is justified.   

 
 
14.2  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
 
Exploratory data analysis ("EDA") is the application of statistical tools to elucidate 
characteristics of the data, such as the shape of the relative frequency distribution and 
cumulative frequency distributions, as shown on histograms and probability plots, and 
statistics such as the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation.   



   

- 79 - 

 
The coefficient of variation ("CV") is the standard deviation divided by the mean.  This is a 
useful tool to measure the relative dispersion of a distribution.  A CV, which is less than one, 
generally depicts syngenetic deposits.  Coefficients of variation of one to two are typical of 
hydrothermal processes.  The presence of high-grade shoots or veins may cause the CV to 
reach three.  Where the CV is greater than three, the mixture of two or more distinct ore-
forming processes (or mineralization) can sometimes be identified.   
 
The CV's for the resource elements of each deposit are tabulated in Table 20, and suggest that 
high grade zones may be present in the Cu and Au sample populations used to estimate the 
Kaukua resource. 
 

TABLE 20. 
COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION FOR MAJOR ELEMENTS 

Element Kaukua Haukiaho 
Co 1 1 
Cu 3 1 
Ni 2 1 
Au 4.22 2.01 
Pd 1.88 1.45 
Pt 1.7 1.16 

 
Identification of the spatial continuity by means of variography is an EDA tool, which is later 
used to perform kriging.  Variography is used as part of the kriging parameters allowing the 
software to assign weights to the sample points.  Kriging weights are estimated based on 
spatial autocorrelation between sample points.  Kriging is typically used for spatial prediction 
where the data are expected to follow a trend varying in both mean (expected value), and 
variance by location.   
 
In general, variography is done on composite-sized volumes, which are nominally of equal 
length.  This is because the variance of a distribution is inversely proportional to the volume 
of sample used.  Use of unequal length composites can distort the frequency distributions and 
make variography very noisy.   
 
14.2.1  KAUKUA ASSAYS 
 
A total of 4,577 assay intervals from the 50 Finore holes and 10 historic R series drill holes 
were used to define the zone of mineralization of the deposit.  Data analysis was conducted by 
creating probability and histogram plots of the major economic elements.   
 



   

- 80 - 

The Co probability plot (Figure 25) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
straight line on the cumulative probability curve, with a secondary, higher grade population of 
assays >200 ppm.   
 

 
Figure 25. Kaukua.  Data analysis for Co 



   

- 81 - 

 The Cu probability plot (Figure 26) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
slightly curved line on the cumulative probability curve, with a sharp break, and linear 
extension above 8,000 ppm suggesting a secondary high grade population.   
 

 
Figure 26. Kaukua.  Data analysis for Cu 



   

- 82 - 

The Ni probability plot (Figure 27) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
straight line on the cumulative probability curve.  A second population of higher grade 
samples is indistinct, but seems to exist above 2,500 ppm.

- 83 - 

The Au probability plot (Figure 28) exhibits a lognormal population up to 1 ppm.  Above 
1 ppm the distribution becomes erratic with no clear trend.  This suggests that capping the 
high grade outliers at 1 ppm is appropriate.

- 84 - 

The Pd probability plot (Figure 29) shows a lognormal population, up to 5 ppm.  A sharp 
break in the slope of the cumulative probability curve at 5 ppm suggests that a secondary 
population may exist.  All values remain close to the original trend and no capping is needed.

The Pt probability plot (Figure 30) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
straight line on the cumulative probability curve.  No capping is necessary.

14.2.2  HAUKIAHO ASSAYS 
 
A total of 1,612 assay intervals were identified for the Haukiaho deposit.  The drill holes 
included 37 drill holes on the Finore owned claims, eight drill holes on a claim that Finore has 
applied for on the eastern end of the deposit (Haukiaho 11), and three holes that lay outside 
the claim boundaries.  Different sampling campaigns have produced sample intervals that 
would locally overlap each other.  Two separate assay tables were set up to handle this.  Each 
assay table was composited separately, although the same composite parameters were used for 
each table.  The sample composites were then combined for the grade estimation routine.  
Most of the overlapping sample intervals were created by sampling for different elements.  
Where overlapping sample intervals were created for the same element, two composites 
would be used by the estimation routine, for the same drill hole interval.   
 
The Co probability plot (Figure 31) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
straight line on the cumulative probability curve.  The data points depart from the main trend 
above 250 ppm, suggesting that capping at 250 ppm would be appropriate.   
 

 
Figure 31. Haukiaho.  Data analysis for Co  



   

- 87 - 

The Cu probability plot (Figure 32) seems to exhibit a slope change at 1,000 ppm suggesting a 
secondary high grade population.  The higher grades remain on slope and do not require 
capping.

The Ni probability plot (Figure 33) seems to exhibit a lognormal population, defined by a 
straight line on the cumulative probability curve.  No capping is necessary.

- 89 - 

The Au probability plot (Figure 34) exhibits a lognormal population up to 0.5 ppm.  Above 
1 ppm the distribution is not clear, but seems to maintain a linear trend, suggesting that 
capping the high grade outliers is unnecessary.

- 90 - 

The Pd probability plot (Figure 35) seems to exhibit a smooth lognormal population, up to 
1 ppm.  A sharp break in the slope of the cumulative probability curve at 1 ppm suggests that 
capping the higher grade values at that point is appropriate.   
 

 
Figure 35. Haukiaho.  Data analysis for Pd 

 



   

- 91 - 

The Pt probability plot (Figure 36) seems to exhibit a smooth lognormal population, up to 
0.4 ppm.  A sharp break in the slope of the cumulative probability curve at that point suggests 
capping the higher grade values at that point is appropriate.

14.3  BULK DENSITY 
 
Density measurements have been taken by two different methods on each of the properties.  
Laboratory measurements of the rock density have been recorded, and in-situ densities have 
been recorded by down hole surveys using a Wellmac Instrument probe that measured point 
densities with a gamma-gamma method.  The Wellmac densities have not been used, due to 
their wider variation, and the existence of actual rock density measurements. 
 
14.3.1  KAUKUA 
 
There are 925 density measurements (Figure 37) recorded for the 2007 "R" series of GTK 
drill holes.  The author has cross referenced the rock type at the point where the density was 
measured, and estimated an average density for each of the main rock types from this data.  
The average density for each rock type was then applied to each sample interval in the 
database.   
 
14.3.2  HAUKIAHO 
 
There are 2536 density measurements (Figure 38) recorded for the "R" series of drill holes.  
The author has cross referenced the rock type at the point where the density was measured, 
and estimated an average density for each of the main rock types from this data.  The average 
density for each rock type was then applied to each sample interval in the database.   
 
14.4  GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION 
 
Both the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits have been interpreted as parts of a layered mafic 
igneous complex.  The rocks hosting the deposit include pyroxenites, peridotites, and gabbros.  
Geological modelling is limited to the defining the mineralization zone that is contained 
within the complex.  An estimated net value was determined for each assay in the database.  
This value was calculated using the formula: 
 
(Co ppm * $45)+(Cu ppm * $7.5)+(Ni ppm * $21)+(Au ppm * 42000)+(Pd ppm * 17500)+(Pt ppm * 52000) 
                                                                                 1000 

 
Metal values used are approximate three year average price per kilogram, in C$.  These values 
are not intended for economic analysis, but rather to standardize the values of the different 
metals to a common point, for modelling purposes.

14.4.1  KAUKUA 
 
The deposit was modelled on a series of vertical east looking sections across the deposit on 
25 m spacing, which approximated to the spacing and primary orientation of the drill holes.  
Rings constraining the mineralization were digitized on the sections where drilling was 
present.  Net values greater than C$40 were included inside the wireframe.  A second set of 
north looking sections was created on 50 m spacing, and a second set of rings was digitized 
on these sections, linking the first set of vertical section rings together. 
 
A series of three holes, about 500 m south of the deposit contained significant mineralized 
sections (Figure 39).  These intersections were modelled as a separate entity and are referred 
to as the "South zone".  Based on current drilling, the south zone is not connected to the main 
zone, as the distance between the intersections is too great. 
 

 
Figure 39. Typical section with digitized rings (Kaukua 3553525E) 

 
From these two sets of rings, wireframes were created that contained the bulk of the 
mineralization (Figure 40).  Wireframe models are typically rendered to make them easier to 
interpret visually.  The wireframe was verified as mathematically correct in Gemcom, and 
visually correct by comparison with the drill holes.  Zones of mineralization were identified in 
the drill holes by intersecting the drill holes with the wireframe. 



   

- 96 - 

 
Figure 40. Oblique view, looking north-east, of digitized rings (Kaukua) 

 
Wireframes were created for two different zones of mineralization (Figure 41).  The largest 
wireframe (Main) was given a rock code of 100 to identify it for the estimation routine.  The 
second wireframe (South), lies further to the south and was assigned a rock code of 120.   
 

 
Figure 41. Rendered Kaukua wireframes of mineralized zone (red) and diabase (green) 

 



   

- 97 - 

An additional wireframe model of the diabase was also created.  The diabase is interpreted to 
be a later stage geological intrusion, that cross cuts the mineralization.  The volume of the 
mineralized envelope that intersects the diabase was removed from the mineralized zone prior 
to estimation. 
 
The topography around the Kaukua deposit is relatively flat lying.  A topographic surface 
provided by Nortec matched the drill hole collar elevations well, and was used for this 
estimation.  A bedrock surface was created from the overburden lower contacts as listed in the 
drill logs. 
 
14.4.2  HAUKIAHO 
 
The Haukiaho deposit was modelled on a series of vertical sections striking 005º Az across 
the deposit on 50 m spacing.  Rings constraining the mineralization were digitized on the 
sections where drilling was present.  Net values greater than $40 were included inside the 
wireframe.  An additional ring was digitized in plan view to link the sections together.  The 
deposit is divided into three different zone, East, Central, and West.  Each zone is given its 
own rock code to identify it during the grade estimation procedure.  The three zones are 
separated by two major faults that cross cut the Haukiaho deposit.  These were modelled as 
surfaces, and the mineralized envelopes were trimmed at the fault surfaces to more accurately 
reflect the offset at the fault.  In addition, a late diabase intrusion was also included in the 
model (Figure 42).  The mineralized envelope was trimmed with the diabase prior to resource 
estimation. 
 

 
Figure 42. Rendered wireframe of Huakiaho deposit showing faults and diabase (looking south) 

 



   

- 98 - 

An additional surface representing the bedrock surface was created from the diamond drill 
hole logs.  A "best fit" surface was created using the basal contacts of the overburden.  The 
bedrock surface was used to trim the upper extent of the mineralized envelope. 

 
14.5  SPATIAL ANALYSIS 
 
When frequency distributions are skewed, a very small number or proportion of samples may 
represent a large amount of the contained metal in the resource.  Frequently these samples 
may be scattered through the deposit and not restricted to spatially identifiable or continuous 
zones.  Sometimes small clusters of high-grade mineralization may be present, and it may or 
may not be possible or practical to restrict their influence.  Other times the very high-grade 
samples may be the result of laboratory errors; pulps sometimes segregate high specific 
gravity materials like electrum or pyrite and may produce biased results if the pulps are not 
re-homogenized prior to aliquot selection for analysis.   
 
Even when the assays are valid, linear interpolation (weighted average) grade estimation 
methods can be adversely affected.  When these methods are used, the inclusion of a high-
grade sample will have a greater influence on the estimate than a lower grade sample.  This 
can lead to undue projection (or smearing) of the effect of high-grade material into areas for 
which there is no evidence in hand that the high-grade material continues to occur.  Under 
such circumstances, restriction of the influence of the higher grade material is mandatory.   
 
14.5.1  KAUKUA CAPPING 
 
Cumulative probability curves were plotted for each of the major elements.  On the basis of a 
review of probability and histogram plots, it was concluded that there is reasonable 
justification for capping the gold values.  The sulphide elements appear to have a secondary 
linear trend, possibly reflecting some secondary enrichment.  After analyzing the assay data 
for the Kaukua deposit, the capping system was applied (Table 21).

14.5.2  HAUKIAHO CAPPING 
 
Cumulative probability curves were plotted for each of the major elements.  On the basis of a 
review of probability and histogram plots, it was concluded that the capping protocols would 
be implemented (Table 22).

14.5.3  COMPOSITES - KAUKUA 
 
Core length statistics indicate that the average sampling interval is 1.1 m, and the maximum 
sample length is 3 m.  Only seven samples are greater than 2 m long.  Based on this 
information, and on block size, two metre long composites were created.  This length allowed 
for a few samples of greater length to be broken, without affecting the variance and shorter 
samples to be combined to produce a sample of proper support.   
 
Assays were composited into 2 m downhole lengths honouring the interpreted geological 
solids.  No composites were generated outside the 3D wireframe.  If the drill hole intervals 
within the solids were not assayed, sample composites were not generated for that section of 
the drill hole.   
 
Commonly the compositing of downhole assays results in a fractional length for the last 
sample in a given hole.  Composite remnants, which are composites less than 2 m in length, 
are unavoidable if the hard geological boundaries are to be honoured.  WGM did not use 
composites less than one metre long in estimating the grade.

Figure 43. Kaukua sample lengths 

 
 
14.5.4  COMPOSITES - HAUKIAHO 
 
Core length statistics show a wide variation in sample length.  Both the mean and median 
sampling intervals are about 1.4 m, but the maximum sample length is nearly 20 m (Sample 
149664 DDH R617).  Some of these very long samples occur in drill holes that are not used to 
define or estimate the mineralized envelope.  Some are only partially contained within the 
mineralized envelope.  There are 11 sample intervals more than 4 m long, and an additional 
56 are greater than 3 m long, in the database.  Longer composites will tend to "over smooth" 



   

- 101 - 

grade variances in the resource.  Based on this information, and on block size, 4 m long 
composites were created.  This length allowed for a few samples of greater length to be 
broken, without affecting the variance, and shorter samples to be combined to produce a 
sample of proper support.

Assays were composited into 4 m downhole lengths honouring the interpreted geological 
solids.  No composites were generated outside the 3D wireframe.  If the drill hole intervals 
within the solids were not assayed, sample composites were not generated for that section of 
the drill hole.   
 
Commonly the compositing of downhole assays results in a fractional length for the last 
sample in a given hole.  Composite remnants, which are composites less than 4 m in length, 
are unavoidable if the hard geological boundaries are to be honoured.  WGM did not use 
composites less than two metres long in estimating the grade.   
 
14.5.5  VARIOGRAPHY 
 
Identification of the spatial continuity within a deposit is by means of variography, which is 
later used to perform kriging.  Variography is used as part of the kriging parameters that allow 
the grade estimation software to assign weights to the sample points, based on their direction 
and distance from the block being estimated.  Kriging weights are estimated based on spatial 
autocorrelation between sample points.  Kriging is typically used for spatial prediction where 
the data are expected to follow a trend varying in both mean (expected value), and variance by 
location.  In general, variography is done on composite-sized volumes, which are nominally 
of equal length. 
 
Variograms were generated only for the Kaukua deposit using the 3D Variography function 
contained within Gemcom.  There was insufficient data for the Haukiaho deposit to warrant 
generating variograms.  The variogram parameters generated are listed in Table 23.

14.6  RESOURCE BLOCK MODEL 
 
14.6.1  KAUKUA DEPOSIT 
 
A block model (Table 24) was generated in Gemcom using a 10 m x 10 m x 3 m block size.  
A smaller vertical block size was used to reflect the increased vertical variability of the 
deposit.  Gemcom defines the block model origin using a minimum X, minimum Y, 
maximum Z format.

Within the block model, folders were set up for Rock Type, Density, Percent, Co_ ppm, 
Cu_ ppm, Ni_ ppm, Au_ ppm, Pd_ ppm, Pt_ ppm, Au-ID and Ni-ID.   
 
Each of the wireframe zones identified in the Kaukua deposit was coded with a different rock 
type number.  The Rock Type folder was updated so that any blocks touching the wireframe 
were given the Rock Type code of that wireframe.  This insured that assay values in one part 
of the mineralized zone did not 'cross over' between the zones during the estimation process. 
 
The Percent model folder contains values that represent the percentage of the block that is 
inside any particular wireframe.  The percent model is used to estimate the tonnage of the 
block that was contained within the wireframe. 
 
The various element folders contain the grade estimates for their respective elements.  Grades 
in these folders were estimated using ordinary kriging ("OK").  The Au-ID and Ni-ID folders 
contain the grade estimates for their respective elements.  Grades in these folders were 
estimated using an inverse distance method ("ID").  This was done to verify the estimation.

14.6.2  HAUKIAHO DEPOSIT 
 
A block model was generated in Gemcom using a 25 m x 25 m x 25 m block size (Table 25).  
The rather large block size is a reflection of the low data density available for the Haukiaho 
deposit.  Gemcom defines the block model origin using a minimum X, minimum Y, 
maximum Z format.

Within the block model, folders were set up for Rock Type, Density, Percent, Co_ ppm, 
Cu_ ppm, Ni_ ppm, Au_ ppm, Pd_ ppm, and Pt_ ppm.   
 
Each of the wireframe zones (West, Centre and East) identified in the Haukiaho deposit was 
coded with a different rock type number.  Individual block models were created for each of 
the zones, where the Rock Type folder was updated so that any blocks touching the 
wireframe, was given the Rock Type code of that wireframe.  This insured that assay values 
in one part of the mineralized zone did not 'cross over' between the zones during the 
estimation process. 
 
The Percent model folder contains values that represent the percentage of the block that is 
inside any particular wireframe.  The percent model is used to estimate the tonnage of the 
block that was contained within the wireframe. 
 
Once the block values were interpolated, the partial models were combined to create a 
Standard model for reporting purposes.

The Kaukua deposit resource estimate was prepared using OK, and the Ni and Au results 
were checked using an ID method.  The estimations were designed as a two pass system.  The 
first pass estimated a block only if a minimum of two drill holes and three data points were 
found within the restrictive search ellipsoid equalling the Ni variogram range (Figure 45).  
The second pass allowed a block to be interpolated if it was not interpolated during the first 
pass, and if a minimum of two data points from were found within a sample search ellipsoid 
equal to four times the Ni variogram range.  Table 26 summarizes the search distances and 
right hand rotations for estimating a block, as well as minimum and maximum number of 
composites required.

Search ranges for the first pass were based on the Ni variogram ranges.  The second pass 
ranges are equal to 4x the Ni variogram ranges, and were implemented to populate those areas 
of the model where drilling was more widely spaced.  The Ni variogram was used as a 
baseline, as it is the primary economic component of the Kaukua deposit. 
 
14.7.2  HAUKIAHO DEPOSIT 
 
The Haukiaho deposit resource estimate was prepared using an ID method.  The estimations 
were designed as a two pass system.  The first pass estimated a block only if a minimum of 
two drill holes and three data points were found within the restrictive search ellipsoid that was 
slightly larger than the section spacing.  The second pass allowed a block to be interpolated if 
it was not interpolated during the first pass, and if a minimum of two data points from were 
found within a sample search ellipsoid large enough to populate most of the blocks in the 
model.  Table 27 summarizes the search distances and right hand rotations for estimating a 
block, as well as minimum and maximum number of composites required.

14.8  MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
Several factors were used to determine the mineral resource classification: 
 
• CIM requirements and guidelines; 
• Experience with similar deposits; 
• Spatial continuity of the deposit; and 
• Confidence in the data. 
 
No known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or 
other relevant issues are known to the authors that may affect the estimate of a mineral 
resource.  Mineral reserves can only be estimated on an economic evaluation that is used in a 
Prefeasibility or a Feasibility study on a mineral project, thus no reserves have been 
estimated.  As per NI 43-101, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 
economic viability.   



   

- 107 - 

Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into 
Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.  An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level 
of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource.  An Indicated Mineral 
Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower 
level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource.   
 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated 
or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration.  Confidence in the 
estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic 
parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure.  
Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility 
or other economic studies. 
 
14.8.1  KAUKUA DEPOSIT 
 
The Kaukua deposit resource is divided between indicated and inferred resources.  In most 
areas, the drilling is too widely spaced to verify the continuity of grade between the drill 
holes.  In the interpolation process, these were areas where the blocks did not generally fall 
within the variogram range of two drill holes.  Of the 26,485 blocks that represent the 
mineralized zone, only 3024 were assigned values in the first pass of the estimation routine, 
which required samples from two different drill holes to be within the variogram range.  The 
section of the deposit that was comprised largely of the blocks identified in the first pass, was 
classified as an indicated resource.  The indicated resource is outlined in Figure 46. 
 
14.8.2  HAUKIAHO DEPOSIT 
 
The Haukiaho deposit resource is classified as an inferred resource (Figure 47).  The drilling 
to date is too widely spaced to verify the continuity of grade between the drill holes.  The 
mineralized envelope has been interpreted on most sections on the basis of a single drill hole. 
 
The claim that covers the eastern end of the deposit was not wholly owned by Finore at the 
time this report was prepared.  As such, the resources in that claim are tabulated separately.

14.9  MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION 
 
14.9.1  KAUKUA 
 
The mineral resource estimate for the Kaukua deposit is tabulated in Table 28.  Ordinary 
Kriging was used to estimate the resources in the Kaukua deposit.  Due to the presence of 
several metals contributing to the value of the deposit, a contained metal value approach was 
used to define the lower cutoff.  The lower cutoff of C$50/tonne was defined using the 
formula:   
 

(Co ppm * $45)+(Cu ppm * $7.5)+(Ni ppm * $21)+(Au ppm * 42000)+(Pd ppm * 17500)+(Pt ppm * 52000) 
1000 

 
Metal values used are approximate three year average price per kilogram in C$.  These values 
are not intended for economic analysis, but rather to standardize the values of the different 
metals to a common point.

14.9.2  HAUKIAHO 
 
The mineral resource estimate for the Haukiaho deposit is tabulated in Table 29.  An inverse 
distance squared (ID) method was used to estimate the resources in the Kaukua deposit.  Due 
to the presence of several metals contributing to the value of the deposit, a contained metal 
value approach was used to define the lower cutoff.  The lower cutoff of C$50/tonne was 
defined using the formula:    
 
(Co ppm * $45)+(Cu ppm * $7.5)+(Ni ppm * $21)+(Au ppm * 42000)+(Pd ppm * 17500)+(Pt ppm * 52000) 
                                                                                 1000 
 
Metal values used are approximate three year average price per kilogram in C$.  These values 
are not intended for economic analysis, but rather to standardize the values of the different 
metals to a common point.  The resource is categorized as an inferred resource.

The Haukiaho deposit extends eastward onto a claim (Haukiaho 11) which Finore has the 
right to acquire, however because this transaction is not yet completed WGM has prepared an 
stand alone resource estimate for this claim The inferred resource that lies on that claim is 
tabulated in Table 30.

14.10  BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
 
14.10.1 KAUKUA 
 
The Kaukua deposit mineral resource estimate was validated by: 
 
• Comparing contained metal differences between OK and ID estimation methods;  
• Visual comparison of block grades with drill hole assays; and 
• Comparison with previous estimates. 
 
Both OK and ID methods are globally unbiased.  Introducing a lower cutoff grade introduces 
a bias.  Comparing the contained metal predicted by the OK estimate with the ID estimate 
(Table 31) provides a global evaluation of the resource estimate.  OK is a generally preferred 
method for block estimation, as it takes block size into account.

Ordinary Kriging produced global grade estimates that are very similar to that predicted by 
the ID method.  This comparison illustrates that the resource estimate is sound, but the block 
values in the ID resource estimate are less variable than those of the OK estimate. 
 
A comparison with the previous estimate, prepared by WGM in February 2011 indicates that 
the current estimate has a slightly lower tonnage, at a slightly higher grade.  This is consistent 
with the changed metal valuations used in this report.

20.  ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMIT, AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 
 
None of the Finore's properties are located on or near any nature conservation areas, with the 
closest being Kaukua North 3, which is 1.8 km from a Natura 2000 program area.  Natura 
2000 is a nature conservation program established according Finnish national legislation and 
in accordance to directive given by European Union.  Natura legislation entail that all actions 
taking place in or outside of the area should be assessed for its possible impacts on the Natura 
area.  Finore's properties are in the River Iijoki drainage basin and some of the waters down 
river belong to Natura 2000.  This is not categorically preventing mining, but necessitates 
appropriate consideration in the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure. 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment (ympäristövaikutusten arviointimenettely, YVA) 
procedure as defined by Finnish national legislation and authority instructions forms the basis 
for environmental permitting process.  Finore or any preceding property owners have not 
done base line or other environmental studies to document the present conditions and status of 
environment, which would form the first step in YVA procedure. 
 
About 1.5 km of the strike length of anticipated Lipeävaara mineralized zone locates under 
the lake Kulojärvi while the documented and anticipated mineralized zones in all other Finore 
properties are virtually in forested and swampy lands. 
 
Mining on Finore's properties would affect living of the people in the hamlets of Kaukua, 
Kuloharju and Sirniö (Figure 2) and relocation of some people is unavoidable in the case 
mining of the delineated Kaukua deposit.  The anticipated mineralized zone of Lipeävaara 
runs mostly in permanently inhabited area and larger number of relocations of people would 
be required if mining takes place on Lipeävaara property.  In contrast, Murtolampi, Haukiaho, 
and Haukiaho east lack permanent settlement.   
 
Finore's property regions have mining heritage as the Mustavaara Fe-Ti-V mine was in 
operation in 1974-1985.  The positive impact of the mining on the local economy is still 
visible in number of metal workshops, some of which are today emerged to global 
manufacturing companies as exemplified by Telatek oy.  The positive attitude of people in 
average is expressed by the decision of the Municipality of Taivalkoski to become a 
shareholder to Mustavaaran Kaivos oy, who is currently studying technical possibilities to re-
open the old mine.

Based on WGM's observation during the site visits, all personnel working on the project were 
equipped with appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) and adhered to industry safety 
practices and guidelines.   
 
All field work (to the extent observed) was carried out with due respect to environmental 
guidelines and Mining Act.  WGM is not aware of any difficulties with the local community 
or authorities, and is not aware of any environmental or labour related rulings against the 
company.

23.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
 
As of October 28, 2011 there were no nearby (5 km radius) claims or claim reservations 
adjacent to Nortec's claims/claim applications except for the Haukiaho east 1 claim 
application, which touches a claim application of Kevitsa Mining oy, a Finland daughter 
company of First Quantum Minerals Ltd (see Figure 9).  Mustavaaran Kaivos oy application 
for mining concession locates about 1.6 km from Finore claim application area. 
 
Within the same belt of layered intrusion complexes hosting the Koillismaa Complex, mining 
is currently taking place at Kemi (close to Tornio, see Figures 3), 160 km to the west, for 
chrome.  Mining concession has also been granted for exploitation of Suhanko contact-type 
PGE-Cu-Ni deposit at Portimo Complex (Figure 3) located 95 km to the west.

24.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 
24.1  DISTRIBUTION OF METALS BETWEEN SULPHIDE AND SILICATE 

PHASES 
 
This study was originally prepared for NI 43-101 report for Finore Mining Inc.'s Joint 
Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp. 
 
WGM as part of its NI 43-101 data review carried out a study to define the inter-element 
ratios in the sulphide fraction composition.  One objective of the study was to examine the 
distribution of the metals between the silicate and sulphide phases, presented here.  The full 
version of the study is presented in the Appendix 1. 
 
Thirty-three samples, each about one metre long of quarter core, were collected from three 
drill holes and each sample was subjected to total and sulphide selective assays using Labtium 
methods 720P (total) and 240P (sulphide specific).  Details of the assay methods are presented 
in Tables 12 and 13.  The difference in metal concentrations received by these two methods is 
believed to be indicative of the amount of metal tied up in the silicates and hence 
unrecoverable during sulphide flotation.  In addition to the WGM due diligence samples, the 
Nortec database of Labtium 240P assay results was also incorporated, increasing the number 
of holes for which the comparative analysis was undertaken to seventeen, also covering all the 
rock types hosting the Kaukua ore. 
 
Mineralogical studies indicate, that Cu, PGE, and Au, are carried almost exclusively by 
sulphide minerals chalcopyrite, pentlandite, pyrrhotite and pyrite or other minerals susceptible 
to sulphide flotation.  The Ni and Co are also hosted in silicates in addition to the sulphides.  
The principal Ni and Co carrying silicates are olivine, pyroxene, chlorite, serpentine, talc and 
amphibole.   
  
In order to determine the proportion of nickel reporting to the silicates, a comparison between 
assay methods 510P and 240P was made (Figure 50).  The analysis reveals that "silicate 
nickel" can vary in a wide range.  A sample which assayed 2,000 ppm Ni (using assay 
technique 510P) may have recoverable Ni content (using assay technique 240P) of ranging 
from 1,400-1,900 ppm and silicate nickel range of 100-600 ppm.  Given to similar leaching 
technique and ICP-AES finish these results received for Labtium 510P would be applicable 
also for ALS Chemex ME-ICP41 results.

500 ppm of total Ni for the gabbroic host and at 1,000 ppm for the ultramafic host.  These 
values approximate the theoretical quantity of silicate nickel in the rock types mentioned.

Figure 52, compares partial 510P and sulphide specific 240P assay results for cobalt.  The 
comparison indicates that the cobalt from silicate minerals is 0-50 ppm in a range of 0 to 
150 ppm of cobalt in 510P results.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the distribution of nickel and cobalt between 
the sulphide and silicate phases. 
 
• The nickel occurring in silicate minerals ranges from 100-600 ppm in Labtium 510P / 

ALS Chemex ME-ICP41 assay results (see Figure 50); 
• The cobalt occurring in silicate minerals ranges from 0-50 ppm in the range of 0 to 

150 ppm Co in Labtium 510P / ALS Chemex ME-ICP41 assay results (see Figure 52); 
and 

• Silicate nickel contents in gabbroic and pyroxenitic host rocks are c. 500 
and c. 1,000 ppm, respectively (see Figure 51). 

 
24.2  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  
 
Corporate social responsibility ("CSR") policies are seen as the manifestation of a company's 
approach to addressing the interests, concerns and objectives of various stakeholders 
(including national, regional government, local authorities, indigenous people, local 
communities, employees and competitors) and their often-varying needs.  Finland has a 
history of applying stringent environmental, health & safety and worker protection laws to its 

Co 510P ppm

mines.  Sound CSR policies and practices may significant enhance the likelihood of a 
project's success and would minimize potential project delays. 
 
As part of its project risk assessment WGM undertook a review of Nortec's CSR policies and 
programs.  While there is no universally accepted metric for measuring CSR performance, 
WGM has applied the United Nation's Global Compact as its yardstick for evaluating Nortec.  
WGM has used a self-administered questionnaire that company officials completed to 
evaluate their compliance with twenty-two principles in areas of human rights, labour, 
environment and anti-corruption.   
 
While WGM has determined that Nortec does not have a formal CSR policy, the company 
does have policies that address the core issues that collectively define CSR. 
 
The results of the self-evaluation are as follows:  
 
• Human Rights.  Nortec has put in place policies designed to promote: 

 Safe and healthy working conditions; 
 Ensure non-discrimination in hiring practices; 
 Prevent the hiring of forced and / or child labour; 
 Ensuring that the company's operations do not displace individuals, groups or 

communities;  
 Protect the security and safety of local communities through adherence to international 

guidelines and standards for securing their operations; and 
 Protection of worker's human rights.   

 
• Labour Standards.  Policies are in place that: 

 Ensure the rights of workers to join trade union; 
 Respect the rights of unions to organize and advance the interests of workers; 
 Ensure that employment contracts clearly state the terms and conditions of service, the 

freedom of workers to leave, etc.; 
 Clearly state the procedures for recruitment, placement, training and advancement; 

and 
 Provide grievance procedure to address complaints, handle appeals and provide 

recourse for employees.   
 

• Environment.  The company promotes greater environmental responsibility through the 
application of the following: 

 A Code of Conduct that confirms the company's commitment to minimize the impact 
of its operations on the environment; 

 Policies that promote the 'triple bottom line' of sustainable development; 
 Working with suppliers improve environmental performance in the supply chain; and 



   

- 123 - 

 Procedures to measure, track, and communicate sustainability principles into business 
practices that conform to international best practice. 

 
• Anti-Corruption.  Nortec has developed policies to: 

 Combat corruption; and  
 Report progress (e.g., Annual Report, news releases) to regulators, investors, 

employees, and communities. 
 
Based on these results, WGM's observations during its field visit and general knowledge of 
the company's operations in Finland, WGM has concluded that Nortec has accepted CSR as 
part of its corporate ethos, which is expected to minimize the potential risks associated with 
future CSR obligations. 
 
24.3  PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY-UNIVERSITY RESEARCH 

PROJECTS 
 
Finore Mining continues participation in a collaborative Industry-University research project 
titled Beneficiation of Platinum-Group Minerals in Sulphide-Poor Platinum Deposits – 
BEPGE, headed by the University of Oulu.  This collaboration was initiated by Nortec 
Minerals.  The second phase of this (BEPGE2) started early in 2010 and is ongoing.  It 
includes the Department of Geosciences and the Department of Process and Environmental 
Engineering from the University, GTK, and about ten corporate partners represented by 
mining companies, laboratories, and instrumentation technology companies.  
BEPGE/BEPGE2 projects research beneficiation by performing mineralogical/petrological 
studies and testing various rock communition, flotation and other mineral procession methods. 
 
Nortec and subsequently Finore have committed to expend totally € 40,000 for two years in 
BEPGE2 projects.  Within the project several tens of samples have been sent for testing and a 
M.Sc. Study is currently underway.  WGM finds this collaboration project supportive for the 
efforts to improve recovery of metals in the concentration processes.

25.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
The Koillismaa Layered Igneous Complex ("KLICK") in Finland, hosting Finore's LK 
Project, is one of the largest among the c. 2.45 Ga old Fennoscandian mafic layered 
complexes comparable to such world-class complexes as the Duluth Gabbro.  The Koillismaa 
complex has an estimated magma volume greater than 2,000 km3.  These volumes of basic 
magma provide large reservoirs of metals for ore forming processes and the Fennoscandian 
complexes are host to a number of known mines, chrome (Kemi), Fe-Ti-V oxides 
(Mustavaara) and Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides (Monchegorsk). 
 
The contact-type base metal – platinum-group element mineralization hosted by the 
Koillismaa Complex has a significant potential for economic deposits.  Finore's properties 
cover about 26 km of the estimated 100 km total strike length of the favourable contact zone 
which varies in thickness from metres to several tens of metres.   
 
Mineralization in the contact-type deposits is particularly concentrated in favourable 
structural positions, where the PGE-reef comes in contact with the marginal series due to 
angular discordance between marginal and layered series units.  This kind of structural setting 
is found in the northern Kaukua Block.  Higher than average PGE tenor and numerous PGE 
enriched pockets have been encountered at Kaukua which are unknown elsewhere in the 
Koillismaa complex.   
 
A similar favourable structural setting has also been speculatively interpreted for the 
projection of the PGE reef encountered in drilling on Finore's Haukiaho claim which is 
supported by the relatively higher metal tenor observed in historic drilling.   
 
WGM concludes, based on the above structural interpretation and observations, that, further 
exploration warranted with good potential that it hosts economically significant mineral 
resources.   
 
There is also significant potential for gold on the Finore properties.  Koillismaa contact type 
base metal – PGE mineralization is characteristically enriched in gold with the Pt/Au ratio 
often being close to one.  The Archean footwall gneisses below the Koillismaa layered 
intrusions is pervasively sodium metasomatised giving rise to albite-quartz rock (ab-qz rock).  
The high Pt/Au ratio in the Koillismaa contact-type shows a rough positive correlation with 
the thickness of the footwall albite-quartz rock.  The Haukiaho area has hundreds of metres of 
ab-qz rock bordering them on the footwall side and the Pt/Au ratio is close to one.  An erratic 
high gold intersection of one metre @ 3.0 ppm Au has been encountered at Haukiaho. 



   

- 125 - 

The metasomatism, that produced the ab-qz rock, is interpreted to slightly predate mafic 
magmatism and where present in large volume, to have been the source rock of large 
quantities of metals including gold.  WGM suggests that the extensive fluid activity, the 
observed ab-qz metasomatism and the documented presence of gold, may provide a new 
avenue for exploration. 
 
WGM has determined that Finore's Joint Venture partner Nortec has compiled and generated 
sufficient exploration data and that the data is of sufficient quantity and quality to warrant the 
preparation of a the mineral resource estimate following the guidelines and definitions 
adopted by the CIM for both the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits presented herein.   
 
The comparison of in situ metal values per tonne of ore of Finore's Kaukua and Haukiaho 
deposits (Table 35) shows that precious metals (Pd, Pt, and Au) constitutes approximately 
50% and 20% respectively of the total values of the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits, half of 
the remaining value being in nickel.  This emphasises the importance of precious metals and 
nickel recoveries and metallurgical test work focussed on maximizing the recoveries of these 
metals.   
 
The comparison shown previously in Table 35 also indicates Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits 
to have similar in-situ metal grades, but having lower tonnages compared to some other 
similar contact-type deposits in production or in advanced development stage.   
 
With respect to geophysical exploration, the evident disseminated character of the 
mineralization, as described in core logs, supports the demonstrated effectiveness of IP, but 
also suggests that mineralization is unlikely to be conductive on any practical scale, and hence 
likely not amenable to effective utilization of conventional EM whether in airborne, ground or 
borehole surveys, although magnetotellurics could help map deeper portions of the KLIC. 
 
Based on the descriptions of mineralization and photos of selected mineralized core samples 
and the present review of the available maps and reports on past surveys, as well as from 
extensive experience in exploring other similar mafic/ultramafic complexes, the surveys are 
judged to have been sensibly conceived and satisfactorily executed, plotted and qualitatively 
interpreted.  The qualitative geophysical interpretation advanced in the reports reviewed is 
judged to be sensibly grounded in both the survey data and geophysical understanding.

However, quantitative interpretation, via modelling of the geophysical features observed over 
the mineralized zones and incorporating physical property measurements to guide both 
forward and inverse modelling, appears not to have been undertaken, and could play a useful 
role as deeper drilling is undertaken.  In particular, before finalizing further drill targeting, it 
would be strongly advised to carry out additional data processing, analysis and interpretation 
of the recent 3D IP survey by SJ Geophysics, to ensure that the computed inversions are not 
distorted by various reported data acquisition problems or by computational artifacts and 
satisfactorily represent the significant variations in resistivity and chargeability.

26.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
WGM recommends that Finore continues exploration program to upgrade the quality and 
quantity of the mineral resources at Kaukua and Haukiaho.  Compilation and review of all 
existing data, including analytical and metallurgical test work can also help to focus 
exploration.  Preliminary metallurgical work should also be extended to further investigate 
maximizing the recoverability of PGE, as well as, Ni and Cu.  Exploration to test the potential 
of the Lipeävaara, Murtolampi and especially Haukiaho east targets is also warranted. 
 
Specifically WGM recommends additional diamond drilling at Kaukua and Haukiaho.  The 
drilling should focus both on exploring the extensions of the mineral resource at Kaukua and 
infill drilling to upgrade the quality of the mineral resource at Haukiaho.  This would include 
drilling to test areas of the property where the mineralized marginal series is known to occur 
close to surface (Lipeävaara and Murtolampi) but has not been tested at depth.   
 
WGM believes continuing the preliminary review of the existing analytical database, started 
by WGM as part of its due diligence work for this report will enable Finore to enhance its 
exploration targeting.  WGM's preliminary study of the composition of the sulphide fraction 
shows, that valuable information for guiding both exploration and metallurgical test work can 
be acquired from appropriate chemical analyses.  Therefore the inclusion of sulphide selective 
and total whole-rock analyses to the analytical scheme is strongly recommended. 

 
Finore has developed an exploration budget estimate (Table 36) of C$5.20 million to meet 
their exploration commitment to earn 49% interest of the Project by the Second anniversary of 
the Option and Joint Venture Agreement with Nortec Minerals Corp. Based on this schema 
Finore has contracted 10,000 m drilling program and started its execution in Haukiaho target 
on November, 2011. 
 
Given the extensive strike length (~100 km) of the favourable host for potential contact-type 
PGE-Au-Cu-Ni mineralization in the Koillismaa Complex as well as to the Complex's 
potential to host reef type PGE deposits and chrome deposits, WGM encourages Finore to 
also look for other potential areas for acquisition. 
 
As part of the future exploration and evaluation efforts, it is recommended to Finore carry out 
a more complete quantitative interpretation of prior geophysical surveys.  This re-
interpretation, which should incorporate or be constrained by measured physical properties, 
would provide important insights related to pursuing mineralization at depth and to 
identifying and testing weak, secondary targets along strike from known mineralization.  This 



   

- 129 - 

should be complemented by careful re-processing, re-analysis and re-evaluation of the actual 
data for the 2008 3D IP survey.

Future exploration at Kaukua and Haukiaho by deeper drilling to extend the known 
mineralized trends along strike should utilize appropriate advanced surface geophysical 
exploration techniques as well as borehole geophysics, depending on the particulars of the 
mineralization encountered, host characteristics and depth.   
 
Advanced IP methods, coupled with detailed magnetic surveys, are clearly the geophysical 
tactics most likely to yield relevant exploration information and targets.  EM is discernibly 
less applicable than IP in further exploration for additional zones of disseminated Cu-Ni-PGE 
sulphide mineralization in the unexplored sectors of the marginal series of the KLIC, but it 
would be useful to re-examine any available AEM and aeromagnetic data acquired by GTK 
and predecessor companies in this district.   
 
Deep exploration of the marginal series of the KLIC might be aided by magnetotellurics 
and/or high-resolution seismic reflection surveying where considered appropriate, but would 
need to be preceded by a reasonably comprehensive study of physical property measurements, 
including the seismic properties of the KLIC units and underlying Archean basement. 



   

- 130 - 

 
Borehole geophysical methods should also be considered in support of deeper drilling, 
Borehole methods have greatly assisted in the continuing deep exploration and discoveries at 
Sudbury and elsewhere.  Pertinent down hole methods could include:  
 
• Down hole magnetics to locate and characterize magnetic mineralization, particularly off-

hole; and 
• Down hole IP/Resistivity to characterize sulphide mineralization on a volumetric basis, 

and/or to search for off-hole mineralization. 
 
Additional metallurgical test work is also required.  In order to improve the metal recovery, 
the focus of these studies should be to understand the distribution of PGE between the base 
metal sulphides and PGM and the nickel distribution between sulphides and silicates.

APPENDIX 1: 
WGM STUDY ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE SULPHIDE FRACTION

WGM STUDY ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE SULPHIDE FRACTION 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This study was originally prepared for NI 43-101 report for Finore Mining Inc.'s Joint 
Venture partner Nortec Minerals Corp. 
 
WGM as part of its NI 43-101 data review carried out a study to define the inter-element 
ratios in the sulphide fraction composition.  The main objective was to study the 
representativeness of the metallurgical test sample, the amount of recoverable nickel, and the 
accuracy of the assay methods used to measure it. 
 
Some metals, in the Kaukua and Haukiaho deposits, particularly the nickel and cobalt, are 
distributed between silicate and sulphide minerals (phases) in the rock.  The distribution of a 
metal between silicate and sulphide phases effects the metal recoverability as the metals 
bound to silicates tends not to be recovered in a sulphide flotation.   
 
Definition of the terms used in the following discussion: 
 
Recoverable and sulphidic 
nickel, Nis-wr  

The amount of nickel occurring as sulphide minerals and 
therefore amenable to recovery in sulphide flotation 

Silicate nickel  The amount of nickel occurring as silicate minerals 
Total nickel The amount of nickel occurring as both silicate and sulphide 

minerals 
Metal concentration in 
sulphide fraction, Msf  

The amount of metal in the 100% sulphide concentrate 
extracted from the rock 

 
Thirty-three samples, each about 1 metre long of quarter core, were collected from three drill 
holes and each sample was subjected to total and sulphide selective assays using Labtium 
methods 720P (total) and 240P (sulphide specific).  Details of the assay methods are given in 
Table 12 of this report.  The difference in metal concentrations obtained by these two methods 
is interpreted as being the amount tied up in the silicates and hence not recoverable by 
sulphide flotation.  In addition to the WGM samples, the Nortec database of Labtium 240P 
assay results were also used, which increased the number of holes analysed to seventeen 
which covered all the rocks types hosting the Kaukua ore. 
 
BASE METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN KAUKUA SULPHIDE FRACTION 
 
Mineralogical studies indicate, that Cu, PGE, and Au, are carried almost exclusively by 
sulphide minerals chalcopyrite, pentlandite, pyrrhotite and pyrite or other minerals susceptible 
to sulphide flotation and Aqua Regia leach of methods Labtium 510P and ALS Chemex ME-
ICP41.  Whereas some of the Ni and Co are also hosted in the silicates in addition to the 
sulphides.  The principal Ni and Co carrying silicates in Kaukua rocks are chlorite, serpentine, 
talc and amphibole.  Primary magmatic carriers, olivine and pyroxene, are mostly 
decomposed, but occasionally form almost 100% of the rock.

Both Labtium and ALS Chemex describe the assay methods used (Labtium 510P and 
ME-ICP41) as partial and the Ni derived from silicates in the assay results is dependent on the 
silicate mineralogy due to sample leaching techniques.  In order to determine the proportion 
of silicate nickel, a comparison between analytical methods 510P and 240P was made (Figure 
1).  The analysis reveals that surplus nickel (derived from silicates) can vary in a wide range.  
A sample which assayed 2,000 ppm Ni (510P) may have recoverable Ni content (240P) 
of c. 1,400-1,900 ppm and surplus Ni accordingly 100-600 ppm.   
 

 
Figure 1.  Nortec / Kaukua Ni assays (510P) versus sulphidic Ni (240P) 

Points closer to intersecting 1:1 line have lesser amounts of silicate hosted nickel. 
 
 
Figure 2 depicts the sulphidic nickel versus the total nickel within ultramafic and mafic host 
rocks.  The 240P/720P trend line intersects zero sulphidic nickel at 500 ppm of total Ni for the 
gabbroic host and at 1,000 ppm for the ultramafic host.  These values approximate the 
quantity of silicate nickel in the rock types mentioned, but do not provide the means to assess 
the recoverable amount of nickel in the Kaukua deposit since both 240P or 720P analytical 
methods are not available for all samples.

The mineralogical work, by SGS, indicated sulphide minerals to be almost exclusively 
composed of chalcopyrite, pentlandite, pyrrhotite and pyrite, approximately in the proportions 
shown in Table 1.  The sulphur content of these minerals falls within a narrow range (33.5-37 
wt% S), except for pyrite which is richer in sulphur.  Based on the Nortec lithological logs, 
pyrite is only seen to occur in higher quantities in the basement rocks, which make up only a 
subordinate proportion of the entire ore.  Changes in the relative amounts of other sulphide 
minerals have only marginal effect on the sulphur content of the sulphide fraction.  The 
following calculations, using the formula stated below, are based on the assumption that the 
sulphide fraction contains 37 wt% S (Table 1): 
 
Msf = (37:S)*Ms-wr, in which 
Msf is concentration of metal in the sulphide fraction, 
Ms-wr is sulphidic amount of metal in the sample, and 
S is whole-rock sulphur content of the sample. 
(all concentrations in percent)

The nickel and copper concentrations of the sulphide fraction are plotted against whole-rock 
sulphur in Figures 3A and B.  The calculated Ni sulphide fraction content varies between 
4-6 wt% over the S content of 0.3-2 wt%.  This nickel content is slightly less than recovered 
in the metallurgical tests, which indicated 7 wt% for Ni.  The plot for Cu (Figure 3B) is more 
scattered probably due to susceptibility of copper to metamorphic mobility.  The sample in the 
concentration tests carried 0.6 wt% S and the sulphide concentrate contained 14 wt% Cu.  
This value plots well within the scatter in Figure 3B.

Another approach was made by analysing the relationship between recoverable nickel content 
and whole-rock sulphur as shown in Figure 4.  A rather good correlation between these 
components is indicated.

Figure 5 compares partial 510P and sulphide specific 240P assay results for cobalt.  The 
comparison indicates that the excess cobalt from silicate minerals is 0-50 ppm in a range of 
0 to 150 ppm of cobalt in 510P assay results.

PRECIOUS METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN KAUKUA SULPHIDE FRACTION 
 
Precious metal concentrations can also be calculated to 100% sulphides.  The calculation is 
justified by their tendency to float together with base metals in sulphide flotation although the 
metals are not always present as sulphide minerals in Kaukua.  The PGE+Au concentration 
versus the whole-rock sulphur comparison produced a very scattered image (Figure 6).  The 
metallurgical tests indicated a precious metal content between 80-100 ppm for the sulphide 
concentrate, which plots in the middle of the scatter.

CONCLUSIONS ON KAUKUA SULPHIDE FRACTION COMPOSITION 
 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of inter-element relationships of 
the base and precious metals and sulphur. 
- The recoverable nickel almost linearly follows the whole-rock sulphur over the range 

0.3-1.5 wt% S (Figure 4).  The whole-rock sulphur content can also be used as an 
indicator for the recoverable nickel. 

-  The nickel occurring in silicate minerals ranges from 100-600 ppm in Labtium 510P / 
ALS Chemex ME-ICP41 assay results (Figure 1). 

-  The cobalt occurring in silicate minerals is 0-50 ppm for samples containing 0 to 150 ppm 
of cobalt in 510P assay results (Figure 5). 

 - The sulphide fraction of the sample processed in the metallurgical tests was representative 
of all three main components (Ni, Cu, and PGE+Au) for Kaukua ore with only minor 
difference in nickel content (Figures 3 to 6). 

-  Silicate nickel contents in gabbroic and pyroxenitic host rocks are c. 500 
and c. 1,000 ppm, respectively (Figure 2). 

-  The sulphide fraction of the Kaukua deposit is lower in nickel, approximately equal in 
copper, and higher in precious metals when compared to the Haukiaho deposit, described 
below.

CONCLUSIONS ON HAUKIAHO SULPHIDE FRACTION COMPOSITION 
 
A similar analysis made on the Kaukua deposit was also made on the composition of the 
Haukiaho sulphide fraction based on 41 samples from four drill holes.  The sulphide 
mineralogy observed in Haukiaho (Kojonen and Iljina 2001) is similar to that of the Kaukua 
deposit and hence the sulphide fraction calculations were made on a similar basis.  Results are 
depicted in Figures 7 to 9.  Results of metallurgical test referred in these Figures refer to 
results reported by Lakefield Research (Lakefield Research 2001) to NAN.   
 
The WGM study shows that the Haukiaho sulphide fraction is richer in nickel, about equal in 
copper, and lower in precious metals compared to that of Kaukua.  The calculated nickel 
concentrations in the sulphide fraction (Figure 7) scatter in a wide range, but cluster between 
8-10 wt% Ni in samples having c. 0.7-1.3 wt% S.  On the same whole-rock sulphur range, the 
copper in the sulphide fraction fluctuates around 15 wt% (Figure 8).  The precious metals 
(Pt+Pt+Au) show a rather narrow scatter close to 40 ppm over the whole-rock sulphur content 
0.5-1.3 wt% S (Figure 9).
