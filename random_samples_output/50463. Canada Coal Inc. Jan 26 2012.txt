1.0 SUMMARY 
Associated Geosciences Ltd. has been retained by Canada Coal Inc. to provide an independent 
technical report compliant with the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-
101 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) as well as the Geological Survey of Canada 
Paper 88-21 (A Standardized Coal Resource/Reserve Reporting System for Canada) . The 
technical report summarizes available technical material and scientific information relating to 
Canada Coal Inc's coal exploration licenses in the high Arctic Archipelago of Canada. 

Sources of information for the technical report include historic reports produced in the 1980s by 
Gulf Canada Resources Inc., Utah Mines Ltd., Petro-Canada Exploration Inc., and the Canadian 
Exploration and Geological Services Unit as well as two recent independent technical reports 
commissioned by West Hawk Development Corporation and by Weststar Resources 
Corporation. Associated Geosciences Ltd. conducted a current personal site inspection in August 
2011 to verify historic exploration accounts.  

Canada Coal Inc.'s project is located on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands, Nunavut Territory, 
Canada. The project consists of 75 active coal exploration licenses geographically distributed as 
nine discrete exploration areas occupying a total of area of 988,918 ha. Coal licenses are held by 
the Corporation's two wholly-owned subsidiaries: 5200 Nunavut Ltd. and Canadian Sovereign 
Coal Corp. The exploration areas consist of: Fosheim Peninsula, Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord, 
Strathcona Fiord, Vesle Fiord/South Fosheim, May Point, Bache Peninsula, Li Fiord, Good 
Friday Bay, and Mokka Fiord. Associated Geosciences Ltd. refers to the collective property 
position as the Nunavut Coal Project.  

Accessibility to the project is via chartered fixed wing aircraft or helicopter. The closest 
settlement in the project vicinity is Eureka, a government run weather facility with a permanent 
runway reportedly capable of handling Hercules Transport aircraft. At the time of Associated 
Geosciences Ltd.'s site assessment the Eureka runway was in need of repairs, however, it was 
still accessible by Twin Otter, DC-3, or similar tundra tired aircraft. 

Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands are typically divided into three major geological units: 1) 
Precambrian basement rocks, 2) the Franklin sedimentary succession, and 3) the Sverdrup Basin 
sedimentary succession. The rocks generally young to the northwest, and are separated from 
each other by major regional unconformities. 

The coal measures of the Nunavut Coal Project occur within the Sverdrup Basin, an elongate 
pericratonic depression overlying older strata. The principal coal bearing unit comprises the late 
Cretaceous and Tertiary Eureka Sound Formation which consists of rhythmically interbedded 
dark grey shale, mudstone and siltstone, buff to light grey quartzose sandstone, minor 
conglomerate and coal. Coal seams of varying degrees of thicknesses, aerial extent, quality, and 
structural deformation are reported to occur throughout the project. The seams are typically 
between 0.5 and 1.0 m thick, but in some locations attain thicknesses of several metres. 

Fosheim Peninsula is the most widely explored area within the Nunavut Coal Project, and 
remains a priority target for further work. At Fosheim Peninsula, the Eureka Sound Formation is

3,200 metres thick and is coal bearing throughout. Multiple seams up to fifteen metres in 
thickness reportedly exist in the area, although the maximum thickness encountered during the 
AGL site assessment was 4.2 metres. Coal seams at Fosheim Peninsula range in rank from high 
volatile bituminous 'C' to lignite. The coal seams are laterally persistent and can be traced up to 
twenty-five kilometres along strike. 

The majority of exploration on the Nunavut Coal Project occurred during 1981 to 1983 and was 
conducted by Gulf, Petro-Canada, and Utah.   

Petro-Canada's 1981 reconnaissance program on the Fosheim Peninsula and Vesle Fiord/South 
Fosheim exploration areas concluded that significant resources of lignite, sub-bituminous and 
high-volatile bituminous coal existed within the Eureka Sound Formation on Axel Heiberg and 
Ellesmere Islands. Petro-Canada's 1982 and 1983 reconnaissance programs determined the 
approximate areal extent, thickness tonnage, and quality of coal seams within the Fosheim 
Peninsula, Vesle Fiord, Strathcona Fiord, and Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord areas. Utah's 1981 
reconnaissance mapping and sampling program on the Strathcona Fiord and May Point areas 
concluded that further mapping was required as a precursor to drilling. Gulf's 1981 exploration 
program examined four exploration areas including Fosheim Peninsula and May Point and 
speculated that lignitic to sub-bituminous A coal was present within the Fosheim Peninsula area 
in sufficient abundance to have potential for economic exploitation. 

Recent exploration activity on the Nunavut Coal Project has been limited to AGL's current 
personal site inspection and a similar site assessment conducted by APEX in 2005. West Hawk 
commissioned a NI 43-101 compliant technical report in 2007 on their Fosheim Peninsula and 
May Point coal exploration licenses; however, no site assessment or follow-up field work 
resulted from West Hawk's NI 43-101 to the best of the author's knowledge. 

Sample results from the recent AGL and APEX site inspections confirm historic reports that the 
coals in the Nunavut Coal Project vicinity range in rank from high volatile bituminous 'C' to 
lignite. Coals are generally low in ash (5-10%) and sulphur (<0.5%), although occasionally 
exhibit moderate ash values. Coals are considered to be suitable for use as a high quality thermal 
coal. Fosheim Peninsula remains the most prospective area for identifying a higher quality coal 
resource as coal rank at Fosheim Peninsula has been shown to increase with depth. 

Numerous historical inferred and in-situ coal resource estimates have been reported for the 
Nunavut Coal Project. The historic coal resources estimates comply with the speculative coal 
resource category in GSC 88-21 which no longer conforms with best practices in coal resource 
estimation, further mapping, trenching/sampling and drilling will be required to develop an 
appropriate resource estimate. AGL is treating the historic coal resource estimates as a potential 
target size which has been confirmed by the recent personal inspection.  

The potential quantity and grade of coal is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient 
exploration to define a coal resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the 
targets being delineated as a coal resource.

5 High volatile bituminous covers a broad range of coal quality- recent sampling would suggest that the Fosheim   
Peninsula coal is a high volatile bituminous 'C' 

Associated Geosciences Ltd. recommends a two phase work program on the order of $16.2 
million including contingency for the Nunavut Coal Project. Phase 1 will consist of 
reconnaissance including mapping and sampling, and Phase 2 will primarily be focused on 
drilling and resource delineation. The aim of the work program will be to prioritize target areas 
and identify a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate within the project area if possible. 
Appropriate archaeological studies, palaeontolgical studies, cultural studies, community 
consultation, and program permitting will need to be conducted prior to commencement of the 
exploration program. 

Although the appropriate project authorizations for Phase 1 exploration have not yet been 
approved, the planned exploration will have a relatively small impact on the environment and 
could provide considerable socio-economic benefit to the community. Although AGL cannot 
speak for the various Authorizing Agencies reviewing the project applications, it is the author's 
opinion that Canada Coal stands a reasonable chance of getting Phase 1 approvals provided that 
they: 1) do not intend to conduct exploration anywhere on Axel Heiberg Island, 2) do not intend 
to conduct exploration at Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord without further community consultation due to 
the sensitivity of the area, 3) maintain rigorous environmental monitoring protocols for all 
exploration areas particularly the Fosheim Peninsula, 4) set aside and preserve the fossilized 
forest within the Mokka Fiord area, 5) and continue with extensive community consultation 
throughout the project's lifecycle.

The logistics of shipping a bulk commodity such as coal from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago 
remain challenging; however, the enormous potential target size of the coal resource within the 
Nunavut Coal Project warrants further exploration.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
Associated Geosciences Ltd. ("AGL") has been retained by Canada Coal Inc. ("Canada Coal" or 
"the Corporation"), a Canadian corporation formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario 
which holds various coal licenses on Ellesmere Island and Axel Heiberg Island of Nunavut 
Canada, for consultancy services. Canada Coal was formerly known as the entity Pacific Coal 
Corp. ("Pacific Coal"). 

The purpose of the report is to provide an independent technical report compliant with the 
Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101) Form 43-101 F1 
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as well as the Geological Survey of Canada paper 
88-21 ("GSC 88-21"), A Standardized Coal Resource/Reserve Reporting System for Canada. 
The technical report summarizes available technical material and scientific information relating 
to Canada Coal's prospects in the high Arctic. 

AGL has not prepared an estimate of coal resources or coal reserves at this time as we deem 
there is currently insufficient geological and technical information relating to the coal prospects 
to conduct mineral resource estimation. Nevertheless, we have reported historical coal resource 
estimates herein as an indication of the potential target size for future proposed exploration. We 
caution that the reported historical coal resource estimates are non-compliant with current NI 43-
101 standards and should not be relied upon other than as speculative exploration targets.  

Under the guidelines of NI 43-101, the technical report must be prepared by or under the 
supervision of one or more qualified persons. The qualified persons for this report are Keith 
McCandlish, P.Geol., P.Geo., and Susan O'Donnell, P.Geol., both of whom are full-time 
employees of AGL and are employed as Managing Director and Project Geologist, respectively.  

2.1 Sources of Information and Data 
This report has been prepared by AGL for Canada Coal. The information contained herein is 
reliant upon historical reports as well as two more recent independent technical reports 
commissioned by West Hawk Development Corporation ("West Hawk") and by Weststar 
Resources Corporation ("Weststar").  

AGL is reliant on the following historical reports prepared by Gulf Canada Resources Inc. 
("Gulf"), Utah Mines Ltd. ("Utah"), Petro-Canada Exploration Inc. ("Petro-Canada"), as well as 
the Canadian Exploration and Geological Services Unit ("Canadian Geological Services Unit"): 

• Cain, T.W. "Coal in the Arctic Archipelago," Exploration and Geological Services Unit, 
Oil and Mineral Division, Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Canada, 1973. 

• Panchy, E.G., and Moorhouse, J.M. "Ellesmere Island Coal Project- 1982 Exploration 
Report," Petro-Canada Exploration Inc., Coal Department, 1983. 

• Santiago, S.P. "Ellesmere Island Coal Project- 1983 Exploration Report," Petro-Canada 
Exploration Inc., Coal Department, 1984. 

• Unknown. "Arctic Coal Exploration Geological Report," Gulf Canada Resources Inc., 
1982.

The Nunavut Coal Project 
 
Prepared for Canada Coal Inc.  P a g e  | 2 
 

 
Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

AGL is also reliant upon two more recent independent technical reports prepared by APEX 
Geosciences Ltd. ("APEX") and Weir International, Inc. ("Weir") for Weststar and West Hawk, 
respectively, as follows: 

• Besserer, D., P.Geol. "Technical Report for the Ellesmere Island Coal Project, Nunavut, 
Canada," APEX Geosciences Ltd., Edmonton, Alberta, July 2009. 

• Tveten, T., CPG. "Technical Report, Nunavut Coal Prospect," Weir International, Inc., 
Illinois, U.S.A., March 2007. 

AGL has been able to confirm the presence of widespread coal occurrences within the Canada 
Coal property as a result of the August 2011 personal site inspection (detailed in Section 2.2). 
The site assessment and data verification program was conducted in accordance with NI 43-101 
guidelines and current industry best practices. AGL has not seen any evidence to indicate that 
historical work should not be relied upon.  

AGL is reliant upon Loring Laboratories (Alberta) Ltd. ("Loring Laboratories") and JP 
Petrographics, both of Calgary Alberta, for laboratory analyses relating to the AGL site 
assessment samples.  

Coal license ownership information has been provided to AGL by Canada Coal. AGL has not 
researched property title or coal rights and expresses no opinion as to the ownership status of the 
licenses which are the subject of this report. The coal licenses are listed on the Department of 
Indian and Northern Development- Northwest Territories Region's Spatially Integrated Dataset 
Viewer Online ("SID Viewer") as being in good standing (active). 

2.2 Status of Current Personal Site Inspection 
As mandated by NI 43-101, AGL is required to complete a current personal inspection of 
property that forms the subject of the technical report detailed herein. The site assessment was 
completed between August 9, 2011 and August 27, 2011 by Keith McCandlish, P.Geol., P.Geo., 
and Susan O'Donnell, P.Geol., both full-time employees of AGL.  

The objectives of the site assessment included: 

1. To confirm the existence of widespread coal deposits on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg 
Islands as described in historic exploration accounts, and to get a preliminary indication 
as to the potential target size of coal resources in the license areas. 

2. To assess current high Arctic logistics as well as available local resources to assist 
planning of any future exploration programs. 

3.  To gain an idea of the scale and scope of work necessary to delineate exploration targets. 
AGL compiled a list of historic coal occurrences, and prioritized these targets in terms of 
significance and proximity to Canada Coal's license areas. AGL then prepared a list of planned 
fly-over routes and ground assessment of targets, to be accompanied by additional groundwork 
as warranted. Helicopter support was required due to the size of the property position, site 
accessibility conditions, as well as time constraints.

Intended site visit targets on Ellesmere Island included the following areas: Fosheim Peninsula 
(West of the Sawtooth Range), Stenkul Fiord, Sor Fiord, Vendom Fiord, Strathcona Fiord, 
Vessle Fiord, and the Bache Peninsula. Intended site visit targets on Axel Heiberg Island 
included May Point, Mokka Fiord, Stor Island, Good Friday Bay, and Li Fiord. 

Due to adverse weather conditions and time constraints, AGL was only able to assess the 
following areas: Fosheim Peninsula, Stenkul Fiord, Sor Fiord, Vessle Fiord, and Mokka Fiord. 
AGL considers that Fosheim Peninsula and Stenkul are, at this stage, the primary targets on the 
Canada Coal licenses and are therefore satisfied that the site assessment meets the criteria as 
described by NI 43-101. 

AGL notes that originally the site assessment had been scheduled for June 2011; however it was 
postponed until August 2011 as a result of a fuel shortage in the high Arctic. 

2.3 Units 
All measurement units in this report conform to metric usage within the context of the 
International System of Units (SI) except where stated otherwise.  Currencies are expressed in 
the Canadian Dollar (C$) unless otherwise stated. 

All geographical coordinates listed in this report correspond to the World Geodetic System 1984 
("WGS 84") except where stated otherwise. 

The term "coal resource" and/or "coal reserve" conform to the usage defined in GSC 88-21 and 
the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, whose usages are 
incorporated by reference in NI 43-101. 

2.4 Effective Date 
The effective date of this report is September 30th, 2011. The preparation date of the report is 
January 13th, 2012.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
As mentioned previously in Section 2.1 (Sources of Information and Data), AGL is reliant upon 
various historical and more recent reports relating to Arctic coal for the purposes of preparing 
this technical report. The most recent APEX and Weir reports have been prepared by 'qualified 
persons' as defined by NI 43-101.  

Some of the authors of the historic Gulf, Utah, Petro-Canada, and Canadian Geological Services 
Unit reports are known by Keith McCandlish and would be termed 'Qualified Persons' as 
defined by NI 43-101. All available evidence suggests that the historic reports were prepared by 
competent professionals and can therefore be relied upon for information relating to prospective 
coal targets. 

Various coal experts have contributed to recent coal analyses including Loring Laboratories 
(Alberta) Ltd. ("Loring Laboratories") and JP Petrographics, both of Calgary Alberta. AGL has 
reported the sample results herein as represented by the various analytical experts.  

Also as previously mentioned in Section 2.1 (Sources of Information and Data), AGL is reliant 
upon Canada Coal for coal license ownership information. AGL has reviewed the coal 
exploration licenses that form the subject of this report using SID Viewer and can report that the 
licenses are listed as being in good standing (active). AGL has reviewed various purchase 
agreements by which Canada Coal (or Pacific Coal under its previous name) acquired some of 
the coal licenses that form the subject of this report, and have also reviewed the Canadian 
Territorial Coal Regulations regarding exploration licenses. AGL has not researched property 
title or coal rights and expresses no opinion as to the legal ownership status of the licenses as the 
AGL is not qualified to do so.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
Canada Coal's Nunavut Coal Project consists of 75 coal exploration licenses geographically 
distributed into nine separate land areas. Altogether, the coal exploration licenses occupy a total 
of 988,918 ha (2,442,627 acres). Coal licenses are held by the Corporation's two wholly-owned 
subsidiaries: 5200 Nunavut Ltd., and Canadian Sovereign Coal Corp. 

4.1 General Location 
The land areas are primarily situated in Nunavut Territory, Ellesmere Island (Figure 4.1). Some 
of the project land area is also situated in Nunavut Territory's Axel Heiberg Island. Ellesmere 
and Axel Heiberg Islands are located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and form part of the 
Queen Elizabeth Islands. Politically, the prospects fall within the Qikiqtaaluk administrative 
region of Nunavut, also occasionally referred to as the Baffin region. 

Ellesmere Island is the most northerly island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and its 
northernmost tip (Cape Columbia) forms the most northerly point in Canada. Ellesmere Island's 
approximate position is between 76-84 degrees north latitude and 62-97 degrees west longitude, 
encompassing a land mass of roughly 200,000 square kilometres. It is home to three settlements: 
Grise Fiord, Eureka, and Alert. 

Grise Fiord, located at 76° 25'34" north latitude and 82° 54'34" west longitude, is known as 
Canada's northernmost civilian settlement and hosts a population of 141 residents according to 
the Canada 2006 Census. Grise Fiord is located 410 kilometres (or 220 nautical miles) south-
southeast of Eureka, a government run research station and military base.  

Eureka, located at 79° 59' north latitude and 85° 49' west longitude on the northwest coast of 
Ellesmere Island (Slidre Fiord), is the closest year-round settlement to the bulk of coal 
exploration licenses. Eureka does not have any permanent residents; however, it is staffed year-
round by shift personnel.  

The Canadian Forces maintain a permanent station at Alert, located on the northernmost point of 
Ellesmere Island. According to the Canada 2006 Census, the population of Alert is 5 although 
many temporary personnel are stationed there. Geographical coordinates for Alert are 82° 28' 
north latitude and 62° 30' west longitude. It is located 480 kilometres (260 nautical miles) 
northeast of Eureka.

4.3 Coal Tenure 
Canada Coal's land tenure consists of 75 active coal exploration licenses which are detailed in 
Table 4.2. Canada Coal does not currently have any coal leases or coal permits. 

Coal exploration licenses, coal leases, and coal permits in Nunavut are granted by the Mining 
Recorder's Office in Iqaluit ("the Recorder") who is responsible for subsurface rights 
administration of Crown land and for administering the Territorial Coal Regulations of the 
Territorial Lands Act ("Territorial Coal Regulations").  

The following information pertaining to coal exploration license, lease, and permit regulation 
and administration has been summarized from the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
Canada ("AANDC", formerly known as the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development or DIAND) official government website as well as from the Territorial Coal 
Regulations. 

4.3.1. Territorial Coal Regulations 
Anyone who is over the age of 18 may explore for coal in Nunavut. There are no initial 
prospector's licenses required, but it is recommended that companies doing business in Nunavut 
be registered and in good standing with the Government of Nunavut's Department of Justice, 
Legal Registry. 

Coal staking is not allowed in the following areas:  

• land used as a cemetery;  

• land within the limits of a municipal district, a municipality or a local improvement district;  

• land reserved for an Indian Reserve, a national park or game sanctuary or for military or other 
public purpose;  

• land reserved under the Dominion Water Power Act;  

• land lawfully occupied for mining purposes.

The Nunavut Coal Project 
 
Prepared for Canada Coal Inc.  P a g e  | 11 
 

 
Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

If the surface lands to be staked are occupied: 1) consent from the surface holder is required, or 
2) a security deposit is required in an amount that is determined by the Recorder to be sufficient 
to cover any loss or damage that may result from staking on such lands.  

The coal permit or lease shall be staked as nearly as possible in the form of a rectangle, which 
the length shall not exceed four times the width. The total area shall not exceed 640 acres for a 
lease application and no more than one acre for a permit application.  

The locations must be marked on the ground by a post at each of the four corners of the claim.  

4.3.2. Coal Exploration Licenses 
To apply for an Exploration License the applicant must submit to the Recorder an application 
form, a description of the land, a fee of $10/area applied for and a deposit equal to the 
expenditures required in the first year the license is in force. License applications consist of ¼ 
areas of mineral claim staking sheets (1:50,000 NTS map sheets). 

Applications are sent for consultation to various associations, boards, and institutions, during 
which time the status of an applied license is pending. Once awarded, the status of a license is 
active.  

A license is valid for a term of three years beginning on the day of application unless the license 
is terminated earlier. The work requirements are 5 cents per acre in the first year, 10 cents per 
acre in the second year, and 20 cents per acre in the third year.  

The deposits must be paid by the date of issuance of the license, and may be replaced by an 
equivalent amount of exploration work done to the license area.  

Exploration work that is to be applied to the license shall be submitted within 90 days after the 
end of each year that the license is in force and shall include:  

• a statement of expenditures;  

• a report on all exploration;  

• geological, geochemical or geophysical reports;  

• maps and assay reports.  

Any deposits made may be refunded to the licensee if the required amount of exploration work 
was done and approved.  

At the end of any year during the term of a license, not later than 90 days after the expiration of a 
license the licensee may apply for a lease or permit within the license area. No person other than 
the licensee may obtain a permit or a lease within the license area.

Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

4.3.3. Coal Leases 
A person may apply for a lease by filing the following with the Recorder: an application form, a 
fee of $5, a sketch of the location, and the amount of the rental for the first year of the lease. 
Upon receipt of an application for a license, the Recorder may cause the location to be inspected 
and if satisfied that the application is in order shall forward such application to the Chief. 

If approved, the lease will be issued for a term of 21 years at an annual rental of $1 per acre 
payable yearly in advance. A lease is renewable for a further term of 21 years where the lessee 
furnishes evidence satisfactory to the Minister to show that during the term of the lease he has 
complied with the conditions of such lease, and may be renewed for additional periods of 21 
years subject to the regulations at that time in force. 

In addition to the annual rental, a lessee shall pay annually a royalty at the rate of $0.10 per ton 
on merchantable coal mined on lands acquired by lease under these Regulations. 

A lessee is entitled to the coal upon or in the land included in such lease, and has the right to 
enter upon, use and occupy the surface of such location or such portion thereof, and to such 
extent as the Minister considers necessary for efficient coal mining operations but for no other 
purpose. 

A lessee shall commence active operations on his leasehold within one year following the day he 
is notified by the Minister to commence operations and shall produce from such operations the 
quantity of coal specified in the said notification. In no case shall the maximum quantity required 
to be mined exceed 10 tons per annum for each acre leased. 

4.3.4. Coal Permits 
A person may apply for a permit by filing with the Recorder an application form, a fee of $1, a 
payment of estimated royalty on the quantity of coal to be mined under the permit, and a sketch 
of the location. 

Where the Recorder is satisfied that an applicant for a permit has complied with the regulations 
respecting staking of the location and that the permit should be issued, they shall issue a permit 
to the applicant. 

A permittee is entitled 

(a) to enter upon the surface of the location covered by his permit, or such portion thereof and to 
such extent as the Minister may consider necessary for efficient coal mining and for no other 
purpose; and 

(b) to mine the quantity of coal set out in his permit subject to payment of a royalty on the 
merchantable output of the mine of $0.25 per ton of 2,000 pounds or such other royalty as may 
be fixed from time to time by the Minister with the approval of the Governor in Council. 

A permit expires upon March 31st next following the date of issue. Where a permittee wishes to 
obtain a further permit covering the same location for the ensuing year, they may at any time 
prior to expiry of the current permit, apply to the Recorder for a further permit, and where 
satisfied that the permittee has complied with all applicable provisions of these Regulations and

of the current permit, the Recorder may, upon receipt of the required fee and estimated royalty, if 
any, issue a further permit without requiring such permittee to restake such location. 

No person shall apply for, or hold, at one time, more than one location under permit.

4.5 Project Authorizations 
AGL has knowledge that Canada Coal is currently in the process of submitting applications to 
secure the necessary authorizations required to conduct an exploration program on the Nunavut 
Coal Project, and that Canada Coal has initiated the first stages of a community consultation 
process. 

4.5.1. Authorizations Overview 
The following general information pertaining to project authorizations has been summarized 
from the Nunavut Impact Review Board's ("NIRB") Guide 3, Guide to Filing Project Proposals 
and the Screening Process, updated August 2007. 
Exploration programs in Nunavut are approved by submitting a project proposal to various 
Authorizing Agencies ("AAs") responsible for issuing authorizations (letter, permit, license, 
lease, certificate, or other written or verbal communication that authorizes a project or a 
component of a project to proceed). The project proposal should also be submitted to the NIRB 
who will screen the project proposal in its entirety. 

A project proposal may require more than one authorization based on land and water (marine or 
freshwater) jurisdictional responsibilities. Mineral exploration project proposal may require the 
following authorizations: 



Independent Technical Report -   Project No. 2011CMAA.024  
The Nunavut Coal Project 
 
Prepared for Canada Coal Inc.  P a g e  | 17 
 

 
Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

• A land use authorization from a Designated Inuit Organization and/or Indian and Northern 
Affairs Canada depending on whether the project proposal is located on Inuit Owned Land or 
Crown Land. If the project proposal is located within a municipal boundary a land use 
authorization may be required from the Government of Nunavut department of Community 
Government Services. 

• A water license from the Nunavut Water Board depending on water requirements for drilling 
and/or camp use. 

• A Right-Of-Way authorization if a road or trail is included in the project proposal. 

• A quarry permit if source material is required to build a road or other infrastructure. 

• An archaeological permit from the Government of Nunavut department of Culture, Language, 
Elders and Youth if the Proponent is conducting archaeological or palaeontological research. 

•  Other authorizations depending on the scope of activities included in the project proposal. 
Project proposals submitted to the NIRB for screening must contain the following general 
information:  

a) Proponent information; 

b) Project proposal description including purpose, scope, timing, authorizations and alternatives; 

c) Description of the existing environment (biophysical and socio-economic); 

d) Description of public participation (informing, consulting, participation); 

e) Identification of potential environmental and socio-economic effects; 

f) Identification of potential cumulative effects; 

g) Identification of mitigation measures and potential residual impacts; 

h) Non-technical project summary in English and Inuktitut and/or Inuinnaqtun depending on the 
region and dialect. This should be 300-500 non-technical words for ease of translation 
summarizing the information outlined in the above sections (a) to (g); 

i) Map of the project (local and regional scale) in electronic format. GIS files in decimal degrees 
are preferred. 

In screening a project proposal and making a decision, NIRB uses both traditional Inuit 
knowledge and recognized scientific methods. Accordingly, the Proponent must state whether 
information was gathered through Inuit knowledge or by recognized scientific methods. 

4.5.2. Community Consultation 
Canada Coal representatives have initiated community consultation in regards to the Canada 
Coal project. As at the preparation date of the report detailed herein, the Corporation has visited 
Nunavut for the purposes of community consultation on three separate occasions and has 
expended approximately $100,000 in the process.

The Nunavut Coal Project 
 
Prepared for Canada Coal Inc.  P a g e  | 18 
 

 
Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

The initial community consultation meetings were conducted in Iqaluit June 20-24, 2011 by 
Denise Lockett, a consultant representing Canada Coal. Denise Lockett met with regulators from 
various Authorizing Agencies including the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development Canada, the Government of Nunavut, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, the 
Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, and the Chamber of Mines.  

A second series of meetings was conducted in Iqaluit September 26-30, 2011 by Canada Coal 
representatives Denise Lockett and Bruce Rawson. Meetings were arranged with regulators and 
community representatives including: Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development Canada, various departments within the Government of Nunavut 
(Culture/Language/Elders and Youth, Environment, Economic Development and 
Transportation), Qikiqtani Inuit Association Lands Director, MLA Ron Elliott, and Community 
Economic Development Officers for the Hamlets of Arctic Bay and Resolute Bay. 

The third round of community consultation occurred Oct 25-30, 2011 and included Canada Coal 
representatives Braam Jonker, Denise Lockett, Bruce Rawson. The scope of the October 
community consultation was more extensive and involved visits to Iqaluit, Resolute Bay, Grise 
Fiord, and Arctic Bay. Details of the October meetings are as follows:   

• October 25th 2011 - Iqaluit: Government of Nunavut Department of Economic 
Development and Transportation, Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development Canada, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Lands Department.  

• October 26th 2011 - Resolute Bay: community meeting, Hunters and Trappers 
Association. 

• October 27th 2011 – Grise Fiord:  community meeting, Hunters and Trappers 
Association. 

• October 28th 2011 - Arctic Bay: community meeting, Hunters and Trappers Association. 

• October 29th 2011 – Iqaluit: meeting with Qikiqtani Inuit Association Land 
Administrator, MLA Ron Elliott, Government of Nunavut Department of Economic 
Development and Transportation, Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development Canada. 

Based on the results of the community consultation conducted thus far, Canada Coal has 
disclosed the following information to AGL: 

• Overall, Canada Coal representatives have been well received by the Nunavut 
communities and the various Authorizing Agencies. The Corporation acknowledges that 
community consultation will be ongoing and that it will remain critical throughout the 
project's lifecycle. 

• The southernmost project area, Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord, is a sensitive area as it is 
important to the community of Grise Fiord as it is an accessible hunting area to the local 
caribou population. As such, the Corporation has stated that it will not conduct any 
further exploration in the Sor Fiord/Stenkul area without additional community 
consultation.

• Fosheim Peninsula is one of the few locations in the high Arctic where vegetation grows, 
and as such any exploration in the Fosheim Peninsula area will need to involve rigorous 
monitoring of wildlife and vegetation by locals who are familiar with the area. 

• A world-renowned fossilized forest resides within the Mokka Fiord area, and the 
Corporation has stated that it intends to preserve the area and does not intend to conduct 
exploration in the Mokka Fiord area. 

4.5.3. Phase One Exploration Authorizations 
AGL has knowledge that Canada Coal is in the process of submitting a project proposal for 
Phase 1 of the exploration program described herein (see Section 18, Recommendations). The 
first phase of exploration will focus on mapping and sampling activities, and will not involve 
drilling or permanent camp facilities. Phase 1 will have a relatively small impact on the 
environment but could provide considerable socio-economic benefit to the community, and 
although AGL cannot speak for the various Authorizing Agencies reviewing the project 
proposal, in AGL's opinion, Canada Coal stands a reasonable chance of getting Phase 1 
approvals.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
5.1 Accessibility 
The Nunavut Coal Project is accessible by air via helicopter. Some areas of the project are also 
accessible via fixed wing using natural gravel bars as runways including May Point and Stenkul 
Fiord. Eureka, located just outside to the northwest of the Fosheim area (see Figure 4.2) is the 
closet airstrip and it has until recently been capable of handling a Hercules transport aircraft. 
AGL notes that the Eureka runway is currently in need of repairs due to melting permafrost 
conditions, and that runway repairs are expected to occur in 2012. Marine access to the property 
is possible via the Eureka Sound and Slidre Fiord during the ice-free summer months. 

Aircraft charters may be obtained from Resolute Bay located some 630 kilometres south-
southwest of Eureka on the southern side of Cornwallis Island, or other northern communities 
such as Pond Inlet or Arctic Bay. Resolute Bay, Arctic Bay and Pond Inlet may be accessed via 
commercial flights from a variety of centers including Iqaluit, Nunavut Territory and 
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Aircraft fuel is not always available on Ellesmere and Axel 
Heiberg Islands and therefore fuel caching may be necessary to visit the project.  

5.2 Climate 
Climate data for the project areas are based on Environment Canada data collected at the Eureka 
weather station. Average temperatures at Eureka range from about -37 degrees Celsius ((°C) in 
the winter and about +10 (°C) in the summer. Record high and low temperatures are about -55 
degrees Celsius (°C) and +21 degrees Celsius (°C), respectively.  

Eureka is described as a polar desert with semi-arid conditions. The average annual precipitation 
rate is 75.5 mm, of which the bulk majority falls as snow. The sun is above the horizon from 
early March to mid-October and absent from mid-October to the end of February. 

The project areas are subject to continuous permafrost and reportedly the ground is frozen up to a 
depth of 400 metres year round with only the top few inches thawing in the summer. The frozen 
ground, in addition to poor soil drainage and scant vegetation, results in a water saturated ground 
over extended areas during the thawing season.  

5.3 Operating Season 
No details relating to potential length of project operating season are available at this time, as the 
project remains at an early exploration stage. AGL recommends the commissioning of a 
preliminary logistics study to assess the project operating season as well as coal shipping 
opportunities.

5.4 Local Resources 
Ellesmere Island is home to three settlements: Eureka, Grise Fiord, and Alert. 

Food and lodging is available at Eureka provided that a visitor permit application is submitted to 
the government. Major services are available at Grise Fiord including a hotel (capacity 25 
people), post office, RCMP office, health centre, grocery store, and small airstrip. Alert is 
primarily a military base.

Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

Axel Heiberg Island is uninhabited save for a seasonal research station operated by McGill 
University. 

AGL anticipates that future exploration programs will require onsite diesel-powered generators, 
and that waste will need to be transported to appropriate waste facilities via aircraft. There is a 
fuel drum crushing plant located at Eureka where fuel drums may be disposed of at a minimal 
fee. 

5.5 Infrastructure 
No permanent access roads are known to occur within the project areas. Eureka, Grise Fiord, and 
Alert have local roads. 

Access to Eureka is via gravel airstrip. The runway at Eureka is 1,464 metres (4,802 feet) long. 
During the site assessment, the Eureka runway was observed to be in need of repair as a result of 
slumping and solifluction. Twin otter aircraft are still capable of landing on the runway, as are 
some larger aircraft such as the DC-3. Eureka is currently in the process of securing the funds 
required to repair the runway.  

5.6 Physiography 
The Nunavut Coal Project is defined by high relief, greater than 750 metre (m), mountains, 
glaciers, fiords, and valleys. 

In the Fosheim Peninsula Property, the plains are characterized as gently undulating and tundra 
covered, with soil polygons commonly up to 50 metres in diameter. Most streams in the area 
flow mainly in a north-south pattern and are tributaries of the Slidre River. On Axel Heiberg 
Island, the plains of the May Point Property are typically grass covered, with occasional soil 
polygons. Streams are scarce but those which are present drain northeast and southeast into 
Eureka Sound. 

5.7 Flora and Fauna 
Wildlife in the area of the Nunavut Coal Prospect is comprised of small herds of musk oxen and 
caribou. In addition, Arctic wolves, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares, lemmings and ptarmigan can be 
observed. There are summer nesting grounds for geese, ducks, owls, loons, ravens, gulls and 
many other smaller birds that raise their young in the Arctic region, returning south in August. 

Vegetation is sparse over most of the Property, although lush near Eureka, and includes grasses, 
mosses, and low-lying shrubs (rare). 

Both Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands contain areas of fossil forests. Tree stumps were found 
one to two metres in diameter that existed during Paleocene-Eocene times. These tree stumps 
indicate that the area was once warm enough to produce redwood swamps, deciduous flood-
plains and boreal forest uplands. Many of the fossil trees are preserved as mummifications in an 
environment where little or no mineralization occurred. Tree specimens are perfectly preserved 
and almost indistinguishable from wood that can be found on the floor of forest areas.

6.0 HISTORY 
The majority of historic work on the Nunavut Coal Project occurred in 1981 to 1983 and was 
conducted by Gulf, Petro-Canada, and Utah. Each of these three major exploration programs is 
discussed in further detail in Section 10 (Exploration). Historic reports are not considered current 
in terms of NI 43-101, and could not be updated without drilling, mapping, and sampling the 
property areas relevant to the specific report.  

The first recorded expedition to reach the vicinity of Axel Heiberg and Ellesmere Island was the 
Otto Sverdrup Expedition in 1898-1902. Shortly thereafter, various geological explorers reported 
on the area including Schei (1903, 1904), Holtedahl (1913, 1917), Weeks (1927), Benthan (1936, 
1941), Wordie (1938), and Troelsen (1950).  

The Geological Survey of Canada initiated mapping of the Arctic Islands in the late 1950's, and 
in 1955 conducted a comprehensive investigation titled Operation Franklin of potential mineral 
fuel resources in the Arctic Islands. Details of the investigation, which reportedly consisted of air 
photo interpretation and ground traverses, are summarized by Cowley (1982) as follows: 

"The investigation reported coal seams on Axel Heiberg Island up to 9 metres 
thick and coal seams on Western Ellesmere Island up to six metres thick, all 
within the Eureka Sound Formation." 

Highlights of Petro-Canada's 1981 reconnaissance program on the Fosheim Peninsula and Vesle 
Fiord/South Fosheim areas are described by Bustin (1981): 

"Significant resources of lignite, sub-bituminous and high-volatile bituminous 
coal occur within the Eureka Sound Formation on Banks, Axel Heiberg and 
Ellesmere Island. The coal is low in sulphur (less than 0.5%) with few exceptions 
and has calorific values ranging from 7000 to 14,000 British thermal units per 
pound (Btu/lb) (16,280 kilojoules per kilogram (KJ/Kg) to 32,541 KJ/Kg). The 
seams are highly variable in thickness; seams up to 24 m thick occur and 
numerous seams are in the range of 2 to 10 metres thick. Seams between 0.5 and 
2 metres thick occur at most localities. On central Ellesmere Island numerous 
seams of coal up to 6.7 metres thick occur in the Fosheim Peninsula area. The 
coal varies in rank from high-volatile C to lignite and has calorific values up to 
10,000 Btu/lb (23,244 KJ/kg)." 

Highlights from Petro-Canada's 1982 reconnaissance program, described by Panchy and 
Moorehouse, 1983, are as follows: 

• An exploration program to determine the areal extent, thickness and tonnage of coal 
seams within the Eureka Sound Formation on Petro-Canada's licenses was completed. 

• Coal samples were collected for laboratory analysis to determine the chemical properties 
of individual seams. 

• Licenses were acquired around the Stenkul Fiord where thick seams were discovered in 
the later part of the 1982 field season.

Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

Petro-Canada completed coal resource estimation (not compliant with NI 43-101 standards) on 
the Fosheim Peninsula coal licenses, albeit at a reconnaissance level of detail with numerous 
assumptions in lieu of drill data, and concluded that seams are more or less evenly distributed 
through the formation and that they thin towards the east. Following the 1983 exploration season, 
Petro-Canada also completed coal resource estimation (not compliant with NI 43-101 standards) 
on the Stenkul Fiord coal licenses at a similar reconnaissance level of detail. 

In 1981, Utah conducted 16 days of field work comprising preliminary, reconnaissance mapping 
and sampling program on their Strathcona Fiord and May Point licenses. Program 
recommendations included further mapping at a scale of 1:50,000 as a precursor to drilling and 
seeking some sort of partnership with Gulf and Petro-Canada to reduce costs. 

Gulf conducted an exploration program in 1981 over four project areas, two of which (Fosheim 
Peninsula and May Point) occur within the Nunavut Coal Project. Gulf completed coal resource 
estimation (not compliant with NI 43-101 standards) in a similar fashion to Petro-Canada. 
Conclusions from the Gulf report (1981) are summarized as follows: 

• Lignitic to sub-bituminous A coal was speculated to be present within the Fosheim 
Peninsula area in sufficient abundance to have potential for economic exploitation. 

• May Point was considered to have insufficient in-situ resource potential for economic 
exploitation. 

• Drilling and mapping was required for a more accurate appraisal of the Eureka Sound 
Formation coal measures. 

6.1 Project Timeline 
A simplified timeline is presented in Table 6.1 detailing historic coal exploration in the project 
vicinity as well as coal license ownership 2006 - onwards. Note that project locations have in 
some cases been amended to reflect the current project area naming convention (although the 
majority of current project areas have been named according to the historic literature). The 
timeline has been summarized from Panchy and Moorehouse (1983) with additions for more 
recent events.

6.2 Historical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
Various authors prepared historical resource estimates (not compliant with NI 43-101 standards 
and not verified by AGL) on certain project areas within the Nunavut Coal Project. AGL 
cautions that the historical resources estimates are non-compliant, and at best would correlate to 
the "Speculative" coal resource category described in GSC 88-21 due to the lack of direct 
supporting evidence in the form of drill holes, trenches, and so forth.    

"Speculative" coal resources would not normally be reported by industrial users as it the resource 
category was originally intended to provide a basis for Government assessment of a country's 
national coal resources. Nevertheless, the non-compliant historical resource estimates are 
presented here as an indication of the relative size of the Nunavut Coal Project target resource.  

The below-quoted figures are reported as an exploration target, based on reasonable assumptions 
made from compiled data. These figures should not be construed to reflect a calculated resource 
(inferred, indicated or measured) under standards of NI 43-101. The potential quantities and 
grades reported above are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient work to date to 
define a NI 43-101 compliant resource. Furthermore, it is uncertain if additional exploration will 
result in discovery of an economic mineral resource on the property.

varied: 4,000 million tonnes was ascribed to high volatile bituminous coal, 11,000 million tonnes 
was ascribed to sub-bituminous coal, and 15,000 million tonnes was ascribed to lignte. Details of 
the 1980 Bustin resource estimate are as follows: 

As part of a stratigraphic and sedimentological study on Axel Heiberg and Ellesmere Islands, 
Bustin examined coal of the Eureka Sound Formation at numerous localities and determined the 
rank of coal using the reflectance method. The purpose of the study was to document some of the 
major coal occurrences including the rank and character of the coal, and to provide some 
preliminary estimates of the coal resources within the study area.   

The study area included both Fosheim Peninsula and Eastern Axel Heiberg (May Point and 
Mokka Fiord areas). At Fosheim Peninsula the coal measures outcropped over an area of about 
2500 km2, and a section 3300 m thick was measured along Remus Creek on the west flank of a 
broad northerly-trending synclinorium. At Eastern Axel Heiberg, the coal measures outcropped 
over an area of about 1500 km2, and the coal measures were highly variable in thickness ranging 
from a maximum measured thickness of 1500 metres to thin erosional outliers.  

Coal seams within the Fosheim Peninsula study area occurred throughout the section at Remus 
Creek although they were more abundant in the basal 1,500 m of the section. In the better 
exposed intervals of the measured section (45% of the total section) 86 coal seams were 
measured of which 48 seams were less than one metre thick and 28 seams were greater than one 
metre thick. The thickest measured seam was 10 metres. The coal rank ranged systematically 
from the base to the top of the section at Remus Creek. The range in coal rank was from high 
volatile bituminous coal (0-600 metres) to sub-bituminous coal (600-1625 metres) to lignite 
(1625 to 3300 metres).  

The thickest succession of coal measures at Eastern Axel Heiberg was exposed adjacent to 
Mokka Fiord. A total of 40 seams were measured through a 1,500 metre interval with about 70% 
exposure. Of the 40 seams, 22 were less than one metre thick and 18 were greater than one metre 
thick. The thickest measured seam was six metres thick, but contained a high percentage of 
argillaceous material. Coal rank varied on eastern Axel Heiberg from lignite and sub-bituminous 
B coal at Mokka Fiord and Flat Sound to sub-bituminous C coal in the May Point area and 
finally to high volatile bituminous C coal adjacent to Whitsunday Bay. Variations in coal rank on 
eastern Axel Heiberg did not form a consistent trend with estimated depths of burial or age of the 
strata and therefore a prediction of the lateral continuity of the coal seams was not possible with 
the exception of one location in the May Point area. 

Coal resources were obtained by considering those seams which were equal or greater than one 
metre thick and extrapolating their thickness over the area of outcrop to a depth of 200 metres. 
The author of the study noted that coal resource calculations must only be considered 
approximate within orders of magnitude.  

Coal resources in the Fosheim Peninsula area were estimated to be in the order of 21,000 million 
tonnes. Of the total resource estimate, 4,000 million tonnes were considered to be high volatile 
bituminous coal, 7,000 million tonnes were considered to be sub-bituminous coal, and 10,000 
million tonnes were considered to be lignite.

Coal resources in the eastern Axel Heiberg area are estimated to be in the order of 9,000 tonnes. 
Of these resources 4,000 million tonnes are sub-bituminous coal, 5,000 million tonnes are 
lignite, and 300 million tonnes are high volatile bituminous coal. 

6.2.2. Gulf - 1982 Historic Resource Estimate (Non-Compliant) 
Gulf prepared a historical resource estimate in 1982 covering 138,191 hectares of land in the 
Fosheim Peninsula area (largely contained within license number 101). In-situ potential coal 
resource figures of 5,616 million tonnes and 2,097 million tonnes were ascribed to coal seams 
greater than or equal to 1.0 metre in thickness and coal seams greater than or equal to 2.0 metres 
in thickness, respectively. Reflectance studies indicated that coal rank varied from lignite (Ro 
max 0.15%) to high volatile bituminous (Ro max 0.57%). Average coal quality analyses over the 
resource calculation area are summarized in Table 6.3. 

Table 6.3 - Historical Fosheim Peninsula Average Analyses

Moisture % (a.d.) 13.0 

Ash (%) 19.6 
Fixed Carbon (%) 32.3

Calorific Value (cal/gm) 4,337 

MMMF 5,423 
Ro max 0.35 

Estimation methodology is described as follows in the Gulf (1981) report: 

"Seven cross-sections were drawn through the property and were used in conjunction 
with the composite stratigraphic column in estimating in-situ resource potentials. By 
determining which portions of the 1800 metres of known coal-bearing section lay within 
500 metres of the surface it was possible to estimate the aggregate coal value to be 
assigned to that cross-section. 
The zone of influence of each section is equal to one half the distance between sections 
(2.5 km) except for the areas… where the zone of influence extends to the property 
boundary. 
Specific gravity values were not determined for any samples on the property. 
Consequently, in calculating resource figures a conservative specific gravity of 1.30 g.cc 
was used. 
Calculations were done… using the following formula: 
Surface trace of strata X depth trace along dip angle to a 500 metre vertical depth X 
aggregate coal thickness over specified interval X a specific gravity of 1.30."

6.2.3. Petro-Canada - 1982 Historic Resource Estimates (Non-Compliant) 
Petro-Canada delineated three areas of inferred coal resource potential in their 1982 exploration 
report (Panchy and Moorhouse, 1983): Fosheim Peninsula-West, Vesle Fiord, and Strathcona 
Fiord. Inferred coal resources in the order of 21,900 million tonnes, 4,000 million tonnes, and 
10,100 million tonnes were estimated, respectively. Rank of the resources ranged from high 
volatile bituminous C to lignite. Petro-Canada also evaluated the Fosheim Peninsula-East area, 
located east of the Sawtooth Mountains, and identified no significant coal resources.    

Fosheim Peninsula-West 

Petro-Canada prepared a historical resource estimate covering 170,412 hectares of land in the 
Fosheim Peninsula-West area (now referred to simply as Fosheim Peninsula). The inferred 
resource estimate was compared with a previous estimate (Bustin, 1982) in the same area. 
Inferred resources on the order of 21,000 million tonnes (Bustin) and 21,900 million tonnes 
(Petro-Canada) described by the two estimates were similar. Inferred resources were estimated to 
be within 200 metres of surface.  

Rank of the seams used in the Fosheim Peninsula-West resource estimate ranged from high 
volatile 'C' bituminous at the base of the section to lignite at the top.  

Evaluation methodology and resource calculation assumptions are as follows, as stated in the 
1983 Petro-Canada exploration report: 

a) The thickness of the Eureka Sound Formation ranged from 800 to 3,000 metres along 
the length of a central east-west cross-section. It was assumed that formation 
averaged 1,350 metres in thickness. 

b) Seams were assumed to be laterally continuous and to maintain the same thickness 
over the area. 

c) Seams are evenly distributed throughout the formation. 
d) Weighted specific gravity applied to all coal seams was 1.54 for this area. 
e) Composite coal thickness in seams greater than one metre was 48 metres. 
f) Composite coal thickness in seams greater than 2.5 meters equals 15 metres. 
Fosheim Peninsula-West is separated from the rest of the property by formational 
contacts with the Kanguk Formation on its east and west sides. To the south it is bounded 
by Eureka Sound and to the north by Greely Fiord. This area was planimetered giving a 
total area of 2,000 square kilometres…." 
Calculations were performed using the following Petro-Canada's formula: 

Area (metres-squared) X Composite coal thickness X Weighted specific gravity = 
Total inferred magatonnes for the entire formation 

Total inferred megatonnes X (200m/1350 m) = 
Inferred megatonnes within 200 m of surface.

Vesle Fiord 

Although Petro-Canada ascribed 4,000 million tonnes of inferred coal resources to the Vesle 
Fiord area as a result of the 1982 exploration program, the area was not considered prospective 
for resource exploitation. The Vesle Fiord area is structurally deformed and the majority of coal 
resources are below 200 metres of surface- therefore, the area was characterized as lacking in 
significant resource potential. Estimation methodology for the coal resource estimate was similar 
to that described for Fosheim Peninsula-West, except for the final stage of the calculation 
owning to the fact that minimal coal was ascribed within 200 metres of surface. 

Strathcona Fiord 

Similar to the Vesle Fiord area, the Strathcona Fiord can locally be divided into four members, 
two of which are coal bearing. Coal seams up to 24 metres in thickness are present and range 
from sub-bituminous 'A' to lignite in rank. The area is gently folded and transected by few 
faults. The area contains the thickest coal seams in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and was 
ascribed inferred resources in the order of 10.1 billion tonnes (on Petro-Canada's licenses). 
Estimation methodology for the coal resource estimate was similar to that described for Fosheim 
Peninsula-West, except for the final stage of the calculation (total inferred resources for the 
entire formation given). 

6.2.4. Petro-Canada – 1983 Historic Resource Estimate (Non-Compliant) 
As a result of its 1983 exploration program, Petro-Canada estimated that the Stenkul Fiord 
property was underlain by seven hundred fifty million tonnes of low quality (lignitic) thermal 
coal. The inferred resource estimate extended to a maximum depth of 200 metres from surface.   

Petro-Canada further concluded that geologic structure over most of the property was simple and 
that gentle bedding dips suggested surface mining potential with low average in-situ strip ratios. 
Furthermore, the specific energy values and low ash and sulphur values of the coal indicated its 
suitability for thermal power generation. 

The following parameters were utilized in the estimation: 

a) Coal zone thicknesses were averaged from the sections of each exploration block. 
b) Specific gravity used for each coal zone were from the analysis of samples in the control 

section ESS-8312 in Block 4. 
c) Coal areas drawn for Blocks 6,1,2,3,4, and 5 in Map No. 2 were planimetered while for 

Blocks 7 and 8 an arbitrary 1 sq. km area was assigned for each. 
d) The area was reduced for a given coal zone that was not continuous throughout the 

block. 
Calculations were produced using the following Petro-Canada formula: 

 Area (square kilometres) X Average zone thickness X Specific gravity of coal zone = 

Geologic resource of coal zone in megatonnes

6.2.5. Kalkreuth – 1992 Rough Estimate of Coal Resources (Non-Compliant) 
No detailed resource estimate studies have been undertaken at Bache Peninsula; however, in 
1992 Kalkreuth reported a rough estimate of coal resources on the order of 100 million tonnes 
for the Bache Peninsula as part of a paper in the International Journal of Coal Geology entitled, 
'The geology, petrography and palynology of Tertiary coals from the Eureka Sound Group at 
Strathcona Fiord and Bache Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Arctic Canada.'  

Kalkreuth's rough coal resources estimate was calculated based on a total areal extent of at least 
eight square kilometres underlain by total coal thicknesses ranging from 3.23 m to 19.93 m. The 
rough coal estimate was calculated for coal resources less than 300 metres depth from surface. 
AGL cautions that Kalkreuth's method was intended as a 'Speculative' target size at best, and 
that the methodology is non-compliant with NI 43-101 standards.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
7.1 Regional Geology  
Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands are typically divided into three major geological units: 1) 
Precambrian basement rocks, 2) the Franklin sedimentary succession, and 3) the Sverdrup Basin 
sedimentary succession. The rocks generally young to the northwest, and are separated from 
each other by major regional unconformities. Figure 7.1 displays the bedrock geology of the 
region. Early Carboniferous to Early Tertiary units comprise the Sverdrup Basin sedimentary 
succession, Cambrian to Late Devonian units comprise the Franklin sedimentary succession, and 
Archean or Proterozoic units comprise the Precambrian basement rocks. 

The rocks of southeastern Ellesmere Island are defined mostly by granulitegrade metamorphic 
rocks (including granite, gneiss, amphibolite, marble, and quartzite) of the Precambrian 
Canadian Shield, but also include unmetamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks of the late 
Precambrian Thule Group (Frisch, 1983). These Thule Group rocks correlate with similar units 
in Greenland, while the Shield rocks of Ellesmere Island form part of the Churchill geological 
province and represent the northern extent of the Canadian Shield (Frisch, 1983). Massive ice 
sheets cover most of the Shield rocks except along the coast. According to Freeman (1994), 
structural features in the Shield rocks trend northerly with foliations dipping steeply to the east 
and west. 

Overlying the Precambrian Shield rocks of Ellesmere Island is the Franklinian sedimentary 
succession. The Franklinian sedimentary succession (Cambrian to Late Devonian) 
nonconformably overlies the Precambrian basement rocks and consists mainly of shelf 
carbonates, evaporites, basinal deep-water rocks, and fluvial and deltaic deposits (Mayr et al., 
1994). Tozer & Thorsteinsson (1970) also list quartzose sandstone and volcanics as major 
lithological constituents of this succession. During the Ellesmerian Orogeny (Late Devonian to 
Early Carboniferous, i.e. Fammenian to Viséan), the Franklinian succession was folded to form 
the Hazen and Central Ellesmere fold belts, of which the Hazen is more intensely folded (Mayr 
et al., 1994). The southern and eastern regions of the Franklinian sedimentary succession were 
left relatively undeformed to form what is known today as the Arctic Platform (Mayr et al., 
1994). 

Overlying the Franklinian sedimentary succession is the Sverdrup Basin sedimentary succession. 
The Sverdrup Basin sedimentary succession (Early Carboniferous to Early Tertiary) 
unconformably (angular unconformity) overlies rocks of the Franklinian succession, and consists 
mainly of shelf carbonates, non-marine clastics, turbidites, evaporites, deltaic deposits, and deep-
water basinal rocks (Mayr et al., 1994). According to Thorsteinsson & Tozer (1970), upper 
Paleozoic and Cretaceous basalts are also present, and thick gabbroic sills intrude parts of the 
succession. During the Eurekan Orogeny (mid-Tertiary) the Sverdrup Basin succession was 
folded, faulted, and experienced evaporite diapirism (Drummond, 1973) to form the Eurekan 
Fold and Thrust Belt. At the same time, older Ellesmerian structures were reactivated and 
faulting took place on the Arctic Platform (Mayr et al., 1994).

7.1.1. Structural Setting - The Innuitian Orogen Geologic Province of Canada 
The Nunavut Coal Project lies within the Innuitian Orogen geological province of Canada 
(Figure 7.2). The Innuitian Orogen began with earliest Paleozoic rifting of northern ancestral 
North America, followed by early Paleozoic deposition of shelf and off-shelf sediments, the 
latter in a deep trough bounded on the north by foreign continental fragments. A younger, 
overlapping clastic wedge was deformed in the mid-Paleozoic and, finally, the orogen was partly 
superimposed by a mainly Mesozoic clastic basin, which was itself deformed in latest Mesozoic 
and early Tertiary time.  

The Arctic Platform merges northward into a Cambrian-Lower Devonian southern shelf 
assemblage of 5 km of carbonate, shale and evaporite. It is adjoined by Hazen Trough, 
containing Lower Cambrian rift clastics overlain by deep-water shale and 3 km of turbidites. 
Hazen Trough is bounded on the north by the Northern Belt which comprises continental 
fragments (largely volcanics and granites). Northerly derived turbidites indicate that the Northern 
Belt was uplifted, following the collision (along a zone marked by oceanic ultramafic rocks) of 
Proterozoic and Middle Ordovician fragments in mid-Ordovician time.  

This collision ended arc volcanism in the Northern Belt. It was followed by pulses of folding and 
uplift in Silurian and Devonian times and by granitic intrusion in the Devonian. Uplifts in 
northeastern and eastern parts of the orogen shed detritus to a southeastward-advancing Middle 
and Upper Devonian clastic wedge. It was compressively folded during the Ellesmerian Orogeny 
(about 345 million years ago) which migrated from the Northern Belt to the Southern Shelf.  

Subsequently, stretching and subsidence led to the deposition of 12 km of sediments in Sverdrup 
Basin, mainly of Mesozoic rift clastics and basaltic lava and intrusion, and some Upper 
Paleozoic evaporites that were locally squeezed upward into overlying sediments. The latest 
Cretaceous uplift in the eastern Sverdrup Basin shed a clastic wedge across the basin to the 
continental margin. This was succeeded by the Eurekan Orogeny (about 65 million years ago) 
which created broad folds and thrust faults directed south and east. At the same time, more than 
3 km of clastics accumulated in local basins on land and in narrow, marine fault-troughs. Late 
Cenozoic vertical faulting produced the present topography.

7.1.2. Stratigraphic Setting - The Sverdrup Basin 
The Sverdrup Basin is an elongate pericratonic depression overlying older strata of the 
Franklinian mio-and-eugeosynclines. Sediments of the Sverdrup Basin thin toward the margins 
and in places younger beds successively overstep older beds. A generalized stratigraphic column 
is shown in Figure 7.3. 

Carboniferous to lowermost Cretaceous sediments include evaporates, carbonates, marine and 
non-marine clastics, whereas the Lower Cretaceous to Tertiary sediments consist only of marine 
and non-marine clastics. The central part of the basin, on Amund Ringness and Axel Heiberg 
Islands, has a total sediment thickness in the order of 12,000 metres. In the axial region of the 
basin the succession is essentially concordant but towards the basin margins angular 
unconformities exist which reflect tectonic pulses. 

Diabase and gabbroic sills and dikes occur throughout the eastern part of the Sverdrup Basin. On 
the property dikes and sills intrude strata of Triassic age. Volcanic rocks are also exposed on 
western Axel Heiberg Island which include the Strand Fiord Volcanics Formation and several 
flows within the Isachsen Formation. 

7.1.3. The Eureka Sound Formation 
The Late Cretaceous and Tertiary Eureka Sound Formation is the principal coal bearing unit in 
the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Troelsen (1950) proposed the name Eureka Sound Group for 
deposits of Tertiary sandstone, shale and coal cropping out on Ellesmere Island. Tozer (1963) 
redefined the Eureka Sound Group as a formation and Souther (in Fortier et al., 1963) proposed 
as the type section 2700 m of interbedded sandstone, shale, mudstone and coal which 
conformably overlies Upper Cretaceous shales on western Axel Heiberg Island. 

The Eureka Sound Formation as so defined is a complex deposit ranging in age from 
Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) to Middle Eocene (c.f. Hills and Wallace, 1969). Although in 
part a syntectonic deposit, it is older than the last major phase of orogenesis in the eastern Arctic 
Archielago (Tozer, 1970; Balkwill et al., 1975). As originally deposited, the Eureka Sound 
Formation probably enveloped most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It presently occurs as 
erosional outliers on Banks, Devon, Somerset, Bathurst, Melville, Ellef Ringnes, Lougheed, 
Cornwall, Axel Heiberg and Ellesmere Islands. It also occurs in the subsurface of Banks, Ellef 
Ringnes and Meighen Islands and is also likely present in the interisland seaways and off the 
northern margin of the Archipelago. The formation is highly variable in thickness ranging from a 
maximum of 3300 m at Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island to thin erosional edges at many 
localities. In the central and southern parts of the Archipelago it conformably overlies Upper 
Cretaceous shales of the Kanguk Formation, whereas on the northern margin it rests 
unconformably on older Mesozoic strata and on the eastern margin lies unconformably on 
Misozoic, Paleozoic or Proterozoic rocks. The Eureka Sound Formation is unconformably 
overlain by Quaternary deposits or locally by the Miocene-Pliocene Beaufort Formation.

The lithologies of the Eureka Sound Formation are remarkably uniform throughout the Canadian 
Arctic Archipelago. The formation consists of rhythmically interbedded dark grey shale, 
mudstone and siltstone, buff to light grey quartzose sandstone, minor conglomerate and coal. 
Coal seams have been reported from almost all known localities. The seams are commonly 
between 0.5 and 1.0 m thick, but in some locations attain thicknesses of several metres. 

Two schemes with different formation units, which reintroduced and redefined the Eureka Sound 
Group, were discussed by Miall (1986) and Ricketts (1986). Miall and Ricketts have different 
lithostratigraphic approaches involving different basinal interpretations  although at this stage 
AGL does not have sufficent local knowledge to evaluate the relative merits of the two 
stratigraphic schemes. 

7.1.4. Geological Survey of Canada Map of the Arctic 
A map of the circumpolar Arctic, the 1:5 million scale Geological Map of the Arctic, and its 
related database was published in November 2008. The Nunavut Coal Project area has been 
presented in Figure 7.4 and its accompanying geological legend is included as an Appendix to 
this report. 

The map's features include: individual geology units coded for composition, age, environment of 
formation and plate tectonic domain; geological contacts, faults and oceanic spreading ridges; 
and volcanoes, meteor impact structures, salt and gypsum extrusions and selected point data.

7.2 Local Geology 
Fosheim Peninsula 

At Fosheim Peninsula, the Eureka Sound Formation is 3,200 metres thick and is coal bearing 
throughout. Multiple seams up to fifteen metres in thickness reportedly exist in the area, although 
the maximum thickness encountered during the AGL site assessment was 4.2 metres. The rank of 
the seams ranges from high volatile bituminous 'C' to lignite. The coal seams are laterally 
persistent and can be traced up to twenty-five kilometres along strike. 

The structure at Fosheim Peninsula is dominated by an asymmetrical synclinorium trending 
southerly to southwesterly through the area. The resulting structural Tertiary basin covers a 
surface area with a minimum width of 15 kilometres whose length extends through the entire 
area. 

The synclinorum structure is cut by the northwest to southeast trending Black Top Fault. The 
fault is near vertical and is believed to have undergone differential movement. The hinge line for 
this movement is presumed to be in the northern portion of the property near Romulus Lake. 
Vertical displacements of 150 metres, in the southeast portion of the property, and in excess of 
1,000 metres northwest of the property, across the Black Top Ridge have been estimated. 

The rotational nature of the fault has altered the attitude of the fold from north to south. North of 
the Black Top Fault the eastern fold limb dips at approximately 20 degrees to the west and the 
western limb has an average dip of 50 degrees east. South of the fault the eastern limb dips 
approximately 50 degrees west while the western limb dips an average of 18 degrees east. 

Additional folding and faulting occurs on the property but is minor in comparison and does not 
greatly alter the structural style or subsequent tonnage estimates. Thrust faults are not known to 
occur on the property. 

Vesle Fiord 

At Vesle Fiord, the Eureka Sound Formation is in the order of 2700 metres thick and is only 
partly coal bearing. The formation contains at least one major marine unit. Coal seams locally 
exceed four metres but usually occur in areas which are structurally complex. The coal ranges 
from sub-bituminous 'B' to lignite 'A' in rank. 

Strathcona Fiord 

At Strathcona Fiord, the Eureka Sound Formation can locally be divided into four members 
having a collective thickness of 2,500 metres. Much of the strata is exposed in a broad syncline. 
At least one of the members is marine in origin and only the upper member contains multiple 
seams up to 24 metres in thickness. The coal ranges from sub-bituminous 'C' to lignite 'A' in 
rank.  

Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord 

At Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord, the Eureka Sound is preserved in several graben structures. Coal 
seams over 15 metres in thickness were identified. The rank of the coal seams ranges between 
sub-bituminous 'C' to lignite 'A'.

In the Stenkul Fiord area, the Eureka Sound formation is comprised of fault-bounded blocks 
surrounding the fiord. The formation is at least 165 metres thick and overlies the Devonian Okse 
Bay Formation. The contact is unconformable and is marked by a minor angularity. The bulk of 
the coal in the Stenkul Fiord area is described as lignite. 

May Point 

In the area of the May Point Property, the Eureka Sound Formation can be divided into three 
units. Each unit has its own distinct color, reflecting a different depositional environment. The 
lower unit appears dark brown by virtue of a predominant shale-sand-rare coal sequence. The 
middle unit is a pale yellow-brown sand sequence, and the shale and coal rich upper unit displays 
a medium brown color. 

The lower unit predominantly consists of mudstone, with minor interbeds of siltstone and 
sandstone and some rare coals. The soft mudstone is dark to medium brown and carbonaceous in 
places. The interbeds of white quartzose, and fine to medium grained semi-consolidated 
sandstone, may reach six metres in thickness and appear to be associated with thin platey 
interbeds of hard ferruginous siltstone containing well preserved plant impressions. Coal seams 
are rare and usually less than one metre in thickness; however one attained a thickness of six 
metres. This unit is estimated to be 500 metres in thickness throughout the area. 

The middle unit consists almost exclusively of clean, white to light brown, fine to medium 
grained, semi-consolidated sandstone. The clean sandstones contain ripple marks, pelecypods 
and trace fossils. The unit seems barren of coal seams and other carbonaceous material. Thin 
mudstone and siltstone interbeds are rare. The environment of deposition is interpreted to be near 
shore or of a beach origin. This unit has a minimum thickness of 900 metres in the area. 

The upper unit consists of alternating sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and coals. The 
sandstones are thin to thick bedded, light grey, fine to medium grained and poorly indurated. The 
plately siltstones are well indurated, medium grey to dark red. Thin to thick bedded mudstones 
are dark grey, carbonaceous and silty in places. Coal seams are abundant and range up to 38 
metres in thickness. Thicker coal seams typically have abundant mudstone splits. The coals are 
the most resistant rock units within the Eureka Sound Formation, hence, are prominent on the 
landscape. The unit has a minimum thickness of 500 metres. 

The Eureka Sound Formation occupies the entire peninsula of the May Point Property. Near the 
northwest boundary of the property, the Eureka Sound Formation is bounded by a north-
northeast trending, east dipping normal fault. Along the majority of the western margin of the 
property, Eureka Sound strata lie conformably on Upper Cretaceous Kangul strata. The lower 
unit in the Eureka Sound Formation is exposed over much of the property and found to contain 
several coal seams many of which were trenched. The middle pale sand unit is exposed in the 
easternmost part of May Point. Due to the flat to rolling topography, outcrops are sparse and can 
be found in a few creek beds. Bedding is flat to gently dipping, up to 10 degrees to the east over 
the majority of the property. There may be gentle north trending folds across the property but 
slumping is common rendering many attitudes unreliable.

7.2.2. Coal Mineralization/Coal Seam Development 
Coal is found in five formations on the Nunavut Coal property; The Eureka Sound, Okse Bay, 
Heiberg, Isachsen and Hassel Formations. The following description has been modified from 
Panchy and Moorhouse (1983). 

The Upper Cretaceous to Tertiary Eureka Sound formation was deposited prior to and during the 
early phases of the Eurekan Orogeny. It is the main coal-bearing formation in the Arctic Islands. 
It is comprised of roughly 3,300 m of clastic and minor marine sediments in the region of the 
Fosheim Peninsula and thins to approximately 2,500 m in the vicinity of the Strathcona Fiord. 
Lithologically the formation consists of mainly sandstone, claystone, minor siltstone and thick 
lignite seams. The majority of the coal seams explored on the property are found as part of an 
Alluvial Plain Facies. The lignitic coal seams here range from a few cm to over 8 m in thickness

and are commonly blocky. They weather platy to papery and are quite woody as evident by the 
petrified tree branches and silicified stumps still in an upright growth position. 

The Okse Bay formation is the oldest coal-bearing formation on the property, aging from the 
Devonian, and has an estimated thickness of 3,000 m. It was deposited under deltaic conditions 
and consists of a thick series of commonly cross-bedded nonmarine sandstones, shales, 
carbonaceous debris and thin coal stringers which do not exceed 30 cm. 

The Heiberg formation dates from the Early Triassic to late Jurassic and is comprised of reddish-
weathering sandstones and siltstones along with carbonaceous shales and coal seams. The 
formation is over 750 m thick on the Fosheim Peninsula and is as thick as 1,400 m on Axel 
Heiberg Island. Coal seams within the Heiberg Formation do not exceed one metre thick. 

The Isachsen formation formed in the Early Cretaceous and is used as a marker horizon for the 
area due to its lithological uniformity over the entire region. It is composed of reddish- to-
brownish sandstones, conglomerate, minor siltstone and shales, with thin coal beds in the basal 
layers. No coal seams over 50 cm were observed within the Isachsen formation. Marine fossils 
occur in the basal beds, but the overlying beds are clearly non-marine suggesting a deltaic origin. 

The Hassel formation is Early to Late Cretaceous in age. It consists of pale coloured, poorly 
consolidated medium to fine-grained quartzose sandstones with minor siltstones, shales and 
lignite seams. The Hassel formation is thought to have formed in a shoreline environment. The 
formation is roughly 50 to 75 m thick along the flanks of the Fosheim syncline and anticline. 
Coal seams up to 40 cm thick occur within the Hassel formation. 

Strathcona Fiord 

Calorific values and huminite reflectances place seams at Strathcona Fiord into lignite to 
subbituminous rank (Kalkreuth, 1993). Petrographic analyses showed that the coals are 
characterized by the predominance of wood-derived macerals of the humotelinite group. Detailed 
analyses of seam sub-sections show that there is little in-seam variation. Based on petrographic 
characteristics and pollen spore assemblages in the coals and sedimentological features of 
associated strata a peat accumulation in forested swamps which formed on a broad coastal plain 
is indicated. The pollen assemblages suggest a temperate climate with modern rainfall during the 
lifetime of the mires. 

Bache Peninsula 

Calorific values and huminite reflectance levels at Bache Peninsula are that of lignite (Kalkreuth, 
1993). Petrographic analyses showed the predominance of macerals of the humodetrinite group, 
frequently associated with mineral matter in the form quartz and clay minerals. Inertinite is 
common mainly in the form of inertodetrinite and fusinite. Petrographic characteristics of the 
coal-bearing succession at Bache Peninsula such as the dominance of degraded organic 
components, the relative low diversity in the pollen and spore assemblage and the occurrence of 
numerous pteridophyte spores suggest formation of the peat in a slightly forested swamp/reed 
marsh, in which abundant ferns and sphagnum mats were common. The climate during peat 
accumulation was most likely temperate with moderate precipitation.

Stenkul Fiord 

Petrographic analyses show that wood-derived macerals of the humotelinite group characterize 
the coals (Kalkreuth, 1996). Geochemical analyses show that diterpanes are predominant and 
suggest that the wood macerals are primarily gymnospermous. Palynological assemblages are 
usually dominated by Taxodiaceae pollen. Geological interpretation, petrographic characteristics 
and palynological determination suggest that peat accumulated in forested swamps on an alluvial 
coastal plain. The pollen assemblages suggest the climate during growth of the mires was 
temperate with moderate rainfall. Coals are determined to have developed at the same time as the 
Strathcona Fiord coals and in a similar environment.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
8.1 Coal Deposit Types According to GSC 88-21 
The definition of deposit type for coal properties is different from that applied to other types of 
mineral deposits. In Canada coal deposits are classified according to GSC 88-21, a guidance 
reference for coal deposits as specified under the CIM Definition Standards, whereby coals are 
classified according to the degree of geological complexity ("geology type") and the probable 
extraction type for a deposit ("deposit type"). 

The amount of geological complexity, or geology type, is usually imposed by the structural 
complexity of the area, and the classification of a coal deposit by geology type determines the 
approach to be used for the resource/reserve estimation procedures and the limits to be applied to 
key estimation criteria. The identification of a particular geology type for a coal property defines 
the confidence that can be placed in the extrapolation of data values away from a particular point 
of reference such as a drill hole. 

The classification scheme of GSC 88-21 is similar to many other international coal classification 
systems but it has one significant difference. This system is designed to accommodate 
differences in the degree of tectonic deformation of different coal deposits in Canada. The four 
classes of geological complexity, from lowest to highest, are: 

• Low - relatively unaffected by tectonic  deformation, coal seams are flat lying to very 
gently dipping and are generally unfaulted; 

• Moderate - deposits have been affected to some extent by tectonic deformation, 
characterized by homoclines or broad open folds with bedding inclinations of generally 
less than 30 degrees, faults may be present but are relatively uncommon and have 
displacements of less than 10 metres; 

• Complex - deposits have been subjected to relatively high levels of tectonic deformation, 
tight folds may be present and offsets by faults are common, ; 

• Severe - deposits have been subjected to extreme levels of tectonic deformation. 
The Nunavut Coal Project currently encompasses nine license blocks, and geology type across 
the entire project area is highly variable. Further exploration such as drilling will be necessary to 
confirm the geology type of the coals, however, preliminary indications suggest that the geology 
type would be "low" to "moderate" with local areas following into the "complex" category. 

Deposit type as defined in GSC 88-21 refers to the extraction method most suited to the coal 
deposit. There are four categories: surface, underground, non-conventional, and sterilized. 
Surface mining is currently being contemplated for the Nunavut Coal Project. 

8.2 Coal Depositional Setting 
Commercially significant coal resources occur only in Europe, Asia, Australia and North 
America. These deposits occur in sedimentary rock basins, typically sandwiched as layers called 
beds or seams between layers of sandstone and shale. Many coal deposits in Europe and North

America date from the Devonian to the Triassic periods when these areas were covered with 
forests dominated by large ferns and scale trees. 

Most coals that are mined for energy production are humic coals which are derived from peat. 
These coals are examples of organic sedimentary rocks and are composed of substances or 
aggregates called macerals (analogous to the minerals that form rocks). The formation of humic 
coals begins when plant debris accumulates in a swamp where the stagnate waters prevents 
oxidation and total decomposition of the organic matter. These swamps are called peat swamps 
with an estimated 10% of the plant matter being converted to peat through a process known as 
peatification. 

It appears that many coal deposits formed when peat deposits in near-coastal basins subsided 
allowing the sea to flood the area covering the peat with sand and mud. Much of Europe and 
North America was located closer to the equator during the Devonian and Carboniferous and 
these waters were warm allowing lime muds to accumulate on top of the peat deposits. Over time 
these areas experienced cyclical periods of subsidence and re-emergence. As a result many coal 
deposits are composed of layers of coal separated layers of sandstone, shale or limestone. The 
coal layers range in thickness from a few centimetres to 20 m or more.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
Recent exploration activity on the Nunavut Coal Project has been limited to AGL's current 
personal site inspection and a similar site assessment conducted by APEX in 2005. West Hawk 
commissioned a NI 43-101 compliant technical report in 2007 on their Fosheim Peninsula and 
May Point coal exploration licenses, however no site assessment or follow-up field work resulted 
from West Hawk's NI 43-101 to the best of the author's knowledge. 

9.1 AGL 2011 Site Assessment 
AGL completed a site assessment of the Nunavut Coal Project from August 9th through August 
27th, 2011. Due to time constraints and adverse weather conditions, AGL was only able to assess 
the following areas: Fosheim Peninsula, Stenkul Fiord, Sor Fiord, Vesle Fiord, and Mokka Fiord. 
AGL considers that Fosheim Peninsula is, at this stage, the primary target on the Canada Coal 
licenses and are therefore satisfied that the site assessment meets the criteria as described by NI 
43-101. 

Table 9.1 describes the sampling highlights of the site assessment. AGL did not endeavor to 
undertake a detailed sampling program; the intention of sampling was merely to verify the rank 
of historic coal occurrences for a due diligence standpoint.  

In some locations, samples were not taken as the coal was deemed inappropriate for sampling 
(weathered or burnt). AGL cautions that data accrued from sampling may not be accurate due to 
potential surface slumping, solifluction and oxidation of the seams- however, AGL attempted to 
sample fresh surfaces as much as possible.

9.1.1. Fosheim Peninsula 
The site assessment primarily focused on Fosheim Peninsula for the following reasons: 1) 
Fosheim Peninsula is considered the primary exploration target based on historic coal rank, level 
of previous exploration, and proximity to the Eureka weather station, and 2) weather conditions 
were adverse and many of the outlying exploration areas could not be accessed. 

AGL was able to confirm the existence of a laterally continuous coal zone within Fosheim 
Peninsula. The coal zone strikes NNE and dips gently to the NW in most areas. The coal zone is 
comprised of many seams including at least two 4-6 m thick seams and several metre-scale 
seams observed by AGL. Previous authors described the zone as extending 15 kilometres along 
strike, and AGL was able to further extend the zone to 25 kilometres along strike. AGL flew 
along the strike of the coal zone and notes that a few major structural breaks exist toward the 
southwest end of the coal zone but that for the most part the zone is continuous. 

AGL sampled from three locations at Fosheim Peninsula to verify historical reports and get a 
preliminary indication of coal rank in the region. Samples are described in Table 9.1 and their 
locations are depicted in Figure 9.2. Sample AGL-FN 004 was particularly well exposed as the 
creek-cut bank had recently slumped. The coal seam was estimated to be 4.3 metres thick in total 
and appeared somewhat blocky and dull banded. AGL divided the seam into upper, middle, and 
lower zones for sampling purposes, in order to ascertain if there was any significant coal quality 
variation within the seam.   

The author considers that the Fosheim Peninsula coal zone represents a viable drilling target for 
the second stage of a planned exploration program, and that the generally flat-lying character of 
the area could prove amenable to exploration activities such as drilling. More detailed mapping 
and additional surface sampling is also recommended along the strike length of the zone in 
advance of the drilling activities.   

An old runway was observed alongside the Fosheim Peninsula coal zone in the vicinity of 
sample location AGL-FN 004.   

9.1.2. Vesle Fiord 
Vesle Fiord was examined by aerial overview and also via ground inspection at two sampling 
locales. From the aerial viewpoint, AGL observed that although numerous coal seams are present 
their degree of structural complexity is highly variable and that the topography itself is quite 
rugged.  

At the ground level, coal measures were observed as abundant thin seams (0.5 to 2 metres in 
thickness) with varying degrees of interburden (metres to decimetres). Strikes and dips varied 
widely, often within short distances (hundreds of metres). In some instances, seams were nearly 
vertically dipping. One sample was taken from a 1 metre seam in the Vessle Fiord area so that 
AGL could compare coal quality at Vesle Fiord with coal quality at Fosheim Peninsula; 
however, sample exposure in this location as fresh as the Fosheim Peninsula samples. The Vesle 
Fiord sample is described in Table 9.1 and its location demarked in Figure 9.2.

Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

Based on the site assessment, coal measures at Vesle Fiord are not as prospective as the 
relatively flat-lying, gently dipping coal measures at Fosheim Peninsula. 

9.1.3. Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord      
AGL committed one day of the site inspection to assessing the Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord area. The 
Sor Fiord/Stenkul area is located a considerable distance from the Eureka base station, and 
therefore AGL had previously cached fuel near the Sor Fiord area. There is a known fuel cache 
location situated at 77° 26' N and 85° 48' W alongside with a well-maintained runway suitable 
for twin otter aircraft equipped with tundra tires.   

Numerous thin coal seams were observed to occur within the Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord coal 
exploration licenses. Coal outcropped on several higher topographic blocks and weathered into 
soil polygons and could was also observed along block margins. Coal thicknesses were difficult 
to determine due to the degree of weathering and the presence of a dark carbonaceous shale unit 
in the sedimentary package. The seams were burnt across considerable distances and were 
therefore not appropriate for sampling. Abundant relict tree stumps were preserved within the 
vicinity of the coal seams.  

AGL noted an abandoned runway and old camp remains in proximity to southern Stenkul Fiord 
and sample observation point AGL-STK-006. 

The topography and structural setting of the area is considerably more complex than that of 
Fosheim Peninsula. AGL has not been able to verify the coal quality of the area, and is of the 
opinion that considerable mapping and sampling would be required prior to the identification of 
drill targets at Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord. 

9.1.4. May Point 
AGL was unable to land at May Point due to time constraints and adverse weather conditions; 
however, AGL did fly over the area while en route to Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord. The authors 
aerially observed several dark, thin, coal-like units outcropping at seemingly shallow dips within 
the May Point area, but cannot directly attest to the nature of character of the dark units. 

9.1.5.  Mokka Fiord 
AGL attempted to locate several historic coal occurrences in the vicinity of Mokka Fiord during 
the site assessment, but did not encounter any seams of significance. The author notes that the 
Mokka Fiord site assessment was brief (half a day) due to time constraints and adverse weather 
conditions, and that some of the historically reported coal occurrence locations were quite vague 
(coordinate systems were often inferred and sample locations often 'eyeballed' using historic 
maps).  

While coal may well occur within the Mokka Fiord license area, further reconnaissance work 
will be required to ascertain its extent, structural setting, and character.  

The coal licenses on eastern Axel Heiberg Island are situated in the vicinity of the world-renown 
Geodetic Hills Fossil Forrest. As such, AGL does not recommend further coal exploration within 
the Mokka Fiord region in order to preserve the integrity of the fossil forest.

9.1.6. Remaining License Areas 
AGL was unable to directly assess the following license areas due to time constraints and 
adverse weather conditions: Li Fiord, Good Friday Bay, Strathcona Fiord, and Bache Peninsula. 
The aforementioned license areas remain of interest to the Nunavut Coal Project, however they 
are not considered critical targets at this time. 
 

 
9.2 2005 APEX Site Assessment 
In 2005, Hunter commissioned APEX to compile a complete fieldwork on 15 coal exploration 
licenses at Fosheim Peninsula and Strathcona Fiord. APEX subsequently compiled a NI 43-101 
report based on their 2005 findings for Weststar in 2009. 

APEX completed prospecting and coal seam sampling during 3 days of field work in late August 
2005. The field work was helicopter supported and based out of Grise Fiord and Eureka Weather 
Station.

Effective Date September 30th, 2011  

APEX completed visits to a total of 22 sites within the licenses that resulted in the discovery of 
16 coal occurrences and the collection of 4 coal seam samples that were submitted for proximate 
analysis. Of the 16 coal occurrences discovered at total of 5 occurrences were located within 
Weststar's Fosheim Peninsula area and a total of 6 occurrences were located within the 
Strathcona Fjord area. Of the 4 coal seam samples collected by APEX; one was collected from 
within the Fosheim Peninsula licenses and 2 were collected from within the Strathcona Fiord 
licenses. Details of the APEX samples are provided in Table 7.2 in the Geology Section. 

Conclusions of the APEX site assessment were as follows: 

Weststar's Arctic coal prospects are considered to be early exploration stage 
projects. The historic exploration conducted by Petro-Canada, Utah Mines, Gulf, 
and Hunter including seam mapping and sampling were preliminary and 
reconnaissance in nature. These programs outlined coal bearing strata of the Eureka 
Sound Group and provided a basis to design future exploration programs. The work 
performed by Petro- Canada, Gulf, and Utah Mines established that the quality of 
the coal ranges from lignite to high-volatile bituminous C with low sulphur and low 
to moderate ash content. The structural setting is that of broad, open synclinal folds 
and normal faulting on both the Fosheim Peninsula and Strathcona Fiord areas. In 
order to advance the Property further additional exploration and data is required to 
gain increased confidence in the geological interpretations and seam thicknesses as 
identified in this Report. 

9.3 Drilling 
As far as AGL can determine, there has been no documented drilling on the Nunavut Coal 
Project. Hunter, a former holder of coal licenses within the Nunavut Coal Project area, noted old 
drums and plastic core tubes at their sample site 05DBP602 although no historic drilling results 
have been reported.  AGL notes that the plastic core tubes might have been used for ice coring 
rather than exploration drilling. 

9.4 Digital Elevation Model 
Canada Coal acquired a digital elevation model (DEM) for the Fosheim Peninsula and Sor 
Fiord/Stenkul Fiord areas in September 2011. Digital elevation models were acquired from 
PhotoSat of Vancouver, Canada. Elevation grids (2.5 m prisms) and contours (5/25/50/100m) 
were produced from high-resolution stereo satellite photos. Canada Coal purchased the satellite 
imagery and digital elevation models for approximately $129,000.  

AGL anticipates that the digital elevation mapping will assist with project planning for the 
budgeted exploration program. AGL notes that not all of the outlying license areas are covered 
by the existing digital elevation mapping, and that further mapping may be purchased as 
required.

10.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
AGL is reliant upon other experts for sample preparation, analyses, and security including 
Loring Laboratories and JP PetroGraphics of Calgary Alberta, and are also reliant on historic 
reports. Historic reports have been verified in part by recent independent site assessments 
conducted by ourselves as well as APEX in 2009 on behalf of Weststar. 

10.1 Historic Coal Sampling 
Historic coal sampling has been conducted within the Nunavut Coal Project at a reconnaissance 
scale. A summary of the known historical sample preparation, analyses, and security has been 
provided in the 2009 APEX report as follows: 

All historic reconnaissance sampling by Petro-Canada, Gulf, Utah Mines was 
restricted by permafrost. Descriptions of the effects of permafrost on the sampling 
are as follows: permafrost less than 0.5 m below surface led to difficulties in 
sampling fresh, unweathered coal seams in Petro-Canada's sampling; this led to 
shallow trench penetration and obscured coal zone lithological changes in Gulf's 
sampling; and Utah Mines sampling was limited to the rind of loose material and 
trenching was difficult beyond 7 to 15 cm (Panchy and Moorehouse, 1983, 
Swansbergson, 1982, and Cowley, 1982). Oxidation of coal near surface can affect 
the coal quality by increasing the moisture content, increasing the volatile content, 
and decreasing the calorific values. 
Gulf and Utah Mines also noted that ice lensing could falsely enhance true seam 
thicknesses while solufluxion created major slump blocks, repeated sections, and 
distort true bed thickness. 
During their 1981 exploration Gulf shipped all samples to Cyclone in Edmonton, 
Alberta for raw proximate analyses, calorific values and reported the values on an 
air dried basis. Reflectance analysis was conducted by Cascade Coal Petrography 
of Calgary. Reflectance values were reported for one of the two samples taken by 
Gulf on Weststar's Fosheim Peninsula area. 
Utah Mines did not provide a description of sample preparation in their report and 
their samples were submitted to Utah International Inc. Minerals Laboratory in 
Sunnyvale, California. Utah Mines reported raw proximate analysis and calorific 
values on an air dried basis. Utah International Inc. Minerals Laboratory also 
conducted the reflectance analysis. 
Petro Canada did not provide details of sample preparation during their 1982 
exploration other than that splits greater than 25 cm were removed and sampled 
separately from coal seam samples. Petro-Canada shipped all samples to Loring 
Laboratories of Calgary, Alberta ("Loring") for raw proximate analyses, calorific 
values, and specific gravity analyses and reported the values on an as received, air 
dried, and dry basis. After Loring completed their analysis, Petro Canada sent

twenty one of the samples to Cascade coal Petrography of Calgary for reflectance 
and maceral analysis... 
Petro-Canada noted that the petrographer was concerned for the validity of the 
results of the analyses. Because the samples were not cleaned, the high amount of 
mineral matter made some of the minerals difficult to spot and identify. Petro-
Canada further noted that rank determined by vitrinite reflectance becomes 
questionable below 0.3 Ro.  

10.2 Recent Sampling 
Sampling during 2005 was conducted by Dean Besserer (P.Geol.) of APEX Geoscience Ltd, 
Edmonton, Alberta. APEX flew their double bagged and sealed samples by helicopter to Grise 
Fiord where they were placed in a wooden crate, loaded on a barge and shipped to Montreal, 
Quebec, and then shipped by truck to Loring in Calgary, Alberta. Loring reported nothing 
unusual with respect to the shipments, once received.  

Sampling during 2011 was conducted by the authors (of AGL, Calgary, Alberta). AGL flew 
double bagged samples sealed in duct-taped coolers by fixed wing to Arctic Bay, and then via 
commercial air to Calgary, Alberta. AGL reported nothing unusual with the samples once they 
arrived at the Calgary office. Petrographic analysis for vitrinite reflectance was conducted by JP 
PetroGraphics of Calgary Alberta. 

Loring conducted raw proximate analysis on AGL and APEX's samples and reported the values 
on an as received, air dried, and dry basis. Loring is an International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO/IEC) 9001 accredited laboratory. The author has no reason to believe 
analyses completed by Loring were not conducted in accordance with industry standards and 
best practices. 

Raw coals submitted for proximate analysis to Loring are first subjected to a wet crush. The 
samples are then dried at 38°C for 72 hours and weighed. Sub-samples are then subjected to 
moisture content, ash content, volatile content, total sulphur content and calorific value analysis. 
Moisture content analysis involves weighing 1 gram (g) of the sample in a crucible. The crucible 
is then dried in an oven at 110°C for 1 hour. To determine ash content a 1 g sample is weighed 
into a crucible and cooked in a furnace at 750°C for 4 hours. Volatile content is determined by 
weighing 1 g of sample into a crucible and cooking in a furnace at 950°C for 7 minutes. Samples 
for moisture, ash and volatile content are allowed to cool after heating and are then reweighed. 
Total sulphur content is determined by placing a sample of known weight into a Leco Sulphur 
analyzer for 140 seconds at which point the total sulphur value is displayed. Calorific value is 
determined by placing 1 g of sample into an adiabatic bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the 
water vessel is recorded (T1). The sample is then combusted in a pure oxygen environment and 
the resultant change in temperature of the water vessel is recorded (T2). The total amount of 
energy released during the combustion of a sample can be determined by multiplying the change 
in temperature of the calorimeter system by the heat capacity of the calorimeter system and 
dividing by the number of grams of sample used.

10.3 Sample Analyses 
10.3.1. Analytical Methods 
Analytical coal testing methods can be subdivided into chemical, rheological, and petrographic 
tests. Chemical test methods include: moisture, volatile matter, ash yield, sulfur, forms of sulfur, 
ultimate analysis, chlorine, ash composition, ash fusion temperatures, trace elements, and 
calorific value. Rheological and physical test methods include: Gieseler fluidity, hardgrove 
grindability index, dilation tests, and free-swelling indices. Petrographic test methods include: 
maceral analysis and vitrinite reflectance. Some additional physical coal testing methods include: 
X-ray radiography, macroscopic analyses, apparent relative density, rock mechanics, and gas-
emission testing.  

10.3.2. Analytical Results 
Sample results from the recent AGL and APEX site inspections confirm historic reports that the 
coals in the Nunavut Coal Project vicinity range in rank from high volatile bituminous 'C' to 
lignite. Coals are generally low in ash (5-10%) and sulphur (<0.5%), although occasionally 
exhibit moderate ash values. Coals are considered to be suitable for use as a high quality thermal 
coal. 

Based on recent and historic sample analyses, Fosheim Peninsula remains the most prospective 
area for identifying a higher quality coal resource as coal rank at Fosheim Peninsula has been 
shown to increase with depth through the measured section. 

AGL petrographic sample results are detailed in Table 10.1. Loring laboratory analyses are 
detailed in Table 10.2.

11.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
AGL is extensively reliant on historic reports verified in part by AGL's independent site 
assessment and additional data verification conducted by APEX in 2009 on behalf of Weststar. 

AGL is unable to ascertain whether the all historic authors could be termed 'qualified persons' as 
defined by NI 43-101. Nevertheless, all available evidence suggests that the historic reports were 
prepared by competent professionals and can therefore be relied upon for information relating to 
prospective coal targets. 

11.1 AGL Data Verification 
AGL has relied upon Loring Laboratories and JP PetroGraphics' standard analytical protocols 
for sample analysis. The proposed work program will adhere to a more extensive data 
verification component.   

11.2 APEX Data Verification 
The following subsection is an excerpt from the 2009 APEX report. 

Loring preformed standard quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures 
with respect to the rock samples that were sent for analysis. Specifically, Loring 
conducts daily check analysis using in-house standard, blank and duplicate 
samples. The in-house standards are then validated against certified reference 
standards. Scales used to determine moisture, volatile and ash content are 
calibrated yearly and checked daily against certified weights to verify they are 
within tolerance limits. The data for all of these standard analyses were found to be 
within acceptable limits. 
Specific to this report Mr. D. Besserer collected all the APEX samples personally 
and without the help of others. As well, to the best of... (Mr. D. Besserer's) ability 
the samples were kept under the control of Mr. D. Besserer. Therefore... (Mr. D. 
Besserer) believes this data to be of acceptable quality and that the data was 
collected using current industry practices. 
(Mr. D. Besserer) has relied extensively on information pertaining to previous 
exploratory programs as contained in a number of proprietary and publicly 
available technical reports which have been listed in the references section. 
(Mr. D. Besserer) has performed no direct verification of previous sampling 
programs or analysis. There is, however, no reason to believe that prior results are 
not representative and/or unreliable. The previous work appears to have been 
conducted to industry standards at the time of the investigations and analysis. The 
writer is of the opinion that all of the technical reports reviewed for purposes of 
this current report were prepared by competent, qualified persons. 

AGL is satisfied that the 2009 APEX data verification program was conducted in accordance 
with NI 43-101 standards.

12.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
As far as AGL can determine, no mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been completed 
on the Nunavut Coal Project.

13.0 COAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
No coal resources are currently ascribed to the Nunavut Coal Project due to a lack of direct 
empirical data (such as drill hole, adit, trenching, or similar) aside from reported coal 
occurrences that have not been verified by AGL. Historically reported coal resources (not 
compliant with NI 43-101 standards) are reported under Section 6.2 (Historical Coal Resources). 

Coal resources are typically classified into the measured, indicated, and inferred categories in 
accordance with GSC 88-21 as well as the Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and 
Petroleum ("CIM") guidelines which are incorporated by reference in NI 43-101. In order to be 
classified as a resource, coal resources must exist in such form and quantity that there are 
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.  

Coal resources are not to be confused with 'coal in situ' quantities, which includes any 
occurrence of coal in the earth's crust that can be estimated and reported, irrespective of 
thickness, depth, quality, mineability, or economic potential. Nor should coal resources be 
confused with coal reserves, which include the economically mineable part of the measured and 
indicated coal resource and which need to be supported by appropriate assessments such as 
feasibility studies. 

Numerous historical inferred and in-situ coal resource estimates have been reported for the 
Nunavut Coal Project. The historic coal resources estimates comply with the speculative coal 
resource category in GSC 88-21 which no longer conforms with best practices in coal resource 
estimation, further mapping, trenching/sampling and drilling will be required to develop an 
appropriate resource estimate. AGL is treating the historic coal resource estimates as a potential 
target size which has been confirmed by the recent personal inspection.  

The potential quantity and grade of coal is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient 
exploration to define a coal resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the 
targets being delineated as a coal resource.

14.0 COAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
No coal reserves are currently ascribed to the Nunavut Coal Project due to a lack of direct 
empirical data (such as drill hole, adit, trenching, or similar) aside from reported coal 
occurrences that have not been verified by AGL, and insufficient information on mining, 
processing, economic, permitting, and other factors required to prepare a preliminary feasibility 
study.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no adjacent properties to the Nunavut Coal 
Project. There are some coal exploration licenses owned by another party located on western 
Axel Heiberg Island, however as far as the author is aware, no recent coal exploration activity 
has taken place on those licenses.

16.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
The project is in the preliminary stages of exploration. To the best of the author's knowledge, no 
coal production or development has ever occurred within the project area.  

16.1 Project Expenditures 
Project expenditures to date total approximately $540,000 plus coal exploration license 
acquisition and application fees. To the best of AGL's knowledge, all project expenditures have 
been incurred over the 2011 calendar year and no prior expenditures were incurred on behalf of 
Canada Coal. 

The project expenditures to date include the following estimated amounts: 

• $310,000 relating to the preparation of the technical report detailed herein, including a 
site assessment and follow-up project work; 

• $100,000 relating to community consultation; 

• $130,000 relating to the acquisition of satellite imagery over various project areas to be 
used as a basis for exploration program planning.

17.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
AGL has been able to confirm the widespread existence of coal within the Nunavut Coal Project.   
Recent site assessments and historic reports indicate that the coals range in rank from high 
volatile bituminous 'C' to lignite. Coals are generally low in ash (5-10%) and sulphur (<0.5%), 
although occasionally exhibit moderate ash values. Coals are considered to be suitable for use as 
a high quality thermal coal. Fosheim Peninsula remains the most prospective target based on the 
level of historic exploration, the region's potential for higher ranked coal occurrences, and the 
area's suitable geography for open-pit mining. 

At this stage the project is considered to be an early stage exploration project. Additional 
exploration will be required to further the historic understandings and geological interpretations, 
and also to advance the project to a stage where coal resources may be estimated in accordance 
with NI 43-101. 

The appropriate project authorizations for Phase 1 exploration have not yet been approved, 
however the planned exploration will have a relatively small impact on the environment and 
could provide considerable socio-economic benefit to the community. Although AGL cannot 
speak for the various Authorizing Agencies reviewing the project proposal, it is the author's 
opinion that Canada Coal stands a reasonable chance of getting Phase 1 approvals provided that 
they: 1) do not intend to conduct any exploration activities on Axel Heiberg Island, 2) do not 
intend to conduct exploration at Sor Fiord/Stenkul Fiord without further community consultation 
due to the sensitivity of the area, 3) maintain rigorous environmental monitoring protocols for all 
exploration areas particularly the Fosheim Peninsula, 4) set aside and preserve the fossilized 
forest within the Mokka Fiord area, 5) and continue with extensive community consultation 
throughout the project's lifecycle. 

Project expenditures to date total approximately $540,000 plus coal exploration license 
acquisition and application fees. Of the total, approximately $130,000 has been spent to acquire 
digital elevation mapping to assist with planning future exploration programs. 

The logistics of shipping a bulk commodity such as coal from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago 
remain challenging; however, the enormous potential target size of the coal within the Nunavut 
Coal Project warrants further exploration.

18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
• Coal is present within the Nunavut Coal Project in sufficient quantity and quality to merit 

further evaluation through an aggressive work program.  

• Fosheim Peninsula should be a priority target for the proposed work program based on 
the level of historic exploration, the region's potential for higher ranked coal occurrences, 
and the area's suitable geography for open-pit mining. 

• The Strathcona Fiord and Bache Peninsula regions should be explored for their potential 
during the proposed exploration program, as these licence areas regions could not be 
evaluated during the AGL 2011 site assessment.  

• Data compilation of historic reports and government assessments should be on-going to 
evaluate the potential of additional exploration areas in the Nunavut Coal Project. 

• Recently acquired digital elevation mapping should be integrated with existing 
geological, mapping, and sampling information. 

• Coal exploration licenses on Axel Heiberg Island should be either relinquished or set 
aside for archaeological studies as they occur in vicinity to the world-renown Geodetic 
Hills Fossil Forest. 

• Various studies, such as a preliminary shipping logistics study to determine viability of a 
coal mining operation in the High Arctic and an archaeological desktop constraints study 
to identify potentially sensitive project areas, should be commissioned by Canada Coal in 
conjunction with the proposed exploration program. 

• The community consultation process should remain ongoing throughout the project's 
lifecycle. 

18.1 Work Program 
AGL recommends two phased exploration program for the Nunavut Coal Project. Phase 1 
(Figure 18.1) will primarily be focused on reconnaissance including mapping and sampling to 
delineate and prioritize targets. Phase 2 is contingent on the results of Phase 1 and will consist of 
a drilling program to move the project forward to defining NI 43-101 compliant coal resources if 
possible.    

The proposed work budget includes a substantial contingency of 25%. This contingency was 
developed as a result of the recent personal inspection of the property by the authors. Significant 
transportation issues arose as a result of local shortages of jet fuel, weather and runway/landing 
strip conditions. Exploration in the high arctic presents many challenges and the contingency 
reflects the potential for additional aircraft requirements. 

AGL has been successful in extending the known strike length of many of the known coal 
measures. Additional sampling and structural mapping will be required to identify the most 
suitable areas for drilling. As well, the acquisition of a modern digital elevation model will 
substantially enhance the locations of known and newly identified outcrops.
