Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia

1. Summary 

The Metla property is a gold-silver-base metal prospect located in the Chechilda Range 

of the Coast Mountains in northwestern British Columbia. It is approximately 150 km south of 

town of Atlin and 150 km west of the town of Dease Lake. The property is centred at 58°22' 

north latitude and -132°35' west longitude. Access to the property is by helicopter from Atlin or 

Dease Lake. 

The Metla property consists of 7 contiguous mineral claims and covers an area of 

6,457.33 hectares. The claims are 100 percent owned by Stuhini Exploration Ltd. of Vancouver, 

B.C.  

Regionally, the property straddles the contact between the Jurassic quartz diorite of the 

Coast Plutonic Complex to the southwest and the sedimentary Palaeozoic to Lower Triassic 

Stikine Assemblage and Upper Triassic Stuhini Group volcano-sedimentary rocks to the 

northeast. These rocks are intruded by Late Cretaceous or Paleocene granite to felsic plugs of 

the Windy Table Suite. The Windy Table Suit is considered part of the Taku River-Trapper 

Lake-Tatsamenie Lake Cretaceous continental arc volcanoplutonic belt.  

On the property, northwest trending steep easterly dipping massive andesitic volcanic 

rocks are underlain by an interbedded series of andesite, pyritic mudstone, impure limestone 

and calcareous sediments. Extensive areas of phreatic or hydrothermal vent breccia occur 

cross cutting the volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The breccia is aligned in a northwesterly 

trending zone 800 metres wide by 2000 metres in length. The breccia consists of an iron rich 

pyritic carbonate matrix supporting clasts of volcanics, sediments and rarely sulphide (Mawer, 

1989). 

Gold mineralization was first discovered on the property in 1957. Follow up work in 1988 

identified a 1200 metre long by 800 metre wide boulder train with disseminated to massive 

quartz and sulphide that assayed up to 180 grams per tonne gold. Three styles of mineralization 

have since been recognized on the property and include the following; 

 Irregular massive to disseminated quartz and sulphide typically adjacent to 

carbonate hydrothermal breccia, often where argillite clasts predominate. 

 Massive to disseminated quartz and sulphide in beds as either replacement or 

syngenetic mineralization. 

 Disseminated sulphide within carbonate hydrothermal breccia veins. 

No mineral resources or reserves have been identified on the Metla property at this time.

Alteration minerals noted in petrographic studies suggests low to moderate mineralizing 

temperatures in line with a low to intermediate sulphidation system in the epithermal regime or a 

volcanogenic massive sulphide system with an associated feeder system. Notable geological 

features include the spatial association between the breccia bodies and the cross-cutting faults 

in the Metla Creek Area implying the structures play an important role as conduits for the 

mineralizing fluids. Moreover, sulphide mineralization is typically associated with or hosted by 

argillite or in breccia with abundant argillaceous clasts, suggesting that the chemistry of the 

argillites may influence the precipitation of the sulphides. Finally, the mineralization that occurs 

as sulphide stringers and stratabound layers conformable to bedding within the argillites may be 

genetically related to the fluids responsible for the mineralized breccia. 

Although limited drilling and extensive mapping and sampling has occurred on the 

property, the source of the mineralized boulders scattered throughout Metla Creek Area has not 

been determined or adequately tested. Two airborne geophysical surveys have been flown over 

the property. The first survey consists of a "Combined Magnetic, Electromagnetic and VLF 

Survey" flown by Aerodat Ltd. in 1991. More recently, a "Versatile Time Domain 

Electromagnetic (VTEM
TM

) Survey" was flown by Geotech Ltd. in 2018. The surveys have 

identified EM conductors, VLF-EM anomalies and VTEM
TM

 anomalies that occur within the 

vicinity of the mineralized boulder trains. 

The Metla property is considered greenfield exploration which refers to exploration in 

uncharted territory, where mineral deposits are not already known to exist.  The Metla Property 

is a grassroots project with limited exploration to date. Current recommendations include 

Maxwell Plate modeling of the recent airborne VTEM
TM

 geophysical survey, 1:10,000 scale 

geologic mapping with a focus on alteration and structure as well as drilling of identified 

geological and geophysical targets.

Mineral titles must be maintained in good standing with the Ministry of Energy 

and Mines by timely performance and recording of physical work or by payment of cash 

in lieu of work. Failure to record work or pay cash in lieu of work before the expiry date of 

tenure will result in immediate forfeiture of that tenure. Work requirements are $5.00 per 

hectare per year in years one and two, $10.00 per hectare per year in years three and 

four, $15.00 per hectare per year in years five and six, and $20.00 per hectare per year 

thereafter. Payments instead of exploration and development work are double the value 

of the corresponding work requirement. All the Metla tenures are currently in good 

standing to March 31
st
, 2019.  To extend the claims for one year to March 31

st
, 2020, 

expenditures of $69,574 are required. To extend the claims for a second year to March 

31
st
, 2021, expenditures of $84,546 are required. 

There are no known environmental liabilities on the Metla Property.  

A Mines Act permit is required for any work that disturbs the surface with 

mechanical equipment. Such a permit will include an approval of the current exploration 

program and mine plan, adequate protection of land and watercourses, and a 

reclamation program. Obtaining a Mines Act permit requires filling out an application, 

consulting with First Nations and posting a reclamation security bond with the province. 

The reclamation security bond is returned once the mine site has been reclaimed to a 

satisfactory level and there is no ongoing monitoring or maintenance requirements. The 

Mines Act also requires an operator to be aware of possible areas and items of 

archaeological significance, and to have in place measures to preserve for evaluation 

any "chance find" that may be recognized as part of exploration or development of a 

mineral property  

Currently Stuhini Exploration Ltd. has been issued a Mines Act permit and has 

posted a reclamation security bond of $42,000.00 with the Province of British Columbia.  

The Metla Property falls within the Tatsamine-Trapper Lake Resource 

Management Zone (RMZ). Area Specific Resource Management Zones (ASRMZs) are 

geographically defined areas where there is resource management direction for some 

resource values that are incremental to the General Management Direction (GMD). The 

management intent for Area Specific RMZs is to maintain the sensitive values or specific 

uses for which the zone has been designated while allowing for a mix of appropriate land 

uses consistent with the management intent for the zone. Mineral exploration and 

development is considered an appropriate land use in all Area Specific Resource 

Management Zones. The management directives are as follows: 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

9 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

 Major hydroelectric development is prohibited within this zone. Small 

hydroelectric development for local use is allowed, (e.g. to service local 

facilities such as cabins and lodges). 

 Minimize, mitigate and where possible avoid ground and in-stream 

disturbance within and adjacent to identified-salmon supporting waterways 

and spawning areas. 

 Continue to allow the lakes to be used as float plane access for early stage 

exploration. 

 Plan mineral exploration and development (and other industrial development) 

staging areas and other infrastructure to minimize the effects on the cultural, 

ecological, visual, recreation and wilderness vales of the RMZ, particularly 

from/on the lakes. Avoid using key cultural, ecological and/or recreation sites 

for staging areas and infrastructure. Consideration should be given to 

developing a set of guidelines for areal access for industry on the key lakes of 

the RMZ. 

Other than as outlined in this section of the technical report, there are no other 

recognized factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform 

work on the Metla Property. 

5. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1. Accessibility 

Current access to the property is by helicopter. The closest towns in B.C. are 

Atlin, 150 kilometres to the north and Dease Lake, 150 kilometres to the east. There is a 

mining exploration camp with an airstrip located on the Sutlahine River, about 30 

kilometres to the northwest. Trapper Lake, situated on the northern border of the claims 

is accessible by float plane. The closest road is the deactivated Golden Bear Mine road, 

25 kilometres to the southeast. 

5.2. Climate and Physiography 

The Metla Property is located in the Chechilda Range on the lee side of the 

Coast Mountain range and just west of the Stikine plateau. Elevations range from a low 

of 780 metres near Trapper Lake to a high of 2,253 metres at the peak of Mount 

Metlatulin. Terrain ranges from gentle to rugged. Treeline occurs between 1,000 and 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

10 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

1,200 metres with a valley forest cover composed of dwarf balsam fir with an 

undergrowth of willow and juniper bushes. Where vegetation is present above treeline, it 

consists of alpine meadows made up of heather, lupine and other alpine flowers. 

The climate in the area is typical of the lee side of the Coast Range Mountains 

with summer temperatures ranging from 5°C to 20°C, and winter temperatures ranging 

from -30°C to -10°C. Precipitation in the form of snow generally exceeds 1.5 metres of 

accumulation in a typical winter. Summer and early fall are the preferred exploration 

working seasons. At this stage of exploration, the costs and effort involved in removing 

snow and snow avalanche control make working in the winter not a viable option. 

Alpine glaciers have carved a rugged landscape and the property reflects its 

glaciated history with U shaped valleys consisting of steep cliffs and talus slopes along 

valley sides and flatter, ablation till and gravel covered valley bottoms. Grassy meadows 

occur at treeline and alpine glaciers exist at higher elevations. The glaciers have 

retreated significantly since the initial exploration programs. 

5.3. Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Metla property occurs on crown land in a remote and rugged part of 

northwestern B.C. Currently there is no infrastructure on or into the property. Any 

exploration or development work in the vicinity of the property will have to be entirely 

self-supporting in terms of infrastructure.  Mining operations, should they be warranted, 

will have sufficient areas for processing plant, mining camp, waste rock storage and 

tailings disposal. Potential air strip and camp site locations have been identified by 

Aspinall (2014).  There is no power available in the area and either a run of river power 

plant or diesel power plant would need to be built. Ample water is available from many 

local sources. The towns of Atlin and Dease Lake in British Columbia and the city of 

Whitehorse in the Yukon are sources of manpower for a potential mine. Skilled labour 

would most likely have to come from further afield. The past producer Golden Bear Mine 

is 25 kilometres to the southeast. There is a deactivated road to the old mine site.  

6. History 

Table 2 summarizes the work history on the Metla Property. The first detailed 

regional geology map of the Trapper-Tatsamenie Lake area was produced by Souther, 

the Tulsequah Map sheet (NTS 104K) (Map 1262A, 1971). Subsequent regional 

mapping conducted by the British Columbia Geological Survey (BCGSB) in areas north

Lithos Geological Inc. 

and south of Tatsamenie Lake was carried out by Oliver and Hodgson (1989, 1990), 

Bradford and Brown (1993), Oliver and Gabites (1993) and Oliver (1995). The BCGSB 

work looked at the geology and gold mineralization near Muddy Lake at the Golden Bear 

Mine (Oliver and Hodgson, 1989), the geochronology and polyphase deformation 

southeast of Tatsamenie Lake (Oliver and Gabites, 1993) and mapping the Tulsequah 

mine area (Mihalynuk et al., 1994; Sherlock et al., 1994; Sebert et al., 1995). 

Mineralization was first discovered in 1957 by Cominco prospectors working out 

of a camp near Trapper Lake. The Cominco crew sampled a brecciated feldspar 

porphyry dyke mineralized with pyrite, sphalerite and galena near the edge of a 

permanent ice and snow field. A sample from this showing assayed 0.32 ounces per ton 

gold, 1.4 ounces per ton silver, 0.1% copper, 0.2% lead and 1.0% zinc (Mawer, 1989). 

The BCGSB in conjunction with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) 

conducted a regional geochemical survey (RGS) of the 104K map sheet in 1987. A 

sample taken downstream of Metla Creek was not anomalous in any elements, however 

a stream draining north off of the Metla #5 claim was anomalous in copper and silver 

(samples 84104K-1127 and 1128). 

In 1988 Cominco followed-up on the RGS gold anomalies in the Tatsamenie 

Lake-Trapper Lake area. The Metla Creek 1957 discovery area was revisited and 

prospecting in the basin located mineralized float and outcrops of mineralized breccia. 

Preliminary sampling indicated anomalous gold values over an area 1200 metres long 

by 800 metres wide. A succeeding program in 1989 consisted of detailed prospecting, 

geological mapping, trenching and sampling of outcrop and float boulders. A total of 18 

trenches were drilled and blasted. Trenching returned results of up to 4.6 ppm gold 

across 9 metres. A total of 194 rock samples were taken and analyzed. Results included 

26% of the samples exceeding 5 ppm gold and 12% exceeding 10 ppm gold. The 

program identified a boulder train of mineralized float, with multi-element anomalies of 

gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic. In his summary report, Mawer (1989) 

recommended further exploration work. Figure 6.1 and 6.2 show the trench locations 

and results of the trenching and blasting. Figure 6.3 shows the location and results of the 

mineralized boulder trains. 

Cominco optioned the property to Galico Resources Inc. (Galico) in March of 

1991. Galico commissioned geophysics and drilling work on the property. A "Combined 

Helicopter-Borne Magnetic, Electromagnetic and VLF Survey" was flown by Aerodat Ltd. 

in 1991. Electromagnetic, magnetic and altimeter data were recorded both in digital and

analog forms. The flight line orientation was N70E, and the nominal flight line spacing 

was 100 metres. A total of 370 line kilometres was flown (Dvorak, 1991). Dvorak (1991) 

concludes that the EM anomalies and conductors in the Metla Creek Area constitute the 

most attractive conductor targets of the entire survey. They are associated with the best 

low resistivity zone, with an attractive VLF-EM anomaly, and a suite of interesting 

magnetic gradient anomalies. Further work was recommended on the identified 

conductors on the property. Late in 1991, Galico also completed 1,075 metres of BTW 

diamond drilling all of which was split and stored west of Trapper Lake. The core was 

moved to the Sutlahine River airstrip in 2011and to Atlin in 2013. Unfortunately the 

results of the drilling were never reported and no record of drill logs or assays have been 

located.  

Between 1991 and 2001 no new work was reported for the Metla property and in 

2001 the claims lapsed. Once the claims had lapsed, Clive Aspinall in partnership with 

James Dawson re-staked the Metla claims in May of 2002.  

In 2002 an exploration program saw 5 days of work designed to rapidly evaluate 

the southwest slopes of the Metla creek valley. A total of 14 rock samples were collected 

of which 5 were submitted for analysis. Results of the analysed rocks range from 24 to 

500 ppb gold and 56 to 68,484 ppm copper (Aspinall, 2002). A single day of re-logging 

of the 1991 Galico drill core was also completed during this time (Aspinall, 2002). 

The Mineral Deposit Research Unit (MDRU) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) 

began a research project in 2003 with the objective of examining a newly recognized 

Late Cretaceous volcanoplutonic complex in the Taku River area of the Stikine Terrane 

in northwest B.C. Evaluating the mineralization potential along the belt was also part of 

the project. Special emphasis was placed upon epithermal types of deposits. The Metla 

Property is believed to be a part of this volcanoplutonic belt. The results of this project 

are reported in Simmons et al. (2005). 

Solomon Resources Ltd (Solomon) entered into an option agreement on the 

property in 2004. At this time 8 additional contiguous claims were added to the property. 

Solomon conducted geological, geochemical and prospecting surveys. A total of 200 

rock samples (including 146 rock chip samples), 234 contour soil samples, and 18 

stream sediment samples were collected. Additionally, the drill core from Galico's

program in 1991 was re-logged and 5 select samples were sent for analyses (Tupper, 

2005). 

Indico Technologies Ltd. (Indico) entered into option agreement on the Metla 

property in 2006 immediately after Solomon terminated its option agreement with the 

Aspinall-Dawson partnership. Indico collected 129 rock samples for geochemical 

analysis and 10 rock samples for petrographic analysis. Accompanying the geochemical 

samples 1:2000 and 1:5000 satellite images were commissioned for the purposes of 

geological mapping. Indico left the agreement after this exploration campaign (Aspinall, 

2006). 

2008 saw a 7 day soil geochemical survey conducted by the Aspinall-Dawson 

partnership. In total 90 soil samples, 10 stream sediment silt samples, 11 float rock 

samples and 8 grab rock samples were collected and analysed (Aspinall, 2008). 

Ocean Park Ventures (Ocean Park) entered into an option agreement with the 

Aspinall-Dawson partnership in 2011. In August and September of 2011 a total of 19 

man days were spent prospecting the Metla claims based out of an exploration camp on 

the Sutlahine River. In total 76 rock samples were collected from the property including 

25 float and 51 grab samples. Samples were collected within a 4 square kilometre area 

in the valley of the retreating Metla glacier. Crew's also attempted to identify the location 

of Galico Resources 1991 drill collars. The 1991 drill core was rehabilitated by being 

placed into new core boxes where necessary, re-labeled with drill hole number and 

depths and finally moved to the camp on the Sutlahine River for storage (Clift, 2012). 

September of 2012, Ocean Park conducted a 36 man-day program of geological, 

geochemical and prospecting surveys on the Metla property. In total 72 rock samples 

were collected from the property including 7 float, 55 grab, and 10 composite or chip 

samples. The comprehensive mapping from the Solomon Resources program in 2004 

was digitized. Subsequent GPS controlled mapping from the 2012 program was added 

to the 2004 mapping (Theny and Wilkins, 2012). 

The QUEST-northwest Project re-released RGS data from and around the Metla 

claims in 2012. This program highlighted several multi-element anomalous samples in 

the area (Jackman, 2012).  

In 2013 a 3 day field program was conducted by Mr. Clive Aspinall. The objective 

was to ground truth a future grid suitable for an IP survey, to locate potential drill sites 

and to locate a potential camp. Concurrently, prospecting and 15 float rock samples

were collected for analysis. The 1991 drill core was moved from the Sutlahine River 

airstrip to Atlin, B.C. (Aspinall, 2014). 

In 2015 a 2 day field program was carried out by Mr. Clive Aspinall. The first day 

consisted of re-evaluating a proposed lading strip at the south end of Trapper Lake  The 

second day involved visiting Zone D of the Metla Creek Area with Dr. Mitch Mihalynuk, a 

senior project geologist with the B.C. Ministry of Mines and two geology students. A 

fossiliferous rock sample was taken for geochronology (Aspinall, 2015). 

In 2016 Barry Hanslit bought the claims from Mr. Clive Aspinall and Mr. James 

Dawson. Barry Hanslit subsequently sold the Metla claims to Stuhini Exploration Ltd. in 

2017.

7.1. Regional Geology 

The property straddles the Coast and Intermontane Geomorphologic Belts, with 

the southwest portion of the claims within the Coast Belt and the northeast part of the 

claims within the Intermontane Belt, as defined by Wheeler and McFeely (1987). The 

property occurs in the Stikinia island arc terrane, which accreted to the western margin 

of Laurentia between Early to Late Jurassic and was subsequently deformed during 

Cretaceous and older orogenesis (Coney et al. 1980; Monger et al. 1982; Wheeler et al. 

1991; Mihalynuk et al. 1994; Nelson et al. 2013; Barresi et al. 2014; Figure 7.1). Stikinia 

is comprised of well stratified Lower Devonian to Middle Jurassic volcanic and 

sedimentary rock packages which include Asitka, Stikine, Lewis River, Hazelton and 

Takwahoni assemblages. These rocks are underlain by volcanic and sedimentary rocks 

of the Stuhini Group which are in contact with intrusive rocks of the Coast Range 

Batholith. The Stuhini group is comprised of andesite and basalt flows, pillow lavas, 

green augite-phyric pillowed flows, volcanic breccia, lapilli tuff, feldspar phyric flows,

massive Norian limestones, argillites and siltstones. Included in the Stuhini group is the 

Sinwa Formation limestones and their accompanying minor sedimentary rocks (Souther, 

1971; Bradford and Brown, 1993; Mihalynuk et al., 1994).  

A fault contact with the Cache Creek Terrane occurs to the east of Stikinia. 

Relationships on its western margin generally have been obscured by Cretaceous and 

Tertiary plutonism, displacement along the Tintina fault and metamorphism in the Coast 

Belt (Sherlock et al., 1994; Nelson and Payne, 1994; Nelson and Colpron, 2007). A Late 

Cretaceous volcanic to subvolcanic plutonic rock assemblage occurs on the eastern 

margin of the Coast Plutonic belt. The lithologies intrude the Stikinia terrane (Mihalynuk 

et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2005). 

U/Pb zircon ages have dated several volcanoplutonic complexes close to the 

Metla Property. Ages determined range from 82.2±0.2Ma to 87.3±0.7Ma for the Windy 

Table Suite and 93±1Ma for the Thorn Stock (Simmons et al, 2005). These igneous 

lithologies were previously considered correlative to the ~55Ma Sloko Group. Several 

small intrusive stocks have been located on the Metal property, they are considered 

correlative to the Late Cretaceous rocks dated by Simmons et al. (2005). Several 

epithermal, porphyry and replacement type deposits have been associated to Late 

Cretaceous igneous bodies in the area. 

To the south, both the Coast Range intrusive rocks and the Stuhini Group are 

intruded by the Sloko Group intrusive rocks. Regionally, sedimentary rocks are weakly to 

strongly altered and variably deformed. Alteration is weak and limited to rocks in contact 

with younger magmatic rocks. North-northwest verging open to close folds and post-

accretionary normal faults deform the sedimentary rocks (Simmons et al., 2005). 

To the Northeast of the property lies the Nahlin thrust fault. The Nahlin fault is 

northwest oriented and northeast dipping; it marks a terrane boundary separating the 

Cache Creek terrane to the northeast and the Stikine terrane to the southwest (English 

et al., 2004). The Nahlin fault defines the southern boundary of the Atlin Horst. To the 

southwest of the Nahlin fault lays the northwest-west trending King Salmon thrust fault 

which dips towards the northeast. According to Evenchick et al. (2005) emplacement of 

Cache Creek onto Stikinia in the Early and early Middle Jurassic occurred along the King 

Salmon fault. However, Mihalynuk et al. (2009) argue that the King Salmon fault does 

not represent a terrane boundary, but rather an important fault that carries the Sinwa 

Formation. To the south of the King Salmon thrust fault, rocks are folded into plunging 

northwesterly trending symmetrical folds with minor faulting and shearing (Souther, 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

22 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

1971). The Whitehorse trough occurs between the Nahlin and King Salmon faults 

(English, 2004). 

To the south and west of Tatsemenie Lake occurs the Stikine assemblage, 

consisting of rocks from the upper Paleozoic including recrystallized limestones, 

dolomitic limestones, minor chert and argillite (Souther, 1971; BCGS; Bradford and 

Brown, 1993; Oliver and Gabites, 1993; Oliver, 1995). These rocks are overlain by fine 

grained clastic metasedimentary and intercalated meta-volcanic rocks mostly altered to 

greenstone and phyllite as well as chert, jasper, greywacke and limestone. Other Stikine 

assemblage rocks include rhyolite and felsic volcanic rocks, marine sedimentary rocks 

and a sequence of coarse clastic and volcanoclastic rocks. 

East and west of Tatsemenie Lake strongly foliated diorite, minor granodiorite 

and quartz diorite intrusive rocks are found in large bodies believed to be lower or middle 

Triassic (Souther, 1971; Oliver and Gabites, 1993). To the north of Trapper and 

Tatsemenie Lakes the Laberge group of lower to middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks are 

found and include the Inklin and Takwahoni formations. The Inklin formation consists of 

well banded greywacke, siltstone, silty sandstone, mudstone, and limy pebble 

conglomerates. The Takwahoni formation is comprised of granite-boulder/chert pebble 

conglomerate, greywacke, quartz sandstone, siltstones and shales (Souther, 1971; 

Oliver and Gabites, 1993). 

The Stikinia Terrane is host to many major polymetallic massive sulphide, gold 

and copper-gold porphyry deposits in the region (Tulsequah Chief, Eskay Creek, Snip, 

Golden Bear, Premier-Silbalk, Red Mountain, Galore Creek, Suphurets, Schaft Creek, 

Red Chris). Mihalynuk (1999), Mihalynuk et al. (2003) and Simmons et al. (2005) 

describe a NNW-trending Late Cretaceous volcano-plutonic arc that they have mapped 

from at least the Golden Bear Mine area to the B.C.-Yukon border. 

7.2. Local and Property Geology 

The geological setting of the Metla Property is illustrated in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. 

Photographs of lithological units seen at the Metla Property are shown in Figure 7.4. The 

north part of the Metla Property is believed to be underlain by mostly volcanic rocks 

belonging to the Upper Triassic Stuhini Group and lesser sediments and volcanics 

belonging to the older Paleozoic Stikine Assemblage. The south part of the property is 

underlain by mostly Middle to Late Triassic quartz diorite belonging to the Coast Range 

Complex. This basement has been intruded by small intrusive stocks that are believed to

be part of the Late Cretaceous continental volcanoplutonic arc of northwestern B.C. as 

defined by Mihalynuk et al. (1999, 2003) and Simons et al. (2005). At the Metla property, 

Cretaceous subaerial volcanic and sedimentary rocks are rare; however, they make up 

important strata from the other volcanic centres located elsewhere in the area including 

Lisadele Lake and the Thorn Property. The volcanic and plutonic rocks are part of a 

northwesterly trending magmatic belt with associated hydrothermal alteration and 

sulphide mineralization including epithermal, porphyry and replacement type deposits 

(Simmons et al., 2005). 

Initial property scale mapping was undertaken by Cominco crews, starting in 

1988. Mawer's report (1989) documented the following observations of the Metla 

Property: 

The northwesterly striking, steep easterly dipping massive andesite, 

agglomerates and tuffs underlie the property. Massive andesite grading into a crackle 

breccia with un-rotated fragments with minor matrix to a central area with matrix 

supported, rotated, milled and partially altered clasts have been observed. The massive 

andesitic volcanics are underlain by a sequence of interbedded andesite, pyritic argillite, 

mudstone, impure limestone, calcareous sediments, white-grey fine laminated chert and 

siliceous grits. All the foregoing described rocks are intruded or cut by large areas of 

phreatic or hydrothermal vent breccia consisting of a tan to dark brown weathering grey 

to green pyritic carbonate and/or siliceous matrix. The matrix supports clasts of volcanic 

rocks with sediments from pebble size to large blocks of several metres in length and 

width. The clasts are randomly oriented and may have alteration rims grading to almost 

completely altered clasts of sericite or fuchsite. The contacts of the hydrothermal vent 

breccia with relatively undisturbed volcanic rocks and sediments are very sharp with little 

or no alteration and the configuration of some of the exposed contacts indicates scouring 

or gullying of the intruded rock. 

Detailed 1:500 scale geological mapping by Cominco from 1988 to 1990 (Mawer, 

1989) focused on the principal Metla Creek Area (MCA). The detailed mapping as well 

as petrographic work completed on behalf of Galico personnel (Payne, 1991) and 

Solomon (McLeod, 2004) was incorporated into 1: 2,000 and 1: 20,000 scale mapping 

completed by Solomon crews in 2004. Many of the units from regional mapping by 

Souther (1971) are analogous to units from Tupper (2005); units 6, 7, 14, 16, and 19 of 

Souther correlate to units 6, 4, 8, 7 and 11 of Tupper, respectively. The following 

description of the property geology is taken from Tupper's report (2005).

The major rock units on the property include: 

 Unit 1 - Sedimentary rocks, possibly of the Palaeozoic-Lower Triassic Stikine 

Assemblage; limited to MCA; 

 Unit 2 & 3 - A suite of mafic to ultramafic intrusive igneous rocks; associated 

with Stikine Assemblage rocks; age uncertain, probable Lower Triassic; 

limited to MCA; 

 Unit 4 - Volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Upper Triassic Stuhini 

Group; 

 Unit 6 - Quartz Diorites of the Mesozoic Coast Plutonic Complex  

 Unit 7 & 8 - Late Cretaceous to Paleocene felsic stocks (Unit 7) and 

associated volcanic rocks (Unit 8), (formerly mapped as Sloko-Hyder and 

Sloko Groups respectively). 

 Unit 9 - Ankerite hydrothermal breccia unit of both uncertain age and origin; 

limited to MCA. 

Sedimentary rocks of the Palaeozoic Stikine Assemblage (unit 1), mapped by 

provincial government surveys, straddles the south boundary of Metla # 6. Sedimentary 

rocks within the MCA outcrop along the south side of valley and are also proposed to be 

part of the Stikine Assemblage. In the MCA, these rocks include highly faulted, tightly 

folded and contorted argillaceous sediments that are comprised of thick to thin-bedded 

argillite, chert, wacke, mudstone and calcareous siltstone. The unit is frequently 

graphite-bearing, dark grey to flaggy weathering. Thin, discontinuous pyritic bedding 

replacements to 20 centimetres thick are common, comprising between <0.5% and 3% 

of outcrop. Pale grey siliceous pebble conglomerate (?) to 0.6 m thickness has been 

noted in the east part of the MCA. 

Intruded into the proposed Stikine Assemblage sediments at the MCA are a 

number of small, distinctively massive and well jointed, mafic intrusive bodies. A roughly 

6 ha, irregular Y-shaped body of medium grey to dark greenish-grey, medium to fine 

grained plagioclase rock and distinctive epidote veinlets extends roughly northwest-

southeast through the middle of the MCA (unit 2). The unit forms a resistant outcrop 

feature. Drill core from 1991 and re-logged in 2004 suggests the bodies to be 20m to 

50m thick sills. Petrographic studies of specimens from this unit have identified it as 

either diorite and/or gabbro. At several locations the unit has been observed to have little 

by way of ferromagnesian minerals and to be very light coloured, suggesting a shift to 

anorthosite (Blackwell, 1991). Irregular calcite veins are common along the northernmost 

(lower?) contact of the gabbro unit. They are commonly associated with magnetite, with

or without accompanying coarse pyrite or specularite, psuedomorphing the calcite. 

Numerous small (0.2-1.0 ha) plugs of gabbro/diorite occur scattered within the 

sedimentary rocks. Although its relationship to the above is not known, a larger plug of 

altered hornblende diorite (unit 2a) with local zones of intense carbonate alteration has 

been mapped to the south. 

Pyroxenite (unit 3) occurs in a cluster of small outcrops in the centre of the MCA. 

Its relation to other intrusive units is not known, although it is likely the result of melt 

differentiation of the gabbro. The rock is black-coloured, composed of very coarse 

grained pyroxene. Disseminated magnetite, pyrite, and trace chalcopyrite are noted. 

Regionally, the Stuhini Group rocks include andesite to basalt flow, flow and 

pyroclastic breccia, and tuff (unit 4). These rocks tend to be massive, with internal 

contacts difficult to locate and measure. The unit includes pillowed and amygdaloidal 

flows. The metamorphic rank is greenschist or less, with some hand samples appearing 

to contain prehnite as vesicle in-fillings (Blackwell, 1991; based on Mawer, 1989).  

The Stuhini Group volcanics unconformably overly those of the Stikine 

Assemblage. Within the MCA, the Stuhini Group rocks are dominated by pale to medium 

green weathering, green andesite tuffs and tuffaceous sediments (unit 4a), tuffaceous 

breccia (unit 4b) and lapilli tuff (unit 4c). A distinct, 15m wide, medium green augite 

porphyry unit (unit 4d) strikes roughly 125 m northwest through the MCA. The unit 

occurs in spatial association with both the contact between rocks of the Stikine 

Assemblage and the Stuhini Group and a property-scale north-northwest trending fault. 

This unit is included here as being a porphyritic basalt flow, although thin section work 

has identified it as both a basalt flow (Payne, 1991) and a mafic dyke (McLeod, 2004). 

The unit has been observed hosting cross-cutting hydrothermal stockwork breccia veins 

(unit 9d). Dark green, fine grained intermediate dykes (unit 5) occur within the Stuhini 

Group Volcaniclastics, although only observed in one location in the valley bottom 

southeast of camp. A large Mesozoic quartz diorite stock (unit 6) of the Coast Plutonic 

Complex extends roughly west-north west across the entire south third of the Metla 

Property. The unit is typically massive with occasional shears that are mineralized with 

pyrite ± gold ± chalcopyrite ± molybdenite. 

Regional mapping by the provincial BCGSB have mapped four small, isolated 

Late Cretaceous-Paleocene intrusive plugs (unit 7) on the west half of the property. 

These intrusive plugs range between 50 ha and 300 ha and vary in composition from a

single alkali feldspar granite body (unit 7b) to three high level quartz phyric felsic 

intrusive units (unit 7a) (Souther, 1971; Simmons et al, 2005). The higher silica content 

of three of the more easterly intrusive plugs suggests they may be of the younger, 

82.2±1 Ma Windy Table Suite. They are associated with abundant vuggy quartz vein 

stockwork and have an arsenic + molybdenum ± zinc geochemical signature. Subaerial 

dacite to rhyolite volcanic rocks (unit 8; formerly referred to as Sloko Group) are present 

along the southeast perimeter of the Metla Property in the area of the Rod prospect. 

These include dacite heterolithic breccia (unit 8a); rhyolite tuff and tuffaceous sediments 

(unit 8b) and andesite tuff (unit 8C). 

Hydrothermal breccia (unit 9) comprises an enigmatic unit of clearly crosscutting 

nature and intrusive origin, occurring as large irregular-shaped to crudely northwest-

trending bodies throughout the central and northwestern portions of the MCA. 

Dimensions range from a few square meters to 130 by 300 meters. The breccia matrix 

consists of ankerite + siderite + dolomite with variable proportions of pyrite, quartz, 

fuchsite (?) and base metal sulphide minerals. The clasts vary from sand to block-sized 

(maximum observed dimensions of 2.0 meters) fragments of volcanic (unit 9a), 

sedimentary (unit 9b) and less commonly gabbro country rock, re-brecciated breccia 

material and rarely massive sulphide. Where observed, contacts with the adjacent 

country rock are sharp, with little or no alteration. Detailed observation suggests that 

breccia emplacement was accompanied by considerable mechanical abrasion or erosion 

of the country rock, as exposed contacts appear to be scoured or "gullied" by the breccia 

body (Mawer, 1989). Elsewhere the breccia has been observed to have a border or 

margin phase of fractured country rock, presenting the appearance of a "crackle 

breccia", with fracture-infillings similar to that seen in the main breccia body. The 

marginal phase of the breccia proper has a "stockwork" texture consisting of variably 

detached and slightly rotated wall fragments, which in turn become increasingly 

spherical, milled and matrix supported as the central regions of the breccia body are 

approached. Clasts are in general randomly oriented, without evidence of stretching or 

other imposed tectonic fabric. Clasts are invariably altered, depending upon original clast 

composition, to carbonate ± fuchsite and possibly talc and white mica ("sericite"). Quartz 

is relatively rare, observed most frequently in association with sulphide mineralization. A 

possible late alteration phase has been noted, manifest as stringers of buff-coloured, 

brown to red-weathering coarse grained ferromagnesium carbonate minerals. Most 

mineralization observed to date appears to be hosted by the hydrothermal breccia, as a

border phase, or in fractured, adjacent country rock. In some instances sulphide 

minerals are the sole matrix material. 

Mafic lamprophyre (?) dykes (unit 10) appear to be the youngest intrusive phase 

mapped to date, cutting all other rock units, including the hydrothermal breccia. The 

narrow (<1.0 meter), light to medium green to grey-coloured, dykes strike irregularly for 

up to 500 metres, following both north-northwest and northeast trending structures in the 

MCA. Xenoliths of country rock are locally abundant. Dyke margins are chilled and 

calcite filled vesicles have been observed. The Metla Property has until recently been 

covered by a glacier and subsequent ablation has resulted in the deposition of an 

extensive veneer of ablation till (unit 11b) and moraine, which rests upon highly polished 

bedrock outcrop and isolated, highly compacted basal till. On the basis of field 

observations and tracing of indicator boulders, it is thought that the degree of glacial 

dispersion is in the order of only 80 to 150 meters, or often less. Recent alluvium (unit 

11a) and reworked glacial fluvial deposits are also present, although more commonly in 

the main lower elevation valleys. 

7.2.1. Mineralization 

Mawer (1990) described the gold bearing sulphide mineralization to occur in 

outcrop and float as wispy bands, breccia matrix and fracture fillings, the mineralization 

consists of very fine to coarse granular pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena, 

magnetite, chalcopyrite, hematite, boulangerite, bournonite, tetrahedrite and native gold 

or electrum. He further described that the location of the sulphides appears to be mainly 

adjacent or peripheral to the main breccia zones. Tupper (2005) also concluded that the 

most significant mineralization at the Metla Property is present in the Metla Creek Area, 

and further suggested that it was possibly related to two or more genetic types, including 

epigenetic, carbonate hydrothermal breccia hosted and bedding parallel sulphide 

replacements. Photographs of the different styles of mineralization observed at Metla are 

depicted in Figure 7.5. The most significant mineral occurrences are epigenetic, hosted 

by carbonate hydrothermal breccia. The hydrothermal breccia mineralization consists of 

irregular massive to disseminated base metal sulphide accompanied by gold and silver. 

From field observations, the principal occurrence of mineralization is within or adjacent 

to outcrop areas of "hydrothermal breccia", often where argillite clasts predominate. 

Sulphide minerals are most abundant as matrix to the breccia and this sulphide 

mineralization is concentrated near the margins of the breccia bodies (Tupper, 2005). A 

bright green micaceous alteration mineral (fuchsite?) occurs associated with the

hydrothermal silver + lead + zinc (gold + copper) mineralization from the adjacent Thorn 

Property was dated by Simmons et al. (2005). Sericite from the mineralized matrix, 

enclosed in pyrite + sphalerite + boulangerite mineralization from the Thorn Property 

provided an Ar/Ar age of 87.7±0.6 Ma. This Late Cretaceous age suggest that the 

mineralization at the Thorn Property and perhaps the Metla Property could be 

associated with a hydrothermal system produced by a 93 Ma suite of intrusions 

(Simmons et al., 2005). 

Another style of mineralization occurs as locally folded, conformable mineralized 

bands which could be syngenetic, or bedding replacements. Although the latter 

replacement style mineralization is generally auriferous and fairly ubiquitous throughout 

the Metla Creek Area (Mawer, 1990), they are sporadic and typically less than a few 

decimetres in width.  

Work completed by Cominco, identified significant mineralized gold + silver + 

sulphide boulder trains that are considered to be locally derived from areas up ice of the 

known mineralization in the Metla Creek Area. Cominco personnel reported a small 

occurrence of niccolite and gersdorffite roughly north of Area E where a small gabbro 

plug is transected by a strong NNE trending fault. This zone is referred to as Area H in 

this report. The nickel mineralization has not been followed up on to date. Work 

performed in 2011 suggested that several different lithologies hosted anomalous 

mineralization (Clift, 2012). 

Detailed ore microscopy examinations made of some 67 mineralized polished 

sections (McLeod, 1990) collected in 1989 from the Metla Creek Area, from both outcrop 

and glacial float boulder samples, identified the following ore minerals (listed in order of 

relative abundance: Pyrite, Sphalerite, Arsenopyrite, Chalcopyrite, Galena, Magnetite, 

Tetrahedrite, Pyrrhotite, Gold/Electrum, Bournonite, Niccolite, Gersdorffite, Hematite, 

Stibnite, and Boulangerite. The following is taken from McLeod's report (1990). 

Pyrite is very common, followed by sphalerite. Chalcopyrite, although significantly 

less common is the most ubiquitous mineral in the suite after pyrite. Galena occurs 

sporadically, most commonly in association with sphalerite. Sphalerite, galena, and 

chalcopyrite are commonly associated with pyrite, occurring as interstitial infillings, and 

grain boundary and fracture replacements. Sphalerite has a positive association with 

galena and tetrahedrite, but a negative association with magnetite. Silver and silver 

sulfosalts are associated with tetrahedrite and galena. Gold or electrum was identified 

microscopically in 30 of the 67 sections. It was commonly seen to replace factures in

pyrite, and possibly is included in chalcopyrite that replaces those fractures in pyrite. 

Gold is also seen to occur within and along magnetite and pyrite grain boundaries. 

Limited gold was observed within galena and possibly replacing arsenopyrite, with or 

without chalcopyrite. Gold grains ranged in size from 75-100 microns. Pyrite and 

possibly arsenopyrite were concluded to be the primary mineralization, with rocks 

subsequently healed by base metals accompanied by gold. 

The Metla Creek Area, as referred to by Tupper (2005), is located entirely within 

the Metla #1 claim. Solomon collected a total of 164 rock samples and one soil sample 

in the area. Bedrock mineralization has been identified in seven areas identified as Area 

A through Area G and described in more detail below; UTM coordinates provide general 

locations for each area. Descriptions of the areas are taken from Tupper's report (2005). 

Area A Location: UTM: 6,474,625N / 639,850E 

Area A was identified as coincident with an EM anomaly and numerous 

auriferous heavy sulphide boulders identified over an area of 90 metres by 40 metres 

(20 boulders averaging 0.632 grams per tonne gold; Mawer, 1989). Galico drilled holes 

M91-03-01, -02, 03 and 04 into Area A.  

The area is underlain by folded and faulted argillites, a gabbro sill (?) up to 50m 

thick. At the faulted contact with the gabbro, the argillites are intensely rusty weathering. 

The argillites are intruded by numerous small, highly irregular to elongate, matrix 

dominated, heterolithic carbonate breccia bodies.  

In 2004, Solomon crews collected 25 chip samples of every lithology with 

generally low results. A 1 metre chip sample of hydrothermal breccia with 1% 

disseminated pyrite assayed 1.5 grams per tonne gold and 10.1 grams per tonne silver 

(M04A-C10). 

Area B Location: UTM: 6,474,700N / 639,650E 

Area B was identified as coincident with an EM anomaly, 32 auriferous heavy 

sulphide boulders (32 boulders averaging 0.271 grams per tonne gold; Mawer, 1988, 

1989, 1990; Blackwell 1991). Grab samples collected by Cominco of numerous minor 

bedding parallel sulphide stringers or replacements in argillite returned values of 1,122 

to 6,200 ppb gold (Mawer, 1990). Galico drilled holes M91-03-05, 06 and 07 in Area B. 

Area B is underlain by hydrothermal breccia argillites and a gabbro sill (?). Two 

continuous chip samples of pyritic hydrothermal breccia collected in Area B by Solomon 

produced a weighted average of 920 ppb gold across a total width of 3.9 metres (M04A-

C49 & -C50). Solomon crews collected an additional 23 chip sample in Area B, but all 

assayed less than 100 ppb gold. 

Area C Location: UTM: 6,474,850N / 639,450E 

Area C hosts a 0.2 metre by 5 metre shear vein (?) within hydrothermal breccia 

of semi-massive to massive sphalerite and pyrite that assays up to 5.4 grams per tonne 

gold, 13.97% zinc and 1.33% lead (Mawer, 1989). Eleven boulders collected by 

Cominco averaged 0.274 grams per tonne gold (Mawer, 1989). Galico drill hole M91-03-

07 was designed to intersect the massive sulphide mineralization, but was not 

successful. Re-brecciated hydrothermal breccia material is common in outcrop in Area 

C. A 2.5 metre chip sample collected by Solomon crews assayed 578 grams per tonne 

gold, 32.9 grams per tonne silver, 1.72% zinc and 0.34% lead (M04A-C52). The other 23 

chip samples collected by Solomon crews in Area C were below 22 ppb gold. 

Area D Location: UTM: 6,475,050N / 639,450E 

Area D is the original 1957 prospecting discovery, comprising roughly 8 metre by 

30 metre area of irregular and discontinuous, massive to disseminated pyrite ± 

sphalerite ± galena ± chalcopyrite ± arsenopyrite mineralization in outcrop at the south 

perimeter of the large 200 metre by 150 metre exposure of hydrothermal breccia. 

Cominco sampling produced one 9.0 metre chip sample that assayed 4.7 grams per 

tonne gold and 41 boulders averaging 0.194 grams per tonne gold (Mawer, 1989). Area 

D has not been drilled. 

The hydrothermal breccia in Area D is predominantly composed of large (0.5 

metres to 2.0 metres) clasts of andesite flows and tuffaceous sediments separated by a 

stockwork of carbonate veins. The clasts decrease in size and the matrix becomes more 

dominant towards the south. The sulphide rich zone is located where the breccia unit is 

more heterolithic along the south contact with the argillites. It is comprised of a breccia 

zone where massive to semi-massive, discontinuous sulphide matrix trends roughly 

northeast, sub-parallel to the argillite contact. 

Of the additional 25 chip samples collected by Solomon in Area D, 7 samples 

assayed between 200 ppb and 706 ppb gold; the remaining 18 samples were below 140 

ppb gold. 

Area E Location: UTM: 6,474,425N / 640,175E 

Mineralization in Area E is comprised of a zone of discontinuous and highly 

irregular massive pyrite-sphalerite-galena stringer veins of less than 0.2 metres by 1.0 

metre. The zone of veining extends for roughly 100 metres east-southeast within

argillites and hydrothermal breccia where they are in contact with a gabbroic sill (?) to 

the south. Fourteen shallow trenches were drilled and blasted by Cominco crews in 1989 

at Area E. A single sample in the middle of the area returned 11.5 grams per tonne gold 

in assay, across 1.0 metre (Mawer, 1989). 

Target E has significantly elevated silver values compared to the other showings 

in the MCA. Cominco collected samples from a total of 49 boulders in Area E that 

averaged 0.225 grams per tonne gold (Mawer, 1988, 1989, 1990; Blackwell 1991). Drill 

hole M91-03-08 was located to test the mineralization at Area E but was unsuccessful. 

Solomon collected a total of 21 samples in Area E, but only 3 of the remaining 15 

assayed above 200 ppb gold.  

Area F Location: UTM: 6,474,150N / 640,525E 

The occurrence in Area F has been described as a conformable siliceous quartz 

conglomerate, but may be better described as a bedding-parallel siliceous pyritic breccia 

vein (?) hosting discontinuous zones of pyrite-galena- sphalerite. It is hosted in argillites 

roughly paralleling the Stuhini Group volcanoclastic contact to the north. The vein 

appears to be folded with the surrounding country rock. Exposures of the vein, which is 

locally up to 60 centimetres thick, can be traced for up to 210 meters. Drill hole M91-03-

10 failed to intersect this vein. Similar to Area E, high silver values distinguish Area F 

from the more western occurrences. The only sample collected by Solomon crews 

assayed 3.7 grams per tonne gold, 117 grams per tonne silver, 3.1% lead and more than 

10% zinc over 0.6 metres (M04D-C07). 

Area G Location: UTM: 6,474,675N / 640,000E 

The gabbro intrusive hosts numerous irregular veins of calcite ± specularite ± 

pyrite ± magnetite along its north (lower?) contact. A grab sample of calcite-magnetite 

vein with a selvage of coarse pyrite assayed 2.2 grams per tonne gold, 15.2 grams per 

tonne silver, 1.4% zinc and 1.0% arsenic (sample M04D-R11). The specularite occurs as 

bladed pseudomorphs of the calcite and the pyrite occurs as very coarse euhedral 

grains along the vein margins. 

Metla Creek Area (MCA) – Other Sampling 

A number of other isolated mineralized occurrences are located in the MCA, 

including a pyrite-arsenopyrite-fuchsite (?) mineralized NE trending shear hosted 

carbonate vein on the north side of the creek east of the camp that assayed 2.4 grams 

per tonne gold and 5.6 grams per tonne silver (sample M04D-R06). A single soil sample 

was collected in the MCA within a narrow gully on the north slope above camp where a

prominent NNW trending carbonate altered shear zone is located. Sample M04D-S01 

was anomalous in a number of elements, assaying 206 ppb gold, 26.1 ppm silver, 738 

ppm copper, 1,819 ppm arsenic, 28 ppm antimony and 21 ppm molybdenum. The high 

geochemical response may be due to mechanical concentration within the gully as no 

significant mineralization was noted along the shear to an elevation 1,350 metres. Two 

samples (M04D-WR12 & -WR15) were collected in the MCA for petrographic analysis. 

Sample M04D-WR12 was also submitted for whole rock analysis.  

Prospecting – Regional Target Areas 

Reconnaissance mapping, prospecting and the collection of 40 rock samples, 

234 reconnaissance contour soil samples and 18 stream sediment samples was 

undertaken in 2004 on six additional Regional Target Areas. These areas are 

summarized below: 

RTA-1 (Metla Creek Glacier West) 

To the southeast along the west and east perimeter of the Metla Creek glacier on 

the Metla #1 and #6 claims; UTM: 640,780E / 6,473,000N.  

A single contour soil line was extended up along the west side of the Metla Creek 

Glacier. Although the presence of ablation till and lateral moraine made sampling difficult 

and throws some doubt into the results, every effort was made to sample only colluvial 

soils and talus fines. The results are encouraging with 12 samples of a total of 39 

samples greater that 80 ppb gold (95th percentile for gold in soils on the Metla Property) 

to a high of 252 ppb gold. A second line with tighter sample interval of 25m was sampled 

above the previous line, repeating the results; but failing to isolate the source of the 

anomaly. The anomaly overlies Mesozoic quartz diorite near its contact with the Stikine 

Assemblage argillites of the MCA. Prospecting failed to identify any significant 

mineralization in the area. A total of 57 soil samples and 3 rock samples were taken in 

RTA-1. 

RTA-2 (Metla Creek Glacier East) 

Along the east perimeter of the Metla Creek glacier on the tenure #510282 claim 

(approximate UTM: 642,100E / 6,471,700N). 

Reconnaissance work by Chevron on the east side of the Metla Creek glacier 

identified some isolated areas anomalous in gold. Solomon field crews collected six 

samples, including three mineralized grab samples of sheared magnetite enriched 

diorite/granodiorite of the Coast Plutonic Complex that ran 4.4 grams per tonne gold

Lithos Geological Inc. 

over 0.3 metres (M04S-C05), 784 grams per tonne (M04A-R142) and a float sample that 

ran 1.9% copper and 33.5 grams per tonne silver (M04SS-F04). 

RTA-3 (Metla East Gossan Area) 

To the east in the area of Late Cretaceous - Paleocene high level quartz phyric 

felsic intrusive and associated colour anomaly on the tenures #510284 and #510285 

(approximate UTM: 644,850E / 6,473,250N).  

Interest in the RTA-3 was based on a large colour anomaly located on the east 

part of the Metla Property straddling the boundary between tenures 510284 and 510285. 

The gossan is the result of intense oxidation of the Stuhini Group volcaniclastics(?) in 

immediate proximity to two Late Cretaceous-Paleocene high level, quartz phyric felsic 

intrusive plugs of the Windy Table Suite(?). The plugs are likely two exposures of one 

large intrusive body overlain by a thin veneer of altered Stuhini rocks. The area is 

intensely silicified, with abundant quartz vein stockworks of vuggy quartz. Trace to 1% 

pyrite is common. The highest assay obtained from the 18 rock samples collected is 84 

ppb gold, although one sample ran 1,427 ppm arsenic (M04T-R37) and antimony is 

elevated in most rock samples to a high of 180 ppm. A total of 117 contour soil samples 

were collected on 5 lines located across the RTA-1 gossan. The results are generally 

low, but are widely anomalous in arsenic (to 3,751 ppm), molybdenum (to a high of 118 

ppm) and more locally in zinc and copper. Some sample clusters define low level, 

weakly coincident gold-arsenic-antimony anomalies (to a high of 50 ppb gold). 

RTA-4 (Rod Prospect) 

Along the southeast perimeter of the tenure #510284 in the area of the Rod 

prospect (approximate UTM: 645,200E / 6,471,500N). 

The Rod prospect was first explored by Chevron in 1983 It occurs where Stuhini 

Group volcanics are in contact across a prominent regional northeast shear with Late 

Cretaceous-Paleocene coeval volcanics and intrusive. In 2004, Solomon crews 

concentrated their efforts roughly 500 metres west along the east boundary of tenure 

510284 where the northeast trending fault occurs up slope from strong arsenic-

antimony-gold anomalies. Results from the 6 rock samples taken from pyritic silicified 

fault gouge and adjacent country rocks were not significantly auriferous, although a float 

sample of quartz vein stockwork assayed 7,819 ppm copper and 35.3 grams per tonne 

silver (R04D-F22).

Lithos Geological Inc. 

RTA-5 

To the northeast along the perimeter of the tenure #510285 (approximate UTM: 

645,000E / 6,476,000N). 

A total of 21 reconnaissance contour soil samples and 15 stream sediment 

samples were collected in the area at the northeast boundary of tenure 510285. The 

only result of significance was a silt sample from a stream draining RTA-3 which assay 

65 ppb gold (R04T-SS12). 

RTA-6 

To the north along the perimeter of the Metla #3 (approximate UTM: 639,300E / 

6,477,500N). 

Two streams draining the north facing slopes above Trapper Lake at the north 

boundary of Metla #3 are anomalous in copper and copper plus silver (BC RGS, 1982). 

An attempt was made to run two soil contour lines higher on the slope at 900 metres and 

1,100 metres above sea level through this area, but the terrain proved very difficult to 

traverse. A total of 26 soil and 4 silt samples were collected. No significant results were 

obtained. 

7.2.2. Structure 

According to Oliver and Hodgson (1989) and Oliver and Gabites (1993), the 

structural history of the area southeast of the project area towards Tatsamenie Lake, 

within the vicinity of the Golden Bear mine occurred over three main deformational 

epochs. The oldest deformation took place in the Middle Triassic and earlier, the Late 

Jurassic, and the Early Tertiary (Souther, 1971). The youngest deformation is 

characterized by north-trending axial surfaces and tight, upright to weakly east-

overturned limbs. The Tatsamenie antiform is later deformed across broad upright 

northeast-plunging antiform-synform pairs. The development of broader, northwest 

trending open folds is the result of continued east-west shortening during the Jurassic. 

The interaction of these two fold styles produces a well-defined Type II interference 

pattern (Ramsay, 1962). The onset of extensional deformation during the mid-Tertiary 

was expressed as normal faults that effect the youngest Tertiary rocks (Souther, 1971). 

The structural setting of the Metla Property is characterized by all phases of 

aforementioned deformation. Tight overturned folds can be observed within the 

sedimentary package. The gabbro sill closely mimics these folds, the irregular fold axes 

of which variably plunge in subparallel, but opposite WNW-ESE directions. Boudinage 

structures have also been observed in the argillites that exhibit cross-cutting strain

orientations, indicating multiple phases of deformation. Small drag folds are also 

common adjacent to faults (Tupper, 2005). The ductile style of deformation in rocks 

adjacent to Metla creek is in marked contrast to the brittle deformation which 

characterizes the younger intrusions. Numerous north-north-easterly steep dipping faults 

cross cut the property. Mawer (1989) suggested 200 m or more horizontal displacement 

along some of these faults, and that most if not all the faults appear to be later than the 

intrusive breccia; however, there is no clear indication of what structure if any has 

localized the intrusive breccia.  

7.2.3. Metamorphism 

The metamorphic history of the rocks underlying the Metla Property is not well 

known. Within the claim area the degree of metamorphism is generally low, likely of 

greenschist facies. Some hand samples have been documented to contain prehnite as 

vesicle in-fillings (Blackwell, 1991; based on Mawer, 1989). Widespread saussuritization 

may be related to regional or contact metamorphism, or the effects of low temperature 

deuteric alteration. Hydrothermal alteration is also noted within the intrusive breccia, 

some clasts are altered to sericite and fuchsite and calc-silicates were observed in the 

calcareous sediments (Souther, 1971; Mawer, 1989; Tupper, 2005). 

8. Deposit Types 

 Within the region, a series of Late Cretaceous volcanic and subvolcanic plutonic 

rock form a belt on the eastern margin of the Coast Plutonic Belt and intrudes the Stikine 

Terrane (e.g., Mihalynuk, 1999). This belt extends from at least the Golden Bear Mine 

(Oliver, 1996) in the southeast to the Surprise Lake Batholith in the northwest 

(Mihalynuk, 1999). The known or inferred Late Cretaceous volcanoplutonic complexes 

have associated hydrothermally altered rocks (Souther, 1971; Mihalynuk, 1999; 

Simmons et al., 2005) and associated styles of mineralization. Through detailed 

mapping, Simmons et al. (2005) found that magmatic-related hydrothermal alteration 

and sulfide-bearing rocks are common throughout the Metla and Thorn property areas, 

suggesting that six styles of mineralization are associated with the Late Cretaceous 

volcanoplutonic belt: 1) quartz + pyrite + enargite + tetrahedrite veins, 2) breccia-hosted 

silver + lead + zinc (gold + copper) bearing sulfides, 3) porphyry copper + molybdenum, 

4) quartz + arsenopyrite ± sphalerite ± galena veins and disseminations, 5) skarn and 

carbonate replacement and, 6) sedimentary rock-hosted or Carlin-like mineralization. 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

40 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

Porphyry deposits are scattered throughout the Intermontane arc complex, 

especially within the Stikine terrane and mineralization within the Metla area could be 

due to decompression melting during crustal extension (~80–50 Ma) (Logan and 

Mihalynuk, 2014). Zircon U/Pb geochronology at the Thorn Property on the Cirque 

monzonite gives a maximum age for porphyry copper + molybdenum mineralization of 

82.2±0.2 Ma (Simmons et al. 2005). Tupper (2005) submitted that compilation of the 

work done to date at the Metla property supports the interpretation as proposed by 

Simmons et al. (2005) that the hydrothermal breccia unit and associated auriferous base 

metals mineralization at the Metla Creek Area is a distal remnant of a deeply eroded 

volcanic centre. Several reasons support this hypothesis including the Cretaceous U/Pb 

zircon age of associated intrusive/volcanic sequences at the Thorn Property, 

mineralization occurrences throughout the belt with very comparable nature and 

resemblance in mineralogy and chemistry (high silica) of mapped Late Cretaceous (?) 

intrusive stocks on the Metla property. 

The hydrothermal carbonate breccia hosted showings of the Metla Creek Area 

are characteristic of the mineralization identified on the Metla property. The nature of 

mineralization strongly supports the idea that the property could host a significant 

volcanoplutonic associated, low or intermediate sulphidation epithermal deposit hosted 

in several diatreme bodies. Aspinall (2014) interpreted that the mineralization of the 

Metla Main Zone consists of six brecciated diatremes that make up Zones A through F 

and that a seventh diatreme could occur under the glacial debris between Zones A and 

D. Figure 8.1 is a schematic cross sectional interpretation of the mineralization within the 

Metla Creek Area.  

Another possibility is that the bedded massive sulphide mineralization observed 

within the argillite in both outcrop and in boulders is genetically associated to a 

volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit. This hypothetical VMS deposit would be 

related to the much older accreted volcanic arc of the Stikine assemblage. 

A mineral resource assessment of the Atlin-Taku land-use planning area was completed 

by the BCGS; their main objective was to provide current information regarding the 

metallic and industrial mineral resource potential within the area (MacIntyre and Kilby, 

2009). From their work a map was produced in which they were able to rank the 

potential of a given area based on several detailed criteria (Figure 8.2). Within the Atlin-

Taku mineral resource assessment, as per the BCGS, the Metla property falls within a 

highly ranked region.

9. Exploration 

During the summer of 2017, Stuhini Exploration Ltd. utilized Global Drilling Solutions to 

conduct a small exploration project on the Metla Property. Field personnel consisted of Lucia 

Theny of Lithos Geological Inc., Clive Aspinall, Ashlee Schmaltz, Dr. Reinhardt Ramdohr and 

Janet Miller. A total of 27 field man-days were spent on the claims.

In September of 2017, Andrew Wilkins of Lithos Geological Inc. conducted a property 

visit for the purposes of this report. He was assisted by Clive Aspinall, Dr. Reinhardt Ramdohr 

and Janet Miller.  

Prospecting and mapping traverses were conducted throughout the property. The main 

showings in the Metla Creek Area were also revisited. A total of 110 rock samples were 

collected in the first phase and a further 24 samples were collected in the second phase. 

Results confirmed the presence of multi-element gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic 

mineralization as noted in previous exploration programs. No chip or channel samples were 

collected so assay values do not represent any true widths of mineralization. 

All rock samples from the Metla tenures were submitted to Bureau Veritas Mineral 

Laboratories Ltd. in Vancouver, B. C. for 53 element analyses by Aqua Regia digestion and 

ultra-trace induced coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP/MS) methods. Over limits were 

analysed by 4 acid digest and induced coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP/ES) 

methods. Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories Ltd. is an ISO 9001-certified facility that is 

independent of the issuer. 

Rock sample locations and anomalous values for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and 

arsenic from all the programs since 2011 are shown in Figures 9.2 - 9.7 of this report. 

Certificates of Analysis are presented in Appendix 1 and sample descriptions are in Appendix 2. 

A total of 4.6 kilometres of ground magnetics was also conducted during this time using 

a GEM systems GSM 19GW – walking gradiometer. Figure 9.8 shows the results of the survey. 

The magnetic highs match mapped diorite and more complete coverage would help in the 

mapping and targeting of the Metla Creek Zones. 

In the spring of 2018, Geotech Ltd. was contracted to fly a Helicopter-borne Versatile 

Time Domain Electromagnetic (VTEM
TM

) and Aeromagnetic Survey. The survey consisted of 

419 line kilometres covering an area of 76 km
2
. Geotech geophysicists recognize one 

anomalous zone observed in the EM profiles. The zone is approximately 1500 metres wide by 

5000 metres long and is oriented in a NW-SE direction. A formal interpretation of the data has 

not been done at this point and Prikhodko recommends in the Geotech report that Maxwell 

Plate modeling should be undertaken prior to any drilling of geophysical anomalies (Prikhodko, 

2018). 

Figures 9.9 and 9.10 are maps of the Total Magnetic Intensity and the Versatile Time 

Domain Electromagnetic B-Field Component of the VTEM Airborne Geophysical Survey in the 

MCA area.

In August of 2018, a camp was constructed on the property (Figure 9.1). During this 

time, Clive Aspinall and Blake Tinkess did some 1:2,000 scale geological mapping of the Metla 

Creek Zone and collected a total of 36 rock samples. The rock samples from 2018 have not 

been sent in for assay at this time.

10. Drilling 

A 1,075 m BTW (BQ thin wall) diamond drill program was conducted on the Metla 

property in 1991 by Galico Resources (Figure 10.1). The drill holes targeted geophysical 

electromagnetic targets generated in 1991 (Dvorak, 1991). Results from the drill program were 

never reported. In 2004 Solomon crews re-logged the core that was stored at Trapper Lake. 

Through re-logging the core, it was established that the entirety was split for assays. Several, if 

not all potentially mineralized lithologies were tested and based on visual estimates of the 

Solomon crew, no significant mineralization was intersected. The locations of the drill holes 

were located in most cases, although only hole M91-01 was identified based on a collar ID tag. 

Five samples from three holes were taken for analyses in 2004; sample from M91-08 had the 

only anomaly in any elements. The sample consisted of a hydrothermal breccia with argillite 

clasts and 2.5% coarse blebby pyrite, sample M04D-R20 assayed 106 ppb gold, 5.6 g/t silver 

and 585 ppm copper (Tupper, 2005). In 2013 the drill core was re-boxed and moved to Atlin for 

safe storage. The locations of the holes are shown in Table 3.

11. Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

During the 2017 exploration program, all geological and geochemical field 

stations and sample locations were recorded using a hand-held Garmin GPS. Rock and 

chip samples were collected from outcrop or float, which were placed in individual plastic 

bags and sealed with zap straps. Sample tags were placed in the bags before sealing. 

Samples were flown back to Atlin at the end of the day and were placed in rice bags. 

Samples were then delivered by truck to the Bureau Veritas prep lab in Whitehorse. 

Once prepped, the samples were sent to Vancouver for analysis. The author of this 

report is satisfied that the Metla Property geochemical samples were obtained, 

transported and analysed appropriately, with sufficient attention to security, handling and 

reporting for the purposes intended. 

12. Data Verification 

The data that forms the basis of the technical information contained in this report 

were obtained from government publications, assessment reports, field observations by 

qualified persons, and from independent ISO 9001 certified analytical laboratories. The 

authors have resampled several of the historic showings and results have confirmed the 

presence of gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic mineralization; however the 

authors cannot confirm the trenching results from the 2008 program where assay values 

are reported over measured widths. The Metla Property is still an early stage exploration 

play and no further data verification is necessary at this point. Drilling is warranted and 

recommended; QA/QC protocols, including blanks, standards and duplicates would be 

appropriate in future drill programs and more focused technical surveys. 

13. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

No metallurgical work has been carried out to date on material from the Metla 

property. 

14. Mineral Resource Estimates 

No mineral resource estimates have been made to date on material from the 

Metla property.

15. Adjacent Properties 

There are many mineral occurrences throughout the area surrounding the Metla 

Property. The information in this section describes several of the adjacent properties. In 

general, the styles of mineralization of these occurrences can be loosely constrained by 

two metallogenic environments, the younger being Cretaceous Continental Arc 

Magmatic deposits and the older being Mesozoic and Paleozoic Island Arc related 

deposits.  

Mineralization interpreted to be related to the Cretaceous Volcanoplutonic 

Magmatic suite occurs at the past producing Golden Bear Mine, and prospects including 

the Thorn, Cirque, Trapper, Bing and Red Cap properties. The past producing New 

Polaris mine and deposit may also be part of this magmatic suite. 

The Golden Bear mine is reported to have produced 2,171,150 tonnes of ore with 

15,044,867 grams of gold with 1,716,107 grams of silver from 1989 to 2002 Under North 

American Metals Ltd. and Wheaton River Resources Ltd (Minfile Report, 104K 079; 

Tupper, 2005). 

The New Polaris mine was in discontinuous operation from 1937 to 1951 

reportedly producing 689,090 tonnes of ore and 7,203,579 grams of gold (Canarc 

Resources Corp, 2012). The New Polaris currently operated by Canarc Resources Corp. 

has an estimated resource of 1,288,000 tonnes of ore at 12.54 ppm gold (Canarc 

Resources Corp., 2012). 

The Thorn Property is currently operated by Brixton Metals and owned by Kiska 

Metals Corporation. Diamond drilling in the Oban breccia zone has intersected 95.08 m 

of 0.12% copper, 3.31% lead, 2.39% zinc, 1.71 ppm gold and 628 ppm silver (Brixton 

Metals Corporation, 2012). The Chivas zone represents an important new mineralized 

target and is part of a district scale system at the Thorn project. Mineralization is hosted 

by quartz-carbonate-pyrite, galena-sphalerite-sulphosalts veins, polyphase and/or 

hydrothermal breccia and fault zones within Stuhini Group volcanic rocks and is 

interpreted as being peripheral to a gold – silver – copper – molybdenum porphyry 

system. The Chivas Zone is located about 3 kilometres southwest from the western 

edge of the sediment hosted Outlaw Gold Zone where hole 128 intersected 59.65m of 

1.15 grams per tonne gold, 5.64 grams per tonne silver, and about 3 kilometres south 

from the Oban Diatreme Breccia Zone where hole 60 intersected 95m of 628 grams per 



Technical Report on the Metla Property

Lithos Geological Inc. 

tonne silver and 1.71 grams per tonne gold, 3.31% lead, 2.39% zinc, 0.12% copper 

(Brixton Metals Corporation, 2017). 

The Trapper property operated by Ocean Park Ventures and owned by 

Constantine Metal Resources has reported diamond drilling including 147.52 m of 566 

ppm lead, 1285 ppm zinc, 0.42 ppm gold and 1.99 ppm silver (Ocean Park Ventures 

Corporation, 2012). 

Mineralization within the region and related to the Stikine island arc terrane has 

been identified at the past producing and Tulsequah Chief and Big Bull mines. Both 

these deposits are considered to fit volcanogenic massive sulphide models. 

Tulsequah Chief and Big Bull mine were in production from 1951 to 1957 under 

Cominco with production totals reported as 935,536 tonnes of ore with 2,931,644 grams 

of gold, 105,744,215 grams of silver, 56,544 tonnes of zinc, 12,341 tonnes of copper and 

12,214 tonnes of lead (Arseneau, 2010A, Arseneau 2010B). The Tulsequah Chief 

deposit in the region has an indicated resource estimate of 6,034,000 tonnes or ore 

grading 1.42% copper, 1.23% lead, 6.44% zinc, 2.63 ppm gold and 96 ppm silver 

(Arseneau, 2010A). The Big Bull deposit has an indicated and inferred resource of 

728,000 tonnes of ore grading 0.34% copper, 2.42% lead, 5.61% zinc, 3.9 ppm gold and 

185 ppm silver (Arseneau,2010 B).

16. Interpretation and Conclusions 

Although 9 drill holes and some extensive mapping and sampling has occurred in 

the vicinity of the Metla Creek Area, the source of the numerous mineralized boulders 

scattered throughout the area has not been determined or adequately tested. To date, 

only two holes have been drilled up ice from the end of the identified boulder train. 

Dvorak (1991) concludes that the EM anomalies and conductors in the Metla 

Creek Area constitute the most attractive conductor targets of the entire survey. They 

are associated with the best low resistivity zone, with an attractive VLF-EM anomaly, 

and a suite of interesting magnetic gradient anomalies. They are a high priority target. 

Alteration minerals noted in petrographic studies (Aspinall, 2007) from the Metla 

Creek showings consists of mostly calcite, quartz, chlorite, some sericite, hematite, 

epidote and actinolite. Distal to the Metla Creek showings are mostly iron carbonate 

brecciated veins in well-defined brittle fault structures. The alteration mineral 

assemblage suggests low to moderate temperatures in line with a low to intermediate 

sulphidation system in the epithermal regime or a volcanogenic massive sulphide 

system with an associated feeder system. 

Some key geological and geophysical observations are as follows 

 A spatial association between the breccia bodies and the cross-cutting faults 

in the Metla Creek Area implying that structures play an important role as 

conduits for the mineralizing fluids.  

 Sulphide mineralization is commonly associated with argillite either as 

stratiform beds within the argillite, within the carbonate breccia with abundant 

argillaceous clasts, or within the carbonate breccia along the contact with the 

argillite, suggesting that the chemistry of the argillites may influence the 

precipitation of the sulphides. 

 In the Metla Creek Area, the prominent linear northwest trending VTEM
TM 

conductor is broken up and possibly displaced in a few locations.  

 In the Metla Creek Area, there are magnetic lows overlapping and 

immediately south of the breaks in the VTEM
TM 

anomaly. 

With these observations in mind, I suggest that the VTEM
TM

 and Aerodat EM and 

VLF-EM anomalies in the Metla Creek Area could be due to the pyritic and 

carbonaceous argillites and that the magnetic lows could be the result of 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

61 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

magnetite destruction from quartz carbonate and quartz sericite alteration and 

brecciation. I suggest that the most prospective targets might be the contact 

between the conductive anomalies and the magnetic lows, or in other words, 

where the carbonate breccia is in contact with the argillite. 

The Metla Property is considered a "greenfield" exploration target. The 

project carries a high risk of failure or inconclusive results, but the potential 

rewards are also significant if a major discovery is made. The operator of the 

recommended field program, when that work is completed, may have to choose 

between abandoning the project or continued drilling, at modest cost to continue 

testing any apparent anomalies and mineralization that may be discovered in the 

first phases of exploration.  

17. Recommendations 

The Metla property lies in the middle of an identified continental arc metallogenic 

belt that hosts significant mineralization and includes the past producing Golden Bear 

Mine as well as the Thorn and Trapper prospects. Different styles of mineralization have 

been identified in this belt including both high and intermediate multi-element epithermal 

sulphidation deposits, porphyry copper-molybdenum and replacement skarn.  The 

property is also underlain by the Stikine Assemblage and Stuhuni Group, which is part of 

an accreted volcanic arc that is host to numerous deposit types throughout northwestern 

B.C., including volcanogenic massive sulphide, porphyry copper-gold and epithermal 

deposits.  

To date, the source of the significant mineralized boulder train has not been 

adequately tested. Immediately up ice of the boulder train is predominately ablation till 

with limited outcrop.  

The following first phase of exploration is recommended for the Metla Property in 

2019: 

1. Interpretation and Maxwell Plate modeling of the acquired 2018 Airborne 

Variable Time Domain Electromagnetic (VTEM
TM

) data. 

2. 1:10,000 mapping of the property with a focus on alteration and structure. 

3. More detailed 1:500 and 1:2,000 scale mapping of selected target areas and 

airborne geophysical anomalies. 



Technical Report on the Metla Property 
Atlin Mining Division, Northwestern British Columbia 

62 | P a g e  
Lithos Geological Inc. 

Once phase 1 is completed a follow-up phase 2 program would be recommended based 

on results and available funding. The program would be as follows; 

1. Drilling of identified geological and geophysical targets including Area D. 

2. Continued property wide prospecting. 

The proposed budget for Phase 1 and Phase 2 is shown in Table 4. Current 

logistics involve the following: 

1. Completing the establishment of the camp in the meadow above Melta 

Creek. 

2. Mobilizing equipment by plane to the airstrip located on the Sutlahine River 

30 kilometres to the northwest and then helicopter to the Metla Creek Camp. 

3. To reduce costs, groceries and personnel can possibly be mobilized by float 

plane to Trapper Lake and then helicopter to camp.
