SECTION 3 SUMMARY 

3.1 Executive Summary 

IMC Group Consulting Limited (IMC or IMCGCL) together with GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants 

Limited (GBM1), the employers of the qualified persons, were retained by Resource Hunter Capital Corp 

(Resource Hunter) to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Farim Phosphate Project (the Project) 

located in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa.   

The purpose of this report is to provide a preliminary assessment of the economic potential of the Project as well 

as to provide the Technical Report for the Filing Statement for the proposed listing of Resource Hunter on the 

TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV).  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects.  Resource Hunter has entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to acquire 100% of the 

shareholding of GB Minerals AG ("GB Minerals") of Switzerland which in turn owns 100% of the mineral 

rights to the areas considered in this preliminary assessment.  GB Minerals also holds a production license, 

which grants the exclusive right to exploit mine and commercialise the high-grade phosphate deposit of Farim 

and Exploration Licenses to explore the area surrounding the Project. 

The Project is located in the northern part of central Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, approximately 25 km south of 

the Senegal border, approximately 5 km west of the town of Farim and some 120 km North of Bissau, the 

capital of Guinea-Bissau.  The Project consists of a high grade sedimentary phosphate deposit of one continuous 

phosphate bed, which extends over a known surface area of approximately 40 km2.   

Measured and Indicated Resources of phosphate ore amount to 84 million tonnes at a grade of 29.9% P2O5 with 

a cut-off thickness of 1.5 m and a stripping ratio cut-off of less than 20 to 1 and an average thickness of 3.3 m.  

Also Inferred Resources amount to 44 million tonnes at a grade of 29.6% P2O5 with a cut-off thickness of 1.5 m 

(average thickness of 2.63 m) and a stripping ratio of less than 20 to 1. 

A total of 68 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated Resources at a grade of 29.9% P2O5 with a cut-off of 

1.5 m and average thickness of 3.3 m has been defined on the northern side of the Cacheu River as being 

suitable for a mining area.  The Cacheu River bisects the deposit. 

The Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Farim Phosphate Project encompasses the general process flow: 

• Annual ore production rate of 2,760,000 tonnes or 7,885 tonnes per day. 

• Removal of overburden by a combination of shallow open pit mining and overburden dredging 

followed by dredging and pumping phosphate ore slurry to the beneficiation plant. 

• Phosphate ore slurry will be delivered to buffer storage ponds prior to reclaim into the feed 

preparation section of the beneficiation plant.  Oversized material (+1 mm) will be washed in 

scrubbers and removed by screening and fines (-50 µm) will be removed by classification in 

                                                      
1 GBM and GB Minerals are not related parties; the apparent closeness of the name is a coincidence

hydrocyclones.  Hydraulic classifiers will produce two streams (-1,000+200 µm and -200 +50 µm) 

to be subjected to wet high gradient intensity magnetic separation (WHGMS). 

• After removal of ultrafines (-10 µm), the fine stream (10 – 50 µm) will be subjected to wet high 

gradient magnetic separation (WHGMS).  The three streams of magnetic products will be thickened 

and deposited in a tailings facility, as will the -10 mm by 10 µ slimes, both potentially being co-

deposited with the +1 mm rejects.  This tailings disposal facility will be located within 3 km of the 

process site.  The three non-magnetic streams will be the final phosphate rock concentrate product 

containing 32.5% P2O5 and 3.5% FeAl. 

• The concentrate will be pumped to the port at Chugue, 80 km from the treatment plant.  In order to 

control the particle size distribution and slurry density at the optimal values for pumping the 

concentrate will be milled and thickened prior to pumping through an overland pipeline. 

• Recovery by the beneficiation process is 72.5% by weight and 79.6% of P2O5 content. 

• On discharge at the port, the concentrate slurry will be filtered and dried to approximately 8% 

moisture.  The dried product will be stockpiled prior to loading onto ships. 

• Up to 40,000 tonnes of phosphate rock concentrate will be stored in a warehouse next to the port to 

then be loaded into a ship by conveyor belt.  The maximum loading capacity by conveyor is 2,000 

tonnes per hour and a ship of around 35,000 tonnes can be loaded in 24 hours. 

• The economic analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Measured and Indicated 

Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, 

production and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is based will be realized.

25 year mine life.  Operating cash flow averages US$ 69.61 million per year and simple payback of pre-

production capital is achieved after approximately 4 years of operation.

is based, in part, on Measured and Indicated Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  There is no certainty that 

the reserves development, production and economic forecasts on which this preliminary assessment is based will 

be realized. 

3.1.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks were examined 

by running cash flow sensitivities for: 

• Phosphate rock price 

• Operating cost 

• Capital costs 

• Metallurgical recovery 

Pre-tax NPV sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for -20% to +20% variations.  The sensitivities 

are shown in Figure 3-1 and Table 3-5.  The Project is most sensitive to phosphate rock prices and recovery.  

Phosphate rock price variations examined above within the range of recent price history.  Recovery is a function 

of plant feed and plant efficiency.  Optimisation of the mining plan and improving plant efficiencies will 

improve the recoveries and in turn the project economics.

3.1.4 Interpretation 

The Farim Project currently comprises a large tonnage (84 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated Resources) 

high grade (29.9% P2O5) phosphate deposit consisting of one continuous flat lying phosphate bed that is 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 6 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

proposed to be exploited by a combination of shallow open pit mining operations and high productivity 

dredging followed by simple beneficiation methods.   

The resource estimate is sensitive to the stripping ratio.  The stripping ratio has been optimised to a limited 

extent but additional analysis is required to define the optimum stripping ratio for the Project.  In total, a 

Measured and Indicated resource estimate in an area north of the River Cacheu of 68 million tonnes have been 

defined for a life of mine plan at a rate of 2.76 million tonnes per year for a period of 25 years.  Using assumed 

long term phosphate rock prices of US$ 100 per tonne, the Project base case has an undiscounted pre-tax cash 

flow of US$ 69.61 million per year.  The pre-tax NPV of the Project at a 10% discount rate is US$ 254 million, 

and simple payback occurs after approximately 4 years of operation. 

The Project is most sensitive to phosphate rock prices, operating costs and recovery.  Phosphate rock price 

projections lie within the range of recent phosphate rock price history.  Recovery is a function of plant feed and 

plant efficiency.  Optimisation of the mining plan and improving plant efficiencies will improve the recoveries 

and in turn the Project economics. 

The current model uses a life of mine plan grade.  No attempt has been made to optimise grade in the early years 

of the Project however by doing so the economics of the project may be enhanced by optimising grade during 

the early years of the operations. 

The current financial model assumes the mining of 68 million tonnes or 80% of the current Indicated and 

Measured Resources of 84 million tonnes.  There may be potential to improve the Project economics by 

increasing production rate and life of mine. 

Assumptions have been made regarding location of the beneficiation plant and the tailings area, because the 

final sites have not yet been selected.  In the further stages of study of the Project, there is considerable scope for 

refining and optimisation of the capital and working costs. 

The Project has been granted a Mining Lease License and a Production License by the Guinea-Bissau 

Government.  This is valuable to optimising the timetable for development and production. 

3.1.5 Conclusions and Recommendations  

Results of the preliminary assessment shows that the Farim Project is robust at the selected long term phosphate 

rock prices and it is recommend that the Project continues to be advanced to the feasibility stage. 

A summary program and budget for a proposed feasibility study of US$ 3.96 million is presented in Table 3-6.  

Specific recommendations in each area follow: 

3.1.5.1 Resources 

Drilling on the Farim Phosphate Project should concentrate on step out exploration, in-fill drilling and large 

diameter core drilling necessary for collecting bulk metallurgical samples and to optimise the mining plan 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 7 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The drill program should be designed to upgrade the currently defined resource estimates, define areas of higher 

grade which can be used to further optimise grade in the early years of production and increase the resource base 

through step out drilling. 

An accurate topographical study should be conducted over the mining license area. 

3.1.5.2 Mining 

The feasibility and mine planning for a dredge mining operation combined with shallow open pit overburden 

mining should be undertaken to define the optimum mining method, stripping ratios and recovered grades.  

Selective mining of interbedded waste should be examined. 

Geotechnical studies are needed to establish manageable slope angles in the unconsolidated overburden and 

define appropriate ground control requirements 

3.1.5.3 Metallurgy 

Additional metallurgical work is required to optimise, refine and validate the data and proposed flowsheet used 

in the Preliminary Assessment.  Samples of the products from the various stages of the flow sheet should be 

collected and dispatched to potential customers for the phosphate rock products. 

3.1.5.4 Environment 

Options for tailings disposal should be examined in greater detail.  The water balance arising from the proposed 

dredge mining operations should be incorporated in the overall environmental plans for the Project.  A final 

environmental impact study needs to be prepared to incorporate the operating parameters defined in the 

feasibility study. 

3.1.5.5 Proposed Work Program and Budget 

The Qualified Person has reviewed and concurs with the work program and budget proposed by Resource 

Hunter.

3.2 Technical Summary 

3.2.1 Project Location 

The Farim Phosphate Project is located near the town of Farim in north-central Guinea-Bissau (see Table 3-7).  

The Project is located on a 30.6 km2 Mining Lease License with a Production License granted by the Guinea-

Bissau Government and is surrounded by an Exploration License owned by GB Minerals.

3.2.2 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Farim Phosphate Project is accessible by 120 km of paved highway north from the capital city of Bissau.  A 

ferry across the Cacheu River, which is about 300 m to 500 m wide, provides access to the town of Farim on the 

north bank.  The majority of the phosphate resources occurs to the north of the Cacheu River and is accessed by 

an approximately 5 km long unimproved gravel road westwards from the town of Farim.  The river is tidal and 

Farim, which is about 150 km from the open Atlantic Ocean, is accessible by barge. 

The region is open semi-arid savannah woodland.  The climate is tropical with a mean annual temperature of 25 

°C.  The rainy season occurs from June to October and is most intense in August and September.  Average 

annual rainfall is 1,950 mm in Bissau and about 1,100 mm in Farim. 

The local infrastructure is limited.  The town of Farim has limited infrastructure that is suitable to a mining 

operation of the scale proposed for the Project.  The Project will have to construct housing, medical and 

associated infrastructure to accommodate the impact that the Project will have on the town of Farim.  Local 

labour is agricultural focused and interstate and expatriate labour will be required to service the proposed 

Project operations.  There is no local power supply and a 15-20 MW diesel or oil fired power station is 

proposed. 

The topography of the Project area is flat with the maximum elevation change being about 20 m over a distance 

of 4 km, from the Cacheu River in a northwest direction.  The Project area drains into the Cacheu River. The 

elevation of the project varies between 5 and 50 metres above sea level. 

3.2.3 History 

Phosphate was first discovered in one geotechnical drill hole as part of a water survey in 1950 and noted again 

in one oil drill hole by Esso in 1965. 

The French Bureau of Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) conducted an extensive exploration and 

delineation drilling program from 1981 to 1983, during which time they drilled 5,672 m of large diameter core 

in 101 holes.  This enabled them to carry out a detailed geological study of the deposit and provided a 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 9 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

comprehensive database for the French agency Sofremines to conduct a prefeasibility study in 1986.  The 

prefeasibility study was positive but market conditions and political considerations precluded development at 

that time and the French agencies withdrew from the Project. 

In 1997, Champion Resources of Canada, acquired ownership of the Farim phosphate deposit and carried out 

diamond drilling campaigns in 1998 and 1999 totalling 1810 m in 34 holes.  The main purposes of the 

Champion drilling were to confirm the BRGM results for due diligence purposes, to provide fresh phosphate 

samples for metallurgical testwork and to expand the phosphate resource to the west.  The programs were 

successful in that all three goals were achieved.  Champion Resources Inc carried out a prefeasibility study 

which again demonstrated that a phosphate mining and beneficiation project was economically viable.  

However, no further progress was made due to both internal political and external market conditions and 

phosphate rock prices. 

In 2004, a Swiss company, GB Phosphate acquired an exploration license over the Farim Phosphate deposit.  

GB Phosphate evaluated the potential of the Farim phosphate deposit, undertook several comprehensive studies 

including excavating a box cut, drilled 30 drill holes totalling 1,564 m to confirm and validate the work of 

previous explorers and a hydrological study.  They also undertook an environmental impact study and an 

economic evaluation of the Project.  In 2009 GB Minerals AG, signed a comprehensive production agreement 

with the Government of Guinea-Bissau.  This production agreement includes a production licence and numerous 

incentives and concessions for the development and commercialisation of the Farim Phosphate Project.  In total, 

an amount of approximately 20 million Euros has been spent on the Project. 

3.2.4 Geological Setting 

The Farim phosphate deposit occurs within the Middle Eocene Lutetien Formation in a Cenozoic sedimentary 

basin that extends from Morocco in the north through Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and into Guinea to 

the south.  The basin hosts a number of important phosphate deposits and accounts for almost 25% of world 

production. 

Three phosphate-bearing horizons have been identified at the Farim phosphate deposit.  These units are referred 

to as FPO, FPB and FPA.  The FPO is a clayey dolomitic limestone that is weakly phosphatic with limited 

economic potential.  The FPB is a calcareous phosphate unit that is 1 to 15 m thick, averages about 13% P2O5, 

and partially underlies the FPA, where its thickness is 5.3 m in average.  It may be exploited economically in the 

future if beneficiation test to be done show acceptable cost compare to price.  The FPA unit is the potentially 

economic phosphate bed. 

The FPA is localized within a sub-basin known as Saliquinhé Bay.  The sub-basin is bounded to the east and 

south by carbonate platform rocks against which the FPA wedges out.  The north western limit of the FPA has 

not yet been defined.  To the north, the Tambato submarine cape, which formed a barrier between the Saliquinhé 

Bay and the deeper Casamance Basin, will likely form the northern limited of the FPA unit but this was not 

demonstrated by drilling. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 10 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The FPA is a soft, poorly cemented unit of phosphatic sand, which includes phosphatised shell and bone 

material, teeth, faecal pellets and crustacean coprolites.  It is mildly indurated (with no limey cement) and 

includes indurated siliceous layers 5 to 20 cm thick which comprise an average of 6% of the unit.  The indurated 

and much harder phosphatic limestone referred to as FPB underlies the FPA.  A mixture of saprolitic fine sand 

and clays, which are generally unconsolidated, overlies the FPA.  The immediate hanging wall to the FPA is 20 

to 60 cm thick unconsolidated sand. 

The hanging wall rocks are oxidized reddish brown to an elevation of about 25/30 m below sea level.  The FPA 

is grey to beige and brown and lies in a generally reducing environment below the oxidized interval.  This is 

important because iron oxide, which is soluble in sulphuric acid, is a contaminant in phosphate deposits whereas 

iron sulphide, which is insoluble in sulphuric acid, is not. 

The FPA unit has an average thickness of 3.30 m (in the resource area) and underlies an area of about 40 km2. 

3.2.5 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Estimates 

The Farim drillhole database contains 165 diamond drill holes that total 9,046 m.  Several historic holes have 

been completed in the vicinity of Farim. 

The earliest program was carried out by DGM of Guinea Bissau in 1977.  This drill program consisted of four 

holes and totalled 707 m.  BRGM resumed drill testing the property, a strategic programme in 1981 of 32 holes 

over an area of 40*25 km2 and, in 1983, with an aggressive program of 69 holes that established a 500 m spaced 

grid-pattern of holes.  These programs were carried out in 1981 and 1983 and totalled 101 holes for 5,672 m. 

BRGM established a Historic Resource of 113 million tonnes grading 29.8% P2O5. This Historic Resource 

Estimate by BRGM has not been reviewed by the Qualified Person, should not be considered to represent a 

current resource and should not be relied upon.  

Metallurgical testwork demonstrated that a phosphate concentrate grading 36.5% P2O5 could be produced.  

Based on these estimated resources and metallurgical testwork, the French agency Sofremines carried out a 

prefeasibility study which indicated that the project was economically viable. 

Champion Resources Inc completed a 13 hole, 560 m diamond drill program in 1998 and then undertook a 

further drill program consisting of an additional 21 holes totalling 1,250 m.  Champion Resources Inc focused 

much of their efforts on testing the north and northwest extensions of the phosphatic units located by the BRGM 

programs.  The average depth of the Champion Resources drill holes was about 57 m.  In March 2000 

Champion Resources using the previous BRGM drill holes and the 34 drills completed by Champion completed 

a Historic Resource estimate that contained an estimated 166.2 million tonnes grading 29.1% P2O5 in the 

Measured and Indicated categories.  The classical polygonal plan view method for resource estimation was used 

by Champion Resources Inc. Again, this Historic Resource estimate by Champion has not been reviewed by the 

Qualified Person, should not be considered to represent a current resource and should not be relied upon. 

GB Minerals drilled 30 holes between 2008 and 2009, totalling 1564 m of which 423 m was core drilling in the 

phosphate zone.  Gamma ray logging was carried out on 30 holes.  This work was managed and supervised by 

GEEEM, an independent geological consulting company that was contracted by GB Minerals to manage and 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 11 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

supervise exploration activities and conduct exploration work programs including the drilling at the Project. The 

principals of GEEEM have extensive geological experience in phosphate deposits, phosphate exploration and 

mining. 

The Qualified Person reviewed the data collected in 2008-2009 by GEEEM, and also the data from BRGM and 

from Champion for the Farim Phosphate Deposit and independently estimated the mineral resources in 

accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and the definitions set out by the CIM Definition Standards for 

Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on 11 December 2005 (CIM definitions).  

This current resource estimate is based on diamond core drilling and core sampling data. 

The resource estimate shows Measured and Indicated phosphate ore resources of 84 million tonnes at 29.9% 

P2O5 with a cut-off thickness of 1.5 metres and a stripping ratio of less than 20 to 1.  The corresponding resource 

area is about 18 km2.  The average thickness of the mineralization is 3.3 m.  The core drilling grid was generally 

500 m and in some places 1,000 m. 

An Inferred Resource of phosphate ore amounting to 44 million tonnes at a grade of 29.6% P2O5 with a cut-off 

thickness of 1.5 m (average thickness of 2.63 m) and a stripping ratio of less than 20 to 1. 

For the proposed mining area of the Farim Phosphate Deposit, that occurs on the northern side of the River 

Cacheu, using a cut-off thickness of 1.5 m, a resource was defined in the Measured and Indicated category of 68 

million tonnes at 29.9% P2O5 (stripping ratio 9.4:1, average thickness of 4 m).

Notes: 

• CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resource estimation and classification, as recommended by 43-
101CP 

• Retained average bulk density is 1.40 t/m3 

• No prefeasibility or feasibility study has been carried out as part of the resource estimate for the Farim 
Phosphate deposit; consequently no ore reserves were estimated. 

3.2.6 Mining Operations 

Production quantities for the Preliminary Economic Assessment are based on the resource block model used in 

the current resource estimate. Only the part of the resource area located North of the Rio Cacheu was considered 

and dilution and extraction factors were applied to the Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources to develop a 

resource based that may potentially be mined. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 12 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The geometry of the phosphate deposit can be described as a flat lying tabular block ranging in thickness from 

1.5 m to over 6 m with an average thickness of 4 m.  The phosphate deposit corresponding to the areas where 

resources may potentially be mined covers an area of 12 km2, and lies from 28 m to 53 m below surface 

averaging approximately 38 m. 

3.2.6.1 Mining Method  

Based on the deposit geometry, unconsolidated overburden and a average moisture content of 30% it was 

concluded that this deposit should be mined using a combination of conventional shallow open pit methods for 

the first 2 to 10 m depth above the water table followed by the use of an overburden stripping dredge and a 

phosphate mining production dredge.  This proposed mining method would also allow for progressive 

rehabilitation to occur as mining proceeds. 

The conventional shallow open pit mining will simply involve the removal of the topsoil and upper dry 

unconsolidated clayey sand layers from the areas being mined, with this then placed in stockpiles adjacent to the 

mining areas.  Backfilling using this material will occur later when the mine area is mined out and the phosphate 

ore is extracted.  An alternative way is to leave a lake if no backfilling of the pit at the end of the project is 

required. 

The dredge mining process will involve the removal of the wetter unconsolidated sandy clayey material using an 

overburden dredge followed by the removal of the phosphate ore using a production dredge.  This will be 

carried out in progressive strips.  After the initial strip or cut has been mined, the unconsolidated sandy clayey 

material for subsequent strips will be placed in the void created from the first strip.  This technique will enable 

areas to be progressively rehabilitated once mining has advanced to the next strip.  Contouring of the replaced 

unconsolidated sandy clayey material will occur ahead of topsoil placement and revegetation. 

Typically, the strip mining process will commence with the removal of topsoil and dry material above the water 

table for all areas to be disturbed for the mining strip.  A slot will be opened from the initial box cut that is 

excavated in each mining strip and then the overburden dredge will be "floated" in the enlarged slot, water from 

the River Cacheu will be pumped into the enlarged slot and then the slot will then be extended the full width of 

the stripped.  Overburden dredging operations will then progress the entire length of the mining strip in a series 

of 7 m benches until the phosphate is reached about at about 33 m below the water table. 

Once the top of the phosphate layer has been exposed by the overburden dredge, the production dredge will be 

floated in a lot that has been excavated in the phosphate layer.  Phosphate ore will then be excavated and 

pumped to the treatment plant 

3.2.6.2 Geotechnical 

The phosphate ore has only been observed in diamond drill core and the unconsolidated overburden and topsoil 

has been examined in a box cut and shaft excavated by GB Minerals.  It is anticipated that ground conditions 

will be manageable in both the phosphate ore layer and the overlying unconsolidated clayey sand layers, 

allowing the assumption that mining could be carried out using conventional shallow open pit and dredge 

mining methods.  Drill core indicates that the phosphate ore is soft and amenable to dredge mining.  Similarly

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

the observation of the unconsolidated overburden indicates that this material would generally be amenable to 

dredging. 

The application of dredge mining and the design of the dredge mining layout, mining lifts, water balance, 

production rates etc will have to be studied and developed further.  IMC recommends a detail mining plan 

including geotechnical investigations before the mining method is finalized. 

3.2.6.3 Dilution and Extraction 

For the extraction of the phosphate ore a dilution factor of 10% and a further ore loss factor of 10% has been 

used to account for: 

• Foot wall and hanging wall waste which will be mined by the production dredge because these are 

undulating surfaces and, 

• A number of inter layer bands of sand / clay and other calcareous material that could occur within 

the phosphate layer. 

It is anticipated that the dredge operators will achieve sufficient levels of operating skills that the dilution will be 

minimized with the help of drilling ahead of the dredge progress, of positioning devices and of radiometric 

control of the flow of dredged phosphates into the pipe. 

A thorough geotechnical review, including modelling of the proposed mine design, strip mining layout and 

mining sequence, will need to be completed before preparing feasibility – level development and production 

schedules. 

3.2.6.4 Life of Mine Plan 

The Life of Mine Plan schedule is based on a production rate of 2,760,000 tonnes per annum.  A 25-year mine 

life has been selected for evaluation.  The evaluation is based on mining Measured and Indicated Resources.  

Mine life could potentially be extended by successful infill drilling and exploration to the northwest and north 

east and higher stripping ratios. 

3.2.6.5 Mining Equipment 

The selection of mining equipment for the Farim Phosphate project is based on the philosophy of using the best 

available and proven technology adapted for the available operating skills and maintenance support that would 

be available on a sustainable basis in Guinea-Bissau.  An initial larger complement of expatriate personnel is 

planned for the early years of the operation. 

3.2.7 Mineral Processing 

The proposed beneficiation process has been derived from an understanding of the local geology, the mining 

method and the testwork performed to date.  The required product has been defined from typical phosphoric 

acid producer feed specifications and the response of the ore to beneficiation processes. 

Wet mining by dredges will generate slurry that is delivered to buffer storage ponds prior to reclaim and 

delivery into the Feed Preparation section of the plant.  Oversized material (+1 mm) will be washed in scrubbers

and removed by screening and fines (-50µm) will be removed by classification in hydrocyclones.  Hydraulic 

classifiers will produce two streams (-1,000 +200µm and -200 +50µm) to be subjected to wet high gradient 

magnetic separation (WHGMS).  After removal of ultrafines (-10µm) the fine stream (10 - 50µm) will be 

subjected to wet high gradient magnetic separation (WHGMS). 

The three streams of magnetic products will be thickened and deposited in a tailings facility, as will the -10 mm 

slimes, both potentially being co-deposited with the +1 mm rejects. 

The three non-magnetic streams will be final product.  In order to control the particle size distribution and slurry 

density at the optimal values for pumping the concentrate will be milled and thickened prior to pumping through 

an overland pipeline.  The concentrate will be pumped to the port at Chugue by pumping.  Where the 

concentrate slurry will be filtered and dried to approximately 8% moisture.  The dried product will be stockpiled 

prior to loading onto ships. 

Where possible, thickener overflows at the mine site recycled to the head of the process.  Water removed from 

the concentrate slurry at the port site will be cleaned sufficiently to be discharged into the Geba River. 

The circuit described above has not been tested exactly as described.  However, from the results of the testwork 

performed to date it may be deduced that a phosphate product containing approximately 32.7% P2O5, 2.7% 

Fe2O3, 0.9% Al2O3 and 3.6% SiO2 can be made.

3.2.8 Environmental and Permitting Consideration 

In Guinea-Bissau, the Secretary of State's Office for the Environment is responsible for environmental policy.  

It encompasses an Environmental Department, which has three branches: 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 16 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• The Service for Urban Environment 

• The Service for the Management of Natural Resources 

• The Service for Protected Areas 

The management of forests and fauna comes under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 

Hunting.  This Ministry has two branches: 

• The Service for Forest Development and Exploitation 

• The Service for Managing Fauna 

In 2005, the Environmental Impact Evaluation Unit (CAIA), whose brief is to advise the Prime Minister on 

environmental issues, was established.  Its areas of competence cover the following: 

• To support the implementation of an environmental impact evaluation procedure 

• To ensure, in collaboration with the relevant institutions, the monitoring of environmental impact 

mitigation measures 

• To ensure environmental evaluation processes are complied with and to advice on environmental 

studies and reports 

• To instruct and take into account the technical advice of the Authorities responsible for the 

environment 

The Guinea-Bissau Act, ratified by the Council of Ministers on the 19 March 2008, has not yet been 

promulgated.  However, it may be considered that its application will be confirmed.  The Project would be 

classed in category A, subject to an in-depth environmental impact study in order to evaluate the repercussions 

of the mining activities on the natural and human environments and to take them on board so as to make 

allowances for them in the planning and implementation of the project.  Moreover, the Environmental Act of 

Guinea-Bissau and its implementing order oblige the mining company to carry out an Environmental Evaluation 

Study (EES) prior to the Environmental and Social Impact Study (EIES). 

3.2.9 Materials Handling 

A basic assumption of this study is that the beneficiation plant is located near a suitable tailings site, within 3 km 

of the mine.  The material handling system between the mine and the beneficiation plant comprises the 

following: 

• a slurry pipeline to transport phosphate ore from the production dredge to a storage area located 

close to the beneficiation plant and, 

• a storage area at the beneficiation site in addition to emergency sump areas for long term dump 

storage.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

3.2.10 Tailing Management 

No tailings site has been selected for the Farim Phosphate Project.  A Cost has been estimated for a tailings 

disposal facility based on generic assumptions and conditions in the Project area.  Infrastructure costs at the 

beneficiation plant site include an allowance for piping for tailings and reclaim water. 

3.2.11 Capital and Operating Costs 

The pre-production capital cost of US$ 288.13 million, including a contingency, covers the construction and 

development work to bring the Project into production, including pre-stripping, mine development to a 

sustainable production level, construction and infrastructure related to the beneficiation plant and installation of 

services to support the Project.  The estimate includes the estimated costs for the slurry pipeline from the 

beneficiation plant to the sea port located at Pointe Chugue a distance of 80 km and includes all associated 

storage, dewatering and loading installations at the port site. 

The estimate includes direct costs of equipment, materials and labour, as well as indirect costs such as EPCM, 

temporary construction services, owner's costs and contingencies.  Costs for advancing the Project to 

construction stage, such as resource upgrade drilling, project financing, land acquisition, permitting, 

environmental studies and feasibility studies are included.  Table 3-9 below provides a summary of capital costs.

SECTION 4 INTRODUCTION 
IMC Group Consulting Limited (IMC or IMCGCL) together with GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants 

Limited (GBM), the employers of the QP's, were retained by Resource Hunter Capital Corp (Resource Hunter) 

to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Farim Phosphate Project (the Project) located in Guinea-

Bissau, West Africa.   

The purpose of this report is to provide a Preliminary Assessment of the economic potential of the Project.  This 

Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  Resource Hunter has an 

Earn In Agreement with GB Minerals1 who in turn holds 100% of the mineral rights to the areas considered in 

this Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). 

GBM, represented by Michael Short, undertook a site visit on the 8thth February, 2010. The objectives were to 

inspect the site of the Farim Project as well as the surrounding infrastructure and to assess the available 

information and data pertaining to the resource and Farim Project. 

Part of GBM's responsibilities were the oversight of the metallurgical testwork, preliminary process plant 

design, preliminary infrastructure design including the slurry pipeline, roads, township, tailings dam, power and 

water supplies and the preliminary estimates of capital and operating costs. 

The engineering performed in this report is limited to that deemed necessary to establish the essential elements 

of the Project in order to arrive at a logical conclusion as to the viability of the Farim Project, taking into 

account the geology, mineral resources, mining, metallurgical testwork, processing, infrastructure, 

environmental considerations, capital and operating costs and economic evaluation. 

The "Geological Qualified Person" (within the meaning of NI 43-101) for the purposes of this report is Andre 

Lambert BSc (Hons) MIMM, EuroGeol.  Of IMC visited the site of the Farim Project from Friday 8th October to 

Monday 11th October, 2010. His visit involved the review of the drilling and sampling, storage and sampling 

preparation, inspection of core and geological interpretations. 

Resource Hunter is an independent Canadian junior mining company. 

Early work on the Project was carried out in from 1981 to 1983 by the French Government agency Bureau of 

Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) who carried out an extensive exploration and delineation core 

drilling program of 102 holes totalling 5,672 m and identified a Historic phosphate Resource of 113 million 

tonnes grading 29.8% P2O5.  This Historic Resource estimate by BRGM has not been reviewed by the Qualified 

Person, should not be considered to represent a current resource and should not be relied upon.  Metallurgical 

testing by BRGM demonstrated that a phosphate concentrate grading 36.5% P2O5 could be produced.  In 1986 

another French agency, Sofremines, carried out a prefeasibility study on the Project that indicated that the 

Project was economically viable.  However the world phosphate market was in a downturn at that point in time 

and the Project did not proceed.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

In August 1997, a Canadian junior mining company named Champion Resources Inc, acquired the Project and 

carried out a further core drilling program of some 34 holes totalling 1810 m increasing the size and extent of 

the phosphate deposit and confirmed the earlier BRGM results.  In March 2000, Champion calculated a Historic 

Indicated and Measured phosphate resource of 166 million tonnes grading 29.06% P2O5.  This Historic 

Resource estimate by Champion has not been reviewed by the Qualified Person, should not be considered to 

represent a current resource and should not be relied upon.  Champion collected fresh samples for metallurgical 

testwork and completed a further prefeasibility study that also concluded that the project would be economically 

viable.  The world phosphate rock prices were still depressed and the Project did not proceed any further.  

Champion gave up the Project in mid 2003 when the company acquired the Red Back gold assets in Ghana and 

changed its name to Red Back Mining Inc and became a significant gold producer. 

In 2009, GB Minerals AG acquired the Farim Phosphate deposit.  In 2008 – 2009, under the supervision of 

GEEEM, an additional 30 drill holes were completed to verify and confirm previous drilling programs by 

BRGM and Champion Resources.   

A resource estimate for the Farim Phosphate deposit was calculated by the French consultants, GeoImpact, as 

105 million tonnes at 31.23% P2O5 in the Measured and Indicated category. This Historic Resource Estimate has 

been reviewed and amended and it should not be considered to represent the current resource and should not be 

relied upon.   

The Project area has limited infrastructure for operating a mine. 

The economic analysis contained in this report is based on Measured and Indicated Resources and is preliminary 

in nature and there is no certainty that, the development of reserves from the resources, or the production and 

economic forecasts on which this preliminary assessment is based, will be realised.

The property boundaries were located by staking concrete beacons. 

The phosphate bearing zones underlie the Mining Lease License area 

6.2 Land Description and Property Agreements 

GB Minerals signed an exclusive and comprehensive production agreement with the government of Guinea-

Bissau in 2009 which outlines the terms and conditions under which the mining process may start and be 

conducted.  The Production Agreement includes the production licenses and the Mining Lease and Licenses as 

shown in Figure 6-3, Figure 6-5 and Figure 6-7 below in their original Portuguese language with English 

translations shown in Figure 6-4, Figure 6-6 and Figure 6-8 respectively. 

The Lease licence gives GB Minerals the right to use the concession area for mineral mining while the mining 

licence allows developing, mining, producing, treating, commercialising and selling minerals, mining products 

and their derivatives produced within the concession area.  The incentive agreement states some of the 

guarantees and financing incentives provided by the government of Guinea-Bissau. 

The Production Agreement is set for an initial period of 25 years and may be extended for a successive period of 

25 years upon application.  The agreement also sets out rights and obligations in respect of the exploitation of 

the Farim mineral deposit and regulates the amount of taxes and royalties to be paid.  It also regulates the rights 

regarding access and use, building of infrastructures (port, roads, pipelines etc), equipment and instruments, 

manufacturing of fertilizer products, medical assistance, personnel, transport, telecommunications etc. 

The concession area for the Production Agreement is defined as the area where the Farim deposit is located and 

where the operations will take place.  If the deposit extends beyond the boundaries of the concession area, the 

production agreement (including the licenses) can be extended to cover this area. 

The building of structures and infrastructure like the port, roads etc is at the sole discretion of GB Minerals with 

no taxes, license fees etc to be levied by the Government. 

The Guinea-Bissau Government will exempt GB Minerals from the payment of any taxes from the start of 

commercial operations for a period of 10 years.  The 2% royalty is tax deductible. 

The issuer, Resource Hunter, has acquired the right to interests in the Project by way of an agreement with 

Plains Creek Mining Limited ("Plains Creek") whereby Plains Creek will complete a reverse takeover (the 

"RTO") of Resource Hunter.  As a result of the RTO, Resource Hunter will acquire all of the issued and 

outstanding securities of Plains Creek in exchange for like securities of Resource Hunter on a one-for-one basis, 

and the business of Plains Creek will become the business of Resource Hunter.  Plains Creek has entered into a 

share purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") wherein Plains Creek will acquire 50.1% ownership of 

GB Minerals (the "Acquisition"), which is the company that holds all right, interest and title to the Project, upon 

completion of the RTO, and has the right to acquire a further 49.9% ownership of GB Minerals under a 

shareholders' agreement (the "Shareholders' Agreement") governing the ownership of GB Minerals. 

As a result of the RTO and Acquisition, Resource Hunter will indirectly own 50.1% ownership of GB Minerals 

and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Plains Creek will become operator of the Project and operating costs will

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

be shared pro rata in proportion to the ownership of GB Minerals under the Shareholders' Agreement.  Under 

the Purchase Agreement, Resource Hunter will, through Plains Creek, have: 

(a) the right to acquire an additional 24.9% of GB Minerals (to bring its total ownership up to 75%) at a 
purchase price of €13,500,000 by December 31, 2012, conditional upon arrangement of financing to 
bring the Project into production; and 

(b) the right to acquire an additional 25% of GB Minerals (to bring its total ownership up to 100%) at a 
purchase price of €13,500,000 by December 31, 2015, conditional upon commencement of production 
of the Project.

SECTION 7 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Farim Phosphate Project is accessible by 120 km of paved highway northeast from the capital city of 

Bissau.  A ferry across the Cacheu River, which is about 300 m to 500 m wide, provides access to the town of 

Farim on the north bank.  The majority of the phosphate resources lie to the north of the Cacheu River and are 

accessed by an approximately 5 km long unimproved gravel road westwards from the town of Farim.  The river 

is tidal and Farim, which is about 150 km from the open ocean (Atlantic), is accessible by barge. 

The region is open, semi-arid savannah woodland.  The climate is tropical with a mean annual temperature of 

25˚C.  The rainy season occurs from June to October and is most intense in August and September.  Average 

annual rainfall is 1,950 mm in Bissau and about 1,100 mm in the area of the deposit 

The Project area is flat with an elevation change being about 20 m over a distance of 4 km between the Cacheu 

River and the NW edge of the deposit.  The Project area drains into the River Cacheu . The elevation of the 

wider project are varies between 5 and 50 metres above sea level. 

The local infrastructure is primitive.  The town of Farim has limited infrastructure that is suitable to a mining 

operation of the scale proposed for the Project.  It will be necessary to construct housing, medical and associated 

infrastructure to accommodate the impact on the town of Farim.  Local labour is focussed toward agriculture 

and interstate and expatriate labour will be required to service the proposed operations.  There is no local power 

supply and a 15-20 MW diesel or oil-fired power station to service the operation is proposed.

SECTION 8 HISTORY 
Phosphate was first discovered in one geotechnical drill hold as part of a water survey in 1950 and noted again 

in one oil drill hole drilled by Esso in 1965. 

The French Bureau of Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) conducted an extensive exploration and 

delineation drilling program from 1981 to 1983, during which time they drilled 5,672 m of large diameter core 

in 101 holes.  This enabled them to carry out a detailed geological study of the deposit and provided a 

comprehensive database for the French agency Sofremines to conduct a prefeasibility study in 1986.  The 

prefeasibility study was positive but market conditions and political considerations precluded development at 

that time and the French agencies withdrew from the Project. 

The "geological resource" of the area was estimated using polygonal methods to be 113 million tonnes of ore at 

30% P2O5.  The "ore reserves" were calculated from the geological resource by application of loss and dilution 

factors.  The extraction of the ore was estimated to result in a loss of 10% and dilution of 10% from the barren 

hanging wall and lower grade of phosphate in the footwall.  The tonnage of run-of-mine ore was taken to remain 

the same but its grade reduced to 29.75% P2O5.  Economic estimation yielded a historic resource of 68 Mt at a 

cut-off stripping ratio of 15 and 37 Mt at a cut-off stripping ratio of 10, both at an average grade to beneficiation 

of 29.75% P2O5.  This Historic Resource estimate by BRGM has not been reviewed by the Qualified Person, 

and should not be considered to represent a current resource and should not be relied upon. 

In 1997 a Canadian exploration company, Champion Resources Inc., acquired ownership of the Farim 

phosphate deposit and carried out diamond drilling campaigns in 1998 and 1999 totalling 1,810 m in 34 holes.  

The main purposes of the Champion drilling were to confirm the BRGM results for due diligence purposes; to 

provide fresh phosphate samples for metallurgical testwork, and to expand the phosphate resource to the west.  

The programmes were successful in that all three goals were achieved.  Champion Resources Inc carried out a 

prefeasibility study which again demonstrated that a phosphate mining and beneficiation project was 

economically viable.  However, no further progress was made due to both internal political and external market 

conditions and phosphate rock prices. 

The total historic resource was modelled using Medsystem software.  It was estimated by the Inverse Distance 

to the power of 2 (ID2) algorithm.  The historic resource was 166 Mt at 29% P2O5, 10.5% FeAl and 10% SiO2 

of which the Measured Resource was 53 Mt at 29.8% P2O5 and the Indicated Resource was 113 Mt at 28.7% 

P2O5.  The resource calculations were conducted according to USGS Circular 882 but with a modified 

projection radius of 500 m for a Measured Resource.  Again this Historic Resource Estimate by Champion has 

not been reviewed by the Qualified Person, and again should not be considered to represent a current resource 

and should not be relied upon.. 

In 2004 a Swiss company, GB Phosphate, acquired an exploration licence over the Farim phosphate deposit and 

evaluated its potential.  They undertook several comprehensive studies including excavating a box cut; drilling 

30 holes to confirm and validate the work of previous explorers; a hydrological study; an environmental impact 

study; and an economic evaluation of the Project.  In 2009 GB Minerals AG signed a comprehensive production 

agreement with the Government of Guinea-Bissau.  This agreement includes a production licence and numerous

incentives and concessions for the development and commercialisation of the Farim Phosphate Project.  In total, 

an amount of approximately €20 million has been spent on the Project. 

A comparison of the Historical Resources is shown in Table 8-1.  A cut-off for the thickness of the phosphate 

layer of 1.5 m has been used in all cases.

These Historic Resource estimates have not been reviewed by the Qualified Person and they should not be 

considered to represent a Current Resource and should not be relied upon. 

The two resources estimates presented above are from distinct overlapping areas, they differ in size but are 

grossly coherent in terms of thicknesses, grades and descriptions of the phosphatic beds.

SECTION 9 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

9.1 Regional Geology 

The Farim phosphate deposit is found within the Middle Eocene Lutetian Formation that forms part of the 

southern margin of the Mauritania-Senegal-Guinea Cenozoic sedimentary basin (Prian 1987).  The basin 

extends from Morocco in the north through Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and into Guinea to the south.  

The Mid-Eocene and particularly the Lutetian of the basin contains known phosphate horizons and hosts a 

number of important economic phosphate deposits including Bofal in Mauritania and Taïba, Thiès and Matam 

in Senegal.  It accounts for almost 25% of current world rock phosphate production. 

The sediments of this basin were formed in the palaeo-gulf of Casamance, which extended from the southeast of 

Mauritania in a generally south westerly direction into what is now the Atlantic Ocean. 

The regional geology and setting of Farim is shown on Figure 9-1. 

9.2 Local Geology 

As stated by Prian (1987), the Farim area forms part of the southern margin of the former Casamance gulf and is 

located 60 km north-west of the southern edge of the Senegal-Mauritania-Guinea sedimentary basin in which 

the Maastrichtian strata unconformably overlies the Devonian pelite sequence.  The various Mesozoic and 

Cenozoic formations become thinner and wedge out progressively from north-west to south-east towards the 

Devonian bedrock.  Abrupt condensing and wedging out of the Eocene sedimentary units occurs in the Farim 

area around an elevated structure known as the Rio Jumbembem ridge, which gives way south-westwards to the 

Binta high.  The high rectilinear Rio Jumbembem ridge strikes N 50-60' E and is positioned over a basement 

flexure.  Immediately to the south-west of Farim, between the high points of Rio Jumbembem and Binta, is the 

smaller Saliquinhé bay, 3 km wide from north-west to south-east and 5 km long from south-west so north-east, 

open to the north-east and closed to the south-west.  A subsidence zone at the southeast edge of the Casamance 

gulf lies to the north-west of this zone of highs, which is marked by sequential condensing and frequent wedging 

out of the various Palaeocene and Eocene sedimentary units. 

The late Palaeocene occupies an elevated position and forms the greater part of the Rio Jumbembem ridge, in 

which it is composed of nummulitic limestone, becoming argillaceous and marly towards the Palaeocene 

subsidence zone to the north-west.

Figure 9-1 Regional Geology and Setting of Farim 

The Eocene is condensed and/or reduced over elevated zones.  Boreholes located on the Rio Jumbembem high 

have all the lithologic units of the lower to upper Eocene present, but extremely condensed (39 m).  The 

thickness of these units in the subsidence zone is over 70 m. 

Abrupt sequential condensing occurs in the Farim area near the phosphate deposit.  This is particularly evident 

in the calcareous and phosphatic sequence.  Only the lower to basal middle Eocene, composed of argillaceous 

and micritic Iaminite, is present in the elevated zone.  The calcareous-phosphatic middle Eocene and the 

calcareous-dolomitic upper Eocene are notably absent the Binta high.  The middle and upper Eocene are, 

however, well developed to the north of the high. 

Throughout this area of the Senegal-Guinea sedimentary basin, the Eocene, Palaeocene and Maastrichtian are 

respectively unconformably overlain south-eastwards by an Oligo-Mio-Pliocene and Quaternary sandy-

argillaceous sequence displaying black lignitic clay at the base.  This is locally overlain by a greensand

sequence, probably Miocene in age, containing thin limestone beds.  These units underlie a sandy-argillaceous 

sequence assigned to the late Continental.  The thickness of post Eocene sandy-argillaceous cover ranges from 

15 m to 35 m in the Farim area, and from 50 m to 64 m in the basin subsidence zone. 

The local geology beneath the overburden is shown in Figure 9-2 (Prian 1987). 

 

Figure 9-2 Local Geology beneath the Overburden (Prian 1987) 

9.3 Property Geology 

9.3.1 Stratigraphy 

The geological sequence at Farim displays the following lithological units from top to bottom: 

• Sandy-argillaceous overburden with soft, alternating sandy, clayey and sandy-clayey layers 

• Phosphatic interval (FPO)  

• Upper dolomitic limestone  

• Decarbonised phosphate unit (FPA) corresponding to the Saliquinhé phosphate deposit  

• Calcareous phosphate member (FPB)  

• Limestone at the footwall of the phosphate sequence, white, soft and porous  

Figure 9-3 shows a typical cross section of the Farim deposit together with a lithostratigraphic column (Prian 

1985).

Figure 9-3 A typical cross section of the Farim Deposit together with a Lithostratigraphic Column 

(Prian 1985) 

The three phosphate-bearing horizons referred to as FPO, FPB and FPA are described below. 

9.3.1.1 FPO 

The FPO is a clayey dolomitic limestone that is weakly phosphatic and has limited economic potential.  It 

comprises laminated green clays and aluminophosphate and is 0.5 m to 1 m thick.  At the surface in the higher 

zones, laterite with a ferruginous cover in places may be found.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

9.3.1.2 FPA 

The FPA is localized within the Saliquinhé bay sub-basin and is the potentially economic phosphate bed.  The 

sub-basin is bounded to the south and east by carbonate platform rocks against which the FPA wedges out.  The 

north-western limit of the FPA has not yet been defined.  To the north, the Tambato submarine bar, which 

formed a barrier between the Saliquinhé bay and the deeper Casamance basin, will likely form the northern 

limited of the FPA unit but this has not been demonstrated by drilling. 

The FPA is a soft, poorly cemented unit of phosphatic sand, which includes phosphatised shell and bone 

material, teeth, faecal pellets and crustacean coprolites.  It is mildly indurated and includes siliceous layers 5 to 

20 cm thick, which comprise an average of 6% of the unit.  A mixture of saprolitic fine sand and clays, which 

are generally unconsolidated, overlies the FPA.  The immediate hanging wall to the FPA is 20 to 60 cm thick 

unconsolidated sand. 

The hanging wall rocks are oxidized reddish brown to an elevation of about 10 m below sea level.  The FPA is 

grey to beige and brown and lies in a generally reducing environment below the oxidized interval.  This is 

important because iron oxide, which is soluble in sulphuric acid, is a contaminant in phosphate deposits whereas 

iron sulphide, which is insoluble in sulphuric acid, is not. 

The FPA unit has an average width of about 3 m to 4 m (in the resource area) and underlies an area of about 

40 km2.  In the northern part of the basin, north of the village of Saliquinhé, a north-easterly trending area about 

4.5 km long and 1 km wide has FPA thickness typically greater than 4.0 m and up to 6.2 m.  A smaller area to 

the south of Saliquinhé, near the Cacheu River, also exceeds 4.0 m in width (maximum 5.0 m). 

9.3.1.3 FPB 

The FPB is a calcareous phosphate unit that is 20 to 60 m thick with marginal economic potential.  It consists of 

alternating soft phosphate strata with carbonaceous gangue and thinner, hard strata of slightly phosphatic 

bioclastic limestone.  This horizon is known to extend 20 km north-south and 50 km east-west with thickness 

variable from less than 1 m to tens of metres with cover of 40 m to over 100 m.

Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

SECTION 10 DEPOSIT TYPES 
In the property, two main types of phosphate have been identified, differentiated by their petrography and 

chemical composition: 

• FPA layer, a decarbonated phosphate with very high P2O5 content of about 30% P2O5, formed 

exclusively in the shallow water of the Saliquinhé basin 

• The lower grade FPB layer of highly carbonated phosphate, generally containing 5-15% P2O5 

(average 13% P2O5) with some values up to 20% 

The phosphate of Farim was formed in an infralittoral maritime environment, in the gulf of Saliquinhé open to 

on the ocean.  The first phosphate deposit, FPB, was thick at the entry of the gulf and formed a bar (the "bar of 

Bani") which slowed down the water exchange with the ocean.  The phosphate deposited in the shallow water of 

Saliquinhé was thus trapped.  The interaction between the two bodies of water supported the decarbonatation 

and enrichment of phosphate in the upper layers of FPB, thus differentiating the high grade FPA deposit. 

The isobaths of the micritic limestone hanging wall shows a palaeostructure in the bottom of the gulf that is 

open to the northeast and encircled to the southwest by low water level areas.  The phosphate horizons are 

transgressive on the micritic limestone.  FPA lies just above FPB or above the limestone when FPB is absent 

(suggesting early erosion of FPB). 

For FPA, the "bar of Bani" at least partly prevented this phenomenon.  However, agitation by shallow marine 

water altered the deposit and formed the phosphate grains, destructing the carbonates (cement and crystals) and 

leaving the FPA with a grainstone structure consisting almost exclusively of phosphate with only minor detrital 

quartz and a little clay binder remaining.  The upper part of FPA is a level of aluminophosphate (crandallite) 

with strong indurations that has a thickness of 10 to 50 cms.

SECTION 11 MINERALIZATION 
The Farim phosphate deposit is a flat-lying sedimentary phosphatic bed, which underlies an area in excess of 

40 km2.  Three phosphate-bearing units have been identified at Farim which can be differentiated by their 

petrography and chemical composition.  Descriptions of each unit have been provided in Section 9 of this 

document and summarised below (Champion, March 2000 and May 2000): 

• FPA.  The FPA layer is a decarbonated biophosphate with very high P2O5 content of about 30% 

(consistently higher than 25%).  The FPA ore is phosphate sand that is unconsolidated, 

homogeneous, with a grainstone texture and which includes phosphatised shell and bone material, 

teeth, faecal pellets and crustacean coprolites.  It is soft, friable and has grains less than 800 µm in 

size.  There is no calcareous cement and it contains little silica and clay.  It is mildly indurated and 

includes siliceous or pyritized layers 5 to 20 cm thick which comprise an average of 6 % of the unit. 

• FPB.  A calcareous phosphate unit, 20 to 60 m thick.  The lower grade FPB layer consists of 

highly carbonated phosphate, generally containing 5-20% P2O5 with an average of 13% P2O5.  The 

FPB phosphatic limestone is indurated and much harder than FPA.  FPB located immediately below 

FPA, but exists under only 50% of the area of FPA, and has an average thickness of about 4m.  FPB 

also has a large extent outside of FPA. 

• FBO.  A weakly phosphatic, clay-rich dolomitic limestone unit. 

The FPA unit is currently considered the potentially economic phosphate horizon.  Grades of sedimentary 

phosphate deposits of worldwide distribution as compiled by Mosier (1986) are in the range of 15 to 32%.  The 

Farim deposit is at the higher end of that range (Champion, May 2000).    

The FPB and FBO units are currently considered uneconomic.  A few drill holes have shown that the FPB type 

of bio-calcareous phosphate sedimentation extends around Farim in a large area with a possible extent of 50 km 

x 20 km with thickness up to 20 m.  This requires further exploration as well as tests of concentration by 

calcination.  FPB is not part of the present economic study. 

FPA has an average thickness of approximately 3 m within the resource area, which is defined by the 1.5 m 

isopach and underlies an area of approximately 40 km2.  This area is further subdivided into a north and south 

portion, as indicated on Figure 11-1.

Figure 11-1 North and South Zone Designation of the Farim Deposit 

The northern part is 7.3 km2 and consists of three distinct areas: 

• Areas A and C, where the stripping ratio is below 10 and the average thickness of ore is more than 

5 m. 

• The intermediate zone B where the stripping ratio is between 10 and 15 and the average ore 

thickness is 4 m. 

• The southern part which extends over 4.1 km2 and is divided into two distinct areas. 

• Area E with a stripping ratio of between 6 and 10 and an average thickness of 4 m. 

• The peripheral zone D with a stripping ratio of between 10 and 15 and an average thickness of 

3.5 m. 

Only the northern resource area was considered in the Champion report (Champion May 2000). 

The limits of the FPA unit, the hanging and the foot walls, are clearly defined.  The hanging wall rocks are a 20 

to 60 cm thick mixture of unconsolidated saprolitic fine sand and clays overlying the FPA unit.  These are 

oxidized reddish brown to an elevation of about 10 metres below sea level.  The FPA is grey to beige and brown

and lies in a generally reducing environment below the oxidized interval.  This is important because iron oxide, 

which is soluble in sulphuric acid, is a contaminant in phosphate deposits whereas iron sulphide, which is 

insoluble in sulphuric acid, is not.  (Champion, May 2000). 

The FPA is very regular, sub-horizontal and of continuous extension.  Given this continuity, there is no 

requirement for geological control by % P2O5 cut-off.  The only parameter used to define the mining resources 

is the Overburden Ratio, R, which has been defined as the thickness of sterile overburden / thickness of the ore. 

The regularity of FPA is highlighted by the following example.  Using a cut-off Overburden Ratio of R=15, the 

exploitable zones extend continuously over 12.5 km2 in which all the drill holes intersect FPA with a minimum 

thickness of 3 m (varying from 3 m to 6 m, average 3.96 m) and regular P2O5 content varying from 28% to 34% 

P2O5 (except one hole with 24% P2O5)., average 29.9%.  The overburden thickness ranges from 30 m to 56 m, 

average 38.5 m.  This zone contains sufficient ore to produce 2 Mt/y over 25 years.

SECTION 12 EXPLORATION 
Phosphate was first discovered in one geotechnical drill hole as part of a water survey in 1950 and noted again 

in one oil drill hole drilled by Esso in 1965.  The Directorate of Geology and Mines of Guinea-Bissau 

(DGMGB) commenced initial exploration of the Farim area in 1973, funded by the United Nations 

Development Programme.  They carried out seven drill holes between 1977 and 1979.  These findings were 

reported in 1980 and showed the presence of the Eocene phosphate similar to the sedimentary deposits of Bofal 

in Mauritania and Taïba and Matam in Senegal under miocene-pliocene cover.  One drill hole intersected 4.9 m 

of phosphate at 25% P2O5 under 40 m of sand-clay overburden. 

12.1 BRGM 

Exploration, geological investigation and reserve assessments of the Farim phosphate deposit were conducted 

during the following three BRGM campaigns, which provided extensive information including respective 

sample evaluations, data assimilation and investigative reports. 

In 1981 BRGM carried out regional strategic exploration (Phase 1)  between the Rio Cacheu and the Senegal 

border on a 40 km x 25 km area lying northwest-southeast and including Farim. 

A total of 32 holes of 35 m to 95 m depth were drilled, representing 2100 m, of which 1384 m were cored.  This 

demonstrated the presence of a layer of phosphate (FPA) over an area of 40 km2 centred on the village of 

Saliquinhé.  This layer had high a phosphate content of 30% P2O5 and was seen to be 2 m to 5 m thick under a 

cover of 30 m to 60 m. 

An 18 kg composite sample of FPA was taken from four drill holes and used for laboratory treatment testing.  

These yielded concentrates of 35% P2O5 from a sample containing 30.9% P2O5.  A 14 kg composite sample of 

FPB was taken from four drill holes but did not produce good results. 

In 1982 - 1983, BRGM conducted a campaign (Phase 2) to evaluate the reserves of this zone of Saliquinhé to 

determine the mining parameters and to carry out a detailed geological investigation. 

There were 69 holes drilled on a grid of 500 m x 500 m (1000 m x 1000 m on the edge of the deposit) for a total 

of 3527 m.  This was comprised of 2,145 m percussion drilling in the overburden and 1472 m of 108 mm 

diameter core drilling in FPA and FPB where it existed. 

The historic geological resource of FPA was estimated to be 113 Mt at 30% P2O5 over an area of 24.5 km
2, with 

an average thickness 3.27 m (minimum 1.5 m) under an overburden of about 40 m (28 m to 69 m).  Gamma ray 

logging was carried out on all the drillings. This Historic Resource estimate by BRGM has not been reviewed by 

the Qualified Person, should not be considered to represent a current resource and should not be relied upon.. 

470 kg of representative samples were taken from 30 holes for beneficiation tests carried out in BRGM's 

Orleans facilities and in the laboratory of the Taïba Phosphates Company.  Concentrates containing 32% P2O5 

and 3.5% FeAl were produced by simple magnetic separation.  This was improved to 37% P2O5 and 2.5% FeAl 

by using flotation plus WHIMS and 1.5% FeAl with dry magnetic separation.

Gamma ray logging was carried out in some holes, the number of which is unclear.  The logs obtained were of 

excellent quality and allowed identification (to the nearest 10 cm) of the contact between the overburden and the 

phosphate rich, phosphate rich and phosphate poor with limestone or phosphate and limestone footwall . 

The following examinations were also carried out on drill-cores: 

• 400 thin sections for petrography and 400 washings for micropalaeontology.  These were 

examined by BRGM specialists; 

• 90 samples of micropalaeontology of vertebrates, teeth of Selacians and Betides.  These were 

examined by the Faculty of Science of Montpellier; 

• Examination of invertebrates (ostracised) in 7 surveys, by the Faculty of Science of Lyon; and 

• X-ray diffraction of 47 samples.  These were used to determine the argillaceous minerals of the 

phosphate series and the ferrous minerals of the FPA hanging wall. 

The gangue is minor in quantity.  Detrital quartz represents 5 % to 10% of the mass.  The pyrite and marcasite 

are present in variable amounts in FPA, occurring as fine particles, coatings of phosphate grains or as cement in 

the narrow secondary silicified and pyritized levels associated with iron carbonates (ankerite).  In certain thin 

sections a ferruginous epigenesis of the organic structures is present.  There is also a very small amount of clay 

present as a discrete matrix between the phosphate grains. 

This was followed in 1985 (Phase 3) when BRGM drilled 8 or 9 drillholes for geotechnical and hydrogeological 

information.  Concurrent with this third phase of work, Sofremines carried out a Prefeasibility Study that was 

reported in 1986.  This detailed mining a 29.8% P2O5 resource to produce 500,000 tonnes of 35.5% P2O5 

concentrate annually for 20 years.  

The BRGM staff on site were:  

• JP Prian A highly qualified and experienced mining geologist from BRGM as Project 

Manager 

• P Gamma Exploration Geologist of the DGMGB 

• Mr Lafond Drilling Technical Manager. 

12.2 Champion 

After acquiring the project in 1997, Champion engaged consultants to review the previous work.  No fatal flaws 

in the project were found and recommendations for further work leading to a full feasibility study of the project 

were presented. 

During 1998 and 1999, Champion Resources Inc. carried out 34 core drillings totalling 1810 m, mainly in the 

west and northwest of the zone explored by BRGM, to check the extension of the deposit in those two 

directions.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

Champion's geological resources calculation included these 34 drill holes and the 69 of the BRGM programme 

and estimated the resource to contain 166 Mt at 29.06% P2O5.  This resource covered an area of 38 km
2 and was 

in a layer of 3.15 m average thickness under about 40 m of overburden.  This Historic Resource estimate by 

Champion has not been reviewed by the Qualified Person, should not be considered to represent a current 

resource and should not be relied upon.. 

The Mineral Corporation TMC audited the exploration work of 1998 and directed that of 1999.  The resources 

were estimated by MRDI of Canada on the basis of data supplied by Champion and audited by John Zbeetnoff. 

12.3 GB Minerals 

During 2008 and 2009 GB Minerals drilled 10 holes in the northern area of the deposit and 20 holes at short 

spacing in order to obtain cores and to calculate a variogram at short distance.  Figure 12-1 shows the layout.  

These holes totalled 1564 m and included 423 m of core drilling.  Gamma ray logging was carried out on 26 

holes. 

Drilling works were supervised by Messrs D. Mariton and G. Voglet, experienced senior geologists, and Mr. 

Max Lasserre, Chief Geologist.

SECTION 13 DRILLING 
Drilling in and around the Farim project area has been carried out by numerous companies since discovery of 

the deposit.  The current database contains 165 holes comprising 9046 m of drilling using a combination of 

percussion and core drilling techniques.  The drilling coverage and phosphate thickness is shown in Figure 11.1.  

Since the layers of phosphate are horizontal, all the holes were drilled vertically and therefore thickness shown 

are believed to be true thickness.  The average depth of drill holes at Farim is 57 m. 

13.1 Drilling Procedures 

13.1.1 BRGM 

The BRGM drilling programme was carried out in three phases between 1981 and 1985.  This consisted of 101 

drill holes totalling 5,672 m of which 2,861 m was core drilling. 

Generally the upper formations were drilled with a destructive rotary bit. The bit was removed some 2 metres 

above the estimated roof of the FPA and a wireline bit was lowered to drill the phosphatic horizons down to a 

metre below the FPB.  If the roof was missed, the hole was generally re-drilled but it may happen that the FPA 

roof be over the cored interval 

Drilling a soft formation containing hard nodules and lenses, like the FPA, is not a trivial exercise as the hard 

stones present tend to destroy the sand below, which is dis-aggregated and washed away. Even with a triple 

barrel and an expert driller the recovery should be expected to vary and low values reported in the BRGM and 

following reports should not be attributed to bad practice or to negligence. The phosphatic clasts have a porous 

texture and a very low density.  Although the crystallized apatite is denser than quartz, the phosphatic clasts are 

lighter than quartz and are washed probably more easily.  A boost of the phosphate grade is not expected in this 

process. 

The thickness of the phosphatic layer was systematically double-checked with a probe measuring the uranium 

radiations, in close correlation with the phosphorous content.  

Phase one of the BRGM drilling programme was a regional exploration program carried out in 1981 covering a 

40 km x 25 km area lying northwest-southeast and including Farim.  A total of 32 holes of 35 m to 95 m depth 

were drilled, representing 2,100 m, of which 1,384 were cored. 

Phase two was a local exploration campaign carried out in 1982 - 1983 to define the resources at Farim.  A total 

of 69 holes were drilled over an area of approximately 40 km2 (5 km by 8 km) on a 500 m grid (1000 m on the 

northern part of the deposit).  This comprised 3,572 m including 2,145 m percussion drilling in the overburden 

and 1,472 m of core drilling in FPA and FPB. 

The setting up of the 500 m x 500 m exploration grid was implemented by a team of topographers from the 

Ministry for the Natural Resources of Guinea-Bissau, directed by a Peruvian specialist.  The ground survey was 

completed in April 1983, with the general survey of Guinea-Bissau by the IGN (French National Geographical 

Institute).

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The following equipment was used: 

• a Longyear 34 drill on a truck and a tanker of 7000 litres 

• trepans tri-cone of 6¼" (160 mm) for overburden drilling, casing of diameter 135-145 mm 

• a Craelius 131T6 drill equipped with high-carbon or diamond core barrels for continuous core 

sampling of the FPA and FPB layers, extracting cores 108 mm in diameter and of  maximum length 

3.05 m 

• casing before introduction of the probe gamma ray (Probe Mount Sopris) 

Phase three consisted of gathering geotechnical and hydrogeological information from eight or nine drill holes.  

It is unclear if these were new or existing drill holes. 

The location of each drill hole was identified on site by BRGM and GB Minerals by a concrete marker bearing 

the number of each hole.  It is unclear whether the location was surveyed. 

13.1.2 Champion 

During 1998 and 1999, Champion carried out 34 core drill holes totalling 1,810 m, mainly in the north and 

northwest of the zone explored by BRGM, to check the extension of the deposit in these two directions.  No 

information was available detailing the type of drill rig used, the diameter of core drilled or whether the collar 

locations were surveyed or the holes were gamma ray logged. 

13.1.3 GB Minerals 

GB Minerals drilled 30 drill holes between 2008 and 2009, totalling 1,564 m of which 423 m was core drilling.  

The balance of the 1,564 m represents the open hole drilling undertaken with a destructive rotary bit.  Gamma 

ray logging was carried out on 30 holes.  The mineralization being a horizontal phosphate bed, the vertical holes 

intersections were representative of the true thickness of the mineralization.  This survey led to a better coverage 

of the North and West part of the deposit, it validated the range of grades and thicknesses observed in the 

previous surveys and gave a better appraisal of the variability of the mineralization.  The average thickness of 

GB Minerals intersections was 3.7 meters for an average grade of 27.6% P205. 

This work was managed and supervised by GEEEM, an independent geological consulting company that was 

contracted by GB Minerals to manage and supervise exploration activities and conduct exploration work 

programs including the drilling at the Project.  The principals of GEEEM have extensive geological experience 

in phosphate deposits, phosphate exploration and mining. 

The following equipment was used: 

• an Ellectari drill on a tractor, core barrels of 108 mm  

• a Klem KR803-1drill crawler, core of 85 mm (PQ) 

• gamma ray diagraphy equipment

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

.The holes were located with GPS but the set for the variogram was surveyed and levelled locally by a 

consulting surveyor. 

The rationale of GB Minerals drilling was to extend the evaluation of the resources in the prospective NW 

direction and to evaluate the short distance variability of the grade and thicknesses parameters, which would 

affect the possible exploitation. 

The GB minerals samples are coherent among themselves but differ significantly for the previous SE 24 hole.  

The driller of Hole SE 24 may have missed the roof (see 13.1.1). 

13.2 Lithological Logging 

The lithological log of each hole was compiled by the geologist (BRGM and GB Minerals) after an examination 

of materials and a simple identification test.  Homogeneous intervals were differentiated by petrography and 

colour, sometimes after examination with a binocular magnifying glass. 

The log was recorded on a section showing the lithology, the rate of recovery, the gamma ray log, the intervals 

selected the P2O5 content and a photograph.  The gamma ray logging, carried out in each survey, defined the 

hanging and foot wall of FPA with precision.  The thickness of the phosphate layer was found with a precision 

close to 10 cm which makes it possible to control the thickness of the FPA and FPB in holes where the rate of 

core recovery is low.  There is also a good correlation between P2O5 content and the amplitude of the recorded 

gamma log.

SECTION 14 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The sampling procedures used by BRGM and GB Minerals were similar.  These procedures are summarized 

below and were considered to be in conformity with the accepted procedures of mining geology. 

The target horizon (FPA) is a soft, poorly cemented unit of phosphatic sand of an average thickness of about 3.3 

meters.  The sand is made of phosphatised shell and bone material, teeth, faecal pellets and crustacean 

coprolites.  It is mildly indurated (with no limey cement) and includes indurated siliceous layers 5 to 20 cm 

thick which comprise an average of 6% of the unit. Another indurated and much harder phosphatic limestone 

(FPB) underlying this horizon was a clear marker to show when drilling had to be stopped, it was not considered 

economic and was not drilled systematically.  

A mixture of saprolitic fine sand and clays, which are generally unconsolidated, overlies the FPA. The 

immediate hanging wall to the target horizon (FPA) is 20 to 60 cm thick unconsolidated sand and is 

systematically subtracted from the pay thickness. 

The hanging wall rocks are oxidized reddish brown to an elevation of about 25/30 m below sea level.  The pay 

horizon is grey to beige and brown and lies in a generally reducing environment below the oxidized interval.   

To log the holes the geologist selected successive homogeneous intervals according to variations of the ore's 

hardness, friability, colour and silica-iron oxide levels, etc.  The core was then cut longitudinally to recover the 

complete half core intervals.  The half cores were then cut into two longitudinally to obtain quarter core samples 

for analyses and constitution of composites samples for treatment tests.  The remaining quarter core was 

retained as a control sample. 

From the Phase 1 drilling, 470 samples were assayed by the laboratory at the Directorate General of Mines 

Bissau.  Of these samples, 178 samples containing more than 10% P2O5 and had complete chemical analysis 

performed. 

For the 69 holes drilled during the second BRGM campaign, 368 intervals were sampled for P2O5 analysis and 

for analysis of 10 other elements at the laboratory of the Directorate General of Mines Bissau.  Of these, 288 

recorded greater than 10% P2O5 content.  The uranium analyses were carried out by Cogema (Areva).  No 

information is available on the size of these samples. 

The 1998 Champion assaying was carried out by Mineral Resources Associates in Florida.  This included P2O5 

for all data and an additional seven elements for selected intervals.  The 1999 Champion assaying was carried 

out by Bateman Projects Limited in South Africa.  The assaying included P2O5 for all sample intervals and an 

additional seven elements for selected intervals.  The number of samples or the sizes of sample intervals were 

not detailed in the Champion report (Champion, March 2000). 

From the holes drilled by GB Minerals, 103 intervals from 30 holes were sampled and analysed.  The cores were 

sampled as described above for BRGM, samples were assayed in ALS Valencia by a standard ALS "Phosphate 

package".

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

14.1 Rate of Recovery of the Cores and Representivity of the Samples 

The rate of recovery of the FPA cores was fair.  80% of the cores from the BRGM holes have a rate higher than 

50% and for GB Minerals the average rate of recovery is of 83%.  These results are related to the granular 

nature of FPA, with low cohesion due to the absence of argillaceous matrix, and by particular constraints: 

• the silica-alumina-iron level at the top of FPA is hard and a piece of core can remain stuck and 

break the phosphate, preventing it forming a core; and 

• the large amount of water in the drilled ore makes it difficult to core a semi-liquid product. 

BRGM state that the P2O5 content of the drill core with weak recovery is lower than the average.  This is 

explained by the fact that the finer phosphate sand, the most easily lost, is of high grade.  The use of the P2O5 
contents of the drillings with weak recovery leads to under estimate the P2O5 content. 

A statistical study carried out by a consultant of Champion shows that: "There is no relationship between 

thickness of FPA and core recovery, and the uses of lower core recovery drill holes in the geological model 

would tend to make the P2O5 grade estimate slightly conservative and would not affect the Fe2O3 grade 

estimate." 

14.2 Density 

Dry density determinations were made by BRGM in 1983.  BRGM took 31 samples from 14 drill holes and sent 

them to the BRGM laboratory in Orleans for density determination using a "membrane densitometer".  Only 

samples with 100% recovery were selected.  The mean density value is 1.43 t/m3 with a lowest value of 

1.18 t/m3 and a highest value of 1.82 t/m3.  The lower density values correspond to a clear colour phosphate and 

the high density values relate to a dark colour phosphate. 

Champion conducted bulk density determinations on 37 samples derived from drill core samples with 100% 

recovery. 

The program included the measurements of core diameter and length.  The 'theoretical volume' for each sample 

was determined by simple computation using the average measured core diameter for competent core and the 

drilled length.  Each sample also had the percentage of core recovered calculated from the ratio of the volume of 

core recovered and the 'theoretical volume'.  Three mass measurements were recorded at the Bateman 

laboratory.  The mass of the sample was measured in an 'as received state, referred to as wet', a mass in an 'air-

dried state', and a mass in an 'oven dried state, at 105ºC.  The bulk density values were computed by dividing 

the 'theoretical volume' by the 'oven-dried mass'.  Samples that had less than full core recovery had the 'oven-

dried mass' adjusted upwards by an amount based on the percent of core loss.  This mass adjustment assumes 

that the material with poor recovery has the same bulk density as the material with good recovery. 

The mean of the values derived by Champion is 1.45 t/m3 after excluding the highest abnormal values.  The 

lowest value is 1.18 g/cm3 and a highest value of 1.98 t/m3.  There is no apparent evidence of a relationship 

between density and phosphate grade.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

GB Minerals did no density measurements. 

Density value estimates produced by BRGM and Bateman are valid after careful review of the density data.  

GeoImpact used a value of 1.43 t/m3 for the FPA, and 1.50 t/m3 for the FPB in their resource estimation.  It is 

recommended that a more conservative figure of 1.40 t/m3 be used meanwhile for FPA.  In future resource 

estimations , further density measurements should be taken to complete a definitive feasibility study.  With an 

estimated 30% water content, the wet density is 2 t/m3.

SECTION 15 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
Several sets of analysis were performed on the Farim deposit: BRGM in 1981, 1983 & 1985; Sofremine in 

1986; Champion in 1998-99 and GB Minerals in their recent work.  GB Minerals has undertaken its exploration 

campaign as the owner and developer of the Project prior to agreeing a partial sale to the issuer of this report. 

BRGM and Champion cores were stored in the shed of the Ministry of Mines in Bissau. Some time after the 

beginning of the civil war, in 1998, the sheds were bombed and the cores dispersed. 

BRGM paper records and descriptions are detailed and complete. Most of the hole collars are materialised in the 

field with strong concrete beacons and were re-located effectively by GB Minerals geologists. 10% of those 

positions were random checked with GPS by the Qualified Person. 

The Champion paper record gathered so far is not so exhaustive and their drill hole collars were materialised by 

smaller, flat, concrete plugs which were more difficult to relocate in the high grass at the time of the visit of the 

Qualified Person. 

GB holes were also randomly checked as they are still visible but have no concrete plugs. 

The GB cores are in good condition and are properly stored in the Main Office shed in Farim and were 

inspected by the Qualified Person, assisted by Geologist Guy Voglet who was in charge of GB Minerals drilling 

program.  The Qualified Person has verified that no aspect of sample preparation was conducted by any 

employee, officer, director or associate of the Issuer or Vendor. 

15.1 BRGM 

Based on reports, it has been determined that BRGM carried out chemical analyses at the laboratory of the 

DGM (General Directorate of Geology and Mines).  A total of 840 intervals were selected from 101 cores and 

the following analyses were carried out: 

• 840 for P2O5 by colorimetric method 

• 440 for 10 elements 

• 42 analyses for 26 elements were performed in Orleans 

Core samples collected from 60 drill holes of the 1982 - 1983 campaign were analysed in the DGM laboratory 

for the purpose of resource calculation. 

In 1986, check analyses were done at BRGM laboratories in Dakar and Orleans, France on finely ground 

samples prepared by DGM as part of a Prefeasibility Study by Sofremines. 

15.1.1 Sample Preparation Procedures 

Based on reports that were made available from the BRGM documents the following procedure for core 

sampling and sample preparation at the BRGM facilities at that time was:

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• Splitting drill core increments as received along core length.  One half was kept as a reference, the 

other half was split into two parts.  Initial chemical determinations were made on one quarter, 

representing about 2 kg of dry material per metre length, and one quarter was kept as a spare core 

sample; 

• Drying in an oven or natural drying, weighing and stage crushing of quarter core samples down to 

about 8 mm using jaw crushers; 

• Grinding jaw crusher product down to about 0.5 mm to 2 mm using either a roll crusher or a disc 

mill; 

• Splitting -2 mm ground materials using chute splitters with 25 mm and 10 mm channel widths to 

produce two representative sub-samples of 100 g to 150 g which were kept in plastic bags.  The 

remaining material was bagged and kept as a spare sample.  When applicable, basic Gy's equations 

were used to estimate sampling errors made in primary sample splitting.  Typically, drawing a 100 g 

sub-sample of 2 mm top size would give rise to a theoretical sampling error of 0.05 % P2O5 at an 

average P2O5 content of 29%, which is considered negligible.  Regarding the sampling error, the 95 

% confidence limits on grade are 29 % P2O5 ± 0.1 % P2O5; 

• Drying in an oven at 105°C, weighing and milling one of the sub-samples down to 80 µm (100 % 

passing the 80 µm screen, corresponding to about 95 % passing 200 mesh), using a vibrating cup 

mill with tungsten carbide or agate grinding chamber and rings.  The pulverized material was split, 

sub-sampled and spare samples kept in sealed plastic tubes to be dispatched to laboratories in charge 

of analysis and check analysis. 

15.1.2 Assaying and Analytical Procedures 

It was recorded that the BRGM subsidiary, DGM used the following analytical methods: 

• P2O5:  spectrophotometry (No original data or samples were available for review) 

• CaO:  volumetric titration with EDTA 

• SiO2:  either Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) or conventional gravimetric 

determination 

• Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO:  AAS 

• F:  spectrophotometry using Eriochrome Cyanine R as a colour development reagent 

• CO2 from carbonates and phosphate particles:  CO2 volume measurement following 

acid dissolution

Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• Uranium contents of selected finely ground samples were determined by the CEA (Commissariat à 

l'Energie Atomique) in France, highly specialised in U analyses 

At BRGM in Orleans P2O5 contents of samples were determined from solutions obtained after acid dissolution 

with sulphuric and nitric acids, using: 

• A spectrophotometric method based upon the yellow colour of the ammonium phospho-vanado-

molybdate complex 

• A gravimetric method based upon weight of the precipitate of the phosphomolybdate of quinoline, 

(Perrin-Wilson-Dahlgren method)  

Both methods followed analytical procedures given in the French AFNOR standards NF U42-201 and NF U42-

245 relevant to the control of phosphate fertilizers.  Spectrophotometric determinations were validated against 

gravimetric determinations at BRGM since at that time the gravimetric method was the reference method in the 

phosphate fertilizer industry in France. 

Routine analyses for P2O5, CaO, SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, MnO, were made by X-Ray 

Fluorescence (XRF) on glass beads elaborated by fusion with lithium tetraborate as a fluxing reagent.  Loss on 

Ignition (LOI) was also determined. 

15.1.3 Check Analysis for P2O5 and Security of Analytical Data 

Check analyses for P2O5 by spectrophotometry were made by the BRGM laboratories in Dakar and Orleans on 

eleven samples as finely ground powders (-80 µm) and compared with the corresponding determinations at 

DGM.  Results are shown in

Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

Table 18-1 and Figure 15-1 and Figure 15-2.  Since sampling error can be ignored any differences observed can 

be accounted for by analytical errors.  Comparison of results of phosphate analysis provided by laboratories of 

the DGM in Guinea-Bissau, BRGM in Dakar, BRGM in France.  Regression equations indicate a significant 

overestimation, mainly in the low grades, of the P2O5 content by the DGM laboratory compared to the BRGM 

laboratories in Dakar and Orleans: 

• % P2O5 Dakar = 1.0519% P2O5 DGM - 2.28314 

Correlation coefficient, R = 0.9973; mean absolute error SD = 0.759 % P2O5 with 95% confidence limits on 

parameters of 1.0519 ± 0.052 and -2.28314 ± 1.3356. 

• % P2O5 Orleans = 1.03238•% P2O5 DGM - 2.35389 

Correlation coefficient, R = 0.9959; mean absolute error SD = 0.913% P2O5, with 95% confidence limits on 

parameters of 1.03238 ± 0.0626 and -2.35389 ± 1.608. 

It should be noted that the gradients of the regression lines are not significantly different from one.  

Overestimation is almost constant over the controlled interval ranging from 13.4 to 37.60 % P2O5.  However, the 

low number of samples used in these comparisons results in broad confidence intervals on the intercepts with 

the ordinate axis, thereby rendering quantitative assessment less conclusive.

As most of the ore samples have P2O5 contents ranging from 28 to 32 % P2O5, the possible error is acceptable 

since the relative difference in grade does not exceed 4.7 % for a P2O5 content of 30% determined by the DGM 

laboratory. 

Good agreement is observed between determinations provided by BRGM laboratories: 

• % P2O5 Dakar = 1.01513•% P2O5 Orléans + 0.20055 

Correlation coefficient, R = 0.9977, mean absolute error SD = 0.700% P2O5 with 95% confidence limits on 

parameters of 1.01513 ± 0.046 and +0.20055 ± 1.127. 

In synthesis tables per drill core sample, the checking procedure consisted of calculating the sum of 

determinations of oxides comprising P2O5, CaO, SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, F and LOI (loss 

on ignition).  Calculation should return a value close to 100% for dried samples.  This appears to be valid for 

most of the samples since the sum values range between 97.55% (drill core S E-F 6; FPB 45.2 m to 45.6 m) and 

100.40% (drill core SF 10; top of FPA 29.5 m to 30 m).  Most of the samples show sum values within the 98.5 - 

99.5% range.  However, correction for oxygen dosed as part of the total CaO whereas part of Ca is associated to 

F, was not applied before calculating the sum, thereby the calculated sums should be reduced by an amount 

corresponding to (16/(2•19))•F or 0.4211•F expressed in percentage.  This alters slightly the conclusions drawn 

from sum values. 

Since secondary Ca-Al phosphates with high crystallisation water content and lower CaO, CO2 and F contents 

with regard to francolite and fluorapatite were found to occur in the most weathered parts of the deposit, 

coherence and interpretation of analysis should have been assessed in more detail on the basis of simple criteria 

such as CaO/P2O5, F/P2O5, SiO2/Al2O3, CO2/LOI ratio values and Al2O3 contents, even if CaO/P2O5 and F/P2O5 

ratio values were used to identify weathered zones of the deposit. 

It is reported that examination of BRGM analytical data indicates that determinations of F by DGM could be 

under estimated. 

It is reported that BRGM is highly qualified and has much experience in P2O5 analyses.  They were in charge of 

periodic check analysis made of phosphate concentrate exports from the Office Togolais des Phosphates.  They 

performed extensive work to estimate analytical errors made on P2O5, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, H2O and Cl contents 

on ores and concentrates.  Comparisons between many laboratories in France, Togo and Senegal were 

conducted to assess the accuracy and reliability of the BRGM analysis.  As an example, 95% confidence limits 

on a reference sample assaying 37% P2O5 were 37.09% ± 0.15%.  Periodic analyses were also made on 

international phosphate rock reference samples prepared by the CRPG (Research Centre for Petrography and 

Geochemistry) in Nancy, France. 

The Qualified Person is satisfied that the adequacy of the sample preparation, analytical and security procedures 

described and recorded is satisfactory for the time the analysis was undertaken and that the results can be 

accepted to the prevailing international standards.

15.2 Sofremines 

15.2.1 Sampling and Analysis 

Selected drill core samples, as quarters of initial core samples, were taken by Sofremines in December 1985 for 

check analysis and production of a composite sample for beneficiation tests.  As the principal purpose of these 

tests was to validate the BRGM sampling and analyses. 

15.2.2 Check Analysis and Security 

Twenty-one Sofremines samples analysed for P2O5 by XRF on glass pellets are listed in Table 15-2 together 

with comparisons between P2O5 contents in samples as analysed and P2O5 contents calculated on the basis of 

lengths of core intervals and P2O5 contents as determined by DGM in core intervals (weighted averages).  

Statistical treatment of the distribution of differences between P2O5 contents in Sofremines and DGM samples 

results in rejection of two observations (see Figure 15-3).  Differences with DGM results account for both 

sampling and analytical errors. 

Within 95% confidence limits, it can be shown that no significant bias exists for the 19 observations remaining 

even though Figure 15-3 displays scattered data points.  The gradient of the regression line passing through the 

origin is not significantly different from 1.  High dispersion around the regression line, (standard deviation of 

1.90% P2O5), accounts for both analytical and sampling errors.  The latter are expected to be high as a 

consequence of physical reconstitution of core intervals for Sofremines samples and reconstitution of phosphate 

grades of DGM samples by calculation. 

Seven Sofremines samples were analysed for Fe2O3 by XRF on glass pellets and six of them were also analysed 

by wet chemical methods for S as sulphides with the objective to estimate proportions of total iron occurring as 

iron sulphides (FeS2 as pyrite and marcasite in accordance with BRGM mineralogical data).  Data including 

comparisons of Fe2O3 contents in Sofremines samples and Fe2O3 contents calculated from DGM analysis are 

shown in Table 15-3.  From the limited data available, the proportion of iron occurring as sulphides in FPA 

samples assaying 28.85 to 36.2% P2O5 appears to be highly variable, ranging from 43 to 95%. 

Figure 15-4 shows correlation between Fe2O3 contents as analysed in Sofremines samples and Fe2O3 contents as 

calculated from DGM analysis.  As mentioned for phosphate analysis, differences with DGM results account for 

both sampling and analytical errors. 

Similar to comparisons for P2O5, the slope of the regression line passing through the origin is not significantly 

different from one, indicating that significant bias does not exist.  However, too low a number of data points 

give rise to poor accuracy in statistical analysis of the data.

15.3 Champion 

15.3.1 Sampling and Analyses 

The following discussion and observations result only from review of reports.  No original data or samples are 

available for review. 

According to the resource audit by the consultant to Champion Industrial Minerals Inc, (report by J.  Zbeetnoff, 

dated March 18, 2000), drill hole core samples collected during the Champion exploration campaigns were 

analysed for: 

• P2O5 for all sampled intervals and CaO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, F, As and Cl for selected intervals by 

Minerals Resources Associates of Florida (USA) in 1998 

• P2O5 for all sampled intervals and CaO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, F, Cd and TiO2 for select intervals by 

Bateman Projects Limited and by Performance laboratories, (for Al2O3), in RSA in 1999 

15.3.2 Check Analysis and Security 

Internal quality control at Bateman laboratories that undertook testing for Champion consisted of: 

• duplicate analysis on two sets of samples: the first included 45 duplicate analyses covering P2O5 

assays ranging from about 2 to 36%, the second 23 duplicate analyses of P2O5 contents ranging from 

about 28 to 36%.  Correlation coefficients R2 between pairs of determinations were about 1 for the 

first set and 0.998 for the second set.  These high R2 values clearly indicate high repeatability of 

P2O5 determinations at the Bateman laboratory. 

• repeated analysis of two phosphate rock standards assaying 26.7 and 26 % P2O5 obtained from the 

Israel phosphate industry.  Some 41 analyses of the 26.7% standard provided assays ranging from 

about 26 to 26.7% P2O5 with an average value slightly lower than the reference assay.  The 90 

analyses of the 26% standard did not reveal significant bias with regard to the reference assay. 

• repeated analysis of calibration standards assaying 10, 20, 30 and 35% P2O5.  Results of more than 

60 analyses on the 10% standard indicate a slight overestimation (results ranging from about 10.05 

to 10.25% with an average of about 10.15%) whereas no significant bias was detected for the other 

calibration standards. 

It should be noted that original Bateman and Champion reports dealing with analytical data were not made 

available and only review reports were used as sources of information.  This explains incomplete data 

mentioned in the present report, particularly the absence of confidence limits on the gradients and intercepts of 

the regression equations used to relate results of initial and check analysis.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

15.3.3 Check Analysis for P₂O₅ 

Check analyses on 17 composite samples were undertaken at Setpoint Laboratories using a gravimetric method.  

The linear regression equation that expresses the relationship between Setpoint and Bateman determinations was 

found to be: 

• % P2O5 Setpoint = 0.9044•% P2O5 Bateman + 2.87 

Correlation Coefficient, R= 0.9743. 

Bateman laboratory provides slightly higher grades when compared with Setpoint Laboratories for P2O5 

contents less than about 30% and slightly higher grades for P2O5 contents exceeding 30%.  As most of the Farim 

samples have P2O5 contents in the 28 to 32% range, possible analytical errors are not expected to strongly alter 

estimations of ore grade and resources. 

15.3.4 Check Analysis for Al2O 

Alumina contents were determined by AAS on solutions from standard acid attack at Performance Laboratories.  

Check analyses were performed by Setpoint Laboratories using ICP spectrometry (Inductively Coupled Plasma) 

on 47 samples.  The relationship between the 47 couples of alumina determinations is given by the following 

regression equation: 

• % Al2O3 Setpoint = 1.077•% Al2O3 Performance + 0.02 

Correlation Coefficient, R= 0.9963. 

Alumina contents obtained by Performance Laboratories using AAS are slightly lower alumina contents 

determined by ICP at Setpoint Laboratories.  For Al2O3 contents lower than 5%, corresponding to most of the 

francolite-containing ores encountered in the deposit, the difference in grade given by the two methods is 

acceptable - 8.1 % relative difference for a 5% Al2O3 content determined by the method used by Performance 

Laboratories.  The AAS method used at Performance laboratories is recommended by the Association of Florida 

Phosphate Chemists, an organization specialized in chemical characterization of phosphate substances.  For this 

reason, results from AAS determinations should be preferred. 

15.3.5 Check Analysis for Fe2O3 

Bateman used titration with dichromate to determine total Fe as Fe2O3 in solutions from modified acid attack of 

phosphate samples, a method recommended by the Association of Florida Phosphate Chemists.  Check analyses 

were carried out at Setpoint Laboratories on 121 samples using ICP spectrometry on solutions from standard 

acid attack.  Results given by the two methods are related by the following regression equation: 

• Fe2O3 Setpoint = 1.1841% Fe2O3 Bateman + 0.66 

Correlation Coefficient, R= 0.9807. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 68 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

It appears that Bateman Laboratories provide lower Fe2O3 contents in comparison to Setpoint Laboratories.  The 

relative difference in grade reaches 22.8% for a Fe2O3 content of 15% determined by the method adopted by 

Bateman.  As the latter method is recommended by the Association of Florida Phosphate Chemists, it can be 

considered as the reference method for Fe2O3 analysis within the appraisal of the deposit. 

The Qualified Person is satisfied that the adequacy of the sample preparation, analytical and security procedures 

described and recorded is satisfactory for the time the analysis was undertaken and that the results can be 

accepted to the prevailing international standards. 

15.4 GB Minerals 

15.4.1 Sampling and Analyses 

 GB Minerals attempted to setup an on-site lab but this was never implemented fully.  After some trials to assay 

locally by calorimetry, the idea was abandoned.  This local procedure did not appear, in any way, on the 

database figures. 

15.4.2 Sample Preparation Procedures 

The procedure in use for core sampling and sample preparation was similar to the one used previously by 

BRGM: 

• splitting drill core increments as received along the core length.  One half is kept as a reference, 

the other half used for spare core sample and initial chemical determinations

SECTION 18 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Chemical characterization of Farim phosphate ore samples was conducted under the supervision and 

responsibility of BRGM, Bateman The Mineral Corporation, and GEEEM.  These are reputable organizations 

with wide experience in mineral exploration, particularly in the exploration and evaluation of sedimentary 

phosphate deposits.  

Considering the regularity of the orebody, it is believed that the collection of samples for ore characterization 

was sufficiently representative to support a scoping study. 

Metallurgical testwork has been conducted in phases and reported at various times.  Each of these reports is 

summarised and discussed below.  The main sources of testwork information are contained in five Appendices, 

which formed part of a report issued by Sofremines in December 1986. 

18.1 Testwork Result Summary 

18.1.1 Appendix 1 (Sofremines, December 1986) 

This report, issued in 1981, lists the phosphate content (as P2O5) of 21 assay samples.  The values ranged from 

8.05 to 34.7% P2O5, with the weighted average being 31.36% P2O5.  There are also a limited amount of assay 

figures for Fe2O3, S
2-, CaO, Al2O3 and cadmium. 

18.1.2 Appendix 2 (Sofremines, December 1986) 

This report covers investigations carried out by Compagnie Sénégalaise des Phosphates de Taïba (CSPT) in 

1983.  In this test series, a sample of ore, which had been screened and deslimed to obtain a particle size range -

800µm +50µm was subjected to attrition in a laboratory Wemco cell.  After attrition the coarse size fraction (-

800µm +50µm) was found to represent 78.41% of the feed mass, with the assays of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 being 

32.45%, 4.02% and 0.33% respectively.  This coarse fraction contained 77% of the phosphate in the feed sample 

along with 80.3% of the Fe2O3 and 46.9% of the.  Al2O3.  The size fraction +50 µm -40µm was found to 

represent 1.19% of the feed mass, with the assays of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 being 33.11%, 8.25% and 0.47% 

respectively.  This fraction contained 1.2% of the phosphate in the feed sample along with 2.5% of the Fe2O3 
and 1.0% of the Al2O3.  The minus 40µm fine fraction assayed 35.22% P2O5, 3.3% Fe2O3 and 1.42% Al2O3.  

Thus, by subjecting the sample to attrition, it was possible to discard 52.1% of the Al2O3 and 17.2% of the Fe2O3 
to the slime fraction but a loss of 21.8% of the P2O5 was incurred. 

After combining the fractions left after desliming (-800µm, +40µm), a product assaying 32.32% P2O5, 46.27% 

CaO, 4.00% Fe2O3 and 0.30% Al2O3 was obtained.  The low ratio CaO/P2O5 of 1.43 is advantageous as the 

sulphuric acid consumption in producing phosphoric acid or superphosphate will be low. 

All iron species in the sample were reported in terms of Fe2O3 but this ore contains pyrite, which is not a 

deleterious substance.  It was found that pyritic iron amounted to 1.3% (equivalent to 1.86% Fe2O3); thus the 

non-pyritic iron amounted to 2.14% (4.00% minus 1.86%).

The specific gravity of the attrited material was 3.21.  When this material was subjected to heavy media testing, 

the 2.72 to 3.31 specific gravity float material assayed 37.15% P2O5, 1.66% Fe2O3 and 0.32% Al2O3.  The 

recoveries of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in this fraction amounted to 95.4%, 34.3% and 88.5% respectively.  When 

this float material was subjected to dry high intensity magnetic separation a non-magnetic fraction assaying 

37.55% P2O5, and 0.81% Fe2O3 was obtained (the Al2O3 figure was not reported).  This non-magnetic fraction 

contained 87% of the P2O5 and 15.1% of the Fe2O3. 

Thus, at least on the laboratory scale, it was possible to obtain an excellent product assaying 37.55% P2O5, 

0.81% Fe2O3 and about 0.3% Al2O3 by a process of attrition, heavy media separation and magnetic separation at 

a phosphate recovery of 68%. 

The -800µm +40µm fraction from the attrition test was subjected to flotation testing.  Given the limited amount 

of feed material, only four tests were conducted.  The best result that from test 4 produced a final concentrate 

assaying 36.88% P2O5, 2.41% Fe2O3 and 1.66% SiO2 with a phosphate recovery of 86.6%.  The tailings from the 

six cleaner floats were not recycled and therefore a commercial operation could be expected to yield a slightly 

higher recovery but with a slightly lower grade of concentrate. 

When the flotation concentrate from test 4 was subjected to dry high intensity magnetic separation a non-

magnetic fraction assaying 37.45% P2O5 and 1.23% Fe2O3 was obtained at a phosphate recovery of 88.3%.  

With the exception of the Fe2O3 assay, which is slightly higher, these results are very similar to these obtained 

by use of heavy media separation and magnetic separation. 

This report also gives results from a magnetic separation test conducted in 1983 on a concentrate produced by 

floating non-attrited material.  In this test a non-magnetic fraction assaying 37.12% P2O5 and 0.75% Fe2O3 was 

obtained with 95.4% of the P2O5  and 24.8% of the Fe2O3 reporting to the non-magnetic fraction.  The size 

fraction of the feed was slightly different (-800µm +50µm instead of -800µm +40µm) and, without the details of 

the flotation results, the overall recovery cannot be quantified for comparison with the procedure employing the 

attrition step but it is almost certainly significantly higher, indicating that attrition with attendant phosphate 

losses should be avoided.  However, it would seem that flotation reagent consumption is much higher if attrition 

is not employed. 

Tests were conducted on the flotation concentrate to estimate the amount of the phosphate that would dissolve 

naturally if applied directly to the soil.  Using the official method of the EEC a formic acid solubility of 30% 

was obtained.  This value is relatively low but not as low as some other producers. 

18.1.3 Appendix 3 (Sofremines, December 1986) 

This document summarises the results of tests conducted in the second quarter of 1986 in Orleans by Bureau de 

Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM).  A 10 kg sample of ore was crushed to minus 10 mm and treated 

in a scrubber to release the slimes.  The resultant slurry was wet screened at 1 mm, 250 µm and 50 µm.  There 

was a small amount of +1 mm material representing 1.5% of the feed weight and containing 0.99% of the 

phosphate but was iron rich, assaying 24.74% Fe2O3 from a feed grade of 4.87% Fe2O3.  The size fraction -1.0 

mm +50 µm assayed 33.46% P2O5, 4.2% Fe2O3 and 0.7% Al2O3.  This material represented 62.7% of the feed

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

mass and contained 66.5% of the P2O5, 53.77% of the Fe2O3 and 29.22% of Al2O3.  Thus, by subjecting the 

sample to attrition, screening out the +1 mm material and desliming at 50 microns, it was possible to discard 

70.78% of the Al2O3 and 46.23% of the Fe2O3 to the coarse and slime fractions but a loss of 34.5% of the P2O5 

was incurred, again showing the potential for product loss by the use of an attrition/scrubbing procedure.  The 

loss of P2O5 can be reduced to 15.81% by desliming at 10µm but the product would be poorer with assays of 

32.70% P2O5, 5.30% Fe2O3 and 0.91% Al2O3. 

The fractions -1.0 mm +250µm, -250µm +50µm and -50µm +10µm were treated separately by wet high 

intensity magnetic separation.  Combining the products from the treatment of the two coarser size fractions 

produced a non-magnetic material assaying 34.49% P2O5, 2.81% Fe2O3 and 0.69% Al2O3.  The recoveries of 

P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were 99.3%, 64.96% and 96.23%.  In the case of -50�m +10µm size fraction, magnetic 

separation produced a non-magnetic material assaying 33.91% P2O5, 2.36% Fe2O3 and 1.43% Al2O3.  The 

recoveries of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were 93.9%, 28.22% and 84.3%.  Thus, the overall recovery of phosphate 

by scrubbing, screening, desliming at 10 μm and wet magnetic separation would seem to be 65.0% (65.49 x 

99.23/100) plus 17.5% (18.69 x 93.9/100), totalling 82.5%.  Similarly, the total recoveries of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 
would seem to be 43.2% and 45.23%.  The concentrate produced from this procedure would assay 34.4% P2O5, 

2.71% Fe2O3 and 0.85% Al2O3.  The mass of the concentrate, in terms of feed mass, would seem to be 60.8% 

(62.70 x 96.99/100) plus 16.5% (19.23 x 85.96/100), giving a total mass recovery of 77.3%. 

The -1.0mm +250µm and the -250µm +50µm size fractions were separately subjected to another attrition step 

and the minus 50µm fraction removed before being treated by flotation.  In the case of the -1.0mm +250µm 

material, the best of the flotation tests produced a final concentrate assaying 35.6% P2O5, 2.45% Fe2O3 and 

0.79% Al2O3.  The recoveries of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were 93.17%, 72.42% and 82.7%.  In the case of the -

250µm +50µm material the best of the flotation tests produced a final concentrate assaying 36.0% P2O5, 2.30% 

Fe2O3 and 0.64% Al2O3.  The recoveries of P2O5, Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were 91.79%, 79.52% and 74.87%.  There 

was insufficient sample to optimise the flotation procedure and the cleaner tailings were not recycled in these 

tests.  Thus, in commercial operation, slightly higher recoveries with perhaps slightly lower grades would be 

expected.  Based on these results and on overall material balance it is estimated that, by use of a procedure 

employing scrubbing, magnetic separation, flotation of the +50 μm non-magnetic, the overall mass and 

phosphate recoveries would be about 53% and about 60% respectively into a concentrate assaying about 36% 

P2O5. 

The -50µm non-magnetic fraction was not treated by flotation but it could potentially provide a lower grade 

product.  It represented 16.5% of the feed mass and 17.7% of the phosphate contained in feed and assayed 

33.91% P2O5, 2.36% Fe2O3 and 1.43% Al2O3. 

The two flotation concentrates were combined in proportion to the weights arising in the tests and full chemical 

analysis was performed on the resultant product.  The results are reproduced in

The concentrate was also found to contain 70 ppm uranium and 10 ppm cadmium. 

Of the contained iron, 43% was present as pyrite which reported to the gypsum precipitate when the concentrate 

was treated with sulphuric acid (see Appendix 5) and thus should not be considered detrimental.  The remaining 

iron in oxides amounted to 0.87% (as Fe, equivalent to 1.24% Fe2O3); thus the undesirable Fe2O3 amounted to 

1.24% instead of 2.18% and the FeAl content was therefore 2.07%. 

The settling rate of the primary slimes produced in this test series was measured to provide design data. 

18.1.4 Appendix 4 (Sofremines, December 1986) 

This testwork was conducted by BRGM on a sample produced by combining flotation concentrate remaining 

from the testwork conducted at various laboratories.  The combined sample weighed about 7 kg and with assays 

calculated from testwork of 35.85% P2O5, 2.5% Fe2O3, 0.40% Al2O3 and 2.4% SiO2. 

The test comprised of three passes of material through a dry high intensity magnetic separator.  The first and 

second passes were performed with a magnetic field density corresponding to 4 Amps; a field density of 9 Amps 

was employed for the final pass.  The non-magnetic and middlings from the first pass formed the feed for the 

second pass with the magnetic fraction being removed.  The magnetic fraction and middlings produced in the 

second pass were removed and the non-magnetics sent forward for the third pass.  The magnetic fraction and 

middlings produced in the third pass were removed, with the non-magnetic being the final product. 

The third pass non-magnetic assayed 36.9% P2O5, 0.66% Fe2O3, 0.39% Al2O3 and 2.5% SiO2 giving a FeAl 

content of 1.05%.  In terms of the flotation concentrate, the mass recovery was 88.0% with the P2O5, Fe2O3, 

Al2O3 and SiO2 recoveries being 90.6%, 23.5%, 85.2% and 90.5% respectively.  With a two pass procedure the 

mass recovery would be 95.4% with the P2O5, Fe2O3, Al2O3 and SiO2 recoveries being 97.6%, 40.9%, 93.7% and 

90.5% respectively.  The calculated assays for the two pass product were 36.70% P2O5, 1.06% Fe2O3, 0.40% 

Al2O3 and 2.44% SiO2 giving a FeAl content of 1.46%. 

Thus, use of the three stage process did little to reduce the Al2O3 and SiO2 contents but reduced the Fe2O3 

content from 2.5% to 0.66% and increased the P2O5 content by 1.05% from 35.85% to 36.9%.  This was, 

however, achieved at cost of 9.4% phosphate recovery points.  In the case of the two stage process, again Al2O3 
and SiO2 contents were largely unchanged but the Fe2O3 content was reduced from 2.5% to 1.06% and the P2O5 

content was increased by 0.85% from 35.85% to 36.7%.  The effect of the two pass process on phosphate 

recovery was less severe in comparison with that of the three pass process, amounting to 2.4% instead of 9.4%. 

A full chemical analysis was conducted on the non-magnetic fraction obtained after three passes of separation.  

The results are shown in Table 18-2.

In addition, the final product was found to contain 219 ppm uranium, 8 ppm cadmium and <5 ppm arsenic. 

Again, if correction is made for pyritic iron, the oxide iron content is 0.20% Fe2O3 and the FeAl content is 0.6%. 

18.1.5 Appendix 5 (Sofremines, December 1986) 

Products from tests employing the dry high intensity magnetic separator (see Appendix 4) were combined to 

obtain a material for treatment with sulphuric acid to yield phosphoric acid, the precursor in fertiliser 

production.  This material assayed 36.9% P2O5 with a FeAl content of <2.0%. 

The material was ground to a particle size of 45% finer than 80µm.  The ground material was contacted with 

acid for 4.75 hours at a temperature of 80°C.  Observations from the test are: 

• 97.9% of the phosphate dissolved, 1.25% formed crystals and 0.85% was unattacked 

• Washing efficiency was 98.8% 

• Filtration rate was 315 kg P2O5/h/m2 

• Sulphuric acid consumption was 2.32 t/t P2O5 or 2.39 t/t P2O5 in the acid 

• Characteristics of gypsum crystals: length 170-540 µm with a length/width ratio of 6 to 10 

• Fluoride Distribution: 75% to gypsum and 25% to acid product 

• Redox potential was 225 mV; corrosion of Uranus B6 steel is 0.16 mm/annum 

• Foam Production: 60 to 85% 

The phosphoric acid product characteristics are shown in Table 18-3.

The yield from acid attack is excellent.  The filtration rate of 315 kg P2O5/h/m
2 is a good average as equivalent 

figures for concentrates from Khouribga and Taiba are 250 kg and 450 kg P2O5/h/m
2 respectively with 

concentrates from Jordan typically showing rates of 250 to 350 kg P2O5/h/m
2.  The low sulphuric acid 

consumption, at 2.39 t/t P2O5 in the acid, is a very positive feature.  This is lower than fore mentioned operations 

where acid consumption is 2.78, 2.47 and 2.8 t/t P2O5 from Khouribga, Taiba and the Jordan operations 

respectively.  The pyrite present is not dissolved by the acid (no hydrogen sulphide evolution was detected) but 

is eliminated with gypsum.  Solubility of fluoride is low, the silica showing little reactivity.  The organic carbon 

content is relatively high and causes significant foaming.  The use of a foam depressant may be necessary, 

which will probably improve filterability and washing yields. 

The test was conducted on very small scale but showed the characteristics of Farim concentrate to be favourable 

for the production of phosphoric acid. 

18.2 Testwork Findings 

Sofremines were of the opinion that the sequential process of removing coarse and then fine particles, removing 

quartz by flotation and then removing iron and aluminium oxides ("FeAl") by DHIMS was relatively easy and 

produced a phosphate product that had a good ability to produce phosphoric acid and therefore fertilizer. 

Further testwork was recommended with the objectives of: 

• defining more precisely the relationship between the mode and intensity of cleaning grains before 

flotation and the flotation performance, specifically concentrate grade (to target 80% TCP) and 

reagent consumption 

• determining whether the lower cut-off size for flotation should be reduced below 50µm through 

further mineralogical study 

• determining the potential for recovery of phosphate from the 1-2 mm or 1-5 mm fractions through 

magnetic separation 

• further testing of high intensity or high gradient magnetic separation to ascertain whether the 

WHIMS/flotation results could be improved to match those of the flotation/DHIMS system as this 

would simplify the flowsheet and reduce costs 

• further flotation testing to investigate whether iron removal in flotation could be improved, 

possibly through the use of starch-based products, which could potentially obviate the need for 

magnetic separation 

• pilot testing of washing and flotation 

GEEEM's view is that a "standard" product can be produced by sizing and magnetic separation alone and that 

flotation is only required should a "premium" (high phosphate grade) product be required.  They have therefore 

not conducted any flotation testwork. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 80

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

Obtaining a high grade product with a P2O5 content of 36-37% by use of flotation will incur higher capital and 

operating costs, a lower recovery of phosphate and will require a higher mining rate to achieve a given amount 

of final product and GEEEM contend that any additional revenue obtained by the production of high grade 

product will not compensate for the additional costs.  GEEEM point out that the market is less demanding in 

terms of P2O5 content than previously; the Moroccan standard is 70% BPL (bone phosphate of lime) equivalent 

to 32% P2O5 with the standard for Florida being lower. 

GEEEM's contention that screening, desliming and magnetic separation is the best processing option is 

supported by Fertecon Research Centre who conducted a Study for Champion Resources in 1998.  The Fertecon 

Report states, "Our past studies on relative values and prices for phosphate rock products suggest that the higher 

grade (35%-38%) rock products have very rarely achieved a price differential as large as would be derived from 

theoretical calculations.  The reasons for this are many but, combined with higher production costs and lower 

recovery, the suggestion is that an average grade (32%) rock product would be overall a better option for Farim 

than a high grade rock product." 

18.3 Mineral Processing 

The proposed beneficiation process has been derived from GEEEM's understanding of the local geology, the 

mining method and the testwork described above.  The required product has been defined from typical 

phosphoric acid producer feed specifications and the response of the ore to beneficiation processes. 

Wet mining by dredges will generate slurry that is delivered to buffer storage ponds prior to delivery into the 

Feed Preparation section of the plant.  Oversized material (+1 mm) will be washed in scrubbers and removed by 

screening and fines (-50μm) will be removed by classification in hydrocyclones.  Hydraulic classifiers will 

produce two streams (-1,000 +200 μm and -200 +50 μm) to be subjected to wet high intensity magnetic 

separation (WHIMS).  After removal of ultrafines (-10 μm) the fine stream (10 - 50μm) will be subjected to wet 

high gradient magnetic separation (WHGMS). 

The three streams of magnetic products will be thickened and deposited in a tailings facility, as will the -10µm 

slimes, both potentially being co-deposited with the +1 mm rejects. 

The three non-magnetic streams will be final product.  The concentrate will be transported to the port at Chugue 

by pumping.  In order to control the particle size distribution and slurry density at the optimal values for 

pumping the concentrate will be milled and thickened prior to pumping through an overland pipeline.  On 

discharge at the port the concentrate slurry will be filtered and dried to approximately 8% moisture.  The dried 

product will be stockpiled prior to loading onto ships. 

Where possible, thickener overflows at the mine site recycled to the head of the process.  Water removed from 

the concentrate slurry at the port site will be cleaned sufficiently to be discharged into the Geba River. 

The circuit described above has not been tested exactly as described.  However, from the results of the testwork 

performed to date it may be deduced that a phosphate product containing approximately 32.7% P2O5, 2.7% 

Fe2O3, 0.9% Al2O3 and 3.6% SiO2 can be made.

It is the QP's opinion that the samples selected by BRGM for the characterization of ores and metallurgical 

testing were adequate in size and locations, to support a scoping study. 

Further work will require large diameter drilling.

19.1 Introduction 

The Farim Project consists of one continuous phosphate bed which extends over a known surface area of 

approximately 40 km2 (Figure 19-1).  A three dimensional digital model has been produced of the phosphate 

(P2O5%) mineralization with a cut off of a minimum of 1.5 m thickness and contemplated several stripping 

ratios.  The model was created using Surpac 6.2 software.

19.2 Data Provided 

19.2.1 Drillhole Data 

The Mineral Resource Estimate is based on diamond drillhole data and consisted of: 

• BRGM 1981: 2,100 metres from thirty two diamond drill holes were completed on a 25 km2 grid.  

Complete and detailed logs, assay analysis, and other data are available, but core and samples were 

not available for inspection; 

• BRGM 1983: 3,572 metres from a further 101 diamond drill holes were completed by BRGM on a 

25 km2 grid.  Complete and detailed logs, assay analysis, and other data are available, but core and 

samples were not available for inspection; and 

• Champion 1999: 1,810 metres from thirty four infill diamond drillholes on a 38 km2 grid.  Assay 

data is available but detailed logs, drill core and samples were not available for inspection. However 

the upper and lower position of the phosphate bed is recorded.   

Details of historical drilling are described in Section 13.1.  A digital database compiled by GEEEM was 

supplied by GB Minerals which contained the collar position as an XYZ co-ordinate, the total length of each 

hole, the hole orientation, the upper and lower position of the FPA and FPB phosphate beds and assay data .. 

The sources of the data have been reviewed through validation checks against the digital data as detailed in 

Sections 15 and 16.  Observations from the site visit and data validation procedures completed indicate that the 

data used in the estimate follows industry standard practices for their drilling and QAQC program and the 

compiled drillhole database used in the estimation is sufficiently free of errors to be used in the October 2010 

Mineral Resource update. 

19.2.2 Other data 

A digital terrain model (DTM) was produced from ACE2 data (corrected SRTM) in conjunction with the collar 

data.  The topographic map is shown in Figure 19-2.  A density database was used which contained 68 bulk 

density determinations as described in Section 14.2.

19.3 Geological Wireframe Modelling 

The FPA phosphate bed was modelled in Surpac and Discover softwares, based on the drill hole database 

geological logs.  Almost all of the drilling intercepted the FPA layer.  Figure 19-2 shows a location plan of the 

existing drilling used in the geological model showing the density of drilling coverage over the resource area.

A surface wireframe was created at the top and bottom of the FPA and FPB beds.  The definition of the FPA and 

FPB beds can be found in Section 11.  The FPA bed is almost horizontal with a maximum slope between two 

holes at 500 m distance of 2%.  The elevation of the surface of the FPA bed varies between 22 m and 35 m 

within the resource area. 

Figure 19-4 shows the modelled phosphate beds and illustrates the location, level of continuity and relative 

thickness of the phosphate beds.  The morphology of the FPA bed is flat, continuous and regular.  Waste areas 

are currently unknown within the extent of the bed within the modelled resource limits.  The FPB bed underlies 

the FPA bed and commences in the eastern part of the deposit. 

The general regional faulting direction is NE-SW, but no faults were modelled within the resource limits. 

 

Figure 19-4 Modelled extent of the FPA and FPB Phosphate Beds 

Figure 19-5, Figure 19-6 and Figure 19-7 shows isopach contours of the FPA, FPB and overburden layers 

respectively (looking at those profiles and surface topography, a small fault NW/SE is suggested along the axis 

Trabato-Canico; this hypothesis should be pursued in further studies). 

The FPA is the most continuous bed and thickens towards the centre of the deposit.  The thickness varies from 

less than 1 m at the edges of the resource area, up to 6.2 m in the centre, with an average of approximately 4 m.  

Also note that the thickness of the FPA bed seems to increase again in the north west of the resource in an area 

which is still undrilled.  Phosphate grades are also generally higher in the centre than in the border. 

The FPB underlies the FPA bed in the eastern part of the deposit.  The FPB bed varies in thickness from 1.5 m 

to 20 m, with a mean thickness of 5.3 m at about 13% P205) 

The overburden is thickest in the north of the deposit, due mainly to the higher elevation of the surface.  It varies 

from 28 m to 53 m with an average of approximately 39 m

The deposit is divided into a "North Zone" and a "South Zone" (Figure 11-1), and this has been considered in 

the estimation.

19.4.1 Raw Assay Data 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) uses statistical tools to help understand the data and provide information to 

separate the data into domains where appropriate.  .Although 133 drill holes exist with assay data, a number 

have very poor recovery figures and therefore only holes with recoveries above 30% were used.  124 holes on 

an approximate 500 by 500 m grid, and which intersected the FPA bed were used for the estimation of tonnage 

and grades.  The summary statistics are shown in Table 19-1.

Assays P2O5% 

Minimum Value  0.000 

Maximum Value  35.4 

Mean  27.6 

Variance  36.8 

Standard Deviation  6.07 

  

19.4.2 Compositing 

It was observed that the BRGM samples were not taken at a regular interval leading to samples of different 

sizes.  This can present problems during estimation as the samples do not have the same statistical support and 

may be biased by their differing sizes.  To overcome this problem the drill hole data was composited by 

calculating one length weighted average grade of the mineralised interval of each drill hole to represent the FPA 

layer as a whole. 

19.4.3 Density 

Dry density determinations were made by BRGM and Champion and are described in detail in Section 14.2.  

The density values estimations produced by BRGM and Bateman are assumed to be valid after careful review of 

the density data.  A value of 1.40 t/m3 for the FPA, and 1.50 t/m3 for the FPB was used in the current resource 

estimation.  . 

19.5 Variography 

Variography is a procedure which is used to model the continuity of spatial phenomena such as the distribution 

of grade in an ore body.  These models are then used to predict the variance between samples at two different 

points throughout the ore body. 

Experimental grade variograms were calculated for FPA thickness, P2O5, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and CaO.  The 

objectives of the variography were to establish the directions of major grade continuity and to provide

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

variogram model parameters that describe the spatial variability of the data for use in geostatistical grade 

interpolation. 

A single chemical value of each of the modelled variables corresponds to the drill hole intersection of the 

deposit (as described in Section 19.4.2), therefore the beds were treated as two dimensional isotropic features.  

Interactive fitting of models to the experimental variograms was carried out in Surpac.  Variogram modelling 

assumed the best fit using an omni-directional model.  This is considered appropriate for this type of relatively 

continuous and flat lying deposit morphology.  The experimental and modelled variograms are shown in Figure 

19-8 to Figure 19-12.

Figure 19-12 Variogram of CaO% 

The nugget effect is a measure of variability at very short distances and is calculated using closely spaced data.  

It is shown in the modelled variograms (Figure 17-17 to 17-21) as the gamma (�) value at zero distance.  The 

nugget of P2O5 and Fe2O3 are relatively high, therefore they are the most variable at short distances.  The nugget 

of FPA thickness and Al2O3 are average, whereas the nugget of CaO is low. 

To better understand the nugget effect GB Minerals undertook a cross pattern drilling program with different 

spacing.  This data confirms that the thickness data is relatively stable while the P205 content is practically 

random (within close bounds). The variability translates the high energy of the shore environment with bars, 

channels and crossed-bedding. Miners should expect short wave variability in their planning. 

The range of the modelled variogram defines the distance beyond which two points have no correlation.  The 

estimation should not correlate samples beyond this distance.  The range of the P2O5, Al2O3, and Fe2O3, 

variables at Farim is approximately 1,750 m; CaO has a range of approximately 2,175 m.  The range of the FPA 

thickness varies between 1,130 m to 3,210 m. 

This variographic study shows that the deposit has good continuity over distance of the chemical variables.  

More closely spaced drilling is needed to accurately define the spatial variability of P2O5. 

The variogram parameters are shown in Table 19-2.

19.6 Block Model Definition 

A three dimensional block model was constructed in Discover software with a block size of 100 m x 100 m.  

The model has an EW orientation.  The FPB layer was not included in the block model because it was 

considered that there is not enough data to accurately model it. 

To be included in the estimation block model, the phosphate layer had to be of a minimum thickness of 1.5 m 

for the FPA.  A second limitation of a stripping ratio cut-off of 20 to 1 (i.e. FPA layer with an overburden 

thickness more than 20 times the thickness of the phosphate bed) was applied to the blocks. 

Figure 19-13 shows contours of the extents of the FPA bed with thickness above 1.5 m and stripping ratios 

<20 m.

Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

19.7 Estimation Methodology 

Grades for P2O5, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and CaO, and the thickness of the FPA layer were estimated using inverse 

distance weighting to the power of two (IDW2).  The following variables were also calculated in the block 

model: 

• CaO% / P2O5% 

• (Al2O3% + Fe2O3%) / P2O5% 

• Al2O3% + Fe2O3% 

The only grade restrictions applied are a minimum value of 1.5 m for the thickness of the phosphate layer and 

the stripping ratio below 20. There is no need to cut-off the grade as 

a) grade is very regular (as indicated in par.19.4.1) 

b) due to 40 m overburden, it would not be possible to avoid stripping poorer pockets with lower grades, 

unless of sensible size.   

19.8 Block Model Validation 

A validation of the block model was conducted by comparing the estimated grades to the raw drilling data; it 

was found that they matched well. 

19.9 Resource Classification 

The classification of the Mineral Resource was completed in conformance with the standard industry practice 

for sedimentary phosphate deposits.  The Mineral Resource was classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred 

Resources based on distances of influence around the drill holes. 

Measured Resources are defined as areas of the deposit which are within a range of influence of 0 m to 500 m 

from the nearest drill holes, Indicated Resources are from 500 m to 1000 m from the nearest drill holes, and 

Inferred Resources are from 1000 m to 2000 m from the nearest drill holes. 

Blocks in the outer periphery of the drilled area, which were having high O/B ratios, were downgraded to 

"inferred" even if they were close to existing boreholes:  

a) they were "extrapolated" rather  than "interpolated";  

b) the "reasonable prospect" for their economic extraction was less evident.  The large grid values 

generally adopted for the phosphate deposits evaluation are supported by the large ranges of the 

variograms (almost 2 km)

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The classification practices used in this report are considered to be in conformance with the CIM Mineral 

Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in National Instrument (NI) 43-101, Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

19.10 The 2008 Farim Mineral Resource Estimate 

The results of the estimation are described below.  FPA thickness is shown in Figure 19-14. 

Figure 19-14 Results of the Estimation – FPA Thickness 

Figure 19-15 displays grade of P2O5 in the block model in 2% intervals from <26% to >34%.  It shows a regular 

distribution of high grade P2O5 and that the high grade extends to the north and the west which is currently not 

explored.  Higher P2O5 values tend to correspond with lower overburden ratios.  The results of the contaminant 

grades: Al2O3, Fe2O3, and CaO, are shown in Figure 26-1,Figure 26-2 and Figure 26-3 below.

Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

 
Figure 19-15 Results of the Estimation - P2O5% content 

Figure 19-16 shows the modelled spatial distribution of the CaO/P2O5 ratio.  The average value is approximately 

1.4%.  Lower values tend to correspond with lower stripping ratios and higher P2O5 values in the western area of 

the deposit. 

Figure 19-16 Ratio of CaO / P2O5% 

Figure 19-17 shows the modelled spatial distribution of (Fe2O3 + Al2O3) / P2O5.  The average is 0.25 and varies 

between <0.2 to >0.45.  Low values correspond with low stripping ratios and high P2O5% in the western area of 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 98

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

the deposit.  Although a ratio of 0.25 is considered high, results of processing tests (described in Section 16) 

show that this can be reduced to less than 0.1% by high gradient magnetic separation and to 0.05 by adding 

flotation.  In this case, the resultant P2O5 will be increased to 36%. 

The figures show that the resources are limited mainly by the level of the stripping ratio.  The P2O5% grades of 

the deposit is consistently between 28 and 34% which is considered by GEEEM to be above a cut off grade 

which has a reasonable and realistic prospect of eventual economic extraction.  The CaO / P2O5 ratio, which 

governs the acid consumption in the fertiliser process, is favourable. 

Figure 19-17 Ratio (Fe2O3 / Al2O3) / P2O5 
Figure 19-18 shows the modelled resource coloured by the stripping ratio (overburden / FPA bed thickness).  It 

shows the deposit can be divided into two distinct zones with a ration below 40, a South Zone and a North Zone.  

The zones are separated by a corridor of approximately 500 m, where phosphate exists but has an uneconomic 

strip ratio.  The zones are linked by a narrow corridor with a stripping ratio of less than 20.  It also shows that 

the stripping ratio increases quickly away from the centre of the deposit.

must be noted that Inferred Mineral Resources are not Ore Reserves, as they have not demonstrated economic 

viability.

19.11 Issues that could affect Mineral Resources 

A simplified mine plan and schedule has been applied to Mineral Resources to assess the mineable portion of 

the deposit.  The following was considered: 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 100 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• The mineable portion was based on adopting a stripping ratio on the Measured and Indicated 

Resource of less than 15 retaining phosphate thickness over one metre 

• Mineral Resources located south of the River are considered to be currently inaccessible to the 

mining equipment considered in the PEA, and has a lower drilling density than north of the river, 

and therefore have been discounted from the figures. 

• An estimated dilution factor of 10% and ore loss of a further 10% from the top of the FPA (at a 

grade of 15% P2O5) and bottom of the FPB layer was considered.  It was assumed that 100% of the 

phosphate zone will be mineable and will be transported to the process plant. 

Using these considerations approximately 68 million tonnes of the Measured and Indicated Resource was 

defined as mineable at a grade of 29.9% P2O5.  It must be noted that this figure is hand calculated, does not 

constitute an Ore Reserve and therefore does not have economic viability. 

The mining schedule showed that the resources may be able to sustain production of 2 million tonnes per year 

for 25 years.  It is recommended that a more detailed schedule be undertaken which would consider the 

possibility of selectively mining interbed waste during the mining process and exploiting the deposit with a 

greater stripping ratio. 

No major environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant 

issues risk is currently known which could affect the estimated mineral resources. 

19.12 Summary and Recommendations 

The compiled drilling data base used in the resource estimate is considered reliable for the purpose of the 

estimation of mineral resources in accordance with the JORC criteria.  The approach to the development of the 

resource block model follows accepted industry standards. 

It is recommended that an update of the Mineral Resource be undertaken which include additional infill drilling, 

in order to increase the confidence in the resource.  The divergence between the new holes results for the 

"variogram drilling" and the old hole should be investigated further. (Section 12.3)  About ten additional 

duplicate samples should be collected and assayed from the last GB Minerals drill campaign. 

It is recommended that a more thorough and systematic program of density determination be carried out and that 

an updated density be used to convert volume into tonnes for the next resource estimate, also on the last GB 

Minerals holes. 

It is recommended that an accurate topographical survey be conducted in order to have greater confidence in the 

stripping ratio of the ore; all the holes should be relocated. 

Additional metallurgical and engineering studies are needed to better constrain the portion of the reported 

resource that have a reasonable prospect for economic extraction, including calcination tests on FPB for 

calculation of the economical mineability in the form of a feasibility study

SECTION 20 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
Not Applicable, see Section 25 for additional Project development information. 

SECTION 21 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The Preliminary Economic Assessment that has been carried out through this technical report has completed its 

original objectives and has successfully shown that the Farim Project is robust at the selected long term 

phosphate rock prices and it is recommends that the Project continues to be advanced. 

The Farim Project currently comprises a large tonnage of 84 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated 

Resources, high grade (29.9% P2O5) phosphate deposit consisting of one continuous flat lying phosphate bed 

that is proposed to be exploited by a combination of shallow open pit mining operations and high productivity 

dredging followed by simple beneficiation methods.  The economic analysis contained in this report is based, in 

part, on Measured and Indicated Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  There is no certainty that the reserves 

development, production and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is based will be 

realized. 

The resource estimate is sensitive to the Stripping ratio.  The Stripping ratio has been optimised to a limited 

extent but additional analysis is required to define the optimum Stripping Ratio for the Project.  In total, 68 

million tonnes of Measured and Indicated resources of phosphate ore have been defined for a. Life of Mine Plan 

at a rate of 2.76 million tonnes per year for a period of 25 years.  Using assumed long term phosphate rock 

prices of US$ 100 per tonne, the Project Base Case has an undiscounted pre-tax cash flow of US$ 69,610 

million per annum.  The pre-tax Net Present value of the Project at a 10 % discount rate is US$ 254 million, and 

simple payback occurs after approximately 4 years of operation. 

The Project is most sensitive to phosphate rock prices, operating costs and recovery.  Phosphate rock price 

projections lie within the range of recent phosphate rock price history.  Recovery is a function of plant feed and 

plant efficiency.  Optimisations of the mining plan and improving plant efficiencies will improve the recoveries 

and in turn the Project economics. 

The current model uses a life of mine plan grade.  No attempt has been made to optimise grade in the early years 

of the Project.  The economics of the Project can be enhanced by optimising grade during the early years of the 

operations 

The current financial model assumes the mining of only 68 million tonnes or 81% of the current Indicated and 

Measured Resources of 84 million tonnes.  There may be potential to improve the Project economics by 

increasing the production rate and life of the Project. 

Assumptions have been made regarding location of the beneficiation plant and the tailings area, because the 

final sites have not been selected yet.  In the further stages of study of the Project, there is considerable scope for 

refining and optimisation of the capital and working costs. 

The Project has been granted a Mining Lease License and a Production License by the Guinea-Bissau 

Government.  This is valuable to optimising the timetable for development and production.

SECTION 22 RECOMMENDATIONS 
It is recommended that the Project proceeds towards the Feasibility Stage.  A summary program and budget of 

$3.96 million is presented in Table 22-1.  Specific recommendations in each area follow: 

22.1 Resources 

Drilling on the Farim Phosphate Project should concentrate on step out exploration, in-fill drilling and large 

diameter core drilling necessary for collecting bulk metallurgical samples and to optimise the mining plan. 

The drill program should be designed to upgrade the currently defined resource estimates, define areas of higher 

grade which can be used to further optimise grade in the early years of production and increase the resource base 

through step out drilling. 

An accurate topographical study should be conducted over the mining license area. 

The P205 variable has a high nugget effect. For the purpose of a more robust evaluation, the evaluators should 

use the "accumulation" (grade times thickness) concept as a basis for the statistical studies. The parameter 

variations are damped by the geometrical regularity, it is also corresponding in some way to the geological 

reality whereby phosphates clasts and ooliths were "raining" continuously over the ocean floor for an extended 

period. However there was a complex environment superposed to it: a shore facies and a probable emersion of 

the FPA. The "accumulation" parameter could be rapidly convertible to USD per M2. 

22.2 Mining 

The feasibility and mine planning for a dredge mining operation combined with shallow open pit overburden 

mining should be undertaken to define the optimum mining method, stripping ratios and recovered grades.  

Selective mining of interbedded waste should be examined. 

Geotechnical studies are needed to establish manageable slope angles in the unconsolidated overburden and 

define appropriate ground control requirements. 

22.3 Metallurgy 

Additional metallurgical work is required to optimise, refine and validate the data and proposed flowsheet used 

in the Preliminary Assessment.  Samples of the products from the various stages of the flow sheet should be 

collected and dispatched to potential customers for the phosphate rock products. 

22.4 Environment 

Options for tailings disposal should be examined in greater detail.  The water balance arising from the proposed 

dredge mining operations should be incorporated in the overall environmental plans for the Project.  A final 

environmental impact study needs to be prepared to incorporate the operating parameters defined in the 

feasibility study.

SECTION 25 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIE 

25.1 Introduction 

The Preliminary Assessment for the Farim Phosphate Project encompasses the general process flow: 

• Annual ore production rate of 2,780,000 tonnes or 7,885 tonnes per day. 

• Removal of overburden by a combination of shallow open pit mining and overburden dredging 

followed by dredging and pumping phosphate ore slurry to the beneficiation plant. 

• Phosphate ore slurry will be delivered to buffer storage ponds prior to delivery into the feed 

preparation section of the beneficiation plant.  Oversized material (+1 mm) will be washed in 

scrubbers and removed by screening and fines (-50�m) will be removed by classification in 

hydrocyclones.  Hydraulic classifiers will produce two streams (-1,000 +200�m and -200 +50�m) 

to be subjected to wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHGMS).  After removal of ultrafines (-

10�m) the fine stream (10 - 50�m) will be subjected to wet high gradient magnetic separation 

(WHGMS). 

• The three streams of magnetic products will be thickened and deposited in a tailings facility, as 

will the -10 mm slimes, both potentially being co-deposited with the +1 mm rejects..  This tailings 

disposal facility will be located within 3 km2 of the process site. 

• The three non-magnetic streams will be the final phosphate rock concentrate product containing 

32.5% P2O5 and 3.5% Fe + Al. 

• The concentrate will be transported to the port at Pointe Chugue by pumping.  In order to control 

the particle size distribution and slurry density at the optimal values for pumping the concentrate will 

be milled and thickened prior to pumping through an overland pipeline. 

• Recovery by the beneficiation process is 72.5% by weight and 79.6% of P2O5 content. 

• Resulting phosphate rock concentrate is pumped by a slurry pipeline to the port facility 

approximately 80 km2 away. 

• On discharge at the port the concentrate slurry will be filtered and dried to approximately 8% 

moisture.  The dried product will be stockpiled prior to loading onto ships. 

• Storage of up to 40,000 tonnes of phosphate rock concentrate takes place in a warehouse next to 

the port.  It is then loaded into a ship by conveyor belt.  The maximum loading capacity by conveyor 

is 2,000 tonnes per hour.  A ship of around 35,000 tonnes can be loaded in 24 hours.

Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The economic analysis contained in this report is based on Measured and Indicated Resources and is preliminary 

in nature. The inferred resources listed above in Table 19-3 indicate further potential but should not be 

considered in the economic reasoning, in accordance with 43-101 provisions. There is no certainty that the 

reserves development, production and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is based will 

be realized. 

25.2 Mining Operations 

25.2.1 Introduction 

One of the proposed directors of Resource Hunter, Paul C. Jones P. Eng, visited the phosphate mining 

operations of the Wingate Creek Mine, Manatee County, Florida, operated by Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC.  The 

mining methods adopted at the Winggate Creek Mine are similar to those proposed for the Farim Phosphate 

Project.  The QP has reviewed this mining approach which is detailed below. 

The geometry of the phosphate deposit can be described as a flat lying tabular block ranging in thickness from 

1.5 m to over 6 m with an average thickness of 4 m.  The phosphate deposit covers an area of 40 km2, roughly 8 

km in length by 5 km in width and lies from 28 m to 53 m below surface averaging approximately 38 m. 

25.2.2 Mining method  

Based on the  geometry, unconsolidated overburden and an average moisture content of 30%  indicate that that 

this deposit should probably be mined using a combination of conventional shallow open pit methods for the 

first 7 to 10 m depth above the water table followed by the use of an overburden stripping dredge and a 

phosphate mining production dredge.  This proposed mining method would also allow for progressive 

rehabilitation to occur as mining proceeds. 

The conventional shallow open pit mining will simply involve the removal of the topsoil and upper dry 

unconsolidated clayey sand layers from the areas being mined, with this then placed in stockpiles adjacent to the 

mining areas.  Backfilling using this material will occur later when the mine area is mined out and the phosphate 

ore is extracted. 

The dredge mining process will involve the removal of the wetter unconsolidated sandy clayey material using an 

overburden dredge followed by the removal of the phosphate ore using a production dredge.  This will be 

carried out in progressive strips.  After the initial strip or cut has been mined, the unconsolidated sandy clayey 

material for subsequent strips will be placed in the void created from the first strip.  This technique will enable 

areas to be progressively rehabilitated once mining has advanced to the next strip.  Contouring of the replaced 

unconsolidated sandy clayey material will occur ahead of topsoil placement and revegetation. 

Typically, the strip mining process will commence with the removal of topsoil and dry material above the water 

table for all areas to be disturbed for the mining strip.  A slot will be opened from the initial box cut that is 

excavated in each mining strip and then the overburden dredge will be "floated" in the enlarged slot, water from 

the River Cacheu will be pumped into the enlarged slot and then the slot will then be extended the full width of

the stripped.  Overburden dredging operations will then progress the entire length of the mining strip in a series 

of 7 m benches until the phosphate is reached about at about 33 m below the water table. 

Once the top of the phosphate layer has been exposed by the overburden dredge, the production dredge will be 

floated in a lot that has been excavated in the phosphate layer.  Phosphate ore will then be excavated and 

pumped to the treatment plant. 

25.2.3 Geotechnical 

The phosphate ore has only been observed in diamond drill core and the unconsolidated overburden and topsoil 

has been examined in a box cut and shaft excavated by GB Minerals.  It is anticipated that ground conditions 

will be manageable in both the phosphate ore layer and the overlying unconsolidated clayey sand layers, 

allowing the assumption that mining could be carried out using conventional shallow open pit and dredge 

mining methods.  Drill core examined indicates that the phosphate ore is soft and amenable to dredge mining.  

Similarly the observation of the unconsolidated overburden indicates that this material would generally be 

amenable to dredging. 

The application of dredge mining and the design of the dredge mining layout, mining lifts, water balance, 

production rates etc will have to be studied and developed further including geotechnical investigations at 

feasibility stage. 

25.2.4 Dilution and Extraction 

For this study a 10% dilution factor and ore loss factor of 10% was used to account for: 

• waste will be mined by the production dredge because these are undulating surfaces and, 

• inter layer bands of sand / clay and other calcareous material that could occur within the phosphate 

layer. 

It is anticipated that the dredge operators will achieve sufficient levels of operating skills that the dilution will be 

minimized 

A thorough geotechnical review, including modelling of the proposed mine design, strip mining layout and 

mining sequence, will need to be completed as part of preparing feasibility level development and production 

schedules. 

25.2.5 Life of Mine Plan 

The Life of Mine Plan schedule is based on a production rate of 2,760,000 tonnes per annum.  A 25-year mine 

life has been selected for evaluation.  The evaluation is based on mining Measured and Indicated Resources.  

Mine life could potentially be extended by successful infill drilling and exploration to the northwest and north 

east and increasing the stripping ratio.

25.2.6 Mining Equipment 

The selection of mining equipment for the Farim Phosphate project is based on the philosophy of using the best 

available and proven technology adapted for the available operating skills and maintenance support that would 

be available on a sustainable basis in Guinea-Bissau.  An initial larger complement of expatriate personnel is 

planned for the early years of the operation. 

25.3 Mineral Processing 

The proposed beneficiation process has been derived from the local geology, the mining method and the 

testwork to date.  The required product has been defined from typical phosphoric acid producer feed 

specifications and the response of the ore to beneficiation processes. 

Wet mining by dredges will generate slurry that is delivered to buffer storage ponds prior to delivery into the 

Feed Preparation section of the plant.  Oversized material (+1 mm) will be washed in scrubbers and removed by 

screening and fines (-50 μm) will be removed by classification in hydrocyclones.  Hydraulic classifiers will 

produce two streams (-1,000 +200 μm and -200 +50 μm) to be subjected to wet high intensity magnetic 

separation (WHIMS).  After removal of ultrafines (-10 μm) the fine stream (10 - 50 μm) will be subjected to wet 

high gradient magnetic separation (WHGMS). 

The three streams of magnetic products will be thickened and deposited in a tailings facility, as will the -10 mm 

slimes, both potentially being co-deposited with the +1 mm rejects. 

The three non-magnetic streams will be final product.  The concentrate will be transported to the port at Chugue 

by pumping.  In order to control the particle size distribution and slurry density at the optimal values for 

pumping the concentrate will be milled and thickened prior to pumping through an overland pipeline.  On 

discharge at the port the concentrate slurry will be filtered and dried to approximately 8% moisture.  The dried 

product will be stockpiled prior to loading onto ships. 

Where possible, thickener overflows at the mine site recycled to the head of the process.  Water removed from 

the concentrate slurry at the port site will be cleaned sufficiently to be discharged into the Geba River. 

The circuit described above has not been tested exactly as described.  However, from the results of the testwork 

performed to date it may be deduced that a phosphate product containing approximately 32.7% P2O5, 2.7% 

Fe2O3, 0.9% Al2O3 and 3.6% SiO2 can be made. 

25.4 Materials Handling 

A basic assumption of this study is that the beneficiation plant is located near a suitable tailings site, within 3 km 

of the mine.  The material handling system between the mine and the beneficiation plant comprises the 

following: 

• a slurry pipeline to move phosphate ore from the production dredge to a storage area located close 

to the beneficiation plant and, 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 121 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• a storage area at the beneficiation site in addition to emergency sump areas for long term dump 

storage. 

25.5 Tailing Management 

No tailings site has been selected for the Project.  The cost for a tailings disposal facility was based on generic 

assumptions and conditions in the Project area.  Infrastructure costs at the beneficiation plant site include an 

allowance for piping for tailings and reclaim water. 

A tailings disposal facility will require capacity for approximately 25% of the total tonnage to be ultimately 

treated (68-80 million tonnes).  The disposal area will be based on a suitable high lying level site can be located 

for the construction of a suitable impoundment to contain the tailings.  It is also assumed that the mining pits 

would also support the placement of tailings as part of the reclamation process.  This is similar to the practise at 

the Wingate Creek operations in Florida, USA. 

25.6 Environmental and Permitting Considerations 

In Guinea-Bissau, the Secretary of State's Office for the Environment is responsible for environmental policy.  

It encompasses an Environmental Department, which has three branches: 

• The Service for Urban Environment 

• The Service for the Management of Natural Resources 

• The Service for Protected Areas 

The management of forests and fauna comes under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 

Hunting.  This Ministry has two branches: 

• The Service for Forest Development and Exploitation  

• The Service for Managing Fauna. 

In 2005, the Environmental Impact Evaluation Unit (CAIA), whose brief is to advise the Prime Minister on 

environmental issues, was established.  Its areas of competence cover the following: 

• To support the implementation of an environmental impact evaluation procedure. 

• To ensure, in collaboration with the relevant institutions, the monitoring of environmental impact 

mitigation measures. 

• To ensure environmental evaluation processes are complied with and to advice on environmental 

studies and reports. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 122 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

• To instruct and take into account the technical advice of the Authorities responsible for the 

environment. 

The Guinea-Bissau Act, ratified by the Council of Ministers on the 19 March 2008, has not yet been 

promulgated.  However, it may be considered that its application will be confirmed.  The GBM phosphate 

mining project would be classed in category A, subject to an in-depth environmental impact study in order to 

evaluate the repercussions of the mining activities on the natural and human environments and to take them on 

board so as to make allowances for them in the planning and implementation of the project.  Moreover, the 

Environmental Act of Guinea-Bissau and its implementing order require the mining company to carry out an 

Environmental Evaluation Study (EES) prior to the Environmental and Social Impact Study (EIES). 

25.6.1 Environmental Evaluation Study (EES) 

In collaboration with the Authorities responsible for environmental studies, it has been agreed to carry out the 

study in two stages.  Firstly, a strategic EES, considered as an environmental pre-feasibility study, followed by 

an EIES, which must be handed over at the same time as the detailed engineering studies.  In fact, Guinea-

Bissau legislation requires the submission of a detailed impact study prior to the start of works for the project. 

The approach adopted in this EES is based on: 

• The consideration of international conventions ratified by the country. 

• The environmental guidelines set out in UEMOA's mining policy. 

• Compliance with the legislative and regulatory requirements of Guinea-Bissau in terms of 
environmental evaluation. 

• The orientations provided by the policies and guidelines of the World Bank. 

The fundamental objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of the project on the biophysical, human and 

socio-economic environment and to propose the measures that need to be put in place to optimise the positive 

impacts and to avoid, mitigate or compensate the negative impacts. 

GB Minerals entrusted this EES to the consultancy firm "Tropical Environmental Consultants" which is based 

in Dakar, Senegal and has a very good reputation and level of expertise. 

The report comprises: 

•  A description of the key aspects of the project, according to three criteria: 

− The rationale for the project: the site has been chosen for its considerable mining potential, 

since the width of the productive layer is on average 4 m with an annual production of several 

million tonnes of phosphate.  The project will stimulate the national and local economy 

through the creation of skilled jobs and the improvement of local services, with the objective 

of a harmonious co-existence between the neighbouring populations and the mining company. 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 123 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

− The mining technique and method: the selected technique is extraction by dredging, an 

efficient and competitive method of mining.  This technique is favourable in terms of 

nuisances and safety and avoids transport by heavy machinery.  The stripped waste rock will 

be re-used for backfilling the pits as the mining operations advance and the ground will be 

restored.  The ore processing method, essentially employing only physical processes, does not 

envisage the use of hazardous substances that could present any risks of toxicity, even at low 

dose. 

− Transport and dispatch to the seaway: dispatch will be via the Rio Guéba, by slurry pipeline 

transport between the stock of concentrate in Farim and the harbour site of Pointe Chugé 

where the product will be loaded on ships.  Road transport will be used to transport both 

personnel and goods and thereby open up the Farim region to outside influences. 

• A detailed inventory of the site must be carried out to identify the biophysical, socio-economic and 

cultural conditions with a view to determining the potential presence of resources that have a 

particular value and which could be significantly affected by the implementation of the project. 

• The identification of such significant potential effects, proposals for measures to mitigate or 

compensate the main negative impacts, as well as measures to optimise the positive effects. 

•  The identification and the characterisation of the principal risks, as well as the strategic provisions 

that need to be put in place to reduce any risks with high hazard potential.  This study must be 

completed by a hazards study, which will make it possible to define, from the safety viewpoint, the 

risks and strategic measures that need to be taken into consideration and developed. 

25.6.2 Environmental and Social Impact Study (EIES) 

As soon as the project has been defined in detail, and before its implementation, an Environmental and Social 

Impact Study (EIES) must be completed, covering the three key aspects of the project: mining extraction, 

processing and transport.  Particular importance must be paid to the social and economic issues at stake. 

This EIES for the mining project must be carried out in accordance with the requirements definition and terms 

of reference that have been defined by the CAIA. 

The principal tasks to be carried out are as follows: 

Task 1:  Description and rationale of the project; the study will cover the following points: 

•  Defining the scope of the study and its contents. 

•  A description of the project, including a precise and complete description of its key aspects and 
phases. 

Task 2:  Analysis of the political, legislative, regulatory and institutional context 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 124 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

Task 3:  Description of the initial state of the environment 

• The study must clearly demarcate the area affected by the project, with an inventory focusing on: 

o The physical aspects 

o The biological aspects: the fauna, flora and particularly fragile areas 

o The human aspects 

o The socio-economic and cultural aspects 

Task 4:  Presentation and analysis of project variants 

• The study will identify possible variants to the basic solution and will analyse them in terms of 
advantages and disadvantages. 

Task 5:  Identification and analysis of the anticipated impacts on the environment 

• The study must identify all of the various impacts (positive, negative, short term, long term, direct 
or indirect, reversible and irreversible, etc.) that are likely to be created by the activities of the 
project on the environment. 

• This study will also include a hazard analysis and risk assessment and will describe the probability 
of any accidents and failings linked to the project occurring.  In particular, it will explain the way in 
which these events have been detected and their possible consequences.  It must identify the 
capacities, the resources and the equipment made available to prevent or to react to such 
occurrences. 

Task 6: Environmental and social management plan: 

•  As regards the natural environment, the study must propose a restructuring plan suited to the area, 
both during and at the end of the mining operations: 

• Progressive backfilling of the excavation with waste rock 

• Rehabilitation of the spreading areas and storage basins 

• Restoration of farmed areas 

• Planting of trees in the cleared areas, with the original species 

As regards the social and welfare aspects, the study must show the provisions taken to enable local populations 

to get involved in the implementation of project activities, so as to minimise any social risks, and to propose a 

strategy to limit health risks. 

Finally, an environmental surveillance and monitoring programme must be drawn up.  Its aim will be to verify 

the accuracy of the impacts and to check compliance with the measures proposed in the impact study and the 

commitments undertaken by the mining company. 

Before starting mining activities, other authorisations will need to be obtained from the relevant Ministries and 

Authorities:

• Authorisation to clear and cut down trees, from the Ministry of Agriculture, which sets the 
compensation provisions. 

• Building permit. 

• Authorisation for storing fuel. 

25.7 Hydrology 

25.7.1 Hydrogeology 

The hydrogeological conditions of the Farim deposit have been determined from measurements, modelling and 

simulations carried out by BRGM in 1983 and 1986 and measurements conducted in 2009-2010 by GB 

Minerals to check the previous measurements in an area close to the Rio, in both the dry season and the wet 

season. 

The sandy clay formations of the overburden, the phosphate-bearing layer and the underlying micritic 

limestones all contain groundwater.  The water content of the phosphate layer and the overburden is between 25 

and 30%. 

The overburden comprises alternating fine sands and clays in the form of lenticular deposits, without lateral 

continuity.  This geological configuration results in a complex and heterogeneous multi-strata type aquifer 

system.  In detail, the following aquifers may be distinguished: 

• An upper aquifer in the sandy clay overburden formations and the FPA phosphate-bearing layer. 

• A lower aquifer, which corresponds to the micritic limestones. 

These two aquifers, separated locally by the FPB layer which is considered as semi-permeable, contain the 

same, single body of free groundwater. 

25.7.2 Hydrostatic level 

The hydrostatic level is situated a few metres below ground level.  It lies at elevation +2 m near to the Rio 

Cacheu and at around +5 m at a distance of 3.5 km to the north of the river.  This gives a slight hydraulic 

gradient of the order of 1/1000.  The hydrostatic level of the groundwater appears to be in equilibrium with that 

of the river. 

25.7.3 Hydrodynamic Parameters of the Aquifer 

BRGM and Champion carried out several pumping tests to determine the characteristics of the aquifer.  The 

BRGM measurements taken at the end of the dry season and those of GB Minerals are in agreement, not just as 

regards the transmissivity (Kh between 2 and 2.5 x 10
-4 m2/sec), but also the drainage ratio (Ce between 0.4 and 

1 x 10-4). 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 126 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

The groundwater reacts in a homogeneous manner despite the heterogeneity of the geological formations: the 

drawdown cone spreads widely, reaching 350 m after one day of pumping.  The results are identical in the dry 

season and in the wet season: at the same pumping rate, the groundwater drawdown is identical. 

25.7.4 Drawdown of the Aquifer 

The study was performed using a variable square mesh hydrodynamic model.  The limits of the model were 

defined by taking into account the geomorphological context (course of the Rio), the location of the 

measurement points and the position of the future mining sites.  The study was a permanent flow study. 

In the hypothesis of open cast mining, the simulation was carried out in an area close to the Rio to a depth down 

to 35 m, as would be the case in open cast mining.  The drawdown of the groundwater for a 300 m x 1000 m pit 

area would be obtained with a series of boreholes spaced at 100 m around the pit area, i.e. about 30 to 35 

boreholes.  The flow rate would be around 700 to 800 m3/hour, ranging between 150 and 1,100 m3/h depending 

on the values assigned to the various parameters.  The drawdown of the groundwater would need to begin more 

than 6 months before the start of mining operations. 

Nevertheless, although open cast mining may theoretically be feasible, the chosen mining method may be 

dredging, as it could be the most economically viable method in the Farim context where the presence of an 

abundant aquifer becomes an advantage. 

25.8 Capital and Operating Cost Estimates 

The capital and operating costs are based on estimates by IMC and GBM to support the results of scoping 

studies, preliminary engineering and design work that has been undertaken as part of this study. 

The pre-production capital cost of US$ 288.13 million, including a contingency, covers the construction and 

development work to bring the Project into production, including pre-stripping, mine development to a 

sustainable production level, construction and infrastructure related to the beneficiation plant and installation of 

services to support the Project.  The estimate includes the estimated costs for the slurry pipeline from the 

beneficiation plant to the sea port located at Chugue a distance of 80 km and includes all associated storage, 

dewatering and loading installations at the port site. 

The estimate includes direct costs of equipment, materials and labour, as well as indirect costs such as EPCM, 

temporary construction services, owner's costs and contingencies.  Costs for advancing the Project to 

construction stage, such as resource upgrade drilling, project financing, land acquisition, permitting, 

environmental studies and feasibility studies are included.

25.9 Markets and Phosphate Product Prices 

The economic analysis contained in this report is based, in part, on Measured and Indicated Resources, and is 

preliminary in nature.  There is no certainty that the reserves development, production and economic forecasts 

on which this Preliminary Assessment is based will be realized. 

25.9.1 Uses of Phosphate Rock 

Phosphate rock is mainly used in the production of fertilisers.  In 2009, the manufacture of wet-process 

phosphoric acid for fertilisers and animal feed supplements was estimated to have accounted for more than 95% 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 130 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

of US mineral phosphate rock consumption and approximately 90% on the world market.  Approximately 45% 

of the wet-process phosphoric acid produced in the US was exported in the form of upgraded granular 

diammonium and monoammonium phosphate fertilizer and merchant-grade phosphoric acid.  Other uses of 

phosphate rock include the production of phosphorus compounds for use in a range of food-additive and 

industrial applications. 

25.9.2 Substitutes 

There is no substitute within agriculture for phosphorus.  Phosphate fertilisers stimulate root development, 

promote flowering and help prevent diseases and environmental stress.  Fertilisers applied to correct deficiencies 

in soils are typically chemically manufactured materials containing compounds of phosphate that are readily 

soluble in water. 

25.9.3 Ores and Geographic Location of World Reserves 

The largest reserves in the world can be found in Morocco and the Western Sahara, China, South Africa, the 

United States and the Middle East, (USGS 2010 survey; Jasinski 2010).  These deposits are sedimentary 

deposits of biological origin, formed on continental shelves and obtained much of their phosphorous content 

from animal bones.  Sedimentary deposits are the source of about 80% of phosphate production.  There are also 

large reserves of phosphate rock which currently are not economically viable or technologically obtainable due 

to the phosphate grade and/or deposit location. 

25.9.4 Major Producing Countries 

Looking at 2009 mine production throughout the world, (USGS 2010 survey; Jasinski 2010), phosphate rock 

production is dominated by three major areas in the world.  China, USA, Morocco and Western Sahara represent 

70% of the world's total phosphate rock production. 

25.9.5 Historical Prices 

Within the phosphate industry, no standard domestic or world price for phosphate rock exists as prices are 

tendered or negotiated under contract.  There are a few publications and industry trade journals in which ranges 

of world prices are published from a selection of industry transactions and other sources of information.  The 

values presented in Figure 25-1 come from historical USGS publications and represent the historical US price of 

phosphate for the period of 1990 to 2009.  During the period mentioned, phosphate rock traded between 

US$30/tonne and US$79/tonne in constant dollars (2009).  Integrated domestic producers are responsible for the 

majority of the phosphate rock and phosphoric acid production; therefore many of these historical prices 

represent the internal transfer price for integrated domestic producers in the US. 

In line with other commodity prices, there has been a considerable movement in the reported phosphate rock 

price in the last 5 years.  The average price increased from US$31.80/tonne in 2006 to US$78.40/tonne in 2008 

before rationalising back down to US$51.00/tonne in 2009 (USGS 2010).  Price shifts of this extent are typically 



Preliminary Economic Assessment Final Report  Page 131 
Guinea Bissau 
 
 

 
 
Resource Hunter Capital Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 43-101GB Final Technical Report  February 2011 

not the result of a single factor but rather the combination of a number of demand-pull and supply-push 

developments.  This particular price shift was due to an overall increase in the cost of production of phosphate 

rock driven heavily by the rising cost of energy, tighter supply of phosphate rock, high freight rates, a large 

increase in the sulphuric acid price and a weaker dollar.  At the same time the demand for fertiliser products 

increased. 

Morocco's average price for exported phosphate rock had been constant through to 2007 to no more than US$51 

per metric ton before the large rally which peaked in 2008 at over US$400 per metric ton.  Since November 

2009, contract prices have stabilised to a more attractive and sustainable level with Morocco contract price for 

phosphate rock at US$110 per ton FOB.

25.9.6 Current and Future Demand 

Global demand for food, feed, fibre and bio-energy is expected to remain strong and expand in the future as 

further pressure is put on agriculture from an increasing world population and governmental policy.  Plantations 

of bio fuels are expected to increase world fertiliser consumption above and beyond historical forecasts.  It is 

forecasted that Europe alone would have to produce 20 million tonnes of bio fuel equivalent oil by 2010 to meet 

the guidelines of European Union directives.  Overall this equates to an increase of five times that of current 

output.  Consumption of maize for bio ethanol in the US has increased from just over 10 million tonnes per year 

in 2000 to almost 50 million tonnes in 2006 again showing the trend for increased utilisation of bio fuels and the 

requirement to increase agricultural yields.  If this trend and government incentives continue, farmers will need 

to replace their traditional crops, look for new arable land or boost current yield. 

Over the last five years there has been extra demand for all phosphate based fertilisers in regions that have 

historically used limited amounts.  The regions of Asia and Africa represent not only the developing markets for 

phosphate based fertiliser but also a shift within these countries towards economically sustainable and world 

competitive agriculture.  As the agricultural industries develop within these countries it not only bodes well for 

world food production but it also signals the development and increased demand for fertiliser within these 

regions. 

 Short term demand forces impacting phosphate and fertiliser prices include: Grain prices and current 

inventories, economic conditions, current crop yields achieved, crop mix which effects current supply, planting 

intentions which effects future supply, fertilizer inventories, shipping and exchange rates, dumping, feedstock 

cost and weather extremes.  Medium term demand forces impacting phosphate and fertiliser prices include:

Economic conditions, current tax and government policies, capacity utilization rate changes, shrinking 

agricultural land base, irrigation improvements, energy price changes, farmer income and intention of swing 

producers.  It is important to note that most phosphate rock mining companies are vertically integrated with one 

or more fertilizer plants that are usually located near the mine. 

25.9.7 Long-term Price Assumptions 

There are many differing views on the expected future price for raw phosphate rock.  Some consider that the 

recent increase in prices is due to temporary market shocks and that no further "insight" should be drawn from 

this period in regards to fundamental long term price trends or changes in supply and demand.  On the other side 

of this argument, demand drivers such as the ever increasing demand for bio-fuels supported by government 

incentives may lead to higher demand for phosphate based fertilisers in the future. 

25.9.8 Phosphate Pricing and Marketing 

Although phosphate rock price is reliant on competitive tendering and short term contractual agreements, GBM 

advises that letters of intent should be sourced from potential customers to confirm obtainable price and reduce 

risk from any further volatility from the fertiliser market.  The long term price for phosphate rock is highly 

debated and forecasting is highly specialised, however for the purpose of this project a price per tonne for 

phosphate rock concentrate US$ 100 FOB Pointe Chugue (UBS Nov 2009) is adopted. 

25.9.9 Sales Contracts 

The Project is at pre-feasibility stage where it is considered too early in the developments to have any specific 

sales contracts or letters of intent in place. 

25.10 Economic Analysis 

25.10.1 Taxes 

The Guinea-Bissau Government will exempt GB Minerals from the payment of any taxes from the start of 

commercial operations for a period of 10 years.  The 2% royalty is tax deductible. 

An annual fee of approximately Euros 233,000 is payable to the Guinea Bissau Government to retain the Mining 

Lease License. 

25.10.2 Analysis 

A pre-tax Cash Flow Projection has been generated for a 25 year mine life, capital and operating costs have 

been estimated and are summarized in Table 25-7  The projection represents 100% of Project output.  A 

summary of key criteria is provided below.

A 10% discount rate has been used for the base case evaluation.  The economic analysis contained in this report 

is based, in part, on Measured and Indicated Resources, and is preliminary in nature.  There is no certainty that 

the reserves development, production and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is based 

will be realized. 

25.10.5 Sensitivity Analysis 

Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks were examined 

by running cash flow sensitivities for:

• Phosphate rock price 

• Operating cost 

• Capital costs 

• Metallurgical recovery 

Pre-tax NPV sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for -20% to +20% variations.  The sensitivities 

are shown in Figure 25-3 and table 25-10.  The Project is most sensitive to phosphate rock prices and recovery.  

Phosphate rock price variations examined above within the range of recent price history.   

Recovery is a function of plant feed and plant efficiency.  Optimisation of the mining plan and improving plant 

efficiencies will improve the recoveries and in turn the Project economics.
