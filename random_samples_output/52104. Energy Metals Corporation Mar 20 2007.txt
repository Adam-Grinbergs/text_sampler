SECTION 3  SUMMARY 
 
The following report was prepared by BRS, Inc. a Professional Engineering and Natural 
Resource Corporation duly licensed in the State of Wyoming, USA.  The report addresses 
the geology, uranium mineralization and in-place mineral resources of the mineral 
holdings for Energy Metals Corporation's (EMC) Velvet Mine Uranium Project.  The 
portion of the project addressed specifically in this report is located in Section 2, 
Township 31 South, Range 25 East at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 
109o 09' West (refer to Figure 1, Velvet Mine Uranium Project Location Map).  Section 2 
is a State of Utah lease of approximately 488 acres.  Adjacent mineral properties 
controlled by EMC include unpatented claims located in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 of 
T31S, R25E and Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E (refer to Figure 2, Drill Hole and Claim 
Map).  In total these mineral holdings comprise approximately 1,600 acres. 
 
This report is a summary of mineral resources.  Mineral resources are not mineral 
reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The Section 2 portion of the 
Velvet Mine Uranium Project was extensively explored during the 1970's with the 
principal exploratory work and drilling completed by Atlas Minerals with additional 
drilling completed by Minerals Recovery Corporation (MRC).  The drilling was 
completed adjacent to Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine which was mined in Section 3 up to 
the property line with EMC's current mineral holdings in Section 2.  Atlas and MRC 
conducted extensive drilling on the lands currently held by EMC including the 
delineation of 4 mineralized areas with drilling on a rough grid approximating 100' 
centers.  The available data includes radiometric data from some 173 drill holes 
completed on the property.  The data utilized as the basis of this evaluation and in the 
preparation of this report was acquired by EMC from Dean Stucker, a mining engineer 
formerly employed by MRC. 
 
Uranium mineral resources within and in the vicinity of the project are found in the upper 
Permian Cutler Formation.  Many of the other mines in the Lisbon Valley or Big Indian 
Wash District were located in the basal Moss Back member of the Triassic Age Chinle 
Formation overlying the Cutler Formation.  The Lisbon Valley or Big Indian Wash 
District produced 5 times as much uranium as any other district in Utah from the period 
of 1948 through 1988 totaling 77,913,378 pounds U308 at an average grade of 0.30 % 
U308 (Chenowith, 1990). 
 
Within the district there is an erosional unconformity between the Permian and Triassic 
aged beds where the Triassic Moenkopi formation was eroded away before the placement 
of the Moss Back Member of the Chinle Formation.  Most of the orebodies in the Cutler 
occur within six feet of the unconformity.  The deposits appear to be located in channel 
deposits and troughs in the paleotopography, but no pattern or common orientation is 
evident. Cutler host rocks consist of alternating beds and lenses of light pink, orange, and 
buff mudstone, calcareous siltstone, and arkosic sandstone.  The sandstone beds are well 
sorted, are fine to medium grained, and are as much as 50 feet thick.  The sandstone is 
comprised of quartz, feldspar, and biotite, with clay as the predominant binder, but 
locally calcite may be in the cement.  Uraninite is the principal uranium mineral, with 



 

5 

small amounts of coffinite.  In addition, vanadium in the forms of montroseite, doloresite, 
and vanadium clay and/or hydromica was an important by product of the Atlas Minerals' 
Velvet Mine, adjacent to the current property.  The Velvet Mine operated by Atlas 
Minerals on Section 3 produced approximately 400,000 tons of ore at grades of 0.46 
%U3O8 and 0.64 %V2O5 (approximately 4 million lbs uranium and 5 million lbs vanadium) 
during the period 1979-1984 (Chenowith, 1990).  
 
Section 2 of the Velvet Mine Uranium Project is drilled on approximately one hundred 
foot centers throughout the majority of the mineralized area.  The surface topography in 
this area is characterized by rugged plateaus and steep canyons.  Many of the drill 
locations were constructed on steep benches, with nearly 500' of elevation differential 
between the highest and lowest drill hole collars on the property.  Based upon the type of 
deposit and the on site knowledge gained by actual mining of the deposit adjacent to the 
site, the drilling demonstrates continuity to the extent that Atlas and MRC prepared mine 
feasibility studies and were prepared to initiate mining on the deposit prior to price 
downturns in the early 1980's. The drilling demonstrates continuity particularly along the 
mineralized trends. Based on the drill density and the apparent continuity of the 
mineralization along trends, the mineral resource estimate meets the criteria as indicated 
resources under the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.  Mineral 
resources are reported based on GT cutoffs of 0.25 and 0.50.  For reporting purposes the 
0.5 cutoff is recommended and is thus highlighted in the mineral resource tabulations that 
follow. 
 
The data available for this report was limited to data from the previous Atlas mineral 
holdings in Section 2.  EMC holds additional mining claims in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 
of T31S, R25E and in Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E.  Although potential exists on all 
of these holdings, the most significant known mineral resources, apart from Section 2, 
occur on the former Uranerz property now controlled by EMC in Sections 6 and 7 in 
T31S, R26E.  Chenoweth, 1990, states, "About 1987, Uranerz USA, Incorporated 
announced a discovery in the southeastern Lisbon Valley.  This discovery on Three Step 
Hill in Section 7, T.31S., R.26E., is reported to contain some 2.5 million pounds U3O8." 
In addition, Umetco reportedly held unmined mineral resources of 800,000 pounds U3O8 
in Section 3 adjacent to Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine. (Bates, 2007).  These reports of 
mineral resources are of a historic nature and work necessary to independently verify the 
classification of the mineral resource estimates in accordance with National Instrument 
43-101, verified by a qualified person and in compliance with CIM standards has not 
been completed. This historical estimate should not be relied upon.  
 
Recommendations for the continuing exploration and development of the Atlas property 
include: 
 

1. Acquire any additional drill logs and other pertinent data not currently held by 
EMC that may be available including the former Uranerz property located in 
Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E. 

2. Complete a 43-101 compliant mineral resource report for the former Uranerz 
property located in Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E.

3. Complete a mineral reserve and economic feasibility study including preparation 
of a 43-101 compliant mineral reserve report for the overall Velvet Mine Uranium 
Project. This feasibility study would include underground mining with heap leach 
recovery and/or toll milling based upon the location, depth, and grade of the 
mineralization. 

4. Evaluate the potential for developing the property as a satellite heap leach 
operation to other properties in the Lisbon Valley and/or consolidating this 
property with other properties in the vicinity to support the capital investment of a 
new central processing facility. This evaluation should consider the co-product 
value of vanadium. 

5. Test by drilling the potential for mineralization extending eastward and/or 
southeasterly from the known trend, specifically, the southeast Â¼ of State of Utah 
lease ML49377 in Section 2 T31S, R25E.  If the trend continues, drilling could 
extend into UT claims 31-38 in Sections 11 and 12, T31S, R25.  

6. Many of the original drill holes appear to be open.  It is recommended that, where 
possible, open holes should be re-logged with modern geophysical logging 
equipment. 

7. Additional drilling has already been completed on the property.  If this data can 
be obtained, the resource estimate should be updated accordingly.  In the absence 
of this data, additional drilling is recommended, consisting of approximately 10 
holes for a total of 15,000 feet.  It is recommended that these holes be cored 
within the anticipated mineralized horizon and chemically assayed for uranium, 
vanadium and other minerals. 

8. Confirm and expand previous metallurgical studies and investigations including 
the collection of additional core samples for testing. 

9. Complete a detailed hydrological investigation including the determination of 
geohydrologic properties and current ground water levels and quality.   

 
No economic evaluation of the mineralization described herein was completed.  Thus, the 
estimate that follows is solely a mineral resource estimate.  Previous estimates assumed 
mining by underground mining methods with conventional mineral processing.  The GT 
cutoff of .5 was utilized based upon the anticipated underground mining methods, which 
allows for extraction with thicknesses greater than 5' with minimum grade at 0.1% eU3O8.

SECTION 4   INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
This report was prepared by BRS, Inc. for EMC to address the geology, uranium 
mineralization and in-place geologic resources within EMC's mineral holdings known as 
the Velvet Mine Uranium Project.  The Velvet Mine Uranium Project was extensively 
explored during the 1970's with the principal exploratory work and drilling completed by 
Atlas Minerals prior to 1980.  Atlas conducted extensive drilling on the lands currently 
held by EMC including the delineation of 4 mineralized areas with drilling on a rough 
grid approximating 100 foot centers.  The available data includes radiometric data from 
some 173 drill holes completed on the property.  The data utilized as the basis of this 
evaluation and in the preparation of this report was acquired by EMC from Dean Stucker, 
a mining engineer formerly employed by Minerals Recovery Corporation.  Although 
some additional drilling may have been completed on the property, this data is currently 
not available.

SECTION 5   RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The author has relied on the accuracy of the historical data as itemized in Section 4 and 
various project reports as referenced in Section 23 of this report. 
 
The location of the unpatented mining lode claims and the state mineral leases, shown on 
Figure 2, which form the basis of the mineral holdings, was provided by EMC and was 
relied upon as defining the mineral holdings of EMC in the development of this report.

SECTION 6   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
 
The Velvet Mine Uranium Project is located in Section 2, Township 31 South, Range 25 
East at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 109o 09' West (refer to Figure 
1, Velvet Mine Uranium Project Location Map).   
 
The Velvet Mine Uranium Project Drill Hole and Claim Map, Figure 2, was provided by 
EMC and represents the approximate location of unpatented mining lode claims and state 
leases held by EMC.  Section 2 is a State of Utah lease ML 49377 of approximately 488 
acres which was obtained by Mr. William Sheriff by competitive bid, and subsequently 
transferred to Energy Metals Corp.   
 
Mineral rights for adjacent properties are controlled via unpatented claims UT 1-10, 19-
24, 29, 21-29, 31-38, 41-46, 48, 50,52,52-72, and 129 are located in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 
12 of T31S, R25E and Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E.  In total these mineral holdings 
comprise approximately 1,600 acres. 
 
The claims were located by EMC and are not known to have any encumbrances or 
royalties. The claims will remain the property of EMC provided they adhere to required 
filing and annual payment requirements with San Juan County and the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM).   Legal surveys of unpatented claims are not required and to the 
author's knowledge have not been completed.   
 
There are no pre-existing mineral processing facilities or related wastes on the property. 
In order to conduct exploratory logging and/or drilling of the property, the operator will 
be required to file a Notice of Intent (NOI) to explore, and obtain a permit from the State 
of Utah Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (DOGAM).  
Any exploration on Bureau of Land Management lands would also require filing an NOI.  
Mine development would require a number of permits depending on the type and extent 
of development, the major permit being the actual mining permit issued by the DOGAM.  
In addition, BLM would require NEPA clearances on federal lands.  Utah is an agreement 
state with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC).  Thus, the Utah Division of 
Radiation Control would regulate mineral processing activities.  To the author's 
knowledge, there are no current environmental permits for the project area.

SECTION 7 
 
ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Velvet Mine Uranium Project is located within the Lisbon Valley physiographic 
province in San Juan County, Utah.  The project is approximately 10 miles south of La 
Sal, Utah. 
 
The site is located at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 109o 09' West, 
on the southeastern side of the Lisbon Valley on Three Step Hill.  The project area is 
located primarily on a dipping bench above the Lisbon Valley, with elevations averaging 
6,800 feet above sea level.  The southern portions of the deposit are located beneath 
another higher bench, with nearly 500' of elevation differential between the highest and 
lowest drill hole collars on the property.   Vegetation is characteristically pinion, cedar, 
and juniper forest, with some ponderosas in the higher areas.  Bare rock with sparse 
vegetation such as yucca is common, and sagebrush is thick in drainages where soil 
forms.  Elk, deer, coyote, and bobcat sign were observed, as well as some raptor activity.  
The site is located on a topographic divide between Big Indian Wash and the Lisbon 
Valley, both of which are ephemeral drainages.  Big Indian Wash is tributary to Kane 
Springs Creek which enters the Colorado River southwest of Moab, Utah.  The Lisbon 
Valley drains through the Little Indian Canyon into Colorado where it joins the Dolores 
River, which enters the Colorado River northeast of Moab. 
 
The site is seasonally accessible via 2-wheel drive on existing county and/or two-track 
roads as follows: 

â¢ Proceed south on San Juan County RT 2430, Lisbon Valley Road, from Highway 
46 near La Sal approximately 18 miles; 

â¢ Turn west on a two track road, passing an historic cabin and proceed upwards 
along Three Step Hill approximately 3 miles to the site. 

 
Additional access may be made from the west where the two track meets the Big Indian 
Wash Road approximately 5.5 miles from Highway 163 south of La Sal Junction.  It is 
assumed that this was the access utilized by the Velvet Mine during operations.  The 
author did not verify this access route although it appeared to be more accessible during 
wet or muddy conditions than the route from Lisbon Valley. 
 
In addition to access roads, some infrastructure is present on the site.  The site is 
accessible over the multiple drill trails covering the area.  An active copper mine, Lisbon 
Valley Copper Mine, is located 3 air miles north of the property.  A power line terminates 
near the Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine portal, which is located in the SE Â¼ of Section 3, T 
31S, R25E, within Â¼ mile of the drilling on Section 2.  The Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine 
portal has been closed.  However, personal communication with Tony Bates, an Umetco 
employee responsible for dewatering and maintenance of the Velvet Mine from 1988-
1990, indicated that the portal could be reopened with minimum effort, and that the 
decline should be in good condition until the interface with the ground water table.

SECTION 8  HISTORY 
 
The original locator of this property was Gulf Minerals Corporation.  The Velvet Mine 
Uranium Project was initially drilled during the 1970's with the principal exploratory 
work and drilling completed by Gulf.  Gulf sold the property to Atlas in the late 1970's.  
Atlas' Velvet Mine commenced operations in 1979 in Section 3 and advanced to the 
property line on Section 2 (the current holdings of EMC).  Atlas completed feasibility 
studies for mining the Section 2 mineral resources including hoisting and haulage of ores 
to their Moab mill for processing in 1980.  These plans were never executed in light of 
low uranium prices in the 1980's and the property was sold by Atlas Minerals as they 
were experiencing an economic downturn.  Minerals Recovery Corporation (MRC) of 
Lakewood, Colorado purchased the property from Atlas for approximately 
$10,000,000.00.   MRC was the operating arm of Wisconsin Public Service Company.  
Additional drill holes were drilled in 1981 and 1984 by MRC.  A feasibility study was 
completed by Minerals Recovery Corp. in 1983.  Subsequently Wisconsin Public Service 
Company exited the uranium business.  Atlas closed the Velvet Mine in Section 3 in 
1984.  The Velvet Mine property was acquired by Umetco Minerals Corp. in 1989.  
Umetco was interested in the property due to the vanadium content of the remaining 
reserves.  Umetco held the Section 3 property until the mid 1990's at which time they 
dropped the property.  In addition, Wisconsin Public Service allowed their lease on 
Section 2 to lapse.  Mr. William Sheriff secured the Section 2 state lease by competitive 
bid, staked the adjoining mining claims, and subsequently transferred the property to 
Energy Metals Corp.     
 
Drill hole locations are shown on Figure 2, Drill Hole and Claim Map.  The drill maps 
show the collar locations.  All drilling was vertical.  Downhole drift is shown on the 
original data maps.  For the current modeling, mineral locations were based upon the 
bottom of hole locations as shown on the original data maps.  The drilling delineated 4 
mineralized areas drilling on approximate 100 foot centers.  Available data includes 
radiometric data from some 173 drill holes completed on the property.   
 
Historic mineral resource estimates by MRC estimated a 0.40 %eU3O8 average grade for 
mining purposes, with an ore to waste ration of 1 ton ore to 0.5 ton waste.  A minimum 
grade of 0.1% eU3O8 and a GT cutoff of 0.40 was applied in the development of an 
underground mine operation plan. The historic estimates are comparable to the current 
mineral resource estimate.

SECTION 9   GEOLOGIC SETTING 
 
Surfical geology is shown on Figure 3, Geologic Map and Stratigraphic Column.  Figure 
4, Velvet Mine GT Map, displays the mineralization in plan view. 
  
Uranium mineral resources within and in the vicinity of the project are found in the upper 
Permian Cutler formation.  Many of the other mines in the district were located in the 
basal Moss Back member of the Triassic Age Chinle Formation overlying the Cutler 
Formation.  As shown on Figure 3, Geologic Map and Stratigraphic Column, there is an 
erosional unconformity between the Permian and Triassic aged beds where the Triassic 
Moenkopi formation was eroded away before the placement of the Moss Back Member 
of the Chinle Formation.  It is believed that the mineralization in both formations is 
related to the unconformity, although the location of mineralization with respect to the 
contact varies from location to location within the district.  Most of the mineral resources 
in the Cutler occur within six feet of the unconformity.  Figure 2 in the 1990 Chenoweth 
report shows geology, mines and known mineral resources in the district.  Much of the 
historic mining in the vicinity such as the Bardon, Divide, School Section, Pats, and 
Service Berry mines are pre-1960 except for the Velvet Mine (1979-1984).  With the 
exception of the Velvet and Bardon mines, most of these are in the Chinle 1941.  The 
discovery of mineralization in the Cutler formation was late, therefore the Cutler is 
largely unexplored (Chenoweth, 1990, page 41).  Most of the earlier drilling stopped at 
the base of the Chinle.  Further to the east, the discovery of Uranerz deposit was reported 
in 1987 in T31S, R26E, Section 7 (Chenoweth, 1990).  The potential for mineralization 
between the Velvet and Uranerz deposits is currently unknown.  Recommendations of 
this report include acquisition of any additional data that may be available for adjacent 
areas, and exploration for potential mineralization in the Cutler Formation by drilling. 
 
The mineral resources appear to be located in channel deposits and troughs in the 
paleotopography, but no pattern or common orientation is evident. Cutler host rocks 
consist of alternating beds and lenses of light pink, orange, and buff mudstone, calcareous 
siltstone, and arkosic sandstone.  The sandstone beds are well sorted, are fine to medium 
grained, and are as much as 50 feet thick.  The sandstone is comprised of quartz, feldspar, 
and biotite, with clay as the predominant binder, but locally calcite may be in the main 
cement.  Uraninite is the principal uranium mineral, with small amounts of coffinite.  In 
addition, vanadium in the forms of montroseite, doloresite, and vanadium clay and/or 
hydromica was an important by product of the Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine, adjacent to 
the current property.  The Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine produced approximately 400,000 
tons of ore at grades of 0.46 %U3O8 and 0.64 %V2O5 (approximately 4 million lbs uranium 
and 5 million lbs vanadium) during the period 1979-1984 (Chenoweth, 1990).  
 
No data is currently available regarding ground water levels or quantities.  Pumping was 
required during the operational phase of the old Velvet Mine.  Personal communication 
with Tony Bates indicated that the ground water will require treatment prior to any 
discharge.  The Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine has not been dewatered since 1990.

SECTION 10   DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
Uranium mineralization within the Colorado Plateau of Southwestern Colorado and 
Southeastern Utah have been described as tabular-blanket type deposits that are sub-
parallel to bedding planes and/or features such as unconformities.  Mineralization is often 
confined to paleochannels and controlled by lithology, permeability, porosity, and the 
presence of a chemical reductant, often carbonaceous material (Hasan, 1986).  A similar 
depositional morphology is observed at the Velvet Mine.   
 
Figure 4, Velvet Mine GT Map, shows the mineralization of the Velvet area in plan view.

SECTION 11   MINERALIZATION 
 
Please note the following terminology is used in this report: 
  

1. GT is the grade thickness product.   
2. Grade is expressed as weight percent.   
3. eU3O8 means radiometric equivalent U3O8.  

 
Mineral resource estimates for the Velvet mineralization are based on radiometric data.  
Radiometric equilibrium was assumed as discussed in Section 20 of this report. 
 
EMC's mineral holdings at the Velvet Mine Uranium Project are located in Section 2, 
Township 31 South, Range 25 East at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 
109o 09' West (refer to Figure 1, Velvet Mine Uranium Project Location Map).  The 
Velvet Mine Uranium Project Claim Map, Figure 2, was provided by EMC and 
represents the approximate location of EMC's state leases and claims in the area.  Section 
2 is a State of Utah lease of approximately 488 acres, with adjacent unpatented claims 
located in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 of T31S, R25E and Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E 
(refer to Figure 2, Drill Hole and Claim Map).  In total these mineral holdings comprise 
approximately 1,600 acres.

Width and Trend Length 
 
As shown on Figure 4 in plan view, a distinct mineralization trend is well defined by the 
drilling, with the appearance of a meandering channel.  Mineralization is within the 
Permian Cutler Formation. Drilling in the Velvet area is sufficient to define a mineralized 
trend along a length of approximately 3,000 feet within the Cutler Formation. The base of 
the mineralization ranges from approximately 757 to 1345 feet from the surface and 
averages approximately 6.8 feet summed thickness. Mineralization thickness ranges from 
1 to 19 feet thick with an average of 3.8 feet. Within the mineralized zone, individual 
intercepts were combined to represent the GT for the hole within that zone.  The summed 
GT for the Velvet area ranges from 0.01 to 10.88 with an average of 1.319.  The location 
of the mineralized zone was taken to be the bottom of the mineralization.  Drill data 
demonstrates continuity of mineralization laterally within the Velvet mineralization.  
 
No economic evaluation of the mineralization described herein was completed.  Thus, the 
estimate that follows is solely a mineral resource estimate.  Previous estimates assumed 
mining by underground mining methods with conventional mineral processing.  The GT 
cutoff of .5 was utilized based upon the anticipated underground mining methods, which 
allows for extraction with thicknesses of 5' or greater with minimum grade at 0.1% 
eU3O8. 
 
Adjacent Properties - UT Claims 
 
MRC did not hold property outside of Section 2.  All other properties currently held by 
EMC in the district were not drilled by MRC.  Data was not available for the claims 
portions of the property at the time of this evaluation.  EMC is currently seeking any data 
that may be available for this area.  Umetco reportedly held unmined mineral resources of 
800,000 pounds U3O8 in Section 3 within Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine, and the nearby 
Uranerz deposit is reported to contain mineral resources of 2,500,000 pounds U3O8 in 
T31S, R26E, Section 7.  However, these reports of mineral resources are of a historic 
nature and work necessary to independently verify the classification of the mineral 
resource estimates in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, verified by a qualified 
person and in compliance with CIM standards has not been completed. These historical 
estimates should not be relied upon.  
 
The mineralized trend from the Section 2 mineralization was drilled out to the boundary 
of Section 3 where Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine is located.  The mineralized trend was 
drilled toward the southeast corner, where a single line of widely spaced holes with lower 
values were apparently utilized to delineate the southeastern boundary of the deposit.  It 
is recommended that additional drilling be completed to the southeast to explore for any 
potential extension of mineral resources in this direction.  It is assumed that one reason 
further drilling was not completed to the southeast is that the topography climbs in this 
direction, making drilling depths greater.

Summary 
 
The interpreted mineralized trends, shown on Figure 4 in plan view are based on 
moderately spaced drill data and the reported continuity of the deposit.  Based on the drill 
density and the apparent continuity of the mineralization along trends, the mineral 
resource estimate meets the criteria as an indicated mineral resource for the Velvet Mine 
area under the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.

SECTION 12  EXPLORATION 
 
Data available for the preparation of this report was developed by previous owners of the 
property.  EMC has not yet conducted its own exploration of the property. The relevant 
exploration data for the current property is the drill data as previously discussed and as 
represented graphically in the various figures of this report.  This data demonstrates that 
mineralization is present on the property and defines its three dimensional location.   
 
The data available for this mineral resource evaluation is based upon drill and mine plan 
maps prepared by Minerals Recovery Corporation.  The drill maps show drill hole 
locations at the surface and downhole due to vertical drift, and the thickness and 
radiometric grade of uranium measured in weight percent U3O8. 
 
Based upon the confirmation drilling performed by MRC on the Atlas drilling, and the 
consistency between feasibility studies performed by MRC and Atlas, and the results of 
the current mineral resource estimate, the data is considered reliable. 
 



 

18 

SECTION 13  DRILLING 
 
Atlas and MRC conducted extensive drilling on the lands currently held by EMC 
including the delineation of 4 mineralized areas with drilling on a rough grid 
approximating 100' centers.  The available data includes radiometric data from some 173 
drill holes completed on the property.  The data utilized as the basis of this evaluation and 
in the preparation of this report was acquired by EMC from Dean Stucker, a mining 
engineer formerly employed by MRC.  No core data or assay data for vanadium was 
available.  Recommendations in this report include acquisition of such data. 



 

19 

SECTION 14  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
The majority of the data available was from drill maps.  The companies responsible for 
the development of this data were actively mining and had completed mining up to the 
boundary between the Atlas Minerals, Velvet mine in Section 3 and the subject property 
of this report in Section 2, T31S, R25E.  No core or assay data was available. 
Recommendations in this report include acquisition of such data. 
 
The data utilized in this report is considered accurate and reliable for the purposes of 
completing a mineral resource estimate for the property. 
 



 

20 

SECTION 15  SAMPLE PREPARTATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY 
 
The data available was developed by previous mine operators.  As previously discussed 
in Section 14 the data is considered accurate and reliable for the purposes of completing a 
mineral resource estimate for the property.    
 
 



 

21 

SECTION 16  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Drill data for each drill hole consisting of radiometric data was posted on drill maps 
including collar elevation, elevation to the bottom of the mineralized intercept, thickness 
of mineralization, grade of mineralization, and elevation of the bottom of the hole.  Data 
entry was checked and confirmed.  Drill hole locations were digitized from the drill maps 
to create a coordinate listing and then plotted.  The resultant drill maps were then checked 
and confirmed by overlaying with the original maps.   
 
Once the database had been developed and data entry confirmed, individual mineralized 
intercepts were evaluated on a hole by hole basis and combined to represent a probable 
mining thickness appropriate for underground mining methods.  This process eliminated 
some thin and/or isolated mineralized intercepts.  The resultant data was then utilized to 
develop the Grade Thickness (GT) map, Figure 4.   The GT map was then compared to 
mine plans available from previous feasibility studies to verify the data.   
 
Recommendations in this report include drilling and core sampling consisting of 
approximately 10 holes for a total of 15,000 feet.  It is recommended that these holes be 
cored within the anticipated mineralized horizon and chemically assayed for uranium, 
vanadium and other minerals.

SECTION 17   ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The portion of the project addressed specifically in this report is located in Section 2, 
Township 31 South, Range 25 East at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 
109o 09' West (refer to Figure 1, Velvet Mine Uranium Project Location Map).  Section 2 
is a State of Utah lease of approximately 488 acres.  Adjacent mineral properties 
controlled by EMC include unpatented claims located in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 of 
T31S, R25E and Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E (refer to Figure 2, Drill Hole and Claim 
Map).  In total these mineral holdings comprise approximately 1,600 acres. 
 
The data available for this report was limited to data from the previous Atlas mineral 
holdings in Section 2.  EMC holds additional mining claims in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 
of T31S, R25E and in Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E.  Although potential exists on all 
of these holdings, the most significant known mineral resources, apart from Section 2, 
occur on the former Uranerz property now controlled by EMC in Sections 6 and 7 in 
T31S, R26E.  Chenoweth, 1990, states, "About 1987, Uranerz USA, Incorporated 
announced a discovery in the southeastern Lisbon Valley.  This discovery on Three Step 
Hill in Section 7, T.31S., R.26E., is reported to contain some 2.5 million pounds U3O8." 
In addition, Umetco reportedly held unmined mineral resources of 800,000 pounds U3O8 
in Section 3 adjacent to Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine (Bates, 2007).  These reports of 
mineral resources are of a historic nature and work necessary to independently verify the 
classification of the mineral resource estimates in accordance with National Instrument 
43-101, verified by a qualified person and in compliance with CIM standards has not 
been completed. This historical estimate should not be relied upon.  
 
The authors have no material interest in the subject property or adjacent properties.

SECTION 18  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  
 
Mining by Atlas Minerals extended from Section 3 eastward to the boundary of the state 
lease on Section 2 which is the subject of this report.  Ores mined from the Atlas 
Minerals' Velvet Mine were processed for vanadium and uranium.  The Atlas Minerals' 
Velvet Mine produced approximately 400,000 tons of ore at grades of 0.46 %U3O8 and 
0.64 %V2O5 (approximately 4 million lbs uranium and 5 million lbs vanadium) during the 
period 1979-1984 (Chenoweth, 1990).  
 
Feasibility studies completed for mining of the Section 2 mineral resources projected 
90% recovery of uranium utilizing an acid leach conventional mill.  No specific data is 
currently available for the grade of vanadium, however, past production did recover 
vanadium as a by-product.  Recommendations in this report include drilling and core 
sampling consisting of approximately 10 holes for a total of 15,000 feet.  It is 
recommended that these holes be cored within the anticipated mineralized horizon and 
chemically assayed for uranium, vanadium and other minerals, and that amenability 
studies be conducted on the core samples recovered.

SECTION 19 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
The Velvet Mine Uranium Project is located within the Lisbon Valley Uranium Mining 
District of Utah.  With regard to the socioeconomic and political environment, the Lisbon 
Valley has been a uranium mining district and production center for over 40 years.  
Today a copper mine operates within a few miles of the Velvet Uranium Mine Project.  
In addition, two uranium mills remain active in the State of Utah.  Although a new mine 
operation may have detractors, the area has a mining history and a climate generally 
favorable for mining. 
 
In order to conduct exploratory logging and/or drilling of the property, the operator will 
be required to file a Notice of Intent (NOI) to explore, and obtain a permit from the State 
of Utah Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (DOGAM).  
Any exploration on Bureau of Land Management lands would also require filing an NOI.  
Mine development would require a number of permits depending on the type and extent 
of development, the major permit being the actual mining permit issued by the DOGAM.  
In addition, BLM would require NEPA clearances on federal lands.  Utah is an agreement 
state with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC).  Thus, the Utah Division of 
Radiation Control would regulate mineral processing activities.  To the author's 
knowledge, there are no current environmental permits for the project area.   
 
Uranium mining in Utah is subject to Mineral Production Tax.  Mineral Production Tax 
Withholding was increased from 4% to its current level of 5% effective July 1, 1993.  
Refer to Utah Senate Bill 180, 1993.  On the Section 2 State of Utah lease, a 12.5% 
royalty is levied on uranium, and a 4.8% royalty applies to vanadium production.  
Additional state taxes would include property and sales taxes. At the federal level profit 
from mining ventures is taxable at corporate income tax rates.  However, for mineral 
properties depletion tax credits are available on a cost or percentage basis whichever is 
greater.  For uranium the percentage depletion tax credit is 22% among the highest for 
mineral commodities, IRS Pub. 535. 
 
The following mineral resource estimates were completed by Douglas Beahm, P.E., P.G., 
Principal Engineer, and Harold Hutson, P.E., P.G., Senior Engineer, BRS Inc. 
 
Assumptions 
 

1. A unit weight of 14.5 cubic feet per ton was assumed, based on data from 
feasibility studies prepared by previous operators and published reports. 

2. Mineral resource estimates were based on radiometric equivalent data.  
Radiometric equilibrium was assumed (Refer to Section 20). 

 
Terminology used in this report 
  

1. GT is the grade thickness product.   
2. Grade is expressed as weight percent.   
3. eU3O8 means radiometric equivalent U3O8.

EMC's mineral holdings at the Velvet Mine Uranium Project are located in Section 2, 
Township 31 South, Range 25 East at approximate Latitude 38o 07' North and Longitude 
109o 09' West (refer to Figure 1, Velvet Mine Uranium Project Location Map).  The 
Velvet Mine Uranium Project Claim Map, Figure 2, was provided by EMC and 
represents the approximate location of EMC's state leases and claims in the area.  Section 
2 is a State of Utah lease of approximately 488 acres, with adjacent unpatented claims 
located in Sections 3, 4, 11, and 12 of T31S, R25E and Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E 
(refer to Figure 2, Drill Hole and Claim Map).  In total these mineral holdings comprise 
approximately 1,600 acres.

Adjacent Properties - UT Claims 
 
MRC did not hold property outside of Section 2.  All other properties currently held by 
EMC in the district were not drilled by MRC.  Data was not available for the claims 
portions of the property at the time of this evaluation.  EMC is currently seeking any data 
that may be available for this area.  Umetco reportedly held unmined mineral resources of 
800,000 pounds U3O8 in Section 3 adjacent to Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine, and the 
nearby Uranerz deposit is reported to contain mineral resources of 2,500,000 pounds 
U3O8 in T31S, R26E, Section 7.  However, these reports of mineral resources are of a 
historic nature and work necessary to independently verify the classification of the 
mineral resource estimates in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, verified by a 
qualified person and in compliance with CIM standards has not been completed. These 
historical estimates should not be relied upon.  
 
The mineralized trend from the Section 2 mineralization was drilled out to the boundary 
the Section 3 where the Atlas Minerals' Velvet Mine is located.  The mineralized trend 
was drilled toward the southeast corner, where a single line of widely spaced holes with 
lower values were apparently utilized to delineate the southeastern boundary of the

The interpreted mineralized trends, shown on Figure 4 in plan view are based on 
moderately spaced drill data and the reported continuity of the deposit.  Based on the drill 
density and the apparent continuity of the mineralization along trends, the mineral 
resource estimate meets the criteria as an indicated mineral resource for the Velvet Mine 
area under the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.  At a cutoff of 0.50 
GT (5 ft @ 0.10 %U3O8) the indicated mineral resource estimated for EMC's mineral 
holdings on Section 2, T31S, R25E, total 2,082,156 pounds U3O8 at an average grade of  
0.34%U3O8.

SECTION 20  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 
Radiometric Equilibrium 
 
No quantitative data is available to evaluate radiometric equilibrium as part of this 
mineral resource evaluation.  Qualitatively, however, deposits in the Lisbon Valley are 
located in a reduced environment and radiometric equilibrium was not a factor in past 
mining.   Literature concerning deposits in this area generally does not specifically 
address radiometric equilibrium, however, Chenoweth, 1990 states "Although most of 
these deposits are hundreds of feet above the present water table, the low permeability, 
due to cementation by calcite, has protected them from oxidation."  In addition to the 
mineralogical characteristics of the mineralization, as described by Chenoweth, which 
limit oxidation of the uranium minerals, the Velvet Mine Uranium Project is below the 
water table further limiting the potential for oxidation.  Absent the oxidizing conditions 
requisite to mobilize the uranium in favor of its radioactive daughter products, the 
assumption of radiometric equilibrium is reasonable. 
 
Vanadium 
 
No vanadium assays are available for this mineral resource evaluation.  The Atlas 
Minerals' Velvet Mine produced approximately 400,000 tons of ore at grades of 0.46 
%U3O8 and 0.64 %V2O5 (approximately 4 million lbs uranium and 5 million lbs vanadium) 
during the period 1979-1984 or a vanadium/uranium ratio of 1.4:1.  Vanadium production 
from the Lisbon Valley from 1948 though 1970 totaled some 18.5 million pound of V2O5 
at an average grade of 0.34 % V2O5 (Chenoweth, 1990).  Feasibility studies completed by 
previous operators projected a similar Vanadium/Uranium ratio as previously mined and 
included a vanadium credit in their financial evaluations (MRC, 1983).  
Recommendations in this report include evaluation vanadium content by drilling. 
   



 

29 

SECTION 21  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
This report summarizes the mineral resources within the property known as the Velvet 
Mine Uranium Project and held via a state lease located in Section 2, Township 31 South, 
Range 25 East, by Energy Metals Corporation.  It was the objective of this report to 
complete the estimate of mineral resources, and that objective was met.  Mineral 
resources in Section 2 meet the standards for indicated mineral resources under the CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.  However, it should be noted that 
previous operators prepared mine plans, feasibility studies and were preparing to mine 
this area prior to the collapse of the uranium market in the 1980's with little or no 
additional drilling recommended at that time. 
 
EMC holds mineral rights to additional, contiguous properties comprising approximately 
an additional 1,600 acres.  However, there was no data available for these properties at 
the time this report was prepared.  Potential for mineralization does exist on adjacent 
EMC properties, as documented in this report.  This potential is at present untested.  In 
addition, the former Uranerz property now controlled by EMC in Sections 6 and 7 in 
T31S, R26E, has reported mineral resources defined by drilling. This report recommends 
acquisition of additional data and exploration of these contiguous properties.   
 
Past mining has produced vanadium as a co-product.  It is recommended that the 
feasibility of producing vanadium as a co-product be evaluated for future operations. 
 
 



 

30 

SECTION 22  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The following recommendations are appropriate as the property moves toward 
development. 
 

1. Acquire any additional drill logs and other pertinent data not currently held by 
EMC that may be available including the former Uranerz property located in 
Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E. 

2. Complete a 43-101 compliant mineral resource report for the former Uranerz 
property located in Sections 6 and 7 in T31S, R26E.  

3. Complete a mineral reserve and economic feasibility study including preparation 
of a 43-101 compliant mineral reserve report for the overall Velvet Mine Uranium 
Project. This feasibility study would include underground mining with heap leach 
recovery and/or toll milling based upon the location, depth, and grade of the 
mineralization.  This evaluation should consider the co-product value of 
vanadium. 

4. Evaluate the potential for developing the property as a satellite heap leach 
operation to other properties in the Lisbon Valley and/or consolidating this 
property with other properties in the vicinity to support the capital investment of a 
new central processing facility. 

5. Test by drilling the potential for mineralization extending eastward and/or 
southeasterly from the known trend, specifically, the southeast Â¼ of State of Utah 
lease ML49377 in Section 2 T31S, R25E.  If the trend continues, drilling could 
extend into UT claims 31-38 in Sections 11 and 12, T31S, R25.  

6. Many of the original drill holes appear to be open.  It is recommended that, where 
possible, open holes should be re-logged with modern geophysical logging 
equipment. 

7. Additional drilling has already been completed on the property.  If this data can 
be obtained, the resource estimate should be updated accordingly.  In the absence 
of this data, additional drilling is recommended, consisting of approximately 10 
holes for a total of 15,000 feet.  It is recommended that these holes be cored 
within the anticipated mineralized horizon and chemically assayed for uranium, 
vanadium and other minerals. 

8. Confirm and expand previous metallurgical studies and investigations including 
the collection of additional core samples for testing. 

9. Complete a detailed hydrological investigation including the determination of 
geohydrologic properties and current ground water levels and quality.
