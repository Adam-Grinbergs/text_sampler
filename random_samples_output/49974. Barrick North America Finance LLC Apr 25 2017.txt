FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of 
historical fact regarding Barrick Gold Corporation or the Goldstrike Mine, are forward-looking 
statements. The words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "contemplate", "target", "plan", "intend", 
"project", "continue", "budget", "estimate", "potential", "may", "will", "can", "could" and similar 
expressions identify forward-looking statements.  In particular, this report contains forward-
looking statements with respect to cash flow forecasts, projected capital, operating and 
exploration expenditure, targeted cost reductions, mine life and production rates, potential 
mineralization and metal or mineral recoveries, and information pertaining to potential 
improvements to financial and operating performance and mine life at the Goldstrike Mine.  All 
forward-looking statements in this report are necessarily based on opinions and estimates made 
as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risks and uncertainties, 
many of which cannot be controlled or predicted. Material assumptions regarding forward-looking 
statements are discussed in this report, where applicable. In addition to such assumptions, the 
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to significant business, economic and 
competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of commodities (including 
gold, silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration 
and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration 
successes; risks associated with the fact that the Best-in-Class Initiatives are still in the early 
stages of evaluation and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their 
impact; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions, and 
technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical 
difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including disruptions in the 
maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; damage 
to Barrick Gold Corporation's or Goldstrike Mine's reputation due to the actual or perceived 
occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the handling of 
environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to 
acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; the impact of global liquidity and credit 
availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected 
future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in interest 
rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations 
and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or 
nationalization of property and political or economic developments; failure to comply with 
environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to 
comply with, necessary permits and approvals; litigation; contests over title to properties or over 
access to water, power and other required infrastructure; increased costs and physical risks 
including extreme weather events and resource shortages related to climate change; and 
availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are 
risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, 
including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, 
pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, or gold concentrate losses (and the risk of 
inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks).

results or the Goldstrike Mine's actual performance, and could cause actual results or 
performance to differ materially from the future results or performance expressed or implied in 
any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Barrick Gold Corporation.  All of the 
forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements. 
Barrick Gold Corporation, Roscoe Postle Associates Inc, and the Qualified Persons who authored

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-1 

1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Goldstrike Open Pit and Underground Mine 

(the Goldstrike Mine), in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada, USA.  The purpose of this 

report is to support public disclosure of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates at 

the Goldstrike Mine as of December 31, 2016.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 

Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  The effective date of the Mineral Resource and 

Mineral Reserve estimates in this Technical Report is December 31, 2016, and information in 

this Technical Report is current as of that date unless otherwise specified.  RPA visited the 

Goldstrike Mine on October 26 and 27, 2016. 

 

Barrick is a Canadian publicly traded mining company with a large portfolio of operating 

mines and projects.  The Goldstrike Mine property is located within the northern Carlin Trend 

on the western flank of the Tuscarora Mountains in Eureka and Elko Counties, north central 

Nevada, USA, approximately 38 mi northwest of Elko and 25 mi north of the town of Carlin. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine contains both open pit and underground operations.  The Betze-Post 

open pit is a large-scale operation utilizing a traditional truck and shovel fleet.  The current 

open pit production plan shows that 13.51 million tons of ore grading 0.112 oz/st Au will be 

mined and rehandled from stockpiles from 2017 to 2031.  The ultimate pit will measure 

approximately two miles east to west, 1.5 mi north to south, and have an average depth of 

approximately 1,300 ft.  The underground mine consists of 11 separate zones stretching over 

a length of 12,000 ft and a vertical distance from approximately 600 ft to 2,000 ft below 

surface.  Underground mine production is planned from the Rodeo, Meikle, North Post, JV 

Post, and Banshee mine areas.  Underground Mineral Reserves totalling 6.26 million tons at 

0.288 oz/st Au are projected to sustain the mine operations until 2023.  

 

The open pit and underground resource estimates are based on depleting the 2016 mid-year 

block models, which were built using data available up to January 22, 2016.  RPA examined 

the end-of-year (EOY2016) open pit and underground Mineral Resource estimates and is of

the opinion that they meet or exceed industry standards and are acceptable to support 

estimation of Mineral Reserves. 

 

Table 1-1 summarizes the total Mineral Resources, exclusive of Mineral Reserves, at the 

Goldstrike Mine.  Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources total 9.07 million tons grading 

0.160 oz/st Au and contain 1.46 million oz Au.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources total 

1.3 million tons grading 0.277 oz/st Au and contain 349,000 oz Au.   

 

In metric units, the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources total 8.23 million tonnes 

grading 5.50 g/t Au and contain 1.46 million oz Au.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources 

total 1.1 million tonnes grading 9.48 g/t Au and contain 349,000 oz Au.

2. Mineral Resources are estimated using a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. 
3. Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. 
4. Open pit Mineral Resources are based on cut-off grades of 0.030 oz/st Au for roaster feed, 0.050 oz/st 

Au for acid autoclave feed, 0.055 oz/st Au for alkaline autoclave feed.  
5. Underground Mineral Resources are reported at cut-off grades between 0.133 oz/st Au and 0.261 oz/st 

Au. Incremental material at a cut-off grade of 0.10 oz/st Au is included if it is part of the mine sequence. 
6. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
7. Totals may not add due to rounding. 
8. North Post JV (Barrick 70% and Newmont 30%) reported at 70%. 

 

The Mineral Reserves for the Goldstrike Mine are shown in Table 1-2.  These Mineral 

Reserves are a combination of the open pit and underground reserves, stockpiles, and

2. Mineral Reserves are estimated using an average long-term gold prices of US$1,000 per ounce for 2017

through 2020 and US$1,200 per ounce onwards.
3. Stockpiles include Autoclave, Roaster, and Distal.
4. Cut-off grades vary by processing type, mining method, and mining location.
5. Open pit autoclave cut-off grade is 0.070 oz/st Au and the open pit roaster cut-off grade is 0.040 oz/st

Au.  The majority of the ore material in stockpile was generated at higher cut-off grades because of lower
gold prices.

6. Underground cut-off grades are between 0.166 oz/st Au and 0.261 oz/st Au.
7. The Mineral Reserve estimate includes inventory.
8. Totals may not add due to rounding.
9. North Post JV (Barrick 70% and Newmont 30%) reported at 70%.

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the open pit or 

underground Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.

CONCLUSIONS 
Based on the site visit and subsequent review, RPA offers the following conclusions. 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 

General 

 Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 
methodologies.  The classification of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Resources 
conforms to Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM 
definitions). 
 

 The sampling, sample preparation, and analyses are appropriate for the style of 
mineralization and Mineral Resource estimation.  The current drill hole database is 
reasonable for supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.  

 
 The EOY2016 open pit and underground resource block models are reasonable for 

supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. 
 

 The resource modelling procedures are well documented. 
 

 Overall, RPA is of the opinion that Goldstrike has conducted high quality resource 
modelling work that exceeds industry standard practice.  
 

 Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves and are estimated 
effective December 31, 2016 (EOY2016). 
 

 Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 9.07 million tons grading 0.160 
oz/st Au and contain 1.46 million oz Au.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources total 
1.3 million tons grading 0.277 oz/st Au and contain 349,000 oz Au. 
 

 Based on reconciliation results, RPA is of the opinion that the open pit and 
underground resource models are slightly conservative. 

 
Open Pit 

 Open pit Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 5.76 million tons grading 
0.078 oz/st Au and contain 447,000 ounces of gold.  In addition, Inferred Mineral 
Resources total 89,000 tons grading 0.056 oz/st Au and contain 5,000 oz Au. 
 

 The on-going work to update the lithology and fault models will improve future open 
pit resource models. 
 

 For 2016, the open pit resource model overstated the tons by 9%, understated the 
gold grade by 21%, and understated the gold ounces by 10% compared to the actual 
open pit production.

Underground 

• Underground Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 3.31 million tons 
grading 0.304 oz/st Au and contain 1.01 million oz Au.  Inferred Mineral Resources 
are estimated to be 1.2 million tons grading 0.294 oz/st Au, containing 344,000 oz Au. 
 

• For 2016, the underground resource model understated the tons by 7%, understated 
the gold grade by 9%, and understated the gold ounces by 17% compared to the 
actual underground production.   

 
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 
General 

• The Mineral Reserve estimates have been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 
methodologies and the classification of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 
conforms to CIM definitions.   
 

• Mine planning for the Goldstrike Mine follows industry standards.   
 

• RPA considers the selection of mining methods and the design practices to be 
appropriate for the deposits. 

 
• Equipment purchases scheduled for the current Life of Mine (LOM) plan are 

reasonable.   
 

• The workforce is well trained and capable of achieving the necessary production 
targets established by the Engineering Department in a safe manner. 
 

• The EOY2016 Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for the open pit, underground, 
stockpiles, and inventory total 77.92 million tons grading 0.104 oz/st Au and contain 
8.08 million oz Au. 
 

• The LOM plan is in place and is based upon current operating experience.  Recovery 
and cost estimates are based upon actual operating data and engineering to support 
a Mineral Reserve statement.  Economic analysis using these estimates generates a 
positive cash flow, which supports a statement of Mineral Reserves.  

 

Open Pit and Stockpiles 

• Open pit Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves total 13.48 million tons grading 
0.112 oz/st Au, containing 1.51 million oz Au.  
 

• There is potential to add another pit phase (5 NW) to Mineral Reserves, provided 
some uncertainties around the geometry of a weak rock unit are resolved by 
geotechnical drilling and testing. 
 

• Ore control procedures and results for the Goldstrike open pit are well documented.  
All records have been kept in good condition and are readily accessible. 
 

• The EOY2016 Proven Mineral Reserves located in 34 different stockpiles are 
estimated to be 58.17 million tons grading 0.081 oz/st Au, containing 4.70 million oz

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-6 

Au.  The estimation methods used to track the stockpile tonnages and grades are 
reasonable. 
 

• The stockpiles represent approximately 59% of the Mineral Reserve gold ounces and 
76% of the Mineral Reserve tons. 

 

Underground 

• Underground Proven plus Probable Mineral Reserves are estimated to be 6.26 million 
tons grading 0.288 oz/st Au, containing 1.81 million oz Au. 

 
• The reconciliation between production and Mineral Reserves is completed in a 

comprehensive manner on a monthly basis.  Results indicate significant gains over 
Mineral Reserve estimates, due to mining of material classified as Inferred or 
unclassified or rejected due to low confidence rating at the time of the estimate.  This 
material is generally upgraded by infill drilling between the time of the estimate and 
mining.  Interim block model updates would capture this material. 
 

• There is potential to extend Mineral Reserves at depth, given further dewatering to 
depress the water table. 

 
PROCESS 

• RPA confirmed that the procedures used to estimate gold recovery meet industry 
standards. 
 

• Planning the process feed is a well-coordinated and complex operation to ensure ore 
going to the processing operation provides optimum results.  The milling operations 
are well run, safe, and environmentally sound and meet industry standards.   
 

• Implementation of the Thiosulphate Leach Conversion (TLC) process will extend the 
useful life of the pressure oxidation (POX) plant and may significantly increase the 
gold production by allowing earlier treatment of ores that were not previously 
amenable to POX. 
 

• The roaster operation was running well during the site visit.   
 

• The adjustments made to the process production data and mill head grades based on 
actual gold production conform to industry standards. 

 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

• Goldstrike has an experienced staff of professionals who are diligent in the 
maintenance of their permits.   
 

• Reclamation estimates are realistic, in RPA's opinion.

RISKS 
RPA has not identified any significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be 

expected to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration information, the Mineral 

Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, or associated projected economic outcomes.   

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the site visits and review of available data, RPA presents the following 

recommendations. 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 
Open Pit 

• Review/update the composite weighting scheme with more recent reconciliation data. 
 

• Include the underground and blasthole data in future variography studies. 
 

• Investigate using the blasthole, drill hole, and mapping data to build high grade 
wireframes for structurally controlled mineralization. 
 

• Investigate updating the tonnage factors in some areas. 
 

Underground 
• Use a resource classification clean-up script or classification wireframes to upgrade a 

small amount of Inferred blocks that are scattered within the Indicated areas. 
 

• Additional density test work is warranted in some areas. 
 
MINING  

• Carry out geotechnical drilling, testing, and analysis to resolve issues with the 5 NW 
pit phase. 
 

• Investigate procedural changes that will improve the underground production 
reconciliation results. 
 

• Use reconciliation results and stope performance analysis to evaluate stope designs 
to determine where improvements in mine planning would be most advantageous.  
 

• Review the long term underground productivity estimates for the next LOM plan as 
the tons per man year in the current plan are forecast to decrease over time. 
 

• Continue to evaluate an extension of the dewatering program to access 
mineralization at depth. 
 

• Continue the stockpile sampling program to confirm the grades, especially stockpiles 
that will be processed within the short term.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-8 

• Continue to sample, test, and review the metallurgical characteristics of the ore 
stockpiles on a periodic basis to ascertain how they may affect the process and 
impact recovery and costs. 
 

• Develop a comprehensive mine planning procedure manual. 

 

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  
Under NI 43-101 rules, producing issuers may exclude the information required in this 

section on properties currently in production, unless the Technical Report includes a material 

expansion of current production.  RPA notes that Barrick is a producing issuer, the Goldstrike 

Mine is currently in production, and a material expansion is not being planned.  RPA has 

performed an economic analysis of the Goldstrike Mine using the estimates presented in this 

report and confirms that the outcome is a positive cash flow that supports the statement of 

Mineral Reserves. 

 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, AND LAND TENURE 
The Goldstrike Mine property is located within the northern Carlin Trend on the western flank 

of the Tuscarora Mountains in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada, USA, approximately 38 mi 

northwest of Elko and 25 mi north of the town of Carlin. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine area is composed of approximately 10,372 acres of surface rights of 

which approximately 1,922 acres are public lands administered by the Bureau of Land 

Management (BLM) and 8,450 acres are patented and private lands owned by Barrick 

Goldstrike Mines, Inc. (Goldstrike), Barrick's wholly-owned subsidiary.  There are 

approximately 8,736 acres of mineral rights ownership/control made up of 1,962 acres of 

public lands and 6,774 acres of private land.  These rights are owned or controlled through 

ownership of various forms of patents issued by the USA and by ownership of unpatented 

mining and millsite claims held subject to the paramount title of the USA. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine property includes a total of 298 unpatented mining and mill-site claims. 

Unpatented mining claims are maintained on an annual basis, and do not expire as long as 

the payments are made.  All mining leases and subleases are reviewed on a monthly basis 

and all payments and commitments are paid as required by the specific agreements.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-9 

A total disturbance of 9,028 acres is currently authorized for the mine.  The majority (87%) of 

the total authorized disturbance would occur on private lands owned by Goldstrike.  The 

remainder (13%) of the authorized disturbance would occur on public lands administered by 

the BLM. 

 

The Goldstrike property has various royalty shareholders with a maximum overriding Net 

Smelter Royalty (NSR) of 4% and a Net Profit Interest Royalty (NPI) of between 2.4% and 

6% over various parts of the property.  Key royalty shareholders are Franco-Nevada and 

Royal Gold, Inc. 

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Goldstrike Mine is located in a major mining region and local resources including labour, 

water, power, and local infrastructure for transportation of supplies are well established.  The 

majority of the workforce lives in the nearby towns of Elko, Spring Creek, Carlin, and Battle 

Mountain. 

 

The surface rights secured for the Goldstrike Mine are sufficient to provide the necessary 

space required for all mining and quarrying activities.  Enough land area also exists on the 

property to accommodate all foreseeable processing plants, ore and low-grade stockpiles, 

tailings impoundments, and waste disposal areas. 

 

Currently, the major assets and facilities associated with the Goldstrike Mine are: 

• Underground and open pit mines with production from several mineralized zones. 
 

• The physical plant site including the administrative office complex and associated 
facilities, the open pit and underground mine workings and associated facilities, ore 
processing plants (autoclave pressure oxidation and roaster circuit) and associated 
facilities such as the laboratories, ore stockpiles, waste dumps, coarse ore storage, 
tailings storage, workshops, warehouses. 

 
• Facilities providing basic infrastructure to the mine, including electric power, water 

treatment and supply, and sewage treatment. 
 

• Surface and underground infrastructure including mine ramps, headframes, hoists, 
ventilation raises, maintenance shops, and mobile equipment fleets. 

 

The water for processing and mining is delivered from dewatering production wells and is 

more than adequate for present and planned requirements.  Active dewatering operations

are required and a water management group is in place to carry out all dewatering including 

pumping, distribution, delivery, and disposal.   

 

Barrick has a 115 MW natural gas-fired power plant, located near Reno, Nevada, that allows 

the flexibility to provide power through a combination of self-generation and market 

purchases.  

 

HISTORY 
The earliest gold mining activity in the northern part of the Carlin Trend occurred at the 

Bootstrap and Blue Star mines prior to the discovery of gold at the Goldstrike Mine property.  

At Bootstrap, just northwest of the Goldstrike Mine, antimony was discovered in 1918, 

followed by gold in 1946.  Gold was produced at the Bootstrap during 1957 to 1960.  At Blue 

Star, immediately south of the Goldstrike Mine, gold was identified in 1957 in areas that had 

been mined for turquoise. 

 

The first discovery of gold in the Goldstrike property was in 1962 by Atlas Minerals.  Soil 

samples and drilling discovered low-grade gold mineralization.  In 1973 to 1974, the Nevada 

Syndicate (funded by Lac Minerals) outlined shallow mineralization in the Long Lac and 

Winston areas.  Polar Resources (Polar) in 1975, followed by Pancana Minerals Ltd. 

(Pancana) from 1976 to 1977, delineated the Number 9 deposit and several low-grade zones 

within the Goldstrike intrusion to the east of Nevada Syndicate property.  From 1975 to 1977, 

Polar and Pancana operated a small open pit and heap leach. 

 

In 1978, Western States Minerals Corporation (Western States) entered into a 50/50 joint 

venture with Pancana, which had consolidated the various claims and leases in the 

Goldstrike Mine area.  The bulk of the production was from oxidized zones, chiefly from the 

Long Lac, Bazza, and West Bazza deposits, plus some production from deposits within the 

Goldstrike intrusion.  The Post deposit was discovered in 1982.  Exploration continued until 

1986 when a deep core hole was drilled at Post and the Deep Post deposit was discovered.   

 

American Barrick Resources Corporation acquired the mine and properties from Western 

States (50%) in December 1986 and subsequently purchased Pancana's interest (50%) in 

January 1987 for a total purchase price of $62 million.  A deep drilling program outlined the 

large, high-grade Deep Post deposit, which was subsequently found to continue onto the 

adjacent property owned by Newmont Gold Company (Newmont).  Exploration drilling in 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-11 

1987 to 1988 led to the discovery of a number of other deposits similar to Deep Post.  These 

included Betze and Screamer, which, together with Deep Post, comprise the Betze-Post 

deposit.  Other discoveries in 1987 and 1988 included Deep Star, Rodeo, Meikle, South 

Meikle, and Griffin. 

 

Heap leach ore production from the Betze-Post pit continued from the time of purchase to the 

end of 1998.  Oxide mill ore processing started in August 1988 and the autoclave portion of 

the mill commenced operation in early 1990.  The processing of ores by the roaster began in 

2000. 

 

The 1999 Asset Exchange with Newmont resulted in the acquisition of the Goldbug (the 

southern portion of Rodeo), West Rodeo, Barrel, and North Post deposits.  These deposits 

were in the Newmont land corridor separating the Betze-Post and Meikle mines.  The 

Banshee property north of the Meikle was also part of the exchange. 

 

Past production from the Goldstrike Mine from 1987 to the end of 2016 totals 42.8 million 

ounces of gold.   

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Goldstrike Mine is located in the eastern Great Basin (Basin and Range Province) within 

the northern Carlin Trend on the western flank of the Tuscarora Mountains.  The Carlin Trend 

is an alignment of gold mines located in a northwest-southeast belt extending five miles wide 

and 40 mi long, which accounts for more gold production than any other mining district in the 

United States.  The northern trends account for more than twenty gold mines and deposits. 

 

Carlin deposits comprise stratabound and structurally controlled disseminated hydrothermal 

gold mineralization hosted by Silurian-Devonian carbonate rocks that have been 

metamorphosed to varying degrees.  The deposits are hydrothermal in origin and are usually 

structurally controlled.  The carbonate host rocks are part of an autochthonous miogeoclinal 

carbonate sequence exposed as tectonic windows beneath the Roberts Mountains 

allochthon.  The allochthonous rocks are a sequence of lower Paleozoic dominantly 

siliciclastic eugeoclinal rocks that were displaced eastward along the Roberts Mountains 

Thrust over younger units during the Upper Paleozoic Antler orogeny. 

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-12 

The western or siliciclastic allochthonous assemblage consists of mudstone, chert, siltstone, 

and minor limestone and includes imbricate thrust slices of Devonian Slaven, Silurian Elder, 

and Ordovician Vinini Formations.  The eastern autochthonous assemblage of carbonate 

rocks consists of calcareous mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the Rodeo Creek Unit, 

muddy limestone of the Devonian Popovich Formation, silty limestone to massive 

fossiliferous limestone of the Silurian-Devonian Roberts Mountains Formation, sandy 

dolomite of the Ordovician Hanson Creek Formation, quartzite of the Ordovician Eureka 

Quartzite, and limestone, cherty limestone and dolomite of the Ordovician Pogonip Group. 

Jurassic quartz diorite, as plugs, sills, and dikes, has intruded the Paleozoic sedimentary 

rocks.  Dikes and sills of Jurassic monzonite and lamprophyre, and Tertiary dacite and 

rhyodacites, are mapped in the area. 

 

Gold mineralization was emplaced approximately 39 Ma ago along favourable stratigraphy 

and structural features such as faults and folds, and along contacts between sedimentary 

rocks and the Goldstrike stock.  Faulting provided major conduits for mineralizing fluids and 

may also have produced clay alteration that can act as a mineralizing barrier.  Intense 

fracturing around the contact zone of the Goldstrike stock caused solution collapse and 

brecciation of the surrounding sedimentary units.  Secondary fracture permeability was 

generated along the crests of anticlines, creating focal points for collapse breccia and 

dissolution zone formation.  Finally, lithology and alteration contacts act as permeability 

barriers to fluids causing mineralization to pond along them particularly where feeder 

structures intersect these contacts.  Alteration is characterized by decalcification of 

limestone, silicification of all rock types, and clay development in (argillization) structurally 

disturbed areas.  

 

The gold mineralization is associated with silicification, argillization, and sulphide 

mineralization.  In refractory sulphide ore, the gold is intimately associated with very fine-

grained pyrite and marcasite.  In some areas, the pyrite oxidized, freeing the gold and 

making its extraction relatively easy, as in the historic Post Oxide deposit.  Sulphide minerals 

associated with gold mineralization include arsenopyrite, realgar, orpiment, and stibnite.  

Gangue minerals include quartz, calcite, and barite.  Realgar and orpiment are generally low 

in abundance; however, these minerals are locally common in stockwork veinlets, fracture 

fillings, and breccia matrices.

EXPLORATION STATUS 
To date, surface geological mapping and prospecting has been completed on the property, 

with pit mapping on-going.  In excess of 27,000 diamond and reverse circulation (RC) holes 

have been drilled on the property to the end of 2016.  Geochemical soil and rock sampling 

was carried out on the property in early exploration.  Geophysical surveys include airborne 

and ground magnetometer; gravity; time domain pole-dipole induced polarization (IP); DC 

resistivity; controlled source audio magnetotellurics and MT (magnetotellurics); time domain 

MT/IP using a distributed assay system; electrical logging of drill holes; and downhole IP.  

Gold mineralization is not directly detectable by geophysical methods; however, surveys map 

subsurface properties that are useful in interpreting lithology, alteration, and structure as 

guides to gold mineralization.  Aerial photographic surveys are performed every other year 

for open pit survey control. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of December 31, 2016.  The open pit 

and underground resource estimates are based on depleting the 2016 mid-year block 

models, which were built using data available up to January 22, 2016 for underground and 

March 3, 2016 for open pit.  RPA examined the EOY2016 open pit and underground Mineral 

Resource estimates and is of the opinion that they meet or exceed industry standards and 

are acceptable to support Mineral Reserve estimation. 

 

The Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves.  The EOY2016 Measured plus 

Indicated Mineral Resources total 9.07 million tons grading 0.160 oz/st gold and contain 1.46 

million ounces of gold.  In addition, EOY2016 Inferred Mineral Resources total 1.3 million 

tons grading 0.277 oz/st Au and contain 349,000 oz Au. 

 

Goldstrike has very experienced on-site staff that are dedicated to maintaining the Betze-

Post open pit resource block model and the Meikle and Rodeo underground block models.  

Different resource estimation procedures and block models are used to estimate the open pit 

and underground resources at the Goldstrike Mine.    

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the open pit or 

underground Mineral Resource estimates.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-14 

MINERAL RESERVES 
The Mineral Reserves are generated based upon the mine designs applied to the Mineral 

Resources.  The design methodology uses cut-off grade estimates, confidence ratings, and 

economic assessment for validation.  The Mineral Reserve estimates have been prepared 

utilizing acceptable estimation methodologies and the classification of Proven and Probable 

Reserves conforms to CIM definitions. 

 

The EOY2016 Proven and Probable Reserves for the open pit, underground, stockpiles, and 

inventory total 77.92 million tons grading 0.104 oz/st Au and contain 8.08 million oz Au. 

 

Goldstrike maintains a complex system of ore and low grade stockpiles, which have been 

growing since the late 1980s.  There are primarily three major stockpile categories: 

Autoclave, Roaster, and Distal (stockpiles around property). 

 

The Proven Reserves located in open pit stockpiles are estimated to be 58.17 million tons 

grading 0.081 oz/st Au, containing 4.70 million oz Au, as of December 31, 2016.  RPA 

agrees with the ore control rationale for creating the stockpiles, and the accounting methods 

used to track the stockpile quantities and grades.  

 

MINING METHOD 
OPEN PIT 
Barrick's Betze-Post open pit is a large scale operation utilizing a traditional truck and shovel 

fleet.  The open pit has three remaining phases, with the ultimate pit to measure 

approximately two miles east to west, 1.5 mi north to south, and have an average depth of 

approximately 1,300 ft.  The Bazza Waste Dump was located to the southwest of the open 

pit, and it is closed at this time.  The mine plan includes continued use of the Clydesdale 

Dump to the west, and backfilling of the south and southeast portion of the open pit.  Internal 

to the pit is the Betze Portal, which connects to the Rodeo underground mine, the North Post 

Portal, which connects to North Post and Rodeo underground, and the Betze Portal 2 used 

for ventilation.  

 

Ultimate pit limits were determined by generating Whittle pit shells based on the net cash 

generated, and the pit slopes recommended by Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd.  Haul 

ramps were designed to be 140 ft wide, including a safety berm for double lane traffic 

accommodating the 330 ton class haul trucks, and have a maximum grade of 10%.  Mining

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-15 

thickness is 40 ft in waste, and 20 ft in ore to help minimize dilution.  In ore, triple benching is 

utilized creating 60 ft faces between catch benches. 

 

Barrick optimizes mining by using a multi-phased approach, which maximizes stripping rates 

to keep an ore producing face available as much as possible.  This multi-phase technique 

consists of a primary ore layback, a primary stripping layback, and a secondary stripping 

layback.  Historically, this approach was put in place to maintain a consistent mill feed, and 

keep mine production in the range of 14 to 15 benches per layback per year.   

 
UNDERGROUND 
Generally low-strength rock conditions are the key factor in the underground mine design 

and mining method selection.  This has led to two mining methods, both of which rely on 

cemented backfill for support.  In relatively good to fair ground conditions, where longhole 

stoping methods are used, the wall and back instability is reduced by mining smaller, long-

hole sections and filling before taking the next section.  In poor ground, the underhand drift 

and fill method provides a backfill roof for subsequent lifts in the mining cycle. 

 

Transverse longhole stoping is used where the mineralized zone has a significant width.  

Footwall drifts are driven parallel to the strike of the ore to provide access for stoping.  Mining 

with transverse stopes requires a primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary extraction to 

completely mine out the area.  Longitudinal stopes are utilized in areas of the mine where the 

geometry and ground conditions allow.  The stopes are accessed from a footwall drive and 

then driven parallel to the strike of ore.  Each section is mined and filled before the next 

section is mined.   

 

The underhand drift and fill method is utilized in areas with rock quality ratings of Fair to 

Poor, regardless of the width of the zone.  The underhand drifts are nominally designed as 

15 ft wide by 15 ft high.  The minimum ore width is 15 ft (one drift).  A primary drift is driven 

with increased ground support to hold the ground open, then backfilled with a high strength 

cemented rock fill or pastefill.  Where the ore width exceeds the nominal drift width, 

subsequent drifts are developed (parallel or at oblique angles to the primary drift) and then 

backfilled.  This process continues until the entire ore shape at a given elevation has been 

excavated and filled.  Successive cuts are taken beneath the primary workings, utilizing the 

backfill as an engineered back.

MINERAL PROCESSING 
There are two ore processing facilities at the Goldstrike Mine.  They are: 

1. An autoclave circuit consisting of: 

o Grinding circuits 
o Acid and alkaline POX autoclave circuits, followed by 
o Total Carbonaceous Material (TCM) leaching process, incorporating a Resin 

in Leach (RIL) circuit, using calcium thiosulfate (CaTs) for gold dissolution 
instead of cyanide. 
 

2. A roaster circuit, consisting of: 
o Dry grinding circuits 
o Two-stage fluid bed roasting 
o Carbon in Leach (CIL) gold recovery 

 

Depending on various factors, including gold content, carbonate content, carbonaceous 

carbon reactivity, and sulphide sulphur content, the Betze-Post open pit ore is hauled to 

various stockpiles located at either the POX area or the roaster area.  Planned distribution of 

ore from the stockpiles is ongoing exercise which is carried out by the strategic planning 

department to maintain optimal blends designed to maximize gold recovery.   

All of the underground ore is processed in the roaster. 

 
ACID/ALKALINE POX CIRCUIT 
The grinding circuit was developed in two phases with a total capacity of 17,500 stpd.  In 

both phases, the crushed ore is fed to semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills operating in 

closed circuit with pebble cone crushers.  The SAG mill discharge is pumped to secondary 

grinding circuits, ball mills operating in closed circuit with a bank of cyclones.  The overflow 

from the cyclones on the Mill 1 side feeds a tertiary ball mill also operating in closed circuit 

with a bank of cyclones.  The cyclone overflow feeds one of the two thickeners that are 

common to both grinding circuits.  A third thickener is utilized to recycle process solution as 

make-up water for grinding. 

 

The thickener underflow is fed to a series of acidulation tanks where sulphuric acid is added 

to reduce the carbonate content, thereby reducing the potential carbon dioxide gas that will 

be generated in the autoclaves under acidic conditions. 

 

The acidified slurry is fed to a series of preheaters where hot steam is contacted with the 

new feed in order to preheat the material.  The sulphide oxidation reaction is carried out 

under elevated pressure and temperature in autoclaves.  High purity oxygen is also added as

the oxidant.  The autoclave discharge passes through a series of flash vessels to let down 

the pressure followed by a series of tube and shell slurry coolers.  The heat from the flash 

vessels is the primary steam source used for heating the slurry in the preheaters. 

 

The autoclave products are very acidic due to the generation of sulphuric acid from the 

sulphide oxidation reaction that occurs in the autoclaves.  The pH of the slurry is increased to 

8.0 to 8.5 with the addition of slaked lime in a series of neutralization tanks followed by 

thiosulfate leaching concurrent with resin-in-leach (RIL). 

 

As the carbonate levels in a portion of the ores from the Goldstrike Mine have increased, 

three of the autoclaves have been converted such that they can operate in an alkaline 

environment, as needed.  Due to the high carbonate concentration, the autoclave reaction 

does not generate excess acid and the designated flash tank discharge, after being cooled in 

the slurry coolers, is combined with acidic discharge in the neutralization circuit to minimize 

lime addition requirements. 

 

The slurry from neutralization is pumped to one of two RIL circuits, each made up of seven 

tanks.  Calcium thiosulfate and other leaching reagents are added.  The slurry flows by 

gravity through the series of seven tanks and resin is pumped counter-current to the slurry.  

From the first tank, loaded resin is transferred to the elution and refining circuit for recovery 

of the gold.  The slurry exiting the seventh tank in the series is sent to a tails tank, and then 

pumped to the tailings storage facility (TSF3). 

 

The loaded resin is transferred to one of four elution vessels where inorganic materials are 

first removed and then the gold stripped in a series of chemical wash steps.  The pregnant 

solution containing the gold is forwarded to the new electrowinning and existing gold smelting 

circuit.  The stripped resin is chemically regenerated before the resin is returned to one of the 

two RIL circuits. 

 
ROASTER OPERATION 
Fluid bed roasters were constructed to treat carbonaceous refractory ores that could not be 

treated effectively by the existing POX circuit.  The roasters use high purity oxygen to react 

with organic carbon and sulphide sulphur prior to processing in a conventional CIL circuit.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 1-18 

After crushing, the ore is conveyed to one of the two grinding circuits.  The ore is dried and 

then flows toward the centre of the mill where it is removed through screens for classification 

into product size material.  The roaster material has a target product size of 80% passing 

(P80) 74 µm. 

 

The ore is primarily oxidized in the first stage of the roasters and then solids discharge by 

gravity continuously to the second stage.  The temperature is maintained in the range of 

524oC to 561oC.  Oxidation is essentially completed in the second stage, achieving 

approximately 99% oxidation of the sulphide sulphur and greater than 90% oxidation of the 

organic carbon.  Material from the second stage of the roaster discharges by gravity to the 

calcine quench system. 

 

The exhaust gas from each stage is classified using dry cyclones.  The coarse material 

recovered from the exhaust gas is returned to the roaster for further treatment and the fine 

material is forwarded to gas quenching and final dust scrubbing.  The off-gas from the final 

dust scrubbers from both circuits are recombined for final off-gas cleaning.  The final gas 

cleaning circuit removes mercury, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxides.  

The gas then exits through a stack to the atmosphere. 

 

The treated calcine from the roaster is sent to a quench tank to reduce temperature.  Water 

recovered from the neutralization circuit is used to cool the calcine.  The slurry feeds 

neutralization tanks where milk-of-lime is added for pH control in order to safely leach the ore 

with cyanide.  After leaving the neutralization tanks, the material is sent to a thickener to 

recover excess water for cooling and reuse in the quench tanks.  The thickener underflow 

reports to the roaster CIL circuit. 

 

The slurry from neutralization tanks is pumped to a CIL circuit, which has eight agitated 

tanks.  Activated carbon is pumped counter-currently from the eighth tank to the first tank.  

The carbon then is transferred to a loaded carbon holding bin and taken to the main elution 

and refining operation located adjacent to the POX operations.  The slurry exiting the final 

CIL tank is sent to a cyanide destruction reactor before being transferred to the tailings 

storage facility (North Block).

RECOVERY 
Barrick has developed recovery calculations based on evaluation of historical data.  They 

have changed over time as the ore and operations have changed.  Based on the evaluation 

of the head grade adjustments, RPA is of the opinion that the recovery calculations and the 

equations used to estimate gold recoveries are accurate. 

 

MARKET STUDIES 
Gold is the principal commodity at the Goldstrike Mine and is freely traded, at prices that are 

widely known, so that prospects for sale of any production are virtually assured.  The doré 

produced at the Goldstrike Mine is shipped to commercial refineries, which are located in a 

major city like Salt Lake City, Utah.   

 

ENVIRONMENTAL, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The Goldstrike operations consist of operating open pit and underground mines plus process 

plant facilities.  The mines and the corporation have environmental groups and management 

systems to ensure that the necessary permits and licences are obtained and maintained.  

These groups also carry out the required monitoring and reporting. 

 
TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY  
Tailings from both the POX and roaster operations were deposited in the North Block 

Tailings Disposal Facility (NBTDF) located immediately to the east of the roaster facility and 

the Meikle mine until 2014.  Currently, only tailings from the Roaster operations are 

deposited into NBTDF.  The NBTDF operates as a zero discharge facility under Water 

Pollution Control Permit NEV091029 with the Nevada Division of Environment Protection 

(NDEP) and Jurisdictional Dam Permit J-699 with the Nevada Division of Water Resources 

(NDWR).  The NBTDF is expanded approximately every two years and is currently permitted 

through a Stage 12 expansion. 

 

Tailings from the TCM Leach/POX operations are deposited in the Tailings Storage Facility 3 

(TSF3) located immediately south of the NBTDF.  TSF3 operates as a zero discharge facility 

under Water Pollution Control Permit NEV091029 with the NDEP and Jurisdictional Dam 

Permit J-662 with the NDWR.  TSF3 is expanded approximately every two years and is 

currently constructed through Stage 2 and permitted through Stage 6.

PROJECT PERMITTING 
The BLM issued a Decision on the Amendment to the Plan of Operations for the 2015 Betze 

Pit Expansion through the Determination of NEPA Adequacy process.  The approval of this 

Amendment ensured the continuance of mining and processing for the Goldstrike operations. 

 

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 
CAPITAL COSTS 
Current LOM capital costs are estimated to be $915 million.  The major capital cost for the 

open pit will be capitalized waste stripping, which is estimated to be $362 million.  Capital for 

the process facilities is estimated to be $143 million, which consists primarily of replacement 

capital.  Underground mine development is projected to be $134 million.   

 
OPERATING COSTS 
The total operating cost has been estimated by Goldstrike to be approximately $4.3 billion 

over the LOM plan (2017-2032).  Over the same time period, the average open pit mining 

operating cost is estimated to be $1.49 per ton mined.  Underground mining cost will average 

$99 per ton mined.  Processing costs will average $29.51 per ton processed. 

 

BEST-IN-CLASS INITIATIVES 
Year-over-year operating cost improvements were realized through implementation of the 

Goldstrike Optimization Program (part of Barrick's Best-in-Class initiatives) in 2016.  Some 

examples of improvements include: 

 
• Underground mining efficiencies increased production through haulage efficiencies, 

better control of development overbreak, and improved paste crew effectiveness.  
This improved underground mining unit costs by 5%. 
 

• Open pit mining efficiencies decreased equipment operating hours through break 
rotators and parking excess trucks.  This improved open pit mining unit costs by 16%. 
 

• Autoclave/TCM plant efficiencies reduced costs through the use of key performance 
indicator dashboards and short interval control.  This improved TCM unit costs by 4%. 
 

• Roaster plant recoveries increased by 1% with the installation of two new CIL tanks, 
commissioned ahead of schedule.  Roaster unit costs improved by 3%.

2 INTRODUCTION 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Goldstrike Mine (the Goldstrike Mine), in 

Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada, USA.  The purpose of this report is to support public 

disclosure of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates at the Goldstrike Mine as of 

December 31, 2016.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure 

for Mineral Projects.  The effective date of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 

estimates in this Technical Report is December 31, 2016, and information in this Technical 

Report is current as of that date unless otherwise specified. 

 

Barrick is a Canadian publicly traded mining company with a portfolio of operating mines and 

projects across five continents.  The Goldstrike Mine property is located within the northern 

Carlin Trend on the western flank of the Tuscarora Mountains in Eureka and Elko Counties, 

north central Nevada, USA, approximately 38 mi northwest of Elko and 25 mi north of the 

town of Carlin. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine contains both open pit and underground operations.  The Betze-Post 

open pit is a large-scale operation utilizing a traditional truck and shovel fleet.  The current 

open pit production plan shows that 13.51 million tons of ore grading 0.112 oz/st Au will be 

mined and rehandled from stockpiles from 2017 through 2031.  The ultimate pit will measure 

approximately two miles east to west, 1.5 mi north to south, and have an average depth of 

approximately 1,300 ft.  The underground mine consists of 11 separate zones stretching over 

a length of 12,000 ft and a vertical distance from approximately 600 ft to 2,000 ft below 

surface.  Underground mine production is planned from the Rodeo, Meikle, North Post, and 

Banshee mine areas.  Underground Mineral Reserves totalling 6.26 million tons at 0.288 

oz/st Au are projected to sustain the mine operations until 2023.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Goldstrike Mine property is located within the northern Carlin Trend on the western flank 

of the Tuscarora Mountains in Eureka and Elko Counties, north central Nevada, USA, 

approximately 38 mi northwest of Elko and 25 mi north-northwest of the town of Carlin.  The 

Goldstrike Mine lies within Township 36 North and Ranges 49 & 50 East MDM.  The 

administration building is located at approximately 40o58.389 N 116o21.149 W NAD 27 

(Figure 4-1). 

 

Barrick acquired the interest of Western States Minerals Corporation (WSMC) in the 

Goldstrike Mine in December 1986.  In 1994, Barrick Goldstrike Mines, Inc. (Goldstrike), a 

wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick, received patents under the General Mining Law to 1,793 

acres of land on which the Betze-Post Mine, the Meikle Mine, and most of Goldstrike's milling 

and beneficiation operations are situated.  In June 1995, Goldstrike acquired title to 1,657.5 

acres of public lands in a land exchange with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that 

were subject to Goldstrike's unpatented millsite claims within or adjacent to Goldstrike's 

mining and milling operation.  A second land exchange to consolidate land ownership 

occurred between Goldstrike and the BLM in 1995.  The Section 31 land exchange (BLM 

1995) resulted in Goldstrike acquiring title to 1,279 acres of public land that was subject to 

Goldstrike's unpatented mining claims within or adjacent to Goldstrike's mining and milling 

operations.  

 

On May 3, 1999, Newmont Gold Company (Newmont) and Goldstrike completed a 

transaction known as the asset exchange.  The purpose of the asset exchange was to 

rationalize the ownership and control of both the surface and subsurface estates that were 

jointly owned by the parties and to reduce the number of complex agreements that were 

needed to permit efficient operation and development of properties owned by both 

companies.  

 

As a result of these exchanges, Goldstrike obtained: 

(1) the land needed for the development of the west end of the Betze-Post open pit; 

(2) control of the open pit, including the right to backfill the pit; 

(3) control of other lands important to its security that were needed for waste rock 
facilities;

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 4-2 

(4) the underground deposits adjacent to its Meikle and Rodeo mines.   

 

A joint venture agreement (70%-30%) with Newmont holding 30%, allows mining of a small 

area in the North Post area owned by Newmont. 

 

Current land ownership is shown in Figure 4-2. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine area is composed of approximately 10,372 acres of surface rights of 

which approximately 1,922 acres are public lands administered by the BLM and 8,450 acres 

are patented and private lands owned by Goldstrike.  There are approximately 8,736 acres of 

mineral rights ownership/control made up of 1,962 acres of public lands and 6,774 acres of 

private land.  These rights are owned or controlled through ownership of various forms of 

patents issued by the USA and by ownership of unpatented mining and millsite claims held 

subject to the paramount title of the USA. 

 

The Goldstrike Mine property includes a total of 298 unpatented mining and mill-site claims. 

Unpatented mining and mill-site claims are maintained on an annual basis, and do not expire 

as long as the maintenance fee payments are made.  All mining leases and subleases are 

reviewed on a monthly basis and all payments and commitments are paid as required by the 

specific agreements.  Details of the claims are a matter of public record, available at the BLM 

Land & Mineral Legacy Rehost System (LR2000 website). 

 

Figure 4-3 shows the general surface arrangement of the property and the footprint of the 

Goldstrike mineralization relative to the property boundaries. 

 

A total disturbance of 9,028 acres is currently authorized for the mine.  The majority (87%) of 

the total authorized disturbance would occur on private lands owned by Goldstrike.  The 

remainder (13%) of the authorized disturbance would occur on public lands administered by 

the BLM. 

 

The Goldstrike property has various royalty shareholders with a maximum overriding Net 

Smelter Royalty (NSR) of 4% and a Net Profit Interest Royalty (NPI) of between 2.4% and 

6% over various parts of the property.  Key royalty shareholders are Franco-Nevada and 

Royal Gold, Inc.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The Goldstrike Mine is accessed from Elko, Nevada, by travelling west approximately 26 mi 

on U.S. Interstate 80 to Carlin, Nevada, where State Route 766 provides access to various 

mining operations, including the Goldstrike Mine.  Access to the property is provided by 

access agreements with Newmont that allow for the use of various roads in the area and a 

right-of-way issued by the BLM.  The roads are well maintained and most are paved.   

 

CLIMATE 
Annual temperatures range from minus 38ºF to plus 104ºF.  Average annual snowfall 

averages 30 in., while annual rainfall averages eight to ten inches.  The heaviest months of 

precipitation are during the winter, as snow, and in May and June, as rain.  Summer 

precipitation occurs mostly as scattered showers and thunderstorms, making only a minor 

contribution to overall precipitation.  The effect of climate on operations is minimal.  

Approximately two shifts per year are lost due to weather. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The Goldstrike Mine is located in a major mining region and local resources including labour, 

water, power, natural gas, and local infrastructure for transportation of supplies are well 

established.  The majority of the workforce lives in the nearby towns of Elko, Spring Creek, 

Carlin, and Battle Mountain. 

 

The water for process and mining is delivered from dewatering production wells.  The water 

supply is more than adequate for present and planned requirements.  Active dewatering 

operations are required and a water management group is in place to carry out all 

dewatering including pumping, distribution, delivery, and disposal.   

 

Barrick built a 115 MW natural gas-fired power plant near Reno, Nevada that became 

operational in the fourth quarter of 2005.  This allows Goldstrike the flexibility to provide 

power through a combination of self-generation and market purchases.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 5-2 

Natural gas is delivered via a natural gas pipeline.  The natural gas pipeline is a continuation 

of the North Elko Pipeline (NEP) that is a lateral of the Ruby Pipe Line and extends to a 

metering station at the fence line of the Goldstrike Mine property.  The new pipeline starts at 

the main metering station located at the southeast corner of the Goldstrike Mine.  The 

pipeline terminates at several locations where major pieces of equipment are located within 

the Autoclave and Roaster facilities.  

 

An integral part of the work was the conversion of all major consumers from propane-fired to 

natural gas-fired service.  Conversion includes burners, burner controls, and two sub 

metering flow/pressure regulation stations where gas parameters are adjusted to an 

operating range.  The entire four miles of pipeline has been constructed within the fence line 

of the Goldstrike Mine property. 

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
The surface rights secured for the Goldstrike Mine are sufficient to provide the necessary 

space required for all mining and quarrying activities.  Enough land area also exists on the 

property to accommodate all foreseeable processing plants, ore and stockpiles, tailings 

impoundments, and waste disposal areas. 

 

Currently, the major assets and facilities associated with the Goldstrike Mine are: 

• Underground and open pit mines with production from several mineralized zones. 
 

• The physical plant site including the administrative office complex and associated 
facilities, the open pit and underground mine workings and associated facilities, ore 
processing plants (autoclave pressure oxidation and roaster circuit) and associated 
facilities such as laboratories, ore stockpiles, waste dumps, coarse ore storage, 
tailings storage, workshops, and warehouses. 

 
• Facilities providing basic infrastructure to the mine, including electric power, water 

treatment and supply, and sewage treatment. 
 

• Surface and underground infrastructure including mine ramps, headframes, hoists, 
ventilation raises, maintenance shops, and mobile equipment fleets. 

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
The Goldstrike property is located in the Great Basin of north central Nevada, USA.  The 

mine is at an elevation of approximately 5,600 ft in the hilly terrain of the Tuscarora 

Mountains with elevations varying from 5,400 ft to 6,000 ft in the immediate area.

The combination of topography and a mid-latitude steppe climate, common to the Great 

Basin, has produced grass and shrub dominated vegetation.  Disturbances to the vegetation, 

including overgrazing, large-scale range fires of the 1960s, past and present mining 

operations, and mineral exploration have converted much of the remaining native vegetation 

within the area to early non-native annuals, sagebrush, and rabbit brush.  Riparian 

vegetation exists in association with perennial stream flow in Bell, Brush, and Rodeo Creeks, 

as well as near springs located throughout the Little Boulder Basin.

6 HISTORY 
The following history of the Goldstrike Mine property owned by Barrick was obtained from 

Keith Bettles' report (Bettles, 2002). 

 

The earliest gold mining activity in the northern part of the Carlin Trend occurred at the 

Bootstrap and Blue Star mines prior to the discovery of gold at the Goldstrike Mine property.  

At Bootstrap, just northwest of the Goldstrike Mine, antimony was discovered in 1918, 

followed by gold in 1946.  Gold was produced at the Bootstrap during 1957 to 1960.  At Blue 

Star, immediately south of the Goldstrike Mine, gold was identified in 1957 in areas that had 

been mined for turquoise.  At the Goldstrike Mine, the only evidence of early mining activities 

is small workings for mercury of unknown age, located along the Post fault zone, south of the 

Meikle deposit. 

 

The first discovery of gold in the Goldstrike Mine property was in 1962 by Atlas Minerals.  

Soil samples and drilling discovered low-grade gold mineralization.  No further work was 

conducted until an increase in gold price was seen in 1973 to 1974, which led the Nevada 

Syndicate (funded by Lac Minerals) to re-evaluate the area.  Using various exploration 

methods, shallow mineralization in the Long Lac and Winston areas was outlined.  Polar 

Resources (Polar) in 1975, followed by Pancana Minerals Ltd. (Pancana) from 1976 to 1977, 

delineated the Number 9 deposit and several low-grade zones within the Goldstrike intrusion 

to the east of Nevada Syndicate property.  From 1975 to 1977, Polar and Pancana operated 

a small open pit and heap leach. 

 

In 1978, WSMC entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Pancana, which had consolidated the 

various claims and leases in the Goldstrike Mine area.  The bulk of the production was from 

oxidized zones, chiefly from the Long Lac, Bazza, and West Bazza deposits, plus some 

production from deposits within the Goldstrike intrusion.  The Post deposit was discovered in 

1982.  Exploration continued until 1986 when a deep core hole was drilled at Post and the 

Deep Post deposit was discovered.   

 

American Barrick Resources Corporation acquired the mine and properties from WSMC 

(50%) in December 1986 and subsequently purchased Pancana's interest (50%) in January 

1987 for a total purchase price of $62 million.  An aggressive deep drilling program outlined

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 6-2 

the large, high-grade Deep Post deposit, which was subsequently found to continue onto the 

adjacent property owned by Newmont.  Exploration drilling in 1987 to 1988 led to the 

discovery of a number of other deposits similar to Deep Post.  These included Betze and 

Screamer which, together with Deep Post, comprise the Betze-Post deposit.  Other 

discoveries in 1987 and 1988 included Deep Star, Rodeo, Meikle (previously named Purple 

Vein), South Meikle, and Griffin. 

  

Additional drilling in 1987 and 1988 expanded the reserve to justify bringing the Betze-Post 

deposit into production by open pit methods.  Even though the deposit was deep, the size 

and grade allowed for economic development.  Heap leach ore production from the Betze-

Post pit continued from the time of purchase to the end of 1998.  Oxide mill ore processing 

started in August 1988 and the autoclave portion of the mill, which oxidizes sulphide ores, 

commenced operation in early 1990.  The processing of ores by the roaster began in 2000. 

 

The Meikle deposit, formerly known as the Purple Vein, is located approximately 1.5 mi 

north-northwest of Barrick's Betze-Post deposit and is currently in production.  The deposit is 

approximately 800 ft to 2,000 ft below the surface.  Although there is very little gold at the 

surface above the Meikle, Rodeo/Goldbug, and Griffin deposits, there is extensive 

silicification of the rocks along fault zones and a weak arsenic anomaly has been detected in 

soil samples.  The Meikle deposit was discovered in September 1989 when the tenth deep 

drill hole EX-89-4 intersected 540 ft of 0.41 oz/st Au from 1,305 ft to 1,845 ft.  This hole was 

targeted at an inferred structural intersection associated with induced polarization (IP) 

geophysical and soil geochemistry anomalies.  Gold mineralization is absent at surface (in 

contrast to the Betze-Post deposit), although the area was the site of small-scale mercury 

workings in the 1940s.  

 

Discovery of the Rodeo and Griffin deposits were part of the original deep exploration 

program.  Both predate the discovery of Meikle.  The discovery of the Rodeo deposit was in 

June 1988 and Griffin in July 1988.  Their development since discovery has been 

significantly aided by the knowledge gained from the Meikle mine and from the underground 

access from the Meikle mine.   

 

The 1999 Asset Exchange with Newmont resulted in the acquisition of the Goldbug (the 

southern portion of Rodeo), West Rodeo, Barrel, and North Post deposits.  These deposits

were in the Newmont land corridor separating the Betze-Post and Meikle mines.  The 

Banshee property north of the Meikle was also part of the exchange.

Production at the Goldstrike Mine has varied on an annual basis with the largest annual 

variance in production being the open pit mining, where ore production is a function of the 

ore availability in the pit.  The large annual variance is smoothed through the use of 

stockpiles.  The total gold production at the Goldstrike Mine since 1987 is shown in Table 6-

3.  The difference between the contained gold mined and the gold production from the plant 

is a combination of metallurgical recovery, variations in the grade of material taken from 

stockpiles, and other minor items.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Goldstrike Mine is located in the eastern Great Basin (Basin and Range Province) within 

the northern Carlin Trend on the western flank of the Tuscarora Mountains.  The Carlin Trend 

is an alignment of gold mines located in a northwest-southeast belt extending five miles wide 

and 40 mi long, which accounts for more gold production than any other mining district in the 

United States.  The northern trends account for in excess of twenty gold mines and deposits.  

 

Two regionally recognized assemblages comprise the sedimentary strata of northeastern 

Nevada (Figure 7-1).  The western or siliciclastic assemblage consists of mudstone, chert, 

siltstone, and minor limestone and includes imbricate thrust slices of Devonian Slaven, 

Silurian Elder, and Ordovician Vinini Formations.  The eastern assemblage of carbonate 

rocks consists of calcareous mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the Rodeo Creek Unit, 

muddy limestone of the Devonian Popovich Formation, silty limestone to massive 

fossiliferous limestone of the Silurian-Devonian Roberts Mountains Formation, sandy 

dolomite of the Ordovician Hanson Creek Formation, quartzite of the Ordovician Eureka 

Quartzite, and limestone, cherty limestone, and dolomite of the Ordovician Pogonip Group. 

 

Jurassic quartz diorite, as plugs, sills, and dikes, has intruded the Paleozoic sedimentary 

rocks.  Contact metamorphism affects the sedimentary rocks adjacent to the larger igneous 

bodies and is evident in the formation of marble, calc-silicates, hornfels, and skarn.  Dikes 

and sills of Jurassic monzonite and lamprophyre, and Tertiary dacite and rhyodacites, are 

mapped in the area.  Miocene rhyolite flows occur to the west in Boulder Valley.  Tuffaceous 

fluvial and lacustrine semi-consolidated sediments of the Tertiary Carlin Formation and 

Quaternary alluvium unconformably top the stratigraphic section.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-3 

The Antler orogeny extensively deformed Paleozoic rocks of the Great Basin in Nevada and 

western Utah during Late Devonian and Early Mississippian time.  In the late Devonian some 

350 million years B.P., the Antler volcanic island arc terrane collided with what was then the 

west coast of North America and the North American Plate.  The collision zone is marked by 

the Carlin Trend and the Roberts Mountains Thrust.  The siliciclastic rocks were thrust 

eastward over the carbonate rocks during the Antler Orogeny (Roberts Mountains Thrust).  

Mesozoic compressional deformation was also important regionally as indicated by various 

east and west as well as north-northeast and south-southwest verging thrusts.  Tertiary 

faulting developed basins and ranges with the former subsequently filled with volcanics and 

sediments during Tertiary time.  Gold mineralization occurred at the onset of Tertiary 

volcanism, approximately 39 million years ago. 

 

The stratigraphic section is cut by a series of north-northwest, northwest, northeast and 

north-northeast striking high and low-angle faults with extensive fracturing, brecciation, and 

folding.  These faults both control and displace mineralization, with evidence for both dip-slip 

and oblique-slip displacements.  Jurassic and Tertiary intrusives utilized both high and low 

angle faults as they intruded the Paleozoic section.  Cenozoic Basin and Range deformation 

most likely reactivated many of faults in the area.   

 

In terms of their regional tectonic setting, the Carlin Trend gold deposits are hosted in 

carbonate rocks within a thick sequence of Paleozoic miogeoclinal sedimentary rocks 

coincident with: 

1) the thinned western margin of the North American craton in early Paleozoic times; 

2) the west-central portion of the Lower Devonian Antler foreland basin; 

3) the east edge of deformation related to the late Paleozoic Humboldt orogeny; 

4) Jurassic plutonism, metamorphism and deformation; 

5) the hinterland of the early Tertiary Sevier orogenic belt; and 

6) the broad zone of Eocene to Miocene calc alkaline magmatism and tectonic 
extension that occurred throughout much of the Great Basin.   

 

The collision between Antler terrane and the North America plate induced higher crustal 

temperatures and pressures which produced numerous hot springs along the suture zone.  

Several episodes of subsurface magmatism are known to have occurred subsequent to the 

collision.  During these episodes, and particularly during the Eocene epoch, hydrothermal 

fluids brought dissolved minerals toward the surface, precipitating them out along fissures.

Among these minerals were gold and silver.  Most of the largest gold deposits lie within 350 

ft of the Roberts Mountain Thrust at the base of the allochthon.  Geochronologic study 

indicates that most of the gold in the Carlin Trend was emplaced over a short interval of time 

between approximately 42 and 36 Ma.  Analyses of the sulphosalt galkhaite from the Rodeo 

deposit at the Goldstrike Mine have yielded a mineralization age of 39.8 ± 0.6 Ma. 

 

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

OPEN PIT 
At the Betze-Post open pit, the stratigraphic sequence from the base is as follows: 

Ordovician Vinini Formation siltstones, mudstones and cherts; Silurian-Devonian Roberts 

Mountains Formation silty/fossiliferous/laminated limestones and sedimentary breccias; 

Devonian Popovich limestones, limey mudstones and sedimentary breccias; and Devonian 

Rodeo Creek siltstones and argillites (Figures 7-2 and 7-3).  These formations have been 

intruded by the Goldstrike stock and other Jurassic diorite dikes and sills as well as by 

Tertiary dikes and sills.  The Vinini Formation rocks, which lie mostly east of the pit, have 

been thrust over the younger units along the Roberts Mountains Thrust that is exposed in the 

wall of the Betze-Post open pit.  Unconformably overlying the older units are volcaniclastic 

sedimentary rocks, tuffs, and gravels of the Tertiary-aged Carlin Formation in turn succeeded 

by Quaternary alluvium. 

 

The Slaven, Elder, and Vinini Formations contain similar lithologies and are usually 

collectively referred to as the Vinini Formation.  The regional Roberts Mountains Thrust fault 

separates the Vinini Formation and the Rodeo Creek Unit.  The Rodeo Creek Unit has been 

subdivided into four units: (1) a lower calcareous mudstone-argillite unit; (2) a calcareous 

sandstone unit; (3) a calcareous mudstone, siltstone, and argillite unit; and (4) an upper 

carbonaceous limestone unit. 

 

The Popovich Formation is subdivided into four units: (1) the lower Wispy Unit, which 

consists of wispy laminated muddy to silty limestone with abundant interbedded debris flows; 

(2) the planar unit consisting of thin planar bedded muddy limestone, (3) the soft-sediment 

deformation unit of thick to medium bedded muddy to micritic limestone with occasional soft-

sediment deformation features, and (4) the upper muddy limestone unit consisting of thin to 

medium bedded muddy limestone.

The Roberts Mountains Formation is subdivided by a facies change from north to south.  In 

the south, from the Betze-Post open pit through the Rodeo underground mine, a thin bedded, 

planar laminated silty limestone basinal facies predominates with an upper coarse wispy 

laminated horizon.  To the north of the Rodeo underground mine, the Bootstrap massive 

fossiliferous limestone is present.  This facies relationship reflects a Roberts Mountains high 

related to reef development along the Paleozoic continental margin.  The Popovich 

Formation thins to the north in response to the Roberts Mountains high, and both the 

Popovich and the Roberts Mountains units show local facies transitions with the Bootstrap 

limestone.  At Betze-Post through Rodeo, there is a full section of Popovich, however, at the 

north end of Meikle, only the upper member of the Popovich is present.  The Roberts 

Mountains high at Meikle has been accentuated by high and low angle reverse faulting. 

 

The Hanson Creek Formation is a medium to thick bedded to massive dolomite to sandy 

dolomite.  Drilling to date on the property has intercepted only the top of the Hanson Creek 

Formation.  The Eureka quartzite thickness ranges from a massive to thinly bedded 

orthoquartzite with local lenses of dolomite.  The Pogonip Group contains thin to thick 

bedded limestone, cherty limestone, and dolomite.  The Eureka quartzite and Pogonip Group 

have not been intercepted with drilling on the property, but occur in outcrop to the southeast. 

 
ALTERATION 
Pre-mineralization alteration includes dolomitization of limestones and migration and 

maturation of hydrocarbons.  Jurassic intrusive rocks are extensively sericitized, which may 

be due to retrograde metasomatic alteration in a pre-mineralization Mesozoic hydrothermal 

event.  From east to west, the Deep Post is affected by argillic alteration, the Betze deposit 

by decarbonatization of its upper zone and silicification of the lower zone, with similar, but 

weaker alteration affecting the Screamer deposit.  Decalcification produced extensive zones 

of permeable collapse breccias, ground preparation for hydrothermal fluids and gold bearing 

pyrite mineralization.  Ore stage alteration was accompanied by illite and quartz deposition 

followed by late quartz and kaolinite.   

 
STRATIGRAPHY AND STRUCTURE 
Structures on the property record a complex history of contractional and extensional 

tectonics and later reactivation during successive periods of deformation.  Stratigraphic 

formations have gentle dips except in the vicinity of high angle faults and along the western 



www.rpacan.com

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-8 

margin of the Goldstrike stock where bedding may be steeper.  Mesozoic folding and thrust 

faults form important structural traps for the mineralization in the Betze-Post open pit. 

 

The strata are cut by a series of Tertiary north-northwest, northwest, northeast, and north-

northeast striking high and low angle faults accompanied by extensive fracturing, brecciation, 

and drag folding.  Primary high angle faults strike north-northwest and dip east and west.  

Secondary faults strike east to east-northeast and dip north.  These faults both control and 

displace mineralization, with evidence for both dip-slip and oblique-slip displacements.  The 

structure with the most mineralization offset in the district is the Post Fault Zone, which is 

approximately 250 ft wide, and has over 2,000 ft of normal displacement at Betze-Post open 

pit and approximately 1,300 ft of normal displacement to the north at the Meikle deposit.  

Cenozoic faulting created basins up to 1000 ft deep, east of the Post Fault, which were then 

filled by the clastic and volcaniclastic sediments of the Carlin Formation. 

 

Gold mineralization in the open pit occurs at fault intersections as well as where faults 

intersect anticlinal fold axes in decalcified rocks such as sedimentary and collapse breccias 

in the lower Popovich limestone. 

 

UNDERGROUND 
As in the Open Pit, the geology of the underground deposits is characterized by two regional 

lithologic assemblages: (1) the "eastern" or carbonate assemblage of the Devonian Popovich 

and Silurian-Devonian Roberts Mountains Formations, and (2) the transitional Rodeo Creek 

Formation (Figure 7-4). The allochthonous western assemblage, which includes the 

Ordovician Vinini, Silurian Elder, and Slaven Chert Formations, is also present, however, at 

this time it is not known to host any underground ore bodies. 

 

A brief description of the formations starting from the base and moving upwards is taken from 

Linebarger (2010): 

 

• Roberts Mountains Formation:  Underlies most of the property and is mineralized 
when strongly brecciated or intersected by structural features. The Roberts 
Mountains Formation is predominantly a thin-bedded silty limestone, which is locally 
dolomitic. This limestone transforms into shallow water reef and shoal facies 
informally termed the Bootstrap Limestone to the north and northeast.  The 
Bootstrap Limestone at Meikle occurs as a series of structural highs, upon which the 
Popovich and Rodeo Creek Formations were deposited in an overall progradational

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-9 

environment. Gold mineralization is hosted primarily in rocks derived from the 
Bootstrap Limestone. 
 

• Popovich Formation:  The Popovich Formation is a major host for gold 
mineralization, particularly in the southern mining areas such as the Rodeo deposit.  
Rocks of the Popovich setting are typically carbonaceous, somewhat permeable, 
and are part of a marine slope facies.  They were products of a shallower water 
depositional environment than the Vinini Formation and the other western 
assemblage siliciclastics.  This formation overlies the Roberts Mountains Formation 
and is subdivided into four distinct units (described from base): 
o Wispy (WS): The dominant mineralization host in the Rodeo Lower Zone.  It is 

a grey silty limestone with distinct undulation laminations intercalated with 
debris flow horizons.  A clast supported collapse breccia often occurs near the 
base. 

o Planar Laminated (PL): A minor mineralization host in the Rodeo Lower Zone, 
but the predominant host of the Barrel Zone.  It is a black to dark grey, fine 
grained, variably calcareous, and fossiliferous mudstone. 

o Soft Sediment Deformation (SD):  Light grey, thickly bedded micritic limestone 
that hosts some of the Barrel mineralization and is a minor host to the Rodeo 
Upper Zone.  It displays distinctive swirled bedding, but the base can be 
fresher and better bedded than upper sections. 

o Upper Mud (UM):  The Upper Mud is the dominant host for Rodeo Upper Zone 
mineralization, for mineralized lamprophyre dykes in the South Meikle Zone, 
and for west dipping dykes in the South Griffin Zone.  Characterized by finely 
bedded limey mudstone, it is interlayered near the upper contact with 
mudstone beds.  There are sub-units of finely disseminated pyritic lamina and 
cherty and debris flow lenses. 
 

• Rodeo Creek Formation:  Overlies the Popovich Formation and underlies the 
Roberts Mountains Thrust (RMT).  This formation is represented by a sequence of 
argillites and a locally mineralized package of silts and sandstones (Bazza Sand). 
The rocks of the Rodeo Creek are slightly calcareous, but much less so than those 
rocks of the carbonate assemblage and represent a deep water transitional facies 
between the eastern and western assemblages.  It is the host to the Griffin and 
Griffin West zones.  It is divided into three units (described from base to top). 
o Lower Argillite (AM):  The generally barren Lower Argillite unit could host 

narrow mineralization within silty interbeds if intersected by favourable 
structures.  Composed of thick layers of fine to medium grained carboniferous 
mudstone and siltstone alternating with thin layers of fine grained siliceous 
mudstone. 

o Bazza Sands (BS):  The Bazza Sands unit forms the main host for the East 
Griffin and West-Griffin deposits.  It is composed of well bedded siltstone and 
sandstone beds and typically contains a narrow sub-unit of argillite called the 
Middle Argillite. 

o Upper Argillite (AA):  A poor host for mineralization, the Upper Argillite shares 
characteristics with the Lower Argillite, but with thinner bedding. 
 

• Intrusive rocks:  Jurassic-aged Rhyodacite Porphyry (MP), lamprophyre (LA) and 
Tertiary Rhyodacite Biotite Feldspar Porphyry (BFP) dykes and sills occur at various 
orientations.  The MP and BFP host no significant mineralization.  Mineralization is 
found in or near east and west dipping LA, the South Meikle Extension, South-
Griffin, and the Rodeo Upper and Lower Zones.

STRUCTURE 
The fracturing, brecciation, folding, and mineralization observed underground is primarily 

controlled by high angle north-northwest and north-northeast trending fault systems.  The 

most prominent system is the Post Fault Zone (PFZ) that strikes N30ºW and dips steeply to 

the east.  The PFZ is a normal fault that down-drops the formations hundreds of feet and 

marks the eastern edge of known mineralization from Banshee to Betze-Post.  North-

northwest striking and west-northwest striking low angle faults also influence ore 

emplacement. 

 

MINERALIZATION 
Gold mineralization was emplaced approximately 39 Ma ago along favourable stratigraphy 

and structural features such as faults and folds, and along contacts between sedimentary 

rocks and the Goldstrike stock.  Faulting provided major conduits for mineralizing fluids and 

may also have produced clay alteration that may have acted as a barrier to mineralizing 

fluids.  Intense fracturing around the contact zone of the Goldstrike stock caused solution 

collapse and brecciation of the surrounding sedimentary units.  Secondary fracture 

permeability was generated along the crests of anticlines, creating focal points for collapse 

breccia and dissolution zone formation.  Finally, lithology and alteration contacts act as 

permeability barriers to fluids causing mineralization to pond along them particularly where 

feeder structures intersect these contacts.  Alteration is characterized by decalcification of 

limestone, silicification of all rock types, and clay development in structurally disturbed areas.  

 

The gold mineralization is associated with silicification, argillization, and sulphide 

mineralization with little or no oxide mineralization remaining.  In sulphide ore, the gold is 

intimately associated with very fine-grained pyrite and marcasite and is refractory.  Over 

time, the pyrite oxidized, freeing the gold and making its extraction relatively easy, as in the 

historic Post Oxide deposit.  Associated sulphide minerals include arsenopyrite, realgar, 

orpiment, and stibnite.  Gangue minerals include quartz, calcite, and barite.  Realgar and 

orpiment are generally low in abundance; however, these minerals are locally common in 

stockwork veinlets, fracture fillings, and breccia matrices. 

 

OPEN PIT 
The Betze-Post deposit, the largest on the Carlin Trend, is divided into sub-deposits which, 

from east to west, are the Deep Post, Post, Betze, West Betze, and Screamer. Other zones

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-12 

within the pit are North Betze, West Barrel, and North Screamer.  The locations of the 

mineralized zones are illustrated in Figure 7-5. 

 

Five generations of pyrite mineralization have been recognized at the Betze-Post open pit.  

Early stages of diagenetic pyrite, and coarse grained pyrite in the metamorphic aureole of the 

Goldstrike diorite, are barren.  Early hydrothermal, very fine grained pyrite and marcasite 

grains of the third generation are coated by a 25 µm thick rind and cut by micro-veinlets of 

arsenic and gold bearing pyrite of the fourth generation.  Barren, late hydrothermal coarse 

grained pyrite and marcasite is accompanied by barite and stibnite.  Sulphides make up 

approximately 5% by weight of the ore, locally up to 20%.   

 

The gold bearing arsenian pyrite may be subdivided into coarse grained sulphides at ±200 

µm diameter and fined grained at 10 µm to 20 µm, with the latter carrying proportionately 

much more gold.  Gold at 0.05 µm to 0.1 µm is occluded in the iron sulphides.  Approximately 

10% to 20% of the gold is free, 20% to 30% is held in the fine grained pyrite/marcasite, a few 

percent is contained in coarse pyrite, and the balance is in very fine pyrite associated with 

clay.  

 

Mineralization types are described by Leonardson and Rahn (1996) as: 

• Disseminated carbonaceous mineralization, sulphide breccia, and siliceous 
sulphide breccias in the decalcified Popovich limestone consisting of 
carbonaceous siltstone and grey breccia with quartz veining and marcasite blebs 
accompanied by high values of Hg, Cr, Zn, and Cu.  This type of mineralization 
occurs as an upper tabular zone of the Popovich Formation and carries high gold 
grades.  

 
• Siliceous stibnite breccia mineralization in limestone occurs as tabular zones up 

to 300 ft long and 150 ft thick and is characterized by partially brecciated, silicified 
limestone with disseminated pyrite and late stibnite occurring as coatings on 
pyrite and fractures and as vein and vug fillings with barite.  This type is rich in Sb 
with moderate Hg, Tl, As, Ba, and Zn.   

 
• Seam mineralization is rich in realgar and orpiment and occurs as dark decalcified 

fractures and argillaceous zones in blocks of sheared marble and calc-silicate 
rocks at the Goldstrike intrusive margin.

Late stage mineralization is characterized by stibnite and barite in silicified zones and 

realgar, orpiment, calcite, marcasite, and rare fluorite in argillized zones.  Other late stage 

minerals are pyrite, marcasite, gypsum, apatite, siderite, dolomite, sphalerite, and millerite.   

 

Carbon content in the deposits is highly variable and carbon occurs generally in the Popovich 

Formation, except in the east area of the pit where it is removed or destroyed by contact 

metamorphism along the Goldstrike intrusive.  

 

Mineralization may be predominantly oxides, sulphides, or refractory or carbonaceous 

sulphides.  Supergene alteration extends up to 655 ft in depth resulting in oxide 

mineralization, which overlies the refractory sulphides.  Alteration has liberated gold by the 

destruction of pyrite and resulted in the formation of oxide and secondary sulphate minerals, 

which include goethite, hematite, jarosite, scorodite, alunite, and gypsum.  The alteration is 

deepest in the Post deposit due to extensive fracturing and high pyrite content. 

 

UNDERGROUND 
Gold mineralization in the underground mine is subdivided into Banshee, Meikle, South 

Meikle, (East) Griffin, Extension, West Griffin, Rodeo, Barrel, West Rodeo, and North Post 

deposits and sub-deposits (Figure 7-6).  The sulphide mineralization is associated with 

silicification and argillization, and there is little or no oxide mineralization.  In sulphide 

mineralization, the gold is intimately associated with very fine-grained pyrite and marcasite.  

Associated sulphide minerals include arsenopyrite, realgar, orpiment, and stibnite.  Gangue 

minerals include quartz, calcite, and barite.  Realgar and orpiment are generally low in 

abundance; however, these minerals are locally common in stockwork veinlets, fracture 

fillings, and breccia matrices. 

 

The orientation of the mineralization is different in each zone.  Meikle, Meikle-East, 

Extension, Rodeo, and East-Griffin are characterized by steep and shallow angle east-

dipping mineralization.  South Griffin and part of Lower Rodeo are more moderately west 

dipping.  South Meikle, West Griffin, and Barrel mineralization are relatively flat lying.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-16 

MEIKLE 
Hydrothermal and collapse breccias in the Bootstrap Limestone member of the Roberts 

Mountains Formation, and to a lesser extent, the Popovich Formation are the dominant host 

for gold mineralization at Meikle.  Breccia geometries are complex, with multiple breccia 

types observed.  Mineralization is predominantly hosted in a breccia derived from a zone of 

dolomitic alteration that mantles the Bootstrap Limestone.  Dolomite and other carbonate rich 

rocks occurring within the host breccia have been completely digested and replaced by silica.  

The gold enriched pyrite is disseminated throughout the siliceous breccia host.  A rhyodacite 

dike, which pre-dates mineralization, also occurs in the Main Zone.  

 

The Meikle deposit is divided into five distinct zones: Main Zone, East Zone, Meikle 

Extension, South Meikle, and the Lamprophyre Zone.  The Main Zone, East Zone, and 

Meikle Extension parallel the PFZ and exhibit pipe-like geometry, which dip steeply to the 

east.  The South Meikle and Lamprophyre zones have a flatter geometry with a possible 

stratigraphic component along the Rodeo Creek-Popovich contact.  A second component 

exhibits a pipe-like geometry, which dips 50o to 75o west. 

  

The Main Zone parallels the PFZ and strikes N30°W.  It has a strike length of 1,200 ft, an 

average thickness of approximately 300 ft, and extends from the 4,600 ft to the 3,200 ft 

elevation.  The host breccias occur between a rhyodacite porphyry dike in the hanging wall 

and a block of Bootstrap Limestone in the footwall.  These breccias are highly silicified and 

pyritized.  Locally, large unmineralized dolomite blocks occur within the breccia, which often 

divide the mineralized zones.  The mineralization proximal to the limestone footwall is very 

high grade in the dolomite breccias, dropping to low grade in the hanging wall rhyodacite 

dike. 

 

The N30ºW striking East Zone mineralization occurs south of where the Post Fault is cut by 

northeast faults.  It extends from the 4,400 ft to 3,300 ft elevation, with a strike length of 700 

ft and an average thickness of approximately 80 ft.  The zone contains several rhyodacite, 

dacite, and lamprophyre dikes with highly silicified and pyritized breccias similar to the Main 

Zone.  The similar orientation and alteration of footwall breccias allowed for the incorporation 

of the East Zone into the Main Zone model. 

 

The South Meikle Zone is subparallel to and west of the East Zone, over a strike length of 

1,400 ft.  It has a relatively shallow dip and extends from 4,350 ft to 4,650 ft elevation, with 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-17 

an average thickness of approximately 50 ft.  It is located directly above and west of the 

Bootstrap Limestone structural block.  Economic grade mineralization occurs in lamprophyre 

bodies, adjacent silicified breccias, and on the west side also in the Bazza Sands unit.  

Lamprophyre dikes were emplaced along moderate to high angle structures and locally 

follow bedding and/or contacts within carbon rich Popovich and overlying Rodeo Creek 

mudstone and siltstone. 

 

The Meikle Extension Zone represents the southeast portion of the deposit and parallels the 

Post Fault system.  It is discontinuous over a 1,500 ft strike length, with an average thickness 

of approximately 40 ft and extends from 4,400 ft to 3,200 ft elevation.  This zone marks the 

transition between the wide and high grade breccia lenses to the north and the East Griffin 

North Zone to the south.  The mineralization is similar to that observed in the East Zone to 

the north, however, it is higher grade and becomes hosted in an east dipping lamprophyre 

dike further south.  This lamprophyre dike is the footwall of an east dipping barren biotite-

feldspar porphyry dike.  The host rocks and limited thickness distinguish the Meikle 

Extension Zone from the East Zone. 

 

The Lamprophyre Zone is the extension of the South Meikle Zone through and above the 

Main Zone, shows a north-northeast trend, and has been incorporated into the west dipping 

South Meikle model.  The average thickness of this zone is approximately 30 ft, from 

elevation 4,650 ft to 4,400 ft, and along a strike length of 550 ft.  The Lamprophyre Zone has 

a flat lying stratigraphic component along and underneath the Rodeo Creek-Popovich 

contact.  A second component exhibits a pipe-like geometry and dipping of 50o to 75o to the 

west.  This second component splits the Main Zone in two lenses in the west sector of this 

deposit. 

 
GRIFFIN 
The Griffin deposit includes four geologically distinct domains: Breccia-hosted (formerly 

described as the North Griffin), Bazza Sands (formerly described as the Griffin Main Zone), 

West Griffin, and the Lamprophyre Zone.  Each zone contains typical Carlin-style gold 

mineralization hosted in fine-grained iron sulphides.  Silica-replaced breccias similar to those 

at Meikle, calcarenites, and lamprophyre are the various host rocks, each dominant in its 

respective domain.  Feeder, boundary, and offsetting structures are the primary controls to 

mineralization in every case throughout Griffin.  

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-18 

The Griffin Breccia-hosted domain contains similar rocks as the Meikle East Zone.  It extends 

from elevation 4,400 ft to 3,200 ft, with an average thickness of approximately 50 ft and a 

strike length of 900 ft.  Limestones of the Popovich Formation, and possibly of the Bootstrap 

unit, comprise the main source of clasts which constitute the heterolithic mineralized breccia 

body.  Rhyodacite dikes bound the breccia to the east and the Barite Fault separates the 

breccia-hosted mineralization from the Bazza Sands-hosted mineralization on the west.  

Rhyodacite and lamprophyre clasts are also present in the breccia mass to a lesser degree.  

Pervasive silicification normally replaces all protolith fabric. Mineralization weakens to the 

south.  

 

The Griffin Bazza Sands-hosted domain comprises the bulk of Griffin mineralization and 

occurs southwest of the Barite Fault in a flat-lying, 250 ft to 300 ft thick silty to sandy facies of 

the Rodeo Creek Unit called the Bazza Sands.  This stratigraphic member is sandwiched 

between two carbonaceous mudstone horizons locally called "argillite".  Mineralization is 

controlled by subvertical structures that are associated with the northwest trending Barite 

Fault.  It is from 30 ft to 65 ft wide, 1,100 ft along strike, and occurs between the 3,700 ft and 

4,500 ft elevation.  The gold content decreases away from the Post Fault Zone. 

  

The West Griffin Domain is also hosted in the Bazza Sands unit of the Rodeo Creek 

Formation.  Minor amounts of mineralization are also hosted by carbonaceous argillites of 

the Rodeo Creek Formation.  The mineralization is controlled by N25°W, 70°NE and N10°E, 

65°NW trending faults, and extensively by northwest trending, east dipping low angle faults 

(Zappa faults).  The host rock is variably decalcified with weak to moderate silicification.  

Quartz veins with strong pyrite and some kaolinite localized along fractures characterize 

alteration within this zone.  The zone has an average thickness of approximately 35 ft, from 

elevation 4,100 ft to 4,700 ft with a strike length of 1,200 ft.  Exploration potential lies to the 

west along the Zappa faults, and north and south along strike with South Meikle and Barrel 

respectively. 

 

Mineralization distribution in the Lamprophyre Zone tracks mainly along the Dormant Fault 

(approximately N25ºW strike, 45º to 65º dip to the SW) and is proximal to bodies of 

lamprophyre.  Mineralization occupies an area between the 3,200 ft and 4,100 ft elevation 

with a strike length 1,700 ft.  Gold occurs in multiple west-dipping lenses that vary in 

thickness from 10 ft to 70 ft.  The Zappa and Post fault systems also demonstrate some 

control on mineralization, particularly where these patterns intersect the Dormant Fault.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 7-19 

Lamprophyre is the chief host lithology with minor dissemination into the Popovich Formation 

country rock.  Economical grade mineralization is not ubiquitous within the lamprophyre rock, 

but appears to favour conspicuous regions of intense alteration. 

 
RODEO  
The Rodeo deposit is located approximately 4,500 ft south of the Meikle underground mine 

and 3,600 ft north of the Betze-Post open pit.  

 

Economical grade mineralization occurs in two zones in the Rodeo area, the Upper and 

Lower zones. The combined dimensions of the two zones have a strike length of 2,300 ft.  

The zones extend from the elevation of 3,500 ft to 4,700 ft, with a true thickness of 100 ft to 

200 ft.   

 

The Upper Zone consists of four subzones: the Upper North, Middle, Upper South, and West 

subzones.  The Upper Zone lies within a stratigraphic and structural antiform that has a 

shallow plunge to the north-northeast. Mineralization is hosted in the Upper Mud, Soft 

Sediment Deformation, and Planar units of the Popovich Formation as well as Jurassic 

lamprophyre dikes.  The morphology of the mineralized zone is dictated, in order of 

significance, by the proximity to favourable feeder structures, receptive lithologies, and 

structural preparation.   

 

The Lower Zone occurs in the Wispy Unit of the Popovich Formation.  The Wispy Unit in 

Rodeo is characterized by laminated limestone, debris flow horizons, and local collapse 

breccia zones associated with structural intersections and discontinuous lamprophyre dikes.  

The morphology of the zone is strongly influenced by the proximity of through-going 

northwest striking faults, north-northeast striking feeder faults, and favourable lithology. 

 
BARREL  
The Barrel mineralized zone is a tabular body located 200 ft northwest to approximately 

1,000 ft west-northwest of the Rodeo deposit, between the 3,900 ft and 4,200 ft elevation.  It 

has a strike length of 1,600 ft along a N30ºW orientation and varies in thickness from 30 ft to 

50 ft.  It is hosted mainly in the Planar unit of the Popovich Formation, with minor values 

within the overlying Sediment Deformation unit, as well as in the underlying Wispy unit at the 

south end of the zone.  The zone is bounded by a series of low and high angle east dipping 

structures, and is also partly controlled by west dipping lamprophyre dikes.

BANSHEE  
The East Banshee deposit is located 1,800 ft to 3,000 ft north of the Meikle deposit, between 

3,200 ft and 3,900 ft elevation.  The general orientation of high grade mineralization is north-

northwest striking and low to moderately northeast dipping.  High grade mineralization 

ranges from 10 ft to 80 ft thick.  Gold mineralization is hosted in faulted or brecciated quartz-

sericite-pyrite altered lamprophyre, silicified brecciated limestone, collapse breccias, and 

brecciated monzonite.  The mineralization is focused on a low to moderate northeast dipping 

lamprophyre filled fault zone (East Banshee Shear Zone).  The multiple intrusive rock types 

that characterize the deposit diverge from this fault zone to the Ren Fault, which is a large 

displacement normal fault with a north-northwest strike and moderate northeast dip.  The 

Ren Fault merges with the Post Fault to the south at the Meikle deposit.  East Banshee high 

grade mineralization is bound both to the east and west by north-northwest striking steep 

east dipping faults (similar to the PFZ at Meikle).  Mineralization along strike is offset by east-

northeast striking, steeply dipping faults.  The strike extent of the high grade mineralization 

appears to be bound to the north and south by east-northeast striking, steeply south dipping 

faults.  The down-dip extent of higher grade mineralization is primarily controlled by the 

intersection of the East Banshee shear zone and Post-parallel faults (hinge zone).  The Post 

Fault is the eastern limit of mineralization.  It appears significant mineralization continues to 

the north.  Additional drilling is required to determine its extent and continuity.  

 

The West Banshee deposit is located between 600 ft northwest and 1,800 ft north-northwest 

of the Meikle deposit, between the 3,900 ft and 4,300 ft elevation.  Gold mineralization is 

hosted in north-northwest trending, moderate to steeply west dipping lamprophyre dikes up 

to 40 ft wide.  The 1,500 ft strike length appears to be offset by subvertical east-northeast 

striking faults.  Continuity along dip appears to be approximately 200 ft at the northern end 

and less than 100 ft at the southern end.  The East Banshee shear zone appears to limit the 

upper and lower extent of high grade mineralization.  Low grade mineralization is relatively 

continuous between East Banshee and West Banshee deposits along the East Banshee 

shear zone. 

 
NORTH POST  
The North Post deposit is located between the southern end of the Rodeo deposit and the 

northeast final wall of the Betze-Post Pit, between the 3,100 ft and 4,600 ft elevation.  North 

Post mineralization can be subdivided in three zones: the Upper Zone, Main Zone, and

Lower Zone.  The Main Zone is partially split by a property boundary with Newmont (Figure 

7-6). 

 

Upper Zone gold mineralization is hosted in the Popovich Formation limestone along west 

dipping lamprophyre filled faults.  The Main Zone is hosted primarily in the Roberts 

Mountains limestone, footwall to the Post Fault, between interpreted moderate east dipping 

reverse faults at intersections with Dormant Fault splays.  The Lower Zone or Deep North 

Post Zone is hosted in the Roberts Mountains Formation limestone, footwall to the Post 

Fault, between interpreted moderate east dipping reverse faults and between splays of the 

Dormant Fault.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The deposit type at the Goldstrike Mine is Carlin style deposit.  Carlin deposits comprise 

stratabound disseminated gold mineralization hosted by Silurian-Devonian carbonate rocks 

that have been metamorphosed to varying extents.  The deposits are hydrothermal in origin 

and are usually structurally controlled.  The carbonate host rocks are part of an 

autochthonous miogeoclinal carbonate sequence exposed as tectonic windows beneath the 

Roberts Mountains allochthon.  The allochthonous rocks are a sequence of lower Paleozoic 

dominantly siliciclastic eugeoclinal rocks that were displaced eastward along the Roberts 

Mountains Thrust over younger units during the Upper Paleozoic Antler orogeny. 

 

Current models attribute the genesis of the deposits to: 

 

• Epizonal plutons that contributed heat and possibly fluids and metals; 
 

• Meteoric fluid circulation resulting from crustal extension and widespread magmatism; 
 

• Metamorphic fluids, possibly with a magmatic contribution, from deep or mid crustal 
levels; 
 

• Upper crustal orogenic-gold processes within an extensional tectonic regime.

9 EXPLORATION 
To date, surface geological mapping and prospecting has been completed on the property, 

with pit mapping on-going.  In excess of 27,000 diamond and reverse circulation (RC) holes 

have been drilled on the property to the end of 2016.  Geochemical soil and rock sampling 

was carried out on the property in early exploration.  Geophysical surveys include airborne 

and ground magnetometer; gravity; time domain pole-dipole IP; DC resistivity; controlled 

source audio magnetotellurics and MT (magnetotellurics); time domain MT/IP using a 

distributed assay system; electrical logging of drill holes; and downhole IP.  Gold 

mineralization is not directly detectable by geophysical methods; however, these surveys 

identify subsurface properties that are useful in interpreting lithology, alteration, and structure 

as guides to gold mineralization.  Aerial photographic surveys are performed every one to 

two years for open pit survey control. 

 

Currently, exploration is exclusively by drilling, which is described in Section 10 Drilling.

10 DRILLING 
In 2012, the Goldstrike Mine Geology Group began handling its own near field exploration 

targeting, which was dubbed MineX exploration.  The MineX program is a system that 

Barrick has for funding of mine exploration through various phases of an exploration 

program; from a high quality reserve definition phase through to an early exploration stage of 

target generation.   

 

OPEN PIT 
The current Mineral Reserves were defined by drilling from 1994 to 2005 with additional in-fill 

and other drilling from 2006 to present.  Most of the drilling prior to 2003 was diamond 

drilling.  Since then, near-pit exploration has been conducted using reverse circulation (RC) 

drilling.  A small diameter Cubex RC drilling rig was introduced in 2012 to drill horizontal 

holes up to 900 ft and vertical holes up to 300 ft to define near pit mineralization and for void 

detection and delineation. 

 

The geometry of mineralization can be highly variable, controlled by fracturing related to 

faulting and folding as well as by favorable stratigraphy and variations in rock chemistry, 

porosity, permeability, bedding habit, etc.  Drilling is done at various angles to structural and 

stratigraphic controls so as to determine true width and thickness of mineralization.  Drill 

sampling and geological interpretations completed prior to mining are generally effective in 

predicting the orientation of mineralization. 

 

The in-pit resource area has been explored by with 100 ft to 175 ft drill spacing.  Drill hole 

spacing through the Betze, West Betze, and Screamer deposits is approximately 150 ft to 

175 ft, and at Post and North Betze is roughly 150 ft.  West Barrel is drilled at roughly 130 ft 

spacing or less and the drill spacing has been reduced to approximately 100 ft for the North 

Screamer Zone.  Some holes did not penetrate the entire ore zone.  Thus, the location of the 

bottom and margins of the ore is not precisely known.  Cubex drilling was used to define the 

margins of the ore and optimize bench plans. 

 

RC drilling (6¼ in.) accounts for approximately two thirds of the drilling, with one third 

diamond drilling at HQ to NQ (2½ in. to 17/8 in.) core diameters.  The database also contains

Mining in the open pit began encountering large voids in late 2011.  In 2012, almost 500 

holes were drilled, primarily with the Cubex rig to locate and define voids so that appropriate 

precautions could be implemented in mining operations.  An additional 544 holes were drilled 

exclusively with the Cubex rig to define voids in 2013.  A void zone of about 800 ft long 

trending into the pit wall with a vertical extent of more than 300 ft before passing into the 

bottom of the pit was encountered in 2012, with smaller associated voids located and 

delineated in late 2012 through 2013.  Void drilling continues, as needed. Holes drilled for 

void definition are not assayed and, therefore, are not used in model estimation. 

 

Planned drill hole collar locations are set out by the open pit surveyors using Trimble High 

Precision GPS to determine the location of every hole and to establish foresights for all angle 

holes.  After the holes are drilled, the surveyors pick up the final collar coordinates using 

GPS.

Downhole surveys are performed on all new exploration drill holes except for shallow vertical 

holes with depths that are less than approximately 300 ft.  Downhole surveys by gyro 

instrumentation are performed under contract by International Directional Services LLC 

(IDS).  Overall, approximately 65% of core drilling at the Goldstrike Mine has been surveyed 

downhole, whereas only approximately 38% of RC drilling has been surveyed for deviation.  

 

UNDERGROUND 
Both RC and diamond drilling are used underground at the Goldstrike Mine.  Over 18,500 

underground holes have been drilled up to December 31, 2016 (Table 10-3) with the majority 

being RC holes.  The drill hole locations are illustrated in Figure 10-2.   

 

The majority of stope definition drilling is performed using RC.  The holes are drilled in areas 

where the geology and mineralization are generally well understood and serve the purpose 

of better defining the ore zones prior to extraction.  Drill hole lengths vary from 50 ft to 600 ft.

For programs categorized as Capital Drilling (defined as drilling of stopes that will not be 

mined in the next two years) and for exploration/step-out drilling, the holes vary in length 

from 150 ft to more than 1,800 ft.  These holes are usually pre-collared using RC and drilled 

as far as ground conditions will permit.  The holes are then switched over to core drilling, 

usually starting with HQ and reducing to NQ as required, to achieve the target depth.  Longer 

holes are given sight lines by underground surveyors based on planned azimuths.  Dips are 

set by the drillers based on the designed collar orientations.  When drilling is complete, the 

collars of the exploration holes are surveyed to determine their final elevation, northing, 

easting, azimuth, and dip.  If circumstances do not allow for survey of the collar, the planned 

location, azimuth, and dip are used.  In the past, several of the longer core and RC holes 

were surveyed with a MAXIBOR downhole survey tool to determine hole deviation.  

Beginning in 2009, a new downhole survey tool, Flexit, was introduced.  This new tool allows 

for the survey of RC holes.  This information is later uploaded to a database where it is used 

in conjunction with the geological and assay data.   

 

Drill spacing is initially done at 100 ft and 50 ft section spacings.  Follow-up RC definition 

drilling is done on fans 25 ft apart, depending on the geologic complexity and continuity.  

Holes are oriented to hit the target at a spacing of 25 ft to 30 ft. 

 

When possible, drill holes are designed for the best possible angle of intersection with 

mineralization.  The apparent thickness of any mineralized intersection varies greatly and is 

dependent on drill station location.  In most instances, the angle will be between 45o and 90o 

to core axis, but in the case of holes reaching for step-out targets, this angle could be 30o or 

lower. 

 

Stope test holes are logged as required.  Core and RC holes are logged for lithology, 

stratigraphy, basic structural data, recovery, alteration, and mineralization.  Core is further 

scrutinized for detailed structural information like faults and bedding angles as well as rock 

mass rating.  This information is entered directly into a geological database and used for 

interpretation of lithologies, structure, alteration, and modelling of mineralized zones.  

Interpretations of drilling results are done continually by the mine geological staff. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the drilling, core handling, and logging protocols are appropriate and are 

being carried out to a reasonable standard.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
Core is washed and photographed prior to logging.  Logging can now be entered directly into 

acQuire by Goldstrike Geologists.  After the logging of open pit holes is completed, the core 

is halved with a diamond saw and sampled in five foot intervals.  Underground core samples 

are whole core.  Samples are placed in a sample bag with a barcode that clearly identifies 

the hole number and the starting and ending depth of the sample.  This information is also 

written on the open pit sample bags.  In open pit drill holes previous to 2013, areas where 

mineralization is not expected, i.e., the beginning of longer drill holes, a 20 ft sample interval 

may be used by sampling a chip, approximately one inch, per one foot section.  These 20 ft 

intervals may be further subdivided into the standard five foot sample interval if warranted by 

assay results from the 20 ft chip samples.   

 

Open pit core and RC samples are sent to an outside laboratory, ALS Chemex, for gold, preg 

rob, and multi-element analysis.  Pulps are returned to Goldstrike laboratory analysis for 

arsenic and LECO values (S2, C, CO3, TCM). Open pit Cubex ore control samples are 

delivered to the Goldstrike laboratory by Goldstrike personnel for assaying.  Samples are 

logged into the laboratory data system, either by scanning the barcode on the sample bag, or 

manually, when the barcode is damaged or too dirty to scan.  The assay suite consists of Au 

fire assay and LECO. Cubex grade control holes are assayed at the Goldstrike laboratory for 

Au only by fire assay. 

 

Underground exploration drilling core and RC samples are sent to an outside laboratory, ALS 

Chemex, for gold analysis with pulps returned to Goldstrike laboratory analysis for arsenic 

and LECO values (S2, C, CO3, TCM).  Capital, expense, and near mine exploration 

underground Core and RC samples are sent directly to Goldstrike laboratory analysis for 

gold, arsenic, and LECO values (S2, C, CO3, TCM). 

 

The samples are then delivered by Goldstrike personnel to the Goldstrike laboratory for 

assaying.  Historically, if Goldstrike's laboratory was not able to process the samples in a 

timely manner, they were sent to an outside commercial laboratory.   



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 11-2 

Core samples are taken at five foot intervals as a standard to indicate variability in grade 

over a minimum mining height and width (20 ft for surface mining and 15 ft for underground 

mining).  Studies have shown that smaller sampling lengths are not cost effective from a 

handling or processing perspective and core sampling to one foot intervals has shown little 

additional grade variability.   

 

The upper portions of RC drill holes may be sampled at lengths of ten feet where there is no 

potential for significant mineralization.  In mineralization, RC holes are sampled on five foot 

intervals similar to core holes.  RC samples are returned through the cyclone and automated 

splitter and are collected by the drillers and inserted into marked bags and tagged by a 

plastic label with a unique barcode that includes the hole number and the sample interval. 

 

GOLDSTRIKE MINE ON-SITE ASSAY LABORATORY 
Goldstrike's on-site assay laboratory receives mining samples from both the open pit and 

underground divisions.  Samples are delivered to the laboratory by Goldstrike personnel or 

drill contractors.  All samples remain in Goldstrike custody and control from the drill rig to the 

assay laboratory.  This is common practice for the mining industry.  The sample barcode 

labels are scanned into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) computer for 

record of delivery and time stamp by the person delivering samples.  If samples cannot be 

prepped at the mine site, they are sent to a certified commercial laboratory where they are 

prepped and assayed with the assays and samples being sent back to Goldstrike.  The 

Goldstrike laboratory is not certified. 

 

GOLDSTRIKE SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS 
Sample preparation at the assay laboratory consists of three automated preparation systems 

as well as a manual crusher and pulverizer method.  All samples must be dried prior to 

crushing.  Each is described in detail below.   

 
SYSTEM 1 AND SYSTEM 2 
Samples to be prepped on System 1 are scanned into the preparation equipment by barcode 

scanner to keep track and order of the samples being processed by the system.  Samples 

are then poured into a corresponding drying pan which is then sent into a drying oven.  

These ovens are set at 250°F and contain conveyors which move the drying pans through 

the system.  When samples are dried according to the protocol for the set of samples, the 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 11-3 

system discharges the drying pans from the oven.  The samples are moved along a 

conveyor to a scale to be weighed prior to crushing.  This weight is used to determine the 

speed and cuts of the splitter. 

 

Samples to be prepped on System 2 are pre-dried in ovens set at 250°F on drying racks.  

Samples are scanned into the preparation equipment by a barcode scanner to keep track of 

the sample order being processed by the system.  Sample is then transferred from bags into 

bins on the conveyor where it is weighed. This weight is used to determine the speed and 

cuts of the splitter. 

 

Samples to be prepped on System 2 are pre-dried in ovens set at 250°F on drying racks.  

Samples are scanned into the preparation equipment by a barcode scanner to keep track of 

the sample order being processed by the system.  Sample is then transferred from bags into 

bins on the conveyor where it is weighed. This weight is used to determine the speed and 

cuts of the splitter. 

 

Samples to be processed on System 1 and System 2 are crushed and pulverized as follows.  

The dry sample is first crushed to 65% passing ten mesh, then goes through a rotary splitter 

that takes a 1000 gram split based on the initial dry weight (with any sample under 1000 

grams all the sample is taken as the split); any reject is directed to the waste conveyor.  The 

crushed sample is then processed through a continuous ring mill (CRM) pulverizer down to 

100% passing 50 mesh.  The sample is fed into a second rotary splitter and a split of 

approximately 500 grams is fed to another continuous ring mill pulverizer.  The secondary 

CRM pulverizes the sample to 80% passing 200 mesh.  The pulverized sample is then sent 

to a vibrating platform with a scale where the sample is weighed and then fed into a rotary 

splitter for a final weight of 250 grams.  The pulverized sample is then deposited into a 

sample cup. 

 

The preparation systems send scanned sample information to LIMS, which then creates 

labels for each of the sample cups.  Samples are grouped into numbered projects in LIMS 

and analytical tests can then be assigned as needed.  Labeled sample cups are then 

blended by inversion in a sample blender for five minutes.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 11-4 

SYSTEM 3 
System 3 is used for larger sample sizes.  Sample bags received are loaded onto carts and 

are dried in ovens set to 250oF.  Dry samples are weighed before being fed to a primary 

crusher.  This weight and the desired sample size are used to determine the sample split 

after the secondary crusher.   

 

At the primary crusher, the sample is crushed to minus 3/8 inch before being taken by a 

conveyor belt to the secondary crusher where the sample is further crushed to 65% passing 

10 mesh.  The sample is then fed into a rotary splitter and the desired weight is split out to a 

CRM pulverizer.  Pulverized sample is now 80% passing 200 mesh and is dispensed into a 

labeled sample cup.  Sample cups are then blended by inversion in a sample blender for five 

minutes.  Samples are then manually logged into the LIMS to be placed under project 

numbers and have analytical tests added.    

 

BOYD CRUSHER / TM PULVERIZER 
Sample bags received are loaded onto carts and are dried in ovens set to 250oF.  The dried 

sample is run through a Boyd crusher which crushes to ¼ inch.  The sample is then split 

through a riffle splitter by hand to obtain a representative split of roughly 250 grams of 

crushed material.  This crushed material is then placed onto the TM pulverizer which 

pulverizes the material to 80% passing 200 mesh and then it dispenses it to a labeled 

sample cup.  Sample cups are then blended by inversion in a sample blender for five 

minutes.  Samples are then manually logged into the LIMS to be placed under project 

numbers and have analytical tests added. 

 

OPEN PIT SAMPLES 
Blasthole samples from the Betze-Post pit are received by the Goldstrike laboratory and are 

scanned in by Goldstrike open pit personnel as mentioned previously.  Samples are 

exclusively prepared and analyzed by the Goldstrike laboratory.  The blasthole samples 

received are prepared using System 1, System 2, or the Boyd/TM Pulverizer.  Once prepped, 

blasthole samples are analyzed for gold by a ½ assay ton fire assay analysis with an atomic 

absorption (AA) instrument finish.  If the sample gold grade is above open pit ore cut-off 

grade, the samples will be analyzed for CN leach, % preg rob, total carbon, total sulphur, 

sulphide sulphur, carbonate, and organic carbon for ore characterization purposes.  High 

grade samples will be completed by a ½ assay ton fire assay with a gravimetric finish.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 11-5 

Exploration drill samples are sent to outside laboratories for preparation and analysis.  

Samples from Cubex in-fill drilling may be sent to outside laboratories depending on the 

Goldstrike laboratory workload.  The open pit has predominantly used ALS Chemex Assay 

Laboratories for external assays.  Samples are typically prepared in the Elko, Nevada branch 

of ALS Chemex preparation lab and once prepared the pulp samples are shipped to its Reno 

laboratory for assay or occasionally to its Vancouver laboratory if the Reno facility is 

overloaded. 

 

At the ALS Chemex Elko preparation laboratory, the Goldstrike open pit drill samples are 

oven dried, crushed to 70% minus ten mesh, and riffle split with a 250 g subsample 

pulverized to greater than 85% minus 200 mesh.  Gold analysis by the ALS Chemex 

Vancouver or Reno branches is completed by a one assay ton fire assay with an AA 

instrument finish.  Samples that are greater than seven ppm gold are rerun by a one assay 

ton fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  ALS Chemex laboratories in Nevada are certified to 

standards within ISO 9001-2008.  The ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver is accredited in 

accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2005.  Internal quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 

batch duplicates showing wide variation are re-assayed using the metallic screen method to 

improve assay confidence for possible free gold intervals.     

 

UNDERGROUND SAMPLES 
Rush samples from the Goldstrike underground division are received by the Goldstrike 

laboratory and are scanned in by Goldstrike underground personnel as mentioned 

previously.  Samples are exclusively prepared and analyzed by the Goldstrike laboratory.  

The rush samples received in house are prepped by the Boyd/TM Pulverizer.  Once prepped, 

the rush samples are analyzed for gold by a ½ assay ton fire assay analysis with a 

gravimetric finish.     

 

Muck and stope test hole samples from the Goldstrike underground division are received by 

the Goldstrike laboratory and are scanned in by Goldstrike underground personnel as 

mentioned previously.  Samples are exclusively prepared and analyzed by the Goldstrike 

laboratory.  The muck samples received in house are prepped by System 3 and/or Boyd/TM 

Pulverizer.  Once prepped, muck samples are analyzed for gold by a ½ assay ton fire assay 

analysis with an atomic absorption instrument finish.  Samples with gold grade greater than 

0.438 oz/st will be completed by a ½ assay ton fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  As 

requested by Goldstrike personnel, underground muck samples can be equal weight

composited for further ore characterization analyses including total carbon, total sulphur, 

sulphide sulphur, carbonate carbon, organic carbon, and arsenic. 

        

Chip and core drill samples from the Goldstrike underground division (not including Far 

MineX drilling) are received by the Goldstrike laboratory with chain of custody from 

Goldstrike underground personnel when samples are to be analyzed in house.  Drill samples 

are sometimes sent to outside laboratories for preparation and analysis depending on the 

Goldstrike laboratory workload.  The core and chip samples received in house are prepped 

by System 1, System 2, System 3, or the Boyd/TM Pulverizer depending on sample type.  

Once prepared, chip and core drill samples are analyzed for gold by a ½ assay ton fire assay 

analysis with an atomic absorption instrument finish.  Samples with gold grade greater than 

0.438 oz/st will be completed by a ½ assay ton fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  Other 

analyses are sometimes requested by Goldstrike personnel including arsenic, total carbon, 

total sulfur, sulphide sulfur, carbonate carbon, and organic carbon.  These are on a case by 

case basis.  American Assay Laboratories in Sparks, NV (which is independent and 

accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2005) is typically used for the preparation of 

chip and core samples as needed.  American Assay Labs has also been used to complete 1 

assay ton fire assay for gold content.  Samples are then sent back to the Goldstrike 

laboratory for the required analyses or storage if requested. 

 

CORE AND SAMPLE STORAGE 
After it is logged and split for assay, drill core is either kept on site at the core shed or 

shipped to the core laydown yard.  Much of the underground drill core is not split for assay 

(the whole core sample is assayed).  Assay pulps are saved and stored inside the core 

handling facility.  Coarse rejects are stored at the core laydown facility. 

 

Historically, not all samples were stored on site.  Samples from mineralized intervals were 

selected for storage with the rest disposed at the mine waste dumps.  The storage selection 

basis was: 

i. Select all intervals that contain in excess of 0.020 oz/st Au. 
 

ii. Select at least four intervals above and below the above intervals as a buffer. 
 

iii. Select intervals that outline small gaps of four (more or less) unselected intervals 
between other intervals that are selected. 
 

iv. Select any other interval that may require further analyses.

Historically, sample rejects were only saved for mineralized intervals and 20 ft above and 

below the ore intervals.  Rejects are kept in sealed steel barrels that are stored at the core 

laydown yard.   

 
PULPS 
Exploration and Definition Drilling Pulps – Open Pit 
For at least the last six years, all pulps from exploration and definition drilling are stored on 

site. Historically, pulps from exploration and definition drilling were stored for six months.  

After this time, the pulps were discarded.  If additional analyses are required from holes 

drilled during that time, samples may be constructed from chip trays stored in numbered 

boxes.  Both electronic and hard copy manifests of chip tray contents are maintained.   

 

Underground Samples Pulps 
Pulps from channels, mucks, and rush samples were usually discarded once the results have 

been approved.  However, since 2016 exploration pulps have been kept.  Underground 

sample rejects are routinely discarded once results have been confirmed by the Geology 

Department.  

 

SAMPLE SECURITY 
All blasthole samples remain in Goldstrike custody and control generally from the drill rig to 

the mine assay laboratory.  Exploration drill core and RC chip samples sent to ALS Chemex 

laboratories for analysis are either picked up on site by ALS Chemex personnel or 

transported to the ALS Chemex facility by exploration personnel.  Security is not an issue 

since Goldstrike employees hand off the samples directly to ALS Chemex or the Goldstrike 

main assay laboratory and the chain of custody is complete. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the sampling, sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures used 

are reasonable and appropriate. 

 

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 

GOLDSTRIKE ASSAY LABORATORY QA/QC  
Gold analysis by fire assay includes a blank sample, two certified gold reference material 

samples, and a repeat assay of a sample for each set of 24 samples analyzed.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 11-8 

Contamination, accuracy, and precision are monitored daily using the internal QA/QC to 

ensure good sample results.  Sample sets that include certified reference material or blank 

results that are out of set specifications are not reported to clients and the entire set must be 

re-assayed. 

 

QA/QC reports are distributed daily and results are reviewed by the chemists and laboratory 

supervision.  A monthly QA/QC report is also distributed to laboratory supervision and 

personnel.  With close monitoring of QA/QC, issues or problems can be corrected quickly. 

 

The Goldstrike laboratory also participates in three separate round robin programs to ensure 

quality results are being produced.  Unknown samples from a third party are sent to the 

laboratory for analysis.  Reported results are statistically compared to other participants as a 

gauge of quality. 

 

GOLDSTRIKE EXPLORATION QA/QC 
Barrick exploration and site geologist are responsible for the QA/QC for all exploration drilling 

on site, surface and underground.  Goldstrike has checks in place to prevent non-compliance 

with sampling procedures that include daily observation of contractor RC sampling 

techniques by geologists and/or drill supervisors.  Immediate action is taken to correct any 

non-compliance with sampling procedures.  A visual estimate of any downhole contamination 

is recorded by geologists on the drill hole log and the contractor, driller, and crew responsible 

are notified and proper drilling and sampling procedures are reviewed.   

 

Sample weights are checked and may be used to plan new exploration and infill drilling 

because low RC sample weights are usually due to low recovery and may not yield a 

representative sample.   

 

Drill holes are designed and assigned drill hole name, planned collar coordinates, depth, and 

appropriate sample intervals.  The targeted mineralized interval is used to assign the QA/QC 

standards, blanks, and duplicates for each drill hole.  A list is prepared and barcoded sample 

tags are printed.  Sample bags are prepared by a geotechnician and checked for accuracy.  

The bags are then given to the drillers.  Duplicate sample intervals are marked by red 

flagging to warn the driller's helper of an upcoming duplicate.  Blank control samples are 

included in the sample sequence and reference standard samples are marked and prepared 

after completion of the drilling and prior to submittal to the laboratory.  Samples are collected

in bins and transported to the laboratory either by mine or laboratory vehicle accompanied by 

completed submittal forms for each drill hole.  One blank, one standard, and one duplicate 

are randomly inserted in the assaying stream for every 30 samples submitted.  

 

QA/QC data are tracked as returned from the laboratory and assays validated before 

finalizing them in the database.  

  

The Goldstrike underground division has checks in place to prevent non-compliance with 

sampling procedures that include training and checking of proper sampling procedures for 

contractor RC drilling, core sampling by Goldstrike geotechnicians and muck sampling by 

Goldstrike truck operators. Immediate action is taken to correct any non-compliance with 

sampling procedures.  A visual estimate of any downhole contamination is recorded by 

geologists on the drill hole log and the contractor, driller, and crew responsible are notified 

and proper drilling and sampling procedures are reviewed.  

 

One pulp blank, one pulp standard, one field duplicate and one pulp duplicate are inserted 

randomly into the assay stream.  The pulp blank and standard are entered in the sample 

sheet by the geologist.  The field duplicate for RC drilling is completed by the contract driller 

at the rig using a rifle splitter.  As the underground core drilling is whole core sampled, no 

field duplicates are taken.  The pulp duplicate is selected randomly by the assay laboratory.  

The results from 2015 and 2016 were reviewed at the EOY 2016, and were not tracked 

before entering into the database.  Results previous to 2015 were tracked upon return from 

the lab and were validated before finalizing them into the database.  

 

In RPA's opinion, the QA/QC practices are reasonable and appropriate.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
Prior to updating the open pit or underground resource model, a data export from acQuire is 

created from the Barrick exploration and underground drilling databases.  A Vulcan Isis 

database is created from the exported data and is checked for duplicate collars, missing 

data, bad depth data, overlapping intervals, and other anomalies that could indicate 

questionable data.  When errors are found by the Resource Geologist, the drill hole or 

interval is documented and the error is fixed or the hole removed from the estimation 

database.  Where possible, the error is also corrected in the acQuire database.  If problems 

are found with the database export, the modeling group works with the database manager to 

obtain a valid export.  Access to the Vulcan database used for resource and reserve 

estimation is restricted to the Goldstrike Resource Geologists to ensure that the data integrity 

is preserved. 

 

The open pit and underground resource drill hole databases are validated before they are 

used for model estimation.  The first step in validating a Vulcan database is running the 

database validation tool in Vulcan and/or JMP statistical software.  This tool checks for 

duplicate collar coordinates, checks for overlapping intervals, the validity of From/To fields, 

blank tables, and other possible errors.  The tool generates a report that is reviewed by the 

Resource Geologist, who makes and documents any changes.  

 

Statistics are also run on the gold and metallurgical data as a check on the validity of the 

data in the database.  A number of queries are run to check for unreasonable values.  

Negative values that represent detection limits (below lower detection limits or above 

maximum detection limit) are recorded. 

 

It is RPA's opinion, the Goldstrike open pit and underground drill hole databases are valid 

and acceptable for resource estimation.  The ultimate validation of the reliability of the 

exploration drill hole databases is provided by the reconciliation between the resource model 

and production.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
MINERAL PROCESSING 
There are two ore processing facilities at the Goldstrike Mine.  They are: 

1. An autoclave circuit consisting of: 

o Grinding circuits 
o Acid and alkaline pressure oxidation (POX) autoclave circuits, followed by 
o Total Carbonaceous Material (TCM) leaching process, incorporating a Resin 

in Leach (RIL) circuit, using calcium thiosulfate (CaTs) for gold dissolution 
instead of cyanide. 
 

2. A roaster circuit, consisting of: 
o Dry grinding circuits 
o Two-stage fluid bed roasting 
o Carbon in Leach (CIL) gold recovery 

 

Depending on various factors, including gold content, carbonate content, carbonaceous 

carbon reactivity, and sulphide sulphur content, ore is dispatched to various stockpiles 

located at either the autoclave or the roaster.  Planned distribution of ore from the stockpiles 

is an extensive exercise, which is carried out monthly by the strategic planning department to 

maintain optimal blends designed to maximize gold recovery.  All of the underground ore is 

processed in the roasters. 

 

METALLURGICAL TESTING  
Metallurgical testing has focused on development and support of the Thiosulphate Leach 

Conversion (TLC) process which utilizes the existing pressure oxidation circuits and added a 

RIL circuit.  The testing included bench-scale and pilot-scale testing to develop the process 

design criteria and to estimate the operating costs associated with the proprietary process.  

Implementation of the TLC process will extend the useful life of the pressure oxidation plant 

and may significantly increase the rate of gold production by bringing forward gold production 

in the mine plan by treating ores that were not previously amenable to pressure oxidation. 

The TCM leach process was successfully commissioned in 2014 with the first gold pour on 

November 28, 2014.

RECOVERY 
Barrick has developed recovery calculations based on evaluation of historical data.  They 

have changed over time as the ore and operations have changed.  The most recent recovery 

calculations for the alkaline and acid autoclaves are shown in Table 13-1 through Table 13-4 

and the recovery calculations for the roaster are shown in Table 13-5.

ALLOCATION AND RECONCILIATION 
Goldstrike undertakes comprehensive metallurgical accounting through month-end inventory 

measurements and calculations, and allocation procedures to reconcile differences between 

estimated head grade and actual head grades.  This process involves formulae for predicting 

gold recovery in both the autoclave and the roaster.  The data and procedures have been 

reviewed and appear to meet industry standards with no significant problems detected. 

 

Goldstrike reconciles the differences between the estimated and actual head grades and 

recoveries for Betze and underground ores based on the actual gold production.  The 

differences are allocated based on specified procedures and formulae. 

 

Separate metallurgical balances are maintained at Goldstrike for the roaster and the 

autoclaves.  The metallurgical balances are calculated on a monthly basis according to the 

equation: 
IN = OUT + Δ Inventory 

 

The monthly inventory is a key component of the metallurgical balance.  At each month end, 

measurements are made of the amount of material contained in the circuits and 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 13-4 

representative samples of the material are taken and assayed to estimate the amount of gold 

contained in each circuit. 

 

The tonnages fed to the plants are measured using flow meters and densitometers.  

Automatic samplers are used to collect samples of the feed and the tails for both the 

autoclave and the roaster.  Using this data, the "Ounce Calls" are estimated and reported on 

the Daily Safe Production Report (DSPR).  The tonnages are not adjusted.  The head grades 

are adjusted at the month end based on the actual gold production.  Tailings grades for 

individual components may be adjusted based on predicted or contracted recovery rates for 

toll material.  The actual production is reconciled with the Ounce Call for each plant based on 

the total actual gold production using the ratios determined from the Ounce Call. 

 
AUTOCLAVE ADJUSTMENTS 
The total tonnage to the autoclave is not adjusted; it is measured using a densitometer and a 

flow meter.  The ore sources are not campaigned; therefore, the tonnage of each is 

determined by preliminary values provided through best practice methods involving the 

following; scale weights and moisture determinations, stockpile survey, and skipped tons.  

The tons for each ore source are reconciled to the official total tons (which are essentially the 

same as the sum of the individual sources) by simple ratio. 

 

The head grade is adjusted based on the gold production numbers.  Adjustments are made 

to the head grades of each ore source by simple ration when comparing gold production 

numbers and estimated production. 

 

The final plant tail grade comes from the DSPR (daily safe production report) with no 

adjustments.  The estimated tail grade from all ore sources is determined using the gold 

recovery based on the autoclave recovery models. Estimated tail grades are corrected by 

applying a ratio to the actual DSPR tail grade. 

 
ROASTER ADJUSTMENTS 
The total tonnage to the roaster is not adjusted; it is measured using a densitometer and a 

flow meter.  The ore sources are not campaigned; therefore, the tonnage of each is 

determined by preliminary values provided through best practice methods involving the 

following; scale weights and moisture determinations, stockpile survey, and skipped tons.  

These preliminary tonnages are corrected to the official roaster tonnage by ratio, with the

exception of the underground since it is either weighed or surveyed.  Production is assigned 

based on the estimated production from each source (total tons and metal) and is prorated 

back to the source based on their contribution.  The adjustments made to head grade based 

on actual production are applied to all ore sources using simple ratios. 

 

The final roaster tail grade is taken from the DSPR with no adjustment.  The estimated tail 

grade from all ore sources is determined using the gold recovery based on the roaster 

recovery model. Estimated tail grades are corrected by applying a ratio to the actual DSPR 

tail grade. 

 

The recovery is adjusted using the adjusted head grade and the corrected tail grade using 

the following equation: 

 

Ounce Production = Tons x Adjusted Head Grade x Adjusted Recovery (%) 

 

The minor adjustments made to the plant head grades for 2015 and 2016 are summarized in 

Table 13-6.

Based on the evaluation of the head grade adjustments, RPA is of the opinion that the 

recovery calculations and the equations used to estimate gold recoveries are accurate. 

 

PRODUCTION STATISTICS 
Production statistics from the autoclave and roaster circuits from 2011 to 2016 are shown 

below in Table 13-7.  This includes all material (Goldstrike and toll ore, which in 2016 

includes feed from South Arturo) processed in both operating plants.

Total throughput has generally followed budget over the time period.  Throughput rate for the 

autoclave has been below budget for most of the period, while the roaster has generally 

been above budget over the same time period. 

 

Feed grade for the autoclave has fluctuated above and below budget, while the roaster feed 

grade has overall been above budget. 

 

Gold production from the autoclave was above budget until 2014. From 2014 until the end of 

2016 gold production has been below budget.  This is due to the conversion of the circuit to 

CaTs and resin.  The conversion is still being optimized.  Roaster gold production has 

generally exceeded budget over the time period.

date of December 31, 2016.  The open pit and underground resource estimates are based 

on depleting the 2016 mid-year block models, which were built using data available up to 

January 22, 2016 for underground and March 3, 2016 for open pit.  RPA examined the 

EOY2016 open pit and underground Mineral Resource estimates and is of the opinion that 

they meet or exceed industry standards and are acceptable to support reserve work. 

 

Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 9.07 million tons grading 0.160 oz/st Au 

and contain 1.46 million ounces of gold.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources total 1.26 

million tons grading 0.277 oz/st Au and contain 349,000 oz Au. 

 

In metric units, the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources total 8.23 million tonnes 

grading 5.50 g/t Au and contain 1.46 million oz Au.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources 

total 1.1 million tonnes grading 9.48 g/t Au and contain 349,000 oz Au. 

 

Open pit Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 5.76 million tons grading 0.078 

oz/st Au and contain 447,000 ounces of gold.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources total 

89,000 tons grading 0.056 oz/st Au and contain 5,000 oz Au.  The open pit Measured 

Resources include 0.52 million tons averaging 0.049 oz/st from the BMW and BMW2 

stockpiles. 

 

Underground Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 3.31 million tons grading 

0.304 oz/st Au and contain 1.01 million oz Au.  Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated to 

be 1.17 million tons grading 0.294 oz/st Au, containing 344,000 oz Au. 

 

Goldstrike has very experienced on-site staff that are dedicated to maintaining the Betze-

Post open pit resource block model and the Meikle and Rodeo underground block models.  

Different resource estimation procedures and block models are used to estimate the open pit 

and underground resources at the Goldstrike Mine.

OPEN PIT MINERAL RESOURCES 

SUMMARY 
Table 14-2 provides a detailed breakdown of the open pit Measured and Indicated Mineral 

Resources, which are exclusive of Mineral Reserves.  The resources situated between the 

reserve pit design and the resource shell are tabulated as "Within Resource Shell" and the 

incremental resources situated in the reserve pit design with block grades lying between the 

resource and reserve cut-off grades are tabulated as "Within Reserve Pit".  The low grade 

BMW and BMW2 stockpile material is also itemized separately.  The small open pit Inferred 

Mineral Resource totalling 89,000 tons, grading 0.056 oz/st Au, and containing 5,000 oz Au 

is not included in Table 14-2. 

 

The open pit block model was created by Goldstrike using Maptek Vulcan software version 

9.1 supplemented by in-house custom Barrick programs used for capping and other statistics 

derived from geostatistical software.  The model is an inverse distance squared (ID2) 

estimate that uses estimated gold grade indicators and composite weighting to constrain the 

gold grades within each grade zone.  Estimates were generated in 32 separate block model 

estimation domains, each of which is based on the geologic interpretation of the deposit as 

represented by three dimensional fault traces, lithologic units, and orientation of 

mineralization.  Nine of the estimation domains encompass the underground operating area. 

The resource in the underground domains is not reported as open pit resource, but exists to 

ensure a geologically reasonable estimate in areas influenced by underground data. 

 

Geologic interpretations were created from drill hole logging, blasthole grade contours, and 

high wall mapping information.  In the northwest portion of the pit, which is currently being 

mined, mineralization is more structurally controlled and features sharper gradations in gold 

grades than was encountered previously.

DOCUMENTATION 
The methodology used in creating the EOY2016 open pit resource model has been well 

documented by the Goldstrike open pit resource team.  They have created several 

documents that list model notes and step by step procedures. 

 

BLOCK MODEL PARAMETERS 
The Betze-Post open pit block model properties are shown below.  The origin is in mine grid 

coordinates (Table 14-3).  Blocks have a height of 20 ft, a width of 40 ft, and a length of 40 ft, 

appropriate for the smallest mining unit available with the equipment in the Goldstrike open 

pit.  The model is not rotated and it has 377 rows, 352 columns, and 150 benches.  The 

block model extends north-south for 15,080 ft, east-west for 14,080 ft, and vertically for 3,000 

ft.  The block model has 19,905,600 blocks. 

 

In addition to the gold grade block model, block models have been prepared and interpolated 

for rock units and for process route parameters:  sulphide content (S2), arsenic content 

(ARSEN), TCM, carbonate, pregnant solution robbing value (PRVAL), and bond work index 

(BWI).

MINERALIZATION DOMAINS 
Estimation model domains were created based on the geology, orientation of mineralization, 

structure, etc., in an effort to define areas of different orientation or other controls of 

mineralization for grade calculation.  Variograms were created for each estimation domain to 

determine search distances used in the search ellipses.  All composites within a domain solid 

are flagged with the domain value coded in the block model, as summarized in Table 14-4.

INDICATOR GRADE ZONES 
Blocks are selected for estimation in different grade categories using estimated indicator 

values at cut-off grades of 0.03 oz/st Au, 0.1 oz/st Au, and 0.3 oz/st Au.  For each of these 

cut-off grades, a variable is set in the composites that flags whether the gold assay is above 

(value equals 1) or below (value equals 0) the cut-off.  These composite variables are 

estimated into corresponding variables in the block model.  The resulting estimation is a 

probability that a block will be above the specific grade cut-off.  Three indicator variables in 

the block model are estimated with ID2 using search orientations derived from geology and

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 14-6 

variography.  Each block is estimated using a minimum of six composites and a maximum of 

14.  Search distances are larger than those used in the final gold estimation.  

 

Estimated indicator codes are flagged back to the composite file.  Rather than use coded 

grade shells, the estimated indicator probabilities are used to select blocks during gold 

estimation. Blocks are selected above a 0.4 probability for low- and mid-grade indicator 

values.  For high-grade estimation passes (>0.3 oz/st Au), blocks with >0.6 indicator values 

are selected in some domains in an effort to avoid an overestimate of high grade material.  

Indicator values are coded back to the composite file and used in composite weighting to 

influence the softness of the low-, mid-, and high-grade zone boundaries in the deposit.  

 

Weights in the composites are set according to indicator values flagged from the model.  The 

weights range from 0 (no influence) to 1 (full influence).  Weights for the low- and mid-grade 

models were set above a 0.4 indicator cut-off.  Weights for the high grade passes were set 

above 0.4 indicator value for the high-grade passes in most domains.  In nine domains, the 

influence of samples within the high-grade zone was restricted by setting weights in those 

composites based on a 0.6 indicator cut-off.  Weights were chosen in 2012 based on 

reconciliation with past production data.  Table 14-5 shows the composite weighting scheme 

used in the model.  Indicator values and estimation domain codes are used directly for gold 

interpolation, whereas rock type is used to estimate some metallurgical parameters.

Capping thresholds are determined from log-probability grade distributions in each domain.  

Outlier high-grade populations are identified from disruptions in the grade distribution.  The 

highest grade that is part of a smooth or continuous distribution is usually taken as the 

capping threshold.  The capping grade is applied to the assays in each domain and statistics 

are checked to ensure that the coefficient of variation (CV) and/or Grade-Thickness Lost (GT 

Lost%) for the capped assays are less than approximately 2 and 10%, respectively.  Table 

14-7 shows sample statistics.

The capping strategy used at Goldstrike effectively limits the influence of anomalous high 

grade assays and is in line with industry standards, in RPA's opinion. 

 

COMPOSITING 
The drill hole database was composited into 20 ft intervals downhole.  Capped Au assays 

were composited and used in grade estimation.  All compositing is performed using the run 

length method in Maptek Vulcan software.  Table 14-8 shows composite statistics.

DENSITY DATA 
The density values used by Goldstrike's open pit modelling team originated from historical 

tests conducted on core for several areas of the Betze-Post deposit.  These tests have 

indicated an average tonnage factor for non-Carlin Formation ore and waste of 

approximately 13.5 ft3/st.  For Carlin Formation waste, a tonnage factor of 16.0 ft3/st is used, 

and for waste dump material, a value of 18.2 ft3/st is used.   

 

Mine plans and reconciliation show that the current density model is reasonable.  Density 

samples have been collected and were recently compiled to identify areas and rock types 

that might need additional data sampling.  Additional sample density work is planned to 

determine whether an update to modelled density is warranted.  These new data will be 

integrated with the existing data to improve the density model.

VARIOGRAPHY 
Variography was used to determine search ranges in each domain for the Betze-Post Open 

Pit model.  The orientation of the search ellipse in each domain is based on the geometry of 

mineralization in that domain.  Search ranges are determined using correlograms generated 

using the 20 ft composites.  Figure 14-1 shows a correlogram for the Latite Domain.  The 

orientation and search ranges used in each domain are summarized in Table 14-9.

INTERPOLATION STRATEGY 
For the open pit resource estimation, the grade interpolation was carried out using ID2 

methodology, with a search ellipse consistent with the variography and geological controls on 

mineralization in each domain.  Table 14-9 lists key parameters used for grade interpolation.   

 

The estimation used seventeen passes in each domain.  The first pass comprises a box 

search of 40 ft by 40 ft by 20 ft, using only composites that are found within the block being 

evaluated. Next, three sets of four passes are run in the low-, mid-, and high-grade blocks as 

defined by the indicator cut-offs.  The first pass in these sets estimates blocks at 80% of the 

sill range, with a minimum of two and maximum of three samples.  The second pass in these 

sets selects samples at half the 80% sill range, using a minimum of one and maximum of 

three samples.  This pass is to fill blocks that did not meet the minimum of two samples and 

two holes needed in the first pass.  The third and fourth passes are similar to the first two, but 

estimate blocks at 90% the sill range and half that distance, respectively.  A set of four 

passes is also run in each domain for blocks outside the 0.4 low grade indicator cutoff.  The 

passes are used in resource classification, as discussed in the next section.

OPEN PIT RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Mineral Resource classification is based on a combination of economic criteria and the pass 

in which each block was estimated.  Criteria for Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 

classification are summarized in Table 14-10.  The Measured Mineral Resource is defined as 

any block which has one or more composite samples inside it (and therefore received an 

estimate in Pass 1).  Indicated Mineral Resource is determined from variogram ranges at 

80% of the sill (passes 2 and 3 in each indicator grade zone).  Estimation criteria for Inferred 

Mineral Resource is defined by those blocks within 90% of the sill (passes 4 and 5).

The approach to estimation and resource classification used in the Goldstrike open pit model 

is appropriate and to industry standards, in RPA's opinion. 

 

OPEN PIT MODEL VALIDATION 
The Goldstrike open pit model was verified using the following methods: 

• Comparisons of assay, composite, and block model statistics 

• Visual comparisons between block and composite grades on plans and sections 

• Visual inspections to confirm all block coding completed properly at each estimation 
step 

• Comparison of estimated and nearest neighbour models in Vulcan and in-house 
software  

• Comparison with previous model 

• Comparison with production 

 

For 2016, the open pit resource model overstated the tons by 9%, understated the gold 

grade by 21%, and understated the gold ounces by 10% compared to the actual open pit 

production.  A narrow, high grade structure on the west side of the phase was not well 

defined with drill spacing.  From 2011-2015, the block model underpredicted ounces an 

average of 9%, grade by 11%, overstating tons by an average of 2%.  Overall, RPA views 

these reconciliation results as acceptable and concurs with Goldstrike's plans to investigate 

changes that will reduce the grade variance in the future. 

 

Model estimation is performed in Vulcan, while planning uses Deswick for pit design and 

sequencing.  Checks are performed in Vulcan and Deswick to ensure that the block model 

transfers correctly between the two programs.  This includes spot checks of various blocks 

with low, medium, and high estimated gold grades.  Reports are also run and compared by 

rock type and routing classification in both programs.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 14-15 

OPEN PIT RESOURCE REPORTING 
Most of the reported resources are situated between the reserve pit design and the resource 

shell.  The resource shell was optimized at a $1,500/oz gold price.  Incremental resources 

that are situated in the reserve pit design with block grades lying between the resource and 

reserve cut-off grades are also included.  Some stockpiles with grades above the resource 

cut-off grades but below the reserve cut-off grades are included in the resource estimate.   

 

Open pit Mineral Resources are based on cut-off grades of 0.030 oz/st Au for roaster feed, 

0.050 oz/st Au for acid autoclave feed, and 0.055 oz/st Au for alkaline autoclave feed.  

 

It is RPA's opinion that the procedures used to report the open pit resources at the Goldstrike 

Mine are reasonable and conform to industry best practice.  

 

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
On-going reconciliation of the model and production show that the approach and procedures 

used to create the Goldstrike open pit resource model are adequate for planning purposes 

and are in line with industry standards.  The models are created and documented by an on-

site Qualified Person and follow standard industry practice.  The model procedure is well 

documented through the master spreadsheet which includes records of visual and statistical 

checks.  Where possible, the model process is automated using scripts, providing another 

record of how the model was created. 

 

Recommendations for future models include: 

• Review/update the composite weighting scheme with more recent reconciliation data. 

• Include the underground and blasthole data in future variography studies. 

• Investigate using the blasthole, drill hole, and mapping data to manually build high 
grade wireframes for structurally controlled mineralization.      

 

In RPA's opinion, the EOY2016 open pit resource estimation procedures at the Goldstrike 

Mine are reasonable and acceptable.

UNDERGROUND 

SUMMARY 
Table 14-11 provides a detailed breakdown of the underground Measured and Indicated 

Mineral Resources, which are exclusive of Mineral Reserves.  The Measured and Indicated 

Mineral Resources could not be converted to Mineral Reserves due to operational 

constraints and Inferred Mineral Resources have an insufficient level of confidence for 

conversion to reserves.  The underground Inferred Mineral Resources are summarized in 

Table 14-12.  

 

Underground Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources in 11 zones total 3.31 million tons 

grading 0.304 oz/st Au and contain 1.01 million oz Au.  Inferred Mineral Resources are 

estimated to be 1.17 million tons grading 0.294 oz/st Au, containing 344,000 oz Au. 

 

The underground Mineral Resource was estimated by the Goldstrike underground division 

using block models constrained by three-dimensional models of the mineralized bodies and 

domains.  The gold grades are interpolated into the blocks using inverse distance to the fifth 

power (ID5) weighting.  The models are constructed using Maptek Vulcan 3D software 

version 9.1 supplemented by in-house custom Barrick programs used for capping and other 

statistics derived from geostatistical software. 

 

RPA examined the EOY2016 underground Mineral Resources and found them to meet or 

exceed industry standards.  In RPA's opinion, the underground EOY2016 Mineral Resource 

estimates were completed to a high standard of quality by very experienced on-site 

Goldstrike personnel using reasonable and appropriate procedures and input parameters.

DOCUMENTATION 
The methodology used in creating the EOY2016 underground resource model has been well 

documented by the Goldstrike underground resource team.  They have created several 

documents that list model notes and step by step procedures. 

 

BLOCK MODELS 
There are two block models, Meikle and Rodeo, that contain the Mineral Resource 

underground at the Goldstrike Mine.  These block models encompass 11 individual 

mineralized zones.  All block models comprise parent blocks measuring 50 ft by 50 ft by 50 

ft, with sub-blocks measuring 10 ft by 10 ft by 10 ft, and down to 5 ft by 5 ft by 5 ft.  The 

parent (50 ft) blocks are used to assign a 0.001 oz/st Au grade to the unmineralized and 

unestimated material, while the smaller blocks are used in the mineralized zones.  Origins 

and extents vary according to the zone being modelled.  Models are rotated to reflect the

overall geologic trend of the mineralized zones.  Model construction parameters for Meikle 

and Rodeo models are shown in Table 14-13. 

 

The principal economic component estimated into the blocks is gold.  In addition, estimates 

of accessory components were made, which includes sulphur, carbonate, arsenic, and TCM.  

Royalty information is also coded into the model to allow appropriate factors to be calculated 

for royalty payments.

MINERALIZED DOMAIN MODELS 
The mineralized domain models are constructed from the drilling and muck sample data, at 

0.05 oz/st Au and 0.10 oz/st Au cut off grades.  The general approach is to build a 

"mineralized" zone at the lower cut-off grade, which encompasses higher grade zones built at 

the higher cut-off grade.  This allows for reasonable estimates of the dilution grade 

surrounding the higher grade zones.  Figure 14-2 provides a 3D view of the main 

underground domain models by mineralized zones.

Mineralized domains are generated based on grade, informed by geological features such as 

faults and lithological boundaries.  The interpretations are drawn as polylines on cross 

section, using a minimum horizontal mining width constraint of ten feet.  Section spacing is a 

division of 20 ft, with a maximum spacing of 40 ft for highly mineralized lenses and 60 ft for 

mineralized lenses.  The average spacing of sections is 20 ft, but can be as little as five ft or 

less in areas where complex grade boundaries exist.  The polylines are linked together to 

create the solid models.   

 

When completed, the domain models are reviewed, updated, and validated by the geology 

staff.  They are validated and checked again by a resource geologist prior to inclusion in the 

Mineral Resource block model.  The domains are used for estimation of domain volumes and 

tonnages for validation against previous models.  The domains are then used to assign 

domain codes to both the block model and the samples.  This controls compositing and also 

provides the ability to control samples used for estimation of a particular domain.   

 

DENSITY 
Bulk density was based on over 900 determinations carried out over a span of several years.  

The determinations were made by submerging rock specimens in either water or mercury to 

determine the volume, then estimating the bulk density by dividing the weight of the sample 

by its volume.  The measurements have been conducted on most of the mineralized zones 

on the property and tonnage factors are applied by zone in the block model.  Tonnage 

factors and bulk densities of the various zones are provided in Table 14-14. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the tonnage factors appear to be reasonable.  Mine plans and 

reconciliation data show that the current density model is adequate.  RPA concurs with 

Goldstrike's plans to collect more bulk density data for some zones, especially Banshee.

GRADE CAPPING 
A combination of high yield restrictions for low-grade mineralized zones and grade capping 

applied to all mineralized zones is used to reduce the influence of high grade assays.  The 

capping method employs in-house Barrick software and is applied to raw assay data prior to 

compositing.  Capping thresholds are determined from log-probability grade distributions in 

each domain.  Outlier high-grade populations are identified from disruption in grade

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 14-23 

distribution.  The highest grade that is part of a smooth or continuous distribution is usually 

taken as the capping threshold.  The capping grade is applied to the assays in each domain 

and statistics are examined to ensure the coefficient of variation (CV) and/or Grade-

Thickness Lost (GT lost %) for the capped assays are less than approximately 2 and 10%, 

respectively.  Capping and high yield restrictions are provided in Table 14-15.

The capping strategy used at the Goldstrike Mine effectively limits the influence of 

anomalous high grade assays and is in line with industry standards, in RPA's opinion.   

 

COMPOSITES   
Drill results from diamond drill holes and RC drill holes are used for block model estimation. 

The drill samples were composited to 10 ft lengths, with the mineralized domains controlling 

the process prior to geostatistical analysis and grade interpolation.  Compositing is 

configured to start and stop at the boundary of domain models.  Remnant composites, of less

than the requisite ten foot length, located at the boundaries of these zones are retained in the 

database.  Length weighting is applied in the interpolation to account for shorter intervals.   

 

Composites are checked visually to confirm that they were properly generated.  Statistics are 

also generated and compared with capped assays of the previous year's composites.  

Composite statistics are provided in Table 14-17. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the compositing methodology is reasonable and to industry standards.

VARIOGRAPHY 
Geostatistical analyses were conducted on the composite data to confirm or refine the 

search parameters for each domain.  The analyses were carried out using Vulcan and other 

software.  Directional correlograms were generated for each of the domains, and the search 

orientations and ranges derived from covariance models derived from these correlograms.  

The covariance models were also used for classification of the Mineral Resources. 

 

RPA has previously checked the variography for selected individual domains (Main Zone 

Breccia, Griffin Bazza Sands, Rodeo West Dipping, North Post Lower East Dip, and 

Banshee East) at the Goldstrike Mine.  Variogram studies obtained ranges of 35 ft to 160 ft, 

depending on the domain.  RPA obtained similar results with the check variograms.  An 

example of a correlogram is shown in Figure 14-3 for Rodeo East Dipping – Zappa Domain.

INTERPOLATION STRATEGY 
Grades were estimated into the blocks using inverse distance to the fifth power (ID5) 

methodology, with a search ellipse consistent with the correlogram and geological controls 

on mineralization in each domain.  The estimation used six passes in each domain (Tables 

14-18, 14-19, and 14-20).

The first pass comprised a box search of five foot by five foot by five foot, which reflected a 

block model cell which uses all composites data that were found within the block being 

evaluated.  The second pass estimated blocks at 85% of the sill range, with a minimum of 

two, a maximum of four samples and a maximum of one sample per drill hole.  The third 

pass selected samples at half the 85% sill range and the minimum number of samples was 

reduced to one.  This pass was run to fill blocks that did not meet the minimum two samples 

needed in the second pass and is referred to as a "donut" pass.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 14-33 

The fourth and fifth passes were similar to the third and fourth, but 95% of the sill range was 

used for the fourth pass and half the 95% range was used for the fifth pass.  The sixth pass 

used search distances equal to the full range of the correlograms, a minimum of one, 

maximum of four samples and one sample per drill hole.  The model cells estimated with the 

sixth pass were between 95 and 100% of the sill range and are therefore unclassified.  The 

0.100 oz/st and 0.050 oz/st domains represented hard boundaries, across which composites 

were restricted for both correlogram modelling and composite selection during estimation.  

The blocks in the mineralized domains were used to calculate external dilution.   

 

Wireframe solids of the mined-out areas and sterilized pillars are used to determine the 

proportion remaining of each block.  Blocks with more than 50% of their volumes sterilized 

and less than 50% mined out were tagged as completely mined.  Portions of blocks mined 

were not allowed to contribute any material to the mineral resource.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the grade interpolation strategy is reasonable and conforms to industry 

standards.  The combination of the ID5 weighting and the four-composite maximum per block 

is designed to reduce smoothing and generate more accurate local grade estimates.  This 

estimation approach has evolved with the benefit of production data over the years.  

 

UNDERGROUND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Resource classification was based on a combination of the estimation passes in which each 

block model cell received an estimate, distance to nearest mining area, number of drill holes 

used in estimation, and the elevation of the estimation domain.  These were used to 

establish a level of confidence for resource classification. Criteria for Measured, Indicated, 

and Inferred classification are summarized in Table 14-21.

For block model cells inside a high grade domain, Measured Resource was defined as any 

model cell estimated within the first pass (Pass 1) or the model cell distance to a mining area 

was less than or equal to 20 ft at South Meikle and less than or equal to 35 ft for the other 

domains and have at least two samples used in the gold grade estimation.   

 

Indicated Resource was determined from correlogram ranges at 85% of the sill, estimated 

with Pass 2 or Pass 3.   

 

Criteria for Inferred Resource was determined from correlogram ranges at 95% of the sill, 

estimated with Pass 4 or Pass 5. 

 

For block model cells inside a low grade domain, Indicated Resource was determined by all 

block model cells estimated with Pass 1, Pass 2, or Pass 3.  Inferred Resource was 

determined by all block model cells estimated with Pass 4 or Pass 5. 

 

All block model cells estimated with Pass 1 through to Pass 5 below the 3,000 (bottom of 

model) elevation were set to Inferred Resource.  Block model cells that were previously 

mined were removed from resource using wireframe models created around already mined 

areas.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the classification procedures are reasonable and appropriate.  RPA notes 

that the classification process results in a small number of Inferred blocks that are scattered 

within Indicated areas that could be included as Indicated in the future.

UNDERGROUND MODEL VALIDATION 
The EOY2016 block models were validated by Goldstrike using the following methods: 

• Comparisons of assay, composite, and block model statistics 

• Visual comparisons between block and composite grades on plans and sections 

• Visual inspections to confirm all block coding completed properly at each estimation 
step 

• Comparison of estimated and nearest neighbor models in Vulcan and in-house 
software  

• Comparison with previous model 

• Comparison with production 

 

For 2016, the underground resource model understated the tons by 7%, understated the gold 

grade by 9%, and understated the gold ounces by 17% compared to the actual underground 

production.  Overall, RPA views these reconciliation results as acceptable and concurs with 

Goldstrike's plans to investigate changes that will reduce the contained gold variance in the 

future. 

 

UNDERGROUND RESOURCE REPORTING 
Longhole and drift-and-fill designs are completed by ore zone, utilizing the 0.100 oz/st Au 

and 0.050 oz/st Au mineralized boundaries.  Access and capital development may be laid out 

within the 0.050 oz/st Au boundary or within waste.  Resources are only reported from 

designs created by engineering using appropriate cut-off grades that were based on 

economics at a gold price of $1,200 per ounce.  Material in designs that are not in reserves, 

however, above a drift and fill cut-off grade (based on $1,500 per ounce gold price) for 

stoping or an incremental development cut-off grade for development designs (0.10 oz/st Au) 

are considered as resources.  Designs for accessing mining areas that are above the 0.10 

oz/st Au cut-off grade may be included in the resources, if they must be mined to provide 

access to other reserve areas.   

 

It is RPA's opinion that the procedures used to report the open pit resources at the Goldstrike 

Mine are reasonable and conform to industry best practice.

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
On-going reconciliation of the model and production show that the approach and procedures 

used to create the Goldstrike open pit resource model are adequate for planning purposes 

and are in line with industry standards.  The underground resource model was created and 

documented by an on-site Qualified Person and followed standard industry practice.  The 

model procedure is well documented through the master spreadsheet which includes records 

of visual and statistical checks.  Where possible, the model process is automated using 

scripts, providing another record of how the model was created. 

 

Recommendations for future models include: 

• Investigate procedural changes that will improve the production reconciliation results. 

• Use a resource classification clean-up script or classification wireframes to upgrade a 
small amount of Inferred blocks that are scattered within the Indicated areas. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the EOY2016 underground resource estimation procedures at Goldstrike 

are very good and are completed by highly experienced on-site geological personnel.  The 

EOY2016 resource estimate is reasonable and acceptable, from RPA's view.

OPEN PIT 

MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
The resource estimates discussed in Section 14 were prepared using standard industry 

methods and appear to provide an acceptable representation of the deposits.  RPA reviewed 

the reported resources, production schedules, and cash flow analysis to determine if the 

resources meet the CIM definitions.  Based on this review, it is RPA's assessment that the 

Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource within the final pit design at the Goldstrike Mine 

can be classified as Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves.   

 

The EOY2016 Mineral Reserves for the open pit are summarized in Table 15-2.  The 

Qualified Person for the open pit Mineral Reserve estimate is Stuart E. Collins, P.E.

2020, and US$1,200/oz beginning in 2021. 
4. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 

 

CUT-OFF GRADE DISCUSSION 
The cut-off grade formula used by Goldstrike for the reserve reporting is as follows. 

 
Cut-off Grade (oz/st) = [(Process Cost per Ore Ton) + (Tailings Sustainability Cost per Ore Ton) +  

(General and Administration Cost per Ore Ton)] / [((Gold Price per Ounce) – 
(Refining Cost per Ounce)) x (1 – Royalty %) x (Gold Recovery %)] 

 

Individual cut-off grades are calculated for the roaster, TCM acid, and TCM alkaline 

processes.  Table 15-3 is a summary of the internal cut-off grades calculated for the three 

process methods used at the Goldstrike operation.

For portions of the pit to be mined after 2020, these cut-off grades were re-evaluated using a 

gold price of $1,200/oz. 

 

The block size in the Open Pit Block Model was selected to match the SMU for the open pit.  

The reconciliation between the Open Pit mined tons and the model has been within the 

acceptable range. 

 

Dilution and recovery are reflected in block estimate and are not applied elsewhere. 

 

MINERAL RESERVE VS. MINE VS. PROCESS RECONCILIATION 
Reconciliation of the Mineral Resource model to mill head grades was impractical due to the 

high percentage of ore directed to stockpiles.  However, the reconciliation of tons and grade 

produced according to the grade control system compared very well with that predicted by 

the mid-year 2016 Mineral Reserve estimate. 

 

STOCKPILES 

STOCKPILES AND ORE CONTROL 
Goldstrike maintains a complex system of ore and low grade stockpiles, which have been 

accumulating since the late 1980s.  There are primarily three major stockpile categories that 

are listed below: 



www.rpacan.com

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 15-4 

• Autoclave 

• Roaster 

• Distal 

 

The Proven Reserves located in 34 different stockpiles are estimated to be 58.17 million tons 

grading 0.081 oz/st Au, containing 4.70 million ounces of gold, as of December 31, 2016.  

RPA agrees with the ore control rationale for creating the stockpiles, and the accounting 

methods used to track the stockpile quantities and grades.

RECONCILIATION 
The Goldstrike Mine has a system in place for tracking and reconciling stockpile inventories.  

Reconciliation is completed at the end of each month and is shown for December 31, 2016 in 

Table 15-5.  At the end of December 2016, it was estimated that the stockpiles contained 7.7 

million tons of autoclave ore at an average grade of 0.088 oz/st Au and 50.5 million tons of 

roaster ore at an average grade of 0.080 oz/st Au.  Nearly 4.0 million ounces of gold are held 

in inventory in the stockpiles.  It should be noted that operational decisions can be made 

regarding the type of processing method and timing of the stockpile processing.  For 

example, it may be economically advantageous to process some of the roaster stockpile ore 

with the CaTs process, even if it means that recoveries are lower and costs higher – earlier 

realization of the revenue may offset those downsides, and improve utilization of both plants 

to full capacity. 

 

Also at month end, the process division completes an allocation procedure, as explained in 

Section 17.  Adjustments are made to the tonnage of ore from the open pit mine, the ounces 

produced, the head grades, tail grades, and recovery based on the ounces of gold that are 

sold and the amount of material processed in the plants. 

 

Two separate stockpile reports are maintained, one for the roaster and the other for the 

autoclaves.  The amount of material processed from each stockpile is tracked throughout the 

month.  At the end of the month, the tonnage of material processed from each stockpile is 

adjusted to reflect the total tons processed through the roaster and/or autoclave.  In a similar 

fashion, the contained ounces are adjusted based on the production from each plant. 

 

RPA has attempted to reconcile the amount of material contained in the stockpile by 

comparing the amount of material processed in the processing facilities with the Estimated 

Material Processed based on the change in inventory in the stockpiles and the amount of ore 

mined.  That is: 

 
Estimated Mined Material = Estimated Material Processed + Change in (Δ) Stockpile Inventory 

 

The Estimated Mined Material is based on the Reported Polygon Tons and Ounces mined 

for the Betze-Post open pit.  The change in the stockpile inventory is the difference between 

the Beginning Inventory and the Adjusted Ending Inventory.  Using this methodology, the 

Estimated Material Processed is compared to the Actual Material Processed, which is 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 15-7 

reported by the process division each month using the allocation procedure.  Table 15-5

Sonic drilling of specific stockpiles by Goldstrike shows a good correlation between the 

estimated grade from the Sonic drilling and the original ore control grade. 

 

In addition to gold grade, the stockpile reports track the sulphide sulphur, carbonate, and 

total carbonaceous material.  These components are important to the efficient operation of 

the processing plants.  

 

Since much of the material stored in the stockpiles has been there over an extended period, 

and it is known that the sulphide material oxidizes over time changing sulphide to sulphate, it 

is anticipated that the sulphide sulphur concentration, and therefore, the fuel value will be 

lower than it was when the material was placed in the stockpile. 

 

It is recommended that Goldstrike continue the sampling and assaying program to determine 

the current grades of the stockpiles, particularly for those to be processed soon.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Reserves. 
2. Mineral Reserves are estimated at a cut-off grade of 0.166 oz/st to 0.261 oz/st Au. 
3. Mineral Reserves are estimated using an average long-term gold price of US$1,000 per ounce and 

US$1,200 per ounce. 
4. Minimum mining width varies 
5. Bulk density varies by ore type. 
6. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 
7. North Post JV (Barrick 70% and Newmont 30%) reported at 70%. 

 

RPA examined the EOY2016 underground Mineral Reserves in detail and found them to 

meet or exceed industry standards.  The EOY2016 Mineral Reserves are based on the 

MY2016 block models, adjusted for areas mined in 2016. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the underground EOY2016 Mineral Reserve estimates are competently 

completed to industry standards using reasonable and appropriate parameters and conform 

to CIM definitions.   

 

The Mineral Reserves are generated based upon the mine designs applied to the Mineral 

Resources.  The design methodology uses both the cut-off grade estimation and economic 

assessment to design and validate the mineable reserves.  The following steps outline the 

general procedures used in the underground mine design:

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 15-9 

• Query the geological block model against the cut-off grade estimated above to 
determine mineable volumes.  
 

• Digitize mining shapes for material that falls within the cut-off grade ore volume.  
 

• Assign mining method based on the geometry, mining access, and geotechnical 
considerations.  
 

• Design stope access and identify development requirement in ore and waste.  
 

• Create 3D wireframe solids for each digitized shape.  
 

• Evaluate wireframes against the geological block model (estimate the tons, grade, 
and ounces of each stope).  
 

• Assess economics of mining individual stopes, incorporating access development, 
backfill, and rehabilitation requirements.  
 

• Assess overall economics of mining areas or zones, incorporating all development 
(direct and allocated), backfill, and rehabilitation requirements. Stopes deemed 
uneconomic at this stage may be re-designed and re-evaluated.  
 

• Summarize economic and uneconomic stopes and remove the uneconomic stopes 
from the short-range and/or LOM plan.  
 

• Final geological assessment (visual inspection) and assigning of a confidence rating 
of all designed stopes prior to inclusion into the reserve and mine plan.  

 

The economic assessments described above are separated into a short-range and long-

range model.  The short range model is used to assess the economic value of individual 

stopes by including the direct access development, backfill, and rehabilitation costs required 

to mine that stope.  The short range model directly affects whether a given stope will be 

included in the short range mine plan.  The long-range model is used to assess the economic 

value of a mining zone by allocating development costs and rehabilitation costs on a per ton 

weight basis.  The long-range model assesses the overall design of a mining zone and its 

associated development for the reserve and LOM plan.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the last step (confidence rating) goes beyond standard industry practice, 

and has a conservative effect on the Mineral Reserve estimate due to removing stopes that 

are not ready for mining in the short term.  The confidence rating step may be a necessary 

and useful measure to identify work required prior to mining, however, it may downgrade 

some stopes that will be mined within the year.  This effect can be seen in the reconciliation 

results, below.

DOCUMENTATION 
The Mineral Reserves are estimated using Vulcan software, a Deswik scheduler, and 

economic models for intermediate calculations in the mineral reserve estimation process and 

in the preparation of the LOM plan.  Goldstrike staff compile a cut-off grade (COG) memo 

outlining the assumptions and details of the COG estimates and an internal technical report 

after the end of the year. 

 

UNDERGROUND CUT-OFF GRADE 
The development of the COG for the underground operations is laid out in a comprehensive 

document on reserve cut-off grade calculation.  The COG parameters are as follows: 

• COGs are based on US$1,000 per ounce gold price.  A second pass set of COGs 
using the long-term price of US$1,200 per ounce is used for areas to be mined later 
than 2021. 
 

• Mine production plan and costing structure are based on the latest LOM plan. 
 

• No planned capital costs or sunk capital costs are included in the COG determination.   
 

• Unit costs used in the COG determination are the weighted average unit costs of the 
2016 LOM. 
 

• Process recoveries are from roaster recovery curves. 
 

• COG is estimated for each underground mining method (longhole stoping and drift 
and fill) and by specific mining areas (Meikle and Rodeo). 
 

• Each ore ton included in the LOM plan incurs additional costs for processing, G&A, 
NSR, refining, and a silver credit, which total $54.77 per ton. 

 

The breakeven and incremental cut-off grades estimated for the underground operation in 

mid-year 2016 are summarized in Table 15-7.

DILUTION AND EXTRACTION 
Stopes are subject to dilution and extraction estimates which are based upon the operating 

experience at the mine.  Dilution estimates are maintained for each of the mining zones and 

for the different types of mining that may be undertaken.  Dilution grades are also estimated 

for each area as shown in Table 15-8 (not all areas have been included in the table).

RECONCILIATION 
The underground technical services group has developed a system for the reconciliation of 

the production to the Mineral Reserve designs.  The evaluation also includes a stope 

performance index and stope powder factors.  The evaluation uses the mine production data, 

the Mineral Reserve estimates, the grade control model, and the cavity monitoring system 

(CMS) surveys of the stope voids. 

 

The reconciliation data for the underground mine is shown in Table 15-10 for the period 

January 2015 to December 2016.

The data illustrates a change in methodology between 2015 and 2016.  The 2015 

reconciliation figures are relative to the Mineral Reserve, including the confidence rating and 

a spatial variance component.  Many mined stopes that were defined with drilling during the 

year were rated as non-reserves, and show up in the DOM figures.  In 2016, the Mineral 

Reserve figures are evaluated without reference to the confidence rating or the spatial 

component, and show a much better match with DOM.  Mining still include stopes that were 

defined just before mining.  Drilling immediately before mining allows mining in non-

estimated areas.  Some of this is due to lack of drilling platform, or the following of 

mineralization during mining.

The 2016 reconciliation shows results within the standard target range of +/-10% for 

estimates of tonnage and grade.  The combined positive effect on ounces suggests that the 

estimate is slightly conservative (even after accounting for the confidence rating).   

 

In addition to the reconciliation information, a stope record is maintained which compares the 

blast design, the final reported production, and the CMS model.  Stope statistics and "stope 

performance" are also compiled.  The October 2016 comparison of blast designs and CMS 

models is shown in Table 15-12. 

 

The "stope performance" is calculated as 100% minus percent dilution minus percent ore 

overbreak minus percent ore underbreak.  In Table 15-13, the stope performance is the 

comparison of the stope performance to the budget stope performance for a given stope.

RPA considers the efforts put into the record keeping and reconciliation to be of good quality 

and in accordance with good industry practice.  RPA recommends that the reconciliation 

results and the stope performance analysis be used to evaluate stope designs to determine 

where improvements in mine planning would be most advantageous.

16 MINING METHODS 
The Goldstrike Mine consists of operating open pit and underground mines.  Both methods 

are described below. 

 

OPEN PIT 
The Betze-Post open pit is a truck and shovel operation.  The open pit has three remaining 

phases (3rd NW, 4th NW, and West Barrel).  The ultimate pit will measure approximately two 

miles east to west, 1.5 miles north to south, and have an average depth of approximately 

1,300 ft.    

 

The Bazza Waste Dump is located to the southwest of the open pit.  The Life of Mine (LOM) 

plan includes the Clydesdale Dump to the west, and backfilling of the southwest and 

southeast portions of the open pit.  Internal to the pit is the Betze Portal, which connects to 

the Rodeo underground mine; the North Post Portal, which connects to North Post and 

Rodeo underground; and the Betze Portal 2 used for ventilation.  

 

Previously the Post Portal connected to Newmont's Deep Post underground mine, however, 

this area  has since been backfilled. 

 

MINE DESIGN 
Ultimate pit limits were determined by generating Whittle pit shells based on the net cash 

generated and the pit slopes recommended by Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd. (Piteau, 

2006).  Based on these results, the engineering team designed the final pit with haul ramps 

and appropriate catch benches.  Haul ramps were designed to be 140 ft wide, including a 

safety berm for double lane traffic accommodating the 330 ton class haul trucks, and have a 

maximum grade of 10%.  Mining thickness is 40 ft in waste and 20 ft in ore to help minimize 

dilution.  In ore, triple benching is utilized creating 60 ft faces between catch benches.  

Barrick optimizes mining by using a multi-phased approach which maximizes stripping rates 

to keep an ore producing face available as much as possible.  This multi-phase technique 

consists of a primary ore layback, a primary stripping layback, and a secondary stripping

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 16-2 

layback.  Historically, this approach was put in place to maintain a consistent mill feed, and 

keep mine production in the range of 14 to 15 benches per layback per year.   

 

Mine models are developed using Maptek's Vulcan® software, which is then converted to 

Deswik® software for mine design or output to Whittle 4X® that employs the Lerchs-

Grossmann (LG) pit optimization algorithm.  Whittle produces a series of pit shells based on 

multiple gold prices.  The design of the phases is based on taking the most profitable pit 

shells first.  The phase designs are completed using Deswik® mine planning software.  

These are all well recognized software packages and are commonly used for open pit mine 

optimization.    

 

The pit design is based on 40 ft benches in the waste and where possible 60 ft benches in 

the ore mined in 20 ft cuts.  Slopes vary based on location.  Table 16-1 shows the general 

final pit slope design criteria discussed later in this chapter.  Figure 16-1 illustrates the 

ultimate pit outline.

Barrick Gold Corporation - Goldstrike Mine 

 
Haul Road Width 140 ft 
Haul Road Grade    10% 
Mining Bench Height - Waste 40 ft 
Mining Bench Height - Ore 20 ft 
Minimum Operating Width 150 ft 
Design Operating Width 250 ft 

 

RPA reviewed the pit designs and believes that they follow good engineering practice.  All 

phases are designed with a minimum of 250 ft operating width, with some minor cuts at 150 

ft.  All haul roads are designed at a 10% maximum grade.  There is sufficient room between 

phases to allow for operating room, and roads and ramps have been delineated.

GEOMECHANICS 
Goldstrike utilizes Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd, as the primary design consultant for 

recommendations on geotechnical controls for all open pit layback designs.  The formulation 

of slope design criteria involves consideration of the predicted failure modes that could 

impact the slope at the bench, inter-ramp, and overall scales.  The level of stability for each 

of these assumed failure modes is then assessed and compared with the acceptance criteria 

for that particular slope (typically, a design factor of safety of 1.2 for overall slopes). 

 
ULTIMATE PIT 
A formal review of slope design parameters for the north wall of the Ultimate Pit was 

performed by Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd in 2006, based on the B24A16W Ultimate 

Mine design.  Recommended inter-ramp slope angles, taken from Piteau's review of the 

ultimate B24A16W slopes, are projected onto the current Mine Plan. 

 
NORTH BETZE LAYBACK 
Mining of the North Betze Layback began during the second quarter of 2013, after the 

removal of the Rodeo backfill plant in the first quarter of 2013.  Completion of this layback 

expected first quarter 2017.  

 
3NW and 4NW – Interaction with Underground   
Recommended inter-ramp slope angles for those portions of the ultimate highwall comprised 

of the 3 NW and 4 NW Laybacks will be updated as appropriate upon receipt of formal 

recommendations from Piteau.  

 

From RPA's review, work completed by Piteau was of an appropriate scope and the pit 

design is based on reasonable engineering analysis and assumptions.  Pit slope ranges by 

mining phase are listed below: 

• Phase 3NW – 38 to 46° 
• Phase 4NW – 38 to 46° 
• Phase West Barrel (WB) – 32 to 44° 

 
5TH NORTHWEST LAYBACK 
Pit optimization indicated that a 5NW layback was viable, and a phase design was 

completed.  Further geotechnical drilling and evaluation for final pit wall design and 

conversion from resource to reserve is planned for 2017.

MINE EQUIPMENT 
The current mine equipment fleet will be used throughout the mine life to the end of 2027.  

The current fleet is shown in Table 16-2. 

 

Mine mobile equipment production rates were reviewed with availability and utilization to see 

if mining production rates and costs are appropriate.  Table 16-3 shows the current 

production capacity of the fleet.  It is RPA's opinion that there are sufficient trucks, loaders, 

and support equipment in the LOM plan to meet the production requirements.

UNDERGROUND 
Underground mine production comes from the Rodeo, Meikle, North Post, and Banshee 

areas.  The underground mine consists of ten separate orebodies stretching over a length of 

12,000 ft, and a vertical distance from approximately 600 ft to 2,000 ft below surface.  At the 

southern end of the underground zones, the pit workings cut the underground zones.  There 

are both shaft and ramp entries to the mine.  The mine layout is shown in Figure 16-2.  The 

underground operations commenced in 1996. The underground mine is a trackless 

operation. 

 

As shown in Table 16-5, the underground gold production has decreased over time with the 

reduction in head grade and despite increases in the production rate.  In recent years, the 

production has been approximately 450,000 ounces per year.  Recently, mine production 

tonnage has been over 1.6 million tons per year (approximately 4,500 stpd).

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 16-9 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
The pastefill plant was commissioned at Rodeo in 2013.  The method utilizes tailings from 

the Roaster facility mixed with cement.  This method replaced backfill from the Rodeo 

cemented rockfill plant in 2013 when the open pit mined through the plant's aggregate 

delivery raise.  Pastefill is cheaper and more efficient than the cemented rock fill and offers 

another way to dispose of Roaster tailings. 

 

MINE DESIGN 
DESIGN CRITERIA 
The Goldstrike deposits are all Carlin type deposits, with fine to very finely disseminated gold 

and arsenic bearing pyrite.  The host rocks are generally sedimentary, mostly calcareous 

formations, frequently altered and decalcified.  There is hydrothermal alteration and there are 

collapse structures which generated the breccias that host the deposits.  The alteration and 

folding and faulting have led to poor rock quality in the deposits in generally and locally very 

poor ground conditions in the vicinity of the major faults. 

 

The geometry of the deposits is variable from flat-lying to pipe-like, with irregular shapes due 

to the alteration.  A summary of the deposit dimensions and characteristics is provided in 

Table 16-6.

While the deposits extend below the 3,500 ft elevation, the mine has only been dewatered to 

that level.  Mineral Reserves are not included from any material that is below the 3,500 ft 

elevation.  There is potential to increase the Mineral Reserves at depth if dewatering is 

extended further. 

 
GROUND CONDITIONS/STABILITY 
Rock mechanics advice and direction is generally provided by a rock mechanics engineer on 

the staff of the technical services department supported by a consultant, R. Langston P.E.  

Mr. Langston provides guidance on specific issues and comments upon the ground control 

manual. 

 

Ground conditions are poor due to the alteration of the original structures, which is further 

aggravated by acidic groundwater in some areas and locally hot and humid conditions within 

the mine.  

 

The generally low-strength rock conditions are the key factor in the mine design and mining 

method selection.   

 
MINING METHODS 
Two main mining methods are used underground at the Goldstrike Mine, both of which rely 

on cemented backfill for support.   

 

In relatively good to fair ground conditions, where longhole stoping methods are used, the 

wall and back instability is reduced by mining smaller, longhole sections and filling before 

taking the next section.  In poor ground, the underhand drift and fill method provides a 

backfill roof for subsequent lifts in the mining cycle. 

 

The underhand drift and fill method is utilized in areas of Fair to Poor ground conditions 

regardless of the width of the zone.  The underhand drifts are nominally designed as 15 ft 

wide by 15 ft high.  The minimum width is 15 ft.  The primary drift is driven with increased 

ground support to hold the ground open, then backfilled with a high strength cemented rock 

fill at the Meikle mine, pastefill at the Rodeo and North Post mine.  Where the ore width 

exceeds the nominal drift width, subsequent drifts are developed (parallel or at oblique 

angles to the primary drift) and then backfilled.  This process continues until the entire ore 

shape at a given elevation has been excavated and filled.  Successive lifts are taken beneath

the primary workings, utilizing the backfill as an engineered back.  This method can provide a 

consistent production rate from a mining area given a sufficient number of headings to 

complete the full mining cycle.  

 

Transverse longhole stopes are designed at various heights ranging from 35 ft to 85 ft, based 

on the existing and planned sill development levels used in the active mining areas.  Stope 

widths are designed at 20 ft to 25 ft, based on the ground conditions.  In secondary stopes, 

the width is dictated by the actual dimensions of the adjacent primary stopes.  Development 

of the secondary sills may be reduced to 13 ft leaving a rock "skin" to account for poor quality 

backfill in the adjacent stopes.  The overall stope length is based on the transverse 

dimension of the ore, however, individual stopes can be limited to 45 ft.  Transverse longhole 

stopes are designed with at least 60o hanging walls and with subvertical footwalls.  

 

Transverse longhole stoping is used where the mineralized zone has a significant width.  

Footwall drifts are driven parallel to the strike of the ore to provide access for stoping.  Mining 

with transverse stopes requires a primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary extraction to 

completely mine out the area.  

 

Longitudinal stopes are occasionally utilized in areas of the mine where the geometry and 

ground conditions allow.  The stopes are accessed from a footwall drive and then driven 

parallel to the strike of ore.  If the strike length of the ore is greater than 60 ft, the 

development is driven to the end and the stope is mined in a retreat fashion in sections no 

longer than 60 ft.  Each section is mined and filled before the next section is mined.  If 

ground conditions are poor, the longhole stope section length can be reduced.   

 

Overhand drift and fill, back stoping, and benching are all used to a much lesser extent, 

based on ground conditions and the geometry of the ore zones. 

 

RPA considers the selection of mining methods and the design practices to be appropriate 

for the deposits. 

 
UNDERGROUND MINE DEVELOPMENT 
Development since 2006 through November 2016 has ranged above and below plan though, 

overall. The development has been less than planned in 2016.  The total 2016 development 

compared to plan and budget is shown in Table 16-7.

GROUND SUPPORT 
All headings are supported immediately after blasting following the ground control standards 

for Goldstrike underground based on the mining area, mining method and surrounding 

material.  Rock bolts are generally coated Swellex bolts to reduce the impact of corrosion 

due to the acid waters.  If headings are left unsupported, there is a high potential for failure of 

the back and ribs. 

 

Where development is under cemented backfill, there is no support used in the back as the 

fill is designed to have adequate strength to remain unsupported.  There are issues with 

some of the older backfill which is of poor quality, and there can be failures of this fill either 

from failure of the back or runs of fill from the walls as a secondary stope is developed.  

  

There is a planned program of re-support of headings (rehabilitation) based on observations 

and records.  The costs are identified in the mine budget as a quantity per month, while the 

exact areas where replacement of the ground support will be needed are identified on an on-

going basis. 

 

MINE EQUIPMENT 
The current underground mobile equipment consists of over 230 pieces of mobile equipment 

including 24 load-haul-dump units, 28 haul trucks, 13 jumbos, longhole drills, and 15 bolters.  

There are underground shops for maintenance and repair of underground equipment. 

 

The mobile equipment fleet is summarized in Table 16-8.

RPA is of the opinion that the LOM will be extended beyond that shown in Table 16-9, and 

that individual years will have higher production, through the conversion of Mineral 

Resources to Mineral Reserves, and the direct mining of Mineral Resources as they are 

encountered over the course of development and mining.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
MINERAL PROCESSING 
There are two ore processing facilities at Goldstrike.  They are: 

 

1. An autoclave circuit, consisting of: 
o Grinding circuits 
o Acid and alkaline POX autoclave circuits, followed by 
o RIL circuit, using CaTs for gold dissolution instead of cyanide. 

 
2. A roaster circuit, consisting of: 

o Dry grinding circuits 
o Two-stage fluid bed roasting 
o CIL gold recovery 

 

Depending on various factors, including gold content, carbonate content, carbonaceous 

carbon reactivity, and sulphide sulphur content, ore is dispatched to various stockpiles 

located at either the autoclave or the roaster.  Planned distribution of ore from the stockpiles 

is an extensive exercise which is carried out monthly by the strategic planning department to 

maintain optimal blends designed to maximize gold recovery.  All of the underground ore is 

processed in the roasters. 

 

Figure 17-1 shows the overall process flowsheet for the pressure oxidation sulphide 

treatment plant, including crushing and grinding, POX (autoclaves), neutralization, resin in 

leach (RIL), tailings deposition, resin stripping, and the refinery.  Goldstrike has stopped 

using cyanide for gold dissolution at the Autoclave circuit and is using thiosulfate, which is 

produced on site. Carbon has also been replaced by resin in the gold recovery circuit.

PROCESS DESCRIPTION 

ACID/ALKALINE POX CIRCUIT 
Ore to the autoclave circuit is blended from various stockpiles stationed at the crushing area. 

 
CRUSHING AND GRINDING CIRCUIT  
The grinding circuit was developed in two phases, Phase I and Phase II, as the operation 

expanded.  The total capacity of both phases is 17,500 stpd.  The Phase I circuit is fed by a 

50 in. by 60 in. jaw crusher.  The crushed ore is stored in a stockpile.  Ore is withdrawn from 

the stockpile by reclaim feeders and fed to a 22 ft diameter semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) 

mill operating in closed circuit with a pebble cone crusher.  The SAG mill discharge is 

pumped to the ball mill circuit operating in closed circuit with a bank of six 20 in. diameter 

cyclones.  There are two ball mills operating, one 12.5 ft diameter by 14 ft long and the other 

12.5 ft diameter by 18 ft long.  The overflow from the cyclones feeds a tertiary 16 ft diameter 

by 23.5 ft long ball mill operating in closed circuit with a bank of six 30 in. diameter cyclones.  

(The third stage grinding circuit is not shown in Figure 17-1.)  The cyclone overflow feeds 

one of two thickeners, one 100 ft diameter thickener and one 125 ft diameter thickener, 

which are common to the Phase I and Phase II grinding circuits.  A third 100 ft diameter 

thickener is used to recycle process solution as make-up water for the grind circuit. 

 

The Phase II circuit is fed by a 42 in. diameter by 65 in. long gyratory crusher, which also 

discharges to a crushed ore stockpile.  Ore is withdrawn from the stockpile by reclaim 

feeders and fed to a 24 ft diameter SAG mill operating in closed circuit with a pebble cone 

crusher.  The SAG mill discharge is pumped to the ball mill circuit operating in closed circuit 

with a bank of twelve 20 in. diameter cyclones.  The underflow from the cyclones is fed to a 

16.5 ft diameter by 30.5 ft long ball mill.  The cyclone overflow feeds one of the two 

thickeners that are common to both grinding circuits. 

 

One grinding circuit is fed alkaline ore, while the other is fed acidic ore.  These are kept 

separate through the crushing, grinding, thickening, and autoclaving circuits.  These feeds 

are combined in the neutralization circuit. 

 
ACIDULATION  
The thickener underflow for the acidic ore is fed to a series of acidulation tanks where 

sulphuric acid is added to reduce the carbonate content, thereby reducing the potential 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 17-4 

carbon dioxide gas that will be generated in the autoclaves. This is required to maximize the 

use of oxygen for oxidation in the autoclave under acidic conditions.  

 
ACID POX CIRCUIT 
There are five autoclaves operating in parallel at the Goldstrike Mine, three of which are set 

up for alkaline ore oxidation.  Each one has similar unit operations (the alkaline autoclaves 

have an additional off-gas processing system to capture fugitive mercury emissions).  The 

ground, acidified slurry is fed to a series of preheaters (splash heaters) where hot steam from 

the autoclave discharge flash tank is contacted with the new feed in order to preheat the 

material using available heat from the oxidation reactions.  The sulphide oxidation reaction is 

carried out under elevated pressure and temperature in the autoclaves.  High purity oxygen 

is also added as the oxidant.  The reaction is exothermic and the temperature is controlled in 

the autoclave by the addition of water for cooling or steam for heating, as required.  The 

autoclave discharge passes through a series of flash vessels to let down the pressure.  The 

slurry is then sent to a series of tube and shell slurry coolers for further cooling. 

 

The autoclave products are very acidic due to the generation of sulphuric acid by the 

sulphide oxidation reaction that occurs in the autoclaves.  The pH of the slurry is increased to 

8.0 to 8.5 with the addition of slaked lime in a series of neutralization tanks, followed by 

thiosulfate leaching concurrent with RIL.  

 
ALKALINE POX CIRCUIT 
As the carbonate levels in a portion of the ores at the Goldstrike Mine have increased, three 

of the autoclaves have been converted such that they can operate in an alkaline 

environment, as needed.  This is not shown in Figure 17-1, but the ore flow is as follows.  

The grinding circuit product is sent to a thickener that is dedicated to the alkaline POX 

operation.  From the thickener the slurry is sent to one of the acidulation tanks for storage, 

but no acid is added.  The circuit is set up so that feed from the storage tank can be pumped 

to the designated preheaters as required and processed through the autoclave.  Due to the 

high carbonate concentration, the autoclave reaction does not generate excess acid and the 

designated flash tank discharge, after being cooled in the slurry coolers, goes to 

neutralization where it is mixed with the acidic discharge.  This mixture is neutralized to a pH 

of about 8 and then sent to the RIL circuit for gold recovery.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 17-5 

TCM PROCESS 
The slurry from the alkaline and acid autoclave circuits is pumped to two Resin in Leach 

(RIL) circuits, each made up of seven tanks.  Cyanide has been replaced by calcium 

thiosulphate (CaTs) for gold dissolution. CaTs is manufactured on site and is recovered for 

re-use from tailings process water.  The slurry flows through the series of tanks from tank 0 

through tank 6 and some of the resin is pumped counter-current to the slurry, while a portion 

is pumped concurrent into the lead RIL tank only.  From the first tank, loaded resin is 

transferred to the elution and refining circuit for recovery of the gold.  The slurry exiting the 

seventh tank in the series is sent to a tailings thickener, and then pumped to a new dedicated 

tailings storage facility (TSF3).  This was required in order that any reclaimed water could not 

contain residual cyanide. The reclaimed water is sent to a water treatment plant for CaTs 

recovery for re-use. 

 
ELUTION AND REFINING CIRCUIT 
Gold bearing resin is processed in a multi-stage elution circuit.  The complex chemical 

stages include copper elution, as well as elution of the gold using trithionate.  Pregnant 

solution containing the gold is forwarded to a new electrowinning and existing gold smelting 

circuit.  The stripped and regenerated resin is returned to the RIL circuit. 

 

The electrowinning cells contain stainless steel anodes and cathodes.  A low voltage 

electrical current is passed through the cell electrodes and the gold from the solutions is 

deposited onto the cathodes or forms sludge in the bottom of the cells.  Periodically, the 

cathodes are sprayed with high pressure water to remove the gold bearing sludge, which is 

then filtered and passed through a retort to remove mercury.  The dry sludge is smelted with 

fluxes in an induction furnace to produce a gold doré, which is shipped off site for further 

refining. 

 

ROASTER OPERATION 
Fluid bed roasters were constructed in 1999 to treat carbonaceous refractory ores that could 

not be treated effectively by the existing POX circuit.  The roasters use high purity (99.5% 

O2) oxygen to remove organic carbon and sulphide sulphur prior to processing in a 

conventional CIL circuit.  An overview of the roaster operation is shown in Figure 17-2.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 17-7 

There are two circuits, each including crushing, dry grinding, two stage roasting, calcine 

quenching, and dust and gas handling operations.  The quenched gas goes to the gas 

cleaning stage, which is common to both roaster circuits, and the calcine is processed in a 

common neutralization and CIL circuit.  The loaded carbon is sent to the main refinery for 

elution, regeneration, and production of the gold doré. 

 
CRUSHING 
Ore is reclaimed from one of the roaster stockpiles and goes through two stages of open 

circuit crushing, comprising a gyratory crusher, scalping screen, and screen oversize cone 

crusher.  The screen undersize and the cone crusher product are sent to a coarse ore 

stockpile. 

 
DRY GRINDING 
Ore is reclaimed from the coarse ore stockpile by apron feeders and conveyed to one of the 

two grinding circuits.  The ore is heated using a propane burner in order to dry it.  The dry ore 

then flows toward the centre of the mill where it is removed through screens for classification 

into product size material through either a static cyclone classifier for the dust, which is 

recovered in a bag house, or a dynamic classifier for the oversized material, which either 

returns the material back to the other side of the grinding mill for further grinding or forwards 

the sized material to bag houses for material recovery.  The material in the bag houses is 

sent to a roaster silo as feed to the roaster; the material has a target product size of 80% 

passing (P80) 74 µm. 

 
TWO STAGE ROASTING 
Material from the roaster silo is fed to the top of the roaster by a bucket elevator and a 

fluidized feeder.  The fluidized feeder distributes ore continuously to the first stage (upper) 

bed of the roaster.  The upper bed temperature is maintained at a range between 524°C and 

593°C by the exothermic reaction of the ore and addition of coal to maintain the necessary 

fuel value of the feed.  Water is added as required to maintain temperature control when 

cooling is needed.  The ore is primarily oxidized in the first stage of the roasters. 

  

Solids discharge by gravity continuously to the second stage through the inter-stage solids 

transfer system.  The temperature is maintained in the range of 524°C to 561°C.  Oxidation is 

essentially completed in the second stage, achieving approximately 99% oxidation of the 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 17-8 

sulphide sulphur and greater than 90% oxidation of the organic carbon.  Material from the 

second stage of the roaster discharges by gravity to the calcine quench system. 

 

High purity oxygen is added to the bottom of the second stage bed of the roasters.  The hot 

oxygen rich gas flows up through the roaster and provides both fluidization of material in the 

first stage bed and rapid oxidation of carbon, sulphide sulphur, and fuel contained in the 

upper bed. 

 

The exhaust gas from each stage is classified using dry cyclones.  The coarse material 

recovered from the exhaust gas is returned to the roaster for further treatment and the fine 

material is forwarded to gas quenching and final dust scrubbing.  The off-gas from the final 

dust scrubbers from both circuits are recombined for final off-gas cleaning. 

 
OFF-GAS CLEANING 
The final gas cleaning circuit combines the essentially dust free off-gas from both roasters 

and removes mercury, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxides.  Mercury 

removal is achieved through the calomel process where chlorine is used to remove the 

mercury in an adsorption tower.  The recovered mercury is shipped off site.  The sulphur 

dioxide (SO2) is recovered using a lime rich solution in an SO2 scrubber.  The carbon 

monoxide is oxidized through heating of the gas stream after SO2 removal in a carbon 

monoxide incinerator.  Nitrous oxides are removed by the gas passing through a mist stream 

of ammonia.  The gas then exits through a stack to the atmosphere. 

 
CALCINE QUENCHING/NEUTRALIZATION 
The treated calcine from the roaster is sent to a quench tank to reduce temperature.  Water 

recovered from the neutralization circuit is used to cool the calcine. 

 

The cooled quench tank discharge is combined.  The resulting slurry feeds two neutralization 

tanks where milk-of-lime is added for pH control in order to safely leach the ore with cyanide.  

After leaving the neutralization tanks, the material is sent to a thickener to recover excess 

water for cooling and reuse in the quench tanks.  The thickener underflow reports to the 

roaster CIL circuit.

ROASTER CIL 
The slurry from neutralization tanks is pumped to a CIL circuit, which has eight agitated 

tanks. Cyanide can be added to the first, second, and/or third tanks.  Slurry flows through the 

series of tanks, from tank 1 through tank 8.  Activated carbon is pumped counter-currently 

from the eighth tank to the first tank.  When loaded carbon is transferred out of the first tank, 

it passes over a screen that separates the carbon from the slurry.  The carbon then is 

transferred to a loaded carbon holding bin and further to a truck that takes it to the main 

elution and refining operation located adjacent to the POX operations.  The slurry exiting the 

final CIL tank is sent to a cyanide destruction reactor before being transferred to the tailings 

storage facility (North Block).

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
SITE  

TRANSPORTATION 
The Goldstrike Mine property is located in north central Nevada, approximately 25 mi north of 

the town of Carlin.  Access to the property is provided by certain access agreements with 

Newmont that allow for the use of various roads in the area, and a right-of-way issued by the 

BLM.  Such roads are accessed from Elko, Nevada, by travelling west on US Interstate 80 to 

Carlin, Nevada, and then by approximately 27 mi of local roads north of Carlin.  The roads 

are well maintained and most are paved.  Commercial air service is available to Elko.  

Barrick provides bus and light vehicle transportation to all employees from Elko, Spring 

Creek, and Carlin to the mine site.  

 

HOUSING 
Employees reside in mainly Elko or Carlin and commute to site daily.  There are no housing 

facilities at the operation.  

 

COMMUNICATIONS 
Normal communication channels through cell phone, satellite, and land-based facilities are 

available. 

 

NATURAL GAS 
Natural gas is delivered via a natural gas pipeline.  The natural gas pipeline is a continuation 

of the NEP that is a lateral of the Ruby Pipe Line and extends to a metering station at the 

fence line of the Goldstrike Mine property.  The new pipeline starts at the main metering 

station located at the southeast corner of the Goldstrike Mine property.  The pipeline 

terminates at several locations where major pieces of equipment are located within the 

autoclave and roaster facilities.  

 

An integral part of the work was the conversion of all major consumers from propane-fired to 

natural gas-fired service.  Conversion includes burners, burner controls, and two sub 

metering flow/pressure regulation stations where gas parameters are adjusted to an

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 18-2 

operating range. The entire four miles of pipeline has been constructed within the fence line 

of the Goldstrike Mine property. 

 

POWER 
Electrical power is transmitted to the mine by Sierra Pacific Power.  Electrical facilities 

include three main substations (Mill, South Block, and Bazza), several smaller substations 

throughout the property, and transmission lines. 

 

In October 2005, Barrick started up the Western 102 power plant that is located 

approximately 15 miles east of Reno, Nevada.  It has the capacity to supply 115 MW of 

electricity to the Goldstrike Mine using 14 reciprocating gas-fired engines.  The power plant 

provides the Goldstrike property with the flexibility to generate its own power or buy cheaper 

power from other producers, with the goals of minimizing the cost of power consumed and 

enhancing the reliability of electricity availability at its mine (PMEG, 2007). 

 

WATER MANAGEMENT 
Water management operations at the Goldstrike Mine include a system of dewatering wells, 

water gathering and conveyance facilities, water storage, water use, and various 

management options for discharge of excess water. 

 

The major water management components are: 

• Mine dewatering wells and water collection systems. 
o Betze Pit dewatering is accomplished through peripheral perimeter and in-pit 

wells, horizontal drains for passive dewatering of pit walls and water collection 
sumps in the pit bottom.  Two new in-pit wells were installed in 2014 to 
replace wells that will be mined out by the open pit in 2016 by the 3NW 
layback. 

o Water is conveyed by pipelines to various use areas (process water tanks, mill 
facilities, water trucks, sanitary uses) for both Barrick and Newmont's use. 

o Water not used for mining or milling is pumped to the TS Ranch Reservoir. 
 

• TS Ranch Reservoir 
o The reservoir has a natural occurring permeable fracture in the floor of the 

reservoir to a rhyolite formation to which the water infiltrates. 
o Approximately 19,000 USgpm is discharged to the reservoir from the Barrick 

and Newmont operations. 
 

• Springs & Sand Dune Canal 

o Water flowing to the rhyolite formation creates three new springs and is 
collected by the Sand Dune Canal and Pond.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 18-3 

o Water can be diverted to irrigation, infiltration, or injection as required. 
o An arsenic treatment plant at the end of the canal is available to treat naturally 

occurring arsenic prior to infiltration or injection.  
 

• Irrigation in Boulder Valley 
o Water is provided to two ranches during irrigation season (April-September) 

as required. 
o Available from Sand Dune Canal or TS Ranch Reservoir (if required). 
 

• Infiltration 
o Two rapid infiltration basins (RIBs) are located in upper Boulder Valley and 

can be used when necessary.  
o The two RIBs have a combined capacity of 70,140 gpm. 
 

• Injection 
o Barrick has five injection wells to inject water into the rhyolite formation in 

upper Boulder Valley. 
o Currently not being actively used.  
 

• Sand Dune Drainage Embankments 
o Three temporary embankments constructed at down gradient of Sand Dune 

Canal. 
o Mostly dry except for excessive rain or snowfall events. 
 

• Humboldt River Discharge Authorization 
o Barrick has permit to discharge up to 70,000 USgpm to the river, but only 

discharged, after treatment, for a 16 month period from September 1997 to 
February 1999.  

o Presently Barrick is not operating the treatment plant or discharging to the 
river, but maintains the permit and facilities. 

 

OPEN PIT 
Open Pit infrastructure includes: 

• Waste Rock Facilities 
o Bazza Waste Rock Facility - The Bazza Waste Rock Facility is located west 

and southwest of the Betze-Post Pit.  The Bazza Waste Rock Facility has an 
approximate plan surface area of 2,843 acres and a maximum height of 
approximately 700 ft above the ground surface.  As of the end of 2010 the 
majority of the Bazza Waste Rock Facility has been reclaimed.  This acreage 
has been re-graded, has had cover and growth media placed as described in 
the Bazza Waste Rock Management and Permanent Closure plans, and has 
been seeded with an approved mixture. 

o Clydesdale Waste Rock Facility – located approximately 3,500 ft west of the 
Betze-Post Pit with permitted height of 500 ft, the Clydesdale Waste Rock 
Facility is the active facility external of the pit.  
 

• Haul Roads - Haul roads connect the Betze-Post Pit and the Meikle and Rodeo 
underground mines to the Waste Rock Facilities, the ore processing facilities, and the 
ore stockpiling areas.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 18-4 

• Ore Stockpiles – stockpiles are maintained at the Roaster Processing Facility, 
Autoclave/TCM Processing Facility, within pit disturbance on backfill and on the 
Bazza Waste Rock Facility. 
 

• Heap Leach Facilities - The North Block Heap Leach Facility, which was located on 
the North Block, has been decommissioned.  The spent leach material has been 
removed to the North Block Tailings Impoundment, and the facilities removed to 
facilitate development of the North Block Tailings Impoundment embankment and ore 
stockpiles in the area.  The AA Heap Leach Facility has been decommissioned and 
reclaimed and is now undergoing closure. 
 

• Ancillary Support Facilities 
o Truck Shop and Offices 
o Emergency Vehicle Storage 
o Heavy Equipment Fuel Bay 
o Tire Shop 
o Dispatch 
o Southwest Energy Shop and Silos 
o Explosives Magazines 
o Geotechnical and Survey Laydown areas 
o Geotechnical Monitoring Stations and Radar 

 

UNDERGROUND 
There is extensive infrastructure for the underground division.  The entire infrastructure for 

the mine is operational and in place, and, where necessary, there are plans to improve and 

augment the infrastructure as required for future operations.   

 

SHAFTS 
There are two access shafts for the mine - the Meikle shaft and the Rodeo shaft.  Both are 

used for personnel and materials, while, ore is only hoisted via the Meikle shaft.  The Meikle 

shaft is approximately 1,800 ft deep extending to the 3700 ft level, while the Rodeo shaft is 

1,300 ft deep and extends to the 4,100 ft level. 

 

Hoist operation in both shafts is automated with human oversight provided.  There are 

ventilation shafts and boreholes for ventilation in both the Meikle and Rodeo mines. 

 

RAMPS 
There are three ramps to surface, all three daylight into the open pit.  The Betze No. 1 portal 

is a fresh air intake and used for both vehicular traffic and movement of ore to the pit.  The 

Betze No. 2 portal is an emergency exit and a fresh air intake for the North Post.  Some ore

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 18-5 

from the underground is hauled by truck to a dump area in the pit and subsequently moved 

by open pit haulage trucks to the mill area. 

 

MATERIAL HANDLING 
Materials and supplies for the mine are moved into the mine via the two man shafts or by the 

ramp, as necessary.  Ore and waste are either hoisted up the Meikle shaft or hauled to 

surface via the portal in the open pit.  All ore and waste to be hoisted at the Meikle shaft must 

be trammed to the ore dumps at the shaft.  For ore from the Rodeo mine, this means a one 

mile haul using 30-ton underground trucks from the Rodeo mine upgrade to the dump at the 

Meikle shaft.  At the Meikle shaft ore dumps, there are rock breakers and grizzlies to reduce 

the muck size being fed to the loading pocket in the shaft. 

   

BACKFILL 
Backfill is used in all stoping methods at the Goldstrike Mine and the problems due to poor 

quality backfill from the past do impact upon the short-term mine planning.  At Meikle the 

backfill system consists of passes and underground aggregate storage.  Rodeo utilizes a 

surface paste plant which delivers pastefill via a bore hole to mine levels.     

 
MEIKLE 
Aggregate comes from open pit waste which is crushed to three inch minus by a contractor.  

The aggregate is delivered through a lined borehole from the surface to the 925 level bins at 

Meikle.  The binder is 50:50 cement and fly ash.  Admixtures are used for stabilization and 

retardation as necessary.  The Meikle backfill plant is located on the 1075 level and has a 

seven cubic yard batch mixer.  Depending on the fill strength desired, the binder is varied 

from five to seven percent.  The mixer combines water, aggregate, and powdered binder.  

Backfill is delivered to stopes via trucks.   

 
RODEO 
The pastefill plant was constructed in 2012 and it was commissioned in 2013. The pastefill 

plant takes tailings from the roaster and sizes material with cyclones.  The tailings then go 

through a thickener tank and disc filters to get to 77.5% solids.  At this point the material is 

mixed to have 9% cement and is then pumped down a borehole to the underground.  

Bulkheads are used while filling stopes to hold the material in place as it cures.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 18-6 

VENTILATION 
Mine ventilation is achieved using a system comprised of intake and exhaust fans.  The 

Banshee raise uses one 700 hp axial fan to downcast 320,000 cfm of fresh air.  The Meikle 

shaft uses four 250 hp axial fans to provide 525,000 cfm of fresh air. The Rodeo shaft uses 

four 250 hp axial fans to provide 550,000 cfm of fresh air.  There are 1,100,000 million cfm 

being pulled through the Betze No. 1 and No. 2 portals from the pit.   

 

Mine air is exhausted by two 700 hp centrifugal fans on the Meikle borehole, two 1750 

centrifugal fans on the Meikle exhaust shaft, two 1500 hp axial fans on the Rodeo exhaust 

shaft and two 700 hp axial fans forcing air out the North Post portal.  In addition, there are 

110 auxiliary fans spread throughout the underground, installed to ventilate work places 

away from the main air stream.   

 

There are mine air coolers on the mine air intakes as well as three spray chambers for mine 

air cooling and dust removal.  The intake air is cooled through a surface refrigeration plant. 

 

To keep ahead of the Mine Safety and Health Administration's regulation related to diesel 

particulate matter (dpm) in the mine air, Goldstrike uses biofuels to reduce the dpm levels in 

the mine.    

 

DEWATERING 
Mine workings are dewatered by a system of pumps and wells operated by the Open Pit 

Department, however, all costs are attributed to the underground division.  The underground 

workings are dewatered to the 3500 elevation, with planned dewatering to the 3400 

elevation.   

 

The underground workings are generally dry, however, there are areas of the mine where 

water is present and flowing.  In such areas, the waters are strongly acidic, leading to rapid 

deterioration of unprotected ground support material and steel drain pipes.

MAINTENANCE, POWER, COMPRESSED AIR, COMMUNICATIONS 
There are maintenance shops for underground mobile equipment. 

 

Electrical power is sent to the mine at 120 kV and then distributed throughout the mine at 5 

kV to load centres for use at 480 V as needed. 

Compressed air is provided from surface and distributed by pipelines throughout the mine.  

 

There are telephones at a number of locations in the mine as well as a radio network for use 

in the mine.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 
The Goldstrike Mine operations consist of operating open pit and underground mines plus 

process plant facilities.  The mines and the corporation have environmental groups and 

management systems to ensure that the necessary permits and licences are obtained and 

maintained.  These groups also carry out the required monitoring and reporting.  RPA 

reviewed the management system and discussed permitting and environmental matters with 

site management.  

 

TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY  
Tailings from the roaster operations are deposited in the North Block Tailings Disposal 

Facility (NBTDF) located immediately to the east of the roaster facility and the Meikle mine.  

The NBTDF operates as a zero discharge facility under a Water Pollution Control Permit 

NEV091029 with the Nevada Division of Environment Protection (NDEP) and Jurisdictional 

Dam Permit J-699 with the Nevada Division of Water Resources.  The NBTDF is expanded 

approximately every two years and is currently permitted through a Stage 12 expansion.  

Stage 12 will raise the dam height to 544 ft (crest to downstream toe) using rock fill with an 

average design slope of 2:1V (horizontal to vertical) and will provide for additional capacity of 

112 million tons of tailings.  Total tailings storage capacity Stages 1-12 is estimated at 307 

million tons of tailings. 

  

The NBTDF is lined with a composite liner system consisting of low permeability soil overlain 

by a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and a geo-synthetic liner (either high-density polyethylene 

(HDPE) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)).  The facility includes a basin underdrain 

under a portion of the tailings as well as finger drains to promote consolidation of tailings.  

Tailings supernatant water currently flows from northeast to southwest and water is 

reclaimed for process use.  The closure plan includes capping the tailings surface and 

draining the facility with a closure spillway constructed at the southwest corner.  

 

Tailings from the TCM Leach operations are deposited in the Tailings Storage Facility 3 

(TSF3) located immediately south of the NBTDF.  TSF3 operates as a zero discharge facility 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 20-2 

under a Water Pollution Control Permit NEV091029 with the NDEP and Jurisdictional Dam 

Permit J-662 with the Nevada Division of Water Resources.  TSF3 is expanded 

approximately every two years and is currently constructed through Stage 2 and permitted 

through Stage 6.  The current design provides approximately 110 million tons of tailings 

storage.  

 

The TSF3 is lined with a composite liner system consisting of low permeability soil overlain 

by a GCL and a geomembrane liner (LLDPE).  The facility includes an over-liner drain 

system which promotes consolidation of the tailings.  Consolidation water from the tailings is 

collected by an overliner drain system consisting of a blanket drain and geocomposite strip 

drains which direct the water to collector pipes downgradient to a collection area located at 

the upstream toe of the TSF3 embankment and are ultimately pumped to the supernatant 

pond.  TSF3 also contains an under-liner drain system which allows for a drainage pathway 

for shallow groundwater to be conveyed downstream the main embankment.  The closure 

plan includes capping the tailings surface and draining the facility with a closure spillway 

constructed on the eastern portion of the impoundment. 

 

PROJECT PERMITTING 
The BLM issued a Decision on the Amendment to the Plan of Operations for the 2015 Betze 

Pit Expansion through the Determination of NEPA Adequacy process.  The approval of this 

Amendment ensured the continuance of mining and processing at the Goldstrike Mine.  In 

summary, the Amendment to the Plan of Operations for the 2015 Pit Expansion is listed 

below: 

 

• Expansion of the existing Betze Pit to include two additional laybacks to the north with 
associated in-pit and perimeter haul roads and buffer (43 acres of new disturbance, of 
which 30.6 acres are public land).  

 

On July 6, 2016, NDEP BMRR issued a Surety Decision Approval and Reclamation Permit 

for the NBTDF Stages 11 and 12 Expansion.  The approval of this reclamation permit 

modification ensured the continuance of processing for Goldstrike.

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS 
There are no specifically identified social or community requirements at the Goldstrike Mine, 

however, Goldstrike is a prominent local business and applies world-class social and 

community standards at its operation. 

 

MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
The complete site closure plan gives the details used in the compilation of the 2017 Financial 

Accounting Standards (FAS) 143 closure cost estimate for the Goldstrike Mine  in 

accordance with the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 

specifically International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 

Contingent Assets. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the 

expenditure needed to settle the present obligation arising.  The liability reflects the condition 

of the assets, including the damage to the mine site at the respective period-end. 

 

The costs include not only out-of-pocket expenditure but also internal costs that will be 

incurred that are essential to the closure.  Factors to consider when determining the "best 

estimate" are: 

• expected inflation; 

• advances in technology; 

• productivity improvements; and 

• the particular circumstances faced by the operation or mine. 

 

Management may only take changes in technology or in regulation/legislation into account if 

there is demonstrable evidence that those changes will occur.  

 

In general, at a minimum sites must be left safe and stable, with removal of all infrastructure 

and rehabilitation of all landforms.  Groundwater quality around tailings storage facilities must 

meet licence conditions.  The IFRS liability as at December 31, 2016, for the Goldstrike Mine 

was calculated to be US$147 million.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
The Goldstrike Mine is an operating open pit and underground gold mine.  There are new 

mine projects and sustaining capital requirements, however, there are no preproduction 

requirements. 

 

The open pit and underground capital and operating costs are discussed below. 

 

CAPITAL COSTS 
Current LOM capital costs for the Goldstrike Mine are estimated to be $915 million.  The 

major capital cost for the open pit will be capitalized waste stripping, which is estimated to be 

$362 million.  Capital for the process facilities is estimated to be $143 million, which consists 

primarily of equipment replacement capital or sustaining capital.  Underground mine 

development is projected to be $134 million.   

 

The LOM capital cost estimate is shown in Table 21-1.  Total capital costs itemized per year 

for the major categories are summarized in Table 21-2. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the projected capital costs at the Goldstrike Mine are reasonable.

• Underground mining efficiencies increased production through haulage efficiencies, 
better control of development overbreak, and improved paste crew effectiveness.  
This improved underground mining unit costs by 5%. 
 

• Open pit mining efficiencies decreased equipment operating hours through break 
rotators and parking excess trucks.  This improved open pit mining unit costs by 16%. 
 

• Autoclave/TCM plant efficiencies reduced costs through the use of KPI dashboards 
and short interval control.  This improved TCM unit costs by 4%. 
 

• Roaster plant recoveries increased by 1% with installation of two new CIL tanks, 
commissioned ahead of schedule.  Roaster unit costs improved by 3%.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Based on the site visit and subsequent review, RPA offers the following conclusions. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 
GENERAL 

 Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 
methodologies.  The classification of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Resources 
conforms to CIM definitions. 
 

 The sampling, sample preparation, and analyses are appropriate for the style of 
mineralization and Mineral Resource estimation.  The current drill hole database is 
reasonable for supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.  

 
 The EOY2016 open pit and underground resource block models are reasonable for 

supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. 
 

 The resource modelling procedures are well documented. 
 

 Overall, RPA is of the opinion that Goldstrike has conducted high quality resource 
modelling work that exceeds industry standard practice.  
 

 Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves and are estimated 
effective December 31, 2016 (EOY2016). 
 

 Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 9.07 million tons grading 0.160 
oz/st Au and contain 1.46 million oz Au.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources total 
1.3 million tons grading 0.277 oz/st Au and contain 349,000 oz Au. 
 

 Based on reconciliation results, RPA is of the opinion that the open pit and 
underground resource models are slightly conservative. 

 
OPEN PIT 

 Open pit Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 5.76 million tons grading 
0.078 oz/st Au and contain 447,000 ounces of gold.  In addition, Inferred Mineral 
Resources total 89,000 tons grading 0.056 oz/st Au and contain 5,000 oz Au. 
 

 The on-going work to update the lithology and fault models will improve future open 
pit resource models. 
 

 For 2016, the open pit resource model overstated the tons by 9%, understated the 
gold grade by 21%, and understated the gold ounces by 10% compared to the actual 
open pit production.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 25-2 

UNDERGROUND 
• Underground Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 3.31 million tons 

grading 0.304 oz/st Au and contain 1.01 million oz Au.  Inferred Mineral Resources 
are estimated to be 1.2 million tons grading 0.294 oz/st Au, containing 344,000 oz Au. 
 

• For 2016, the underground resource model understated the tons by 7%, understated 
the gold grade by 9%, and understated the gold ounces by 17% compared to the 
actual underground production.   

 

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 
GENERAL 

• The Mineral Reserve estimates have been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 
methodologies and the classification of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 
conforms to CIM definitions.   
 

• Mine planning at the Goldstrike Mine follows industry standards.   
 

• RPA considers the selection of mining methods and the design practices to be 
appropriate for the deposits. 

 
• Equipment purchases scheduled for the current LOM plan are reasonable.   

 
• The workforce is well trained and capable of achieving the necessary production 

targets established by the engineering department in a safe manner. 
 

• The EOY2016 Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for the open pit, underground, 
stockpiles, and inventory total 77.92 million tons grading 0.104 oz/st Au and contain 
8.08 million oz Au. 
 

• The LOM plan is in place and is based upon current operating experience.  Recovery 
and cost estimates are based upon actual operating data and engineering to support 
a Mineral Reserve statement.  Economic analysis using these estimates generates a 
positive cash flow, which supports a statement of Mineral Reserves.  

 
OPEN PIT AND STOCKPILES 

• Open pit Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves total 13.48 million tons grading 
0.112 oz/st Au, containing 1.51 million oz Au.  
 

• There is potential to add another pit phase (5 NW) to Mineral Reserves, provided 
some uncertainties around the geometry of a weak rock unit are resolved by 
geotechnical drilling and testing. 
 

• Ore control procedures and results for the Goldstrike Mine open pit are well 
documented.  All records have been kept in good condition and are readily 
accessible.

Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 25-3 

• The EOY2016 Proven Mineral Reserves located in 34 different stockpiles are 
estimated to be 58.17 million tons grading 0.081 oz/st Au, containing 4.70 million oz 
Au.  The estimation methods used to track the stockpile tonnages and grades are 
reasonable. 
 

• The stockpiles represent approximately 59% of the Mineral Reserve gold ounces and 
76% of the Mineral Reserve tons. 

 
UNDERGROUND 

• Underground Proven plus Probable Mineral Reserves are estimated to be 6.26 million 
tons grading 0.288 oz/st Au, containing 1.81 million oz Au. 

 
• The reconciliation between production and Mineral Reserves is completed in a 

comprehensive manner on a monthly basis.  Results indicate significant gains over 
Mineral Reserve estimates, due to mining of material classified as Inferred or 
unclassified or rejected due to low confidence rating at the time of the estimate.  This 
material is generally upgraded by infill drilling between the time of the estimate and 
mining.  Interim block model updates would capture this material. 
 

• There is potential to extend Mineral Reserves at depth, given further dewatering to 
depress the water table. 

 

PROCESS 
• RPA confirmed that the procedures used to estimate gold recovery meet industry 

standards. 
 

• Planning the process feed is a well-coordinated and complex operation to ensure ore 
going to the processing operation provides optimum results.  The milling operations 
are well run, safe, and environmentally sound and meet industry standards.   
 

• Implementation of the Thiosulphate Leach Conversion process will extend the useful 
life of the autoclave pressure oxidation (POX) plant and may significantly increase the 
gold production by allowing earlier treatment of ores that were not previously 
amenable to POX. 
 

• The roaster operation was running well during the site visit.   
 

• The adjustments made to the process production data and mill head grades based on 
actual gold production conform to industry standards. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
• Goldstrike has an experienced staff of professionals who are diligent in the 

maintenance of their permits.   
 

• Reclamation estimates are realistic, in RPA's opinion.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the site visits and review of available data, RPA presents the following 

recommendations. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 
OPEN PIT 

• Review/update the composite weighting scheme with more recent reconciliation data. 
 

• Include the underground and blasthole data in future variography studies. 
 

• Investigate using the blasthole, drill hole, and mapping data to build high grade 
wireframes for structurally controlled mineralization. 
 

• Investigate updating the tonnage factors in some areas. 
 
UNDERGROUND 

• Use a resource classification clean-up script or classification wireframes to upgrade a 
small amount of Inferred blocks that are scattered within the Indicated areas. 
 

• Additional density test work is warranted in some areas. 
 

MINING  
• Carry out geotechnical drilling, testing, and analysis to resolve issues with the 5 NW 

pit phase. 
 

• Investigate procedural changes that will improve the underground production 
reconciliation results. 
 

• Use reconciliation results and stope performance analysis to evaluate stope designs 
to determine where improvements in mine planning would be most advantageous.  
 

• Review the long term underground productivity estimates for the next LOM plan as 
the tons per man year in the current plan are forecast to increase over time. 
 

• Continue to evaluate an extension of the dewatering program to access 
mineralization at depth. 
 

• Continue the stockpile sampling program to confirm the grades, especially stockpiles 
that will be processed within the short term.

Barrick Gold Corporation – Goldstrike Mine, Project #2691 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 25, 2017 Page 26-2 

• Continue to sample, test, and review the metallurgical characteristics of the ore 
stockpiles on a periodic basis to ascertain how they may affect the process and 
impact recovery and costs. 
 

• Develop a comprehensive mine planning procedure manual.
