Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-1 

1 SUMMARY 
BACKGROUND AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The Öksüt Gold Project (the Öksüt Project or the Project) is located in the Kayseri province of 

south-central Turkey, 295 km to the southeast of the capital city of Ankara and 48 km directly 

south of the city of Kayseri.  This Technical Report supports the disclosure of the Project's 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates at June 30, 2015 and has been prepared in 

accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 

43-101).  All dollar amounts in this Technical Report are stated in United States dollars (US$) 

unless otherwise noted. 

 

In August 2009, Centerra Gold Inc. (Centerra) entered into a joint venture with Stratex 

International Plc (Stratex), a publicly listed company on the London-based Alternative 

Investment Market (AIM), for the Öksüt Project through its now wholly-owned Turkish 

subsidiary, Öksüt Madencilik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. (OMAS).  In October 2012, Centerra 

increased its interest in the joint venture to 70% after completing total expenditures of $6M on 

exploration.  In January 2013, Centerra purchased Stratex's remaining 30% interest for a cash 

payment of $20M and a 1% net smelter return (NSR) royalty up to a maximum of $20M.  In 

addition to the royalty payable to Stratex's wholly-owned subsidiary Stratex Gold AG (Stratex 

Gold), the Project is also subject to a sliding scale NSR royalty in favour of Teck Resources 

Limited (Teck) as well as a sliding scale royalty in favour of the Turkish Government.  Closing 

of the purchase was also conditional on the granting of two Operation Licences by the Turkish 

authorities, which occurred on January 16, 2013.  Centerra now owns 100% of the Project. 

 

The Öksüt Project was first discovered in 2007 when geological staff of Stratex identified gold 

mineralization in reconnaissance rock chip sampling from outcrops located on what is now 

referred to as the Güneytepe Deposit area.  Prior to this, there is no record of any modern 

exploration for gold being conducted on the property.  In 2008, Stratex followed up these 

surface sampling results with an initial 13-hole diamond drilling program located within the 

Güneytepe Deposit area.

Following the formation of the joint venture, several additional drilling programs were 

completed on the property resulting in the first Centerra publication of a Mineral Resource 

estimate on the Project in February 2013 (effective at December 31, 2012) subsequently 

followed by a revised Mineral Resource estimate published in February 2014 (effective at 

December 31, 2013).  On February 19, 2014, Centerra announced the results of a preliminary 

economic assessment (PEA) on the Project.  An updated Mineral Resource estimate was 

published in February 2015 (effective at December 31, 2014).  On July 28, 2015, Centerra 

announced the results of a Feasibility Study (FS) on the Öksüt Project.   

 

The Öksüt Project is planned as a conventional truck and shovel open pit heap leach mining 

operation.  A total of approximately 26.1 Mt of ore at a grade of 1.4 g/t Au, containing a total of 

approximately 1.2 million ounces of gold, is planned to be mined and stacked over a mine life 

of eight years from two open pits, the Keltepe and the smaller Güneytepe pit.

PROPERTY LOCATION, DESCRIPTION AND CLIMATE 
The Öksüt Project is located in south-central Turkey, 295 km to the southeast of the capital 

city of Ankara and 48 km directly south of the city of Kayseri which has a population of 1.1 

million.  The nearest administrative centre is at Develi (population 64,000) located 

approximately 10 km north of the Project.  Ankara and Kayseri have international airports and 

are serviced by international and domestic airlines.  

 

Currently, travel to the Project is via the paved dual lane road from Kayseri southwards to 

Develi over the eastern flank of Mount Erciyes.  From there, the road connects Develi to the 

town of Gömedi, 33 km to the south-southwest, and then via minor access roads to the village 

of Zile.  The Project site is accessed via a narrow agricultural dirt road from the village of Zile 

and, as a result, access to the site in winter is presently limited. 

 

The Project is located in the Develi Mountains on a north-south trending topographic high.  The 

topographic relief comprises steep-sided V-shaped valleys, and locally, cliffs tens of metres 

high, capped by flat-lying mesas and plateaus.  The Project site is located at an elevation of 

approximately 1,800 m.  The valleys are extensively farmed, with the local population living in 

a number of small villages including the villages of Öksüt and Zile. 

 

The climate is continental with cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers with cool nights 

due to the area's high elevation.  Temperatures range from 10°C to 29°C in summer and -5°C 

to 7°C in winter.  The annual rainfall is approximately 370 mm, generally falling as mixed rain 

and snow in winter and as rain during spring.  Vegetation at higher elevations is predominantly 

scrub oak, small shrubs, and grasses.  

 

The Develi area is well-serviced with electrical power lines.  The Project is expected to be 

supplied from a substation 28 km away, near the town of Sendrimeke.  The proposed all 

weather access to the Project is from EpÒ«e.  Water for the Project will be supplied from two 

wells located just south of the village of EpÒ«e.  These wells have been fully tested, and the 

permits and land rights have been received.  Preliminary reviews of the region suggest that 

there is an abundant level of mining support services and skilled to semi-skilled labour 

available to support a potential mining operation.

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Öksüt Project is a high-sulphidation epithermal gold deposit within the Central Anatolian 

Volcanic Province, part of the Tethyan Metallogenic Belt.  The belt extends from southeastern 

Europe across Turkey, the Caucasus, and on into Pakistan and contains a number of important 

gold and porphyry copper deposits.  Magmatic activity and related ore forming processes are 

the result of the closure of the Tethyan Ocean in response to the collision between the north-

moving Arabian Plate with the Eurasian Plate that began in the late Cretaceous period and 

continues today. 

 

Öksüt gold mineralization is hosted within the Develidağ Volcanic Complex, one of the 

numerous stratovolcanoes situated along the Central Anatolian Fault Zone (CAFZ).  The 

volcanic complex is composed of Miocene basaltic-andesitic volcanic domes, pyroclastic 

rocks, and lava flows.  Flow-banded Pliocene andesite overlies these sequences and the 

Öksüt mineralization to the north and east. 

 

There are several gold occurrences in the Öksüt Project area, the most important of which is 

the Keltepe Deposit.  The distribution of the alteration assemblages and the gold grades at the 

Keltepe Deposit are strongly zoned, with a central massive silica breccia having the highest 

gold grade.  This core is surrounded by quartz-alunite altered volcanic rocks, and as the 

alteration intensity diminishes outwardly, the gold grade decreases. 

 

The Keltepe Deposit has been oxidized to depth, up to 400 m below the surface.  The original 

copper content of the deposit has been completely leached out of the current resources, 

however, zones of oxide copper enrichment are found deeper within the deposit, below the 

planned open pit.  An irregular zone of supergene enrichment exists below the oxide zone, 

with some high grade sulphide copper intersections.  It is surmised that the oxidation of the 

deposit has liberated the gold allowing heap leaching at a relatively coarse crush size. 

 

The nearby Güneytepe Deposit is significantly smaller based on the drilling information 

collected to the end of 2014 and does not show the more straightforward zonation and 

continuity of alteration and gold grades as observed on the Keltepe Deposit.  Silicification is 

intense, however, the host rocks are much less porous, and, as a result, oxidation is restricted 

to the upper 50 m to 75 m of this deposit. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-6 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
Mineral Resources for the Öksüt Project were estimated using a block model constrained with 

three dimensional (3D) wireframes of the principal mineralized domains and incorporating all 

the drilling completed to the date of the resource estimate.  Values for gold were interpolated 

into blocks using ordinary kriging (OK).  The Mineral Resource estimate, exclusive of Mineral 

Reserves, is summarized in Table 1-1. 

 

The resource model update for the Öksüt Project was prepared by Centerra in May 2015, 

using all of the drill holes available as of that date.  ARANZ Leapfrog software was used to 

update the principal mineralized domains at Keltepe and Güneytepe and values for gold were 

interpolated into blocks using OK in GEOVIA GEMS software. 

 

MINERAL RESERVES 
Mineral Reserves are that part of the Mineral Resource that can be legally, safely, and 

profitably mined given a specific set of technical and economic parameters.  These include the 

gold price, mine, mill, and administrative operating costs, metallurgical recovery, geotechnical 

behaviour of the rocks in the future pit walls, and equipment size parameters.  Computer 

software "optimizes" the pit shape by interrogating each block of the block model as to its ability 

to pay for its removal plus the incremental tonnage of waste that must be removed to mine the 

block.  This process results in the creation of one or more "pit shells" which recover the 

economic part of the Mineral Resources and which are then engineered in detail by adding 

ramps for mining access and by smoothing of the pit walls. 

 

The Mineral Reserve estimate at a 0.3 g/t Au cut-off grade for the Keltepe and Güneytepe 

Deposits is summarized in Table 1-1.  All oxide resources classified as either Measured or 

Indicated inside the reserve pits have been classified as Probable Mineral Reserves. 

 

MINING METHODS 
The Öksüt Project is planned as a conventional truck and shovel open pit mine with two pits 

planned to be mined simultaneously, the main Keltepe pit and the small satellite Güneytepe 

pit.  It is planned to use a mining contractor to do all mining using small excavators and 36 



Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-7 

tonne trucks.  The use of this equipment among mining contractors is common in Turkey.  The 

mining contractor will provide and maintain all equipment, and will perform drill, blast, load, 

haul, and road and dump maintenance on a unit cost basis.  Centerra will provide oversight of 

the mining operations, grade control, survey control, mine planning, and other required 

technical services. 

The Keltepe pit will be developed in three cutbacks in order to smooth stripping requirements 

and mine higher grade material earlier in the mine life.  Due to its small size, the Güneytepe 

pit will be developed in a single cutback.  Lower grade material will be stockpiled throughout 

the Project for processing at the end of the mine life.  This allows higher grade material to be 

processed earlier, increasing the Project net present value (NPV).  Tables 1-2 and 1-3 show 

the life-of-mine (LOM) mining and processing schedules.

METALLURGY 
Metallurgical testing has focused on supporting the development of the Öksüt Project as a 

heap leach operation.  Testing has focused on gold recovery at coarse particle sizes.  

Metallurgical testing was initiated in 2012 using samples from existing exploration diamond 

drill holes.  A second program completed in 2012 utilized samples from a single large diameter 

hole to provide the bulk of the sample.  The second program included the first column leach 

tests.  In 2013, four large diameter drill holes were drilled (three in the Keltepe Deposit and 

one in the Güneytepe Deposit) to provide samples for two large scale column leach test 

programs.  A mineralogy program was also completed on the samples from this program.  In 

2014, a further five large diameter drill holes (one in the Güneytepe and four in the Keltepe 

Deposit) were completed to provide samples for additional large scale column leach tests and 

further mineralogical analysis. 

 

The results from all programs show that samples from both the Keltepe and Güneytepe 

Deposits are amenable to heap leach processing.  Leach rates are relatively fast with 

comparatively high final recoveries.  Size by size analysis of the column leach test feed and 

tails samples shows gold evenly distributed among the size classes, roughly following the 

mass splits. 

 

Since the Keltepe Deposit currently contains approximately 90% of the contained gold for the 

Öksüt Project, the leach characteristics for the Keltepe Deposit will predominate.  Güneytepe 

Deposit leach characteristics are expected to be as good as or better than leach characteristics 

of the Keltepe Deposit.  Analyzing all the column test results using a Keltepe average grade of 

1.24 g/t Au, the corresponding leach residue grade will be 0.23 g/t Au, with a resulting recovery 

of 81.4%.  For scale-up purposes, this is discounted by 4% and an Adsorption-Desorption-

Recovery (ADR) efficiency factor of 99% is applied, which results in a design recovery of 77%. 

 

RECOVERY METHODS 
The flowsheet for the Öksüt Project was derived from metallurgical test work primarily 

performed by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (KCA).  The test work results and interpretation 

are described in Section 13 of this report.  The flowsheet is based on an 11,000 tpd heap leach 

operation.  It includes primary crushing, screening and secondary crushing, heap stacking and 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-9 

cyanide leaching, carbon adsorption, carbon stripping and regeneration, electrowinning and 

refining.  The concepts and data presented in this section are taken from the Process 

Flowsheets and Process Design Criteria developed for the Project.   

 

PRIMARY CRUSHING 
Run-of-mine ore will be delivered by 36 tonne haul trucks to the primary crusher.  The ore will 

be dumped on the stationary grizzly installed over the 80 tonne truck dump hopper.  Oversize 

rocks will be handled by a rock breaker.  The ore will be withdrawn from the dump hopper via 

a 2.0 m wide x 4.5 m long grizzly feeder.  The grizzly oversize will feed the 1.5 m x 2.0 m jaw 

crusher that will reduce the rock size to minus 150 mm prior to being conveyed by a 1.4 m 

wide x 95.5 m long belt conveyor to the secondary crushing circuit, along with the grizzly feeder 

undersize.  A self-cleaning belt magnet will be installed over the conveyor belt feeding the 

secondary crusher building.  A metal detector installed after the belt magnet will identify any 

remaining piece of metal and the conveyor will be stopped to allow manual removal by an 

operator. 

 

SECONDARY CRUSHING 
The product from the primary crushing circuit will feed a 2.4 m wide x 6.1 m long double-deck 

screen.  The screen oversize will feed a 600 kW cone crusher while the screen undersize will 

report with the cone crusher product and will be transported by a 1.1 m wide x 50.7 m long belt 

conveyor to a radial stacker after quicklime has been added to the crushing circuit product.  A 

10,000 t capacity stockpile will be formed by the 1.1 m wide x 39 m long stacker installation. 

 

Dust collection units will be provided at the crushers' discharge and transfer points in both 

crushing buildings and a dry fog system will be installed at the truck dump.  If required, 

additional dust control measures could be implemented.  A compressor will provide 

compressed air for process and instrumentation application.  Fresh water will be distributed to 

the crushing area. 

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-10 

HEAP STACKING 
The crushed ore will be trucked from the crushing facility to the heap leach pad (HLP).  The 

leach pad will be developed in three phases.  The HLP will be able to accommodate up to 40 

Mt. 

 

HEAP LEACHING 
The heap will be irrigated with a diluted cyanide solution recirculated from the ADR plant, via 

a network of piping covering the surface area under leach.  The barren leach solution will be 

pumped from the barren tank at the ADR plant to the area under heap leach.  The cyanide 

concentration will be adjusted and the pH will be controlled so that HCN gas formation is 

inhibited.  The solution will be filtered to remove carbon fines prior to distribution over the area 

under heap leach to minimize emitter plugging.  It will be pumped by means of two centrifugal 

pumps installed in series.  The first pump will cover operation for the first three years of 

operation, which is the end of Phase 1, while the second pump will be required from year four 

and beyond. 

 

The irrigation distribution piping will consist of a 300 mm diameter main header made of carbon 

steel from the barren pumps discharge to the heap perimeter followed by high-density 

polyethylene (HDPE) ending at the ore panels to be irrigated.  Drip emitters will be used to 

provide irrigation.  A typical panel piping arrangement will include a 300 mm diameter HDPE 

header starting from the main header and running for 190 m along the 250 m side of the panel.  

It is proposed to use two lengths of 300 mm diameter HDPE header in rotation for irrigation, 

one in operation and the other one available for installation on the next section to be irrigated.  

Four lateral pipes spaced at every 62.5 m will be branched from the header.  Each lateral pipe 

will include a 150 mm butterfly valve, a pressure gauge, and 75 m of a 150 mm diameter HDPE 

pipe followed by 75 m of a 100 mm diameter HDPE pipe.  Emitter lines will be branched at 

every 500 mm on the pipes and emitters will be spaced at every 762 mm on the emitter lines. 

 

The pregnant leach solution (PLS) will flow by gravity through a network of collection pipes at 

the base of the heap to the PLS pond prior to being pumped to the ADR plant for precious 

metals recovery.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-11 

WATER BALANCE AND SOLUTION MANAGEMENT 
A probabilistic water balance model was developed for the HLP to simulate the performance 

of the facility.  The objectives of the analysis were to evaluate the demand for makeup water 

from external sources and the volume of excess water generated during HLP operation (i.e., 

for use in event pond sizing).  The water balance model was developed using GoldSim 

software.   

 

The water balance model was applied to three different scenarios.  Laboratory testing of the 

sample of post-column leached ore as well as work done by Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) 

indicates a representative Ksat value may be within a range of 0.5 cm/s to 1.0 cm/s.  Factors 

that may result in lowering the effective vertical hydraulic conductivity of the ore heap include 

the following: 1) surface trafficking (compaction) on top of previously placed ore, 2) breakdown 

of ore particles over time, 3) migration of fines particles, or 4) one lift (or a portion of one lift) 

placed with incrementally higher fines content. 

 

CAPITAL COSTS 
All pre-production expenditures and construction capital have been assumed to occur in Years 

-2 and -1 (2015-2016) and Q1 2017, with mining commencing in mid-2016 and, subsequent to 

commissioning, gold production commencing in Q2 2017.  Total initial direct and indirect capital 

costs and pre-production operating costs are estimated to be $220.8M.  This total includes all 

applicable Owner's costs, HLP, ADR, infrastructure, engineering, mining, working capital, and 

project management, with a contingency of 15% upon commencement of construction.  The 

estimates are found in Table 1-4.

OPERATING COSTS 
Operating costs were developed from first principles for processing and general and 

administrative costs.  Manpower lists have been developed for all areas, including 

administrative offices in Ankara.  Power and reagent consumptions have been estimated 

based on test work and engineering work completed to date on the crushing facility, ADR plant, 

and HLP.  Mining costs have been based on discussion with mining contractors in Turkey, with 

additional costs for contractor oversight, grade control, and mine planning estimated by 

Centerra.  Additional stockpile rehandle costs have also been included.  Various royalties have 

been applied to the Project and have been estimated assuming a gold price of $1,250/oz.  

Refining charges have also been included.  Table 1-5 summarizes the operating costs by area.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
The material economic assumptions such as operating and capital cost estimates used for the 

calculations presented in this section are summarized in Tables 1-4 and 1-5.   

 

CASH FLOW FORECAST 
Using a price of gold of $1,250 per ounce, as assumed for the Mineral Reserve estimation 

process, the open pit LOM plan (Table 1-2), the processing schedule (Table 1-3), and the 

capital and operating cost forecasts (Tables 1-4 and 1-5, respectively), an estimate of the after-

tax free cash flow for the Öksüt Project has been made.  As shown in Tables 1-6 and 1-7, the 

total after-tax undiscounted free cash flow is $435.9M whereas the after-tax free cash flow 

discounted at 8% is $242.0M.  The internal rate of return (IRR) of the Project is 42.5% after 

taxes.  The payback period on construction capital and pre-production expenditures is 

expected to be two and half years after production commences. 

 

The after-tax free cash flow includes, among other costs, all pre-production costs, 

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) costs, and permitting costs.  Additional 

exploration work including tasks budgeted for 2016 have not been included in the Project 

financial analysis as it is assumed that any such work would be done to increase the currently 

defined Project resource.  Exploration expenses incurred during 2014 and 2015 have been 

applied to the financial model for the purposes of taxation.

Capital costs include the construction of the power line and deposits related to forestry and 

land pasture fees.  These deposits will be returned to Centerra over the LOM.  In the case of 

the power line, it has been assumed that the cost will be recovered by a series of five equal 

payments, paid yearly, beginning in 2017 and ending in 2021.  The forestry and land pasture 

deposits have been assumed to be refunded at the end of closure and reclamation activities 

in 2025.

TAXATION AND ROYALTIES 
The corporate income tax rate in Turkey is 20%, however, Investment Incentive Certificates 

(IIC) are available to provide reduced corporate tax rates for profits derived from investments 

made in Turkey to promote economic development.  The Öksüt Project economic analysis 

assumes that an IIC will be obtained.   

 

Based on the scope and the amount of the planned investment, it is expected that a Strategic 

IIC will also be granted to the Project.  If the Öksüt Project receives a Strategic IIC, it will be 

eligible for the additional following benefits: 

 Further reduction of corporate income tax rate  

 VAT exemption 

 Customs duty exemption 

 Government support for interest payments on loans which are registered to the 
investment incentive certificate 

 Government support for employer's share of social security premiums 

 VAT refund support 

 

For the economic analysis, only the impact of the corporate income tax rate reductions under 

the IIC and the Strategic IIC has been included.   

 

Gold production from the Project is also subject to three royalties, as follows: 

1. A Turkish Government State royalty levied as a percentage of revenue less certain 
qualifying operating costs.  The percentage is determined on a sliding scale that is 
linked to the price of gold and may be reduced by 50% if the material is further 
processed in a refinery in Turkey (as assumed in the economic analysis).  Based on 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-17 

the assumed gold price of $1,250/oz, an effective royalty rate of 2% was used for the 
economic analysis. 
 

2. A 1% NSR royalty payable to Stratex Gold up to a maximum of $20M; and 
 

3. A sliding scale NSR royalty payable to Teck based on the cumulative ounces produced 
over the LOM.  Centerra has estimated this royalty to be 0.6% of total gold revenues. 

 

The total effective royalty rate used for the economic analysis, at an assumed gold price of 

$1,250/oz, is 3.6%. 

 

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Table 1-8 provides after-tax free cash flow forecasts for the Öksüt Project based on the current 

LOM plan and a gold price of $1,250 per ounce.  The table also shows the sensitivity of the 

Project NPV to gold prices ranging from $1,050 to $1,450 per ounce on $100 increments and 

on discount rates ranging from 0 to 10%.  Sensitivities to four other variables at the base case 

gold price and a discount rate of 8% are also shown on a ±15% basis.

FIGURE 1-1   CASH FLOW SENSITIVITIES 
 

 
 

The LOM NPV8% is most sensitive to changes in the gold grade and process recovery under 

an upside scenario (15% increase) followed by the gold price and then by operating and capital 

costs respectively.  An increase of 15% to the gold grade or process recovery increases the 

Project NPV8% by $83.6M whereas a gold price increase of 15% results in an additional $79.3M 

to the Project NPV8%. 

 

When considering the downside scenario, the Project is most sensitive to the gold price 

followed by gold grade or process recovery and then by operating and capital costs 

respectively.  A 15% reduction in the gold price reduces the Project NPV8% by $85.5M.  

Similarly, a reduction in the gold grade or process recovery of 15% reduces the Project NPV8% 
by $84.2M. 

 

At a gold price of $767 per ounce and an 8% discount rate, the Project is cash flow neutral, 

however, it meets all foreseen capital and operating expenses including cash taxes.  At gold 

prices higher than $767 per ounce, the Project has the potential to generate positive free cash 

flow.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

CONCLUSIONS 
• At June 30, 2015, the Öksüt database contained results of 330 diamond and reverse 

circulation (RC) drill holes for a total of 82,006 m.  Centerra concludes that the data, 
the data density, and the additional information from the Öksüt database are adequate 
to form the basis for a Mineral Resource estimate.  
 

• A site visit to the Öksüt Project reviewed property and deposit geology, exploration and 
drilling methods and results, sampling method and approach, sample and data 
handling, including chain of custody.  A qualified geologist evaluated the compilation of 
quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data from the Öksüt Project and is of the 
opinion that the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures used by OMAS 
and prior companies followed industry-standard procedures and the resulting analytical 
data are acceptable for use in resource estimation.   

 
• Drilling to date has been completed at an average drill hole spacing of 50 m along and 

across strike over known mineralized zones, the majority of which has been classified 
as Measured or Indicated Mineral Resources.  Drilling has not completely defined the 
limits of the mineralization at the Güneytepe Deposit, and the mineralized zones remain 
open along strike to the north.   
 

• Centerra estimates the current Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources at the 
Öksüt Project to be 33.0 Mt at an average grade of 1.2 g/t Au containing 1.3 million 
ounces Au and Inferred Mineral Resources to be 2.4 Mt at an average grade of 0.8 g/t 
Au containing 64,000 ounces Au.   
 

• In order to comply with the CIM Definitions requirement of "reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction", a preliminary Whittle pit shell was used to constrain the 
Mineral Resource estimate using process recovery of 77%, a gold price of $1,450, and 
other assumed pit parameters.  Only blocks located within the pit shell are reported in 
the Mineral Resource estimate. 
 

• The mineralization at the Öksüt Project that is included in this analysis comes from two 
separate deposits to be mined by open pit methods.  This mineralization is amenable 
to conventional open pit, loader/truck mining methods that will be carried out by a 
mining contractor. 
 

• Utilizing the updated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, pit optimization was 
carried out on both the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits, using updated geotechnical 
parameters, updated operating costs, metallurgical recovery estimates, and a gold 
price of $1,250 per ounce.  The resulting pit shells were used as a guide in completing 
engineered pit designs which include ramps suitable for 36 tonne haul trucks consistent 
with other contractor mining operations in Turkey.  This generated an estimated 
Probable Mineral Reserve of 26.1 Mt at 1.4 g/t Au containing 1.2 million ounces of gold 
at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au. 
 



Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-20 

• Test work carried out on representative samples of the deposits indicates that the
Öksüt Project mineralization can be treated with heap leach methods.  The HLP is
designed to process oxide ore from two open pits.

• Metallurgical testing identified an unexpected variability in ore metallurgical properties 
which requires follow-up analysis and may impact the overall recovery estimate.

• The proposed Öksüt process plant design will be based on gold heap leach technology,
which will consist of crushing, stacking, and heap leaching with cyanide solution, gold
adsorption from the pregnant solution onto carbon, carbon elution, and gold smelting.

• Financial analysis of the Öksüt Project has determined that the Project will be
economically viable and profitable.

• The FS is based on the open pit mining of the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits.  The
target ore production rate during the life of the mine is 4.0 Mt per year.

• Using a price of gold of $1,250 per ounce, the total after-tax undiscounted free cash
flow is $435.9M, whereas the after-tax free cash flow discounted at 8% is $242.0M.
The internal rate of return of the Project is 42.5% after taxes and payback is in 2.5
years.

• Centerra concludes that the FS demonstrates the viability of the Öksüt Project as
proposed, and that further development is warranted.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
The key recommendation is to proceed with the development of the Öksüt Project in 2015 with 

the target of achieving initial gold production in Q2 2017. 

Additional recommendations include: 

• Implement a database management system that is capable of supporting production
sampling.

• Complete an independent audit of the assay database after implementation of a
database management system.

• Perform additional density measurements within barren material outside of the existing
mineralization.

• Survey the remaining five GPS surveyed holes with differential global positioning
system (DGPS).

• Create an alteration model using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data as the basis
for a geo-metallurgical recovery model.



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 1-21 

• Evaluate the impact of using shorter composite lengths for grade estimation. 
 

• Perform a contact plot analysis to assess the need for soft, semi-soft, or hard estimation 
boundaries for high grade and low grade material. 
 

• Based on the completed geo-metallurgy recovery model, identify any gaps in the 
samples tested to date.  Using either available samples or samples from new drill holes, 
complete additional leach tests. 
 

• Conduct additional testing utilizing an updated alteration model to provide guidance for 
sample selection in order to manage the unexpected variability in ore metallurgical 
properties identified in the KCA Phase 3 testing program. 
 

• Complete a detailed leach plan and schedule utilizing the updated geo-metallurgy 
recovery model. 
 

• Complete additional geotechnical drilling for final HLP, waste dump, and other surface 
infrastructure designs, to provide enough data for detailed engineering. 
 

• As mining begins, data from pit wall mapping should be incorporated into the 
geotechnical model and pit designs adjusted accordingly. 
 

• Confirm, or re-visit, the hydrogeological assumptions after mining commences.  If there 
are material changes to the water table assumptions, the slope stability analyses 
should be updated. 
 

• Sensitivities to mining losses and dilution should be quantified.  As mining begins, these 
assumptions should be monitored and adjusted, if necessary. 
 

• Due to the climate characteristics at the Project site, the ponds are expected to be 
empty throughout most of the year, with the majority of inflows concentrated in the 
months of March and April.  Assessment of options for protecting the geomembrane 
from exposure to natural environment would need to be considered during detailed 
design (e.g., covering the geomembrane with a protective layer of sand or gravel).

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 2-1 

2 INTRODUCTION 
Centerra Gold Inc. (Centerra) has prepared a Technical Report on the Öksüt Gold Project (the 

Öksüt Project or the Project), located in the Kayseri province of south-central Turkey.  The 

Technical Report supports the disclosure of the Project's Mineral Resource and Mineral 

Reserve estimates at June 30, 2015 and has been prepared in accordance with National 

Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  All dollar amounts 

in this Technical Report are stated in United States dollars (US$) unless otherwise noted. 

 

Centerra is a North American-based gold mining and exploration company engaged in the 

operation, exploration, development, and acquisition of gold properties in Asia, Canada, and 

other markets worldwide.  Centerra is a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock 

Exchange.   

 

In August 2009, Centerra formed a joint venture with Stratex International Plc (Stratex), a 

publicly listed company on the London-based Alternative Investment Market (AIM), for the 

Öksüt Project through its now wholly-owned Turkish subsidiary, Öksüt Madencilik Sanayi ve 

Ticaret A.Ş. (OMAS).  In October 2012, Centerra increased its interest in the joint venture to 

70% after completing total expenditures of $6M on exploration.  In January 2013, Centerra 

purchased Stratex's remaining 30% interest for a cash payment of $20M and a 1% net smelter 

return (NSR) royalty capped at $20M.  In addition to the royalty payable to Stratex's wholly-

owned subsidiary Stratex Gold AG (Stratex Gold), the Project is also subject to a sliding scale 

NSR royalty in favour of Teck Resources Limited (Teck) as well as a sliding scale royalty in 

favour of the Turkish Government.  Closing of the purchase was also conditional on the 

granting of two Operation Licences by the Turkish authorities, which occurred on January 16, 

2013.  Centerra now owns 100% of the Project. 

 

The Öksüt Project was first discovered in 2007 when geological staff of Stratex identified gold 

mineralization in reconnaissance rock chip sampling from outcrops located on what is now 

referred to as the Güneytepe Deposit area.  Prior to this, there is no record of any modern 

exploration for gold being conducted on the property.  In 2008, Stratex followed up these 

surface sampling results with an initial 13-hole diamond drilling program located within the 

Güneytepe Deposit area.   



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 2-2 

Following the formation of the joint venture, several additional drilling programs were 

completed on the property resulting in the first Centerra publication of a Mineral Resource 

estimate on the Project in February 2013 (effective at December 31, 2012) subsequently 

followed by a revised Mineral Resource estimate published in February 2014 (effective at 

December 31, 2013).  On February 19, 2014, Centerra announced the results of a Preliminary 

Economic Assessment (PEA).  An updated Mineral Resource estimate was published in 

February 2015 (effective at December 31, 2014).  On July 28, 2015, Centerra announced the 

results of a Feasibility Study (FS) on the Öksüt Project.   

 

The Öksüt Project is planned as a conventional truck and shovel open pit mine.  A total of 

approximately 26.1 Mt of ore at a grade of 1.4 g/t Au, containing a total of approximately 1.2 

million ounces of gold, is planned to be mined and processed by heap leach method over a 

mine life of eight years from two open pits, the Keltepe and the smaller Güneytepe pit.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 4-1 

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Öksüt Project is located in south-central Turkey, 295 km to the southeast of the capital 

city of Ankara and 48 km directly south of the city of Kayseri which has a population of 1.1 

million.  The nearest administrative centre is at Develi (population 64,000) located 

approximately 10 km north of the Project.  Ankara and Kayseri have international airports and 

are serviced by international and domestic airlines.  The Project's co-ordinates are 715000-

722100 Easting and 4236500-4249300 Northing (UTM ED 50 zone 36) (Figures 4-1 and 4-2). 

The Project is located in the Develi Mountains on a north-south trending topographic high.  The 

topographic relief comprises steep-sided V-shaped valleys, and locally, cliffs tens of metres 

high, capped by flat-lying mesas and plateaus.  The Project site is located at an elevation of 

approximately 1,800 m.  The valleys are extensively farmed, with the local population living in 

a number of small villages including the villages of Öksüt and Zile. 

LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
Mining rights and minerals are exclusively owned by the state.  The state delegates rights to 

explore and operate to Turkish individuals or legal entities through set period licences in return 

for royalty payments.  Local and foreign investors can acquire the same mining rights, 

however, foreign investors need to establish a Turkish company to do so, which can be 100% 

foreign owned. 

Mining licensing is regulated by the General Directorate of Mining Affairs (MIGEM), a unit of 

the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.  Other institutions of importance are central 

government ministries, the provincial administration, and local government institutions.   

Mining is primarily governed by the 1985 Mining Law no. 3213, which was most recently 

amended in June 2010.  This latest amendment aims to provide a more investment friendly 

environment, particularly for exploration projects, as well as bringing aspects such as 

environmental protection and health and safety more in line with international practice.

MINERAL TENURE 
The Öksüt Project land position consists of two contiguous Operation Licences (numbers IR 

82468 and 82469 – the Licences) with a total area of 3,995.81 ha (Table 4-1 and Figure 4-3).  

Mineral rights under these licences have been granted to OMAS.  According to the Mining 

Law, OMAS has the right to explore and develop any Mineral Resources contained within the 

Operation Licences, provided fees and taxes are paid in order to keep the licences in good 

standing. The Licences were issued on January 16, 2013 and are currently set to expire on 

January 15, 2023.

SURFACE RIGHTS 

LAND OWNERSHIP 
As noted above, OMAS currently holds two Operation Licences relating to the Project.  Within 

the areas covered by the Operation Licences, a fence line zone has been demarcated for the 

purposes of permitting under the EIA Report (EIA Fence Line Zone).  Once OMAS has 

obtained approval of the EIA Report, it will be allowed to apply for permits to conduct 

development, operations, and other activities within the EIA Fence Line Zone.   

 

There are three different types of land located within boundaries of the EIA Fence Line Zone: 

forestry, pasture, and private.  Both forestry land and pasture land are considered government 

lands.  According to the Mining Law and Regulations, land title transfers of government lands 

may be sought following approval of the EIA Report.  There is only one parcel of private land 

covering approximately 80,000 m2 which is in the middle of the EIA Fence Line Zone (Figure 

4-4).  No roads or other facilities at the Project are expected to impact these private lands.  

Negotiations with owners of private land have begun and are continuing. 

 

In addition, to lands contained within the EIA Fence Line Zone, acquisition of additional lands 

has been considered for the purposes of obtaining water, power and road access to the 

Project.  Based on the results of fresh water studies completed by Golder Associates Ltd. 

(Golder) between November 2014 and February 2015, two locations (9,200 m2 and 5,000 m2), 

which are private land, were determined to be suitable water resources for mine usage.  OMAS 

has purchased these lands and the water wells have been permitted.   

 

Following a preliminary review of the ownership of lands underlying proposed access roads 

for the Project, it was determined that there are pasture, government, and private lands on the 

route.  OMAS is currently in the process of negotiating with local private landowners for the 
acquisition or use of such private lands. 

 

Power line related negotiations have been conducted with the Turkish Electricity Transmission 

Company (TEIAŞ) and according to applicable laws, the acquisition of lands and other rights 

on the power line route will be carried out by TEIAŞ.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
Currently, travel to the Project is via the paved dual lane road from Kayseri southwards to 

Develi over the eastern flank of Mt Erciyes.  From there, the road connects Develi to the town 

of Gömedi, 33 km to the south-southwest, and then via the minor access roads to the villages 

of Zile.  The Project site is accessed via a narrow agricultural dirt road from the village of Zile 

and as a result, access to the site in winter is presently limited. 

CLIMATE 
The climate is continental with cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers with cool nights 

due to the area's high elevation.  According to the 48 year temperature measurements made 

by the Develi Meteorological Station, the annual mean temperature in the region is 11˚C. 

Temperature ranges from 10˚C to 29˚C in summer and -5˚C to 7˚C in winter.  The mean 

temperature is highest at 22.9˚C in July and lowest at -1˚C in January.  The annual average 

total amount of precipitation is approximately 355 mm, generally falling as mixed rain and snow 

in winter and as rain during spring.  The prevailing wind direction in the region is north-

northeast.  The operations of the Project are expected to occur throughout the year. 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The nearest administrative centre is at Develi (population 64,000) located approximately 10 

km north of the Project. 

The Develi area is well-serviced with electrical power lines.  The Project is expected to be 

supplied from a substation 28 km away, near the town of Sendrimeke.  The proposed all 

weather access to the Project is from EpÒ«e.  Water for the Project will be supplied from two 

wells located just south of the village of EpÒ«e.  These wells have been fully tested, and the 

permits and land rights are now in hand.  Preliminary reviews of the region suggest that an 



Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 5-2 

abundant level of mining support services and skilled to semi-skilled labour available to support 

a potential mining operation.   

INFRASTRUCTURE 
There is currently no existing infrastructure on the lands covered by the Operation Licences 

due to the fact that the appropriate permits for such development will only be applied for 

following final approval of the EIA Report (see Section 20).   

For a description of potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas and potential 

processing plant areas, please refer to Figure 16-7. 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The Project is located in the Develi Mountains on a north-south trending topographic high.  The 

topographic relief comprises steep-sided V-shaped valleys, and locally, cliffs tens of metres 

high, capped by flat-lying mesas and plateaus.  The Project site is located at an elevation of 

approximately 1,800 m.  Vegetation at higher elevations is predominantly scrub oak, small 

shrubs, and grasses.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 6-1 

6 HISTORY 
The Öksüt Gold Project was discovered by Stratex in early 2007.  Reconnaissance rock chip 

sampling returned up to 0.113 g/t Au from silica ledges within altered andesitic volcanic rocks 

at what is now the Güneytepe Deposit.  In late 2007, Stratex made applications for tenements 

to cover the property and obtained a total of nine contiguous exploration licences covering an 

area of 111.6 km2. 

In 2007 and 2008, Stratex carried out geological mapping, rock chip and channel sampling, 

soil sampling, a topographical survey, and acquired Quickbird high-resolution satellite imagery 

for an area of 5.0 km by 4.5 km over the Project.  Prior to this, there is no record of any modern 

exploration for gold conducted on the property.  More specific information relating to historical 

exploration is provided in Section 9 of this Technical Report. 

In 2009, Stratex and Teck agreed that Teck would relinquish its rights under a 2004 strategic 

alliance agreement to acquire interests in projects owned by Stratex.  In exchange, Teck 

received shares of Stratex and a sliding scale royalty on, among others, the Öksüt Project as 

described above in Section 4.  Centerra and Stratex subsequently formed a joint venture in 

2009, to explore the Project.  Centerra earned an initial 50% equity in the Project by advancing 

$3M to the joint venture through October 2011 and acquired an additional 20% interest in the 

Project in October of 2012 with an additional contribution of $3M, which brought its equity 

interest to 70%.  In January 2013, Centerra purchased Stratex's remaining 30% to own 100% 

of the Öksüt Gold Project in exchange for a cash payment of $20M and a 1% NSR royalty up 

to a maximum of $20M. 

Stratex carried out three historical Mineral Resource estimates for the Project.  The most 

recent estimate, prepared in 2012 to the JORC Code, includes a total of 1,047,872 ounces of 

gold in the Ortaçam North (now Keltepe) and Ortaçam (now Güneytepe) zones at a cut-off 

grade of 0.2 g/t Au.  This historical Mineral Resource estimate is relevant, however, it has been 

superseded by the current Mineral Resource estimate in Section 14.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
GEOTECTONIC AND REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
The Öksüt Project is a high-sulphidation epithermal gold system located in Central Anatolia, 

Turkey.  It lies within part of the Neogene-Quaternary Central Anatolian Volcanic Province 

(CAVP) which is part of the highly mineralized Tethyan Metallogenic Belt (TMB), a continuous 

belt of Mesozoic and Cenozoic deformation that extends from Spain to Southeast Asia. 

The Project is hosted within the Develidağ Volcanic Complex (DVC) of late Miocene age, which 

is one of the numerous stratovolcanoes situated along the Central Anatolian Fault Zone 

(CAFZ).  The DVC is surrounded by pre-Miocene (probably Paleozoic) basement rocks of the 

Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC) and also Quaternary volcanics and sediments. 

The CACC rocks and the Neogene-Quaternary volcanics in Central Anatolia are considered 

to be segments of the TMB formed due to the convergence between the Afro-Arabian and 

Eurasian Plates, i.e., as a result of the closure of the Tethyan Ocean during the Alpine-

Himalayan orogeny in the Late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary. 

The collision between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian Plates accreted many micro-continental 

blocks.  This prolonged collision and the consequent subduction and accretion resulted in the 

formation of three major tectonic units separated by suture zones in Turkey: the Pontide 

Orogenic Belt to the north, the Anatolide-Tauride Platform in the middle, and the Arabian 

Platform in the southeast (Ketin, 1966).  The Pontides are separated by the Ä°zmir-Ankara-

Erzincan Suture Zone from the Anatolide-Tauride Platform.  The CACC is regarded either as 

the northern part of the Anatolide-Tauride Platform or as a distinct terrane, bounded by the 

Inner Tauride Suture Zone.  The Arabian Platform is separated by the Bitlis-Zagros Suture 

Zone from the Anatolide-Tauride Tectonic Unit (Figure 7-1).

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-3 

After the closure of the northern branch of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean along the Ä°zmir-Ankara-

Erzincan Suture Zone, the northward subduction of the Afro-Arabian Plate below the Eurasian 

Plate began in the Early-Middle Miocene to the south of Cyprus.  This subduction zone is 

considered to have triggered the formation of extensive calc-alkaline Neogene volcanism 

throughout Anatolia and including the CAVP.  Meanwhile, the southern branch of the Neo-

Tethyan Ocean, extending from southeastern Turkey to Cyprus, continued its evolution 

through the late Middle Miocene and then closed entirely during continent-continent collision 

along the Bitlis-Zagros Suture Zone.  Such suturing between the Arabian and Eurasian Plates 

was followed by continued convergence in eastern Turkey until the Early Pliocene.  Continuing 

northward movement of the Arabian Plate relative to the African Plate resulted in the tectonic 

escape of the Anatolian Plate to the west along the East Anatolian Fault (EAFZ) and North 

Anatolian Fault Zones (NATFZ) during the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene (Bozkurt, 2001).  This 

episode is referred to as a neotectonic period in which a new compressional-extensional 

regime commenced in Turkey. 

During this neotectonic period, Central Anatolia underwent complex deformation characterized 

by the development of intra-continental transtensional fault systems and the formation of 

tectonic depressions and basins.  During this time, many faults and intra-continental basins in 

this region were either newly formed or were reactivated.   

The NE-SW trending CAFZ has been the major structure shaping Central Anatolia's 

tectonic/geologic setting since the Late Miocene.  The CAFZ is a left-lateral transcurrent fault 

system with about 60 km of offset along its strike.  In its central part it is characterized by 

transtensional depressions formed by left stepping and southward bending of the fault zone. 

The Sultansazlığı pull-apart basin is one of these and has been active since the Late Pliocene. 

With its rhomboidal shape, it displays characteristic morphologic features including steep and 

stepped margins, large alluvial and colluvial fans, and hosts a large stratovolcano of 

Quaternary age, Erciyes Mountain, located 30 km to the north of Öksüt.   

While the CAFZ and its basins were evolving, they were reshaping the development of the 

CAVP in this part of Central Anatolia.  In this region, the CAVP developed within a system of 

successive tectono-volcanic extensional depressions starting in Middle-Late Miocene.  It 

extends as a belt about 300 km long in a NE-SW direction.  It is suggested that the CAVP in 



Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-4 

this area evolved in three major periods (Pasquare et al., 1988).  The first period occurred in 

the Middle-Late Miocene and is represented by the activity of effusive centres as well as of 

endogenous domes of andesitic composition as observed at Öksüt.  The second period 

includes deposition of andesitic-basaltic lava and pyroclastics during the Late Miocene-

Pliocene.  The last period is recorded by the growth of large andesitic-basaltic stratovolcanoes 

such as the Erciyes and Hasandağ composite volcanoes. 

REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY AND DEPOSIT EVOLUTION 
The Öksüt Project lies on the eastern flank of the Sultansazlığı Basin within the eroded 

stratovolcano of the DVC that was controlled and truncated by segments of the CAFZ.  The 

eroded DVC is hosted within the Paleozoic metamorphic basement, which was uplifted along 

the basin shoulders during extension (Figure 7-2).  The DVC is composed of Miocene basaltic-

andesitic volcanic domes, pyroclastics (lithic tuff and volcanic breccia), and lava flows.  Flow-

banded Pliocene andesite overlies these sequences to the north and east.  The majority of the 

eroded volcano is covered by the licences of the Öksüt Project (Figure 7-3). 

Although there has been no radiometric dating done on the DVC, stratigraphic correlation with 

similar andesitic to basaltic rocks in the region suggests that the andesitic rocks at the core of 

the eroded caldera are the oldest volcanic rocks.  K/Ar age dating of similar andesitic rocks 

within the CAVP (Keçikalesi Volcanics) near Niğde, approximately 120 km to the WSW of 

Öksüt, are dated at 13 million years (Besang et al., 1977).  Hence, the andesitic volcanics at 

the Öksüt Project are considered to have a similar age, i.e., Middle Miocene.

Middle Miocene-aged andesitic volcanics outcrop at the core of the DVC.  These are 

stratigraphically overlain by Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene flow-textured andesitic-basaltic 

volcanics intercalated with pyroclastic units.  The overlying andesitic-basaltic lavas and 

pyroclastics dip away from the core at 10° to 30°, forming a prominent cliff up to 300 m high 

from the central area.  To the east of the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits, andesitic-basaltic 

lavas dip gently to the east and cap the older rocks at an altitude of 2,074 m. 

The overlying Late Miocene-Early Pliocene units transition upwards into the Pliocene 

pyroclastics and undifferentiated volcanics to the north and east of the Öksüt Project.  To the 

west, the DVC is covered by Pliocene to Holocene volcanics and Quaternary alluvial deposits 

of the Sultansazlığı Basin. 

Trace element plots of geochemical analyses indicate a calc-alkaline origin for the andesitic 

rocks at Öksüt (after Cabanis and Lecolle, 1989).  However, previous geochemical studies on 

fresh Late Miocene-Early Pliocene basaltic rocks of the DVC (Kürkcüoğlu, 2010) indicates a 

mainly tholeiitic origin derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle source.  This suggests 

partial melting of a subducting plate which has caused emplacement of andesitic domes in the 

Late Miocene.  The reactivation of the CAFZ and the formation of extensional basins occurred 

synchronously with the second phase of volcanism that followed the earlier phase in the Late 

Miocene-Early Pliocene.  Whether gold was introduced into the system during the 

emplacement of the andesitic domes or during the latter volcanism is unclear.  However, 

supergene gold enrichment may have occurred during the latter phase when fast uplifting-

erosion and deep weathering were occurring along the eastern flank of the Sultansazlığı Basin. 

The Miocene to Pliocene units in the vicinity of the Öksüt Project are displaced or distorted by 

oblique faults that have dominant normal and strike-slip movements.  The amount of net-slip 

or displacement along these faults is difficult to determine as they truncate each other, 

suggesting repetitive cycles of faulting and/or reactivation.  These faults are mainly oriented 

NE-SW and NW-SE. Structural observations by OMAS staff suggest that NE-SW faults have 

a dominant strike-slip movement whereas NW-SE faults have a dominant normal 

displacement.  These faults are interpreted to have played an important role in gold deposition 

as they caused further brecciation and thereby provided multiple pathways for hydrothermal 

fluids. 



Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-8 

Although the andesitic rocks that host the gold mineralization at Öksüt are generally oxidized, 

brecciated and highly altered, original textures, including porphyritic characteristics and 

layering, are still preserved in places where weaker alteration or relict breccia clasts are 

present.  In relatively fresh or weakly altered rocks outside of the mineralized breccia bodies, 

the andesite is porphyritic with phenocrysts of plagioclase feldspar, and rare, altered biotite 

and pyroxene, within a fine, quartz-plagioclase feldspar-ilmenite groundmass.  Apart from 

these minerals, in most places disseminated fine grained pyrite is also present together with 

magnetite.  The gold mineralization is hosted by a polymictic breccia, which is interpreted to 

fill a sub-volcanic vent/diatreme rather than being a sub-aerial volcaniclastic sequence, and to 

be either phreatomagmatic or phreatic in origin. 

PROPERTY GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Öksüt mineralization is associated with a high-sulphidation epithermal, disseminated gold 

system hosted within the mid-Miocene age andesitic volcanic dome complex of the DVC.  Gold 

mineralization is closely associated with massive and vuggy silicic alteration and advanced 

argillic alteration, occurring within large areas of argillic alteration.  Silicification occurs in 

association with multiple phases of hydrothermal breccias with silica/limonite cement and 

silica/alunite cement, quartz-alunite, quartz-kaolinite, patchy silica and opal/chalcedony, and 

displays local zonation both vertically and laterally.  Gold mineralization is believed to occur as 

finely disseminated particles in the oxide zone and in association with pyrite, chalcocite, 

covellite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, and enargite in the sulphide zone (Lashko, 2013). 

Nine mineralized zones have been identified at Öksüt (Figure 7-3).  Mineral Resources have 

been estimated for two of these, Keltepe and Güneytepe (Figure 7-4).

KELTEPE DEPOSIT 
GEOLOGY AND STRUCTURE 
The Keltepe Deposit is elongated NNW-SSE and is approximately 600 m long and 350 m wide 

with a minimum known vertical extent of 450 m.  Two principal rock types are present: a 

texturally diverse variety of polymictic breccias and a texturally uniform porphyritic andesite 

(Sillitoe, 2012).  The principal host rocks to the gold mineralization are multiple phases of 

polymictic hydrothermal breccia.  The breccia clasts display marked size variability, ranging 

from ~10 cm through a typical 1-2 cm to highly comminuted rock flour.  Locally, monomictic 

blocks, as large as 25 m, occur within the breccia.  The clasts are typically angular to sub-

rounded in form and set in a highly altered, fine-grained, clastic matrix.  The alteration is too 

intense and pervasive to determine if a tuff component is present in the matrix.  In places, the 

medium- to fine-grained breccia is laminated and shows size sorting. 

 

The multiple breccia varieties are erratically distributed and not readily correlated, at least over 

distances in the order of 100 m.  The breccias contain clasts that were either altered or 

unaltered at the time of incorporation.  The latter include andesitic volcanic rocks and 

uncommon siltstone, locally finely bedded.  The altered clasts include pervasively silicified 

rock, vuggy residual quartz, and quartz-alunite.  These siliceous lithologies, which constitute 

approximately 20% of the breccias, have a variety of white to grey shades and textures that 

confirm appreciable admixture during the brecciation process (Sillitoe, 2012). 

 

Among the multiple phases of breccias, four main types have been identified based on their 

cement type (Kurtuluş, 2012).  These breccias are: alunite breccia set in alunite-limonite 

cement; quartz-kaolinite ± alunite breccia set in a quartz-kaolinite ± alunite cement; silica-

hematite breccia set in a fine-grained silica-hematite-limonite matrix; and massive silica 

breccia set in massive silica-pyrite cement.   

 

Alunite breccia is composed of heterolithic clasts set in quartz-alunite-limonite cement (Figure 

7-5).  Clasts are massive, angular to sub-angular, and their sizes range from a few millimetres 

up to 10 cm. Alunite breccia is clast-supported to locally matrix-supported.  It forms zones from 

a few centimetres up to 30 m to 40 m in width.  Alunite breccia generally transitions laterally 

and vertically into quartz-kaolinite ± alunite breccia.

Massive silica breccia is composed of monomictic clasts set in a massive silica-limonite-pyrite 

matrix (Figure 7-5).  Clasts are massive silica, angular and their size ranges from few 

millimetres up to 3 cm.  Both clasts and matrix may include disseminated pyrite ± chalcocite. 

Massive silica breccia texture resembles crackle breccia.  It is predominantly matrix supported 

and forms zones from 50 cm to tens of metres in width.

The silica-hematite-limonite breccia is composed of polymictic clasts set in fine-grained

cm.  The silica-hematite-limonite breccia is predominantly clast supported and forms zones 

from 50 cm to 10 m in width.

FIGURE 7-6   SILICA-HEMATITE-LIMONITE BRECCIA AND QUARTZ-KAOLINITE 
± ALUNITE BRECCIA 

 

The quartz-kaolinite ± alunite breccia is composed of heterolithic clasts with quartz-kaolinite ± 

alunite cement (Figure 7-6).  Clasts are quartz-kaolinite, quartz-alunite, and massive silica 

altered, sub-angular to sub-rounded, and their size ranges from 2 cm to 20 cm.  The quartz-

kaolinite ± alunite breccia is generally coarse grained and predominantly matrix supported.  

Zones of quartz-kaolinite ± alunite breccia range from a few centimetres up to 15 m in width. 

 

Andesite porphyry, considered to be part of an andesitic flow/dome complex, surrounds and 

partially overlies the breccias, particularly along the eastern and northern margins of the 

Keltepe Deposit.  The andesite is altered, but most of it more weakly so than the breccias.  The 

overlying andesite is up to ~100 m thick and has a flat to shallowly inclined base.  The andesite 

is porphyritic with phenocrysts of plagioclase feldspar, and rare, altered biotite and pyroxene, 

within a fine, quartz-plagioclase feldspar-pyrite-ilmenite groundmass.  

 

Texturally identical porphyritic andesite also occurs very locally at depth within the breccia, 

where it is tentatively interpreted as being blocks of lesser altered material amongst the breccia 

bodies.  A few narrow andesite dykes have been logged at depth at Keltepe and these contain 

xenoliths of silicified rock, which supports their emplacement during the mineralization event. 

 

Gold mineralization at the Keltepe Deposit is interpreted to be controlled by NW-SE trending 

dip-slip faults and NE-SW trending dominantly strike-slip faults (Figure 7-4).  The latter fault 

set seems to overprint the NW-SE faults.  However, due to reactivation, NW-SE faults are also 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-13 

seen to offset the younger NE-SW faults in places.  The outcrop expressions of the faults (or 

fault zones) may be seen by displacements and/or offsets at the surface and fault 

geomorphology.  The attitude and extent of faults were traced and checked with the aid of drill 

hole data, ground magnetic geophysical data and, occasionally, with 2D induced polarization 

(IP)/resistivity geophysical data cross-sections.  The contrast across significant fault zones 

may be clearly seen on 2D IP/resistivity cross-sections.  In core samples, faults and/or fault 

zones are identified by highly broken intercepts, core loss, fault gouge, and fault breccia.  Fault 

breccias may be differentiated from hydrothermal breccias by textural differences.  Fault 

breccia clasts overprint hydrothermal breccias and they have clean angular boundaries, 

especially when associated with the younger NE-SW trending fault zones. 

 

Gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids are interpreted to have used vertical and/or sub-vertical 

structures as feeder zones and to have also moved laterally within favourable lithologies before 

precipitating gold mineralization.  Given the multiply brecciated and highly fractured nature of 

the host rocks, hydrothermal fluid pressures are thought to have been very high.   

 

During subsequent rapid uplift/exhumation and erosion, vertical stress would have been 

relieved and this is interpreted to have resulted in the formation of horizontal or shallow-dipping 

(10o-20o) sheeted joints, which are common within some parts of the deposit. 

 
ALTERATION 
Four hydrothermal alteration types are recognized from Keltepe: massive silicification and 

associated vuggy residual quartz, quartz-alunite, quartz-alunite-kaolinite, and quartz-kaolinite.  

The latter includes patches of hypogene smectite-chlorite alteration as well as supergene 

kaolinization.  

 

Massive silica and lesser vuggy silicification dominate the core of the mineralization at the 

Keltepe Deposit.  It comprises a porous body of silicified breccia admixed with vuggy residual 

quartz, the product of hydrothermal leaching of all original rock constituents except silica under 

low-pH conditions.  The porosity is contributed to by hypogene cavities that characterize the 

vuggy quartz and open space produced by the nearly complete supergene oxidation and 

removal of sulphide minerals, chiefly pyrite, and associated native sulphur. A ghost-like breccia 

texture is generally still visible because of the prominence of the silicified and vuggy quartz 

clasts that were incorporated in the breccia prior to the pervasive silicification and vuggy quartz 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-14 

development.  Narrow, massive, silicified, and hematite-stained breccia zones have been 

observed at depth and these are interpreted as being hydrothermal feeder zones to the 

shallower siliceous bodies.  

 

Alteration transitions outwards from the siliceous core into pervasive quartz-alunite altered 

breccia.  Quartz-alunite alteration also affects the basal parts of the overlying andesite.  The 

quartz-alunite alteration, like the siliceous core, is highly porous, reflecting both its original 

granular texture and the nearly complete supergene removal of disseminated sulphide 

minerals, mainly pyrite.  Sugary-textured, almost sandy, quartz-alunite alteration also occurs 

sporadically throughout the deposit. 

 

The quartz-alunite-kaolinite alteration defines a highly irregular but coherent zone around the 

known breccia bodies, where it grades both upwards and downwards to quartz-alunite 

alteration.  The resulting rock has a distinct appearance, typically showing patchy alternations 

of quartz-alunite and quartz-kaolinite besides admixtures of quartz, alunite, and kaolinite.  

 

The quartz-kaolinite alteration is largely confined to the porphyritic andesite, mainly to the near-

surface, overlying body and around the margins of the breccia bodies.  Further outwards, the 

porphyritic andesitic rocks that surround and overlie the mineralized breccia bodies are only 

weakly altered to a low-temperature smectite-chlorite assemblage and, in places, may be little 

altered and retain fresh hornblende phenocrysts.  Supergene kaolinization, a product of the 

acidic solutions generated by pyrite oxidation, also affects the oxidized parts of the andesite.  

The quartz-kaolinite-altered andesite is a much less permeable rock than the rest of the altered 

rock at Keltepe.  Hence, the 3% to 4% of fine-grained, disseminated pyrite contained in this 

andesite has been only partially oxidized.  

 
OXIDATION 
The Keltepe Deposit is strongly oxidized to a maximum known depth of up to 400 m below 

surface.  This unusually deep oxidation is attributed to the porous and permeable nature of the 

siliceous and quartz-alunite altered breccias and to the presence of a deep groundwater table 

controlled by the NNW-SSE and NE-SW trending fault zones that drain outwards from the 

topographic high beneath which the Keltepe Deposit is located.  Oxidation is marked by 

extensive hematitic and jarositic limonite and also occasionally by goethite.  The degree of 

oxidation is higher along or near to the fault zones within the mineralized system.  These faults 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-15 

are believed to have acted as conduits for gold-bearing hydrothermal solutions.  Away from 

the faults, gold grades tend to be lower and where they meet another conduit and/or feeder 

structure they improve again.  

 

Oxidation is not uniformly complete throughout the deposit, with patches of less oxidized or 

unoxidized rock enclosed by fully oxidized rocks. 

 
MINERALIZATION 
Oxide gold mineralization occurs from the surface (~1,800 m RL) to 250 m to 300 m below 

surface (~1,500 m RL to 1,600 m RL).  Mineralization lies in an NW-SE orientation along strike 

and extends for approximately 950 m.  Its width varies along strike, but in the centre of 

mineralization the width is about 370 m.  Gold mineralization is believed to occur as finely 

disseminated particles as it was not identified during scanning electron microscope (SEM) 

analysis (Lashko, 2013).  This has been confirmed by a gold deportment study that shows that 

the major gold mineral identified at Keltepe is native gold with an average fineness of 6.9 μm 

(SGS Canada Inc., 2013, Figure 7-7).  This study also indicates that the host minerals for the 

gold in the sample studied are mainly quartz and other silicates and iron oxide, with minor (2% 

to 10%) rutile-silicate complexes and trace associations with pyrite.

Source: SGS Canada Inc., 2013, Figure 12, page 19. Au = native gold. Gold associated minerals 
include silicates (Silc), and Fe-oxide (Fe) 

 

Rare "perched" zones of oxide copper mineralization, almost entirely composed of malachite 

coatings and impregnations in the breccia bodies, occur sporadically within the lower parts of 

the oxide zone, generally at depths of >200 m.  The malachite zones are usually only one 

metre to two metres in thickness but may attain a thickness of >20 m (e.g., hole ODD0045). 

Copper grades in these zones, which are suspected to reflect former levels of chalcocite 

enrichment, may often be >1%.  

 

Chalcocite, covellite, pyrite, and native sulphur are commonly seen in the supergene 

enrichment zone at depth at the Keltepe Deposit and significant copper ± gold intercepts have 

been returned from the redox boundary interface (e.g., 38 m grading 3.57% Cu and 0.21 g/t 

Au in hole ODD0146A).  The redox boundary generally occurs some 50 m to 100 m below the 

base of the oxide gold mineralization, which occurs at a depth of approximately 250 m to 300 

m.  SEM analysis of sulphide breccia clasts has identified ubiquitous pyrite, enargite as isolated 

crystals and as inclusions in pyrite and/or rutile, galena as inclusions within pyrite, and tin

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-17 

oxides within vugs in the siliceous clasts (Lashko, 2013).  Tennantite-tetrahedrite was also 

identified in a single sample.  The hypogene source of the copper is suspected to be enargite 

that has been leached from the upper parts of the system. 

 
SYNOPSIS 
The Keltepe Deposit is interpreted as being hosted in a large phreatomagmatic vent with 

subsequent emplacement of one or more andesite domes at or near its top.  The breccia that 

hosts the bulk of the gold mineralization could be a diatreme given the texturally destructive 

nature of the alteration and the likelihood that basement carbonate rocks would not survive in 

the acidic high-sulphidation system.  

 

Emplacement of the diatreme breccia that hosts the Keltepe Deposit and the porphyritic 

andesite appear to have overlapped in both space and time (Sillitoe, 2012).  The reconstructed 

form of the andesite suggests that it is part of a small exogenous volcanic dome(s), the basal 

parts of which have been preserved above the eastern and northern parts of the mineralized 

breccia, but with the remainder having been eroded.  A thickness of ~100 m, or perhaps even 

more, seems likely to have been lost to erosion.  Multiple episodes of brecciation clearly took 

place prior to andesite emplacement, but at least minor brecciation of the same type also 

followed andesite consolidation.  

 

The main alteration event linked to the gold mineralization either accompanied or immediately 

followed andesite emplacement, as shown by the quartz-alunite alteration of the margins of 

the porphyritic andesite.  The generally weaker, quartz-kaolinite alteration of the andesite 

reflects its inter-mineral timing and/or lower intrinsic permeability.  The andesite that overlies 

the breccia bodies along their eastern margin may even have acted as a seal during the gold 

mineralization event.  

 

Gold was preferentially precipitated in the siliceous ledges and their immediate quartz-alunite 

haloes, and was fed by at least one, and probably several, steeply dipping, NW-SE trending, 

structures represented by massive silicification.  The restricted 200 m to 250 m vertical extent 

of ledge development and associated gold mineralization likely reflects a key palaeo-

temperature interval that existed beneath the overlying andesite and was controlled by 

approach to the palaeosurface (Sillitoe, 2012).  

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-18 

The Keltepe breccia is considered to be inter-mineral in timing because of the ubiquity of the 

siliceous clasts.  These clasts are presumed to have been derived from pre-existing silicified 

vuggy quartz and quartz-alunite ledges, like those at the nearby Güneytepe Deposit, and, 

hence, may be gold-bearing.  Thus, a proportion of the gold at Keltepe may be present in the 

altered breccia clasts and rock flour produced by their comminution (Sillitoe, 2012). 

 

GÜNEYTEPE DEPOSIT 
GEOLOGY AND STRUCTURE 
The Güneytepe Deposit is located approximately 600 m to the south-southeast of the Keltepe 

Deposit.  Gold mineralization primarily occurs along NW-SE and NE-SW trending ledges of 

two compositions: 1) massive to vuggy residual quartz with associated silicification, and 2) 

quartz-alunite plus quartz-kaolinite alteration.  The location of the ledges is controlled by the 

intersection of NW-SE and NE-SW trending structures.  The siliceous ledges form prominent 

outcrops in the higher parts of the prospect area.  However, their vertical extent appears to be 

limited to approximately 100 m.  The ledges flare upwards and tend to coalesce, suggesting 

that only their roots are preserved.  In contrast, the quartz-alunite plus quartz-kaolinite ledges 

occur at lower elevations and are largely concealed beneath talus cover.  These comprise 

steep bands of quartz-alunite and quartz-kaolinite alteration and may be vertically more 

extensive (>200 m). 

 

As observed at the Keltepe Deposit, gold mineralization at the Güneytepe Deposit is also 

considered to be controlled by NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults.  The deposit is bounded to 

the north and south by two NE-SW trending fault zones, which confine the gold mineralization 

into a NE-SW trending corridor.  Based on field and drill hole observations, the NE-SW faults 

are interpreted to be dominantly left-lateral strike-slip faults, whereas the NW-SE trending 

faults are dominantly dip-slip and they present as a step-like morphology from the upper to the 

lower parts side of the Güneytepe Deposit.   

 
ALTERATION 
Both the siliceous and quartz-alunite ± quartz-kaolinite ledges are enclosed by quartz-kaolinite 

alteration displaying patchy texture.  Typically, such alteration comprises amoeboid patches of 

fine-grained quartz surrounded by massive kaolinite.  The texture is considered likely to be a 

product of quartz nucleation during kaolinization (Sillitoe, 2011).  In South America, patchy 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-19 

silica alteration (Gusano texture) is considered to represent a transitional zone from high-

sulphidation epithermal style to porphyry style (Redwood, 2009). 

 

Below the base of oxidation, remnant patches of early, pre-ledge alteration are present in the 

andesitic host rocks.  In peripheral parts of the system, this early alteration is best described 

as weak potassic and comprises fine-grained, pale brown biotite and variable amounts of 

magnetite.  The magnetite, locally constituting 5% by volume of the altered rock, tends to occur 

as irregular patches, but is also observed as veinlets and as breccia cement.  Variable amounts 

of chlorite, illite, and smectite overprint the potassic assemblage and hematite partially or 

wholly replaces the magnetite. 

 

In the central parts of the system, the potassic alteration is focused on a body of polymictic 

hydrothermal breccia, which is at least 150 m x 100 m in areal extent and extends for >150 m 

vertically.  The breccia is inter-mineral in timing as shown by a variety of altered clasts 

cemented mainly by pyrite.  Individual clasts contain minor amounts of chalcopyrite or 

molybdenite, and some contain truncated quartz veinlets of uncertain affiliation. 

 

The breccia appears to be consistently mineralized with gold, but lacks appreciable copper.  In 

contrast, the peripheral weak potassic alteration is barren, irrespective of the amount of 

contained hydrothermal magnetite. 

 

The breccia body appears to be of magmatic-hydrothermal type and, as such, seems likely to 

be underlain at unknown depth by a porphyry stock, which may contain porphyry-type 

mineralization.  The nature and grade of any such mineralization cannot be predicted, although 

the overall deficiency of copper in the potassic-altered breccia suggests that it may be a gold-

only rather than a copper-gold system (Sillitoe, 2011). 

 
OXIDATION 
Oxidation in the ledges rarely exceeds 150 m in depth and is usually much less, averaging 

approximately 50 m to 75 m. Oxidation appears to be deeper in the massive to vuggy quartz 

and quartz-alunite zones than in those composed mainly of quartz-kaolinite.  The deeper 

oxidation in the siliceous ledges is most likely due the higher porosity and the higher amount 

of acid-generating pyrite.  The main oxidation products are jarosite and hematite.  The base of 

the oxide zone is complex and highly irregular.  Beneath the redox boundary, a 10 m to 20 m 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-20 

thick, immature chalcocite enrichment zone has developed.  The chalcocite is sooty in texture 

and occurs as thin replacement films on pyrite.  The supergene copper is presumed to have 

been derived from the oxidation of the minor amounts of enargite and covellite that accompany 

pyrite in the ledges. 

 
MINERALIZATION 
Gold mineralization mainly occurs within massive to vuggy silica and quartz-alunite altered 

material.  The silica bodies are classic ledges in the sense that the best gold values accompany 

the massive to vuggy quartz, with lower grades being present in the smaller volumes of 

accompanying quartz-alunite alteration.  Gold also occurs in the quartz-kaolinite alteration in 

which alunite contents are generally lower.  Mineralization extends for approximately 335 m in 

the northwest-southeast direction and is open further to the north.  Sulphide mineralization 

attains depths of 330 m from surface, while oxide mineralization occurs at a depth of not more 

than 110 m.  Gold mineralization at Güneytepe is more variable than at Keltepe in both grade 

and lateral/vertical distribution.  Higher sulphur contents are also recorded in the oxide zone 

due to sulphides, mostly pyrite, being encapsulated within massive silica and also in patchy 

silica altered rocks. 

 

A gold deportment study has shown that the major gold mineral at Güneytepe is native gold 

with an average grain size of 5.4 μm (SGS Canada Inc., 2013, Figure 7-8).  The mineral 

kustelite, an Au-Ag alloy with Ag ≥50 wt%, was also identified. This study also indicates that 

the host minerals for the gold in the sample studied are alunite with trace (<2%) associations 

with quartz, silicates, and iron oxide particles.

OTHER MINERALIZED ZONES 
The Öksüt Project includes several other exploration targets in addition to the Keltepe and 

Güneytepe Deposits.  All of these (Keltepe NW, Yelibelen, Büyüktepe, Boztepe, Boztepe W, 

Keltepe E, and Tombak) have received exploratory work since 2008.   

 

At the Keltepe NW Prospect, located approximately 700 m to the northwest of the Keltepe 

Deposit, outcrops of quartz-alunite breccia and massive silica returned low-level gold 

anomalism (maximum 0.6 ppm Au) in rock chip samples.  Limited drilling (three holes) beneath 

these outcrops during 2011 and 2012 returned a number of shallow oxide intercepts with 

grades up to 0.5 g/t Au over 10.6 m in hole ODD0042.  Further drilling (four holes) in 2013, 

only returned narrow, weakly anomalous gold intercepts in the oxide zone but did intercept 25 

m grading 0.89 g/t Au and 1.97% Cu at depth in the sulphide zone (hole ODD0178).  This 

intercept, combined with the intercepts from Keltepe, indicated that the potential exists for a 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 7-22 

significant sulphide copper-gold resource at depth at the Öksüt Project.  However, subsequent 

deep drilling in 2014 at Keltepe, Keltepe NW and between the two prospects, which was 

designed to test the potential of the copper-gold sulphides, generally returned narrower, lower 

grade intercepts up to a maximum of 11.0 m grading 1.44% Cu in hole ODD0237. 

 

At the Tombak and Keltepe E Prospects, limited reverse circulation (RC) percussion and 

diamond drilling was undertaken in 2014 to test coincident zones of advanced argillic alteration 

associated with a circular magnetic low at Tombak and with a circular resistivity high at Keltepe 

E.  No significant gold or silver values were returned from drilling at these prospects.  However, 

drill hole ODD0233, at Keltepe E, returned weakly to strongly anomalous assay results for a 

number of elements including arsenic, barium, bismuth, copper, molybdenum, lead, antimony 

selenium, tin, tellurium, and uranium.  This anomalism reflects a general porphyry-style 

geochemical signature.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Gold mineralization at the Öksüt Project is associated with intense silicic alteration (mostly 

massive to lesser vuggy silica), advanced argillic alteration, and the presence of hydrothermal 

breccias.  The original protolith (porphyritic andesitic lavas and coarse-grained volcaniclastics) 

may have contained in the order of 2% to 5% sulphide as pyrite with trace amounts of enargite 

and tennantite-tetrahedrite.  Gold mineralization at Öksüt occurs primarily within areas of 

pervasive silicic alteration of the volcanic host rocks as well as within advanced argillic 

alteration assemblages proximal to silicic alteration.  The gold mineralization occurs mainly 

above the redox boundary, although a number of drill holes have returned anomalous gold 

intercepts in the supergene sulphide zone. 

 

Based on these observations, the gold mineralization at the Öksüt Project is considered to 

have formed as part of a high-sulphidation epithermal system, possibly overlying a porphyry 

system at depth.  Epithermal precious metal systems may be classified as high, intermediate, 

and low-sulphidation styles (Figure 8-1).  They are characterized by the sulphidation state of 

the hypogene sulphide mineral assemblage, and show general relations in volcano-tectonic 

setting, precious and base metal content, igneous rock association, proximal hypogene 

alteration, and sulphide abundance (John, 2001; Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003).  

 

Occurrences of this type are formed under epizonal conditions, generally within 2 km of the 

palaeo-surface.  High-sulphidation systems have also been referred to as acid-sulphate, 

enargite-gold, or alunite-kaolinite systems.  Most high-sulphidation systems are associated 

with coeval andesite to dacite volcanic arcs, and are hosted by extensive "pre-mineral" 

advanced argillic lithocaps.  The principal ore host is massive to vuggy residual silica, resulting 

from intense acid leaching of a pre-existing volcanic host rock.  Proximal alteration comprises 

hypogene dickite, alunite (often crystalline), and/or pyrophyllite (Figure 8-2).   

 

Sulphides include enargite, pyrite, and luzonite.  Quartz veining is extremely rare, however, 

some deposits are overprinted by late barite and quartz veins.  Laterally extensive sheets of 

intensely silicified rocks occur in many districts, and represent zones of lateral outflow of mixed 

hydrothermal and meteoritic water.  Silica is transported in the acidic hydrothermal water, and 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 8-2 

on intersection with the palaeo-water table, undergoes neutralization and deposition of silica 

forming cryptocrystalline silica sheets.  

 

Most high-sulphidation deposits are large, low grade bulk-tonnage systems (e.g., Yanacocha 

and Alto Chicama, Peru), though vein-hosted high-sulphidation deposits also occur (e.g., El 

Indio, Chile).  In contrast, low- and intermediate-sulphidation state systems are typically related 

to quartz and carbonate veins, near-neutral hydrothermal fluids, and lack proximal advanced 

argillic alteration and residual vuggy silica.  Steam-heated alteration is present above some 

intermediate- and low-sulphidation state systems' advanced argillic assemblages.  However, 

they usually comprise low-temperature kaolinite, and fine-grained alunite.  Sulphides are of a 

low- to intermediate-sulphidation state.

9 EXPLORATION 
Gold mineralization was discovered at Öksüt in 2007 by Stratex.  Prior to this, there is no 

record of any modern exploration for gold being conducted on the property.  Exploration 

activities had been performed by Stratex staff from 2007 to 2012 (with technical guidance from 

Centerra from 2009 to 2012) and by OMAS staff from 2013 onwards.  In the QP's opinion, the 

sampling methods used and sample quality are representative of the mineralization and have 

no significant bias, as described in Sections 11 and 12.  A summary of the exploration and 

some other activities undertaken by both companies is presented in Table 9-1.   

Stratex followed up on gold bearing rock chip and channel sampling results in 2007 with 

additional rock chip and channel sampling and geological mapping in 2008.  Based on the 

continued success of the surface sampling, drilling commenced at Öksüt in August 2008.  

The initial drill program was limited to the area of Güneytepe where surface sampling had 

produced the best results.  This program intersected gold mineralization starting at the surface 

and extending up to 70 m below the surface. 

After signing the joint venture agreement with Centerra in 2009, Stratex performed further 

geological mapping, geochemical sampling, ground geophysics, and trenching.  The 2010 drill 

program confirmed the presence of gold mineralization at Keltepe.  The majority of drilling and 

exploration activities since 2010 have focused on delineating the extents of mineralization at 

Güneytepe and Keltepe as well as defining additional targets with mineralization potential.  

Other exploration activities during this period were performed to gather data for environmental 

and engineering purposes.

10 DRILLING 
DRILLING DATABASE 
The Öksüt database contains a total of 330 drill holes (including re-drills, metallurgical holes, 

geotechnical holes and water monitoring holes) totaling 82,006 metres of drilling.  Of these 

330 drill holes, 58 holes are reverse circulation (RC) drill holes and the remaining 272 holes 

are diamond drill holes (DD). 

 

A subset of 292 holes was used to update Öksüt Mineral Resource estimate.  This subset of 

holes covers all exploration drilling on the Öksüt concessions and includes numerous holes 

drilled beyond the mineralized extents of Keltepe and Güneytepe.  Only 41 holes of the 292 

hole subset are RC holes and of these, only four holes are located within the extents of the 

mineralization and used for grade estimation.  

 

The 38 engineering holes not included within the subset used for the estimate are metallurgical 

holes, water well holes, or geotechnical holes that were not assayed.   

 

Tables 10-1 and 10-2 summarize the various subsets described above.

Industry-standard diamond drilling procedures have been employed at all times.  Drilling has 

been concentrated in two main areas of the Project, Keltepe and Güneytepe.  The 2008-2011 

drilling programs were carried out by Ankara-based drilling contractor Pozitif Sondaj and were 

supervised by Stratex personnel.  Drilling was carried out using one to three contractor-

manufactured drill rigs.  The model numbers are PD300, PD400, and PD500 with depth 

capacities of 650 m, 800 m, and 1,000 m of HQ-size (63.5 mm) core, respectively.  Between 

2008 and 2011, the drilling was mostly HQ size, which was reduced to NQ-size (47.6 mm) core 

when ground conditions became difficult.  Drill holes with poor recoveries (generally less than 

50% to 70%) through mineralized intervals or those that were abandoned before target depth 

were re-drilled. 

 

The drill hole density varies from prospect to prospect, however, the nominal drill spacing at 

the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits is approximately 50 m. Drill holes were mostly inclined 

(between -45° and -90°) and oriented predominantly to grid northeast (077º) or grid southwest 

(257º) at Keltepe and grid northeast (060º) and/or grid southwest (240º) at Güneytepe.  Drill 

hole deviation was measured using Reflex Survey tests taken at nominal 30 m to 50 m intervals 

down hole to provide control.  In general, little hole deviation was observed.  

 

The 2012-2014 drilling programs were carried out by Ankara-based drilling contractor Spektra 

Jeotek with the 2012 program being supervised by Stratex personnel and the 2013 and 2014 

programs being supervised by OMAS personnel.  Drilling was carried out using up to five 

contractor-manufactured drill rigs.  The model numbers are D 150 and D 220 with depth 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 10-3 

capacities of 1,000 m and 1,250 m of HQ-size core, respectively.  From 2012 to 2014, mostly 

PQ- and HQ-size core drilling was carried out, with rare reductions to NQ-size when ground 

conditions became difficult.  Drill holes with poor recoveries (generally less than 50% to 70%) 

through mineralized intervals or those that were abandoned before target depth were re-drilled. 

 

OMAS commenced drilling triple-tube drill holes with a split tube in late 2013 to aid in 

determining the orientation of mineralized structures.  In 2014, triple-tube drilling was only used 

for metallurgical and geotechnical drill holes, as a comparison with earlier drilling showed that 

core recoveries did not improve significantly using the triple-tube drilling technique.  Overall, 

core recoveries are considered to be good and within tolerance to include in a resource 

estimate.  

 
Core recovery measurements were taken on 248 of the 251 diamond drill holes contained 

within the resource estimation subset of 292 holes.  Table 10-3 summarizes the ranges of core 

recovery for assayed core intervals.

The assay data indicate a small statistical decrease of the gold grade with decreasing core 

recovery, suggesting that lost core tends to be of slightly higher grade than the recovered core.  

The data show that the magnitude of this trend is not large and Centerra does not anticipate a

need to run alternate grade interpolations without intervals with low core recovery.  Figure 10-

1 plots recovery against gold grade for all samples and shows that samples above 5 g/t Au 

rarely have recoveries of less than 60%.

Drill collar locations were first determined by site personnel using a hand-held GPS.  

Subsequent to the completion of the hole, collar locations were surveyed by a registered land 

surveyor using a differential global positioning system (DGPS) with a horizontal and vertical 

accuracy of generally ± 20 cm.  The positions of all drill collars have been surveyed by this 

method.  Figure 10-2 shows all of the Keltepe and Güneytepe drill hole locations.

Mineralized zones at Öksüt are somewhat irregular in shape and orientation, and true 

thickness is variable.  It is estimated that true widths for mineralized zones are approximately 

50% to 90% of the down hole intervals.  Geological modelling and mineral resource estimation 

procedures take into account the intercept angles of drilling versus the interpreted geometry 

of mineralization. 

 

RC PERCUSSION DRILLING 
A total of 58 RC percussion holes (including condemnation holes, exploration holes, and water 

monitoring holes) were completed by OMAS in the Project area in 2014.  The drill hole density 

varies from area to area, depending upon the purpose of each drill hole.  Condemnation and 

water monitoring holes were generally drilled vertically while exploration holes were drilled at 

-60° towards varying azimuths.   

 

The RC percussion drilling programs were carried out by Ankara-based drilling contractor 

Pozitif Sondaj (condemnation holes, exploration holes, and water monitoring holes) and 

Trabzon-based Kurt Sondaj (water monitoring holes only).  The holes drilled by Pozitif Sondaj 

were drilled with a Gemex MP 1000 HOA rig, capable of drilling to a depth of 400 m with 4 in. 

outside diameter rods.  A Sandvik RE004 RC hammer with a variety of bit sizes was used.  

The holes drilled by Kurt Sondaj were drilled with a 2004 model AS950 truck-mounted rig with 

800 m drilling capacity.  An open-hole percussion hammer with 12 in. to 15 in. bits was used.  

 

In the QP's opinion, there are no drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially 

impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
From 2007 to 2012, samples from the Öksüt Project were sent to ALS Chemex in Izmir, Turkey 

with the actual analyses conducted in the ALS facility in Vancouver, Canada or Roşia Montanӑ, 

Romania and finally, in Izmir.  From September 2012 onwards, preparation and analysis of 

samples were carried out by SGS Ankara, Turkey.  Gold was assayed using standard 50 g fire 

assay with an atomic absorption (AA) finish, and other elements were determined by multi-

acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) finish.  Both laboratories are independent 

ISO 9001:2008 registered external commercial assay laboratories.  Surface samples are not 

included in the Öksüt Project Mineral Resource database and are not used for Mineral 

Resource estimation. 

 

CORE AND RC CHIP SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
At the Öksüt Project, diamond drilling has employed PQ (85.0 mm), HQ (63.5 mm), and NQ 

(47.6 mm) diameter core tools, with the majority of the holes now being PQ in diameter.  

Additionally, PQ diameter core has been employed during metallurgical drill programs.  All core 

and RC percussion chip samples are subjected to quality control procedures that ensure best 

practice in the handling, sampling, analysis, and storage of the drill core and RC percussion 

chips.   

 

For diamond drilling, diamond drill core is delivered by the drill crew to OMAS geological 

personnel at the Develi core facilities.  To maintain the integrity of the core, the boxes are 

packed and fastened shut with steel ties in the back of the trucks.  At the core facility, the core 

is photographed and then laid out for logging and geotechnical measurements.  The core is 

measured for core recovery (TCR) and rock quality (RQD) and then logged for geological, 

structural, and geotechnical features.  Sampling intervals are selected on a geological basis 

but typically vary from one to two metres in length.  Core is divided lengthwise into two halves 

using a diamond saw.  Assay samples are collected by trained personnel from one-half of split 

core and the other half is replaced in the core box for future reference.  

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 11-2 

For RC drilling, dry chip samples are obtained using a standard cyclone and on-board riffle 

splitter.  A 25:75 split is obtained with the smaller portion being bagged for analysis and the 

larger portion being retained in the plastic sample bag.  A small amount of sample from each 

bag is washed and placed in a numbered chip tray.  A geologist is on site at all times to monitor 

the sampling and log the chips.  Additional chip logging is also carried out in the Develi core 

facility. 

 

The core and RC chips to be assayed are placed in marked calico bags and sealed.  Standard, 

duplicate, and blank samples are inserted in the sample stream before shipping with pre-

assigned sample numbers.  Sample weights are not recorded at site but are recorded at the 

laboratory.  The site technicians and one of the site geologists are responsible for sample 

custody until shipment.  The retained core and larger RC chip split are stored in a secure area 

at the Develi core facility.   

 

Assay samples are shipped by an independent transport company to the laboratory in Turkey.  

Receipt of sample shipments by the laboratory is confirmed by electronic mail. 

 

SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
Prior to drill hole ODD0070, samples were prepared and analyzed at ALS Chemex laboratories 

in Roşia Montanӑ, Romania and Izmir, Turkey.  For holes drilled after drill hole ODD0070 

(inclusive), samples were prepared and analyzed at SGS Ankara, Turkey.  Both ALS Chemex 

and SGS Ankara laboratories have been assessed and certified as meeting the requirements 

of ISO 9001:2008, and are commercial laboratories independent of Centerra. 

 

Preparation and analytical methods are described in Table 11-1 for samples submitted to ALS 

Romania or Izmir from 2008 to September 2012.

QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES 
Geochemical Certified Reference Material (CRMs) has been used in all diamond and RC 

drilling programs at the Öksüt Project.  During the period August 2008 to February 2013, 

Stratex inserted CRMs and blanks at the rates shown below.   

• Insertion of a coarse blank, one in every 100 samples; 

• Insertion of a CRM, three in every 100 samples; 

• Insertion of a duplicate ¼ core sample, one in every 100 samples. 

 

During the period May 2013 to November 2014, OMAS inserted CRMs, duplicates, and blanks 

at the rates shown below. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 11-4 

• Insertion of a coarse blank, one in every 50 samples; 

• Insertion of a CRM, one in every 30 samples; 

• Insertion of a duplicate ¼ core sample, one in every 50 samples; 

• Routine duplicate assays of pulps as part of laboratory QC protocols. 

 

Blank control samples are from either barren limestone (Stratex) or barren basalt (OMAS).  

Blanks weighing from one to two kilograms are inserted in the sampling stream by the site field 

technician.  

 

CRMs were supplied by Rocklabs Limited (Rocklabs) in New Zealand (Stratex) or Geostats 

Pty Ltd (Geostats) in Australia (OMAS).  Approximately 60 g of the standards are inserted in 

the sampling stream in small "Kraft" paper envelopes or sealed plastic sachets.  The certified 

gold values of the Geostats standards were selected to approximate the mining cut-off grade 

(0.2 g/t Au), the deposit average grade (1.2 g/t Au), and three to five times above the average 

grade. 

 

To date, a total of 2,094 gold CRMs have been submitted along with core samples from 22 

different standards (15 – Stratex and 7 – OMAS) with certified assay values varying from 0.201 

ppm to 4.075 ppm Au (Rocklabs) and from 0.22 ppm to 4.086 ppm Au (Geostats).  This 

includes a total of 23 copper CRMs that have been submitted from a single CRM with a certified 

assay value of 1.04 ppm Au and 1.034% Cu.  A total of 55 gold CRMs (as described above) 

have been submitted along with RC percussion chip samples.   

 

QUALITY CONTROL RESULTS 
Quality control reviews of each batch of assay results were undertaken before the results were 

entered into the Mineral Resource database. 

 

CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS 
A total of 2,094 CRMs were analyzed in conjunction with core samples.  Results are 

summarized in Table 11-3 and are presented in graphic form for gold in Figure 11-1.  A total 

of 48 CRM samples are not included in Table 11-3 or on Figure 11-1 due to mis-labelling, 

which resulted in spurious statistical average values.

The CRMs generally performed well, with very few failures outside of three standard deviations 

from the mean.  In the instances of a CRM failure, ten samples on either side of the affected 

CRM were re-assayed and acceptable results were returned in all instances.  The SGS gold 

assays tend to be biased low by 3% to 5% for some of the CRMs in use.

The results for the quarter diamond core and RC percussion chip duplicate data compare well 

and do not show any significant bias between the duplicate pair analysis results.  The grade 

dispersion is at a scale that is to be expected for duplicate core samples. 

 

CHECK ASSAYING 
A protocol was initiated in 2012 to send 5% of all assayed sample pulps to a second laboratory 

for analysis.  At that time, ALS Chemex was the laboratory used for routine analysis of drill 

samples and Acme Labs, Ankara, Turkey, was selected to provide external check assays.  

External check assays are an additional means of data verification and are useful in identifying 

any substantial biases between laboratories, which may have been introduced during the 

course of the Project.  In all cases, CRMs were included in the sample stream to be check 

assayed.  The results of the check assays are compiled in Table 11-7.

This limited program of check assaying shows reasonable reproducibility of the gold analytical 

results between the three laboratories and there was no significant bias in the results.  

 

FIELD BLANKS 
A total of 1,445 blanks were submitted and analyzed in conjunction with core samples.  All 

blank assay data were graphed for gold (Figure 11-4).  Nearly all the blank samples returned 

gold values less than three times the lower detection limit of 0.005 g/t Au (ALS) or 0.010 g/t 

Au (SGS).  However, 15 field blanks (1.0%) returned unacceptably high values.  In the instance 

of a blank failure, ten samples either side of the affected blank were re-assayed and acceptable 

results were returned in all instances.  The blank results demonstrated that carry-over 

contamination at the crushing and pulverizing stage has not been a significant issue.

AUDITS 
A site audit was completed by Lynda Bloom of Analytical Solutions Ltd. (ASL) in May 2013.  

The purpose of the visit was to: 

• Prepare an assay quality control report  

• Carry out an audit of the SGS Ankara laboratory  

• Undertake a review of drill core sampling and handling 

• Conduct assay QC training 

 

Based on the review of QC data and a site visit to the Öksüt Project, ASL considered that 

"there is no evidence of bias within the current database (at May 2013) which would materially 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 11-12 

impact a mineral resource estimate".  ASL recommended that the possible small low bias at 

SGS Ankara be monitored (Bloom, 2013).  

 

In the QP's opinion, the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures at the Öksüt 

Project are adequate for use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
HISTORICAL DATABASE 
OMAS conducted an internal validation of the databases supplied to it by Stratex and has 

determined that no significant data entry problems existed.  This validation was performed by 

comparing the gold values from the assay database against gold values from the assay 

laboratory certificates. 

 

OMAS DATABASE 
OMAS conducts comprehensive internal validation of its databases, both in hard copy and 

electronic format.  Drill collars are professionally surveyed.  All laboratory results are checked 

by a qualified geologist before loading into the database and again at regular intervals for long-

term trends.   

 

At the end of the 2012, 2013, and 2014 drill seasons, OMAS performed internal database 

audits on all hard copy and electronic data and determined that no significant data entry 

problems existed.  The analytical data are considered to be sufficiently reliable to support 

geology and resource modelling.  No external audits have been conducted on the Öksüt 

database, however; a third-party audit is planned for 2016.  

 

In the QPs' opinion, the various steps taken by OMAS to ensure the integrity of analytical data 

are consistent with standard industry practice.  The sampling procedures are appropriate for 

the style of mineralization and structural controls for the Öksüt Project and are adequate for 

the estimation of Mineral Resources in this report.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
SUMMARY 
Metallurgical testing has focused on supporting the development of the Öksüt Project as a 

heap leach operation.  Testing to date has focused on gold recovery at coarse particle sizes.  

Metallurgical testing was initiated in 2012 using samples from existing exploration diamond 

drill holes.  A second program, completed in 2012, utilized samples from a single large 

diameter hole to provide the bulk of the sample for this program.  The second program included 

the first column leach tests.  In 2013, four large diameter drill holes were drilled (three in the 

Keltepe Deposit and one in the Güneytepe Deposit) to provide samples for two large scale 

column leach test programs.  A mineralogy program was also completed on the samples from 

this program.  In 2014, a further five large diameter drill holes (one in the Güneytepe Deposit 

and four in the Keltepe Deposit) were completed to provide samples for additional large scale 

column leach tests and further mineralogical analysis. 

 

The results from all programs show that samples from the Öksüt Project are amenable to heap 

leach processing.  Leach rates are relatively fast with comparatively high final recoveries.  Size 

by size analysis of the column leach test feed and tails samples shows gold evenly distributed 

among the size classes, roughly following the mass splits. 

 

Since the Keltepe Deposit contains approximately 90% of the contained gold for the Öksüt 

Project, the leach characteristics for the Keltepe Deposit will predominate.  Güneytepe Deposit 

leach characteristics are expected to be as good as or better than Keltepe Deposit and are not 

anticipated to present any issues.  Analyzing all the column test results at the estimated 

Keltepe Deposit average grade of 1.24 g/t Au, the corresponding leach residue grade will be 

0.23 g/t Au, with a resulting recovery of 81.4%.  For scale-up purposes, this is discounted by 

4% and an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery (ADR) efficiency factor of 99% is applied which 

results in a design recovery of 77%.

2012 PRELIMINARY LEACH TESTING 
A series of five diamond drill hole composite samples from Keltepe were sent to SGS Mineral 

Services UK Ltd. (Cornwall, UK Laboratory) for a preliminary leach test program (Williams, 

2012).  The scope of work included: 

• Comprehensive head assays; 

• Screened metallics gold and silver head assays. 

• Leach tests at particle size distributions of 100% passing (D100) 3.35 mm, 1.00 mm, 
0.50 mm, 0.15 mm, and 0.075 mm. 

 

Head grades ranged from 0.76 g/t Au to 2.20 g/t Au.  The results showed that gold recoveries 

at the finer particle size distribution are not significantly better than the coarser size distribution.  

At the coarser size distribution, recoveries ranged from the 58% (transition quartz alunite) to 

86% (oxide quartz alunite).  At the finest particle size distribution, recoveries ranged from 78% 

(transition quartz alunite) to 92% (oxide quartz alunite and oxide massive silica). 

 

The results demonstrate that acceptable recoveries can be achieved at coarse particle size 

distributions. 

 

2012 COLUMN LEACH PROGRAM 
Based on the positive results from the 2012 preliminary leach test program, the first column 

leach test program was initiated.  To provide the required sample for the program, a large 

diameter drill hole (ODD0075) was drilled in the Keltepe Deposit.  This hole twinned existing 

drill hole ODD0048, which was selected as it intersected the three types of mineralization: 

• Oxidized massive silica breccia, 

• Transition massive silica, 

• Oxidized quartz alunite. 

 

The scope of work for this program included: 

• Comprehensive head assays, including screened metallics gold and silver assays, 

• Coarse bottle rolls tests at two crush sizes:  100% passing 31.5 mm and 12.5 mm, 

• Agglomeration tests, 

• Column leach tests at two crush sizes:  100% passing 31.5 mm and 12.5 mm. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-3 

This program was also conducted at SGS Mineral Services UK Ltd. (Cook, 2013).  The work 

commenced in the fall of 2012 and was concluded in May 2013.   

 

Screened metallic head assays for the three samples are shown in Table 13-1.  Samples were 

again screened at 106 µm to determine the coarse gold content.  No significant coarse gold or 

"nugget effect" was found.

Transition Massive Silica 3.75 

Oxidized Quartz Alunite 1.96 
 

The drill hole location was selected to intersect the three predominant types of mineralization.  

The head grades of the three samples are substantially higher than the overall resource grade. 

 

In general, the following observations can be made on the coarse bottle roll leach test results: 

• The higher recoveries were generally achieved at the finer crush size and highest 
cyanide concentration for the massive silica samples. 
 

• Recoveries were highest for the oxidized quartz alunite sample 
 

The column leach tests were initially scheduled to run for 42 days but extended to 56 days due 

to the slow leach rates for the two massive silica samples.   

 

The oxidized quartz alunite sample had the highest recoveries, with the coarser crush size 

producing the highest recovery at 90% gold and 84% gold for the -12.5 mm sample. 

The transition massive silica sample had the next highest recoveries at 64% gold for the -31.5 

mm sample and the -12.5 mm sample had a recovery of only 50% after 56 days of leaching. 

 

The oxidized massive silica sample had the lowest recoveries with 46% gold for the -31.5 mm 

sample and 47% for the -12.5 mm sample after 56 days of leaching.

The results demonstrate that the Keltepe samples tested are amenable to leaching at coarse 

particle sizes that are used in heap leaching. The leach times were typical for gold samples. 

 

2013 COLUMN LEACH TESTS (KCA PHASE 1) 
The 2013 column leach program was designed to build on the results from the 2012 program.  

One of the objectives was to prepare overall composites of the Keltepe and Güneytepe 

Deposits to further evaluate the effects of crush size and leach time. 

 

Four large diameter diamond drill holes were twinned from existing holes to provide the 

required samples in sufficient quantities for large scale testing.  The drill holes selected 

resulted in a composite sample that is spatially representative of the deposit with a grade close 

to the resource grade.  The large diameter diamond drill holes and the original holes from 

which they were twinned are shown in Table 13-2.

Kappes Cassiday & Associates (KCA) in Reno, Nevada, was selected to conduct this program 

due its extensive experience in the testing and development of heap leach projects (KCA, 

2013).  The scope of work for this program included: 

• Comprehensive head analysis. 

• Fine pulverized (80% passing 75 µm) bottle roll leach tests. 

• Coarse (80% passing 1.7 mm) bottle roll leach tests. 

• Preliminary agglomeration testing. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-5 

• Compacted permeability testing. 

• Coarse column leach test (100% passing 50 mm, 80% passing 37.5 mm) for the 
Keltepe sample. 

• Fine column leach test (100% passing 19 mm, 80% passing 12.5 mm) for the Keltepe 
and Güneytepe samples. 

• Comprehensive head and tails screen analysis of column leach samples, including size 
by size gold and silver assays. 

• Hardness testing for comminution parameters. 

 

Samples from each composite were also sent to SGS Canada Inc. (SGS Canada) for 

mineralogical and gold deportment studies.  
 
Despite only being coarsely crushed, each sample shows significant content of fines.  This is 

also evident throughout the drill core. 

 

Comprehensive head assays for the two composite samples are shown in Table 13-3.

is in the form of pyrite.  Both samples contain very low levels of organic carbon and negligible 

mercury levels.  The copper content of both samples is well below the level at which cyanide 

consumption becomes an issue, 500 g/t cyanide soluble copper. 

 
Multi-element and whole rock analyses for each sample are found in the KCA report (KCA,

The recoveries are in the same range as those from the coarse bottle roll leach tests from the 

2012 column program, which were higher grade samples.  The pulverized samples show very 

similar recoveries.  The coarse Güneytepe sample recovery is unexpectedly higher than the 

Keltepe sample, which is more intensely oxidized. 

 

Three column leach tests were completed; two for Keltepe and one for Güneytepe.  The tests 

had two set-ups: 

• Large diameter column (200 mm x 1.5 m high) for the -50 mm (80% passing -37.5 mm) 
Keltepe sample.   
 

• Small diameter column (150 mm x 1.9 m high) for the -19 mm (80% passing -12.5 mm) 
Keltepe and Güneytepe samples.   

 

Key test conditions included: 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-7 

• Solution application maintained between 0.010 m3/h/m2 and 0.012 m3/h/m2 of the 
column area.  This is the typical solution application rate for most full scale heap leach 
operations. 
 

• Planned leach time of 60 days that was reduced to 56 days.   
 

• Initial cyanide solution addition of 1.0 g/L NaCN, reduced to 0.60 g/L NaCN. 
 

• Hydrated lime used for pH control.

The weighted average screen tails is the weighted average assay obtained from the size by 

size analysis of the leach tails.  Size by size analysis of the leach feed samples showed gold 

distributed across the size fractions in proportion to the weight in each fraction.  The leach 

tailings show a similar pattern. 

 

While the proportion of each mineralization type in the composite samples has not been 

determined, the overall recoveries were not impacted by the expected low recoveries from the 

two massive silica mineralization types. 

 

The presence of pyrite in the Güneytepe sample has not impacted the gold recovery, indicating 

either minimal gold occurring with pyrite or sufficient pyrite oxidation to expose any contained 

gold. 

 

Based on KCA's experience, actual cyanide consumptions are approximately 30% of column 

test results. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-8 

Samples from each of the composites were sent to SGS Canada for mineralogical studies, 

gold deportment analysis and diagnostic leach tests (SGS, 2014).   

 

Key highlights from this program include: 

• Gold occurs as native gold in both the Keltepe and Güneytepe samples. 
 

• The observed gold grains were 85% liberated and exposed in the Keltepe sample and 
69% in the Güneytepe sample.  The amount of free and exposed gold in the Güneytepe 
sample is anomalous since gold recovery in the leach tests was well above 80%. 
 

• The average gold grain size was 6.9 µm in the Keltepe sample and 5.4 µm in the 
Güneytepe sample.  This confirms the results of the screened metallic head assays 
with minimal gold in the coarse fraction. 
 

• In the Keltepe sample, the host minerals are mainly quartz and other silicates and iron 
oxide, with minor (2% to 10%) rutile-silicate complexes and trace associations with 
pyrite. 
 

• The major host mineral in the Güneytepe sample is alunite, with trace (<2%) 
associations with quartz, silicates, and iron oxide particles. 

 

Diagnostic leach tests showing the gold associations are listed in Table 13-6.

comminution tests and no mineralogical studies were carried out (KCA, 2014a).  

 

Results of the coarse and fine bottle roll leach tests are shown in Table 13-8.  All leach tests 

were conducted for 96 hours.  The results follow the trends of previous similar tests with higher

KCA PHASE 3 
The next set of column tests (known as KCA Phase 3) was completed between July and 

December 2014.  Six large diameter diamond drill holes were twinned from existing holes to 

provide the required samples in sufficient quantities for large scale testing.  The drill holes 

selected to provide five Keltepe composite samples that are representative of the two major 

mineralization types (three quartz alunite samples and two massive silica samples) at the lower 

grade ranges.  A single lower grade quartz alunite composite sample was produced for

The Keltepe sample recoveries were unexpected.  Massive silica mineralization was 

considered somewhat refractory; one of the two tests had low recovery while the other had 

good recovery.  Two of the quartz alunite samples had low recoveries.  Quartz alunite 

mineralization is not considered problematic.  The Güneytepe recoveries were in agreement 

with the earlier tests. 

 

Size by size analysis of the column leach feed samples and the column leach residue samples 

follow a consistent trend.  Gold is relatively evenly distributed in each size class, with no 

concentration of gold in the finest size classes as is often commonly seen. 

 

All five samples from the Phase 3 program were submitted to SGS Canada for mineralogical 

analysis and gold diagnostic leach tests (SGS, 2015). 

 

The predominant mineral in all samples was quartz.  The Güneytepe sample had the highest 

alunite content of all the samples at 15% and the lowest quartz content of the samples at 50%.  

The Güneytepe sample had an observed pyrite content of only 0.33%, although it had the 

highest sulphide sulphur content of 1.2%.  The Güneytepe sample also had 18% muscovite.  

The next most abundant minerals in the Keltepe samples are alunite, kaolinite, and muscovite. 

 

In terms of gold deportment, all samples showed very high levels of liberated plus exposed 

gold (76% to 98%) with the exception of the Keltepe lowest grade quartz alunite sample, which 

showed a locked gold content of 87%.  This sample had the lowest column leach recovery of 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-14 

59%, despite the very high observed locked gold content.  Observed gold particles were quite 

fine, ranging in size from 6 µm to 20 µm. 

 

These (including Phase 1) results in combination with the size by size analysis for all phases 

suggest that the oxide nature of the Öksüt Project and the fine nature of the gold allows for 

good exposure to leach solution and relatively rapid leaching. 

 

AGGLOMERATION AND COMPACTED PERMEABILITY TESTS 
Preliminary agglomeration test work as well as compacted permeability test work was 

conducted on portions of crushed material from each composite. For the test work, the material 

was agglomerated with various additions of cement.  In the preliminary agglomeration testing, 

the agglomerated material was placed in a column with no compressive load and then tested 

for permeability.  In the compaction testing, the agglomerated material was compacted in a 

column with a predetermined static load and then tested for permeability. 

 

The agglomeration and compacted permeability tests showed that under all conditions, flow 

was maintained at close to three orders of magnitude times the typical heap leach solution 

application rates.  This included loads equivalent to 50 m of lift height. 

 

This type of agglomeration test work is very preliminary but does serve to provide an indication 

of whether or not agglomeration will be required for the processing of the material at the tested 

crushed sizes.  All agglomeration tests passed the criteria put forth by KCA.  No agglomeration 

was required for both composite samples in the planned column tests. 

 

Compacted permeability tests were completed in the Phase 1 and Phase 3 KCA programs.  

Compacted permeability tests examine the permeability of the crushed material under 

compaction loading equivalent to overall heap heights of 10 m, 20 m, and 50 m.  KCA has 

developed parameters to predict material performance in a full scale heap leach.  Sample 

slump in the column is measured in the column after pressure is applied to the simulated 

height.  Slump in excess of 10% is generally an indication of failure.  Typical heap leach 

irrigation rates are 0.010 m3/h/m2 to 0.012 m3/h/m2.  Minimum flows under load of 10 times 

these irrigation rates are required for successful heap leach operation. 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 13-15 

All Öksüt samples tested showed maximum slumps of <5%.  Solution flows under all load 

conditions were typically 400 to 600 times the typical irrigation rates.  The visible amounts of 

fines in most Öksüt samples do not interfere with solution flow through the column, even at the 

50 m equivalent loads. 

 

HARDNESS AND COMMUNITION TESTS 
Standard hardness and communition tests were performed on the KCA Phase 1 and 3 

samples.  The tests included: 

 Bond crusher impact work index 

 Bond rod mill work index 

 Bond ball mill work index 

 Bond abrasion index 

 

The data generated from these tests can be used for crusher selection and is indicative of 

potential wear problems in materials handling equipment.  Table 13-14 shows a summary of 

the results.  The Bond ball mill work indices would be categorized as moderate to hard.  Some 

of the higher Bond abrasion indices would be classed as highly abrasive, likely from the high 

silica content.

SAMPLE SELECTION AND REPRESENTATIVENESS 
Figure 13-1 shows the metallurgical drill hole locations of the KCA Phase 1, 2, and 3 programs 

in the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits. 

 

The diamond drill holes selected for the KCA metallurgical test programs were selected to 

spatially represent the Keltepe and Güneytepe deposits.  Intervals from the drill holes were 

selected to provide composite samples that represented both grade ranges and the 

predominant types of mineralization for metallurgical testing.  The samples are considered 

representative of each deposit.

LEACH RECOVERY ANALYSIS 
Results from all of the column tests were analyzed to estimate recovery for process design, 

mine scheduling, and economic analysis.  Analysis of the results showed that recoveries were 

not a function of crush size, so tests from both crush sizes were included.  Results from Keltepe 

samples were analyzed separately from results from Güneytepe samples.  Figure 13-2 shows 

the results of Keltepe column tests, with sample head grade plotted as a function of leach 

residue grades. 

 

FIGURE 13-2   KELTEPE COLUMN TEST HEAD GRADE VS. LEACH RESIDUE 
 

 
 

The Keltepe Deposit contains approximately 90% of the contained gold for the Öksüt Project 

and, as such, only the leach characteristics for Keltepe have been considered here.  

Güneytepe leach characteristics are as good as or better than Keltepe and are therefore 

expected to be consistent with leach characteristics from Keltepe.  A best fit curve was fitted 

to the data.  At the estimated Keltepe average grade of 1.24 g/t Au, the corresponding leach 

residue grade will be 0.23 g/t Au, with a resulting recovery of 81.4%.  For scale-up purposes,

this is discounted by 4% and an ADR efficiency factor of 99% is applied which results in a 

design recovery of 77%. 

 

Leach profiles were plotted to determine leach cycle time.  Leach cycle times for full scale 

heap leach operations is typically measured in tonnes of leach solution applied to tonnes of 

ore under leach.  The full leach cycle is not normally completed with a single continuous 

application of solution.  The cycle is usually broken down into the primary leach cycle where 

solution is directly applied to the ore under leach and a secondary leach cycle where solution 

flows through an area previously leached from a lift above.  Figure 13-3 shows gold recovery 

as a function of solution application for the Keltepe column tests. 

 

FIGURE 13-3   KELTEPE PHASE 1 AND 2 COLUMN LEACH TEST RESULTS 
 

 
 

The fitted curve shows that at a 1:1 solution application rate, gold recovery is 73% or 95.2% of 

ultimate recovery (77%).  Full recovery is achieved between a 3:1 and 4:1 solution application 

rate.  The primary leach cycle includes a solution application rate of 1:1.  The remainder of the

recovery would be obtained during secondary leaching as ore in subsequent lifts above is 

leached.  The design final solution application rate is 3:1. 

 

There is a correlation between the solution application rate and days of leaching, the latter 

derived from the heap lift height (10 m), design cell size for each primary leach cycle (500,000 

t), and the solution irrigation rate of 0.012 m3/h/m2.  The primary leach cycle will be 46 days 

and the ultimate leach cycle will be 140 days (secondary leach will be 99 days). 

 

To the QP's knowledge, there are no processing factors or deleterious elements that could 

have a significant effect on potential economic extraction

2. Mineral Resources are in addition to Mineral Reserves.  Mineral Resources do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. 
3. Mineral Resources are constrained within an optimized pit shell based on a gold price of $1,450 per 

ounce.  
4. Mineral Resources are estimated based on a cut-off grade of 0.2 g/t Au.  
5. Inferred Mineral Resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether 

they can be mined economically.  It cannot be assumed that all or part of the Inferred Mineral Resources 
will ever be upgraded to a higher category.

The resource model update for the Öksüt Project was prepared in May 2015 by Centerra using 

all of the drill holes available as of that date.  ARANZ Leapfrog software was used to update 

the principal mineralized domains at the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits and values for gold 

were interpolated into blocks using OK in GEOVIA GEMS software.   

 

Centerra updated the geological interpretation, and block modelling procedures based on a 

third-party audit and is of the opinion that the Mineral Resource estimates are appropriate for 

the style of mineralization and that the resource models are reasonable and acceptable to 

support the 2015 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.   

 

GEOLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL MODELS 
A detailed geological data compilation was carried out by Centerra geologists to identify major 

geological contacts, mineralization, weathering, and structural features.  These data were used 

to interpret the primary mineralized domains for the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits at the 

Öksüt Project.  Geological logs document rock type, weathering type, alteration type, structural 

features, and geotechnical characteristics. 

 

WEATHERING MODEL 
Using a combination of geological logs, core photos, and the percent of total sulphur (S%), 

Centerra created a simplified weathering model consisting of oxidized and fresh rock.  A small 

number of intervals that had been logged as "partially oxidized" were assigned to the oxidized 

or fresh categories based on their core photos and their S% values.  The oxidized-fresh rock 

surface roughly corresponds to values greater than 1.5% total sulphur, however, there are a 

number of smaller areas where the core photos show complete oxidation despite values >1.5% 

S.  Although, further assay analysis to differentiate between sulphide sulphur and non-sulphide 

sulphur would help resolve the oxidation state in some specific areas, Centerra considers the 

current surface to be acceptable to support the current Mineral Resource. 

 

ROCK TYPE MODEL 
Using a combination of geological logs and core photos, Centerra created a simplified rock 

type model consisting of four main rock types (breccia, andesite, overburden, and landslide).  

A number of intervals logged and modelled as overburden are mineralized with similar tenor

to the underlying andesite.  Visual review of core photos to resolve this issue proved 

inconclusive and Centerra chose to treat both mineralized overburden and mineralized 

andesite as a single unit.  This methodology was also applied to the unmineralized variety of 

each rock type.  

 

MINERALIZATION MODEL 
Mineralization at Öksüt is believed to be related to the contemporaneous emplacement of a 

subvolcanic breccia and a porphyritic andesite.  A 2012 site visit by Dr. Richard Sillitoe 

described gold mineralization as being "preferentially precipitated in the siliceous ledge and its 

immediate quartz-alunite halo," and having been "fed by at least one, and probably several, 

steep structures represented by massive silicification."  

 

Mineralized domains were generated from drill hole intersections with a minimum width of 5 m 

and a cut-off grade of 0.20 g/t Au.  There were a number of instances where lower grade 

intercepts were included at the edges of the wireframe or within larger intercepts in order to 

maintain continuity between drilling fences.  The interpreted upper and lower boundaries of 

the mineralized domains were snapped to drill holes. 

 

There are two main mineralized wireframes that represent the mineralization at Keltepe and 

Güneytepe, respectively (Figure 14-1).

The gold oxide mineralization at Keltepe extends approximately 950 m in the north-

northwesterly direction and approximately 370 m in the east-northeasterly direction and 

extends approximately 300 m below surface.  The mineralization has two general orientations, 

a sub-vertical orientation that corresponds to steep feeder structures and a sub-horizontal 

orientation that corresponds to gold mineralization that was precipitated in the siliceous ledge 

and its immediate quartz-alunite halo.  The sub-horizontal mineralization has a general strike 

direction of 340º and dips between horizontal and -10º towards the southwest.  The sub-vertical 

mineralization has a general strike direction of 340º and plunges between -50º and -75º 

towards the southeast. 

The gold oxide mineralization at Güneytepe lies approximately 300 m to the southwest of 

Keltepe.  The mineralization extends approximately 370 m in the north-northwesterly direction 

and approximately 335 m in the east-northeasterly direction and extends approximately 110 m 

below surface.  Similar to Keltepe, the mineralization at Güneytepe is interpreted as having 

two general orientations, a sub-vertical orientation that corresponding to steep feeder 

structures and a sub-horizontal orientation that corresponds to gold mineralization that was 

precipitated in the siliceous ledge and its immediate quartz-alunite halo.  The sub-horizontal 

mineralization has a general strike direction of 085º and dips between horizontal and -25º 

towards the west.  The sub-vertical mineralization has a general strike direction of 265º and 

dips -75º towards the southeast (Figure 14-2).

ALTERATION MODEL 
The alteration model for the Öksüt deposits is currently being updated based on a re-

interpretation of the alteration logging.  The previous interpretation amalgamated three of the 

main logged alterations into a single alteration wireframe.  Further analysis using logged 

alteration types to flag multi-element ICP assay data suggests that two of the logged alterations 

(quartz-kaolinite and quartz-alunite-kaolinite) have a materially different geochemical 

composition than the third (quartz-alunite).  It is Centerra's intention to develop a new model 

that takes the geochemical composition into consideration. 

 

BULK DENSITY 
A total of 742 samples for bulk density measurements have been collected from drill core from 

the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits.  Samples for bulk density determination were taken from 

the main alteration types and from waste rocks.  The first three batches of samples (137, 99, 

and 119 samples, respectively) were sent to the Rock Mechanics Laboratory of the Mining 

Engineering Department at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.  

The measurements were carried out in accordance with the standards suggested by American 

Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Designation: C914-95 "Standard Test Method for 

Bulk Density and Volume of Solid Refractories by Wax Immersion". 

 

The third batch of samples (202 samples) was sent in 2013 to ALS Chemex in Vancouver, 

Canada, for bulk density determination using the wax immersion method (ALS method OA-

GRA09a).   



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 14-8 

Following the receipt of a number of seemingly spurious values from the ALS measurements, 

200 samples out of 202 were dispatched to SGS Lakefield to check bulk density 

determinations.  The remaining two samples were not repeated as they were broken and 

hence, not useable for bulk density measurement. 

 

In 2014, a total of 185 samples (108 samples from Keltepe and 77 samples from Güneytepe) 

were sent to SGS in Ankara, Turkey for bulk density determination using the wax immersion 

method referred to above.   

 

A batch of the METU sample results was inadvertently omitted from analysis due to a clerical 

error.  Accordingly, Centerra's density study only considers the results of 621 bulk density 

measurements rather than the complete set of 742 samples.  Centerra does not believe that 

the omitted samples will have a material impact on the Mineral Resource estimate, but future 

Mineral Resource updates will make use of the complete dataset. 

 

Centerra's analysis suggests that a statistically supported argument can be made for sub-

division of the density data on the basis of mineralized versus unmineralized material, rock 

type and weathering type.  In line with the weathering model, it appears that elevation has the 

most significant impact on density.  Therefore, Centerra elected to sub-divide the bulk density 

samples on the basis of mineralized versus unmineralized material and rock type and used a 

flat-lying search ellipse to accommodate for increasing density with depth.  Figure 14-3 shows 

the descriptive statistics for each sub-divided population as well as their respective elevation 

vs. bulk density (t/m3) scatter plot.

Since the waste andesite contains numerous samples between 1800 EL and 1850 EL, the 

population was also reviewed after removing these samples to validate the statistical basis for 

sub-dividing the andesite bulk density samples into two separate groups.  Even after removing 

the samples between 1800 EL and 1850 EL from the waste andesite, the population still 

showed a marked difference from the mineralized andesite. 

 

Density values were interpolated into the block model using inverse distance squared (ID2). 

The interpolation used three passes, with progressively more relaxed search requirements. A 

flat-lying, pancake shaped ellipse was used during interpolation to better honour the changes 

in density with depth.  The first pass honours the sub-divisions discussed above while the 

second pass only honours the separation of the mineralized and waste groups but allows for 

interaction between the rock types (soft boundary).  This process allows blocks not populated 

in the first pass because of an insufficient number of samples to have access to more local 

samples.  Centerra observed that the immediate area of the resource estimate was populated 

using the first two passes, so the third pass was used to populate the remaining blocks with 

the ID2 value from all samples contained within a large flat-lying ellipse.  Based on the search 

ellipse orientation and dimensions, some areas of the block model extents were not populated 

during the interpolation passes.  The unpopulated blocks above 1890 EL were assigned a 

density of 2.03 t/m3 while the blocks below elevation 1420 EL were assigned a density of 2.44 

t/m3.  Table 14-3 contains the search ellipse and interpolation parameters used to populate the 

block model with bulk density values.

DATABASE 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The Mineral Resource estimate for Öksüt is based primarily on information from surface 

diamond drill holes and supplemented by surface mapping.  The Öksüt database contains a 

total of 330 collar records totaling 82,006 m of drilling.   

 

A subset of 292 holes was used to update the Öksüt Mineral Resources.  This subset of holes 

covers all exploration drilling on the Öksüt licence areas and includes numerous holes drilled 

beyond the mineralized extents of Keltepe and Güneytepe.  Only 41 holes of the 292 hole 

subset are RC holes and only four of the RC holes are located within the extents of the 

mineralization and used for grade estimation. 

 
The 38 holes not included in the estimate are metallurgical holes, water well holes, or 

geotechnical holes that were not assayed.  Most of the holes at Öksüt are drilled at an inclined 

orientation between -45˚ and -90˚ (vertical).  Drilling at Keltepe covers an approximate area of 

1,250 m (north-northwesterly/south-southeasterly) by 850 m (east-northeasterly/west-

southwesterly), while drilling at Güneytepe covers an approximate area of 450 m 

(northwesterly/southeasterly) by 550 m (northeasterly/southwesterly).  Hole lengths vary 

widely, but they are typically in the range of 125 m to 425 m.  Drill hole spacing on both deposits 

is fairly consistent, generally measuring 50 m across strike by 50 m along strike. 

 

DRILL HOLE DATABASE VALIDATION 
The following is a list of the data validation checks performed on the drill hole database by 

Centerra: 

• Checked for duplicate drill hole collar locations and hole numbers. 
 

• Checked collar locations for zero/extreme values. 
 

• Checked assays for missing intervals, long intervals, extreme high values, blank/zero 
values, reasonable minimum/maximum values, etc. 
 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 14-13 

• Ran validity checks for out-of-range values, missing intervals, overlapping intervals, 
out-of-sequence intervals, etc. 
 

• Carried out visual inspection of drill holes for unusual azimuths, dips, and deviations. 
 

• Digital comparison of gold values from the assay database against gold values from 
certificates.  

 

The Öksüt exploration databases are actively maintained under the supervision of OMAS site 

personnel.  The data provided for the resource estimate was exported directly from these 

databases.  The QP is of the opinion that the database is acceptable for the purposes of 

resource estimation.  The collar, survey, and assay data was imported into GEMS software for 

the purposes of resource estimation and no material errors were found during the import 

process. 

 

ASSAY STATISTICS 
Of the 292 drill holes within the Öksüt subset, 170 drill holes intersect the mineralization 

wireframes.  The mineralization wireframes were used to flag drill hole intervals in the database 

that lie inside the wireframes.  The assay statistics for each mineralized domain are presented 

in Table 14-4.

ASSAY CAPPING STATISTICS 
The Öksüt assays for gold are positively skewed.  In positively skewed statistical distributions, 

high outlier assay values can have a disproportionate effect on average values, which can 

result in a positive bias to the grade estimate.  Centerra has capped high outlier assay values 

to minimize the potential for a positive grade bias.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 14-14 

A combination of histograms, decile analysis, probability plots, and the visual inspection of 

higher grade assays were used to determine the capping levels for Keltepe and Güneytepe.  

Both deposits were evaluated independently, and coincidentally, both were capped at 13 g/t 

Au (Figures 14-4 to 14-7).  All assays were capped prior to compositing.

In general, it can be seen that the application of capping has not had a significant effect on the 

assay average or coefficient of variation.   

 

COMPOSITE STATISTICS 
Sample intervals varied from 15 cm to 6.0 m, with 76% of the samples measuring 1.0 m in 

length and 17% of the samples measuring from 1.0 m to 2.0 m in length.  Only 1% of samples 

measured more than 2.0 m in length.  Centerra elected to composite assays to 5.0 m lengths 

in order to mitigate the impact of splitting some higher grade samples with lengths greater than 

2.0 m.  Future estimates will consider the impact associated with using different composite 

lengths, such as 2.0 m or 2.5 m composites.  After capping was applied to the raw assay data, 

assays were composited to 5.0 m within each mineralized wireframe domain.  Samples were 

composited in downhole intervals of 5.0 m, starting at the wireframe pierce-point for each 

domain, continuing to the point at which the hole exited the domain.  Any unsampled intervals 

that fell within either domain were assigned a value of zero.   

 

Compositing to 5.0 m intervals occasionally resulted in the last composite in the mineralized 

domain being less than 5.0 m.  For the composites less than 5.0 m, Centerra examined the 

grade distributions, including mean grades, of composites greater than and less than 2.5 m 

and concluded that removing these samples would noticeably increase the average composite 

grade.  The zoned nature of the mineralization at Öksüt shows a gradual decrease in grade 

moving away from the higher grade feeders and massive silicification.  Accordingly, the 

majority of holes that intersect the wireframes exit the wireframes in local areas where the 

grade of mineralization is below the average grade of the deposit.  This, in turn, results in a 

population of partial composites with markedly lower grades than the full length composite 

population.  Centerra has included all partial composites in the estimate to allow for more data 

at the margins of the mineralization. 

 

Table 14-6 summarizes statistics of the composite grades.

BLOCK MODEL 

DIMENSIONS AND CODING  
A block model framework was created in GEOVIA GEMS software for the Öksüt Mineral 

Resource update using a block size of 10 m by 10 m by 5 m.  The block model was rotated to 

align with the southeast-northwest trend of the mineralized domains.  The block model extents 

for the "ÖksütMay2015" model are given in Table 14-7.

mineralized wireframe domain.  This method of block coding results in a "whole block model" 

that does not maintain a percent attribute.  The volumes of the mineralized domains in the 

block model were compared to the volumes from the mineralization wireframes and were within 

±0.5%.  The relevant attributes used in the block model are given in Table 14-8 with a list of 

the codes used for each attribute given in Table 14-9.  Keltepe and Güneytepe each have two

VARIOGRAPHY AND TREND ANALYSIS 
Variograms for gold were developed in GEOVIA GEMS software using the 5 m composites, 

flagged by their respective sub-vertical and sub-horizontal domains.  Grade shells were 

generated in Leapfrog at a variety of cut-off grades to evaluate grade trends. 

 

Linear downhole variograms were created to establish the nugget component of the variogram 

model for each of the four domains (500, 501, 600, and 601).  The modelled variograms 

showed nugget values ranging between zero and 10% of the total sill and ranges between 10 

m and 20 m.  Based on experience, Centerra used a nugget component of 20% of the total sill 

for the variogram model used for estimation. 

 

At Keltepe, the sub-horizontal (Domain: 500) mineralization appears to be spatially more 

continuous than the sub-vertical (Domain: 501), however, visual inspection indicates that parts 

of Domain 500 may be more related to the sub-vertical component of the mineralization.  

Hence, for Keltepe, the composites used for variography were further filtered to reflect this 

observation.   

 

Higher grade composites (above 0.75 g/t Au) were re-flagged with codes 5000 and 5010 to 

reflect the behaviour of the horizontal and vertical components, respectively, and this data was 

subjected to variographic analysis.  Horizontal trend variograms for high grade Domain 5000 

show maximum continuity between 310º and 330º and ranges between 100 m and 160 m 

(Figure 14-8).  The orientation of 320º showed a range of 115 m as well as good continuity 

across strike (050º) with a range of 100 m (Figure 14-9).   

 

Generally, the best variograms for the sub-vertical high grade trend (Domain 5010) are aligned 

with the plunge direction of the mineralization.  The orientation of 160º dipping -40º showed a 

range of 80 m (Figure 14-10).

Güneytepe variography used sub-horizontal (Domain: 600) and sub-vertical (Domain: 601) 

coded composites.  Horizontal trend variograms for Domain 600 show maximum continuity 

between 075º and 085º and ranges between 60 m and 85 m (Figure 14-11).  The orientation 

of 080º showed a range of 85 m as well as good continuity across strike (170°) with a range 

of 70 m (Figure 14-12).   

 

Generally, the best variograms for the sub-vertical trend (Domain 601) are aligned with the 

plunge direction of the mineralization.  The orientation of 075º dipping -80º showed a range of 

115 m (Figure 14-13).

Based on experience, Centerra adjusted the search orientations to best fit the shape of the 

observed mineralization trends.  Centerra is of the opinion that the search ranges obtained 

from the variogram analysis provide sufficient support for the search ellipse dimensions used 

for the estimation of Mineral Resources.  

 

GRADE INTERPOLATION 
Estimation of gold grades was carried out using ordinary kriging (OK) constrained within the 

mineralized domain wireframes.  Two passes with increasingly longer search axes were 

carried out to ensure that all blocks within the mineralized domain wireframes were assigned 

a grade and to assist with resource classification.  The estimation parameters and ellipse 

orientations used are summarized in Table 14-10.  The subdivided areas of the high grade 

wireframes were treated as soft boundaries during the interpolation. In future resource 

updates, Centerra intends to perform a contact plot analysis to assess the need for soft, semi-

soft, or hard estimation boundaries for high grade and low grade material.

The ellipsoid orientations for all mineralized domains were fixed to reflect the variography as 

well as the dominant azimuth and dip for each domain or sector.  Figures 14-14 and 14-15

 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 14-31 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
Based on the parameters outlined in Table 14-11 as well as other considerations, Centerra 

has reported the Öksüt Mineral Resources at a cut-off grade of 0.20 g/t Au.  Only those blocks 

contained within the preliminary pit shell are reported as a Mineral Resource. 
 

PIT OPTIMIZATION 
In order to comply with the CIM definitions of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic 

extraction", a preliminary Lerchs-Grossmann pit shell was prepared using GEOVIA Whittle 

software and the assumed costs and parameters as shown in Table 14-11.  Only those blocks 

contained within the preliminary pit shell are reported as Mineral Resources.

OPEN PIT CLASSIFICATION 
Centerra developed resource classification criteria based on geological continuity, grade 

continuity, distance of a block to the nearest composite, and distance of a block from the 

oxide/sulphide surface.  Shapes created based on these criteria were used to assign the 

respective Measured, Indicated, and Inferred classifications.    

Figures 14-18 and 14-19 provide examples of vertical cross-sections showing the open pit 

classification block models.

BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
The mineralization wireframes were checked for overlaps and blocks were checked to ensure 

consistent rock type coding between the wireframes, composites, and blocks.  The mineralized 

domains were reviewed to confirm that extensions beyond last holes were reasonable and 

consistent.   

 

Global statistics were tabulated for the assays, composites, and blocks for each domain at 

Öksüt and are summarized in Table 14-12.  The assay, composite and block statistics compare 

fairly well for Keltepe, but there is a noticeable drop in grade between the composites and 

blocks at Güneytepe.  This drop in grade is caused by the declustering of higher grade 

composites in the upper portion of Güneytepe when estimating using OK.

The block model grades were visually compared with composite grades on plan and section 

views.  The model was also visually checked for grade banding, smearing of high grades, 

plumes of high grades, on sections and plans.  This evaluation indicated an acceptable spatial 

correlation of block grades with composite grades.

Centerra also prepared a grade and tonnage curve to evaluate the impact of different cut-off 

grades on the reported resources (Figures 14-20 and 14-21).

Swath plots were prepared to evaluate and compare trends in composite and block grades 

throughout the Öksüt Project.  These plots were compiled on 50 m swaths at Keltepe and 30 

m swaths at Güneytepe to correspond with the spacing of drilling fences through each deposit 

(southeast/northwest).  In Centerra's opinion, the plots at both Keltepe and Güneytepe show 

a good comparison between the blocks and the composites, particularly in portions of the 

deposit with the greatest drilling density (Figures 14-22 and 14-23).  Again, there is noticeable 

difference between the composite grades and block grades at Güneytepe between sections 

GT 180 and GT 240.  This drop in block grades is caused by the declustering of higher grade 

composites in the upper portion of Güneytepe when estimating using OK.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
DEFINITION 
Mineral Reserves are that part of the Mineral Resource that can be legally, safely, and 

profitably mined given a specific set of technical and economic parameters.  These include the 

gold price, mine, mill, and administrative operating costs, metallurgical recovery, geotechnical 

behaviour of the rocks in the future pit walls, and equipment size parameters.  Computer 

software "optimizes" the pit shape by interrogating each block of the block model as to its ability 

to pay for its removal plus the incremental tonnage of waste that must be removed to mine the 

block.  Detailed mine planning using commercial software then creates a number of intermittent 

pit designs that test the ability to access sufficient ore to provide adequate mill feed while 

postponing waste mining as long as possible.  This process results in the creation of one or 

more "pit shells" which recover the economic part of the Mineral Resources and which are then 

engineered in detail by adding ramps for mining access and by smoothing of the pit walls. 

 

For the Öksüt Project, Mineral Reserves are the "economically mineable part of a Measured 

and/or Indicated Mineral Resource" as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 

and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves 

adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. 

 

OPEN PIT MINING 
The Öksüt Project is planned as a conventional truck and shovel open pit mine.  Material will 

be drilled and blasted, before being loaded and hauled to the waste dump, crusher, or the 

various ore stockpiles depending on the most profitable way to process the material.  At the 

Öksüt Project, two pits have been planned to be mined simultaneously, the main Keltepe pit 

and the small satellite Güneytepe pit. 

 

OPTIMIZATION 
Pit optimization was carried out using GEOVIA's Whittle v4.5 software on the ÖksütMay2015 

block model.  Input parameters were developed based on preliminary cost estimations, and 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 15-2 

nested shells were developed reflecting optimal pits at different gold prices.  In all cases, only 

resources that were considered to be oxide and were classified as either Measured or 

Indicated were included in the optimization. 

 

Table 15-1 summarizes the parameters used for the final pit optimization.

OPERATING COSTS 
For optimization purposes, process and general and administrative (G&A) costs were 

developed from first principles, while the mining cost was based on a contractor mining quote 

and an estimate of additional owner's costs that will be incurred. 

 

ROYALTIES 
The royalties applied to the Öksüt mine operations are a Turkish Government State royalty, a 

NSR royalty payable to Stratex Gold, and a NSR royalty to Teck each of which are described 

in Section 4.   
 

Preliminary work suggested that gold production would be slightly less than one million ounces.  

This results in the average royalty rate being 0.6% payable to Teck, 1% NSR payable to Stratex 

Gold, and 4% payable to the Turkish Government assuming a $1,250/oz price of gold.  



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 15-3 

However, Centerra plans to refine the doré from Öksüt using a refinery in Turkey, which would 

reduce the government royalty by 50% to 2%.  The overall royalty rate that was used in the 

final pit optimization was 3.6%. 

 

METALLURGICAL RECOVERY 
Based on current metallurgical test work results, a flat recovery rate of 77% has been used for 

all oxide material in the pit optimization. 

 

DILUTION AND MINING LOSSES 
No external dilution or mining losses have been applied.  The Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits 

are very continuous and the cut-off grade is low.  It is expected that with the small mining fleet 

chosen, and due to the nature of the deposits and the cut-off grade, the deposits can be mined 

selectively with minimal ore losses and dilution experienced.  The leach pad is designed with 

additional capacity than is required for the Mineral Reserves, so the main impact from 

unplanned dilution will be the additional costs to process the material.  As ore mining starts, 

this assumption should be monitored for validity and adjusted if required.  Figure 15-1 shows 

the continuity of the ore body in the Keltepe pit.  Only blocks above the cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 

Au are shown.

SLOPE ANGLES 
After a first pass of pit optimization using estimated overall slopes described in Section 16, 

overall slope angles were re-measured to improve the estimate of the impact of the ramp 

system on overall slope angles.  These slopes were then used in the final pit optimization and 

are shown in Table 15-2 for the Keltepe pit.  Overall slopes of 40º were used in the Güneytepe 

optimization.

RESULTS AND SHELL SELECTION 
Optimization was completed for the Keltepe and Güneytepe pits separately from each other to 

ensure that each selected pit shell is the optimal one.  Shell selection was made at the point 

where the operating cash flow curve flattens and the incremental material does not contribute 

significantly to an overall increase in operating cash flow of the Project.  Figure 15-2 shows 

the results of the optimization for Keltepe.  Shell 24 was selected as the optimal shell.

FIGURE 15-3   GÜNEYTEPE PIT OPTIMIZATION RESULTS USING A $1,250/OZ 
GOLD PRICE 

 
 

 
 

Figures 15-2 and 15-3 both show a relatively flat cash flow curve beyond the chosen pit shells.  

This shows that, at a gold price of $1,250/ounce, expanding the pits would result in a minimal 

increase to operating cash flow.  By choosing a smaller pit that still captures most of the cash 

flow, the discounted value of the Project can be increased significantly.  

 

MINE DESIGN 
Mining will be done utilizing conventional truck and shovel method, with rock material blasted 

five times every week.  At Keltepe, the open pit will be accessed directly from the haulage road 

for the upper benches above 1,740 m elevation with the in-pit road constructed for the lower 

benches.  At Güneytepe, all material will be hauled over to join the haul road near the Keltepe 

pit entrance.  The in-pit road width will be 15 m, which is acceptable for 36 tonne trucks running

on a two-lane road.  Road gradient will be 10%.  At the bottom of the pit, the road will be 

converted to a 10 m wide single-lane road. 

 

Single bench height will be 5 m and double-benching is proposed, which brings the overall 

height of the final bench to 10 m. Batter angle of the bench slope is 63º.  No access to the 

berms is envisaged in this design.  Respective inter-ramp and overall angle constraints are 

implemented for the corresponding sectors of the walls based on the geotechnical slope design 

table.  Minimal mining width of 30 m was targeted during cut-back design.  Mining widths are 

mostly 50 m or more, but in some places the mining widths narrow to 30 m. 

 

Table 15-3 shows a comparison between Shell 24 and the pit design for Keltepe.  The pit 

design captures 98% of the gold ounces in the shell while mining 94% of the overall tonnes.  

This is considered acceptable for moving from a pit shell to a design.

A comparison between Shell 19 and the pit design for Güneytepe is shown in Table 15-4.  Due 

to the small size of the Güneytepe pit, additional waste material had to be included in the 

design in order to maintain minimum working widths.  Due to the low strip ratio, this increased 

the waste tonnes by over 50%, however, this is only an additional 800 kt, which is considered 

to be acceptable.

CUT-OFF GRADE CALCULATION 
The cut-off grade for the Öksüt Mineral Reserves was calculated using the same inputs as 

those used for the pit optimization.  This calculation is summarized in Table 15-5.  Based on 

this, a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au was chosen for the Öksüt Mineral Reserves. 

 

TABLE 15-5   CUT-OFF GRADE CALCULATION 
 

Parameter Value 

Gold Price ($/oz) 1,250 

Processing and G&A cost ($/t) 8.16 

Recovery (%) 77 

Royalty to Turkish Government (%) 2.0 

Royalty to Teck (%) 0.6 

Royalty to Stratex (%) 1.0 

Refining Cost ($/oz) 5.00 

Cut-off grade (g/t Au) 0.3 

 

Due to the high grade nature of the deposit in comparison to the cut-off grade, small changes 

to the cut-off grade do not have a significant effect on the Mineral Reserves.  Increasing the 

cut-off grade from 0.3 g/t Au to 0.4 g/t Au decreases the ore tonnage by 4% and the contained

gold by only 1%.  Decreasing the cut-off grade from 0.3 g/t Au to 0.2 g/t Au only adds 1% more 

to the ore tonnes and a negligible amount to the contained gold. 

 

MINERAL RESERVES 
Table 15-6 summarizes the Mineral Reserves at a 0.3 g/t Au cut-off grade for the Keltepe and 

Güneytepe pits.  All oxide resources classified as either Measured or Indicated inside the 

reserve pits have been classified as Probable Mineral Reserves.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for classification of Mineral Reserves. 
2. Mineral Reserves have been estimated based on a gold price of $1,250/oz. 
3. Mineral Reserves are estimated based on a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au. 
4. A conversion factor of 31.10348 grams per ounce of gold is used in the reserves estimates. 
5. Numbers may not add up due to rounding. 

 

In the QP's opinion, except as set out in this Technical Report, there are no risks known at this 

time that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimate.

16 MINING METHODS 
The Öksüt Project is planned as a conventional truck and shovel open pit mine.  Material will 

be drilled and blasted, before being loaded and hauled to the waste dump, crusher, or the 

various ore stockpiles depending on the most profitable way to process the material.  At the 

Öksüt Project, two pits have been planned to be mined simultaneously, the main Keltepe pit 

and the small satellite Güneytepe pit. 

GEOTECHNICAL PIT DESIGNS 

SLOPE DESIGN 
A comprehensive geotechnical field investigation program was carried out by Golder 

Associates (Golder, 2014d).  The program was based upon eight geotechnical drill holes drilled 

into the main walls of the proposed Keltepe and Güneytepe final pits (Figure 16-1).  The drill 

holes were logged and mapped according to accepted geotechnical standards with oriented 

core measurements taken using a Reflex ACT II tool as well as the Spear method.  The 

majority of the hole measurements were taken using the ACT tool.  Table 16-1 shows the tests 

that have been completed: 

TABLE 16-1   SUMMARY OF THE TESTS COMPLETED DURING FIELD 
INVESTIGATION PROGRAM 

Test Type Number of Tests Completed 

Uniaxial Compressive Strength 24 

Indirect Tensile Strength 25 

Triaxial Compressive Strength 25 

Direct Shear Strength – Rock discontinuities 10 

Direct Shear Strength – Fault gauge 6 

Soil classification – Fault gauge 6 

This field investigation program formed the basis for the slope stability calculation report 

(Centerra, 2015) that was developed by Centerra's technical team, and was reviewed by an 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 16-2 

external consultant.  Two open pits are planned at the Öksüt site with Keltepe being the main 

pit and Güneytepe, the smaller pit located to the south of the Keltepe pit. 

 

Structural geology at the Öksüt site is characterized by a series of joints dipping at moderate 

to shallow angles towards the W-SW.  There is a second joint system determined from the 

geotechnical drill holes that dips at shallow angles towards the N-NE and will be controlling 

stability of the S-SW wall.  Rock mass properties were defined by means of geotechnical drill 

holes and indicate Fair to Poor rock mass conditions.  The rock mass is broken up and 

significant faulting/shearing of the rock mass is registered.  The major fault structures, while 

difficult to map in the drill holes, have been identified as steeply dipping structures dipping 

towards the W-SW and sub-parallel to the major high wall of the Keltepe open pit.  It was 

determined by drilling that the high wall of the Güneytepe pit will be controlled by the shear 

zones of the same orientation (W-SW).

Every other wall of both the Keltepe and Güneytepe pits will be controlled by sub-horizontal 

(or shallow dipping) joint sets forming the basal planes combined with the rock mass. 

 

No water was used for the base-case stability calculations as the rock mass is heavily fractured 

and it is expected that water, if any, will be easily drained by exposed open pits or drill holes.  

Also, given the current level of understanding of the hydrogeology model as described later in 

this section of this report the assumption of the "dry" state of the walls is deemed appropriate.  

Sensitivity to different water tables has been provided for the highest wall of the Keltepe pit 

Table 16-2. 

 

TABLE 16-2   WALL STABILITY SENSITIVITY ASSESSMENT WITH RESPECT 
TO VARIOUS WATER TABLE SCENARIOS 

 
Water Table Assumption Factor of Safety 

Dry 1.2 

Low 1.2 

Medium 1.0 

High 0.7 
 

All the work done to date by SRK Consulting Ankara (SRK) has indicated a dry or very low 

water table behind the ultimate wall.  Given that even a "Medium Water Table" assumes a 

relatively high level of water saturation, it is considered unlikely that the wall will deform due to 

water related issues.  It is still advised that the hydrogeological assumptions be confirmed or 

revisited after mining commences.  In case there are material changes to the water table 

assumptions, the slope stability analyses should be updated.  The pit slope configuration is 

indicated in Table 16-3.  The current pit designs do not make allowances for shallower slopes 

in the colluvium or highly weathered rock near surface.  As mining starts, small adjustments 

will have to be made to the pit crests depending on the actual depth of this material.  It is not 

expected that this will have a material impact on the Project.

The bench height for both pits will be 5 m, with double benching being employed so that there 

is 10 m between each safety berm.  The bench face angles have been estimated to be 63º.  

Presplitting will be required in order to reduce damage to the pit walls.  The bench widths will 

be varied in order to achieve the desired inter-ramp angle in each pit sector.  These are shown 

in Table 16-4.

SRK has completed a draft hydrological investigation report (SRK Consulting Ankara, 2014d) 

based on the comprehensive hydrogeological field investigation program that comprised 

drilling and installing of 30 piezometers/monitoring wells, 10 slug tests, and eight pumping tests

Current findings suggest that during mining the pit walls are expected to be completely dry for 

Keltepe and Güneytepe pits as their bottoms are designed at 1,585 masl and 1,600 masl, 

respectively.   

 

WASTE DUMP DESIGN 
The waste dump is expected to be located in the Eastern Valley from the proposed Keltepe pit 

and is secluded from the nearby villages (Figure 16-7).  Such a location is thought to be the 

best available option from an environmental and social standpoint, although at a detriment of 

longer haulage distance from the pit's rims.  Stability calculations were performed by 

Centerra's technical personnel (Centerra, 2014b), and were reviewed by an external 

consultant.  They determined that the proposed waste dump configuration results in a stable 

facility for the duration of mine operations.  A better understanding of the underlying hydrology 

and relatively deep-seated water table allowed designing a stable waste rock dump using a 

top-down dumping approach without a liner.   

 

Dumping will be done using a top-down approach as the intermediate faces of the dump are 

expected to be stable, although at a marginal factor of safety in some parts during its 

development.  Short-term deformations may happen during these periods, which are 

considered acceptable.  As the waste dump development progresses, the dump stability will 

improve as subsequent dumping is performed on a shallow foundation.  Although further 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 16-8 

investigation is required, the minimum factor of safety (FOS) for the ultimate waste dump is 

considered acceptable.  Additional field data should be collected, tested, and incorporated into 

the waste dump model, and the dump design should be adjusted as required.  

 

Appropriate monitoring will be done using prisms and identifying accelerations of the dump.  If 

any acceleration is defined in a particular section of the waste dump, it will be closed off and 

dumping will not be allowed until an acceptable decrease in the movement rate is observed. 

 

MINE PLANNING 

CUTBACK STRATEGY 
The Öksüt Project will be a conventional truck and excavator mining operation.  The deposit 

has been separated into three cutbacks for the Keltepe pit and one cutback for the Güneytepe 

pit.  This has been done in order to decrease stripping requirements during start-up of 

operations, bring higher grade forward by targeting high grade ore in the Keltepe pit, and 

reduce geotechnical risks.  

 

Keltepe Cutbacks 1 and 2 provide significantly higher grade ore, as well as reducing the 

stripping requirements when compared to Keltepe Cutback 3.  The Güneytepe pit has the 

lowest strip ratio of all cutbacks, but the ore is lower grade than the first two cutbacks in 

Keltepe.  Table 16-6 summarizes the physicals of all cutbacks.

Figure 16-3 shows that the first two cutbacks in the Keltepe pit are significantly higher grade 

than either the final cutback of the Keltepe pit or the Güneytepe pit.  

 

FIGURE 16-3   CUTBACK SUMMARY 
 

 
 

Figure 16-4 shows the three Keltepe cutbacks.  Each one involves a single spiral ramp down 

to the bottom.  The ramps have been designed to exit the pit near the lowest point to reduce 

uphill hauls.

Figure 16-5 is a cross-section of the Keltepe pit showing the three cutbacks as well as the 

resource blocks.  The first two cutbacks will complete mining of the higher grade, shallow ore.  

The final cutback requires more stripping to reach the deeper, lower grade portion of the ore 

body.  This strategy increases the production in the first four years of processing significantly, 

accelerating the payback of the Project. 

 

Figure 16-6 shows the Güneytepe pit design.  It will be mined in a single cutback.

HAUL ROAD 
The haul road represents an important part of mine infrastructure and will serve as the key 

element for delivering ore and waste materials to their respective destinations.  The haul road 

was designed to be at least 100 m away from the fence line of the property to allow for some 

additional flexibility in the detailed stages of the designs for allocation of service roads, 

dewatering ditches and other infrastructure, if necessary.  The haul road width is 25 m.  A 15 

m wide segment is for the haul trucks, with a separate 10 m wide segment of the road for light 

vehicles and other traffic.  The haul road was mainly designed at a 10% gradient and divided 

into several segments, which may be constructed in parallel: 

• Keltepe pit entrance – Waste Dump entrance. This segment is designed at +10% 
gradient and is located on steep terrain. This road segment will be constructed first in 
the sequence, as mining cannot start until access from the pits to the waste dump is 
available. 
 

• Waste Dump entrance – start of the Heap Leach Pad. This segment is designed at 
neutral/shallow gradients leading to the various infrastructure facilities of the Project, 
such as stockpiles, truck shop, fuel farm administration building, crusher and heap 
leach facility. This segment will be constructed second in the sequence, as stripping 
activities can start prior to its completion. Earlier completion of this road may allow 
waste rock from the pits to be used in the construction of the heap leach facility, 
reducing the cost of earthworks. 
 

• Upper Güneytepe road. This road segment is designed at 10% gradient and dissects 
the Güneytepe open pit providing access to the upper benches of the pit down to an 
elevation of 1,645 masl where the pit entrance is designed. This must be completed in 
order to begin mining at Güneytepe. 
 

• Güneytepe entrance – Keltepe entrance. This segment is designed at +10% gradient 
and connects the Güneytepe pit with the main haul road. This also must be completed 
in order to begin mining at the Güneytepe pit. 

 

Road construction will represent both cut and fill in a balanced manner where need for 

additional material will be eliminated.  Table 16-7 summarizes construction requirements for 

the road segments.

It was assumed that the cut material can be used for the road construction as a sub-base 

material with some gravel material forming the base for the road.  Figure 16-7 shows the final 

pit and waste dump designs, along with the haul road.

IN-PIT RAMP 
In-pit ramp width is 15 m for the two-lane access, which is between 3.2 and 3.6 times wider 

than the operational width of a 36 tonne truck, which is indicative of the likely equipment to be 

used at Öksüt.  This will allow enough width for an internal drainage ditch, a safety berm on 

the edge of the road, and two running lanes.  At the bottom of the pits the ramp width is reduced 

to 10 m to improve ore recovery.  These roads will be reduced to single lane traffic only. 

 

STOCKPILE STRATEGY 
In order to increase production early on in the mine life, lower grade ore is stockpiled while 

higher grade ore is crushed and placed on the pad.  Ore will be categorized as Low Grade (0.3 

g/t to 0.6 g/t Au), Medium Grade (0.6 g/t to 1.0 g/t Au), High Grade (1.0 g/t to 1.5 g/t Au), and 

Direct Feed (1.5+ g/t Au).  Nearly all direct feed material will be processed without stockpiling, 

although there will need to be some short term stockpiling when mining in the highest grade 

areas of the pits.  Three stockpile locations have been designed for the rest of the material.  

One is for top soil that will be stripped and stockpiled, then used for reclamation purposes.  

The other two are ore stockpiles.  The medium and high grade stockpiles will be in the same 

location.  The low grade stockpile will be used only when there is not enough high grade ore 

to fill the crusher.  The rest will be processed at the end of the mine life.  The capacities of the 

designed stockpiles are shown in Table 16-8.

MINE SCHEDULE 
The cutback designs, block model, haul road designs, and locations for the stockpiles and 

waste dumps were all brought into RPM's OPMS v.1.2 software.  This was then used for mine 

scheduling.  



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 16-18 

The following constraints were imposed on the schedule: 

• Mining starts in mid-2016 after the road from the pit to the waste dump is constructed. 
 

• Ore placement capacity of 335 kt per month was assigned to the heap leach pad. 
 

• Mining production rate ramp-up was defined such that in months 1 and 2 the mine will 
operate at 50% of its designed capacity, months 3 and 4 the mine will operate at 75% 
of its designed capacity until it reaches full capacity in month 5. 
 

• Constraints were placed on the number of excavators permitted in each cutback, safe 
working areas for each excavator, and vertical advance rates depending on the cutback 
geometry. 
 

• A stockpile optimizer was used during the scheduling process.  Given that other 
constraints have been honoured, the schedule maximizes the ounce extraction profile 
by processing the highest grade stockpiles available. 

 

Table 16-9 and Figure 16-8 show the life-of-mine (LOM) mining schedule.  Mining begins in 

mid-2016, with some ore being mined and stockpiled that year, and the final ore being mined 

in 2023.  Table 16-10 and Figure 16-9 show the LOM processing schedule.  Crushing begins 

in 2017 with full production processing operations commencing in Q2 2017.  Ore stacking is 

completed in 2023 while some gold production extends into 2024 as leaching continues.  

Figure 16-10 shows the annual stockpile balance.

FIGURE 16-10   ANNUAL STOCKPILE BALANCE 
 

 
 

Figure 16-11 shows the material mined by cutback.  In 2016, waste stripping of the Keltepe pit 

begins in cutbacks 1 and 2.  Due to the low strip ratio of the Güneytepe pit, it is mined to begin 

stockpiling ore for processing in 2017.  Because of the small size of the Güneytepe pit, it is 

planned to be mined utilizing only one excavator and is not completed until 2019.  As Keltepe 

Cutback 1 is nearing completion, stripping of Keltepe Cutback 3 begins.  By 2020 this will be 

the primary mining area for the rest of the mine life.  This sequence was designed to take 

advantage of the lower strip ratio, higher grade cutbacks first, helping to increase production 

in the first four years of the mine life and delaying waste stripping.

FIGURE 16-11   MATERIAL MINED BY CUTBACK 
 

 
 

MINING CONTRACTOR AND EXPECTED EQUIPMENT 
After discussions with mining contractors in Turkey, it was determined that contract mining 

would be used at the Öksüt Project.  It was determined that a fleet of 3.8 m3 excavators and 

36 t trucks would work well at Öksüt, which is a common size of equipment in Turkey.  The 

mining contractor will be responsible for all activities associated with mining including drill and 

blast, loading, hauling, and road and dump maintenance.  They will also be responsible for 

supervision of their own personnel.  All mine planning, surveying, and ore control activities will 

be the responsibility of Centerra.  The rate paid to the contractor will be based on a $/m3 mined 

rate agreed upon by the parties.  The contractor will be supplied with the mine plan and it will 

be their responsibility to estimate and supply the equipment required to meet the plan.  

Equipment fleet estimates were done to ensure the mine plan would be achievable with this 

size of fleet without excessive congestion in the pit.  Table 16-11 shows the availability, 

utilization, and efficiency assumptions for the production fleet, as well as the peak number of 

estimated equipment units.  Along with this fleet the contractor will need to supply support 

equipment in the form of bulldozers, graders, explosives trucks, and light vehicles.

DRILL AND BLAST 
The drill and blast design has been developed by BBA Consulting (BBA Consulting, 2014), 

where several options were evaluated.  The final design parameters are shown in Table 16-

12.  Figure 16-12 shows a schematic of a typical blast.  Pre-splitting will be done on 10 m 

double benches to reduce damage to the walls.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
SUMMARY 
The flowsheet for the Öksüt Project was derived from metallurgical test work primarily 

performed by KCA.  The test work results and interpretation are described in Section 13.  The 

flowsheet is based on an 11,000 tpd heap leach operation.  It includes primary crushing, 

screening and secondary crushing, heap stacking and cyanide leaching, carbon adsorption, 

carbon stripping and regeneration, electrowinning, and refining.  The concepts and data 

presented in this section are taken from the Process Flowsheets and Process Design Criteria 

developed for the Project.  The simplified process flowsheet is presented in Figure 17-1.

ORE PROCESSING 

PRIMARY CRUSHING 
Run-of-mine ore will be delivered by 36-tonne haul trucks to the primary crusher.  The ore will 

be dumped on the stationary grizzly installed over the 80-tonne truck dump hopper.  Oversize 

rocks will be handled by a rock breaker.  The ore will be withdrawn from the dump hopper via 

a 2.0 m wide x 4.0 m long grizzly feeder.  The grizzly oversize will feed the 1.6 m x 2.0 m jaw 

crusher that will reduce the rock size to minus 150 mm prior to being conveyed by a 1.4 m 

wide x 95.5 m long belt conveyor to the secondary crushing circuit, along with the grizzly feeder 

undersize.  A self-cleaning belt magnet will be installed over the conveyor belt feeding the 

secondary crusher building.  A metal detector installed after the belt magnet will identify any 

remaining piece of metal and the conveyor will be stopped to allow manual removal by an 

operator. 

 

SECONDARY CRUSHING 
The product from the primary crushing circuit will feed a 2.4 m wide x 6.1 m long double-deck 

screen.  The screen oversize will feed a 600 kW cone crusher while the screen undersize will 

report with the cone crusher product and will be transported by a 1.1 m wide x 50.7 m long belt 

conveyor to a radial stacker after quicklime has been added to the crushing circuit product.  A 

10,000 t capacity stockpile will be formed by the 1.1 mm wide x 39 m long stacker installation. 

 

Dust collection units will be provided at the crusher discharge and transfer points in both 

crushing buildings and a dry fog system will be installed at the truck dump.  If required, 

additional dust control measures could be implemented.  A compressor will provide 

compressed air for process and instrumentation applications. 

 

Key crushing circuit design criteria are presented in Table 17-1.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-5 

HEAP LEACHING 
The heap will be irrigated with a diluted cyanide solution recirculated from the gold recovery 

circuit, via a network of piping covering the surface area under leach.  The barren leach solution 

will be pumped from the barren tank at the ADR plant to the heap.  The cyanide concentration 

will be adjusted and the pH will be controlled so that HCN gas formation is inhibited.  The 

solution will be filtered to remove carbon fines prior to distribution over the heap to minimize 

emitter plugging.  The solution will be pumped by means of two centrifugal pumps installed in 

series.  The first pump will cover operation for the first three years of operation (end of phase 

1) while the second pump will be required from year four and beyond. 

 

The irrigation distribution piping will consist of a 300 mm diameter main header made of carbon 

steel from the barren pumps discharge to the heap perimeter followed by a high-density 

polyethylene (HDPE) header ending at the ore panels to be irrigated.  Drip emitters will be 

used to provide irrigation.  A typical panel piping arrangement will include a 300 mm diameter 

HDPE header starting from the main header and running for 190 m along the 250 m side of 

the panel.  It is proposed to use two lengths of 300 mm diameter HDPE header in rotation for 

irrigation, one in operation and the other one available for installation on the next section to be 

irrigated. Four lateral pipes spaced at every 62.5 m will be branched from the header.  Each 

lateral pipe will include a 150 mm butterfly valve, a pressure gauge and 75 m of 150 mm 

diameter HDPE pipe followed by 75 m of 100 mm diameter HDPE pipe.  Emitter lines will be 

branched at every 500 mm on the pipes and emitters will be spaced at every 762 mm on the 

emitter lines. 

 

Key heap leaching design criteria are presented in Table 17-3.

The pregnant leach solution (PLS) will flow by gravity through a network of collection pipes at 

the base of the heap to the PLS pond prior to being pumped to the ADR plant for precious 

metals recovery. 

 

ADSORPTION 
The PLS will be reclaimed from the pregnant solution pond by a submersible pump at a rate 

varying between 300 and 500 m3/h.  The PLS flow rate is dependent on the footprint 

development of the heap and on climatic conditions.  Since the flow rate will vary throughout 

the mine life, a two-line adsorption circuit was selected to add flexibility for the operation. 

 

The PLS will be sampled and will pass through a trash screen prior to being distributed to the 

carbon-in-column (CIC) circuit.  The solution will flow by gravity from the first to the fifth 

contactor of each line.  Discharge from the last contactor will report to the carbon safety screen 

and will be sampled again prior to being pumped to the barren solution tank for recirculation 

on the heap.  Oversize from the carbon safety screen will be recovered in a tote bin. 

 

Each contactor will hold three tonnes of carbon.  Periodically, based on the precious metals 

loading, carbon from the first contactor will be transferred to the elution circuit using the carbon 

transfer pump, prior to the content of the following contactors being pumped upstream to the

previous unit.  It is planned to transfer three tonnes of carbon on a daily basis, alternating 

between both lines.

RECOVERY PLANT 
ACID WASH 
Carbon transferred from the first contactor of each adsorption line will be pumped to the acid 

wash vessel where, under contact with hydrochloric acid, scale build-up will be removed.  The 

acid wash vessel will have a 3-tonne capacity and will be constructed of fiberglass reinforced 

plastic (FRP). 

 
DESORPTION AND ELECTROWINNING 
Once the acid wash step has been completed, carbon will be transferred to the elution column 

where it will be stripped from its precious metals content using the pressure Zadra process.  

The circuit comprises a 3-tonne capacity carbon elution column and a barren strip solution 

tank with pumps.  The solution exiting the elution column is pumped to electrowinning.  Barren 

solution from electrowinning will be returned to the barren strip solution tank for recycle to the 

elution column. 

 

The electrowinning circuit will include two electrowinning cells. 

 

Once the elution cycle is complete, part of the barren eluate solution (bleed) from the stripping 

circuit will be pumped to the barren solution tank.  Fresh water, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-8 

sodium cyanide (NaCN) will be added to the barren strip solution tank to make-up for the lost 

barren strip solution. 

 
CARBON REGENERATION 
Once the elution cycle is complete, carbon will be pumped to the stripped carbon dewatering 

screen located in the carbon reactivation circuit.  The screen undersize will flow by gravity to 

the carbon fines collection tank while the screen oversize will report to the reactivation kiln feed 

hopper.  From there, the carbon will be fed by a screw feeder to the reactivation kiln.  

Reactivated carbon will leave the kiln and will be quenched using fresh water prior to being 

pumped to the reactivated carbon sizing screen.  Screen oversize will be returned to carbon 

contactors No. 5 or 10, while screen undersize will report to the carbon fines collection tank. 

 

Fresh carbon will enter the circuit via the agitated carbon pre-attrition tank, from bulk bags. 

Fresh water will be added to the tank, and the resulting slurry will be pumped to the reactivated 

carbon sizing screen.  

 

The agitated carbon fines collection tank will receive undersize carbon.  Carbon fines slurry 

from the tank will be pumped to the carbon fines filter.  Filter cake from the carbon fines filter 

will be collected in the carbon fines bin and shipped off-site for further processing.   

 
REFINING 
Precious metals will be washed from the cathodes and the resulting sludge pumped to the gold 

sludge filter.  The filter cake will be dried in an oven prior to being mixed with fluxes.  The 

mixture will then be processed in the gold melting furnace, which will produce liquid metal and 

liquid slag; the liquid metal will be poured into doré bars while the solidified slag will be collected 

and shipped off-site for subsequent treatment. 

 

Once in operation, dust and gas emissions from the ADR plant will be monitored for locally 

regulated metals and chemical compounds.  

 

Key design criteria for acid wash, elution, carbon regeneration, and refining are presented

HEAP LEACH FACILITIES 
The heap leach process consists of stacking crushed ore on the leach pad in lifts and leaching 

each individual lift to extract the gold content.  Barren leach solution (BLS) containing dilute 

sodium cyanide will be applied to the ore heap surface using drip emitters at a design 

application rate of 12 L/hr/m2.  Ten metre height (nominal) lifts will be leached in single 50 day 

primary leach cycles.  

 

The applied solution will percolate through the ore to the drainage system above the pad liner, 

where it will be collected in a network of perforated drain pipes embedded within a 0.6 m thick 

(minimum) granular drain cover fill layer above the liner.  The solutions will flow to the pond 

via gravity.  PLS collected in the pregnant solution pond will be pumped to the ADR plant for 

processing to extract the gold.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-10 

SITE GRADING 
The HLP site will be prepared for construction by first clearing, grubbing, and stripping of 

growth medium, which will be stockpiled at a location designated by OMAS.  Grading will 

involve local cuts and fills of native soil and bedrock.  Waste rock or other construction borrow 

materials may be required as a thin lift above local bedrock where exposed at the surface to 

create a uniform subgrade surface for placement of the low-permeable soil liner and this has 

been accounted for within the subgrade preparation.  The ultimate foundation grading and 

phasing plan was developed to minimize cuts and fills while maintaining foundation/pad slopes 

suitable for a stable heap and allowing gravity drainage of surface water around the perimeter 

of Phase 1, Phase 2, and the ultimate Phase 3 configuration of the HLP.  The foundation will 

be graded to provide a shallower slope along the soil-geomembrane interface below the toe 

area of the heap to promote stability.  Slopes in the upper portion of the pad generally range 

from 5% to 25%, with some localized areas having slopes up to approximately 50%, or 2H:1V.  

These areas will be re-graded to 40%, or 2.5H:1V, which is the maximum slope that is 

constructible without employing modified design details and specifications for steeper slopes. 

 

LEACH PAD 
The leach pad will be constructed in three phases with approximate areas of 578,000 m2, 

212,000 m2 and 155,000 m2 for Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  The total cumulative pad area 

including Phases 1 through 3 will be 945,000 m2.   

 

The leach pad will have a composite liner system consisting of a 2 mm smooth linear low-

density polyethylene (LLDPE) geomembrane underlain by a 0.5 m thick (minimum) compacted 

low-permeability soil layer with a maximum permeability of 1 x 10-9 m/s.  

 

A drain pipe network will be constructed above the pad liner and will be embedded within a 0.6 

m thick (minimum)  drain cover fill layer, which will consist of free-draining, hard, and durable 

granular material.  Solution and storm/snowmelt infiltration flows collected by the drain pipe 

network will gravity-drain to the process ponds.     

 

ORE HEAP 
The fully stacked (i.e., end of Phase 3) leach pad will have a nominal ore capacity of 40 Mt 

and a nominal maximum heap height of 80 m above the liner.  



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-11 

The ore is planned to be stacked in 10 m thick, horizontal lifts in three phases.  A summary of 

the heap capacity by phase, number of lifts, elevations, and stacking schedules are provided 

in the following paragraphs. 

 

Phase 1 was sized to contain nominally three years of ore production (i.e., 12 Mt) while 

maintaining a relatively flat configuration (i.e., ore shall be stacked against the foundation 

forming a wedge with a larger slope on the down gradient side and nearly no elevation 

difference between the top of ore and foundation grades on the upgradient side). 

 

Phase 2 was also sized to contain nominally three years of additional ore production while 

maintaining a relatively flat slope and up to 24 Mt.  For the case where the Project mine life is 

extended, a capacity of 40 Mt is required.  Phase 2 was also sized to contain approximately 

32 Mt of ore in the event additional reserves are not realized up to the 40 Mt design basis.  For 

this contingency, ore may be stacked up to the maximum allowable heights.  Sufficient top 

surface areas shall be maintained to facilitate leaching of the uppermost lifts. 

 

Phase 3 has been sized for the total HLP storage capacity of 40 Mt, with ore stacked up to the 

maximum allowable heights.  Sufficient top surface areas shall be maintained to facilitate 

leaching of the uppermost lifts. 

 

SLOPE STABILITY 
With the preferred liner system, the limit equilibrium stability analyses results showed a static 

FOS of 1.6, and a pseudo-static FOS of 1.0 for the Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE) 

considering a peak ground acceleration (PGAOBE) of 0.20g, both of which meet or exceed the 

minimums established in the Project design criteria.  The pseudo-static FOS for the Maximum 

Design Earthquake (MDE) was 0.8.  A displacement analysis was performed to develop 

estimates of expected deflections during the MDE (PGAMDE: 0.40 g) in accordance with 

standard industry practice. 

 

For the alternate liner systems, the ore outslopes will need to be constructed at an overall 

slope of 3.5H:1V rather than 3.0H:1V in order to maintain adequate FOS.  With the reduced 

slope, the static FOS for the GCL and HDPE alternatives were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.5, 

respectively.  Both alternatives showed FOS below 1.0 for the OBE and MDE events.  



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-12 

Therefore, additional displacement analyses were performed to estimate deflections in 

accordance with standard industry practice.  

 

Golder used the Makdisi and Seed (1978) dynamic deformation method to evaluate 

deformations in those cases where the FOS was less than unity.  For the preferred liner 

system, the analysis shows that the MDE will result in approximately 24 cm of displacement at 

the base of the HLP, where the ore contacts the liner.  For the alternative liner systems, the 

analysis shows the displacement at the base of the liner system will be approximately 10 cm 

to 35 cm for both alternatives during the OBE.  The selected geomembranes have sufficient 

tensile properties to accommodate this level of displacement and are therefore considered 

acceptable. 

 

At closure, the MDE is expected to induce displacements of up to approximately 1m, which is 

considered acceptable for a closed facility.  However, in order to maintain acceptable 

deformations to the basal liner system, a buttress should be constructed along the toe of the 

HLP by pushing some ore from the crest down towards the toe. 

 

SOLUTION COLLECTION SYSTEM DESIGN  
The drainpipe network should maintain an order of magnitude of higher permeability in the 

drain cover fill compared to the overlying ore heap.  The network is designed to drain the 

planned operational solution flow plus the additional flow from meteorological sources 

(determined from the probabilistic water balance), while maintaining acceptably low hydraulic 

heads on the pad's composite liner system (i.e., less than 0.6 m). 

 

The drainpipe network system consists of tertiary, secondary, and primary pipes.  Tertiary 

pipes will consist of 100 mm diameter perforated corrugated polyethylene (PCPE) tertiary 

pipes, which will be placed across the leach pad at 10 m spacing and laid to drain at slopes 

between 2% and 5%.  Secondary pipes will consist of 200 mm to 450 mm PCPE pipes.  

Primary pipes will consist of 450 mm PCPE (within the leach pad) and 450 mm solid wall HDPE 

pipe (DR-21) outside of the leach pad limits (i.e., between the pad and the process ponds).  

The drainage system and flow capacity calculations are based on ultimate ore load and 

consider potential of crushing of the pipes.  

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-13 

The drainpipe network on the HLP will be covered with a 0.6 m thick (minimum) drain cover fill 

layer. The drain cover fill will have a maximum particle size of 38 mm, and will contain less 

than 5% passing a No. 200 US standard sieve.  The drain cover fill will consist of crushed 

and/or screened low-grade ore, mine waste, and/or natural borrow material.  The drain fill 

permeability requirement is 1x10-3 m/sec or greater under the 80 m maximum ore heap load 

to ensure drained heap conditions. 

 

DRAINAGE CONTROLS 
Surface water drainage will be controlled with 0.5 m depth "v" shaped diversion channels 

(3H:1V side slopes) to convey the design storm event (100-year frequency, 24-hour duration 

storm event) around the HLP and ADR plant area.  Additionally, 1.5 m high temporary storm 

water management berms (2.5H:1V side slopes), which will be constructed upgradient (i.e., 

along the southern side) of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 HLP footprints to prevent surface water 

run-on to the HLP during expansion of the facility. 

 

The HLP site is located on a natural plateau, and there are no active springs or seeps within 

the planned facility footprint.  Therefore, no underdrain system is included in the HLP design.  

Additionally, currently available data indicates there are no active springs or seeps within the 

pond area footprint.  However, one of the test pits excavated in the pond area footprint during 

Golder's field exploration program (TP-02) identified wet to saturated soil, indicative of perched 

groundwater conditions, and one active spring was present nearby flowing at low rates during 

the time of the initial site investigation, indicating the presence of shallow perched 

groundwater.  An underdrain system may be required in the event that the excess perched 

groundwater does not quickly dissipate during initial excavation for the ponds.  

 

The leach pad will have 1.5 m high (minimum) perimeter berms to prevent applied solution and 

rainfall/snowmelt water within the pad from overflowing the pad.  The solution and storm flows 

will be collected by a drain pipe network constructed above the pad liner and routed by gravity 

to the process pond.

WATER BALANCE AND SOLUTION MANAGEMENT 
A probabilistic water balance model was developed for the HLP to simulate the performance 

of the facility.  The objectives of the analysis were to evaluate the demand for makeup water 

from external sources and the volume of excess water generated during HLP operation (i.e., 

for use in event pond sizing).  

 

The water balance model was developed using GoldSim software.  The generalized flow chart 

is shown in Figure 17-2. 

 

The water balance model was developed and applied to three different scenarios based on 

varying hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of the ore.  Ksat values of 0.1 cm/s, 1.0 cm/s, and 8.0 cm/s 

were assigned as scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Laboratory testing of the sample of post-

column leached ore received from KCA under the design normal loads indicated a permeability 

of 8.0 cm/s.  However, to account for field conditions, Golder believes that a more 

representative Ksat value may be within a range of 0.5 cm/s to 1.0 cm/s. Factors that may result 

in lowering the effective vertical hydraulic conductivity of the ore heap include the following: 1) 

surface trafficking (compaction) on top of previously placed ore, 2) breakdown of ore particles 

over time, 3) migration of fines particles, or 4) one lift (or a portion of one lift) placed with 

incrementally higher fines content.

The model applies precipitation based on a stochastic climate model calibrated to local 

weather stations.  A Monte-Carlo type analysis was used to calculate the required makeup 

water and pond storage capacity for the 10th, 50th, and 95th percentile climatic conditions (i.e., 

dry, average, and wet).  Based on the results, the PLS overflow pond was designed with a 

capacity of 83,800 m³ (plus one metre freeboard), and the make-up water pond was designed 

with a capacity of 26,250 m³ (plus 1m freeboard).  These capacities will provide enough 

capacity to prevent discharges from the facility for scenarios 1 and 2.  For scenario 3, the 

currently proposed ponds provide enough capacity for dry year conditions.  For average and 

wet year conditions, the PLS overflow pond is predicted to overflow late in Phase 2 and Phase 

3, respectively (but not during Phase 1).  To provide contingency for this scenario in the 

planning and design, Golder has allowed for expansion of the PLS overflow pond during Phase 

2, if the operational experience during Phase 1 shows that this is necessary. 

 

The model assumes that the make-up water demand is supplied by water taken from the PLS 

overflow pond, fresh water source, and make-up water pond, respectively.  Water balance 

results show that after the first year of operations, for the first two scenarios, a fresh water 

source with 125 m³/hr flow rate will provide sufficient supply for the required barren flow rate 

(453 m³/h).  The model predicts that for scenario 3 (Ksat = 8 cm/sec), at certain times during 

the operational life of the HLP some of the barren flow rate (453 m³/hr) may need to be supplied 

by an additional outside fresh water source.  Alternately, fresh water could be pumped into an 

additional fresh water storage pond for use during times when fresh water demand exceeds 

125 m³/hr. 

 

POND DESIGN 
The location and dimensions of the ponds are shown on Drawing 18 of the Öksüt Mine Heap 

Leach Facility Design Report submitted by Golder Associates (Turkey) Ltd. Co. on February 

11, 2015.  The internal pond side slopes will be graded to 3H:1V, and the external slopes will 

be graded to 2.5H:1V.  The PLS pond and PLS overflow pond will be double-lined, with a 

primary liner consisting of a 1.5 mm thick single sided textured (textured side up) HDPE 

geomembrane, and a secondary composite liner consisting of a 1.5 mm thick smooth HDPE 

geomembrane overlying a 500 mm thick low permeability soil layer.  The make-up water pond 

will be single composite lined with a one 1.5 mm thick single sided textured (textured side up) 

HDPE geomembrane overlying a 500 mm thick low permeability soil layer.  The double lined 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 17-17 

ponds will have a LCRS system located between the two liners.  The LCRS will be provided 

by a highly transmissive HDPE geonet material that will drain to a gravel filled LCRS sump 

(one per pond).  A smooth-walled, solid HDPE riser pipe will be installed within the LCRS sump 

and up the pond sideslopes to accommodate a submersible pump to remove solution that may 

report to the LCRS sump.  No penetrations in the liner systems will be made since the riser 

pipe will be booted through the liners in the anchor trench, outside of the containment area.  

An overflow spillway will be constructed to allow transference of solutions from the PLS pond 

to the PLS overflow pond, and from the PLS overflow pond to the make-up water pond to 

provide capacity for surplus solutions after significant storm events or under up-set conditions. 

 

REAGENTS 
Reagents will be delivered to the site by transport truck and stored on-site, in the vicinity of the 

ADR plant.  Quicklime and hydrochloric acid will be delivered in bulk and other reagents will 

be delivered in super bags or tote bins.  Reagents will be stored adjacent to the ADR plant, on 

the west side of the building.  This approach will be refined in the next Project phase, once 

discussions with suppliers have been initiated. 

 

Cyanide will be stored in a closed building to which access will be restricted.  Cyanide storage 

will meet the International Cyanide Management Code guidelines.  Other reagents will be kept 

under a shelter that will include containment for liquid products. 

 

Reagent packaging and consumptions are presented in Table 17-6.

WATER 
Fresh water will be pumped from wells located in the vicinity of the town of Epçe to the fresh 

water tank.  The tank location was selected so that water can be distributed by gravity to the 

crushing plant, the ADR building, the administration complex, and the truck shop.  The bottom 

part of the tank (565 m3) will serve as a reserve for fire protection.  This will allow a water flow 

of 280 m3/h during two hours, in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association 

(NFPA) regulation.  The upper part of the tank (145 m3) will be dedicated to the ADR plant 

usage, mainly for carbon handling and for reagent preparation. 

 

A make-up water pond, located in the vicinity of the ADR plant, will be filled by trucks from 

other surface ponds.  Make-up water to the barren solution tank will be pumped from the make-

up water pond.  In the event that the water inventory in the pond is insufficient, fresh water 

make-up will be used.  The fresh water consumption at the ADR plant is estimated at 

approximately 100 m3/day (1.2 L/s). 

 

POWER REQUIREMENTS 
The estimated total connected load is 7.84 MW with an average power draw of 4.73 MW.

GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS 

CRUSHING FACILITIES 
The primary and the secondary crushers will be located in two distinct buildings distanced by 

approximately 70 m.  Both crushing buildings were located so as to take advantage of the 

contours of the local terrain and minimize cut and fill requirements.  A 35 t crane will be installed 

in the primary crushing building and a 20 t crane in the secondary crushing building. 

 

A radial stacker will transport the crushed ore and form a kidney-shaped stockpile.  This will 

allow safe reclaiming of the ore on the side opposite to where the ore is discharged. 

 

ADR BUILDING 
The ADR building will house the CIC, carbon elution-regeneration and electrowinning circuits 

as well as reagent preparation and distribution installations.  Also included in the building are 

a refinery, a mechanical shop, a control room and offices for plant personnel.  The CIC circuit 

and the barren solution tank will be located outdoors while the remaining facilities will be 

located inside a cladded and heated building.  The layout will allow solution from each circuit 

to be recovered in a dedicated containment area so as to avoid mixing fluids that are not 

compatible.  Each containment area will be serviced by a sump pump. 

 

The ADR plant will be serviced by three cranes located in the carbon elution-regeneration and 

reagents area (2 t), in the refinery (2 t), and in the mechanical shop (10 t). Two hoist beams 

will service the CIC circuit. 

 

The barren solution tank will be located so as to allow expansion of the CIC circuit to the south, 

should it be required over the mine life.  The plant is located 15 m away from the solution 

ponds so as to allow traffic around the building.  Three sides of the building will be accessed 

on a regular basis (mechanical shop, reagents area, and refinery). 

 

A security closed-circuit television (CCTV) system will allow general surveillance for the 

process buildings and the gold recovery area.  The electrowinning and refinery installations 

will be located in a high security sector of the plant to which access will be restricted.  Process

areas such as the grizzly feeder, the crushers, and the vibrating screen will be monitored via 

a process CCTV system.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
SUMMARY 
The Öksüt Project requires the support of a well-established and maintained infrastructure 

especially considering not only the volume of reagent used and transported over the public 

roads, but also climatic challenges.   

 

The proposed Project site layout is shown in Figure 16-7. 

 

Waste dump details are found in Section 16 (Waste Dump Design and Stockpile Strategy) and 

17 (Heap Leach Pad).  The Project is not expected to generate any tailings. 

 

ACCESS ROADS 
The Project area is located at an elevation of approximately 1,800 m, in an area of high relief 

with mountains and valleys.  The Project area is surrounded by three urban areas, the village 

of Öksüt four kilometres south-southeast, the city of Develi approximately 10 km north-

northwest, and the village of Epçe approximately 10 km east. 

 

The existing roads in the region are located in the adjacent valleys and are generally paved 

and well maintained.  Existing roads are expected to be utilized as much as possible and 

extended to the Project area with a cut-off from the national road network.  The main access 

route selected is the "east access" via Epçe.  This road will be approximately 8.18 km long.  

The total length of site roads will be approximately 6 km. 

 

A bypass road will be constructed around the towns of Gömedi and Yazıbaşı.  Its route will be 

on the west side of the towns, and will be approximately 6.7 km long.  It will be constructed 

using the same standards as the existing public roads.  It may also be necessary for the Project 

to upgrade the existing road that connects the towns of Gömedi and Epҫe.  This will be further 

investigated during the detailed engineering phase of the Project.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 18-2 

POWER SUPPLY 
Power to the site will be supplied from a 31.5 kV electrical network through a dedicated 28.5 

km overhead line coming from the Sendrimeke substation.  The overhead line will consist of 

two segments, from Sendrimeke to Develi (18 km) and from Develi to the Project site (10.5 

km), and will terminate at the site substation where the power provider will have its metering 

station.  The distribution voltage will be regulated using a transformer with an under-load tap 

changer (ULTC) at the site substation and then distributed throughout the site using 31.5 kV 

overhead lines.  A capacitor bank will also be installed at the site substation to maintain a unity 

power factor. 

 

At each consumer location, voltage will be stepped down to 400 V using outdoor transformers, 

either pole mounted or on the ground.  The 400 V will then be distributed to the process and 

auxiliary loads using indoor switchgear units located in the different electrical rooms. 

 

For buildings, power will be supplied from three substations, two of which were sized for loads 

of buildings only.  For the reagent storage area, a substation located in the ADR area will be 

used.  

 

WATER HANDLING 

WATER SUPPLY 
Water supply investigations were based on a design value of 35 L/s provided by OMAS as the 

Project fresh water requirement.  The EpÒ«e agglomerate aquifer was chosen as the 

groundwater source for the Project. 

 

The field investigations conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 at two 

selected locations in the EpÒ«e area included well drilling, instrumentation, and aquifer testing.  

One test well and two observation wells were completed at each location.  Based on the results 

of the two long-term tests, the two pumping wells (E1TW1 and E2TW1) are expected to 

produce a combined volume of over 60 L/s. 

 

The fresh water supply pipeline will deliver water from the two wells located near the village of 

EpÒ«e to the fresh water supply tank at the mine site.  The two wells have been specified to 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 18-3 

supply 22 L/s (E1TW1) and 35 L/s (E2TW1), respectively, to a sump located at the main pump 

station.  Submersible pumps will pump water from the wells through 150 mm DR17 HDPE 

pipelines running from the well to the main pump station.  At the main pump station, two vertical 

turbine pumps (one operating and one standby) will be mounted in a concrete sump, and used 

to deliver the water to the mine site.  The fresh water supply pipeline from the main pumping 

station to the mine site will be approximately 9.3 km long, and constructed of 150 mm standard 

weight carbon steel. 

 

Operation of the fresh water supply pipeline is assumed to be constant, shut down only for 

regular scheduled mine maintenance.  There are several areas of optimization, including the 

optimal configuration for the well pump systems, proposed pipeline routes, and sequencing of 

the pipeline and road construction, that should be investigated during the next level of 

engineering design.   

 

For Project buildings, raw water will be supplied from the raw water tank which is located at an 

elevated hill.  Prior to distribution to the buildings, raw water will be treated in a package 

treatment unit via cartridge filters and UV light.  Potable water will be supplied to the 

kitchenette, showers, and washbasins.  For toilets, raw water will be distributed.  A 20 m3 

treated (potable) water tank is allocated near the treatment plant in order to provide reservoir 

for buildings as well as to provide sufficient head and reservoir to pump treated water to a 

mobile tanker for distribution to remote areas.  

 

Small capacity tanks are designed for buildings in remote areas for short term storage. 

 

SITE WATER MANAGEMENT 
The water at the Project site can be broadly classified into "non-contact" and "contact" water.  

Non-contact water is surface runoff and groundwater which is not impacted by mining 

operations.  Non-contact water is typically diverted around the mine facilities.  Contact water 

is surface runoff and groundwater that is generated, or has been in contact with, mine facilities.  

Contact water typically requires management, sedimentation, and/or treatment prior to 

discharge to the environment.  Golder has prepared a site-wide water management plan 

(Golder, 2014c).  All contact water was considered by Golder to be Potentially Acid Generating

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 18-4 

(PAG) based on the current understanding of the geochemical characteristics of the rocks at 

the Project site.   

 

The proposed site-wide water management plan includes a non-contact water diversion 

system and a contact water collection system.   

 

The proposed non-contact diversion system would be composed of a network of diversion 

channels around the waste dump and the pits collecting water from undisturbed catchments 

located upstream of the mine facilities.  The proposed contact water collection system would 

be composed of a network of channels, underdrains, and ponds to collect contact water runoff 

and seepage from the waste dump, stockpiles, and pits. 

 

The water management plan and water infrastructure design were based on the climate design 

parameters described in Section 5, integrated as required (Golder, 2014a).  The general 

approach is to design the contact and non-contact water diversion system to safely 

accommodate the 1-in-100 year peak flow, including snowmelt contribution.  Contact water 

pond storage will be sized to contain runoff from the 1-in-100 year, 24 hour storm event and 

24 hour average seepage.   

 

SEWAGE WATER TREATMENT 
Due to dispersed settlement of facilities, a hybrid sewage network system has been designed 

to provide the most efficient sewage treatment system.  In this system, an underground 

sewage network is installed to serve the most populated Project areas and connected to a 

nearby sewage treatment plant.  

 

For remote locations such as ADR building and gatehouse/public relations (PR) building where 

underground sewage system is not feasible to be extended, septic tanks are designed for short 

term storage of the liquid waste.  These tanks will be emptied out via mobile trucks and taken 

to the main sewage treatment plant, on regular intervals.  The sewage treatment plant is 

designed with an equalization (holding) tank to handle both continuous liquid waste coming 

from the sewage system and also intermittent bulk loads of liquid waste coming through mobile 

trucks. 

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 18-5 

Sludge generated in the sewage treatment plant will be taken to designated landfill areas, at 

regular intervals.  The treated effluent from the sewage treatment plant will be stored in a 

storage tank and pumped out to the point of consumption.  Chemical wastewater produced in 

the chemical and metallurgical analysis laboratories will be treated by neutralization and 

disposed into the main sewage network. 

 

PROJECT BUILDINGS 
Project buildings will include: 

• Process buildings, including 

o Primary and secondary crusher buildings 

o Crushing area electrical room 

o ADR Plant 

 

• Support buildings, including 

o Administration building 

o Dry building 

o Dining hall 

o Laboratory 

o Heating centre and Liquefied Natural Gas storage 

o Gatehouse/PR building 

o Weigh scale house 

o Warehouse 

o Fuel storage 

o Firewater pump house 

o Cyanide storage 

o Reagent storage 

 

FUEL DELIVERY AND STORAGE SYSTEMS 
Diesel fuel will be required for process plant and mining operations.  The most significant diesel 

users are as follows: 

• Mining equipment including haul trucks; 

• Light vehicles; 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 18-6 

• Generators. 

 

Monthly diesel consumption is expected to be approximately 500,000 L. 

 

Diesel will be supplied from one of the major oil companies in Turkey, most probably with a 

long-term purchase and dealership agreement.  

 

Diesel will be delivered to the plant in trucks and stored in a 250 m3 tank equipped with pumps 

for unloading diesel from trucks.  This main storage tank has the storage capacity for two 

weeks of consumption.  A 20 m3 day tank will be located next to the storage tank, equipped 

with pumps for loading diesel service trucks and also a dispenser to service light vehicles. 

 

Vehicles that routinely pass the haul road during operations will refuel at that facility as 

required.  Machinery operating only in the mining areas will be regularly refuelled by service 

and refuelling trucks. 

 

SITE SERVICES 
Site services will include security personnel and equipment, a first aid station, and telephone 

and internet communications.  Employees are expected to live in the city of Develi or nearby 

villages.  Special shuttle buses with adequate seating capacity will handle the transportation 

between the residential areas and the Project site.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 
INTRODUCTION 
The environmental and social studies for the Öksüt Project were initiated in June 2013.  The 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Öksüt Project was commenced in accordance 

with the Turkish EIA regulation and practices on April 14, 2014.  A draft EIA Report was 

submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning (MEUP) on July 7, 2015 (SRK 

Danişmanlik ve Mühendislik A.Ş., 2015).  The EIA permitting process was continuing at the 

date of this Technical Report. 

 

PERMITTING 
The Turkish EIA regulation is similar to the European Union (EU) EIA Directive in structure and 

procedures.  The Turkish EIA permitting process involves a scoping phase inherent in the 

official permitting process.  An EIA application describing the Öksüt Project's environment and 

potential environmental impacts was submitted to the MEUP in June 2014 to initiate the EIA 

permitting process.  Based on the EIA application and the feedback from the official public 

hearing, the MEUP in coordination with other regulatory agencies provided a mandatory Terms 

of Reference (ToR) for the Öksüt EIA studies and EIA Report. The EIA application was 

submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization on July 7, 2014 by SRK and a public 

hearing meeting was held on August 7, 2014.  The draft EIA Report was submitted on April 

14, 2015 in accordance with the ToR.  Following their review, the Review and Assessment 

Committee provided comments and requested certain revisions to the EIA Report in June 

2015.  OMAS expects that further review by the Review and Assessment Committee will be 

undertaken and public hearing and consultations will be held prior to final approval of the EIA 

Report. 

 

Following the formal approval of the EIA Report, OMAS will apply for all necessary construction 

and operation permits as described in Section 4.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 

BASELINE STUDIES 
During the early exploration program (2008-2012) conducted by Stratex, the environmental 

baseline data collection was carried out by Golder.  These baseline studies were preliminary 

and limited in nature as the Project features and the Project site were not yet defined.  During 

the feasibility phase and the EIA permitting process (2012-2015), comprehensive baseline 

environmental data was collected by SRK and involved the following: 

• Air quality monitoring (gaseous and particulates) which determined that overall air 
quality in the Project area is at typical rural levels and better than established air quality 
limits. 
 

• Noise measurement which determined that noise levels in the Project area are at 
typical rural levels. 
 

• On-site meteorological monitoring. 
 

• Ground and surface water quality monitoring. 
 

• Hydrogeological (groundwater) measurements and monitoring which found five 
different hydrogeological units, including three such units where groundwater wells 
were drilled for water supply (near Epçe village).  The oldest one, which has low 
permeability, is mid-Miocene age andesites, which are a member of the DVC volcanites 
and are in contact with a fault system with a north-south direction, and with upper 
Miocene agglomerate (a member of the Sarıca volcanics) which has high hydraulic 
conductivity and is considered as the main aquifer unit. 
 

• Hydrological (surface water) monitoring which began in July 2013 and continued for 
four quarters involved sampling from  groundwater wells at a total of 13 surface water 
points and 20 groundwater points.  Water quality assessments for groundwater and 
surface water were carried out with regard to Turkish and EU water quality regulations. 
 

• Soil and sediment quality measurements which found that approximately 40% of the 
land within the Öksüt Project site consists of lime-free brown forest soil group, and 60% 
of bare rocky lands. 
 

• Field flora and fauna surveys which identified no protected flora species but found a 
number of protected reptiles, amphibians, and birds in the Project area. 
 

• Protected areas within the Project area include part of the Sultan Sazlığı Wetland Area 
(Ramsar Site) and the Zamantı River Wetland (Figure 20-1) as well as the Erciyes 
Winter Sports Tourism Centre.  Other than these, the Project area consists of bare 
rock, pasture land, and shrubbery. 
 

• Ore and waste geochemical characterization tests (Acid Rock Drainage/Metal 
Leaching, or ARD/ML) were carried out to determine ARD/ML characteristics of the

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 20-3 

Öksüt mine lithologies, assess the potential ARD/ML related impacts in the post-
closure phase, and identify mitigation measures relevant to open pits, waste rock 
dump, and heap leach facility.  For this purpose, mineralogical analysis, acid-base 
accounting, total rock and trace element analysis, contact leach testing, and kinetic 
analyses were carried out on samples from both the Keltepe and Güneytepe deposit 
areas. For the closure phase, predictive geochemical modelling studies were carried 
out for the waste rock dump area and the heap leach pad.  The risk of occurrence of 
ARD was identified for the waste rock dump and measures were determined that will 
minimize contact with the surface water and ensure collection of the leachates in this 
area.

SOCIAL STUDIES 
A Preliminary Social Baseline and Impact Assessment was prepared in January 2014 and this 

is being updated by a comprehensive social baseline survey (undertaken in December 2014) 

which is being used to prepare an international-standard Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment (ESIA) for the Project.  Detailed information on households and communities 

within the vicinity of the Project is under preparation as part of this process. 

 

In addition, the EIA included an assessment of economic and social issues at a regional and 

provincial level, and a summary of public participation undertaken, to meet EIA requirements.   

 

The social impact assessment for the Project is focused on the neighbourhoods adjacent to 

the Project area and also includes the regional centre of Develi. 

 

The social baseline survey that will provide the key socio-economic input for the ESIA covers 

the following topics: 

• Demography 

• Social Structures 

• Economy  

• Employment & Livelihoods 

• Social Infrastructure 

• Land Use and Natural Resources 

• Community Health, Safety and Security  

• Cultural Heritage 

 

As part of the Turkish EIA and for the ESIA, OMAS has identified key stakeholders including: 

• Direct stakeholders – local residents and community representatives within the 
immediate vicinity of the Project; 
 

• Indirect stakeholders – provincial and regional authorities and other interested parties. 
 

Ten local communities were identified in the Develi District that were considered likely to be 

directly influenced by OMAS activities.  These include Develi, Yukari Develi, Gazi, Öksüt, 

Sarıca, Tombak, Zile, Epçe, Gömedi, and Yazıbaşı. 

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 20-6 

In the course of the EIA, a community participation meeting was held at the Old Municipal 

Wedding Hall in Zile on August 7, 2014 following national and local advertisement and was 

attended by approximately 60 participants, including representatives of the Ministry of 

Environment and Urban Planning, the Provincial Environment and Urban Planning Directorate 

of the Office of Governor of Kayseri, local business representatives, and local residents.  As 

part of the socio-economic baseline survey, and in support of ongoing community engagement, 

a series of household surveys were undertaken in Öksüt and Zile in December 2014 using 

detailed registers of all residents.   

 

A community relations team has been established by OMAS and an information office has 

been opened in Develi.  A stakeholder engagement plan is in place to ensure that there is 

regular ongoing engagement with direct and indirect stakeholders, to inform them of Project 

plans and developments on an ongoing basis and gather any complaints or feedback.  A 

stakeholder engagement register records all OMAS interactions with stakeholders. 

 

OMAS recognizes the short mine life of the Project and is working to ensure that the Project 

will leave behind enduring and self-sustaining benefits for local communities.  For this purpose, 

OMAS has developed a Social Policy. 

 

To support implementation of the Social Policy and ensure that Project benefits are maximized 

and impacts minimized, OMAS is developing an environmental and social management 

system.  In relation to community relations issues, this includes management plans and 

strategies covering: 

• Community Development 

• Stakeholder Engagement 

• Pastureland Management and Livelihood 

• Cultural Heritage 

• Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement 

• Social Closure 

• Local Procurement and Contracting 

• Local Employment  

• Community Health, Safety and Security 

• Contractor Management

• Grievance Management 

 

CONCEPTUAL CLOSURE PLAN 
Mine closure and rehabilitation in Turkey is mainly regulated through the Regulation on 

Reclamation of Mine Sites.  The regulation requires preparation of a mine closure report as 

part of the EIA permit.  Further to this, the Landfill Regulation is applicable to mining processed 

wastes (i.e. excluding waste rock dumps) regarding the cover requirements during mine 

closure.  There is also a draft regulation on Mining Waste Management that is expected to be 

similar to the European Union Directives on the same topic and is likely to have requirements 

on waste rock dumps.  A conceptual mine closure discussion is provided below for the main 

mine units. 

 

Closure costs have been estimated at $27M for the Project. 

 

OPEN PITS 
Hydrogeology investigations have indicated that the groundwater table would be below the 

open pit bottoms.  Therefore, pit lake formation at closure is considered unlikely.  Any surface 

water run-off into the open pits would report to the Acısu spring, which has already low pH 

levels and high dissolved metals.  Therefore, no special measures would need to be taken at 

closure to mitigate the ARD/ML generation from the open pit shells. 

 

At closure, the open pits are expected to be bunded off with inert waste rock.  The bunding 

would provide protection against people, animal, vehicles etc. falling into the pit by accident.  

Around the rock bunding there would be a chain fence with warning signs. The open pits are 

located within the forestry land. After closure, the open pit area would be returned to the 

Department of Forestry. 

 

HEAP LEACH PAD 
Following waste acceptance criteria testing, waste characterization determined that the Öksüt 

heap leach spent ore is classified as Category-1 (under the Turkish Landfill Regulation) due to 

elevated As levels in the test leachate. According to the Landfill Regulation, Category-1 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 20-8 

processed mining waste facilities must be sealed with a closure cover comprising the following 

features: 

• The mineral surface sealing should be at least 25 cm thick applied in a double layer; 

• Geosynthetics may be used to reinforce the mineral sealing;   

• The drainage layer should be at least 0.5 m thick with K ≥ 1.0 x 10-4 m/s permeability; 
and 

• Top soil cover should be at least 0.5 m thick and suitable for the growth of chosen 
vegetation.  

 

Any drainage emanating from the HLP during or after closure may also require management, 

depending on the chemistry of the solutions. In similar climates in the United States and 

Australia, both passive and active management measures have proven effective in the 

management of post-closure heap leach drainage. These range from passive evaporation or 

evapotranspiration systems, to active water treatment. In the closure phase, the heap leach 

pad is planned to be rinsed.  The rinsate will be sent to the processing plant. Since the lime 

and hence alkalinity will be washed out from the heap during the rinsing process, acid 

generation may occur due to sulphur content of the ore, as observed in the lab tests. For this 

reason, uncontrolled discharge from the heap leaching after the closure should be prevented. 

The rinsate during the closure period should be treated as process water and not discharged. 

 

The HLP slopes will be adjusted to 3:1 at closure for long-term stability. 

 

WASTE ROCK DUMP 
Geochemical testing indicated that most, if not all, of the waste rock is PAG and that 

development of ARD could occur when the rock is exposed to weathering.  It is expected that 

the leachate at the waste rock dump area will have acidic pH.  Furthermore, there is risk that 

Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn concentrations in the leachate would exceed the discharge limit values 

if no measure is taken.  For this reason, measures that will minimize contact with the surface 

water and ensure collection of the leachates must be taken at the waste rock dump area during 

the closure phase.  In order to minimize the effects of ARD/ML on the downstream water quality 

during the post-closure period, the following closure methods will need to be taken: 

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 20-9 

• The temporary diversion channels in the upstream of the waste rock dump should be 
preserved until the end of the rehabilitation period to minimize the entry of water into 
the waste rock dump. 
 

• A closure cover layer should be formed on the waste rock dump throughout the 
rehabilitation period.  The closure cover would divert the precipitation and subsequent 
surface flow away from the dump preventing contamination, as well as minimize 
percolation of precipitation into the dump. 
 

• The upper layer of the cover should consist of top soil to allow rehabilitation and 
plantation.  Below the soil layer, other mineral and artificial cover layers (drainage layer, 
mineral layer, and artificial layer) should be placed to minimize infiltration.  A closure 
cover similar to the closure cover of the heap leach pad (Class I) should be applied at 
the waste rock dump. 
 

• Following the completion of the closure cover, the leachate collection pond in the 
downstream should be re-purposed.  The leachate collection pond should be turned 
into an evaporation cell with impermeable bottom so that any seepage from the dump 
after the closure would be collected and evaporated. 

 

The WRD slopes will be adjusted to 3:1 at closure for long-term stability. 

 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
With the exception of the open pits, waste rock dump, and heap leach pad, all mining structures 

will be removed at closure.  Any salvageable equipment will be sold as second hand 

equipment. Those that cannot be sold, will be recycled as scrap.  The footprints of the mining 

units will be scraped and leveled.  Where possible, the land surface will be re-vegetated. 

However, it should be noted that the site consists of either rocky areas (no top soil) or very thin 

top soil (0 – 20 cm).  Any top soil required for reclamation beyond that which is available on 

site would need to be imported.   

 

The current land use of the Project area is pastureland used for animal husbandry and grazing.  

After closure, the land will have to return to its original use.  This will need to be established in 

discussions with the regulatory agencies.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
ASSUMPTIONS 
The following material assumptions have been used in the life of mine plans, estimates of 

operating and capital costs, and Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates: 

• A gold price of $1,250 per ounce; 

• An exchange rate: US$1: 2.5 TL; and 

• Electricity cost of $0.14 per kilowatt hour. 

 

CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE 
All pre-production expenditures and construction capital have been assumed to occur in Years 

-2 and -1 (2015-2016) and Q1 2017, with mining commencing in mid-2016 and, subsequent to 

commissioning, full production processing operations commencing in Q2 2017.  Total initial 

direct and indirect capital costs and pre-production operating costs are estimated to be 

$220.8M.  This total includes all applicable Owner's costs, HLP, ADR, infrastructure, 

engineering, mining, working capital, and project management costs, with a contingency of 

15% upon commencement of construction.  The estimates are found in Table 21-1.

UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL COSTS 
The utilities section includes all of the capital required to deliver electrical power to the site.  

There is a provision for the tie-in to the Sendrimeke substation, as well as the power line to the 

site.  This line is estimated to run 28 km from the tie point to the site's main substation.  The 

costs for the tie point hardware and installation as well as the construction of the power line 

will be recovered from TEIAŞ, the Turkish Power Transmission Company, during the first years 

of mine production, through a reduction in the usage charges incurred during operation.  The 

final contract has not been negotiated, although OMAS has received the official approval for 

proceeding with the construction. 

 

The infrastructure portion includes all of the roads, ancillary buildings, water and sewage 

systems, etc.  The capital allocation for the roads include the bypass, estimated at 6.8 km, 

around the towns of Gömedi and Yasi Basi, as well as the upgrade of the Gömedi -Epҫe public 

road, to bring it up to the standards required for heavy transports, if necessary. 

 

The site haul roads are included in the Roads-On site section of Table 21-3.  The cost is based 

on cutting and filling approximately 1.5M tonnes of material, thus precluding the need for using 

waste rock as haul road construction material.  This will allow for the construction of the haul 

roads before the mine pre-stripping is concluded.

PROCESSING AND WATER HANDLING 
The processing section includes the primary and secondary crushers, as well as the reagent 

storage facilities.  However, the main component of this section is the complete construction 

of the ADR plant.  The intention at this time is to issue a contract for the complete designing 

and building of this plant.  Preliminary discussions were held with vendors who have the 

capability to perform this level of project, including the attaining of functional specification 

targets relating to the production of doré bars.  The processing capital cost summary is shown 

in Table 21-4. 

 

The water handling section includes the construction of the raw water pumping and piping 

system from the wells in EpÒ«e to the fresh water tank located east of the HLP.  The tank will 

be located at an elevation that will allow for the gravity distribution of both raw water and 

firewater.  The water handling capital cost summary is shown in Table 21-5.

for OMAS will become an OMAS corporate operating expense once Project operations 

commence.  

 

There is an allowance in this section for the construction and pre-commissioning insurance, 

as well as for light vehicles, including the firetruck and the ambulance.  The owner's capital 

cost summary is shown in Table 21-6.

PERMITTING AND LAND ACQUISITION CAPITAL COSTS 

The Permitting section includes the mine operating licence, the rental fees on the forestry land, 

and the fees for the pasture land for all of 2016, as well as the Q1 2017.  These fees are 

ongoing, and will be accounted for in the Operating Expenses for the remainder of the mine 

life.  

 

There is a one time deposit of $1.4M in 2016 for the use of the pasture land.  This is returnable 

after the mine closure. 

 

These costs are being further investigated to determine if there are any savings potential. 

 

The capital set aside for land acquisition is an estimate based on the amount of private land

CONSTRUCTION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
The construction and project management section includes all of the capital costs associated 

with engineering and managing the construction and commissioning of the Project.  The 

engineering component is based on proposals received by the engineering who have 

presented detailed engineering. 

 

Geotechnical includes all of the subsurface analysis required before construction can 

commence, to confirm the load bearing characteristics of the supporting surface.  Some 

geotechnical drilling and analysis was performed, but several locations of major sites have 

shifted, thus requiring additional work. 

 

The construction and project management capital cost summary is shown in Table 21-8.

PROJECT SUSTAINING CAPITAL 
Sustaining capital requirements for the Project are minimal, primarily due to the contracting 

out of the mining tasks, obviating the need for allocating sustaining capital for mobile mining 

equipment, and for haul road maintenance, which is part of the mining contractor's costs.  The 

estimates are found in Table 21-9.  



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 21-8 

The major sustaining capital requirements are for completing the Phase 2 and Phase 3 

construction of the HLP. 

 

The other area requiring additional sustaining capital is the replacement of light vehicles during 

the life of the mine.

CLOSURE COST 
Closure costs have been estimated at $27M, or $1.03/t processed, for the Project.  This value 

has been based on mine closure industry experience combined with knowledge of current gold 

operations in Turkey.  Prior to construction, a more detailed Conceptual Closure Plan (CCP) 

will be developed that will further expand on the aforementioned closure concepts, and use a 

systematic approach for more accurately estimating the closure costs such as Standardized 

Reclamation Cost Estimator (SRCE). 

 

OPERATING COSTS 
Operating costs were developed from first principles for processing and general and 

administrative costs.  Mining costs have been based upon discussion with mining contractors 

in Turkey with additional estimates for engineering, grade control, and contractor 

management.  These costs have been estimated using typical staffing requirements and wage 

rates in Turkey, as estimated by Centerra.  Unit rates of consumption for materials and supplies 

are based on test work and relevant industry standards.  A summary of unit operating costs is 

shown in Table 21-10 and total annual operating costs can be seen in Table 21-18 at the end 

of this section.

PROCESS 
LABOUR 
Labour costs (including overtime, social security payments and bonuses) were estimated from 

a staffing list generated from knowledge of similar heap leach operations, both in Turkey and 

other countries.  The staffing list is based on the assumption that all employees would live 

locally near the Öksüt mine and would be bussed to the site.  No camp is included in the 

operation.  ADR and heap leach operations would operate on a continuous basis while other 

aspects of the operation would work Monday to Friday.  Table 21-11 shows the ADR and Heap 

Leach Staffing List and Table 21-12 shows the Maintenance Staffing List.  Maintenance 

includes crushing, heap leach, ADR, and other surface facilities but excludes mining.

PROCESS OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE SUPPLIES, POWER COSTS 
Costs for operating supplies and power consumption were estimated from first principles.  

Reagent consumptions were estimated from metallurgical testing or based on industrial 

practice.  Cyanide consumption was estimated at 30% of test work data which was 0.30 kg/t.  

Budget quotations for reagents were obtained.  Prices are based on a delivered price to the 

mine site.  The electrical load list was assembled from the engineering completed for the heap 

leach, ADR facility and the water supply line to the site.  Estimates of loads for buildings and 

heating were used pending further engineering.  Demand and utilization factors were applied 

to each installed electrical load.  The total installed electrical load is 7.8 MW and the net power 

draw is 4.7 MW.  Consumable costs for crushing and screening were estimated through the 

Metso Bruno crushing simulator.  The estimates are based on the equipment selected, 

throughput and hardness data. 

 

Maintenance supplies costs were estimated as a percentage of capital costs.  This includes 

costs for building maintenance, mechanical and piping and electrical and instrumentation.

MINING 
It has been assumed that mining will be done by a mining contractor who will be responsible 

for all drilling and blasting, loading, hauling, and road and dump maintenance.  The mining 

contractor will also be responsible for performing maintenance on all mobile equipment.  Costs 

will be based on an all-in rate per cubic metre mined.  Centerra will provide engineering and 

survey support, and will perform all grade control activities.  Costs for blasthole assaying, 

software and supplies, and personnel have been included in the mining costs.  Table 21-16 

shows the mining labour breakdown excluding the mining contractor.

ROYALTIES 
As discussed in Section 4, the royalties applied to the Öksüt mine operations are a Turkish 

Government State royalty, a NSR royalty payable to Stratex Gold, and a royalty payable to 

Teck.  Subsequent to the pit optimization it was determined that if gold was refined in Turkey 

the royalty owed to the Turkish government would be reduced from 6% to 3%, which is 

reflected in the operating cost estimate.  The royalty to Stratex Gold is a 1% NSR on all 

precious metals extracted from Öksüt, net of refining charges, that is subject to a cap of a 

maximum of $20M.  

 

The total royalty cost is $35.6M, or $1.36/t processed. 

 

REFINING 
Refining costs of $3.34/oz of gold sold, or $0.11/t processed, were included in the operating 

costs.  It is assumed all gold will be refined in Turkey.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
The material economic assumptions such as operating and capital cost estimates used for the 

calculations presented in this section and the justifications for such assumptions have been 

given in Section 21.  The estimates provided in Section 21 have been summarized in Tables 

21-1 and 21-18.  

 

CASH FLOW FORECAST 
Using a price of gold of $1,250 per ounce, as assumed for the Mineral Reserve estimation 

process, the open pit LOM plan, the processing schedule, and the operating and capital cost 

forecasts, an estimate of the after-tax free cash flow for the Öksüt Project has been made 

(Table 22-1).  As shown in Tables 22-1 and 22-2, the total after-tax undiscounted free cash 

flow is $435.9M whereas the after-tax free cash flow discounted at 8% is $242.0M.  The internal 

rate of return (IRR) of the Project is 42.5% after taxes.  The payback period on construction 
capital and pre-production expenditures is expected to be two and half years after production 

commences. 

 

The after-tax free cash flow includes all pre-production costs, ESIA permitting, and other 

related costs.  Additional exploration work including tasks budgeted for 2016 have not been 

included in the Project financial analysis as it is assumed that any such work would be done 

to increase the currently defined Project resource.  Exploration expenses incurred during 2014 

and 2015 have been applied to the financial model for the purposes of taxation. 

 

Capital costs include the construction of the power line and deposits related to forestry and 

land pasture fees, which will be returned to Centerra over the LOM.  In the case of the power 

line, it has been assumed that the cost will be recovered by a series of five equal payments, 

paid yearly, beginning in 2017 and finishing in 2021.  The forestry and land pasture deposits 

have been assumed to be refunded at the end of closure and reclamation activities in 2025.

TAXATION AND ROYALTIES 
The corporate income tax rate in Turkey is 20%.  However, Investment Incentive Certificates 

(IIC) are available to provide reduced corporate tax rates for profits derived from investments 

made in Turkey to promote economic development.  The Öksüt Project economic analysis 

assumes that an IIC will be obtained.   

 

Based on the scope and the amount of the planned investment, it is expected that a Strategic 

IIC will be granted to the Project.  If the Öksüt Project receives a Strategic IIC, it will be eligible 

for the additional following benefits: 

• Further reduction of corporate income tax rate  

• VAT exemption 

• Customs duty exemption 

• Government support for interest payments on loans which are registered to the IIC 

• Government support for employer's share of social security premiums 

• VAT refund support 

 

For the economic analysis, only the impact of the corporate income tax rate reductions under 

the IIC and the Strategic IIC have been included.  The corporate income tax rate reduction for 

the Öksüt Project becomes available through the opportunity to receive an income tax credit 

against income tax expense that results from taxable income.  The amount of the tax credit 

depends on the amount of eligible capital expenditures qualifying under the IIC.  For the Öksüt 

Project, a strategic IIC would permit the receipt of an income tax credit equal to 50% of the 

amount of capital expenditures qualifying as eligible under the IIC.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 22-4 

Assets that are used for more than one year and that are subject to wear and tear are 

depreciated at legislated rates that are based on the useful lives of various categories of fixed 

assets.  In general, the rate determined for fixed assets specific to the mining sector is 10%.  

Taxpayers in Turkey have the option of selecting either the straight line method or the double 

declining balance method to calculate depreciation for fixed assets, although some intangible 

fixed asset categories are not eligible for the double declining method. 

 

Some capitalized expenditures, such as exploration expenses, development expenses, and 

mine land expenses, are subject to depletion at a rate which is determined by the Ministry of 

Finance and that takes into consideration the total ore reserve and the amount of ore extracted. 

 

Gold production from the Project is also subject to three royalties, as follows: 

1. A Turkish Government State royalty levied as a percentage of revenue less certain 
qualifying operating costs.  The percentage is determined on a sliding scale that is 
linked to the price of gold and may be reduced by 50% if the ore is further processed 
in a refinery in Turkey (as is assumed in the economic analysis).  Based on the 
assumed gold price of $1,250/oz, an effective royalty rate of 2% was used in the 
economic analysis. 
 

2. A 1% NSR royalty payable to Stratex Gold up to a maximum of $20M; and 
 

3. A sliding scale NSR royalty payable to Teck based on the cumulative ounces produced 
over the LOM.  Centerra has estimated this royalty to be 0.6% of total gold revenues. 

 

The base case considers that only the Turkish Government State royalty will be deductible as 

a taxable expense.  The Stratex Gold and Teck royalties have been considered to be non-

deductible expenses.  The total effective royalty rate used for the economic analysis, at an 

assumed gold price of $1,250/oz, is 3.6%. 

 

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Table 22-3 provides after-tax free cash flow forecasts for the Öksüt Project based on the 

current LOM plan and a gold price of $1,250 per ounce.  The table also shows the sensitivity 

of the Project NPV to gold prices ranging from $1,050 to $1,450 on $100 increments and on 

discount rates ranging from 0% to 10%.  Sensitivities to four other variables at the base case 

gold price and a discount rate of 8% are also shown on a ±15% basis.  Figure 22-1 is a 

graphical illustration of the cash flow sensitivities.

Project NPV(8%) by $83.6M whereas a gold price increase of 15% results in an additional 

$79.3M to the Project NPV(8%). 

 

When considering the downside scenario, the Project is most sensitive to the gold price 

followed by gold grade or process recovery and then by operating and capital costs 

respectively. A 15% reduction in the gold price reduces the Project NPV(8%) by $85.5M.  

Similarly, a reduction in the gold grade or process recovery of 15% reduces the Project NPV(8%) 

by $84.2M. 

 

At a gold price of $767 per ounce and an 8% discount rate, the Project is cash flow neutral, 

but meets all foreseen capital and operating expenses including cash taxes.  At gold prices 

higher than $767 per ounce, the Project has the potential to generate positive free cash flow.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
GEOLOGY 
At June 30, 2015, the Öksüt database contained results of 330 diamond and RC drill holes for 

a total of 82,006 m.  Centerra concludes that the data, the data density, and the additional 

information from the Öksüt database are adequate to form the basis for a Mineral Resource 

estimate.  

 

A site visit to the Öksüt Project reviewed property and deposit geology, exploration and drilling 

methods and results, sampling method and approach, sample and data handling, including 

chain of custody.  A qualified geologist evaluated the compilation of QA/QC data from the 

Öksüt Project and is of the opinion that the sample preparation, security, and analytical 

procedures used by OMAS and Stratex followed industry-standard procedures and the 

resulting analytical data are acceptable for use in resource estimation.   

 

Drilling to date has been completed at an average drill hole spacing of 50 m along and across 

strike over known mineralized zones, the majority of which has been classified as Measured 

or Indicated Mineral Resources.  Drilling has not completely defined the limits of the 

mineralization at the Güneytepe Deposit, and the mineralized zones remain open along strike 

to the north.   

 

Centerra estimates the current Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources at the Öksüt 

Project to be 33.0 Mt at an average grade of 1.2 g/t Au containing 1.3 million ounces Au and 

Inferred Mineral Resources to be 2.4 Mt at an average grade of 0.8 g/t Au containing 64,000 

ounces Au.   

 

In order to comply with the CIM Definitions requirement of "reasonable prospects for eventual 

economic extraction", a preliminary Whittle pit shell was used to constrain the Mineral 

Resource estimate using process recovery of 77%, a gold price of $1,450, and other assumed 

pit parameters.  Only blocks located within the pit shell are reported in the Mineral Resource 

estimate.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 25-2 

OPEN PIT MINING 
The mineralization at the Öksüt Project that is included in this analysis comes from two 

separate deposits to be mined by open pit methods.  This mineralization is amenable to 

conventional open pit, loader/truck mining methods that will be carried out by a mining 

contractor. 

 

Utilizing the updated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, pit optimization was carried 

out on both the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits, using updated geotechnical parameters, 

updated operating costs, metallurgical recovery estimates, and a gold price of $1,250 per 

ounce.  The resulting pit shells were used as a guide in completing engineered pit designs 

which include ramps suitable for 36 tonne haul trucks consistent with other contractor mining 

operations in Turkey.  This generated an estimated Probable Mineral Reserve of 26.1 Mt at 

1.4 g/t Au containing 1.2 million ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
Test work carried out on representative samples of the deposits indicates that the Öksüt 

Project mineralization can be treated with heap leach methods.  The HLP is designed to 

process oxide ore from two open pits. 

 

The proposed Öksüt process plant design will be based on gold heap leach technology, which 

will consist of crushing, stacking, and heap leaching with cyanide solution, adsorption of the 

pregnant solution, elution, and gold smelting. 

 

FEASIBILITY STUDY RESULTS 
Financial analysis of the Öksüt Project has determined that the Project will be economically 

viable and profitable. 

 

The FS was based on open pit mining of the Keltepe and Güneytepe Deposits.  The target ore 

production rate during the life of the mine is 4.0 Mt per year. 

 

The results of the FS included the following: 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 25-3 

 Using a price of gold of $1,250 per ounce, the total after-tax undiscounted free cash 
flow is $435.9M, whereas the after-tax free cash flow discounted at 8% is $242.0M.  
The internal rate of return of the Project is 42.5% after taxes and payback is in 2.5 
years. 

 

Centerra concluded that the FS demonstrated the viability of the Öksüt Project as proposed, 

and that further development is warranted. 

 

RISKS 
Centerra has identified risks in the areas of Mineral Reserve estimation, recovery, 

geotechnical, mine plan, permitting, cost estimation, and schedule and has a mitigation plan 

for these items. 

 

MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATION RISKS 
The OksutMay2015 Mineral Resource model was used as the basis for the June 30, 2015 

Mineral Reserve estimate.  As with any mineral resource estimate, there is no guarantee that 

the model will accurately predict future gold production.  As production commences, the 

resource model will be reconciled to production and adjusted as required.  

 

RECOVERY RISKS 
The KCA Phase 3 testing program identified an unexpected variability in ore metallurgical 

properties which requires follow-up analysis and may impact the overall recovery estimate.  

Additional testing will be performed in 2016 utilizing an updated alteration model to provide 

guidance for sample selection in order to manage the unexpected variability in ore 

metallurgical properties identified in the KCA Phase 3 testing program.   

 

GEOTECHNICAL RISKS 
Geotechnical designs for the pits, heap leach pad, and waste dump are based on the available 

data.  If actual conditions differ from those currently assumed, changes to designs may be 

required, which could have an adverse effect on Project economics.  Additional data collection 

is planned throughout the construction period and the operations phase of the Project.   

 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 25-4 

MINE PLAN RISKS 
The current mine plan assumes that a mining contractor will be able to achieve the planned 

mining rates for the planned costs.  It also assumes that this contractor will be able to mine 

selectively to deliver the desired head grade to the heap leach pad, and will utilize proper 

blasting and mining techniques in order to achieve the geotechnical designs for the pit.  

Although this is common practice in Turkey, no contract has yet been signed and if a suitable 

contractor cannot be found, or the chosen contractor does not perform adequately, there could 

be an adverse effect on the project economics.  Centerra expects to work closely with the 

contractor to ensure that Project schedule cost and head grade will be maintained. 

 

PERMITTING RISKS 
Although the EIA Report has been submitted, other factors, including ongoing political 

uncertainty, may delay the EIA Report's approval.  This would result in overall Project delays 

including an inability to secure necessary permits and start construction. 

 

COST ESTIMATION RISKS 
Not all of the cost items are based on firm quotations or detailed engineering.  Several of the 

key costs items, including earthworks, road construction, electrical power distribution, and 

water handling, are based on estimates using projected unit costs.  Detailed engineering, as 

well as finalization of the procurement process, will aid in the management of the cost 

estimation risks.     

  

SCHEDULE RISKS 
The major schedule risks are due to delays caused by a number of factors including variations 

in actual equipment delivery, construction schedules, weather delays, and permitting delays.  

Detailed engineering, as well as finalization of the procurement process, contract awarding, 

and project management controls will aid in maintaining the Project schedule.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The key recommendation is to proceed with the development of the Öksüt Project in 2015 with 

the target of achieving initial gold production in Q2 2017. 

 

Additional recommendations include: 

• Implement a database management system that is capable of supporting production 
sampling. 
 

• Complete an independent audit of the assay database after implementation of a 
database management system. 
 

• Perform additional density measurements within barren material outside of the existing 
mineralization. 
 

• Survey the remaining five GPS surveyed holes with differential global positioning 
system (DGPS). 
 

• Create an alteration model using ICP data as the basis for a geo-metallurgical recovery 
model. 
 

• Evaluate the impact of using shorter composite lengths for grade estimation. 
 

• Perform a contact plot analysis to assess the need for soft, semi-soft, or hard estimation 
boundaries for high grade and low grade material. 
 

• Based on the completed geo-metallurgy recovery model, identify any gaps in the 
samples tested to date.  Using either available samples or samples from new drill holes, 
complete additional leach tests. 
 

• Conduct additional testing utilizing an updated alteration model to provide guidance for 
sample selection in order to manage the unexpected variability in ore metallurgical 
properties identified in the KCA Phase 3 testing program. 
 

• Complete a detailed leach plan and schedule utilizing the updated geo-metallurgy 
recovery model. 
 

• Complete additional geotechnical drilling for final HLP, waste dump, and other surface 
infrastructure designs, to provide enough data for detailed engineering. 
 

• As mining begins, data from pit wall mapping should be incorporated into the 
geotechnical model and pit designs adjusted accordingly. 
 



 
 

 
 Centerra Gold Inc. – Öksüt Gold Project 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – September 3, 2015 Page 26-2 

• Confirm, or re-visit, the hydrogeological assumptions after mining commences.  In case 
there are material changes to the water table assumptions, the slope stability analyses 
should be updated. 
 

• Sensitivities to mining losses and dilution should be quantified.  As mining begins, these 
assumptions should be monitored and adjusted, if necessary. 
 

• Due to the climate characteristics at the Project site, the ponds are expected to be 
empty throughout most of the year, with the majority of inflows concentrated in the 
months of March and April.  Assessment of options for protecting the geomembrane 
from exposure to natural environment would need to be considered during detailed 
design (e.g., covering the geomembrane with a protective layer of sand or gravel).
