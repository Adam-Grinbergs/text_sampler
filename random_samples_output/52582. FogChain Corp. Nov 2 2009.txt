1 SUMMARY 

Coffey Mining Pty Limited (Coffey Mining) has been requested by Mukuba Resources Limited 

(Mukuba) to complete an Independent Technical Report on Prospecting License Areas 

PLLS356 (Northcore) and PLLS363 (Lunga) in Zambia (collectively the "Project Area).  This 

report complies with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the Toronto Stock 

Exchange Manual, National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Project (NI 

43-101), Companion Policy 43-101CP to NI 43-101, and Form 43-101F1 of NI 43-101, all 

dated 2005. 

This report reviews the geology and the previous exploration activities on the project areas 

based on documentation related to the project, site visits and discussions with project 

management.  It is understood this report will be used to support the listing of Mukuba on the 

TSX Venture Exchange. 

The Project consists of two areas.  Northcore, a fully owned subsidiary of Mukuba, holds one 

Large Scale Prospecting Licenses (PLLS356) covering two separate areas with a combined 

aerial extent of 4,562.8km2.  The main area (PLLS356, centred on coordinates 

Latitude 13º 22' 36" South, Longitude 27º 36' 38" East), has it's centre some 110km west-

southwest of Ndola.  This licence has been renewed until 9 March 2010.  The other two 

smaller license areas (Part of PLLS356 and all of PLLS363) are further west, some 190km 

west-southwest of Ndola.  The Lunga area is 480km2 and is centred at Latitude 13º 42' 33" 

South and Longitude 26º 54' 12" East.  This licence needed to be renewed on 9 

September 2009.  The license renewal applications have been lodged, but due to delays at 

the ministry, the administration of new license applications is experiencing delays the renewal 

has not been processed.  The areas of all these licences will be reviewed in the near future.  

Work is on-going to ensure the renewals meet with the requirements of the new legislation 

and regulations pertaining to mineral rights in Zambia.  The Kafue and Luswishi Rivers flow 

south through the license areas, with the area to the west of the Luswishi River accessed by 

unpaved roads from Kitwe, while the area to the east is accessed by a combination of paved 

and unpaved roads from Ndola.   

The mineral properties are readily accessible for most of the year, but during the rainy season 

between December and April access will be restricted to areas with good roads.  The local 

infrastructure in Zambia is good, with transport facilities, electricity and modern social 

amenities readily available.   

Mr Lomberg carried out three site visits to the licence area and to the open pit workings over 

the period 20 – 22 June 2007, 26 – 28 August 2008 and 3 – 5 September 2009.   

1.1 Geology 

Base metal mineralisation in the Zambian Copperbelt is hosted by sedimentary rocks of the 

Neo-Proterozoic Katanga Sequence, developed within the Lufilian Arc.  The Lufilian Arc and 

Zambezi Belt form part of a network of supracrustal Pan African tectonic belts (Neoproterozoic 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  2 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

age) in Africa and South America that are host to important base metal provinces e.g. 

Katanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambian Copperbelt, Kabwe 

Zn-Pb-Ag terrane, Otavi Mountain Land Cu-Zn-Pb (Namibia), Gariep Belt Zn-Pb (Namibia) 

and the São Francisco craton Zn-Pb deposits of Brazil. 

Throughout the Central African Copperbelt, the basal Katanga Sequence rocks are underlain 

by basement granite, intermediate metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks dated at 

~1,900Ma to 2,100Ma.  The maximum age of the Katangan sedimentation is constrained by 

U-Pb dates on zircons from the Nchanga granite at 877±11Ma. 

It is postulated that extensive rifting occurred soon after the emplacement of the Nchanga 

granite.  The development of isolated structurally bounded basins in the shape of half-

graben/graben structures that controlled initial sedimentation in the lowermost portion of the 

Katanga Sequence, the Roan Group.  This basin margin configuration is especially important 

for the development of thick wedges of clastic sediments in the basal sequences composed of 

predominantly arenaceous and argillaceous rocks with relatively thin interbeds of rudaceous 

material.  The growth faults controlled prolonged and variable sedimentation into the basins. 

The basin-wide development of the Ore Shale unit (the OS1 Member of the Nchanga 

Formation), marks the first major marine transgression and represents an important marker 

that can be traced throughout the Copperbelt. 

The entire sequence is intruded by diabase and dolerite sills and dykes, ranging in age up to 

Karoo (Mesozoic) times. 

1.2 Project Area 

The licence areas are underlain by rocks of the Kundelungu, Roan and Mwashia Groups.  

Currently the open pit in the south-western corner of the licence area and the Puku Showing 

and St. Anthony in the main licence area have been identified as targets.  Other targets need 

to be generated.  The distribution, geometry, and size of such targets within the Katangan 

sequence are fundamentally controlled by basin fault architecture, the availability of both in 

situ and mobile reductants and may be linked to basin structures.   

On the Copperbelt the OS1 Member or 'Ore Shale' is 15m to 30m thick comprising well 

bedded shale and siltstone.  This unit forms an effective permeability seal and redox boundary 

above the confined footwall clastics.  The OS1 Member is often extensively sheared, veined 

and deformed, forming a schist in places.  In these instances the OS1 is well mineralised, 

comprising the deposits so characteristic of the Copperbelt. 

Higher stratigraphy in the Upper Roan Formation comprises predominantly marine deposits, 

and can be correlated over much of the Copperbelt.  Dolomite, sandstone and 

siltstone/dolomitic siltstone become increasingly dominant upward in the stratigraphy.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Gabbro intrusions are common in the Upper Roan Formation, but are also present from the 

basement through to the Mwashia Group which overlies the Roan Group. 

1.3 Deposit Types 

The central African Copperbelt is well endowed with Cu and Co.  It has sustained production 

for over 70 years, and still has significant mineral resources and reserves.  Copper (and 

cobalt) mineralisation occurs numerous stratigraphic levels.  The Copperbelt deposits are 

typically located in the Lower Roan Group occurring both below and above the level of the 

Ore Shale or Copperbelt Orebody, as well as above and below the basement contact zone. 

The Mukuba licenses in Zambia may be considered prospective for two main deposit types as 

listed below:- 

 Stratiform Cu-Co,  footwall type, hangingwall type and ore shale type, and 

 Stratabound, crosscutting, polymetallic Cu mineralisation. 

 The mineralization in the hypogene zone may be subdivided into two types of mineral 

assemblages: dominant Cu-Co sulphide assemblage and a minor Cu-U-Mo-(Au) 

assemblage. 

The "argillite-hosted" deposits of the Copperbelt Orebody Member account for almost 70% of 

deposits. 

1.4 Exploration Status 

The Project Area has been explored by a number of companies and individuals since 1950s.  

The strategy was apparently to identify areas of interest (anomalies) and to investigate them 

individually.  The available information is typically fragmented, but indicates that many 

anomalies were identified, though few were followed up due to limited resources and financial 

uncertainty.  No systematic exploration of the area has been carried out since the 1980's.  A 

prospecting open pit was excavated by the previous tenement holders on the Lunga licence 

area.   

Mukuba's strategy is to confirm the previous geological interpretation provided by government 

maps and previous tenement holders using a combination of the critical examination of 

historic data, the latest geophysical techniques and an extensive mapping and soil sampling 

campaign.  This will allow the delineation of anomalies or targets for subsequent investigation 

and drilling.   

1.5 Current Exploration 

Mukuba has drilled six diamond drill holes (DD) immediately adjacent to the pit at Kantobo 

(2007).  The results three drill hole have been received confirming the presence of copper 

mineralisation.  The assays values are however considered low.   



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  4 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

In addition Mukuba has completed a total of five soil sampling programmes within the western 

license areas.  The results confirm the presence of high concentrations of base metals in the 

soil.  The identified anomalies still need to be fully investigated. 

The initial focus of the exploration was the undertaking of the Versatile Time Domain 

Electromagnetic (VTEM) geophysical survey and regional soil sampling.  The geological 

survey has largely confirmed the published geological data.  A number of potential targets 

have been identified but require validation and prioritization prior to the application of 

traditional exploration methods.  Subsequently a re-interpretation of the geophysical and 

geochemical data by SRK Consulting (Australasia) (SRK) has provided a new structural 

model which infers more Lower Roan/Basement contact zones as well as structural hosts for 

copper mineralization.  The re-interpretation of all the data completed by SRK is summarized 

here in the 43-101 but is not fully disclosed due to its technically sensitive nature.  A number 

of new targets have been developed from this interpretation.   

The regional soil sampling has been undertaken on the western side of the Northcore License 

area across the Lower Roan Contact.  Initial indications are that anomalies base metal 

concentrations are present in the soil.  The source of the anomalies has yet to be 

investigated.   

The VTEM survey completed in 2008 highlighted 21 conductors and potential target areas for 

further follow-up.  Of these targets, eight were interpreted to be less than 100m below surface.  

Ranking of the target areas was based on a combination of coincident VTEM/aeromagnetics 

response, geology host rock, soil geochemistry and conductor depth below surface.  Seven 

target areas were selected for drill testing in 2009.   

The testing of some targets has been undertaken with drilling in July – August 2009.  The 

drilling consists 107.00m Reverse Circulation (RC) and 1,606.14m DD from13 drill holes: 

2 RC and 11 DD) for a total of 1,713.14m was completed to test various targets in seven

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Northcore has completed an integration of all the available data.  This work undertaken by 

SRK Consulting (Australasia) included a review of Landsat imagery, geochemical, 

geophysical (aeromagnetic) data and the data generated by the VTEM survey in 2008.  This 

integration has generated 15 targets that require on the ground work.   

1.6 Exploration Results 

The whole lease area has been subdivided into a number of areas or prospects.  The main 

lease area has been subdivided into four quadrants namely North East, South East, North 

West and South West Prospects.  Below is a summary of the knowledge of each of these 

prospects 

1.6.1 Kantobo Prospect 

The Kantobo Prospect is underlain by stratigraphically younger Kundulungu sediments of the 

Katanga Sequence.  The area was previously exploited for secondary copper mineralization 

hosted in a brecciated, saprolitic phyllite zone. 

The detailed soil geochemical grids completed in 2007 did not indicate any significant lateral 

extensions to the Kantobo prospect.  Detailed soil sampling in the SW corner of the license 

block confirmed the historically identified copper/zinc in soil anomaly striking NW towards the 

Wambo target area on the Lunga Prospect area (Nthere license – PLLS363). 

The six drill holes drilled by Northcore in 2007 (722.63m) confirmed the presence of copper 

mineralisation.  The assays from drill hole KTM003 returned peak values of 0.77% Cu over an 

interval of 0.20m (Quartz vein) and 0.70% Cu over 1.00m from a depth of 44.20m and an 

intersection of 0.47% Cu over 14.00m from a depth of 41.00m.  Assay results from drill hole 

KTM004 returned a maximum intersection value of 0.16% Cu over 3.00m from a depth of 

93.00m.  Drill hole KTM006 returned a peak value of 0.79% Cu over 1.00m from a depth of 

50.00m and maximum intersection value of 0.47% Cu over 3.00m from a depth of 49.00m. 

Based on the results of the work carried out to date, the Lunga Prospect is not considered to 

be a priority when compared to the potential of the Northcore licence area 

1.6.2 North West Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 202km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies underlies the North West Quadrant 

Prospects.  This includes over 61 linear km of Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  These 

contact zones have been covered by regional soil geochemical traverses spaced approx. 1km 

apart.  Seven historical geochemical targets are located within the prospect area and have 

been covered by soil sample lines with moderate to anomalous values being returned. 

The VTEM survey in 2008 identified two possible drill sites (#01 and #20) in two separate 

target areas (1a and 1b) with moderate soil geochemical coincidence.  At least three soil 

geochemical targets have been identified north of the area covered by the 2008 VTEM 

survey.  Additional sampling will be considered to confirm the lateral extent of one target area 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  7 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

into the Basement lithologies from the Upper Roan, possibly indicating mineralization along a 

geological structure. 

A detailed aeromagnetic / radiometric survey is planned to cover the northern portion of the 

project area. 

1.6.3 North East Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 425km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies and over 47km2 of undifferentiated Lower 

Roan rocks underlies the North East Quadrant Prospects.  This includes over 74 linear km of 

Basement/Lower Roan contact zone 

The prospect area was not covered by VTEM or completely by soil traverses during the 2008 

field season.   

The Kapilamikwa and Tomato showings were excavated by artisanal miners presumably for 

"gemstones" that are located within this project area.  A detailed grid was completed over the 

Tomato showing.  However, no indication of copper mineralization was detected.  Grab rock 

samples from both the Kapilamikwa and Tomato showings did not return any copper 

mineralization. 

The 2009 field season is covered the contact zone of the Basement/Lower Roan and Upper 

Roan lithologies with regional soil sampling and geological mapping.  Aeromagnetic and 

radiometric survey is planned to cover the project area. 

A single historical geochemical target (1) locates within the project area 

1.6.4 South East Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 333km
2
 of Lower Roan host lithologies underlies the South East Quadrant 

Prospects.  This includes over 26 linear km of Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  

Basement/Lower Roan/Upper Roan contact zones were covered by regional soil 

geochemical, traverses spaced approximately 1km apart.  Nine historical geochemical targets 

are located within the prospect area and have been covered by soil sample lines and returned 

poor to highly anomalous values.  Grab rock samples returned a maximum copper value of 

0.31% from a sample in close proximity to proposed drill hole #15.   

The Northern portion of the license area was not covered by the 2008 VTEM survey.  The 

VTEM survey in 2008 identified nine possible drill sites (#6 - #10, #15 - #18) in four separate 

target areas (5 – 8) with poor to highly anomalous coincident soil geochemical responses and 

underlain by interpreted stratigraphically younger Mwashia Group lithologies (Mainly shale).   

The target was drill tested with drill hole NC008 which intersected carbonaceous, graphitic 

shale from surface with well developed pyrite stringers. 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  8 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

1.6.5 South West Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 315km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies and over 308km2 of undifferentiated Lower 

Roan rocks underlies the South West Quadrant Prospects.  This includes over 33 linear km of 

Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  The detailed soil geochemical grid over the South West 

Quadrant Prospects demonstrated lateral extensions to the SE.  Basement/Lower 

Roan/Upper Roan contact zones covered by regional soil geochemical, traverses spaced 

approx. 1km apart with encouraging results and closely associated with the VTEM target 

areas. 

The historical trenches at the Puku Showing exposed a silicified, gossanous fault zone, grab 

rock sample returned 1.57% Cu.  Nine trenches were excavated along a strike length of 

approximately 330m.  A maximum value of 2,120ppm Cu over 1m from weathered graphitic 

shale horizon confirms the overlying soil geochemical sampling across the area that returned 

a peak value of 103ppm Cu.  Shallow pits and trenches located NW of Puku were sampled.  

No copper mineralization was detected from the mainly quartz vein material exposed by 

artisanal gemstone prospectors.  Four historical geochemical targets located within the 

prospect area and covered by soil sample lines and returned poor to moderate copper values. 

The VTEM survey in 2008 identified ten possible drill sites (#2 - #5, #11 – #14, #19 and #21) 

in four separate target areas (2a, 2b, 3 and 4) with poor to anomalous coincident soil 

geochemical responses and underlain primarily by Lower Roan lithologies.   

Target #3 was drilled (Drill holes: NC003, NC004 and NC005) in 2009.  The drill holes 

confirmed a mineralized, brecciated fault zone at depth, dipping towards the north that had 

been exposed on surface in the trenches.  Peak copper concentrations of 0.17% (NC003) 

over 1m, 0.25% (NC004) over 1m and 0.14% (NC005) were intersected.   

1.7 Planned Exploration 

Mukuba's two year exploration strategy for the area is as follows:- 

 Continued examination of existing historical exploration records to consolidate data and 

to identify potential targets areas. 

 Target Generation via satellite imagery, and airborne geophysical surveys and through 

mapping and soil and rock chip sampling. 

 Evaluate the most prospective deposits targets and mineral occurrences by means of 

trenching and drilling. 

 Drill and sample most prospective occurrences.   

The emphasis in the next phase of the project will be the evaluation of the various targets that 

have been generated and the drilling of the most prospective targets.   

1.8 Mineral Resources and Reserves 

No mineral resources or reserves have been estimated on the license area.   



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  9 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

1.9 Conclusions 

The Mukuba license holdings in Zambia are extensive and cover significant strike of 

prospective ground adjacent to major producing or past-producing mines.  The licenses 

potentially contain significant endowments of Cu-Co.   

The primary target area is the Lower Roan lithologies, and particularly the contact zone with 

the basement.  The published Zambian Geological Survey maps indicate that near surface or 

exposed within the license areas there are 3,700km2 of Lower Roan lithologies, and 130 linear 

kilometres of basement contact zone. 

No Mineral Reserves or Resources have been reported for the Project Area. 

Coffey Mining considers that the exploration strategy adopted is appropriate for the 

Copperbelt style of mineralisation and that the work conducted to date is in line with this 

strategy.  The exploration undertaken has been in accordance with the defined strategy.  The 

exploration has confirmed the underlying geology and validated the approach being 

undertaken.  In addition the information gained has improved the understanding of the 

geology and provided confidence that anomalies will be found that potentially could be 

advanced by diamond drilling.  Coffey Mining considers the Exploration Budget 

(USD 3,371,706) to be appropriate for the recommended work over the next two years and 

with the anticipated style of mineralisation.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Background Information on the Republic of Zambia 

4.1.1 Demographics and Geographic Setting 

Zambia is an independent state with a surface area of 752,614km2, situated in south central 

Africa.  It is a landlocked country bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania 

to the north, Angola to the west, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to the south and 

Malawi to the east (Figure 4.1.1_1).  It is a member of the Southern African Development 

Community (SADC). 

Figure 4.1.1_1 
Map of the Republic of Zambia 

 

The capital of Zambia is Lusaka, which is situated roughly in the centre of the country.  The 

Zambian population is approximately 11.9 million (The CIA World Fact Book, July 2009).  The 

population consists of predominantly African people (98.7%) with some European (1.1%) and 

other ethic groups (0.2%).  With an adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of 16.5% (2003 estimate), 

AIDS is considered to be having a significant impact on the life expectancy and mortality rates 

of the adult population. 

English is the official language with as many as 70 indigenous languages.  The English 

literacy rate is estimated to be 80.6% (2003 estimate).

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

4.1.2 Political and Financial Status 

Despite the Portuguese being active along the coast of Africa in the 16th century and the 

importance of the slave trade elsewhere in Africa, Zambia remained fairly isolated until 1851 

when David Livingstone explored the area. 

The South African Company (SAC) of Cecil John Rhodes made private treaties with African 

tribes allowing the SAC the right to prospect for, and exploit, minerals.  Zambia (then Northern 

Rhodesia and Northwestern Rhodesia) was proclaimed a British protectorate in 1911. 

Only a small number of Europeans actually came to live in the new protectorate of Northern 

Rhodesia.  By 1914 there were only about 3,000, most of them involved in farming. 

After 1930 the British adopted a policy of indirect rule whereby African chiefs were given a 

role in local administration.  After the riots in the Copperbelt in 1935 the government formed 

urban advisory councils to give urban Africans an 'advisory' role in the way their towns were 

run.  This was to be the beginning of the process that would ultimately lead to independence 

in 1964. 

Zambia became independent on 24 October 1964 with Kenneth Kaunda as president.  There 

were only about 100 native Zambians with university degrees, resulting in a lack of qualified 

people to run the country.  Zambia lacked infrastructure and schools.  Some 90% of Zambia's 

foreign earnings were from copper.  The government development plan for 1965-69 sought to 

address these issues by allocating significant resources to the public sector (health, 

infrastructure and also to a lesser extent education). 

The economy of Zambia expanded rapidly after independence, fuelled by higher copper 

prices in the 1960s.  The copper industry was nationalised in 1972.  After 1974 the price of 

copper dropped, severely affecting the largely copper dependent economy and increasing the 

national debt.  By the mid 1980s Zambia was forced to accept IMF adjustment programmes, 

including reductions in the government sector.  Increased unemployment and rampant 

inflation lead to drastically reduced standards of living. 

Facing increasing opposition from churches and unions, the UNIP government called a multi 

party election in October 1991.  The Movement for Multi Party Democracy (MMD) won 125 

out of 150 seats and in the Presidential election Frederick Chiluba won 81% of the vote.  The 

new government abandoned many of the UNIP policies and embarked on a program of 

privatising state owned industries and mines between 1994 and 2000.  The economy grew 

sporadically during this period. 

By the end of the 20th century Zambia remained an impoverished country.  Most of the 

citizens survived as subsistence farmers.  Copper and cobalt mining remained the most 

important industry but there was also some mining of other metals such as silver, zinc, lead 

and gemstones.  There is very little industry except hydro-electric power generation, cement 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  15 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

making and a chemicals industry.  The potential of tourism with its national parks including the 

Victoria Falls, remains relatively untapped. 

Elections held in 2001 were marred by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal 

petition challenging the election of ruling party (MMD) candidate Levy Mwanawasa.  The new 

president launched a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign in 2002, which resulted in the 

prosecution of former President Frederick Chiluba and many of his supporters in late 2003.  

The Presidential prosecution was unsuccessful.  Opposition parties currently hold a majority 

of seats in the National Assembly.  President Mwanawasa passed away on 19 August 2008.  

A period of 21 days of official mourning began.  Presidential elections were held in October 

2008 with Acting President Banda being elected as the president for the remainder of 

Mwanawasa's term.  Banda won the by-elections on the ruling MMD ticket by promising a 

continuation of Mwanawasa's policies, which have been credited for the strong economic 

development in the past decade.  New elections are planned for 2011.   

In April 2005 Zambia qualified for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), with a 

total foreign debt of US$7 billion.  Once debt cancellation under HIPC is completed, almost 

US$6 billion in debt will be eliminated.  In December 2005 a bilateral debt agreement between 

the U.S.  and Zambian Governments was signed for the cancellation of debt worth US$280 

million.   

In November 2006 when the IMF conducted a periodic economic review under a three - year 

Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, the Fund commended Zambia's macroeconomic 

stability and continued fiscal discipline, but noted lags in the implementation of some reform 

measures.  In 2006, the rate of inflation dropped to single digits for the first time in recent 

history.   

The economy remains heavily dependent on the copper mining industry which contributes 

some 71% to exports.  In 2008 the GDP (purchasing power parity) was estimated at 

US$17.39 billion, per capita GDP was US$1,500 with a real growth rate of 5.8%.  Zambia 

earned US$4,818 billion (2008 estimate) from exports of copper, cobalt, electricity, tobacco, 

flowers and cotton.  The current exchange rate of the Zambian currency, Kwacha (ZKW), is 

4,800 ZKW/US$ (30 September 2009). 

There are no exchange controls in Zambia applicable to businesses, residents or non-

residents.  Profits from companies incorporated in Zambia are taxed at 35%.  An investor who 

qualifies in one of the five categories will be entitled, in addition to the general incentives, to 

an exemption from customs duties and sales duties on all machinery and equipment (other 

than motor vehicles) required for the establishment, rehabilitation or expansion of that 

enterprise. 

The Zambian government has established the Zambia's Investment Centre under the 

Government's "Open Door" policy to encourage and support investment in the Zambia by 

foreign nationals.  Various initiatives are made available to foreign investors including 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  16 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

providing information, obtaining approvals, formation of local and foreign companies and 

establishment of joint ventures with indigenous Zambian companies as well as sourcing of 

short-term and long-term equity and loan finance. 

4.1.3 Mining Industry 

Archaeological evidence suggests mining has occurred in Zambia for the last thousand years, 

and refined copper has been exported to Asia, the Middle East and Europe for at least 

400 years.  Zambia is internationally recognised as a major producer of copper and cobalt.   

The Zambian Copperbelt is one of the most important metallogenic provinces in the world 

containing massive reserves of Cu-Co material as well as gold, uranium, nickel, lead-zinc, iron 

and manganese.  It is presently the world's ninth largest producer of copper and has around 

4% of the world's known reserves.  High quality gemstone deposits abound, including 

emeralds, amethysts, aquamarine, rubies, garnets and diamonds, which are still largely 

unexploited. 

Peak production of copper occurred in 1969, when 720,000t of copper was produced.  This 

made Zambia the world's fourth largest copper producer at the time.  However, production 

has declined drastically since the mid 1970s due to low copper prices and lack of investment.  

Zambia is currently the world's ninth largest copper producer (Gold Field Mineral Services, 

2008).  Despite this decline, copper and cobalt mining still contributes 8% of Zambia's GDP, 

representing 79% of export earnings (Reuters).  Zambia produced 275,000t copper in 2000 

compared to an estimated 544,000t in 2008.  Cobalt production totalled 9,300t in 2005 and 

7,000t in 2008 (estimated). 

Zambia is ranked as the world's ninth largest producer of copper, generating 4% (2008) of the 

world's production (Figure 4.1.3_1), and is the world's fourth largest producer of cobalt (4%) 

(2008). 

As the country has little downstream industry, the copper is exported as copper bars to the 

USA, Japan, France, Malaysia, India, UK, Belgium, Thailand, Italy, China and Indonesia. 

Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the State-owned conglomerate and indisputably 

the dominant entity in the country's economy, reached its final phase of privatisation in 1999. 

In 1998 the output of copper fell to a low of 228,000t, after a 30-year decline in output due to 

lack of investment, low copper prices, and uncertainty over privatization.  Privatization of 

government-owned copper mines stemmed mounting losses, and combined with recent high 

copper prices, has improved the profitability of copper mining, which is now once more driving 

economic growth.  Following privatization of the industry, copper production rebounded due to 

higher copper prices and the opening of new mines.  Copper output has increased steadily 

with 454,000t produced in 2004 and 582,000t in 2007.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

In early 2002, Anglo American Corporation (AAC) announced it would no longer fund its 

investment in Konkola Copper Mines Plc (KCM).  This included the development of the huge 

Konkola Deep Mining Project (KDMP) which has mineral reserves estimated at 3.4Mt at 

2.69% copper and mineral resources of 131Mt at 3.84% (KCM Annual Resource and 

Reserves Report, 2003).  The Konkola Deep expansion would make it the world's largest 

underground copper mine. 

Following AAC's decision not to proceed with further investment in KCM, a Government Task 

Force was established to consider options available to keep KCM going.  In 2005, the London 

based mining company Vedanta Resources plc become the main stakeholder and operator of 

the KCM. 

In addition, agreements on the sale of the Nkana mine (excluding the smelter) and Mufulira 

mine were also reached between the government and a joint venture between First Quantum

Copper Mine Production: Zambia (Tonnage)



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  18 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

 

 

The Maamba Colliery is Zambia's only operating coal mine.  Capacity at the mine is around 

500,000 tonnes per annum, but production has declined to around 300,000 tonnes per annum 

at present.  Privatisation of the colliery is in progress. 

Alluvial diamonds have been found throughout western Zambia.  The government has issued 

several prospecting licenses in four regions to prospecting companies that are looking for the 

primary sources of the country's diamonds. 

Zambia has uranium deposits in a variety of geological environments.  The Mkana mine 

produced uranium oxide from 1957 to 1959.  Since that time, exploration has been carried out 

in various sites and vein and disseminated mineralisation has been located in the footwall 

rocks of the Lower and Upper Roan Sequences of the Copperbelt and Domes region in 

northwest Zambia. 

Until 1999, the parastatal Zambian National Oil Company (ZNOC) handled all the supply of 

fuel products to Zambia.  Since that time, the government has developed several licenses for 

the importation and distribution of petroleum products.  Five international oil companies are 

presently operating in the country. 

To ensure the mining sector continues to contribute to economic growth in Zambia, the 

government is implementing various enabling measures.  These include mining tax incentives 

extending relief to all mining companies involved in the production of copper and cobalt and 

reducing production costs for mining companies, starting with a reduction in excise duty on 

diesel and electricity.  The Zambian taxation structure for mining companies was revamped in 

April 2008.  The Royalty on Copper Sales ("Windfall Tax") was abolished in March 2009.  A 

summary prepared by KPMG is presented in Table 4.1.3_1.

4.1.4 World Financial Crisis 

The financial crisis has an impact on Zambia in various ways.   

 The most significant impact has been as a result of the depressed copper and cobalt 

prices which constitute some 79% of total exports.  Zambia's economy grew close to 6% 

in 2008, but is expected to retract by 1%-2% in 2009. 

 The kwacha depreciated strongly as the copper prices decreased, which will push the 

prices of imported fuel and food up.   

 Zambia's short term financing requirements are significant.  On the back of debt relief in 

2005 and improving economics, Zambia created an adequate solvency position and 

improving liquidity position.  However, short-term financing requirements are significant 

and buffers are weakening.   

 Concern exists that donors may scale back on donor aid, a significant portion of Zambia's 

fiscal budget.   

4.1.5 Mining Tenure 

The Mines and Minerals Development Bill of 2008 replaced the under the Mines and Minerals 

Act No 31 of 1995.  In Zambia all rights for exploring and mining minerals are vested in the 

State.  Prospecting must be carried out under a mining right granted in terms of The Mines 

and Minerals Development Bill of 2008.  Seven types of licenses are issued under this Act 

(Table 4.1.5_1).  A revision of The Mines and Minerals Development Bill of 2008 was made in 

form of The Mines and Minerals Development Bill (amendment) of No 9 of 2009.  The only 

change is the removal of the restriction of the issuing of a mining right to a Zambian citizen or 

citizen owed company.   

A summary of the cost of licences is presented in Table 4.1.5_2.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

New license applications will need to be lodged with the Ministry of Mines (Registry of Mining 

Rights) for compliance with the new Mines and Minerals Development Act, 2008.  The 

deadline for submission is now December 2009.

4.2 Property Description and Location 

The licence areas are not contiguous.  The main area (PLLS356) has its centre some 110km 

west-southwest of Ndola (Figure 3.1.1_1).  The other two smaller license areas (Part of 

PLLS356 and all of PLLS363) are further west, some 190km west-southwest of Ndola.  

License holdings are summarised in Table 3.3_1.  The licence areas straddle the Copperbelt 

and Central Province border.  All permits required for the purpose of conducting mineral 

exploration on the properties have been obtained.   

The Kafue and Luswishi Rivers flow south through the license areas, with the area to the west 

of the Luswishi River accessed by unpaved roads from Kitwe, while the area to the east is 

accessed by a combination of paved and unpaved roads from Ndola.   

The surface rights within the licence areas are predominantly held by the government as 

Forest Reserve or Game Management areas namely Lunga Luswishi Game management 

Area No.7, Lumba Block B National Forest No.18, Machiya Fungulwe Game management 

Area No.23, Luembe National Forest No.212 and Ipumbu National Forest No.349.  As a result 

there the area is generally uninhabited and infrequently cultivated or used as grazing. 

The prospecting areas are strategically situated in one of the world's most important copper 

metallogenic provinces, Copperbelt Province of Zambia, comprising ground primarily 

prospective for base metals (Cu-Co).

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

4.3 License Status 

The details of the licences to which Mukuba has a right are summarised in Table 4.3_1 and 

shown in Figure 4.3_1.  There is currently no requirement in Zambian law to erect corner point 

beacons or other boundary markers; these boundaries are defined by a listing of coordinates 

and a location plan included in the license documents.   

The location of mineralised zones relative to the property boundaries is unknown or uncertain 

at this time.  There are no mineral resources, mineral reserves or mine workings, tailings 

ponds, waste deposits or other important natural features or improvements on the properties. 

Northcore, a fully owned subsidiary of Mukuba, holds one Large Scale Prospecting Licenses 

(PLLS356) covering two separate areas with a combined aerial extent of 4,562.8km2.  

Northcore has the sole and exclusive right to explore, evaluate and develop its properties in 

the Republic of Zambia subject to the requirements of The Mines and Minerals Development 

Bill of 2008 until 9 March 2010.  These areas were part of a larger licence area (PLLS356), 

which upon renewal on 30 April 2008 for a further 2 year period, required the relinquishment 

of 50% of the area to comply with the new Mines and Minerals Development Bill of 2008.  The 

extent of the previous licences is presented in Figure 5.6_1.  The area relinquished consists of 

areas considered to have low geological prospectivity and so their loss has not materially 

affected the exploration potential of the project as a whole.   

The Lunga licence (PLLS363) is held by Reuben Nthere.  Mukuba has the right to investigate 

up to preliminary feasibility, thereby earning an 80% interest in the area through a farm-in 

agreement.  The license expiry is 9 September 2009.  Reuben Nthere has the right to extend 

the period for a further two periods of two years each, but may be required to reduce each 

area by up to 50% at each renewal (at the discretion of the Minister).  The license renewal 

applications have been lodged, but due to delays at the ministry, the administration of new 

license applications is experiencing delays the renewal has not been processed.

4.4 Royalties and Agreements 

Coffey Mining is not aware of any royalties, back-in rights, payments or other encumbrances 

that could prevent Mukuba from carrying out its exploration work plans or the trading of its 

rights to its license holdings in Zambia.  The reader should refer to Table 4.2.3_1 for rates and 

types of taxation. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities 

The surface rights within the licence areas are predominantly held by the government as 

Forest Reserve or Game Management areas namely Lunga Luswishi Game management 

Area No.7, Lumba Block B National Forest No.18, Machiya Fungulwe Game management 

Area No.23, Luembe National Forest No.212 and Ipumbu National Forest No.349.  It is 

understood that provided the environmental impact assessment addresses the necessary 

issues, the government will not be adverse to localised mine development.   

An exploration pit has been excavated by the previous tenement holders (PLLS356) 

(Figure 4.5_1).  No mining has been carried out by or on behalf of Mukuba in Zambia.

Mukuba is bound to conduct its business activities in compliance with the environmental 

requirements of The Mines and Minerals Development Bill of 2008.  Mukuba is required to 

provide a project brief to the Director of Mines Safety describing the site, proposed activities 

and all aspects of potential environmental impact.  Environmental audits of project are 

required to be completed annually.  Developers of large scale mining projects are required to 

contribute to the Environmental Management Fund for rehabilitation purposes. 

Figure 4.5_1 
Photograph of Exploration Pit Excavated by the Previous Tenement Holders (PLLS356) 

Aspect: Looking North 

 

Mukuba through its subsidiary Northcore, is committed to conducting all prospecting activities 

in accordance with the provisions of the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act 

1990 and its Statutory Instrument No.  28 of 1997 (Environmental Impact Assessment 

Regulations) and the Mines and Minerals Act (2008) and its Statutory Instrument No.  29 of 

1997 (Mines and Minerals Environmental Regulations).  Northcore has also undertaken 

measures to ensure that any external consultants or contractors used by the Company are 

fully aware of that they are bound contractually to operate in accordance with this Zambian 

legislation.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Project Access 

The Kafue and Luswishi Rivers flow south through the license areas, with the area to the west 

of the Luswishi River accessed by unpaved roads from Kitwe, while the area to the east is 

accessed by a combination of paved and unpaved roads from Ndola. 

Access in Zambia is reasonably good, with a network of paved roads connecting most regions 

and unpaved roads and tracks providing access to the exploration areas.  Roads are 

maintained to varying degrees, and some portions of the paved road network are prone to 

deteriorate during the rainy season.  Unpaved roads are susceptible to rutting and erosion in 

the rainy season, but are usually adequately graded and maintained on an annual basis. 

Access to target areas and drill sites within the license, is usually by poorly maintained tracks, 

and during the rainy season these require four wheel drive vehicles. 

There are international airports at Lusaka and Ndola which are easily accessible by 

commercial flights from neighbouring countries, and regional airports at Kitwe and Chingola.  

In addition, the use of small charter aircraft is common. 

The rail network in Zambia operates reasonably efficiently, although the tracks are poorly 

maintained. 

5.2 Land Use 

The surface area within which the combined mineral licenses fall are preserved national 

forests (natural forest reserve), game management areas and small scale subsistence 

farming plots.   The main agricultural practice is slash and burn subsistence agriculture with 

minor cattle ranching.   Small villages are ubiquitous along the major arterial routes through 

the region. 

The game management areas are managed by Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA).  Within 

these areas wildlife is protected to secure important wildlife, habitats and ecosystems.  Strict 

controlled license hunting is allowed to encourage tourism and give the local population a 

possibility of generating incomes from selling licensed game meat.  At present ZAWA is not 

actively managing the areas within the licences and has no personnel at the sites.  Hence, the 

number of game within the area has reduced due to poaching.   

The three National Forests No.  18 Lamba (Block B and C), No.  349 Ipumbu and No.  212 

Luembe are located within the license area.  National Forests are permanent forest areas that 

are reserved and managed by the state for the conservation and development of forests with 

a view to securing supplies of timber and other forest produce, providing protection against 

floods, erosion and desiccation and maintaining the flow of rivers.   



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  29 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Farming activities within the license area are mainly taking place on the eastern side of the 

Kafue River where the two major farms Kampemba and Somawhe are located.  Medium and 

small scale farming is taking place in the villages that are scattered throughout the license 

area.  Major crops cultivated are soya, maize, wheat, groundnuts and jatropha.   

Fishing is mainly taking place from villages located along the banks of the Kafue- and 

Luswishi rivers. 

A small portion of the eastern side of the license area falls within Trust Land No.11.  Mukuba 

has experienced no difficulty in acquiring land owner access and consent through visits to the 

chief/headmen in the area. 

Mine development in Zambia will require the acquisition of surface rights through the 

purchase of 99 year leases from the Ministry of Lands, which is predominantly an 

administrative procedure with established precedents. 

5.3 Physiography and Climate 

Zambia has a sub-tropical climate dominated by a high plateau with subordinate hills and 

mountains.  The Zambezi River flows through the western side of the country and forms the 

boundary with Zimbabwe where it flows into Lake Kariba.  The Luapula River flows 

northwards along the DRC boundary into Lake Mweru and then Lake Tanganyika.  The 

highest point is in the Mafinga Hills in the NE (2,301m amsl) and the lowest point on the 

Zambezi River (329m amsl).   

The licenses are located on gently undulating topography with a mean elevation of some 

1,180m amsl.  The highest point is 1,424m amsl and the lowest point 1,130m amsl.   

The climate is sub-tropical with three main seasons:- 

Cool and Dry:  April to August 

Hot and Dry:  August to November 

Warm and Wet: November to April 

The major drainage system in the Central and Copperbelt provinces of Zambia is the Kafue 

River.  The Zambia-DRC border forms a regional watershed between rivers flowing to the 

Kafue River and ultimately to the Zambezi River in the south, and rivers flowing toward the 

Congo River in the north. 

Rainfall decreases from north to south within the subregion.  Superimposed on this general 

pattern are local variations due to relief or proximity to large bodies of water.  The central 

parts of Zambia have an average annual rainfall of 1,000mm to 1,500mm, while the rainfall in 

the southern part of Zambia is between 600mm and 1,000mm annually.  The length of the 

rainy season decreases towards the south, varying from 190 days in the central parts of 

Zambia to 120 days in the south. 



Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  30 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The seasonal peak of the rains throughout the country is in January; although in the northern-

most parts of Zambia it has two maxima: one in December and other in March (Table 5.3_1).   

Between November and March most field work is restricted to areas serviced by good roads, 

effectively limiting exploration over much of the sub-region.  The Kabwe area, where much of 

the area is underlain by carbonate rocks, remains waterlogged well into May. 

The mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures at Ndola vary from 8°C and 26° (July) 

to 17° and 32°C (October) (Table 5.3_1).  The hottest months are September to November 

when the mean daily temperature is typically in the region of 31° to 32°.  These temperature 

ranges do not hamper field work in the subregion.

5.4 Flora and Fauna 

The Miombo woodland, a two-storey closed semi-evergreen woodland, is the most extensive 

vegetation type in the license area.  The main upper-storey dominant species are 

Brachystegia, Isoberlinia, Julbernardia and Marquesia macroura.  The lower storey is 

structurally less well defined but is floristically more diverse.  In the lower storey it can be 

found either a 0.6-1.3 m grass and a subshrub layer or dense evergreen thickets reaching 

heights of about 3.5m.  The woodland is economically important for the supply of  timber, 

poles, firewood and charcoal.  It is also the source of many nonwood forest products such as 

honey, mushrooms, caterpillars and other edible insects. 

A number of dambos or patches of swamp forests are present in the area.  Some are very rich 

in species while others consist of just one species namely Musombo or Syzygium cordatum.  

Since the soils cannot be used for cultivation people do not make much use of these areas, 

and rarely enter them. 

Interviews with local villagers ascertained that none of the major predators or grazers has 

recently been seen within the area.  Local villagers reported that the number of wildlife has 

decreased due to poaching.  Species that may be seen are Bushbuck, Common Duiker, 

Impala and Kudu.  According to the local villagers a more diverse number of species can be 

seen in the Lunga – Luswishi Game Management Area west of the Luswishi River.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The bird fauna is quite diverse within the area, especially along the rivers.  Along the rivers 

birds from the families Storks, Cranes, Herons and Cormorants are found.  The drier 

woodland areas host common bird families such as; Doves, Pigeons, Parrots, Cuckoos, Owls, 

Nightjars, Kingfishers, Hornbills, Woodpeckers, Swallows and Larks. 

The rivers within the area host a rich fish population dominated by different species of 

breams.  Some of the more important species for human consumption are: Three Spotted 

Tilapia, Longfin Tilapia, Redbreast Tilapia, and Barbel/Catfish.   

A wide variety of frogs, lizards and snakes occur within the area.  The rivers within the area 

host a large population of crocodiles. 

5.5 Local Infrastructure and Services 

Access to and within the exploration license area is readily achieved by motor vehicle.  Paved 

roads connect the major towns and unpaved roads provide secondary access.  During the 

height of the rainy season and particularly after heavy rainfall, some of the smaller unpaved 

tracks accessing the license area may become impassable for several days at time. 

Copper and cobalt mining has been extensive in the Zambian Copperbelt.  As a result, local 

resources and infrastructure close to major Copperbelt towns in Zambia are generally good.   

Telecommunications in Zambia are expensive and land lines are often of poor quality.  

Cellular (Mobile) telephone coverage is good in most developed regions of the Zambian 

Copperbelt.  Remote regions such as the licence area are not currently provided with cellular 

telephone coverage and will require mobile satellite communications until other 

telecommunications are provided to the area.  Connections to the Internet are available in 

most major towns in Zambia. 

Fuel (diesel and leaded petrol) are readily available although shortages have been 

experienced during the last few years.  Unleaded petrol is available in some Zambian towns. 

The license areas are not close to electrical infrastructure. 

Zambia has a long history of mining and skilled workers are readily available.  Tertiary 

academic and technical training facilities are available in Zambia.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Background Information 

The central African region is endowed with some of the world's largest ore bodies, hosting 

copper, cobalt, zinc, lead, tin, gold, silver, niobium, tantalium diamonds and uranium.  The 

oxide zones of many of the deposits currently being mined and explored were exploited by 

indigenous artisanal workers long before the first wave of explorers and colonialisation 

reached the central African interior in the 1880s. 

Large base metal orebodies were discovered in first half of the 20th Century.  However 

political and ideological factors curtailed continued investment in management, maintenance, 

exploration, research and development. 

Parts of the project area have been explored by a number of companies and individuals over 

the last century.  Much of the historical exploration and mining information is not readily 

available today due mainly to poor administration of the state archives.  As is normally the 

case in areas with long exploration histories, much of the historical information was collected 

before standards such as the Canadian NI 43 - 101 and Australian JORC were published and 

widely followed, and much of the information has been gleaned from plans, reports, etc., that 

cannot be verified and audited in the way that these codes would require. 

Specifically, information regarding quality assurance and control measures of analytical data 

is generally not available, nor was data captured electronically, and seldom in detail.  For 

example, average intersection values are often marked on plans, but individual analytical 

intervals are not available. 

Although it is considered that much of the historical information probably has a high degree of 

integrity, it is impossible to verify most of it because the core and other sample material is no 

longer available.

6.2 Exploration by Previous Owners 

During the early 1900s Northern Zambia was prospected by individuals under license from the 

British South Africa Company.  From 1926 - 40 the Concession Companies covered large 

areas of the country with controlled geological traverses.  Mineralised outcrops were noted, 

and subsequently prospected in more detail by phased exploration consisting of pitting, infill 

pitting and drilling. 

By the late 1940s the Copperbelt was divided into concessions or grants awarded to the 

Rhodesian Selection Trust (RST) (managed by AMAX) and Chartered Exploration (managed 

by Anglo American Corporation).  Exploration by both companies comprised of aerial 

photograph interpretation, field traverses with soil sampling, geophysical surveying (mainly the 

self-potential method), and pitting of anomalous areas.  Follow-up exploration consisted of 

auger drilling, followed by diamond drilling, was undertaken.  During the 1960s systematic 

auger drilling of the Lower Roan strata of the Western Chambishi Basin resulted in the 

recognition of deposits such as the Mwambashi Copper Project. 

Following the state control of the Zambian mining industry in 1970, exploration declined in the 

early 1970s with Anglo American (Zambia) (ZamAnglo) (Chartered Exploration) ceasing 

exploration entirely in 1975.  From 1973 - 1991 there was very little exploration in Zambia, 

though many of the known prospects were held by the Copperbelt mining companies.  The 

multi party elections of 1991 brought the Movement for Multiparty Democracy to power, 

pledging to revitalize the moribund mining industry by privatizing the industry.  This new 

dispensation revitalised the mining industry resulting in renewed exploration and brought 

foreign mining companies back into Zambia. 

Historical prospecting throughout the area was carried out through comprehensive mapping 

and sampling of outcrops before the outbreak of the Second World War.  Post war 

prospecting, up to mining industry nationalisation in 1972, was carried out largely by Roan 

Selection Trust and Roan Consolidated Mines utilising pitting and trenching, together with 

stream sediment and soil sampling to assess the potential of areas with no outcrops.  As 

technology advanced, aerial photography and geophysical prospecting tools were also used, 

specifically Self Potential (SP) methods.  Ultimately these methods led to anomaly definition, 

target generation and drilling. 

Production and exploration on the Zambian Copperbelt declined during the period of state 

control between 1970 and the late 1990s.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The previous licence holders include Anglo American and the RST (Kadola Mines).  The 

record of their work includes plans and sections showing the geology of parts of the area, soil 

sample traverses (with some assay data) and some drilling.  The strategy was apparently to 

identify areas of interest (anomalies) and to investigate them individually.  The available 

information is typically fragmented, but indicates that many anomalies were identified, though 

few were followed up due to limited resources and financial uncertainty, particularly following 

independence and during the period of nationalisation.   

Most of the exposed strike of the Roan Group of the Katanga Sequence on the Zambian 

Copperbelt has been prospected to some extent, and the areas surrounding major mines 

have been explored extensively.  From an exploration perspective the area is mature.  

Nevertheless, there are still numerous anomalies that remain unexplored or partially explored 

that could potentially provide supplementary plant feed to existing operations.  There is also 

potential to find large deposits that would support stand alone operations.  The application of 

modern geophysical techniques may play a significant role in identifying such exploration 

targets. 

Mukuba is targeting anomalies that have not yet been tested.  The historical data available for 

the Copperbelt licenses is indicative of the metallogenic potential of the area as a whole, 

rather than of the specific potential of Mukuba targets. 

6.3 Drilling by Previous Owners 

Drilling by previous owners was undertaken.  Records of this work are incomplete and 

generally do not include details of geology or sampling.   

6.4 Historical Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

Coffey Mining is not aware of mineral resource or reserve estimations within the licence 

areas. 

 
 

6.5 Production History 

An exploration open pit exists within the license area.  As this constitutes informal production, 

it is not possible to verify these production data.  No other production is known within the 

licence area.

6.6 Current Owners 

The current owners acquired PLLS356 after the consolidation of five licenses (PLLS 315, PP 

201, PP 202, PP 203 and PP 204).  PLLS356 was held by Northcore Minerals Limited which 

was held by Abbeygate Resources Limited (70% holding).  Mukuba has acquired a 100% 

ownership of Abbeygate Resources which has acquired the additional 30% of Northcore 

Resources.  The ownership is understood to be free and clear of encumbrances such as 

underlying payments or royalties to previous owners.   

PLLS356 required renewal in March 2008 and therefore a reduction area as shown in 

Figure 6.6_1 and pursuant to the requirements of the Mines and Minerals Development Bill.  

The area relinquished consists of areas considered to have low geological prospectivity such 

that their loss has not materially affected the exploration potential of the project as a whole. 

Figure 6.6_1 
Map Showing the Current and Previous Tenement Holdings 

 

Previous exploration consisted of the rehabilitation of certain access and infrastructure, the 

drilling of six diamond drill holes (PLLS356 - Northcore Area) and the mapping and sampling 

of various geochemical grids on both licence areas.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Setting 

Base metal mineralisation in the Zambian Copperbelt province is hosted by metasedimentary 

rocks of the Roan Group of the Neo-Proterozoic Katanga Sequence of the Katangan Basin, 

within the Lufilian Arc.  The rocks of the Katangan sequence define a north-west trend along 

the DRC-Zambia border in thin-skinned thrust-and fold orogenic system, formed by the 

convergence between the Congo and Kalahari cratons.  The Lufilian Arc and Zambezi Belt 

form part of a network of supracrustal Pan African belts (Neo-proterozoic age) in Africa and 

South America that are host to important base metal provinces e.g. Katanga (DRC) and 

Zambian Copperbelt, Kabwe Zn-Pb-Ag terrane, Otavi Mountain Land Cu-Zn-Pb (Namibia), 

Gariep Belt Zn-Pb (Namibia) and the São Francisco craton Zn-Pb deposits of Brazil 

(Figure 7.1_1).

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  38 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The Lufilian Arc records a complex history of Neoproterozoic extension during the break-up 

and dispersal of a former Mesoproterozoic supercontinent, and latest Neoproterozoic to 

earliest Phanerozoic collisional (compressional) deformation during the assembly of central 

Gondwana.  Three major events are considered to have significantly affected the regional 

geology of the Copperbelt (Selley et al., 2005), namely:- 

 Early rifting and extension which created isolated fault controlled basins linked by master 

faults. 

 Late stage extension circa 765-735Ma with limited mafic magmatism. 

 Basin inversion and compressive deformation between 595-490Ma culminating in upper 

greenschist facies metamorphism at around 530Ma. 

In Zambia, the Zambezi Belt is distinguished from the Lufilian Arc on the basis of its higher 

metamorphic grade and tectonic transport direction.  The continent-scale Mwembeshi Shear 

Zone (MSZ) is generally taken as the boundary between the Zambezi Belt and the Lufilian 

Arc, although the Katangan stratigraphy has been correlated across this structure in broad 

terms.  It is generally accepted that the sediments were deposited during the rift phase of the 

development of the Katanga Sequence in this area (880-500Ma) and were folded during the 

Lufilian Orogeny.  The stratigraphy and lithotypes of the Copperbelt is illustrated in 

Figure 7.1_2 and 7.1_3. 

Throughout the Central African Copperbelt, the basal Katanga Sequence rocks are underlain 

by deformed, and metamorphosed, polygenetic plutonic intrusives (mostly of granitic affinity) 

and supracrustal metavolcano-sedimentary rocks dated at ~1,900Ma to 2,100Ma.  The 

maximum age of the Katangan sedimentation is constrained by U-Pb dates on zircons from 

the Nchanga granite at 877±11Ma.  The age of the Katanga Sequence is constrained to 

602Ma and possibly 656Ma, on the basis of the age of post-Kundelungu uraninite veins 

(Master, 1998). 

It is postulated that extensive rifting occurred soon after the emplacement of the Nchanga 

granite.  The development of isolated structurally bounded basins in the shape of half-

graben/graben structures, controlled initial sedimentation in the lowermost portion of the 

Katanga Sequence, the Roan Group.  This basin margin configuration is especially important 

for the development of thick wedges of clastic sediments in the basal sequences composed of 

predominantly arenaceous and argillaceous rocks with relatively thin interbeds of rudaceous 

material.  The growth faults controlled prolonged and variable sedimentation into the basins.  

The environment of deposition is considered to initially be terrestrial and aeolian becoming 

marginal marine.  The base of the Roan Group was temporarily anoxic as lagoonal to mudflat 

depositional environments prevailed, giving rise to intercalations of evaporites in the siliclastic-

carbonate successions.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The basin-wide development of the Ore Shale unit (the OS1 Member of the Nchanga 

Formation), marks the first major marine transgression and represents an important marker 

that can be traced throughout the Copperbelt. 

The Copperbelt deposits are hosted by metasedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup, 

which is subdivided into the Roan and Kundelungu Groups and subdivided into three 

lithostratigraphic units (e.g. Cailteux, 2003 and references therein): Roan (code R), N'Guba 

(code Ng; formerly Lower Kundelungu Series or Kundelungu Inferieur (Ki)) and Kundelungu 

(code Ku; formerly Upper Kundelungu Series or Kundelungu Superieur (Ks)) groups 

(Figure 7.1_3).  The deposits are typically constrained to the Roan Group.

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  40 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The structure of the Katanga Sequence in Zambia is considered to be the result of 

compression during basin closure, however in the DRC it is probably the result of decollément 

at the northern margin of the basin and northward thrusting of the Katanga Sequence over 

basement rocks (granites and gneisses) and other, stratigraphically higher, Katanga 

Sequence rocks.  The "mega breccia" is considered to be of tectonic origin, but may also be 

influenced by salt density tectonics.  The "mega breccia" in the Kalumines Copper/Cobalt 

Project area forms a kite-shaped wedge elongated parallel and adjacent to a major northwest 

lineament.  Interpretations based on Landsat and aerial photographs suggest that this 

structure may represent an original Katanga basin edge fault, or an intra-basin fault. 

The entire sequence is intruded by diabase and dolerite sills and dykes, ranging in age up to 

late Karoo (Mesozoic) times.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

7.2 Project Geology 

The licence areas are underlain by rocks of the Kundelungu, Roan and Mwashia Groups 

(Figure 7.2_1).  There is an estimated 130km of basement/Lower Roan Group contact and 

some 3,700km2 is underlain by Lower Roan Group rocks.  The Lower Roan Group hosts over 

95% of the known copper deposits in Zambia and is considered highly prospective, 

particularly above, within, and below the 'Ore Shale', as well as above and below the 

basement/Lower Roan Group contact (Figure 8_1). 

Currently only the open pit in the south-western corner of the licence area has been identified 

as a target.  Other targets need to be generated.  The distribution, geometry, and size of such 

targets within the Katangan sequence are fundamentally controlled by basin fault architecture 

(Annels, 1989; Selley et al.  2005), the availability of both in situ and mobile reductants and 

may be linked to basin structures (Figure 7.2_1).   

On the Copperbelt and stratigraphically contained within the Lower Roan Group, the OS1 

Member or 'Ore Shale' is 15m to 30m thick comprising well bedded shale and siltstone.  This 

unit forms an effective permeability seal and redox boundary above the confined footwall 

clastics.  The OS1 Member is often extensively sheared, veined and deformed, forming a 

schist in places.  In these instances the OS1 is well mineralised and hosts the deposits so 

characteristic of the Copperbelt (Figure 8_1). 

Higher stratigraphy in the Upper Roan Formation comprises predominantly marine deposits, 

and can be correlated over much of the Copperbelt.  Dolomite, sandstone and 

siltstone/dolomitic siltstone become increasingly dominant upward in the stratigraphy. 

Gabbro intrusions are common in the Upper Roan Formation, but are also present from the 

basement through to the Mwashia Group which overlies the Roan Group.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The central African Copperbelt has a generous endowment of Cu and Co.  It has sustained 

production for over 70 years, and still has significant mineral resources and reserves.  Copper 

(and cobalt) mineralisation occurs at numerous stratigraphic levels (Figure 8_1).  The 

Copperbelt deposits may be classified as "arenite" or "argillite hosted" with the "arenite 

hosted" deposits of the Lower Roan Group occurring both below and above the level of the 

Ore Shale or Copperbelt Orebody Member and comprising approximately 30% of known 

deposits.  The "argillite-hosted" deposits of the Copperbelt Orebody Member account for 

almost 70% of deposits.

Schematic diagram indicating the stratigraphic position Copperbelt Deposits 

 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  44 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

The Mukuba licenses in Zambia may be considered prospective for two main deposit types as 

listed below:- 

 Stratiform Cu-Co; footwall type, hangingwall type and ore shale type, and 

 Stratabound, crosscutting polymetallic Cu mineralisation. 

8.1 Arenaceous-Argillaceous (Rudaceous) Stratiform Sediment Hosted Cu-Co 

The Zambian Copperbelt is developed within a major geological structure, the Lufilian Arc, 

stretching for more than 500km from Kolwezi in southern DRC to Luanshya in Zambia.  This 

arc is host to extensive high-grade Cu-Co mineralisation in very large stratiform deposits with 

many large copper mining operations (e.g. Kamoto Mine in DRC and Nchanga Mine in 

Zambia). 

The stratiform sediment hosted copper deposits of the Zambian Copperbelt may be further 

divided into three main types:- 

 Ore Shale-Hosted Mineralisation (Type 1a) 

 Footwall Quartzite Hosted Mineralisation (Type 1b), and 

 Upper Ore Body - Hangingwall Mineralisation (Type 1c). 

8.1.1 Ore Shale-Hosted Mineralisation (Type 1a) 

Copper mineralisation hosted in the ore shale occurs at Konkola, Konkola North, Nchanga, 

Chambishi, Nkana and other mines in Zambia.  These giant deposits had pre-mining 

resources of several hundreds of millions tonnes at grades of between  

2 - 4% copper, with varying proportions of cobalt.  For many of these deposits, the resources 

remain in excess of 100Mt, in spite of close to a century or mining. 

The mineralised portion of the OS1 Member is usually between 15 and 20m thick and at 

individual mines may have a strike length of over 10km.  A complex paragenesis of Cu oxides 

and sulphides is present.  Copper also occurs in its native form and within the lattice of 

metamorphic micas, i.e.  the Chingola Refractory Ores (CRO). 

The OS1 Member is the lowest well-defined and continuous shale/siltstone/schist unit of the 

Katanga Sequence and has been interpreted as a reductant, impervious trap site and 

depositional site for mineralised fluids. 

8.1.2 Footwall Quartzite Hosted Mineralisation (Type 1b) 

Copper mineralisation is hosted by quartzite in the footwall of the OS1 Member at the 

Chingola, Mwambashi, Chibuluma, Fitula and Mimbula mines.  The host units are located in 

fault bounded sub-basins to which the overlying shale has acted as an impermeable barrier 

and reductant for mineralised fluids.  It has been postulated that hydrocarbons trapped in the 

arenaceous footwall sediments may also have acted as reductants that have controlled the 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  45 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

precipitation of sulphide minerals from mineralised fluids.  Whilst having smaller resources 

than the ore shale deposits, typically several tens of millions tonnes, the grades are generally 

higher at 2.5 - 4% Cu, with varying Co grades. 

8.1.3 Upper Ore Body - Hangingwall Mineralisation (Type 1c) 

At Nchanga, there is significant stratiform copper mineralisation present in the hangingwall 

where it is locally referred to as the Upper Ore Body.  The Upper Ore Body is developed 

primarily in a sequence of friable (loosely bound) sandstones and shales that make it 

particularly difficult to mine through underground mining methods.  Numerous attempts have 

been made at Nchanga, but all have eventually been abandoned.  Block caving could 

potentially be successful, but at Nchanga the Lower Ore Body is of higher grade and is mined 

(by caving) in preference to the Upper Ore Body.  This effectively sterilises the Upper Ore 

Body underground. 

In contrast, the attitude and thickness of the Upper Ore Body at Nchanga makes it an 

attractive target for open pit mining.  The Nchanga open pit has been developed on this 

mineralisation. 

Cobalt is not present throughout the sequence.  At Nchanga, cobalt occurs preferentially in 

the Upper Ore Body and within meso-scale fold closures (the "cobalt fold"). 

8.2 Stratabound, Crosscutting Polymetallic Cu Mineralisation 

This class of deposit has yet to be studied in the same detail as the stratiform sediment-

hosted deposits.  The Kanshansi mine is an example of the economic potential of this under-

explored class of deposit.  Crosscutting and concordant vein hosted mineralisation in these 

deposits is concentrated in the core of anticlinal folds within the Kakontwe Formation.  The 

deposits may be considered particularly significant as they occur in carbonaceous siltstones 

shales and diamictite of the uppermost Mwashia and lowermost Nguba Groups, rather than in 

the rocks of the Lower Roan. 

Prior to the definition of the Kanshansi deposit, this epigenetic replacement style of Cu and Au 

mineralisation in the upper stratigraphic units was not historically considered a priority 

exploration target.  Consequently exploration in the Copperbelt region did not focus on this 

stratigraphic package.   

Other deposits that have tentatively been correlated with Kanshansi are the Lonshi, Frontier, 

Lufua, Kalengwa and Chifumpa occurrences.  Kanshansi has also been compared to the 

polymetallic epigenetic style deposits of southern Katanga, including Shinkolobwe (U, Cu, Co, 

Ni), Menda and Mindigi (U, Cu, Co, Ni, Mo, Au, Pt, Pd).

8.3 Conclusion 

"Fertile basins" in the supracrustal Pan African belts share some or all of the following 

characteristics:- 

 Variably permeable strata and permeability seals. 

 Redox boundaries that often correspond with permeability seals/traps. 

 A source of salinity for the mineralising fluids, e.g. salt beds preserved as halite, gypsum, 

scapolite, anhydrite and various forms of dissolution breccias. 

 A metal source, although this is not always obvious, e.g. the Zambian and Congolese 

Copperbelts. 

 As basin rifting is replaced by inversion, the fluids evolve in character toward 

metamorphic or magmatic types, with fluid movement increasingly influenced by 

structural permeability. 

Growth faults along the basin margins controlled sedimentation in the basins and were 

subsequently utilised as pathways for mineralising fluids.

9 MINERALISATION 

The Project Area is expected to host the ore shale type, footwall type and hangingwall type 

deposits.  Mukuba will need to undertake target generation based on an attempt to interpret 

evolving basinal processes from the rift phase through to the post-peak metamorphic orogenic 

stage, as well as superimposed younger events to determine the Cu-Co potential of the 

licence areas.   

The mineralization in the hypogene zone may be subdivide into two types of mineral 

assemblages: dominant Cu-Co sulphide assemblage and a minor Cu-U-Mo-(Au) assemblage. 

Cu-Co sulphide assemblage: 

This assemblage is characterised by pre-folding disseminated and lesser vein-hosted Cu-Co 

sulphides with chalcopyrite-bornite being the dominant minerals and subsidiary chalcocite and 

pyrite.  The complex textural relationships indicate a multi-stage ore formation.  Diagenetic to 

late diagenetic mineralization is indicated by the typically non-fracture controlled distribution of 

both sulphide and gangue phases.  Brines capable of mobilizing metals are considered to 

have been formed during development of evaporitic environments associated with the 

sedimentation of units of the Upper Roan Group, and/or subsequent dissolution of these 

evaporites to form the Upper Roan Group breccias.  Late diagenetic to early orogenic 

mineralization is found as disseminated Cu-Co sulphides in pre-folding bedding-parallel fibre.   

The Central African Copperbelt is unusual among sediment-hosted stratiform copper districts 

in having Co (as carrolite) as an economically significant phase in some deposits, and low to 

negligible Ag, Zn, and Pb.   

Cu-U-Mo-(Au) assemblage: 

This type of assemblage is not uncommon but volumetrically minor, and consists of Cu-U-Mo-

(Au) bearing phases in post-folding veins.

10 EXPLORATION 

10.1 Previous Exploration 

Historically, the eastern portion fell within a very large colonial era license managed by Kadola 

Mines Limited, who carried out regional, reconnaissance style soil sampling and mapping in 

the late 1950s, before focussing their limited resources further south on what became the 

Eureka Mine.  Exploration licenses in the western portion were first taken up in the 1960s and 

1970s, first by Anglo American and then again in the 1990s by Phelps Dodge. 

A small number of maps and interim exploration reports have survived the attrition that has 

occurred in the mining archives in Lusaka and in Kalulushi.  Although the information is patchy 

and, it appears to provide a full overview of all the work previously carried out.  This 

information has been geo-referenced and entered onto a GIS database.  A summary of the 

copper and cobalt anomalies found by reconnaissance soil sampling, carried out by Kadola 

Mines Limited up to 1958, is presented in Figure 10.1_1.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that further work within the area of the current licence area 

ceased because Kadola Mining focused efforts on a cluster of anomalies to the south of the 

licence area which became the Eureka Mine. 

10.2 Exploration Strategy 

Mukuba's strategy is to confirm the previous geological interpretation provided by government 

maps and previous tenement holders using a combination of the critical examination of 

historic data, the latest geophysical techniques and an extensive mapping and soil sampling 

campaign.  This will allow the delineation of anomalies or targets for subsequent investigation 

and drilling.  Where anomalous copper in soil and coincident geophysical targets are found, 

they will be treated as priority and may be considered as drill targets. 

Mukuba has and is planning to continue applying the latest geophysical techniques and an 

understanding of the various styles of polymetallic mineralisation known on the Copperbelt 

and applying this knowledge to the relatively unknown and untested potential for Copperbelt 

(Cu/Co) mineralisation across the licence area.  The potential within the licence areas exist for 

the typical Lower Roan Formation Cu/Co mineralisation as well as mineralisation higher in the 

stratigraphy within the Upper Mwashia/Lower Kundulungu sediments.  New concepts of the 

genesis and controls of Copperbelt mineralisation and in particular the potential of the 

licenses to contain Upper Stratigraphy (Kanshansi Style) mineralisation are being considered.  

Previous work was largely confined to the 'Ore Shale unit' and Lower Roan Formation.  Other 

units were not thoroughly investigated due to an emphasis on syngenetic controls for 

mineralisation.  Mukuba intends to generate concise exploration and evaluation targets for 

upper stratigraphy type Cu-Co targets.  Mukuba considers that the Zambian Copperbelt and 

associated basement domes with extensive surrounding Lower Roan sediments is very 

prospective for Cu and Co mineralisation. 

10.3 Exploration by Current Owners 

Mukuba has undertaken exploration on the Northcore (PPLS356) and Lunga (PLLS363) 

licences in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  The south western part of the licence area initially received 

more attention with copper and zinc anomalies that had first been identified by Anglo 

American in the early 1970s (Figure 10.3_1).  An anomaly extending 10km in a SE - NW 

direction was identified with some indication that it may extend to the NW onto the Lunga 

licence. 

The 2007 exploration activities were concentrated on this area of the Northcore licence and 

the Lunga Licence and consisted of drilling six diamond drill holes and the completion of soil 

sampling and geological outcrop mapping across five grid areas (Figure 10.3_1 and 

Figure 10.4_1).  The exploration activities have been outsourced to Caracle Creek 

International (Zambia) (Pty) Ltd.

Access was established into the Basement Dome area in the east of the Northcore Area 

where the main focus of the exploration efforts has been focused during 2008.  Approximately 

36km of old access track was cleared in early November 2007.

10.3.1 Remote Sensing 

Landsat TM and aerial photo interpretation has been undertaken by SRK Consulting 

(Australasia) (SRK) in 2009. 

Landsat, Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) and digital elevation model (DEM) 

compilation and interpretation was been undertaken by A Greenish an independent Geologist 

and GIS Specialist Consultant and made available to SRK.  These included a 7 (red), 4 

(green), 2(blue) false colour composite (pan-sharpened) mosaic, a 5/4 band ratio (grey-scale) 

image (not pan-sharpened which highlights iron rich minerals in soil) and a greyscale band-8 

image (panchromatic image with pixel size ~15 m).  In addition SRK derived some additional 

products from the Landsat data (Figure 10.3.1_1).

Mosaics for seven bands were produced using ER Mapper software.  The procedure to 

produce each mosaic required:- 

 the creation of a rotated clip region for the scene  

 production of a mosaic for each band to apply the clip region 

 the conversion of each band mosaic as a virtual dataset  

Subsequently these mosaics were grouped together and then used to produce different three-

band-combination images to highlight the ground features. 

Different vegetation types grow on different soil types and contrasts of colour in vegetated 

areas can assist interpretations of some geological features.  Fault lines and structural 

features are often characterised by enhanced permeability, leading to slightly denser or 

healthier vegetation on top of these features.  Other features including the differences in 

permeability and soil type often allow the interpretation of geological fabrics or features. 

Due to the dominance of stratified units over the licence areas, comprising metre- to 

decametre-scale coarse and fine clastic sediments, calcareous or not, and banks of 

carbonate, these variations in vegetation and or spectral response (pattern, texture and 

colour) are relatively subtle.  However, SRK expected that vegetation cover over calcareous 

units, with increased permeability, as well as extensive coarse units, such as the two tillites in 

the Nguba and Kundelungu Group, would be denser than on the psammo-pelitic-dominated 

lower parts of the Roan Group. 

10.3.2 Geophysics 

Introduction 

A helicopter borne magnetic and radiometric survey was undertaken by Geotech Airborne 

Limited (GAL) operating out of South Africa in July 2008 over a period of 29 days.  The survey 

consisted of an aeromagnetic survey and a VTEM Survey.  The area flown is indicated in 

Figure 6.2_1.  The objectives of this survey and interpretation were to accurately map 

geological structure and to detect and outline possible exploration targets.  It is planned that 

the targets identified will be confirmed, investigated and followed up on the ground with more 

conventional methods of exploration.   

The area flown consisted of 13,413 line kilometres with a line spacing of 200m and a sampling 

interval of 2m on the lines.  The magnetic data was collected using an optically pumped Cs-

vapour magnetometer, at an elevation of 68m.  The helicopter ground speed was about 

80km/h.  Two helicopters were used after ensuring consistency between the data from the two 

geophysical arrays.

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Theory  

Aeromagnetic surveys are well established geophysical methods which require little 

theoretical discussion for the informed reader.  However, VTEM is a relatively new variation of 

time domain electromagnetic surveys.  A short explanation of the technique is therefore 

warranted.   

Time domain electromagnetic (abbreviated as TDEM or TEM) techniques are based on the 

following two physical laws:- 

 When a current flows in a wire (electrical conductor), a magnetic field is created around 

the current.  In TEM this is called the primary magnetic field. 

 When a wire (electrical conductor) is enveloped by a changing magnetic field, electrical 

currents will flow in the conductor.  In TEM these are referred to as induced currents.  

The magnetic field associated with these currents, is called the secondary magnetic field. 

Processing of the raw magnetic data by GAL involved the correction of diurnal variation, line 

levelling and interpolation of line data into a grid with pixel size 50m.  Gridding applied a 

minimum curvature algorithm to this data.   

In the VTEM system, there is a relatively slow build up of the current flowing in the transmitter 

loop, eventually creating a constant primary magnetic field.  The current in the transmitter loop 

is then switched off with a relatively short switch-off time, leading to a large change in the 

primary magnetic field (Figure 10.3.2_1).  The purpose of the reference coil is to reduce the 

primary field at the receiver.  The transmitter current is circulated through the reference coil in 

the opposite direction to the transmitter loop.  The number of turns in the reference coil 

ensures that the nett field generated is approximately equal and opposite to that of the 

transmitter.  This is done to limit the dynamic range of data acquired by the 24 bit analog to 

digital convertor's in the receiver this enabling measurements in the 'on' time.  It makes the 

B field measurements possible.  This rapid change in the primary magnetic field induces 

current flow in the subsurface.  Since there are no external sources to continue driving the 

induced currents, the currents will decay to zero.  The time it takes for these currents to decay 

to zero, as well as the way they decay, is a function of the subsurface geometry as well as the 

subsurface conductivity distribution.   

It is this decay of the induced currents that are recorded by the VTEM receiver at 

approximately 2m intervals along the flight path.

TEM data can be presented as:- 

 A decay curve.  These are usually presented as log (voltage) versus log (time), or ln 

(voltage) versus time.   

 A stacked profile plot for a chosen number of time channels. 

 An apparent resistivity curve calculated from the decay curve at each station. 

 Conductivity Depth Images (CDI's) for each flight line. 

 Contour maps of the interpreted conductivity at a constant depth below the surface. 

Interpretation 

A GAL based structural interpretation was based primarily on the magnetic data, but cross 

correlating with the electromagnetic data (Figure 10.3.2_2).  Based on the texture of the 

magnetic data, the survey block was divided into distinctly different geological units.  The data 

shows a remarkable correlation of the regional geology with the published geological maps 

confirming the power of the technique (Figure 10.3.2_3).

The differences between the geophysical interpretation and the published geological map are 

particularly where the interpretation based on the geophysics, of the Lower Roan lithologies 

and less over the Basement towards the central - SW area.  The thick green line in the SE of 

the block on the geophysical interpretation is considered to be a mafic dyke but should be 

thinner.  The geophysical interpretation still requires some refining.   

Based on the VTEM Survey a number of anomalies or areas requiring further consideration 

were identified.  These anomalies were identified based on the shape of the anomaly on a 

profile plot of the data.  The anomalies are classified as:- 

 An electro - magnetic (EM) anomaly due to a subsurface conductor. 

 An EM anomaly due to cultural features. 

 A double EM anomaly corresponding to the response of a steeply dipping plate. 

Northcore is currently evaluating the findings of the VTEM Survey and interpretation to 

establish which areas should be considered for further more conventional exploration and 

investigation.   

Other aeromagnetic data 

A Zambian governmental aeromagnetic dataset containing Total Magnetic Field response was 

also used for geological interpretation.  SRK was contracted to provide a more detailed 

interpretation of the geophysical data.  The data was captured at a grid interval of 250m, from 

an average height of 150m.   

From this database, a grid of the magnetic field was interpolated using the Minimum 

Curvature algorithm with a 20m cell size with the data being reduced to pole before applying 

any derivatives.  Due to the high level of noise in the derivatives, a low filter has been applied.  

The images produced were used for the geological interpretation.   

10.3.3 Geochemistry 

Extensive soil geochemistry has already been completed to delineate target areas for follow 

up investigation and possible drill areas of interest.  The aim of this detailed geochemical 

study is to distinguish between hydromorphic and bedrock related anomalies.  A further aim 

was to identify sulphide and silicate related metal associations.

The soil sampling has confirmed that there are anomalous concentrations of base metals in 

the soil horizon (Figure 10.3.3_2).  The next phase of exploration will be a critical 

consideration of these anomalies to determine whether they are to be investigated further.  

The targets identified may be further soil sampled and/or drilled.

Soil Sampling - Northcore 

The soil sampling programme has begun on the western side of the basement where the 

published information and historical data indicated the outcrop of the Lower Roan 

(Figure 10.3.3_3).  The soil sampling has been conducted across the Basement - Lower 

Roan - Upper Roan lithologies in an effort to identify areas of elevated copper mineralisation 

where detailed soil grids, drilling and possible trenching will be considered.  The grid lines are 

typically oriented perpendicular the known strike, typically being orientated close to east-west.  

The lines are 1km apart and the samples are taken every 50m along a line.  The programme 

is on-going.  Preliminary results are presented in Figure 10.3.3_4.

Photograph of the handheld XRF analyser 

 

 

A handheld NITON XL3t XRF analyser (Figure 10.3.3_5) was used to scan selected soil and 

rock chip samples to obtain geochemical data to guide exploration activities.  The Handheld 

Thermo Scientific NITON XRF analyser is considered to be a state-of-the-art portable 

instrument for elemental analysis.  This allows the user to perform rapid, in the field qualitative 

screening potentially reducing the cost, time, and effort involved in exploration.  The NITON 

analyser combines X-ray technology in a portable XRF instrument with advanced electronics 

and materials technology.  This is considered to be cutting-edge exploration technology.   

The sampling of previously identified anomalies has also been undertaken.  The specific 

programme is designed based on the knowledge and expectation of the anomaly.  The initial 

profile may be a cross sampling programme to a distance away from the anomaly.  

Alternatively grid sampling maybe undertaken such as the sampling of the Tomato anomaly 

(Figure 10.3.3_6).

Figure 10.3.3_6 
Results of the Soil Sampling of the Tomato Anomaly 

See Figure 10.3.3.2_1 for location of the Tomato Showing 

 

Results from the detailed Tomato soil grid did not indicate any significant copper soil anomaly 

in the vicinity of the pits or surrounding area.  However a NW-SE trend in the soil 

geochemistry is presented by both copper and cobalt.  This trend is approximately 

perpendicular to the interpreted Lower Roan contact zone in the south eastern corner of the 

grid suggests a possible structural control to the anomaly which may indicate weak 

mineralization.   

A thin section description of the host rock at the Tomato Showing was undertaken by Dr.  

Ted Thatcher of Microsearch (South Africa) indicated that although copper oxides were 

present in a hydrothermally altered (secondary copper-rutile minerals) quartz-

sericite/muscovite schist, they were in minor amounts.   

A detailed soil sampling grid was completed at the Puku anomaly (Figure 10.3.3_7).  The soil 

sample grids was over an area of 2km x 0.8km.

SRK Interpretation 

Soil sampling lines were designed to intersect the contact between the basement and the 

Lower Roan as presented on the Kadola Mines geological map.  SRK considered this map to 

be unreliable based on their interpretation of the geophysical data.  Based on the SRK 

interpretation, the soil sampling lines intersect different parts of the stratigraphy including the 

upper Roan and Nguba Group.  SRK have reviewed the data and re-categorised it according 

to stratigraphy (Table 10.3.3_2 and Figures 10.3.3_8 and 10.3.3_9).

10.3.4 Field Mapping 

Geological and regolith mapping is being undertaken coincident with the regional soil grid 

lines and around the historical anomalies and targets to confirm and identify the various major 

lithological contacts based on outcrop or changes in soil colour attributed to changes in 

underlying rock type.  It should be noted that there is a paucity of outcrop in the licence area.  

Grab samples are collected where appropriate.  Rock chip samples returned insignificant 

results with peak copper and cobalt values of 7ppm and 79ppm respectively. 

A visit to the historical Puku Showing (Figure 10.3.3.2_1) in the southeast of the area returned 

a peak NITON value of 1.2% Cu in a gossanous, iron-rich fault zone that has been trenched.  

Grab samples submitted for analysis returned concentrations of up to 1.5% Cu. 

10.3.5 Reinterpretation of the Data by SRK Consulting 

The re-interpretation of all the data completed by SRK is summarized here but is not fully 

disclosed due to its technically sensitive nature.  

SRK undertook a full interpretation of the airborne VTEM.  The interpretation was also 

integrated with the other available data namely government aeromagnetic data, remote 

sensing data, geochemical data and a variety of scanned maps and diagrams.  The re-

interpretation was concentrated over the southern part of project area where the VTEM survey 

was originally flown.  A preliminary geological interpretation was conducted over the northern 

part of the tenement.  Data covering the eastern part of the Lunga area, which forms part of 

PLLS356, was too limited to allow any interpretation in this area. 

Methodology – Aeromagnetic data 

Further processing was applied by SRK to enhance the interpretation of the data.  

Table 10Error! Reference source not found..3.5_1 summarises these processing 

techniques.

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  70 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Based on the known stratigraphy and structure in the Zambian Copperbelt, SRK made the 

following assumptions:- 

 The magnetic character of the main lithologies are coarse clastic (high-magnetics), pelitic 

(medium-magnetics) and carbonate (low-magnetics) units 

 Possible distinctive highly magnetic 'marker' units include tillite (Grand or Petit 

Conglomérat), gabbro (dykes, sills and small stocks) and ironstone/BIF 

 Diagnostic facies associations are:- 

o Mindola and Kitwe Subgroup (Lower Roan Group; layered aspect, dominantly smooth 

low magnetic, with high-magnetic layers corresponding to coarse clastic and 

ferruginous quartzite units) 

o Kirilabombwe and Mwashia Subgroup (Upper Roan Group; layered aspect, dominant 

banded low-magnetic, high-magnetic layers and pods of high-magnetic volcanic units 

and/or mafic intrusions) 

o Nguba Group (very variable high-magnetic at base; tillite and overlying thick cap-

carbonate and BIF), followed by high- and low-magnetic response (worm-like pattern) 

o Kundelungu Group (similar to Nguba Group) 

o Thrusts and fault zones, widely present in the Katanga Supergroup, dominantly follow 

evaporitic units in the Kitwe and Kirilabombwe Subgroup, and the base of the Nguba 

and Kundelungu Groups.  They would have accommodated fluids that facilitated 

introduction of metasomatic alteration including magnetite and should be evidenced by 

truncating or bifurcating linear magnetic features. 

Various profile interpretations were undertaken in 2D modelling technique to determine 

apparent dip and depth to improve the understanding of geology.  Tabular bodies were used 

to model the contact along thrusts.  Each tabular body has a different set of parameters such 

as magnetic susceptibility, thickness, depth and dip, which all influence the observed 

magnetic response, the modelling thus required adjustment of these parameters to match the 

magnetic signature.  The model solutions are not unique and represents a single possible 

solution. 

Methodology – VTEM data 

SRK did not conduct any additional data processing. 

The interpretation of the VTEM data was based on the grid showing the apparent conductivity 

at 50m, which showed the highest contrast levels and correlated well with the interpreted 

response at the greatest depth of 400m.  The correlation between 50m and 400m conductivity 

was interpreted that the signal was derived from deeper electromagnetic/conductive bodies.  

This allowed the definition of clearly defined electromagnetic domains corresponding to 

volumes of rock with contrasting electromagnetic character. 

The profile grids were integrated in a 3D environment to determine the relationship between 

anomalies and structures.  The profiles showed two conductor layers, and possibly a third, 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  71 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

deeper conductive layer.  The shallowest conductor was interpreted as the water table, while 

deeper layers (up to 300m below the surface) were interpreted as conductive rock bodies at 

depth and contain anomalous zones and features.  Breaks in the electromagnetic response in 

deeper layers were interpreted as a thrust or fault.  Some folding was interpreted for the 

continuous sections of the conductive layer in the south.  It was noted that profiles in this area 

are not perpendicular to the features, which hampered interpretation.   

SRK stated that due to the gentle dips in the area (<30°), apparent dips of strata or interpreted 

fault surfaces cannot be determined and that general dip directions were interpreted. 

The magnetic data indicates a low susceptibility zone in the centre of the tenement, which is 

surrounded by much higher susceptibility values.  Although many magnetic features are 

visible the most significant are located at the contact between Lower Roan Group and either 

Upper Roan or Nguba Group.   

Nine magnetic profiles have been developed  to define the geometry of these main magnetic 

lineaments, defining contact zones, and interpreted as thrusts.   

Geological interpretation 

SRK considers that a large part of the central Mukuba area is underlain by Lower Roan 

stratigraphy, mainly the Kitwe Subgroup.  These units are characterised by alternating arkose 

and dolomitic siltstone, interspersed with evaporitic horizons and conglomerate lags, but the 

magnetic signature is generally low.   

The Kitwe Subgroup strata were determined to be folded along a major regional fold with axis 

running along NNE-SSW direction.  This geometry is considered to be the result of a 

differential thrust translation of the Lower Roan units over a series of décollements, in which 

NNW-oriented tectonic transport was the greatest in the centre of the Mukuba tenement, but 

reduced progressively towards the west and east owing to the presence of covered basement 

domes (Figure 10.3.5_1).  SRK postulates that the thrusting was accommodated along a 

series of lateral ramps along the margin of the concealed southern extension of the Kafue 

basement dome.

Several linear features were noted to occur at high angle to the interpreted thrusts.  These 

features are sometimes the locations of rivers or 'dambos' and were interpreted as mafic 

dykes, and may sometimes have used normal fault systems for their emplacement.  SRK 

suggested that they may form the plumbing system for mafic stocks in the Kirilabombwe and 

Mwashia Subgroups, and mafic lavas recorded in the Mwashia Subgroup and Nguba Group.  

SRK also note that many of these dykes cut all fabrics in the region and therefore probably 

post-date the Lufilian Orogeny and are most likely related to post-collisional relaxation and 

collapse.

SRK's interpretation indicates that the thickness of the lower part of the Roan Group (Mindola 

and Kitwe Subgroups) greatly increased in the Mukuba tenement and suggest that this is due 

to extensive thrust duplication.   

In the south, the magnetic response changes abruptly along a highly magnetic feature.  This 

contact is curvilinear and broadly mimicking the geometry of the lower Roan Group and 

contained thrusts.  SRK interpret this contact to represent another thrust, which has displaced 

the upper parts on top of the lower parts of the Roan Group.  The southern lower Roan Group 

records some sharp contrasts in magnetic response between units which are interpreted as 

thrusts.   

In the eastern units, broad magnetic striping is observed in the northernmost part, while to the 

south the magnetic response is both lower and smooth.  SRK consider these differences to be 

the presence of predominantly subhorizontal calcareous units of the upper Roan Group in the 

south, and a more varied part of the upper Roan Group (grits, arkose, shale and carbonate) in 

the north.   

A subcircular feature is vaguely distinguishable in the eastern area and interpreted as either 

represent a shallowly buried post-Katangan pluton or a sub-cropping basement high, possibly 

related to the Kafue Dome.  Numerous isolated, subcircular or elliptical high-magnetic areas 

are observed in what is interpreted as the upper Roan units.  They are interpreted as various 

stocks and plugs of mafic intrusives.      

The northwestern part of the tenement is characterised by a very high and mottled magnetic 

pattern very similar to the response of the Nguba Group.  SRK therefore interpret this corner 

of the Mukuba tenement to be underlain by flat-lying Nguba Group.  This interpretation is in 

general agreement with available point.  In the SRK understanding, the Nguba Group has 

thus been thrust over the Roan Group and the intervening Upper Roan Group structurally 

removed.  Based on the Landsat imagery and a pronounced magnetic low (government data) 

SRK interpret a tectonic window within the Nguba Group thrust sheet, exposing the 

structurally underlying lower Roan Group. 

Structural Development 

SRK considers that the tectono-stratigraphy of the Mukuba area is the result of significant 

northward thrust-emplacement of a series of thrust sheets over deeply concealed basement 

(Figure 10.3.5_2Error! Reference source not found.) and that the geometry of the 

Palaeoproterozoic basement of the Domes region was greatly influenced the thrust 

propagation and geometry of lateral ramps.  the Mukuba area is characterised by a basement 

low, flanked by two basement highs, which are interpreted to correspond to the concealed 

southward extensions of the Lushwishi (west) and Kafue Domes (Figure 10.5.3_1).  In the 

northern part of the Mukuba tenement, two north-south oriented magnetic features SRK 

interprets to represent two horsts within the basement low.

Representative schematic cross sections through the Mukuba tenement 

 

 

SRK considers that if the models of thrusting involving reactivation of basement structures, 

such as recorded in the Domes Region are applicable, then the recognition of these structures 

can be of pivotal importance, as recent discoveries have shown these to be prospective for 

Cu-Co-U mineralisation (e.g. at Lumwana). 

Thrusting in the upper part of the Roan Group appears to be far less than in the lower units.  

Several cross-cutting features in the upper Roan support some thrust development, with the 

thrusts broadly parallel to those observed in the Lower Roan Group.  The structural 

disposition of Nguba Group rocks over the Lower Roan in the western part of the tenement 

may define a second thrust event.   

Folding 

SRK recognised folding within the Lower Roan Group strata.  The interpretation was confired 

from geological maps of the Mukubwe area (1:100,000 map)  The folds are tight to isoclinal, 

with outcrop patterns consistent with a recumbent geometry.  The limbs are parallel to the 

interpreted thrusts, and fold vergence is inferred to be NNW to NW.  The regional fabrics and 

fold axial planes change from an E-W direction in the west to a north-south direction in the 

east, defining a broad open fold geometry with a NE-SW axial plane.  This large-scale 

structure is imposed across the various thrust nappes and records the differential movement 

of the thrust sheets across the area.   

In the west, the Katangan strata undergo north-south compression as the thrusts fail to 

propagate northwards over the southern extension of the Lushwishi basement dome.  There, 

E-W oriented tight folds are recognised with axes plunging steeply away from the dome (east-

plunging folds).   

In the centre of the Mukuba tenement, north-south compression is taken up, in part, by 

folding, but mainly results in large-scale detachments and northward thrust translation, with 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  75 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

thrusts changing from an east-west orientation to a NNW-SSE orientation.  Folding appears to 

display both west- and east-plunging axes in this region signifying a more recumbent 

geometry.   

In the east the thrusts-bound packages tighten, resulting in tight to isoclinal fold patterns with 

axial planes oriented N-S.  It is likely that, within an overall N- to NE-vergent thrust regime, the 

N-S oriented thrusts have a large dextral component and developed into right-lateral strike-

slip shear zones.  SRK ascribes this to the concealed presence of a promontory of the Kafue 

Dome in the east of the tenement, which hampers northward translation.  In the far SE-corner 

of the tenement, the thrusts and folding again takes on an east-west orientation, marking the 

southernmost extent of the Kafue Dome. 

VTEM Interpretation 

The VTEM sectional data allowed the identification of synforms, antiforms and breaks.  The 

synforms and antiforms are interpreted by SRK to reflect fold features in conductive parts of 

the sedimentary strata.  Breaks were interpreted to represent faults or dykes.  SRK have 

identified significant conductive units at depth which can provide targets for further work and 

drill testing.   

SRK made the following general observations:- 

 Breaks in the apparent conductivity appear to be correlated with linear magnetic 

contacts, often interpreted as faults or thrusts.  Some isolated apparent breaks in the 

VTEM profiles did not correspond to visible breaks or dykes in the magnetic or plan 

VTEM data, and therefore represent features too small to be included at a 1:50,000 

scale. 

 The spacing of antiform-synform pairs varies from 400-800m along areas with layering 

along east-west direction, to 100-200m in areas where trends swing north-south 

(perpendicular to the section line, and therefore a good estimate of actual wavelength of 

the folding).   

 There are more synformal features recorded than antiformal features, indicating that the 

conductive layer has partly been removed by erosion. 

 No overturned or recumbent features have been identified in the profiles either indicating 

that such features are not present, or more likely, resulting from a failure of the VTEM 

technique to resolve features with dips less than about 30°. 

VTEM Targets 

Fifteen targets were identified based on the VTEM data (Table 10.3.5_2 and Figure 10.3.5_3), 

only one of which is located in the Lower Roan (VTEM15).  These targets are located above 

highly conductive features and are on coincident VTEM anomalies, magnetic response and 

ancillary geological and soil geochemical data.  Each target is ranked based on its perceived 

potential.  An assessment of these targets in the field is highly recommended by SRK and

supported by Coffey Mining.  SRK suggest follow-up soil geochemistry or ground-based 

geophysical methods prior to more expensive drilling.

Coffey Mining Technical Review 

The consultants who undertook the assignment are suitably experienced in the techniques 

used and have a professional knowledge of the Copperbelt.   

SRK confirms the importance of the Lower Roan Group and the Ore Shale Member as the 

Ore Shale Member is known to host 70% of Cu deposits in the Zambian Copperbelt.  The 

understanding of the Copperbelt by SRK is slightly different but confirms that Northcore may a 

sound exploration strategy and that the tenement is underlain by the Lower Roan Group 

which has potential to host Cu-Co mineralisation. 

SRK states that their interpretation of aeromagnetic data must be considered, as one of the 

steps that lead to a geological interpretation.  They also acknowledge that the geological 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  78 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

interpretation must necessarily rely on ground observation (geological mapping).  Coffey 

Mining concurs with these views. 

SRK have integrated various exploration data and generated a model that is useful for further 

exploration.  The targets generated are considered appropriate and are the product of 

consideration of an integrated approach.  Coffey Mining concurs that further work on the 

ground is required to demonstrate the validity of these targets.

10.3.7 Drilling 2007 

Six diamond drill holes for a total of 722m (NQ diameter) were completed.  The drill holes 

were sited close to and adjacent to the known copper mineralization at the Kantobo Cu 

Prospect pit in the SW corner of the Northcore Area to test for any extensions of the 

mineralization down dip and along strike of the pit exposure.   

10.3.8 Drilling 2009 

Drilling commenced at the end of June 2009 on the first of the priority target areas.  Drill Africa 

based out of Ndola were contracted to complete a short program of Reverse Circulation (RC) 

drilling totalling approximately 2,500m.  The slow progress was made initially due to difficulties 

with the drilling/ground conditions.   

The option of changing to diamond drilling (DD) for the remainder of the program was 

investigated and implemented due to the difficulty being experienced in obtaining a good, 

representative sample as a result of ground conditions and water. 

A total of 1,713.14m (RC – 107.00m and DD – 1,606.14m) of drilling (13 drill holes: 2 RC and 

11 DD) was completed to test various targets in seven localities in the southern part of the 

exploration license (PLLS356).

10.5 Coffey Mining Assessment of the Mukuba Exploration Activities 

Coffey Mining considers the Zambian Copperbelt to be mature from an exploration 

perspective.  This is based on extensive surface exploration carried out by previous owners.  

Consequently, Coffey Mining considers that new discoveries are most likely to be made by the 

application of new high-technology target generation techniques and the systematic use of 

conventional exploration methods and conventional drilling.  There is considerable potential to 

discover base metal mineralisation on licenses held by Mukuba.  Although Coffey Mining has 

not investigated the whole target generation procedure in detail, Mukuba appears to have 

applied thought and prudence to the target generation process.   

Mukuba's planned progression from target generation and geophysical surveying to drilling is 

considered appropriate.  Given the typical pyramidal progression of exploration targets to 

defined resources, it should be expected that most of the Mukuba targets may not result in 

mineral resources.  Coffey Mining considers it that some of the early drilling that has 

intersected mineralised intersections will require follow up drilling.  Should that follow-up 

drilling suggest possible economic potential, Mukuba will be in a position to commence 

resource definition drilling. 

Even assuming successive positive results, and appropriate allocation of resources, 

conversion of advanced exploration targets to bankable resources is likely to be an extended 

process.

11.3 Drilling by Current Owners (2009) 

The VTEM survey completed in 2008 highlighted 21 conductors and potential target areas for 

further follow-up.  Of these targets, eight were interpreted to be less than 100m below surface.  

Ranking of the target areas was based on a combination of coincident VTEM/aeromagnetics 

response, geology host rock, soil geochemistry and conductor depth below surface.  Seven 

target areas were selected for drill testing in 2009.   

A program of shallow RC drill holes was planned, however poor ground conditions, high water 

table and difficulties in maintaining a good quality sample resulted in the program being 

terminated after the second attempt at completing a hole at Target #18 (St. Anthony's).  A 

decision was made to change the drilling method from RC to diamond drilling.

11.3.1 Logging 

Logging of the RC chips was undertaken on site using the appropriate protocols. 

The logging of the diamond core was undertaken using a template and an agreed set of 

lithology, mineralisation, alteration codes.  Mukuba started rationalising these codes during 

the initial drilling.  The logging is currently onto hard copy.  The geologists undertaking the 

logging are supervised on site to ensure consistency in logging and as an important aspect of 

the quality control. 

11.3.2 Sampling 

Sampling of the RC drill holes was undertaken at 1m intervals at the drill sites.  Every metre 

sample was riffle split on site and approximately 2kg of the original sample material submitted 

for analysis to SGS in Kalulushi, Zambia.  One standard reference sample was inserted into 

the sample sequence per drill hole.  A total of 108 samples were dispatched for analysis. 

The drill core was taken to a central field core processing facility.  Sampling of the core was 

undertaken at approximately 1m sample intervals through the interpreted conductor or where 

sulphide mineralisation was observed.  The samples were spilt using a diamond saw.  

Samples were bagged and send to the SGS laboratory at Kalulushi.  Standard reference 

samples (a certified blank and 3 certified copper bearing standard reference material) were 

inserted into the sample sequence at a frequency of approximately 1:20 samples.  A total of

1,454 samples (including 61 standard reference samples) were dispatched for analysis to 

SGS – Kalulushi. 

11.3.3 Interpretations and Results 

Target #03 - Puku Area 

The target is a mineralised, brecciated and gossanous fault zone.  A grab sample reported 

1.57% Cu.  The target has been trenched along 330m of its strike length in nine trenches with 

assays values of up to 0.22% Cu being reported (Main pit / Trench 9). 

The lithology of the host rock in the area is carbonaceous shale and sandstone of the 

Mwashia Subgroup. 

A weak VTEM conductor and aeromagnetic structure trending SE-NW has been observed.  

The Puku West pits are a further 1.5km NW of Puku. 

A soil geochemical anomaly confirmed the presence of copper mineralization in soil and an 

extension of the soil grid over the Puku target has been completed to cover the strike between 

Puku and Puku West pits. 

Three drill holes were drilled in 2009 (NC003, NC004 and NC005).  They confirmed the 

mineralized, brecciated fault zone at depth, dipping towards the north and exposed on surface 

in the trenches (Figure 11.3.3_1).

Target #21 – Luswishi Road 

The target is a strong VTEM conductor 

The lithology of the host rock is interpreted to be carbonaceous shale and sandstone of the 

Mwashia / Lower Kundelungu Subgroups. 

The target was drill tested with drill hole NC007 which intersected graphitic carbonaceous 

shale before stopping in dolomitic limestone and sandstone with variable pyrite mineralization 

(Figure 11.3.3_2).

Target #04 – Kafue North of Machiya 

The target is a strong VTEM and aeromagnetics anomaly close to the interpreted contact with 

Lower Roan lithologies and the aeromagnetic anomalies which were interpreted as indicating 

thrust zones by SRK.  A soil geochemical anomaly in the soil reported up to 38ppm Cu. 

The target was drill tested with drill hole NC011 which intersected dolomite, highly chloritic 

shale/schists and a thick succession of pyritic, carbonaceous (graphitic) shale and two 

breccias zones possibly as a result of the thrusting/faulting suggested by SRK 

(Figure 11.3.3_4).

Target #19 – Chankalamu 

The target is a steeply, westerly dipping weak VTEM conductor with a coincident strong 

aeromagnetic anomaly.  A soil geochemical anomaly reports values up to 36ppm Cu. 

The target was drill tested with drill hole NC010 which is intersected as two steep dipping 

gabbroic dykes.  The upper target is more schistose and possibly the source of the magnetic 

anomaly.  Pyrite mineralization is reported in the dolomite and chlorite altered shale units 

(Figure 11.3.3_5).

Target #15 – Munkumpu  

The target is a strong, westerly dipping VTEM conductor associated with a soil geochemical 

anomaly of up to 167ppm Cu.  The underlying geology interpreted to be within the Mwashia / 

Kundelungu Subgroups close to the Lower Roan contact towards the west. 

The target was drill tested  with drill hole NC008 which intersected carbonaceous, graphitic 

shale from surface with well developed pyrite stringers (Figure 11.3.3_6)..

Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Target #18 St. Anthony 

The target is defined by a strong, broad VTEM conductor with a NNW trending structural 

feature located approximately 900m west of the drill holes.  Good, broad soil geochemical 

anomaly with copper in soil values of up to 315ppm.  The target is located at the NE end of a 

larger (15km x 3km) interpreted synclinal basin of Mwashia Subgroup sediments with 

Target #17 (Woodlands Estate) located towards the SW end. 

The target at St Anthony was drill tested with five drill holes, two RC drill holes (NC001 and 

NC002) and three diamond drill holes (NC006, NC012 and NC013).  The two RC holes were 

abandoned due to ground conditions and diamond drilling was preferred. 

Drill holes NC006, NC012 and NC013 were drilled along section, 50m apart to test the target 

(Figure 11.3.3_7).  Variably altered and brecciated zones were intersected indicating the 

possible proximity of a fault / shear zone and conduit for any remobilized copper 

mineralization. 

Pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite are the main sulphides observed with primary and 

remobilized chalcopyrite observed along foliated black shale bedding.

11.3.4 Coffey Mining Technical Assessment  

The drilling has been conducted by a professional drilling contractor.  The drills are in a good 

condition and the drill sites professionally managed.   

The management of the drilling programme by Mukuba is to international standard.  The 

teething problems experienced are dealt with in a pragmatic way. 

The drilling results confirm the presence of anomalies.  Some work is still required to define 

the geology so that future drilling and ultimately resource drilling can be undertaken. 

Coffey Mining observes that the anomalies and targets identified cannot and should not be 

interpreted as indicating a mineral deposit.  Some work is still required to define the geology 

so that future drilling and ultimately resource drilling may be undertaken.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The sampling undertaken is aimed at confirming the regional geology and providing data in 

respect of potential targets and is not intended for mineral resource estimation.  The sampling 

is considered appropriate for the early stage of the project.   

12.1 Samples from Drilling 

Data only exists for some historic drill holes.  This data is typically recorded on plan or section.  

No original geological or sample logs of the historical drilling are available. 

12.2 Soil Samples 

All soil samples were collected from the B-Horizon (approx. 30cm below surface) at 

predetermined locations.  The sampling team commences their daily programme at the 

beginning of a line.  The start point is identified and the first pit excavated.  Due care is taken 

to remove the vegetation from the site.  The pit is dug to approximately 30cm.  The pit is 

cleared of all loose material prior to the sample being taken.  The sample is taken and put into 

a labelled plastic bag.  The bag is appropriately sealed.  The site coordinate are recorded as 

well as appropriate details of colour, vegetation, slope etc.   

The samples are taken back to the field camp for processing.  The samples are dried prior to 

being sieved to -80mesh (180micron) prior to being dispatched to Genalysis in Johannesburg 

for further sample preparation before being forwarded to Perth for analysis.  Field duplicates 

and certified reference material (1 blank and 2 standards) were inserted at regular intervals (at 

an approximate ration of 1:50).  In-house quality control of the results was done by comparing 

the field duplicate and original assay as well as laboratory check against the original sample 

value. 

An operating manual exists which is used as a reference.  A senior project geologist visits site 

on a regular basis (fortnightly) to ensure adherence to standards.  Soil samples have been 

taken utilising industry standards.   

12.3 Drill hole Samples 

Once the diamond core has been marked and photographed, it is ready for splitting.  All core 

sample marks are to cut perpendicular to the core axis prior to core splitting unless a natural 

break occurs.  Once the core is split, it is to be placed back into the core tray for marking.  The 

bagged and labelled samples were sent to the SGS laboratory in Kalaushi, Zambia.   

A QA/QC programme (standards, blanks and duplicates) has been instituted although the 

drilling is currently fro target identification and not resource drilling.  This allows Mukuba to 

confirm the performance of the laboratory and to generate protocols for field staff.

12.4 Coffey Mining Technical Review 

The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) have been documented.  The stated objective of 

these SOPs is to ensure a uniform approach to the evaluation of a project/mineral 

occurrence/resource; that will facilitate database creation, compliance/standardization and 

usage by future geologists, contractors, or other non geological disciplines.  An objective is to 

facilitate auditing of the resultant technical database by Joint Venture partners, resource 

consultants and financial institutions as is required. 

The procedures followed in the field are undertaken in a systematic way by well trained 

personnel.  The sampling should be considered to be taken in an appropriate and professional 

manner.  The on site supervision (geologists) understand the requirements and enforced the 

necessary compliance to the set standards.   

The SGS Laboratory in Zambia is a relatively newly established laboratory.  The senior 

personnel are knowledgeable and have set up a professional facility.  Mukuba is using the 

currently exploration programmes to test the precision and accuracy of the SGS laboratory 

prior to any resource drilling. 

The sampling has not been conducted by an employee, officer, director or associate of the 

issuer.  Coffey Mining is satisfied that the work undertaken is to recognised standards and is 

adequate for the purposes intended.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

13.1 Historical Data 

Detailed information on the sample preparation process for historical data is not available.  No 

mineral resources have been estimated with the data being used for anomaly generation and 

delineation.   

13.2 Current Exploration 

The soil samples taken in the 2007/08 field season and the check samples taken in the 2009 

field season were submitted to Genalysis in Johannesburg.  Sample preparation is 

undertaken in the Johannesburg preparation facility and the assay sample split sent to Perth 

for Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Zn determinations by Genalysis.  Genalysis is a NATA accredited 

laboratory, internationally recognised to operate in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 and has 

been issued with accreditation number 3244.   

The soil samples were subjected to a perchloric acid oxidative digest with hydrochloric acid 

final leach; flame AAS for Cu (detection limit: 1ppm), Ni (detection limit: 1ppm), Co (detection 

limit: 1ppm), Zn (detection limit: 1ppm), Pb (detection limit: 5ppm) [method code C/AAS]. 

The diamond drill core samples submitted in 2007 and 2009 from the Kantobo drilling were 

subjected to a four acid digest (including hydrofluoric acid); ICP-OES for Cu (detection limit: 

1ppm), Ni (detection limit: 1ppm), Co (detection limit: 1ppm), Zn (detection limit: 1ppm), Pb 

(detection limit: 5ppm) [method code A/OES]. 

All samples dispatched to Genalysis in Johannesburg were via a road courier service 

operating from Ndola (Pine Sales and Services) and with the necessary permissions from the 

Ministry of Mines and Geological Survey in Lusaka for the export of samples from Zambia. 

The samples collected during the current field season were submitted to SGS Laboratory in 

Kalulushi.  Zambia.  Selected check samples were submitted to Genalysis in Perth for 

analysis. 

The soil samples were subjected to a mixed acid (HNO3/HClO4/HCl/HF) digest (Code: 

DIG42U) using a 1.00g pulp.  Digestion temperature is set at 200ºC for 45 minutes.  The bulk 

up volume is 100ml.  An AAS finish on bulked up solution for Cu (1ppm), Co (1ppm), Ni 

(1ppm), Mn (1ppm), Pb (1ppm) and Zn (1ppm) – Code: AAS42U. 

The diamond drill core, RC chip and rock samples are subjected to a mixed acid 

(HNO3/HClO4/HCl/HF) digest (Code: DIG42S) using a 0.40g pulp.  The digestion temperature 

is set at 200ºC for 45 minutes.  Bulk up volume is 100ml.  AAS finish on bulked solution for Cu 

(2.50ppm), Co (2.50ppm), Ni (2.50ppm), Mn (2.50ppm), Pb (2.50ppm), Zn (2.50ppm) and Fe 

(0.01%) – Code: AAS42S.

13.3 Coffey Mining Technical Review 

Coffey Mining is of the opinion that the on-site sample preparation is being undertaken in 

accordance with the stated standard procedures and these procedures are adequate in terms 

of sample preparation, security and analytical procedures.  The standards are suitably 

enforced by the on site supervision.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 

14.1 Historical Drilling 

Due to the lack of documentation of previous exploration work, it has not been possible to 

verify the previous work.  The procedures and methods applied for the exploration by previous 

owners are considered to have been to industry standard at the time of conducting the work.  

The information is therefore considered to be of sufficient standard to assist in target 

generation but it has yet to be demonstrated that the data is of a quality suitable for mineral 

resource estimation.  Mukuba have adopted the approach that new data will be generated for 

mineral resource estimation as and when required.  Coffey Mining supports this approach to 

the use of the historic data and information.   

14.2 Soil Sampling 

The entire process from generation of sampling positions, taking the samples, sieving and 

preparing for dispatch has been observed and verified by Coffey Mining.  The process is 

documented n the Operation Manual.  All aspects of the work are considered as being 

undertaken to a professional level by personnel who are suitably trained.  Suitable protocols 

are in place to prevent contamination, sample swapping etc.  Confidence can be attributed to 

the results of the soil sampling programmes. 

14.3 Drilling by Current Owners 

The drilling undertaken in 2007 has not been directly observed by Coffey Mining.  However, 

various photographs and other documentation have been provided confirming that the work 

has been undertaken to a high level of quality.  The management of the drilling has been 

undertaken by qualified personnel with a proven track record.  The quality of the current 

exploration activities supports the fact that the drilling was undertaken to internationally 

recognised standards.   

The drilling undertaken in 2009 was observed by Coffey Mining.  The contractor is a reputable 

drilling contractor on the Copperbelt.  The drill rigs are generally is a good working condition 

and the drill sites are organised in a professional manner.  The core was generally of a high 

quality with good recoveries except where ground conditions were poor. 

Coffey Mining has verified the procedures, protocols and operations but no independent data 

verification has been undertaken at this time because these projects are still early stage 

exploration.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

Numerous major Cu-Co mines exist on the Zambian Copperbelt close to the licenses 

(Figure 7.2_1 and Figure 15_1).  The deposits of the Lufilian Arc have produced significant 

quantities of base metals over the last century.  Notwithstanding the significant production 

from this area, there are still large mineral resources and reserves being reported 

(Table 15_1).  After a century of mining, the Central African Copperbelt is estimated to contain 

more than half of the total copper previously defined as mineral resources and reserves.  

Production in Zambia peaked at about 730,000t of copper metal in 1969, and the DRC metal 

production averaged about 450,000t over many years.  Recent production in Zambia is 

reported to be 582,000t (2007estimate) of finished copper.

The reader should note that the QP has been unable to verify the adjacent property 

information and that the information is not necessarily indicative of any mineralisation on this 

property.  There can be no certainty as to whether the properties reported here may host 

similar mineralisation or show comparable economic potential

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1 Copper Markets  

18.1.1 Introduction 

Copper is one of the most widely used metals in the world and third highest tonnage after 

steel and aluminium.  Copper is used in many industry sectors, building, construction, 

electrical and electronics account for two-thirds of primary consumption with industrial 

machinery and consumer goods making the rest.  Copper is the best non-precious metal 

conductor of electricity, and excellent conductor of heat. It is ductile and resists corrosion.  

Copper is used in the form of wires and tubing, to conduct electricity and heat and transport 

fluids (mainly water).  It is alloyed with other metals notably tin and zinc to make corrosion 

resistant bronze and brass for machinery, plumbing and decoration.  Copper's antiseptic 

properties are exploited in tubing for heating and cooling equipment as it inhibits the growth of 

bacteria, fungi and viruses in water bearing systems.  Copper is also an important constituent 

in coinage. 

18.1.2 Copper Demand 

Demand for copper comes primarily from construction, electronics and industrial machinery.  

The housing construction boom in North America and huge increases in manufacturing 

capacity in China has resulted in an increase demand for copper in the last few years.  As 

societies become more affluent, copper demand increases as more is need for basic 

infrastructure and housing.

Figure 18.12_2 

World Copper Usage (Source; ICSG) 

 

 

From 1960 to 1997 world copper consumption leapt from 3,735kt to 13,084kt to estimated 

demand of >17,500kt in 2007.  The term 'consumption', as used in this document, means the 

use of refined copper products to manufacture or build something else, not end user/retail 

consumer consumption.  Therefore the consumption figures are necessarily skewed toward 

manufacturing countries rather than end use.  Consumption increases have been the largest 

in the industrialized northern regions of the Americas, Western Europe and Asia. 

China outstripped the United States as the largest copper consuming country in 2002, and 

maintains significant potential for ongoing growth.  Connecting Asia, reveals per-capita refined 

copper consumption is only one-quarter of the level in Western Europe, the United States and 

Japan.  AME forecasts that China will account for 23% of global consumption in 2008 

(Figure 18.12_3) up from only 10% in 1996.  US refined copper consumption peaked in 2000 

at 3,025,000 metric tonnes and has decline to 2,270,000 metric tonnes in 2005.  This shift is a 

combination of increased end consumer consumption in Asia, the relocation of labour 

intensive manufacturing out of the USA to Asia and the increase in refining capacity in 

products for export.

Predicted Consumption by Region 2008 (source AME www.ame.com.au ) 

 

 

18.2 Copper Production 

As demand has risen, global copper production capacity has also grown.  Centres of mining 

are concentrated in the Americas along the Western Mountain Ranges of the USA, Chile, 

Peru and Mexico with these countries accounting for 57% of the world's production, Indonesia 

and Australia account for another 12%.  The Central African Copper Belt produces some 

700,000 tons (short) per year with neighbouring areas in South Africa and Namibia adding 

another 100,000 tons. 

Since 1995 world mine production has increased in most areas of the world, the exceptions 

being North America and until 2001 Africa.  Most of this increase in production has been 

sourced from Chile.

Chilean Mine Production vs Rest of the World 

 

18.3 Metals Prices 

Technology break-throughs in extracting copper economically from low grade ores has lead to 

the development of the massive porphyry deposits of Chile and Indonesia.  Over the last 15 

years worldwide mine copper production has increased from 9.2Mt (short) to an estimated 

17Mt in 2007.  These production increases have allowed the real price of copper to drop 

despite the equally large demand.  In 2004 prices started to climb due in part due to low 

copper stocks but also due to speculative 'demand' on commodities markets 

(Figure 18.14_1). 

Factors affecting the nominal price of copper are genuine manufacturing demand and mine 

supply the relative strength of the US Dollar and speculative demand.  As can be seen in 

Figure 18.14_2 Copper prices have generally followed an expected supply and demand 

relationship.  When metal stocks are sufficient or in surplus, prices are low, and when stocks 

are low, price levels and volatility rise.  Extreme price swings have been characteristic of the 

copper market for at least the last century (Figure 18.14_3).

Regarding the economic outlook for copper, Mining Weekly (Oct 12 - 18 2007) summarised 

the key findings of a comprehensive Credit Suisse analysts report thus:- 

 Demand for copper is reported to have been growing on average at 3.9% per year for the 

past 10 years, with new 2008 supply only feeding an additional 2.3% into the market.  

Longer term, they see the demand-supply position then reversing, and estimate that 

global copper demand will need to grow at higher than 4.3% per year to keep the balance 

between supply and demand in the market.   

 Credit Suisse have identified 66 new projects, which will all have to come in on schedule, 

which they doubt will happen.  Based on ongoing global labour and equipment shortages, 

low copper grades from traditional South American sources, political and infrastructural 

risk from Central African sources, and the need for upfront funding of US$66-billion, 

Credit Suisse doubt that these project will come in on schedule.  They estimate that long 

term supply growth could reduce to only 3.6% per year should delays occur at these 

projects, which is 0.3% below the average annual market growth over the last 10 years. 

 Chile has, in the past 17 years, provided two-thirds of the world's growth in mined supply.  

It is now expected to contribute only a quarter of the 8.2Mt of incremental copper 

production that the 66 projects are expected to provide as future Chilean copper 

production appears to be plateauing.  While the 15 new Chilean projects have nearly 

80Mt of contained copper, which represents 5 years of global production and 22% of the 

contained copper in the 66 projects, the average grade is only 0.6%.  Similarly, the 13 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  110 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

new Peruvian projects contain 63Mt of copper, four years of global production, also at 

grades of only 0.6%. 

 By contrast, the contained metal of the DRC and Zambia projects is less than half of the 

Chilean and Peruvian Projects, they have far higher grades (two to eight times higher) 

and are expected to be less capital intensive (US$4,568/t compared to US$6,000/t for the 

South American projects).

19 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Mukuba license holdings in Zambia are extensive and cover significant strike of 

prospective ground close to major producing or past-producing mines.  The licenses 

potentially contain significant endowments of Cu, Co, Zn, Pb and Ni, with potential for by-

product sulphuric acid and Au. 

The whole lease area has been subdivided into a number of areas or prospects.  Below is a 

summary of the knowledge of each of these prospects 

19.1 Kantobo Prospect 

The Kantobo Prospect is underlain by stratigraphically younger Kundelungu sediments of the 

Katanga Sequence.  The area was previously exploited for secondary copper mineralization 

hosted in a brecciated, saprolitic phyllite zone. 

The detailed soil geochemical grids completed in 2007 did not indicate any significant lateral 

extensions to the Kantobo prospect.  Detailed soil sampling in the SW corner of the license 

block confirmed the historically identified copper/zinc in soil anomaly striking NW towards the 

Wambo target area on the Lunga Prospect area (Nthere license – PLLS363). 

The six drill holes drilled by Northcore in 2007 (722.63m) confirmed the presence of copper 

mineralisation.  The assays from drill hole KTM003 returned peak values of 0.77% Cu over an 

interval of 0.20m (Quartz vein) and 0.70% Cu over 1.00m from a depth of 44.20m and an 

intersection of 0.47% Cu over 14.00m from a depth of 41.00m.  Assay results from drill hole 

KTM004 returned a maximum intersection value of 0.16% Cu over 3.00m from a depth of 

93.00m.  Drill hole KTM006 returned a peak value of 0.79% Cu over 1.00m from a depth of 

50.00m and maximum intersection value of 0.47% Cu over 3.00m from a depth of 49.00m. 

19.2 North West Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 202km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies underlies the North West Quadrant 

Prospects.  This includes over 61 linear km of Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  These 

contact zones have been covered by regional soil geochemical traverses spaced approx. 1km 

apart.  Seven historical geochemical targets are located within the prospect area and have 

been covered by soil sample lines with moderate to anomalous values being returned. 

The VTEM survey in 2008 identified two possible drill sites (#01 and #20) in two separate 

target areas (1a and 1b) with moderate soil geochemical coincidence.  At least three soil 

geochemical targets have been identified north of the area covered by the 2008 VTEM 

survey.  Additional sampling will be considered to confirm the lateral extent of one target area 

into the Basement lithologies from the Upper Roan, possibly indicating mineralization along a 

geological structure. 



 Coffey Mining (SA) Pty Ltd 

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  112 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

A detailed airborne magnetic and radiometric survey is planned to cover the northern portion 

of the project area. 

19.3 North East Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 425km
2
 of Lower Roan host lithologies and over 47km

2
 of undifferentiated Lower 

Roan rocks underlies the North East Quadrant Prospects.  This includes over 74 linear km of 

Basement/Lower Roan contact zone 

The prospect area was not covered by VTEM or completely by soil traverses during the 2008 

field season.   

The Kapilamikwa and Tomato showings (Artisinal) presumably for "gemstones" are located 

within this project area.  A detailed grid was completed over the Tomato showing.  However, 

no indication of copper mineralization was detected.  Grab rock samples from both the 

Kapilamikwa and Tomato showings did not return any copper mineralization. 

The 2009 field season covered the contact zone of the Basement/Lower Roan and Upper 

Roan lithologies with regional soil sampling and geological mapping.  A detailed airborne 

magnetic and radiometric survey is planned to cover the prospect area as well as regional, 

widely spaced soil sampling lines. 

A single historical geochemical target (1) locates within the project area 

19.4 South East Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 333km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies underlies the South East Quadrant 

Prospects.  This includes over 26 linear km of Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  

Basement/Lower Roan/Upper Roan contact zones were covered by regional soil 

geochemical, traverses spaced approx. 1km apart.  Nine historical geochemical targets are 

located within the prospect area and have been covered by soil sample lines and returned 

poor to highly anomalous values.  Grab rock samples returned a maximum copper value of 

0.31% from a sample in close proximity to proposed drill hole #15.   

The Northern portion of the license area was not covered by the 2008 VTEM survey.  The 

VTEM survey in 2008 identified nine possible drill sites (#6 - #10, #15 - #18) in four separate 

target areas (5 – 8) with poor to highly anomalous coincident soil geochemical responses and 

underlain by interpreted stratigraphically younger Mwashia Group lithologies (mainly shale).   

19.5 South West Quadrant Prospects 

An area of 315km2 of Lower Roan host lithologies and over 308km2 of undifferentiated Lower 

Roan rocks underlies the South West Quadrant Prospects.  This includes over 33 linear km of 

Basement/Lower Roan contact zone.  The detailed soil geochemical grid over the South West 

Quadrant Prospects demonstrated lateral extensions to the SE.  Basement/Lower 

Roan/Upper Roan contact zones covered by regional soil geochemical, traverses spaced

approx. 1km apart with encouraging results and closely associated with the VTEM target 

areas. 

The historical trenches at the Puku Showing exposed a silicified, gossanous fault zone, grab 

rock sample returned 1.57% Cu.  Nine trenches were excavated along a strike length of 

approximately 330m.  A maximum value of 2,120ppm Cu/1.00m from weathered graphitic 

shale horizon confirms the overlying soil geochemical sampling across the area that returned 

a peak value of 103ppm Cu.  Shallow pits and trenches located NW of Puku were sampled.  

No copper mineralization was detected from the mainly quartz vein material exposed by 

artisanal gemstone prospectors.  Four historical geochemical targets located within the 

prospect area and covered by soil sample lines and returned poor to moderate copper values. 

The VTEM survey in 2008 identified ten possible drill sites (#2 - #5, #11 – #14, #19 and #21) 

in four separate target areas (2a, 2b, 3 and 4) with poor to anomalous coincident soil 

geochemical responses and underlain primarily by Lower Roan lithologies. 

Target #3 was drilled (Drill holes: NC003, NC004 and NC005) in 2009.  The drill holes 

confirmed a mineralized, brecciated fault zone at depth, dipping towards the north that had 

been exposed on surface in the trenches.  Peak copper concentrations of 0.17% (NC003) 

over 1m, 0.25% (NC004) over 1m and 0.14% (NC005) were intersected.   

19.6 Further Conclusions 

Coffey Mining considers the Zambian Copperbelt to be mature from an exploration 

perspective.  This is based on extensive surface exploration carried out by previous owners.  

Consequently, Coffey Mining considers that new discoveries are most likely to be made by the 

application of high-tech target generation techniques, systematic use of conventional 

exploration methods and drilling.  There is considerable potential to discover base metal 

mineralisation on licenses held by Mukuba.  Although Coffey Mining has not investigated the 

whole target generation procedure in detail, Mukuba appears to have applied thought and due 

diligence to the target generation process.   

The exploration undertaken has been in accordance with the defined strategy.  The 

exploration has confirmed the underlying geology and validated the approach being 

undertaken.  In addition the information gained has improved the understanding of the 

geology and provided confidence that anomalies will be found that potentially could be 

advanced by diamond drilling. 

Coffey Mining considers it reasonable, however, that some of the early drilling will result in 

mineralised intersections, and that follow up drilling will be required.  Should that follow-up 

drilling suggest possible economic potential, Mukuba will be in a position to commence 

resource definition drilling.

Mukuba Resources Limited Page:  114 
Independent Review of Geology and Exploration – September 2009 

Even assuming successive positive results, and appropriate allocation of resources, 

conversion of advanced exploration targets to bankable feasibility is likely to be an extended 

process.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

20.1 Planned Exploration 

The Company's two year exploration strategy is:- 

 Continued examination of existing historical exploration records to consolidate data and 

to identify potential targets areas. 

 Continued Target Generation via satellite imagery, and airborne geophysical surveys and 

through mapping and soil and rock chip sampling (Figure 20.1_1). 

 Evaluate the most prospective deposits targets and mineral occurrences by means of 

trenching and drilling. 

 Drill and sample most prospective occurrences 

 Undertake follow up drilling where mineralisation has been intersected. 

Two of the target areas (Puku and St Anthony) have been prioritized for further work in 2010 

because of their association and proximity to large, regional structures and copper 

mineralization.  One is a shear zone that extends SE-NW across much of the southern part of 

the license and the other is a basin-like structure identified from the VTEM survey that is 

approximately 16km x 5km in extent at surface with an interpreted vertical depth of around 

400m. 

Mukuba's planned progression from target generation and geophysical surveying to drilling is 

considered appropriate.  Given the typical pyramidal progression of exploration targets to 

defined resources, it should be expected that most of the Mukuba targets may not result in 

mineral resources.

Note:    With the exception of some small administrative expense allocations for the Lunga (Kantobo) Prospect 

area, the planned exploration expenditure is dedicated to the Northcore Prospect area 
 

 

The work is planned to commence in March 2010, as soon as the rainy season has passed 

and the main access roads are passable with the airborne magnetic and radiometric survey, 

follow up soil sampling and drilling commencing soon thereafter.  Soil sampling (12,500 

samples) with both regional soil sampling and closely spaced or detailed grid sampling on 

geophysical and geological targets, have been planned.  The sample spacing of these will 

vary on the detailed grids with between 100 - 200m line spacing and 25m sample spacings.  

The regional soil sampling will vary between the current spacing of 2,000m and 400m line 

spacing and 50m sample spacing. 

A detailed aeromagnetic / radiometric survey is planned to cover the remaining license area of 

approximately 11,150line km, and has been tentatively scheduled for April 2010.  In addition, 

a radiometric survey (13,390lkm) covering the southern part of the large license area (area of 

the VTEM survey in 2008) and Ground IP (induced polarisation) geophysics (15 - 20 grids of 

2x3km) has been planned.   

Approximately 2,500m of NQ/HQ core drilling utilising two drill rigs is planned to complete a 

program focusing mainly on the identified geophysical targets as well as any other targets that 

may warrant drilling that are identified during the current ground work (soil sampling and 

mapping).  Drilling depths will depend on the estimated depth to the interpreted top of the 

geophysical targets and this will determine the number of drill holes.  Currently it is estimated 

that some 20 drill holes will be drilled to about 125m depth.  Most of the drilled core will be 

sampled for an estimated 2,500 samples, including QA/QC samples.  Drill holes will be
