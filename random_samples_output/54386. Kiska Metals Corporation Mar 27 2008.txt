Executive Summary 

Introduction 
 
The Azulitas Prospect is a polymetallic sulphide deposit located within the La Noria 
exploration project in the State of Sinaloa Mexico, approximately sixty kilometres 
northeast of the town of Mazatlan. The La Noria property was acquired by 
Geoinformatics Exploration Inc. ("Geoinformatics") in May, 2006 as part of a strategic 
alliance with Kennecott Exploration Company ("Kennecott"). 
 
SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") was retained by Geoinformatics to prepare an 
initial mineral resource estimate for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit. This technical 
report documents the resource model constructed by SRK for the Azulitas copper-
molybdenum deposit. It was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian 
Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in 
conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". SRK visited the Azulitas project in March 
2006 and in December 2007. 

Property Description and Agreements 
 
The La Noria property covers an area of approximately 16,650 hectares under a lease 
to Kennecott. Geoinformatics' rights to the La Noria project were acquired from 
Kennecott at no cost and as a "target of merit" under a Master Strategic Alliance 
Agreement. Kennecott retains certain back-in rights to acquire up to sixty percent of 
the project or a two percent net smelter royalty. 

Location, Access and Physiography 
 
The Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit is located approximately sixty kilometres 
northeast of the city and port of Mazatlan. The project is readily accessible by road. 
The centre of the property is located at 106.1177 degrees longitude west and 23.5893 
degrees latitude north; its boundaries have been legally surveyed. 
 
The project lies in the foothills of the Sierra Madre within the Rio Presidio watershed. 
The average elevation varies between 160 and 250 metres above mean sea level. This 
area is characterized by semi-tropical climate with a short wet season extending from 
mid-June to mid-September and a longer dry season throughout the remainder of the 
year. 

History 
 
There is very little information available on the history of exploration of the La Noria 
area prior to the work by Kennecott.  
 
During 2004 and 2005, a Mexican subsidiary of Kennecott undertook reconnaissance 
exploration work over the La Noria concession. Kennecott drilled twelve core 
boreholes (2,444 metres) in 2005 to investigate several targets. Six boreholes were 
drilled into the Azulitas prospect; four holes were drilled into the Las Minas prospect 
and two other holes investigated other targets. 
 
Following the acquisition of the project in 2006, Geoinformatics completed additional 
reconnaissance work and drilled twenty-five core boreholes in 2006 and 2007. Nine 
holes were drilled into the Azulitas prospect:  one at Amarillito, four at La Verde, two

at East Copales, six at El Naranjo and three into various parts of a large geophysical 
target located to the south of the Azulitas prospect.  

Regional and Local Geology 
 
The La Noria property is located on the western flank of a northwest trending 
Cretaceous-Palaeocene granitic batholithic zone that extends north from Sinaloa 
through Sonora; the zone forms part of the Laramide orogeny.  
 
The Laramide orogeny involved east-northeast to west-southwest directed shortening 
during the Late Cretaceous to the early Eocene (~80-40 million years ago)which gave 
rise to the Rocky Mountain fold and thrust belt in Canada. Laramide block uplifts in 
the USA and the Sierra Oriental fold and thrust belt in Mexico. The associated 
magmatic arc was relatively stationary on the western side of Baja California but 
slowly migrated to Sonora at about 90Ma. As a result, widespread magmatism and 
associated hydrothermal sulphide deposits shifted rapidly to the east, which resulted in 
a shift of calc-alkaline rocks in the west to progressively more alkaline rocks in the 
east. 
 
The La Noria concession is located on the western margin of a Cretaceous batholith 
that has intruded Cretaceous and Palaeozoic metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. This 
rock package was uplifted and it is overlain by late Paleogene and Neogene volcanic 
and sedimentary rocks. Regional scale northwest and northeast striking normal faults 
lie to the west and south of the La Noria concession. Locally, the northwest striking 
faults are offset by northeast trending transfer faults. These faults are interpreted to be 
reactivated Cretaceous structures that developed during the Laramide orogeny. 
 
Northwest and northeast striking structures are also the dominant lineaments and 
trends that have been interpreted from remotely sensed datasets. This information 
indicates that the geology of the La Noria concession is similar to that of other 
Laramide areas in northern Mexico and the southwest United States. 

Deposit Types and Mineralization 
 
The La Noria project was acquired by Geoinformatics for its potential to host 
magmatic hydrothermal copper, molybdenum, silver and gold mineralization. 
Magmatic hydrothermal deposits represent a large group of mineral deposits formed 
by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids into fractured rocks associated with the 
intrusion of magma into the crust. Exploration work completed by Kennecott has 
uncovered several copper-molybdenum-silver-gold sulphide occurrences exhibiting 
characteristics indicative of magmatic hydrothermal processes, suggesting that the 
project area is generally highly prospective for magmatic related hydrothermal 
deposits. 
 
The Azulitas prospect consists of a breccia and fracture-filling polymetallic sulphide 
body contained entirely within a granodiorite intrusion with minor and semi-
porphyritic monzonite phases. Surface drilling and outcrop has delineated a steeply 
plunging pipe-like sulphide body measuring approximately 300 metres in its long axis 
by fifty metres. Hence, the main deposit is structurally controlled with drilling and 
outcrop confirming a body approximately 300 metres long. The main sulphides are 
chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite with minor bornite, sphalerite and galena. 
In the periphery of the body, sulphides fill fracture sets that locally grade into minor 
clast-supported breccias. The deposit exhibits classic early potassic alteration 
characterized by biotite-magnetite-K-feldspar-quartz-chalcopyrite alteration 
assemblages, overprinted by later sericite-chlorite-quartz (intermediate argillic) to 
sericite-quartz-pyrite (phyllic) alteration assemblages. Molybdenum is subordinate to

the copper mineralization and exhibits no direct relationship to chalcopyrite 
mineralization. It occurs as coarse infill within brecciated and highly fractured portions 
of the mineralized system, typically within intense sericite-chlorite altered zones. 

Sampling Method, Approach and Analyses 
 
Kennecott and Geoinformatics used industry best practices to collect, handle and assay 
soil, rock and core samples collected on the La Noria project during the 2005-2007 
period. The procedures are documented in detailed manuals describing all aspects of 
the exploration data collection and management. SRK reviewed the procedures in 
2006 and again in 2007 and found that they generally meet or exceed industry best 
practices. 
 
All core samples were shipped to the ALS Chemex preparation facility in Hermosillo, 
Sonora, Mexico for preparation. Pulverized sub-samples were then shipped to the ISO 
17025 accredited ALS Chemex Laboratory in North Vancouver, British Columbia for 
assaying. Samples were assayed for gold by conventional fire assay and for a suite of 
elements including the usual metals by aqua regia digestion and inductively coupled 
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Kennecott and Geoinformatics used industry 
best practices quality control measures during their exploration at La Noria. 

Data Verifications 
 
In accordance with NI43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the La Noria project on two 
occasions. SRK first visited the project in March 2006 for the preparation of an initial 
technical report for Geoinformatics. During this visit, SRK reviewed the field 
procedures used by Kennecott to collect and to interpret their exploration data for this 
project. SRK also witnessed the extent of the exploration work completed by 
Kennecott and collected a suite of independent verification samples.  
 
SRK returned to the La Noria project in between December 10 and 14, 2007 while 
active drilling was ongoing to witness the extent of the exploration work completed by 
Geoinformatics and to review the field procedures. The purpose of the site visit was to 
inspect and ascertain the geological setting of the Azulitas project, witness the extent 
of historical exploration work carried out on the property and assess logistical aspects 
and other constraints relating to conducting exploration work in this area. 
 
SRK conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability of the 
electronic data provided by Kennecott and Geoinformatics. In the opinion of SRK, the 
electronic data are reliable and exhaustive. 
 
SRK visually examined assaying quality control data produced by Kennecott and 
Geoinformatics. SRK analysed the Kennecott and Geoinformatics quality control data 
using bias charts and various relative precision plots. This review suggests that the 
assay results delivered by ALS Chemex are generally reliable for the purpose of 
resource estimation. SRK found no evidence for sampling or assaying bias in the 
available borehole database. 

Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
The mineral resource model presented herein represents the first resource evaluation 
for the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit. The resource estimate was completed 
by Ebi Ghayem, P.Geo an independent qualified person as this term is defined in 
National Instrument 43-101. The effective date of this resource estimate is February 
12, 2008.

The database used to estimate the Azulitas mineral resources was audited by SRK and 
the sulphide mineralization boundaries were modelled by SRK using a geological 
interpretation prepared by Geoinformatics personnel. The current drilling information 
is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the boundaries of the copper-
molybdenum sulphide mineralization and the assaying data is sufficiently reliable to 
support estimating mineral resources. 
 
From the drilling data two contiguous sulphide mineralization wireframes (IFD and 
ZOX) were modelled. The eastern boundary of the deposit is truncated by a poorly 
constrained fault. Towards the east, the sulphide mineralization is higher grade and 
tapers to forty metres in width. With the current level of understanding, this zone is 
interpreted as a feeder structure to the sulphide mineralization.  
 
After reviewing the probability plots for each metal in each zone, copper and silver 
grades in ZOX zone do not require capping. Capping of outlier molybdenum values 
results in a loss of approximately five and three percent metal in the IFD and ZOX 
zones, respectively. Capping of copper and silver grades results in a six and three 
percent metal loss in the IFD zone. After a review, assay samples for the IFD and ZOX 
zones were composited over 2.0 and 1.5 metre lengths, respectively. 
 
A sub-block model aligned to the local UTM grid was constructed to cover the entire 
extent of the Azulitas deposit. Parent block size was set at five metres in each 
direction. After analysis of fifty-eight core specific gravity measurements, an average 
specific gravity of 2.81 was used to convert volumes into tonnages. 
 
For estimation, kriging was considered but because of a lack of sufficient close range 
sampling it proved extremely difficult to model spatial continuity of copper for each 
geological domain. Therefore, metal grades were estimated using an inverse distance 
squared algorithm. The grade interpolation was constrained within each of the sulphide 
zone solid shells, considering a hard boundary between the two domains.  
 
Mineral resources for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit have been classified according 
to the "CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" 
(December, 2005) by Ebi Ghayem, P.Geo, Senior Resource Geologist and independent 
Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101. All mineral resources for 
the Azulitas deposit are classified as Inferred Mineral Resources on the basis of the 
limited drilling information presently available. SRK is of the opinion that the current 
drilling data are sufficient to demonstrate sufficient geological continuity to support 
resource estimation. However, the level of confidence in the geological interpretation 
is not sufficient to allow application of technical and economical parameters to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. For this reason, 
SRK considers that an Inferred classification is appropriate at this stage in the 
exploration of this deposit.   
 
The mineral resources for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit are reported at a copper 
equivalent grade because four metals are of economic significance. The copper 
equivalent grade is derived using metal price assumptions of US$1.50 per pound of 
copper, US$10.00 per pound of molybdenum oxide, US$550 per ounce of gold and 
US$8.00 per ounce of silver. Metallurgical recoveries of eighty-five percent for copper 
and molybdenum and seventy-five percent for gold and silver were assumed. SRK 
considers that the mineral resources are appropriately stated at a cut-off grade of 0.3 
gpt copper equivalent on the basis that the sulphide mineralization is amenable for 
open pit mining. 
 
The mineral resource statement for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit is presented in 
Table i.

rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the mineral resource estimate. Mineral resources are not 
mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Copper equivalent grade estimated 
based on 85 percent recovery for copper and molybdenum and 75 percent recovery for gold and silver; 
US$1.50 per pound of copper, US$10.00 per pound of molybdenum oxide, US$550 per ounce gold and 
US$8 per ounce silver. 

 

Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource classification 
reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global copper, molybdenum, 
gold and silver mineral resources found in the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit. 
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be 
converted into mineral reserve. 
 
The results of the work to date are of sufficient merit to recommend approximately 
6,000 metres of additional core drilling to improve the confidence in the interpretation 
of the sulphide mineralization boundaries and the interpretation of the geology of the 
Azulitas deposit. SRK is confident that the additional infill drilling will greatly 
improve geostatistical analysis and variography, and allow upgrading the classification 
of the mineral resources from Inferred to Indicated. 
 
On the technical side, SRK recommends the use of certified molybdenum control 
samples during future drilling programs. Geoinformatics should also continue to 
acquire specific gravity data for all rock types irrespective of their sulphide 
mineralization. The acquisition of accurate digital terrain model for the Azulitas area is 
also strongly recommended. 
 
Additional studies can be completed concurrently to the recommended drilling 
program to complete the characterization of the context of the Azulitas polymetallic 
sulphide deposit in preparation for future conceptual engineering studies. Such studies 
include: 
 

• Baseline environmental studies including water quality monitoring, wildlife 
habitats and other studies for which long-term and seasonal data are required 
at the permitting stage; 

• ABA testing and geochemical characterization of sulphide and barren rocks; 
• Bench scale metallurgical studies including petrography, grinding and milling 

testing and metallurgy; 
• Review of geotechnical data including recommendations for improving field 

geotechnical data collection and consideration for specific geotechnical 
drilling. 

 
At the conclusion of the recommended drilling program the geological and resource 
model should be revised. SRK is confident that the additional sampling data should 
allow using a more robust estimator (e.g. kriging).

The total costs for the recommended work program are estimated at approximately 
US$2.8 million and include ten percent contingency and five percent administration 
charges (Table ii). 
 
The recommended exploration program for the Azulitas does not include other 
exploration work Geoinformatics contemplates for other targets within the La Noria 
project.

1 Introduction 
 
The La Noria project is a resource delineation-stage polymetallic exploration 
project located in the Sinaloa state of Mexico. The La Noria project is located 
approximately sixty kilometres northeast of the town of Mazatlan. This 
drilling-stage exploration property contains a number of copper-molybdenum-
gold-silver sulphide occurrences, including the Azulitas copper-molybdenum 
deposit. 
 
Following shortly after the acquisition of the La Noria project from the 
Kennecott Exploration Company ("Kennecott"), Geoinformatics Exploration 
Inc. ("Geoinformatics") mandated SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") to 
visit the La Noria project and prepare an initial independent technical report 
following the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 
guidelines. The technical report was filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on 
May 26, 2006 (Ham, 2006). 
 
During 2006 and 2007, Geoinformatics completed two drilling programs on 
the La Noria project with an initial emphasis on the Azulitas copper-
molybdenum breccia. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Geoinformatics 
mandated SRK to prepare an initial mineral resource model for the Azulitas 
deposit. This technical report documents the resource model constructed by 
SRK. It was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and is in 
conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". 
 

1.1 Scope of work 
 
The scope of work, as defined in the letter of engagement presented to 
Geoinformatics in November 2007, consists of the preparation of an initial 
mineral resource estimate for the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit 
delineated by drilling and of the compilation of an independent technical report 
in compliance with NI43-101 guidelines. National Instrument 43-101 
guidelines and Form NI43-101F1 require an assessment of the following 
aspects of the project: 
 
• Topography, landscape, access; 
• Regional and local geology; 
• Exploration history; 
• Audit of exploration work carried out by Geoinformatics; 
• Mineral resource estimation for the Azulitas deposit; 
• Validation; 
• Recommendations for additional work.

1.2 Work Program 
 
The initial mineral resource estimate for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit is a 
collaborative effort between Geoinformatics and SRK personnel. The 
geological model and outlines for the copper-gold sulphide mineralization 
were constructed by Geoinformatics in November and early December 2007. 
The geostatistical analysis, variography and grade models were completed by 
SRK during the month of January 2008. The mineral resource statement was 
presented to Geoinformatics in early February 2008. 
 
The technical report was assembled in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada during 
the month of February 2008.  
 

1.3 Basis of the Technical Report 
 
This report is based on information collected by SRK during site visits 
performed in 2006 and 2007 while active drilling was ongoing and on 
additional information provided by Geoinformatics. Other information was 
obtained from the public domain. SRK has no reason to doubt the reliability of 
the information provided by Geoinformatics. 
 
This technical report is based on the following sources of information: 
 
• Discussion with Geoinformatics personnel; 
• Inspection of the La Noria project area, including drill core from the 

Azulitas deposit; 
• Review of the exploration data collected by Kennecott and 

Geoinformatics; 
• Additional information from public domain sources.

2 Reliance on other Experts and 
Declaration 
 
 
SRK's opinion contained herein and effective February 12, 2008, is based on 
information provided to SRK by Geoinformatics throughout the course of 
SRK's investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic 
conditions at the time of writing. Given the nature of the mining business, 
these conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time. 
Consequently, actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.   
 
This report includes technical information that may require subsequent 
calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such 
calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 
introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not consider them to 
be material.   
 
SRK is not an insider, associate or an affiliate of Geoinformatics, and neither 
SRK nor any affiliate has acted as advisor to Geoinformatics or its affiliates in 
connection with this project. The results of the technical review by SRK are 
not dependent on any prior agreements concerning the conclusions to be 
reached, nor are there any undisclosed understandings concerning any future 
business dealings. 
 
SRK has not researched ownership information such as property title and 
mineral rights and has relied on information provided by Geoinformatics as to 
the actual status of the mineral titles. 
 
SRK was informed by Geoinformatics that there are no known litigations 
potentially affecting the Azulitas exploration project. 
 
The qualified persons preparing this technical report are not experts in the 
assessment of potential environmental liabilities associated with the Azulitas 
project. As such, no verification was conducted by SRK and no opinion is 
expressed regarding the environmental aspect of this exploration project.

3 Property Description and Location 
 
The Azulitas copper-molybdenum deposit occurs within the La Noria 
exploration property. The La Noria property is located in central Sinaloa State, 
Mexico, approximately sixty kilometres northeast of the resort town of 
Mazatlan (Figure 1). The property has been legally surveyed. The center of the 
property is located 106 degrees, nine minutes and fifty-four seconds longitude 
west and twenty-three degrees, thirty-four minutes and forty eight seconds 
latitude north or 2,608,030m north and 381,310m east (North American Datum 
1927, Zone 13 for Mexico).  
 

3.1 Land Tenure 
 
The La Noria property covers an aggregate area of approximately 14,000 
hectares under a lease to Kennecott (Figure 1 and Table 1).  
 
Six contiguous individual claims are registered to individual property owners 
and are subject to a contract of cession of rights to Kennecott (Table 1). These 
include the Las Minas, El Cascabel, Las Azulitas, La Azulitas I, La Verde and 
La Verde 2 tenements. Kennecott has transferred the rights to these contracts 
to Geoinformatics wholly owned Mexican subsidiary company – Minera 
Geoinformatica S.A. De. C.V. Fourteen other lots are registered to other 
private individuals and are excluded from the La Noria project. The individual 
tenements are surrounded by the La Noria Exploration Concession that covers 
an area of approximately 13,963 hectares that has also been transferred to 
Geoinformatics via its Mexican subsidiary. 
 
The Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit straddles the boundary between the 
La Azulitas and La Azulitas I Claims (Figure 1). All mineral resources are 
located within the latter two tenements.

3.2 Underlying Agreements 
 
Kennecott completed contracts with the six exploration claims between May 
and April 2004 with three property owners (Table 2). To date, a total of 
US$111,000 in payments have been made by Kennecott and a further 
US$120,000 made by Geoinformatics to the property owners, with the option 
to purchase the claims at the end of the five year contract period for a total cost 
of US$1,295,000. Geoinformatics has assumed responsibility for these option 
payments.

Within the La Noria Concession, several areas of mineralization were 
previously identified by the Guggenheim consortium. Exploration by 
Kennecott focussed within the concessions of Azulitas, Las Minas, El 
Cascabel and La Verde (Figure 1).   
 
Geoinformatics rights to the La Noria project arise from a Master Strategic 
Alliance Agreement signed between Geoinformatics and Kennecott. This 
agreement covers exploration tenure and project generation activities in parts 
of British Columbia, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, Chihuahua 
and Sinaloa. A summary of this agreement was by Geoinformatics on SEDAR 
(www.sedar.com).  
 
Under the Kennecott Agreement, Geoinformatics will hold the La Noria 
project in trust and will undertake exploration for deposits of base metals, 
precious metals and uranium, of a size and quality to be of interest to 
Kennecott. Kennecott will have limited time to exercise certain back-in rights 
to acquire fifty-one percent of the project. Kennecott may increase its interest 
to sixty percent by completing a feasibility study for the property. If Kennecott 
elects not to exercise its back-in right, its sole interest will be a 2.0 percent net 
smelter returns ("NSR") royalty.

3.3 Environmental Considerations 
 
The Azulitas project is an undeveloped exploration project. Exploration work 
carried out on the property includes line cutting, ground and airborne 
geophysical surveying, prospecting and diamond drilling. The surface 
disturbances arising from that work are considered minimal. 
 
There are no known native rights issues concerning the project area. 
 
The Rio Presidio (Presidio River) transects the project area. A new dam is 
under construction approximately thirteen kilometres down stream from the 
project area. This dam is designed to provide water supply (irrigation, 
industrial and domestic use) as well as future hydroelectric power for southern 
Sinaloa. Part of the lake formed by the dam will flood up the Presidio valley 
and form a ribbon lake encroaching on to the La Noria project area. Several 
riverside settlements such as Copales are being moved. However this new dam 
is not expected to have a material impact on any potential operations related to 
potential future exploitation of the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit.  
 
Exploration work by Kennecott and Geoinformatics has been conducted in 
accordance with regulations set out to manage exploration activities in the 
State of Sinaloa. These applications concern surface disturbances relating to 
the establishment of drill access roads, drilling activity, and surface line-
cutting for geochemical sampling and geophysics.  The applications and 
exploration permits include the requirement for archaelogical, biological, 
water use and general environmental impact surveys and are conducted in 
accordance with Rule 120 of the General Law for Ecology Equilibrium and 
Environmental Protection and Rule NOM-120-ECOL-1997 relating to water 
mantle (water table) (Mexican law). All permits were granted prior to 
exploration work and no significant issues relating to the various studies are 
apparent.  
 
Geoinformatics (and previously Kennecott) also gained permission for access 
from the local ranchers.  
 
Geoinformatics rent a house in the village of El Placer for core logging, cutting 
and storage. Hence no permit for a specialized exploration camp is required.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local 
Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
 

4.1 Accessibility 
 
The La Noria project is located approximately sixty kilometres northeast of 
Mazatlan in Sinaloa, Mexico. Mazatlan is a commercial hub, port and 
resort/tourist destination that is fully serviced by an international airport. From 
Mazatlan the property is accessed by road first heading ten kilometres north on 
Highway 15 (via freeway to Culiacan), until arriving at the town of the Habal. 
Twenty-three kilometres by road northeast of Habal is the town of the La 
Noria. Travel from La Noria continues on a well maintained dirt road 
approximately nineteen kilometres to the northeast through the town of San 
Marcos and finally to El Placer. The town of the El Placer is situated within 
the area of the La Noria concession. The total distance by road from Mazatlan 
to the project area is approximately sixty-two kilometres (Figure 1), taking 
approximately one and a half hours. 
 
Power lines service a number of small villages that are located within the 
project area. The exploration base camp and core storage lies within the village 
of El Placer.  
 

4.2 Physiography and Climate 
 
The La Noria project area lies within the foothills of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental; elevations on the project area are between 160 and 250 metres 
above mean sea level. La Noria has a semi-tropical climate with a short wet 
season extending from mid-June to mid-September and a longer dry season 
throughout the remainder of the year. Summers are hot and humid with 
daytime highs up to 40 degrees Celsius. Winters are dryer with night time 
temperatures reaching as low as 5 degrees Celsius. Exploration can be 
conducted year around. 
 
Vegetation consists mainly of mesquite, thorny bushes and shrubs, with 
deciduous trees and several species of cacti. During the summer months, dense 
underbrush grows quickly and creeks can rise dramatically with local flash 
flooding. Outside of the monsoonal months, water levels in creeks are low or 
dry with most vegetation barren of leaves during the winter. 
 
The Rio Presidio transects the project area. A new dam is under construction 
approximately thirteen kilometres down stream from the project area. This 
dam is designed to provide hydroelectric power for southern Sinaloa.

5 History 
 
There is very little information available on the history of exploration of the La 
Noria area prior to the work by Kennecott. It is believed that eight to nine drill 
holes were drilled during the 1960's by the Guggenheim Consortium in the 
Azulitas prospect. Data for these holes could not be validated and core is not 
available. The results from this drilling have not been included in the 
Kennecott or Geoinformatics datasets. 
 
Near Las Minas, minor old workings were excavated by local farmers and 
residents, targeting primarily gold mineralization. Some panning of gold of the 
local creeks near the Las Minas prospect by local community has also been 
reported to the Kennecott exploration staff. 
 
During 2004 and 2005, Minera Kennecott, SA de CV, a Mexican subsidiary of 
Kennecott undertook reconnaissance soil and stream sediment sampling, 
mapping, minor bulldozer work, airborne magnetic and rock chip surveys of 
the La Noria concession. Geochemical anomalies from these surveys led to the 
drilling of twelve scout drill holes in the project area.  
 
Of the twelve drill holes, six were drilled into the Azulitas prospect, four into 
the Las Minas and one into the Cerro Colorado areas, with one hole drilled into 
an anomaly north of the Azulitas prospect. Drilling at the Azulitas prospect 
returned the most encouraging results with borehole DDLN05-03 drilled down 
the plunge of sulphide mineralization yielding a core length interval of 165.8 
metres grading an average of 0.76 percent copper, 0.03 percent molybdenum, 
0.10 grams of gold per tonne ("gpt gold") and 14.0 gpt silver. 
 
Since taking over the property in 2006, Geoinformatics have conducted further 
regional reconnaissance work including several extensive soil-sampling 
surveys, ground induced polarization geophysics and drilling. 
 
In total, Geoinformatics have drilled twenty-five core boreholes. Nine holes 
were drilled into the Azulitas prospect; one hole at Amarillito prospect; four 
holes at the La Verde prospect; two holes at the East Copales prospect; six 
holes at the El Naranjo prospect; and three holes into various parts of a large 
induced polarization chargeability anomaly located to the south of the Azulitas 
prospect.

6 Geological Setting 
 

6.1 Regional Geology 
 
(Extracted from Ham, 2006) 
 
The La Noria property is located on the western flank of a northwest trending 
Cretaceous – Palaeocene granitic batholithic zone that extends north from 
Sinaloa through Sonora. Laramide porphyry copper deposits are associated 
with the eastern flanks of this batholithic zone in Sonora (e.g., Cananea and La 
Caridad; Figure 3). Porphyry copper deposits extend into the south-western 
USA (Arizona, New Mexico) and lie within the magmatic arc terrain of the 
western USA (Figure 4; Hildenbrand et al., 2000). 
 
The Laramide orogeny involved east-northeast to west-southwest directed 
shortening during the Late Cretaceous to the early Eocene (~80-40 million 
years ago) that gave rise to the Rocky Mountain fold and thrust belt in Canada, 
and to the Laramide block uplifts in the USA and the Sierra Oriental fold and 
thrust belt in Mexico (Coney and Reynolds, 1977; Bird, 2002). The magmatic 
arc was relatively stationary on the western side of Baja California from about 
120-105 million years ago ("Ma") but slowly migrated to Sonora at about 
90Ma. From 80Ma, the subducting slab along the Pacific Coast shifted 
eastward due to a dip angle rotation of the subducting plate (Farallon plate) to 
a shallower dip (Coney and Reynolds, 1977). As a result, widespread 
magmatism shifted rapidly to the east, which resulted in a shift of calc-alkaline 
rocks in the west to progressively more alkaline rocks in the east (Damon et al, 
1983; Valencia-Moreno et al., 2003). Numerous mineral deposits are related to 
this magmatism in the USA (southern New Mexico, Arizona) and Mexico 
(such as La Caridad dated ~55Ma, Valencia et al., 2005; Staude & Barton, 
2001). 
 
Progressive southwest retreat and steepening of the subducting plate hinge line 
began about 50Ma years ago resulting in uplift of the North American plate 
(Bird, 2002). From about ~40-20Ma calc-alkaline magmatism dominated 
much of central and western Mexico. This stage marks the beginning of 
orogenic collapse/slab roll back in north western Mexico and core complex 
formation with northeast-southwest directed extension (Bird, 2002). From 
about twenty million years ago, local stress fields were dominated by the 
northwest movement of the Pacific plate resulting in predominantly dextral 
shear along the orogenic margin.

Figure 3. Distribution of Laramide mineral deposit types (modified 
from Staude & Barton, 2001). 
 
The significance of the Laramide orogeny and younger plate movement is that 
the orientation of the major structures across both the southwestern  United 
States and western Mexico, are dominated by northwest-southeast and 
northeast-southwest trending structures. Porphyry copper (±Mo or ±Au) 
mineralization within Mexico has a strong northwest trend (Figure 4); the 
mineralization is related to magmatism associated with the Laramide orogeny 
(Staude & Barton, 2001). From northern Mexico to west-central Arizona, a 
650kilometre long belt of copper bearing plutons coincides with strong 
northwest trending structures that are intersected by northeast trending 
structures (Figure 4; Hildenbrand et al., 2000). Within this copper belt 
mineralization is hosted by plutons that are on or adjacent to major northwest 
and northeast striking faults (Hildenbrand et al., 2000).   
 
The La Noria concession is located on the western margin of a Cretaceous 
batholith that has intruded Cretaceous and Palaeozoic metamorphosed 
sedimentary rocks (Figure 5). This rock package was uplifted and  is overlain 
by late Paleogene and Neogene volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Regional-
scale northwest and northeast striking normal faults lie to the west and south of 
the La Noria concession. Locally, the northwest striking faults are offset by 
northeast striking transfer faults. These faults are likely reactivated Cretaceous 
structures that developed during the Laramide orogeny.

Northwest and northeast trending structures are also the dominant lineaments 
and trends that have been interpreted from remotely sensed datasets (Figure 5). 
This interpretation indicates that the geology of the La Noria concession 
contains similar geology and structures found in other areas of the Laramides, 
for instance in northern Mexico and in the south-western United States.

6.2 Property Geology 
 
The La Noria concession is dominated by a Cretaceous granitic batholith 
(Figure 5) with minor outcrops of Tertiary volcanic and Palaeozoic 
metasedimentary rocks. Detailed outcrop mapping undertaken in a 2x2.5km 
area between the Azulitas and Las Minas prospects was carried out by the 
Kennecott exploration team (Figure 6). Outcrops were limited to road cuts, the 
tops of hills and the within creeks.   
 
Several suites of intrusive phases of equigranular granodiorite and monzonite 
were identified, which in turn were intruded by younger andesitic dykes. 
Sulphide mineralization is hosted within intensely fractured portions of the 
granodiorite-monzonite intrusive suite that were mapped as brecciated units.

7 Deposit Types  
 
 
A diverse number of mineral deposits were formed during the Late Cretaceous 
in north-western Mexico (Staude & Barton, 2001). These include copper 
(±molybdenum) porphyries and skarn deposits, which are prevalent in Sinaloa 
and Sonora and form part of the world class porphyry copper (±molybdenum) 
deposits that extend from north-western Arizona through Sonora into Sinaloa 
and Durango (Staude & Barton, 2001; Figure 3). Laramide mineralization is 
generally related to calc-alkaline magmatism where emplacement was 
typically in deep plutonic environments. 
 
The exploration focus within the La Noria lease was to discover similar 
Laramide aged 'porphyry' style copper (±molybdenum) mineralization as well 
as Au-Ag vein mineralization, even though the plutonic rocks that host 
mineralization do not exhibit typical  porphyritic textures, as they are 
equigranular granodiorites and monzonites. However, hydrothermal alteration 
and mineralization that is found on the La Noria concession is similar to 
alteration and mineralization commonly associated with porphyry copper 
(±molybdenum) deposits. In addition, narrow (less than five metres wide) 
porphyrytic monzonite dykes were observed in drilling on the Azulitas 
prospect.  
 

8 Mineralization 
 
The Azulitas prospect hosts breccia / fracture hosted mineralized zones 
contained entirely within the granodiorite; the latter contains minor semi-
porphyrytic monzonite phases. Drilling and outcrop information suggests the 
presence of  a mineralized body approximately 300 metres in length. A review 
of drill core reveals that chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite, minor 
bornite, minor sphalerite and galena mineralization is hosted within variably 
fractured granodiorite and monzonite. Locally, fracture intensity increases to 
form minor clast-supported breccias. Within drill core, there appears to be a 
direct relationship between fracture intensity and hydrothermal alteration and 
mineralization.  
 
Chalcopyrite is the most abundant economically significant sulphide mineral 
within the Azulitas area. An early phase of chalcopyrite deposition appears to 
be associated with a zoned hydrothermal alteration assemblage. Central to this 
assemblage is a biotite + magnetite ± K-feldspar ± quartz ± chalcopyrite 
(potassic) alteration. Biotite is progressively replaced by chlorite ± actinolite; 
in more distal zones biotite is completely replaced by chlorite (propylitic 
zone). 
 
Early potassic alteration is overprinted by sericite-chlorite-quartz (intermediate 
argillic) to sericite-quartz-pyrite (phyllic) alteration assemblages (Figure 7).

Tourmaline rosettes occur within and adjacent to quartz veins and brecciated 
clasts and are typically associated with the youngest fractures.  
 
Phyllic alteration appears to be the latest alteration phase overprinting all 
earlier alteration assemblages; locally it progresses to more argillic (clay) 
alteration. Typically, copper mineralization is less pronounced in more 
intensely silica-sericite-pyrite altered zones at Azulitas.  
 
Molybdenum, second in importance to copper mineralization, shows no direct 
relationship to chalcopyrite mineralization. It occurs as coarse infill within 
brecciated and highly fractured portions of the mineralized system (Figure 7). 
However, it is more commonly located within intensely sericite + chlorite 
altered highly fractured (and locally sheared) rocks. Molybdenite typically 
contains slickenlines within these zones, indicating that some movement or 
slip has occurred (Figure 7).

9 Exploration 
 

9.1 Historical Exploration work 
 
Very limited information is available about the historical exploration work 
performed in the area. There are records indicating that Guggenheim 
Consortium drilled nine diamond drill holes at the Azulitas prospect in 1965. 
 

9.2 Exploration work by Kennecott & Geoinformatics 
 
The details of the regional exploration work completed by Kennecott during 
2004 and 2005 were presented in a technical report prepared by SRK in April 
2006 (Ham, 2006). Only the relevant sections relating to the Azulitas area are 
presented below. 
 
In May 2004, Kennecott acquired the La Noria exploration lease and began 
negotiations with local land owners. Preliminary exploration work on the La 
Noria concession began in June 2004 and focussed on a five square kilometre 
area; work included soil, rock and channel sampling as well as field mapping. 
A helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey was undertaken also in 2004. Several 
anomalous areas were identified, resulting in the selection of four target areas. 
Twelve core boreholes totalling 2,444 metres were drilled on the property 
during 2005 by Kennecott, including six on the Azulitas target. Four of those 
six holes returned encouraging assay results.  
 
Geoinformatics began exploration in March 2006 with additional soil and rock 
sampling, ground geophysical surveying and geological mapping followed by 
diamond drilling. Twenty-five core boreholes were drilled in 2006 between 
various prospects on the property. Drilling at Azulitas in particular confirmed 
the lateral continuity of the copper-molybdenum sulphide mineralization to a 
sufficient spacing to support an initial resource evaluation.

10 Drilling 
 

10.1 Historical Drilling 
 
Only one drilling campaign was undertaken prior to the 2005 drilling program. 
This campaign was undertaken by the Guggenheim Consortium in 1965 where 
nine diamond drill holes targeted the Azulitas prospect. The salient assay 
results from these borecoles include 1.1 percent copper and 0.06 percent 
molybdenum over twenty-seven metres, 1.48 percent copper and 0.08 percent 
molybdenum over thirty-five metres, and 0.25 percent copper and 0.24 percent 
molybdenum over twenty-three metres. These results cannot be validated and, 
therefore, the reader is cautioned that these results should not be relied upon. 
The core from these boreholes is not available.  
 

10.2 Drilling by Kennecott 
 
During 2005, Kennecott drilled twelve core boreholes (HQ calibre for 2,444 
metres). Drilling was contracted to Layne de Mexico S.A de C.V from 
Hermosillo, Sonora, México. The drilling strategy was to trace outcropping 
sulphide mineralization and soil geochemical anomalies to bedrock and test 
depth extension. Six of these holes were drilled into the Azulitas prospect on 
three north-south sections spaced by about 150 metres. 
 
Kennecott personnel used extensive, documented procedures during drilling. 
The collar position of each borehole was laid out with a hand-held GPS unit. 
Azimuth and inclination were determined with a compass. Each collar was 
subsequently surveyed using hand held GPS unit. The casing was pulled after 
drilling. Downhole deviation was monitored in eight of the twelve holes with 
an Accushot photographic device on irregular intervals. 
 
The position for half the boreholes was verified by SRK in 2006 and was in 
good agreement (within 5-7 metres). 
 
Four boreholes drilled at Azulitas yielded encouraging assay results. Three of 
these holes (DDLN05-02, DDLN05-03 and DDLN05-06) yielded strong 
copper-molybdenum sulphide mineralization across significant core length 
intervals. The salient assay results obtained from this drilling were presented in 
Ham (2006) only the assay results relevant for Azulitas are reproduced in 
Table 3. 
 
The copper-molybdenum sulphide mineralization occurs in zones logged as 
breccia. A more detailed description of the Kennecott drill program is included 
in Ham (2006).

10.3 Drilling by Geoinformatics 
 
Following the transfer of the property in early 2006, Geoinformatics completed 
eleven HQ calibre core boreholes (2,039 metres) focussing primarily on 
Azulitas prospect and immediate surrounding areas. Drilling was contracted to 
Godbe Drilling LLC of Montrose, CO, operating in Mexico under 
Perforaciones Godbe de Mexico S.A. de C.V. . 
 
Geoinformatics used the same field and drilling procedures used by Kennecott. 
Downhole deviation was monitored using a Reflex EZ-Shot tool on regular 
fifty metre intervals.  
 
In 2007 seventeen core boreholes totalling 3941 metres were drilled on the La 
Noria project, targeting the Azulitas, La Verde, the Amarillito, Copales, Los 
Laureles, and the El Naranjo prospects. Of those holes, three core boreholes 
totalling 645 metres targeted the Azulitas prospect. 
 
In addition to seven boreholes totalling 1795.5 metres drilled by Kennecott, 
Geoinformatics drilled a total of fourteen boreholes totalling 2,683.5 metres on 
the Azulitas target. Ten boreholes (1,788 metres) were drilled to infill the 
delineation of the Azulitas copper-molybdenum deposit between the boreholes 
drilled by Kennecott. Four other boreholes tested other targets to the south. 
The Azulitas deposit has been delineated on six north-south sections spaced by 
between fifty to 150 metres, over a strike length of 500 metres. The drilling 
data is summarized in Table 4.

11 Sampling Approach and 
Methodology  
 

11.1 Historical Samples 
 
There are no records describing the sampling method and approach used by 
Guggenheim Consortium in 1965. 
 

11.2 Sampling by Kennecott 
 
Rock, float and soil sampling procedures used by Kennecott were documented 
in a previous technical report (Ham, 2006). Assaying results from this 
sampling were not considered for resource estimation. 
 
In 2006, SRK reviewed the sampling approach and methodology used by 
Kennecott (Ham, 2006). The following paragraphs are summarized from that 
report. 
 
Drill core was placed in core trays and was properly labelled with its 
respective hole number, box number and drilling length interval. Core was 
photographed, logged and sampled under the supervision of qualified 
Kennecott geologists. Core recovery was logged and was generally good 
(better than ninety percent) except in extremely fractured near-surface rock or 
wider fault structures.  
 
Core assay samples were collected from half core, split lengthwise with a 
hydraulic splitter. The procedures indicate that the splitter was cleaned 
regularly to avoid potential cross-sample contamination  
 
Sample intervals vary between two and four metres in length, taking into 
account geological, alteration and mineralization boundaries. Sampling 
intervals were marked by a geologist and core was typically sampled 
continuously between sampling marks. 
 

11.3 Sampling by Geoinformatics 
 
Geoinformatics is using the same sampling practices used by Kennecott.  
 
All drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the Geoinformatics core 
facility at El Placer where core was organized, labelled, photographed, logged 
and sampled under the supervision of qualified Geoinformatics geologists.

Core assay samples were collected from half core cut lengthwise with a 
diamond saw. Depending on visual estimation of sulphide mineralization 
sampling intervals varied between two and three metres. Visibly non-
mineralized intervals were also sampled for consistency. 
 
The samples were temporarily stored in sealed sacks closed with tamperproof 
cable-ties awaiting shipping. The samples were transported to the ALS 
Chemex Preparation Laboratory in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico for crushing 
and pulverization. Pulverized samples were then shipped to ALS Chemex 
Assay Laboratory in North Vancouver, Canada for assaying.

12 Sample Preparation, Analyses and 
Security 
 

12.1 Historical Samples 
 
There are no records of the sample preparation, analyses and security 
procedures used prior to Kennecott. None of these samples were considered 
for resource estimation. 
 

12.2 Kennecott Samples 
 
Kennecott sampling was conducted using documented procedures describing 
all aspects of the field sampling and sample description process, handling of 
samples, and preparation for dispatch to the assay laboratory. 
 
All assay samples from soil, rock chips, channel samples, drill, and stream 
sediments samples were organized into batches of samples and prepared for 
submission to the assay laboratory. There is no clear documentation of the 
security measures taken to ensure chain of custody of all samples submitted for 
assaying. The procedures outlined by Kennecott staff during the 2006 site visit 
were found to meet generally accepted industry practices. 
 
Core samples were labelled, double bagged, sealed with  plastic cable ties and 
then trucked to Mazatlan by Kennecott personnel. From Mazatlan, samples 
were couriered to the Kennecott office in Hermosillo where batches of samples 
were organized and then sent to the ALS-Chemex preparation laboratory 
located in Hermosillo. Pulverized samples were then shipped to the ALS-
Chemex laboratory in North Vancouver, British Columbia for assaying. The 
ALS Chemex Vancouver laboratory is accredited to ISO 17025 by the 
Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures, 
including fire assay for gold with atomic absorption and gravimetric finish, 
multi-element inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy 
("ICP-AES") and atomic absorption assays for silver, copper, lead and zinc. 
ALS-Chemex laboratories also participate in a number of international 
proficiency tests, such as those managed by CANMET and Geostats. 
At ALS Chemex, core samples were prepared using industry standard 
preparation procedures. After reception, samples were organized into batches 
and weighed (method code LOG-22). Samples were then crushed to ninety 
percent passing -10 mesh screen (CRU-32). A sub-sample of 1,000 grams was 
prepared using a riffle slipper (SPL-21) and pulverized to eighty-five percent 
passing -75 micron (PUL-32).   
 
One hundred grams of each pulverized sample were shipped directly to the 
ALS-Chemex laboratory located in Vancouver, British Columbia for assaying

using two separate analytical procedures. Gold was assayed using a standard 
fire assay procedure and atomic absorption finish (method code: Au-AA23) on 
a thirty gram charges. A suite of twenty-seven elements was assayed by four-
acid digestion and ICP-AES on a 0.5 gram sub sample (method code: ME-
ICP61). Elements exceeding concentration limits of ICP-AES were re-assayed 
by single element aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry 
(method code element-AA46). 
 
For the drilling samples, Kennecott used comprehensive quality control 
samples with all samples submitted for assaying. Each batch of twenty core 
samples submitted for assaying contained one sample blank, one of three 
project specific standards, a field duplicate and a coarse crushed duplicate. All 
quality control samples were inserted blindly into the sample stream to the 
assay laboratory except for the coarsely crushed sample duplicates, which were 
inserted by the preparation laboratory. 
 

12.3 Geoinformatics Samples 
 
Geoinformatics informed SRK that they are following the sampling procedures 
developed by Kennecott. 
 
All core samples collected by Geoinformatics were submitted to ALS-Chemex 
laboratory in Hermosillo for preparation using the same sample preparation 
procedures. Pulverized samples were then submitted to ALS-Chemex 
laboratory in North-Vancouver for assaying. Geoinformatics used the sample 
preparation and assaying protocols and quality control measures developed by 
Kennecott. Gold was assayed by fire assay with an atomic absorption finish 
(Au-AA23) on thirty gram sub-samples. A suite of thirty-three elements 
(including copper and silver) was analyzed by four-acid digestion and ICP-
AES (method code ME-ICP61) on 0.5 gram sub-samples. Elements exceeding 
concentration limits of ICP-AES were re-assayed by single element aqua regia 
digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (method code element-AA46). 
 

12.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
 
Quality control measures are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and 
trustworthiness of exploration data. These measures include written field 
procedures and independent verifications of aspects such as drilling, surveying, 
sampling and assaying, data management and database integrity. Appropriate 
documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality 
control data are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for 
the quality assurance program implemented during exploration. 
 
Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory 
control measures implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the 
sampling, preparation and assaying. They are also important to prevent sample 
mix-up and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination of samples. 
Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate assays and

insertion of quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying 
results throughout the sampling and assaying process. Check assaying is 
typically performed as an additional reliability test of assaying results. It 
typically involves re-assaying a set number of sample rejects and pulps at a 
secondary umpire laboratory. 
 
SRK cannot comment on the quality control measures used prior to the work 
completed by Kennecott in 2005. 
 
The exploration work conducted by Kennecott was carried out using a quality 
assurance and quality control program exceeding industry best practices as 
reviewed by SRK in 2006 (see Ham, 2006). 
 
For drilling, Kennecott implemented comprehensive external analytical quality 
control measures. Control samples were inserted in all batches of twenty core 
samples submitted for preparation and assaying at a rate of one blank, one 
project specific standard and one field duplicate. For visibly higher grade 
intervals a blank and a project specific standard was inserted at a rate of one in 
every ten samples. Kennecott also relied on the internal control measures 
implemented by the primary laboratory. 
 
A post mineralization tertiary ignimbrite from the La Noria property was used 
as a suitable abrasive material for blank samples. 
 
Kennecott used four distinct, internally prepared sample control types with 
variable matrix and copper grade characteristics (Table 5): two sample types 
(KOX-1 and KOX-2) from an undetermined oxidized source and two sulphide 
sample types (KS-1 and KS-2) from pulverized sulphide mineralization from 
El Pulpo. The accepted values for these standards were obtained by several 
round robin tests undertaken by Kennecott. The KS-2 control sample type was 
inserted as the twentieth standard in every batch where sulphide was observed. 
The KS-1 control sample type was inserted into batches that intersected low 
sulphide zones.

Geoinformatics implement the same quality control procedures developed by 
Kennecott. Control samples were inserted in all batches of twenty core 
samples submitted for preparation and assaying at a rate of one blank, one 
project specific standard and one duplicate. The duplicate sample was prepared 
by the preparation laboratory from coarsely crushed sample prior to 
pulverization. Geoinformatics also relied on the internal control measures 
implemented by the primary laboratory.

The sample blank was sourced from a quarry near the village of San Marco 
and consisted of visibly un-mineralized rhyolite porphyry, sized manually to 
replicate core fragments 
 
Geoinformatics chose to use commercially available certified control samples. 
Three copper-gold certified control sample types were purchased from CDN 
Resource Laboratories Ltd. Their characteristics and accepted copper and gold 
grades are presented in Table 6. All three sample types were prepared from 
quartz-sulphide matrix mineralization from the Red Chris property in British 
Columbia.

The quality control program developed by Kennecott was mature and overseen 
by appropriately qualified geologists. Geoinformatics implemented the 
Kennecott procedures. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the exploration data from the La Noria project was 
acquired by Kennecott and Geoinformatics using adequate quality control 
procedures that generally meet or exceed industry best practices for a drilling 
stage exploration property.

12.5 Specific Gravity Data 
 
In November, 2007 Geoinformatics asked ALS Chemex in North Vancouver 
to determine specific gravity for twenty-four selected core samples submitted 
for assaying. The samples ranged from barren rock to visibly high-grade 
sulphide rock from five boreholes drilled by Geoinformatics in 2006 and 2007 
(DDLN_06_01, DDLN_06_10, DDLN_07_13, DDLN_07_14 and 
DDLN_07_15). The specific gravity was measured on the core pieces using a 
water immersion technique (method code: OA-GRA08). The database contains 
forty-four determinations (Table 7).

13 Data Verification 
 

13.1 Verification by Geoinformatics 
 
Kennecott transferred to Geoinformatics the La Noria project data in electronic 
format. Geoinformatics visually verified the electronic data for consistency 
and incorporated data into its own internal project database. 
 
During drilling, Geoinformatics implemented a quality assurance program 
designed to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of exploration data 
acquired on the La Noria project. In the opinion of SRK, the field procedures 
used by Geoinformatics meet or exceed industry best practices.  
 
Sample shipments and assay deliveries were routinely monitored as produced 
by the preparation and assaying laboratories. Assay results and quality control 
data produced by Geoinformatics were inspected visually and analyzed using 
various bias and precision charts. At the end of the 2006 program, 
Geoinformatics produced a quality control report summarizing the quality 
control data (Geoinformatics, 2007). 
 

13.2 Verification by SRK 

13.2.1 Site Visit 
 
In accordance with NI43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the La Noria project on 
several occasions. 
 
SRK 2006 Site Visit 
 
SRK first visited the La Noria project in March 2006 for the preparation of an 
initial technical report (Ham, 2006), following the acquisition of the project by 
Geoinformatics. During this visit, SRK was accompanied by Jorge Lucero 
Alvarez, project geologist of Minera Kennecott (Hermosillo, Mexico), Simon 
Griffiths, project geologist for Kennecott Exploration (Tucson, USA), and 
Rene Romero, exploration geologist of Geoinformatics (Hermosillo, Mexico). 
SRK was accompanied to the site by Dr. Steve Garwin, Senior Project 
Geologist of Geoinformatics in Perth. 
 
SRK personally inspected the Azulitas site on March 15 and 16, 2006 and 
reviewed Kennecott drill core. The purpose of the field visit was to ascertain 
the geological and structural setting of the project and witness the extent of 
exploration work carried by Kennecott. SRK collected five core samples that 
were submitted to the ALS-Chemex laboratory in Vancouver for independent 
assaying, along with two certified control samples.

Such a small sample collection cannot be considered representative for 
assessing the accuracy of the assay results delivered by ALS-Chemex. The 
intended purpose was to confirm the existence of copper and molybdenum 
sulphide mineralization on the La Noria project. 
 
Assay results for certified reference materials inserted with the verification 
samples are within acceptable tolerance levels confirming that the ALS-
Chemex assaying results are reliable. 
 
The samples represent short core intervals (ten to twenty-five centimetres) and 
do not reproduce the original intervals sampled by Kennecott. Therefore, direct 
comparison of assaying results is misleading. Nonetheless, considering that the 
SRK samples were designed to sample preferentially the best visibly 
mineralized sections of the intervals, the assaying results confirm that the 
intervals samples by Kennecott carry elevated copper, molybdenum, gold, and 
silver mineralization.

samples. Gold and silver assayed by conventional fire assay with atomic absorption finish on thirty gram charges (method 
code: AA23). Copper and molybdenum assayed by near total acid digestion followed by ICP-AES on 0.5 gram charge. One 
sample exceeding ICP-AES molybdenum limits (SRK-03) was re-assayed by single element atomic absorption (AA46). 

 
 
SRK 2007 Site Visit 
 
SRK visited the La Noria project again between December 9 and 13, 2007 
while active drilling was ongoing. The purpose of the site visit was to inspect 
the exploration work carried out by Geoinformatics on the La Noria project 
with a particular emphasis on reviewing and auditing the drilling work 
completed on the Azulitas deposit. 
 
Dr. Weiershäuser from SRK was accompanied by Mr. Darren Holden 
Executive Vice President of Geoinformatics and by Rene Romero, and Mclean 
Trott supervising the ongoing exploration program. During the visit Dr. 
Weiershäuser reviewed drilling procedures, core handling, description and 
sampling procedures, data entry and data management procedures.

SRK verified the recorded position for several new borehole collars with a 
handheld GPS. Collars surveyed by SRK are in close agreement with the 
location reported for those boreholes. 
 
The core description process collects relevant descriptive information about 
lithology, structure, mineralogy, and alteration, in addition to geotechnical 
parameters such as core recovery and rock quality determinations. 
Photographic records are taken for all core recovered before sampling. These 
data are aggregated into an appropriate electronic database that populates the 
borehole database. In summary, SRK finds comfort that Geoinformatics collect 
generally reliable data. 
 

13.2.2 Verification of Kennecott and Geoinformatics Data 
 
The Kennecott data were extensively verified by SRK for the preparation of 
the initial technical report in 2006 (Ham, 2006).  
 
Quality control data produced by Kennecott were analysed by Ham (2006) 
using bias charts and precision plots. Data show that the assay results delivered 
by ALS Chemex generally are reliable. 
 
As part of this current assignment, Geoinformatics made available to SRK the 
complete exploration data accumulated on the La Noria project in electronic 
format. SRK conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability 
of the electronic data provided by Geoinformatics. In the opinion of SRK, the 
electronic data are reliable, appropriately documented and exhaustive. 
 
Separately, Geoinformatics also made available to SRK internal and external 
analytical quality control data produced by Kennecott and Geoinformatics 
accompanied with a quality control report documenting the analysis of the 
quality control data for the 2005 and 2006 program (Geoinformatics, 2006). 
The analytical quality control data produced from 2005 to early 2008 is 
summarized in Table 9. Data cover all exploration work completed by 
Kennecott and Geoinformatics from 2005. The exploration work is ongoing.

SRK visually examined the analytical quality control data for consistency. 
SRK aggregated the assay results for the external quality control samples and 
the coarse reject duplicate and pulp replicate assay pairs. Bias charts and 
relative precision plots were constructed by SRK for copper, molybdenum and 
silver assay pairs. The charts are presented in Appendix B. In general, the 
quality control data examined by SRK suggest that copper, molybdenum and 
silver values can be reasonably reproduced from coarse reject duplicate and 
pulp replicate assays suggesting that the assay results reported by ALS-
Chemex are generally reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

14 Adjacent Properties 
 
In addition to the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit, the La Noria project 
comprises several other polymetallic occurrences of interest. There has been 
insufficient exploration work on any of these targets to warrant estimating 
mineral resources. Noteworthy occurrences include:  
 

• Northern Azulitas – high copper-gold-molybdenum values in soil; 
• Las Minas – high gold-copper values in soil; 
• Cerro Colorado – Mapped fault breccias with low copper-gold values; 
• La Verde – Mapped fractured zone with outcropping malachite and 

high copper values in rock chips; 
• El Naranjo – high tenor copper-gold-molybdenum-silver anomaly; 
• El Zapote (east) – high tenor lead-zinc-silver anomaly; 
• Los Laureles – high tenor copper-gold-silver-molybdenum anomaly; 
• East Copales – high tenor copper-gold-silver anomaly; 
• Amarillito – high tenor copper-gold-silver anomaly; 
• Deep IP target – untested geophysical target. 

 
Exploration work is ongoing on several of these targets.

16 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 

16.1 Introduction 
 
The mineral resource model presented herein represents the first resource 
evaluation for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit. This initial mineral resource 
model was prepared to provide an initial assessment of copper and 
molybdenum zones delineated by drilling on this project and to provide 
Geoinformatics management an independent assessment to justify additional 
exploration and development work. 
 
The resource estimate was completed by Ebi Ghayem, P.Geo an independent 
qualified person as this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101. The 
effective date of this resource estimate is February 12, 2008.  
 
This section describes the work undertaken by SRK and key assumptions and 
parameters used to prepare the initial mineral resource model for the Azulitas 
deposit together with appropriate commentary regarding the merits and 
possible limitations of such assumptions. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource 
classification reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global 
copper, molybdenum, gold and silver mineral resources found in the Azulitas 
deposit at the current level of sampling. The mineral resources presented 
herein are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' 
National Instrument 43-101 and have been estimated in conformity with 
generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral 
reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into 
mineral reserve. Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an 
economic evaluation as part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility 
study of a mineral project. Accordingly, at the present level of development 
there are no mineral reserves on the Azulitas project. 
 
The database used to estimate the Azulitas mineral resources was audited by 
SRK and the sulphide mineralization boundaries were modelled by SRK using 
a geological interpretation prepared by Geoinformatics personnel.  
 
Geological and mineralization wireframes and resource estimation were 
completed using Datamine Studio.

16.2 Resource Database  
 
The Azulitas project exploration database comprises descriptive and assaying 
information for a total of twenty-one boreholes totalling 4,478 metres (Table 
10). This database was initially assembled by Kennecott and subsequently by 
Geoinformatics. It was provided to SRK in an electronic format. Eleven 
boreholes were drilled outside the deposit area and were not considered for 
resource estimation. The resource estimation database is a sub-set of the main 
database and includes information for a total of ten boreholes (1,059 metres). 
 

Table 10. Database Used for Resource Estimation. 

Year Company BoreholeType
Number of 
boreholes Length

2005 Kennecott DDH 6 1,795.5
2006-07 Geoinformatics DDH 15 2,683.5

Total  21 4,478.0
 
The database contains 1,910 samples that were assayed for gold (gpt), copper 
(gpt), silver (gpt), and molybdenum (gpt). A total of 625 samples from ten 
boreholes are located within the mineralized shells. Assay results from 
boreholes drilled outside the modelled wireframes were not considered for 
resource estimation. The borehole spacing is approximately twenty to seventy 
metres.  
 
All location data in the entire database are reported using the local UTM grid 
NAD 27 datum, Zone 13 for Mexico.  
 
The database was audited by SRK. The data were checked and revised to 
remove overlapping intervals. SRK replaced assay results below the detection 
limit to half the detection limit. Detection limits were 0.005 gpt for gold, 0.5 
gpt for silver and 1 gpt for molybdenum. 
 
Core recovery data for the 2005 drilling program by Kennecott were reviewed 
and found to be acceptable, except for short intervals intersecting strongly 
fractured rocks or faults. In general, core recovery is greater than ninety 
percent. The core recovery data for the 2006 drilling program are also good, 
averaging ninety-one percent for the intervals drilled within the resource area. 
Less than four percent of the drilled intervals exhibit core recovery of less than 
fifty percent, and less than twelve percent of the samples have recovery values 
of less than eighty percent. SRK is of the opinion that the quality of the core 
recovered from drilling at Azulitas is appropriate for this stage of resource 
estimation. 
 
Topography used for resource estimation was provided by Geoinformatics. 
The topography data are based on twenty-five metre topography lines. The 
topography surface was adjusted to take into account surveyed collar locations.

The specific gravity database contains forty-four measurements performed by 
ALS Chemex using a water immersion technique (using wax coating) on core 
samples from five boreholes drilled by Geoinformatics in 2006 and 2007 (see 
Table 7). Two of these boreholes are inside the resource wireframes. The 
specific gravity data is summarized in Table 11.

outlier.

Inside 1000 PPM Shell 15 2.61 3.03 2.809 0.018 0.136

 
After analysis, an average density factor of 2.81 was used to convert volumes 
into tonnage. 
 
A review of lithological coding suggests minor inconsistencies in the rock type 
coding between Kennecott and Geoinformatics drilling. The lithological and 
structure tables should be audited to fix this problem. 
 

16.3 Solid Body Modelling 
 
Analysis of assaying data suggest that there is a meaningful statistical 
difference in the grade characteristics of the two predominant lithologies (IFD 
and ZOX), that contain the bulk of the copper and molybdenum sulphide 
mineralization relative to surrounding rock types. On this basis, for resource 
estimation each lithology was modelled separately. In constructing the 
geological wireframes the following assumptions were considered:  
 

• The lithology database contains information for several distinct 
lithologies. However, there are not enough data available for 
modelling with confidence the geology of all rock units. Only the 
prevalent lithologies were modelled: granodiorite (IFD) and brecciated 
granodiorite (ZOX); 

• 0.1 percent copper cut-off was used for defining the boundaries of the 
geological domain; 

• In the eastern part of the deposit a higher grade zone (ZOX) was 
modeled separately (see Figure 1); 

• The eastern boundary of the deposit is terminated against a poorly 
constrained fault zone. Its exact position and relationship with the 
sulphide mineralization is not fully understood. Two boreholes 
(DDLN-06-06 and DDLN-05-07) drilled east of that fault intersected 
low sulphide grades, whereas boreholes located in the west of the fault 
intersected high-grade sulphides (DDLN-06-03, DDLN-05-04, and 
DDLN-05-06). The mineralization wireframe was extended to a 
vertical north-trending plane located in the mid distance between the 
two sections. The easting of the plane is 381960.

At depth, towards the east, the sulphide mineralization appears to taper to forty 
metres in width. In this area, copper and molybdenum grades are higher. With 
the current level of understanding, it is interpreted that this zone represents a 
feeder structure to the sulphide mineralization.  
 
From the drilling data, two contiguous mineralization wireframes were 
modelled: the IDF wireframe in the western part of the Azulitas breccia and 
the ZOF wireframe adjacent to the fault (Figure 8). Solid volumes for each 
zone are summarized in Table 12.

IFD 1 1,434,057 
ZOX 2 1,095,764 
Total 2,529,821 
 

16.4 Evaluation of Extreme Assay Values 
 
In order to assess grade capping, probability plots were generated for assays 
falling within each of the geological domains.  
 
After reviewing the probability plots for each metal in each zone (appendix A), 
copper and silver grades in ZOX zone do not require capping. The capping 
levels and the impact of capping on the metal content in each zone are 
presented in Table 13. 
 

Table 13. Capping Levels for Cu, Ag, and Mo at IFD and ZOX 
Zones. 

 IFD ZOX 
Metal Cap grade Lost metal (%) Cap grade Lost metal (%)
Cu (%) 3.0 6.2 - -
Ag (gpt) 65.0 2.8 - -
Mo (%) 0.5 4.8 0.7 3.3
 

16.5 Compositing 
 
The seven boreholes drilled by Geoinformatics on the IFD zone were sampled 
along intervals varying between 1.3 and 3.0 metres. The average sample length 
is 2.02 metres. Kennecott boreholes investigated the ZOX zone and assay 
samples were collected at intervals varying between 0.5 and 4.4 metres in 
length. The average sample length is 1.43 metres. Assay samples for the IFD 
and ZOX zones were composited over 2.0 and 1.5 meter lengths, respectively. 
The composite lengths were adjusted to avoid short composites at the end of 
the drillholes in each geological domain.

16.6 Composite Statistics 
 
Statistics for capped composites were generated for each of the zone solids and 
for each of the elements (Figure 9). The results indicate a low coefficient of 
variation for each domain and for each element. Composites populations are 
not strongly skewed. Composites contained within the IFD and ZOX solids 
indicate differences between copper and molybdenum grades. The ZOX zone 
is characterized by a higher copper grade  while the IFD zone has an 
appreciably higher mean molybdenum grade.

zones. 
 

16.7 Resource Estimation Methodology 
 
A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the Azulitas 
deposit. The specifications of the block model (size, origin and extent) are 
presented in Table 14. The block model is aligned along the local UTM grid. 
 
The model block grade attributes include gold, silver, copper and molybdenum 
and copper-equivalent. Additional block attributes include resource zone, 
distance to nearest sample, ID2 variance, and dynamic anisotropy number. The 
zones classification attribute include "1" for IFD and "2" for ZOX.

For estimation, kriging was considered but because of a lack of sufficient close 
range sampling it proved extremely difficult to model spatial continuity of 
copper for each geological domain. Metal grades, therefore, were estimated 
using an inverse distance squared algorithm ("ID2"). The grade interpolation 
was constrained within each of the sulphide zone solid shells considering a 
hard boundary between the two domains.  
 
Datamine Studio uses a dynamic search volume routine in which the search 
radii are automatically increased by defined factors. By increasing the dynamic 
search volume, the distance of the samples to the center of the blocks 
increases; therefore, the uncertainty of the block estimates can be assessed by 
coding blocks with the different search volumes. Estimation parameters used 
for the estimation for each zone are summarized in Table 15.

16.8 Mineral Resource Classification 
 
Mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted 
CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" 
Guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. 
 
SRK is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues that could 
potentially affect this estimate of mineral resources. The mineral resources 
may be affected by subsequent assessments of mining, environmental, 
processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic and other factors. There is 
insufficient information at this early stage of study to assess the extent to 
which the resources will be affected by these factors, which are more 
appropriately assessed in a conceptual study.  
 
Mineral resources for the Azulitas copper-molybdenum project have been 
classified according to the "CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves" (December, 2005). The mineral resources have been 
classified by Ebi Ghayem, P.Geo, an independent Qualified Person as defined 
by National Instrument 43-101. 
 
All mineral resources for the Azulitas deposit are classified as Inferred Mineral 
Resources on the basis of the limited drilling information presently available. 
SRK is of the opinion that the current drilling data are sufficient to 
demonstrate sufficient geological continuity to support resource estimation. 
However, the level of confidence in the geological interpretation is not 
sufficient to allow application of technical and economical parameters to 
support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
For this reason, SRK considers that an Inferred classification is appropriate at 
this stage in the exploration of this deposit.   
 

16.9 Model Verification and Reviews 
 
The following model verification was carried out: 
 

• Detailed visual inspection of the block model and domain codes with 
emphasis on domain boundaries; 

• Estimated block grades were compared on sections with assay data. 
Not surprisingly, some degree of smoothing is evident in estimated 
block grades but overall the block grades correlate well with sample 
grades; 

• Comparison of the ID2 estimates with nearest neighbour estimator and 
declustered composite grades (see Table 16) suggest reasonable 
comparison.

16.10  Mineral Resource Statement 
 
The mineral resources for the Azulitas polymetallic deposit are reported at a 
copper equivalent grade because four metals are of economic significance. The 
copper equivalent grade is derived using the following formulae for which the 
metal prices and metallurgical recovery assumptions are presented in Table 17 
 
CuEq  =  Cu*RecCu + (Au*PAu *RecAu+ Mo*PMo **RecMo + Ag*PAg*RecAg   )/PCu**RecCu 
 
Where metals price (P) and metallurgical recovery (Rec) values are described 
in Table 17.

The mineral resources are sensitive to the selection of the cut-off grade. The 
global block model quantity and grade estimates at various copper-equivalent 
cut-off grades are presented in Table 18. The reader is cautioned that these 
figures should not be misconstrued as a mineral resource. The reported 
quantities and grades are only presented to show that the Azulitas polymetallic 
sulphide mineralization is sensitive to the selection of a cut-off grade. A grade

SRK considers that the mineral resources are appropriately stated at a cut-off 
grade of 0.3 gpt copper equivalent on the basis that the sulphide mineralization 
is located right at the surface and is amenable to open pit mining.

reflect the relative accuracy of the mineral resource estimate. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do 
not have demonstrated economic viability. Copper equivalent grade estimated based on 85 percent recovery for 
copper and molybdenum and 75 percent recovery for gold and silver; US$1.50 per pound of copper, US$10.00 per 
pond of molybdenum oxide, US$550 per ounce gold and US$8 per ounce silver.

17 Other Relevant Data 
 
SRk is unaware of any other relevant data pertaining to the Azulitas 
polymetallic sulphide deposit. 
 

18 Interpretation and Conclusion 
 
SRK reviewed and audited the exploration data available for the Azulitas 
copper-molybdenum project. This review suggests that the exploration data 
accumulated by Kennecott and Geoinformatics are generally reliable for the 
purpose of this stage of resource estimation. 
 
SRK was inspired by a geological interpretation provided by Geoinformatics 
personnel to construct geological and sulphide mineralization wireframes 
using Datamine. Two separate sulphide mineralization wireframes were 
interpreted and modelled using copper cut-offs determined to visually 
distinguish, with confidence, barren rock from two intensities of sulphide 
mineralization. 
 
SRK constructed and validated an initial mineral resource block model for 
Azulitas copper-Molybdenum deposit, constraining grade interpolation to 
within the two sulphide mineralization domains.  
 
Mineral resources for the Azulitas copper-molybdenum deposit have been 
estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" Guidelines. There is 
insufficient information at this early stage of study to assess the extent to 
which the mineral resources will be affected by environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant factors.  
 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource 
classification reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global 
copper, molybdenum, gold and silver mineral resources found in the Azulitas 
polymetallic sulphide deposit. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and 
do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or 
any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.

19 Recommendations 
 
The results of the work to date on the Azulitas deposit are of sufficient merit to 
recommend additional drilling. Infill drilling is required to improve the 
confidence in the interpretation of the sulphide mineralization boundaries and 
the interpretation of the geology of the Azulitas deposit. The fault bounding 
the breccia system to the east is poorly defined. The additional drilling should 
also aim at testing that fault to determine its position with greater accuracy and 
evaluate its relationship with the breccia system. SRK is confident that the 
additional infill drilling will greatly improve geostatistical analysis and 
variography, and allow upgrading the classification of the mineral resources 
from Inferred to Indicated. 
 
SRK considers that approximately 6,000 metres of core drilling will allow 
reducing the drill spacing to approximately fifty to seventy-five metres and 
complete the delineation of the lateral and depth extensions of the deposit. 
  
On the technical side, SRK notes that the control samples used by 
Geoinformatics are not certified for molybdenum. Certified molybdenum 
control samples should be used in future drilling programs. Geoinformatics 
should continue to acquire specific gravity data for all rock types irrespective 
of their sulphide mineralization. 
 
The current topographic data is not suitable to accurately characterize the 
variation of topography over the project area. SRK therefore recommends 
acquisition of a more accurate digital terrain model for the Azulitas area 
encompassing the deposit itself but also the surrounding areas where potential 
mine infrastructure could be located. 
 
Additional studies are required to complete the characterization of the context 
of the Azulitas polymetallic sulphide deposit in preparation for future 
conceptual engineering studies. The following studies can be completed 
concurrently to the recommended drilling program: 
 

• Baseline environmental studies including water quality monitoring, 
wildlife habitats and other studies for which long-term and seasonal 
data are required at the permitting stage; 

• ABA testing and geochemical characterization of sulphide and barren 
rocks; 

• Bench scale metallurgical studies including petrography, grinding and 
milling testing and metallurgy; 

• Review of geotechnical data including recommendations for 
improving field geotechnical data collection and consideration for 
specific geotechnical drilling. 

 
At the conclusion of the recommended drilling program the geological model 
for the Azulitas deposit should be revised. All rock types and structures should 
be modelled. The geostatistical analysis and variography will need to be

revised. The additional sampling data should allow using a more robust 
estimator (e.g. kriging) resulting in a more robust resource estimate. 
 
The total costs for the recommended work program are estimated at 
approximately US$2.8 million and include ten percent contingency and five 
percent administration charges (Table 20). 
 
The recommended exploration program for the Azulitas does not include other 
exploration work Geoinformatics contemplates for other targets within the La 
Noria project. Geoinformatics' strategy is to explore the other parts of the La 
Noria project (e.g. the Los Laurales prospect) in tandem with the objective to 
find a cluster of nearby deposits rather than focussing solely on the Azulitas 
deposit. SRK support this strategy.
