CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

This Technical Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. 
Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and the equivalent 
under Canadian securities laws), that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created 
by such sections. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements 
regarding the Company's expectation of the Greens Creek Mine and its expansions, including 
estimated capital requirements, expected production, cash costs and rates of return; mineral 
reserve and mineral resource estimates; estimates of silver, lead and zinc grades; and other 
statements that are not historical facts.  We have tried to identify these forward-looking 
statements by using words such as "may," "might", "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," 
"could," "intend," "plan," "estimate" and similar expressions.  

Forward-looking statements address activities, events or developments that Hecla Mining 
Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future and are based on information 
currently available. All forward-looking statements in this Technical Report are necessarily 
based on opinions and estimates made as of the date such statements are made and are 
subject to important risk factors and uncertainties, many of which cannot be controlled or 
predicted. Material assumptions regarding forward-looking statements are discussed in this 
Technical Report, where applicable. In addition to, and subject to, such specific assumptions 
discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Technical Report, the forward-looking statements 
in are subject to the following assumptions: (1) there being no signification disruptions 
affecting the operation of the Greens Creek Mine; (2) the availability of certain consumables 
and services and other key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (3) 
labour and materials costs increasing on a basis consistent with current expectations; (4) that 
all environmental approvals, required permits, licenses and authorizations will continue to be 
held on the same or similar terms and obtained from the relevant governments and other 
relevant stakeholders within the expected timelines; (5) certain tax rates; (6) the timelines for 
exploration activities; and (7) assumptions made in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates, including geological interpretation grade, recovery rates, metal price assumptions, 
and operational costs; and general business and economic conditions. Although Hecla 
management believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give 
no assurance that these expectations will prove correct.  

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include, among others, risks that Hecla's exploration and property 
advancement efforts will not be successful; risks relating to fluctuations in the price of silver, 
lead and zinc; the inherently hazardous nature of mining-related activities; uncertainties 
concerning Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates; uncertainties relating to 
obtaining approvals and permits from governmental regulatory authorities; and availability and 
timing of capital for financing exploration and development activities, including uncertainty of 
being able to raise capital on favorable terms or at all; as well as those factors discussed in 
Hecla's filings with the SEC, including Hecla's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and its other 
SEC filings (and Canadian filings) including, without limitation, its latest Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q. Hecla does not intend to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether 
as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under 
applicable securities laws.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS TO INVESTORS ON MINERAL RESERVES 
AND MINERAL RESOURCES  

Reporting requirements in the U.S. for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the 
SEC and included in the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 7, entitled "Description of 
Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations" (Guide 7). 
Although the SEC has recently issued new rules rescinding Guide 7, the new rules are not 
binding until January 1, 2021, and at this time the Hecla still reports in the U.S. in accordance 
with Guide 7. However, Hecla is also a "reporting issuer" under Canadian securities laws, 
which require estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves to be prepared in 
accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). NI 43-101 requires all 
disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and mineral reserves to be disclosed in 
accordance with its requirements. As a result, information in this Technical Report concerning 
the properties and operations of Hecla has been prepared in accordance with Canadian 
standards under applicable Canadian securities laws and may not be comparable to similar 
information for U.S. companies. 

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties under Guide 
7 and the requirements in Canada under NI 43-101 standards are substantially different. This 
Technical Report contains a summary of certain estimates of the Company, not only of proven 
and probable mineral reserves within the meaning of Guide 7, but also of mineral resource 
and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101. Under Guide 
7, the term "mineral reserve" means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically 
and legally extracted or produced at the time of the mineral reserve determination. The term 
"economically", as used in the definition of mineral reserve, means that profitable extraction 
or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable 
under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term "legally", as used in the 
definition of mineral reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing 
have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a 
mineral reserve to exist, Hecla must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws 
and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining 
and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a 
timeframe consistent with Hecla's current mine plans. The terms "measured mineral 
resources", "indicated mineral resources," and "inferred mineral resources" are Canadian 
mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These terms are not defined under 
Guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed 
with the SEC in the United States, except where required to be disclosed by foreign law. The 
term "mineral resource" does not equate to the term "mineral reserve". Under Guide 7, the 
material described herein as "indicated mineral resources" and "measured mineral resources" 
would be characterized as "mineralized material" and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage 
and grade only, not ounces. The category of "inferred mineral resources" is not recognized by 
Guide 7. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in 
such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable mineral reserves. "Mineral 
Resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as 
to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a 
"mineral resource" will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically 
extracted. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a "mineral resource" 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

exists or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are also especially cautioned that the 
mere fact that such mineral resources may be referred to in ounces of silver and/or gold, rather 
than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver and/or gold estimated per ton, is not an 
indication that such material will ever result in mined mineral reserve which is processed into 
commercial silver or gold.

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 1  

1.0 SUMMARY 

Hecla Mining Company (Hecla, or the Company) has prepared an updated Technical 
Report (TR, or the Report) in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-
101) of the Canadian Securities Administrators on the Greens Creek polymetallic 
mining operation (the Project) located on Admiralty Island in southeast Alaska, 
United States.  In a news release dated February 14, 2019, Hecla reported a new 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve estimate, effective December 31, 2018 for 
the Greens Creek Mine. The updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
represents a material increase from the previous 43-101 TR published in 2013. This 
43-101 Technical Report summarizes the scientific and technical information that 
supports the new life of mine (LOM) plan based on the December 31, 2018 Mineral 
Reserves for the mine.  Unless otherwise stated, all information in the report is 
effective as of December 31, 2018. All currencies in this document are expressed in 
U.S. dollars and all units of measurement are expressed in US imperial units unless 
otherwise noted.  

1.1 Property Description and Location 
The Greens Creek Mine is a producing 2,300 t/d underground mining operation 
located in the southeastern part of Alaska on Admiralty Island (Figure 1-1), within 
the confines of Admiralty Island National Monument (Monument).  The mine portal 
is at an elevation of 920 ft (280 m) above sea level.   

Hecla holds a 100% interest in the Greens Creek polymetallic (Au, Ag, Pb, Zn) 
mining operation through its indirectly-held subsidiaries Hecla Greens Creek Mining 
Company, Hecla Juneau Mining Company and Hecla Alaska LLC.  In this report, the 
name Hecla is used interchangeably for the parent and subsidiary companies.

1.1.1 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, and Royalties 

The land comprising the Greens Creek Mine, inclusive of all Admiralty Island 
facilities, consists of both publicly and privately-owned land. The Greens Creek 
Project includes 440 unpatented lode mining claims, 58 unpatented mill site claims, 
17 patented lode claims, one patented millsite and other fee lands, notably the Hawk 
Inlet historic cannery site. There are approximately 8,072 acres, or 3,267 hectares 
(ha), of unpatented claims and 328 acres (133 ha) of patented claims. The total land 
package encompasses 16,140 acres (6,530 hectares).   

Hecla also holds title to mineral rights on 7,301 acres (2,955 ha) of federal land 
acquired through a land exchange (the Land Exchange) with the United States 
Forestry Service (USFS). Hecla leases parcels from the United States on both the 
Monument and non- monument lands. Hecla uses other public lands pursuant to 
special use permits issued by the USFS and leases issued by the State of Alaska. 
The land exchange confers restricted surface usage rights. 

Bristol Bay Resources holds a 2.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty based on its 
original 11.2142% interest in the Greens Creek Joint Venture. 

Per the Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995, (Public Law 104-123), properties 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 3  

in the land exchange are subject to a royalty payable to the USFS that is calculated 
on the basis of net island receipts (NIR). Net island receipts are equal to revenues 
from metals extracted from the Land Exchange properties less transportation and 
treatment charges (e.g., smelting, refining, penalties, assaying) incurred after 
loading at Admiralty Island. The Net Islands Receipt royalty is 3% if the average 
value of the mineral reserve during a year is greater than $120 per ton ($132/tonne), 
in 1994 dollars, of ore, and 0.75% if the value is $120 per ton ($132/tonne) or less. 
The benchmark of $120 per ton ($132/tonne) was adjusted annually according to 
the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Implicit Price Deflator until the year 2016, 
after which time it became a fixed rate of $161/ton. 

1.1.2 Environment, Permits, and Social Impact 

The Greens Creek Mine is currently regulated by approximately 70 separate permits 
and approvals issued by various Federal, State and Municipal agencies covering 
activities at and around the Greens Creek operation.  The operation of the mine and 
associated facilities are authorized in part under a series of leases and other land 
use authorizations from the USFS and are carried out in accordance with the 
General Plan of Operations (GPO) approved by the USFS.  Certain areas of the 
mine's operation are also subject to other Federal and State permits, and approvals 
issued by other Federal and State agencies. Hecla holds all required permits for 
mine operation.  The permits are sufficient to ensure that mining activities are 
conducted within the regulatory framework required by Alaskan State and Federal 
regulations. 

An extensive environmental monitoring system is in place and additional monitoring 
is proposed during mine closure activities.  Compliance monitoring is undertaken to 
verify that the Project operates within permit limitations thereby minimizing impact to 
the environment during operations and post closure.  Monitoring activities include: 
surface, ground, process, and drinking water monitoring; geochemical 
characterization of tailings, waste rock, and construction rock; geotechnical 
monitoring of Site 23 and the tailings disposal facility (TDF), including Ponds 7 and 
10; and biological monitoring of activities during operations and closure. 

Hecla has prepared a reclamation and closure plan to address interim, concurrent, 
final reclamation and post-mining land use of the Greens Creek Mine.  The 
reclamation and closure plan and closure cost estimates are submitted to the USFS, 
the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) and the Alaska Department of 
Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  The estimated cost of reclamation and 
closure, net of salvage, at the end of mine life, is $89.9 million. 

The mine currently holds the appropriate social licenses to operate.  Hecla has 
developed a communities' relations plan to identify and ensure an understanding of 
the needs of the surrounding communities and to determine appropriate programs 
for filling those needs.  The company monitors socio-economic trends, community 
perceptions and mining impacts.

1.2 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
The mine and concentrator are accessible via passenger ferry originating from Auke 
Bay, Juneau, to Young Bay on Admiralty Island, and then by private road. A marine 
terminal is located on the island at Hawk Inlet for supplies and concentrates load-
out. Seaplane service is available from the Juneau airport to Hawk Inlet. 

The key Project infrastructure consists of the mine, a processing plant, tailings 
impoundment area, a ship-loading facility, camp facilities and a ferry dock. 

Winters are moist, long, but only slightly cold; spring, summer, and fall are cool to 
mild. Snowfall occurs chiefly from November to March. Mining activity occurs year-
round; however, exploration activities are typically conducted over five months, 
between May to October. 

The ecology of Admiralty Island is dominated by temperate rainforest that is primarily 
made up of Sitka spruce, and western hemlock interspersed with small areas of 
muskeg. 

1.3 History 
The Greens Creek deposit was discovered by the Pan Sound Joint Venture in 
1973. The original joint venture partners included Noranda Exploration, Marietta 
Resources International, Exhalas Resources Corporation, and Texas Gas 
Exploration. In 1978, following the involvement of the Bristol Bay Native 
Corporation, the Pan Sound Joint Venture was dissolved and replaced by the 
Greens Creek Joint Venture in which Bristol Bay Resources held an interest on 
behalf of the Native Corporation. Over subsequent years, the makeup of the joint 
venture partners in the Greens Creek Joint Venture changed, such that by 2008, 
the partners comprised Hecla, Kennecott Greens Creek Mining Company, and 
Kennecott Juneau Mining Company. In 2008, Hecla bought out the two Kennecott 
interests. 

1.4 Geology and Mineralization 
The Greens Creek deposit is a volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit with a 
relatively high precious metal content compared to other deposits of its type.  The 
host rock consists predominantly of marine sedimentary and mafic to ultramafic 
volcanic and plutonic rocks, which have been subjected to multiple periods of 
deformation. These deformational episodes imposed intense tectonic fabrics and 
folds within the deposit area. 

The deposit lies at the contact between Mississippian-age mafic meta-volcanic 
footwall and a hanging wall of Triassic-age argillite and basalt.  Extensive 
hydrothermal alteration occurred within the meta-volcanic footwall prior to and during 
mineral deposition, converting the basalts to sericite-rich, phyllitic schist.  At mineral 
deposition, thick and extensive lenses of base and precious metals formed at the 
footwall-hanging wall contact. 

The mineral zones are complex and locally discontinuous because of regional 
metamorphism, folding and faulting following mineral deposition.  The 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 5  

metamorphism remobilized some of the precious metals into fold related structures 
adjacent to the main mineral body.  Strike-slip faulting cut the massive sulfide 
deposit, displacing mineral zones up to 2,750 feet horizontally and 650 feet vertically. 

The sulfide mineralization at Greens Creek is divided into two general types, 
"massive" (mineralization in which sulfides exceed 50 volume percent) and "white" 
(mineralization in which sulfides are below 50 volume percent). The two general 
types are sub-divided into three subtypes each.  The "massive" types are 
distinguished according to their texture and mineralogy while the "white" types are 
separated into baritic, carbonate and silica rich sub-types. 

Greens Creek mineralization is segregated into nine separate mineralized zones, all 
of which have declared Mineral Reserves.  From northeast to southwest these 
mineral bodies are East, West, 9A, 5250, Northwest West, Upper Plate, Southwest, 
200 South and Gallagher zones.  The boundaries between the various zones and 
mineralized areas are defined by faults, shear zones, or changes in the thickness of 
the mineralized horizon.   

Metal zonation is apparent with mineralization centers having copper and iron rich 
cores grading outwards to iron and zinc and then to zinc and lead.  The most distal 
zones are polymetallic and precious metal rich. Major sulfide minerals are pyrite, 
sphalerite, galena, and tetrahedrite/tennantite.  Electrum and ruby silver (proustite-
pyrargyrite) are common. Barite, quartz and carbonate gangue are common to the 
mineralized material. 

1.5 Exploration 
Work completed prior to Hecla's 100% interest in the project comprised surface 
reconnaissance exploration, geological and structural mapping, geochemical 
sampling, airborne, ground and down-hole geophysical surveys, surface and 
underground drilling, engineering studies and mine development. Mining operations 
ran from 1989 to 1993, when the mine was placed on care-and-maintenance due to 
low metal prices. In 1996, the mine re-opened, and has operated continuously since. 

Under Hecla's ownership, work has included geological and structural mapping 
programs, geochemical sampling, ground and down-hole geophysical surveys, 
surface and underground drilling, engineering studies and mining activities.  A 
number of prospects have been discovered during ongoing surface and 
underground exploration efforts in the Greens Creek district and provide upside 
project potential. 

1.6 Drilling 
A total of 8,041 drillholes (3,846,373 ft or 1,172,374 m) have been completed over 
the entire Project area in the period 1975 through 2018.  Of these drillholes, 418 
(510,499 ft or 155,600 m) are surface holes drilled for exploration or mineral resource 
development purposes, 5,147 (2,832,264 ft or 863,274 m) are underground mineral 
resource definition or exploration drillholes, which are typically drilled on 50 to 200 ft 
(15 to 60 m) spaced vertical sections respectively, and 2,476 (503,609 ft or 153,500 
m) are underground pre-production drillholes that are drilled on cross- and plan-
sections spaced from 20 to 50 ft (15 to 60 m).

All bedrock drilling has been completed using core methods. Surface drillholes 
collaring into unconsolidated sediments utilize reverse circulation (RC) methods 
until bedrock is encountered (typically less than 100 ft or 60 m), then completed 
using core methods. Core recovery is generally high because of the compact 
nature of the greenschist- facies metamorphic rocks. Approximately 80% of drilled 
intervals have core recovery greater than 95%.  

Drillholes are designed to intersect the mineralization as perpendicular as possible. 
Definition drilling is generally on sections spaced 50 ft apart along strike of the mineral 
zone and drilled up or down dip at 50 to 75-ft spacing.  This density of drilling normally 
converts inferred mineral resource to indicated mineral resource classification. 
Throughout the drilling programs, downhole surveys were completed using industry 
standard techniques.  

The current system of logging employed by Hecla has been used with minor 
modifications since 1987. Underground drill core is logged for recovery, rock 
quality description (RQD), lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure and fabric. 
Surface core is logged for recovery, lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure and 
fabric. 

A significant number of geotechnical and hydrological drillholes were completed 
in support of construction and operations of the Greens Creek surface facilities 
and in support of ongoing mining activity. 

1.7 Sampling and Analysis 
All drillholes are sampled on intervals ranging from 1 to 5 ft (0.3 to 1.5 m) that do 
not cross lithological boundaries. Historically definition and exploration samples 
were cut in half by rock saw as indicated on the core by the logging geologist.  
Beginning in 2018 definition drill samples were taken on whole core similar to pre-
production samples. 

Procedure for measuring SG of core at Greens Creek relies on the weight in water 
versus weight in air method.  The weighing takes place after the core has been 
logged, before the core is cut, and occurs in the underground core cutting facility.  
Exploration and definition core holes are considered for density sampling. 

Many laboratories have been used historically. From 1987 to 2015, samples were 
sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd in Vancouver. Acme was ISO 9001 certified 
in 1997 and successfully maintained that certification until its acquisition by Bureau 
Veritas in 2015, samples are now sent to Bureau Veritas (BV). 

The current preparation procedure consists of crushing to 70% passing 10 mesh (2 
mm), riffle splitting approximately 250 g, then ring pulverizing to 95% passing 150 
mesh (106 microns).  Additional cleaning of the preparation equipment is requested 
after high base metal content samples. Of the pulverized material 115 to 120 g is 
sent for analysis, and the remaining 115 to 120 g were stored as a master pulp.  

Currently, all mineralized definition and exploration drill core is assayed at BV for Au, 
Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ba.  Silver and base metal assays for Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe 
are performed using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) on 
1.0 g samples digested in hot aqua regia.  Silver is re-assayed by fire-assay with 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 7  

gravimetric finish if the initial ICP-ES results are greater than 300 ppm and by 
metallic-screen fire assay if the original over-limit assay is greater than 80 oz/ton. 

The standard assay package employed consists of fire assay for Au on a 30 g 
sample with an AA finish.  Gold is re-assayed by gravimetric finish if the initial fire 
assay results return values above 7 ppm. A metallic-screen fire assay is performed 
on all samples with the original over-limit assay greater than 7 ppm. 

Hecla conducts industry standard QA/QC on all samples used in mineral resource 
estimation. Historic sample data was reviewed for QA/QC and is considered 
acceptable for use in mineral resource estimation. Currently, QA/QC on drill samples 
is reviewed quarterly by the QP and any necessary re-assaying is completed. 

1.8 Data Verification 
Regular data verification programs have been undertaken by third-party consultants 
from 1995 to 2013. Currently, the acQuire® database is managed and verified 
regularly by Hecla staff.  The QP considers that as a result of the audit findings as 
well as current data verification efforts, the database quality is acceptable for Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, and mine planning. 

1.9 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Metallurgical testing programs are continually conducted to evaluate possible 
changes in feed types from new mining areas, proposed changes in processing to 
improve recoveries and/or concentrate grades and to investigate factors causing 
lower than desired recoveries and concentrate grades. The Mineral Reserve 
estimate takes the most current recovery information into account.  Industry-
standard studies were performed as part of process development and initial Greens 
Creek mill design. Subsequent production experience and focused investigations, 
as well as marketing requirements, have guided mill expansions and process 
changes. 

1.10 Mineral Resource Estimate  
Greens Creek develops cross-sections, long-sections and level plans showing 
drillhole intercepts of the massive sulfide zones.  Geologists interpret the mineralized 
envelope using a combination of: 1) geologic criteria such as the mine contact and 
ore-type logging; 2) metal grades or NSR-values; and 3) metal zoning.  

Advanced modeling techniques employing Leapfrog Geo software were used for the 
first time in 2018. These techniques take advantage of the software's organic and 
realistic wireframe-creation process, as well as consideration of all face sampling 
data gathered during the mining process and the complete drillhole database. 
Datamine software was used for block model creation and kriging, and new semi-
variograms were created for each remodeled zone. During 2018, seven zones were 
remodeled: East, West, 9A, 200S, Southwest Bench, Gallagher and Upper Plate. 
Mineralized zone block models were created using 5 ft x 5 ft x 5 ft blocks based on 
block centroids lying within the wireframe. 

Wireframes are created based on $50NSR composite intervals, and within these a 
higher-grade $140NSR composite wireframe was created. Greens Creek considers 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 8  

$50NSR to represent the mineralized horizon. Wireframes were extrapolated 
approximately 100 ft beyond composite intervals where not constrained by 
unmineralized drillholes. Face sample data, which convey geology, bedding 
orientations and metal grade data, was also honored when creating the wireframes. 

Block models are created for stope design based on the minimum selective mining 
unit (SMU) of 10 ft x 10 ft x 15 ft (3 m x 3 m x 4.6 m) in x, y and z axes, respectively.  
A 10 ft (3 m) model buffer is created around the core mineralized blocks to allow 
calculation of metal values and density immediately surrounding the mineralized 
wireframe.  

Block models based on wireframes only use whole blocks (5 ft x 5 ft x 5 ft or 1.5 m 
x 1.5 m x 1.5 m) which are generated when block centroids lie inside the wireframe.  
After estimation, but prior to mineral resource tabulation or stope design, blocks 
(mineralized and buffer) are regularized back to 15 ft (4.6 m) high to meet the 
minimum mining height of the SMU. 

Drillhole samples were composited to varying intervals ranging from 3 to 5 feet. 
Variograms were modelled for each metal component (gold, silver, lead, zinc). 
Ordinary kriging (OK) was used to interpolate, using dynamic anisotropy to 
determine local orientation of the search ellipse. Dynamic anisotropy allows each 
block to have a unique search direction that honors the true dip direction and true 
dip angle of the mineralized horizon.  Grade capping by zone is used to limit the 
spatial extrapolation of the occasional anomalous, but isolated, precious metal 
grades. 

Models are validated using visual inspection, a comparison of OK to nearest 
neighbor (NN) distributions, and swath plots. 

Mineral Resources are classified using the variogram ranges of the two major metals 
(silver and zinc), as well as the number of samples and number of drillholes used for 
the estimate.  Assessment of reasonable prospects of economic extraction is based 
on a consideration of metal prices, set by Hecla corporate staff; consideration of a 
minimum NSR cut-off; and mining parameters.  

1.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
Mineral Resources are classified in accordance with the 2014 CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and the 2003 CIM Best 
Practice Guidelines. The QP is of the opinion that Mineral Resources for the Project 
have been estimated using industry best practices, and conform to the requirements 
of CIM (2003, 2014). 

The Qualified Person for the Mineral Resource estimate is Paul Jensen, CPG, a 
Hecla employee. Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves.  
Hecla cautions that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves and have 
not demonstrated economic viability. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources 
are reported in Table 1-1.  Inferred Mineral Resources are summarized in Table 1-2.

1.12 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
Mineral Reserves have been estimated from the geological mineral resource block 
model, which is developed by the geology department and updated regularly to 
incorporate new information. The following criteria were used to convert Mineral 
Resources to Mineral Reserves: 

• Only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are considered; 
• Dilution is included in the Mineral Reserve estimate; 
• Mineral Reserves are supported by an economic mine plan applying an NSR 

cut-off of $190-$200 per ton (depending on zone).  This cut-off value includes 
operating costs, allocations for sustaining capital, and royalties (where 
applicable); 

• The reference point for Mineral Reserves is the mill feed.  Metallurgical 
process losses are not considered when determining the contained metal 
within the Mineral Reserves; 

• All mineral reserves which have not yet been mined are classified as 
"probable".  The only "proven" mineral reserves are the mill stockpiles located 
on surface. 

The Greens Creek NI 43-101 Mineral Reserves Estimate was created with Deswik 
software using similar methodologies and basic assumptions as previous annual 
mineral reserve estimates.  All areas are designed for either longhole stoping (where 
the mineral zone is sufficiently vertical), drift-and-fill stoping, or overhand cut-and-fill 
stoping. Metal price assumptions used for the mineral reserve determination are 
expressed in US dollars (USD) as follows: $14.50/oz silver; $1200/oz gold; $0.90/lb 
lead; and $1.15/lb zinc.

Reconciliation results comparing produced grades to Mineral Reserve grades are 
favorable.  A substantial proportion of production in recent years has been mined 
from Inferred Mineral Resource not included in Mineral Reserve.  Approximately 
43% of mineral reserve tons mined in 2018 were produced from outside of Mineral 
Reserve. 

In the opinion of the QPs, Mineral Reserves for the Project, which have been 
estimated using core drill data, appropriately consider modifying factors, have been 
estimated using industry best practices, and conform to the CIM Definition Standards 
(2014). 

1.13 Mining Methods and Mine Plan 

1.13.1 Underground Mining Operations 

The mine is primarily accessed via the 920-level portal in the same general area as 
the mill, stockpile pad and administration building. This portal also serves as the 
primary air intake.  A second portal adjacent to the 920 Portal serves as a secondary 
escapeway and an additional air intake.  A third portal located at the 1350 elevation 
serves as the primary ventilation exhaust and an additional escapeway.  There is 
also a raisebored ventilation raise to the 1350 portal area which serves as an 
additional exhaust. 

The working areas are accessed via ramp.  Most ramps are connected with cross-
cuts at various locations, therefore most working areas have multiple options for 
equipment access in the event a particular ramp is blocked for rehab or utility work.  
Two of the ramp systems have a single route for mobile equipment access.  These 
ramps feature laddered escapeway raises to enable airflow and a secondary means 
of egress. 

Mine production and development are undertaken with modern mechanized 
trackless equipment.  Ore and waste are hauled to the surface using trucks.  Backfill 
is achieved using a combination of three methods: paste pumped from the 
underground paste plant, cemented tailings trucked and jammed and into the 
heading, and development waste placed into the area to be backfilled. In addition to 
the conventional trackless mining equipment, the Greens Creek fleet contains one 
LHD capable of semi-autonomous operation and another LHD capable of tele-
remote operation.  This equipment enables production activities to continue during 
the shift change and post-blasting periods when no personnel are allowed 
underground. 

The current production rate is 2,300 t/d of which approximately 2,000 t/d is produced 
by cut-and-fill with the remaining 300 t/d from longhole stoping.  Longhole Mineral 
Reserves are projected to be depleted approximately halfway through the remaining 
mine life, at which point the mine plan calls for 2,300 t/d of production from cut-and-
fill mining. 

Underground communications systems include a leaky-feeder radio system, mine 
phones, and an underground Wi-Fi network.  There is a stench alert system for 
emergency use.  Refuge chambers are located at strategic locations throughout the 
mine.

Ground support at Greens Creek is governed by a Ground Control Management 
Plan (GCMP).  Both the ore and waste rock can be highly corrosive to ground 
support due to the high proportion of sulfides.  Primary support consists of split sets 
and Swellex installed in conjunction with wire mesh.  Galvanized split sets are used 
for longer-term openings to reduce corrosion.  Greens Creek has also begun 
installing fully-grouted rebar bolts in life-of-mine excavations such as haulage ramps 
in order to provide permanent ground support with a very high degree of corrosion 
resistance.  Older ramp areas are in the process of being upgraded to rebar support. 

Greens Creek is considered to be a dry mine with groundwater inflows typically less 
than 50gpm.  Water is collected in centralized sumps where solids are allowed to 
settle.  The water is then pumped out of the mine to the 920 water treatment facilities 
and the solids are gobbed underground. 

High-voltage power enters the mine at 4160V and is distributed via three switchgear 
rooms and a network of mine power centers which reduce the voltage to 480V for 
use by drills, fans, pumps and other equipment.  A fourth switchgear room is 
currently under development to serve the deeper areas of the mine. 

1.13.2 Mine Plan 

The Greens Creek Mine plan was optimized in 2018 with the goal of reducing 
required development footage and achieving earlier access to higher-grade ore.  All 
planned development was redesigned and optimized, with large reductions to 
development footage including the removal of a major ramp system after it was 
determined that the targeted mineral reserve could be accessed via crosscuts 
developed from existing workings. 

The new mine plan results in a declining grade profile, with the highest-grade mineral 
reserves mined earlier in the mine life in order to optimize NPV (Table 1-4).  Previous 
mine plans had a relatively flat grade profile over the mine life, with an increase near 
the very end caused by mining of high-grade mineral reserve that was unable to be 
extracted earlier due to proximity of critical mine infrastructure (see discussion of "59 
Bypass" in Section 16.16.6). 

Table 1-4: Mine Plan – Mine Production Overview 

 
 
Due to the optimization of development designs (Figure 1-2), the new mine plan 
displays relatively consistent yearly development footage requirements over the 
mine life. Previous plans required higher rates of capital development which were 
heavily front-loaded during the first few years of the remaining mine life. 

Ore production is sourced from a number of different mineral reserve zones 
throughout every year of the mine life.  This reduces the potential for equipment 
traffic congestion or infrastructure bottlenecks in any one zone.  Tonnage from the 
200S Zone never exceeds 30% of overall production in any given year.  The 200S 
Zone is the deepest zone in the mine and limiting tonnage from this area to a

reasonable proportion of overall production is desirable to keep average haulage 
distances from increasing significantly which could require additional trucking 
capacity.

1.14 Recovery Methods 
The Greens Creek mill produces three saleable flotation concentrates and a gravity 
concentrate. A carbon concentrate is produced as part of the process but is 
discarded as part of tailings.  Concentrates are separately hauled and stored to a 
storage–loadout facility at Hawk Inlet, which is approximately eight miles (10 km) 
from the mine. At the Hawk Inlet facility concentrates are stored indoors in piles until 
being loaded periodically into ocean-going ships for transport to a variety of smelters. 
The Greens Creek LOM production plan for the mill assumes similar throughputs, 
recoveries, and concentrate grades to those achieved in recent years, based on 
projected mill feed grades provided by geology and mine staff for the life-of-mine. 

1.15 Project Infrastructure 
The Greens Creek mining operation includes a significant amount of existing 
infrastructure primarily at two locations: the 920/860 mine area and the Hawk Inlet 
camp, which are connected by an 8.5-mile-long road.  Key existing infrastructure 
includes the following: 

920/860 Mine Area: 

• Underground mine portals; 
• Administration and support buildings; 
• Mill building and associated processing facilities; 
• Mobile equipment repair shop; 
• Warehouse facilities; 
• Water collection and treatment facilities; 
• Development waste rock storage ("Site 23"). 

Hawk Inlet Area: 

• Personnel housing and dining buildings; 
• Concentrate storage and shipping facilities; 
• Materials receiving dock and warehouse; 
• Dry stack tailings disposal facility (TDF); 
• Water collection and treatment facilities (Pond 7/10 Dam System); 
• Fully-permitted discharge facilities for treated water (APDES 002). 

Other Areas: 

• High-voltage electrical intertie to the Juneau power grid via undersea cable; 
• Young Bay crew ferry terminal; 
• Over 13.5 miles of mine roads. 

The current dry stack tailings disposal facility has sufficient capacity to accommodate 
tailings to the end of the current mine life in 2030.  Early-stage engineering studies 
are underway to determine modifications to the plan of operations in order to 
accommodate additional material beyond the current Greens Creek mineral reserve 
life.

1.16 Market Studies and Contracts 
The mine has now been operational for a 30-year period, and continuously 
operational for the last 23 years, and has current contracts in place for concentrate 
sales, doré refining, concentrate transportation, metals hedging, and other goods 
and services required to operate an underground mine. 

1.17 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact 
The Greens Creek Mine is currently regulated by approximately 70 separate permits 
and approvals issued by various Federal, State and Municipal agencies. Greens 
Creek mines a mineralized body that is made up of massive sulfides in a temperate 
rainforest environment. Proper management of the waste materials from the mining 
process is of primary importance due to potential acid rock drainage (ARD) and 
metals leaching considerations. 

Further extensions to the mine life will require increased tailings storage capacity. 
While capacity remains through the end the current mine life in 2030, plans are in 
development for modifications to the tailings disposal facility (TDF) Plan of 
Operations intended to accommodate tailings beyond the current Greens Creek 
mineral reserve life.  

Final reclamation of the mine facilities will consider anticipated post-mining land uses 
associated with the Admiralty Island National Monument. The estimated cost of 
reclamation and closure, net of salvage, at the end of mine life, is $89.9 million. 

Hecla has a communities' relations plan in place to identify and ensure an 
understanding of the needs of the surrounding communities and to determine 
appropriate programs for meeting those needs. The company monitors 
socioeconomic trends, community perceptions and mining impacts. 

1.18 Costs and Economic Analysis 
Total life-of-mine (LOM) capital costs are estimated at $256.0 million in 2019 US 
dollars. Future capital costs are estimated based on expected sustaining capital 
requirements of the mine. Development costs are estimated based on past 
experience and are adjusted for any future anticipated changes in factors which 
would affect cost and amount of development. 

Total LOM operating costs are anticipated to be $1.5 billion, or $165.39/ton 
($182.32/tonne) milled. The operating costs included in the LOM are derived from 
the 2019 budget for the near-term and adjusted for factors regarding expected cost 
changes in the later years. The budget is built using various cost inputs including 
operating experience, quotes from various service providers, anticipated personnel 
changes, and changes in production. Fuel and power costs are variable by year, 
averaging about 6% and 10%, respectively, of total production costs in 2018, but 
ranged from 3 to 10% each in the last five years. Table 1-5 shows the estimated 
costs per ton and costs per ounce of silver.

To support declaration of Mineral Reserves, Hecla completed an economic analysis 
which confirmed positive economics based on the Mineral Reserves using mineral 
reserve price assumptions.  

The Project was further evaluated at a base case scenario using a 5% discount rate, 
and all costs prior to 31 December 2018 were treated as sunk costs.  The base case 
metals prices used in this evaluation were: 

• Gold: $1,303.70/oz; 
• Silver: $15.32/oz; 
• Lead: $0.91/lb; 
• Zinc: $1.30/lb. 

As of the filing date of this report, these prices represented applicable current prices. 
Operating and capital costs and cash flow resulting from this assessment are shown 
in Table 1-6. The analysis indicated positive Project economics until the end of mine 
life. The total gross revenue is $3.2 billion.  Estimated treatment and freight charges 
total $474 million (Table 1-7), and estimated production/operating costs total $1.5 
billion, resulting in a LOM net cash flow, before taxes, of $829 million.  The 5% 
discounted pre-tax net cash flow is $658.8 million; the post-tax discounted (5%) net 
cash flow is $638.3 million.  

Mining companies doing business in Alaska are primarily subject to U.S. corporate 
income tax, Alaska State income tax and Alaska Mining License tax. The State of 
Alaska levies a mining license tax on mining net income received in connection with 
mining properties and activities in Alaska, at a rate of $4,000 plus 7% over $100,000. 
The effect of this tax is approximately $27 million undiscounted and $20.5 million 
discounted at 5% over the life of the mine.  

The U.S. corporate and Alaska State income tax rates are 21% and a graduated rate 
from 0% to 9.4%, respectively, and are not included in the economic model. Income 
tax is typically not incorporated at the local level and is calculated for all the sites 
together; however, Hecla's U.S. consolidated group provides tax benefits as well as 
net operating losses that are expected to offset the project's taxable income in the 
foreseeable future.

Throughout the LOM (2019 to 2030), 9.28 million tons of mineral reserve will be 
processed at the mill.  The average LOM mill grades for zinc and lead are 7.62% 
and 2.84%, respectively, resulting in 1.25 billion pounds of recovered zinc and 
427.17 million pounds of recovered lead.  Silver production is estimated at 83.69 
million ounces and gold production is estimated at 542,400 ounces (Table 1-7).

The QP has reviewed the capital and operating cost provisions for the LOM plan that 
support the Mineral Reserves and considers it appropriate to the known 
mineralization, mining and production schedules, marketing plans, and equipment 
replacement and maintenance requirements. Appropriate provision has been made 
in the estimates for the expected mine operating usages and for closure and 
environmental considerations. Capital cost estimates include appropriate Owner, 
sustaining and contingency estimates. 
The QP has reviewed the economic analysis and confirms that the Project has 
positive economics until the end of mine life, which supports Mineral Reserve 
declaration.

1.19 Conclusions and Recommendations 
In the opinion of the QPs, the Greens Creek Mine is a long-established operation 
with a clear understanding of the mining, metallurgical, and infrastructural 
requirements to successfully extract the Greens Creek mineral deposits. Mining and 
milling operations are performing as expected, and reconciliation between mine 
production and the Mineral Resource model is acceptable. This indicates that the 
data supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates were 
appropriately collected, evaluated, and estimated.   

Aside from those risks expressly stated in this and other sections of this report, the 
QPs are not aware of any other environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or 
other factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resources, Mineral Reserves, 
or LOM plan described in this report. 

1.20 Risks 
Factors that may materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate include: 

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Changes to design parameter assumptions that pertain to stope design; 
• Changes to geotechnical, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; 
• Changes to the assumptions used to generate the NSR cut-off; 
• Changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 

mineralization zones; 
• Changes to the assumptions related to mineral tenure rights and royalty 

assumptions associated with the Land Exchange properties. 

Factors that may materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimate include: 

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Variations in short-term marketing and sales contracts; 
• Changes to the mineral resource block model; 
• Changes to the assumptions that go into defining the NSR cut-off; 
• Assumptions relating to the geotechnical and hydrological parameters used 

in mine design;  
• Metallurgical recovery factors: recoveries vary on a day to day basis 

depending on the grades and mineralization types being processed. These 
variations are expected to trend to the forecast LOM recovery value for 
monthly or longer reporting periods; 

• Variations to the permitting, operating, or social license regime. 

Additional risks which may affect the life-of-mine plan, production schedule, or 
economic results are shown in Table 1-8.

Table 1-8: Possible Risks to the Green's Creek Project 
Risk Mitigation 

Metals prices are volatile and 
inherently difficult to predict. Actual 
prices will differ to some extent from 
the forecasts used in this report. 
 
Smelter terms are volatile and may 
change substantially over time. 
 
Mining costs may be higher or lower 
than expected. 

The grade of the Greens Creek mineral deposits is not uniform and 
has distinct higher- and lower-grade areas.  This provides 
opportunities to defer the mining of lower-grade areas and prioritize 
production from higher-grade areas in the event of decreased metal 
prices or higher economic cutoff grade. 
 
Metal price assumptions used to evaluate Greens Creek mineral 
reserves and economics are conservative, utilizing a base case 
silver price significantly less than the three-year trailing average.  
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the mine plan maintains a positive 
NPV even with a 20% decrease in metal prices compared to the 
base case. 

Ground support at Greens Creek 
experiences significant sulfide 
corrosion.  Failure of ground support 
may result in temporary loss of access 
through travelways. 

Most mining areas have several access options due to the presence 
of multiple parallel ramp systems.  Greens Creek has an active and 
ongoing rebar rehab program which is upgrading existing ramps 
with LOM corrosion-resistant support.  Areas which cannot be 
rehabbed with rebar (such as raises) are closely monitored. 

Mine development may not meet 
targets due to equipment availability or 
other challenges 

Nearly 80% of mineral reserves are located in proximity to existing 
haulage ramps, requiring only a short ore-access crosscut in order 
to be brought into production. 
 
Delays in advancement of haulage ramps can be mitigated by 
bringing this near-mine mineral reserve into production, with a slight 
negative effect on grades. 

Water inflows from development of 
certain shallower mineral reserves 
(Upper East Ore) could result in: 
• Mining difficulties/reduced rates  
• Need for additional underground 

and surface water handling 
infrastructure 

• Increased closure costs 

A hydrological study is currently planned in order to define the 
nature and extent of the East Ore groundwater.  This will inform the 
plan for prevention and mitigation, including possibly a campaign of 
pre-grouting.   
 
The proportion of mineral reserve which may be affected by this 
groundwater is very small (equivalent to 2.6% of overall mineral 
reserve) 

1.21 Opportunities 
Project opportunities include: 

• Upside potential if some or all of the Inferred Mineral Resources estimated 
for the Project can be upgraded to higher confidence Mineral Resource 
categories and eventually to Mineral Reserves. Additional potential exists 
where existing Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource categories may be 
able to be upgraded to Mineral Reserves.  

• Future exploration potential which, with appropriate drilling and modelling, 
may result in additional Mineral Resources. 

• Digitization and evaluation of historic face mapping and sampling data.  A 
large amount of geological data from early in the Greens Creek Mine life 
exists only as archival hardcopy and is not included in current geological 
models. Incorporation of this data may result in better geological 
understanding and identification of opportunities for remnant mining, possibly 
leading to increased Mineral Reserves. 

• Continued metallurgical test work may show mineral treatment adjustments 
that could increase metal recoveries or create more attractive metal

March 2019 22  

concentrates to the target smelters. Improvements made in the processing 
plant could have a positive impact on costs and recovery, improving the 
mine's profitability. 

• Further development and application of automated and tele-remote 
equipment may result in additional efficiencies, particularly the ability to 
continue work between shifts while the mine is cleared for blasting. 

The QPs recommend that exploration, mining, engineering, and operations activities 
continue as planned.

4.1 Property and Title in Alaska 
Information included in the following subsections is summarized from Alaska 
Department of Natural Resources (2009), Alaska Division of Mining, Land and Water 
(2012), Bureau of Land Management (2011a, 2011b, 2012), and the Alaska 
Department of Revenue (2012). 

4.1.1 Mineral Tenure 

Mineral tenure can be held either under Alaskan State law, or under Federal permits.   

Federal Mineral Titles 

Alaska is one of the 19 US states where there are federally-administered lands that 
allow for staking of mining claims.   

There are three basic types of minerals on Federal lands: 

• Locatable (subject to the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended); 
• Leasable (subject to the various Mineral Leasing Acts); 
• Saleable (subject to mineral materials disposed of under the Materials Act of 

1947, as amended). 

The General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. §§ 22-54 and §§ 
611-615) is the major Federal law governing locatable minerals.  The General Mining 
Law allows for the enactment of State laws governing location and recording of 
mining claims and sites that are consistent with Federal law. 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the surface of public lands and 
the USFS manages the surface of National Forest System lands.  The BLM is 
responsible for the subsurface on both public lands and National Forest System 
lands.  

Mining claims may not be located on lands that have been: 

• Designated by Congress as part of the National Wilderness Preservation 
System; 

• Designated as a wild portion of a Wild and Scenic River; 
• Withdrawn by Congress for study as a Wild and Scenic River. 

Areas also withdrawn from location of mining claims include National Parks, National 
Monuments, Native American reservations, most reclamation projects, military 
reservations, scientific testing areas, most wildlife protection areas (such as Federal 
wildlife refuges), and lands withdrawn from mineral entry for other reasons. 

Claim and Entry Types 

Two main claim types can be granted, lode mining and placer mining claims.  

Federal lode mining claims are defined by the BLM as: 

Deposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having well-defined 
boundaries.  They also include other rock in- place bearing valuable minerals and 
may be broad zones of mineralized rock.  Examples include quartz or other veins 
bearing gold or other metallic minerals and large volume, but low-grade 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 31  

disseminated gold deposits.  Descriptions are by feet and bounds surveys beginning 
at the discovery point on the claim and including a reference to natural objects or 
permanent monuments.  Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1,500 feet 
in length, and a maximum width of 600 feet (300 feet on either side of the vein).  The 
end lines of the lode claim must be parallel to qualify for underground extralateral 
rights.  Extralateral rights involve the rights to minerals that extend at depth beyond 
the vertical boundaries of the claim.   

The boundaries of a claim based on staking and located after January 1, 1985, shall 
run in the four cardinal directions unless the claim is a fractional claim or the 
commissioner determines that staking in compliance with this paragraph is 
impractical because of local topography or because of the location of other claims; 
a claim established in this manner may be known as a non-MTRSC (meridian, 
township, range, section and claim) location. 

Federal placer mining claims are defined by the BLM as: 

Including all forms of deposit, excepting veins of quartz, or other rock in-place.  In 
other words, every deposit, not located with a lode claim, should be appropriated by 
a placer location.  Placer claims, where practicable, are located by legal subdivision 
(aliquot part and complete lots).  The maximum size is 20 acres per locator, and the 
maximum for an association placer is 160 acres for 8 or more locators.  The 
maximum size in Alaska is 40 acres.  The maximum size for a corporation is 20 
acres per claim.  Corporations may not locate association placers unless they are in 
association with other locators or corporations as co-locators. 

Federal lode and placer mining claims are administered by the BLM under the 1872 
General Mining Law.  After physically staking the boundaries with six posts a 
minimum of 1 m tall, new claims are filed with the local county and with the BLM.   

Maintenance requirements are based on the assessment year which begins 
September 1, at noon, and ends the following September 1, at noon.  An annual 
$140 maintenance fee per claim is required to be filed or postmarked (if mailed) on 
or before September 1 of the year preceding an assessment year.  These BLM fees 
are increased from time to time.  

Claimants who perform assessment work must spend a minimum of $100 in labor 
or improvements on each claim, and record evidence of such with the BLM by 
December 30 of the calendar year in which the assessment year ended.  
Assessment work includes, but is not limited to, drilling, excavations, driving shafts 
and tunnels, sampling (geochemical or bulk), road construction on or for the benefit 
of the mining claim; and geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys. 

In addition to these claim types, there are kinds of two mineral entry claim. 

Mill site entries are defined by the BLM as: 

A mill site must be located on non-mineral land.  Its purpose is to either (1) support 
a lode or placer mining claim operation or (2) support itself independent of any 
particular claim.  A mill site must include the erection of a mill or reduction works 
and/or may include other uses reasonably incident to the support of a mining 
operation. Descriptions of mill sites are by metes and bounds surveys or legal 
subdivision.  The maximum size of a mill site is 5 acres. 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 32  

Tunnel sites are defined by the BLM as: 

A tunnel site is where a tunnel is run to develop a vein or lode.  It may also be used 
for the discovery of unknown veins or lodes.  To stake a tunnel site, two stakes are 
placed up to 3,000 feet apart on the line of the proposed tunnel.  Recordation is the 
same as a lode claim.  An individual may locate lode claims to cover any or all blind 
(not known to exist) veins or lodes intersected by the tunnel.  The maximum distance 
these lode claims may exist is 1,500 feet on either side of the centerline of the tunnel.  
This, in essence, gives the mining claimant the right to prospect an area 3,000 feet 
wide and 3,000 feet long.  Any mining claim located for a blind lode discovered while 
driving a tunnel relates back in time to the date of the location of the tunnel site. 
Federal Lode and Placer Patented Mining Claims 

A patented claim is one for which the federal government has passed title to the 
claimant, making it private land.  A person may mine and remove minerals from a 
mining claim without a patent; however, a mineral patent gives the owner title to the 
minerals, surface and other resources (timber, vegetative).  Mineral patents can be 
issued for lode claims and placer claims. 

Patenting requires the claimant to demonstrate the existence of a valuable mineral 
deposit. In addition, the applicant needs to: 

• Survey, if required, subsequent to location; 
o Survey application requires initial fee of $750 plus $300 for each 

additional claim; 
o Approved survey plat and notice of intent to patent posted on claim. 

• File patent application in BLM State Office accompanied by fees - $250 
service charge (1 claim) and $50 for each additional claim; 

• Provide evidence of title and citizenship; 
• Provide statement of expenditures and improvements; 
• Have BLM approval notice published in newspaper; 
• Provide proofs of posting and publications, and corroborated statements. 

Under current law, if all requirements have been satisfied, the applicant can 
purchase a lode claim at $5 per acre ($12 per ha) and placer claims for $2.50 an 
acre ($6.18 per ha).  
Federal Conditions of Use 

Activities that ordinarily result in no or negligible disturbance of the public lands or 
resources are termed "casual use."  In general, the operator may engage in casual 
use activities without consulting, notifying or seeking approval from the BLM. 

For exploration activity greater than casual use and which causes surface 
disturbance of five acres (2 ha) or less of public lands; the operator must file a 
complete notice with the responsible BLM field office.  Notice is for exploration only 
and only 1,000 tons (907 tonnes) may be removed for testing.  

A Plan of Operations is required for surface disturbance greater than casual use, 
unless the activity qualifies for a Notice filing.  Surface disturbance greater than 
casual use on certain special category lands always requires the operator to file a 
Plan of Operations and receive approval from the federal agency that administers 
the land (i.e. BLM, the USFS). An applicant for a plan of operations must pay a 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 33  

processing fee, and/or for a mineral examination on a case-by-case basis.  

Anyone proposing to prospect for or mine locatable minerals that might cause 
disturbance of surface resources is required to file a "Notice of Intention to Operate" 
with the local USFS office or BLM.  If the Federal Agency determines that such 
operations will cause a significant disturbance to the environment, the operator must 
submit a proposed Plan of Operations, from which the impacts of the operations will 
be assessed.  The Plan of Operations must describe such things as the type of 
operation proposed and how it will be conducted; proposed roads or access routes 
and means of transportation; and the time period during which the proposed 
activities will take place.  The Plan of Operations must also indicate the measures 
to be taken to rehabilitate areas where mining activities have been completed.  An 
operator shall also be required to furnish a bond commensurate with the expected 
cost of rehabilitation. 

There are no fees associated with processing notices of intent or plans of operations 
needed for locatable minerals.  A bond is required for a plan of operations, in an 
amount that would be adequate to reclaim the surface resources.  In addition, the 
USFS may require an applicant to submit environmental information and may 
authorize an applicant to prepare an environmental assessment.  

State Mineral Titles 

State-owned lands cover an area larger than the entire State of California, and most 
of these lands are open to mining under a location system which is a modem version 
of the Federal mining law.   

Legislation relating to mining claims was enacted in 2000 as Senate Bill 175.  State 
mining claims in Alaska use the meridian, township, range, section and claim 
(MTRSC) format.  Two sizes of claim can be staked, quarter section (~160 acres or 
65 ha), and quarter–quarter section (~40 acres or 16 ha).  Claims require posting of 
corners, as the corner posts define the actual claim location and mineral rights 
acquired.  Typically, such locators are defined using global positioning system (GPS) 
instruments.  

Annual rental payments for a mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease are 
based on the number of years since the concession was first located.  Claims that 
were located before 31 August 1989 have that date as their commencement date 
for fee payment purposes. 

Rental payments are required as follows: 

• For all traditional mining claims and quarter–quarter section MTRSC 
locations, the annual rental amount is $35/year for the first five years, 
$70/year for the second five years and $170/year thereafter;   

• For all quarter section MTRSC locations, the annual rental amount is 
$140/year for the first five years, $280/year for the second five years and 
$680/year thereafter;   

• For all leases, the annual rent is $0.88/acre ($2.17/ha) per year for the first 
five years, $1.75/acre ($4.32/ha) for the second five years, and $4.25/acre 
($10.50/ha) per year thereafter. 

There is also a minimum labor requirement for each mining claim.  Under Alaska 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 34  

legislation, "labor" includes geological, geochemical, geophysical, and airborne 
surveys conducted by qualified experts and verified by a detailed report lodged with 
the appropriate Alaskan authorities.  Work such as drilling, excavations, driving 
shafts and tunnels, sampling (geochemical or bulk), and road construction on or for 
the benefit of the mining claim is considered "labor" under this requirement.  In 
addition to the minimum labor requirement, the following commitments are required 
for maintenance of the claims: 

• $100 per claim, leasehold location, or lease if the claim, leasehold location, 
or lease is a quarter–quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or 
lease; 

• $400 for each quarter section; 
• $100 for each partial or whole 40 acres (16 ha) of each mining claim, 

leasehold location, or lease not established using the MTRSC system. 

If more work is performed than required to meet minimum commitments, then an 
application can be made to have the excess applied against the following year, or 
for as many as four years.  There is provision for a cash payment to be made in lieu 
of work expenditure.   

At any time in the exploration or production process, a claimholder may convert the 
mining claim to a mining lease.  Mining leases have the same rental and production 
royalty rates do mineral claims, and require annual claim filing and recordation.  Each 
lease title defines specific rights of control and tenure for that lease that may 
otherwise be open to conflict with third party claimants or other multiple use users of 
the State land. A mining lease shall be for any period up to 55 years and is renewable 
if requirements for the lease remain satisfied. Minerals on State lands cannot be 
patented.  

4.1.2 Surface Rights 

Federal Lands 

Of the total area of Alaska, 60% (222 million acres or 89.8 million ha) is classed as 
Federal lands.  The USFS and BLM manage about 98 million acres (39.7 million ha) 
(20 and 78 million acres (8.1 million and 31.6 million ha) respectively) for multiple 
use purposes including timber production, fish and wildlife, recreation, water and 
mining. 

Mineral tenure holders do not have surface rights but do have the rights to concurrent 
use of land to the extent necessary for the prospecting for, extraction of, or basic 
processing of mineral deposits once necessary permits have been obtained.  
Requirements for BLM land varies from those for USFS-administered lands.  

State Lands 

When Alaska became a state in 1959, the federal government granted the new state 
28% ownership of its total area.  Approximately 103,350,000 acres (41.8 million ha) 
were selected under three types of grants: 

• Community (400,000 acres or 162,000 ha); 
• National Forest Community (400,000 acres or 162,000 ha); 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 35  

• General (102,550,000 acres or 41.5 million ha).  

Additional territorial grants, for schools, university and mental health trust lands; 
totaling 1.2 million acres (486,000 ha) were confirmed with statehood.   

Mineral tenure holders do not have surface rights but do have the rights to concurrent 
use of land to the extent necessary for the prospecting for, extraction of, or basic 
processing of mineral deposits. 

Where surface rights are held by a third-party other than the State, appropriate 
compensation must be negotiated with the owner. 

Alaska Native Claims Settlement Acts Lands 

In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANSCA). This 
law granted 44 million acres (17.8 million ha) and $1 billion to village and native 
corporations created under the act.  Generally, ANSCA gave Native selections 
priority over state land selections.  Native lands are private lands.  Thirteen regional 
corporations were created for the distribution of ANSCA land and money.  Twelve of 
those shared in selection of 16 million acres (6.5 million ha), the 13th corporation, 
based in Seattle, received a cash settlement only.  A total of 224 village corporations, 
of 25 or more residents, shared 26 million acres (10.5 million ha).  The remaining 
acres, which include historical sites and existing native-owned lands, were allocated 
to a land pool to provide land to small villages of less than 25 people.  

Agreements and compensation for land access and infrastructure construction must 
be separately negotiated with ANSCA holders. 

4.1.3 Water Rights 

The Alaska Water Use Act defines water rights as: 

A water right is a legal right to use surface or groundwater under the Alaska Water 
Use Act (AS 46.15).  A water right allows a specific amount of water from a specific 
water source to be diverted, impounded, or withdrawn for a specific use.  When a 
water right is granted, it becomes appurtenant to the land where the water is being 
used for as long as the water is used.  If the land is sold, the water right transfers 
with the land to the new owner, unless the Department of Natural Resources 
approves its separation from the land.  In Alaska, because water wherever it naturally 
occurs is a common property resource, landowners do not have automatic rights to 
groundwater or surface water. 

4.1.4 Permits and Environmental 

Permits issued by federal agencies constitute "federal actions."  Any major federal 
action requires review under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).  A 
number of agencies can be involved in the review, at both the Federal and State 
levels.  Other agencies are involved for specialist areas, such as transport of 
explosives, communication licenses, and landing strips for aircraft. 

Typically, for larger metalliferous projects in Alaska, agencies involved in the 
permitting process can include:  

• Bureau of Land Management (BLM); 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 36  

• Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); 
• United States Forest Service (USFS); 
• National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS);  
• U.S. Coast Guard;  
• U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); 
• Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); 
• Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF); 
• Federal Communications Commission (FCC); 
• U.S. Department of Homeland Security; 
• U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT); 
• Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 
• Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR); 
• Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC); 
• Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG). 

The federal agency with the predominant federal permit is usually designated the 
lead for the NEPA process.  During the permitting process, the agencies identified 
as requiring input into the process will review the proposed Project, evaluate impacts 
associated with each facet of the Project, consider alternatives, identify compliance 
conditions, and ultimately decide whether or not to issue the requested permits. 

Upon completion of the NEPA process, a Record of Decision is prepared that 
supports issuance of the permit for the preferred alternative for the Project, describes 
the conditions of the decision to issue the permit, and explains the basis for the 
decision.  The state permitting process typically is not finalized until the NEPA 
process is completed.  Each federal and state permit has compliance stipulations 
requiring review and possibly negotiation by the applicant and appropriate agency. 

Reclamation 

The US Mining Laws, specifically 43 CFR 3809 on the federal level, define the 
reclamation standards for mines operated since 1981.  An Alaskan State law 
regulates the reclamation procedures on private, state, and federal lands for mines 
operated since mid-October 1991.  The Department of Natural Resources and 
Division of Water and Mining issued the reclamation requirements.  Briefly, 
requirements are that all mined land be returned to a stable state, that post-mining 
erosion be minimized, and that the potential for natural re-vegetation be enhanced.  
Before a mining permit can be issued, the mining company must first submit a plan 
for reclamation.  

An approved reclamation plan from the appropriate Alaskan regulatory authority is 
required prior to mining operations commencement.  An individual financial 
assurance is normally required, although for certain mining operations, the State will 
allow a bonding pool.  However, a mining operation may not be allowed to participate 
in the bonding pool if the mining operation will chemically process material or has 
the potential to generate acid. 

The Alaskan Commissioner determines the amount of the financial assurance 
needed after consideration of the reasonable and probable costs of reclamation for 
that operation.  There are a number of methods of meeting the financial assurance 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 37  

requirements, including a surety bond, letter of credit, certificate of deposit, a 
corporate guarantee that meets the financial tests set in regulation by the 
commissioner, or payments and deposits into a specified trust fund.  Typically, 
companies establish a fund under the Alaskan "Trust Fund for Reclamation, Closure 
& Post-Closure Obligations", such that the amount in the fund is sufficient to 
generate adequate cash flow to cover all reclamation, closure, and post-closure 
costs.  

4.1.5 Royalties 

Applying to State lands only, there is a 3% production royalty that is calculated on 
the same net profits basis as the mining license tax. This production royalty is 
payable on all State land production and does not include the 3.5-year grace period. 
Failure to file and pay this royalty will result in loss of claims. 

No Federal taxes are currently levied; however, royalties are payable by Hecla to 
the Federal Government in certain instances (see Section 4.3). 

4.2 Project Ownership 
The Pan Sound Joint Venture, formed in 1973, consisted of joint venture partners 
Noranda Exploration (29.73%), Marietta Resources International (29.73%), Exhalas 
Resources Corporation (29.73%), and Texas Gas Exploration (10.81%).  Under the 
Pan Sound Joint Venture, the first mineral claims were staked over the Big Sore 
vegetation and geochemical anomaly. 

Bristol Bay Resources (Bristol), a company held by the Bristol Bay Native 
Corporation, joined the original partners in 1976.   

In 1978, the Pan Sound Joint Venture was dissolved, and the Greens Creek Joint 
Venture created, with the same partners holding the interests in the Greens Creek 
Joint Venture. 

Bristol sold its 11.2% interest in 1988 to Noranda and Hawk Inlet Company, with a 
half interest sold to each party.  Bristol retained a 2.5% NSR royalty on its 11.2% 
share as part of the sale.   

In 1982, Anaconda Minerals bought Marietta's interest and, in 1986, Amselco (a unit 
of BP Minerals) purchased both Anaconda's and Noranda's interests, subsequently 
selling off a portion to Hecla in 1987.   

Texas Gas changed its name to CSX Alaska Mining Company, Inc. (CSX) in 1987.  
Following the merger of British Petroleum and Sohio, Kennecott Minerals 
(Kennecott) acquired Amselco in 1987.   

The three remaining joint venture partners, Kennecott, Hecla, and CSX bought out 
Exhalas Resources Corporation in 1993.  Kennecott Minerals bought out CSX in 
1994, and CSX changed its name to Kennecott Juneau Mining Company (KJMC).  
At that time, the ownership was Kennecott Greens Creek Mining Company 
(KGCMC) with a 57.75% interest, KJMC with a 12.52% interest and Hecla with an 
interest of 29.73%. 

In 1994, the Greens Creek Joint Venture (GCJV) agreement was restated in order 
to resolve certain issues between the Joint Venture participants.   



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 38  

KGCMC operated the mine up to 2008 with Hecla maintaining its 29.73% interest.  
On April 6, 2008, Hecla Mining Company completed its transaction to acquire 
KGCMC's 57.75% and KJMC's 12.52% interests in the Joint Venture (the Kennecott 
subsidiaries which held the remaining 70.27% interest in the Greens Creek Mine).  
As a result, Hecla subsidiaries now hold 100% of the Greens Creek Joint Venture.   

The current ownership structure is illustrated in Figure 4-1. 

4.3 Mineral Tenure 
The Project core claims at Big Sore are held in the name of Hecla Greens Creek 
Mining Company, a wholly-owned Hecla subsidiary.  

Figure 4-2 is a layout plan showing the breakdown of the various land holdings in 
the greater Project area.  Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 present a summary of the Hecla 
ground holdings.  Details of the unpatented claims are included in Appendix A.  The 
holding obligations are summarized in Table 4-3. The annual maintenance fees of 
US$125 per claim required to hold the unpatented mining claims have been paid 
annually to the US Bureau of Land Management, and the required annual filing fees 
have been paid to Juneau Recording District, State of Alaska.  The claims have been 
properly maintained and are in good standing.  Hecla owns the patented mining and 
millsite claims and fee parcels, and pays the assessed property taxes, which 
payments are current as of the date of this report.

The Greens Creek property includes 440 unpatented lode mining claims, 58 
unpatented millsite claims, 17 patented lode claims, one patented millsite and other 
fee lands, notably the Hawk Inlet historic cannery site.  Hecla also holds title to 
mineral rights on 7,301 acres (2,955 ha) of Federal land acquired through a land 
exchange with the USFS.   

4.3.1 Patented and Unpatented Claims 

The patented lode claims, containing approximately 327 acres (132 ha), are located 
in Sections 4, 8, 9 and 10, Township 44 South, Range 66 East, Copper River 
Meridian, Juneau Recording District, Alaska. The 0.62-acre (0.25 ha) mill site claim 
is located in Section 1, Township 43 South, Range 65 East. 

The unpatented lode and millsite mining claims are situated in Sections 1-3, 10-15, 
and 22-27, Township 43 South, Range 65 East, and Sections 7, 17-20 and 29-33, 
Township 43 South, Range 66 East, Copper River Meridian. The unpatented lode 
and millsite claims encompass approximately 8,072acres (3,267 ha). 

4.3.2 Leasehold Lands 

Greens Creek leases parcels from the United States on both the Monument and 
non-monument lands.  It uses other public lands pursuant to special use permits 
issued by the USFS and leases issued by the State of Alaska.  Some areas within 
the Monument required for the road right-of-way, mine portal and millsite access, 
campsite, mine waste area and a tailings impoundment are governed by USFS 
leases.  Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) is the legal basis 
for these leases and others which may be required.   

4.3.3 Land Exchange Properties 

Pursuant to "The Federal Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995" (Pub. L. 104-
123 April 1, 1996), 7,301 acres (2,955 ha) of mineral lands (subsurface estate and 
certain restricted surface use rights) surrounding the core group of 17 patented 
claims were conveyed to the Greens Creek Joint Venture in exchange for $1.0 
million of private lands purchased by the Venture and a royalty on mineral production 
from the Land Exchange properties. Previously patented claims, including 
associated extralateral rights, are not subject to the royalty. The property extents are 
approximately from Section 26, Township 43 South, Range 65 East, to Section 13, 
Township 44 South, Range 66 East, Copper River Meridian. 

The Land Exchange properties conveyed are subject to: 

(i) Restrictive covenants limiting surface use; and  
(ii) A future interest held by the United States which pertains to the Land 

Exchange properties, the core claims and other Greens Creek properties.   

The future interest vests with the United States upon the earlier of:  

(i) Abandonment of the properties; 
(ii) January 1, 2045 (absent good faith mineral exploration, production or 

reclamation); or  
(iii) January 1, 2095.

4.4 Surface Rights and Property Agreements 
The land comprising the Greens Creek Mine, inclusive of all Admiralty Island 
facilities, consists of both publicly- and privately-owned land.  It owns land on 
Admiralty Island both as a result of patenting mining and millsite claims and through 
transfer of private lands in the historic cannery area from its predecessor.  

As noted in Section 4.3.2, Hecla leases parcels from the United States on both the 
Monument and non-monument lands.  Hecla uses other public lands pursuant to 
special use permits issued by the USFS and leases issued by the State of Alaska. 
Additionally, Hecla holds subsurface and restricted surface use rights under the 
Land Exchange. 

4.4.1 USFS Agreement 

Kennecott and the USFS began discussing the possibility of the existence of 
extralateral rights at Greens Creek in about 1990.  In 1994, Kennecott prepared a 
comprehensive geologic and legal analysis of extralateral rights at the Greens Creek 
Mine based upon the geologic information then available.  Based upon that analysis, 
the USFS agreed that extralateral rights exist with respect to the Big Sore claims.   

At Greens Creek, underground mining has progressed outside of the vertical 
boundaries of the mining claims under the extralateral rights.  Hecla and 
predecessor companies have also conducted underground exploration beyond the 
mining claims' vertical boundaries. 

In addition to the right to mine inherent in the Big Sore claims and the extralateral 
rights acknowledged by the USFS, Kennecott was granted mining rights pursuant to 
US Patent No. 50-98-0434 (AA-80626; the Patent) and the associated Agreement 
dated December 14, 1994 between Kennecott and the United States (the Patent 
Agreement).  Hecla is also bound by these agreements and granted rights, and each 
of these rights carries with it somewhat different mining or possessory rights.   

First, as it has done historically, Hecla can mine each and every mineral deposit 
found within the vertical boundaries of the Big Sore claims based upon the 
intraliminal rights that are inherent to every mining claim.  Second, to the extent 
extralateral rights associated with the Big Sore claims can be demonstrated to exist, 
Hecla can mine "down dip" on a vein outside of the vertical boundaries of the claims.  
As long as Hecla stays within such vertical planes, there is no limit how far down dip 
Hecla can mine.  And third, pursuant to the Patent and the Patent Agreement, Hecla 
is permitted to mine a specified area (the Agreement Area) outside of the vertical 
boundaries of the Big Sore claims even where no extralateral rights can be shown 
to exist.   

To the extent Hecla mines pursuant to its intraliminal rights, i.e., the right inherent in 
the Big Sore claims, it is not obligated to make any royalty payment to the Federal 
Government.  Likewise, to the extent Hecla mines pursuant to extralateral rights, i.e., 
down dip on a vein within vertical planes drawn through the end line of a claim that 
has extralateral rights, it is not obligated to make any royalty payment to the Federal 
Government.   

When Hecla mines a mineral deposit located outside of the Big Sore claims where 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 46  

it cannot demonstrate extralateral rights, it must mine pursuant to the Patent and the 
Patent Agreement.  The Patent and the Patent Agreement carry with them the 
obligation to pay a royalty to the Federal Government (the Federal Royalty, see 
Section 4.3).  In addition, the area that can be mined is geographically limited to the 
Agreement Area. 

From the statutory language of the General Mining Law, courts have established a 
number of requirements that must be met in order to obtain extralateral rights:   

• The deposit involved must be a "lode" or a "vein";  
• The deposit must "apex" within the claim boundaries;  
• The deposit must "dip", and not be horizontal;  
• The deposit must be "continuous"; and  
• The deposit can only be pursued beyond the vertical boundaries of the side 

lines of a claim within planes parallel to the end lines of the claim.   

These definitions of what constitute the basis for extralateral rights are being 
reviewed in relation to known mineralization, in particular the Gallagher Zone, which 
is adjacent to and appears to extend into, the Land Exchange boundaries.  Hecla is 
currently exploring the relationships of the Greens Creek mineral bodies to the 
Gallagher Zone, and evaluating the influence of a major structural boundary, the 
Gallagher Fault, on mineralization continuity.  If extralateral rights across the 
Gallagher Fault are not established, then the Gallagher Zone would be subject to a 
royalty to the US Government.   

4.5 Royalties and Encumbrances 
Bristol Resources holds a 2.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty based on 11.2142% 
of the Greens Creek Joint Venture.  This royalty is the sole responsibility of the Hecla 
Juneau Mining Company ownership interest (12.5164%; refer to Figure 4-1 for the 
ownership interest breakdown).   

The royalty was payable once a calculated "capital recovery amount" of $26.5 million 
was recouped.  The capital recovery amount is based on a percent of the capital 
investment related to the original feasibility study, the original purchase price of 
Bristol's ownership share, and interest accumulated for a four-year period.  Earnings 
applied to capital recovery were essentially calculated based on 11.2142% of net 
income before non-cash charges and income tax. The NSR value used in the Bristol 
Resources royalty is calculated as follows: 

• Net proceeds from smelter; 
• Less on-island concentrate transportation, storage, and ship loading costs;  
• Less severance taxes. 

Under the Land Exchange, production from new discoveries on the exchanged lands 
will be subject to Federal royalties included in the Land Exchange Agreement.  The 
royalty is only due on production from Mineral Reserves that are not part of Greens 
Creek's extralateral rights. Thus far, there has been no production, and no payments 
of the royalty have been triggered.  

Per the Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995, (Public Law 104-123), properties 
in the land exchange are subject to a royalty payable to the USFS that is calculated 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 47  

on the basis of net island receipts (NIR). Net island receipts are equal to revenues 
from metals extracted from the Land Exchange properties less transportation and 
treatment charges (e.g., smelting, refining, penalties, assaying) incurred after 
loading at Admiralty Island. 

The Net Islands Receipt royalty is 3% if the average value of the mineral reserve 
mined during a year is greater than $120 per ton ($132/tonne) of ore, and 0.75% if 
the value is $120 per ton ($132/tonne) or less. The benchmark of $120 per ton 
($132/tonne) was adjusted annually according to the US Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) Implicit Price Deflator until the year 2016, after which time it became a fixed 
rate of $161/ton.  

4.6 First Nations 
Hecla complies with all state and federal employment laws, which identify Native 
Alaskans as a protected minority classification. Hecla has no First Nations 
agreements in regard to Greens Creek and there are no outstanding First Nations 
claims in the project area. 

4.7 Other Considerations 
Permitting, environmental, and social considerations for the Project are discussed in 
Section 20. 

4.8 Comments on Property Description and Location 
In the opinion of the QPs, the information discussed in this section supports the 
declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, based on the following: 

• The Project is wholly-owned by an indirectly held Hecla subsidiary; 
• Information provided by Hecla land tenure experts supports that the mining 

tenure held is valid and is sufficient to support declaration of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves;  

• Hecla holds sufficient surface rights in the Project area to support the mining 
operations, including access and power line easements; 

• Royalties are payable on the Bristol and USFS Land Exchange lands; no 
royalty payment has yet been triggered on USFS lands; 

• Hecla holds the appropriate permits under local, State and Federal laws to 
allow mining operations; 

• The appropriate environmental permits have been granted for Project 
operation;  

• At the effective date of this Report, environmental liabilities are limited to 
those that would be expected to be associated with an operating base metals 
mine where production occurs from underground sources, including roads, 
site infrastructure, waste dumps and disposal facilities; 

• Hecla is not aware of any significant environmental, social or permitting 
issues that would prevent continued exploitation of the deposit;   

• To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may 
affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 
The mine site is situated partly within the Admiralty Island National Monument and 
completely within the municipal boundaries of the City and Borough of Juneau. The 
majority of the area of Admiralty Island is part of the Admiralty Island National 
Monument, which covers an area of more than 955,000 acres (3,860 km²).  The mine 
and plant site are located approximately five miles (8 km) up the Greens Creek River 
valley with the mines' camp located at Hawk Inlet (refer to Figure 4-2).   

Greens Creek employees are shuttled by ferry boat, which travels twice daily from 
Auke Bay, Juneau to Young Bay dock on Admiralty Island.  Air transport is also 
available, for hire, through Ward Air originating at the Juneau airport and landing at 
the sea plane dock at Hawk Inlet camp.  A number of helicopter services are also 
available for hire and may, with proper clearance, land at two landing pads; one at 
Hawk Inlet camp and the second at the mine site in the Greens Creek valley.   

Freight services operate via weekly scheduled barge with service originating in 
Seattle, Washington and subsequent connections to Juneau.  Once on Admiralty 
Island, buses are used to transport passengers along an improved dirt and gravel 
road from Young Bay dock to the Hawk Inlet camp or to the Greens Creek Mine.   

5.2 Climate 
Admiralty Island is a temperate rainforest featuring a cool temperate climate milder 
than its latitude may suggest, due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean.  Winters are 
moist, long but only slightly cold: temperatures drop to 20º F (−6.7º C) in January, 
and highs are frequently above freezing.  Spring, summer, and fall are cool to mild, 
with average highs peaking in July at 65º F (18.3º C).  

Annual snowfall on Admiralty Island averages 98 inches (213 cm) and occurs chiefly 
from November to March.  Precipitation occurs year-round, ranging from 55 inches 
(1,400 mm) to 90 inches (2,290 mm) annually.  The months of May and June are the 
driest while September and October are the wettest.  Admiralty Island's monthly 
temperature, precipitation and snowfall are summarized in Table 5-1. 

Surface exploration at Greens Creek operates at elevations ranging from sea level 
to 3,300 feet (1,005 m).  Weather is highly variable, ranging from sunny to week-
long periods of low clouds and fog and because of this, exploration activities are 
conducted over five months; between May to October. Mining activity occurs year-
round.

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
Juneau is the closest large city.  Operating supplies are shipped via weekly barge 
service from Juneau, AK, and Seattle, WA. Project infrastructure and the 
infrastructure layout are discussed in Section 18 of the Report. 

5.4 Physiography 
Mine facility elevations range from the concentrate shipping facility, which is at sea 
level, to the 1350-adit at an elevation of 1,350 ft (412 m) above sea level.  The mill 
and main mine portal are located at an elevation of 920 ft (280 m). 

The ecology of Admiralty Island is dominated by temperate rainforest that is primarily 
made up of Sitka spruce, and western hemlock interspersed with small areas of 
muskeg.  The timberline is typically at an elevation of 2,000 to 2,500 ft (610 m to 
762 m).  Above the timberline the forest gradually changes to alpine-tundra with rock 
outcrops and permanent and semi-permanent snow fields. 

5.5 Comments on Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, 
and Physiography 
In the opinion of the QPs: 

• There is sufficient suitable land available within the mineral tenure held by 
Hecla for tailings disposal, mine waste disposal, and installations such as the 
process plant and related mine infrastructure. All necessary infrastructure 
has been built and is sufficient for the projected LOM plan. 

• A review of the existing power and water sources, manpower availability, and 
transport options indicate that there are reasonable expectations that 
sufficient labor and infrastructure will continue to be available to support 
declaration of Mineral Resources, Mineral Reserves, and the proposed LOM 
plan.

6.0 HISTORY 

Information in this section is based on a summary prepared by West (2010) and by 
Hecla staff.  Historical and current exploration work completed from 1973 to 
February 2019 is presented in Table 6-1. The localities discussed in Table 6-1 are 
indicated in Figure 6-1. Mineralization was discovered at the "Big Sore" copper sub-
crop in 1974. Mining operations commenced in 1989 but closed in 1993 due to low 
metal prices. In 1996, the mine was re-opened, and production has continued to 
date. 

Hecla obtained a 100% interest in the Project in 2008. Mine production from 1989 to 
2012 is summarized in Table 6-2 in Imperial units and in Table 6-3 in metric units.  
An overall life-of-mine summary is included as Table 6-4. For a history of Mineral 
Reserves at Greens Creek Mine, see Section 15.

1977  22 holes totaling 8,810 ft (2,685 m) were completed at Big Sore, 
Killer Creek and Gallagher Creek.  Additional soil sampling was 
undertaken over extensions to these areas, as was a CEM survey.  
Soil surveys, CEM and magnetic geophysical surveys, and 
geologic mapping were also carried out on the Zinc Creek and 
Mariposite Ridge prospects. 

 

1978 Pan Sound Joint Venture was 
dissolved 

 Greens Creek Joint Venture formed in its place to 
accommodate the involvement of the Bristol Bay Native 
Corporation. 

1978 Greens Creek Joint Venture Exploration drift was started; a total of 24 underground drill stations 
were established, from which 50 core holes were collared.  
Environmental baseline studies commenced. 

By November 1979, 4,190 ft (1,277 m) of drift and a 219 ft (67 
m) raise had been completed. 

1980  33 core holes were completed, and an Environmental Impact 
Assessment commissioned. 

The Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act was 
passed, under which the Admiralty Island National Monument 
was created.  The Greens Creek deposit and mineral tenure, 
although within the national monument zone, were excluded 
from the wilderness classification of the remainder of the 
national monument area.  Section 504 of ANILCA allowed for 
exploration on previously located, unpatented claims that fell 
within three-quarters of a mile of Greens Creek, providing that 
exploration ceased in five years and any claims not 
"perfected" reverted to national monument status. 

1981–
1982

mined, one of which was tested by Noranda, the second by 
Anaconda. 

 

1985  10 holes totaling 12,266 ft (3,739 m) were completed from surface, 
and 47 holes and 34,749 ft (10,591 m) of drilling from 
underground. 

A 10-year lease with a drill commitment and royalty payment 
obligation on production was signed with the owners of the 
nearby Mammoth claims. 

1986 Amselco (BP) become operator by 
buying out Anaconda and Noranda. 
Amselco sells portion to Hecla (%); 
CSX acquires Texas Gas. 

Three surface holes, totaling 4,694 ft (1,431 m), and one 
underground exploration hole was drilled to 1,271 ft (387 m).  
Surface mapping and exploration at the Mammoth and Mariposite

No magnetic anomalies were delineated but six electro-
magnetic anomalies were co-incident with known soil 
geochemical anomalies in the Big Sore area.  At the end of 
the year, the Greens Creek Joint Venture lost all rights to the 
Big Sore claims except for the eight core claims and the nine 
additional perfected claims.

Two surface holes were drilled in 1989, and underground 
exploration drilling conducted.   

Mill start-up occurred in February 1989.  Surface holes tested 
for down-dip extensions of the North mineral zone.  
Underground drilling, also testing the North mineral zone, 
identified mineralization at a previously unrecognized horizon 
at a lower elevation than the North mineral zone. 

1990  10 holes totaling 23,287 ft (7.098 m) completed to validate claims 
to the west of the core claim group at Big Sore. 

Underground drilling program intersected three new mineral 
bodies: the Central West, the Northwest West, and the 
Southwest zones.  No additional surface drilling subsequently 
took place until the passage of the Land Exchange Act in 
1996. 

1990–
1993 

 Underground drilling was continued to define the West, Northwest-
West and Southwest zones. 

Negotiations began on a new land-exchange proposal 
whereby private land in-holdings on Admiralty Island and 
other areas of the Tongass National Forest would be 
conveyed to the US Forest Service in return for the 
subsurface mineral rights to 6,875 acres (2,782 ha) 
surrounding the core claims.  Greens Creek received title to

the 17 core claims and one millsite claim in 1992 after the 
USDA Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management 
approved the final validity test in December. 

1993 Exhalas share bought out by 
Kennecott/Hecla 

Underground drilling was continued to define the Southwest Ore 
Zone. 

Mine closure due to low metal prices. 

1994 CSX bought out; Greens Creek 
Joint Venture now Kennecott 
(70.27%), Hecla (29.73%) 

 The land exchange agreement was with the US Forest 
Service concluded. 

1996  Updated feasibility study.  Airborne EM, radiometric, and 
magnetometer surveys were completed during 1996–1997 to 
determine which might be more effective in surface exploration.  
Geological mapping.  Underground definition drilling in the 
Northwest West and 5250 mineral zones. Underground and 
surface gravity surveys were completed. Two test lines over the 
West and Northwest West mineral zones were surveyed by the 
controlled source audio-magnetotelluric (CSAMT) method.  A time-
domain electromagnetic (TEM) survey was completed over eight 
lines and measured a strong response from the West Ore.  Down-
hole TEM surveys were completed on surface and underground 
holes.   

The land exchange agreement approved by Congress. 
A total of 745-line miles (1,200-line kilometers) of surveys 
covered the entire Greens Creek area, including the land 
exchange parcel.  Distinct magnetic anomalies corresponded 
with already mapped ultramafic bodies.  The EM survey 
proved useful in identifying graphitic rocks, such as the Hyd 
argillite.   A completely revised 1 inch = 1,000-foot scale 
district map and numerous 1 inch = 200-foot scale mine 
geologic maps were compiled during 1996–1997, and the 
prospective mine stratigraphy was traced to the south and 
north.  Milling operations re-commence in July. 

1997  Nine holes (7,755.5 ft or 2,364 m) were completed, targeting 
extensions to known mineralization at the North Ore Zone, the 
Upper Plate Extension of the Northwest West Ore Zone, and a 
possible north extension of the West Ore.  Four diamond drillholes 
(6,316 ft or 1,925 m) were completed in 1997 at Big Sore with 
limited results. Soil sampling, gravity, magnetic and TEM 
geophysical surveying, and geologic mapping on cut grids. 

No high-priority, near-surface coincident gravity and TEM 
anomalies (possible shallow massive-sulfide bodies) were 
identified.  Soil sampling and geologic mapping outlined drill 
targets or areas for detailed follow up work in Bruin, 
Gallagher, and Lower Zinc Creek prospects.  However, 
underground drilling identified the very high-grade 200 South 
Zone. 

1998  Four holes were drilled in Bruin Creek; grid extension and 
development, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveys. 

One new grid (Upper Big Sore) and extensions of three 1997 
grids (Lower Zinc, Bruin, and "A" Road) were geochemically 
sampled and geophysically surveyed.  The work outlined 
numerous multi-element anomalies with coincident TEM 
anomalies; however, none were considered immediate drill 
targets.   

1999  Grid expansion, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveys.  
Ten diamond drillholes were completed (12,715 ft or 3,875 m), 
seven at Bruin Creek and three at Killer Creek. 

Grid expansion continued at Killer Creek, Upper Zinc Creek 
and Cub prospects.  Numerous high-rank, multi-element soil 
anomalies were defined, and numerous sulfide-bearing 
outcrops and gossan zones were sampled and mapped.  No 
mineralization was encountered in the Bruin Creek holes; the 
Killer Creek drilling intersected chalcopyrite and minor 
sphalerite mineralization. 

2000  CSAMT geophysical survey; drilling A CSAMT geophysical survey was completed along three 
lines in Bruin and Cub Creek prospects in 2000.  Three lines 
were also surveyed in Killer Creek area.  In conjunction with

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 
Regional geological interpretations are largely based on work completed by the 
United States Geological Survey (USGS).  USGS Professional Paper 1763 (Taylor 
and Johnson, 2010) and subsequent work by the USGS (Wilson et.al, 2015 and Karl 
and Wilson, 2016) best summarize the regional geology surrounding the Greens 
Creek deposit. 

The Greens Creek Mine lies within the Alexander Triassic Metallogenic Belt which 
lies unconformably on Late Proterozoic to Permian aged strata of the Alexander 
Terrane. The tectono-stratigraphic map of Figure 7-1 shows these units as they now 
exist against the North American continent and where other deposits similar in type 
to Greens Creek have been discovered. 

Amalgamation of the Alexander and Wrangellia terranes by Permian time resulted 
in sub-aerial exposure of the region and the formation of an erosional unconformity.  
The unconformity appears to have variably removed Devonian to Permian units from 
the Alexander terrane in the vicinity of the Greens Creek claim block. 

Post-amalgamation of the Alexander and Wrangellia terranes, late Triassic rifting 
developed a restricted basin on the east side of the composite terrane as evidenced 
by the Hyd Group marine sediments and flood basalts of Carnian and Norian ages.  
The Greens Creek deposit is hosted within the Hyde marine sediments (Tr hgs) of 
Carnian to Norian age immediately below the Hyd basalts (Tr hgv) as shown in 
Figure 7-2 (Karl and Wilson, 2016). 

Beginning in the middle Jurassic and continuing through the Mid-Cretaceous, 
compressional tectonism attended the suturing of the Alexander/Wrangellia 
superterrane to continental North America. Crustal thickening during the Mid-
Cretaceous collision resulted in intense fold and thrust style structural deformation.  
Toward the end of the Cretaceous compressional tectonism waned as tectonic 
plates along the coast of North America began to move in a dextral fashion which 
motion continues to the present. 

Brittle dextral movement in the Tertiary affected the entire accreted coast of North 
America.  The Chatham Strait Fault is one of many north-northwest striking faults of 
this brittle faulting which has caused significant strike-slip dislocation across the 
superterrane (Figures 7-1 and 7-2). Two such Tertiary faults run through the Greens 
Creek deposit.  The Maki Fault and Gallagher Fault have dextral offsets 1,800 feet 
(549 m) and 2,750 feet (838m) respectively.  The faults generally dip steeply to the 
west and have reverse movement (west side up) of 110 feet (33m) and 650 feet 
(198m) respectively. Taylor and Johnson (2010) place Greens Creek into a series 
of deposits and prospects that they term the Alexander Triassic Metallogenic Belt 
(Figure 7-1). The belt is located along the eastern margin of the Alexander terrane 
throughout southeastern Alaska and northwestern British Columbia and exhibits a 
range of characteristics consistent with a single rift basin deepening to the north. 
Occurrences included in this group include: Windy Craggy, Mt. Henry Clay, Greens 
Creek, Glacier Cree, Pyrola, and Yellow Bear Mountain among others.

7.2 Project Geology 

7.2.1 Geologic Mapping 

Extensive surface mapping on the Greens Creek claim block has allowed a detailed 
bedrock map to be produced for the project area.  USGS units were not typically 
used in mapping lithologies, but Figure 7-3 provides mapped lithologies according 
to USGS defined units.  Table 7-1 equates the surface mapping geologic units of 
Figure 7-3 to lithologies utilized in underground mapping and core drilling.

7.2.2 Lithology 

While the regionally mapped units are mostly present at the Greens Creek Mine, 
some are absent, and others have been subdivided according to mine scale 
mapping and logging of drillholes.  The Greens Creek mineralization is conformable 
to the contact between the Alexander Terrane Paleozoic rocks and the late Triassic 
Hyd Group though intensely folded, and to the bedding of the Hyd Group sediments.  
As the mineral zones are located at this unconformable contact the local lithologies 
are discussed according to footwall, mineralized horizon and hanging wall groups.  
Some dikes and sills cross-cut the Paleozoic units and in rare situations cut the 
mineral body. 

Footwall Lithologies 

The Admiralty subterrane makes up the stratigraphic footwall to the Greens Creek 
mineral deposit.  The subterrane is variable in composition and spans Ediacarian 
through Permian time.  North of the mine, but still on the claim block, Devonian aged 
metavolanics, cherts and graphitic sediments have been mapped.  East and south 
of the mine, younger Permian marine sediments have been mapped.  This apparent 
younging of the Admiralty subterrane from the northwest to the southeast may be 
explained by some combination of the erosional unconformity immediately above 
the Permian boundary, which may be an angular unconformity and tectonic 
exhumation of deeper units on the northern end of the subterrane. 

The erosional unconformity is marked by a polymictic conglomerate composed 
entirely of footwall lithologies.  This conglomerate is found extensively within the 
Alexander terrane and is common below the Hyd Group metasediments.  It is 
variably present in the mine area with thickness varying up to 10's of feet.  The 
conglomerate is hypothesized to have formed as debris flows over the basin 
bounding faults which formed the Triassic basin. 

In the immediate mine area and directly below the polymictic conglomerate, the 
footwall is composed of Mississippian aged metavolcanics (Sack, 2016).  These 
metavolanics dominate footwall lithologies within a couple miles of the mineral 
deposit though some gabbroic and graphitic sedimentary units are present.  The 
metavolanics are further distinguished into the following mine units by mine 
geologists: 

• Greenstone (GST) – a massive greenstone with pervasive foliation formed 
by chlorite and weak segregation of quartz into banding.  

• Marble (MB) – though very rare in the immediate mine area this gray, coarse-
grained dolomitic marble is present in the claim block.  

• Graphitic phyllite (SPgr) – a well foliated carbonaceous quartz mica schist. 
• Chloritic phyllite (SPc) – a well foliated and banded quartz chlorite muscovite 

schist. 
• Sericitic phyllite (SP) – a well foliated and sericitically altered unit likely 

derived from the greenstone, graphitic phyllite and chloritic phyllite units. 
• Siliceous phyllite (SPsr) – a dark grey quartz rich schist found proximal to the 

mineral bodies.  This unit is likely derived from the other phyllite units by 
hydrothermal alteration related to mineral deposit formation. 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 66  

• Altered ultramafic (AUM) – a fuchsite bearing quartz carbonate chlorite 
muscovite schist. 

• Serpentinite (SC) – massive to talc altered serpentinite likely cross-cutting 
the mafic metavolcanics but clearly metamorphosed during the Cretaceous 
collision.  This unit has not been radiometrically dated and is debated by 
some to cut the Triassic Hyd Group.  Mapping and logging of core at the mine 
indicates the unit is pre-Hyd Group. 

• Polymictic conglomerate (SPcx) – a highly strained sub-rounded to angular 
breccia/conglomerate that is found at the erosional unconformity between 
the footwall Mississippian age metavolcanics units and the overlying Hyd 
Group.  Other polymictic conglomerates appear within the Hyde Group above 
the erosional unconformity but these have zircons dominated by Triassic 
ages, not Mississippian as in the basal conglomerate (unpublished data, 
O'Sullivan, 2019). 

The relative age relationships are, from youngest to oldest, polymictic conglomerate, 
serpentinite, and all other units undifferentiated. 

Hanging Wall Lithologies 

The hanging wall of the mineral deposit, which is located immediately above the 
basal polymictic conglomerate, is entirely composed of the Hyd Group.  In the 
immediate mine area, the mine geologists break the unit into the following lithologies: 

• Massive Argillite (MA) – dolomitic argillite typically found close to the base of 
the Hyd Group.  Beds tend to be 1in to 10in (2.5-25cm) thick and have quartz-
carbonate ladder veining normal to bedding due to post-depositional folding.  
Conodont samples have provided a Carnian-Norian age of 220Ma. 

• Slatey Argillite (SA) – finely laminated siliciclastic carbonaceous argillite, 
often with thin sulfide banding.  Often grades into a phyllite were post-
depositional deformation has strained the unit. 

• Gabbroic sills (GB), basalts (BSLT) and a thin rhyolite (RHY) occur up in the 
Hyd Group section, structurally and/or stratigraphically over the mineral 
deposits.  These volcanic bodies also cross the Paleozoic footwall units but 
are not generally recognized in the immediate mine area due to intense 
alteration and deformation. 

• Relative ages of the hanging wall units from youngest to oldest are basalt, 
then argillite, rhyolite and gabbroic sills intermixed and finally massive 
argillite at the base. Some researchers put the polymictic conglomerate at 
the base of the Hyd group, but the conglomerate appears to be devoid of any 
Hyd group lithologies, at least in the immediate mine area. 

7.2.3 Structural Setting 

An early and poorly preserved S1 metamorphic segregation foliation is present in the 
footwall lithologies.  As such it is likely pre-Triassic and may have developed as a 
result of the amalgamation of Alexandria and Wrangellia in the Permian. 

Intense mountain building throughout the Cretaceous resulted in D2 thrusting and 
penetrative S2 foliation in muscovite-rich lithologies.  In the hanging wall argillite, the 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 67  

S2 foliation is less apparent though F2 folding is well preserved.  The F2 folds in the 
argillite are generally non-cylindrical, isoclinal and often recumbent.  The shallow 
dipping "benches" of mineralization developed across the mineral deposit are 
pronounced recumbent F2 folds with amplitudes up to 1,000 ft. 

Following D2, the mine area was subjected to protracted D3 transpression which 
created open to isoclinal upright folding and north-northwest striking shear zones.   

Several post-D2 ductile shears have been mapped across the claim block which are 
nearly age equivalent to the upright D3 shears and have been assigned to a D2.5 
event in the literature.  These D2.5 shears have C-S fabrics indicating top to the west-
northwest movement.  The two prominent D2.5 shears mapped in the mine area are 
the Upper Shear and the Klaus Shear.  The cross-cutting relationship between D3 
and D2.5 shears have not been observed directly though regional mapping of a D2.5 
shear appeared to fold up into a D3 shear.   

A pronounced S3 crenulation cleavage is present as thin 0.05 to 0.125 in bands 
cutting S2 foliation.  The cleavage bands are spaced 1 to 10 inches apart where 
present and are nearly axial planar to the F3 folds they helped create.  These 
cylindrical folds are generally of low amplitude, typically less than 20 feet, but can 
be more than 100 feet in amplitude, significantly deforming the deposit. 

A weak D4 folding event affected the mine area.  The folds are open and of very low 
amplitude to wavelength ratio with amplitudes rarely exceeding several feet.  These 
folds do not appreciably deform the mineralization.  Figure 7-4 illustrates the 
superposition of folding present within the mine area. 

Mid- to late-Tertiary dextral transform faulting caused brittle D5 faults such as the 
Maki Fault system, which cuts through the immediate Greens Creek Mine site area. 
The similar orientations of D3-ductile and D5-brittle structures indicate that the D3 
structural grain was utilized in D5. The Maki Fault system has approximately 1,800 ft 
(550 m) of right-lateral and 110 ft (33 m) of reverse, west side up, offset.  The other 
significant D5 fault in the mine area is the Gallagher Fault with 2,750 ft (840 m) of 
right-lateral and 650 ft (200 ft) of reverse, west side up, offset.

7.3 Geology of Mineralization 

7.3.1 Locations and Relationships 

The Greens Creek sulfide mineralization is localized on the Mississippian/Late 
Triassic contact marked by the Hyd basal conglomerate.  This erosional 
unconformity is referred to as the "mine contact" by geologists at the mine.  Though 
mineralization and significant alteration extend into the footwall mafic/ultramafic 
rocks and though some lenses of mineralization occur in the overlying argillites, the 
bulk of mineable material is located immediate to the mine contact.  

The mine contact is variably mineralized over the claim block and nearly 
continuously mineralized in the mine area.  Three main trends of mineralization have 
been traced along the mine contact with multiple centers of mineralization along 
those trends.  Though the trends are folded with the mine contact the general 
mineralization trends strike 1600 and plunge 200 to the south.  Figure 7-5 displays 
the mineralized wireframes of each mineral zone of the Greens Creek Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve with the faults that displace them.  Figure 7-6 shows 
a section through the mineralized zones with major fault offsets.

In general, the mineralized bodies are zoned over a silica flooded, pyrite-rich footwall 
phyllite (SPsr).  Semi-massive stringer mineralization is often present in the footwall 
below significant massive sulfide centers. The central mineralization immediately 
above the stringers are rich in copper, iron, arsenic and gold and called massive 
pyritic (MFP) due to the high pyrite content.  Grading immediately outward from the 
MFP zones are the base metal and silver rich mineral zones (MFB).  Massive 
carbonate-rich material (WCA) is present within the MFB and towards the MFB's 
outer margins.  More distal mineralization is characterized by quartz and barite-rich 
white mineral styles, WSI and WBA respectively (Figure 7-7).

Figure 7-7: Simplified Mineralization Cross –Section 
 (Steeves, 2018) 

 
Figure 7-8 provides a plan view of the entire mineral deposit separated according to 
the mineral types.  Clear centers of mineralization are seen with at least four major 
MFP/MFB cores along the linear mineralization trends.  The largest MFP/MFB core 
is centered on the West and Northwest-West (NWW) zones.  Two more centers are 
present in the SW and upper 200S zones.  Another core is present in the deeper, 
more southern, 200S Zone.  Finally, there appears to be two more centers of 
mineralization at the farthest southern end of the current mineral resource; one on 
the deep vertical limb below the southern 200S Zone and the other possibly 
emerging at the southern end of the Gallagher Zone.  

While minable grades exist within all the mineral types, the MFB, MFP and WBA 
types typically have the highest overall grades.  Base metals typically are lower in 
the white mineral type though some baritic material can have high sphalerite.  Baritic 
material (WBA) is particularly silver rich while the white siliceous mineral style (WSI) 
is typically of the lowest grade. 

Ore minerals are dominantly sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, electrum, and proustite-
pyrargyrite.  A weak, epigenetic, high-sulfidation event overprinted portions of the 
mineral deposit producing bornite, covellite, chalcocite and stromeyerite.  Figure 7-
9 provides relative mineral abundances for each of the mineral types.

7.3.2 Mineral Type Descriptions 

Massive Fine Pyritic Mineral Type (MFP) 

The massive fine pyritic mineral type contains at least 50% overall sulfide with pyrite 
being the more abundant than the other sulfides combined. Sphalerite and galena 
dominate the base metal sulfides though chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and tetrahedrite 
are common. Gangue consists of quartz, carbonate, barite and muscovite. 

The MFP material is finely bedded generally with the pyrite often framboidal and 
colloform. Sometimes the MFP unit displays coarser textures suggesting annealing 
during metamorphism.  Near faults the pyritic material becomes brecciated and has 
late carbonate gangue.   

Figure 7-10 provides photographs of MFP as it appears at the stope and hand 
sample scales.  Photo A from a mine heading shows the stratification between MFB 
and MFP mineral styles. Photo B displays the massive sulfide texture and fine 
segregation of minerals present in the MFP in a cut hand sample.  Photo C shows 
intense deformation and late carbonate gangue in veinlets in cut hand sample.

Massive Fine Base Metal Mineral Type (MFB) 

Massive base metal-rich mineral type has >50% sulfide with sphalerite, galena and 
tetrahedrite dominate over pyrite.  The textures are similar to MFP material but with 
more sphalerite and galena.  Figure 7-11 displays the MFB at heading and hand 
sample scales.  Photos A through D show the stratification, massive and finely 
bedded natures of the MFB material at outcrop and hand specimen scales.  Photos 
E and F show boudinage, rolled clasts and intense folding within the material at hand 
specimen scale.

Figure 7-11: Massive Base Metal-rich Mineral Type (MFB) at Greens Creek 
(Steeves, 2018) 

 

Baritic Mineral Type (WBA) 

The baritic mineral type contain less than 50% total sulfide and a lower pyrite to zinc 
and lead base metal sulfide ratio than the MFP material.  Pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 
tetrahedrite, proustite-pyrargyrite and stromeyerite are common minerals of WBA 
material.  Gangue is dominated by barite, carbonate, quartz and muscovite. Figure 
7-12 shows the baritic mineral type at outcrop and hand sample scales.  Photo A 
shows a heading in the 5250 Zone where massive baritic material is common.  The 
material is well layered and dark brown with fine banding.  The hand samples of 
photos B through E show the fine banding of sulfide and gangue and the presence 
of proustite which commonly bedecks the material.

March 2019 78  

Carbonate Mineral Type (WCA) 

The carbonate mineral types at Greens Creek contain less than 50% sulfide by 
volume and are dominated by carbonate gangue.  Pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 
tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite are the dominant sulfides while dolomite, calcite, Ba-
carbonate, biotite, barite, quartz, muscovite and graphite make up the gangue.  The 
carbonate material tends to be massive and recrystallized due to metamorphism.  
Carbonate veining is common to the unit. 

Figure 7-13 displays the textures common to the carbonate mineral type.  The photos 
show a typically gray massive rock with disrupted sulfide and carbonate lenses.  
Possibly due to repeated carbonation and brecciation the original host lithology is 
largely destroyed; only small fragments of argillite remain intact.  Possibly this unit 
was originally a carbonate-rich sediment mostly replaced by dolomitization, void 
creation, breccia collapse and re-dolomitization during the original mineralization 
event. 

Figure 7-13: White Carbonate-Rich Mineral Type (WCA) at Greens Creek 
(Steeves, 2018) 

 

Siliceous Mineral Types (WSI) 

Siliceous mineral types have less than 50% sulfide and pervasive quartz flooding.  
As with the previous mineral styles, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, 
chalcopyrite are dominant sulfides.  Muscovite, albite and carbonate are accessory 
gangue minerals accompanying the dominant quartz.

Steeves (2019) makes the important observation that the WSI material occupies 
three different stratigraphic locations and represent differing processes during 
mineralization at Greens Creek.  At the lowest stratigraphy within the fossil 
hydrothermal system there is widespread silica flooding of the footwall host rock.  
Due to the sulfide and quartz replacement of the footwall and the brecciation of the 
unit during mineralization and later metamorphism, the original host lithology is 
undiscernible except through trace element lithogeochemistry.   

The second stratigraphic level and occurrence of the WSI material is within the MFP 
mineral style as separate layers indicating episodes or growth of the early 
hydrothermal system.  The last stratigraphic, and highest level, occurrence of the 
WSI mineral type is at the mineral-argillite contact, likely representing the cap and 
coolest portion of the observable VMS system. 

Figure 7-14 illustrates the common forms of WSI material at Greens Creek.  Photo 
A shows the WSI altered contact between baritic material toward the footwall and 
argillite in the hanging wall (uppermost stratigraphic level).  Photo B shows the 
massive quartz flooding typical in the WSI sometimes mistaken for chert.  The lower 
right corner of photo C shows stringer sulfide material with quartz only gangue would 
be from second stratigraphic episode discussed above.  Photo D shows finely 
banded sulfide mineral in a quartz flooded rock; late, white quartz veining in this 
photo is from tensional cracking of the primary siliceous material during 
metamorphism.

Due to variations in mineralization, structural complexity, and spatial location, the 
Greens Creek mineralization is segregated into nine separate mineralized zones.  In 
order from easternmost and highest elevations to westernmost, the zones are: 

• East 
• West 
• 9A 
• Northwest West 
• Upper Plate 
• 5250 
• Southwest 
• 200 South 
• Gallagher 

The mineralization is stratigraphically controlled and typically found at the contact 
between the phyllites (stratigraphic footwall) and the argillites (stratigraphic hanging 
wall). Due to the intense structural deformation, mineralization may be tightly folded 
into the phyllite or argillite packages such that the original stratigraphic relationships 
are unclear. In rare cases there may be areas where the mineralized materials are 
stratigraphically above the phyllite/argillite contact but still proximal to it. 

On a gross deposit scale the mineralization trends N 30° W and plunges to the south 
at approximately 20°. The East Zone outcrops at the eastern edge of the mineral 
deposit, dips to the west, and transitions into the West Zone near a tight F2 fold 
where the mineral horizon transitions from a nearly flat orientation to a nearly vertical 
wall dipping steeply to the west. The East and West zones are bounded on the west 
by the Maki Fault system which offset the mineral horizon to the north in a dextral 
sense. The western deformation boundary of the Maki Fault tends to be a continuous 
fault splay which is called the Kahuna Fault.  The mineralization hosted inside the 
fault zone are called the 9A Zone. 

West of the Kahuna Fault, the Northwest West Zone represents the offset portion of 
the West Zone. Above and to the south of the Northwest West Zone is the main 
trend of mineralization which includes the Southwest Zone followed by the 200S 
Zone further down plunge. The 5250 Zone is the along the upper mineralized trend 
evidenced in the East Zone, just offset across the Maki-Kahuna Fault system (Figure 
7-8). 

The Gallagher Zone lies to the west of the 200 South Zone and is west of a second 
major dextral fault zone known as the Gallagher Fault.  Offset on a post-mineralized 
dike swarm, the trend of the 200S Zone into the Gallagher Fault and the similar 
structural and chemical styles between the southern 200S and Gallagher mineral 
zones all indicate that the Gallagher Zone is simply the fault offset of the 200S Zone.

7.4.2 East Zone 

The East Zone outcrops at the discovery "Big Sore" gossan and extends down-dip 
to the west until it is deformed and offset by the D2.5 Klaus Shear at depth or by the 
Maki Fault at its southern extent.  The mineralization occurs along the 
phyllite/argillite contact and varies from 1 to 30 feet (0.3-9 m) in thickness. 

At the surface the mineralization dips at 60–80° to the west with the argillite on the 
bottom or eastern side.  The dip shallows with depth to near-horizontal as a result of 
F2 folding. Where the mineral body terminates into the Maki Fault drag folding has 
rotated the mineralization nearly 900 to 850 feet along strike.  This geometry 
indicates that the entire Greens Creek deposit is on an overturned major antiform 
with stratigraphic up being down. 

Figure 7-15 shows a $140NSR mineralized envelope as created in LeapfrogTM 3D 
software.  Figure 7-16 shows a level plan of drilling and the mineral resource block 
model at the 1,110 ft elevation, which is about the middle of the zone's vertical extent 
of 750 to1,980 ft elevation.   Figure 7-17 shows the XS2600 section (located on the 
plan map) with drilling and block interpolation displayed by $NSR. 

The East Zone is not deformed as the other mineral bodies at Greens Creek with 
basically one long, steeply dipping limb folding to horizontal near its base at the 
Klaus Shear.  The Klaus Shear and related F2 fold deforms the East Zone and offsets 
it approximately 600 ft to the northwest over the top of the West Zone.  One high 
angle, ductile shear striking northwest and dipping to the west has drag folded the 
East Zone at about the 1,200 ft elevation, causing the zone to have an apparent 
repeat of mineralization (Figure 7-17). 

The mineral trends rake shallowly at approximately 250 ft from north to south across 
the steeply dipping limb of the East Zone.  These trends can then be followed across 
the Maki-Kahuna Fault system into the other mineralized bodies.

7.4.3 West Zone 

The West Zone is the down-dip extension of the East Zone below the Klaus Shear, 
and from 75 to 1100 ft in elevation. While quite variable, the overall trend strikes N 
30°W for over 2,500 ft (762 m) of strike length and 1,025 ft of vertical extent (75 to 
1,110 ft). The thickness is also highly variable from less than 10 ft (3 m) to over 300 
ft (91 m) in the central portions. 

The West Zone shows well developed zoning patterns with silver rich fringes around 
a central high iron, copper and high zinc to lead ratioed core of MFP.  Baritic material 
tend to form more commonly surrounding the core of MFP as well. 

Figure 7-18 is an illustration of the 3D model for the West Zone. Figure 7-19 is a 
level plan at 700 ft elevation showing drilling and the mineral resource block model 
by $NSR values.  Figure 7-20 is a cross- section through the West Zone as located 
on the level plan map.

7.4.4 9A Zone 

The 9A Zone is the most structurally dismembered zone at Greens Creek as it lies 
within the Maki-Kahuna Fault Zone.  The general orientation of the mineral body is 
striking to the northwest and dipping steeply to the west but many internal fault 
splays cut mineralization at differing orientations.  In plan, mineralized widths range 
between less than 5 ft (1.5 m) up to 100 ft (30 m). 

Restoration of the movement along the Maki Fault suggests that the 9A Zone 
represents the fault-bounded connection between the East and West zones to the 
south and the Northwest West Zone to the north.  As such, the mineral types within 
the 9A Zone tends to be similar to the East, West and Northwest-West zones.  MFB 
and MFP materials dominate with less carbonate, siliceous and baritic material 
intermixed.  The intense deformation within this fault zone, which appears to have 
early ductile deformation prior to the brittle faulting, has remobilized precious metals 
so that exceptionally high silver grades can be found in brittle fractures cutting S2 
foliation. 

Figure 7-21 is an illustration of the block model extents. Figure 7-22 is a cross-
section through the 9A Zone. Figure 7-23 is a level plan that shows the orientation 
of the mineralization in relation to the Maki Fault, and the trace of the mine contact.

7.4.5 Northwest West Zone 

The Northwest West Zone is an extension of the West and East zones with the 9A 
Zone tying the three together through the Maki-Kahuna Fault system. The structural 
setting is dominated by a pair of recumbent F2 folds.  The upper fold is an argillite-
cored syncline while the lower fold is a phyllite-cored anticline. Mineral types and 
mineralization are similar to what has previously been described for the West Zone, 
with MFB and MFP dominate with some WSI and WCA intermixed. 

In the Northwest Zone some mineralization is located up to 100 ft off the mine contact 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 91  

into the hanging wall argillite.  Mineral types are a mixture of mostly massive and 
white-siliceous material types with lesser carbonate, baritic material and mineralized 
argillites.  This zone is particularly rich in zinc, iron and copper with lower silver 
relative to most of the Greens Creek deposit, again because this is part of the main 
core of the deposit encompassing the lower East, West, 9A, and Northwest West 
zones. 

Figure 7-24 illustrates the Northwest West Zone mineralization envelope in 3D with 
definition drilling completed within the area.  Figure 7-25 provides a plan view of the 
drilling and mineral resource block model at the 450 ft elevation.  Figure 7-26 
displays a cross section through the middle of the Zone at XS2700.  In the cross 
section the two large F2 folds are apparent.

7.4.6 Upper Plate Zone 

The Upper Plate Zone is located at the far northern end of the Greens Creek deposit 
and above the Northwest West Zone.  It is a smaller body representing the top of the 
Northwest West Zone which was caught up in a very large F2 fold located on the 
bottom of a major D2.5 shear known locally as the Upper Shear Zone.  The recumbent 
fold has an amplitude of over 3,000 ft with an argillite core no more than 200 ft thick.  
Mineralization is found mostly on the upper and lower contacts of the fold but does 
in places cross into the argillite core. 

Ore types for this relatively thin zone are generally MFB or mineralized argillite.  The 
prevalence of MFB without the lower temperature white mineral style supports the 
deformation explanation of an exceptional shear and related fold pulling the 
Northwest West Zone to the northwest.  Two late, brittle, northwest striking faults cut 
the Upper Plate body – the Up Fault and the SW-D Fault, though offsets have 
minimal displacement. Figures 27, 28 and 29 provide a 3D view of the $140 NSR 
mineralization shell, a level plan through the 1,100 ft elevation and a cross section 
through the southeastern end of the mineral zone, respectively.

7.4.7 5250 Zone 

Immediately west of the Kahuna-Maki Fault system is a lower temperature lens of 
barite-rich mineralization which links to the north with the Northwest-West Zone 
mineral body.  This lens, known as the 5250 Zone is continuous for up to 1,200 ft 
(366 m) along a N300W trend and represents the uppermost mineralization trend at 
Greens Creek.   

The mineral types are dominated by white baritic material (WBA) with lesser massive 
mineral and minor amounts of carbonate and siliceous mineral types. The silver 
grades are typically higher than average for the Greens Creek mineral bodies while 
zinc, lead and gold are below average. The mineralized material occurs along the 
phyllite/argillite mine contact and trends approximately N 35° W. The interpretation 
shows two limbs of a fold; the western limb dips generally 30º to the west/southwest 
and the eastern limb dips more steeply at approximately 80º. 

Figure 7-30 is an illustration of the mineralized wireframe with definition drilling 
shown. Figure 7-31 is a level plan map of the drilling and mineral resource block 
model for the 5250 Zone.  Figure 7-32 shows cross-section XS2200 through the 
5250 Zone showing the block model and drill traces.

7.4.8 Southwest Zone 

The Southwest Zone is comprised of a large phyllite cored F2 anticline with a nearly 
horizontal argillite syncline (also F2) on its upper limb.  The lower limb of the anticline 
is steeply east dipping to moderately westerly dipping with increasing depth.  
Mineralization wraps around the anticline's mine contact, staying on the contact 
except at the hinge of the fold where multiple lenses of mineralization have folded 
up into the argillite above the hinge along steep parasitic folds as is commonly seen 
over large intensely folded structures.  Some late F3 folding has significantly 
deformed the mine contact and F2 argillite cored syncline.   

The Southwest Zone body continues down dip and trends directly into the 200S 
Zone, the boundary between the 200S and SW Zone being somewhat arbitrarily set 
to keep modeling calculations manageable.   



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

March 2019 99  

The high amount of deformation in the Southwest Zone has remobilized and 
enriched precious metals, especially silver.  As the zone sits atop a hydrothermal 
center and has secondary enrichment it has historically been one of the highest-
grade areas at Greens Creek.  Even after being mostly mined out this zone still 
contains the highest silver mineral resource and mineral reserve numbers for the 
mine.  Mineral types are a mixture of MFB, WSI, WCA, and MFP; indicating that the 
location is in a focused vent area. 

Figure 7-33 provides a 3D view of the Southwest Zone mineralization envelope at a 
$140 NSR cut-off. Figure 7-34 is a level plan view through the zone at the 300 ft 
elevation.  Note the north-northwest striking F3 folds on the plan map at the 19800E 
and 20200E gridlines.  Figure 7-35 displays a cross section through the middle of 
the Southwest Zone as located on the plan map.

Figure 7-35: Southwest Zone - Cross Section 2700  

 

7.4.9 200 South Zone 

The 200 South (200S) Zone is a continuation of the Southwest Zone trend and has 
been historically sub-divided into two major areas, the main 200 South and the Deep 
200 South zones.  As the division was due to naming before continuity was 
established this differentiation is not recognized in this report; rather one continuous 
200S Zone is described beginning at the arbitrary XS2200 boundary between the 
Southwest and 200S zones. 

The main 200 South Zone displays the same general anticlinal geometry as the 
Southwest Zone, with a steeply dipping eastern limb and a flat-lying western limb. 
Mineralization continues for 1,200 ft (366 m) along a strike of N 15° W.  

There appears to be at least one major F2 anticline in the core of the deposit that 
has been affected by an F3 fold with east-dipping axial plane. One major D2.5 shear 
offsets the 200S Zone at approximately the 550 ft elevation, top to the northwest.  
Mineralization is bounded on the east by a steep, brittle fault zone that offsets the 
mineral horizon several hundred feet (75 to 100 m) in a dextral sense. 

Figure 7-36 is a 3D illustration of the mineralized wireframe and definition drilling. 
Figure 7-37 is a level plan at Level 100 that shows the outline of the block model in 
relation to the mine contact, and the major drillhole orientations.  Figure 7-38 is a

to the block model.

As the 100 Level is mostly mined out, Figure 7-39 is at the -600ft elevation, which is 
in the deepest area of active mining at Greens Creek.  Figure 7-40 is a cross section 
XS000 through the Deep 200 South Zone showing the relationship of the drilling to 
the mineral resource block model. Figure 7-41 is a level plan at -800 ft elevation, 
which is below any historic or active stopes at Greens Creek.  Figure 7-42 displays 
cross section XS-1300 which reaches near the maximum southern extent of

definition drilling on the 200 South Zone (and for the entire mine).   

At the northern end of the 200 South Zone a mixed group of mineral types are 
present such as MFB, MFP, WCA and WBA which are interpreted to be localized at 
an original hydrothermal seafloor vent.  At the southern extents of the 200 South 
Zone baritic material (WBA) dominates with high silver grades.  Two to three 
benches are present with a high angle mine contact on the western side of the 
deposit which is also mineralized.   

A deeper mineralized trend is present below the benches shown in Figures 7-40 and 
7-42, at the -1,100 ft elevation.  This deeper, poorly explored trend is thought to be 
the main Greens Creek mineralization trend, and displays hotter, or more proximal, 
MFP, WSI and MFB mineral types.

7.4.10 Gallagher Zone 

The Gallagher Zone is located west of the Gallagher Fault and is the westernmost 
of the known zones of the Greens Creek Mine (refer to Figure 7-5). The overall 
Gallagher Zone strikes N70°E and dips 25° SE. 

The thickness of the mineralized horizon is highly variable. In the northwest portion 
of the zone where the horizon is sub-horizontal the true thickness ranges for less 
than 5 ft (1.5 m) up to a maximum of 15 ft (4.6 m). To the south, where the 
mineralized horizon becomes conformable to the phyllite/argillite contact the 
thicknesses typically range from 10 ft (3.0) to 20 ft (6.1 m). 

The Gallagher Zone does show some broad-scale zonation patterns with Fe-rich 
massive mineralization dominate in the lower southern sections, a middle barite-rich 
relatively metal-poor central section, and a more typical mixture of white and 
massive mineralization types in the northern sections.  As discussed in the 200 
South Zone section, the Gallagher Zone appears to be the offset extension of the 
200 South Zone across the Gallagher Fault as is evidenced by similarities in 
structural style and mineral types, and post-D4/pre-D5 late Cretaceous dike offset 
across the fault. 

Figure 7-43 displays the mineralized $140 NSR wireframe with definition drilling. 
Figure 7-44 is a level plan map at the 0 ft elevation showing the mineral resource 
block model and drilling.  Figure 7-45 shows cross section XS-250 through the

7.5 Comments on Geological Setting and Mineralization 
In the QP's opinion, the geological understanding of the settings, lithologies, 
structural and alteration controls on mineralization, and mineralization continuity and 
geometry in the defined mineral zones is sufficient to support estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves. The geological knowledge of the area is also 
considered sufficiently acceptable to reliably inform mine planning. The 
mineralization style and setting are well understood and support the declaration of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

Other prospects identified within the Project area (see Section 9.6.7) are at an earlier 
stage of exploration, and the lithology, structural, and alteration controls on 
mineralization, as well as the continuity and geometry of the mineralization, are 
currently insufficiently understood to support estimation of Mineral Resources.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Research on Greens Creek Deposit Type 
Work by Taylor and Johnson (2010) in the USGS Professional Paper 1763 indicated 
that the Greens Creek deposit displays a range of syngenetic, diagenetic, and 
epigenetic features that are typical of volcanic massive sulfide deposits (VMS), 
sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX), and Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) genetic 
models.  Based on those observations the investigators indicated that the Greens 
Creek mineral deposit was a 'hybrid' type with elements of several deposit models. 

Since that earlier work, two PhD thesis out of the Center for Ore Deposit and Earth 
Sciences at the University of Tasmania (Sack, 2009, 2016 and Steeves, 2018) have 
added significantly to the observations available for the deposit from which to 
evaluate previous interpretations.  More mapping of the mineralization, structures 
and alteration across the claim block has also added to the data from which to 
classify the deposit.   

8.2 Interpretation of the Greens Creek Depositional Setting 
Based on the most recent data, the Greens Creek deposit most fully follows that of 
a volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit (Steeves, 2018).  This classification 
puts the Greens Creek deposit more in line with the other VMS deposits of the 
Alexander Triassic Metallogenic Belt. 

8.2.1 Support for VMS Classification 

Characteristics that are displayed at Greens Creek that fit the VMS model include: 

• A zinc–lead–silver–gold–copper metal endowment similar to Kuroko-type 
VMS deposits 

• Bimodal volcanism is present in the Triassic, mineralization-age, host 
lithologies 

• A zoned alteration profile with a copper-iron-zinc core grading outward into 
baritic, precious metal rich fringes and silicified cap 

• Presence of quartz-sericite-sulfide stringers in the footwall directly below the 
massive sulfide accumulations; and massive chloritic alteration around the 
stringers. 

• Mineralogy similar to that of white smoker systems of the southwestern 
Pacific Ocean.  Baritic and carbonate mineral styles with framboidal and 
colloform pyrite indicate seafloor primary deposition. 

• The Greens Creek mineral deposits are within a well-established 
metallogenic belt where numerous other VMS deposits of Late Triassic age 
have been identified.

Figure 8-1: Depositional Setting for the Greens Creek Mineral Deposit 
(Steeves, 2018)  

 
 

Earlier investigators accepted the Triassic rifting, deep circulation of seawater and 
seafloor deposition but pointed to several observations out of line with 'typical' VMS 
deposits such as: 

• An intra-arc setting 
• Apparent sub-seafloor replacement mineralization 
• Lack of felsic igneous rock and a preponderance of ultramafics 
• A lack of focused feeder systems 
• Chromium and barium rich silicates and carbonate alteration 
• High zinc, lead and silver grades without typical high (several percent) 

copper grades 

Steeves (2018) responds to these arguments using observations from other VMS 
deposits which have the same characteristics.  VMS deposits have been identified 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations

in other intra-arc settings whereas SEDEX and MVT deposits tend to form on craton 
margins only.  SEDEX deposits are limited to anoxic basins whereas the argillites of 
Greens Creek show pronounced negative Ce anomalies and high Y/Ho ratios 
indicative of oxic conditions in the basin.  The abundant barite also argues for oxic 
conditions in the basin.  Sub-seafloor replacement is common at other VMS deposits 
as well, a condition that only requires longevity of the hydrothermal system post-
burial.   

Further mapping, drilling and age dating of units has confirmed bimodal volcanism 
of similar age to the Greens Creek deposit, which is typical for VMS deposits and 
not SEDEX or MVT deposits.  Continued mapping and drilling have located two 
major feeder systems in the footwall unknown to the earlier investigators, which is 
understandable as the feeders are sub-parallel to the footwall/hanging wall mine 
contact and immediately underlie most of the mined zones.  As the mafic to 
ultramafic footwall was enriched in chromium it is not surprising that high chromium 
is found in the alteration products as well as direct sedimentary input to the base of 
the Hyd Group. 

The main feeder system responsible for Greens Creek has also been shown to be 
zoned over several miles of strike length with the more copper-rich core north of the 
mine area.  It is only the zinc-rich and copper-poor portion of the feeder system which 
underlies the mine.  Rather than the Greens Creek hydrothermal system being low 
in copper, only the cooler zinc, lead and silver southern limb was preserved below 
current topography.  Zonation of the preserved mineral deposit shows a hotter core 
on the northern end and cooler baritic mineral styles on the southern end.  The 
mineral styles do not zone back to cooler types north of the Greens Creek mineral 
body but were eroded off above the copper rich feeder zone north of Greens Creek. 

Steeves (2018) also argues that the enrichment of gold, silver, zinc and lead are 
incompatible in a typical low temperature SEDEX type deposit as the solubility of 
gold is inverse to the other metals given chloride and bi-sulfide complexing activities, 
and therefore could not explain the rich endowment of all the metals at Greens 
Creek.  Steeves also explains the exceptional metal budget of high gold with high 
silver, zinc and lead as being derived from Devonian – Mississippian mafic 
metavolanics (CR, SP) and graphitic metasedimentary (SPgr) footwall rocks 
enriched in the metals. 

In summary data obtained since the original USGS (2010) publication explains the 
apparent incongruities of the Greens Creek deposit relative to other VMS deposits.  
The only remaining oddity is that the Greens Creek deposit formed directly on a 
100Ma unconformity, a very unique stratigraphic location for a VMS deposit.  There 
is no reason why the VMS system shouldn't form at this stratigraphic location 
however, and some have proposed that the conglomerate at the unconformity may 
have been a permeable aquifer for the hydrothermal fluids creating the deposit. 

The QP concurs with the interpretation that the Greens Creek mineral deposit is of 
the VMS type and consider the model and interpreted deposit genesis to be 
appropriate to support exploration activities.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

Historical exploration activities at the Greens Creek project prior to Hecla's 
acquisition of the land package in March 2008, are extensive. Exploration 
commenced in 1973. A complete overview of exploration activities at Greens Creek, 
including work completed by Hecla since its acquisition of Greens Creek in 2008, is 
included in Table 6-1. 

This section focuses mainly on exploration activities since Hecla acquired sole 
possession of the property. Hecla's exploration targeting and activities have been 
built upon refined historical exploration data combined with more recent systematic 
exploration data. 

Since 2008, Hecla has completed surface and underground core drilling programs 
(see Section 10), auger and MMI soil geochemistry, ground and borehole pulse 
electromagnetic (EM) geophysical surveys, and historic survey compilation. 
Reconnaissance and detailed scale geologic mapping have been done by Dr. Norm 
Duke, Dr. John Proffett, and various Hecla staff geologists. These exploration 
programs are summarized in Table 9-1. 

9.1 Grids and Surveys 
The original regional identification of the Greens Creek deposit was likely done with 
USGS topographic maps.  The USGS quadrangle maps from this period use the 
horizontal North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27).   

By 1977 an assumed or local plane grid was developed for the immediate area 
surrounding the Big Sore.  This grid is orthogonal to true north and is still in use for 
all current underground surveying and is referred to as the "mine grid". 

A second assumed grid was also developed prior to commencement of the 
underground drill program in 1978.  This grid was rotated 26° 33' 54'' W (counter-
clockwise) of the mine grid to parallel the average strike of the East Zone.  The origin 
was offset to the southwest of the East Zone.  This grid, known as the "geo-grid", is 
still in use for planning drillhole layouts, sectional geologic interpretations and 
mineral resource modeling.  All grid coordinates are in U.S. Geological Survey Feet.  
The coordinate transform coefficients for conversion from/to mine grid to geo-grid 
are shown in Table 9-2.   

Beginning in 1983 the horizontal datum was changed from NAD27 to North 
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  All surface exploration mapping, geochemistry 
grids, drill collars and geophysical surveys exist in both NAD27 and the NAD83 
datum.  Affine transform parameters used for coordinate transformation of mine grid 
to Alaska State Plane Zone 1, NAD83 are shown in Figure 9-3.

9.2 Geological Mapping 
Mapping at Greens Creek has been ongoing since 1976. A basic understanding of 
the lithologic units was first gathered from early drillholes in the Big Sore Creek area 
immediately east of the current mine. In 1977, a Noranda geologist, John Dunbier, 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 124  

realized that the mineralized zone was at a lithologic contact between argillite and 
tuffites (the tuffites were later recognized as phyllites). This lithologic contact has 
been dubbed the "Mine Contact". To date, over 30 miles (48 km) of Mine Contact 
have been identified through mapping efforts and less than 10 miles (16 km) have 
been tested by diamond drilling. 

Figure 7-3 in Section 7 displays a compilation of mapping undertaken from 1974 
through to the present day. The map has been compiled from different sources and 
has changed over time as new data are available. The major contributors to this 
regional geology map are Paul A. Lindberg, Norman A. Duke, John M. Proffett, 
Andrew W. West, Paul W. Jensen, and Christopher D. Mack. 

Dr. Paul Lindberg made mapping contributions from 1995–2000. His efforts are 
reflected in the current geological understanding of the deposit and through 
numerous cross-section interpretations. On the regional map, Dr. Lindberg's 
mapping is visible in the Mariposite Ridge prospect area, Upper Gallagher, East Lil' 
Sore and Upper Big Sore Basin prospects; his maps range from a very detailed 
1:200 scale to 1:10,000 metric scale. 

Dr. Norm Duke has been responsible for the regional (1:10,000) metric scale 
mapping of the geology at Greens Creek from 1995 through 2014. His regional 
mapping sheets are usually the first observations made in an unknown area and 
influence future decisions for follow-up efforts. It is in part through Dr. Duke's efforts 
that the Mine Contact has been extended for the distance it has. Dr. Duke has 
covered most of the land package north of Greens Creek. 

Dr. John Proffett conducts detailed mapping at 1:24,000 scale. His contributions 
have been in both underground and surface mapping with structural interpretations. 
Dr. Proffett started with a month of mapping in 1987, with mapping of the 1350 drift 
in the underground. After 1987, Dr. Proffett did not return to the Greens Creek 
property until 1996. Since that time, he has mapped at Greens Creek every year to 
the present. His areas of focus have been Big Sore Basin, Upper Big Sore Ridge, 
Upper Big Sore, Lakes District, High Sore, Cliff Creek, Big Boil, Killer Creek and the 
underground mine. 

Andrew West, Greens Creek's exploration superintendent from 1998 to January 
2011, contributed to the map shown in Figure 7-3 in portions of the Upper and Lower 
Zinc Creek areas as well as in the Cub Creek, Bruin Creek, Little Sore, and Gallagher 
prospects.  His mapping was also performed at 1:24,000 scale. 

9.3 Soil Sampling 
Table 9-4 summarizes the soil sampling programs since 1974.  The auger and MMI 
soil geochemistry maps shown in Figures 9-1 and 9-2 are contours of the silver in 
auger drilling and silver in MMI data respectively.  Additional maps reflecting 
contoured values for gold, lead, zinc, and copper have also been developed.   

The auger soil sampling grids cover every prospect from the southern to the northern 
boundaries within the Greens Creek's land package.  Within each prospect, the grid 
spacing of samples is 100 ft (30 m) apart along grid lines spaced 300 ft (90 m) apart, 
which originate from an established baseline.  Standard auger soil samples are 
taken at each station.  All soil campaigns were successful in delineating geochemical 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

March 2019 125  

anomalies within many of the prospects.  

Since 2008, Hecla has continued investigating the land package for economic 
mineral potential by compiling historical rock and soil geochemistry into 
comprehensive maps. 

Most recent efforts focus on developing soil geochemistry from within the North 
Young claim group.  Prior to 2008, Mine Contact lithologies were identified by 
regional scale mapping within this area.  This mapping successfully extended the 
contact 9,500 ft (2,896 m) in the district, warranting further follow-up exploration.  
This included establishing a soil-sampling grid over the contacts' location and flanks.  
So far, the sampling has revealed some small anomalies which will be followed-up 
by in-fill sampling in order to develop targets.  Hecla has mostly employed the use 
of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses for 53 
elements within this area.  However, in 2010–2011 the use of MMI analysis was 
used on samples taken within the Greens Creek land boundary.   

A total of 1,443 MMI and 2,309 auger soil samples have been collected since 2008.  
Results of the exercise suggested several single point anomalies within the soil data.  
Overall, the soil data points to the East Lil' Sore, Killer Creek, Gallagher Creek, and 
Bruin Creek target areas as the best surface geochemical targets.  The soil 
geochemical data also appears to identify the two main structural trends dominated 
by the northwest-trending Maki and Gallagher Fault systems.  The data also indicate 
that precious metals appear to favor the Maki Fault system and the base metals 
have a stronger relationship with the Gallagher Fault system.

9.4 Geophysics 
Various geophysical surveys have been conducted at Greens Creek since 1996 by 
several geophysical contractors and the previous Greens Creek owners.   

Historic geophysical surveys prior to Hecla's acquisition of the property in March 
2008 include airborne, ground and bore-hole surveys.  Details of these geophysical 
surveys are summarized in Table 9-5 and Section 6 of this report.  Table 9-5 also 
summarizes the surveys undertaken between 1996 and 2007 including 1,227 line 
kilometers of AeroDat airborne frequency-domain electromagnetic, magnetic, and 
radiometric surveys (1996), ground pulse EM (1998-99), gravity (1996–98), 
magnetic (1997–2003), controlled-source audio-frequency magneto-telluric (1996–
2007), and audio-frequency magneto-telluric (2004–05) surveys, and bore hole TEM 
and UTEM3 surveys (1996–2004). 

The results from the ground gravity surveys are summarized in Figure 9-3, those of 
the ground magnetic surveys in Figure 9-4, and the AeroDat geophysical survey 
results are included as Figure 9-5. 

VOX Geoscience Ltd. based out of Vancouver BC, Canada, was contracted in 2010 
to assist in the compilation of the historical geophysical surveys completed on the 
property and to recommend geophysical survey methods that could be effective in 
future exploration work.  Data from the 1996 AeroDat airborne survey was high 
quality but in the 15 years since the survey was flown; geophysical software and 
processing methods have steadily improved.    

Beginning in late 2010 and early 2011, Hecla began a program of re-processing the 
survey results.  The first step involved micro-levelling the aeromagnetic data to 
remove the effects of line offsets and line corrugation.  The survey was studied line 
by line and any spurious readings that could be attributed to man-made cultural 
interference were removed by hand.  The resulting, cleaned, grid was then filtered.  
Figure 9-6 shows a close up of the Greens Creek Mine and Big Sore areas with the 
re-processed tilt derivative contouring.  A very good fit between the mapped 
northeastern Mine Contact and the western edge of the strong magnetic low (blue) 
can be observed. 

Techno Imaging of Salt Lake City was contracted in late 2010 to use their 3D EM 
Inversion software on a 211 linear mile (340 line-kilometer) subset of the 1996 
AeroDat EM survey.  The inversions showed little more than draping the AeroDat 
low and mid-frequency resistivity grids over Lidar did.  The remaining 551 line-miles 
(887 line-kilometers) of data were not inverted.

In 2011, Crone Geophysics & Exploration Limited based in Mississauga, Ontario, 
Canada, was contracted by Hecla to conduct surface and borehole pulse 
electromagnetic surveys on the Killer Creek target area.  Twelve surface lines 
utilizing two surface loops and two boreholes were surveyed form one transmitter 
loop.  The surface surveys were carried out using a time base of 100.00 msec 
(2.5Hz) with a 1.5 m/sec shut-off ramp time.  Vertical and in-line data were collected 
at a nominal station spacing of 82 ft (25 m).   

Some interesting but confusing data were acquired as the host lithologies in the area 
can be very conductive. In particular, discriminating graphitic sediments from 
sulfides is problematic for electromagnetic surveys.  However, the Crone Pulse 
Electro Magnetic data was modelled with Electromagnetic Imaging Technology 
Maxwell software, which resulted in the isolation of a small conductor from the 
background conductivity.  This small conductor was drill tested in 2012 and copper-
rich sulfide mineralization was intersected in a vein zone varying from 2.1 to 7.0 ft 
(0.6–2.1 m) with anomalous copper and silver values.

9.6 Exploration Potential 
Greens Creek exploration programs are designed to continually develop prospective 
target areas, evaluate emerging prospects, and test potential economic targets. 
Development of favorable areas includes regional mapping, followed by 
geochemical sampling and/or geophysical surveys. Evaluation activities include 
detailed geologic mapping and the incorporation of refined historical data with new 
exploration data to establish target potential. Testing involves diamond core drilling 
with the assessment of new information.  Since Hecla assumed 100% ownership of 
Greens Creek in 2008, surface exploration programs have tested several prospects 
per season. 

In 1977, it was recognized that the mineralization at Greens Creek is associated with 
the lithologic contact between argillite and phyllite. This was dubbed the "mine 
contact". To date, much of the mine contact on the Greens Creek claim block has 
not been tested, even at 1,000-ft drill spacing.   

The main feeder system under the Greens Creek deposit is still being targeted where 
it meets the Mine Contact in the mine area.  A separate, lower feeder system was 
found to mineralize the Mine Contact on a major anticline below the mine workings.  
This lower system has not been tested over most of the northern claim area. 

Underground exploration at Greens Creek has historically followed the Mine Contact 
down dip and down plunge. When the contact is interrupted by major structural 
boundaries such as the Klaus Shear or the Maki and Gallagher Fault systems, 
exploration strategy concentrates on locating the Mine Contact across the structure, 
then continuing to follow it down plunge. After the initial discovery of the East Zone, 
the implementation of this strategy has led to the discovery the West, Northwest 
West, 9A, 5250, Southwest, 200 South zones, and most recently the Deep 200 
South and Gallagher zones. 

Exploration targets underground are categorized as emerging or advanced based 
upon the amount of drill testing that has been applied to that target. Currently there 
are five major exploration targets being tested at Greens Creek, all on the main 
Greens Creek feeder system.  They are: 1) down plunge on the 200 South Zone, 2) 
down plunge on the Gallagher Zone, 3) down plunge on the Northwest-West Zone, 
4) down plunge on the 5250 Zone and 5) out strike on the Upper Plate Zone.  These 
targets are shown in relationship to the current mineral resources in Figure 9-7.

9.6.1 200 South Down Plunge 

The Deep 200 South Zone projects to the south 750 to 1,000 ft from current mineral 
resource to the Gallagher Fault where it is likely cut and offset to become the 
Gallagher Zone.  As ore grade mineralization is present in drilling at the southern 
end of the known 200 South Zone, and as the Gallagher Zone also has mineable 
grades, it is expected that drilling down plunge on the 200 South Zone will intercept 
750 to 1,000 ft of well mineralized rock before being cut off by the Gallagher Fault. 

Exploration down plunge has typically been from an exploration drift at the -390 ft 
elevation, which will continue to work for defining the upper benches of 
mineralization described in Figure 7-42 of Section 7.  This bench mineralization does 
not represent the main mineral trend of the 200S Zone at the southern end however 
as the hotter MFP and MFB mineralization diverged from the bench and are now on 
an anticlinal hinge below the benches at about -1,100 ft elevation.  To adequately 
test and convert this main trend of mineralization another exploration drift at the -
790 ft elevation is planned.  This exploration work will continue for several years into 
the future. Figure 9-8 shows the Deep 200 South Zone and the Gallagher Zone 
planned drifts.

9.6.2 Gallagher Zone Down Plunge  

The Gallagher Zone is interpreted as the faulted offset of the 200 South Zone. Based 
on this interpretation, the zone represents the down plunge continuation of the upper 
bench of the 200 South as depicted in Figure 7-42 of Section 7.  Below this bench 
the main trend of Greens Creek has been identified under the 200 South Zone, but 
drilling has not been carried out to follow this trend to the south.  The M790 drift 
shown in Figure 9-8 will be necessary to follow this main trend to the south. The 
4211-exploration drift will also continue to advance to the south to follow the upper 
level bench mineralization as shown in Figure 7-42 of Section 7.   

9.6.3 Northwest West Zone Down Plunge 

The Northwest West Zone represents the lowest of three mineralized trends 
identified at Greens Creek.  Down plunge from the current mineral reserve significant 
inferred mineral resource is present and is open to the south.  Recent completion of 
the PD150 ramp has given access for drilling this down plunge extension which has 
begun in 2019.  This mineralization will be followed to the south until it terminates or 
connects with the lower levels of the Southwest Zone. 

9.6.4 5250 Zone Down Plunge  

Underground exploration drilling in 2016 and surface drilling in 2017 identified 
mineralized Mine Contact approximately 2,000 ft south of, and on trend with, the 
current 5250 Zone mineral resource.  This drilling indicates that the 5250 Zone trend 
may host significant mineralization between the mineral resource and the exploration 
drilling.  Surface exploration drilling was planned to step closer to the 5250 Zone 
mineral resource but was canceled due to focus on Upper Plate Zone drilling in 2018.  
As this 2,000 ft of open ground is highly prospective it will be targeted in the future 
from both surface and underground drilling.  

9.6.5 Upper Plate along strike  

Surface drilling in 2018 pushed the Upper Plate mineral resource westward and 
indicates the mineralization is still open to the northwest to southwest direction.  
Further drilling is planned to follow up on this high grade MFB material to the west. 

9.6.6 Lower Feeder System  

Below the entire mine, but still on the Mine Contact mineralization has been found 
on a major anticline which closes to the east.  The mineralization, called the 
"Northeast Contact" target, was tested in the mine area and to the north across the 
Greens Creek drainage from 2008 to 2011.  Though a hydrothermal system was 
clearly active in this area, and some high-grade intercepts were encountered, no 
mineral resource or mineral reserve was created. 

While better defining the main feeder system for the Greens Creek deposit in drilling 
and on surface, a second, lower feeder system was apparent.  This feeder system 
coincides with the "Northeast Contact" target and appears be the source of 
mineralization at the Lil'Sore prospect (Figure 6-1 of Section 6.)  Between these two 
target areas, a distance of over 2.5 miles (4 km), significant mine contact is expected

at depth and remains to be tested.  As VMS mineralization is typically located where 
feeder systems intersect the mine contact, this area is highly prospective. 

9.6.7 Other Prospects  

Many other prospects are present across the claim block as the geochemical 
sampling maps indicate.  Exploration is difficult as geochemical anomalies may be 
in the footwall and geophysical anomalies such as magnetic, gravity or conductive 
highs can just as easily be associated with greenstone, serpentinite or graphitic 
argillites and schists, respectively.  Overturned F2 folding also complicates 
exploration as mine contact may be folded under footwall lithologies at any place on 
the claim block. 

Mineralization at Zinc Creek is folded and likely associated with the main Greens 
Creek feeder system but has a large thrust complicating the geology (Figures 6-1 
and Figure 7-3 of Sections 6 and 7).  Mineralization is present between the Zinc 
Creek and Lil'Sore prospects with very few drillholes.  More drilling is needed to 
adequately assess the mineral potential of this area. 

Southeast of the mine several square kilometers of the claim block is essentially 
unexplored.  The USGS has indicated that the Mine Contact is present less than 
1,500 ft below surface in this area (Karl, 2016).  Furthermore, the Hyd Group which 
dominates the surface outcrop in this area may yet have VMS deposits within the 
section as others VMS deposits are in the Triassic Metallogenic Belt. 

9.7 Comments on Exploration 
In the QP's opinion: 

• The exploration programs completed to date are appropriate to the style of 
the deposit and prospects; 

• The research work supports Hecla's genetic and affinity interpretations for 
the deposits;   

• Additional drilling has a likelihood of generating further exploration 
successes, particularly down-plunge of known zones.

10.0 DRILLING 

A total of 7,655 drillholes adding up to 3,821,250 feet (1,164,717 m) have been 
completed over the entire Project area from 1975 to 2018 (Figure 10-1; Tables 10-1 
and 10-2). Of these drillholes, 412 drillholes for 508,454 feet (154,977 m) are surface 
holes drilled for exploration or mineral resource development purposes. 
Underground exploration or mineral resource definition drillholes number 5,029 for 
2,820,521 feet (859,695 m) and are typically drilled on 50 to 200 ft (15 to 60 m) 
spaced vertical sections. The remaining 2,214 drillholes, adding up to 492,287 ft 
(150,049 m), are underground pre-production drillholes that are drilled on cross- and 
plan-sections spaced from 20 to 50 ft (15 to 60 m). 

All bedrock drilling has been completed using core methods. Surface drillholes 
collared in unconsolidated sediments utilize RC methods until bedrock is 
encountered (typically less than 100 ft or 30 m) and are then completed using core 
methods. 

10.1 Pre-2008 Legacy Drilling 
Prior to 2008, a total of 4,792 drillholes (2,196,695 ft or 669,553 m) had been 
completed (Table 10-1). Of these drillholes, 307 (305,887 ft or 93,234 m) are surface 
holes drilled for exploration or mineral resource development, 2,963 (1,590,079 ft or 
484,656 m) are underground mineral resource definition drillholes, and 1,522 
(300,728 ft or 91,662 m) are underground pre-production drillholes. 

10.2 Hecla Drilling 
Since 2008, a total of 2,863 drillholes (1,624,566 ft or 495,168 m) have been 
completed (Table 10-2). Of these drillholes, 105 (202,567 ft or 61,742 m) are surface 
holes drilled for exploration or mineral resource development, 2,066 (1,230,442 ft or 
375,039 m) are underground mineral resource definition drillholes, and 692 (191,559 
ft or 58,387 m) are underground pre-production drillholes.  Figure 10-1 shows the 
locations of surface and underground diamond drillholes.

10.3 Drill Methods 

10.3.1 Pre-2008 or Legacy Drilling 

The drilling methods of prior operators were similar to the practices employed by 
Hecla. Underground core was mostly NQ or NQTK diameter, and minor footage of 
BQ and BQTK diameter core was used for longer holes.  In some drillholes, the drill 
core diameter was reduced from NQ/NQTK to BQ/BQTK (telescoping) due to 
problematic ground conditions, typically as a result of faulting.  

Surface legacy exploration drilling also utilized methods similar to current Hecla 
practices. Drilling in the overburden (unconsolidated sediments) utilized HQ as 
casing and drill core was typically reduced to NQ or NQTK once bedrock was 
encountered. In some drillholes, the drill core diameter was reduced from NQ to BQ 
due to problematic ground conditions. 

Legacy drilling methods, where known, are summarized in Table 10-3. Information 
concerning the number and types of drill rigs utilized for the legacy underground and 
surface drill programs are not available.

10.3.2 Hecla Drilling 

Hecla has explored Greens Creek deposits since 2008 with core holes spaced at 
various intervals depending on the stage of exploration and development. 

Surface exploration holes (PS-prefix series drillholes) are drilled primarily with HQ 
and NQTK tools. To drill through the unconsolidated overburden HQ-diameter tri-
cone methods are utilized. Typically, one to six holes are drilled from remote, 
helicopter-accessible sites, and more rarely from the existing mine road system. All 
sites require USFS approval prior to construction of a wooden drill platform. A typical 
remote site requires a 60 ft x 60 ft (18 x 18 m) clearing to ensure safe access by 
helicopter. 

All remote drilling is supported by one Greens Creek dedicated helicopter (Hughes 
500D) based at Hawk Inlet. Drill rigs are moved using an A-Star B2 or B3, which is 
mobilized from Juneau as needed. During the active drill season one to two drills are 
active on a 24-hour basis, 7-days per week. Drill plans are laid out parallel to geo-
grid sections (refer to Section 9.1 for an explanation of the Project grids). 

Definition holes (GC-prefix series drillholes) are drilled with NQTK or HQ tools. Holes 
are drilled in fans principally from underground drill stations spaced from 50 to 100 
ft (15.2 to 30 m) along strike of mineralization. Depending on the availability of drill 
stations, the vertical spacing of holes within mineralization in individual sections may 
range from 12 to 100 ft (3.6 to 30 m). 

Pre-production holes (PP-prefix series) and stope holes (ST-prefix series) are drilled 
with NQTK tools. PP drill fans are drilled at 50 ft (15.2 m) intervals along strike of 
mineralization and on 30 to 60 ft (9 to 18 m) vertical intervals. Most PP drillholes are 
planned to produce a final drillhole spacing of 50 ft (15.2 m) or less in mineralized 
zones. ST-prefix series drillholes are drilled in areas of complex mineralized shapes 
to aid mine design and planning. 

Drill core for exploration, in-fill and definition purposes is NQ in diameter. In some 
drillholes, the drill core diameter is reduced from HQ to NQ to BQ (telescoping) due 
to ground conditions problems, typically as a result of faulting. Longer holes or holes 
in areas with anticipated bad ground are generally collared using HQ tooling. Table 
10-4 summarizes the size of coring at Greens Creek post-2008.  Table 10-5 
summarizes the makes and models of drilling equipment utilized between 2008 and 
2018. 

Once retrieved from the core barrel, the core is placed in sequential order in core 
boxes labeled with the drillhole number. Each successive section of core drilled, 
usually 10 ft (3 m) long, is identified by a wood block marked with the depth of the 
interval. At the end of each shift, core boxes are transported by the drillers to the 
logging area which is located at the 860 Area on surface.

10.4 Geological Logging 

10.4.1 Legacy Drilling 

The current system of logging employed by Hecla has been used with minor 
modifications since 1987 (starting with drillhole GC0150).  Prior to 1987, lithological 
nomenclature differed in the names applied to various units.  All of the pre-1987 
logging has been translated into the current system based on the descriptive details 
from the original logs.  Over 95% of the logged intervals contained adequate details 
to unequivocally place intervals into the current lithological system.  Where 
insufficient descriptions did occur, assays and or adjacent holes were utilized to 
ensure continuity. Other differences found in the pre-1987 logging include the use 
of longer maximum sample lengths (up to 10 ft or 3 m) that may span multiple 
lithologies.  Finally, not all of the legacy logs prior to 2000 have consistently recorded 
RQD and fracture counts. The majority of the legacy core was photographed wet 
with either 35 mm slides or digitally. 

10.4.2 Hecla Drilling 

Underground drill core is logged for recovery, RQD, lithology, alteration, 
mineralization, structure and fabric.  Lithologies can be subdivided into non-
mineralized/non-ore (generally not mineralized but may contain erratic high-grade 
values that can be mined) and mineralized/ore categories.   

Surface core is logged for recovery, lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure 
and fabric.  The surface lithologies use the same classification system as the 
underground. Typically, surface core logs contain a higher level of descriptive details 
than underground logs.  All logs are recorded on paper at a 1 in = 10 ft scale.

All core is photographed wet. All logs are recorded on paper at scales ranging from 
1 in = 20 ft to 1 in = 5 ft, depending on observed complexity. 

10.5 Recovery 
Core recovery is generally high because of the compact nature of the greenschist 
metamorphic rocks.  Approximately 80% of drilled intervals have core recovery 
greater than 95%.  Poor recovery, defined as less than 50%, occurs in approximately 
2% of intervals.  Poor recovery is generally localized to heavily-faulted areas in the 
argillite.  

10.6 Collar Surveys 

10.6.1 Legacy Drilling 

The majority of the legacy underground drill collars were surveyed with conventional 
mine survey equipment by the mine staff.  In rare cases (~ 2%), collar locations were 
mapped by Brunton compass and tape methods from known survey points.  All collar 
points were recorded in the database utilizing the mine grid coordinate system. 

10.6.2 Hecla Drilling 

Drillholes are planned (azimuth, dip, length) by geologists on vertical cross-sections 
and on vertical longitudinal sections orthogonal to the geo-grid.   

For surface drillholes a 2 in x 4 in (5 x 10 cm) tack board is aligned with the geo-grid 
sectional line (333° azimuth) during pad construction.  When the rig is slung into 
place the skid frame is aligned with the tack board.  If drillholes are planned that are 
not parallel with the geo-grid section line, an arrow pointing in the planned direction 
is painted onto the deck.  After drillhole completion, surface drill collars are located 
using a Trimble Geo XH 600 handheld GPS instrument.  Coordinates are recorded 
into UTM-NAD83 coordinates. Accuracy is generally ±10 ft (3 m) for northing and 
easting coordinates.  Elevations are adjusted to match the local light detection and 
ranging (LiDAR) topographic survey.  

Underground drill lines are marked (front sight and back sight) by the mine 
surveyors.  After completion, underground drillhole collars are surveyed with 
conventional mine surveying equipment by Hecla staff.   

All collar locations are recorded in the database utilizing the mine grid coordinate 
system. 

10.7 Down-hole Surveys 

10.7.1 Legacy Drilling 

Prior to 1996, down-hole surveys were done by magnetic single-shot cameras.  The 
majority used a Sperry-Sun single-shot camera with a few using a Well-Nav single-
shot.  Usually a shot was taken at the collar, at 50 ft (15 m), and approximately every 
100 to 200 ft (30 to 60 m) thereafter.  If the azimuth and inclination at the collar were 
more than a few degrees different from that of the shot at 50 ft (15 m), the collar 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 152  

azimuth and inclination were regarded as suspect (affected by steel in the 
equipment) and replaced by the azimuth and inclination at 50 ft (15 m).  Magnetic 
azimuths were corrected for magnetic declination and, for the Sperry-Sun, had a 
high-latitude correction applied.  

Between 1996 and 2000 a combination of Sperry-Sun and MAXIBOR instruments 
were used.  The MAXIBOR system determines drillhole deviation optically relative 
to a survey measurement of the drillhole collar.  The Sperry-Sun was replaced with 
a Reflex© EZ-shot survey tool in 2000.  The EZ-Shot is a solid-state electronic, 
single-shot instrument with stated accuracy of ±0.5° azimuth and ±0.2° dip.  Between 
2000 and 2004, the EZ-Shot and MAXIBOR system were used in tandem.  Since 
2005 the EZ-Shot has been the only system used for down-hole surveys at Greens 
Creek. 

10.7.2 Hecla Drilling 

Hecla continued the use of the EZ-Shot system implemented in 2005; since 2008 all 
surface and underground drillholes have been surveyed using an EZ-Shot system. 

For underground drillholes an initial shot at 50 ft (15 m) depth is taken and compared 
to the planned drillhole azimuth and dip.  If the hole alignment is off by more than 
±3° in azimuth or ±1° in dip the hole is typically stopped and re-collared.  After the 
initial 50 ft (15 m) shot, surveys are typically taken every 200 ft (60 m) and at the 
end of the drillhole.  Surveys are taken as the drillhole advances.  Readings that 
show anomalous magnetic field strength are flagged as suspect during database 
entry. 

For surface drillholes, an initial survey is first shot below the casing and then every 
100 ft (30 m) down hole thereafter as the drillhole progress.  A final shot is taken at 
the end of the drillhole upon completion. 

10.8 Geotechnical and Hydrological Drilling 

10.8.1 Legacy Drilling 

Surface-based drilling methods of prior operators were similar to the practices 
employed by Hecla.  Prior to 2008, a significant number of geotechnical and 
hydrological drillholes were completed in support of construction and operations of 
the Greens Creek surface facilities.  Areas covered by these holes include the 920 
Area, Site 23-D, Site E, and the TDF.  An accurate tally of the number of holes and 
footage for this period is not currently available. 

Underground geologic core drilling methods of prior operators were similar to the 
practices employed by Hecla.  However, the portion of the legacy Ingres database 
that contained core recoveries and RQD data was not successfully recovered with 
the transfer to acQuire in 2008 (see Section 12.2 for details).  These data are still 
available on the paper logs. 

10.8.2 Hecla Drilling 

Since 2008, a total of 136 geotechnical and hydrological holes for a total of 7,619.1 
ft (2,322.3 m) have been completed (Table 10-6). The drill campaign in 2009 was 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 153  

focused on investigating existing pile conditions at the tailings disposal facility (TDF). 
A uniaxial hydraulic jab was used to push a 3.0 in (7.6 cm) diameter Shelby sample 
tube into the TDF for collection.  Sample depths ranged from 20 to 45 ft (6–13.7 m). 

Drilling investigations in 2010 and 2011 were in support of a proposed TDF 
expansion. Additionally, in 2010, Site 23, the mill back slope area, and 1350 Area 
were drill tested to support stability and groundwater monitoring programs.  The 
2010 program utilized a CME-75 track-mounted rig operated by Cascade Drilling of 
Woodinville, Washington; the 2011 program utilized a heli-portable CME-45C drill 
rig operated by Denali Drilling Inc. of Alaska. 

The typical methodology for foundation and hydrogeological investigations in 2010 
and 2011 included using hollow-stem auger drilling for peat, tri-cone mud rotary 
(water/bentonite-based) for sand/gravel/till, and HQ3 coring for bedrock lithology. 
Data collection included standard penetration testing (SPT), typically at 5 ft (1.5 m) 
intervals and sample collection using a SPT split spoon for index testing. Core 
samples were also taken where bedrock was encountered. Where clays were 
encountered, Shelby tube samples were typically collected. 

For drill rigs with auto-hammer capability (2010), energy transfer efficiency 
measurements were taken utilizing a pile driving analyzer at initiation of the drill 
program to verify correlation. For drill rigs without auto-hammer capability (2011), 
energy transfer efficiency measurements were taken throughout the duration of the 
field program for blow count correction. 

During the 2011 drill program, a vane borer was also utilized for in-situ shear strength 
data collection. Since 2012, the geotechnical drilling has focused on the tailings 
disposal facility. 

Hecla logs geotechnical data on all standard underground drill core, and data are 
stored in the acQuire® database.  The dataset includes core recovery (all core), 
RQD data, and fracture count (sampled intervals and all ST holes).  The data set is 
used in conjunction with the lithologic rock type to classify the mining areas based 
on the Greens Creek Ground Support Management Plan (GCMP).  The GCMP is 
audited and validated by outside consultants.

10.9 Metallurgical Drilling 
Current metallurgical testing is primarily based on actual mill feed or composite 
samples collected from underground faces.  See Section 11.2 for a description of 
metallurgical drill sampling. 

10.10 Sample Length/True Thickness 
Drillholes are designed to intersect the mineralization as perpendicular as possible; 
reported mineralized intercepts are typically longer than the true thickness of the 
mineralization.  

A series of section and plan maps for each mineralized zone are included in Section 
7.4.  These maps include drillhole traces, block model outlines, and an interpretation 
of major geologic contacts and faults.  These plans and figures show that drill 
orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style and have been 
drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of mineralization for the bulk 
of the deposit areas.

10.11 Comments on Drilling 
In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logging, geotechnical, collar 
and down-hole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs are 
sufficient to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation as follows: 

• Core logging performed by Hecla staff meets industry standards for 
exploration on polymetallic deposits; 

• Core logging performed prior to Hecla acquiring 100% Project ownership met 
industry standards at the time of logging; 

• Collar surveys for Hecla core holes have been performed using industry-
standard instrumentation; 

• Collar surveys for legacy drillholes were performed using methods that were 
industry-standard for the time; 

• Down-hole surveys performed after 2008 were performed using industry-
standard instrumentation;  

• Prior to 1996, magnetic single-shot cameras were used for down-hole 
surveys.  Although standard for the time, these readings can be affected by 
magnetic rocks and drill casings.  From 1996 to 2006, industry-standard 
instrumentation was used; 

• Drilling practices, logging, collar surveys and down-hole surveys have been 
periodically reviewed by independent auditors (refer to Section 12);  

• Recovery data from core drill programs are acceptable; 
• Geotechnical logging of drill core meets industry standards for planned open 

pit and underground operations; 
• Drilling is normally perpendicular to the strike of the mineralization;  
• Drill orientations are shown in the example cross-sections in Section 7, and 

are considered to appropriately test the mineralization;   
• No factors were identified with the data collection from the drill programs that 

could affect Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimation.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling Methods 

11.1.1 Face Samples 

Nearly every mining face is marked with paint to delineate the mineral subtypes, plus 
argillite and phyllite wall rocks, low-grade mineralized material, and occasional high-
grade precious metals zones.  Usually a single face sample is taken from each 
mineral type; where the area represented by a mineral type is greater than 50 ft2 
(4.6 m2), multiple face samples are taken.  These samples are taken by chipping the 
face on an irregular grid.  

The locations of stope-face samples are initially recorded in the grade control 
geologist's field book, wherein the geologist records the distance to the face, 
typically the center, from a spad, rib or other reference object/feature.  On the 
surface, the geologist utilizes an AutoLISP program within AutoCAD to insert a 
"stope-face" block at the appropriate measured distance from the reference object 
into an as-built drawing for the appropriate bench elevation.  The orientation of the 
stope-face (relative to the drift/drive) is determined by the geologist. The geologist 
adjusts the stope-face block positions manually based upon detailed stope surveys. 

The area of each sampled face is calculated using two different methods.  The first 
method is the traditional cross-sectional area (width by height).  The second method 
relies upon digital photography of the face and then on-screen digitization of the 
distinct sample areas on the photo.  The individual sample areas are electronically 
summed and then compared with the first method.  Hecla tolerates up to a 20% 
difference between the two area methods; differences larger than this are not 
permitted by the data-entry procedure, which requires the data entry person to 
modify the input data. 

A detailed survey is performed in active stopes at least every five days and 
preferably after every three rounds.  The elevation is initially based on the mid-rib 
elevation and is more accurately "back determined" at the end of the month through 
the wire-framing of the back and floor survey points.  

The survey crew consists of a single individual utilizing a special Geodimeter total 
station equipped with a visible red laser.  The instrument calculates the distance to 
an object by reading the reflected laser beam.  This makes for very efficient single-
person surveying, although erroneous distance readings can and do occur.  The 
distance that can be measured is limited/impacted by the reflectivity of the target 
object, the clarity of the air in the stope/drive, and the angle at which the laser hits 
the target.  The erroneous distances for the detailed survey points are readily 
identified and removed after loading the survey data into AutoCAD. 

11.1.2 Core Samples 

Drill core is sampled using two methods based on the stage of drilling.  Exploration 
and definition drilling are sampled on intervals ranging from 1 to 5 ft (0.3 to 1.5 m) 
that do not cross lithological boundaries. Exploration drillholes are cut and sampled 
as half-core; definition drillholes are whole-core sampled. 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 157  

Barren contacts are sampled through 15-ft (4.6-m) 'buffer' zones into the hanging 
wall and the footwall; whereas mineralized or ore-type contacts are sampled through 
30-ft (9.2-m) 'buffers' into the hanging wall and footwall.  If a mineral type lithology 
is encountered off the mine contact, it will also receive a 30-ft (9.2-m) buffer on both 
sides.  If a mineralized, but non-ore type, lithology is encountered off the mine 
contact, the buffer length is at the discretion of the logging geologist, but not to be 
less than 5 feet (1.5 m). 

For sampling the buffer zones, narrower intervals of one 2-ft (0.6-m) followed by one 
3-ft (1-m) sample, are placed immediately adjacent to lithological contacts; 5-ft (1.5-
m) intervals are sampled through the rest of the buffer zone.   

Mineralization occurring within veins or as remobilized bands away from contacts 
are sampled in 5-ft (1.5-m) intervals or less, depending on the thickness of 
mineralization, and are enclosed by 5-ft (1.5-m) buffer samples.   

Geologists are responsible for identifying samples in the core, labeling each sample 
extent with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flagging, and documenting them with 
photographic logs.  Sample intervals are also recorded on the paper log sheets and 
in the drillhole database.  Core samples are dispatched to the underground cutting 
facility where technicians process the sample intervals into half-core samples.  The 
half-core sample intervals are individually bagged and then delivered to the 
laboratory. 

Pre-production and stope drillholes are typically sampled through the majority of the 
drillhole as whole-core, with sample intervals ranging from 1 to 5 feet (0.3–1.5 m).  
Samples are documented in an identical method to exploration and definition core. 

11.2 Metallurgical Sampling 
Prior to 2000, composited quarter-cut definition drill core was used for metallurgical 
test work on a mineral zone basis in selective cases.  The core was chosen from 
select definition drillhole intervals that had been previously sampled. Since 2000, 
metallurgical sampling is done using quarter-cut definition or exploration drill core on 
an as-needed basis when new zones or new mineral styles are encountered. 

11.3 Density/SG Determinations 
The procedure for measuring specific gravity (SG) of core at Greens Creek is the 
weight in water versus weight in air method.  The weighing takes place after the core 
has been logged, but before the core is cut, and occurs in the underground core 
cutting facility.  Exploration and definition core holes are considered for density 
sampling. 

Samples of whole core approximately 1 to 5 feet (0.3 to1.5 m) in length are weighed 
in air and the weight is recorded on the paper SG sheet.  The sample and tray are 
then placed in water until fully submerged and the weight recorded.  Completed 
sheets are returned to the 860-Core Shack for manual data entry.  At the time of 
data entry, the weight of the basket, wet and dry, is subtracted from the recorded 
weights accordingly and the final values are manually entered into the acQuire® 
database.  



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 158  

SG measurements are required of all exploration or definition core that is a 
mineralized or ore-type lithology as well as the associated buffer samples. For 
exploration drilling, all mineralized lithologies are sampled for SG measurements.  
For definition drilling, all mineralized lithologies within a 15-ft buffer of the main 
mineralized zones are sampled for SG measurements.   

Highly fractured or faulted core is measured for SG, though it is difficult.  The holes 
in the tray used are several millimeters in diameter.  Material deemed at risk for 
falling or flowing through those holes is generally not weighed in water or in air.  This 
type of material makes up a relatively small percentage of the total samples and is 
generally related to heavily-faulted intervals.  

11.4 Analytical and Test Laboratories 
Table 11-1 summarizes the laboratories utilized throughout the Project history and 
covers legacy and current operations.  All laboratories are independent of Hecla and 
previous operators, except for the site laboratory and Kennecott Utah Copper 
laboratory.  Dates of legacy contracts are best estimates and noted as "unclear" 
where the information was not available.   

Bondar Clegg Canada Ltd. (Bondar Clegg), now part of ALS Chemex Laboratories, 
obtained ISO 9001 certification in 1998; however, its accreditation through the period 
of use at Greens Creek is not known.  SVL Laboratories accreditation through the 
period of use at Greens Creek is also unknown.  The accreditation of other 
metallurgical laboratories, Lakefield Research, company laboratories, Kennecott 
Utah Copper Labs and CESL, are not known.   

McClelland Laboratories is a metallurgical laboratory with extensive experience in 
precious metals metallurgy and process and a good reputation within the mining 
industry; however, it is not a certified laboratory.  SGS is an ISO 9001 certified 
laboratory.   

Acme was ISO 9001 certified in 1997 and successfully maintained that certification 
until its acquisition by Bureau Veritas in 2015.  Acme and Inspectorate Laboratories 
were acquired and successfully integrated by Bureau Veritas starting January 1, 
2015. Bureau Veritas (BV) is also ISO 9001 certified. Acme/BV has been the primary 
lab used for exploration and definition drill core from 1987 to present. The Greens 
Creek Mine site laboratory is used for pre-production and grade control samples and 
is the secondary laboratory used for exploration and definition drill core samples 
since 2002.  The Greens Creek Mine site laboratory has participated in round robin 
programs to compare its results to other laboratories intermittently throughout its 
history but is not a certified laboratory.

11.5 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

11.5.1 Legacy Sampling 

Sample preparation and analytical methods have been consistent with the current 
methods since 1998 (MRDI, 1998).  Methods prior to 1998 are not well documented 
and are not known in detail.  

11.5.2 Hecla Sampling 

From 2008 through late 2011, all drill core sample preparation was done at Acme 
lab locations in Whitehorse, Yukon or Vancouver, British Columbia.  In late 2011, a 
sample preparation laboratory, purchased by Greens Creek but operated by Acme 
Lab personnel, was established on the Greens Creek site.  From late 2011 on, nearly 
all exploration and definition core samples were prepared for analysis at this facility 
on site and then shipped to the Acme Lab facility in Vancouver for analysis.  
Preparation procedures were the same, whether they occurred at the Whitehorse or 
Vancouver sites or were prepared at the Greens Creek facility.   The on-site 
preparation was discontinued in 2015 with the establishment of a new sample 
preparation facility in Juneau, AK by Bureau Veritas. 

The current preparation procedure consists of crushing to 70% passing 10 mesh (2 
mm), riffle splitting approximately 250 g, then ring pulverizing to 95% passing 150 
mesh (106 microns).  Additional cleaning of the preparation equipment is requested 
after high base metal content samples. Of the pulverized material 115 to 120 g is 
sent for analysis, and the remaining 115 to 120 g are stored as a master pulp.  

Currently, all mineralized definition and exploration drill core is assayed at BV for Au, 
Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ba.  All mineralized samples are also analyzed for a 33 
element inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) assay suite. 

Silver and base metal assays for Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe are performed using ICP-ES 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 160  

on 1.0 g samples digested in hot aqua regia.  Automatic re-analysis is triggered on 
a smaller sample size if results return above detection limits.  Silver is re-assayed 
by fire-assay with gravimetric finish if the initial ICP-ES results are greater than 300 
ppm and by metallic-screen fire assay if the original over-limit assay is greater than 
80 oz/ton. 

The standard assay package employed consists of fire assay for Au on a 30 g 
sample with an AA finish.  Gold is re-assayed by gravimetric finish if the initial fire 
assay results return values above 7 ppm. A metallic-screen fire assay is performed 
on all samples with the original over-limit assay greater than 7 ppm. 

Preparation for the 33-element suite involves a 0.5 g sample split digested in an 
aqua regia solution containing equal parts HCl, HNO3, and de-ionized H2O before 
analysis by ICP-ES. 

Analysis for Ba is a lithium borate fusion of a 0.2 g sub-sample with analysis by ICP-
ES. 

Since 2008, the on-site laboratory has been used as the primary laboratory for pre-
production and in-stope drill core as well as an umpire laboratory for definition and 
exploration drill core.  The standard assay package employed consists of fire assay 
for Au and Ag, and ICP-ES analysis for Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe.  

11.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) 

11.6.1 Legacy QA/QC 

Previous (pre-2008) operators have used a similar system to the current QA/QC 
methodology.  Legacy assaying protocols are typical of those employed in the mining 
industry and have been described in several reports (MRDI 1998 and 1999; AMEC, 
2005, 2008 and 2013).  The 1998 MRDI report is referenced as the source of pre-
1998 legacy QA/QC procedures by all the subsequent audit reports, with QA/QC of 
drillholes added since 1998 covered by each subsequent report period (see Section 
12 for a description of external reviews on Greens Creek data). 

Standards 

Different standard reference materials (SRMs) were created by the Greens Creek 
Joint Venture (GCJV) to reflect the different mineral types at Greens Creek, and 
successor SRMs were created as the stocks became exhausted.  SRMs were 
prepared at Hazen Research by ball milling to exceed 95% passing a 150-mesh 
screen.  Ten packets of each SRM were submitted to independent commercial 
laboratories to determine the recommended values for controlling quality. 

Standards B, D, F and G were made from Southwest Zone cores.  Standards E and 
H were made from Northwest West and West Zone cores.  Standard I was made 
from mineralized material from a stope in the 200S Zone.  The material was 
submitted to six independent laboratories: Hazen Research, Denver; SVL, Acme, 
Cone Geochemical Laboratories, Lakefield, CO; Rocky Mountain Geochemical 
Laboratories (RMG), and Chemex, Mississauga, Ontario.  Standard H was 
characterized by Acme, CAS, RMG and SVL.  Standard I was submitted to Acme, 
Hazen, SVL, RMG, and two laboratories not previously used: Actlabs, Wheatridge, 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 161  

CO; and SGS, Vancouver, B.C. 

Duplicates 

Duplicate assays were performed at the same laboratory as the original assays and 
were not "blind."  Acme performed assay (same pulp) duplicates and coarse reject 
(second split, second pulp) duplicates on every 10th sample and reported the results 
on the same assay certificate.  Duplicate assay (same pulp) and coarse reject 
duplicates (second split and second pulp) were performed for one in every 20 
samples by the mine site laboratory.  

Check Assays 

Most of the Greens Creek drillholes were included in a check assay program where 
SVL Analytical, formerly Silver Valley Laboratories, of Kellogg, Idaho was the umpire 
laboratory. 

Approximately one in 15 samples were selected for a check assay on the pulp.  The 
checks were selected from intervals logged as massive and white mineral styles in 
approximately equal amounts.  Any interval showing visible gold was also selected 
for check assay. Selected samples were recorded on the sample submission form, 
directing Acme to send a split of the pulp to SVL.  After receiving Acme assay results, 
geologists examined the results for a reasonable match to geologic observation and 
requested additional check assays on samples that reported unreasonably high or 
low values.  

SVL performed a fire assay for Au and Ag using a half-assay ton sample.  SVL 
determined Pb, Zn, and Cu by AA on 1.0 g samples digested in aqua regia.  SVL 
analyzed base metals by AA.  If samples reported above 15 percent Zn or above 20 
percent Pb (as determined by AA), those samples were re-assayed using titration 
methods. 

Acme performed check assays on pulps selected from drillhole samples prepared 
and assayed by the mine site laboratory, using the protocols described above.  The 
practice of submitting pulps for check assay was discontinued for pre-production 
drillholes on April 1, 1998. 

11.6.2 Hecla QA/QC 

Since 2008, Hecla has used two laboratories for drill core assays: the Hecla mine 
site laboratory; and Acme, followed by its successor laboratory, Bureau Veritas (BV), 
in Vancouver, Canada.   Bureau Veritas acquired Acme in 2015 and is currently the 
primary commercial laboratory for Greens Creek.  Batches are controlled by a 
system of SRMs, pulp duplicate samples, coarse reject duplicate samples, and 
check assay submittals.  

Standards 

From 2008 to 2011, standards materials were sourced from underground bulk 
samples or drill core and then prepared and certified by Hazen Research, Inc. of 
Golden, Colorado.  The Hazen Research standards used from 2008 are Standard 
K, Standard L, Standard N, and Standard P; these materials were used until 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 162  

exhausted during the period between 2012 and 2015.   

Beginning in 2011, standards materials were prepared and certified by CDN 
Resource Laboratories Ltd (CDN) of Langley, B.C., Canada.  Additional standards 
have been prepared as needed by CDN through 2018.  A summary of the various 
standards used since 2008 and the material from which they were sourced are 
summarized in Table 11-2.   All reference materials used have certified values for 
Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe.  A more detailed summary of the source, preparing 
company, certificate dates and certificate values for the reference standards used 
are presented in Table 11-3. 

From 2008 to March 2018, one standard was submitted as the 10th sample of each 
drillhole; an additional standard was inserted for every subsequent 20 samples and 
as the last sample for every drillhole.  Beginning in March 2018, one standard is 
submitted as the 10th sample of each drillhole with an additional standard inserted 
for every subsequent 25 samples.   

Standard assay results are reported along with the primary assay results and are 
captured by the acQuire® database during the normal importing routine.  Upon 
receipt, the results for the standards are compared with certified values by the project 
geologist using graphical reports generated by acQuire® database utilities.  From 
2008 to March 2018, analyses for jobs are rejected if one standard per submittal is 
outside of three standard deviations from the certified value, or if two standards per 
submittal are outside of two standard deviations from the certified value.   

Beginning in March 2018, if the running mean on any standard assay over time (5 
sample moving average) exceeds the 2x standard-deviation limits, the batches 
associated to those samples causing the exceedance are re-assayed.  As in the 
previous period, if a single sample exceeds the 3x standard-deviation limits, the 
associated batch is re-assayed.

Rejected jobs are re-assayed for the element or elements that failed.  Control charts 
are generated and reviewed by year; all standards have performed with satisfactory 
accuracy and precision for Au, Ag, Pb, and Zn throughout their use.  An example of 
the statistics and control charts reviewed for Standard T14 for 2018 are presented 
in Table 11-4 and Figure 11-1 for Ag and Au, and Figure 11-2 for Pb and Zn. 

The statistics and controls charts show some variability with a few instances outside 
the 2x standard deviation 'warning limits'.  Most of the data and the overall trends 
are within the acceptance limits for the period indicating acceptable accuracy and 
precision for the metal analyses.

Blanks 

Prior to late 2017, no coarse blank material was used except for BV laboratory's 
internal blanks. To begin a blank program, a minus 1" crushed basalt was purchased 
from the Browns Hill Quarry in North Pole, AK, so that sample preparation and 
analytical processes could be tested.  Starting in October 2017, blanks samples are 
inserted within each mineral intercept with an overall insertion rate of approximately 
1 in 20 samples. The performance limits for this material are being evaluated as the 
analytical database increases.  

For the coarse blank standards, any blank registering more than 3x the assay 
detection limit is reviewed.  If the amount of contamination could contribute 10% or 
more of the metal seen in adjoining samples, the possibly contaminated samples 
are noted to the resource geologist.  Though the contamination may have come 
during the comminution stage, the pulps of the likely contaminated sample are re-
assayed.  Pulp blanks inserted by the lab are also reviewed to determine if the 
contamination is occurring during the analytical stage.  A letter is also sent to the 
preparation lab, notifying them of any contamination.   

Blanks statistics and controls charts for 2018 are presented in Table 11-5 and Figure 
11-3 for Au and Ag, and Figure 11-4 for Pb and Zn. Blanks statistics and controls 
charts show acceptable metal analyses with few warnings and anomalous results 
for the period.  One instance shows anomalous results for Pb and Zn; but no 
significant contamination is interpreted.

Duplicates 

Coarse reject duplicate samples are randomly assigned at a rate of approximately 
one in every 36 samples by BV during the preparation stage of the process.  These 
samples are an extra split from the crushed sample that is then treated as any other 
sample from that stage onward.  Results for these samples are reported by the 
laboratory along with the primary assay results and are captured by the acQuire® 
database during the normal importing routine.  The performance of these duplicates 
has been reviewed during various in-house quarterly and yearly studies and third-
party audits.  

From 2008 to 2015, pulp duplicate samples were randomly assigned at a rate of 
approximately one in every 36 samples and represent the repeat of a specific 
analytical run.  From 2015 to 2017, it appears that many of these duplicates were 
not being analyzed at the site lab; efforts are being made to analyze some of the 
back-log of duplicates.  

The current practice is to create a pulp duplicate for 1 in 20 samples.  These 
duplicate samples are analyzed at BV with 50% of them also being analyzed at the 
Greens Creek Lab.  Results for these samples are reported on the assay sheets and 
are imported into the acQuire® database during the normal importing routine.  The 
performance of these duplicates has been reviewed during various in-house 
quarterly and yearly studies and third-party audits.  Scatterplots for the 2018 pulp 
duplicate data analyzed at BV are presented in Figure 11-5 for Ag and Au, and 
Figure 11-6 for Pb and Zn. The scatterplots show good agreement for Ag, Pb, and 
Zn in the important grade ranges; Au shows some variability.  Additional checking 
for Au is ongoing.

Check Assays 

Samples for check assays are selected by the project geologist at a rate of 
approximately one in forty project samples.  The project geologist assigns this 
designation based on lithology, with preference given to mineralized lithologies.  An 
extra split is taken after pulverizing and returned to the project geologist.  The project 
geologist dispatches a group of check samples to the on-site lab which is used as a 
check laboratory.  Results are imported into the acQuire® database.  The 
performance of these check assays has been reviewed during various in-house 
quarterly and yearly studies and third-party audits. Scatterplots for the 2018 pulp 
check data analyzed at the on-site lab are presented in Figure 11-7 for Ag and Au, 
and Figure 11-8 for Pb and Zn. Overall, the check assays agree satisfactorily with 
the original assays.  There is some higher variance at low grades for all metals, but 
no observable bias.  Further analysis of the check assays from the Greens Creek 
laboratory is ongoing.

11.7 Databases 
Drillhole and production face-sampling data are captured in a SQL database at 
Greens Creek that utilizes acQuire® software.  These data include drillhole collars, 
down-hole surveys, assays and geological descriptions.  Standard database 
management techniques are utilized that limit access and user rights to ensure data 
integrity. The acQuire® system also has many built-in features that restrict data 
import and approvals and perform some data checking.  

A drillhole data set is created for each zone based on geographic limits.  Where 
drilling pierces multiple zones, caution is exercised to be certain that mineralization 
in a drillhole is properly assigned to its appropriate zone. 

Primary original documents, logs, down-hole surveys, core photographs, and assay 
certificates are cataloged and stored on site.  Digital copies are stored on networks 
drives that are routinely backed-up. 

11.8 Drill Core and Sample Chain-of-Custody and Security 
Drill core is transported to the core shed at the end of each drill shift by the drill crews 
and quick-logged each morning by the geology staff.  Core is stored on surface at 
the 860-core shed until it can be logged.  

After logging, core is separated into sampled and unsampled intervals and each is 
placed on a separate pallet. Core Technicians transport the pallets of core to be 
sampled to the underground sampling facility where it is cut or whole-sampled 
depending on the type of hole drilled. Samples are bagged in sturdy cloth bags and 
labeled with barcoded sample tags with a second sample tag in the bag. Bags are 
tied shut with string. Two samples are placed in a rice bag which is labeled with the 
dispatch number and number of that rice bag in the dispatch. A sample submittal 
form and standard samples are included in the first rice bag of the dispatch. Rice 
bags are placed into a supersack with one or more dispatches to fill the sack. All 
samples in each dispatch are kept together in a single super sack and the super 
sacks are labeled with the dispatches inside.  

Supersacks are loaded into a shipping container and, when ready for shipment, a 
shipping manifest is created for the Warehouse and Surface Operations noting the 
container number and the contents. The shipping manifest and digital copies of the 
sample submittals are emailed to the Juneau BV Prep Lab Manager. Surface 
Operations personnel transport the container to the dock at Hawk Inlet and it is 
loaded onto an Alaska Marine Lines (AML) barge. That barge is transported to 
Juneau and the container is delivered to the Juneau Prep lab by AML at which point 
the lab takes possession of the samples.  AML is in possession of the container and 
samples while on the barge and the person receiving the container during delivery 
is recorded by AML. The progress of the container is tracked online from shipping to 
receiving.   

The SRM inventory, returned coarse reject and pulp samples are secured and kept 
in locations with restricted access.  The core is stored within the original boxes in a 
remote underground drift designated as a core archive.

11.9 Comments on Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 
In the QP's opinion, the sample preparation, analyses, and security are acceptable, 
meet industry-standard practice, and are adequate for Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve estimation and mine planning purposes, based on the following: 

• Face sampling covers sufficient area and is adequately spaced to support 
mine planning; 

• Drill sampling is adequately spaced to first define, then infill, base metal 
anomalies to provide prospect-scale and deposit-scale drill data;  

• Since 2008, data have been collected following industry-standard sampling 
protocols (see Section 12 for discussion of third-party reviews); 

• Sample collection and handling of core is undertaken in accordance with 
industry standard practices, with procedures to limit potential sample losses 
and sampling biases; 

• Sample intervals in core, comprising 1 to 5-ft (0.3 to 1.5 m) intervals, are 
considered to adequately represent the true thicknesses of mineralization.  
Not all drill material may be sampled depending on location and alteration; 

• Sample preparation for samples that support Mineral Resource estimation 
has followed a similar procedure since 2008.  The preparation procedure is 
in line with industry-standard methods for polymetallic deposits; 

• Exploration and infill core programs are analyzed by independent 
laboratories using industry-standard methods for gold, silver, lead, zinc, 
copper, iron and barium analyses.  Current run-of-mine sample analyses are 
performed by the mine laboratory; 

• Specific gravity determination procedures are consistent with industry-
standard procedures. There are sufficient acceptable specific gravity 
measurements to support the values utilized in tonnage calculations; 

• Limited information is available on the QA/QC for the pre-1998 drill programs; 
however, sufficient programs of reanalysis have been performed that the 
data can be accepted for use in estimation (refer to Section 12); 

• Typically, drill programs include the insertion of blank, duplicate, and 
standard samples.  The QA/QC program results do not indicate any problems 
with the analytical programs, therefore the analyses from the core drilling are 
suitable for inclusion in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation; 

• Data collected are subject to validation, using in-built program triggers that 
automatically check data upon import to the database; 

• Verification is performed on all digitally-collected data on import to the main 
database, including checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology data, 
and assay data.  The checks are appropriate and consistent with industry 
standards; 

• Sample security relies on the fact that the samples are always attended or 
locked in the on-site logging or sampling facilities. Chain-of-custody 
procedures consist of filling out sample submittal forms that are sent to the 
laboratory with sample shipments and shipment tracking to ensure that all 
samples are received by the laboratory; 

• Current sample storage procedures and storage areas are consistent with 
industry standards.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 External Reviews 
Hecla and the Greens Creek Joint Venture (GCJV) operators have consistently 
involved third-party consultants in database reviews, Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve estimates, and mine audits.  This work is summarized in the following 
subsections, categorized below as 'legacy' (performed for the Greens Creek Joint 
Venture), and 'Hecla' (performed for Hecla after the company became 100% 
owner/operator of the Greens Creek Mine in 2008).   

12.1.1 Legacy Data Review 

Mineral Resource Development Inc., 1997 

A face-sampling study was conducted by Mineral Resource Development, Inc. 
(MRDI) to check for sampling bias, and to determine the level of reproducibility 
obtainable from face sampling, using a modified sample preparation protocol.  
Sample preparation and assay protocols were formulated to provide the analytical 
precision required.   

Mineral Resource Development Inc., 1998 

A review of the 1994 Southwest Feasibility Study (1994 FS) block models and their 
reconciliation to production for the Southwest Zone was undertaken.  

Principal conclusions were: 

• The mineral zones in the Southwest Zone have been deformed by multiple 
events, to the extent that they can no longer be considered stratiform. 

• Overall, the 1994 FS model grade and tonnage have been confirmed by 
production (1997), with the exception of silver, which had been of lower grade 
than predicted. 

• The 1994 FS model is very inaccurate in terms of predicting the locations 
and grades of mineral types.  

• There was a significant amount of over-break and ore loss (particularly high 
silver zones) which resulted in a higher tonnage at a lower grade reaching 
the mill than was predicted by grade-control data.  To some extent this over-
break was desirable, as the value of high-grade material in the structurally 
complicated Southwest Zone exceeds the cost of dilution, i.e., it is important 
to take some dilution to ensure as much as possible of the ore is recovered. 

In June 1998, MRDI was contracted to assist in the preparation of mineral resource 
models for the three zones that were considered to be major contributors to the five-
year production schedule.  The Southwest, Northwest West and 200 South zones 
were selected for this work.  Greens Creek staff prepared all the geologic 
interpretations and worked under the direction of Dr. Harry Parker to develop 
appropriate modeling techniques including capping for gold and silver grades, 
composite length studies, and appropriate model estimation parameters model. 

Review of the data collection and acquisition procedures showed that it followed 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 180  

industry-standard practices for sampling, assaying, quality-control, and data entry 
and management. The interpreted mineralization envelopes were reasonable for the 
Southwest and 200 South zones. Concerns were expressed with the Northwest 
West model because the mixture of large, base metal, low-grade areas of white 
carbonate mineral style with more massive, base metal-rich material could result in 
the over-projection of gold, lead, and zinc grades from composites of base metal-
rich massive mineralization, and of silver grades from white carbonate mineral type. 
This 1998 work has formed the basis for all subsequent modeling techniques up to 
2018. 

Mineral Resource Development Inc., 1999 

A review was completed on the 5250 Zone model and mineral resource estimate 
reported in February 1999.  The model was found acceptable for the purposes of 
reporting Mineral Resource estimates for the zone.  Similar reviews were performed 
on the Southwest, Northwest West and 200S Zone models and estimates.  The 
database was found to be acceptable for use in Mineral Resource estimation, and 
the resulting estimates were considered adequate for all three zones.  

Recommendations relating to modeling and estimation focused on timely QA/QC 
reviews, data entry and data validation, and appropriate data archiving. 

A review of the 1999 operating plan was performed in December 1999 on behalf of 
Standard Bank London Limited in support of the Project acquisition by Hecla and 
Pan American Silver Corporation.  The operating plan was found to represent an 
appropriate response to the ongoing development of the Greens Creek operation, 
and the assumptions in the proposed operating and development plan were 
considered to be reasonable.  A recommendation was made that documentation 
supporting mine plans should be collated. 

AMEC, 2002 

In October 2002, AMEC, the successor company to MRDI, audited the model for the 
Central Zone.  The evaluation compared the updated 2001 block model with that of 
the block model completed in 2000 and determined that a new model would be 
required.  Recommendations were made in relation to modeling methods and 
reconciliation evaluations. 

A Mineral Resource/Mineral Reserve audit was performed in December 2002 on the 
2002 estimates to review supporting data, mineral resource estimates, mine designs 
and mineral reserve estimates to give an assessment of the reasonableness of the 
mine mineral reserve statement.  The emphasis of the audit was on the 9A, Central 
West, 5250, Southwest Bench and Deep Southwest zones.  Reviews of mine 
designs were conducted for the East, 200 South, Southwest and Northwest West 
zone deposits.  The independent review confirmed the 2002 Mineral 
Resource/Mineral Reserve statement.   

A number of recommendations were made to address the areas of QA/QC 
management, consistent reproducibility of Au values at Acme, provision of 
documentation in relation to Mineral Resource/Mineral Reserve conversion 
procedures and supporting information and, establishment of grade control

March 2019 181  

procedures in areas mined by long-hole methods.   

AMEC, 2003 

The Greens Creek Joint Venture produced new mineral resource models in 2003.  
AMEC reviewed changes and assisted in the completion of new models or model 
updates for two mineral zones, the 9A and Northwest West zones.  In addition, 
AMEC reviewed the conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves for the 
Northwest West Zone.  

Drilling, sampling, sample preparation and assaying methods were considered to 
meet or exceed industry standard practice and results were considered adequate to 
support Mineral Resource estimates.  Density measurements were adequate to 
support tonnage estimates.  Minor errors with the down-hole survey data were not 
considered to affect estimates and could be remediated.  The assay database 
showed an acceptable low error rate.  Mineral Resource estimates for the 9A and 
Northwest West zones were accepted as reasonable.  Conversion of the Mineral 
Resources at the Northwest West Zone to Mineral Reserves was considered to use 
appropriate modifying factors and the mine plan was achievable in the time-frame 
contemplated. 

Recommendations included change of support analysis for Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources, and evaluation and quantification of dilution percentages to be 
expected by stope during mining activities. 

AMEC, 2005 

AMEC reviewed supporting data, mineral resource estimates, mine designs and 
Mineral Reserve estimates to give an assessment of the reasonableness of the 
Mineral Reserve statement for 2005.  The deposits reviewed were Northwest West, 
5250, Southwest Bench and 200S zones.   

AMEC found the error rate for the lithology, sampled intervals, assays, and down-
hole surveys to be acceptable, and considered the database acceptable for use in 
Mineral Resource estimation.  Assay quality was controlled by a consistently applied 
system of standard reference materials (SRMs), pulp duplicate samples, coarse 
reject duplicate samples, and check assays.  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates were considered to be appropriately estimated. 

Recommendations included: updating the database with missing Ba and ICP 
assays; checks of the methods whereby down-hole survey data are uploaded; 
review of potential assay bias at Acme for Ag and Pb; review of density values 
assigned to high-Ba material; and quantification of dilution percentages to be 
expected by stope during drift and fill, primary long-hole, and secondary long-hole 
mining activities. 

12.1.2 Hecla Database and Verification 

AMEC, 2008 

In 2008, AMEC audited the databases, data transfer, and data storage procedures 
for the 5250N, Northwest West and Gallagher zones.  No significant errors that 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 182  

would preclude Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates were noted. A 
number of recommendations were made to address program improvements and to 
implement incremental checks and additional validation steps in the data collection, 
QA/QC verification, modeling and estimation processes.   

AMEC found the error rate for lithology codes within the mineral zones, sampled 
intervals, and assays in the Greens Creek databases to be acceptable to support 
Mineral Resource estimation for the Gallagher and 5250N zones, but found the error 
rate close to 1% for lithology and greater than 1% for assays in the Northwest West 
Zone.  AMEC was unable to determine the precision of Au, Ag, Pb and Zn assays.   

Key recommendations included: integration of the QA/QC data into the site acQuire 
database; reviewing of inconsistencies in Ba and ICP data; procedures to ensure 
that errors identified with the database during the Datamine® modeling could be 
updated in acQuire®; review of potential high biases in Pb and Ag results at Acme; 
implementation of incremental checks and additional validation steps in the data 
collection and model completion process, and; checks on the amount of contact 
dilution allowed for in the models.   

AMEC also audited the Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource statement.  Scope 
items included auditing the database and review of supporting data, mineral 
resource estimates, mine designs, and mineral reserve estimates to give an 
assessment of the reasonableness of the Mineral Reserve statement for 2007.  
Mineral Resource estimates for the 5250N and Gallagher zones were reviewed, 
Mineral Reserve estimates were reviewed for Northwest West and 5250N zones, 
and the database was audited for all three zones.   

AMEC, 2009 

AMEC was requested to provide technical assistance with auditing the Project 
database and building of wireframe models for five zones (the Northwest-West, 
Upper Plate, Northwest-West South, 200 South-Deep, and Gallagher zones) and 
the old mining area of East Zone.  The database audit was only partially completed, 
as only a portion of the QA/QC files were available at the time of the audit.  Wire-
frame modeling of the East Zone was also only partially completed due to time 
constraints. 

Recommendations from this work included identifying and filing documentation of 
historic drill logs and collar details, maintenance of QA/QC data to facilitate data 
verification, validation of collar locations, review of East Zone survey measurements 
after magnetic declination is applied, modification of sampling protocols so that 
mineralization in non-traditional mineral lithologies is assayed, and improvement of 
database storage and import procedures between the acQuire® database and the 
Datamine® modeling and estimation software.   

AMEC performed a review of the 2009 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for 
5250 and 9A zones, including reviews of supporting data, Mineral Resource 
estimates, mine designs, and Mineral Reserve estimates.   

AMEC found the error rate for the lithology, sampled intervals, assays and down-
hole surveys to be acceptable and considered the database acceptable for use in 
mineral resource estimation.  Assay quality was controlled by a consistently-applied

system of SRMs, pulp duplicate samples, coarse reject duplicate samples, and 
check assays.  AMEC did not find a fatal flaw in mine operations, planning, 
scheduling, or budgeting that would prevent Hecla from executing their plans to mine 
the 5250 and 9A Mineral Reserves. 

Recommendations arising from the audit included notations relating to inclusion of 
Ba and "over-limit" samples for Zn in the database, investigation of potential assay 
biases at Acme and the mine laboratory, continued recommendations for real-time 
QA/QC monitoring, density assignments for white barite ore, and reconciliation. 

AMEC, 2012 - 2013 

AMEC was requested to conduct a review of Hecla's 2011 Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves for the Deep 200 South, Southwest Bench, East Zone, and 
Gallagher zones in early 2012.  This report was finished and received in September 
2014. 

AMEC found that the definition of the domains was done using applicable and 
reasonable parameters, care, and execution.  Grade capping and compositing was 
found to be reasonable, and variography was adequately executed.  Estimation 
plans were found to be adequate, and AMEC agreed with the mineral resource 
classification methods applied. 

The mining review focused on the Southwest Bench Zone, as mining was active in 
this zone.  AMEC did not find any fatal flaws in mine operations, planning, 
scheduling, or budgeting that would prevent Hecla from executing its plans to mine 
the Southwest Bench Mineral Reserve.  Reconciliation between actual mined and 
model depletion showed significant variation and required addressing.  Regular 
geotechnical reviews were recommended as mining advances.  The development 
plan and equipment were considered appropriate for the Southwest Bench Zone.   

Recommendations arising from the audit included compiling more formal 
documentation for mineral resource model reports for each mineralized zone; 
improving mineral resource model archiving procedures; investigating more 
comprehensive variography procedures, including locally varying anisotropy; 
tracking each mining area by tons produced by mining method, and capturing those 
volumes mined for the depletion model; generating a detailed ventilation model that 
shows areas by equipment used to improve the effectiveness of the total allotted 
airflows; creating an equipment maintenance schedule that showed the equipment 
purchase, rebuild, breakdowns, and planned maintenance schedule by maintenance 
bay and the personnel allotted to each in order to enable a more proactive approach 
to maintenance; production histories were recommended to be kept for each mining 
block; and production forecasts were recommended to include appropriate dilution 
and recovery. 

AMEC FOSTER WHEELER, 2016 

Hecla Greens Creek Mining Company (HGCMC) commissioned Amec Foster 
Wheeler to review the Mineral Resource models constructed by HGCMC in 2016 for 
the NWW Zone (NWW) and the 5250 Zone (5250). This review included a site visit 
the HGCMC offices in Juneau, AK from 31 October to 4 November 2016. During the 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 184  

site visit, the construction of the mineral resource model was discussed and 
reviewed with HGCMC staff. 

The project scope was to review the Mineral Resource models for the NWW 
(effective date 26 July 2016) and 5250 (effective date 14 July 2016) mineral zones. 
A review of the database was not included in the scope of work and Amec Foster 
Wheeler did not audit the database. 

Amec Foster Wheeler found no significant errors in the Mineral Resource modeling 
methodology and found that model validations supported the grade estimates.  
Recommendations included better documentation of procedures and production of 
a final written report documenting the data used, data analysis, model construction, 
grade estimation methods and tabulation of the mineral resources.  Alternative 
methods for estimating density and a modified mineral resource classification 
method to remove unrealistic isolated blocks were also recommended.  Amec Foster 
Wheeler also suggested the inclusion of a complete set of cross-sections for each 
metal be archived with the models. 

ROSCOE POSTLE ASSOCIATES, 2017 

Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained in 2017 by Hecla Mining 
Company to complete a Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve audit of Hecla's 
Greens Creek Mine to be used for internal purposes. At Hecla's request, RPA's audit 
focused on two of the nine mining zones, the 200 Deep South (200S) and Northwest 
West (NWW) zones. These zones contain approximately 50% of the Greens Creek 
Mineral Reserves. 

RPA did not find any major issues in the Mineral Resource modeling methodologies 
but made many recommendations.  The main recommendation was a modification 
to the workflow for the mineral selection/interpretation criteria to provide a more 
accurate reflection of the potentially economic mineralization and to be more flexible 
in responding to variations in metal prices and operating costs.  To that end, RPA 
recommended that the NSR value using the Mineral Resource price deck be used 
to discriminate the potentially economic mineralization.  Where possible, the mineral 
zone interpretation should also incorporate the detailed grade control mapping and 
sampling information.   In 2017 and 2018, a new workflow was developed by the 
mine geology staff for mineral zone interpretation based on these recommendations.  
Testing and modifications of the workflow are ongoing. 

Other recommendations made by RPA included updating the mineral resource 
classification scheme to eliminate artifacts from the model re-blocking process and 
to improve the accounting procedure for mined volumes. Minor recommendations 
focused on dilution grades, mining recovery for longhole stopes, and mining 
depletion. 

Finally, RPA recommended that a set of Standard Operating Procedures be 
prepared that describe each of the steps in the preparation of the Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserve statements and include a formal peer review process and sign-
off procedure to ensure that each step of the workflow is completed in a consistent 
and proper manner.  All of RPA's recommendations have been implemented or are 
in the process of being implemented.

12.2 Internal Reviews 
Until 2006, all geological data were stored in an Ingres database.  This became 
corrupted, but extraction of most files was possible.  A period of about two years 
followed where the database consisted of a number of Microsoft Access® databases.  
In 2007 acQuire® software was purchased, and over the following three years, all 
data were transferred to the database.  All drillhole assay data was reloaded from 
the original electronic assay files.  All data were checked during the transfer process. 

A standard set of referential integrity 'logic' checks are applied to the data as they 
are entered into the acQuire® database.  These checks include checking for 
overlapping or gaps in intervals, validation of lithologic codes against lookup tables, 
and enforcement of unique records for sample numbers and drillhole names. 

As data are extracted from the acQuire® database and brought into Datamine® for 
modeling, a second set of validation checks are performed.  These checks include 
flagging drillholes with missing survey data, checking for overlapping intervals or 
gaps, lithologic code validation, flagging drillholes with anomalous calculated 
angular deviations, flagging sampled intervals that are missing assays or have 
returned values greater than the detection limit.  Where errors are noted, the 
problems are corrected prior to the database being used for mineral resource 
estimation purposes. 

acQuire Database Health Check 

In early 2018, acQuire Software Pty Ltd was retained to perform a health check for 
the Greens Creek acQuire® database.  A thorough review was requested to identify 
potential issues with the data, databases, and workspaces, and to recommend 
possible repair options and improvements. The database backups and acQuire® 
workspaces used for the health check were effective March 14, 2018. 

This detailed review of the databases and workspaces found no serious issues that 
significantly impact database contents or integrity.  Areas were identified where 
systems could be enhanced, cleaned up, or streamlined.  The key recommendations 
for improving the existing system dealt with training of new users, database issues 
with missing, duplicate, or unnecessary fields, and upgrades to the acQuire® 
program and SQL Server maintenance and backups.  Project personnel are working 
through the recommendations on the database issues. 

12.3 Comments on Data Verification 
The process of data verification for the Project has been performed by external 
consultant firms from 1997 to 2013, as well as by Hecla personnel.  Since 2013, all 
data verification has been done by project staff as the data are being collected and 
imported into the acQuire® database.  The 2018 check on the acQuire® databases 
and workspaces found no serious deficiencies.  

Hecla considers that a reasonable level of verification is completed, and that no 
material issues would have been left unidentified from the programs undertaken. 
External reviews of the database have been undertaken in support of acquisitions, 
support of feasibility-level studies, and in support of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve estimates, producing independent assessments of the database quality.

No significant problems with the database, sampling protocols, analytical flow 
sheets, check analysis program, or data storage were noted.  Drill data are verified 
prior to Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation using various automated 
and manual checks. 

The QP is of the opinion that the data verification programs undertaken on the data 
collected from the Project adequately support the geological interpretations, validate 
the analytical and database quality, and support the use of the data in Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and in mine planning. No significant 
sample biases were identified from the QA/QC programs undertaken (see Section 
11), and sample data collected adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of 
mineralization, and the style of the deposit.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Metallurgical Test Work 
Since mill construction and startup, numerous internal and external studies have 
been performed to investigate metallurgical issues and support mill modifications. 
Many of these are listed in Table 13-1. 

Extensive initial test work programs were conducted at Noranda's Matagami Lake 
and Mattabi laboratories in Ontario, and at Dawson Metallurgical Laboratory in Salt 
Lake City, UT, as compiled and summarized by Banning (1983). Composites of 
various mineral types were developed using drill core samples. Results of these 
programs allowed the development of the basic Greens Creek lead-zinc flotation 
flowsheet, with inclusion of a gravity gold circuit. Primary grinding requirements for 
the white mineral types and massive sulfide types were developed and use of stage 
addition for flotation reagents was established, along with collector and modifier 
recommendations. These programs demonstrated the desirability of a preliminary 
carbon removal pre-flotation step and re-grinding of rougher concentrates prior to 
cleaner flotation. 

Following mill start-up, investigations were pursued regarding alternatives to the 
originally installed plane table used for gravity recovery of relatively coarse free gold. 
The plane tables had proved to be labor intensive and did not perform up to 
expectations. Screening trials indicated that available centrifugal gravity 
concentrators would create water balance issues and that gravity spiral 
concentrators had better performance. They also indicated that re-grinding of spirals 
concentrate prior to final cleaning with a shaking table improved product grades 
significantly. Plant trials with spirals confirmed the screening results and a revised 
gravity circuit utilizing concentrating spirals, concentrate re-grinding and final tabling 
was implemented (Sawyer, 1997). 

Mill expansion by way of construction of a new building primarily devoted to cleaner 
flotation circuits also allowed reallocation of existing equipment and floor space in 
the original mill building. Bench scale test work followed by plant trials in 1999–2000 
produced results used to develop modifications to the mill flowsheet, size and specify 
required equipment and analyze economic consequences of the expansion. 
Resulting concentrate assay improvements, improved recoveries and economically 
favorable redistribution of payable metals among the various concentrates indicated 
overall recovery improvements of 2% for lead, 8% for zinc, 1.5% for silver and 2% 
for gold. 

Several formal and informal studies have been performed during the life of Greens 
Creek which investigated causes of poor mill recoveries. Two examples are an 
exhaustive 2007 study (Reynolds, 2007), which examined a variety of mineral types 
and mill products, and a more focused 2009 study, which examined mill feeds 
producing particularly low recoveries, as well as examining more typical feeds for 
comparison (Blake, 2009). Both studies considered analytical and classic 
mineralogical results as well as SEM and other instrumental approaches. Both 
studies concluded that the principal cause of poor flotation recoveries was the 
presence of extremely fine-grained minerals and intergrowths that cannot be 
economically liberated by grinding.

The performance of the grinding circuit was reviewed in 2003 as part of planning for 
a contemplated increase in throughput. Findings included Bond Work Index values 
ranging from 11.9 to 12.8 kWh/st, feed specific gravities ranging from 3.5 to 4.0 and 
Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) abrasion parameter (ta) 
values ranging from 0.51 to 0.88. Bond Index values referenced from a 1993 pilot 
plant ranged from 10.5 to 10.7 (Jankovic, 2003). 

The grind circuit and flotation circuit performance were monitored daily using an on-
site SEM for over a year through 2013.  This data showed that much of the lead and 
silver could be collected using the second carbon column.  The routing of the second 
carbon column was adjusted so the concentrate could be directed to the overall lead 
concentrate and allow for much of the lead and silver to be "scalped" off without the 
risk of recovery losses downstream.  This resulted in an increase to the silver 
recovery of nearly 5% starting in September 2014. 

Successful metallurgical testing was conducted on using carbon dioxide for pH 
control beginning in 2012 and implemented in the plant in early 2015.  This resulted 
in roughly a 2% increase in silver recovery, a 5% increase in lead recovery, and a 
3% increase in gold recovery. 

Plant trial testing conducted throughout 2014 and into 2015 on an additional cleaning 
stage of gravity concentrating spiral in the gravity circuit has shown that a gold 
concentrate product could be made without the need for additional regrind and 
shaking table and then sent off-site for further processing eliminating the need for a 
doré furnace as well.  A third stage cleaner spiral was installed and implemented in 
the second half of 2015 and has resulted in a roughly 1% increase of gold recovery 
to gravity concentrate and has also eliminated the need for operation of a regrind 
mill and shaking table or the further processing of gold concentrate into doré. 

On-site plant trial testing in 2016 on the use of Woodgrove SFR flotation cells 
showed better separation of zinc from iron in the swing cell and bulk circuit.  This 
was implemented in 2017 to improve zinc distribution to zinc concentrate and 
improve silver distribution to bulk concentrate. 

Metallurgical testing programs are continually conducted to evaluate possible 
changes in feed types from new mining areas, proposed changes in processing to 
improve recoveries and/or concentrate grades and to investigate factors causing 
lower than desired recoveries and concentrate grades. Some examples of such 
recent and current work include: 

• Installation of FloatForce flotation agitators (2016-present); 
• Investigation of vibratory mills for use in regrind stage (2018); 
• Investigation into alternative collector and promoter reagents (2017-2018).

13.2 Recovery Estimates 

13.2.1 History 

Figure 13-1 shows the change in throughput rate from 1989 through 2018. 

Figure 13-1: Incremental Throughput Improvements, 1989 through 2018 

 
 

Production improvement efforts from commissioning through 2004 were centered 
mainly on increasing tonnage capabilities through the mill. This was a successful 
effort focused mainly in the grinding circuit and required minimal capital 
expenditures. 

The cleaner expansion in 2000 was the first major capital project and was required 
to maintain the metallurgical performance at the increased throughput. Flotation 
capacity remained a significant issue and the cleaner circuits were again expanded 
in 2001 to help maintain metallurgical performance. In 2007, the lead rougher circuit 
capacity was expanded by 17% by adding two tank cells to the circuit. 

13.2.2 Flotation Strategy Advancement 

The mill was originally designed to skim off a small amount of high-grade lead 
concentrate and then make a small amount of high-grade zinc concentrate. The 
remaining flotation concentrates were directed to a bulk sulfide concentrate. This 
strategy was effective because of the payment terms of the smelter contracts. 

Efforts were made to maximize NSR by adjusting distributions and recoveries of the 
payable metals.  Increasing lead concentrate production was the major goal in these 
efforts due to the more favorable payment terms for metals in this concentrate. The 
grade of the lead concentrate was allowed to drop in conjunction with increased lead 
and silver recovery to this concentrate.

In 2004, the market for bulk concentrate was very tight due to the closure of several 
ISF plants. This forced a change in flotation strategy to prevent making large 
quantities of bulk concentrate with limited marketability. Several flow changes in the 
mill enabled these changes to be effective. The lead concentrate grade targets were 
considerably reduced which increased lead concentrate quantities. The zinc targets 
remained constant and the additional throughput resulted in more zinc concentrate 
production. The bulk production was significantly reduced to match market 
conditions. The change in strategy was necessary and recovery losses were 
minimized but evident. 

In 2018, smelter terms improved and resulted in partial payment of lead in zinc 
concentrate and zinc in lead concentrate. This resulted in large increases of 
recoveries for lead and zinc to a payable concentrate. Depending on smelter market 
conditions, treatment terms and conditions are expected to vary and may impact 
payable metals recoveries and payout. 

Figures 13-2 to 13-5 show the changes in concentrate production and throughput 
over time. The distributions of recovered silver and gold into the gravity products and 
concentrates are shown in Figures 13-6 and 13-7. Figure 13-8 shows the distribution 
of recovered zinc and lead into the respective lead, zinc and bulk concentrates.  

Note that lead and zinc tonnage increased from 1989 to 2003 as the payables from 
bulk concentrate sales became less favorable due to smelter market conditions as 
well as process and plant improvements made by Greens Creek. Lead concentrate 
grades slightly decreased over time due to favorable smelter terms allowing lower 
concentrate grades that resulted in higher lead recoveries.  For similar reasons, but 
more dramatically, the zinc concentrate grades were significantly reduced with 
attendant recovery increases.  After initial years of high zinc grades, the ability to 
lower the zinc concentrate grades resulted in higher zinc recoveries to the zinc 
concentrate; thereby, decreasing zinc recovery to the bulk concentrate. The net 
effects on lead and zinc distributions to the respective primary concentrates to bulk 
concentrate are shown in Figures 13-4 and 13-5.

13.2.3 Optimization and NSR Estimation 

The initial flotation model was developed using detailed plant surveys and laboratory 
flotation testing with the help of JKTech. Model development also required 
measuring various flotation cell parameters throughout the mill and incorporating the 
data into the model. A base case model was developed from this survey and 
research data using JKSimFloat. The base model was adjusted to match the actual 
plant distributions and recoveries. This adjusted simulation became the primary 
flotation performance model used to predict the flotation response of any set of feed 
grade combinations which is the data provided by mine planning based on the 
mineral blocks to be mined under the mine plan. 

Each set of flotation performance data produced by the JKSimFloat performance 
model is transferred into an optimization model for calculating NSR. The optimization 
model is a custom metallurgical balance program developed at Greens Creek with 
the help of JKTech and now Mincom. This model allows constraints on concentrate 
specifications to be entered and adjusts distributions and recoveries to meet these 
constraints while using smelter contract data and metal prices to calculate the 
expected NSR from flotation concentrates. 

The JKSimFloat/Optimizer modeling is too cumbersome to use directly in the Mineral 
Reserve estimation process due to the large number of blocks requiring NSR 
estimates. A simplified multiple linear regression equation was developed using data 
developed from the optimized NSR modeling as follows: 

 

Flotation NSR = (0.1347*(Au oz/ton)*(Au $/oz))+(0.6942*(Ag oz/ton)*(Ag $/oz))+ 
(18.65*(%Pb)*(Pb $/lb))+(9.137*(%Zn)*(Zn $/lb))

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 196  

 
Au oz/ton, Ag oz/ton, %Pb and %Zn are head grades provided by mine planning. 

This equation only accounts for NSR from flotation. To get the NSR from gravity 
products, the amount of gold recovered in the gravity circuit was compared to the 
amount of gold in the feed over a 2-year period (January 2001 to December 2010) 
and a simple equation was built to calculate the amount of gold that will go to the 
gravity products from the grade of gold in the feed. The NSR for the gravity circuit is 
the product of the amount of gold in the gravity product, the price of gold, and the 
percentage of payout for gold in the gravity products as follows: 

 

Gravity NSR = (0.2465*(Au oz/ton)-0.0065)* (Au$/oz)*0.9289; 

Total NSR = (Flotation NSR) + (Gravity NSR) 

13.2.4 Projected Life-of-Mine (LOM) Recoveries 

 
Life-of-mine (LOM) projected recovery figures are as summarized in Table 13-2.

13.3 Metallurgical Variability 
Samples selected for metallurgical testing during feasibility and development studies 
were representative of the various types and styles of mineralization within the 
different deposits. Samples were selected from a range of locations within the 
deposit zones. Sufficient sized samples were collected to ensure testing integrity. 

13.3.1 Mill Feed Variability 

The Greens Creek Mine produces several mineral types differing in terms of 
mineralogy, mineral grain size and metals grades. Dilution rock types are also 
variable, with backfill from prior mining cycles typically being present in mill feed as 
well. No practical means of selective mining or stockpiling exists, as more than one 
mineralization type commonly is found even in a single working face and day-to-day 
production from multiple working places is necessary. Blending at the mill stockpile 
is utilized to maintain reasonably consistent mill feed over periods of a few days. 

Mill control is largely based on process stream assays, as determined by on-line 
analyzers of these streams. Mill metals feed grades have an influence on recoveries, 
while gold and silver feed grades influence the precious metals grades of 
concentrates. Recoveries in the future are expected to be like those observed 
currently and experienced in past years.

13.3.2 Backfill Materials in Mill Feed 

Backfill materials can be incorporated in the mill feed as diluting material mined in 
those portions of active stopes that are in direct contact with previous mining areas. 
Once in the process plant, the backfill can raise flotation circuit pH levels, which can 
affect mill recoveries.  Currently, Hecla manages fluctuating pH levels using carbon 
dioxide as a result of several studies completed (e.g. Asarte, 2011; Peterson, 2012; 
Tahija, 2012), and work remains ongoing to improve circuit performance on feed 
containing backfill. 

13.3.3 Testwork Composite 

In early 2011, the properties of average mill feed for 2012 to 2016 were estimated, 
in conjunction with geologic staff, on the basis of four major mineral types and 
average grades for each mineral type. During the summer and fall of 2011, mine 
geologists alerted the mill metallurgy staff when each mineral type would be 
available. Large samples of actual blasted and loaded mine muck produced from 
these faces were sampled to ensure that the sample would contain production-level 
amounts of dilution rock and backfill (Tahija, Large sample description, 2011). 

Once adequate quantities of material representing each mineral type were collected, 
the sample lots were shipped to a firm specializing in crushing, blending and splitting 
large mineral composites. A large composite weighing approximately 1,700 pounds 
was prepared using a blending recipe, as directed by Hecla metallurgical staff, and 
split into smaller lots for ease in use (Phillips, 2011). These small lots, as well as 
leftover lots of the individual mineral types are held in refrigerated storage for use as 
needed in future metallurgical testing programs. 

13.4 Deleterious Elements 
The presence of the potentially deleterious elements arsenic, mercury and antimony 
was noted during initial testing (Banning, 1983). These elements are extremely 
difficult to separate due to the typical modes of occurrence; which are intergrowths 
or interstitial. Over the course of production and marketing, deleterious elements 
upon which customers have set limits include: 

• Arsenic, mercury and antimony in lead concentrates; 
• Magnesium, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in zinc concentrates; 
• Magnesium, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in bulk concentrates. 

Penalties charges have been applied against some shipments from time to time, 
most commonly for arsenic and mercury content. Other potential deleterious 
elements have been identified in geological and concentrate analyses; including 
selenium, fluorine, and thallium.  These have not been present in high 
concentrations; overall these have not been and are not expected to be a significant 
issue from a concentrate sale standpoint.

13.5 Comments on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Industry-standard studies were performed as part of process development and initial 
Greens Creek mill design. Subsequent production experience and focused 
investigations, as well as marketing requirements, have guided mill expansions and 
process changes. 

Test work programs, both internal and external, continue to be performed to support 
current operations and potential improvements. 

The QP has reviewed the information compiled by Hecla, as summarized in Section 
13, and has performed a review of the reconciliation data available to verify the 
information used in the LOM plan. Based on these checks, in the opinion of the QP, 
the metallurgical test work and reconciliation and production data support LOM 
planning: 

• Industry standard and appropriate metallurgical testing procedures 
consistent for the deposit's mineralogy have been consistently used by 
Greens Creek staff for optimizing and improving mill process capabilities and 
performance; 

• Numerous external and internal studies have been conducted from feasibility 
studies to the date of this report which have been used to develop and 
optimize the existing flowsheet; 

• The mineral samples used in the test work are considered representative of 
mill feed mineral types across the deposit and the mill has cold stored larger 
standard samples of several of the major mineral types for future 
metallurgical investigations;   

• LOM projections are based on production results and informed by 
metallurgical test data that is updated in the model forecasts each year; 

• Mill metallurgical results and forecasts are consistent with the deposit 
mineralization and wide range of mineralogy present for the process circuit 
used.  

• Metallurgical and production models were developed from metallurgical 
sampling and testing which is adjusted annually to account for process and 
metallurgical improvements and changes.  The methodologies, process and 
data used in making recovery projections are unbiased and provide sound 
projections; 

• Plant recovery variability is expected on a day-to-day basis depending on 
mineral types and combinations of mineral types being processed and actual 
mill operating conditions, but these variations are expected to trend to the 
LOM forecast on monthly or longer reporting period bases.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Summary of Estimation Methodology 
Due to variations in mineralization, structural complexity, and spatial location, the 
Greens Creek ore bodies are segregated into nine unique model zones for both 
mineral resource modeling and mine planning purposes. 

Table 14-1 provides an overview of the database closeout date and other cut-off 
dates pertinent to model construction. Table 14-2 gives an overview of the modeling 
parameters, and interpolation methods for the separate zone models currently in use 
at Greens Creek. 

Drillhole intercepts are uniquely coded to each zone; however, a single drillhole may 
pierce multiple zones. Block size is determined by selecting a block small enough to 
honor the geometry of the mineralized zone as well as being a multiple of the 
expected SMU which is 10 ft x 10 ft x 15 ft (3 m x 3 m x 4.6 m) in x, y and z axes, 
respectively. 

The coordinate system used for mineral resource modeling is the local geologic grid 
(geo-grid). The coordinate systems used at Greens Creek, and transform properties 
are discussed in Section 9.1. 

Mineralized envelopes for seven out of nine zones were built using Leapfrog Geo 
software. The remaining zones were constructed utilizing Hexagon's Minesight 
software. All drillhole processing, compositing, and modeling utilize Datamine® 
macros for control. 

The 2018 Mineral Resource estimates were reviewed by Mr. Paul Jensen, Chief 
Geologist, and Mr. Alexander Winant, Resource Geologist, for Hecla Greens Creek 
Mining Company. Estimates were prepared with reference to the Canadian Institute 
of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards (2014) and CIM Best 
Practice Guidelines (2003). The Qualified Person responsible for the estimates is 
Mr. Paul Jensen, CPG, a Hecla employee.

14.2 Geological Models 
Hecla Greens Creek geologists construct mineralized envelopes which define the 
extent (and tons) of the zones. These envelopes are constructed using implicit 
modelling techniques while viewing data in three dimensions, using a combination 
of ore lithologies, assay grades, and a review of structural continuity. 

A net smelter revenue (NSR) of USD $50 forms the basis for interpretation, which is 
guided by the phyllite/argillite contact (Mine Contact). NSR is calculated using 
predetermined metal prices multiplied by the metal grades of zinc, silver, gold, and 
lead.  

Typically, non-mineralized units such as phyllite and argillite are assayed if they are 
mineralized with visually recognizable sulfides and are near the contacts with the 
massive/white sulfide mineral zones (see Section 11 for more information on current 
sampling practice). Un-assayed samples are assigned a default grade of zero for all 
elements. 

Three sets of wireframes are created for each zone: a $50 NSR shell, a $140 NSR 
shell, and a ten-foot waste shell surrounding the $50 NSR shell. Grade composites 
were built in order to assist in the interpretation of the $50 NSR shell, where samples 
are grouped (composited) and averaged continuously until the average NSR drops 
below $50. These composites are built using the following parameters: 

• Minimum thickness of composite is 10 feet, unless high grade assays have 
enough metal content to mine the face economically. 

• Internal waste may not be longer than 7 feet. 
• Internal waste will make the composite if adjacent material on either side can 

average to the specified cut-off. 
 

Wireframes are snapped to the grade composites, and also snapped to face 
samples that are assayed during the mining process.  

Within the $50 NSR shell, $140 NSR wireframes are created using a special 
interpolation process available in Leapfrog called FastRBF (radial basis function). 
Specifically, face samples and 5-foot composites created from raw drillhole assay 
files are interpolated using an indicator RBF function to create the $140 shell strictly 
within the $50 shell. The RBF function utilizes the structural forms defined for the 
$50 NSR shell to give similar form to the $140 shell.  A resource geologist then 
reviews and adjusts the result for proper volume and geologic continuity. 

For grade estimation purposes, all boundaries between zones, structural domains, 
and NSR zones are considered hard (samples are not shared between domains). 
Composite samples are coded by NSR shell, with samples from each zone used in 
separate interpolation runs. 

To better model thinner zones that are smaller than the minimum stope design, the 
waste shell is constructed around mineralized material to estimate dilution that may 
be included during stope designs. Perimeters for the waste model are created by 
expanding the $50 NSR wireframes 10 feet from all boundaries. This waste shell is 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 202  

used to create waste blocks and flag samples to be used for interpolation into these 
blocks. 

Seven models were updated for the end of year (EOY, refers to work used to 
complete December 31 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates and mine 
plans) 2018: 9A, SWB, East, West, 200S, Gallagher, and Upper Plate zones.  The 
NWW and 5250 Zone wireframes have not been updated since EOY 2017 and EOY 
2016, respectively. 

14.2.1 East Zone 

The East Zone is bounded by the Klaus Fault at lower elevations and the Maki Fault 
to the west. The Klaus Fault separates it from West Zone, and the Maki separates it 
from 9A Zone. The East Zone was modelled using Leapfrog's vein system tool. 
Wireframes were built around grade composites using a $50 NSR minimum and 
were snapped to mined-face data. The $140 NSR shell was interpolated within the 
$50 NSR shell using a combination of mined-face and assay data. 

14.2.2 West Zone 

The West Zone is bounded by the Klaus Fault at higher elevations and the Maki 
Fault to the west. The Klaus Fault separates the West Zone from the East Zone, and 
the Maki Fault separates the West Zone from the 9A Zone. It was modelled using a 
combination of Leapfrog's vein system tool and intrusion tool. Wireframes were built 
around grade composites using a $50 NSR minimum and were snapped to mined-
face data. The $140 NSR shell was interpolated within the $50 NSR shell using a 
combination of mined-face and assay data. 

14.2.3 9A Zone 

The 9A Zone is bounded by the Maki Fault to the east and the Kahuna Fault to the 
west. The Maki separates it from East and West zones, and the Kahuna separates 
it from the 5250, Southwest, and Northwest West zones. It was modelled using 
Leapfrog's vein system tool. Wireframes were built around grade composites using 
a $50 NSR minimum and were snapped to mined-face data. The $140 NSR shell 
was interpolated within the $50 NSR shell using a combination of mined-face and 
assay data. 

14.2.4 Northwest West Zone 

The Northwest West Zone (NWW) is bounded by the Kahuna Fault to the east and 
the Upper Plate Shear Zone at higher elevations. Greens Creek geologists also 
apply domain boundaries to the zone, to separate it from SW and 5250 zones. This 
is due to differences in mineral trends between the three zones, as well as 
computational constraints seen during block model construction. The Kahuna Fault 
separates the 5250 Zone from the 9A Zone. The NWW Zone mineralization shell 
was created from sectional interpretations on mineralized intervals selected by the 
resource geologist.  The interval selection process was done per drillhole primarily 
according to silver, zinc and lead grades with the general composite grade equaling 
$140-$190 NSR.

March 2019 203  

14.2.5 Upper Plate Zone 

The Upper Plate Zone is bounded by the Upper Plate Shear Zone at lower elevations 
and the Kahuna Fault to the east. The Kahuna Fault separates it from the 9A and 
West zones, and the shear zone separates it from Northwest West Zone. It was 
modelled using Leapfrog's vein system tool. Wireframes were built around grade 
composites using a $50 NSR minimum and were snapped to mined-face data. The 
$140 NSR shell was interpolated within the $50 NSR shell using the structural form 
of the $50NSR shell and assay data. 

14.2.6 Southwest Zone 

The Southwest Zone is bounded by the Kahuna Fault to the east. Greens Creek 
geologists also apply domain boundaries to the zone to separate it from NWW and 
5250 zones. This is due to differences in mineral trends between the three zones, 
as well as computational constraints seen during block model construction. It was 
modelled using a combination of Leapfrog's vein system tool and intrusion tool. 
Wireframes were built around grade composites using a $50 NSR minimum and 
were snapped to mined-face data. The $140 NSR shell was interpolated within the 
$50 NSR shell using a combination of mined-face and assay data. 

14.2.7 200 South Zone 

The 200 South Zone is bounded by the Gallagher Fault to the west. Greens Creek 
geologists also apply domain boundaries to the zone to separate it from the 
Southwest. This is due to a desire to maintain historical consistency, as well as to 
address computational constraints seen during block model construction. The 
Gallagher Fault separates it from the Gallagher Zone. The 200 South Zone was 
modelled using a combination of Leapfrog's vein system tool and intrusion tool. 
Wireframes were built around grade composites using a $50 NSR minimum and 
were snapped to mined-face data. The $140 NSR shell was interpolated within the 
$50 NSR shell using a combination of mined-face and assay data. 

14.2.8 5250 Zone 

The 5250 Zone is bounded by the Kahuna Fault to the east and the Upper Plate 
Shear Zone at higher elevations. Greens Creek geologists also apply domain 
boundaries to the zone to separate it from SW and NWW zones. This is due to 
differences in mineral trends between the three zones, as well as computational 
constraints seen during block model construction. The Kahuna Fault separates it 
from the 9A Zone. The 5250 Zone mineralization shell was created from sectional 
interpretations on mineralized intervals selected by the resource geologist.  The 
interval selection process was done per drillhole primarily according to silver, zinc 
and lead grades with the general composite grade equaling $140-$190NSR. 

14.2.9 Gallagher Zone 

The Gallagher Zone is bounded by the Gallagher Fault to the east. The Gallagher 
Fault separates it from the 200 South Zone and modelled using a combination of 
Leapfrog's vein system tool and intrusion tool. Wireframes were built around grade 
composites using a $50 NSR minimum and were snapped to mined-face data. The

March 2019 204  

$140 NSR shell was interpolated within the $50 NSR shell using the structural form 
of the $50NSR shell and assay data. 

14.3 Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA), in the form of summary statistics, correlation 
matrices, histograms, cumulative probability plots and XY plots are performed on 
both uncapped and capped sample and composite values for Au, Ag, Pb, Zn and 
sample length to determine suitable geological constraints to mineralization. 

14.4 Density Assignment 
Greens Creek has developed a stoichiometric approach to calculating SG making 
use of chemical formulas for principal ore and gangue minerals. The coefficients 
have been adjusted using a least-squares polynomial fit to a dataset of over 23,000 
measurements and are based on measured core specific gravity and the 
corresponding assays. 

The resulting equation to determine the bulk density is: 

Density (g/cm3) = 100/ (36.74 – 0.2815*Pb(%) – 0.1597*Zn(%) - 0.1054*Cu(%) – 
0.3388*Fe(%) – 0.2687*Ba(%)) 

Depending upon the assay protocol in place at the time of sampling, some core 
samples do not have the full suite of validated assays required by this formula. The 
following hierarchical approach is taken to assign a density to a sampled interval: 

• Sample has a full suite of validated assays: Use full regression formula; 
• Sample has full suite except Ba: If logged as a non-baritic mineral type, 

assign a default value for Ba based on zone statistics for non-white baritic 
mineral samples and apply the full regression. The default Ba value is only 
used for density assignment and not for interpolation; 

• Sample does not meet the criteria for 1 or 2 above but has a measured SG: 
Assign measured SG as final sample density; 

• Sample does not meet criteria for 1–3 listed above: Assign a default SG based 
on logged mineral type. Default values are determined by zone/lithological 
type during EDA. 

After metal values have been estimated into the block model blocks, the block 
density is calculated using only the full density calculation formula. 

14.5 Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions 
Grade capping is used to limit the spatial extrapolation of the occasional high, 
isolated precious metal grades. Capping analyses undertaken at Greens Creek 
include the use of probability plots and the Parrish (1997) decile method. For all the 
zones modeled the results are compared and an appropriate value is determined for 
use as the grade cap.  For low to moderate drill density areas, methods tend to 
compare favorably. Capping levels are applied at the sample level only. Table 14-3 
summarizes the caps imposed by zone. 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 205  

14.6 Composites 
Composite lengths for interpolation purposes vary from 3 to 5 feet in length 
depending upon the zone (refer to summary in Table 14-2). Composites start and 
stop at the waste shell, $50 NSR, and $140 NSR boundaries.  

Two methods have been utilized to handle intervals where the flagged length is not 
an integral multiple of the design composite length. If any un-assayed intervals are 
flagged the payable metal values are set to zero.  Non-payable elements are left as 
null (missing value). 

When composites do not reach the full specified interval length, shorter samples are 
created that are cut at the boundary. Table 14-3 shows the capping level by Zone.

14.7 Variography 
Datamine's Advanced Estimation module was used to carry out variography for all 
zones apart from 5250 and Northwest West zones. Individual datasets are 
constructed within the interpreted $50 NSR shells for each zone. Down-hole and 
directional variograms are constructed for Au, Ag, Pb, and Zn. Continuity is modelled 
utilizing a nugget plus a one- or two-structure spherical model. 

For zones with low drilling density, directional variograms are calculated along the 
axes of anisotropy as defined by the overall trend and geometry of the 
interpretations. Nugget values generally range between 0 to 50% of the sill, with Pb 
and Zn typically lower than Au and Ag. Structural ranges can range from less 
continuous (~10 ft) to showing good continuity (>200 ft) depending on the element 
and direction. Figures 14-1 through 14-4 show examples of experimental and 
modeled variograms for four different zones.

14.8 Block Model Prototypes 
For interpolation purposes, a block size of 5x5x5 feet (x, y, z) was selected. This 
dimension functions well in fitting thin veins, but also can be conveniently upblocked 
to match the selective mining unit (SMU), or the minimum stope design dimension, 
of 10x10x15 ft. Blocks for all zones are upblocked to 5x5x15 ft, and these are used 
for mine planning purposes.  

For the thin, vein-like zones or benches, the size of the mineralized material within 
the envelope is commonly less than the SMU size. To accommodate evaluations on 
the thin veins a 10-foot block model buffer is created around mineralized blocks. 
Blocks in the buffer model are estimated separately. The buffer blocks are then used 
to estimate the grade of the material that may be included as dilution to meet the 
minimum stope design. This step typically occurs during the stope design process. 

14.9 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 
Grades are estimated in the block model using the composited drillhole data sets. 
Variograms were constructed for all zones, and all models are estimated using 
ordinary kriging (OK).  For all seven remodeled zones (excluding the NWW and 5250 
zones), variograms provide input to search orientations and anisotropies. Search 
distances are set at a range that corresponds with a certain percentage of the total 
sill for each individual element, where the first pass uses 35% of the sill, and the 
second pass uses 70%. The third pass sets no distance limits. Dynamic anisotropy 
is employed, where the interpreted geologic structure guides the search orientations 
by actively reorienting the search ellipse based on the strike and dip of nearby 
wireframe triangles. Sample selection criteria are set as follows: 

• Minimum number of composites: 1st pass: 6; 2nd pass: 2; 3rd pass: 1 
• Maximum number of composites: 10; 
• Maximum number of composites from a single drillhole: 7 

The NWW and 5250 zones had different parameters applied for search distances. 
The NWW Zone used distances of 50-60 feet for the primary search axis for the first 
pass, and 75-90 feet for the second pass.  The 5250 Zone used distances of 60-75 
feet for the primary search axis for the first pass, and 90-112.5 feet for the second 
pass. Sample selection criteria were set as follows: 

• Minimum number of composites: 1st pass: 15; 2nd pass: 15; 3rd pass: 5-20; 
• Maximum number of composites: 15-30; 
• Maximum number of composites from a single drillhole: n/a 

14.10 Block Model Validation 
Estimation validation is done by performing one or more of the following checks on 
the model: 

• Review and inspection of parameter files (Datamine macros) used in the 
mineral resource estimation; 

• Visual inspection of results by metal on plan and section;

• Comparison of ordinary-kriged or inverse-distance and NN distributions 
(Table 14-4); 

• Analysis of grade profiles by easting, northing and elevation using swath plots 
(Figures 14-5 to 14-8); 

• External spot-checks of key calculations such as block kriging and 
compositing. 

• The checks showed the models were acceptable for use in Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation

14.11 Classification of Mineral Resources 
In order to determine appropriate classification standards, variograms for each zone 
are considered for Ag (lower continuity) and Zn (higher continuity).  

Classification distances are set at a range that corresponds with a certain 
percentage of the total sill for Ag and Zn as read off the semi-variograms. Measured 
blocks need to fall within a distance calculated as the average of 35% of the sill-
range for both elements. Indicated blocks need to fall within an average of 70% of 
the sill-range for both elements.  

Table 14-5 shows the classification parameters used for the seven zones updated 
in 2018. The 5250 and NWW zone parameters are displayed in Table 14-6 because 
different standards were employed during their classification.

14.12 Reasonable Prospects of Economic Extraction 
Over 20 years of production experience demonstrates that the mineral deposits at 
Greens Creek are amenable to underground overhand cut-and-fill and long-hole 
stoping methods.  Based on this production history, the following assumptions have 
been applied to determine the extent of the classified material that might have a 
reasonable expectation of economic extraction. 

As with previous years a 5x5x5 ft block model and a 5x5x15 ft block model was 
created for each zone.  The models were used by the engineering department to 
design mineral reserve shapes with the thinner and more horizontal mineral zones 
utilizing the 5x5x5 model.  Once mineral reserve stopes were designed the mineral 
reserve was calculated based on the 5x5x5 model. 

For mineral resource calculation the models were depleted for mined asbuilts and 
mineral reserve shapes within Deswick which generated a partial block/subcell 
model.  Those models were then used as follows: 

1. Depending on the mineral zone, either the 5x5x5 ft or 5x5x15 ft model was 
viewed in plan at mid-block with the NSR values displayed.  Polygons were 
drawn at mid-block around the depleted mineral resource blocks so that: 
• All blocks >$190 NSR immediately adjacent to the designed mineral 

reserve were enclosed. 
• All blocks >$190 NSR separated from the designed mineral reserve 

were enclosed if the blocks were seen to be continuous in 3D to 
approximately 20,000 tons or more.  Where these blocks were only a 
single block wide (5ft) they were not enclosed. 

• No blocks >$190 NSR immediately adjacent to asbuilts were enclosed 
unless those blocks looked to be continuous and wide enough to 
support a separate stope. 

• Once blocks were selected in the appropriate model, they were 
reported without any dilution from neighboring blocks with <$190 NSR 
values. 

2. The Gallagher and Upper Plate zone mineral resource polygons were drawn 
every 5 ft in elevation at mid-block on the 5x5x5 ft model.  Once blocks were 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 213  

selected and coded the mineral resource report used the 5x5x5 ft model.  
This approach was taken as the mineral zones are often thin and shallowly 
dipping.  The guiding principle on selecting the >$190 NSR blocks was to 
keep a 10 ft mining width over 20,000 tons if away from a mineral reserve 
shape.  

3. The 200S Zone mineral resource polygons were drawn every 15 ft in 
elevation while viewing the 5x5x15 ft model and mid-block elevation.  Those 
polygons were extruded into 15 ft high selection volumes that coded blocks 
as mineral resource within the 5x5x5 ft model. The 5x5x5 ft model was then 
used to report the mineral resource. The 5x5x5 model was chosen so as to 
not overly dilute (and reduce) the mineral resource with 15 ft high blocks 
which often split the thin vein and create artifact zones of mineral resource 
parallel to each other simply due to the larger blocks splitting the vein or not. 

4. The remaining mineral resource polygons of the 9A, East, SWB, West, NWW 
and 5250 zones were drawn every 15 ft in elevation while viewing the 5x5x15 
ft models.  The polygons were extruded into 15ft high selection volumes to 
code the 5x5x15 ft model blocks as mineral resource.  Only blocks > $190 
NSR were selected for tabulation of the mineral resource which was 
performed on the 5x5x15 ft model.  The thicker model was chosen for these 
zones as the mineralization is often thicker and does not display the artifact 
banding that the other thinner and more horizontal mineral bodies did.

14.13 Mineral Resource Statement 
Mineral Resources take geologic, mining, processing and economic constraints into 
account, and have been defined within a conceptual stope design and therefore are 
classified in accordance with the 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves, and the 2003 CIM Best Practice Guidelines. 

The Qualified Person for the Mineral Resource estimate is Mr. Paul Jensen, CPG, a 
Hecla employee. Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves and 
are reported using a $190NSR cut-off.  

Hecla cautions that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves and have not 
demonstrated economic viability. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are 
reported in Table 14-8.  Inferred Mineral Resources are summarized in Table 14-9. 

14.13.1 Factors That May Affect the Mineral Resource Estimate 

Factors which may affect the Mineral Resource estimates include: 

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Changes to design parameter assumptions that pertain to stope design; 
• Changes to geotechnical, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; 
• Changes to the assumptions used to generate the NSR cut-off; 
• Changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 

mineralization zones; 
• Changes to the assumptions related to mineral tenure rights and royalty 

assumptions associated with the Land Exchange properties.

14.14 Comments on Mineral Resource Estimates 
Hecla is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is subject to SEC requirements 
when reporting on the Greens Creek Mine.  In forms filed with the SEC, Hecla uses 
terminology in SEC Industry Guide 7 for reporting Ore Mineral Reserves.  On its 
website, Hecla uses the Industry Guide 7 terms for Ore Reserves, and the 2007 
Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration Guide (2007 SME Guide) terms for 
the categories of Mineral Resources.   

NI 43-101 allows mining companies incorporated outside of Canada to report 
mineral resources and mineral reserves under accepted foreign codes.  SEC 
Industry Guide 7 is an acceptable foreign code under National Instrument 43-101 
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101), but only for the reporting 
of mineral reserves.  Canadian securities regulators do not accept the SEC usage 
of "mineralized material" as a category of mineral resources and will not accept tons 
and grade of mineralized material reported in technical reports unless it has been 
reclassified into the mineral resource categories accepted under NI 43-101.  

Hecla is therefore reporting the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, and 
Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources in Sections 14 and 15 using 
the definitions and categories set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, 
and Petroleum 2010 Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (2010 CIM Definition Standards) as follows: 

• The term "Proven Ore Reserve" under SEC Industry Guide 7 is equivalent to 
"Proven Mineral Reserve" under CIM Definition Standards; 

• The term "Probable Ore Reserve" under Industry Guide 7 is equivalent to 
"Probable Mineral Reserve" under CIM Definition Standards; 

• The term "Indicated Mineral Resource" or "Mineralized Material" that Hecla 
is using for the Greens Creek Mine in website disclosures is equivalent to 
"Indicated Mineral Resource" under CIM Definition Standards; 

• The term "Inferred Mineral Resources" or "Other Resources" that Hecla is 
using for the Greens Creek Mine in website disclosures is equivalent to 
"Inferred Mineral Resources" under CIM Definition Standards. 

The QP is of the opinion that the Mineral Resources for the Project, which have been 
estimated using core drill data, have been performed to industry best practices, and 
conform to the requirements of CIM (2014). The QP is not aware of any 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, 
or other relevant factors that would materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Summary of Estimation Methodology 
Mineral Reserves have been estimated from the mineral resource block model, 
which is developed by the geology department and updated regularly to incorporate 
new information (see Section 14).  All zones in the geological model are considered 
for conversion from Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve as the models are 
updated.   

The following criteria were used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves: 

• Only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are considered; 
• Dilution is included in the Mineral Reserve estimate; 
• Mineral Reserves are supported by an economic mine plan; 
• The reference point for Mineral Reserves is the mill feed.  Metallurgical 

process losses are not considered when determining the Mineral Reserves. 

The Greens Creek NI 43-101 Mineral Reserves Estimate was created with Deswik 
software using similar methodologies and basic assumptions as previous annual 
mineral reserve estimates.  All areas are designed for either longhole stoping (where 
the mineralized zone is sufficiently vertical), drift-and-fill stoping, or overhand cut-
and-fill stoping. 

15.2 Process for Conversion of Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve 
The design process begins by creating a grade shell of the resource block model to 
highlight Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource blocks with an NSR in excess 
of the $190/ton cutoff.  Areas with sufficient amounts of these blocks are targeted 
for evaluation as potential mineral reserves. 

A detailed stope design is created for each level considering appropriate stoping 
criteria such as stope dimensions, level spacing, geological and geotechnical 
factors, the shape of the mineral zone, and any nearby previous mining.  This is 
followed with the creation of 3D primary development and access ramp designs, as 
well as supporting infrastructure excavations.   

The minimum mining height and width is 15 ft, which is the smallest dimension that 
can effectively accommodate Greens Creek's mining equipment.  In areas to be 
mined with drift-and-fill methods, the centerline of each planned drift is created to 
maximize the planned mineral extraction in each 15 ft vertical interval of the block 
model.  These centerlines are then extruded into 15 ft wide by 15 ft high three-
dimensional solids to reflect the nominal stoping dimension. 

3D solids are also created in the areas where longhole mining is planned. The height 
and width of these solids reflect the actual longhole design. Most longhole stopes 
are 25 ft wide with a variable height.   The dimensions of long-hole stopes vary 
significantly depending upon the shape of the mineral zone, the competence of the 
rock, and the limitations of drilling equipment. 

The stope design wireframes are then evaluated against the geologic block model 
to generate tons and grade for each stope, determined from the model blocks that 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 218  

fall within the design.  The block models are depleted as part of this process to 
account for historic mining, replacing previously-mined blocks with backfill grades.  
Dilution factors are then added to account for rock overbreak and backfill dilution. 
Once the mine design is completed and interrogated, the designed stopes and mine 
development are exported to Deswik Scheduler where an optimized schedule is 
generated. 

15.3 Dilution and Mining Losses 
Hecla assumes 100% mine recovery for all mining methods when determining the 
life-of-mine Mineral Reserves.  Reconciliation data indicate that such recovery levels 
have historically been met.  See Section 15.12 for further details on reconciliation. 

All Mineral Reserves are reported as fully diluted tonnages and grades.  Dilution in 
the Mineral Reserve comes from three sources: 

1. Dilution within the designed stope volume- All Greens Creek block models 
have a waste model enveloping the mineral blocks which allows dilution to be 
accounted for in the mine design process.  In some areas the mineralization may 
be thinner than the 15-ft minimum mining width.  If the mineral zone has 
sufficiently high grade, this dilution will be intentionally mined and is accounted 
for when the designed mineral volume is evaluated against the block model. 

2. Rock Overbreak Dilution- A certain percentage of overbreak is normal and 
expected when mining using drill-and-blast methods.  When multiple drifts are 
planned to be mined adjacent to each other, some of this overbreak material will 
be accounted for by the tonnage otherwise expected from subsequent cuts. In 
other instances, the overbreak will be low-grade waste material that would not 
be targeted for mining.  This overbreak is taken into account by applying an 
empirically derived dilution factor of 6% to all mineral reserve designs.  The 
dilution metal grades are summarized in Table 15-1. 

Table 15-1: Rock Dilution Grades 

Rock Dilution Grades 
Ag (oz/ton) 1.000 
Au (oz/ton) 0.010 
Pb % 0.25% 
Zn % 0.75% 
Cu % 0.10% 
Fe % 5.50% 

 

3. Backfill Dilution- Most mining at Greens Creek takes place adjacent to 
previously backfilled drifts or stopes.  During blasting, some amount of overbreak 
will occur into the backfill.  An empirically derived dilution factor of 6% was 
applied to account for this backfill dilution.  This backfill dilution is in addition to 
the rock dilution discussed above and is applied to all mineral reserve designs 
regardless of the relative length of mining which is adjacent to backfill. 

Occasionally, backfill is also contained within the planned stope volume due to 
mining adjacent to a backfilled drift with an irregular back, rib or sill.  This type of 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 219  

dilution is accounted for in the block model depletion process. 

The backfill contains a small amount of residual metal value as it consists of 
cemented tailings from the Greens Creek mill.  Grades used for backfill dilution are 
based on historical tailings assays provided by the mill and are presented in Table 
15-2.

15.4 NSR Formula 
The Greens Creek mill produces four different concentrates: lead, zinc, bulk, and 
gravity.  Each of these concentrates has different payability factors and smelter 
terms.  Because of this complexity, the block value is typically expressed in terms of 
net smelter return (NSR) rather than by metal grade.  NSR refers to the dollar amount 
of revenue that is expected from each ton of material after it is mined, milled and 
sold as concentrate. 

The NSR formula used in the 2019 Technical Report was supplied by the Hecla 
Corporate metallurgy group.  This formula is based on a linear regression (line of 
best fit) between the metal content and NSR of a wide variety of Greens Creek 
mineral types and grades.  It accounts for the different metallurgical recoveries, 
payability terms, and smelter charges for the four different types of concentrate.  It 
also accounts for transport costs. 

Note that the NSR formula cannot be used to determine the actual contained NSR 
value of each metal in any individual ton of ore.  This is due to the complex interaction 
of the different metal grades in the milling process.  For example, silver primarily 
reports to the lead concentrate where it has the best payability terms.  Therefore, 
changes to the lead grade of the mill feed can impact the recovery and payability of 
the contained silver by affecting the proportion of silver that reports to each type of 
concentrate. 

  



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 220  

The NSR formula for 2018 Mineral Reserves is expressed as follows:   

Flotation NSR:   

(0.1347 * [Au OPT] * [Au $/oz])    +             (0.6942 * [Ag OPT] * [Ag $/oz])   +     

(18.65 * [Pb %] * [Pb $/lb])           +             (9.137 * [Zn (%)] * [Zn $/lb]) 

 

Gravity NSR:  

IF [Au OPT] < 0.026  0                                    

IF [Au OPT] >= 0.026 ((0.2465 * [Au OPT]) - 0.0065) * [Au $/oz] * 0.9289 
  

Total NSR = [Flotation NSR] + [Gravity NSR] 

 

15.5 Metal Price Assumptions 
Metal price assumptions used for this Report were supplied by Hecla Corporate. 
Metals prices (in USD) used were: $14.50/oz silver, $1200/oz gold, $0.90/lb lead, 
and $1.15/lb zinc. 

15.6 Cut-off Grade and "Must-Take" Ore 
The cut-off grade (COG) NSR value used for stope design of all mining methods is 
$190/ton.  This COG reflects the actual property-wide cash costs distributed on a 
per-ton basis as well as an allocation for the expected cost of sustaining capital items 
and capitalized development.  A $200/ton cutoff was applied to the Gallagher Zone 
to account for a potential royalty on production from this area (see Section 15.9). 

Mining plans will frequently require mining through mineral resource areas of less 
than $190/ton NSR in order to access more distant above-cutoff ore.   When low-
grade mineral resource must be mined in order to access a higher-grade area, a 
"must-take" cutoff of $75/ton NSR is applied.  Since this material must be mined 
regardless of NSR value it can be profitably milled if the NSR exceeds $75/ton, which 
covers incremental milling and administrative costs.  Therefore, any Measured or 
Indicated Mineral Resource intersected by development and resulting in a diluted 
grade above $75/ton is considered ore and is included in the Mineral Reserve, while 
any material below $75/ton is treated as waste. 

15.7 Probable and Proven Mineral Reserve Classifications 
Current practice at Hecla Greens Creek is to classify all in-situ underground 
Reserves as Probable Mineral Reserves.  The only material included in the "Proven" 
Mineral Reserve category is the relatively small amount of ore tonnage present in 
the surface stockpile.

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 221  

15.8 Handling of Inferred Mineral Resource Inside Mineral Reserve 
Wireframes 
Areas of Inferred Mineral Resource are not targeted for inclusion in the stope design 
wireframes used to determine the Mineral Reserve.  In order to generate a feasible 
mining shape, block model cells of Inferred Mineral Resource class are sometimes 
incidentally included within the extents of stope design wireframes that primarily 
target Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource material.   

When this occurs, the metal value is removed from the proportion of the wireframe 
that encompasses Inferred mineral resource blocks.  The Inferred mineral resource 
metal values are then replaced with mineralized waste, applying the same grades 
as the "Rock Overbreak Dilution" discussed in Section 15.3.  This reflects a small 
residual metal value based on the typical levels of mineralization found in the waste 
rind surrounding the mineral body. 

Inferred Mineral Resources of 4.5 million ounces silver, 24.6 koz gold, 20.7 ktons 
zinc and 8.9 ktons lead lie within the boundaries of the Mineral Reserve wireframes 
and have been discounted (net of the mineralized waste metal values with which 
they were replaced).  Current practice is to also exclude this material from the 
Inferred Mineral Resource totals since the tons (but not the metal) are already 
encompassed by the Mineral Reserve. 

15.9 Other Mineral Reserves Criteria 
All undeveloped mining levels are subjected to an economic analysis to ensure that 
the operating cashflow produced from the extraction of the mineral reserves (NSR 
above $190/ton) exceeds the marginal development cost to access the level.  This 
becomes an important criterion for certain levels at the margins of the mineral body 
which require a large amount of development to access but contain relatively low 
ore tonnage. 

For mineral reserves located at shallow depths relative to surface topography, a 
minimum crown pillar criterion of 100 ft has been applied. 

Historic mining and backfill are considered when evaluating an area for inclusion in 
Mineral Reserve.  Historically-mined areas with incomplete asbuilt surveys are not 
eligible to be included in Mineral Reserve until a complete set of reliable asbuilts is 
located.   

Certain historical mining panels are recorded as being filled with loose waste rock or 
unconsolidated tailings instead of cemented backfill.  This prohibits any mining 
adjacent or underneath the affected area, and generally results in the sterilization of 
the potential Mineral Reserve.  Certain areas which contain adjacent ore of very high 
grades are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for re-entry, removal of the waste or 
tailings, and placement of cemented backfill. 

Geotechnical factors are considered when determining Mineral Reserves.  Small 
areas of above-cutoff grade material have been excluded from the Mineral Reserve 
due to high geotechnical risk (highly-stressed pillars adjacent to large backfilled 
longhole blocks).  These areas may be added to Mineral Reserves in the future if 
geotechnical analysis demonstrates they can be extracted safely and economically.

The Gallagher Zone is subject to a royalty amounting to approximately 3% of NSR 
unless extralateral rights are established.  This potential royalty has been taken into 
account when evaluating the economics of the area.  The Greens Creek geology 
group is advancing the process of determining whether extralateral rights have been 
established for this zone which would negate the potential royalty. 

15.10 Mineral Reserves Statement 
Mineral Reserves have taken into account environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political factors and constraints. The 
Mineral Reserves are acceptable to support mine planning.  Mr. Kyle Mehalek, P.E., 
a Hecla employee, is the QP for the estimate.  Mineral Reserves have an effective 
date of 31 December 2018 and are reported using a fully diluted NSR cut-off of 
$190/ton for all zones and all mining methods (Table 15-3).

15.11 Factors That May Affect the Mineral Reserve Estimates 
Factors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include:  

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Variations in short-term marketing and sales contracts; 
• Changes to the mineral resource block model; 
• Changes to the assumptions that go into defining the NSR cut-off; 
• Assumptions relating to the geotechnical and hydrological parameters used 

in mine design;  
• Metallurgical recovery factors: recoveries vary on a day to day basis 

depending on the grades and mineralization types being processed. These 
variations are expected to trend to the forecast LOM recovery value for 
monthly or longer reporting periods; 

• Variations to the permitting, operating, or social license regime. 

15.12 Reconciliation 
Of the 844 Ktons of ore mined in 2018, approximately 43% was mined from outside 
the Mineral Reserve, a somewhat higher proportion than during the period from 2015 
to 2017.  This reflects the mining of Inferred Mineral Resource at the margins of 
certain mine levels which is not included in Mineral Reserve, as well as additional 
ore identified during the mining process that was not previously defined with drilling 
and therefore was not included in the mineral resource models.

Greens Creek performs periodic reconciliations of mineral reserve models to the 
mine and mill performance, including three factors: mine reported production versus 
block model depletion (F1), mill feed versus mine reported production (F2), and mill 
feed versus block model depletion (F3).  Reconciliation data for 2018 production is 
shown in the following Table 15-4.   

Table 15-4: Greens Creek Reconciliation Data for 2018 

 
 

Despite the significant proportion of ore mined outside of the modeled mineral 
reserve, the estimated mined and mill feed grades for 2018 are close to the model 
predicted grades of the depleted mineral reserve.   These results are in line with the 
historical trend over the Greens Creek mine life, which has been that the mill 
receives more Au and Ag but less Pb and Zn than predicted by the block model. 

Historical Mill-Model reconciliation factors (F3) for the last four years are shown in 
Table 15-5. 

Table 15-5: F3 Factors by Year: Mill Production / Mineral Reserve Depletion  

 
 

15.13 Mineral Reserve History 
Greens Creek replaced or added Mineral Reserves from 1997 until 2001, both by 
new discoveries and by upgrading mineral resource models.  In 1998, discovery and 
development of the 200S Zone and a change in classification of the 5250 Zone 
accounted for a significant increase in mineral reserves.   

In 1999, there were more positive changes in these zones and in the Southwest 
Zone.  In 2000, the West Zone mineral reserve increased substantially, but in 2001 
and 2002, re-evaluation of the model and decreasing metal prices more than erased 
the 2000 gain.   

After a notable decrease in 2001 due to metal prices, the Greens Creek mineral 
reserve tonnage was maintained at a fairly constant level of 7.0 to 8.5 million tons

between 2001 to 2017, until experiencing a large increase with the 2018 end-of-year 
update due to the addition of the Gallagher and Upper Plate zones and improved 
mineral resource models which enabled the addition of significant remnant material 
that was left behind by previous mining.   

Mineral Reserve grades for precious metals have remained fairly stable over the

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Underground Mine Access & Layout 
The underground mine is accessed by a portal (920 Main) on the 920 ft elevation, 
which is located in the same general area as the mill, stockpile pad and 
administration building.  The 920 Main is the primary equipment and personnel 
entrance to the mine as well as the primary air intake.   

A secondary escapeway portal (the 59 Secondary Escapeway) is located 
immediately adjacent to the 920 portal and offers a secondary egress from certain 
areas of the mine.   

A third portal is located above the mine site at the 1350 elevation, this portal is used 
as a ventilation exhaust and secondary escapeway.  The 1350 portal is not normally 
used for haulage or personnel access due to the steep surface access roadway 
which is not maintained during winter months.   

All active areas of the mine are accessed via one or more of the nine major ramp 
systems: 

• 29 Ramp 
• 4055 Ramp 
• 48 Decline / 37 Ramp 
• 5250 Ramp 
• 45 Decline 
• 31 Ramp 
• 2853 Ramp 
• 2950 Ramp 
• PD480 Ramp 

Most ramps are connected via cross-cuts at various locations, therefore most 
working areas have multiple options for equipment access in the event a particular 
ramp is blocked for rehab or utility work.  However, two of the ramp systems, the 
5250 and PD480 ramps, have a single route for mobile equipment access.  These 
ramps feature laddered escapeway raises to enable airflow and a secondary means 
of egress. 

A general mine layout schematic for the underground ramp system is shown in 
Figure 16-1.  See Section 16.16.5 ("Mine Plan Overview") for views of the as-built 
wireframes for the ramp system.

16.2 Mine Development 
Mine development is undertaken with fully mechanized drill-and-blast methods.  
Conventional diesel-powered rubber-tired equipment is used.  Blastholes are drilled 
by a fleet of twin & single boom drilling jumbos.  Blasting is carried out with mobile 
explosives loading vehicles utilizing bulk emulsion.  Mucking and hauling is via LHD 
and end-dump articulated haul trucks. 

Ground support activities are performed with mechanized bolting equipment.  
Jacklegs are not used for face drilling or ground support installation.  Primary ground 
support consists of split set and Swellex friction rock bolts and wire mesh.  Cable 
bolts and wet-process shotcrete is applied as required, and there is an ongoing 
project to install fully grouted rebar bolts in existing haulageways for life-of-mine 
support. 

Currently, most primary ramp development and ore access drives are driven with an 
arched profile at 16.0-ft width by 17.5-ft height.  The back height is increased in areas 
where fans are to be installed or truck loading is to occur.  Some of the historical 
ramp development was driven at smaller dimensions which can still accommodate 
most of the current equipment fleet. Primary haulage ramps are driven at a gradient 
of no more than -15%, with -12.5% being typical.  Ore access drives are driven at a 
decline of -15 to -18% from the haulage ramp. 

The mine workings include a number of raises which variously serve as ventilation 
routes, secondary escapeways, and muck transfer passes.  Vertical development is 
currently undertaken by a raiseboring contractor.  Many historical raises are in use 
which were developed using a variety of methods including raiseboring, Alimak, and 
longhole (drop) raising.   

16.3 Production Mining 
The planned production rate is 2300 tons per day.  The overall throughput rate is 
limited by mill capacity; the operation is not mine-constrained.  All production areas 
are accessed via an ore access crosscut driven from a primary haulage ramp.  There 
are no captive stopes or other areas accessible only by raises.   

Hecla utilizes two primary mining methods at Greens Creek:  

• Overhand cut-and-fill (approximately 2000 tons per day, 87% of overall 
production) 

• Long-hole stoping (approximately 300 tons per day, 13% of overall 
production) 

Where overhand cut-and-fill is used, production levels are mined at a minimum 
dimension of 15 ft wide by 15 ft high.  After all ore is recovered at a given elevation 
of a mining area, the established ore access drive from the haulage ramp is breasted 
down.  This provides re-access to the next "lift" of the extraction level at a higher 
elevation immediately above the previous mining.  Where the mineral body is wide 
enough, multiple panels may be mined along strike prior to re-accessing to the next 
lift. 

Production levels are named based on the sill elevation of the initial lift before re-
accessing.  Levels with an elevation below sea level are named using the "M" prefix 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 229  

to denote "minus" (for example, M660 is 660 feet below sea level).  To denote the 
current lift, an alphabetical suffix is attached to the level name based on the number 
of re-access that have occurred (for example, M480D is the fourth lift of the 656 
level). 

Figure 16-2: Side View of Asbuilt of Typical Cut-and-Fill Mining Arrangement 
 

 
 

Figure 16-3: Plan View of Typical Cut-and-Fill Mining Layout 

 
Grade control is maintained by production geologists in cut-and-fill headings.  The 
lithologies in each face are mapped and sampled to determine if any adjustments 
are necessary in order to keep the heading in the ore.  The geometry of the 
mineralized lithology is frequently very complex, as shown in the face map example 
below.

Figure 16-4: Example of Production Geology Face Mapping 

 

 
 

Long-hole stoping is used where the mineral body is sufficiently steep and/or thick 
and geotechnical conditions are favorable.  There is no standardized design due to 
the highly variable geometry of the mineral zones.  Both longitudinal and transverse 
methods are used depending on the local shape of the mineral zone. 

Typically, overcut and undercut drives are driven at widths between 15 and 25 ft and 
separated by thicknesses ranging from 30 to 75 ft vertically.  Where development of 
an overcut is not economic, the longhole may be mined as a backstope as long as 
ground conditions are good. 

Ore zones are drilled and blasted from the overcut (with Cubex drill) or undercut 
(with Simba drill).  Extraction occurs via remote mucking on the undercut level, and 
then the stope is filled from the overcut level.  In the case of longhole backstopes, 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 231  

filling is achieved by drilling a borehole from higher elevation workings into which a 
paste pipe is inserted.  

Transverse stoping layouts are designed as primaries and secondaries, with primary 
and secondary stopes being similar in size.  This enables additional working faces 
as well as the opportunity to use mine development waste for backfill of secondaries. 

16.4 Ore Handling 
Ore handling is performed with a fleet of underground haulage vehicles and LHDs.  
Some LHDs are equipped with remote operating capability and provide mucking and 
loading activities for longhole stopes or other areas of unsupported ground.   

All ore is trucked out of the mine to the surface mill stockpile, located approximately 
450 ft from the 920 Portal.  The underground haulage fleet consists primarily of 40-
ton articulated end-dump haul trucks.   

Haulage distances are highly variable since active working headings are located 
throughout all elevations of the mine.  A round trip from the ore pad to the M720 
(currently the lowest production level in the mine) covers a distance of approximately 
seven miles. 

The two mine ramps which are driven in an upwards direction (29 Ramp and 5250) 
feature muck pass raises to facilitate material handling.  The 5250-muck pass raise 
is fitted with a chute at the bottom for truck loading. 

16.5 Waste Handling 
Waste is either trucked out of the mine to the Site 23 waste disposal area located 
approximately 0.5 miles from the 920 portal or is placed in previously mined-out 
stopes when available. If no future mining is planned directly alongside or 
underneath, waste can be used to backfill cut and fill stopes by placement on the sill 
with subsequent placement of cemented tailings on top. The waste used to backfill 
secondary long-hole stopes is dumped near the top cut and pushed into the empty 
stope using an LHD or jammer. 

16.6 Mine Backfill 
Backfill of mined-out voids is achieved via three methods: 

• Paste fill: cemented tailings are trucked from the mill to the underground 
paste plant where they are pumped into the mined-out voids via a network of 
pipes.  This method is low-cost but is not practical for all areas of the mine 
where pumping pressures would be too high. 

• Jam (conventional) fill: Where installation of paste pipe is not feasible, 
cemented tailings are trucked to the heading and compacted using jammer 
equipment.  This method is more flexible but higher-cost than paste fill. 

• Waste fill: Loose waste rock is placed in areas where structural support of 
the mined-out void is not necessary to enable future mining.  This enables a 
reduction in the amount of waste rock that must be impounded on surface. 

In the cut-and-fill excavations, extracted panels are typically "tight-filled" with a 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 232  

combination of cemented tailings and waste, allowing further panel extraction 
alongside and between backfill. The backfill mixture is typically composed of 
dewatered tailings and 5% cement content.  When future mining is planned directly 
underneath a filled area, 8% cement content is used in order to enable the backfill 
to maintain the future back span. The tailings are batched with cement on surface 
and hauled either to the stope (for jam filling) or to the paste plant where water is 
added, and the mixture is then pumped directly to the stope.   

In order to prevent the paste from flowing out of the area being backfilled, a shotcrete 
"pastewall" will be built or a plug of cemented tailings will be jammed into the 
heading.  This will make the heading airtight, so "breather pipes" are installed 
through the pastewall in addition to the paste pipe to allow excess air and water to 
evacuate the heading as it is being filled in order to prevent the creation of paste 
voids.  The paste line is flushed with air and water at the completion of each pour in 
order to prevent the cemented tailings from curing inside the line. 

Primary longhole stopes are filled with paste backfill, containing a cement content of 
5-8%.  This allows the safe extraction of secondary blocks between backfill, while 
minimizing dilution.  Secondary longholes are filled with waste rock from mine 
development wherever possible. 

The paste plant was commissioned in 2001 and is located in the 59 Drift 
approximately 3,600 ft from the 920 Portal.  It features a dump hopper, mixer, and 
three positive-displacement paste pumps.  A backfill QA/QC program is in place with 
samples tested regularly to ensure adequate strength. 

Backfill criteria are as follows. 

Target % Solids: 

• Paste fill: 77% 
• Jam fill: 86% 

Minimum fill strength requirement is dependent upon desired application: 

• Ribs (for drifting alongside fill): 25psi 
• Longholes (tall ribs): 70psi 
• Back (for drifting underneath fill): 150psi 

Typical minimum strength (UCS) achieved with 28-day cure time: 

• Paste fill with 5% cement: 100psi 
• Paste fill with 8% cement: 300psi 

16.7 Ventilation 
The Greens Creek Mine is ventilated using an exhausting system with a design 
capacity of 427 kcfm.  Intake air is drawn into the mine from the 920 Portal and the 
59 Escapeway Portal.  Exhaust air exits the mine via the 1350 Portal and the 2853 
Exhaust Raise.  A schematic of the ventilation airflows is shown in Figure 16-5. 

Primary ventilation is achieved with three main underground fans: 

• 500hp, 84" dia. located near the 1350 portal (242 kcfm) 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 233  

• 350hp, 84" dia. located near the bottom of the 2853 Raise (147 kcfm) 
• 75hp, 42" dia. compressor room fan exhausting to the 2853 Raise (38 kcfm) 

Secondary ventilation of achieved with auxiliary heading fans (ranging from 40hp-
150hp) which pull air from the main ramps and force-ventilate the working faces via 
plastic hardline and vent bag, as shown in figure 16-6.   

Both primary and auxiliary fans can be controlled from surface using the mine's 
SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system.  Since blasting is initiated 
from surface, the local auxiliary fan is turned off remotely prior to the shot and then 
turned back on immediately afterwards in order to clear blasting gases. 

The underground air flow is controlled by several sets of ventilation doors and 
numerous permanent bulkheads which separate intake from exhaust circuits. There 
is no provision for heating the intake air.  Mine water and discharge lines located 
near the 920 Portal consist of insulated "Arctic Pipe" in order to prevent freezing. 

Shop facilities include fire doors as required per MSHA regulation.  The 920 Main 
shop includes a dedicated exhaust raise and fan which sends shop exhaust directly 
to the 1350 Main Fan where it promptly flows out the 1350 Portal. 

Near-term plans include the installation of a 500hp booster fan in the PD480 ramp 
to provide for additional airflow capacity due to a planned increase in mining activity 
in this area, as well as to manage heat load as the mine workings progress to greater 
depth.  This fan will be initially be run at significantly less than maximum capacity 
through the use of a variable frequency drive (VFD) but is intended to be ramped up 
in future years if ventilation requirements increase in this area. 

Secondary ventilation is a material proportion of the mine's overall electricity 
consumption.  A ventilation on demand (VOD) system is currently in place in a limited 
number of headings and is planned to be extended to the remainder of the mine.  
This system involves the installation of a VFD on the secondary fan which is linked 
to the RFID transponder located on each piece of equipment and personnel cap 
lamp. 

The VOD system automatically turns on the fan when an individual or piece of 
equipment enters the heading and will automatically turn off the fan when the 
heading has been vacant for a predetermined period of time.  The VOD system also 
adjusts the VFD setting to the appropriate power level based on the ventilation needs 
of the heading's current occupants – "low" for personnel and light utility vehicles, 
"high" for larger equipment.

16.8 Communications & Emergency Infrastructure 
Underground communications systems include: a leaky-feeder radio system, mine 
phones placed throughout active working areas, and an underground Wi-Fi network. 

There is a stench alert system located at the 920 Portal as well as other key locations 
throughout the mine.  This system can be activated remotely through the SCADA 
system or manually at the stench release locations. 

There are several refuge chambers located at key areas throughout the mine; these 
refuge chambers are connected to the mine compressed air system to provide a 
breathable atmosphere in case of a mine fire or other underground hazardous 
atmosphere.  In the event of a failure or contamination of the compressed air system, 
the refuge chambers have oxygen bottles and CO2 scrubbers.  The chambers also 
contain water, medical supplies, toilets, mine radios connected to the leaky feeder 
system, and mine phones. 

16.9 Blasting and Explosives 
Blasting is carried out primarily with the use of bulk emulsion transported to the 
heading with a powder truck containing an emulsion pump.  Non-electric (non-el) 
blasting caps are used for drifting and i-Kon electronic caps are used in long-hole 
stoping. 

Bulk emulsion is transported by ISO containers to permanent underground storage 
tanks located in the underground powder magazine on the 59 Drift.  The cap mag is 
also located in this area.   

Blasting takes place at the end of shift after all personnel have left the mine.  Each 
round is initiated by an electronic cap tied into a remote blasting box which is 
controlled through the centralized electronic blasting system.  Blasting gases are 
monitored remotely using a network of sensors at various locations along the airflow 
exhaust routes to ensure that the mine atmosphere is safe prior to re-entry. 

Greens Creek is a sulfide mineral deposit and has historically experienced 
occasional sulfide dust ignitions with blasting.  These ignitions caused minor damage 
to infrastructure located near the face (including ventilation bags and utility lines).  
Current practice is to identify high-sulfide headings based on face sampling and to 
wet down the back and ribs near the face immediately prior to blasting.  This 
minimizes the quantity of sulfide dust which becomes airborne during blasting and 
reduces the chance of a secondary sulfide dust ignition. 

16.10 Ground Support 
The Greens Creek Ground Control Management Plan (GCMP) summarizes how the 
mine deals with the ground conditions created due to mining.  The mineral deposits 
at Greens Creek has undergone several folding sequences that have resulted in a 
contorted rock mass yielding a complex structural system.  Standard ground support 
designs are used based on design conditions, primarily related to back span. 

The mineralized material is the strongest and most competent material in most areas 
of the mine.  Mineral lithologies have a rock strength of up to 30,000 psi.  The 
structural footwall unit, composed primarily of phyllite, has a rock strength of up to 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 237  

15,000 psi.  The structural hanging wall unit, composed primarily of argillite, has a 
rock strength of up to 7,000 psi. 

The ground support strategy in use at the mine uses the concept of rock 
reinforcement and surface control to construct a stable support arch for the specified 
excavation geometry.  Rock reinforcement or rock bolts clamp the arch together and 
assures its integrity and strength.  Surface support ensures an intact and regular 
excavation profile that allows the bolts to perform at maximum efficiency.  The 
combination of these two criteria establish ground control measures employed in the 
mine headings, and on current knowledge, providing a safe and stable work area. 

The following ground support is typical for most new development and production 
areas at Greens Creek: 

• Split sets 6 ft in length are installed on a 4 ft by 4 ft pattern in the back and 
ribs.  Galvanized split sets are used for all development headings and other 
areas which will be open for longer than six months.  Plain steel split sets are 
used in short-term production areas. 

• Swellex bolts are installed on a 5 ft by 6 ft pattern in the back unless a higher 
density is specified due to unusual ground conditions.  The length of the 
Swellex is dependent upon the heading width.  Swellex are not installed 
when mining underneath backfill 

• Galvanized wire mesh is used in long-term openings and plain steel in short-
range production areas unless otherwise specified.  Mesh is installed on the 
back and ribs to within 7 ft of the mine floor. 

• Main haulage ramps and other life-of-mine excavations are supported by 
fully-grouted rebar bolts which are installed in campaigns after development 
of the ramp segment has been completed.  This provides very long-term 
corrosion-resistant ground support.  Rebar bolts of 6 ft length are installed 
on a 4 ft by 4 ft spacing in the back and ribs in addition to rebar bolts of 8 ft 
length installed on a 5 ft by 6 ft spacing in the back. 

Cable bolts and wet-process shotcrete are applied as required to support occasional 
areas of large span or poor ground.  Shotcrete is also applied to areas of permanent 
infrastructure as well as muckbays and loading areas in order to minimize damage 
to the wire mesh caused by inadvertent scraping with the mucker bucket. 

Greens Creek experiences areas of corrosion of ground support due to the galvanic 
process involving the steel, sulfides, graphite and atmospheric conditions.  The 
argillite, especially with elevated sulfide and/or graphite content, is particularly 
aggressive to steel. Thin walled friction bolts, such as Swellex or split sets, are 
susceptible because of the large surface area in contact with the ground and minimal 
thickness.  Corrosion can occur inside the bolt (away from the collar) and not be 
observable. The result can be an unanticipated ground failure because the load 
carrying capacity of the system degrades over time.  

  



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 238  

To mitigate issues with ground support corrosion, current Greens Creek practice is 
to install galvanized ground support in areas which will be open for longer than six 
months.  Very long-term openings (such as LOM haulage ramps and other 
infrastructure excavations) are bolted with fully-grouted rebar bolts which provide a 
high degree of corrosion resistance. Greens Creek also has an active rock bolt pull 
testing program. 

A variety of historical ground support systems are still in place throughout the mine 
due to the large extent of haulage ramp which was developed prior to the 
implementation of current ground support standards.  Certain older areas are 
supported primarily by split sets and steel mats.  The mine has an ongoing rehab 
program and historical areas are progressively being brought to current support 
standards with fully-grouted rebar bolts.  Approximately 25% of haulage ramp is now 
supported with rebar.  Near-term plans include a campaign of cable bolting for 
haulage ramp intersections and other existing areas of wide span. 

16.11 Underground Water Handling 

16.11.1 Background 

Greens Creek is considered to be a dry mine.  The mine is overlain by mountainous 
topography that offers little opportunity to develop a perched water table of 
significant volume.  The average annual precipitation at the 920 ft elevation ranges 
from 67 to 80 inches.  Despite this surface precipitation, the water that is 
continuously pumped out of the mine due to groundwater sources ranges from 
approximately 25 to 50 gpm.   

The ultimate mine depth is planned to extend to approximately 1500 feet beneath 
sea level and the coastline is about 5.5 miles from the mine site.   

The Maki Fault is a major geological feature encountered at the mine.  This fault, 
and sympathetic Maki-like faults, intersect the Greens Creek drainage and provide 
the most probable conduit for water ingress into the mine.  The Maki Fault has been 
intersected on numerous occasions in the mine workings at various orientations and 
elevations.  On at least one occasion it has exhibited high pressure water inflows 
upon exposure.  These inflows bled off quickly. 

16.11.2 Pumping and Discharge System 

The mine features a large number of small local water collection sumps into which 
drill water and groundwater collected at the face is pumped.  Water from these local 
sumps is then pumped into one of the four main sumps located in the 920 Main, the 
45 Ramp, the 460 XC, and the PD480 ramp. The main sumps each include multiple 
bays which allow slimes to settle.  The water is then decanted and pumped out of 
the mine to the 920 water treatment plant (see section 18.6.1).  The slimes are 
mucked using an LHD and gobbed underground. 

16.11.3 Future Plans 

Groundwater determination prior to stope development is undertaken using a set of 
fanned diamond drill core holes (pre-production holes) that are drilled into the 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 239  

undeveloped mineral resource.  These holes are monitored for artesian pressure 
and if any exists, they are allowed to drain off under controlled conditions by using 
packers and valves.  If the flow is minor, the holes are allowed to free drain. 

Ore has recently been identified at shallower depths of the East Ore Zone above 
elevation 1610.  Definition drilling of this zone has encountered significant 
groundwater with instantaneous flow rates in excess of 400 gpm prior to being 
sealed with a packer.  Greens Creek currently plans to conduct a hydrologic study 
of this area to better define flow rates and recharge rates, as well as the best control 
methods.   

If recharge rates are high, this water may need to be controlled with a campaign of 
pre-grouting prior to development of the new mineral reserves.  Limiting water inflow 
is important both to facilitate mining and to prevent an increase to the rate of water 
ingress post-closure, which could increase long-term water treatment costs. The 
proportion of mineral reserve tonnage which may be affected by this groundwater is 
very small (approximately 240kt, equivalent to 2.6% of overall mineral reserve). 

16.12 Underground Electrical System 
High-voltage power enters the mine at 4160V from a main switchgear room located 
on surface.  Power is then fed from this switchgear room to three underground 
switchgear rooms which serve separate regions of the mine.  Each underground 
switchgear room in turn feeds a network of mine power centers (MPCs) which reduce 
the voltage to 480V and supply power to local loads (including fans, pumps, and drill 
power). Currently, a fourth switchgear room and high-voltage feed is being installed 
to provide additional capacity for the PD480 ramp area as it advances further away 
from existing infrastructure. 

16.13 Compressed Air System 
The mine compressed air system consists of three 480V compressors located 
underground (Sullair LS-25S 250L @ 250hp ea) and one diesel compressor located 
on surface (Sullair 900 @ 265hp).  Total system capacity is 4,550 cfm.  The 
underground compressor room has a dedicated exhaust fan to the 2853 Raise. 

16.14 Underground Mobile Equipment 
Conventional underground mining equipment is used to support the underground 
mining activities.  This equipment is standard to the industry and has been proven 
on site. Table 16-1 shows the major underground equipment that is currently 
operational at Greens Creek.  Greens Creek currently uses one Sandvik LH514 LHD 
which is capable of semi-autonomous operation as well as one Sandvik LH514 LHD 
which can be operated via a tele-remote system from surface.  This equipment 
enables production activities to continue during the shift change and post-blasting 
periods when no personnel are allowed underground. 

16.15 Maintenance 
Mobile equipment maintenance facilities are located both underground and on 
surface.   Comprehensive maintenance tracking and reporting systems, in addition

to preventive maintenance (PM) programs are well established.  Frame-up rebuilds 
are performed based on engine hours, as recommended by the equipment supplier, 
and/or based on component wear factors.  Major overhauls and rebuilds are often 
done offsite at a contracted facility.

16.16 Mine Plan 

16.16.1 Introduction 

The Greens Creek mineral reserve wireframes have been scheduled using Deswik 
software. The LOM plan is detailed in the following tables. Price assumptions, cutoff 
grade, and all other criteria are the same as applied to Mineral Reserves as 
discussed in Chapter 15.  All data in this section are expressed in US-Imperial units.  
Figure 16-7 and Tables 16-2 and 16-3 show the planned mine production and 
development over the LOM.  

16.16.2 Ore Scheduling Criteria 

The goal of the LOM plan is to create an operationally-feasible schedule which 
maintains a production rate of 2300 tons per day (840 kt/yr) for as long as possible 
while maximizing near-term grades in order to optimize NPV.  A secondary objective 
is to minimize and smooth near-term development requirements. 

Ore drifting advance rates for cut-and-fill mining and longhole top/bottom cut 
development are typically no more than 4.0 ft/day per face.  This is a relatively slow 
advance rate which allows ample time for geological mapping and sampling in order 
to maintain a high level of grade control due to the geometric complexity of the 
mineral body.  Scheduled advance rates are reduced when drifting size is 
significantly larger than normal (for example, many longhole top/bottom cuts are 25 
ft wide and therefore scheduled at 2.5 ft/day per face). 

Towards the end of the mine life there are insufficient ore faces to maintain 2300 tpd 
at a 4.0 ft/day advance rate per face.  Therefore in 2027 the maximum ore advance 
rate is increased to 5.0 ft/day per face, followed in 2028 by a second increase to 6.0 
ft/day per face.  This is achievable for the following reasons: 

• With fewer available ore faces, additional mining resources can be applied 
to each face. 

• Most of the ore to be mined near the end of the mine life will be remnants of 
levels which have been active for significant lengths of time.  Mining will take 
place above, below and/or adjacent to previously mined panels.  These areas 
are therefore well-defined with a large amount of geologic mapping and face 
sampling data, reducing the need for extensive mapping and sampling to 
maintain grade control on advance. 

• An advance rate of 6.0 ft/day is in line with industry norms for similar mines. 

Target longhole production is 300 tpd until all longhole stopes are depleted.  From 
an operational perspective, longhole tonnage is used to smooth the day-to-day 
variations in cut-and-fill production.  Current Greens Creek practice is to maintain at 
least one shot longhole available to be mucked to make up for any short-term cut 
and fill production shortfall.

16.16.3 Scheduling Criteria - Backfill 

Overall backfill rates are scheduled at a placement rate of 600 tons per day per 
backfill heading.  Planned total monthly backfill tonnages are aligned with historic 
actuals for a production rate of 2,300 tons of ore per day.  It is assumed that 75% of 
the volume of mined void each month will require cemented backfill, of which two-



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine

March 2019 243  

thirds is placed as paste fill and one-third is placed as jam fill with cemented tailings.  
Waste fill is assumed to be the lesser of 7,300 tons per month or the total monthly 
production of #2-4 (acid-generating) development waste.  All #1 (inert) development 
waste is assumed to be hauled to surface since it is required for use as drystack 
capping material. 

A delay of three days is assumed between the completion of mining in a heading 
and the beginning of backfill to allow for final mapping & surveying, heading cleanup, 
removal of utilities and installation of paste pipe. 

16.16.4 Scheduling Criteria - Development 

Lateral development is broken into two categories – capital and expensed: 

   

Capital Development (typically driven at 16 ft width x 17.5 ft height) 

• Haulage ramps 
• Ore access drives (POA – primary ore access) 
• Definition drilling drifts 
• Raise accesses  
• Other infrastructure excavations 

Expensed Development (typically driven at 15 ft width x 15 ft height) 

• In-Stope waste drives (between ore bands on a production level) 
• Secondary ore access development (breasting down of an ore access drive 

to reach a higher elevation and access ore above a previously-mined level) 

Expensed development is scheduled at a maximum advance rate of 4.0 ft/day per 
face.  Capital development is scheduled at a maximum advance rate of 3.5 ft/day 
per face due to the slightly larger heading profile.  These maximums rates stay 
constant throughout the mine life. Because mine development is undertaken by the 
same crews and equipment as mine production, development faces are typically 
advanced at relatively low rates in a stop-start fashion when mining resources are 
available and not required for production activities. 

Vertical development is achieved via raiseboring and is undertaken by a contractor.  
Most vertical development remaining in the mine plan consists of paired sets of 
raises: an 8ft diameter bald ventilation raise adjacent to a 42-in diameter escapeway 
raise lined with laddertube. Vertical advance rates are scheduled at 4.0 ft/d to 
account for mobilization, setup, piloting, and laddertube installation in addition to the 
actual raisebore excavation.

access) [2] 

2021 

• Breakthrough of the PD480 ramp to the M790 exploration drift, establishing 
several new high-grade production levels in the 200S Zone [3] 

2022 

• Initiation of East Ore 29 Up-Ramp development after completion of 
hydrologic study (see section 16.11) [4] 

• Development of a second 59 Drift bypass in order to enable access to Upper 
Plate mineral reserves in proximity to the 59 infrastructure drift [5] 

2023 

• Completion of the M790 exploration drift, a key drilling platform for the most 
prospective remaining untested geology in proximity to the mine [6] 

2024 

• PD480 ramp reaches the bottom of the 200S body.  Mining begins of the 
deepest mineral reserves at Greens Creek: 1410ft below sea level, 
approximately 4600ft below surface topography [7] 

• Initiation of Gallagher Zone ramp development [8] 
2025 

• Completion of the East-Ore Up-Ramp 
• Depletion of longhole mineral reserves

16.16.7 Mine Plan Optimization 

The Greens Creek mine plan was optimized in 2018 with the goal of reducing 
required development footage and achieving earlier access to higher-grade ore.  All 
planned development was redesigned and optimized, with large reductions to 
development footage including the removal of a major ramp system after it was 
determined that the targeted material could be accessed via crosscuts developed 
from existing workings. 

The new mine plan results in a declining grade profile, with the highest-grade mineral 
reserves mined earlier in the mine life in order to optimize NPV.  Previous mine plans 
had a relatively flat grade profile over the mine life, with an increase near the very 
end caused by mining of high-grade material that was unable to be extracted earlier 
due to proximity of critical mine infrastructure (see discussion of "59 Bypass" in 
Section 16.16.6). 

Due to the optimization of development designs, the new mine plan displays 
relatively consistent yearly development footage requirements over the mine life.  
Previous plans required higher rates of capital development which were heavily 
front-loaded during the first few years of the remaining mine life. 

16.16.8 Mine Plan Discussion 

A large proportion of Greens Creek mineral reserves are at locations in proximity to 
existing haulage ramps.  Approximately 80% of mineral reserve tonnage either 
already has an access developed or can be accessed with a relatively short cross-
cut from an existing ramp.  These ramps are actively used as haulageways and 
ventilation airflow routes and are maintained in good condition. 

This results in less development schedule risk to mine production.  New haulage 
ramps are continuously advanced in order to provide access to higher-grade ore, 
particularly in the deeper areas of the mine.  However, if this development falls 
behind schedule, new ore headings can be established by driving short ore access 
drifts from existing haulage ramps, ensuring sufficient working areas to achieve 
target production tonnage. 

This situation is due to the large amount of historical ramp development which was 
done at much lower metal prices, resulting in a large amount of current mineral 
reserve tonnage that was accessible but left behind as uneconomic by previous 
mining.  In recent years, significant amounts of ore have also been located in 
proximity to existing ramps.  This material had not been discovered previously due 
to limited exploration drilling budgets during periods of lower metal prices. 

Ore production is sourced from a number of different mineral zones throughout every 
year of the mine life.  This reduces the potential for equipment congestion or 
infrastructure bottlenecks in any one zone.  Tonnage from the 200S Zone never 
exceeds 30% of overall production in any given year.  The 200S Zone is the deepest 
zone in the mine and limiting tonnage from this area to a reasonable proportion of 
overall production is desirable to keep average haulage distances from increasing 
significantly which could require additional trucking capacity.

16.17 Comments on Mining Methods 
In the opinion of the QP: 

• The mining methods used are appropriate to the deposit style and employ 
conventional mining tools and mechanization; 

• The LOM plan has been appropriately developed to maximize mining 
efficiencies, based on the current knowledge of geotechnical, hydrological, 
mining and processing information on the Project; 

• The equipment and infrastructure requirements required for life-of-mine 
operations are well understood.  Conventional underground mining 
equipment is used to support the underground mining activities. 

• The underground equipment fleet is standard to the industry and has been 
proven on site.  Numerous key units have recently been replaced or 
overhauled as part of the mobile equipment rebuild/replacement schedule. 

• The predicted mine life to 2030 is achievable based on the projected annual 
production rate and the Mineral Reserves estimated.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Flow Sheet 
The Greens Creek mill produces three saleable flotation concentrates and a gravity 
concentrate. A carbon concentrate is produced as part of the process but is 
discarded as part of tailings. 

A gravity circuit utilizing spiral concentrators treats a bleed stream from the grinding 
circuit cyclones. It produces a final gravity concentrate that is further processed off-
site. Lead concentrate is produced in a rougher-cleaner circuit with re-grinding of the 
cleaner feed. The lead concentrate is relatively low grade, at approximately 35% 
lead, but carries a large proportion of the silver in mill feed. 

Zinc concentrate is produced in a rougher-cleaner circuit, also with re-grinding, using 
lead rougher tailings as feed. The zinc concentrate typically contains 46 to 50% zinc, 
which is a normal grade, and considerably less silver than the lead concentrate. 

Bulk concentrate is produced in a complex circuit which has as feed cleaner tailings 
from both the lead and zinc circuits. It is a relatively low-grade zinc concentrate, at 
30% zinc, with a smaller amount of lead and some silver. Bulk concentrate has a 
relatively limited market so lead and zinc concentrates production is preferred over 
that of bulk. 

A mill flowsheet is shown as Figure 17-1. 

17.2 Plant Description 
Mined ore is delivered to the mill stockpile near the portal by underground haulage 
trucks. It is dumped into a "build" stockpile, which is regularly blended by the pad 
operator using either a loader or bulldozer. The pad operator at the same time uses 
the loader to feed the mill feed bin with material from the immediately adjacent "mill 
feed" stockpile, which consists of ore that has been previously delivered and 
blended. The mill feed stockpile is used until it is exhausted, at which point the build 
stockpile is designated the "mill feed" pile and is used to feed the mill. 

The old mill feed area then becomes the build stockpile area and mine haulage is 
henceforth dumped there for blending. The two stockpile areas are thus alternated 
between the build and mill feed roles. A fresh mill feed stockpile can vary in size 
between as little as 1,000 tons (907 tonnes) to as much as 15,000 tons (13,608 
tonnes) and so have a feed life ranging from less than a day to several days, 
depending on relative mine production rates and mill feed rates.

A Caterpillar 980 loader is used to transfer blended material to a fixed grizzly with 
15-in (38-cm) square apertures located above a dump pocket with a 60-ton, 35-
minute capacity. A hydraulic rock-breaker is used to break the small volume of 
oversize and a 48-in (122-cm) apron feeder is used to regulate the flow of grizzly 
undersize material onto a 48-in (122-cm) belt feeding the semi-autogenous grind 
(SAG) mill. The apron feeder speed is controlled to maintain target SAG mill feed 
rate of 85–110 wet tons/h (77– 100 tonnes) based on the feed belt weightometer 
output. A 16 x 5-ft (4.9 x 4.5-m) Marcy SAG mill is operated in closed circuit with a 
primary vibrating screen with 10-mm apertures. 

17.2.1 Secondary Grinding 

Primary screen undersize gravitates to the ball mill cyclone feed box where it 
combines with the discharge from the 900 hp 11 x 13-ft (3.3 x 4-m) Marcy overflow 
ball mill, before being pumped to a cluster of five 10-in (25-cm) diameter Warman 
Cavex cyclones. Two-inch diameter forged steel balls are added to maintain a target 
mill power draw of 600 kW. Four cyclones are usually in operation at 2,300 tons per 
day (2,087 tonnes/day); with the underflow from one cyclone being diverted through 
the gravity circuit for free gold recovery prior to return to the cyclone feed pumpbox. 
Cyclone overflow at 48 to 54% solids has a particle size range of 80% passing 70–
85 µm and 95% passing 140 to 160 µm. Liberation of flotation feed is sufficient for 
recovery to low grade rougher concentrates, but not for production of final 
concentrates, which requires re-grinding prior to the cleaner circuits. 

17.2.2 Gravity Circuit 

A gravity circuit is operated to improve overall gold recovery. Two banks of eight 
double-start spirals are installed for roughing, with a single bank of two double-start 
spirals for open circuit first-stage cleaning. First stage cleaner spiral concentrates 
report to a second stage single-start cleaning spiral to produce a final gravity 
concentrate. 

The final gravity concentrate is passed through a vibrating screen to remove 
relatively coarse (plus 30 mesh) material from the finer product comprising most of 
the gravity concentrate. The coarse fraction contains a significant amount of tramp 
copper wire fragments, which tend to interfere with off-site processing by intensive 
cyanidation. It is planned to treat the relatively small volume of coarse materially 
separately, simplifying and improving the treatment of the fine fraction. 

The final gravity concentrate is collected and stored in barrels to be shipped to an 
off-site toll facility where it is treated using intensive cyanidation to produce precious 
metals. The gravity concentrates typically recover roughly 15-20% of the gold in mill 
feed and less than 1% of the silver. 

17.3 Flotation Circuits 
All flotation is carried out in conventional Outokumpu mechanical flotation cells, 
unless otherwise noted. 

Cyclone overflow is diluted to a range of 52% to 45% solids before gravitating to a 
carbon flotation circuit that consists of one 8-ft (2.4-m) diameter column.  This 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 256  

column removes naturally-floatable material such as graphite, carbonaceous pyrite 
and layer silicates (primarily clays and talc) from the mill feed and direct it to final 
tailings. 

The first lead circuit flotation takes place at a pH of 8.5 in one 7-ft (2.1-m) diameter 
column.  The concentrate from this column is high enough grade to be sent to the 
overall lead concentrate as a "scalped" lead concentrate product that is combined 
with the lead cleaner concentrate.   

Zinc depression in the lead circuit is accomplished by pH control accompanied with 
the use of zinc sulfate in lead roughers. Zinc sulfate is used in the lead cleaners for 
both zinc and iron depression. Lead rougher tailings are conditioned with lime and 
then copper sulfate ahead of zinc roughing. 

Lead roughing takes place at a target pH of 8.0 to 8.5 in banks of three 300-ft3 (8.5-
m3) conventional flotation cells each followed by two 20-m3 tank cells. Carbon dioxide 
is added to the SAG mill, cyclone overflow, and lead rougher conditioner to stabilize 
the pH of the lead rougher. A low-grade 20% Pb–18% Zn lead rougher concentrate 
is reground to 80% passing 20 µm with a tower mill, and then cleaned at a pH of 7.2 
in ten 100-ft3 (2.8 m3) cells. 

The lead cleaning circuit comprises three stages in closed circuit. Several options 
have been installed on the lead cleaning circuit.  There are options to run the circuit 
as a three-stage cleaner or as a two-stage cleaner plus scavenger. Lead cleaner 
tailings are sent to the lead cleaner scavenger rougher cells at a pH of 7.2 to 7.5. 
The lead cleaner scavenger rougher concentrate is cleaned in closed circuit and 
returned to the lead cleaners. Lead cleaner scavenger rougher tailings report as feed 
to the zinc–bulk rougher circuit by way of the swing cell circuit which are three 
Woodgrove cells. 

The lead cleaner scavenger tailings report to a conditioner tank where pH is raised 
to 10.5 using lime and copper sulfate is added to activate the zinc for flotation.  This 
material is then pumped to the swing cells which consist of three 3-ft diameter x 10-
ft tall Woodgrove SFR flotation cells in series.  The concentrate from the swing cells 
is added to the zinc rougher concentrate to report to the zinc cleaner circuit and keep 
as much zinc as possible in the zinc circuit.  The swing cells tailings the reports to 
the bulk flotation circuit to recover as much valuable mineral that remains into the 
bulk concentrate.  

Zinc roughing is carried out at a pH between 10.0 and 10.5 in a 7-ft diameter x 30-ft 
high (2.1 x 9-m) zinc rougher column, followed by five 300-ft3 (8.5-m3) cells in series 
with three 100-ft3 (2.8-m3) cells.  Zinc rougher tailings form the majority of the final 
tailings flow. 

Rougher concentrate is reground to 80% passing 20 µm with a tower mill before 
being fed to three-stage zinc cleaning at a pH of 10.5 to11.0. Zinc cleaner tailings 
join the swing cell tailings to feed the 7-ft diameter x 30-ft high (2.1 x 9-m) bulk 
rougher column, the tailings from which feed nine 10-ft3 (2.8-m3) bulk rougher cells. 
Bulk rougher tailings are directed to final tailings, while bulk rougher concentrate is 
cleaned once in three 100-ft3 (2.8-m3) cells in closed circuit with the rougher to 
produce final bulk concentrate.  Zinc cleaner cell capacity can be redistributed from 
three stages to two stages of cleaning during periods of high-zinc head grades.

17.3.1 Reagents 

Reagents are distributed throughout the grinding and flotation circuits by means of 
head tanks and computerized solenoids for xanthate, copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, 
3413 and MIBC reagents.   Carbon dioxide is added to the circuit by way of 
carbonated water that is formed by introducing gaseous carbon dioxide to water 
under controlled pressure and flow.  This carbonated water is then added as the 
main source of water for SAG mill grinding and density control feeding flotation in 
the cyclone overflow.  This is also added to the lead regrind circuit to control pH in 
the lead cleaner cells.  There is also an addition to the lead rougher condition in 
which gaseous carbon dioxide is introduced to the bottom of a slurry tank by sparger 
for fine pH control.    

17.3.2 Dewatering 

Lead, bulk, and zinc concentrates and final tailings are pumped to their separate 
thickeners, which are respectively 30 ft, 20 ft, 30 ft, and 60 ft in diameter (10 m, 6 m, 
10 m, and 20 m). All thickeners have been retrofitted with high-capacity auto dilution 
feedwells. 

Thickener underflows are pumped by Warman variable speed horizontal spindle 
pumps or Denver diaphragm pumps at 65 to 70% solids to individual stock tanks and 
into Sala filter presses using high pressure Warman pumps. Thickener underflows 
are fully instrumented for flow, density and pressure to allow thickener inventory 
control and to eliminate sanding problems. 

There are three tailings filters, a zinc filter and a shared lead/bulk filter. Filter cake 
produced from these filters falls into the appropriate bin below the filter. These filter 
cakes are the final concentrate products and tailings from the milling operation. 

17.4 Product/Materials Handling 
All three flotation concentrates, as well as the final tailings, are thickened and filtered 
to approximately 10% moisture. Storage capacity at the mill is limited and all 
products are hauled to longer-term storage on a daily basis, using highway-type 
trucks. 

Concentrates are separately hauled and stored to a storage–loadout facility at Hawk 
Inlet, approximately eight miles (10 km) from the mine. At the Hawk Inlet facility, they 
are stored indoors in piles until being loaded periodically into ocean-going ships for 
transport to a variety of smelters. 

Tailings are sent to the surface batch plant as required by the needs of the mine for 
underground backfill. Remaining tailings are hauled daily to the tailings repository 
approximately seven miles from the mill for final storage. Tailings sent to the batch 
plant are fed to a pug mill, into which cement is also added, for thorough blending 
before being discharged to a hopper. Underground mine trucks haul the tailings 
backfill either directly to a heading for use as conventional backfill or to the 
underground paste plant. At the underground paste plant, tailings backfill is blended 
with water and the resulting slurry pumped to headings for use as paste backfill. 

Overflow from the three concentrate thickeners and the tailings thickeners is sent to

one of two water treatment plants. One plant is rated to treat 400 gpm and the other 
800 gpm, but otherwise the plants are similar. Ferric chloride and flocculants are 
added to treatment plant feed water to coagulate and flocculate fine solids particles. 
Solution pH is adjusted, as needed, by lime.  The flocculated solids are allowed to 
settle out in settling tanks and are then sent to tailings. The overflow is used for mill 
process purposes or sent to the site water treatment plant via pipeline.

The Greens Creek Mine is allowed by permit to withdraw 700 gallons per minute of 
fresh water from Greens Creek. This provides the fresh water to the entire site, 
including the mine and potable water system, with approximately 520 gpm of fresh 
water being available for mill use. However, the mill requires approximately 1,600 
gpm of total water to operate. The difference between the fresh water and total water 
required for the mill is made up using recycled water. Some process recycle water 
is taken directly from the tailings thickener overflow, with the balance supplied by 
treated mill discharge water. 

The mill requires approximately 4.8 MW of power to operate at full capacity. 

17.6 Production and Recovery Forecasts 
The Greens Creek LOM production plan for the mill assumes similar throughputs, 
recoveries, and concentrate grades to those achieved in recent years, based on

17.7 Comments on Recovery Method 
The process plant is operational, and there is 29 years of production history that 
allows for a reasonable assessment of plant performance in a production setting. 
Metallurgical and production models were developed from extensive baseline 
sampling and are further adjusted annually to account for process and metallurgical 
improvements and changes.  The QP has reviewed the methodologies used and the 
data uses and considers the projection process and methods used are unbiased and 
provide sound projections.

The QP has reviewed the information in this section provided by Hecla and considers 
that there are no data or assumptions in the LOM plan that are significantly different 
from previous plant operating experience, previous production throughputs and 
recoveries, or the Project background history. 

In the opinion of the QP, the current process facilities are appropriate to the 
mineralization types provided from the mine. The flowsheet, equipment and 
infrastructure are expected to support the current life-of-mine plan.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Roadways 
Two mine roads link the Young Bay and the Hawk Inlet sites with the mine/mill site.  
A five-mile long, 18-foot wide road ("A Road") allows transport of personnel from the 
Young Bay dock to Hawk Inlet.  An 8.5-mile, 20-foot wide road ("B Road) allows 
transport of personnel, supplies, and concentrate between Hawk Inlet and the 
mine/mill site, as well as transport of dry tailings from the mine/mill site to the tailings 
disposal facility (TDF).  Several borrow pits lie along the roadways. 

Hecla's policy for travel on these single-lane roads with turnouts requires that all 
employees and contractors maintain radio contact during transit.  Limited public 
access to the road system is allowed. The roads are occasionally used by hunters 
who access Admiralty Island via private boat. 

18.2 Mine Layout 
The major infrastructure areas (Figure 18-1) supporting operations at Greens Creek 
include the 920/860 Area, Site 23, Hawk Inlet, TDF Area, Young Bay dock, 13 miles 
of connecting roadways, a power intertie connecting Greens Creek to the Juneau 
area power grid, and various pipelines and outfalls for wastewater and stormwater. 

The 920 Area is located adjacent to the main portal at the 920-foot elevation or 
approximately eight road miles from the tidewater facilities located at Hawk Inlet.  
Located at the 920 Area are the mill, backfill batch plant, power-house, water 
treatment plants, surface maintenance shop, main warehouse, administrative 
offices, and fuel storage tanks.  There is also a summer-only road to the 1350 
exhaust portal.   

The 860 Area, which is immediately adjacent to the 920 Area, has additional office 
buildings, assay laboratory, and core-logging facilities.  Site 23, which is adjacent to 
the 860 Area or approximately 0.2 miles from the 920 Area, is the active waste rock 
storage facility and includes a helipad and shotcrete batch plant. 

The dry stack tailings disposal facility (TDF) includes all the tailings produced to date 
that have not been placed as backfill underground.  Ponds 7 and 10 and a 2500 
GMP industrial wastewater treatment plant are located at the TDF Area. 

Support facilities at Hawk Inlet include core storage; concentrate storage; a deep-
water port that accommodates cargo ships, freight barges and fuel barges; 
warehouse; sanitary sewer and potable water treatment; fuel storage; and camp 
housing. 

The Young Bay facility consists solely of a boat dock for the crew transport ferry that 
runs twice daily from Juneau, parking for buses, and a generator for powering 
lighting.

18.3 Tailings Disposal Facilities 
The mill at the Greens Creek Mine generates approximately 1,800 dry tons of filter-
pressed tailings per day, or approximately 650,000 tons annually. These tailings are 
dewatered in a filter press at the mill, with about 50% of the tailings being mixed with 
cement and hauled back into the underground mine for disposal in mined-out areas 
as backfill.  

The remaining 50% of the tailings are transported from the mill on the B Road using 
covered 45-ton haul trucks to a surface tailings disposal facility (TDF) located near 
Hawk Inlet.  

At the TDF, tailings are end dumped and placed using bulldozers. The tailings are 
placed and compacted in lifts in a manner to minimize surface infiltration and 
promote runoff.   

Leachate is contained using a system of geomembrane liners, cutoff walls, and 
above- and below-liner drainage systems. Surface water is managed via a system 
of lined ditches and culverts.  Outside slopes are capped with carbonate-rich mine 
development rock (argillite or type 1) to protect against erosion and to provide 
geochemical buffering capacity for the potentially acid-generating tailings. 

The TDF has undergone multiple staged, incremental expansions as the Greens 
Creek mine life has been extended over time. The "Stage 3" expansion was recently 
completed which will accommodate projected mine tailings storage requirements 
through the end of the mine life in 2030. Early-stage engineering studies are 
underway to determine modifications to the plan of operations in order to 
accommodate additional material beyond the current Greens Creek mineral reserve 
life.  

The following items are monitored at the TDF: 

• surface and ground water quality; 

• water levels with wells and piezometers; 

• geochemical properties of the tailings; 

• geotechnical stability; and  

• aquatic biology in several small, adjacent creeks.

18.4 Mine Development Rock Disposal Facilities 
The current development rock storage area is Site 23 located 1,100 feet west of the 
920-mine site.  It is used to store potentially acid-generating mine development rock 
which cannot be used for capping tailings (see Section 18.3).  Site 23 currently has 
a total capacity of 2.1 million tons and is expected to reach this capacity in early 
2021 based on the planned mine development schedule.   

At this time several options are being evaluated to optimize the development of Site 
23 within approved boundaries to provide additional storage for development rock. 
Once the capacity of Site 23 is exhausted, development rock can be hauled to the 
TDF and/or used to backfill abandoned access ramps underground.   

Ultimately, the material stored at Site 23 will be hauled underground during 
reclamation activities.  This material will fill most of the void left by mine access 
ramps and other workings. 

Historic development rock storage areas are found primarily at two locations: 

• Site D, immediately down slope of Site 23 and  
• Site E, located at mile marker 4.6 on the B Road, approximately half the road 

distance between Hawk Inlet and the mine portal.   

Site E is currently undergoing a multi-year removal and reclamation effort.  The 
material from Site E is disposed of with tailings at the TDF. 

18.5 Stockpiles 
In addition to Site E, discussed in Section 18.4, reclamation material storage 
stockpiles are located at various points along the haul road (B Road) connecting the 
920 Area and Hawk Inlet.

18.6 Water Supply 

18.6.1 920 Water System 

The 920-water system draws up to 700 gallons per minute (GPM) from Greens 
Creek via three intake screens in stream bed for use in the mill and the mine. This 
water is referred to as fresh water.  Fresh water is pumped to a head tank at elevation 
1160 feet or directly to the mill.   

Two discharge pipelines are installed in the head tank providing gravity flow for the 
fresh and fire water systems.  The fire water pipeline is installed in the bottom of the 
1160 head tank.  The fresh water pipe line is installed above the fire water pipeline 
allowing storage for the firewater system. 

Up to 10 GPM is pulled from the fresh water and is filtered, chlorinated, and stored 
in three tanks totaling 28,000 gallons for potable water. 

18.6.2 Hawk Inlet Water System 

Water infiltrates from Cannery Creek into two caisson-type wet wells: 

• Caisson no. 1 pumped/gravity feed to the Hawk Inlet storage/fire tanks and 
• Wet well 18 pumped feed to the TDF wheel wash area supply tank.  

The withdrawal from Cannery Creek is limited to 104,000 gpd.  Control of each 
system is based on demand and corresponding storage tank levels.  

Water from caisson no. 1 is pumped to three 20,000-gallon tanks located outside the 
Hawk Inlet water utilities building.  Of this initial 60,000 gallons, 45,000 gallons are 
reserved for the fire suppression systems.  Water demand by the camp facilities, 
wash down and domestic uses is drawn from these storage tanks.  These tanks also 
supply the potable water filtration system where fresh water is filtered, chlorinated 
and stored in a fourth 20,000-gallon tank before distribution in the Hawk Inlet camp. 

18.7 Water Management 
Greens Creek is in a maritime environment and receives considerable precipitation 
(refer to Section 5.2).  Non-contact water is diverted from the site by upland ditches 
and drains and discharge to the numerous fresh water courses found adjacent to the 
site.   

Management of contact water is undertaken to protect the environment. Contact 
water includes the following: 

• water withdrawn from Greens Creek and Cannery Creek; 
• stormwater, and; 
• ground water from underdrain systems, curtain drains, and collected seeps. 

The following flow chart displays the current water management system at Greens 
Creek. Note that all contact water reports to Ponds 7 and 10 collectively referred to 
as Pond 7/10.

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 274  

18.7.1 920 Area Water Management 

All water collected and/or used at the 920 Area is ultimately piped to Pond 7/10 at 
the TDF, and from there is treated by the TDF water treatment plant (TDF WTP) 
prior to discharge into Hawk Inlet.  

Underground discharge water is sent to the mill where it is combined with tails 
thickener discharge and sent to the two 920 water treatment plants (920 WTP) and 
ultimately piped to Pond 7/10. 

Contact Water 

The main objective of the 920 Area stormwater systems is to protect the environment 
by controlling contact water at the site for treatment.  The stormwater system at the 
920 Area mill site is in place to route, contain, treat, store, recycle and export 
stormwater from the mine and mill site.  

Water is routed through the system as follows: 

1. site collection ditches and lift stations to sediment removal basins; 

2. detention Pond A; and 

3. to mill for recycling or Pond 7/10 via pipelines buried adjacent to the B Road. 

In general, all water considered "contact" water is contained at the 920 Area and 
eventually treated at the TDF WTP.  Surface water conveyance systems at the 920 
Area are designed to handle a 10 year/24-hour storm event.   

Water Treatment 

Two chemical precipitation plants (CPPs) are used to treat wastewater and are 
configured and designed to route water back to the mill or to Pond 7/10. 

Site 23 Water Management 

All water collected and/or used at the 860 and Site 23 area is ultimately piped to 
Pond 7/10 at the TDF, and from there is treated by the TDF water treatment plant 
(TDF WTP) prior to discharge into Hawk Inlet.   

Pond D receives water from run-off and the Site D curtain drain system.  This water 
is generally recycled for use in the mill but can be routed to Pond 23 as needed. 
Pond 23 receives stormwater from Site 23 curtain drains and discharge from Pond 
A, Pond D, and Pond C. Water from Pond 23 reports to Pond 7/10. 

18.7.2 TDF & Hawk Inlet Water Management 

Hawk Inlet Contact Water 

The Hawk Inlet system routes, stores, collects and exports water to the TDF area 
for additional treatment and ultimate discharge. 

Contact water is received from the following sources: 

• hawk Inlet stormwater drainage; 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 275  

• hawk Inlet wheel wash facility; 
• wash-down from concentrate storage and ship loader; and 
• treated and disinfected domestic sewage treatment effluent. 

These waters report to de-gritting basin number DB-04, where the heaviest material 
settles out.  Flows are then routed by gravity to the stormwater wet well (integral to 
the wheel wash building), where it is pumped to Pond 7/10 for additional treatment 
at the TDF WTP and ultimate discharge to seawater through the APDES outfall 002 
located in Hawk Inlet. 

TDF Contact Water 

A series of perimeter ditches at the TDF capture surface contact water from 
precipitation. All surface flows report to Pond 7/10. A series of complex underdrains 
exist throughout the TDF and at Pond 7/10. All underdrains gravity flow to perimeter 
ditches or lift stations referred to as wet wells. Water is pumped from the wet wells 
to perimeter ditches or via pipes to Pond 7/10. 

TDF Water Treatment Plant 

All waste, contact, and process water from the 920, 860, Site 23, Hawk Inlet Facility, 
and the TDF areas ultimately report to Pond 7/10.  Pond 7/10 stores water before 
treatment in the TDF WTP.  It provides surge protection for stormwater flows.  It is 
designed to handle the 25-year / 24-hour storm site wide.  Pond 7/10 has a total 
capacity of 66.66-acre feet. Water collected in Pond 7/10 is pumped to the TDF 
WTP, which is a chemical precipitation plant (CPP).  Effluent water (post treatment) 
is discharged to Hawk inlet via APDES outfall 002. 

18.8 Power and Electrical 
The mine's electrical power needs are met by utilizing a combination of two sources. 
The primary source is from purchased power generated by the local Juneau power 
utility.  The Juneau power grid is connected to the Greens Creek grid by an undersea 
cable and a 13-mile-long 69 kV aerial power line.  This power is generated by 
hydroelectric dams and is available to Greens Creek except when reservoir levels 
fall below predetermined limits. 

The secondary source is on-site diesel-powered generation.  This system includes 
two separate power-houses that contain nine generating units capable of producing 
11.25 MW.  The on-site generators include a mixture of reciprocating and turbine 
generators. 

18.9 Concentrate Handling 
Concentrates are transported from the mill to Hawk Inlet using the same 45-ton 
trucks that are used for transporting tailings.  The Hawk Inlet facilities include an 
approximately 30,000-ton capacity concentrate storage building located near 
tidewater.  Concentrates are loaded onto bulk transport ships using a covered 
telescoping conveyor.

18.10 Fuel 
Fuel arrives at the Hawk Inlet port facility by ocean barges that serve southeast 
Alaska.  It is pumped directly into a 200,000-gallon storage tank that is equipped 
with full spillage containment.  The fuel is then delivered by 9,500-gallon tanker 
trailers to the 920 Area fuel storage area, which consists of three fully contained 
tanks yielding a storage capacity of approximately 156,000 gallons. 

When electricity is supplied by the local utility intertie, fuel is delivered at one to two- 
month intervals as needed.  When the mine is required to operate the diesel 
generators to supply power to the site approximately 150,000 gallons is delivered 
weekly. 

18.11 Other Supplies 
All supplies are delivered to the Hawk Inlet port facility via freight barge.  Supplies 
destined for the 920 area are transported by truck.  Trash, waste and empty shipping 
containers are also loaded back onto barges at the Hawk Inlet port.  Both Hawk Inlet 
and the 920 area have warehouse facilities for material storage and handling.  
Aggregates are delivered to Hawk Inlet by barge and are stockpiled at various 
locations throughout the mine site. 

18.12 Communications 
Corporate communications on the Greens Creek mine site are handled over fiber-
optic cables, leased from GCI Communication Corp, utilizing voice-over-internet-
protocol technology.   

Process control management is accomplished over an internal Ethernet system 
utilizing both fiber optic and Cat5 communications.  The internal fiber optic system 
extends into the mine and is utilized to monitor/control fan systems, monitor mine 
gasses, and track equipment and personnel.  A supervisory control and data 
acquisition (SCADA) program is used, allowing remote monitoring and control from 
multiple sites.  A single, site-wide standard is accomplished utilizing "Ignition 
SCADA" software.   

Vehicle safety and emergency reporting and communication are accomplished using 
an island- and mine-wide radio system with dedicated channels for mill operations, 
mine operations, and road operations.  The radio system extends throughout the 
underground mine by use of a leaky feeder system.  Vehicle safety on the surface 
and underground is enhanced with a proximity detection and collision avoidance 
system. 

A hard-wired mine phone system is also installed throughout the mine with direct 
communication to supervisory offices and the medical office.  

In the event of a fiber optic failure, a backup microwave system is in place to ensure 
site safety. Emergency satellite phones are also available at both the Hawk Inlet and 
920 offices.

18.13 Comments on Infrastructure 
In the opinion of the QP, the existing infrastructure is appropriate to support the 
current life-of-mine plan to 2030.   Further work is recommended to advance the 
following: 

• Modifications to the Plan of Operations and engineering that are necessary 
to optimize waste storage capacity at Site 23. 

• Early-stage engineering studies are underway to determine modifications to 
the plan of operations in order to accommodate additional material beyond 
the current Greens Creek mineral reserve life.  The QP recommends this 
continue as planned.  

• Engineering studies to gain an understanding of options for final disposal of 
historic waste rock piles including potential for impoundment in the TDF or 
underground disposal.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Market Studies 
The mine has now been operational for a 30-year period, and continuously 
operational for the last 23 years, and has current contracts in place for concentrate 
sales, doré refining, concentrate transportation, metals hedging, and other goods 
and services required to operate an underground mine. 

19.2 Concentrate Sales, Smelting, and Refining 
Hecla has agreements at typical lead and zinc concentrates industry benchmark 
terms for metal payables, treatment charges and refining charges for concentrates 
produced from the Greens Creek Mine. The major customers in 2018 included, 
Korea Zinc (39.3%), Cliveden (13.6%), Mitsui Mining & Smelting (11.8%), and Teck 
Metals Limited (14.7%). These custom smelters are located in Canada, Japan, 
South Korea and China. Figure 19-1 shows the product sales by country for Greens 
Creek products. 

Figure 19-1: Concentrate Destinations 

 
 

Hecla has had concentrate sales frame contracts in place since the beginning of 
operations in 1989 and these contracts are typical sales contracts in the industry. 
New frame contracts are negotiated at the end of their terms. When surplus tonnage 
is available, spot sales contracts are arranged 6 to12 months in advance of 
shipment.  For all of Hecla's sales contracts, the title and risk of ownership of the 
concentrates transfers either at the load port or discharge port. 

Treatment costs and refining costs vary depending on the concentrate type and the 
destination smelter. Table 19-1 summarizes the average metal payability factors.

Greens Creek concentrates are higher in precious metals content, but lower in lead 
and zinc content than typical lead, zinc and bulk concentrates. With regard to Greens 
Creek's bulk concentrate, this product requires treatment at Imperial Smelting 
Furnaces (ISFs) which are declining in number due to more efficient technologies 
coming on-line. All bulk concentrate tonnage anticipated to be produced at Greens 
Creek is committed to our current frame contract on an evergreen basis.  Hecla has 
also previously delivered bulk concentrate to China and Korea and has those 
relationships in place should it be necessary to place additional bulk concentrate 
tonnage at any time during life-of-mine operations. 

Gravity concentrate is shipped to a processor in Kimberly, ID (Metals Research) for 
treatment through their oxygenated-cyanide leach process. Once treated, Metals 
Research produces doré bars and forwards them to Metalor on Hecla's behalf for 
further refining under a toll refining agreement. Upon receipt of doré bars from 
Greens Creek, Metalor further refines the material and Hecla's pool accounts are 
credited with ounces of gold and silver bullion from this process. The gold bullion is 
sold on a biweekly basis to a large bank at prevailing spot prices.  The silver bullion 
is sold to Metalor on a quarterly basis at prevailing spot prices. 

Lastly, the tailings resulting from the oxygenated-cyanide leach process at Metals 
Research are sent via truck to Teck's smelter in Trail, B.C. on a quarterly basis for 
further processing and eventual disposal. 

19.3 Other Contracts 
A Contract of Affreightment is in place with an international shipping company 
covering the shipments of the lead, zinc and bulk concentrates from the Greens 
Creek port facilities at Hawk Inlet, AK to overseas discharge ports serving the 
smelter customers. The current Contract of Affreightment has a term of two years 
and expires at the end of December 2019. Negotiations are currently underway for 
a new Contract of Affreightment with the same shipping company. 

Hecla utilizes financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to 
changes in prices of zinc, lead, silver, and gold contained in concentrate shipments 
between the time of sale and final settlement.  In addition, we utilize financially-
settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and 
lead (but not silver and gold) contained in our forecasted future concentrate 
shipments. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked-to-
market through earnings each period.

Several other contracts have been utilized for other goods and services required to 
operate an underground mine. Large contracts include lease of office facilities in 
Juneau, lease of a boat dock at Auke Bay, AK for employee parking and boat dock 
facilities, employee marine transportation services for the Greens Creek workforce 
to commute from Auke Bay to Admiralty Island, contract drilling services for surface 
exploration and underground core drilling, camp catering and housekeeping for an 
employee camp facility, barge transportation of supplies and equipment from Seattle 
to Admiralty Island and small float plane and helicopter support. 

A contract is in place with the local Juneau electric utility for any excess hydroelectric 
power not required for the City and Borough of Juneau. 

On occasion, mining contractors are employed for specific mine development 
projects. 

Many supplies contracts are in place with suppliers for purchase of various goods; 
the largest contracts include purchase of fuel, reagents, ground support, and leases 
of mining equipment. 

19.4 Comments on Market Studies and Contracts 
In the opinion of the QP: 

• Hecla is able to market the gravity products, lead, zinc, and bulk concentrates 
produced from the Project; 

• The terms contained within the gravity products and concentrate sales 
contracts are typical and consistent with standard industry practice, and are 
similar to contracts for the supply of doré and concentrates elsewhere in the 
world; 

• Although ISFs are being phased out, which can affect long-term marketing 
of bulk concentrates, Hecla has an existing frame contract in place and 
relationships with other buyers for such concentrates, and it is a reasonable 
expectation that the bulk concentrates will be able to continue to be 
marketed; 

• Metal prices are set by Hecla management and are appropriate to the 
commodity and mine life projections.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Overview 
The land comprising the Greens Creek Mine, inclusive of all Admiralty Island 
facilities, consists of both publicly and privately-owned uplands and tidelands. Hecla 
leases parcels from the United States on both the Monument and non-Monument 
lands. Hecla also uses other public lands pursuant to special use permits issued by 
the USFS and leases issued by the State of Alaska (see Section 4 for more 
information). 

The Greens Creek Mine is currently regulated by approximately 70 separate permits 
and approvals issued by  various  Federal, State and Municipal agencies  covering 
activities at and around the Greens Creek Mine operation. The operation of the mine 
and associated facilities are authorized in part under a series of leases and other 
land use authorizations from the United States Forest Service (USFS) and are 
carried out in accordance with the General Plan of Operations (GPO) approved by 
the USFS. Certain areas of the mine's operation are also subject to other Federal 
and State permits, and approvals issued by other Federal and State agencies. 

The USFS has issued special use permits and leases for various aspects of the 
operations. In addition, Hecla holds approximately 7,301 acres (2,955 ha) classified 
as a Land Exchange Area for which the USFS has granted Hecla exclusive rights to 
explore and mine, with specified restrictions, for 99 years. This area is inclusive of 
the patented mining claims and some previously leased and permitted sites from the 
USFS within the area. All lands owned by or leased to Hecla by the USFS will be 
conveyed to the United States at the end of mine life, or in 2095 at the latest. 

The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) regulates mill 
tailings and production rock disposal facilities at the mine, as well as other aspects 
of the operation primarily through Title 18 of the Alaska Administrative Code (AAC), 
Chapters 50, 60, 70, 72 and 80. Several permits are issued by ADEC, including, but 
not limited to the Air Quality Operating Permit No. 302TVP03, the Alaska Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (APDES) permit AK-004320-6 and the Waste 
Management Permit 2014DB0003 (WMP), which authorizes tailings and production 
rock disposal and prescribes monitoring, reporting, closure, post-closure and 
financial responsibility requirements. ADEC also regulates point source surface 
water discharges under the Alaska Pollution Discharge Elimination System. For 
more information on the tailings and rock disposal see Section 18. 

The Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) issues certain land and water 
use authorizations and dam safety certificates covering site wide operations, 
including some of the tailings management infrastructure. In addition, ADNR works 
with the USFS and ADEC to oversee the reclamation and closure plan and bonding 
for the mine. 

Oversight by the EPA includes hazardous waste disposal regulated by the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and the management of fuel and oil under the oil 
pollution prevention requirements of 40 CF112. Other federal agencies involved in 
the operation of the mine include the U.S. Coast Guard, Nuclear Regulatory

Commission (nuclear sources), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
(explosives), Federal Communication Commission (radio station authorization) and 
Federal Aviation Administration (float-plane landing facility). 

Hecla has implemented workplace processes and training programs designed to 
minimize waste and prevent pollution, and to comply with all applicable laws, 
regulations, and corporate requirements. 

20.2 Baseline Studies and Annual Reports 
The technical and environmental library containing baseline reports and ongoing 
studies at the Greens Creek Mine contains hundreds of documents from 1980 to 
2018. Annual reports that are required under various permits that are submitted to 
the regulatory agencies, and which are available to the public are summarized in

20.3 Monitoring Activities 

20.3.1  Integrated Monitoring Plan 

Compliance monitoring is undertaken to verify that the project operates within permit 
limitations thereby minimizing impact to the environment during operations and post 
closure. The objective of the Integrated Monitoring Plan (IMP) is to provide mine 
operations and state and federal regulators with a clear and concise plan that lists 
monitoring and sampling criteria for surface and ground water quality, geochemical 
characterization of materials, geotechnical stability of structures, and aquatic 
biological resources present at the site. The relevant historical and procedural 
information important to the development and implementation of this monitoring plan 
for sample collection/analysis, data analysis, and reporting are contained in the IMP. 

Monitoring activities outlined in this plan include surface, ground, and process water 
monitoring, geochemical characterization of tailings, waste rock, and construction 
rock, geotechnical monitoring of Site 23 and the tailings disposal facility (TDF) Pond 
7/10, and biological monitoring of activities during operations and closure. 

In general, monitoring will be similar during operations and closure, with monitoring 
decreasing as reclamation activities are completed and performance goals are met. 
Long-term water treatment may be required for some components of the contact 
water through active water treatment facilities. The water treatment plant (WTP) has 
the capacity to treat approximately 2,500 gpm and has adequate capacity to 
efficiently treat identified sources from the mine drainage, and seepage from the 
TDF at closure.  

20.4 Environmental Issues 
Greens Creek mines mineralized material made up of massive sulfides in a 
temperate rainforest environment. Proper management of the waste materials from 
the mining process is of primary importance due to potential acid rock drainage 
(ARD) and metals leaching considerations. Regulatory oversight is rigorous, and the 
relationship between the agencies and the mine is transparent. Waste materials are 
regulated under the State's Waste Management Permit, which involves provisions 
for building contained waste storage facilities, diverting water from the facilities, and 
capturing and treating all water that contacts the waste. 

During operation of the Greens Creek Mine, water collected from the underground 
workings, seepage collected beneath waste rock facility (Site 23) and the TDF, and 
stormwater run-off from the waste rock facility (Site 23/D), the mill area and the TDF 
are collected and treated. The contact water is collected and treated prior to 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 284  

discharge under an APDES permit. 

20.5 Closure Plan 
Hecla has prepared a reclamation and closure plan to address interim, concurrent, 
final reclamation and post-mining land use of the Greens Creek Mine. The 
reclamation and closure plan and closure cost estimates are submitted to the USFS 
as required under 36 CFR 228.1 et. seq. and 36 CFR 228A (Training Guide for 
Reclamation Bond Estimation and Administration 2004). Concurrently, the 
reclamation and closure plan and cost estimate are submitted to ADNR and ADEC 
in accordance with AS 27.19.010 et. seq., 11 AAC 97.100 et. seq., AS 46.03.010 et. 
seq., and 18 AAC 60.25 et seq. 

The reclamation and closure plan sets performance goals applicable to interim, 
concurrent, and final reclamation, and addresses post-closure monitoring 
requirements. It also sets scheduling and other standards for reclamation and for 
final closure planning requirements, and it explains how detailed, regularly-updated 
reclamation task planning will be used for purposes of calculating a reclamation 
bond. Reclamation practices will utilize best practicable established and accepted 
technologies and methodologies suitable for the southeast Alaska environment. 

Hecla will reclaim exploration, development, mining and process-related 
disturbances at the Greens Creek Mine in a manner compatible with the final land 
use selected and applicable regulations. The final land use likely will be limited 
primarily to Admiralty Island National Monument-related activities, and therefore 
returning the surface to a near-natural condition will satisfy post-mining land use 
needs. Private lands will retain their status after mining and were developed for non-
Monument uses prior to creation of the Admiralty Island National Monument. After 
closure, Hecla will consult with the ultimate landowners, as well as any agencies 
having regulatory authority over reclamation of such lands, to determine the final 
disposition of structures and facilities. The estimated cost of reclamation and 
closure, net of salvage, at the end of mine life, is $89.9 million. 

Hecla plans to phase out collection and conventional treatment of surface 
stormwater (contact water) from some of these sources as areas are reclaimed, the 
engineered cover is constructed on the TDF, vegetation established, and water 
monitoring demonstrates the applicable AWQS are met. Long-term water treatment 
may be required for some components of the contact water through active water 
treatment facilities. The WTP has the capacity to treat approximately 2,500 gpm and 
has adequate capacity to efficiently treat identified sources. 

20.6 Permitting 
The land comprising the Greens Creek Mine, inclusive of all Admiralty Island 
facilities, consists of both publicly and privately-owned uplands and tidelands. 
Greens Creek leases parcels from the United States on both the Monument and 
non-monument lands. Hecla uses other public lands pursuant to special use permits 
issued by the USFS and leases issued by the State of Alaska. It owns land on 
Admiralty Island both as a result of patenting mining and mill site claims and through 
transfer of private lands in the historic cannery area from its predecessor.  
Additionally, Greens Creek holds subsurface and restricted surface use rights to 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 285  

approximately 7,301 acres (2,955 ha) of public lands as a result of the Land 
Exchange made pursuant to the Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104-123 April 1, 1996). 

Under the Land Exchange agreement, certain private lands (e.g. patented claims) 
owned by Hecla ultimately will be transferred to the United States, and the 7,301 
acres (2,955 ha) of subsurface and restricted-use surface lands patented to Greens 
Creek in 1999 will revert to the United States. The Land Exchange agreement does 
not impose special reclamation requirements on these lands. It requires that they 
must be reclaimed in accordance with applicable laws and the approved reclamation 
plan. Surety bonds are in place for reclamation and closure, which satisfy permit 
requirements.  A list of the current permits in place is included in Table 20-2.

20.7 Considerations of Social and Community Impacts 
Hecla conducts a community relations program with the communities and 
stakeholders potentially impacted by the project. This includes, in conjunction with 
external consultants as required, monitoring socio-economic trends, community 
perceptions and impacts. The involvement of third-party professional assistance for 
consultation provides an independent view for the stakeholders. 

Hecla executes the charitable contribution aspects of the community relations plan 
in great part through the Hecla Charitable Foundation and encourages employee 
membership in civic and business-related groups and conducts research on 
surrounding community attitudes toward the Greens Creek Mine by utilizing internal 
and external resources. 

20.8 Comments on Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Community 
Impact 
In the opinion of the QP: 

• Hecla has sufficiently addressed the environmental impact of the operation, 
and subsequent closure and remediation requirements that Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves can be declared, and that the mine plan is 
appropriate and achievable. Closure provisions are appropriately 
considered. Monitoring programs are in place. 

• Hecla has developed a communities' relations plan to identify and ensure an 
understanding of the needs of the surrounding communities and to determine 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 291  

appropriate programs for filling those needs. The company appropriately 
monitors socio-economic trends, community perceptions and mining 
impacts. 

• Permits held by Hecla for the Project are sufficient to ensure that mining 
activities are conducted within the regulatory framework required by Alaskan 
State and Federal regulations.  Work is ongoing regarding modifications to 
the TDF Plan of Operations to accommodate tailings beyond the current 
Greens Creek mineral reserve life. 

• Exploration permits are dependent on USFS annual review. For the past 10 
years, Hecla has received the appropriate permits, and expects this to 
continue. 

• There are no currently known environmental, permitting, or social/community 
risks to the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Capital Cost Estimates 

21.1.1 Basis of Estimate 

Total LOM remaining undiscounted capital costs are estimated at $256.0 million in 
2019 US dollars. Future capital costs are estimated based on expected sustaining 
capital requirements of the mine. Development costs are estimated based on past 
experience and are adjusted for any future anticipated changes in factors which 
would affect cost and amount of development. The timing of equipment replacement 
and rebuilds are based on replacement and rebuild schedules, and the anticipated 
cost is based on actual experience. In the later years of the LOM, costs are estimated 
for equipment required to sustain production. 

21.1.2 Mine Capital Costs 

Mine capital costs consist predominantly of replacement of equipment and major 
equipment rebuilds to sustain production through LOM, as well as anticipated 
underground development and capitalized drilling and infrastructure needs.  

Capital development costs have been estimated based on the expected amount of 
development in each year and the anticipated costs of development. This is derived 
from past experience with updates to the cost based on projected changes in items 
that would affect costs. Total LOM mine development is estimated at $98.1 million. 

Included within the mine capital cost estimate is provision for mine rehabilitation; 
these costs are primarily ground support and labor costs, which are estimated based 
on expected rehabilitation activities to be performed in specific years. 

Capitalized drilling expenditures are estimated based on the anticipated amount of 
drilling in a specific year and an expected cost for the drilling program for each 
specific year.  Total LOM capitalized drilling costs are projected to be $26.6 million. 

21.1.3 Process Capital Costs 

Process capital costs are estimated based on specific projects which are anticipated 
to be undertaken. In these cases, cost estimates are provided by project 
management, and long-term capital is anticipated based on prior experience 
regarding the amount of sustaining capital which is expected for the mill to maintain 
anticipated production levels. 

Specific projects which are expected to be completed include: 

• On-stream analyzer replacement ($0.3 million) 
• Replacement of the zinc side bulk cells ($0.2 million) 
• Tailings press rebuild ($0.2 million) 
• Tailings thickener center well ($0.2 million) 

21.1.4 Infrastructure Capital Costs 

Various surface infrastructure and environmental capital costs are anticipated to 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 293  

maintain operation of the mine and are detailed in Table 21-1.  
 

Major projects allocations include: 

• Dry stack tailings project engineering to accommodate material beyond the 
current LOM ($8.2 million).  

• Outfall capacity improvements ($6.0 million) 
• Bridge upgrades ($5.0 million) 
• Tailings pile cover ($4.0 million) 

21.1.5 General and Administrative Capital Costs 

General and administrative (G&A) capital costs are anticipated to be $1.3 million 
over the LOM, and the estimate is primarily composed of sustaining capital items. 

21.1.6 Owner (Corporate) Capital Costs 

Owner's costs are included in the estimate of certain construction and development 
costs; these are primarily composed of labor; however, other costs are included such 
as internally-procured supplies, fuel and electricity. 

21.1.7 Sustaining Capital 

Included within each department above are costs related to other sustaining capital 
which is an estimate made for items not specifically planned. However, it is expected 
that capital costs will be incurred to maintain anticipated production levels. The LOM 
sustaining capital estimate, included in total capital in Table 21-1, totals $79.8 
million.  

21.1.8 Contingency 

Contingency is added to the planned capital estimates. Contingency percentages 
typically applied range from 5% to 30% based on the characteristics of the underlying 
work program. 

21.1.9 Capital Cost Summary 

Capital costs over the LOM total $256.0 million. The LOM capital cost estimate is 
summarized in Table 21-1.

Totals may not agree due to rounding. 

21.2 Operating Cost Estimates 

21.2.1 Basis of Estimate 

Total LOM operating costs are anticipated to be $165.39/ton ($182.32/tonne) milled. 
The operating costs included in the LOM are derived from the 2019 budget for the 
near-term and adjusted for factors regarding expected cost changes in the later 
years. The budget is built using various cost inputs including operating experience, 
quotes from various service providers, anticipated personnel changes, and changes 
in production. 

Fuel and power costs are variable by year, averaging about 6% and 10%, 
respectively, of total production costs in 2018, but ranged from 3 to 10% each in the 
last five years. A key driver of the cost fluctuation is the unpredictable availability of 
less expensive hydroelectric power to the site. When precipitation in southeastern 
Alaska is low, and hydroelectric power is unavailable or reduced, the mine must 
generate electricity on-site using diesel generators. 

21.2.2 Mine Operating Costs 

The LOM mining cost per ton is anticipated to be $73.81/ton ($81.37/tonne) milled. 
These costs include expected direct cost for the mining process (drilling, blasting, 
mucking, hauling) such as labor, ground support, explosives, and diesel fuel. Diesel 
fuel was estimated at $2.70/gallon ($0.71/liter) in the LOM; however, fluctuations in 
the price of diesel fuel will affect operating costs. 

In addition, mining costs include production drilling costs, ore access development 



 

Greens Creek Polymetallic Mine 
Alaska 

NI 43-101 Technical Report on Operations 

 

March 2019 295  

costs, backfill, equipment and electrical maintenance, underground service crews 
and mine management and technical service costs.  

21.2.3 Process Operating Costs 

LOM milling cost per ton is anticipated to be $34.18/ton ($37.68/tonne) milled. These 
costs include labor, maintenance, reagents, grinding media, and electricity. Mill 
consumables and electricity were estimated based on an expected usage rate per 
ton milled; other costs such as labor were estimated as fixed costs. 

Power is both purchased from the local utility company at a rate of approximately 
$0.13 per kWh and generated on site for an expected LOM rate of $0.39 per kWh. 
The LOM plan estimates purchasing 749 million kWh of power from the locally utility 
and generating 107 million kWh on site. 

21.2.4 Infrastructure Operating Costs 

Surface infrastructure costs are estimated at $25.31/ton ($27.90/tonne) milled. 
These costs primarily consist of labor, surface maintenance costs, fuel, and power 
usage. Activities included in these costs include concentrate and tailings haulage, 
road maintenance, tailings placement, buildings maintenance, concentrate ship 
loading, freight haulage and water treatment operations. 

21.2.5 General and Administrative Operating Costs 

G&A operating costs are estimated to be $32.09/ton ($35.37/tonne) milled over the 
LOM. This includes $3.25/ton ($3.58/tonne) milled for the environmental department 
operating costs. These costs mainly consist of labor for accounting, human 
resources, purchasing, health and safety, management, various insurance costs, 
property taxes, communications and IT services. In addition to these costs, G&A 
costs include costs for providing camp facilities and transportation services for the 
Greens Creek workforce. 

21.2.6 Owner (Corporate) Operating Costs 

Included within the G&A costs are Owner management costs paid to the corporate 
entity. 

21.2.7 Operating Cost Summary 

Operating costs total $1.5 billion, or $165.39/ton ($182.32/tonne) milled. The LOM 
operating cost estimate is summarized in Table 21-2.

21.3 Comments on Capital and Operating Costs 
The QP has reviewed the capital and operating cost provisions for the LOM plan that 
supports Mineral Reserves and considers the basis for the estimates, including mine 
budget data, vendor quotes, and operating experience, to be appropriate to the 
known mineralization, mining and production schedules, marketing plans, 
equipment replacement, and maintenance requirements. Appropriate provision has 
been made in the estimates for the expected mine operating usages including labor, 
fuel, power, closure, and environmental considerations. Capital cost estimates 
include appropriate Owner, sustaining and contingency estimates.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Methodology Used 
The results of the economic analysis to support Mineral Reserves represent forward- 
looking information that is subject to a number of known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from 
those presented here. 

Forward-looking statements in this Report include, but are not limited to, statements 
with respect to future metals prices and concentrate sales contracts, the estimation 
of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, the realization of Mineral Reserve 
estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, 
capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of new mineral zones, 
permitting time lines, requirements for additional capital, government regulation of 
mining operations, environmental risks, unanticipated reclamation expenses, title 
disputes or claims, and limitations on insurance coverage. 

Additional risk can come from: actual results of current reclamation activities; 
conclusions of economic evaluations; changes in Project parameters as mine and 
process plans continue to be refined; possible variations in mineral reserves, grade 
or recovery rates; geotechnical considerations during mining; failure of plant, 
equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; shipping delays and regulations; 
accidents, labor disputes, and other risks of the mining industry; and delays in 
obtaining governmental approvals. 

22.1.1 Basis of Economic Analysis 

To support declaration of Mineral Reserves, Hecla completed an economic analysis 
which confirmed positive economics based on the Mineral Reserves using mineral 
reserve price assumptions. 

The Project was further evaluated at a base case scenario using a 5% discount rate, 
and all costs prior to 31 December 2018 were treated as sunk costs.  The base case 
metals prices used in this evaluation were: 

• Gold: $1,303.70/oz; 
• Silver: $15.32/oz; 
• Lead: $0.91/lb; 
• Zinc: $1.30/lb. 

As of the filing date of this report, these prices represented applicable current prices.  

Results of this assessment indicated positive Project economics until the end of mine 
life. This analysis resulted in total gross revenue of $3.2 billion, $474 million in 
treatment and freight charges, $1.5 billion in production/operating costs, a LOM net 
cash flow, before taxes, of $828.8 million, and a 5% discounted pre-tax net cash flow 
of $658.8 million; the post-tax discounted (5%) net cash flow is $638.3 million.  

Throughout the LOM (2019 to 2030), 9.28 million tons of ore will be processed at the 
mill.  The average LOM mill grades for zinc and lead are 7.62% and 2.84%, 
respectively, resulting in 1.25 billion pounds of recovered zinc and 427.17 million

pounds of recovered lead.  Silver production is estimated at 83.69 million ounces 
and gold production is estimated at 542,400 ounces (Table 22-1).

Mining companies doing business in Alaska are primarily subject to U.S. corporate 
income tax, Alaska State income tax and Alaska Mining License tax. The State of 
Alaska levies a mining license tax on mining net income received in connection with 
mining properties and activities in Alaska, at a rate of $4,000 plus 7% over $100,000. 
The effect of this tax is approximately $27 million undiscounted and $20.5 million 
discounted at 5% over the life of the mine.  

The U.S. corporate and Alaska State income tax rates are 21% and a graduated rate 
from 0% to 9.4%, respectively, and are not included in the economic model. Income 
tax is typically not incorporated at the local level and is calculated for all the sites 
together; however, Hecla's U.S. consolidated group provides tax benefits as well as 
net operating losses that are expected to offset the project's taxable income in the 
foreseeable future.  

22.1.2 Sensitivity Analysis 

The Project's pre-tax cumulative cash flow undiscounted and discounted at five 
percent (NPV5) from the model presented above were analyzed for sensitivity to 
variations in revenue, operating, and capital cost assumptions.  Sensitivity analysis 
was performed on the base case net cash flow. Positive and negative variations 
were applied independently to each of the following parameters: 

• Metal prices; 
• Metal grades; 
• Metal recoveries; 
• Capital costs; 
• Operating costs. 

The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the Mineral Reserve 
estimates are most sensitive to variations in metals prices, less sensitive to changes 
in metals grades and recoveries, and least sensitive to fluctuations in operating and 
capital costs. 

Table 22-4 shows the sensitivity cases analyzed, which are shown in the chart in 
Figure 22-1. Because of the Project's 30-year operating history, values for capital 
and operating costs, metals recoveries, and metal grades are well understood.  
Therefore, these parameters were flexed over a smaller range compared to metals 
prices, which are more volatile and were evaluated over a wider range of sensitivity.

The project is most sensitive to changes in the prices of metals, most significantly 
silver and zinc, with cash flows in the lowest scenario ($13.02 silver, $1,108 gold, 
$1.11 zinc, $0.77 lead) being $348.2 million on an undiscounted basis and cash 
flows in the highest scenario ($17.62 silver, $1,499 gold, $1.50 zinc, $1.05 lead) 
being $1.3 billion on an undiscounted basis.  

22.2 Comments on Economic Analysis 
The QP has reviewed the financial analysis and confirms that the Project has positive 
economics until the end of mine life, which supports Mineral Reserve declaration. 

The QP notes the following: 

• The grade of the Greens Creek mineral deposit is not uniform and has distinct 
higher- and lower-grade areas.  This provides opportunities to defer the 
mining of lower-grade areas and prioritize production from higher-grade 
areas in the event of decreased metal prices or higher economic cutoff grade. 

• There is upside for the Project if some or all of the Inferred Mineral Resources 
estimated for the Project can be upgraded to higher confidence Mineral 
Resource categories.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

In the opinion of the QPs, the Greens Creek Mine is a long-established operation 
with a clear understanding of the mining, metallurgical, and infrastructural 
requirements to successfully extract the Greens Creek mineral deposits. Mining and 
milling operations are performing as expected, and reconciliation between mine 
production and the Mineral Resource model is acceptable. This indicates that the 
data supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates were 
appropriately collected, evaluated, and estimated.   

Aside from those risks expressly stated in this and other sections of this report, the 
QPs are not aware of any other environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or 
other factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resources, Mineral Reserves, 
or LOM plan described in this report. 

25.1 Risks 
Factors that may materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate include: 

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Changes to design parameter assumptions that pertain to stope design; 
• Changes to geotechnical, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; 
• Changes to the assumptions used to generate the NSR cut-off; 
• Changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 

mineralization zones; 
• Changes to the assumptions related to mineral tenure rights and royalty 

assumptions associated with the Land Exchange properties. 

Factors that may materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimate include: 

• Metals price assumptions; 
• Variations in short-term marketing and sales contracts; 
• Changes to the mineral resource block model; 
• Changes to the assumptions that go into defining the NSR cut-off; 
• Assumptions relating to the geotechnical and hydrological parameters used 

in mine design;  
• Metallurgical recovery factors: recoveries vary on a day to day basis 

depending on the grades and mineralization types being processed. These 
variations are expected to trend to the forecast LOM recovery value for 
monthly or longer reporting periods; 

• Variations to the permitting, operating, or social license regime. 

Additional risks which may affect the life-of-mine plan, production schedule, or 
economic results are shown in Table 25-1.

Table 25-1: Possible Risks to the Green's Creek Project 
Risk Mitigation 

Metals prices are volatile and 
inherently difficult to predict. Actual 
prices will differ to some extent from 
the forecasts used in this report. 
 
Smelter terms are volatile and may 
change substantially over time. 
 
Mining costs may be higher or lower 
than expected. 

The grade of the Greens Creek mineral deposit  is not uniform and 
has distinct higher- and lower-grade areas.  This provides 
opportunities to defer the mining of lower-grade areas and prioritize 
production from higher-grade areas in the event of decreased metal 
prices or higher economic cutoff grade. 
 
Metal price assumptions used to evaluate Greens Creek mineral 
reserves and economics are conservative, utilizing a base case 
silver price significantly less than the three-year trailing average.  
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the mine plan maintains a positive 
NPV even with a 20% decrease in metal prices compared to the 
base case. 

Ground support at Greens Creek 
experiences significant sulfide 
corrosion.  Failure of ground support 
may result in temporary loss of access 
through travelways. 

Most mining areas have several access options due to the presence 
of multiple parallel ramp systems.  Greens Creek has an active and 
ongoing rebar rehab program which is upgrading existing ramps 
with LOM corrosion-resistant support.  Areas which cannot be 
rehabbed with rebar (such as raises) are closely monitored. 

Mine development may not meet 
targets due to equipment availability or 
other challenges 

Nearly 80% of mineral reserves are located in proximity to existing 
haulage ramps, requiring only a short ore-access crosscut in order 
to be brought into production. 
 
Delays in advancement of haulage ramps can be mitigated by 
bringing this near-mine material into production, with a slight 
negative effect on grades. 

Water inflows from development of 
certain shallower mineral reserves 
(Upper East Ore) could result in: 
• Mining difficulties/reduced rates  
• Need for additional underground 

and surface water handling 
infrastructure 

• Increased closure costs 

A hydrological study is currently planned in order to define the 
nature and extent of the East Ore groundwater.  This will inform the 
plan for prevention and mitigation, including possibly a campaign of 
pre-grouting.   
 
The proportion of mineral reserve which may be affected by this 
groundwater is very small (equivalent to 2.6% of overall mineral 
reserve) 

25.2 Opportunities 
Project opportunities include: 

• Upside potential if some or all of the Inferred Mineral Resources estimated 
for the Project can be upgraded to higher confidence Mineral Resource 
categories and eventually to Mineral Reserves. Additional potential exists 
where existing Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource categories may be 
able to be upgraded to Mineral Reserves.  

• Future exploration potential which, with appropriate drilling and mineral 
resource modelling, may result in additional Mineral Resources. 

• Digitization and evaluation of historic face mapping and sampling data.  A 
large amount of geological data from early in the Greens Creek Mine life 
exists only as archival hardcopy and is not included in current geological 
models. Incorporation of this data may result in better geological 
understanding and identification of opportunities for remnant mining, possibly 
leading to increased Mineral Reserves. 

• Continued metallurgical testwork may show mineral treatment adjustments 
that could increase metal recoveries or create more attractive metal

concentrates to the target smelters. Improvements made in the processing 
plant could have a positive impact on costs and recovery, improving the 
mine's profitability. 

• Further development and application of automated and tele-remote 
equipment may result in additional efficiencies, particularly the ability to 
continue work between shifts while the mine is cleared for blasting.

drainage (ARD) 

Characterized by low pH, high sulfate, and high iron and 
other metal species. 

adit A passageway or opening driven horizontally into the side of 
a hill generally for the purpose of exploring or otherwise 
opening a mineral deposit. An adit is open to the 
atmosphere at one end, a tunnel at both ends. 

adjacent property A property in which the issuer does not have an interest; 
has a boundary reasonably proximate to the property being 
reported on; and has geological characteristics similar to 
those of the property being reported on 

advanced argillic alteration Consists of kaolinite + quartz + hematite + limonite. 
Feldspars leached and altered to sericite.  The presence of 
this assemblage suggests low pH (highly acidic) conditions. 
At higher temperatures, the mineral pyrophyllite (white mica) 
forms in place of kaolinite 

advanced property A means a property that has mineral reserves, or mineral 
resources the potential economic viability of which is 
supported by a preliminary economic assessment, a pre-
feasibility study or a feasibility study.

unsorted sand, gravel, and clay that has been deposited by 
water. 

ANFO A free-running explosive used in mine blasting made of 94% 
prilled aluminum nitrate and 6% No. 3 fuel oil. 

aquifer A geologic formation capable of transmitting significant 
quantities of groundwater under normal hydraulic gradients. 

argillic alteration Introduces any one of a wide variety of clay minerals, 
including kaolinite, smectite and illite. Argillic alteration is 
generally a low temperature event, and some may occur in 
atmospheric conditions 

assay To test, or a test performed on, mineralized material by 
chemical or other method of examination to determine the 
proportion of metals in the ore. 

autogenous grinding The process of grinding in a rotating mill which uses as a

Term Definition 
azimuth The direction of one object from another, usually expressed 

as an angle in degrees relative to true north. Azimuths are 
usually measured in the clockwise direction, thus an 
azimuth of 90 degrees indicates that the second object is 
due east of the first. 

backfill The process of filling, and/or the material used to fill, a mine 
opening. 

background concentration Naturally-occurring concentrations of compounds of 
environmental concern. 

ball mill A piece of milling equipment used to grind material into 
small particles. It is a cylindrical shaped steel container filled 
with steel balls into which crushed material is fed.  The ball 
mill is rotated causing the balls themselves to cascade, 
which in turn grinds the ore. 

beneficiation Physical treatment of crude ore to improve its quality for 
some specific purpose. Also called mineral processing. 

bullion Unrefined gold and/or silver mixtures that have been melted 
and cast into a bar or ingot. 

comminution/crushing/grinding Crushing and/or grinding of ore by impact and abrasion. 
Usually, the word "crushing" is used for dry methods and 
"grinding" for wet methods. Also, "crushing" usually denotes 
reducing the size of coarse rock while "grinding" usually 
refers to the reduction of the fine sizes. 

concentrate The concentrate is the valuable product from mineral 
processing, as opposed to the tailing, which contains the 
waste minerals. The concentrate represents a smaller 
volume than the original ore 

critical path Sequence of activities through a project network from start 
to finish, the sum of whose durations determines the overall 
project duration. Note: there may be more than one such 
path. (The path through a series of activities, taking into 
account interdependencies, in which the late completion of 
activities will have an impact on the project end date or 
delay a key milestone.) 

crosscut A horizontal opening driven across the course of a vein or 
structure, or in general across the strike of the rock 
formation; a connection from a shaft to an ore structure. 

crown pillar An ore pillar at the top of an open stope left for wall support

Term Definition 
cut and fill stoping If it is undesirable to leave broken ore in the stope during 

mining operations (as in shrinkage stoping), the lower 
portion of the stope can be filled with waste rock and/or mill 
tailings. In this case, ore is removed as soon as it has been 
broken from overhead, and the stope filled with waste to 
within a few feet of the mining surface. This method 
eliminates or reduces the waste disposal problem 
associated with mining as well as preventing collapse of the 
ground at the surface. 

cut-off grade A grade level below which the material is not "ore" and 
considered to be uneconomical to mine and process. The 
minimum grade of ore used to establish mineral reserves. 

data verification The process of confirming that data has been generated 
with proper procedures, has been accurately transcribed 
from the original source and is suitable to be used for 
mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation 

decline A sloping underground opening for machine access from 
level to level or from the surface. Also called a ramp. 

density The mass per unit volume of a substance, commonly 
expressed in grams/ cubic centimeter. 

depletion The decrease in quantity of ore in a deposit or property 
resulting from extraction or production. 

development Often refers to the construction of a new mine or; Is the 
underground work carried out for the purpose of reaching 
and opening up a mineral deposit. It includes shaft sinking, 
cross-cutting, drifting and raising. 

development property A property that is being prepared for mineral production or a 
material expansion of current production, and for which 
economic viability has been demonstrated by a pre-
feasibility or feasibility study. 

diabase US terminology for an intrusive rock whose main 
components are labradorite and pyroxene, and 
characterized by an ophiolitic texture.  Corresponds to a 
diorite.

Term Definition 
flotation Separation of minerals based on the interfacial chemistry of 

the mineral particles in solution. Reagents are added to the 
ore slurry to render the surface of selected minerals 
hydrophobic. Air bubbles are introduced to which the 
hydrophobic minerals attach. The selected minerals are 
levitated to the top of the flotation machine by their 
attachment to the bubbles and into a froth product, called 
the "flotation concentrate." If this froth carries more than one 
mineral as a designated main constituent, it is called a "bulk 
float". If it is selective to one constituent of the ore, where 
more than one will be floated, it is a "differential" float. 

flowsheet The sequence of operations, step by step, by which ore is 
treated in a milling, concentration, or smelting process.

imparts to it the ability to form a stable froth 

gangue The fraction of ore rejected as tailing in a separating 
process. It is usually the valueless portion, but may have 
some secondary commercial use 

geosyncline A major downwarp in the Earth's crust, usually more than 
1000 kilometers in length, in which sediments accumulate to 
thicknesses of many kilometers. The sediments may 
eventually be deformed and metamorphosed during a 
mountain- building episode. 

gravity separation Exploitation of differences in the densities of particles to 
achieve separation. Machines utilizing gravity separation 
include jigs and shaking tables. 

greenschist facies One of the major divisions of the mineral facies classification 
of metamorphic rocks, the rocks of which formed under the 
lowest temperature and pressure conditions usually 
produced by regional metamorphism. Temperatures 
between 300 and 450 °C (570 and 840 °F) and pressures of 
1 to 4 kilobars are typical. The more common minerals 
found in such rocks include quartz, orthoclase, muscovite, 
chlorite, serpentine, talc, and epidote 

hanging wall The wall or rock on the upper or top side of a vein or ore 
deposit.

Term Definition 
historical estimate An estimate of the quantity, grade, or metal or mineral 

content of a deposit that an issuer has not verified as a 
current mineral resource or mineral reserve, and which was 
prepared before the issuer acquiring, or entering into an 
agreement to acquire, an interest in the property that 
contains the deposit. A Qualified Person has not done

Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a 
level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are 
spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity 
to be reasonably assumed. 

Inferred Mineral Resource An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

internal rate of return (IRR) The rate of return at which the Net Present Value of a 
project is zero; the rate at which the present value of cash 
inflows is equal to the present value of the cash outflows.
