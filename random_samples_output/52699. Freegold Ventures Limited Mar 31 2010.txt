SUMMARY 
 
 
 The Vinasale gold project is located in western Alaska, approximately seventeen miles 
south of McGrath and 400 kilometers southwest of Fairbanks. The project is situated on the east 
bank of the Kuskokwim River. Free Gold Recovery, USA owns 72 State of Alaska mining 
claims covering 11,520 acres and has leased 89,583.54 acres from Doyon Limited, one of 13 
regional Alaska Native corporations. Access to the property is via commercial aircraft to 
McGrath, and then to the property via helicopter, or via seasonal barge up the Kuskokwim River.  
 
 The property is underlain by Cretaceous-ages Kuskokwim Group shales and greywackes 
that have been intruded by a Tertiary-aged porphyritic quartz monzonite intrusive complex... 
East-west, north-south and northeast-southwest trending structures cut the sediments and 
intrusions. Gold mineralization identified to date is hosted by magmatic and hydrothermal 
breccia phases of a quartz monzonite phase of the intrusive complex. Arsenic has the strongest 
correlation with gold while antimony, bismuth and tungsten also correlate to a lesser extent. 
Gold-related alteration includes sericitic alteration, dolomitic alteration and silicification as 
pervasive flooding and as quartz veinlets. The margin of the intrusion at Vinasale Mountain 
exhibits hornfelsing of the sediments and is associated with both an aeromagnetic and resistivity 
low. No drilling has been conducted in the hornfels zone at Vinasale.  
 

Placer gold was discovered in Alder Creek draining the south side of Vinasale Mountain 
in approximately 1922, with total placer gold production estimated at less than 125 ounces. No 
lode production has occurred in the area. 
 
 Lode exploration in the early 1990s identified gold-in-soil anomalies at the Central, 
South and Northeast zone near the crest of Vinasale Mountain. These anomalies were drilled 
tested, with subsequent follow-up drilling in the Central Zone. Total core drilling to date is 
25,247 feet. The Central Zone was investigated by 21 drill holes within an area measuring 
approximately 185 meters by 185 meters (600 feet by 600 feet) and intersected one or more 
intervals of greater than 6 meters (20 feet) grading more than 1 gram of gold per tonne (0.029 
opt). Mineralization is open to expansion in several directions. Review of drill core indicates that 
higher gold grades commonly occur with magmatic and/or hydrothermal breccias. The majority 
of drill holes were vertical but some of the best grade-thickness intervals came from angle holes, 
suggesting the possible presence of as-yet undefined high angle controls on gold mineralization. 
 
 Several historical resource estimates were completed on the Vinasale gold project prior to 
implementation of NI-43-101 reporting standards. The most recent historical resource estimate 
(1995) totals 16,049,000 short tons grading 0.060 ounces of gold per ton (962,760 ounces). 
These historical resource calculations are reported here for historical accuracy purposes 
only. These historical resource calculations are not NI 43-101 compliant and do not comply 
with the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines 
adopted by CIM Council on August 20, 2000.  
 
 The available data identifies host rock and regional structural similarities between 
Vinasale Mountain and the +40 million ounce Donlin Creek deposit approximately 135 
kilometers to the southwest. Both are hosted primarily in Tertiary plutonic rocks which intrude

775-379-3898 



 v
Kuskokwim Group sediments and both are controlled by northeast trending structures. Both 
Donlin and Vinasale have quartz and carbonate alteration as well as anomalous arsenic and 
antimony trace elemental associations. In addition, the Vinasale gold project is similar to the 
Trun gold-tungsten deposit, Bulgaria, where significant gold-tungsten mineralization is hosted in 
hornfelsed sediments surrounding a previously explored gold-bearing intermediate intrusive.  
 

Additional exploration work is warranted at the Vinasale gold project. Recommended 
work includes expansion of the 2008 induced polarization geophysical survey to define possible 
drill targets in the hornfels zone surrounding the main Vinasale intrusive. Additional drilling of 
the Central zone is suggested in order to verify the analyses and geologic observations from core 
drilling completed in 1991 and 1994. Drilling is also recommended outside the Central zone on 
exploration targets already identified by both airborne and ground geophysics. An exploration 
program is proposed consisting of $300,000 of IP geophysical surveys followed by a $1,250,000 
core drilling program designed to produce approximately 10,000 feet of core. Total project 
budget is estimated at US$1.55 million. The recommended IP program is not dependent on any 
other work recommended for the Vinasale project. Confirmation drilling recommended for the 
Central zone is not dependent on any other work recommended for the Vinasale project however, 
drilling outside of the Central zone will be based to some degree on the results of the 
recommended 2010 IP program.

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
 The following report was commissioned by Freegold Recovery Inc. USA and its parent 
Freegold Ventures Limited (collectively "Freegold") to summarize the results of previous field 
work completed on the Vinasale gold project in southwest Alaska (Figure 1). CARACOL was 
retained to complete this summary report for Freegold. This report was prepared based upon a 
review of existing reports prepared by State and federal agencies and by third party interests 
working on behalf of Freegold and underlying landowner Doyon, Limited. The author is a 
Qualified Person under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 guidelines but has not conducted 
field work on the Vinasale gold project. The author has not conducted a recent personal 
inspection of the property because seasonal weather conditions prevent the author from obtaining 
beneficial information from a personal inspection. As per section 6.2.3 of NI43-101, the author 
intends to conduct a personal inspection of the Vinasale project as soon as weather conditions 
permit in the spring of 2010.  
 

For purposes of this report, the term "opt" will refer to troy ounces per short ton, "gpt" 
will refer to grams per metric tonne, "ppb" will refer to parts per billion and "ppm" will refer to 
parts per million. Unless otherwise noted, all costs contained in this report are denominated in 
United States dollars (US$1.00 = CDN$1.00). The author has retained the use of English 
measurement units for historical accuracy purposes but otherwise utilizes metric system 
measurements in this report.  
 
 When referring to locations along a creek, this report uses the historical method of 
description where right limit and left limit refer to the side of the creek as viewed by a person 
looking downstream. The terms alluvial and placer are considered synonymous for the purposes 
of this report. For purposes of this report, the abbreviated term "Ma" shall mean "millions of 
years ago" and the term "Moz" shall mean "millions of ounces". The authors have used the 
igneous rock classification system of Streckheisen (1973) in this report.

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION  
 

The Vinasale project is located approximately 29 kilometers south of the village of 
McGrath (population 401), 400 kilometers southwest of Fairbanks (population 75,000) and 340 
kilometers northwest of Anchorage (population 360,000). McGrath is the regional infrastructure 
hub for this part of Alaska (Figure 1). The property is located on the west bank of the 
Kuskokwim River in the McGrath C5 quadrangle. 
 
 Doyon, Limited, one of 13 Alaskan Native corporations, owns the subsurface mineral 
rights and most of the surface rights to 89,583.54 acres of land that comprise the Vinasale project 
area (Figure 2). Free Gold Recovery, USA owns 72 State of Alaska mining claims covering 
11,520 acres. Together these parcels comprise the Vinasale project.  
 

In February 2007 Freegold and Doyon entered into a joint venture agreement on the 
project. Under the Exploration Agreement, Freegold must make cash payments of $320,000 over 
five years, make annual scholarship donations of $10,000, and make exploration expenditures 
totaling $4,750,000. Freegold may at its option enter into a one year extension by making an 
additional cash payment of $100,000 and incurring an additional $1,500,000 in exploration 
expenditures. In the event the property is reduced by 50% or more the additional exploration 
expenditures shall be reduced to $1,000,000. Freegold may enter into one or more Mining Leases 
with Doyon on lands on which it has expended at least $600,000, carried out at least 10,000 feet 
of core drilling, and submitted a pre-feasibility study. Freegold will be required to make advance 
royalty payments and continue to conduct minimum exploration expenditures on leased lands 
until such time as a Board approved positive feasibility study has been delivered. Advance 
royalty payments shall be $100,000 per year during the initial five-year period, increasing to 
$250,000 per year thereafter. The minimum mandatory exploration expenditures shall be equal to 
the greater of $25/acre or $250,000 for each of the first five years, and $50/acre or $500,000 in 
subsequent years. Upon submission of a Board-approved feasibility study Doyon will have the 
right, for a period of 180 days, to acquire a minimum 5%, and a maximum 10% participating 
interest in Freegold's interest. Within 60 days of Doyon electing to participate, Doyon shall 
contribute to a joint venture an amount equal to 2.25 times Doyon's proportionate share of 
Freegold's cumulative expenditures on the leased area after the Effective Date of the Lease. 
Following the expenditure of such funds, each party will be required to contribute its pro rata 
share of further expenditures. 
 
 In March, 2007, Freegold staked 72 State of Alaska mining claims covering 11,520 acres 
of ground in an open in-holding in the Vinasale land block. These claims are subject to the 
Freegold – Doyon lease agreement. Annual work commitments required by the State of Alaska 
on the properties in the amount of $2.50 per acre per year ($28,800 per year) is required with 
amounts in excess of these levels bankable up to four years into the future. All claims currently 
are in good standing with four years of work commitment banked toward future years. Claim 
rental payments are due on September 1 of each calendar year and payable before November 30 
of each year. The next annual rent payment, due September 1, 2010, will total $10,080. The 
claims of the Vinasale project have not been surveyed by a registered land or mineral surveyor 
and there is no State or federal law or regulation requiring such surveying. Depending on the 
level of exploration work proposed, additional permits may be required from the Alaska

Department of Natural Resources and will be applied for on an as-needed basis. There are no 
known environmental liabilities attached to the property. 
 
 In January 2010, Freegold announced it had entered into an Option Agreement with 
Western Standard Metals Ltd. ("WSM") whereby WSM could earn a 50% interest in the project 
by completing cash payments of CAD$350,000 and completing exploration expenditures of 
$6,250,000 over three years. Expenditure requirements in 2010 will be US$1,500,000. WSM will 
be the operator of the Project until such time as the option is fulfilled and a joint venture is 
formed 
 
 
ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
 Access to the Vinasale project is by helicopter from McGrath or by boat on the 
Kuskokwim River to the base of Vinasale Mountain. No roads exist in the area except within the 
inactive placer gold mine in Alder Gulch on the south flank of Vinasale Mountain. The Alder 
Creek placer mine road connects to a small landing on the Kuskokwim River. 
 

The climate in this portion of Alaska is dominated by 6 to 8 months of sub-freezing 
temperatures in winter followed by 4 to 6 months of warm summer weather. Average annual 
precipitation is 13 inches, mostly as snowfall. 
 

Mining operations can be conducted on a year-round basis in this part of Alaska. The 
Nixon Fork copper-gold mine, located 80 kilometers northeast of Vinasale project, operated 
commercially on a year-round basis in the late 1990's and in 2007 at an annualized rate of about 
60,000 ounces per year (Freeman, 2009) 
 

The Vinasale project lies on the eastern edge of the Kuskokwim Mountains, a maturely 
dissected upland of low, rounded hills and broad sediment filled lowlands that support mature 
stream drainages. Vinasale Mountain proper is a conspicuous circular shaped hill comprising 
about 5 square miles that rises above the main Kuskokwim river valley (el. 400 feet ASL) to the 
peak of Vinasale Mountain (el. 1,683 feet ASL). The project is largely below timberline and is 
heavily vegetated with stands of mature spruce, birch willow, and thick alder patches. Bedrock 
rubble and outcrop occur only rarely and then only above 1,200 feet elevation. Small areas of 
bedrock and rubble crop occur along the Kuskokwim River and in steep zones along the 
mountain slopes. Permafrost is limited to small discontinuous lenses on steep, poorly drained 
north-facing slopes and has posed no hindrance to past development in the region. The 
Kuskokwim River is an anadromous stream however none of the smaller streams draining 
Vinasale Mountain are known to host fish populations. 
 
 
HISTORY 
 

Published data on the Vinasale project area prior to the mid-1970s is limited to historic 
activities around the Alder Gulch placer gold deposit in the south flank of Vinasale Mt. 
(Bundtzen, 1986). The placer deposits were discovered by Charles Schuttler in 1922 or 1923 
while he was prospecting the various streams draining radially off Vinasale Mountain (Table 1).

Smith (1934) reported that hand mining occurred in Alder Gulch between 1929 and 1933 
yielding 65 ounces of placer gold from a small cut covering 13,600 square feet. Cobb (1973) 
reported that considerable scheelite, magnetite, stibnite, and bismuth were found in the heavy 
mineral concentrates from Alder Gulch. Unpublished United States mint returns indicate a 
production of 103 ounces of gold and 20.2 ounces of byproduct silver for a period ending in 
1935 (Bundtzen, 1999).

Mining activity apparently ceased during the 1930's and did not resume until 1981 when 
Peter Snow of McGrath began exploration and development work (Bundtzen, 1986). Pilot plant 
test in 1982, material from a 3,000 square foot cut yielded 4-5 ounces of placer gold including a 
0.5 ounce gold-quartz nugget. Bundtzen (1986) estimated that no more than 80 cubic yards of 
gravel were processed during the 1982 work. In 1983, additional work also yielded a modest 
amount of gold. Total production from the 1982-83 work was estimated at 16.5 ounces of gold 
and 3.5 ounces of silver (Bundtzen, 1999).  
 
 The potential for lode gold mineralization at Vinasale was first indicated by regional 
stream silt sampling completed for Doyon Ltd. by WGM, Inc. between 1977 and 1979. These 
efforts yielded pan concentrate results ranging from less than detection limit to 4,275 ppb gold in 
East Creek (DiMarchi and others, 1991). One diamond core hole (609 feet) was completed in 
1979 but no information regarding this drilling is available to the author. 
 
 The potential for lode gold mineralization also was recognized by Bundtzen (1986) who 
suggested that lode mineralization on Vinasale Mountain proper may have been the source of 
placer gold mined in Alder Gulch. Sulfide-scheelite-quartz float found by Peter Snow in the 
placer mine cut at Alder Gulch returned 14.3 gpt gold. 
 
 By 1989 Doyon, Limited. and Central Alaska Gold Company (CAGC) had entered into a 
lease agreement whereby CAGC would conduct exploration and development of a large block of 
Doyon lands south of McGrath that contained what is now the Vinasale project. CAGC collected 
grid, contour and reconnaissance soil and rock samples. The following year, CAGC initiated 
exploration at Vinasale, and by July had entered into a joint venture on the project with Placer 
Dome (DiMarchi and others, 1991). Placer Dome's objective was to evaluate the potential for 
Vinasale to host a multi-million ounce resource within 500 feet of the surface. The joint venture 
discovered significant gold anomalies in soils in the Central, Northeast, and South Zones on the 
summit and flanks of Vinasale Mountain and a diamond drill program, concentrating on the 
Central Zone was initiated. (DiMarchi and others, 1991; DiMarchi, 1993). Total costs for this 
program are not available to the author. 
 
 In 1990, Central Alaska Gold Corp. (CAGC) began work at Vinasale with the drilling of 
three core holes (1,498 feet) sited on gold-in-soil anomalies (DiMarchi and others, 1991). The 
results of drilling was the basis upon which "discovery" was claimed. During this program, a 
total of 409 soil samples, 47 rock samples and 9 stream sediment samples were collected. In 
addition, CAGC completed 26,000 line feet of VLF and ground magnetometer surveys. Total 
costs for this program are not available to the author. 
 

The 1991 program consisted of 18.1 line-miles of grid VLF/IP/Resistivity/Mag ground 
geophysics, 217 soil samples, 91 rock samples, 36 core holes (12 in the Central Zone, 23 in the 
Northeast Zone, and 1 in the South Zone), and metallurgical work at Placer Dome's labs. By 
year's end, CAGC calculated a preliminary polygonal/cross-section resource in the Central Zone 
of 14,351,000 tons of material with a grade of 0.067 ounces of gold per ton based on fifteen drill 
holes (Table 2). These historical resource calculations are reported here for historical 
accuracy purposes only and do not comply with the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council. Placer Dome's 
metallurgical work concluded that 1) gold is <1 micron in grain size; 2) gold lies within a sulfide

(predominantly arsenopyrite) lattice, and; 3) plus 95% of the gold reports to a floatation 
concentrate representing only 9 to 12% of total feed. Placer Dome concluded their corporate 
mandate was not met, and ended their involvement at Vinasale after the 1990 season. Total costs 
for this program are not available to the author.

With additional work completed in 1992 and 1993, a revised resource estimate for the 
Vinasale deposit, based on a total of 11,260 meters of core drilling, was calculated at 10.3 
million tonnes grading 0.070 ounces of gold per ton (2.4 gpt) for a total in-place resource of 
24,540 kg (789,000 ounces) gold (J. DiMarchi, written communication, 1994; Bundtzen and 
Miller, 1997). These historical resource calculations are reported here for historical

 In 1991 and 1992, metallurgical work was done during independent due diligence efforts 
by Bacon Donaldson and Associates, Las Dudas, Mountain States Research and Development, 
Newmont and BHP Utah International. In 1993, CAGC terminated their lease and returned 100% 
interest in the project to Doyon. 
 
 ASA-Montague leased Vinasale from Doyon in 1994, and collected 771 soil samples, 20 
rock samples and drilled 26 core holes (17,265 feet). Most of this work (21 holes) was focused 
on the Central Zone to upgrade the quality of the resource but some drill holes (5 holes) tested 
the outlying geophysical and soil anomalies (DiMarchi and others, 1994). CAGC contracted with 
Derry, Michener, Booth and Wall was contracted in 1994 to execute a pre-feasibility study 
(Rhoades, 1994). Total costs for this program are not available to the author. 
 
 In 1995 and 1996 ASA-Montague contracted for additional metallurgical studies and a 
pre-feasibility study to be done by Signet Technologies (Signet, 1995) and Independent 
Metallurgical Laboratories (IML, 1995). ASA-Montague also contracted Terra Nord Natural 
Resources Consulting to evaluate environmental concerns related to permitting at Vinasale 
(Terra Nord, 1995). Terra Nord's report covers identified environmental permits required in 
Section 1, a partial list of "non-environmental' permits likely required in Section 2, a discussion

of the NEPA process in Section 3, an outline for time frames associated with the permitting 
process in Section 4, and Section 5 briefly addresses potential issues such as power. Terra Nord 
states, "This section (Section 5) discusses several potential project issues, none of which is 
considered major" (Terra Nord, 1995). Signet (1995) also calculated a revised resource estimate, 
based on 36 drill holes, of 18,045,000 tons grading 0.051 ounces of gold per ton, containing 
920,295 ounces of gold. ASA-Montague also completed a revised resource estimate, on the same 
36 drill hole database, of 17,618,84 tons grading 0.052 ounces of gold per ton, containing 
916,180 ounces of gold. These historical resource calculations are reported here for 
historical accuracy purposes only and do not comply with the CIM Standards on Mineral 
Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council. 
 

For their pre-feasibility study Signet used a resource of 16,049,000 short tons of 0.060 
ounce gold per ton grade for a total contained gold resource of 962,760 ounces. These historical 
resource calculations are reported here for historical accuracy purposes only and do not

 No further exploration was conducted at Vinasale until 2007. In January 2007 Freegold 
announced that it had entered into an Option to Lease Agreement with Doyon, Limited. The year 
one program was aimed at evaluating the entire Vinasale project and included an airborne 
geophysical program and reconnaissance geochemical sampling program. A 1,788 line line-
kilometer airborne geophysical survey was flown in September 2007. The airborne geophysics 
included magnetics and electromagnetic responses were received on the 900 Hz, 7200 Hz, and 
56,000 Hz frequencies (Fugro, 2008, Walcott, 2008a). In addition, a reconnaissance stream silt 
and pan-concentrate sampling program was completed in August 2007 on three drainage basins 
in the Vinasale project land block. These areas included the Vinasale Mountain area, the Black 
River area to the southwest of Vinasale Mountain, and some low hills in the Selatna River basin 
approximately 6 miles southeast of Vinasale Mountain A total of 59 pan-concentrate and 160 
stream silt samples were (Freeman, 2007). Total costs for this program are not available to the 
author. 
 
 During 2008, Freegold contracted with Peter E. Walcott and Associates Limited to 
complete an induced polarization survey over a portion of the Vinasale project (Walcott, 2008b). 
A total of 21.1 line-kilometers of pole – dipole IP survey was completed on 9 east – west 
trending lines to the north and west of the Central zone drill area. Total costs for this program are 
not available to the author. 
 
 
GEOLOGIC SETTING 
 
 The Vinasale project is located on the northeastern edge of the Kuskokwim Minerals Belt 
(KMB) of southwestern Alaska (Figure 3, Bundtzen and Miller, 1996, 1997). The KMB roughly 
parallels the Kuskokwim Mountains which form a broad northeast-trending belt of accordant 
rounded ridges and broad sediment filled lowlands with locally rugged, glaciated igneous-cored 
massifs. The KMB covers an area approximately 550 km long by 350 km wide (192,500 km2) 
that extends from Goodnews Bay on the extreme southwestern coast, to Von Frank Mountain, 
about 100 kilometers northeast of McGrath.

Rocks in the KMB have been subdivided by age and tectonic history into two groups: 

Lower Cretaceous and older fault-bounded terranes, and middle Cretaceous and younger overlap 
and basin fill assemblages of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which were subsequently intruded 
by mafic to felsic plutons (Bundtzen and Miller, 1997; Bundtzen and Gilbert, 1983; Decker and 
others., 1994; Miller and Bundtzen, 1994). Proterozoic to Lower Cretaceous rocks crop out in 
fault-bounded belts that generally parallel the northeasterly structural grain of the region. The 
Vinasale project is situated between two regional northeast trending structures associated with 
the KMB, the Denali Farewell fault system to the south and the Iditarod-Nixon Fork fault to the 
north. Both of these structures have undergone Cretaceous-Tertiary right-lateral offsets of less 
than 150 km (Decker and others, 1994). Numerous northeast and northwest trending subsidiary 
structures that are related to the Iditarod - Nixon Fork and Denali Farewell faults occur in the 
Vinasale project area and possibly have influenced the emplacement and possible subsequent 
displacement of intrusive bodies in the area.  
 
 Proterozoic through Lower Cretaceous basement rocks of the Vinasale project area are 
considered part of the Nixon Fork terrane, variously interpreted as a discrete allochthonous 
terrane (Patton and other, 1994) or as various facies of the continental shelf and slope rocks of 
the Farewell terrane (Decker and others, 1994). Jones and others (1982) suggested that the Nixon 
Fork terrane was tectonically displaced several hundred kilometers from the northwestern part of 
the Canadian Cordillera before it was sutured to its current location.  
 

Amalgamation of the older allochthonous terranes of western Alaska was completed prior 
to middle Cretaceous time (Nokleberg and others, 1994; Decker and others., 1994; Patton and 
others., 1994). Subsequently, these older terranes were eroded and partly covered by terrigenous 
clastic rocks deposited into the Kuskokwim basins. These basin fill sequences are Middle to Late 
Cretaceous in age and display prograding turbidite facies interpreted to be of shallow marine and 
shoreline origin (Miller and Bundtzen, 1994; Patton and others., 1994). The regionally extensive 
Upper Cretaceous Kuskokwim Group was deposited primarily by turbidity currents into an 
elongate, probably strike-slip basin (Miller and Bundtzen, 1994). Local interbedded tuffs and 
volcaniclastic sandstone exist within the Kuskokwim Group, however much of the Kuskokwim 
Group is derived from a mixture of sedimentary and metamorphic terranes (Decker and others., 
1994).  
 

Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary volcanic-plutonic complexes, consisting of larger 
plutons and subvolcanic dike and sill swarms and associated felsic to mafic volcanic rocks 
intrude and overlie the older terranes and the Cretaceous Kuskokwim group (Bundtzen and 
Miller, 1996). These Late Cretaceous- Early Tertiary igneous rocks host a variety of mineral 
deposits that form the KMB and range in composition from gabbro to alkali granite with 
intrusives in the Vinasale project area comprised primarily of late Cretaceous biotite-quartz 
monzonite (DiMarchi and others, 1994).  
 

The dominant deformation events affecting rocks of the KMB began in Late Cretaceous 
time, although earlier deformational events clearly affected the Nixon Fork and adjacent 
allochthonous terranes prior to their amalgamation (Patton and others., 1994). The post-
accretionary overlap assemblages (Kuskokwim Group and Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary 
volcanic and plutonic rocks) were deformed along continental-scale right lateral, strike slip faults 
with accompanying en-echelon folds and subsidiary east-west, northeast and northwest trending 
high-angle faults (Flanigan and others, 2000; Miller and Bundtzen, 1994). The oldest overlap

775-379-3898 



 9
assemblages (Middle Cretaceous) are the most highly deformed and were subjected to multiple 
fold episodes characterized by steep sub-isoclinal folds. Late Cretaceous and younger rocks are 
more broadly folded. The main fault zones affecting the KMB include the Poorman, Iditarod-
Nixon Fork, Farewell-Denali and Susulatna faults, strike roughly 055o to 060o, with offsets that 
range in order from 16 to 160 kilometers. The dextral strike slip tectonic environment probably 
controlled the formation of the Kuskokwim basin and the emplacement of Late Cretaceous-Early 
Tertiary plutonic and volcanic rocks (Nokleberg and others, 1994; Miller and Bundtzen, 1994).  
 

Unconsolidated fluvial, colluvial, and aeolian deposits that range in age from Late 
Tertiary to Holocene cover at least 50 percent of the maturely eroded Kuskokwim Mountains.  
 
 
DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

Bundtzen and Miller (1996, 1997) and Miller and others (2002) present a wide variety of 
gold deposit models that have been defined in time-equivalent rocks and similar structural 
settings in the KMB. Unless otherwise noted, the following information on deposit models is 
derived from these references.  
 

Virtually all of the significant lode gold occurrences in the KMB are associated with late 
Cretaceous to early Tertiary volcanic and/or plutonic rocks which post-date the Kuskokwim 
Group post-accretionary basic fill sediments. At least five broad deposit types have been 
identified in the KMB: 
 

1. Plutonic-related mesothermal gold deposits similar to those in the Tintina Gold Belt 
of Alaska and the adjacent Yukon Territory. Recent discoveries in this belt have 
outlined a series of distinctive mineral occurrences which appear to be genetically 
related to mid-Cretaceous to Early Tertiary plutonic activity which affected a large 
area of northwestern British Columbia, Yukon, Alaska and the Russian Far East 
(Flanigan and others, 2000). This work, based on extensive geologic and structural 
mapping and analytical studies (major and trace element analysis, fluid inclusion 
microthermometry, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, and isotope analysis) has provided new 
information regarding gold metallogenesis in the Tintina Gold Belt as well as in the 
adjacent and overlapping KMB (Lang and Baker, 2001; Baker and others, 2006; 
Burns and others., 1991; Lelacheur and others., 1991; Hollister, 1991; McCoy and 
others., 1995; McCoy and others., 1997; McCoy and others, 2002; Mortensen and 
others, 2000; Newberry and others, 1995; Eremin, 1995; Bundtzen and Miller, 1997). 
A synthesis of this information suggests a mineral deposit model in which metal and 
high CO2 bearing fluids fractionate from ilmenite series, I-type intrusions during the 
late phases of differentiation (porphyritic granites). Depending on the rate of ascent of 
these hydrothermal fluids, the level of the crust they reach before depositing their 
metallic budget and their associated intrusive rocks, two distinctly different 
metallogenic systems can form, in some cases in the same mineral prospect. In 
deeper, higher pressure settings gold mineralization can form at higher temperatures 
(400°-600°C) and low sulfur fugacities. Such systems are characterized by elevated 
Au ± Bi ± Te ± W ± As mineralization. Sulfur-depleted metallic minerals such as 
native bismuth, native arsenic, maldonite and loellingite often form in such 
environments. These higher temperature systems display isotopic, trace element and

 10
fluid inclusion evidence suggesting almost exclusively magmatic fluid involvement 
and are thought to form in more proximal intrusive settings. In higher level, lower 
pressure settings, mineralization forms at lower temperatures (250°-400°C) and 
higher sulfur fugacities and is characterized by elevated Au ± Ag ± As ± Cu ± Sb ± 
Hg ± Pb ± Zn. These lower temperature systems display isotopic, trace element and 
fluid inclusion evidence suggesting significant meteoric water mixing and are thought 
to form in more distal intrusive settings. A synthesis of this information (Hart and 
others., 2002, McCoy and others., 1997) suggests an ore deposit model in which gold 
and high CO2 bearing fluids fractionate from ilmenite series, I-type mid-Cretaceous 
intrusions during the late phases of differentiation. The gold is deposited in 
anastomosing pegmatite and/or feldspar selvage quartz veins. Brittle fracturing and 
continued fluid convection lead to concentration of gold bearing fluids in intrusions 
and schist-hosted brittle quartz-sericite shear zones. Carbonate and/or calcareous 
horizons host W-Au skarns and replacement deposits. Structurally prepared 
calcareous and/or carbonaceous horizons may host bulk-minable replacement 
deposits. These occur most distal to the intrusions within favorable host rocks. The 
various styles of significant hypogene gold mineralization in the KMB and Tintina 
Gold Belt are presented in Lang and others (2001) and Baker (2003).  

2. Plutonic-hosted mesothermal copper-gold-polymetallic deposits: these occurrences 
are hosted in plutonic rocks ranging from alkali gabbro to granite. Host rocks are 
generally reduced and of meta-aluminous chemical affinity. Deeper levels of these 
occurrences contain chalcopyrite, molybdenite, scheelite and arsenopyrite while 
higher levels contain Ag-Sb sulfosalts, stibnite and free gold. Oxide skarn deposits in 
this class often contain copper oxides after bornite and chalcopyrite with coarse 
visible gold. Mineralization can be vertically zoned from host plutonic stock through 
hornfels cap into overlying volcanics. Alteration assemblages are dominated by 
ankeritic, potassic, propylitic and silicic alteration. Skarns contain early garnet-
magnetite followed by later wollastonite alteration.  

3. Peraluminous granite porphyry gold-polymetallic deposits: these occurrences are 
hosted in granite porphyry dikes and sills the grade upward into shallow intrusives. 
Host rocks include peraluminous alaskite to alkalic granite, often with garnet. The 
intrusives show depleted heavy REE trends and can be either reduced or oxidized. 
Metallic minerals include stibnite, cinnabar, arsenopyrite and Sb-sulfosalts. Generally 
emplaced at high levels in high angle structures or along low-angle gravity and/or 
thrust faults. Alteration assemblages are dominated by argillic, potassic and silicic 
alteration plus dickite. This model type hosts the +40 Moz Donlin Creek deposit. 
Current knowledge of Vinasale project indicates an affinity for this mineralization 
style. Vinasale also has been compared to Chimney Creek, Nevada and Porgera, New 
Guinea based on petrochemistry, alteration and ore mineralogy (DiMarchi and others, 
1991).  

4. Plutonic-related boron enriched silver-tin-polymetallic deposits: these occurrences are 
hosted in high level plutonic rocks and overlying hornfels and greisen alteration 
zones. Host rocks are generally reduced and of meta-aluminous to peraluminous 
chemical affinity. Two distinct age groups occur (65-70 Ma and 58-62 Ma) with the 
younger ages more common. Metallic minerals include cassiterite, Ag-Sb-sulfosalts 
chalcopyrite, and galena. Mineralization occurs in veins, stockworks and replacement 
zones. Alteration assemblages are dominated by boron minerals (tourmaline, axinite) 
with silicic alteration. This model type has only been recognized in the last 10 years

 11
and accounts for none the known lode gold resources in the KMB. It is potentially a 
significant host type for silver resources. 

5. Epithermal gold-silver deposits: these occurrences are poorly understood and poorly 
documented in the KMB. Host rocks can range from sediments to volcanics and 
related intrusives of all phases. Host rocks include highly altered olivine basalts, 
meta-aluminous reduced granite to monzonite plutons, and calc-alkalic to andesite to 
rhyolite volcanics. Metallic minerals include stibnite, cinnabar, arsenopyrite and Sb-
Ag-sulfosalts and free gold. Generally emplaced at high levels in high angle 
structures that are distal to plutonic centers. Alteration assemblages are dominated by 
silica carbonate plus dickite, potassic-phyllic and/or chalcedony-adularia 
assemblages.  

 
 
MINERALIZATION 
 
 Historic soil sampling (626 samples) identified three anomalous areas in the Central 
Zone, Northeast Zone and South Zone, each underlain by intrusive rock near the crest of 
Vinasale Mountain. A 30 ppb gold isopleth measuring 450 meters by 600 meters defined the 
Central Zone, which is located 0.75 km west of the summit of Vinasale Mountain. The Northeast 
Zone is located 900 meters northeast of the summit of Vinasale Mountain and measures 1200 
meters by 600 meters and the South Zone which lies 1000 meters southeast of the summit of 
Vinasale Mountain measures 600 meters by 60 meters (Figure 4). Each of these zones has a 
multi-element signature with gold and associated anomalous arsenic, bismuth, antimony, 
molybdenum and tungsten. Arsenic provides the most coherent halo surrounding all three of the 
gold-anomalous zones. The Central Zone soil values have a gold anomaly nearly an order of 
magnitude higher than that seen in the other zones. As a consequence, the Central Zone became a 
priority exploration target. The Northeast Zone is thought to straddle the contact between 
intrusive rocks of the Vinasale pluton and surrounding Kuskokwim Group sediments, however, 
poor exposure and limited subsurface data currently make precise placement of the intrusive – 
sediment contact impossible. 
 

Currently known potentially economic mineralization at Vinasale is hosted in a 69 MA 
biotite quartz porphyry monzonite intrusive complex that contains associated intrusive and 
hydrothermal breccia phases (Figure 4). Sericitic, silicic, dolomitic, propylitic and tourmaline 
alteration occur peripheral to quartz-dolomite-sulfide veining. Gold grades appear to be related 
to the presence of arsenopyrite and antimony. The morphology of gold mineralization was 
modeled both as stacked sub-horizontal sheets roughly conforming to the occurrence of intrusive 
breccia phases and as steeply dipping areas thought to be related to structures (DiMarchi, 1996). 
This mineralization was well constrained within a 500 ppb gold soil anomaly.  
 
 DiMarchi and others (1994) noted that significant drill intervals were sometimes 
associated with magmatic and/or hydrothermal breccias. Although both hydrothermal and 
magmatic breccias are within the volumes of rock that returned greater than 1 ppm gold over 20 
feet, the association of these breccias with mineralization is not unique. DiMarchi and others, 
1994 states, "The magmatic breccias are characterized by sub-rounded clasts of porphyritic 
quartz monzonite and subordinate vein quartz in an equigranular fine-grained monzonite matrix. 
Magmatic breccias have not been observed outside of the Central Zone. Locally, the magmatic 
breccias grade vertically and laterally into hydrothermal breccias."  

CARACOL 
P.O. Box 11233, Reno, NV 89510 

775-379-3898 



 12
 
 Hydrothermal breccias are described as occurring as irregular pods and lenses adjacent to 
magmatic breccias, and DiMarchi and others (1994) propose that "hydrothermal breccias may 
have formed from periodic boiling in response to rapid (or localized) drops in pressure." These 
breccias exhibit sericite, silicification and dolomitization of clasts and matrix, giving evidence to 
a complex hydrothermal history. Hydrothermal breccias may hypothetically be due to cycling 
release of the pressures confining hydrothermal fluids.  
 

The association of breccias, both magmatic and hydrothermal, with significant gold 
mineralization, suggests a dynamic environment for gold deposition. Such an environment can 
be explained by steep gradients in temperature and pressure conditions that result in brecciation 
and mineral precipitation. The structural environment described by DiMarchi and others (1994) 
easily can be used to explain steep temperature and pressure gradients. The conditions necessary 
to cause breccias and mineralization to form sub-horizontal tabular masses is less easily 
explained. Conditions under which sigma three, the least principle stress, can be vertical, and the 
resulting dilatent zone is horizontal can occur only if the horizontal pressures are greater than the 
vertical pressures. Evidence of bidirectional horizontal confining pressures at Vinasale currently 
is lacking. More detailed structural modeling will be required to determine if sub-horizontal ore 
controls exist at Vinasale.  
 
 A total of 67 drill holes were completed on the project with most of the drilling focused 
on the Central Zone because it hosts the largest and strongest soil gold anomaly (Table 3). A 
series of NE and N-S photo linears and VLF anomalies "suggests a structural control of the 
emplacement of the intrusion breccias" (DiMarchi, 1993), and it is these breccias that are most 
clearly associated with significant gold mineralization. Only 8 of 67 drill holes completed at 
Vinasale are angle holes and only five of the holes drilled in the Central Zone are angle holes, 
suggesting that NE and N-S photo linears and VLF anomalies cited by DiMarchi (1993) were not 
adequately tested by previous drilling programs.

EXPLORATION 
 
 As per section 12 of NI43-101-F1, all exploration work conducted by parties other than 
Freegold is discussed under "History", "Geologic Setting" or "Mineralization".  
 

The goal of the 2007 program was to evaluate the larger land block for its potential to 
host other Vinasale style occurrences as well as to assist Doyon with their final land selection 
under the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act. Work during 2007 included an airborne 
geophysical survey (1788 line-km) flown by Fugro Airborne Surveys (Fugro, 2008) and district-
wide reconnaissance geochemical sampling program in order to address the wider exploration 
targets, Table 4 is a summary of significant work completed on the Vinasale project in 2007 and 
2008.  
 

Sampling of streams draining Vinasale Mountain also was conducted for comparison 
purposes (Table 4). Sampling of pan concentrates and sediments in 2007 focused on drainages 
radial to Vinasale Mountain (23 sample sites), Selatna Mountain (62 sample sites) and Black 
River (95 sample sites). Within the 2007 database, gold has the strongest correlation with arsenic 
(0.843382) and antimony (0.695027). Bismuth (0.035942), molybdenum (0.029359) and 
tungsten (0.026019) are nearly uncorrelated.

As expected, gold from the 2007 work is strongly anomalous on Vinasale Mountain, 

clearly correlating with the previously identified Central Zone, Northeast Zone and South Zone. 
Gold, arsenic and antimony values show some crude zonation in soils, where a central core has 
higher values than the peripheral lower values. Sediment samples on the east side of Selatna 
Mountain are strongly gold anomalous, but arsenic, bismuth, antimony and tungsten is only 
weakly anomalous. Review of the total field aeromagnetics indicates this zone may be near a

 15
contact of lithologies of different susceptibilities, but the zone lacks the magnetic depletion 
indicative of intrusive rock-related alteration. 
 

The Black River zones hosts a few widely scattered single point gold anomalies as well 
as bismuth anomalies, but other trace elements are not anomalous. There is very little 
aeromagnetic character to the area with anomalous gold, so the likelihood of a significant 
mineral system is low, however multi frequencies indicate a break in the map pattern suggesting 
a lithologic contact or structure between less susceptible rocks.  
 

The airborne results clearly show the intrusive body at the core of Vinasale Mountain as a 
resistivity high and a magnetic high. Although the line spacing was larger than desirable the 
Vinasale pluton was readily detected on at least 3 flight lines. A small plug-like feature was 
visible on the magnetics on the west bank of the Katlitna River, to the east of Vinasale Mountain, 
but other than that no pattern similar to the magnetic and electromagnetic surrounding Vinasale 
Mountain was observed (Walcott, 2008a). 
 

Peripheral zones of lower magnetic susceptibility may indicate magnetite-destructive 
alteration zones in the Kuskokwim Group sediments (Figure 7) while resistivity low anomalies 
peripheral to the Vinasale intrusion may indicate structural or mineralogical conductors. The 
most extensive areas of magnetic and resistivity lows are outside of previously drilled areas and 
presented compelling exploration targets for future work.  
 

In 2008, Peter E. Walcott and Associates Limited was contracted to complete an induced 
polarization survey (21.1 line-km) on areas directly surrounding the known historical resource at 
the Central zone (Walcott, 2008b; Figure 6). The objective was to determine the IP/Resistivity 
signature of the Central zone and to test the area to the immediate north and north-east of the 
Central zone.  
 

A chargeability anomaly is associated with the known zone, and this anomaly remains 
open to the south. To the north of the Central Zone area the anomaly weakens significantly 
however remains present in areas where no drilling has taken place. Further potential for small 
deposits is known to occur in the north-east where further anomalous chargeability readings are 
seen. A strong IP chargeability high occurs along the western, northern edges of the 2008 IP grid 
and is suggestive of sulfide mineralization, possibly within the hornfelsed contact zone 
surrounding the Vinasale pluton.  
 

The high resistivity (> 4000 Ohm*m) features are interpreted to be the porphyritic quartz 
monzonite intrusive units while the medium resistive features (1000 – 4000 Ohm*m) are 
interpreted to be the north trending steeply dipping quartz monzonite magmatic breccia. Several 
areas within breccias with anomalous chargeability readings (12 – 18 mV/V) likely caused by 
pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization should be considered as potential targets including 
directly north of the Central zone at depth (Figure 6, Figure 8).  
 
 

Walcott (2008b) recommended further IP surveying across the North-east zone to the 
edge of the intrusive. Additional lines were recommended on the south to define additional areas 
that may have the potential to host mineralization. Optimal coverage recommended was IP 
surveying at 200m line spacing across the whole intrusive (Walcott, 2008b). Infill lines at 100 m

spacing should also be considered for areas that warrant further detail. In addition a couple of 
traverses should be carried out in the Katlitna river area to test for the occurrence of sulfides 
there (P. Walcott, oral comm., 2010). 
 
 
DRILLING 
 
 As of the date of this report, Freegold Ventures has not conducted or contracted others to 
conduct drilling on the Vinasale project. Historic drilling results at Vinasale are summarized 
under "History" and results are discussed under Geologic Setting and Mineralization. 
 
 Details relating to drilling techniques, equipment, and other related drilling data for the 
WGM drilling program in 1979 are not available to the author.  
 
 During 1990 core drilling was conducted by Boyles Brothers Drilling using a helicopter 
portable BBS25 core rig (DiMarchi and others, 1991a). All holes were drilled with HQ core (2.5 
inch diameter). Average production was 71 feet per 24-hour drilling day, including move time 
between holes. Average core recovery exceeded 95%.  
 
 During 1991 core drilling was conducted by Boyles Brothers Drilling using a helicopter 
portable BB15 core rig (DiMarchi and others, 1991b). A total of 14,517 feet of HQ and 1,358 
feet of NX core was drilled during 1991. Average production was 120 feet per 24-hour drilling 
day, including move time between holes.  
 
 During 1994, ASA-Montague completed 17,265 feet of HQ and NQ diamond drilling on 
the Vinasale project (DiMarchi and others, 1994). Drilling was completed by Boyles Brothers 
Drilling using two BB-15 helicopter-portable drilling rigs. Drilling rates averaged 278 feet per 
24-hour drilling day, including move time between holes. At the end of the program, a 4,000 foot 
steel waterline was left on the project. This line extends from the Alder Creek placer workings to 
the Central zone at the top of Vinasale Mountain.  
 
 All of the drilling completed to date at Vinasale was conducted between 1979 and 1994 
(Table 5). The major program in 1991 was conducted by CAGC/Placer Dome while the 1994 
drill program was conducted by ASA-Montague.

 During 1990, CAGC collected rock grab (3-6 pounds each) and rock chip samples (8-10 
pounds each) along with stream silt and soil samples on the Vinasale project. Soil samples were 
collected with shovels except where soil depth exceeded shovel length. In those locations, hand 
augers were used to collect soil. All soil samples came from depths of 1 to 4 feet. Sample 
descriptions were kept in field notebooks and sample locations were tied to a 42,000 line-foot 
grid covering the project (DiMarchi and others, 1991a). All drill core was logged on detailed 
logging sheets and samples marked for assay and split in the field. One-half of the core was 
shipped for geochemical analysis and the other half was retained and shipped to Fairbanks were 
currently is stored at Doyon's secure warehouse. 
 
 No surface sampling was conducted on the Vinasale project in 1991 (DiMarchi and 
others, 1991b). All drill core was logged on detailed logging sheets and samples marked for 
assay and split in the field. One-half of the core was shipped for geochemical analysis and the 
other half was retained and shipped to Fairbanks were currently is stored at Doyon's secure 
warehouse. 
 
 During 1994 ASA Inc. collected 20 rock samples from the Northeast zone. These 
samples were collected in canvas bags, and where possible retained a hand specimen (DiMarchi 
and others, 1994). In addition, a total of 771 soil samples were collected from the Northeast zone 
(543), South zone (147) and Alder Creek zone (81). Soil samples were collected from the "C" 
horizon where possible, and if not possible, poor sample quality was noted on the sample card. 
Core intervals were selected based on run blocks and lithology. Samples were collected in bags 
and labeled with the year, hole number and footage interval. All drill core was logged on detailed 
logging sheets and samples marked for assay and split in the field. One-half of the core was 
shipped for geochemical analysis and the other half was retained and shipped to Fairbanks were 
currently is stored at Doyon's secure warehouse. 
 

A total of 161 soil, 20 pan concentrate, and 10 rock samples were collected during 
Freegold's 2007 Vinasale project work program. Sample description data for all pan concentrate 
and sediment samples were collected in the field and then transferred to the camp computer on a 
regular basis. GPS coordinates were taken at each site and downloaded to the project computer 
for inclusion in GIS databases. All field data was then summarized and included in the existing 
project databases. All grab rock samples were accompanied by a lithology sample that was 
retained for reference purposes. 
 
 
SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
 Details regarding the sampling preparation, analysis and security methods utilized by 
WGM at the Vinasale project are not available to the authors. 
 
 During 1990, CAGC utilized Chemex Labs to complete all geochemical sample analyses 
(DiMarchi and others, 1990a). Sample preparation was conducted in Anchorage, Alaska and 
analytical work was completed in Vancouver, B.C. All rock and core samples were crushed, 
split, dried and pulverized to 250-350 grams 90% pass -150 mesh. The 30 gram analytic portion 
was fire assayed with atomic absorption finish for gold, and a 32 element inductively couple 
plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) analysis was conducted on another analytic portion using 

CARACOL

 18
aqua regia digestion. Soils were dried and sieved to -80 mesh, then a 30 gram split was fire 
assayed for gold with atomic absorption finish, and another analytic portion was digested in aqua 
regia for a 32 element ICP analysis. Where gold values exceeded 10,000 ppb, the sample was 
rerun by 1 assay-ton lead fire assay with gravimetric finish. 
 
 During 1991, CAGC utilized Chemex Labs to complete all drill core geochemical sample 
analyses (DiMarchi and others, 1991b). Sample preparation was conducted in Anchorage, Alaska 
and analytical work was completed in Vancouver, B.C. All core samples were crushed, split, 
dried and pulverized to 250-350 grams 90% pass -150 mesh. A one assay-ton analytic portion 
was fire assayed for gold with atomic absorption finish, and a 32 element inductively couple 
plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) analysis was conducted on another analytic portion using 
aqua regia digestion.  
 

ASA-Montague used Chemex Labs during their 1994 field program (DiMarchi and 
others, 1994). Sample preparation was conducted in Anchorage, Alaska and analytical work was 
completed in Vancouver, B.C. All rock and core samples were crushed, split, dried and 
pulverized to 250-350 grams 90% pass -150 mesh. The 30 gram analytic portion was fire assayed 
with atomic absorption finish for gold, and a 32 element inductively couple plasma emission 
spectroscopy (ICP) analysis was conducted on another analytic portion using aqua regia 
digestion. Soils were dried and sieved to -80 mesh, then a 30 gram split was fire assayed for gold 
with atomic absorption finish, and another analytic portion was digested in aqua regia for a 32 
element ICP analysis (DiMarchi and others, 1994).  
 

All samples collected for Freegold's 2007 program on Vinasale were placed in double, 
woven nylon shipping sacks, secured with plastic wire ties and transported to via commercial air 
transport to Fairbanks, Alaska. Samples were then picked up by Avalon Development, checked 
for sample integrity and then delivered to Alaska Assay Laboratories in Fairbanks, Alaska. All 
sample preparation and gold geochemical analyses was conducted by Alaska Assay while multi-
element geochemical analyses was completed by Acme Analytical Labs of Vancouver, B.C. 
Each sediment and pan concentrate sample was dried and sieved to minus 80 mesh size prior to 
analysis. Rock samples were crushed to -150 mesh and a 30 gram spit was analyzed for gold by 
lead collection fire assay techniques with an atomic absorption finish. A separate split was 
analyzed for a suite of trace elements using a four acid digestion procedure followed by ICP 
techniques with an atomic emission spectrographic finish. All rejects were retained in Fairbanks 
and all pulps were retained in Vancouver during the field season. 
 
 All completed and certified 2007 geochemical data was posted on Avalon's private 
account where it was retrieved, checked and archived at Avalon's Fairbanks office. Hard copies 
of each analytical certificate were delivered to Avalon with invoices. At year-end, portable 
document file (pdf) digital data was sent to Avalon for permanent digital storage of each 
certificate issued to the Vinasale project in 2007. Avalon's digital data are backed up on a 
weekly basis with archived tape back ups stored off-site in a fire-proof safe. 
 

At the end of the 2007 season, all pulps were returned to Avalon's Fairbanks warehouse 
for permanent storage.

DATA VERIFICATION 
 
 Details regarding the data verification methods utilized by WGM and Central Alaska 
Gold Corp. at the Vinasale project are not available to the authors. 
 
 DiMarchi and others (1994) reported that during the 1994 program ASA-Montague 
implemented the following quality assurance/quality control steps:  
 
 Quality control procedures for sample analysis included the inclusion of blanks, standards 
and duplicates into the sample sequence. Ten percent of all samples analyzed are quality control 
samples. On average, every 40 sample sent to the lab included 2 standards, 1 duplicate and 1 
blank. Standards were provided by USGS and CANMET. Computer-controlled instrumentation 
(i.e. ICP instruments) automatically transfer the data to the mainframe computer ensuring a lack 
of transcription errors. Manually entered data was verified by a second technician.  
 

1) ASA inserted CANMET gold standards with core samples from mineralized intervals. 
These served as an independent verification of the accuracy of Chemex's fire assay 
procedures. 

2) ASA requested that Chemex also assay the "clean granite" material after it was used to 
clean the crushers. This served as an additional blank sample to verify the lack of gold 
contamination between sample preparation batches. 

3) ASA monitored Chemex's geochemical results for all standards and blanks, in order to 
detect statistically significant variations. We found that the gold assay for only one 
standard sample exceeded our 1 standard deviation threshold. Fortunately none of our 
samples from this batch contained anomalous gold. 

4) ASA resubmitted 10% (36 samples) of all mineralized samples from the 1990 drill holes 
at Vinasale for an umpire gold fire assay at Chemex. The largest difference between the 
two generations of assay data was 0.002 opt Au. This exercise strengthened the general 
credibility of Chemex Labs but also validated their consistency from year to year. 

5) ASA also resubmitted 10% (78 samples) of all mineralized 1994 core samples for umpire 
gold fire assay at Bondar Clegg in Vancouver. This served as a further check of the 
integrity of the Chemex data. 

 
ASA compared the hand-entered data in the ASA computerized database with the original 

data contained on all the drill logs to check for entry errors. There were more than 60,000 
computer entries made in the field from core logging forms. ASA also compared the 
computerized geochemical data with the certified hard copies for all the intercepts with gold 
values exceeding 0.029 opt Au. 

 
During the 2007 exploration program, Freegold submitted blanks and standards that 

comprised just over 10% of the total samples submitted. Blanks were composed of Browns Hill 
Quarry basalt from the Fairbanks Mining District, Alaska as the first sample in each sample 
shipment and thereafter on a 1 for 40 basis into the sample sequence. Extensive previous analysis 
of this same blank rock type has given Avalon a large geochemical database for use on a 
comparative basis. Preparation of samples by Alaska Assay and analyses performed by Alaska 
Assay and Acme on blanks from the Vinasale project indicate no unusual or spurious sample 
results. Commercial gold standards were inserted into the geochemical sample stream on a 1 for

2) A sample of 9403 drill core gave an abrasion index of 0.2238gm. 
3) There was moderate agreement between the assay and calculated head grades of the 

Vinasale Mountain bulk composite (Hole 9410: 303-366ft, Hole 9411: 450-492ft, and 
Hole 9412: 438-586ft) 

4) An overall gold recovery of only 6% was achieved by cyanide leaching a sample of bulk 
composite in the presence of activated carbon. 

5) Bulk flotation of the Vinasale Mountain composite recovered 90% of the gold, 88.2% of 
the arsenic and 91% of the sulfur into a cleaner concentrate representing 6.95% of the 
feed mass. 

6) An overall gold recovery of only 11.4% was achieved by cyanide leaching a sample of 
bulk composite cleaner concentrate in the presence of activated carbon after ultra fine 
grinding to a P80 of 6.4 microns. 

7) An overall gold recovery of 87.4% was obtained with alkaline oxidation of a sample of 
flotation concentrate ground to a P80 of 6.4 microns and subsequent cyanide leaching of 
the alkaline oxidation residue. 

8) An overall recovery of 43.9% was obtained with alkaline oxidation of a sample of 
flotation concentrate at it's "as received" size and subsequent cyanide leaching of the 
alkaline oxidation residues. 

9) Roasting of a sample of flotation concentrate resulted in a 25.0% weight loss. 
10) Leaching of the calcine resulted in a gold recovery of 59.2% after 72 hours. 
11) Bacterial oxidation test work indicated that a gold recovery of 80.3% was possible after 

complete iron release.

MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

There currently are no resources or reserves on the Vinasale property that comply with 
the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by 
CIM Council on August 20, 2000 and should not be relied upon. Historical resource estimates 
calculated by parties other than Freegold are presented under "History".  
 
 
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENT 
PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 
 
 Vinasale is not presently a development or production property. 
 
 
OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no other data available to the author that 
relate directly to the lode gold potential of the Vinasale project. 
 
 
INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 The Vinasale gold project is located in western Alaska, approximately seventeen miles 
south of McGrath and 400 kilometers southwest of Fairbanks. The project is situated on the east 
bank of the Kuskokwim River. Free Gold Recovery, USA owns 72 State of Alaska mining 
claims covering 11,520 acres and has leased 89,583.54 acres from Doyon Limited, one of 13 
regional Alaska Native corporations. Access to the property is via commercial aircraft to 
McGrath, and then to the property via helicopter, or via seasonal barge up the Kuskokwim River.  
 
 The property is underlain by Cretaceous-ages Kuskokwim Group shales and greywackes 
that have been intruded by a Tertiary-aged porphyritic quartz monzonite intrusive complex... 
East-west, north-south and northeast-southwest trending structures cut the sediments and 
intrusions. Gold mineralization identified to date is hosted by magmatic and hydrothermal 
breccia phases of a quartz monzonite phase of the intrusive complex. Arsenic has the strongest 
correlation with gold while antimony, bismuth and tungsten also correlate to a lesser extent. 
Gold-related alteration includes sericitic alteration, dolomitic alteration and silicification as 
pervasive flooding and as quartz veinlets. The margin of the intrusion at Vinasale Mountain 
exhibits hornfelsing of the sediments and is associated with both an aeromagnetic and resistivity 
low in addition to an as yet-fully defined IP chargeability high. No drilling has been conducted in 
the hornfels zone at Vinasale.

Placer gold was discovered in Alder Creek draining the south side of Vinasale Mountain 
in approximately 1922, with total placer gold production estimated at less than 125 ounces. No 
lode production has occurred in the area. 
 
 Lode exploration in the early 1990s identified gold-in-soil anomalies at the Central, 
South and Northeast zone near the crest of Vinasale Mountain. These anomalies were drilled 
tested, with subsequent follow-up drilling in the Central Zone. Total core drilling to date is 
25,247 feet. The Central Zone was investigated by 21 drill holes within an area measuring 
approximately 185 meters by 185 meters (600 feet by 600 feet) and intersected one or more 
intervals of greater than 6 meters (20 feet) grading more than 1 gram of gold per tonne (0.029 
opt). Mineralization is open to expansion in several directions. Review of drill core indicates that 
higher gold grades commonly occur with magmatic and/or hydrothermal breccias. The majority 
of drill holes were vertical but some of the best grade-thickness intervals came from angle holes, 
suggesting the possible presence of as-yet undefined high angle controls on gold mineralization. 
 
 Several historical resource estimates were completed on the Vinasale gold project prior to 
implementation of NI-43-101 reporting standards. The most recent historical resource estimate 
(1995) totals 16,049,000 short tons grading 0.060 ounces of gold per ton (962,760 ounces). 
These historical resource calculations are reported here for historical accuracy purposes 
only. These historical resource calculations are not NI 43-101 compliant and do not comply 
with the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines 
adopted by CIM Council on August 20, 2000.  
 
 The available data identifies host rock and regional structural similarities between 
Vinasale Mountain and the +40 million ounce Donlin Creek deposit approximately 135 
kilometers to the southwest. Both are hosted primarily in Tertiary plutonic rocks which intrude 
Kuskokwim Group sediments and both are controlled by northeast trending structures. Both 
Donlin and Vinasale have quartz and carbonate alteration as well as anomalous arsenic and 
antimony trace elemental associations. In addition, the Vinasale gold project is similar to the 
Trun gold-tungsten deposit, Bulgaria, where significant gold-tungsten mineralization is hosted in 
hornfelsed sediments surrounding a previously explored gold-bearing intermediate intrusive.  
 

Additional exploration work is warranted at the Vinasale gold project.  
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Based on previous field, laboratory and literature studies completed to date, the following 
recommendations for future work are offered: 
 

1. IP Program: Complete additional IP surveying across the north-east zone to the edge 
of the intrusive as well as complete additional lines to the south to define additional 
areas that may have the potential to host mineralization. Surveys should be completed 
on 200 meter line spacing as recommended by Walcott (2008b). Infill lines at 100 
meter spacing should also be considered for areas that warrant further detail. The total 
estimated cost of the geophysical program is $300,000 (Table 7).

2. Core Drilling: Diamond core drilling needs to both upgrade the known mineralization 

at the Central Zone and to identify new mineralized zones (Figure 8). Confirmation 
drilling of previously identified mineralization is recommended to insure reliability of 
previous drilling data. Grid drilling may both improve the confidence of potential ore 
blocks and improve the knowledge of boundaries to mineralization. Angle drilling is 
recommended to intersect steeply controlled mineralization. Angle drilling should 
help clarify the morphology of mineralization as well as define possible extensions of 
mineralization. The budget plans for 10,000 feet of direct drilling costing at an 
estimated $50 per foot and a loaded all-in cost of $125 per foot. It is expected that the 
IP survey conducted in June will generate additional and/or refined drill hole 
proposals. All drill core management, including logging, photographing, splitting, 
sampling, QAQC sample insertion, and packaging for transport to assay lab, will 
occur onsite at the core logging tent located in camp. Core samples will be shipped 
out from camp at pre-arranged times to coincide with supplies coming in to camp. A 
standardized core log and core logging procedure will be defined in advance to insure 
that relevant data is consistently recorded for each drill hole. Drill hole location and 
geological information will be utilized to produce on-site cross-sections to help guide 
on-going drilling activities. These data also will be shipped via email for construction 
of digital cross-sections. The total estimated cost of the core drilling program is 
$1,250,000 (Table 7).  

 
Based on the above recommendations, the 2010 Vinasale project budget will be 

approximately $1,550,000

2. I am a graduate of Hamilton College, Clinton, N.Y., with a B.A. degree in Geology (1978). I 
am also a graduate of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada with an M.S. degree in 
Mineral Exploration (1983). 
 
3. I am a member of the Geological Society of Nevada. 
 
4. From 1979 to the present I have been actively employed in various capacities in the mining 
industry in numerous locations in North America, Central America, South America, Eastern 
Europe, Asia, and Africa. I worked on the subject property for five days in September 2009, and 
have worked and prospected on genetically similar properties worldwide. 
 
5. I have read the definition of "Qualified Person" set out in National Instrument 43-101 (NI43-
101) and certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional organization (as 
defined by NI43-101) and past relevant work experience, I fulfill the requirements to be a 
"Qualified Person" for the purposes of NI43-101. 
 
6. I am responsible for preparations of all sections of the report entitled Executive Summary for 
the Vinasale Gold Property, McGrath Mining District, Alaska, and dated March 25th, 2010 (the 
"Technical Report") relating to the Vinasale gold property. The author has not conducted a 
recent personal inspection of the property because the property that is the subject of the technical 
report is an early stage exploration property and because seasonal weather conditions would have 
prevented the author from accessing any part of the property and/or obtaining beneficial 
information from a personal inspection. As per section 6.2.3 of NI43-101, the author intends to 
conduct a personal inspection of the Vinasale project as soon as weather conditions permit in the 
spring of 2010.  
 
7. I have not had prior involvement with the property that is the subject of the Technical Report. 
 
8. I am not aware of any material fact or material change with respect to the subject matter of this 
Technical Report that is not reflected in the Technical Report, the omission to disclose which 
would make the Technical Report misleading. As of the date of this certificate, to the best of the 
qualified person's knowledge, information and belief, the technical report contains all scientific 
and technical information that is available to the author and which is required to be disclosed to 
make the technical report not misleading.
