The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

ITEM 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The current report presents an update of the preliminary economic assessment report 
("Scoping study") of the Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project. The writing of this update was 
triggered by recent release of the autumn 2009 drill campaign and the publication of 

indicated resources on Paul zone by SGS Canada Inc. 
The report intends to disclose the details of the new 
resource estimates and to provide a guide in the decision 
regarding the investment required to bring the project 
into prefeasibility as well as to outline the general work-
program toward which the project shall proceed in order 
to make it economically viable. The project still being in 
early development stage, this report does not intend to 
provide an accurate economical assessment or a 
detailed engineering of the required infrastructures. 
Conclusions and recommendations call upon several 
assumptions, numerous discussions, the author's 
experience and common sense. 

 
D'Arianne acquired the initial property (42 titles) from the Fonds minier du Saguenay-Lac-
St-Jean (FMSLS), a non-profit organization providing support to local prospectors. Four of 
the titles have a residual 1% NSR attached. From then, compilation and field work outlined 
other occurrences, which lead d'Arianne to recently acquire land tenure to the actual 376 
map designed cells covering approximately 20 893.1 hectares. The property is located in 
the Grenville geological province, north of Lac St-Jean, approximately 200 km from the city 
of Saguenay. The mineralization is associated with the margin of the Lac-St-Jean 
Anorthosite Complex, an extensive intrusive system covering about 20 000 square km. 
Ilmenite, apatite and titanomagnetite mineralization forms numerous scattered occurrences 
within this Middle Proterozoic intrusive, which were sporadically explored in the last 60 
years. 
 
In 1995, following a regional reconnaissance, the FMSLSJ initiated various prospecting 
projects in the Chutes-des-Passes area, already known for its copper and nickel 
occurrences. Initial properties were staked (ground posts) for this commodity, and 
exploration projects were concomitantly initiated by Virginia Gold Mines and Soquem. 
Ilmenite and apatite bearing nelsonites, segregated from the anorthositic magma, were

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

discovered in 1998 by the FMSLSJ prospectors and a geologist from the ministère des 
Ressources naturelles et de la Faune.  
 

D'Arianne, then interested in developing titanium projects, 
carried out a limited amount of exploration work on the 
property from 1999 to 2001. This included mapping and 
prospecting, limited drilling and limited metallurgical work. A 
non-NI-43-101 non-compliant inferred resource was 
calculated. Mineralurgy bench scale testing indicated the 
ore as being amenable to produce a commercially 
acceptable 41.39% P2O5 apatite and a 46.6% TiO2 ilmenite 
concentrate. In the same period, a drilling campaign on an 

adjacent property by Virginia Gold Mines, aiming at nickel-copper sulphide mineralization, 
intersected 7.56% P2O5 and 9.65% TiO2 over 117.9 metres. However, considered the then 
prevailing ilmenite and phosphate prices (US$/90 ton each), the project was considered 
not sufficiently profitable and set aside. 
 
The recent rise in phosphate prices, which peaked $450/ton in July 2008, encouraged 
d'Arianne to re-evaluate the Lac à Paul Project in 2008. D'Arianne carried out a two phase 
drilling program for 4731 metres in Paul, Manouane and zone 2, which enabled SGS 
Canada Inc. to estimate a NI-43-101 compliant inferred resources.  
 
Metallurgical bench scale tests, completed at SGS-Lakefield, 
included apatite flotation test on 3 samples, one each from 
the Lac à Paul, Manouane and zone 2 occurrences. The 
resulting apatite concentrate had a grade between 38.6 to 
40.1% P2O5 (88% BPL), with a recovery between 85.0% and 
91.5%. These numbers are comparable to what was obtained 
in 1999 by IOS. No serious attempts were made by SGS to recover ilmenite, so only the 
preliminary results obtained by IOS in 1999 are available on this regard. 
 
A third drilling campaign was conducted in fall 2009 in order to test various exploration 
targets selected from diverse regional aeromagnetic surveys. 
 
Under the author's recommendation, a fourth drilling campaign was carried in autumn 
2009 in order to improve the drilling pattern on the lac à Paul deposit. Results from this 
campaign enable SGS Canada Inc. to update the resource estimates. Resources, using 
2% P2O5 cut-off grade, currently stand at:

Two questions are addressed by the current scoping study on the lac à Paul deposit: 
 
1) Does the lac à Paul deposit have a realistic chance of becoming an economically viable 
operation?  
2) Is it worth making the necessary investment to bring the project into pre-feasibility? The 
next investment to be made by d'Arianne or an eventual partner will likely exceed $10M to 
carry out:  
 

1. definition drilling to improve the resource to measured and indicated categories; 
2. an extensive market study; 
3. metallurgical bench- scale testing and pilot plan testing ; 
4. prefeasibility and engineering studies. 

 
As many other industrial minerals, phosphate is a 
commodity characterized by a controlled market, and a 
transportation cost which may surpass the value of the 
commodity itself. However, phosphate is the fourth largest 
traded mineral commodity terms of value, is produced by 
numerous players and various countries, and has a wide-
spread and fragmented end-market. In such a context, the 
cost of production for d'Arianne's apatite should be 

considered in the global transportation framework, and compared to market prices, 
including transportation costs to the target consumers. 
 
World phosphate production in 2008 was 173.2 million tons. The bulk of this was from 
sedimentary phosphorite deposits either as direct shipping ore ("DSO") or with requiring 
little beneficiation. The main producing countries are China (61.8 Mt), Morocco and other 
North African countries (44.0 Mt) and North America (30.9 Mt). The consumption of 
phosphatic rock mirrors the production. Less than 10% of the phosphates are traded 
internationally. Base reserves of phosphatic rock, available for mining at less than US$40

transportation cost which may 

surpass the value of the

per ton, is currently established at 32 billion tons: 48% located in Morocco. Therefore, the 
market is not dependent on commodity restriction. Phosphate production is constrained by 
either mining capacity or market. Future price for 72% BPL phosphate rocks were 
forecasted as hovering at US$90-100 per ton, FOB Morocco. A structural change in the 
industry has been invoked to explain the base price jump from US$/50 t that prevailed until 
2006. 
 
North America produced about 31.3 Mt of phosphatic rock in 2008 out of 14 mines, with a 
slight imbalance with its domestic consumption. The 2.8 Mt deficit of production cannot be 
compensated by production increase, and is currently compensated through import from 
North-Africa. The bulk of the production and consumption is concentrated in Florida, with 
lesser amount lower in Idaho and even lesser in Ontario. Mine closures are expected in 
Florida due to exhaustion of the best deposits and environmental limitations. So production 
is forecast to drop by 6 Mt/year by 2017, increasing the import deficit. Phosphoric acid 
plants, the main phosphate rock consumers, are located near to mines in Florida and 
Idaho and far from mines in South Carolina and Red rivers, Canada. 
 
Less than 12% of the world phosphate production is in the 
form of apatite concentrates from igneous origin, such as 
the d'Arianne project. Apatite concentrates are more costly 
to produce than quasi-DSO phosphorite because they 
require comminution and beneficiation. However, apatite 
concentrates are richer (80-87% BPL), thus reducing 
transportation costs proportionally. Higher purity also 
implies lower processing cost for phosphoric acid production and a lower level of 
deleterious contaminants such as uranium and cadmium. Apatite concentrates are 
produced mainly in Russia (13.9 Mt/Y) and Brazil (6.46 Mt/y), dedicated to domestic or 
European markets. Typically, Russian concentrates command a 20% higher price than 
Moroccan phosphate rock on the European market. 
 

The d'Arianne project targets an apatite concentrate 
production of 2 million tons per year. The cost of 
production is estimated at about $72 per ton (US$68/ton) 
which is in the upper quartile of world phosphate rock 
producers, but comparable to other apatite producers. 
Capital expenditures are estimated to $324M, or $15.30 
per ton of apatite. 
 

Less than 12% of the world 

phosphate production is in 

the form of apatite 

concentrates from igneous 

origin, such as the d'Arianne 

project. 

The d'Arianne project targets 

an apatite concentrate 

production of 2 million tons 

per year. The cost of 

production is estimated at 

about $72 per ton 

(US$65/ton).

D'Arianne foresees a selling price of C$120 per ton. Realistically, d'Arianne can remain 
competitive in two distinct markets. First, the conterminous North American market, where 
it benefits from lower transportation costs. Moroccan or other seaborne phosphates are 
imported at the estimated cost of C$140 per ton, once FOB in a North American railcar. 
Superior quality, such as higher PBL and fewer contaminants, at a similar price makes the 
d'Arianne concentrate attractive to any North American phosphoric acid plan requiring rail 
transportation. 
 
Second is the European market, where the Belgian phosphoric acid plans are provided 
mainly with Russian apatite concentrate. Russian apatite, produced mainly in the Kola 
Peninsula, is currently delivered at C$182 per ton, FOB in northern Europe. D'Arianne 
apatite can be expected at C$160 per ton, delivered. 
 
Clean apatite concentrates have numerous advantages in regard to transformation into 
phosphoric acid. One of them is the lower abundance of deleterious elements, such as 
cadmium and uranium. Most developed countries have stringent regulations in place to 
limit deleterious contaminants in fertilizer. However, the applications of these regulations 
are in most cases pending because of a lack of clean fertilizer sources. The enactment of 
such regulations will favour strongly any phosphate derived from apatite concentrate, thus 
favouring the d'Arianne project. 
 
Using a selling price of $118 per ton, and 2 Mt per year, the project is profitable: 
 

• IRR: 20.80% 
• DNPV: $439M 

 
The financial model indicates that the project is sensitive to tonnage, to grade or to 
recovery, but it shows some robustness to selling price, operating costs and capital 
investment. The project is near insensitive to inflation rate and currency fluctuation. 
 
Phosphoric acid production by d'Arianne has not yet been evaluated, but shall be 
considered as a realistic future scenario.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

Along with apatite production, d'Arianne will be in a position 
to produce about 1 million tons of ilmenite concentrate per 
year. This ilmenite can be produced at a very low cost as a 
co-product. It may represent a 20-40% increase in 
revenues. These revenues were not included in the 
economic model. However, this ilmenite is not suitable for 

intensive fusion such as the RTIT (Sorel, Québec) process because it would require 
pelletization. Although the titanium grade reaches 45% TiO2, the concentrate is not 
suitable for direct feed to the chlorine route for titanium dioxide production. Therefore, 
ilmenite production as a co-product has not been considered in the current scenario, but 
can be re-evaluated in future. Other potential by-products, such as magnetite, vanadium, 
copper, cobalt and nickel as well as gypsum were not considered. 
 
Based on the previous observations, the author is confident that the Lac à Paul Project 
has a realistic chance of being economically viable. Therefore, it is sounded that d'Arianne 
proceed with a prefeasibility study and continues its effort to improve its mineral resources, 
to commission a detailed market study, and to pursue a potential well-established partner 
or a take-off agreement. 
 
The d'Arianne project represents about 1% of the world phosphate rock production, 6.5% 
of the North American production, or 10% of the world apatite production. With such a 
scale, d'Arianne shall not be considered as a threat to existing producers, but still attractive 
enough to them. 
 
 
 

Ilmenite production as a co‐

product has not been 

considered in the current 

scenario, but can be re‐

evaluated in future.

ITEM 4: INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF 
REFERENCE 
4.1 Introduction 

 
This study intends to provide an update on the resources 
estimate and preliminary economic assessment of the Lac à 
Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project commonly referred to as a 
"scoping study". Other than disclosing resources, the role of 
such a study is to provide d'Arianne with decisional insights 
and general guidance in the development of the project as 

well as providing the justification for the multimillion dollars investment needed to complete 
a pre-feasibility study on the project. 
 
Interest in the project was generated by the 2007-2008 surges in phosphate prices on the 
international market. This price soared from US$50 to US$450 per ton. However, the 
remote location and low grade of the project was perceived as a hindrance; a careful 
examination of the pros and cons must be carried out prior to justifying the important 
investment needed to fund subsequent studies. 
 
4.2 Mandate 
 
The author was retained by Les Ressources d'Arianne inc. (DAN) to evaluate the 
likelihood of viability of the Lac à Paul Project in the form of a preliminary economical 
assessment ("scoping study") as part of an independent Technical Report compliant with 
National Instrument 43-101-F1. The report includes a first disclosure of indicated 
resources, as estimated by SGS Canada Inc. (previously known as Systèmes Géostat 
International inc.), who share the responsibility for item 19 of the current report. The report 
also updates the economic assessment in regard of these new resource estimates and to 
situate the project in the market context for this specific commodity as a requirement for 
L'Autorité des marchés financiers du Québec (AMF) and to make an independent review 
of all geological and technical data available.  
 
The present assessment report draws largely on various internal d'Arianne reports, 
including a predecessor NI-43-101 report and a recent mineral resources estimate 
prepared by C. Duplessis and R. de l'Étoile of SGS Canada Inc. The author also made use 
of published assessment reports available from the ministère des Ressources naturelles et 

The current study aims to 

provide d'Arianne with 

decisional insights and 

general guidance in the 

development of their project.

ITEM 5: DISCLAIMER  
5.1 Authorship 
 
The current report has been written by the main author, Mr. Réjean Girard, P. Geo., who is 
responsible of its content. Item 19, describing the resource estimates, has been written by 
Mr. R. de l'Étoile, who takes responsibility for this section only. 
 
The document represents an opinion based on professional judgement and reasonable care. 
The conclusions are consistent with the level of details included in this study and based on 
the information available at the time of writing. 
 
This document includes economic statements and some element of mine design. These 
elements must be taken with care, the author not being an economist or a mining engineer. 
These statements, part of a preliminary assessment, must be taken as merely indicative and 
shall be considered as affected by a large margin of error, although considered sufficiently 
reliable for a scoping study. The author endorses the professional liabilities of his assertions 
only within these aforementioned limits. These assertions were provided only with the intent 
to do a preliminary test of the economic likelihood of the project, to provide d'Arianne with a 
general strategy in developing the project and as a prerequisite to justifying the funding 
needed to complete a prefeasibility study. 

 
5.2 Independence 
 
Both authors and their respective firms shall be considered as independent from Les 
Ressources d'Arianne according to all criteria cited in NI-43-101. Neither author nor the firm 
he represents holds a financial interest in the property or neighbouring properties, nor do 
they hold any securities or other incentives in Les Ressources d'Arianne. Mandates from 
d'Arianne represent less than 20% of income of either author and of the firm he represents. 
 
The Fonds minier du Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean was initially encouraged by the main author to 
promote the Chute-des-Passes area to local prospectors from 1992 to 1994. Later, and 
based on their own findings, the Fonds minier du Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean acquired the first 
claims without any involvement of the author. Les Ressources d'Arianne subsequently 
acquired both properties and a participation in the FMSLSJ properties without involvement of 
the author.

ITEM 6: PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
6.1 Property description 
 

The Lac à Paul Project is composed of a single large 
property, irregular in shape, for a total of 376 map 
designated mineral titles, covering 20 893.1 hectares 
(209 km2) of land. A small property of 3 titles, adjacent to 
the east, is also owned by d'Arianne.  
 

 
The property enclosed an unstaked area of approximately 14.3 km2. No attempt was made 
by d'Arianne to acquire this claim its location not being considered strategic. A table on 
claims data is presented in appendix 1. Les Ressources d'Arianne is registered as 100% 
owner of these mineral claims. 
 
6.2 Mineral rights 
 
Map designated cells, which define mineral titles according to the Québec mining law, are 
pre-established parcels of land, half a minute of arc by half a minute of arc on the NAD-83 
projection, the limits of which are predefined by their longitude and latitude. These titles 
are almost irrevocable by the government, and unchallengeable by a third party. Their 
limits being defined by law, they do not need land surveying to be officialised.  
 

The map designated mineral titles confers exclusive 
rights to the owner to carry out mineral exploration, and 
to acquire the mining lease in the eventuality of 
exploitation. However, mineral rights do not include 
surface rights, nor does it include rights over resources 
other than mineral, such as forestry, surface and 
groundwater, cynegetic, halieutic, or hydroelectric. 

However such surface rights are included within the mining lease if the project is located 
on Crown land. 
 

The Lac à Paul Project is 

composed of 376 map 

designated mineral titles, 

covering 20 893.1 hectares 

(209 km2) of land. 

The map designated mineral 

titles confers exclusive rights to 

the owner to carry out mineral 

exploration, and to acquire the 

mining lease in the eventuality 

of exploitation.

6.3 Expirations, rights and credits 
 
Claims have to be renewed every two years. Renewal date is dictated by the anniversary 
dates of individual claims. The next renewal on this property is indicated as July 10, 2010. 
A renewal fee of $52 per claim is requested, for a total cost of $19 552 every two years. 
Assessment work to the amount of $1200 per claim per renewal, or $1800 for claims after 
their third renewal, are needed to be credited to the claim at the time of their individual 
renewal. A total of $937 998.65 is currently available in credit. The need for the next 
renewal period is $462 000. These credits do not include the 2009 exploration and 
resources definition drilling expenditures. Claims are considered secure with respect to 
available credit for at least next two renewals. 
 
6.4 Location 
 
The property is located about 190 km north of Lac-St-Jean, Québec. The nearest cities are 
Dolbeau-Mistassini, Alma and Saguenay. The nearest 
landmark is Chutes-des-Passes, a hydroelectric 
infrastructure belonging to Rio Tinto-Alcan. The property is 
bounded by longitudes 70o35'00" N and 70o52'00" N and 
latitudes 49o43'00" N and 49o55'00" N (UTM coordinates:

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

Three blocks of claims were originally acquired from the 
Fonds minier du Saguenay−Lac-St-Jean through an option 
to acquire a participation by d'Arianne in 19991. Most of the 
terms of this contract are currently obsolete The FMSLSJ is 
currently diluted, and entitled to a 1.5% NSR, which can be 

bought for 1.5 million dollars. The first block encompasses 10 cells over the zone 1 
occurrence, while the second block encompasses 2 cells over the zone 2 occurrence. The 
third block, over zone 3, is currently obsolete. A two kilometre wide area of influence2 
surrounds these claim blocks, to which is attached a 0.5% NSR, which can be bought for 
$500 000. The FMSLSJ itself is bound to an agreement with the four prospectors who 
discovered the initial occurrences. Although the FMSLSJ obligations are included within 
the d'Arianne obligations, such obligation will survive until an eventual dissolution of the 
FMSLSJ. D'Arianne's obligations would then be transferable to the initial prospectors. 
 
The initial claims acquired by FMSLSJ were under the previous Québec mining regime. 
They were physically staked in the field. These claims were converted into map designated 
cells in 2001, and are now conferred with the same irrevocability with respect to eventual 
staking errors. 
 
Two other claim blocks were acquired 100% 
from Mr. James L. Dierzen and Mr. Pierre 
Morissette on August 28, 2008, encompassing 
2 cells (CDC 2129818 and CDC 2129819) over 
the Paul occurrence and 2 cells (CDC 2121340 
and CDC 2121341) over the Manouane 
occurrence. A 1.5% NSR was payable 
collectively to the vendors or could be bought back for $1 000 000. Part (0.5%) of  

                                                 
1 Mr. Bernard Lapointe, actual CEO of Ressources d'Arianne was the former 
manager of the Fonds minier du Saguenay−Lac-St-Jean, until April 1998. To the 
author's knowledge, the present apatite occurrences were discovered after the 
resignation of Mr. Lapointe from the FMSLSJ and no conflict of interest is 
interpreted. 
2 An ambiguity remain with respect to area of influence, if its perimeter is defined 
according to the original claim outline, or if it is defined according the actual claim 
outline. 

Three blocks of claims were 

originally acquired from the 

Fonds minier du 

Saguenay−Lac‐St‐Jean. 

Two other claim blocks were acquired 

100% from Mr James L. Dierzen and Mr 

Pierre Morissette on August 28, 2008, 

encompassing 2 cells over the Paul 

occurrence and 2 cells over the 

Manouane occurrence.

Mr. Morissette's NSR was bought back by d'Arianne on October 15, 2009, which leaves a 
total of 1% NSR on these claims1. No area of influence or grubstake was indicated. There 
is no interference or cumulative effect between the FMSLSJ and Morissette/Dierzen deals. 
 
6.6 Administrative divisions 
 
The property is located on Crown land ("Territoires non organisés"), within the Fjord du 
Saguenay regional municipality ("MRC"), Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean administrative division 
("02"). 
 
6.7 Neighbouring properties 
 
A group of claims (physically staked in the field, but with its location made official in the 
government registry, restriction no17760) is near to d'Arianne to the east. These claims, 
owned by Les Mines d'or Virginia inc. cover a nickel-copper sulphide occurrence, which 
project is not considered as a competitor to the d'Arianne project. 
 
Two groups of two cells, registered by Wayne Holmstead, are adjacent to the south-west 
of d'Arianne. 
 
Three groups of claims were designated recently to the south of d'Arianne by René 
Rousseau. 
 
6.8 Restrictions to mineral exploration 
 
Restriction 6577: A small exclusion to mineral exploration is present just north of the lac à 
Paul occurrence along the Manouane River. It has been subtracted for the Betsiamites 
hydro-electric project. This infrastructure will need to be taken into consideration by 
d'Arianne during project planning. 
 
The Manouane River delivers a hydroelectric potential in excess of 225 Kw. Even though 
limitations to mineral exploration and exploitation are present, these are not indicated on 
the MRNF claim map. 
 

                                                 
1 There is no indication on the contract if the buy-back payment has been reduced 
proportionally after selling a part of the NSR.

Restrictions 6573, 6574, 6575 and 6576: A set of exclusions to mineral exploration are 
present 5 km to the north-east. These are related to the construction of the Betsiamites 
hydro-electric complex and are not considered as a hindrance to the d'Arianne project. 
 
Restriction 6572: This restriction to mineral exploration is linked to the Betsiamites 
reservoir, which is expected to be inundated. Mineral exploration is allowed within this 
restriction under certain conditions and permission from Hydro-Québec is needed. This 
restriction is not considered a hindrance to d'Arianne. 
 
Restriction 20551: A small area is restricted to mineral exploration is related to this site 
along the Manouane River, west of d'Arianne. This site is designated as Experimental 
forest. Exploration is allowed under certain conditions. 
 
Restriction 6578: A small exclusion to mineral exploration is present 12 km to the west of 
the lac à Paul occurrence, associated with the construction of the Betsiamites hydro-
electric complex. This restriction is not considered as a hindrance to the d'Arianne project. 
 
Restriction 21925: Mineral exploration is temporarily excluded within this restriction. A 
decision depends on the outcome of the current evaluation whether to designate the land 
as protected. As the proposed route to haul the apatite concentrate traverses this area, a 
designation as protected may imply the construction of a detour route1. 
 
6.9 Surface rights 
 
A few parcels of land were loaned by the ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la 
Faune du Québec to individuals in order to built hunting/fishing cabins. An inventory of 
these cabins has not been made by d'Arianne. 
 
The Pourvoirie du Lac à-Paul, an outfitting camp, owns the exclusive fishing and hunting 
rights over an area which encompasses the northern part of d'Arianne property, including 
the Paul occurrence. No infrastructures belonging to this outfitter is located within the 
property. It is considered that the presence of this outfitter shall not be a hindrance to 
d'Arianne exploration work, assuming that d'Arianne does not conduct any work during 
moose hunting season. However, in the event of a mining development on the Paul 
occurrence, interference with the outfitter's activities is expected.

6.10 Native rights 
 

The lac à Paul property is located within the ancestral 
territories (Nistassinan) belonging to the Montagnais 
community of Mashteuiatsh (Pointe Bleue, Lac-St-Jean). 
The area is overlapped by the ancestral territories of 
Betsiamites 1Montagnais community. Land claims from the 
Montagnais nation were partly resolved by the "Entente 
commune" signed with the Québec government. D'Arianne 
must request authorization from community councils prior to 

proceeding with exploration work or logging, authorization whichis embedded within the 
government permit. 
 
6.11 Trap lines 
 
There are likely to be ancestral trap lines within the project area, although d'Arianne has 
not been able to obtain a tallyman's name. Tallymen shall be consulted prior to exploration 
or logging activities. 
 
6.12 Environmental liabilities 
 
No environmental liabilities are known within or attached to the property. Drilling sites were 
visited by the author and appear to comply with all environmental good practices. 
Environmental damage left by previous property owners are limited. The area underwent 
intensive logging in the last decades. No abandoned 
camp sites, waste dumps, fuel spills, wetland disruption or 
other environmental problems were noted. Remabec 
logging camp, which was previously located within the 
property, has been rehabilitated according to regulations. 
Virginia and Soquem core racks are currently abandoned on this site. 

                                                 
1 A very different attitude with respect to economic development is noted between 
these two communities. While the Mashteuiatsh communities well integrated and 
collaborative with respect to economical development, the Betsiamites community is 
much more reluctant and vindictive. The author has not been able to solve which of 
the two communities has precedence. 

The lac à Paul property is 

located within the ancestral 

territories (Nistassinan) 

belonging to the Montagnais 

community of Mashteuiatsh 

(Pointe Bleue, Lac St‐Jean). 

No environmental liabilities

ITEM 7: ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
7.1 Topography 
 
Topography around lac à Paul is typical of the Laurentian Plateau with rolling hills and 
narrow valleys. The only significant water body is lac à Paul, standing at an altitude of 
about 400 metres above sea level, while the highest ridge stands at 550 metres. The area 
is drained by small streams into the Manouane or Castor-qui-Cale rivers, themselves 
tributaries of the Péribonka River which flows toward lac St-Jean. The Manouane River, 
adjacent to the north and flowing westward into the Péribonka, is currently diverted by 
Hydro-Québec in order to flow eastward into the Pipmuacan Reservoir. Despite the 
proximity of some infrastructure, these installations will not be a hindrance to d'Arianne's 
project. 
 
7.2 Flora and fauna 
 
The property is covered by commercial taiga forest dominated by black spruce, although a 
major part has been harvested in the last two decades. The vegetation is now typically a 
second growth and regenerating taiga forest. It includes large areas with mixed birch, poplar, 
fir, black spruce and pines. Wildlife consists of occasional black bears, moose, beavers, etc. 
Part of the property is currently covered by an outfitter with exclusive fishing and game 
hunting rights. 

 
7.3. Access and population 
 
No community is present in the vicinity of the project. A small settlement exists at Chute-
des-Passes, about 30 km from the property, where a logging camp, some conveniences 
and a few cabins are present. Some services are also available at Alcan's Chutes-des-
Passes and Hydro-Québec's Péribonka hydro-electric complexes, at various logging 
camps as well as at outfitters and floatplane bases. 
 

The area is easily accessible by the Chutes-des-Passes 
road, a public gravel road leading from the village of St-
Ludger de Milot, north of Lac-St-Jean, to Alcan's 
hydroelectric complex and from there, by the Manouane

gravel road. This road is maintained year round, the cost being shared by Alcan, Hydro-
Québec and various logging companies. A dense network of maintained and unmaintained 
logging roads also leads from the project to Dolbeau-Mistassini, Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire 
(Péribonka road) or Falardeau (Onatcheway road). A new network is currently being 
developed to the north to access the Manouane and Bersismis hydroelectric 
developments, connecting with logging roads to Labrieville and Forestville on the north 
shore of St-Lawrence River. From the Manouane road, a dense network of unmaintained 
logging roads provides access to most of the property. 
 
7.4 Infrastructure 
 
No infrastructure other than logging roads is present within the property. Power lines can 
be tapped at Chutes-des-Passes (161 kv) 30 km from the project. Transportation issue is 
reviewed in detail in item 20.

ITEM 8: HISTORY 
8.1 The pre-1994 period 
 
Mineral exploration interest in the Chutes-des-Passes 
area was initiated by Mr. Lionel Lefebvre, a local 
prospector, in the 1970's. Some exploration activity for 
copper and nickel mineralization was recorded by Imperial 
Oil (GM-27460 and 27031) and N.Q.N. Mines (GM-27033, 
27034, 28000, 26105, 26106). Little activity was recorded 
in the 1980's, after the discovery of the lac du Poisson Blanc deposit. 
 
Mineral exploration in the lac à Paul area was initiated by the Fonds minier du Saguenay-
Lac-St-Jean in 1994 (Barrette, 1994; GM-57004, GM-57006). In the following years, 
prospector's training camps were set-up in the area (GM 57007, 58152), which lead to the 
discovery of copper and nickel occurrences (GM-57007), high purity quartz veins (GM 
53478, 52422), and subsequently to apatite and ilmenite. 
 
8.2 Virginia and Soquem copper-nickel exploration  
 

Starting in 1995, Virginia Gold Mines initiated a 
reconnaissance program for nickel-copper in the area, and 
subsequently acquired an option for the Fonds minier 
claims. Within the same period, SOQUEM initiated a similar 

program in the same area, which they promptly merged with Virginia into a single joint-
venture. Large properties from this project are still active in the area, notably adjacent and 
east of d'Arianne. Abundant assessment literature is on file:

Part of the Virginia-Soquem exploration effort included the 
d'Arianne properties. Their discovery of ilmenite and apatite 
in the Manouane and Paul zones was accidental, in the 
course of evaluating magnetic and electromagnetic 
anomalies for their copper-nickel potential. Ground and 

heliborne geophysics as well as two drill holes in both occurrences are now available to 
d'Arianne. 
 
8.3 The FMSLS-d'Arianne period  
 
In 1998, the Québec Department of Energy and Resources (QDER, actually MRNF), 
carried out geological mapping of the 22E map-sheet (Hébert, 1998; Hébert et al, 2009; 
Hébert et Beaumier, 2000). The first apatite discovery was made in the area in the course 
of this mapping that was undertaken in collaboration with a prospector training camp 
organized by the FMSLSJ (Tremblay, 1998). Interest in this commodity was triggered by 
the discovery of the Sept-Îles deposits two years before by the QDER (Cimon, 1996) and 
by the fast development of the project by SOQUEM. The FMSLSJ and its prospectors 
staked their discoveries (zones no1 to no3), which claims were granted for option to 
Ressources d'Arianne. Some of these initial claims are still active. D'Arianne, in 
collaboration with the FMSLSJ, carried out a limited amount of work until 2002.

Due to a lack of interest in the capital market, d'Arianne abandoned the exploration for 
apatite and ilmenite in 2002, and allowed most claims to lapse. 
 
8.4 Recent d'Arianne involvement  
 
D'Arianne's interest in the project resumed in 2008, 
stimulated by a surge in phosphate price. D'Arianne re-
staked Virginia's Manouane and lac à Paul occurrence 
and initiated prospecting and drilling work. D'Arianne's 
work consisted of: 
 

• Summer 2008: Prospecting and surface sampling. 
• Fall 2008: Ground magnetometer survey over zone no2. 
• Fall 2008: 22 drill holes in Paul and zone no2 occurrences. 
• Winter 2009: 13 drill holes in Manouane occurrence. 
• Spring 2009: Resource estimates by SGS Canada Inc. 
• Spring 2009: Apatite beneficiation test, SGS-Lakefield. 
• Summer 2009: Prospecting and surface sampling. 
• Fall 2009: 11 Drill holes for exploration purposes, completed September 13. 
• Late fall 2009: 18 drills holes in Paul zone. 

 
None of these campaigns is currently filed as assessment at MRNF.

ITEM 9: GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
9.1 Regional geology 
 
The Grenville Province, largely Proterozoic, occupies a vast territory in north-eastern North 
America. It is the result of a collisional orogen with associated plutonism in crustal rocks. 
The rocks have been polydeformed with high grade amphibolite to granulite facies 
metamorphism. The property is located in the central part of the Grenville geological 
province (figure 1, item 26). 
 
Many magmatic events took place within the central 
Grenville Province in Québec from 1510 to 985 MY before 
today (Hébert et al., 2003) Four generated anorthositic 
suites. The about 1330 MY old labradorite-type De La 
Blache Plutonic Suite is the oldest one intruding the 
basement assemblage in the central Grenville. It was 
followed by the huge 1160-1140 MY multi-phase 
labradorite-type Lac Saint-Jean Anorthosite Suite (about 20 000 km2), which hosts the 
current project. Later, the andesine-type 1080-1060 MY Saint-Urbain Anorthosite Suite 
was emplaced. The fourth anorthosite event is represented by the 1010-1008 MY 
andesine-type Labrieville Anorthosite Suite (Piché, 1981). 
 
Oxide mineralization occurs within all Grenville anorthosite suites. Magnetite and ilmenite 
are found in the labradorite-type, while hemo-ilmenite and magnetite are associated with 

the andesine-type. Apatite is reported associated with most 
magnetite-ilmenite occurrences, although it may have 
remained unnoticed in older reports. For example, the St-
Urbain deposits although well documented, do not have 
any mention of apatite even when present1. No systematic 
overview of Grenvillian apatite occurrences is available in 
literature.

9.2 Local geology 
 
Grenvillian geology of the Lac St-Jean area was first described by Laurin and Sharma 
(1968) at the scale of 1: 250 000 and compiled by Avramtchem and Piché (1981). 
Information given on this map is limited. It indicates the lac à Paul area as included in an 
anorthosite lobe, flanked by some gabbros, and hosted in quartzofeldspahtic grey gneiss 
and granites. 
 
The area was mapped in greater detail by Hébert (Hébert and Baumier, 2000; RG-99-05), 
at a scale of 1: 50000.  
 
9.3 Property geology 
 

Property geology map is taken from Hébert and Beaumier 
(2000). It is still the most accurate available (figure 3, 
item 26). According to this map, the vast majority of the 
property is underlain by norite and leuconorite, with some 

pyroxenite and gabbronorite. Three north-north-east trending faults are reported. No 
geological mapping was undertaken by d'Arianne. In detail, lithofacies are variegated on a 
small scale, and more diverse than what is indicated on Hébert and Beaumier's map.

property is underlain by

ITEM 10: DEPOSIT TYPES 
10.1 General models 
 
Two types of apatite-ilmenite occurrences are present within the Lac à Paul Project. Both 
are magmatic in origin and form specific facies of the Lac-St-Jean Anorthositic complex. 
Although these kinds of deposits are known to be associated with various anorthosite 
complexes in the world, none is currently mined for its phosphate content. However, 
similar deposits with dominant ilmenite are currently mined at lac Tio (Rio Tinto Iron 
Titanium, Havre St-Pierre, Québec) and Tellnes (Norsk Hydro, Norway). Numerous 
occurrences are currently under evaluation in Québec for their iron and titanium content. 
 
10.2 Nelsonite type 
 

Manouane and Paul zones are made of layered 
medium-grain olivine nelsonite. These are layered 
sequences made of various proportions of ilmenite, 
magnetite, apatite and olivine rocks. Nelsonites, first 
described from Nelson County in Virginia, are usually 
defined as ilmenite-apatite±rutile, although biotite, 
magnetite, olivine and pyroxene may be present. Most 

known occurrences are described from gabbroic and anorthositic intrusions, although 
some are reported from granites and carbonatites. Genesis of anorthosite-related nelsonite 
is still debated, but usually accepted as a liquid segregation from a titanium-iron-
phosphorus saturated mafic-anorthositic silicate magma. Segregation is considered to be 
triggered by silica polymerization caused by wall-rock contamination. This explains why 
such deposits are typically found in the proximity of anorthosite-gneiss contacts. A simple 
differentiation-accumulation process cannot be invoked to generate these unusual rocks. 
 
Most nelsonite occurrences described in literature are ilmenite dominated, and occur either 
as pods or layered sequences. Examples are known in the Sept-Îles Complex, Lac De La 
Blache Anorthosite, St-Urbain Anorthosite, and in various locations within the Lac-St-Jean 
Anorthosite, as well as in the Archean Lac Doré and Bell River complexes. 
 
 
 
 
 

Manouane and Paul zones are 

made of layered medium‐grain 

olivine nelsonite, a rock made of 

various proportions of ilmenite, 

magnetite, apatite and olivine.

10.3 Gabbroic type 
 

The zone 1 to zone 3 occurrences, which initially attracted 
d'Arianne attention, are apatite-ilmenite bearing coarse-
grained gabbros. Apatite and ilmenite are disseminated in 
gabbroic rocks which are coarse grained, granular-
idiomorphic and with millimetric sized grains. Their 
abundance is lower than fornelsonite, and suggests that 
titanium and phosphorus did not reach saturation in the 

magma. They form large volumes extending for km. Outcrops in the lac à Paul area are 
heavily weathered, with the rock crumbling into gravel due to frost dislocation along 
straight grain boundaries. 
 
10.4 Carbonatite type 
 
Most apatite currently mined in the world (Ontario, Kola 
Peninsula, Brazil) is from carbonatite complexes. It should 
be noted that lac à Paul deposits is not carbonatite hosted. 
Carbonatite hosted deposits have higher apatite grades, 
typically 30-70%. However, carbonatite deposits present 
difficulties, such as lower apatite recovery, carbonate contamination of the concentrate, 
higher harmful contaminants such as uranium and fluorine, amongst others. 

The zone 1 to zone 3 

occurrences, which initially 

attracted d'Arianne 

attention, are apatite‐

ilmenite bearing coarse‐

grained gabbros. 

Most apatite currently mined 

in the world is from 

carbonatite complexes.

ITEM 11: MINERALIZATION 
11.1 General considerations 
 
Six mineralized zones are reported within d'Arianne's project. Zones no1, no2, no3 and no4 
are low-grade apatite-ilmenite bearing gabbros discovered by the FMSLSJ, and will be 
discussed only briefly. Only zone no2 has been explored significantly. The two other zones, 
Manouane and Paul, are nelsonites and show the most promise. 
 
11.2 Paul zone 

 
Paul zone is d'Arianne's prime target (figure 4, item 26). It 
is located in the northern part of the property; on claims 
no2129818, no2129818 and no2167470. The zone occupies 

a small hillcrest adjacent to the north of lac à Paul (UTMX: 374000; UTMY: 5529000). It is 
easily accessible via various logging trails connecting to the road leading to Manouane 
River. Thin, less than 10 metres of overburden is reported. 
 
The rocks consist of an olivine nelsonite, composed of similar proportions of apatite, 
ilmenite, magnetite and olivine, plus accessory pyroxene, feldspar and biotite1. Depending 
on mineral proportions, this layered rock can vary between a genuine nelsonite, a troctolitic 
nelsonite, a troctolite (olivine-plagioclase rock), a pyroxenite, a gabbroic anorthosite, etc. 
These facies are intricate or layered in disorder. This zone is embedded in apatite-free 
gabbroic to anorthositic host rock. The difference between the various facies is subtle, and 
correlation between drill holes remains tricky. 
 
The Paul zone is known to extend at least 
1000 metres, aligned east-south-east. 
Ovoid in shape, its width is not constant, 
between 150 and 300 metres. The zone is 
open at depth and true thickness has not 
been accurately established. The zone is 
open to the east and to the west, although 
the magnetic survey indicates its pinch. The magnetic survey also indicates a complex 
internal structure, with likely folding and stacking. Bedding attitude is not well constrained 

                                                 
1 Petrography and ore petrography is currently carried out and quick validation of 
mineralogy was made by the author.

due to the diffuse lithological contacts nor has any effort been made in this regard. The 
structure has been interpreted as twisted by SGS Canada Inc. (Duplessis, 2009): Dipping 
north at the east end, sub-vertical at its center and dipping south at the west end. The 
geometry of the zone has still to be properly addressed in future work. However, the lack 
of complete understanding is not considered a severe hindrance considering the bulk 
open-pit mining approach. 
 
11.3 Manouane zone 
 
The Manouane zone is located in flat terrain, 5.5 km east of lac à Paul, 2 km south of the 
bight on the Manouane River (UTMX: 381300, UTMN: 5527000). Access required the 
logging of a 3 km trail by Soquem in 1998. The zone is under a poorly drained muskeg, 
therefore not outcropping and hampering summer access to drill rigs. Thick, from 10 to 28 
metres of overburden is reported. 
 

Manouane zone (figure 5, item 26) is dominated by a 
magnetite-bearing nelsonite, similar to Paul zone. This 
nelsonite is interbedded with gabbros, anorthosite and 
tonalite layers. Again, no correlation was attempted 
between holes. The attitude of layering is uncertain. The 
zone is currently known to extend 800 metres, trend 
northeast-southwest and be open at both ends. It has an 

apparent width of about 200 metres, although this width is not well constrained. This 
current outline approximately mimics the aeromagnetic anomaly. The zone has been 
tested to a depth of almost 200 metres where it is still open at least at its west end. Depth 
is constrained down to 125 metres at the east end. 
 
11.4 Nicole zone 
 
The Nicole zone corresponds to a magnetic anomaly located between Paul and Manouane 
zones. Only limited surface sampling is available, no drilling having been done yet. 
 
11.5 Zone no1 
 
Little exploration has been done in zone no1, one of the areas initially discovered by 
FMSLSJ (figure 6, item 26). It is located 6 km south-east of lac à Paul, by UTMX 380600 
and UTMY 5521700. It consists of an apatite-bearing gabbro which makes friable outcrops 
along road cuts. Other than prospecting, two (2) short surface holes were drilled in 2000, 

The Manouane zone is 

currently known to extend 

800 metres, trend northeast‐

southwest and be open at 

both ends. It has an apparent

plus seven (7) in 2001 to a depth of 30 metres. The zone is open in all directions and at 
depth. A preliminary inferred resource estimate was calculated by d'Arianne at the time, 
not NI-43-101 compliant. 
 
11.6 Zone no2 
 
Zone no2 is the only zone acquired from the FMSLSJ upon which significant exploration 
effort was spent (figure 7, item 26). It is located about 10 km south-south-west of lac à 
Paul, in an area with rugged topography near the Castor-Qui-Cale River (UTMX: 366500, 
UTMY: 5516500). Scattered anorthosite outcrops were located in the area, with the usual 
crumbling weathering. The zone no2 occurrence is made up of apatite-ilmenite bearing 
homogeneous anorthositic gabbro, with minor variegated gabbro and anorthosite. 
Nelsonite and troctolite are reported as small pods.  
 
The zone is known to extend about 1200 metres, to trend northeast, to have a know width 
of up to 500 metres. It has been tested by drilling to a depth of about 200 metres. The rock 
is rather massive. Differences between facies are subtle, and the correlation between drill 
holes is difficult. The attitude of the layer is suspected to be sub-horizontal. The zone can 
be considered as open in every direction. The magnetic pattern over the zone is irregular 
and of little help in delineating mineralization. 
 
11.7 Zone no3 
 
Little exploration has been done in zone no3, one of the areas initially discovered by 
FMSLSJ. It is located in the southern part of the project, NTS 22E10, by UTMX377500 and 
UTMY 5509600. It consists of an apatite-bearing gabbro which makes friable outcrops 
along road cuts. Only surface prospecting has been carried out. 
 
11.8 Zone no4 
 
Little exploration has been done in zone no4, which was acquired in 2001 but it is not 
covered by the FMSLSJ agreement. It is located within a small isolated group of claims to 
the East, UTMX 389000, UTMY 5524950. It consists of an ilmenite-rich gabbro which 
makes friable outcrops along road cuts. Four short holes were drilled in 2001, which is the 
extent of the recorded exploration work. The zone is mainly titanium rich, one of the holes 
intersected 14.36% TiO2 over 24.47 metres.

ITEM 12: EXPLORATION 
12.1 Previous work 
 

Virginia gold mines and its partner Soquem carried out an 
intensive exploration effort in the lac à Paul area between 
1996 and 2004. These were mostly dedicated to various 
airborne electromagnetic anomalies in a search for 
copper-nickel magmatic sulphide mineralization. 
Exploration included conventional mapping and surface 
sampling, line cutting, ground geophysics including 

magnetometer and Max-Min HLEM surveys, and a total of 76 drill holes (figure 8, 
item 26). Thorough compilation of this work is outside the scope of the current mandate, 
and only the relevant data located within d'Arianne's property will be considered here. 
These are restricted to: 
 

• Airborne geophysics 
• Ground magnetometer and HLEM surveys 
• A few drill holes in Manouane and Paul zones, which will be reviewed in the 

next section 
 
12.2 Geophysics 
 
A series of airborne magnetic and frequency domain electromagnetic surveys with different 
orientations and spacing (GM-56149, 57184) were flown in 1997 on behalf of Virginia Gold 
Mines. These surveys were merged and reprocessed by M. Boivin (2009) on behalf of 
d'Arianne. They encompass a large area which does not coincide with actual d'Arianne 
property. The total magnetic field picture generated by Boivin is presented in figure 9 
(item 26), showing the locations of Paul, Nicole and Manouane zones. Narrow positive in-
phase response coincident with positive off-phase response is suggestive of a bedrock 
conductive zone according to St-Hilaire (2007). Such zones are prime exploration targets 
for copper-nickel mineralization, and were the focus of Virginia and Soquem's subsequent 
work. Inversely, a positive in-phase response devoid of negative off-phase response is 
suggestive of bedrock with high magnetic susceptibility, such as nelsonite. Drilling of such 
an anomaly led to the discovery of the Paul and Manouane zones. 
 
Ground magnetometer and Max-Min surveys were carried out over 12 grids in the area on 
behalf of Virginia/Soquem. Of these, only Paul and Manouane grids are located within 
d'Arianne property (Poirier et Granger, 1997, Manouane only). In summer 2009, d'Arianne 

Most of Virginia's effort were

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

contracted a ground magnetometer survey of the Paul and Nicole grids to Geosig Inc. 
(Simoneau, 2009). The Nicole grid partly encompasses Virginia's grid on Manouane. 
These surveys were levelled and merged by Boivin (2009) (figure 9, item 26). These were 
also integrated into the airborne survey, with the use of downward continuation and a 
pass-high filter on the latter. 
 
A ground magnetometer survey was also carried out on zone no2 grid by Services 
Exploration Inc. in fall 2008 and interpreted by G. Lambert (Lambert, 2008, in Tollari and 
Boulianne, 2009). This survey is noisy and of limited use (figure 10, item 26). 
 
12.3 Prospecting, mapping and surface sampling 
 
Numerous prospecting campaigns were carried out in the area from 1994 to 2002, either by 
the FMSLSJ, Virginia, Soquem, or d'Arianne, the results of which were never integrated into 
a comprehensive database by d'Arianne. Such compilation being outside the range of the 
current mandate, third party's campaigns will not be furhter discussed. 
 
The main prospecting campaign carried out by d'Arianne was in fall 2001 (Boulianne, 2002; 
GM-58767). This campaign focused on zones no1, no2 and no4. A total of 174 surface 
samples were collected. No geological map was produced. Results were as follow: 
 

• Zone no1: 37 samples, 4.74% P2O5 on average. 
• Zone no2: 45 samples, 4.12% P2O5 on average. 
• Zone no4: 92 samples, 0.91% P2O5 on average. 

 
D'Arianne conducted a brief prospecting and surface sampling program in summer 2008 
(Tollari and Boulianne, 2009). Based on the database provided by d'Arianne, the average 
grade of the 95 samples submitted for assaying returned above 2.98% P2O5 and 4.90% 
TiO2, with 25 samples above 4% P2O5. A second campaign was carried out in 2009 (report 
pending) under the supervision of C. Tremblay, P. Geo. These 365 samples returned an 
average of 2.99% P2O5 and 5.18% TiO2, with 104 samples above 4% P2O5. 

 
The France zone (UTMX 371900 and UTMY 5519600) was discovered during this 
prospecting. 
 
These campaigns were carried out by d'Arianne prospectors, with only limited supervision. 
Only limited rock and outcrop description is available. No geological map was created. 
Results are indicated in figure 11, item 26. No analytical quality control was implemented.

12.4 Validity of work 
 
The validity of the work carried out by FMSLSJ, Virginia and Soquem in the area cannot be 
reliably addressed, and seems to be of very uneven quality and relevance. A thorough 
compilation of all prospecting results is recommended. The author has no reason to question 
the quality of the geophysics, which appears to conform to industry standards. 
 
The work carried out on behalf of d'Arianne is of uneven quality. Magnetic surveys are of 
sufficient quality considering the large contrasts induced by nelsonite. Levelling of data by 
Boivin is adequate. The prospecting work carried out by d'Arianne would gain from being 
reviewed in detail. All apatite occurrences would deserve to be properly evaluated.  
 
12.5 Independence of contractors 
 
All fieldwork carried out on behalf of d'Arianne was done by d'Arianne technical staff under 
the supervision of Daniel Boulianne, P. Geo. These individuals cannot be considered as 
independent from d'Arianne, although the author has no reason to doubt their integrity.

ITEM 13: DRILLING 
13.1 Generalities 
 

A total of 143 holes have been drilled on the property or in 
its vicinity since 1996. Of these, 76 holes were drilled on 
behalf of Virginia Gold Mines or Soquem in a search for 
nickel-copper mineralization, the remaining on behalf of 

d'Arianne in a search for apatite-ilmenite mineralization. 
 
The rock is typically competent and recovery is excellent (>98%). Structural 
measurements, such as RQD and fracture description, were obtained only during the last 
campaign in late fall 2009. All d'Arianne core is currently stored, cross-piled on pallets, in 
d'Arianne facilities located on Chemin St-Martin, ville de La Baie1. Sample rejects and 
pulps were discarded, except for the last campaign, which are to be stored at the d'Arianne 
facility. SOQUEM-Virginia core is abandoned at former Remabec camp sites. Holes 
PAU-97-02 and MAN-91-07 were recovered by d'Arianne. 
 
13.2 Virginia-Soquem drilling 
 
Of the 76 holes drilled by Virginia and Soquem within their Chutes-des-Passes Project, 13 
are located within the d'Arianne project, and 6 were analyzed for their apatite and ilmenite 
content. Limited information is available about the drilling contractor, target selection, 
logging procedures, quality control, etc. These holes, extracted from MRNF's Sigeom 
information system, are shown in figure 3 (item 26). There is a short description for the 
ones located within d'Arianne property in table 1. Holes were located with the use of grid 
location and hand-held GPS. 
 

                                                 
1 Holes PAU-09-22 to PAU-09-24 are temporarily stored in IOS facilities, being 
currently the object of mineralogical studies. 

A total of 143 holes have 

been drilled on the property 

or in its vicinity since 1996.

• The first two holes drilled on behalf of d'Arianne in 2000 (Boudreault, 2000; GM-
58768), BQ in size, are located in zone no1, for a total of 51.56 metres. The 
purpose of these short holes was to measure the thickness of the apatite-bearing 
gabbroic layer. Drilling was contacted to Laboratoire S.L.3, while assaying was 
done at Chimitec-Intertek testing from Val-d'Or, using ICP-OES after metaborate 
fusion. No QCQA was implemented. Core description was under the author's 
supervision. Results are summarized in table 2. 
 

• A second drilling campaign, BQ in size, was performed in winter 2001 (Boulianne 
2001, GM-59767). The first 7 holes are located in zone no1, for a total of 187.1 
metres. Another 3 holes were located is zone no2, for a total of 80.19 metres. 
Drilling was contracted to Laboratoire S.L., under the supervision of Alexandre 
Boudreault from IOS. Analyses were contracted to Chimitec-Bondar Clegg from 
Val-d'Or, using ICP-OES after metaborate fusion. No QCQA protocol was

13.4 D'Arianne, recent drilling 
 

Since d'Arianne resumed its interest in the project, it 
carried out four significant drilling campaigns from fall 2008 
to fall 2009. All collars were located by d'Arianne using a 
non-referenced DGPS. Grids and definition drill collars 
were surveyed by a land surveyor using a referenced 

DGPS. Hole deviations were measured using a Flex-It instrument. Please note that this 
instrument is sensitive to the surrounding magnetic field, and may record erroneous values 
in the presence of magnetite. Geological knowledge is needed to discard such values. 
Casings were usually not left in the holes. 
 

• The first drilling campaign, NQ in size, from late October to late November 2008 
aimed to allow the calculation of inferred resources in Paul and no2 zones (Tollari, 
2009). It included 13 holes for 1860 metres in Paul zone, organized in 5 sections 
200-300 metres apart. Drilling in zone no2 included 9 holes for 924 metres, 
organized in 4 sections 200 metres apart. Plan view is provided in figures 4 and 6 
(item 26) and sections  (item 26). Logging protocols and core management were 
witnessed by C. Duplessis from SGS Canada Inc. and considered to conform to 
best industry practices. Results from this campaign are listed in table 3. 
 

• The second drilling campaign, NQ in size, carried out in January and February 
2009, aimed to delineate the Manouane zone and to allow the calculation of 
inferred resources. Drilling in this zone is restricted to winter due to marshy terrain. 
A total of 13 holes, for 1947 metres, were drilled along 4 sections 200 metres apart. 
Plan view is provided in figure 5 (item 26) and sections (item 26). The campaign, 
same as the first one, was planned and supervised by D. Boulianne, P. Geo, and 
executed by Christian Tremblay, P. Geo. Drilling was contracted to Forage Dami-
Or and assaying to ALS-Chemex, both from Val-d'Or. Assaying was by XRF on 
metaborate beads. Logging protocols and core management were witnessed by C. 
Duplessis from SGS Canada Inc. and appear to conform to best industry practices. 
Results from this campaign are listed in table 3. 
 

• The third drilling campaign, NQ in size, was carried out in summer 2009 and was 
dedicated to exploring for new zones. Target selections were based on 
interpretation of the airborne magnetometer survey, if possible coincident with 
muskegs. Program was planned by D. Boulianne, but execution and core 
description was left to R. Ouellet, P. Geo. Drilling was contracted to Forage Dami-
Or and assaying to ALS-Chemex, both from Val-d'Or. Assaying was by XRF on 
metaborate beads. Results from this campaign are listed in table 4, while drill hole 
locations are indicated in figure 3 (item 26). Logging protocols and core 
management were witnessed by the author and appear to conform to industry 
recommended practices. 

Since d'Arianne resumed its 

interest in the project, it 

carried out four significant 

drilling campaigns.

• A fourth drilling campaign, NQ in size, was recently 
completed (December, 2009), dedicated to 
improving drilling density in the Paul zone in order 
to allow the calculation of indicated mineral 
resources. A total of 18 holes, for 3593 metres 
were drilled. Program planning was by D. 
Boulianne and the author. Execution and core 
description was left to Pascal Simard, geologist in 
training. Drilling was contracted to Forage Dami-Or 
and assaying to ALS Chemex, both from Val-d'Or. 
Assaying is being done by XRF on metaborate 
beads. Drill hole locations are given in figure 4 (item 26) while profiles are included 
in sections  (item 26).

ITEM 14: SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Only limited information is available about historical sampling methods used by Virginia 
and Soquem. They are assumed to be compliant with then prevailing industry practices.  
 
Sampling of the 1999-2001 d'Arianne drill cores was done under the author's supervision 
at the IOS facilities. Core was hand split, bagged and shipped for assaying by road carrier. 
A total of 636 samples were sent for assay. Surface sampling during this period was not 
compiled by the author. 
 
Surface samples collected during the 2008-2009 prospecting campaign were collected 
directly from outcrops using a sledge and a hammer. Most of these are selected grab 
samples, a few being composites of a few chunks. A bias toward high grade samples is 
suspected. No channel or chip samples were reported. Typical sample weight is about 2 
kilograms. Considering the coarseness of these rocks, this is a minimum. 
 

Samples from the 2008-2009 drill campaign were taken at 
more or less regular intervals, typically 3 metres, regardless 
of the lithofacies. The first few holes were sampled at 1.5 
metre intervals. This protocol was changed to 3 metres 
following SGS Canada Inc. recommendations. The core 
was split with the use of a hydraulic splitter at d'Arianne's 
logging facility set-up at Chutes-des-Passes. A total of 1819 
samples were sent from Paul, Manouane and zone no2 

occurrences. Exploration drilling carried out in summer 2009 included 92 samples, 
collected using the same protocol. Fall 2009 definition drilling in Paul zone added 1175 
samples, for an overall total of 3086 samples. 

Samples from the 2008‐2009 

drill campaign were taken at 

more or less regular 

intervals, typically 1.5 or 

3 metres, regardless of the 

lithofacies.

ITEM 15: SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND 
SECURITY 
15.1 Analytical protocol  
 

Phosphorous and titanium rich rocks such as nelsonite are 
not materials routinely analyzed by commercial laboratories, 
and matrix effects may differ significantly from silicate rocks. 

Care and attention must be applied in analytical protocols. 
Apatite is not refractory to most digestion methods, but 
high phosphorous may cause difficulties in melting borate 
glass or precipitation in acid digestion. Titanium oxides 
are notorious for being refractory both in digestion and 
borate glass melting. Tight quality control is of concern.  
 

• Soquem analyzed their core samples by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using fused 
borate beads for major oxides plus elemental barium and strontium, and using 
press pellets for elemental zirconium and yttrium (Roy, 2000, GM-58232). 
 

• Results of d'Arianne's and FMSLSJ's surface sample analyses has not been 
compiled by the author. 
 

• Drill core samples from the 1999-2001 d'Arianne programs were assayed using 
induced coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) after digestion of 
a fused borate bead (Boulianne 2001, 2001b; Boudreault, 2000). This method is 
considered adequate, but may present titanium saturation problems with high 
grade samples. Phosphorous detection limit (2σ) is a little elevated at 0.03%. The 
method provided analyses of major oxides, plus elemental barium, chromium and 
strontium. Loss on ignition (LOI) was also measured. Samples from 1999 were also 
assayed using ICP-AES after Aqua-Regia digestion, providing a whole range of 
elements. Samples were milled and pulverized using standard CW ringmills. 
 

• Surface samples from 2008-2009 were assayed using ICP-AES after a four-acid 
digestion for major elements, plus induced coupled plasma mass spectrometry 
after four acids digestion for trace elements. Using a multi-acid digestion instead of 
borate bead fusion may cause incomplete dissolution and underestimation of 
titanium. Since no reference material was inserted, no verification is possible on 
this issue. 

Apatite is not refractory to 

most digestion methods used 

for assaying. 

Titanium oxides are 

notorious for being 

refractory both in digestion 

and borate glass melting.

• Drill core from 2008-2009 were assayed using XRF on fused borate beads (Tollari 
and Boulianne, 2009). The method provided analyses of major oxides, including 
barium, strontium and chromium oxides. Lost on ignition (LOI) was also measured. 
Compared to ICP-AES after borate fusion, this method, provides better precision 
and detection limits for phosphorus, is less prone to the nugget effect, and less 
sensitive to incomplete digestion. Samples were milled and pulverized using 
standard CW ringmills. 
 

• Samples from the last 2009 Paul zone campaign were brought to IOS facilities in 
Chicoutimi for crushing (3 mm) and riffle splitting. A 300-500 grams aliquot was 
submitted to ALS-Chemex in Val-d'Or for XRF assaying on fused borate bead. 
Rejects were kept and stored temporarily at IOS, in prevision of metallurgical 
testing. 

 
15.2 Analytical quality control 
 
Analytical quality control of the present project is of concern for the following reasons: 
 

• The utmost important issue in analytical quality in 
the course of resource definition is accuracy. 
Routine assaying for titanium and phosphorous is 
not common in commercial, non-specialized 
assaying laboratories. Miscalibrations and 
inadequate methods are potential treats. Rigorous 
control of the assays with the use of certified 
reference material is a must. Any discrepancy in 
analytical accuracy will influences 
proportionally on resources calculation and overall grade, and therefore on 
the economical analysis. 
 

• Tampering with the samples for phosphorus and titanium is not an issue. Apatite 
and ilmenite are readily visible in the core. The high grades make tampering 
impractical. The author examined the core on many occasions and testifies to the 
presence of these minerals in accordance with their typical assays. 
 

• Considering the large width and grade consistency of the mineralized intersection, 
sample inversion, mixing and robustness are not a concern. Intercalation of 
abundant (>15%) reference materials in order to control for them is not considered 
necessary. 
 

• Use of samples aliquots, hole twins, quarter-splits, and other duplication methods 
will provide precision of the assays, but will by no means provides any indication of 
accuracy. 

Routine assaying for titanium 

and phosphorous is not 

common in commercial, non‐

specialized assaying 

laboratories. Rigorous quality 

control is prerequisite.

No rigorous quality control protocol was applied for the analyses of Soquem-Virginia 
samples, d'Arianne-FMSLSJ samples, d'Arianne 2008-2009 surface sampling program nor 
for d'Arianne's exploration drilling program. Analysis of quality control material provided by 
the laboratory were not compiled nor disclosed. No reference material was added by the 
clients. 
 
D'Arianne implemented a QCQA program in the course of their 2008-2009 definition 
drilling program. It consisted of: 
 

• Introduction of a certified reference material (CRM) among the samples. This 
material, KPT-1, is a quartz diorite prepared by the Université du Québec à 
Chicoutimi geochemistry laboratory, and has been tested in various commercial 
and/or academic laboratories in order to obtain certification (Webb et al, 2006). The 
silicate matrix of this material can be compared to the anorthositic gabbro, but not 
to the nelsonite which is the main ore carrier. Recommended phosphate grade is 
0.17% P2O5, which is a fortieth of the current ore and too low to certify the current 
results. Recommended titanium grade is 0.90% TiO2, likely silicate hosted, which is 
a tenth of the current ore grade and unsuitable for certification of current results. 
This CRM has been assayed 35 times for d'Arianne: every 50 samples or 2% of the 
sample population. Statistics are presented in table 5 and indicate an excellent 
accuracy and precision of the method, although it cannot be extrapolated to ore 
grades. 
 

• D'Arianne did not inserted blank materials or placebos. 
 

• The number of control materials inserted by the client, limited to 2% of the 
population, is not sufficient to detect sample inversion or other robustness issues. 
 

• Quality control protocols implemented by ALS-Chemex include analytical 
replication, certified reference material analysis, internal reference analysis and 
blank analysis. Results of these tests have not been compiled by d'Arianne nor by 
the author. 
 

• SGS Canada Inc. representatives (Duplessis, 2009) made a detailed evaluation of 
the analytical quality in the course of their mineral resource calculations. They 
personally collected a quarter-split of 83 samples from holes Pau-08-02, 
Pau-08-12, Man-09-10 and Man-09-11. These samples were shipped to SGS-
Lakefield for assaying by X-ray fluorescence on borate fused beads1. They found a 

                                                 
1 Analytical method is not indicated either on SGS-Lakefield certificates or in the 
SGS Canada Inc. report. The author concluded that XRF was used, according to 
the element package reported.

minor discrepancy between the laboratories: P2O5 grades are about 2% higher and 
TiO2 grates are 3% lower at SGS than at ALS Chemex. Only a rudimentary 
statistical analysis was offered to substantiate this conclusion. Various statistical 
tools are available to test paired samples population but were not applied: 
correlation diagram, Student-t test and regression analysis are but a few. 
Irregularities in the database provided to the author prevented him from performing 
such tests, and forced him to rely totally on SGS's opinion.

Quality control for the 2009 exploration drilling included only a single reference material 
and a single blank sample, for 2% control. 
 
A tighter quality control protocol was recommended for the 2009 definition drilling in Paul 
zone by the author. The recommendations followed by d'Arianne were the systematic 
insertion of blanks (pure Grenville quartz provided by IOS) and adequate certified 
reference materials such as NCS-DD-79003 from Sylab (6.06% P2O5) and SARM-32 from 
Mintek (39.96% P2O5), for a total of 110 analyses, or 10%.

ITEM 16: DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The author carried out a limited amount of verification on the d'Arianne database, such as 
the redrawing of drill-hole sections and maps. A few certificates of analysis were compared 
with the database provided by d'Arianne. Data from the last drill campaign was reviewed

ITEM 17: ADJACENT PROPERTIES  
 
Mineral property ownership was verified by the author on 26 April, 2010 in the MRNF on-
line registry Gestim (see item 6.7). Of these, only the MHY property of Virginia-Soquem, 
located to the east of d'Arianne, is of interest for its copper and nickel potential. It is 
uncertain if this property hosts any apatite occurrence, but the proper lithofacies were 
reported. The four (4) claims owned by Wayne Holmstead to the south-west cover a 
former set of Soquem-Virginia drill holes, which are reputed to include some apatite 
bearing gabbro. 
 
No adjacent apatite occurrences currently staked by third parties are known to the author.

ITEM 18: MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
18.1 Generalities 
 
Nelsonite processing for the production of apatite and ilmenite concentrates is not new. 
Processes were developed as early as 1913 (Waggaman) in order to treat such ore from 
Nelson county, Virginia. Saklatwalla and Dunn filed US no1 999 825 patent in 1933 for a 
simple magnetic separator. The main mineral constituent of lac à Paul nelsonite having 
contrasting properties, separation of these is not considered difficult. 
 
18.2 IOS work in 2001 
 
A series of tests have been conducted by IOS between 1998 and 2001 for the FMSLSJ, 
and subsequently for d'Arianne. 
 
A first test was carried out on a nelsonitic gabbro from an unknown location on behalf of 
the FMSLSJ (Girard, 1998), which was pulverized <2 mm by the client. 
 

• A 22 kilogram aliquot was subjected to gravimetric separation on a shaking (Wilfley 
derivative) table. Apatite did not separate well, due to the small density contrast 
with other silicate minerals (actinolite, olivine, etc.). 
 

• A 2 kilogram aliquot was subjected to heavy liquid separation, using 
tetrabromomethane at a density of 2.90 g/cc, which gave good results. The heavy 
concentrate was then subjected to high intensity magnetic separation with the use 
of a Frantz isodynamic separator, which was time consuming. The apatite 
concentrate was clean, but the ilmenite concentrate contained more than 50% 
silicates. 
 

o The apatite concentrate was submitted for assaying and was near 
stoichiometric at 40.55% P2O5 (88.4 BPL) with less than 3.37% impurities. 
Deleterious contaminants were not analyzed. 

o Ilmenite was separated manually under a binocular microscope, and 
submitted to analysis. Titanium dioxide was assayed by gravimetric 
methods, and returned 47.2% to 48.0%. Such grade is near to 
stoichiometric for ilmenite. Contaminant grades were low, with 0.45% MgO, 
0.37% Cao.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

A second test was performed for d'Arianne Resources in 2001 by IOS (Villeneuve, 2001). 
A series of 10 samples, 30 to 500 kilograms each, were collected in zone no1 and its 
vicinity. These samples were mainly desegregated anorthositic gabbro interlayered with 
nelsonitic gabbro, typical of zones no1 to no3, and were targeted assuming that the low 
apatite grade could be compensated for by low mining and grinding cost of the loose 
material. 

 
• Samples were crushed with a 6" jaw crusher, then with a 3/8" gyratory crusher and 

finally milled in a porcelain disk pulverizer. Granulometry curves and power 
consumption were measured, and work index calculated (Aubin, 2000). Work 
indexes calculated with this protocol do not comform with Bond's index, and shall 
be used only for comparison. 
 

• Aliquots from the various grinding tests were separated using heavy liquids: 
methylene iodide at a density of 3.32 g/cc to separate ilmenite and magnetite from 
other minerals. The light fraction was reprocessed with tetrabromoethane at 
2.90 g/cc to separate ferromagnesian minerals and apatite from plagioclase. 
 

• Both the >3.32 g/cc and the <3.32->2.90 g/cc fractions were processed using a 
hand magnet to remove magnetite, and then with a Frantz isodynamic separator 
with an increasing field intensity. The various fractions were evaluated under a 
binocular microscope. 
 

o A clean >96% ilmenite concentrate was obtained at >3.32 g/cc and 0.2 
amperes, if ground finer than 250 μm. 

o A clean >90% apatite concentrate was obtained at 3.32-2.96 g/cc for the 
diamagnetic fraction. 

o As recovery was reported as rather low, mass balance calculation was not 
done. 
 

• Cleanliness of the concentrates is attributed to a contrast in physical properties 
between ore and gangue, absence of hornblende which could contaminate the 
ilmenite concentrate, absence of aluminosilicate which can contaminate the apatite 
concentrate, and the straight mineral contacts enabling easy liberation. 
 

• Concentrate quality does not appear to be sensitive to grinding mesh. 
 

• Ilmenite assays, using ICP-OES after sodium peroxide fusion, range between 
45.94% and 47.54% TiO2, which is near stoichiometric (52.6% TiO2). the quality of 
this concentrate is better than the usual commercial ilmenite, which typically grades 
35% TiO2. Magnesium stands at 0.06%, far below deleterious levels. Calcium is 
assayed at 0.2 to 2.0%, likely due to the presence of apatite. Other deleterious 
elements were below industry requirements.

• Apatite grades about 41.39% P2O5 (90% BPL) near the stoichiometric value of 
42.4% P2O5. Deleterious contaminant levels are very low, with lead below 5 ppm, 
cadmium below 0.3 ppm, arsenic below 6 ppm, and other elements below detection 
limits. Uranium, thorium, fluorine and chlorine were not measured. 
 

18.3 SGS-Lakefield work in 2008 

Another set of metallurgical tests was commissioned from SGS-Lakefield in 2008 (Yu and 
Raabe, 2009, figure 12). Three samples were submitted, from Paul, Manouane and zone 
no2. The purpose of the test was to produce clean apatite concentrates. 

• Samples were crushed to 1/2 inch, split, crushed to 10 mesh, and made into 2 
kilogram charges. Four samples were created, one for each zone plus a composite. 

• Gravity separation for ilmenite was tested and promptly abandoned. 

• Magnetic separation removed 30% of the iron efficiently, likely as magnetite, which 
is a flotation depressor. It did not prove efficient for titanium recovery. 

• Rougher flotation, using soda ash as pH modifier, caustic starch as iron depressor 
and FA2 as collector enabled a P2O5 recovery of 88.6% to 95.8% and TiO2 
recovery mostly negligible but up to 66.6%. 

• A cleaner flotation of the best concentrate obtained from the rougher flotation 
provided a final recovery of 80.1% to 91.5%, if a few failed tests are excluded, with 
a concentrate grading 37.0% to 40.2% P2O5 (80,7% BPL to 87.6% BPL). 

• High intensity wet magnetic separation (WHIMS) of apatite concentrates did not 
improve concentrate quality. 

• High intensity wet magnetic separation (WHIMS) of the flotation tailings did not 
provide conclusive results. 

• Deleterious contaminant in the apatite concentrates were: 

o Chlorine: 884 to 1201 ppm 

o Fluorine: 1.53 to 1.82% 

o Uranium: <20 ppm 

o Cadmium: <2 ppm 

o Lead: <30 to 50 ppm

ITEM 19: MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
A first evaluation of the resources was attempted by d'Arianne based on the 2001 drilling 
campaign in zones no1 and no2 (Boulianne, 2001). These calculations are not CIM 
guidelines compliant and shall not be included in a 43-101 compliant report. 
 
A second, CIM guidelines compliant evaluation of the resources was completed in 2009 by 
SGS Canada Inc. for zones Paul, Manouane and zone 2 (Duplessis, 2009). Evaluation for 
Paul zone has been recently updated by integrating last 
autumn 2009 definition drilling. The following section 
reports on this resource estimate, prepared by and under 
the responsibility of Mr. Robert de l'Étoile, P. Eng., from 
SGS Canada Inc. 
 
Note: This report presents only mineral resources. There are no mineral reserves at this 
stage on this project. 
 
The lac à Paul deposit contains 3 zones, Paul, Manouane and zone 2 in which mineral 
resources are estimated. 
 
The mineral resources reported in this study are an update of those estimated in 2009. 
These updated resources include drilling that was done during 2009 after the publication of 
the original technical report (SGS-Canada Inc., May 8, 2009). 
 
The 2009 drilling took place in the Paul zone. As a consequence, only the mineral 
resources in this zone have significantly changed. This 
mineral resource update also includes a minor adjustment 
to the Manouane zone. No new drilling was done on this 
zone but two holes with erroneous coordinates were 
relocated which led to a minor update in the geological 
interpretation and mineral resource estimation.  
 
The zone 2 remained unchanged since the last mineral 
resource estimation of 2009. All references to zone 2 are identical to those presented in 
the previous technical report. (SGS-Canada Inc., May 8, 2009). 
 
 

There is no mineral reserve 

at this stage of the project. 

2009 drilling took place only 

in Paul zone. Subsequently, 

only mineral resources of this 

zone have significantly 

changed since the first 

publication

19.1 Data used 
 
Arianne provided SGS with a drill hole database containing all available holes on the 
deposit. The database was in Microsoft Access format. After conversion to SGS 
compatible format and validation, the database contained a total of 69 drill holes. The 
database contained holes for different zones. For the purpose of this update study, only 
holes from the Paul zone (33 holes) and Manouane (16 holes) were used. 
 
The database of 69 drill holes for the entire lac à Paul property cumulates a total length of 
9883 meters of which 5692 meters in Paul zone, 2265 meters in Manouane zone and 
924 meters in zone 2. 
 
The database contains a total of 3261 assay records (2166 in Paul zone, 700 in Manouane 
zone, 293 in zone 2). The assay records have room for the following elements: SiO2, 
Al2O3, CaO, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, TiO2, BaOand SrO. Not all records 
contain all elements. Certain old holes (1997) in Manouane zone only contain information 
for P2O5 and TiO2. 
 
Deviation measurements were taken in the drill holes, some with acid tests, and others 
with a Flexit instrument. The deposit lying in a magnetic environment, the Flexit azimuth 
information was discarded, keeping only the plunges. 
 
The database contains a total of 729 lithology records (411 in Paul zone, 169 in 
Manouane zone and 63 in zone 2). 
 
The database does not contain RQD information. 
 
19.1.1 Comparison of the 2009 versus 2008 assay results 
 
Considering new drilling was added to the database since the last mineral resource 
estimation, we have compared the average P2O5 and TiO2 grades of the 2008 drilling 
versus the newer 2009 drilling. This comparison only relates to the data in Paul zone since 
the 2009 drill holes were all from this zone. 
 
We have observed a decrease in P2O5 grades in the range of 5 to 7% at all P2O5 cut-off 
grades examined. The TiO2 grades have slightly increased (in the range of 3 to 4%). The 
following table (table 6) presents the results of the comparison.

19.2 Topographic survey 
 
NOTE: This section is reproduced from the 2009 technical report (SGS-Canada Inc., 
May 8, 2009). No new topographic information was added to the current data set. 
 
19.2.1 Line cuttings 
 
Arianne Resources has contracted line cutters in order to prepare access over the 3 zones 
of interest; Paul, Manouane and zone 2. The lines were cut to allow circulation of 
personnel and give drill access along the lines. 
 
19.2.2 Differential GPS survey along lines by Mesures Lasertech Inc. 
 
Arianne Resources has contracted an independent surveyor to survey topography with a 
differential GPS along the lines in order to be able to have a representative and adequate 
surface for resource calculation. At the moment of the survey some holes were already 
drilled so exact position was surveyed while in other case theoretical position was 
surveyed. Final survey was done with hand help and validated from marks in the field from 
exact DGPS positioning (figures 13 to 16).

The AutoCAD file was used to create surface for resource estimation. Each zone has a 
local field line grid, however UTM NAD 83 is used as the project coordinate system. The 
resource model uses the UTM NAD 83 system and the surveyed topography model. 
 
The topographic survey was completed before the drilling of the 2009 holes. Hence, the 
2009 drill hole coordinates were obtained using a handheld GPS receiver. SGS 
recommends that the new holes be surveyed accurately. 
 
19.3 Mineralized envelope 
 
In order to adequately define the mineralized envelopes, a mineralized solid was defined 
using geological description and grade information along the drill hole core (figure 17). 
 
The mineralized envelopes were built on sections (figure 18) and subsequently connected 
to form solids. Solids were then sliced on horizontal levels (figure 19)

19.3.2 Paul zone 
 
In 2009, 18 holes were drilled on Paul zone, with the objective to delineate a certain 
amount of indicated resources. These are in addition of the previous 15 holes, bringing the 
total to 33 holes (figure 20 to 32).  
 
A relatively rich TiO2 layer is observed on the north side of the zone with very low P2O5. 
This feature has been used as a guideline to assist in the interpretation of the eastern 
extension of the deposit. We are in the opinion the phosphate rich layer on the eastern 
most section was missed by drilling.

19.3.3 Manouane Zone 
 
No new holes were added on Manouane zone (figure 33 to 38). Only holes MAN-97-01 
and MAN-97-02 were relocated to correct position errors in the 2009 database. Some 
slight changes were made to the mineralized envelope to account for the relocation of the 
holes. 
 
Drilling was done in winter with a snow cover, while topographic survey was done prior in 
autumn, without such snow cover. This discrepancy leads to swelling of the overburden 
(snow) and therefore a truncation of the orebody at surface.

19.4 Mineralized intersections  
 
Mineralized intersections are defined as the section of each drill holes including samples 
within the interpreted limits of mineralized zones. Most intersections in drill holes are 
complete (start and end points at zone limits) and free of unsampled sections. A total of 45 
intersections were defined, some holes having two or more intersections. In the 2010 
mineral resource update, only the Paul and Manouane 
zones mineralized intersection have been updated. Zone 
2 intersections are identical to those used in the 2009 
mineral resource estimation. 
 
The average core length in the mineralized intersections is 104.5 m. 
 
The following table (table 7) is the list of the mineralized intersections used for the creation 
of standard length composites1. The mineralized intersections may include intermediate 
barren samples.  
 
 

                                                 
1 Girard: slight difference can be noticed between this table and table 2 and section 
in item 26, due to a difference in selection parameters. 

The average core length in 

the minerailzed intersections 

is 104.5 metres.

19.5 Compositing of assay intervals within mineralized intercepts  
 
Since original assay intervals do not all have the same length, it is necessary to 
standardize the length of the grade "support" through numerical compositing before 
assigning grades to dimensionless "points" in the 3D space (the composite centers) in the 
block grade interpolation. 
 
Most assay intervals have length of 1.5 or 3 metres. The selectivity of 1.5 metre is not 
commonly achievable in bulk tonnage mining; therefore a 3 metres standard length has 
been selected. This also allows for internal smoothing and internal dilution, since it could 
be difficult and unrealistic in the lac à Paul context to exclude dykes and barren inclusions 
of smaller dimension within a blast. The core sections that are not analysed are considered 
barren with %P2O5 and %TiO2 equal to 0.0%. 
 
No capping on grade is applied, not considered necessary. 
 
Compositing is done downhole from the start of the mineralized intersection. Missing 
assays and unsampled length are assumed to be zero grade. At the end of the mineralized 
intersection, the last retained composite is the last with a minimum length of 1.5 metre.  It 
is important to mention that only composites within the mineralized envelopes have been 
used to estimate the mineral resources. 
 
The following table (table 8) presents the basic statistics of the composites used in the 
grade interpolation process, per zone.

19.6 Specific gravity data 
 
Specific gravity measurements were taken by SGS on core from the autumn 2008 and 
winter 2009 drill program (Duplessis, 2009). No new specific gravity measurements were 
done on the 2009 core. From these measurements, an 
average specific gravity to convert volumes into tonnes 
was a fixed value of 3.23 t/m3 for zone 2, 3.58t/m3 for 
Paul and 3.58 t/m3 for Manouane zone. No attempt to 
adjust this specific gravity in regard of mineral or 
chemical composition was made1. More abundant measurement of specific gravity are 
obviously needed to improve the resource estimate. 
 
19.7 Resource block grade interpolation 
 
All estimations are done with SGS Canada Inc. Ltd. BLKCAD block modeling and resource 
estimation software. 
 
19.7.1 Zone 2 
 
On zone 2 deposit, grades were estimated for every 10 m (EW) x 10 m (NS) x 10 m (Z) 
voxel, commonly refered as block, according to a regular matrix of 161 columns (EW), 179 
rows (NS) and 32 benches (Z) with its center within the limits of the mineralized zones 
(figure 39). This represent a total of 20 272 blocks within the envelope, calculated from 
383 composites (data points representing 3 meters long drill core intervals). The block 
model is truncated by the overburden\rock interface or the topographic surface.  
 
The average %P2O5 and %TiO2 grades is computed for each block using interpolation 
according to the inverse of the distance from the nearest composites. Interpolation 
parameters were based on drill spacing, envelope extension and orientation. Interpolation 
parameters were set as follow: 

                                                 
1 Girard: Density measurements were made by SGS in the Manouane zone and by 
d'Arianne in Paul a no2 zones. It is the author's opinion that these measurements 
are not sufficiently abundant neither is accurate enough to support accurate 
resource estimates. A significant density difference is expected between nelsonites 
and anorthosite, up to 35%, and proper density shall be assigned to each resource 
block. Such density can be calculated from the analyses if a set of accurate density 
is calibrated for a set of samples. In the absence of such measurements, 
imprecision on density can be considered as the largest source of error on tonnage 
estimate.

19.7.2 Paul zone 
 
Drilling sections on Paul zone are spaced every 100 metres, which enable upgrading 
resource category from inferred to estimated resources.  
 
Grades were estimated for every 10 m (EW) x 10 m (NS) x 10 m (Z) voxel according to a 
regular matrix of 171 columns (EW), 86 rows (NS) and 38 benches (Z) with its center 
within the limits of the mineralized zones. This represent a total of 40 432 blocks within the 
envelope, calculated from 1247 composites (data points representing 3 meters long drill 
core intervals). The block model is truncated by the overburden\rock interface or the 
topographic surface.  
 
The average %P2O5 and %TiO2 grades is computed for each block using interpolation 
according to the inverse of the distance from the nearest composites. 
 
The block model was interpolated in two parts, east and west, each with a specific search 
ellipse to match the change of dip along strike (figures 41, 42 and 43). The western part 
(west of 375390E) was interpolated with an ellipse dipping to the south-west while the 
eastearn part (east of 375390E) was interpolated with a search ellipse dipping to the 
south-east. Interpolation parameters were set as follow:

19.8 Mineral Resource classification 
19.8.1 Paul zone 
 
Duplessis (2009) classified the Paul zone resources in inferred category based on then 
available drilling. Using the recent 2009 drilling added to this zone, a portion of the inferred 
mineral resources estimated in 2009 was upgraded to the indicated category. This drilling 
filled the gaps between earlier drill sections, providing a drill spacing of approximately 
100 m within the indicated zone. 
 
The following figures illustrate the classification of the resources within the mineralized 
envelope (figures 46 to 49).

Since no new holes were added to this zone, all mineral resources remain in the inferred 
category such as in the 2009 mineral resource estimation. 
 
19.9 Resource estimates 
 
The following mineral resource estimates are presented for each zone (tables 9 to 12). 
The resources are the sum of all individual block tonnages. Mineral resources are 
presented at a variety of P2O5 cut-off grades. It is assumed that the mineral resources at a

19.10 Interpretation and conclusions of SGS Canada Inc. in regards of resources 
estimates 
 
In 2009, a drilling campaign added 18 drill holes to the 
Paul zone. Mineral resources for this zone have been 
updated. The drilling program was conceived in order to fill 
in the grid and upgrade inferred mineral resources to the 
indicated category. Also, the zone was extended to the 
west by adding a new hole, increasing the tonnage of inferred resources. 
 
Although no new drilling took place in 2009 on Manouane and zone 2, minor adjustments 
were made to their resource estimates. Resources on these two zones remain totally in the 
inferred category. In the Manouane zone, 2 holes were relocated to correct erroneous 
previous coordinates and the mineralized envelope was slightly adjusted. In the zone 2, 
minor adjustments were done to the overburden – bedrock surface. Also, minor 
adjustments to the interpolation parameters were made to render them similar to the Paul 
and Manouane ones. 
 
A cut-off grade of 2% P2O5 has been used as base case scenario for the technico-
economic model. Using such 2% P2O5 cut-off, mineral resources for the Lac à Paul Project 
now stand at (table 13 to 16): 

In 2009, a total of 18 new 

drill holes were added on 

Paul zone, providing sections 

with 100 metres spacing.

19.11 Comments of the main author 
 
 
The first author does not have the ability nor the software needed to reproduce SGS 
Canada Inc. estimation, and thus relies on R. de l'Étoile's opinion. However, the author did 
manually calculate simple block diagrams which enable him to approximately corroborate 
SGS Canada Inc. results. Such reproducibility is considered sufficient considering the 
"inferred and indicated" classification and the various shape assumptions made by SGS 
Canada Inc. It is in the main author's opinion that: 
 

• SGS Canada Inc. calculations are fully acceptable, within the precision needed 
for  the economic assesment and in accordance with best industry practice. 
 

• There is no need to review this estimation in order to refine the model until more 
drilling is available to constrain the model. 

 
• The largest errors are likely in volume extrapolation outside the drill pattern 

Interpolation methods and computation algorithms shall be robust. Volume to 
tonnage conversion using the currently poorly constrained specific gravity shall 
also be considered as a potential large source of error. Density measurements, 
geometric control and assay precision will need to be addressed atop of further 
infill drilling in order to improve reliability of the estimate and bring resources into 
measured category. 

 
• Considering that all three deposits are open at depth, resources can easily be 

increased. The depth constrain is likely to be dictated by mining plan rather than 
resource availability. 
 

• The largest uncertainties in the economic models are still related to resources, as 
it will be discussed in item 20. 

 
• Resources models using 2% P2O5 cut-off are poorly constrained and shall be 

considered as open. Therefore, further drilling is likely to expand the size of the 
deposit and hence the available resources. Increasing the available resources is 
the determinant factor on economic robustness of the project.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

ITEM 20: OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 
20.1 Foreword 
 
The scope of the current report was to provide d'Arianne with a preliminary economic 
assessment of the Lac à Paul Project with respect to apatite production. This assessment 
is intended as a decisional tool to help justify further investment to bring the project into 
prefeasibility. 
 
The author considered d'Arianne project strictly as a mining operation, producing apatite 
concentrate. He did not consider d'Arianne's 
opportunity for converting its apatite concentrate 
into phosphoric acid. Assuming the mining 
operation is viable, this option will have to be 
evaluated in the future. However, such evaluation is 
outside the expertise of the author and will require 
the involvement of specialized firms. 
 
The current version of the report meant to be an update of the version released January 12 
2010. The economical assessment part of the report has been updated using the new 
resources made available for Paul zone, including both indicated and inferred categories. 
The diminution in grade compared to previous resources has a negative impact on 
operation cost and thus profitability and net present value of the project. Inversely, the 
tonnage increase is not sufficient to rescale the project. Using a similar production rate, 
this resource increased allows a longer mining life, which is beneficial to the economic 
robustness of the project. The author considers there is no need to updates other aspect 
of the sensitivity analysis. Since the previous estimate is only a few months old, capital and 
operation costs were not revised. Equipment and infrastructure requirements are 
considered near identical for both models. 
 
20.2 Phosphate market 

Phosphate is a non-renewable, non-recyclable and non-substitutable commodity, however 
an essential one.   
 
Although phosphate is the fifth largest mineral commodity in terms of value produced in the 
world, it is an industrial mineral, with all its market peculiarities. An understanding of this

market is needed to address economic assessment and project's viability. Most of the 
information in this section is obtained from a confidential report produced by British 
Sulphur Consultant, details of which cannot be disclosed1. 
 
20.3 Usage 

All the phosphates produced in the world go into phosphoric acid production (H3PO4). This 
acid is used either by the fertilizer industry (87% in 2007) as "green merchant grade" (or 
MGA) or as a food additive and in the industrial chemical industry as "white technical 
grade" phosphoric acid. MGA is produced by attacking phosphate rocks with sulphuric 
acid, representing 72% of total phosphoric acid production. Upgrading merchant grade to 
technical grade is done by solvent extraction to produce a "purified wet process acid" or 
PPA. Production of reagent grade (very pure) acid, such as used in the chemical industry, 
requires a different process. Phosphate rocks are reduced in an arc furnace into elemental 
yellow phosphorus, which is then burnt into air to produce phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) 
and dissolved in water to produce the acid. Technical grade phosphoric acid is used in 
animal feed supplements, detergents and as an additive in human food plus various other 
applications (figure 51).

Figure 51: Uses of phosphates. All uses other than fertilizer require technical grade 
phosphoric acid. 
 
 
Phosphoric acid is transformed into a variety of chemical compounds: MAP, DAP, TAP 
(mono, di, tri-ammonium phosphate) for the fertilizer industry, DCP, MCP, DFP for the feed 
industry, STTP (sodium tripolyphosphate) for detergent, etc. Although there are only a 
handful of phosphoric acid conversion plants in North America, there are numerous plants 
converting acid into fertilizer. Plants are located close to markets because nitrate-base 
fertilisers are hazardous materials and their transportation costs are elevated. Inversely, 
phosphoric acid is not considered a hazardous material in regard of transportation. 
 
20.4 Market structure 
 
The main end-product for phosphate is fertilizers. Fertilizer demand is driven by crop 
production. Crop production, mainly as grain, is expected to increase steadily due to 
human population growth, changing eating habits of the emerging middle class in 
developing economies (BRIC) and, potentially, the increasing demand for biofuel in mature 
economies. This increase in fertilizer demand has to be balanced by an increase in 
phosphate production, both at mining and phosphoric acid conversion levels. The increase 
in world demand is expected to grow at 2.1% per annum according to BSC.

The world phosphate rock consumption hovers around 170 million tons per year (2007). 
The world phosphate exploitable resource base at less than US$40/ton is pegged at 32 
billion tons; triple this number for a US$60/ton cut-off. This represents about 200 years of 
reserve. There is no mid-term commodity shortage. 
 
Phosphate production capacity is roughly in equilibrium with phosphoric acid production 
capacity. Phosphate market price is dictated by production costs, not by availability. 
Phosphate rock production is limited by phosphoric acid plant capacity. Therefore, 
phosphate production is constrained downward by mining capacity and upward by refining 
capacity. No premium is paid for the resource itself. Furthermore, most fertilizer producers 
are vertically integrated. Therefore, phosphoric acid plans are located near phosphate 
mines, which are in a captive market. Phosphate price is usually not volatile. Only a 
temporary imbalance between production capacity and consumption can cause prices to 
fluctuate on the spot market. Mining capacities are currently estimated at 
211 million tons/year, operating at 82%. Stimulated by last year's price increase, producing 
capacities are expected to expand to 281 million tons/year by 2017, while consumption is 
expected to expand to 216 million tons, for 77% operation capacity. The global phosphate 
market is expected to deteriorate due to this increase in capacity. 
 

Phosphate deposits are scattered around the world. 
Phosphates are used in agriculture, thus all around the 
world. Most phosphate producers are vertically 
integrated, if not government run. Therefore, 
phosphate is not a significantly traded commodity on 
the international market, with only 31 million tons 
traded, or 18%. Only about half of this trade is related 

to intercontinental trade. Trading fluctuations (2007) are indicated in figure 52 (taken from 
BSC). Highlights are: 
 

• Exports are dominated by Morocco. 
• European market is dominated by import from Russia and Morocco. 
• North American deficit is imported from Morocco. 
• Asian deficit, caused by Chinese export reduction, is imported from Africa and 

Middle-East.

vertically integrated, if not

phosphate is not a significantly 

traded commodity on the 

international market.

Figure 52: International phosphate trading routes for 2007 (taken from BSC 2008) 
 
 
Morocco, with the largest base resource and port proximity to producer, dominates the 
export market. Phosphates prices are usually stated as FOB Casablanca, for a 72% BPL1 
(32% P2O5). The cost of shipment to importing country is added to the price. 
 
As many other mineral commodities, the price of phosphate showed a long term decline 
until 2007, when it reached its minimum at US$50/ton (figure 53). This decline was related 
strictly to improvements in mining methods. In 2007, phosphate prices increased 
dramatically, peaking at US$450/ton. Causes were multiple, some being conjectural, some 
being structural. Among the structural causes were an increase in fertilizer demand, 
withdrawal of China as net exporter, and consolidation among producers. BSC forecasts 
the mid-term price to stabilize around US$70/ton, FOB Morocco 72% BPL.

Figure 53: Phosphate price through time (taken from BSC 2007). 
 
 
Phosphate is a bulk commodity; its value can be lower 
than its transportation cost. Transportation cost must be 
added to the commodity price to evaluate a project. If a 
producer is located close to its market, transportation 
savings can then make a high-cost producer viable. 
 
D'Arianne project is likely to be a medium cost producer. It will not be able to compete 
against producers in Morocco or the Middle-East in their traditional export markets. 
However, the d'Arianne project is likely to be viable in the domestic North American market 
and maybe even on the western European market, where its production costs can be 
compensated by low delivery costs, and where its low contaminant level is advantageous. 
 

Transportation cost must be 

added to the commodity 

price to evaluate a project.

20.5 Costs for transatlantic shipments 
 

Expediting a bulk commodity by boat usually requires 
chartering a vessel. Chartering contracts are highly volatile, 
and can shift by an order of magnitude depending on 
availability and market, as shown on the Baltic Dry Index 
(http://www.dryships.com/pages/report.asp). Bulk carrier 

vessels chartered for dry commodities such as phosphate are usually Handymax class 
vessels (35 000-75 000 tons), typically at US$50 000 per day. Including loading, 
unloading, stand-by time and time at sea, transatlantic shipment costs are estimated at 
US$40-50 per ton. This cost has to be added to FOB Morocco phosphates delivered in 
Tampa, or inversely, d'Arianne's shipment delivered in Rotterdam. Moroccan phosphate 
72% BPL is estimated to cost US$110-120 per ton delivered in North America. 
 
20.6 North American market 
 
North America is characterized by a mature and industrialized agriculture, which 
traditionally relies on chemical fertilizers. North American demands amounted to 
34.8 million tons in 2007, the bulk of which (98%) was in United States. The demand is 
expected to decrease to 31.3 million tons by 2012, and to stabilize (figure 54). This 
decrease is related to more efficient agricultural practices and environmental constrains. 
North America's production capacity is currently set at 36.9 million tons (2007), but is 
expected to decline to 34.7 million tons. The decline takes place in spite of new producers 
such as Phoscan. Despite this capacity, North America produced 28.5 million tons in 2007, 
for 84% utilisation. This represented a production deficit of 2.8 million tons in 2007. The 
shortfall was imported from Morocco. Production is not expected to increase significantly 
for the next ten years and the deficit is considered as endemic. 
 
Filling the endemic phosphate rock deficit of North America can be considered as a prime 
opportunity for d'Arianne. 

Moroccan phosphate 72% 

BPL is estimated to cost 

US$110‐120 per ton 

delivered in North America.

Figure 54: North American phosphate market outlook (source of Data: BSC). 
 
 
North American phosphate consumption is dominated 
by the Mid-West wheat and corn belt. North American 
phosphate production is dominated by Florida, in the 
Tampa area (figure 55). Sedimentary phosphorite is 
mined in large open pit mines and feed adjacent 
phosphoric acid plants. Mosaic is the dominant 
player. However, the best deposits are exhausted; 
four mines are planned to close in the next 10 years, 
while environmental restrictions and social 
acceptability prevent the opening of new ones. Production is in decline, even if capacity is 
maintained. The bulk of the Moroccan imports are destined to feed Mosaic's acid plants. 
The delivered price of these phosphate rocks in Tampa is not disclosed.

expected, except for Agrium mines which are near to exhaustion. The Agrium phosphoric 
plant can be considered as a potential market for d'Arianne. 
 
Finally, Northern Ontario has emerged as a phosphate district, with Agrium's Kapuskasing 
mine and the advanced Phoscan project in Hearst. Both of these projects are mining 
apatite-bearing carbonatite (known as "foskorite"), and thus produce clean apatite 
concentrates, similar to the d'Arianne concentrate. The Kapuskasing concentrate is 
shipped by rail to Agrium's Red River phosphoric acid plant in Alberta. Phoscan is 
expected to build its own phosphoric acid plant directly in Hearst and ship the acid to 
Manitoba for ATP conversion. Selling price for apatite concentrates is not disclosed. 
 
20.7 Shipment costs within North America 
 
While most phosphate production is in Florida, fertilizers are sold all over North America, 
and principally in the corn-belt and wheat-belt, in the American Mid-West. North America is 
disserved by a dense and efficient railway network. Most of the domestic bulk commodities 
are carried by rail. Hauling charges by rail are volatile and complex, being quoted on the 
spot price. Most places are served by a single railway, therefore origin and destination are 
usually served by different companies with complex agreements. Dry commodities, such 
as phosphates and fertilizers, are typically shipped in covered hoppers, 90-100 tons per 
car. Hauling charges are usually by chartered or contracted car-loads. 
 
D'Arianne's production is likely to represent 60-80 carloads per day, representing a 
complete block-train. Railcars could be loaded either at Dolbeau or Alma. The Dolbeau-
Chambord line is run by Chemin de fer d'intérêt local du nord du Québec (CFILNQ), a 
short line subsidiary of Canadian National Railway. Loading in Alma will require a tracking 
right up to Saguenay-Power on the Roberval & Saguenay line (former Alma and Jonquière 
line), a private general carrier short-line owned and operated by Rio-Tinto-Alcan. From 
Saguenay-Power to Chambord and from Chambord to Garneau, the line is operated by the 
CFILNQ, with mainline standard 286 000 lb gross-weight capacity. However, this segment 
may show some congestion, and may require more sidings to accommodate d'Arianne's 
traffic. From Garneau, the line connects with the Canadian National network. Hauling 
charges over expected routes were obtained from the Canadian National web-site and are 
given in table 17.

20.8 Sulphuric acid 
 
The conversion of apatite to phosphoric acid is the largest end-user of sulphuric acid. 
These two markets cannot be dissociated and transportation cost of phosphate, sulphuric 
acid and phosphoric acid must be integrated. The basic reaction is: 
 
 
2 Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2SO4 <==> 6 CaSO4 + 4 H3PO4 
 
This translates into the following tonnage ratios: 
 
1 ton apatite 90%BPL + 0.91 ton sulphuric acid 93% <==>  
1.19 ton gypsum + 0.71 ton Phosphoric acid Technical grade 80% 

 
 

The conversion of d'Arianne's apatite production will 
require 1.8 million tons per year of sulphuric acid. This is 
a quarter of the total acid produced by Canadian smelters 
(±6.4 million tons per year), or comparable to all 
Canadian-based Ex-Strata smelters (copper, nickel and 
zinc). D'Arianne's demands would likely exceed the 
sulphuric acid availability on the Eastern Canadian 

market. Production of sulphuric acid from sulphur combustion will likely be needed, the 
option chosen by Phoscan in Hearst. Sulphur, a by-product form oil refineries, needs to be 
hauled from Alberta. One ton of sulphur is required to produce 3.3 tons of sulphuric acid 
93% technical grade. Therefore, half million tons of sulphur is needed for d'Arianne's project. 
Shipping costs of these commodities from Dolbeau to Calgary are listed in table 18, 
obtained from the Canadian National Railway web site. Converting apatite to phosphoric 
acid in Dolbeau offers about $50 per ton (30%) saving in transportation compared to 
shipping the apatite concentrate. Phosphoric acid is currently sold at about US$400 per 
ton, so the transportation savings are significant, representing 10% of the production cost.

20.9 Western European market 
 
The only phosphate production in Western Europe is in Finland, about 830 000 tons per 
year. Western Europe has to support a strong and industrialized agriculture relying on 
fertilizers. All phosphate and phosphoric acid have to be imported, either from Morocco 
and the Middle East to Spanish and Greek acid plants, or from the Kola Peninsula in 
Russia to Belgian plants. The Russian imports are apatite concentrate, similar to 
d'Arianne. The Russian production mainly comes from the Khibiny mine, which produces 
10.9 million tons per year. Surface open-pit reserves are apparently near exhaustion, but 
underground reserves are 4 billion tons at 15% P2O5. 
 
Russian apatite concentrate is currently sold at US$170/ton, FOB delivered in Rotterdam. 
Taking into account the transatlantic shipping cost, this leaves about US$130-140/ton as a 
selling price to d'Arianne. At such prices, d'Arianne can consider Western Europe as a 
potential market. 
 
20.10 Advantages of apatite compared to phosphate rocks 
 
The bulk of phosphate production comes from phosphorite, an impure sedimentary rock 
typically associated with limestone or evaporite sequences. About 21.53 million tons of 
apatite is produced from igneous sources, representing 12% of the world phosphate 
production. Igneous deposits are usually higher cost producers, but also have advantages. 
Its pros and cons are:

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

• Both igneous and sedimentary deposits are exploited mainly by open-pit methods. 
Stripping ratios are very diverse for both types. 
 

• Igneous deposits require a 1:3 to 1:6 enrichment factors to produce apatite 
concentrates, compared to 1:1.5 for typical sedimentary deposits. Mining and 
milling costs increase accordingly. 

 
• Milling of igneous rocks is more energy intensive. 

 
• Cost of production of a typical apatite concentrate is estimated to be twice that of 

phosphate from sedimentary rock. 
 

• Quality of phosphate produced from sedimentary rocks is in a constant decline. 
From an average of 71% BPL in 1975, it averages 64% BPL today. 

 
• Apatite concentrate from igneous origin has higher phosphorous grades than 

phosphate from sedimentary origin. Russian concentrates grade 86% BPL, 
Martison deposit is expected at 83% BPL, while d'Arianne is expected at >90% 
BPL. D'Arianne apatite contains 25% more phosphorous than Moroccan 
phosphates. This shall reflect directly on: 

 
o Selling prices, expected to be 25% higher based on the phosphorous 

content. 
o Shipping cost, expected to be 80% of Moroccan prices on a weight basis. 
o Processing cost, since 80% of the volume needs to be processed. 

 
• The excess of %BPL is typically carbonate of lime (calcite). A typical 72% BPL 

Moroccan phosphate contains 25-28% carbonate. Using the wet process, 
supplementary sulphuric acid is required to neutralize this lime. Phosphoric acid 
produced from 72% BPL phosphate rock requires about 30% more sulphuric acid 
than from apatite. Furthermore, the end-product of lime neutralization is carbon 
dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Wet processing 72% BPL phosphate rock releases 
about one sixth of its weight as carbon dioxide. 
 

o CaO:P2O5 of the  Moroccan phosphate is typically of 1.50:1, compared to 
1.34:1 for d'Arianne. 
 

• Phosphate rocks from sedimentary origin contain significant amounts of 
contaminants compared to apatite concentrates (table 19). 
 

• Part of the contaminant, among them uranium, are partitioned into the 
phosphogypsum, a by-product of the wet process. There is basically no industrial 
application for this contaminated gypsum. It is considered a hazardous industrial 
residue and requires safe burial, adding to production costs and environmental 
liabilities. Phosphogypsum produced from apatite is much less contaminated than

that from phosphate rocks and may be considered as sellable by-product for the 
production of goods such as wall board. 

 
• Purifying pregnant liquor from merchant to technical grade is more expensive for 

phosphate rock than for apatite because apatite is less contaminated. 
 

• Some contaminants from the wet process partition partly into the pregnant liquor, 
thus into the merchant grade phosphoric acid. These contaminants are then 
transferred to fertilizer, soil and eventually the food chain. Stringent regulations 
about contaminant levels, mainly uranium and cadmium, are currently pending 
approval in European Union countries. These regulations are delayed due to the 
lack of clean phosphate. A premium is likely to be paid in future for noxious 
contaminant-free phosphate source. Similar regulations are likely to be 
implemented  in other mature agriculture areas, such as North America.

20.11 Ilmenite by-product 
 
Ilmenite and rutile are the main sources of titanium, a low density, strong and corrosion 
resistant metal that is important in the aerospace industry. However, the chief use (94%) of 
titanium minerals is in the form of titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paints, plastics, 
rubber and paper. 
 

The "blanc de titane" world production is estimated at 3.8 
million tons per year. D'Arianne ilmenite (FeTiO4) 
concentrate is expected to grade about 46-47% TiO2. 
Annual production capacity by d'Arianne is expected to be 
about 1 million tons of ilmenite per year, or 460 000 tons 
TiO2 per year. This represents about 12% of world 

consumption, or more than half of the North American market. The bulk source of titanium 
is heavy sand, dominated by weathered ilmenite and pseudorutile, with TiO2 exceeding 
60%. It is amenable directly to the chlorine process, which is the preferred route. 
Unweathered ilmenite grades between 35% and 45% TiO2. It is not amenable to chlorine 
route. It either requires processing either by the sulphate route or upgrading by various 
processes. It's use is therefore more cost and capital intensive. 
 
Rio-Tinto Iron and Titanium, formerly QIT, is the largest ilmenite consumer in the world. 
Based in Sorel, Québec, this plant smelts DSO ilmenite into pig-iron and titanium-rich slag 
("Sorelslag" and "Upgraded slag"). The slag is sold to be processed using the chlorine 
route to produce blanc de Titane. Although RTIT is a large producer located near the 
d'Arianne project, RTIT cannot be targeted as market by d'Arianne. D'Arianne's ilmenite 
will be in the form of a powdery concentrate, and would need to be pelletized or sintered 
prior to smelting by the RTIT process. 

Annual production capacity 

by d'Arianne is expected to 

be about 1 million tons of 

ilmenite per year, or 460 000 

tons TiO2 per year.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

The price of ilmenite is around US$100 per ton. However, the author is sceptical that 
d'Arianne's anticipated volume can be sold completely. A thorough market review is 
needed prior to taking ilmenite into consideration in the economical assessment. Ilmenite 
cannot, for the moment, be considered as a co-product of the apatite concentrate, only as 
by-product. 
 
As ilmenite can be easily recovered from WHIMS, it is recommended that d'Arianne simply 
stock-pile it and sell it on the spot market when an opportunity presents itself. Titanium 
White production by d'Arianne may also be a future opportunity. Ilmenite revenues were 
not included in the current preliminary economic assessment. 
 
20.12 Magnetite and vanadium by-products 
 
It is estimated that nelsonite from the Paul zone contains as much magnetite as ilmenite or 
apatite. Magnetite recovery tests are currently being done and no results are available yet. 
There are no factual magnetite contents or magnetite assays currently available. Ore 
microscopy shows that the magnetite contains abundant ilmenite micro-exsolutions. This 
ilmenite cannot be separated by conventional beneficiation. Titanium contamination is 
expected up to 2-4% TiO2, rendering the magnetite unsuitable for most iron smelting and 
too low grade for titanium recovery. However, based on the author's experience, a 
vanadium grade of 0.8-1.2% V2O3 can be expected, which might make it suitable for 
vanadium recovery through an alkali roasting process. Some chromium credits are also 
expected. It is recommended to carry out Davis Tube testing and magnetite assaying in 
order to test such possibility. The magnetite can easily be recovered from the LIMS and 
stock piled at minimal cost. 
 
20.13 Copper, nickel and cobalt  
 
Form 1994 to 2004, Virginia Gold Mines and Soquem carried out exploration for nickel 
mineralisation in the vicinity of lac à Paul. The nickel, copper and cobalt mineralization, 
confirmed by ore petrography as pentlandite, chalcopyrite, cubanite and nickeliferous 
pyrrhotite, is disseminated or scattered as pods in peridotite and pyroxenite. These rock 
types are closely associated with the apatite-ilmenite bearing nelsonite. Therefore, some 
disseminated sulphide mineralization is associated in the apatite ore, although not yet 
quantified. If sulphides are present in sufficient amounts, they can be separated by 
floatation after the magnetic separation. This will likely produce a commercial copper-
nickel-cobalt concentrate while eliminating the acid generating minerals from the tailings. 
This will have to be evaluated in the course of metallurgical testing.

20.14 Scaling of Lac à Paul Project 
 
A production rate of 2 million tons of concentrate has been used for d'Arianne project:  
 

1. If Khibiny is excluded, all apatite mining operations are producing between 1 and 3 
million tons per year. 

2. 2 million tons per year seems to be realistic in terms of phosphoric acid plant 
operation. 

3. Actual resources in Paul zone are about 130 million tons, thus about 20 million tons 
of apatite. This allows a 10 year mining life, typical for starting mining projects. 

4. It is in the author opinion that the resources can be significantly enlarged, simply by 
deepening the pit and maintaining stripping ration below 1:1. A 20 years mining life 
for Paul zone alone is realistic. 

5. Production of such tonnage of concentrate will require mining 13 million tons per 
year, or about 37 000 tons per day. For comparison, it represents: 

a. Half the mining rate planned for Osisko's Malartic project. 
b. Twice the maximum mining rate obtained in Troïllus mine. 
c. Comparable to the various iron ore mining operations in Labrador. 

6. No significant economy is gained for a mining rate above 30 000 tons per day, due 
to limitation in equipment size. 

7. Expediting 2 million tons per year is realistic using the existing transport 
infrastructure. 

8. This production is comparable with the existing phosphate deficit in North America. 
9. This volume represents about 6% of the North American market. It is unlikely that it 

will destabilize the market. 
 
20.15 Transport logistic 
 
Initial arguments against Lac à Paul Project were its remoteness necessitating higher 
costs for shipping the concentrate to the closest railhead, seaport, or town. These costs 
have to be included in production costs, and may prove deleterious to project economics. 
Three alternatives were evaluated: trucking, slurry pipeline and rail to reach either a rail-
head (Dolbeau or Alma) or a seaport facility (St-Fulgence or Forestville) (figure 56). All 
capital and operation expenditures were imbedded in the economic model, adjusting to 
throughput, fuel cost, etc.

Figure 56: Shipment routes available to d'Arianne. Options 1 to 4 are either for trucking or 
pipeline construction. Option 1 is the current Chute-des-Passes road, which will have to be 
maintained anyhow in the event of pipeline or rail shipment. Map modified from a d'Arianne 
internal report (Tolarie and Neron, 2009). Option 1: Chute-des-Passes road to Dolbeau, 
Option 2: zec Onatcheway road to Alma, Option 3: Zec Martin-Valin road to St-Fulgence, 
Option 4: Labrieville road to Forestville, Option 5: Railway along the Péribonka River. 
 
 
20.16 Destinations 
 
Transport infrastructure will be dictated by the 
targeted market for the apatite concentrate. If 
d'Arianne chooses the western European or 
Florida markets, expedition to a sea port will be 
needed. If d'Arianne chooses the conterminous 
North American market, Idaho or Alberta 
phosphoric acid plants for example, rail shipment 
will be needed. Rail-to-vessel or vessel-to-rail reloading must be avoided. 

If d'Arianne chooses the western 

European or Florida markets, 

expedition to a sea port will be 

needed. If d'Arianne chooses the 

conterminous North American 

market, Idaho or Alberta 

phosphoric acid plants for 

example, rail shipment will be

Rail shipment will require construction of a private rail yard capable of handling 70 car 
block-trains (4 lines of 1.2 km long: in, out, waiting and escape), 10 000 cubic metre 
storage bins and its handling equipment, plus the spur line from rail yard to shortline 
railroad. Railheads are available in Dolbeau and Alma. Both face a similar difficulty; Both 
are located south of a large river, while the oversize trucks come from the north of the 
same river. For both locations, the construction of a bridge, if supported as part of the 
project, will be costly, likely the costliest item of the project. 
 
Ocean shipping will require the construction of a deep-sea port, capable of handling 
Handymax class vessels. Access to Grande-Anse or Powell sea-ports is not realistic, 
requiring routing through densely municipalized areas. Sea-port appropriate sites are 
L'Anse à Pelletier, 16 km east of St-Fulgence on the Saguenay Fjord, and Forestville on 
the St-Laurent Estuary. The St-Fulgence site is accessible by oversize truck through the 
Martin-Valin zec road. An off-shore pier will be needed for docking. Forestville is one of the 
few places along the St-Lawrence River where a deep-sea harbour can be built with 
conventional docks. It can be accessed via the Labrieville road. Both locations will require 
50 000 cubic metre dry storage silos (100 000 tons), plus various handling equipment, 
conveyors, etc. Construction costs for a port facility are estimated at $40M1. 
 
20.17 Oversize trucks 

 
The forestry industry uses oversize trucks in the Saguenay-
Lac-St-Jean area because logging areas are separated by 
hundreds of km from sawmills. These 10-14 feet wide 
oversize trucks ("Pacifiques", "Mastodontes", "Mégaloads") 
currently haul 150 ton charges in tandem trailers. Main 
forestry roads and bridges are constructed to support such 
charges. They can share the roads with general traffic, but 
are not allowed on public roads. The trucks are restricted to 

privately built but publicly owned roads, dedicated to their traffic. Similar trucking logistics 
can be used by d'Arianne: 
 

• Using 150 ton tandem trailers is realistic. Trailers can be overloaded, but not 
oversized.

• 75 tons, 30 feet long custom built covered hoppers will be required. Tractors for 
them are commercially available. 

• Speed limit is 45 km/h, necessitating about 10 hours per round-trip. A fleet of 17 
vehicles is needed, assuming 70% availability, at the cost of $600 000 a piece. 
 

• Road improvement will be needed for all of the alternatives, and a share of the road 
maintenance has to be assumed by d'Arianne. 

 
• Loading and unloading facilities, storage facilities at receiving end, and 

maintenance facilities were added. 
 

• A private rail yard is needed if railway expediting is retained. Similarly, a private 
seaport facility is needed if seaborne shipment is used. 

 
• These trucks are custom built for a single client. They will have to be bought and 

operated by d'Arianne. An initial investment of $31.2 million is required, including 
facilities (tables 21 and 22). 

 
• Transportation cost of $13.61/ton is calculated for the shortest route, from lac à 

Paul to Mistassini.

Four different routes are available for trucking: 
 
 
Lac à Paul to Mistassini: 

• Shortest distance, lowest investment, lowest operating cost. 
• 205 km one way. 
• Using a network of all-year maintained forestry roads: Manouane road, Chutes-

des-Passes road, Brûle-Neige road, Petite Péribonka road. 
• Limited road upgrading is required, likely about 40 km from Chutes-des-Passes to 

the project. Two bridges to be upgraded (Serpentine and Petite-Péribonka rivers). 
• Unloading facilities in the projected Mistassini industrial park. 

o Using Mistassini as a terminal requires the construction of a rail spur from 
the Bowater paper mill, on the south shore of Mistassini River, to the 
industrial park across the river. This project is currently undergoing 
feasibility studies by the regional municipality (MRC Maria-Chapdelaine). 
Bridge construction is estimated at $30 million. 

o The absence of a rail bridge across the Mistassini River requires the 
building of a terminal in l'Afrique, on the south side of Dolbeau. This will add 
about 40 km to the distance, plus bridges across the Mistassini, Mistassibi 
and aux Rats rivers. This will add substantially to the initial outlay and 
eventual operating costs, likely making Dolbeau a less attractive choice. 

• Total capital expenditures are estimated at $31 million, with an operating cost of 
$13.61 per ton.

Lac à Paul to Alma: 
 

• Considered as second best option. 
• 232 km, one way. 
• Uses a poorly-maintained gravel road network over 182 km through the 

Onatcheway ZEC and reservoir. 
• The gravel road will require upgrading, estimated at $27 million. 
• A 50 kilometre private road will have to be built from Onatcheway Reservoir to 

Alma. 
• A private bridge will have to be built to allow the crossing of the Grande Décharge 

(Saguenay River). Construction costs of such a bridge (400 m span, 30 m high) are 
poorly constrained, but likely in excess of $15 million. 

• Unloading facility and rail yard have to be built on the east side of Alma, on Isle 
Maligne, an area devoid of municipal infrastructures, but still close to residential 
areas. 

• Total capital expenditures are estimated at $74 million, with an operating cost of 
$15.59 per ton. 

 
Lac à Paul to St-Fulgence: 
 

• Not studied in detail, needed only if ocean shipping is retained. 
• 210 km, one way. 
• Major road upgrading and construction would cost in excess of $30 million. 

 
Lac à Paul to Forestville 

• Not studied in detail, needed only if ocean shipping is considered. 
• 222 km, one way. 
• About 50 km of road to be built, plus 50 km to be upgraded. 
• About 80 km on paved highway (Labrieville to Forestville). Right of way to be 

negotiated with Québec Department of Transport. If not granted, construction will 
be required. 

• Crossing of a small urban area. Might not be socially acceptable. 
 
20.18 Slurry pipeline 
 
The use of slurry pipelines is gaining more and more 
acceptance in the mining industry, even in northern 
climates. D'Arianne requested an estimate from Pipeline 
System Incorporated (PSI, Mackowiak, 2009) for the 
construction and operation cost of a pipeline from lac à 
Paul to the Saguenay River (Chicoutimi). Configurations 
were:

• 231 km. 
• 1 million tons per year of apatite, plus 0.5 million tons per year of ilmenite, in batch 

operation. 
• 8" OD steel pipe. 
• 2 piston diaphragm pumps at the mine site, plus tanks, etc. 
• 2 intermediate pumps, at km 77 and km 154, powered by diesel generator. 
• Diesel pipeline, 4" OD steel pipe. 
• All the ancillary equipment, tanks, agitator, Scada, communications, etc. 
• Construction cost: $232 450 000. 
• Operating cost: $20 676 000 per year, or $13.78/ton. 

 
This estimate suggests an operating cost higher than for trucking, on top of the enormous 
construction cost. The bulk (>70%) of operating cost is electrical power for the pumps. The 
author in collaboration with PSI reviewed this estimate: 
 
Power requirements are dictated by fluid rheology. This can be diminished by either 
reducing the slurry's viscosity, which may cause settling, or increasing the pipe diameter 
(lower volume/surface shear strength). Increasing the pipe diameter will increase the pipe 
cost (a direct function of diameter and steel requirement) but does not increase 
construction costs significantly. Using a 14" OD steel pipe will likely reduce shear strength 
sufficiently to no longer need auxiliary on-line pumps, cutting power consumption by 70%. 
Energy costs were adjusted to Hydro-Québec's G-rates. The revised cost estimate to build 
and operate a slurry pipeline from lac à Paul to Dolbeau is indicated in table 23, and 
comparison between different destinations in table 24. The costs presented here were 
compared with various other slurry pipelines (Martison Phoscan), Kémag and Labmag 
(New Millenium) and seem realistic

The operating costs for the various options are very similar regardless of pipeline length. 
Seaport handling costs include boat loading, which is usually included in shipping costs. 
Reducing slurry velocity shall be avoided since it may cause settling. Using a larger 
diameter pipe implies larger throughput. In fact, a 14-16" pipeline can handle more than 
10 million tons per year throughput, 5 times d'Arianne's production. Batch operation will be 
required, with appropriate storage and handling capacity. 
 
Freezing of the pipeline is frequently raised as an issue for winter operation. New 
Millenium pipeline design, carried out by Brass Engineering International LLC, presented a 
detailed study where they proposed some preventive steps to be taken. If these 
suggestions are followed, they calculated that the slurry can withstand a temporary stall up 
to 8 days without freezing. The following precautions were included in design and cost 
evaluation: 
 

• To insulate the pipe with 1" polyurethane foam coating. 
• To bury the pipe at a depth of 1-1.5 metres. 
• To keep the pipeline running with water between batches. 
• To flood the pipe with glycol in case of protracted emergency stall. 

 
A residual risk related to pipeline freezing will always be present in such operations. 
Freezing of the pipe would stall shipments until the following spring, which can be 
judiciable to d'Arianne. 
 
Shipping the concentrate with the use of a pipeline is about 60% of the trucking costs, or 
about $5 per ton. But considering the large initial investment and the forecast of 
d'Arianne's tonnage, a 14 year payback time is estimated. At the current tonnage, pipeline 
construction is not considered profitable. At least twice the tonnage would be required. 
 
20.19 Rail 
 
Construction of a private railway has been briefly evaluated (the author had various 
discussion with Canarail Consultants Inc. on this issue). Railway construction is not usually 
considered profitable for shipping less than 5 million tons per year, considering the large 
capital investment needed. However, in the event that rail shipment from Dolbeau to North 
American destinations is retained, the construction of a short line to the deposit shall be 
evaluated. 
 
From the Canadian National Railway website, cost increase for hauling over a 
supplementary 200 km of shortline railway is estimated at approximately $5 per ton. Rail

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

construction across the rugged Canadian Shield is roughly estimated at $2 million per 
kilometre (standard gauge, 120 lb/yard, welded continuous single track rail): 
 

• Earthwork, 50.000 m3 per kilometre at $20/m3:  $1 000 000/km. 
• Railbed and formation: 10.000 m3 per kilometre at $50/m3: $500 000/km 
• Steelwork: 120 t/km at $500/ton, plus $50/tie, 2000 ties/km, x2 for 

installation, about $500 000/km 
 
A likely suitable route was identified along the Péribonka River for a total distance of 
190 km to Alma, or 200 km to Dolbeau. A major bridge has to be built along both routes: 
either across the Grande Décharge near Alma, or across the Péribonka River to Dolbeau. 
Construction costs are expected in excess of $400 million. Compared to trucking, rail 
haulage brings an operational savings of about $8/ton (60%), and will require minimum 5 
million tons of production per year for a 10 year payback. 
 
Being connected to the national network, the rail line would require a general carrier 
licence. Some traffic can be expected from the logging industry. 
 
20.20 Conclusions regarding transport logistics 
 

With the current scope of producing 2 million tons per year, 
the trucking option is recommended to d'Arianne. A 
significant increase in resource base and a much larger 
mining operation are needed to consider other transport 
options. 

 
It should be noted that tucking is the least acceptable option with respect to social and 
environmental impact. Trucking the concentrate consumes about 3.2 litres of fuel per ton, 
producing 12 kilograms of carbon dioxide, or 1% of the shipped weight. It is estimated that 
40 truckloads per day will be needed; making 80 trips both ways, plus workers, fuel and 
supply vehicles. Such an increase in traffic, added to logging and other activities, will 
cause an increase in dust, noise, road maintenance and collision with wildlife, along with 
safety issues for smaller vehicles. Since the Chute-des-Passes road is heavily travelled by 
local people for fishing, hunting, cabins, etc, the increase in traffic must be studied. Also to 
be considered are the approximately 100 local jobs needed to keep the fleet running. A 
thorough impact assessment is needed. 
 
 
 

With the current scope of 

producing 2 million tons per 

year, the trucking option is 

recommended to d'Arianne.

20.21 Mine site preparation 
 
Investment is needed, exclusive to mining site and mill constructions. These are listed in 
table 25. Notice the inclusion of the feasibility study, which is roughly estimated at 
$8 000 000, based on the author's experience. Also included is the rehabilitation fund, left 
in trust with the government to obtain mining licence.

20.22 Mining operations 
 
Since estimated resources are only categorized as indicated and inferred, it is the author's 
opinion that it is too early to provide an elaborate mining plan. A more accurate resource 
qualification is needed prior to it. 
 
In order to produce about 2 million tons of apatite concentrate per year, 10.5 million tons 
per year need to be mined or 32 835 tons per day. 
 
The Paul zone can be seen as an oblong body, 1000 metres in length and 150-350 metres 
wide. About 35 million tons can be extracted in an open pit without mining the wall rock, or 
3.5 years. An 8.5 year mining operation will require an ultimate pit 1.6 km long, 600 metres 
wide and 300 metres deep, with an overall 1:1 strip ratio and 100% slope. 
 
The fleet of equipment needed to operate such mine has been established by comparing 
with similar mines. The following estimates are provided as a guideline only. Sizing of 
mining equipment is outside the usual field of expertise of the author, and a significant 
margin of error is attached to this evaluation. Pricing and operation costs were established

tons each, and a 30 m3 hydraulic shovel shall be sufficient as long as no wall rock needs to 
be removed. This fleet is doubled once a 1:1 strip ratio is needed. Mining cost is 
established at C$4.64 per ton, either ore or waste.

20.23 Mill operation 
 
A milling and beneficiation plant will be needed near the mining site. Milling circuit requires 
a primary gyratory crusher, conveyor, 34' semi-autogenous mill, screening, and terminal 
rod-mill. The beneficiation circuit is quite simple, using spirals, low intensity magnetic 
separator, wet high intensity magnetic separator and rougher plus cleaner flotation 
columns, plus ancillary equipment. Rotary drum filters and a dryer will be required; either 
at the mine site or at the pipeline destination, items that are costly to operate. Capital 
investment and operating costs, as extracted from Mine and Mill Equipment Cost 
Estimator's Guide, published by Infomine USA Inc, converted to Canadian dollars and are 
listed in table 27.

20.26 Taxation and NSR 
 
A residual 1% NSR is attached to the cells in which Paul zone is located. Although this 
NSR can be bought back by d'Arianne for 1 million dollars, it has been considered in the 
cash-flow model, and subtracted from revenues. It will be more profitable to d'Arianne to 
buy the NSR and add the cost to the Capex. 
 
Taxation is usually not taken into account in a cash-flow model, being too complex to 
implement. A brief attempt is made, assuming the project as a stand-alone fiscal entity and 
not a subsidiary of a larger entity. 
 

Taxation in Québec1 and Canada is based upon net profits, 
12% for provincial plus 8% for federal. There is no per-ton 
or per-value royalty to be paid to the government. A 
provincial mining tax is applied in-lieu of royalty, equalling 
14% of the profits, and assuming the project is not vertically 

integrated2. These add up to 32% of profits. Municipal taxes were not evaluated. 
 
Various allowances are available for mining operations, which can be deducted from 
mining revenues. First is an accelerated fiscal depreciation of the investment: up to 100% 
of the residual value in a single year. This allows the cost of investment to be applied 
against profits for the first years, postponing tax payment. This also has the effect that 

                                                 
1 Provincial mining taxation regime is expected to be reviewed in the coming year. 
Its terms are not fully evaluated. 
2 According to such taxation system, if d'Arianne is integrated into phosphoric acid 
production, the apatite selling price shall be balanced with production cost. So 
profits are deferred to the phosphoric acid plant, where mining tax does not apply. 

Pre-tax: 20.80% $612M $439M 
Post mining tax: 19.41% $540M $384M

fiscal depreciation and profits diverge from accounting depreciation and profits. In the 
financial model, this allowance has been applied in order to leave sufficient profits to cover 
the re-investments needed. 
 
A second allowance is applicable if the ore is processed in Québec, corresponding to 8% 
of the mill value. It is uncertain to the author if this allowance applies against initial or 
residual mill value, and if beneficiation of the ore is sufficient or phosphoric acid conversion 
is needed. 
 
Rate of returns and net present value were calculated for both pre-tax and post-tax 
scenarios, as well as if only mining tax is applied. 
 
20.27 Other production rates 
 
The financial model was run for 1 million tons and 5 million tons per year apatite 
production capacity, assuming enough resources are available for 20 years of production1. 
For such, equipment was resized and capital expenditures plus operating costs were 
estimated2 and listed in table 29. Grade used were from previous estimate, the difference 
being considered as marginal compared to other uncertainties.  It can be seen that a 
production rate of 1 million ton of apatite per year, similar to Phoscan's Martinson project, 
is not viable. Inversely, no significant improvement in profitability is gained by increasing 
mining rate to 5 million tons of apatite per year, assuming sufficient resources are 
available. 
 
Using the 5 million tons per year scenario, transportation of concentrate by pipeline is 
viable and the most profitable option (figure 58). Rail construction up to the mine is also 
profitable, but significantly less than the pipeline. Further increase in production rate would 
be needed to justify rail construction, likely 10 million tons of concentrate per year.  

                                                 
1 Which is not currently the case. 
2 Estimations at various production rates necessitate re-estimation of all equipment 
and operation costs, which is a tedious process. The current estimations were taken 
from the previous report, and not updated with currently estimated grades. 
Discrepancies are not considered significant compared the differences between 
various scenarios. However, precision on these estimates are approximate and 
some elements might not be realistic.

20.28 Sensitivity analysis 
 
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out, using the financial model and varying the 
different input parameters. Rather than using the conventional percentage variation, the 
model has been run using rounded increments realistic with respect to operation or 
markets. Variations in IRR and DNPV are not a linear function of the various input 
parameters, due to some non-linear functions (ex.: interest), some incremental/decisional 
functions (ex.: investment needed once wall-rock needs to be removed), complex 
interactions between parameters (ex. trucking costs per ton is a function of tonnage) as 
well as caused by retroactive loops (ex.: fiscal depreciation). The mill and mine size, and 
therefore their capital expenditures, were kept constant, except where indicated. 
 
20.29 Sensitivity of grade 
 
The IRR and DNPV vary almost linearly with grade. IRR decreases by 3.5% for each % 
grade of apatite lost (0.39% P2O5). While SGS Canada indicated 20.1% apatite in the 
deposit, a drop to 18% (7% P2O5) would make the project marginal, and no profitability 
could be obtained at 16% apatite (6.2% P2O5). The project will be sensitive to mining 
model, cut-off grade, and assaying precision. Mine and mill design will have to be carefully 
balanced with available grade. The effect of recovery will be very similar. 
 
Based on the financial model (figure 59), it is not realistic to attempt starting  production in 
the Manouane zone, even less in zone 2.

apatite. 
 
 
20.30 Sensitivity to tonnage 
 
Tonnage is apparently the most sensitive variable on the model, assuming a constant 
mine-mill capacity regardless of available resources (figure 60). NPV and IRR is 
calculated on cumulative profits once the investments are paid; the last years of operation 
being the most profitable. The project offers a marginal profitability at 100 million tons and 
generates no profits at 92 million tons. This clearly indicates that d'Arianne shall dedicate 
efforts to increase its resource base, without declining the average grade. The effect of 
bringing Manouane zone into production once Paul zone is exhausted, with lower grade 
and higher production cost, has not been calculated.

Figure 60: Sensitivity of the financial model to estimated tonnage with a constant 
1,92 mt/y production rate. It is suggested that only a slight drop in tonnage may ruin the 
profitability. SGS Canada indicated 136 million tons of indicated plus inferred resources. It 
is in the author opinion that supplementary tonnage can be outlined with sufficient drilling 
effort. 
 
 
20.31 Effect of cut-off grade at the mine 
 
SGS-Géostat provided resource estimates using different cut-off grades. Using 6% P2O5 
cut-off compared to 0% merely decreases tonnage by 20%1. However, tonnage drops 
dramatically above 6%, falling by 75% at 8% P2O5. The financial model has been run using 

                                                 
1 Tonnage and grades reported by SGS Canada using 0% and 2% P2O5 are near 
identical, which indicates the estimated volume is not constrained. The low-grade 
tonnage might have been biased considering that core without sufficient apatite 
(<2%) has not been assayed. Since the base case scenario uses 2% cut-off, the 
impact of this situation can be non-negligible. Theoretically, tonnage at 0% cut-off is 
equivalent of the volume defined by all drill holes and shall be considered as open 
on any direction. Can a similar assumption been made for 2% cut-off grade? Since 
the base case scenario use 2% cut-off, the impact can be non-negligible.

with increasing grade is detrimental to the economics of the project if a cut-off grade is 
used above 4% P2O5, or 10% apatite.

The effect of the international pricing of Moroccan phosphate rocks is intuitive, and shows 
a direct relation to profitability. The base case scenario was calculated using the historical 
US$50 per ton, FOB Casablanca, which is a very conservative assumption (figure 62). 
British Sulfur Consultants suggest US$70 per ton as realistic future pricing. The project is 
calculated to reach a zero profitability assuming price drop to US$17 per ton. The effect of 
trans-Atlantic shipment costs is cumulative to Casablanca selling price, and their effect, 
dollar to dollar, will be identical. However, they are characterized by volatility and are less

20.33 Effect of capital expenditures 
 
The internal rate of return being a function of the profit versus the investment, IRR shows 
an inverse relationship with capital expenditures (figure 63). Increasing these investments 
by 50% still allows a 13% IRR, suggesting robustness of the project to misevaluation in 
required capital.

Operating costs, including mining, milling and shipping to Dolbeau are subtracted directly 
from revenues. They therefore have a similar effect as selling price, inversely affecting IRR 
and NPV with an almost linear effect (figure 64). Reducing operating costs significantly is 
a difficult task, and optimization of expediting cost can be more effective.

Figure 64: The sensitivity of the financial model to the operating costs suggests some 
robustness of this model. Increasing revenues rather than reducing expenses, will yield 
better results. 
 
 
20.35 Effect of inflation 
 
Inflation affects both the revenues and the operating costs, but not the initial investment. 
Therefore, the expenses/capital or revenue/capital ratio increases with time and inflation. 
But if the initial investment is discounted to compensate for inflation, the IRR is near 
constant. This assumes that selling price and operation costs are equally affected by 
inflation, which is unlikely. The overall trend is that commodity prices are affected by 
deflation. The main drive behind inflation is likely the cost of fuel, which accounts for about 
30% of all operating costs. The discounted rate on NPV is set at 3% above inflation 
(figure 65). Effect of inflation between the study and the start-up is equivalent to an 
increase in capital expenditure. Base case scenario involves no inflation.

20.36 Currency fluctuation 
 
The Canadian Dollar has been fluctuating significantly with respect to the American Dollar 
in the last two decades. The Canadian Dollar has been departing from its optimal US$0.90 
value to wander between US$0.63 to US$1.10. As a consequence of the 2008 financial 
crisis, the US Dollar is declining in value compared to most currencies, including its 
Canadian counterpart. Currency fluctuation is considered as not affecting construction 
costs (taken into account in Capex variations), but does affect production costs and 
revenues. About 50-60% of the operating costs are affected by currency, namely fuel, 
equipment and parts, but not salaries and electricity. Inversely, reference phosphate prices 
are quoted in US dollars. Modelling the currency fluctuation suggests a very limited effect 
on the project's cash-flow (figure 66). Base case scenario was calculated at US$0.939 
dollar per Canadian dollar.

20.37 Comparison with Phoscan's Martison project 
 
Phoscan Chemical Corporation, a junior mining company traded on the TSX since 
February 2009, is currently developing an integrated phosphate project: from the mine to 
fertilizer production. A positive project pre-feasibility, including a detailed market study and 
environmental impact assessment, is completed (table 30). A full feasibility study is 
currently under way. Road construction and land purchase are completed. 
 
The Martison deposit is an apatite-rich zone hosted in the Martison carbonatite complex, 
about 70 km north of Hearst, Northern Ontario. The phosphatic residuum of these 
weathered carbonatites constitutes the bulk of the mineralization. Resources are currently 
estimated at: 
 

1. Measured and indicated resources: 62.2 million tons at 23.55% P2O5, for 37 million 
tons of apatite. 

2. Inferred resources: 55.7 million tons at 21.87% P2O5, for 21 million tons of apatite.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

The apatite is expected to be mined in order to produce 1 million tons of apatite 
concentrate per year, grading 37% P2O5. The concentrate will be shipped by pipeline 
(86 km) to Hearst to be converted into wet process phosphoric acid, either merchant grade 
(MGA; 461.000 tons per annum) or superphosphoric acid (SPA. 213 000 tons per annum). 
This phosphoric acid is to be shipped by rail to Brandon, Manitoba, to be converted mostly 
to MAP (mono-ammonium phosphate, 474 000 tons per annum) or to superphosphate. 
Fertilizers are expected to be sold to grain growers in the midwest of the United States and 
in the Canadian Prairies. 
 
Phoscan's economic assessment is based on a phosphate rock selling price of $40/ton 
and a 20 year mining life. Since the project is integrated with phosphoric acid production, 
mining costs and profitability is not available for apatite production only, therefore direct 
comparison with d'Arianne is not possible. 
 
Phoscan will produce an apatite concentrate grading about 37.2% P2O5. This concentrate 
(81 BPL) is better quality than Moroccan phosphate, but is slightly lower grade than 
expected concentrates from d'Arianne. Contaminant levels are not indicated, but are likely 
dominated by carbonates. 
 
Contrary to d'Arianne, the Phoscan project targets the fertilizer market directly. The volume 
of apatite, about 1 million tons per year, is well under the current North American deficit, 
and shall not have significant impact on the overall North American market. Development 
of Phoscan project shall not be considered as a treat to d'Arianne. However, in the event 
d'Arianne decides to produce phosphoric acid, Phoscan will be competing for access to 
the limited sulphuric acid supply.

20.38 Comparison to Soquem's Sept-Îles Project 
 
Soquem, a SGF subsidiary and Québec's crown corporation, has been working for years 
to develop the Sept-Îles apatite deposit. This deposit shows several similarities with 
d'Arianne. It is nelsonite hosted in a gabbroic-anorthositic complex. The deposit is located 
near the town of Sept-Îles, on the north shore of the St-Laurence, in close proximity to 
Arnaud railway4 and the Sept-Îles seaport. However, what may look as an advantage 
might be detrimental to the project: not having direct access to the North American rail 
network. In this venture, Soquem is in 50-50 partnership with Yara International ASA, a 
Norwegian fertilizer producer dedicated to the European market. Full feasibility and 
environmental impact studies were completed in 1997 (table 30). The project was 
considered as profitable with the sale of ilmenite and magnetite as co-product. The project 
was halted for years due to undisclosed reasons. But apparently, it has been recently 
reactivated (N. Tollari, personal communication). It is clear to the author that its apatite 
production is dedicated to the European market, and that the need to maintain a 
co-production of ilmenite concentrate is likely considered a hindrance by Yara.

20.39 General comparison with other open-pit mines 
 
A brief survey of Canadian open-pit operations (data taken from Canadian-American 
Mines Handbook, 2008 and various feasibility studies) indicates that, regardless of the 
commodity and throughputs, no mines operate with an in-situ ore value less than C$18 per 
ton. With concentrate sold at 118$ per ton, minus the mine-Dolbeau shipping costs, 
d'Arianne in-situ value is estimated at $16.23 per ton. Such value is lower than the  
Osisko's Malartic and comparable to Highland Valley's porphyry copper (figure 67), both 
of which are significantly larger than d'Arianne's project. D'Arianne low ore value must then 
be compensated by low operation cost.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

ITEM 21: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
According to the financial model developed for the Lac à Paul Project, and based on 
resource estimates provided by SGS Canada Inc. about the Paul zone, it is considered 
that the current project is likely to be profitable as long as the apatite concentrate is sold 
above C$100 per ton. The model indicates the following internal rates of return depending 
on selling price (table 31). The FOB price in Dolbeau is estimated to the same as the 
Moroccan phosphate price plus 65$/ton for its trans-Atlantic shipping, port-to-rail handling 
plus rail shipping without premium for higher BPL%: 
 
 
Table 31: Internal rate of return with respect to selling prices 
FOB Casablanca 72%BPL FOB Dolbeau 90% BPL IRR
US$30/ton C$97/ton  7.23%
US$40/ton C$107/ton 14.66%
US$50/ton C$118/ton 20.80%
US$70/ton C$139/ton 31.23%
US$100/ton C$159/ton 44.66%
 
 
The base case was calculated at US$50/ton for the Moroccan phosphate, which is 
underestimated according to British Sulphur Consultants. However, uncertainties remain 
with respect to trans-Atlantic shipment costs. 
 
D'Arianne can anticipate filling the North American phosphate production deficit. Two 
phosphoric acid plants located in conterminous North America are likely to lack phosphate-
rock feed in the near future: Agrium plant in Soda Spring, Idaho, and Agrium plant in Red 
River, Alberta. These should be targeted by d'Arianne because lac à Paul can be delivered 
to these plants at competitive prices compared to Morrocan phosphate. On the other hand, 
d'Arianne has a disadvantage compared to Moroccan phosphate in the Florida plants 
because of the $40 per ton rail shipping cost. Finally, d'Arianne may also be competitive 
on the western European market, which is currently provisioned by Russian apatite 
concentrate. 
 
The Lac à Paul Project envisions producing 2 million tons of apatite per year. A smaller 
project is unlikely to be economically viable. The current 136 million tons of resources in 
the Paul zone allows for a short, 11 years of production. D'Arianne will have to improve its

ITEM 22: RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
In order to bring the Lac à Paul Project into prefeasibility, d'Arianne will have to  
 
1) improve its resource base; 
2) demonstrate the efficiency of the metallurgical process; 
3) address the market situation in detail. 
 
A budget is provided in table 23 based on the author's experience, details are to be 
elaborated later. 
 
22.1 Resource improvement 
 
A drilling campaign has just been carried out in the Paul zone, which allows improving the 
resource from inferred to indicated. The drilling pattern, used by SGS-Canada Inc. for the 
current estimate, was irregular with drill fences every 100 metres for the indicated portion 
of the resources. Added drilling also allowed to increase total tonnage to 136 Mt, a 35% 
increase. 
 
However, tonnage still has to be enlarged, hopefully doubled. This can be achieved by 
deepening the zone to 200-250 metres, by completing sections, by adding section to the 
East and West, and by extending laterally some of the sections. For example, sections 
7+00W to 4+00W were tested with a single vertical hole, which intersected up to 160 
meters of ore-grade nelsonite. Along with resource-oriented drilling, the parameters of the 
rock mechanics will have to be measured, as well as some geotechnical holes drilled to 
determine pit stability, to perform water pumping test. Mill site decommission holes will 
also be needed. A rough estimate of 15 000 metres of drilling will be needed, for $3 million 
budget. This has to be carried prior to initiate definition drilling at 50 metres spacing to 
enable estimation of measured resources. 
 
22.2 Resource estimation update 
 
Results from the drilling will have to be included in the database and a new resource 
estimates calculated. This resource calculation shall include a block model ready to be 
integrated into Whittle pit design software, and the resource model to be integrated with 
the production cost model. A budget of $100 000 is needed.

The Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite Project, NI-43-101 Compliant Technical Report 

22.3 Geotechnical study 
 
Geotechnical study, including slope stability and hydrogeology will have to be implemented 
along with the resource drilling. A budget of $100 000 will be needed. 
 
22.4 Metallurgical testing 
 
All metallurgical testing carried out up to now has been limited bench-scale testing. More 
bench-scale testing will be required to improve the flotation recipe, the milling circuit and 
power requirements, as well as to test recoveries for ilmenite and sulphides. The next step 
will be a pilot plant test, using approximately 50 tons of bulk sample. The pilot plant test 
should produce enough apatite concentrate to be sent to different phosphoric acid 
producers who will test its suitability in their process. A $2 million dollar budget shall be 
allocated. 
 
22.5 Baseline environmental characterization 
 
Environmental characterization of the project site will have to be carried out prior to 
causing severe disturbance to the site. The environmental study shall be started as soon 
as possible, with a $250 000 budget. 
 
22.6 Market assessment 
 
The phosphate market situation, including all transport issues, is a key element of this 
project. A detailed market assessment will have to be contracted to a specialized and 
reputed firm, such as Secor or British Sulphur Consultant. Such a study is expected to cost 
in the order of $500 000. 
 
This total investment of nearly $6 million is a prerequisite prior to bring the project into 
prefeasibility. The author formally recommends pursuing the investment considering the 
project has reasonable chances of being economically viable (table 32).
