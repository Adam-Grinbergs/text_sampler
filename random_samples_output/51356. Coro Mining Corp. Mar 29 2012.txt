Coro is a public company whose stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

Propipe understands that it is Coro's intent to use this Report to complete an 

assessment of the feasibility of the project. 

San Jorge Property was previously reviewed by AMEC in 2003 for Lumina Copper 

Corporation (Lumina) and in 2006 and 2007, for Coro. NCL Ingeniería y Construcción 

(NCL) also reported an update of AMEC 2007 report in February 2008.   

In May 2008 Ausenco reported, based on NCL´s 2008 report, a resource model that 

included a new geological model and mineral resource estimate using data available 

up to October 23rd, 2007. This Technical Report, prepared by Propipe, considers and 

revises mining, geotechnical, hydrological and hydrogeological studies, metallurgical 

test work, plant and infrastructure preliminary design and capital and operational cost 

estimation that were reported by Ausenco in their NI43-101 Prefeasibility Standard 

Study Report of May 2008.  

The San Jorge Property is located in west-central Argentina approximately 110 km 

northwest of the provincial city of Mendoza and 250 km northeast of Santiago, Chile. 

Copper mineralization was first recognized on the San Jorge property in the early 

1960s. The Property comprises 2 separate areas consisting of a combined 10 Mining 

Concessions and 54 Mining Estacas (Section 4.2) that are owned by Global Copper 

Corporation (Global) and which are optioned to Coro. These concessions and estacas 

cover a total of 10,500 hectares. 

On August 10th 2006, Coro entered into an agreement with Global to acquire a 100% 

interest in the San Jorge Property.

In June 2008, a NI43-101 compliant Preliminary Assessment technical report was 

completed by Minproc for processing, via conventional flotation and concentration 

methods, 10 million tons per year of San Jorge enriched and primary ores. The 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process started in September of the same 

year and finished in February 2011 with the provincial government EIA granting 

approval of the EIA; however, its ratification was rejected by the lower chamber of the 

Provincial Legislature in August 2011, as a result of intense pressure from 

environmental groups during the 2011 elections. 

This Technical Report is based on the outcomes of an engineering study completed in 

2008 by Ausenco, and revised and updated by Propipe in 2011 to pre-feasibility study. 

The Propipe Technical Report includes the resources, open pit mine plan, operating 

and capital costs and financial analysis for the leach project which describes the

production of up 55 million lbs per year of copper cathode for a period of 10 years. It is 

a comprehensive study of the viability of the project that has advanced to a stage 

where the mining method has been established and an effective method of mineral 

processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based on 

reasonable assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, 

and environmental factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors which are 

sufficient to determine if all or part of the mineral resource may be classified as a 

mineral reserve; however, due to current legislation in the Province of Mendoza which 

prohibits the use sulfuric acid, which is required in heap leaching of copper ore, and 

according to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Coro was unable to 

quote mineral reserves for the Project. In an effort to resolve the ban on use of sulfuric 

acid in Mendoza, this study report shows that a  potentially viable project can be 

achieved by a constructing an SXEW heap leach plant outside of Mendoza at a 

distance of 22 km in the pro-mining province of San Juan. Several mines such as 

Intrepid Mines Casposo, Yamana Gold´s Gualcamayo, and Barrick´s Veladero are in 

production in San Juan, and some giant projects are in development such as Barrick´s 

Pascua Lama and Xtrata´s Pachón. Coro and Propipe have received a legal opinion 

that there should be no legal impediment to the transport of the ore between Mendoza 

and San Juan; and as a result, this study qualifies as a preliminary feasibility study as 

CIM standard defined in National Instrument 43-101. 

All references to $ in this Technical Report are references to US$. 

1.2 HIGHLIGHTS 

The primary assessment criterion of project viability was determined by specific 

calculations of the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) using 

project cash flows and Base Case at a constant 2.80 $/lb copper price over the life of 

mine. The following summarize the outcomes of this report: 

• Measured and Indicated Resources of oxide and enriched material of 58 

million tonnes at 0.59%CuT containing 342,600 tonnes (750 million lbs) of

1.3 MINERAL RESOURCES 

San Jorge is a mid-sized porphyry copper gold deposit, containing oxide, enriched, 

and primary mineralization. Resources types are: Oxide material, which can only be 

processed by heap leach methods; Enriched material, which could be processed by 

heap leach or flotation; and Primary material which can only be processed by flotation 

methods.

The gold and the Primary resources would not be recoverable in the Leach Project, 

and, therefore, only the leachable oxide and enriched copper resources within an 

economic envelope of 1.50 $/lb copper are shown in Table 1.3.

1.4 MINING, PROCESSING AND PRODUCTION PLAN 

The Leach Project is based on an open pit mine to extract oxide and enriched 

material, which will be transported to San Juan for their processing by heap leach 

methods, (including bacterial leaching for the enriched material) and recovery of 

cathode copper via solvent extraction and electro-winning (SX/EW) together with an 

on-site sulfur burning acid plant. Overall mineral reserves are 48.4 million tones, with 

an average grade of 0.61% CuT of which 55% is oxide and 45% is enriched. The 

Inferred resources were considered as waste. 

The mine plan was driven by two factors. Firstly, to process up to a maximum of 6.3 

million tons per year in the crushing plant; and secondly, to minimize the overall strip 

ratio especially in the early years. This plan to place a total of 48.4 million tons of 

oxide and enriched ore on to heap leach pads to prepare a processing plan for the 

production of up to 25 000 tons per year of copper cathodes during the LOM is set out 

in Table 1.4.

CORO MINING CORPORATION TECHNICAL REPORT

PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY STUDY  P502-G-INF-001

SAN JORGE 25kt/y COPPER LEACH PROJECT IN SAN JUAN PROVINCE, 

ARGENTINA 
REV. 0

 

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 41 OF 461 

The overall LOM strip ratio is relatively low at 0.77:1. The strip ratio peaks at 1.65 in 

the fifth year with a minimum strip ratio of 0.25 in year eight. 

All aspects related to mining and mine planning in the current study correspond to an 

unchanged version of the work carried out by NCL Ingenieria y Construccion Ltda in 

the context of the Technical Report developed by Ausenco in May 2008. 

Since Ausenco´s Prefeasibility Study was published in May 2008, the economic 

parameters concerning operating costs and copper price have changed significantly. 

The operating costs have increased due to escalation of labour cost, diesel, power, 

consumables and materials, plus the additional transport cost resulting of the currently 

proposed location of the process plant 22 km away from the mine. At the same time, 

the copper prices have also increased significantly, compensating the upward trend of 

the operating cost. 

The technical parameters of the project remained unchanged compared to Ausenco´s 

Study, except for the location of the Heap Leach operation which has been moved 

22km away from the mine, as mentioned above.  

 Due to the above changes on the economic parameters, NCL carried out an analysis 

of the validity of the open pit design and mine plan reported in Ausenco´s May 2008 

Study, and concluded that all those elements are valid under the conditions of the 

current study. The main conclusions of the analysis is that the increases on the 

operating costs are offset by the increase on the copper price, to the extent that the 

selected pit from a whittle exercise run using the current parameters is virtually 

identical to the pit selected on the 2008 Study 

The selected sequence preferentially extracted oxide ore early in the mine life, 

delaying the mining and processing of the enriched ore which had slower leach 

kinetics, as well as deferring project capital. The production plan contains 223,400 

tons of recoverable copper cathode. 

A total of seventeen 4 & 6 m column tests were completed at SGS Laboratories, 

Santiago, Chile in 2008. The metallurgical parameters were validated by Propipe from 

a diffusion controlled leaching model developed by Ausenco in 2008. That model used

a scale-up factor of 1.5 and derivation of the projected leach cycle of 115 days for 

oxides and 150 days for enriched, average acid consumptions of 26.1 kg/t for oxides 

and 18.3 kg/t for enriched, and recoveries of 85% of total copper for oxides and 66.3% 

of total copper for enriched. 

Operating cost estimates were updated by Propipe and reflect the market 

environment in Argentina (Q4 2011) for owner mining, crushing, agglomeration, 

transport and stacking of ore, acid production from a sulfur burning acid plant, cathode 

production by solvent extraction and electro-winning, and cathode transportation. 

After a series of trade off studies of the various power and acid supply alternatives, it 

was concluded that current and projected sulfuric acid shortages were best addressed 

by the inclusion of a 140,000 ton per year on-site sulfur burning acid plant. The acid 

and co-gen power plant was estimated to have a capital cost of $23 million. The acid 

plant was sized to provide the projected sulfuric acid requirements for the operation, 

and approximately half of the 10 MW required project power.  The rest of the power 

will be supplied from the Argentinean grid in Calingasta located 93 km to the north of 

the Leaching Plant in San Juan province.  

Trade off studies were also performed to determine the most cost efficient way of 

hauling  ore from the mine site to the leaching process plant in San Juan. Trucking, 

Conveyor and Rail were studied, with the lowest operational cost and optimal 

technical alternative being a 22 km Railway with 3000 HP locomotive and 42 wagons 

of 58 ton each. 

Water will be supplied by a 20 km pipeline from El Tigre stream, located in Yalguaraz 

Ranch owned by Minera San Jorge. 

 

1.5 OPERATING COSTS 

All operating costs associated with ore transportation to San Juan, and acid production plant, 

were included in the plant operating costs, as shown in Table 1.5

An additional $17 million in capital will be expended over the life of the project as 

deferred, sustaining and closure costs. The capital cost estimate excluded losses or 

gains that may arise from foreign exchange rate variations, cost escalation, and other 

factors, as detailed in this report. 

 

1.7 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 

The Project was evaluated on both a pre-tax basis and after all taxes, including export levy 

and provincial royalty. The Base Case operating cash flow peaks at $76 million in the 2nd year 

with a minimum cash flow of $23 million in the 10th year, which is the last operating period, as 

shown in Table 1.7

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 GENERAL 

Coro Mining Corporation (Coro), through its 100% owned subsidiary Minera Cielo 

Azul Limitada (Cielo Azul), commissioned Process and Pipeline Projects S.A. 

(Propipe) to provide a Technical Report for the San Jorge Copper Leach Project. The 

San Jorge Property is located in west-central Argentina approximately 110 km 

northwest of the provincial city of Mendoza and 250 km northeast of Santiago, Chile 

as shown in Figure 2.1. 

Coro is a public company whose stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange with its 

registered office at Suite 2610, Oceanic Plaza, 1066 West Hasting Street, Vancouver, 

British Columbia, Canada. 

Sergio Alvarado, BSc (Hons.) Geology, member of Canada Institute of Mining (CIM), 

The Chilean Mining Commission (CMC) and The Chilean Mining Engineers Institute 

(IIMCh), was responsible for the overall preparation of the Technical Report as 

defined in National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 

and in compliance with Form 43-101F1. 

Porphyry style Copper mineralization was first recognized on the San Jorge property 

in the early 1960s, and exploration continue, intermittently until 2008. A total of 30,021 

m in 183 drill holes has been drilled on the San Jorge Property by five exploration 

companies, comprising 21,650 m of diamond drilling in 123 drill holes, and 8,371 m of 

reverse circulation drilling in 60 drill holes.  

San Jorge Property was previously reviewed by AMEC in 2003 for Lumina Copper 

Corporation (Lumina) and in 2006 and 2007, for Coro. NCL Ingeniería y Construcción 

(NCL) also reported an update of AMEC 2007 report in February 2008.   

In May 2008 Ausenco reported, based in NCL 2008, a resource model that included a 

new geological model and mineral resource estimate using data available as at 23 

October 2007. Geological interpretation was prepared by Coro personnel and 

reviewed by NCL geologists who also built solid models for different oxidation 

domains. The geological models were used to prepare a mineral resource estimate for

copper and gold. The optimization of the mineral resource estimate used a cut off of 

0.3% CuT, unconstrained, and an economic envelop defined by the software Whittle 

4X, using a copper price of 1.5 $/lb. 

This Technical Report considers and revises mining, geotechnical, hydrological and 

hydrogeological studies, metallurgical testwork, plant and infrastructure preliminary 

design and capital and operational cost estimation that were reported in the Ausenco 

NI43-101 Prefeasibility Standard Study Report in May 2008. 

Information and data for Propipe's review and report were obtained from Coro's Vice 

President of Development, Mr. Marcelo Cortés; and San Jorge Environmental & 

Community Relations Manager, Pablo Alonso.

2.3 CONTRIBUTORS TO REPORT 

Some sections of this Technical Report were extracted directly from the Ausenco 

"Preliminary Feasibility Study for the San Jorge Copper Leach Only Project, Las 

Heras, Mendoza Province, Argentina" completed in May 2008. That report is also 

based on NCL "Mineral Resource Model Update for San Jorge Copper-Gold Deposit, 

Mendoza, Argentina" completed in February 2008. 

The participants' contributions to the report are combined in a single document. The 

various parties responsible for supplying data and other information for the report are 

as follows: 

• Rodrigo de Brito Mello, FausIMM (Consulting Geologist, RBM Ltda) served as the

2.4 USE OF SULFURIC ACID IN MENDOZA 

In June 2007 the Mendoza Government passed legislation prohibiting the use of 

dangerous chemicals in metaliferous mining within the province. This would prevent 

the use of sulfuric acid which is required for ore leaching such as in the process 

defined in this study. 

This Technical Report is based on the outcomes of an engineering study completed in 

2008 by Ausenco, and revised and updated by Propipe in 2011 to prefeasibility study. 

The Propipe Technical Report includes the resources, open pit mine plan, operating 

and capital costs and financial analysis for the leach project which describes the 

production of up 55 million lbs per year of copper cathode for a period of 10 years. It is 

a comprehensive study of the viability of the project that has advanced to a stage 

where the mining method has been established and an effective method of mineral 

processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based on 

reasonable assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, 

and environmental factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors which are 

sufficient to determine if all or part of the mineral resource may be classified as a 

mineral reserve; however, due to current legislation in the Province of Mendoza which 

prohibits the use sulfuric acid, which is required in heap leaching of copper ore, and 

according to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Coro was unable to 

quote mineral reserves for the Project. In an effort to resolve the ban on use of sulfuric 

acid in Mendoza, this study report shows that a  potentially viable project can be 

achieved by a constructing an SX/EW heap leach plant outside of Mendoza at a 

distance of 22 km in the pro-mining province of San Juan. Several mines such as 

Intrepid Mines Casposo, Yamana Gold's Gualcamayo, and Barrick's Veladero are in 

production in San Juan, and some giant projects are in development such as Barrick's 

Pascua Lama and Xtrata's Pachón. Coro and Propipe have received a legal opinion 

(refer to Annex in chapter 32) that there should be no legal impediment to the 

transport of the ore between Mendoza and San Juan; and as a result, this study 

qualifies as a preliminary feasibility study as CIM standard defined in National 

Instrument 43-101.

4.3 AGREEMENT TERMS 

Pursuant to an agreement dated August 9, 2006, as supplemented by a side letter 

dated August 9, 2006 and amended by amendments made as of October 18, 2006, 

June 12, 2008 and January 20, 2009 (the "San Jorge Agreement") among the 

Company, its wholly owned subsidiary Minera Cielo Azul Ltda ("MCAL"), Lumina 

Copper Corp ("Lumina" previously, "Global") and Minera Global Copper Chile S.A. 

("Minera Global", an indirect wholly-owed subsidiary of Lumina), the Company, 

through MCAL, acquired from Minera Global all of the issued and outstanding shares 

(the "MSJ Shares") in the capital of MSJ.  

The Company purchased the MSJ Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1 

million, payable in cash, and the issuance of an aggregate of 1,000,000 common 

shares of the Company to Minera Global, as follows: 

a) $37,500 paid prior to the execution of the original San Jorge Agreement;  

b) On or before August 9, 2006, paid $262,500 and issued 333,333 common 

shares at a deemed price of $0.75 per common share;  

c) On or before February 9, 2007, paid $300,000 and issued 333,333 common 

shares at a deemed price of $0.75 per common share; and  

d) On or before February 8, 2008, paid $400,000 and issued 333,334 common 

shares at the market price. 

Further to the amendments dated June 12, 2008 and January 20, 2009, the Company 

has completed and has outstanding, the following payment obligations to Lumina:  

a) On or before May 10, 2009, $500,000; paid

e) On or before May 10, 2013, $5,000,000, less the aggregate deemed share 

price of the 1,000,000 common shares of the Company previously issued to 

Lumina. 

In addition, if after May 10, 2011, the Company completes a bankable feasibility study 

on either the heap leachable copper resources or the sulfide copper resources, or a 

combination of both, on the San Jorge Property, the Company will pay to Minera 

Global the balance of any amounts owing under the San Jorge Agreement within six 

months from the date of the completion of the bankable feasibility study.  

Upon commencement of commercial production, the Company has agreed to pay 

Lumina: 

a) An amount equal to $0.025 per pound of copper contained in the mineable, 

proven and probable heap leachable reserves, as may be: (i) delineated in a 

bankable feasibility study for the sulfide copper resources; or (ii) delineated 

in a bankable feasibility study for the heap leachable copper resources; or 

(iii) as may be contained in a stockpile of leachable mineral-bearing material 

formed in connection with any exploitation of a resource in connection with 

the San Jorge Property; and  

b) An amount equal to $0.02 per pound of copper contained in the mineable, 

proven and probable sulfide reserves. 

For greater certainty all payment obligations under the San Jorge Agreement 

including the deemed value of the Company's common shares issued to Lumina will 

be deducted from the purchase price payable to Lumina at commencement of 

commercial production.  

Further, if the Company commences commercial production from the mineable, 

proven and probable sulfide copper reserves, the Company will pay to Lumina the 

following annual royalty (the "Royalty") on all copper in excess of that derived from the 

total minable, proven and probable heap leachable reserves and minable, proven and 

probable sulfide reserves:

a) $0.02 per pound of copper contained in ore placed on leach pads, in excess 

of the total pounds of copper contained in the minable, proven and probable 

heap leachable reserves; and  

b) $0.015 per pound of copper contained in ore processed by a mill, in excess 

of the total pounds of copper contained in the minable, proven and probable 

sulfide reserves. 

The Company will pay Lumina a net smelter return production royalty of 1.5% on all 

products other than copper, produced at the San Jorge Property.  

If Lumina assigns all of its interest in the San Jorge Agreement to a third party, then 

the Company will have a right of first refusal to acquire the Royalty prior to the sale or 

assignment of the Royalty to a third party.  

The Company has the right to require Lumina and Minera Global to enter into a voting 

trust agreement in respect of the common shares owned by Lumina or Minera Global, 

pursuant to which Lumina and Minera Global will agree to vote their common shares 

as may be directed by the Company, but no such agreement has been entered into as 

of the date of this report.  

Effective September 7, 2006, Lumina entered into an Indemnity Agreement (the 

"Indemnity Agreement") with the former owner of the San Jorge Property in exchange 

for a payment of ARS$1,550,000. The real property on which the San Jorge Property 

is located was transferred to MSJ on December 31, 2006, received approval of the 

Frontier Security Zone Commission of Argentina in November 2011 and is in the 

process of being formally registered. In connection with San Jorge Agreement, 

Lumina assigned the Indemnity Agreement to the Company in exchange for a 

payment of $1,096,000. 

If the Company does not complete the payments contemplated by the San Jorge 

Agreement or for any other reason and the MSJ Shares are returned to Minera 

Global, then the Company will assign the Indemnity Agreement to Minera Global for 

no consideration.

The Company and MCAL have no obligation to satisfy the consideration contemplated 

by the San Jorge Agreement and if the Company and MCAL conclude that they do not 

wish to develop or further develop the San Jorge Property, then the Company and 

MCAL will provide written notice to Lumina and Minera Global that they do not wish to 

develop or further develop the San Jorge Property and MCAL will transfer or cause to 

be transferred the MSJ Shares to Minera Global as soon as reasonably practicable 

thereafter. 

Effective June 16 2011, Lumina assigned its rights under the San Jorge Agreement to 

a new company, Lumina Royalty Corp by way of a plan of arrangement, and effective 

December 1 2011, also by way of a plan of arrangement, Lumina Royalty Corp 

became a wholly owned subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation, and was renamed 

as Franco-Nevada LRC Holdings Corp. On February 29th 2012, Coro announced that 

it had signed a non-binding letter of intent ("LOI") with Franco-Nevada Corporation 

("Franco Nevada") to substantially amend the agreement whereby Coro may acquire 

100% of MSJ. The terms of this LOI are as follows; 

a) Coro may make Option payments of US$1.25 million per year, for 10 years, 

payable quarterly, commencing March 31, 2012 

b) Coro may at any time, prepay the outstanding amount with a one-time 

payment equal to the net present value of the future payments, using a 5% 

discount rate 

c) A 7.5% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") payable by Coro to Franco Nevada on all 

gold produced from the property 

d) The option payments are not payable when exceeded by the gold NSR 

payment for the period 

e) No other consideration, obligations, payments, or royalties are due to Franco 

Nevada, and Coro may withdraw from the Agreement at any time by not 

making the payments due. 

The San Jorge Agreement will be amended accordingly in due course.

4.4 PROPERTY AND TITLE IN ARGENTINA 

The following summary of regulations for exploration and exploitation concessions is 

based on information freely available and posted on the Argentinean government 

mining web site (http://www.mineria.gov.ar/nlegal2.asp). 

The rights, obligations, and procedures for the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, 

and use of mineral substances in Argentina are regulated by the Argentinean Mining 

Code.  The Mining Code establishes three classes of minerals.  The first class 

comprises "metalliferous substances" such as gold, silver, copper, lead, where 

ownership is vested in the Government, which in turn grants exploitation concessions 

to private companies; and Class 2, which comprises "other metalliferous substances'', 

including earthy minerals, and industrial minerals, that belong to the land owner.  

Creek bed and placer deposits, as well as abandoned tailings and mine waste rock 

deposits, are included in the latter mineral class. 

4.4.1 EXPLORATION 

Among other functions, the Mining Code administers obtaining exploration rights or 

concessions.  Characteristics of an exploration concession, referred to as a cateo, 

include: 

Exclusivity – the holder of the cateo has rights to any mineral discoveries made by a 
third party within the boundaries of the cateo. 

Extent – cateos are measured in 500 hectare (ha) units, or fractions thereof.  No 
single cateo may exceed 10,000 ha (20 units), and no person may hold more than 

200,000 ha (20 cateos) in a single province.  The exploration area within a cateo may 

be contiguous or separated. 

Time – the holder of a cateo must assess the mineral potential within the granted 
exploration area (and apply for an exploitation right) within a time period based on the 

size of the cateo. The exploration term is 150 days for the first 500 ha (1 unit) or 

fraction thereof, and an additional 50 days for each additional unit (or fraction thereof) 

within the cateo. After 300 days, 50% of the exploration area over 2,000 ha (4 units) 

within the cateo must be relinquished. At 700 days, 50% of the remaining area must

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 68 OF 461 

be dropped.  Time extensions may be granted to allow for inclement weather, difficult 

access, and other factors. 

Work – the holder of a cateo must present to the mining authority a minimum 
exploration work program and schedule. The cateo may be revoked if the 

requirements of the work program and schedule are not met. 

A one-off fee of ARS $400 (400 Argentina Pesos) per 500 ha (1 unit) must be paid 

upon application for a cateo. 

4.4.2 EXPLOITATION 

The Mining Code also regulates exploitation rights (mining concessions). Priority for 

receiving a mining concession is given to the registered discoverer of a deposit, i.e., 

the holder of the cateo. A mining concession unit area, or pertenencia, is 6 ha for 

common mineral deposits and 100 ha for disseminated mineral bodies; each mining 

concession may consist of two or more pertenencias. Application to the mining 

authority must include official cartographic coordinates of the deposit location and of 

the reconnaissance area, and a sample of the mineralisation discovered. The 

reconnaissance area, which may be as much as twice the surface area projection of 

the deposit, is allocated to allow for potential geological extensions to mineralisation 

and for site layout and infrastructure development. Excess area is released once the 

survey plans are approved by the mining authority. 

Estaca Minas (Mine Estacas) are 6 ha extensions to existing surveyed mining 

concessions that were granted under previous versions of the mining code, and are 

the equivalent of mining concessions. The granting of new estacas was eliminated 

from the mining code in July 1996. 

Once the application for a mine has been submitted, the holder of the exploitation 

concession may commence mining. Any person opposed to the mine operation, 

whether a holder of an overlapping cateo, a land owner disputing the existence of the 

deposit or the class of the economic mineral, or a partner in the discovery who claims 

to have been neglected, must publicly register opposition to the operation in the 

Boletín Oficial or official publication of the mining authority.  Within 100 days of

officially registering opposition, the person opposed to the mining operation must 

present legal documentation to support the claim against the location, nature, or 

assignment of the exploitation concession. 

Within 30 days after the resolution of any dispute against the location, nature, or 

assignment of the mining concession, the holder of the exploitation concession must 

submit a legal survey of the properties (lots) requested for the mining operation, within 

the maximum property limits allowed by the Mining Code. The request is published in 

the Boletín Oficial and may also be subject to dispute. Approval and registration of the 

legal survey request by the mining authority constitutes formal title to the mining 

property. 

A new mining operation is entitled to national, provincial, and municipal tax 

exemptions for 5 years. The exemptions commence with the awarding of formal title to 

the mine. Additional royalty payments to the government are subject to exemptions of 

3 years. 

New exploitation concessions may also be awarded for mines that were abandoned or 

for which their original exploitation concessions were declared to have expired. In 

such cases, the first person claiming interest in the property has priority. A new 

exploitation concession is awarded after payment of the royalties owed since 

abandonment or expiry of the previous concession. The concession is awarded in the 

condition left by the previous owner.  

The mining operation must fulfill three conditions as part of its exploitation concession: 

• Payment of mining royalties; 

• Provision of minimum investment and 

• Reactivation of the mine if it is shut down for more than four years, if required 

by the mining authority. 

Mining royalties are paid to the state (national or provincial) under which the 

exploitation concession is registered, and are paid in equal installments twice yearly. 

A mining operation that has not paid its royalty within two months of the due date is

given notice by the mining authority. The exploitation concession under which the 

mine operates expires if the overdue royalty has not been paid within 45 days of being 

served notice. 

The royalty is set by national law (presently Law No. 24.224 of the Mining 

Reorganization) according to the assigned category of the operation.  In general, the 

annual royalty due is ARS $80 per 6 ha pertenencia for common ore bodies held by 

the exploitation concession, or ARS $800 per 100 ha pertenencia for disseminated 

ore bodies. The discoverer of the mine is exempt from paying royalties for 3 years 

from the date on which formal title was awarded to the deposit. 

The holder of the exploitation concession must also commit to investing over a five 

year period a sum that is at least three hundred times the value of the annual mining 

royalty in fixed assets. For the first two years, 20% of the total required investment 

value (i.e., the annual royalty for each year) must be made in each year. For the final 

three years, the remaining 60% of the total required investment may be distributed in 

another manner. The exploitation concession expires if the minimum required 

investment schedule is not met. 

If exploration or exploitation of the deposit is suspended for more than four successive 

years, the mining authority can require the holder of the concession to prepare and 

undertake a plan to activate or reactivate work at the property within a five-year term. 

Failure to present or complete the plan results in the expiration of the mining 

concession.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

Access to the Property is from the city of Mendoza, which is located in central-west 

Argentina in the Province of Mendoza (refer to Figure 4.1). The international airport in 

Mendoza offers daily flights to Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile. The road from 

Mendoza to the Property consists of an all-weather paved road (Route 7) to Uspallata. 

At Uspallata, the route turns north onto a well-maintained, provincial dirt road (Route 

39) for 40 kms. The final 7 km to the Property is along a dirt road over gently 

undulating terrain. The total driving time is approximately 2 hours for the 157 km 

distance from Mendoza to the Property.  

Both Mendoza and Uspallata are located on Route 7, which is the main road 

traversing Argentina, connecting the Argentinean capital of Buenos Aires to Santiago, 

the capital of Chile. 

 

5.2 CLIMATE 

The climate in the region is regarded as dry, continental desert, with a high rate of 

evaporation. The average annual temperature is 12.4°C. Minimum and maximum 

temperatures recorded are -15°C and 37.8°C, respectively. Torrential, periodic 

rainfalls of limited duration are common during the afternoons in the summer months. 

Total annual average precipitation is approximately 174.3 mm. Light snowfall is not 

uncommon in the winter months. The mean annual relative humidity is 49%.  

In the open valley, strong winds are common in the spring months and the annual 

average wind velocity is 25 km/hour. The prevalent wind direction is easterly. 

The vegetation is typified by sparse, low-lying brush, cactus and patches of thick-

bladed grasses (Figure 5.1). Past agricultural practices destroyed the local 

environment as the land is no longer suitable for pastoral usage.

5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

The Property contains very little developed infrastructure apart from the roads 

constructed for drill rig access, and a semi-permanent exploration camp installed in 

the early 1970s and refurbished by Coro, with the addition of a core storage facility.   

The condition of Route 7, which is a paved road, from Mendoza to Uspallata is good. 

Route 39, is also good since it has been paved recently by the national government 

up to to the property entrance; and is expected to be finished completely to the village 

of Barreal  in San Juan province  in early 2012. The Property access road from Route

39 is little more than a dirt track which will need upgrading if development is to 

progress. 

Uspallata is located on Route 7 and is only 50 km from the Chilean border and 150 

km from Santiago.  It would be the point of access for equipment and consumables for 

any planned mining operation.  

The city of Mendoza, which has a population of approximately one million people 

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza%2C_Argentina), is the closest major settlement. 

The closest port facility is Valparaiso in Chile, located 156 km to the southwest of the 

Property (Figure 4.1). The nearest rail head to the Project site is in Mendoza. 

Local water sources are the Arroyo del Tigre drainage located 5 km north of San 

Jorge Property, and the floor of the Uspallata Valley to the east and south of the 

Property.  

Power is not locally available and would be have to be either produced by gensets or 

brought in from the existing grid to the south or north of the Property. 

 

5.4 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Property lies along the western margin of the Uspallata Valley. The valley is a 

200 km long graben that is flanked by the Cordillera Frontal to the west, which rises to 

elevations in excess of 5,000 masl, and the Pre-Cordillera to the east, which reaches 

elevations of approximately 3,000 masl. Elevation on the Property varies from 2,600 

to 2,700 masl, whereas the base of the Uspallata valley floor is at 2,200 to 2,300 

masl. The principal geomorphological features in the area are alluvial fans cut by 

drainage channels, and the pediment associated with the Cordillera Frontal. 

Drainage is from the Cordillera Frontal, flowing east and then south into the Rio 

Uspallata, or into the enclosed basin of the Cienaga de Yalguaraz to the north of the 

Property.

5.5 AN OVERVIEW OF ARGENTINA 

5.5.1 INTRODUCTION 

The Republic of Argentina is located in the southeastern portion of the continent of 

South America. Argentina is bordered to the south and west by Chile and to the north 

by Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. From north to south, the east side of Argentina is 

bordered by Brazil, Uruguay, and the Atlantic Ocean. Argentina shares the southern 

island territory of Tierra del Fuego with Chile, and continues to dispute ownership of 

the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) off its eastern seaboard. 

With a landmass covering about 2.8 million km2, Argentina is the second-largest 

country in South America after Brazil and the eighth largest in the world.  Argentina 

has a population of about 38 million, of whom some 16 million live in the capital, 

Buenos Aires. 

Sedentary tribes and nomadic hunters populated pre-Columbian Argentina. These 

indigenous tribes generally resisted incursions and attempts at settlement by the 

Spanish. Buenos Aires was not established until 1580, and remained a relatively 

unimportant centre for 200 years. The combination of Spanish colonization and the 

introduction of previously unknown diseases from Europe decreased the numbers of 

native people in Argentina. As the indigenous population declined in number, the 

Spanish settlers claimed the land to create huge cattle ranches (haciendas). 

Argentina achieved independence in 1816, after continued dissatisfaction with the 

political and economic domination imposed by Spain, and following the uprising and 

revolution of May 25, 1810. However, independence revealed the split between the 

Federalists (conservative landowners, supported by the gauchos and rural working 

class) who advocated provincial autonomy and the Unitarists (cosmopolitan city 

dwellers of Buenos Aires) who welcomed the injection of European capital, 

immigrants and ideas. Buenos Aires' central authority was eventually upheld in the 

Unitarist constitution of 1853, and a new era of growth and prosperity carried 

Argentina into the initial decades of the 20th century.

5.5.2 GEOGRAPHY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

Argentina can be separated into four major physiographic regions: the Andes 

Mountains in the west, the fertile lowland and subtropical rainforests in the north, a 

mix of humid and dry, flat expanses of the Pampas in the centre of the country, and 

the pastoral steppes and glacial zones of Patagonia in the extreme south. The 

principal rivers are the Paraná, Uruguay, and Paraguay Rivers, which drain into the 

Río de la Plata Basin in northern Argentina. In the south, the Colorado and Negro 

Rivers, which originate in the Andes, flow to the Atlantic Ocean. 

Argentina's climate ranges from subtropical in the north, to humid and warm in the 

centre, to cold in the south. Climate conditions in the Andes include erratic rainfall with 

flash floods in the summertime, searing heat, snow at higher elevations, and hot, dry 

winds. The lowlands receive sufficient rainfall to support swampy forests and upland 

savannah. Precipitation levels are generally greater in the eastern lowlands and 

shallow summer flooding is common. However, the lowland winters can be long and 

dry, and the summers uncomfortably hot. Patagonia has mild weather conditions year-

round in the east and experiences glacial conditions in the south. 

Argentina's major cities include Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Rosario, and La Plata. The 

country has some 229,000 km of highways, 62,000 km of which are paved. Other 

transportation infrastructure includes about 38,000 km of railway line and more than 

11,000 km of navigable waterways. Argentina's main ports and harbors include Bahía 

Blanca, Buenos Aires, Comodoro Rivadavia, Concepción del Uruguay, La Plata, Mar 

del Plata, Necochea, Río Gallegos, Rosario, Santa Fe, and Ushuaia. There are about 

1,200 airports in Argentina, 32 of which receive regular commercial flights. Ezeiza 

International Airport, located 34 km from Buenos Aires, serves many international 

airlines as well as the national airlines. The other international airports in Argentina 

are generally used for flights to neighboring South American countries only.

5.5.3 DEMOGRAPHY AND GOVERNMENT 

Approximately 85% of Argentina's population is of European descent, with the 

remaining 15% comprised of mestizos (persons of mixed Spanish and indigenous 

background), indigenous, and other minorities. Spanish is the official language of 

Argentina, and is used for government and commerce. Literacy of the Argentinean 

peoples is high for South America with 97.1% of the population aged 15 and older 

being able to read and write (CIA World Factbook webpage, 2006). There are 17 

indigenous languages, which are not widely encountered outside of small towns and 

settlements. Roman Catholicism accounts for 93% of the religious practice, with the 

Protestant, Jewish, Ukrainian Catholic, and Armenian Orthodox faiths making up the 

remainder. 

Argentina's key industries include food processing, motor vehicles, consumer 

durables, textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel, and 

agribusiness. More than half of Argentina's workforce is employed in the service 

sector, with the industrial sector (manufacturing, mining, and utilities) employing about 

18%, and agriculture about 10%, of the workforce. 

Since independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina has undergone periods of foreign 

intervention and civilian, dictator, and military rule, coupled with economic problems 

and labor disputes. Argentina returned to its constitution of 1853 after removing the 

repressive military government that ruled the country from 1976 to 1983 and lost the 

territorial dispute over the Falkland Islands with Great Britain. In an effort to tame 

rampant inflation, the Carlos Menem government opened the Argentinean economy to 

foreign investment, sold nationalized industries, and in 1991 pegged the peso one-to-

one to the US dollar. By 1997, inflation had been reduced from 5,000% to 1%, but at 

the cost of rising unemployment and a prolonged recession. 

The government of Fernando de la Rua, elected in 1999, initiated austerity plans to 

balance Argentina's budget. However, after four years of recession and 

unemployment running at 20%, the Argentinean people protested against the tough 

fiscal measures with strikes and demonstrations that became violent after the 

government instituted restrictions on bank withdrawals. In December 2001, Argentina

defaulted on a loan repayment, of the order of US$100 billion and the country plunged 

into economic and political turmoil. The de la Rua government resigned and the 

country was plagued by widespread civil chaos 

On 1 January 2002, Eduardo Duhalde became Argentina's fifth president in two 

weeks. Duhalde promptly unpaged the peso from the dollar, with the result that the 

peso devalued by more than 50% almost immediately. The move was unpopular but 

necessary for Argentina to secure any further aid from the International Monetary 

Fund (IMF). 

Although the Peronists retain a strong grip on Argentinean politics the presidential 

elections held on April 27th 2003 saw the party fail to unite behind a single candidate 

for the first time in its history. The majority of the vote in the first round was split 

between the two Peronist candidates. Carlos Menem, staging a come back, took 24% 

of the votes narrowly beating the new comer Nestor Kirchner, who took 22% of the 

vote, into second place. Carlos Menem, seeing his popularity fall pulled out of the 

race, leaving Nestor Kirchner to become president. After his sudden death, his wife 

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner became president and was re-elected on October 23rd 

2011 with 54% of the votes. 

The National Constitution affirms that Argentina is a federal country with three levels 

of state: federal, provincial, and local. The Constitution is based on the republican 

doctrine of the division of powers into three different areas: executive, legislative, and 

judicial.  The federal state is ruled by a presidential system. The President, who holds 

executive power, is the head of both the state and the federal government, and is 

elected to a four-year term by direct universal suffrage. Legislative power is controlled 

by a Congress that comprises a 257-member Chamber of Deputies, and a 72-

member Senate. Representatives in the Chamber of Deputies are elected to four-year 

terms, and members of the Senate are elected directly to a six year term. The 

Supreme Court, made up of nine judges, oversees judicial power. 

Administratively, Argentina is comprised of 23 autonomous provinces and 1 federal 

district. Each of the provinces has its own government and courts that mirror the 

federal system.

5.5.4 BUSINESS INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN ARGENTINA 

Due to high unemployment rates, and an overvalued currency, Argentina's economy 

began to falter in 1999. A three year long recession was experienced, ultimately 

ending in the economic crisis of 2002. 

In late 2001, Argentina was forced to default on international debt of the order of US$ 

93 billion of international debt, leading to a complete loss of confidence in the country 

by foreign investors.   

A sharp devaluation of the Argentinean Peso as well as other economic reforms has 

allowed Argentina's economy to stabilize. GDP continues to grow, surpassing levels 

seen prior to the crisis, but unemployment levels and inflation rates remain high.  

Due to the devaluation of the currency in 2002 and the current booming metal prices, 

Argentina's mining sector has rebounded. Currently over 80 companies are exploring 

in Argentina. Argentina is considered to be under-explored, with only 25% of the 

Argentinean Andes having been explored. The country hosts gold, copper, lead, zinc, 

natural borate, bentonite clay, and ornamental stone deposits.  

Mining Investment Law N° 24.196 has established a 30-year guarantee of fiscal 

stability for new mining projects and/or extension of existing projects. This law was 

enacted in an effort to draw foreign investors into the country following the economic 

crisis. The law allows for accelerated depreciation of capital goods, deductions in 

exploration costs, and access to machinery and equipment at international prices. 

Depreciation of infrastructure occurs over a 3 year time period (60% depreciation in 

the first year, 20% in the second and 20% in the third) while all other depreciation 

occurs in a straight line method of 33.33%. 

The major taxes that affect the mining sector are as follows: 

• National Income Tax   35% 

• State Income Tax   3.6% of cathodes sale revenue 

• State Mining Tax Royalty  3% net smelter return (NSR)

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 SUMMARY 

The first recorded exploration took place in the 1960s, when prospector Valeziano 

Martínez dug a number of pits at San Jorge to examine outcropping chrysocolla and 

malachite mineralization. His primary interest was, however, a copper vein located on 

the San Jorge Mining Concession. This concession lies just over four km west of the 

main showing, which is known as San Jorge Segundo and which has been the focus 

of later exploration activity (refer to Figure 4.1).   

In 1964, F. Whiting, Chief Geologist of Minera Aguilar S.A. (Aguilar) visited the 

property and recognized the potential for a significant deposit of secondary copper 

mineralization. Aguilar optioned the Property, but, after a program that included 

mapping, pitting, trenching, surface sampling, geophysics and diamond drilling, 

exploration was discontinued and the Property dropped in 1968 (Table 6.1).   

Exploraciones Falconbridge Argentina S.A. (Falconbridge) optioned the Property in 

1973 and carried out a program that included detailed geological mapping, re-

interpretation of regional geophysics, diamond drilling and metallurgical testing. 

In 1992, Recursos Americanos Argentinas (RAA) optioned the Property from Pedro 

Natalio Aldave. From 1992 to 1996, RAA carried out an exploration program that 

included geological mapping, surface sampling, re-evaluation of existing induced 

polarization (I.P.) geophysical data, reverse circulation drilling, limited diamond drilling 

and metallurgical testing. A resource was estimated, and a preliminary scoping study 

completed (MRDI, 1993). 

In 1994, Grupo Minero Aconcagua S.A. (GMA), a subsidiary of Northern Orion, 

entered into a deal with RAA to continue exploration on the San Jorge Segunda 

Property; however, in June 1995 Northern Orion purchased RAA. From 1994 to 1998 

GMA carried out a program of mapping, re-sampling of trenches, reverse circulation 

and diamond drilling, and metallurgical testing. During this time, a resource estimate 

(Simmerman, 1996), hydrological and environmental work (Hydro-Search, 1996, and

Dames and Moore, 1997), a scoping study and an initial feasibility study (Fluor Daniel 

Wright, 1997) were completed. 

In the 1990s, a junior exploration company called Argentine Mineral Development 

(AMD) acquired a number of mining concessions surrounding the San Jorge Segunda 

Concession. In March 1999 an agreement was reached between GMA and AMD to 

jointly explore and develop the Project. However, the JV agreement did not proceed 

and Minera San Jorge (MSJ) was formed by Northern Orion, and was designated as 

the holder of the San Jorge mining concessions on 1 August 2000.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The San Jorge Property is located on the western periphery of a regional, north-south 

trending structure known as the Uspallata-Calingasta-Iglesia Graben. To the east of 

the graben lies the Pre-Cordillera and to the west is the Cordillera Frontal. 

The oldest rocks known to outcrop in this area are Devonian-aged marine 

greywackes, siltstones and shales that comprise the Cienaga de Medio Formation. 

Overlying the Cienaga de Medio Formation sediments are Carboniferous-aged 

sediments of the Yalguaraz Formation.  The Yalguaraz Formation comprises a 

heterogeneous group of lithologies ranging from pelites to impure sandstones, 

quartzites, sandstones, conglomerates and intraformational breccias. These 

sediments were folded and faulted during the late Palaeozoic. Fold axes trend north to 

south, while fault movement was reportedly transcurrent (Williams, 1996). 

Permo-Triassic-aged intrusive activity was located along the margins of the graben. 

The intrusives are characteristically small, porphyritic to aphanitic quartz-diorites and 

diorites to granodiorites that have produced hornfelsing of the sediments along their 

contacts.  In general, the intrusives are not mineralized. 

To the west in the Cordillera Frontal, a thick sequence of Permo-Triassic aged felsic 

and andesitic volcanics known as the Choiyoi Formation are in angular unconformable 

contact with the Yalguraz Formation. The volcanics are intruded by a series of 

contemporaneous hypabyssal dykes and stocks. 

During the Tertiary period, the rapid Andean uplift of the Cordillera Frontal and the 

Pre-Cordillera produced significant alluvial deposits, which partially infilled the 

Uspallata-Calisngasta-Iglesia Graben. In the central areas of the graben the alluvial 

deposits may reach a thickness of over 200 m. In some areas these deposits are now 

dissected by younger drainages. 

The regional structural fabric is principally north-south and parallel to the graben. Also 

important are north-northwest, northeast, northwest and east-west striking fault 

systems.  Permian transcurrent movement appears to have been followed by a period

of compression related to Andean uplift during the Tertiary, and finally by a tensional 

regime which resulted in graben formation. 

 

7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 

At San Jorge, the Carboniferous sediments of the Yalguaraz Formation comprise 

(Williams, 1996):  

• Matrix-supported conglomerates, medium grey to grey-red in colour. 

• Variably thin to thick-bedded, fine to coarse-grained, poor to well-sorted 

arenites and sub-arenites. 

• Sandstones, medium grey to grey-red in colour. 

• Thinly bedded, darker grey siltstones. 

• Thinly bedded, grey-green shales. 

The sediments (Figure 7.1) are intruded by granite-porphyry and dacitic stocks and 

dykes of Permo-Triassic age.  

The granite porphyry outcrops in the southeast sector of the San Jorge hill (Figure 

7.2) forming a tongue in the hanging-wall side of Falla Gorda, a major north-south 

trending fault immediately east of the San Jorge hill. The intrusive is a distinctive light 

grey to pink-grey color. The phenocryst population, which may comprise up to 50% of 

the rock mass, is dominated by plagioclase feldspar with anhedral to euhedral quartz-

eyes with lesser hornblende and pseudo-hexagonal biotite books. The phenocrysts 

are typically coarse, ranging in size from 1.5 to 6 mm, with an average dimension of 4 

mm.  

The contact with the sediments is near vertical and irregular, with localized 

brecciation, fracturing and veining. Contact breccia is noted only along the northwest 

contact of the granite porphyry where it is a sharp contact. The contact breccia is 

pale-colored and comprises angular, silicified sedimentary and igneous clasts in a 

siliceous matrix which may contain minor tourmaline.

Dacite porphyry has been observed in drill holes in the southwest and northeast 

sectors of the deposit in the form of dykes crosscutting both the granite porphyry and 

the sediments. The dacite intrusive may be distinguished from the granite porphyry by 

its light to medium grey colour, and finer grained and more mafic matrix. Phenocrysts 

consist of sub to euhedral plagioclase up to 8 mm in size, quartz eyes and euhedral to 

pseudohexagonal biotite books. 

An andesitic unit with flow structures has been identified from petrographic studies, 

but was included in the dacite porphyry group (Williams, 1996).

In the southern area of the Property a dacite dyke some 150 m long and 3 to 6 m wide 

intrudes both the granite porphyry stock and the sediments. This intrusive is 

characterized by coarse feldspar and biotite phenocrysts. 

Tourmaline breccias occur in scattered small outcrops along the western perimeter of 

the granite porphyry. These breccias are dominantly crackle- to occasionally mosaic-

textured, and consist of sub-angular to angular clasts of sediments within a 

tourmaline-quartz matrix. 

The sediments are gently folded around the axis of a monocline. The axial plane of 

the monocline trends N35°E, and dips between 15° and 40° to the west. In addition, 

minor open, gently south-plunging congruent folds with amplitudes of less than 3 m, 

occur at the northern end of the outcrop area. 

The principal fault structures strike north-south and north-northeast (Figure 7.1), while 

secondary structures strike northwest and east-northeast. Net fault displacement is

normal and is considered to have preceded any strike-slip and reverse movement.  

The main faults in this group are:  

• Falla Gorda, which is considered to be the most important structure on the 

Property.  The fault does not outcrop but has been inferred from drill holes to 

trend north-south to north-northeast and to dip 15° to 30° west.  The structure 

has proved difficult to trace with any degree of confidence and the sense of 

movement remains unknown. 

• Falla Raya Roja, which is noted in outcrop and in drill holes, strikes N5°E and 

dips steeply to the west.  The fault is postulated to be a normal fault with a 20 

m down-throw to the west.  The fault is characterized by a 1 m wide zone of 

brecciation and a 2 m wide halo of fracturing. 

• Falla Flaca, which is inferred mostly from drill holes and is difficult to trace in 

outcrop.  The fault is described as a normal fault with a 25 m displacement 

(Williams, 1996). 

• Falla Portazuela, which is known to occur to the northwest of the San Jorge 

mineralized zone and to the south of the area of outcrop.  This fault is defined 

mainly by drill holes and occurs as two segments; one striking north and the 

other north-northwest.  Both segments have a sub-vertical dip to the east.  The 

fault is typified by closely-spaced jointing. 

Several other fault zones have been identified in drill holes, and can be traced to 

surface where they appear as breccia zones up to 3 m wide. 

The mineralized stockwork in the San Jorge system is much stronger and better 

developed within the sediments than in the granite porphyry (Figure 7.3). Within the 

sedimentary sequence the vein density decreases from the sandstones, to the 

conglomerates, to the siltstones and finally to the shales.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Mineralization at San Jorge is considered to be an Andean example of a porphyry 

copper-gold deposit.  A generic description from Pantaleyev (1995) summarizes the 

common features of porphyries as large zones of hydrothermally-altered rock 

containing quartz veins and stockworks, sulfide-bearing veinlets, fractures and lesser 

disseminations in areas up to 10 km2 in size, that are commonly wholly or partially 

coincident with hydrothermal or intrusion breccias and dyke swarms. Deposit 

boundaries are determined by economic factors that outline ore zones within larger 

areas of low-grade, concentrically zoned mineralization. World class examples of 

copper-gold porphyries include the Porgera and Lihir deposits in Papua New Guinea; 

Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, FSE-Lepanto Victoria deposit in the Philippines and the 

Kemess South deposit in British Columbia, Canada. 

Important geological controls on porphyry mineralization include igneous contacts, 

cupolas and the uppermost, bifurcating parts of stocks and dike swarms. Intrusive and 

hydrothermal breccias and zones of intensely developed fracturing due to coincident 

or intersecting multiple mineralized fracture sets commonly coincide with the highest 

metal concentrations. 

The effects of surface oxidation commonly modify porphyry deposits in weathered 

environments.  Low pH meteoric waters generated by the oxidation of iron sulfides 

leach copper from oxidized copper minerals such as malachite, chrysocolla, and 

brochantite and re-deposit it as secondary chalcocite and covellite immediately below 

the water table in flat tabular zones of supergene enrichment. The process results in a 

copper-poor leached cap lying above a relatively thin, but high-grade zone of 

supergene enrichment that caps a thicker zone of moderate grade primary hypogene 

mineralization at depth. 

Alternatively, or in addition, a porphyry system may exhibit hypogene enrichment.  

The process of hypogene enrichment may relate to the introduction of late 

hydrothermal copper enriched fluids along structurally prepared pathways, or the 

leaching and redeposition of hypogene copper, or a combination of the two. The

enriched copper mineralogy comprises, for example, covellite and chalcocite. Such 

enrichment processes result in elevated hypogene grades. 

Other deposit styles that are commonly associated with porphyry deposits (spatially 

and genetically) include precious metal rich epithermal and other quartz vein systems, 

skarns, and exotic secondary copper deposits formed by the lateral migration of metal 

in low-pH fluids away from the main body of porphyry mineralization.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

9.1 GENERALITIES OF THE PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEM 

The San Jorge copper ± gold porphyry copper system is characterized by both 

repeated fracturing events and influxes of hydrothermal fluids that have resulted in the 

superimposition of hypogene alteration and sulfide mineralization events. Supergene 

alteration and mineralization is superimposed on the hypogene alteration and 

mineralization. 

Five mineralized zones are described by Williams (1996) from the San Jorge Property 

(Table 9.1). 

Table 9.1: The Five Mineralized Zones Defined at San Jorge (Williams, 1996) 

Mineralized Zone Comment
Gravels Unconsolidated sediments and colluvium, which may host 

copper oxides in eroded grains 

Leached Grades <0.2% copper of which only a minor constituent is acid 
soluble

Oxide Grade >0.2% copper of which the majority is acid soluble 

Enriched Secondary sulfide zone that contributes more than 30% of total 
contained copper 

Primary Primary sulfides with a minor occasional secondary sulfide 
component 

Each of these five mineralized zones together with an additional hypogene enriched 

category are discussed in more detail below. Figure 9.1 to Figure 9.7 show the 

distribution of the hypogene, enriched hypogene, supergene enriched, oxide and 

leach cap mineralization on the Property. 

The San Jorge porphyry system shows a vertical zonation from hypogene 

mineralization at depth, passing upwards into a supergene enriched zone, which is 

overlain by a zone of oxide mineralization and finally by a poorly developed leached 

cap. Superimposed on this basic zonation are lateral variations in the distribution of 

the mineralization types that relate to the main north to south and north-northeast 

striking fault zones. The porphyry system is ovoid in shape and covers an area of 1.1 

km north-northeast by 700 m north northwest (Figure 9.7).

The following sequence of events has been proposed for the genesis of the San 

Jorge porphyry copper system: 

• Development of the porphyry copper system soon after the emplacement of 

the granite porphyry; 

• Focusing of mineralization between the Falla Gorda and the Falla Flaca 

(Figure 9.3 to Figure 9.5); 

• A compressional regime that resulted in a portion of both the granite porphyry 

and the porphyry copper system being faulted into the near-surface 

environment; 

• Erosion and supergene processes resulted in the development of a leached 

cap, an oxide zone and secondary sulfide enrichment 

• Under a tensional regime the faults were re-activated and the permeability 

increased, thus facilitating the supergene process. 

The proposed hypogene hydrothermal vein sequence is as follows: 

• Tourmaline and chalcopyrite veins and breccia. 

• Sheeted quartz-sulfide and tourmaline veining best developed in the granite 

porphyry. 

• Pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization as disseminations and in veins, with 

minor chalcopyrite. 

• Molybdenite and chalcopyrite veining that is best developed in the granite 

porphyry. 

• Chalcopyrite introduction with minor pyrite and pyrrhotite mainly as veins. 

The alteration system associated with the San Jorge porphyry trends north-south.  

Although potassic, phyllic, propylitic and clay alteration styles have all been reported 

(Williams, 1996), the alteration does not have a 'classic' concentric zoned distribution 

around a central intrusive body. Rather, the distribution of the alteration zones is 

influenced by the principal faults, and to a lesser extent by the intrusive bodies (refer

to Figure 7.1 and Figure 9.6). A series of cross sections showing the irregular 

alteration distributions is included in Williams (1996). 

The generalized alteration sequence is described as: 

• Tourmaline. 

• Sericite veinlets. 

• Biotite veinlets and disseminations. 

• Quartz-sericite veinlets and disseminations. 

• Quartz-feldspar veinlets and potassium feldspar replacement of plagioclase. 

• Chlorite alteration of mafics. 

• Calcite veinlets. 

The stockwork comprises a mixture of hairline fractures and quartz and/or calcite 

veins up to 3 cm wide. The veins are generally sulfide-sericite-quartz, quartz-sulfide, 

quartz-potassium feldspar, quartz-calcite, tourmaline, tourmaline-sulfide or calcite. In 

the coarser sediments the vein density is described as 60 veins/metre, and in the 

porphyry as 40 veins/metre. 

Potassic alteration is characterized at San Jorge by the presence of potassium 

feldspar and biotite. The potassic alteration does not appear as a well-defined core to 

the system. Petrographic studies have suggested that pseudo-hexagonal books of 

biotite in the granite porphyry that appear to be primary are in fact comprised of 

secondary biotite (Williams, 1996). In the sediments the biotite occurs as very fine 

disseminations and as discontinuous veinlets. The biotite in the veinlets has a 

distinctive reddish-brown colour. Potassium feldspar replaces plagioclase in the 

granite porphyry and occurs in less than 2 mm wide quartz veins, which may have up 

to 20% sulfides. 

Phyllic alteration is typified by variable amounts of silica and sericite. The most 

abundant alteration observed is silicification, which affects all rock types and attains 

such intensities as a pervasive mass that it can obliterate the original rock texture. In

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 101 OF 461 

addition, silicification also occurs as quartz, quartz-sulfide and quartz-calcite veins, 

and as halos to quartz-sulfide veins.   

Sericite may be both spatially and temporarily associated with the silicification.  

Sericite occurs in less than 2 mm wide veinlets with minor sulfides, as narrow, 

discontinuous selvages to quartz-potassium feldspar veinlets, as fine disseminations 

in the matrix and as a selectively pervasive alteration of feldspar phenocrysts. 

Propylitic alteration is only weakly and patchily developed and manifests itself as 

chlorite and/or epidote and/or calcite. It occurs sporadically in the hypogene zone 

rather than as an external alteration halo. Chlorite occurs in sediments at the margins 

of the main mineralized system, or with sphene, calcite and/or iron oxides in areas of 

the granite porphyry. Epidote occurs in minor amounts, and mainly in association with 

the fault zones. Calcite veinlets commonly cross-cut fracturing and are strongly 

associated with the sediments at depth in the footwall block of the Falla Gorda fault. 

Calcite veinlets also occur at the northern extremity of the porphyry mineralization. 

Disseminations of calcite occur associated with weathered biotite.  

Clay alteration is typified by kaolinite, which is found in both the leached cap and in 

the fault gouge zones, and montmorillonite whose ocurrence is restricted to fault 

gouge zones. Kaolinite replacing sericite has also been observed in the granite 

porphyry (Williams, 1996). 

Tourmaline is a ubiquitous component throughout the system. It occurs with sulfides 

in the matrix of hydrothermal breccias, as veinlets with or without sulfides, in the 

sediments most commonly proximal to the breccias, in the granite porphyry, and as 

disseminated rosettes in all rock types.  

During the site visit some of the observed sediments that outcrop proximal to the 

granite porphyry appeared to be hornfelsed rather than showing hydrothermal-related 

alterations. The hornfelsing probably represents the earliest alteration event described 

in this section. 

Approximately 5 km to the west of the main San Jorge mineralization, in the foothills 

of the Cordillera Frontal, and within the San Jorge mining concession is a copper-

mineralized vein that was explored during the 1960s (see Section 6.0). There is a 

scarcity of information on this vein, and it was not inspected during the site visit. 

 

9.2 GRAVELS 

The gravels are not a major host of copper mineralization. However, an eroded 

component of the oxide mineralization is hosted in the gravels peripheral to the San 

Jorge Hill. These gravels are best developed in the drainages, and in general grade 

<0.14% copper. 

 

9.3 HYPOGENE COPPER MINERALIZATION 

The hypogene copper mineralization at San Jorge comprises both low and high grade 

types. Early low-grade hypogene copper mineralization is hosted primarily in 

sediments, and to a lesser extent by the intrusives, as disseminations and in veins. 

Chalcopyrite and pyrite, along with cubanite, mackinawite and marcasite, are the 

principal sulfide minerals. They occur with lesser pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, 

molybdenite, and minor galena and bornite. 

Molybdenite is regarded as an accessory sulfide that normally grades less than 150 

ppm Mo. It occurs predominantly in quartz veins in the granite porphyry in association 

with chalcopyrite. The sulfides occur as both disseminations and in veins. 

Gold has only been observed in thin section in a siliceous matrix and not as inclusions 

in sulfides. There is no correlation between gold and arsenic, and its position in the 

paragenetic sequence is unclear.  

The highest grade hypogene copper mineralization is hosted by the sediments. The 

higher-grade intervals can exceed 1.0% copper. Here, the pyrite content has been 

observed to remain static while the chalcopyrite content, especially in veins, increases 

significantly in comparison to the low-grade hypogene intervals (Williams, 1996). 

The higher grades of hypogene copper mineralization (>0.5%) trend north to north-

northeast before making a pronounced bend to trend to the northeast (Figure 9.7).

Although the reasons for this are unclear there would appear to be a strong structural 

control, possibly accompanied by a blind intrusion component (Williams, 1996). 

 

9.4 SECONDARY COPPER CARBONATE AND COPPER SILICATE 
MINERALIZATION 

Secondary copper mineralization of the copper 'oxide' zone extends over an area of 

800 m by 400m, trends north-northeast and is open to the east under. In general, 

oxide copper grades range between 0.22% and 1.43% Cu. The average thickness of 

the zone is 60 to 90 m although in certain localized areas it may be thicker locally. For 

example, over 140 m of oxide mineralization was encountered in Hole AR-71, which 

was drilled near the intersection of a number of faults and a lithologic contact. In the 

drainage to the south of San Jorge Hill the oxide grade is significantly higher than that 

of the underlying primary mineralization. 

The secondary copper minerals contained in the oxide zone are, in descending order 

of abundance, malachite, chrysocolla, pitch limonite, tenorite and bronchantite. They 

occur as fractures lining, as disseminations, and as coatings on plagioclase grains. 

Minor sporadic limonites also occur in the oxide zone. 

 

9.5 LEACHED CAP 

The leached zone is of limited extent and is best developed along the western edge of 

the main mineralization. This zone is characterized by geothite with only a minor 

hematite and jarosite component, sporadic minor boxworks (after both pyrite and 

chalcopyrite), and silicification is dominant over clay components. Copper present in 

the zone is primarily contained in the limonites. In general, copper grade within this 

zone ranges between 0.04% and 0.11% Cu.

9.6 SECONDARY SULFIDE SUPERGENE MINERALIZATION 

The enriched secondary sulfide zone is assumed to be of a supergene origin. It 

extends over an area of 800 m by 400 m trending north-northeast, and extends to the 

west beyond the edge of the oxide mineralization. The enrichment is not well 

developed in the granite porphyry. North to northeast and east-west trending fault 

zones appear to have a strong control on the distribution of the mineralization. This 

structural control is also observed on a smaller scale with the mineralization being 

described as typically associated with faults and fractures. The thickest sections of 

supergene enrichment occur in the north-central and northeast sectors, whereas the 

highest grades are found in the southwest sector in the southern drainage. Higher 

grade supergene-enriched mineralization, grading >0.5% copper, is in general found 

overlying or proximal to zones of enriched hypogene mineralization. Lower-grader 

supergene-enriched mineralization (<0.5% copper) generally occurs either lateral to 

and/or overlying the higher-grade supergene-enriched zones. 

Typical minerals of the enriched secondary sulfide zone are chalcocite, digenite and 

covellite. The chalcocite is described as 'sooty' in the southern area of the deposit, 

and 'steely' in the northern sector. Cuprite and native copper appear to have a limited 

distribution having been identified in the southern (in drill holes DDH-12, SJD-09, 

SJD-12, AR-56 and AR-58) and northern (in drill hole DDH-11) drainage zones, and at 

the summit of the San Jorge Hill.

10.0 EXPLORATION 

As described by AMEC (AMEC, 2007), five exploration programs have been 

completed over the San Jorge Property by five different exploration companies 

namely Aguilar, Falconbridge, RAA, GMA, and Coro (Table 6.1). The exploration 

campaigns were undertaken between 1964 and 2007, and consisted of geological 

mapping, trenching, geophysics, and diamond (DD) and reverse circulation (RC) 

drilling. The drill programs are described in Section 11. 

Trenches constructed by Aguilar and re-sampled by GMA run northwest across the 

outcrop that forms the San Jorge Hill. The area of the trenches has been shown 

through drilling to be partially co-incident with better-developed hypogene, oxide and 

supergene enriched mineralization (see Figure 9.2 to Figure 9.5). The GMA trench 

sampling program defined a copper anomaly approximately 300 m long by up to 100 

m wide, trending north-northeast, and grading 0.3% to 1% total copper. Oxide copper 

analyses indicated a low hypogene and secondary sulfide component. 

Between 1964 and 1998, several IP and magnetic surveys were completed over the 

San Jorge Property, as described by AMEC (AMEC, 2007). Details of this work are 

not repeated in this Technical Report.  

Several untested I.P. and resistivity anomalies occur in the vicinity of the San Jorge 

deposit and these should be reviewed in detail to see if any additional drill targets can 

be outlined.  

In 1997 Quantec carried out a transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey as part of a 

water exploration study, on behalf of GMA. The objectives of the survey were to 

determine the saturated thickness of the subsurface layers, and to define a basement 

depth. The TEM survey was performed by the in-loop sounding method, which 

involved 200 m by 200 m loops positioned along survey lines at 200 m intervals. A 

total of 36.3 km were covered in six lines with 187 soundings.   

Figure 10.1 summarizes the findings of the TEM survey. Basement depths were 

interpreted from the lower resistive strata of the TEM sections and are displayed as 

contours. Thickness and resistivity of the saturated layer are also interpreted. Local

aquifers, which are expected to show resistivities between 30 and 50 Ohm-m, have a 

better development to the east whereas Lines 1 and 2 and the far western part of Line 

4 do not indicate any significant water resource. 

Downwards filtration of river water, meteoric water in the superficial cover, and clay in 

the conductive cover are possible explanations for conductive cover above the 

anticipated saturated level causing, for example, an irregular upper wet-dry interface 

in Line 4 (Quantec, 1997).

11.0 DRILLING 

The resource database contains data from a total of 182 drill holes (30 062.97 m) 

drilled on the San Jorge Property, between 1964 and 2007, by six different 

companies, including Coro. This includes 21 380 m of diamond drilling in 120 drill 

holes, and 8,682 m of reverse circulation drilling in 62 drill holes. In 2008, an 

additional 8 diamond holes were drilled for geotechnical purposes and a further 8 

diamond holes for metallurgical test work. These holes were not incorporated into the 

resource database since, apart from portions of 1 geotechnical holes, they were not 

assayed. The metallurgical holes were not used for metallurgical test work due to the 

suspension of technical work on the project in 2008. A summary of the drill history is 

given in Table 11.1. Resource database drill hole locations are given in Figure 11.1, 

and collar, depth, dip and azimuth data are documented in the NCL resource report 

(NCL, 2008)

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 111 OF 461 

Drilling was concentrated within the San Jorge Segunda mining concession where the 

centre of the known system partially outcrops. Over the main part of the deposit holes 

were drilled on lines spaced roughly 50-100 m apart, at 50 m stations widening up to 

180 m spacing in the more peripheral areas (Figure 11.1). 

The initial 32 diamond drill holes drilled by Aguilar in 1964 to 1968, were primarily 

located to test the central area of mineralisation, although 13 of the holes were 

positioned in outlying areas. Of the 32 holes, 26 were vertical holes, while the other 

six dipped at 55-65° to the southeast.   

Falconbridge drilled four diamond holes in 1973 to 1974, all drilled vertically into the 

southwest sector of the deposit. All of the Aguilar and Falconbridge drill core has been 

discarded and the aluminium core boxes sold for scrap. 

In 1996 GMA summarised the Aguilar and Falconbridge geological and geochemical 

data from the drill logs. GMA noted that the logs for DDH-34 and DDH-37 were 

missing and that DDH-35 was not drilled. Coro has copies of the original logs, 

although the data is not complete and parts are illegible. 

From 1993 to 1995, RAA drilled 45 RC holes and one DD hole into the central area of 

the deposit. Holes were also sited to the north and to the east to test for extensions to 

the mineralisation (Table 11.1 and Figure 11.1). All but four of these holes were drilled 

vertically, the remainder being inclined at 50° to the west, east or northwest.   One of 

the vertical holes, AR-55, was collared to twin diamond drill hole DDH-16 drilled by 

Aguilar. No sample material exists from this drill campaign. 

GMA re-logged 43 of the 45 RC holes using a spoonful of sample chips from each 

sample interval that had been pasted by RAA to boards. The re-logging recorded 

lithology, alteration and mineralisation. Although the lithology and alteration 

descriptions showed a reasonable correlation to the RAA logs, neither the samples 

nor the original logs showed good correlations with the recorded copper grades. Only 

43 of the holes were re-logged, as AR-64 was not included due to its shallow depth 

and AR-59 was excluded because of poor documentation of results. The results from 

drill holes AR-64 and AR-59 were also not included in the resource estimates. 

Lithological, alteration and mineralisation logs exist for the single 140 m DD hole

(DDH-41). RC rejects from the drilling campaign have been lost and were not 

available for review. 

From 1995 to 1996, RAA and GMA drilled 19 DD holes into and around the main area 

of the deposit. Thirteen of the holes were drilled vertically and five holes were drilled 

dipping 70-80° to the northeast, east and west. Comprehensive logs recording 

lithology, alteration, mineralisation, geochemical and geotechnical data exist for these 

drill holes, although no information is available for SJD-13. 

Drill core from holes SJD1 to 19 (excluding SJD 13) and SJD 41 were recovered and 

is now stored on site. All core and RC rejects from previous drilling campaigns has 

been lost. 

GMA drilled on the Property in 1994 to 1996, completing 15 RC holes, all of which 

were drilled vertically. The majority of these drill holes were collared in the periphery 

to the main system. Geological logs exist for the drill holes completed during this 

campaign. 

No information relating to protocols for core handling or security for this drilling was 

supplied. 

In late 2006 and during 2007, Coro completed 58 DD holes over the main part of the 

deposit. Fifteen of these holes (SJ-T-01 to SJ-T-15) were drilled to twin older drilling to 

verify the previous assay results which were unsupported by any QAQC regime. A 

further 16 holes were also drilled as twins, SJ-M-01 to SJ-M-16, and were drilled 

specifically for metallurgical purposes. Finally, 27 holes were drilled mainly to delimit 

the ore and to investigate the primary mineralisation. The results of these holes were 

also used to validate the historic drilling. The core from this campaign is stored on site 

in a covered shed (Figure 11.2).

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Text, figures and tables in this Section were taken from the corresponding part of the 

AMEC's report (AMEC Americas Ltd., 2007) and updated where necessary. 

 

12.1 SURFACE SAMPLING 

Minera Aguilar S.A (1964-1968) cut nine trenches trending northwest to southeast, 

over 949 m into the bedrock over the San Jorge Hill. Samples were taken over 2 m 

intervals for the 794 m length of the trenches that was sampled. No other information 

regarding either the sampling or analyses is available. 

GMA re-sampled six of the trenches that were constructed by Aguilar. Samples were 

taken every two meters. No other information regarding sampling methods or 

protocols is available. 

 

12.2 DRILL CORE AND CHIP SAMPLING 

Sample interval data for the different drill campaigns and core and chip recovery rates 

are summarized in Table 12.1. Subsequent to the drilling carried out by Aguilar, 

sampling was generally either on one or two meter intervals. Overall the reported 

recoveries were good, with occasional moderate recoveries. Only Aguilar reported 

poor recoveries, although it is noted that recoveries improved with time.

Only limited data is available regarding sampling procedures employed for the reverse 

circulation and diamond drill hole programs. The drill chip samples from drill holes AR-

56 through to AR-74, and SJC-01 to SJC-15 were weighed and quartered on site. It is 

also recorded that for drill core from the diamond drill holes SJD-01 to SJD-05, half-

core samples were taken, while for diamond holes SJD-06 through to SJD-19 quarter-

core samples were collected. 

Recursos Americanos Argentinos S.A. (RAA) twinned diamond drill hole DDH-16, 

drilled by Aguilar, with reverse circulation drill hole AR-55. Only limited analytical data 

is available for DDH-16 and therefore a detailed comparison cannot be made between 

the holes. The data that is available for DDH-16 is given in Table 12.2 along with 

comparative data for the same intervals for AR-55.  GMA (1996) surmise that 'if the 

anomalously high results from DDH-16 between 93 m and 100 m are discarded, the 

total copper grades over most of the lengths of these drill holes are within 10% of

each another'. However, data should not simply be discarded. In addition, in the 

absence of any quality control and quality assurance data for these drill holes, it is 

unknown which of the two laboratories is considered reliable. If the data is taken at 

face value, for the interval 34 to 132 m, an overall weighted average calculated for 

DDH-16 is 26% higher for copper than the length weighted average copper grade for 

the same interval in AR-55.

12.3 CORO SAMPLING 

As part of its due diligence process in March 2006, Coro completed a re-assay of half 

core of the leachable portions of SJD-10 and SJD-14. The correlation between the 

originals and re-assays for Total Cu (Figure 12.1) is acceptable with a coefficient of 

correlation of 0.91.

A precision plot of the same data (Figure 12.2) indicates that at the 90th percentile, a 

precision of 27% for SJD-14, which is acceptable and 38% for SJD-10, which is 

questionable. AMEC expressed its concern at these results as the samples were 

analyzed in different labs (probably with differing assay protocols) and the sample set 

is small.

During August to September 2006, Coro commissioned Rojas y Asociados to conduct 

a re-logging and sampling program of the remaining SJD drill core. The logged meters 

and the number of samples taken from each hole are summarized in Table 12.3.

In general and despite the poor state of the core after being re handled several times, 

both the due diligence sampling and the re-logging/re-assaying programs 

demonstrated acceptable correlations between original and check Cu assays. The Au 

assays demonstrated more scatter, commensurate with the sampling method 

(separate half core samples rather than splits of rejects or pulps) and original Au 

distribution.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

Text, figures and tables in this Section were taken from the corresponding part of the 

AMEC's report (AMEC Americas Ltd., 2007) and updated where necessary, except for 

the data adequacy statement required by the Norm. 

 

13.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION 

No data was available pertaining to the laboratory protocols with regard to the 

preparation of samples for either the drill hole or trench sampling campaigns for the 

historical campaigns. Coro's coreholes SJ-01 to SJ-T-15 and SJ-M-01 to SJ-M-16 

were prepared and analyzed at the Alex Stewart facility located in Mendoza, and 

coreholes SJ-IN-01 to SJ-IN-27 were prepared in ALS facilities in Mendoza, 

Argentina, and assayed in La Serena, Chile, all according to generally accepted 

industry standards. 

 

13.2 SAMPLE ANALYSES 

AMEC had no documentation of which laboratory was used by Aguilar.  It is likely that 

Aguilar analyzed all their trench and drill samples from drill holes DDH-01 through to 

DDH-32, at their laboratory in Mendoza.  No records or certificates relating to these 

analyses are known to exist. Every sample was analyzed for Cu, and composite 

samples taken over 5 to 63 m intervals were analyzed for Au, Ag, Ni and Mo and 

occasionally for Zn and Pb. Aguilar is also reported to have collected and analyzed 

sludge samples every 1.5 m during drilling, where there was return. 

Falconbridge analyzed all drill hole samples from holes DDH-33 to DDH-39 at their 

laboratory in Buenos Aires. Every sample interval was analyzed for Cu by AAS. In 

addition, selected zones were analyzed for Au, Mo and As, however, none of these 

results can be located. No quality control sample data was reported. 

Samples from the forty-five reverse circulation drill holes AR-01 to AR-74 and 

diamond drill hole DDH-41 drilled by RAA were analyzed at both the Aguilar and the

SERCOC S.L. laboratories (Table 11.1 and Table 13.1). Every one-meter sample was 

analyzed for total Cu, oxide Cu and Au. SERCOC S.L. (now American Assay or AA) 

used citric acid while the Aguilar laboratory used sulfuric acid during the determination 

of the oxide Cu content of the samples (Table 13.2).

Samples from 19 diamond holes SJD-01 to SJD-19, drilled by RAA and Grupo Minero 

Aconcagua S.A. (GMA) were analyzed at the SGS laboratory in Chile (SGS) (Table 

11.1,Table 13.1and Table 13.2). All the samples were analyzed for total Cu and Au 

every 2 m, for oxide Cu and soluble Cu where relevant, and for Ag and Mo every 40 m 

or approximately every twentieth sample. Although samples for trace element 

analyses were submitted to American Assay (AA) the analyses were actually 

performed by ACME under a contractual agreement between the two laboratories. 

This trace element data was not made available to AMEC. AMEC was also not 

supplied with any check sample data or quality assurance and quality control data for 

this drilling.

Samples from the final reverse circulation drill holes, SJC-01 to SJC-15, drilled by 

GMA were analyzed at both the Bondar Clegg and the SGS Chile laboratories. Each 1 

m sample interval from drill holes SJC-01 to SJC-05 was analyzed for total Cu, Au 

and Ag.  For drill holes SJC-06 to SJC-15, total Cu and Au, and where relevant, oxide 

Cu were obtained for each 2 m sample interval. Trench samples taken by GMA were 

analyzed at the SGS Chile laboratory. No check samples were included in either the 

reverse circulation or trench sample sequence. 

All Coro's diamond drill holes were sampled on a 2 meters continuous basis, with core 

split on site and one half sent to the laboratory. Samples were transported to the 

laboratory by Minera San Jorge personnel who maintained control and custody of 

them. Samples from drill holes SJ-T-01 to SJ-T-15 and SJ-M-01 to SJ-M-16 were 

assayed at Alex Stewart (ASA) laboratory in Mendoza. Samples from drill holes SJ-

IN-01 to SJ-IN-27 were sent to the ALS Chemex preparation laboratory in Mendoza, 

Argentina, and assayed in the ALS Chemex laboratory in La Serena, Chile. Samples 

were prepared using the following standard protocol: crushing to better than 75% 

passing -10 mesh, splitting and pulverizing a 1000 gram subsample to 85% passing -

200 mesh. All samples were analyzed for sequential copper (CuT, CuSol, CuCN) by 

atomic absorption, and for Au by fire assay. A full QA/QC program, involving insertion 

of appropriate blanks, standards and duplicates was employed with acceptable 

results, as detailed in the item 13.4. 

 

13.3 SAMPLE SECURITY 

Information regarding the sample security was taken from the AMEC 2007 report: 

"No reference is made as to sample security during transportation or what (if any) 

procedures were in place to ensure a 'chain of custody' for either the samples from 

the historical drill hole or the trench sampling campaigns." Coro personnel stated that 

samples taken during the Coro drilling campaigns were collected, suitably sealed and 

transported directly to the assay lab by Coro personnel.

13.4 QA/QC 

Coro supplied the quality control data used to check its drilling programs.  

A total of 83 blanks were used, at least one for each batch of samples. No indication 

of cross contamination was found. 

Copper and gold standards were used together with each batch, a total of 68 

standards for gold, and 131 for total copper were used. The variation was considered 

as tolerable, as the following graphs demonstrate. 

A program of duplicates was also put in place, checking the ACME laboratory against 

the ASA laboratory and vice versa. The Graphs depicting the analysis of this 

information is shown in the following pages.  

Considering the reasonable results obtained and also that a significant part of the 

Coro campaign was intended to check the older campaigns, with adequate 

coincidence in terms of mineralized lengths and order of magnitude of the grades, It 

can state that the drilling database is of good quality and adequate for the preparation 

of mineral resource estimate.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

The site visit concentrated on reviewing various surface exposures, access, 

infrastructure and camp facilities. In addition, a few historical documents pertaining to 

the work carried out by Aguilar, Falconbridge, RAA and GMA were perused. 

At present, the historical drill hole database cannot be completely verified and 

reliability be established. For the 37 diamond drill holes completed by Aguilar and 

Falconbridge there is apparently no sample remaining, incomplete analytical data, and 

apparently no quality control information and no analytical certificates. 

For the 19 DD holes drilled by RAA and GMA, there is a complete set of drill logs and 

a near complete set of certificates for the principal elements. However no QAQC data 

was made available for reviewing. 

In total, 60 RC drill holes have been drilled by RAA and GMA. Although some of the 

analytical certificates are present, all analyses were apparently done without any 

quality control samples. 

The trench sample database cannot be verified as there are no remaining reject or 

pulp samples. The samples were analyzed without any quality control samples being 

inserted into the sample stream, and no analytical certificates for these samples were 

supplied. 

Coro geologists created an Excel spreadsheet-format database of the drilling and 

trenching assay results from the available data that contains records from 182 drill 

holes. Assay certificates and drill logs supplied from Coro campaign, were selected a 

sample of five holes and checked the assay results and geological code, without 

noticing any defect. 

It was concluded that the database reviewed is sufficiently free of errors to be used for 

exploration purposes.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

16.1 METALLURGICAL TESTING 

16.1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The metallurgical testwork programs carried out during the pre-feasibility study on San 

Jorge ores have been managed by Coro and generally carried out by SGS Lakefield 

Research Chile (SGS). 

Coro commissioned three series of pilot column testing (4 m and 6 m columns) 

undertaken after curing acid agglomeration characterization of the ore types. At the 

conclusion of the SGS pilot column testwork, leach residue geotechnical testing and 

heap stability modeling was carried out on samples from these columns. 

16.1.2 MINERALIZATION AND ORE TYPES 

The San Jorge copper ± gold porphyry copper system is characterized by both 

repeated fracturing events and influxes of hydrothermal fluids that have resulted in the 

superimposition of hypogene alteration and sulfide mineralization events. Supergene 

alteration and mineralization is superimposed on the hypogene alteration and 

mineralization. 

Five mineralized zones are described by Williams (1996) from the San Jorge Property 

as per Table 16.1.

Each of these five mineralized zones together with an additional hypogene enriched 

category is discussed in more detail in Section 0. 

The San Jorge porphyry system shows a vertical zonation from hypogene 

mineralization at depth, passing upwards into a supergene enriched zone, which is 

overlain by a zone of oxide mineralization and finally by a poorly developed leached 

cap. 

Superimposed on this basic zonation are lateral variations in the distribution of the 

mineralization types that relate to the main north to south and north-northeast striking 

fault zones. The porphyry system is ovoid in shape and covers an area of 1.1 km 

north-northeast by 700 m north northwest. 

16.1.3 METALLURGICAL SAMPLING 

Diamond drill hole samples were used for the testwork at SGS that represented the 

area, lithology and formation of the mineralized bodies of the San Jorge deposit.  

Sample selection considered the preliminary mining schedule with composites 

representing the first two years of production included in the testwork program. 

The drill holes used for the metallurgical testwork were the following:  

• 16 drill holes "SJM" with 994 samples;  

• 14 drill holes "SJT" with 321 samples; and 

• 6 drill holes "SJD" with 37 samples. 

Figure 16.1 shows the location in the San Jorge ore body of the drill holes listed 

above. It also shows the four zones from which the oxide and enriched ore 

composites were formulated for representation of the mineralized body.

16.1.4 METALLURGICAL TESTWORK PROGRAM SUMMARY 

Coro shipped SGS samples from drill cores, each one identified by depth and by 

drilling zone. 

SGS managed the transport and inspection of the samples received. Each one of 

these samples was chemically characterized. With this information plus the geological 

information available from Coro, the composites were prepared. The objective was to 

study the metallurgical behavior in terms of variability and groups of minerals to 

represent development zones, which will be treated according to a Mining Plan, with 

an expected project life of 10 years.

The objective was to determine the basic metallurgical parameters that will provide 

the information needed to continue with the development of the engineering phase of 

the San Jorge project. 

The process flowsheet will consist of crushing, agglomeration, stacking, heap 

leaching, solvent extraction, electrowinning and ancillary facilities. 

Testwork was carried out on both oxide and enriched ores from the San Jorge 

orebody. The metallurgical testwork carried out by SGS was developed in three 

stages: 

Stage 1 - Characterization (Sample Preparation and Chemical Assays); 

Stage 2 - Composite Preparation (Curing and Agglomeration); and 

Stage 3 - Pilot Column (4 m and 6 m) Testing. 

The pilot column testing stage consisted of 17 columns of which 8 were designated to 

be from the more representative zones of the orebody, 5 were from oxide ore and 

represented ore from the first two operating years, and finally 4 were from the 

enriched ore zones to be bacterially leached and represented the first two years of 

enriched ore extraction, which correspond to the 5th and 6th years of the mine life. 

The 17 pilot column tests were planned to assess parameters like: 

• Ore sizes p80 13.3 mm and p80 18.3 mm; 

• Column heights of 4 and 6 meters; and 

• Irrigation rates (10 and 12 L/h/m2) 

The objective of this assessment was to establish the optimum leaching kinetics with 

the associated acid consumption. 

Metallurgical testwork on the pilot columns consists of the following stages: 

• Sample preparation; 

• Sample characterization; 

• Acid consumption test;

• Agglomeration test; and 

• Pilot column test. 

16.1.5 SAMPLE PREPARATION 

All samples were chemically characterized. One quarter of each sample was used for 

the chemical analysis and the rest, based on those results, was sent for metallurgical 

tests. 

For the metallurgical tests, the samples used were those with a total copper grade 

(CuT, %) greater or equal to 0.3%. 

The testing program in large columns also considered the leaching of mineral zones 

and composites, which originated from the definition of the Mining Operation Plan of 

the San Jorge Deposit. For this, the company defined the following criteria for ore 

designation: 

a) Mineralogy mainly oxide type, i.e., samples with a copper grade mostly soluble 
in sulfuric acid. 

Zone 1: Mineral from the North sector of the deposit, superior zone.  

Zone 2: Mineral from the South sector of the deposit, superior zone.  

Zone 3: Mineral from the East sector of the deposit, superior zone. 

Zone 4: Mineral from the West sector of the deposit, superior zone.  

Composite 1: made of mineral samples representing the operation of the deposit 
in years 1 and 2. 

b) Mineralogy mainly enriched type, i.e., samples with a copper grade mostly 
soluble in cyanide. 

Zone 5: Mineral from the North sector of the deposit, inferior zone.  

Zone 6: Mineral from the South sector of the deposit, inferior zone.  

Zone 7: Mineral from the East sector of the deposit, inferior zone. 

Zone 8: Mineral from the West sector of the deposit, inferior zone.

16.1.6 SAMPLE CHARACTERIZATION 

The head assays of the samples are shown in Table 16.2. The Cu (total) and Fe 

(total) assays were determined by a strong acid digestion of the ore, followed by 

Atomic Absorption analysis of the resultant solutions. The "Cu sequential" grade 

corresponds to the copper dissolved in the acid and the cyanide leaches, plus the 

copper assayed in the final residue.

16.1.7 PRELIMINARY METALLURGICAL TESTS FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

Bottles tests at constant pH and agglomeration tests were performed with each one of 

the samples from the zones and composites. 

A. LEACHING TESTS AND ACID CONSUMPTION DETERMINATIONS IN 
AGITATED BOTTLES 

The objective of these tests was to determine the acid consumption and the copper 

dissolution under favorable leaching conditions.  During the test the following were 

controlled: 

• pH: keeping it at 1.5 with additions of sulfuric acid; 

• Bottle weight: keeping it constant by adding water, and  

• Copper extraction kinetics: by taking a sample and sending it to laboratory for 

analysis. 

The summary of the results obtained in these tests for zones 1, 2, 3 and 4 is shown in 

Table 16.3.

The kinetics of copper extraction of the samples from the zones that were done in 

bottles, are shown in Figure 16.2. The total copper extracted based on the head 

calculated after 3 days varied between 81 and 89%.  

The results of total acid consumption in these tests (around 20 kg/t) defined the 

agglomeration tests. The applied criterion was to scan with acid concentrations 

between 15 and 120% of the total consumption.   

The results for the sample of composite-1 made of samples representing year 1 and 

year 2 appear in Figure 16.3 and Table 16.4. 

Two tests were done in bottles in which the variable was the particle size at p80 13.3 

mm and p80 18.3 mm. The test with p80 13.3 mm was done in duplicate. These tests 

had a relative error of 0.12% for the acid consumption and 0.57% for the copper 

extraction. 

The extraction for both sizes was in the order of 86% for the conditions tested. There 

is no significant difference in the copper extraction due to the granulometry of the 

sample. 

The total acid consumption was around 20 kg/t. By using the same criteria for the 

tests with the zones, the agglomeration tests were designed to cover acid 

concentrations higher and lower than the consumption obtained in the bottles.

B. AGGLOMERATION TESTS 

Five agglomeration tests were done for each zone, in which the variable was the dose 

of concentrated sulfuric acid. These tests were done with a 2.5 kg mineral sample 

adding concentrated sulfuric acid and water in small portions and mixing whenever an 

addition of reagents was made. The results of the agglomeration test for zones 1, 2, 3 

and 4 are in Table 16.5 and Figure 16.4. In Table 16.5, cells are marked with yellow 

color to indicate the dose finally selected for each zone.

The maximum copper dissolution was obtained with an acid concentration in the 

agglomeration around 10 to 15 kg/t. A higher acid concentration does not yield greater 

dissolution. Therefore, it was decided to agglomerate the columns with sulfuric acid in 

a concentration between 11 and 13 kg/t. 

The same tests were completed for composite 1. The results are in Figure 16.5 and 

Table 16.6.

Considering that the total acid consumption in the bottles for composite 1 was around 

20 kg/t and that in the agglomeration, the plateau of the copper extraction curve starts 

with 12 kg/t of acid, it was decided to agglomerate the columns of composite 1 with 10 

kg/t of acid. 

C. LEACHING TESTS IN COLUMNS 4 M AND 6 M HEIGHT 

Leaching tests in columns were run with a representative sample of each zone and 

composite.  

The leaching operation in columns can be divided in the following stages: 

• First stage: curing-agglomeration of the charge to a leaching pilot column; 

• Second stage: charge of column and operation of the column irrigation-control; 

and 

• Third stage: discharge and characterization of residues. 

A description of each stage and the results obtained follows.

16.1.8 FIRST STAGE: CURING-AGGLOMERATION OF THE CHARGE TO THE 
LEACHING COLUMN FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

The weight of each column charge, was verified and the sample was placed in the 

agglomeration drum. The addition of reagents was done using a peristaltic pump while 

the agglomerator drum was turning. The acid used was technical grade sulfuric with 

96% purity. 

Table 16.7 shows the agglomeration conditions of zones 1, 2, 3 and 4 and Table 16.8 

shows the agglomeration conditions of Composite 1.

16.1.9 SECOND STAGE: CHARGE OF COLUMNS AND OPERATION OF THE 
IRRIGATION-CONTROL FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

The columns were charged from the top of the column. The columns for zones 1 and 

2 were stopped after 94 days of leaching. The columns corresponding to zones 3 and 

4 were stopped after 73 days of irrigation. After halting the irrigation, the columns 

were drained and later discharged. 

The feeding solution to these columns was a raffinate solution from the preliminary 

testwork on 2 m columns. During the first 18 days, the columns were irrigated in open 

circuit with this raffinate in stock. When enough quantity (about 150 L per column) of 

pregnant solution (PLS) was accumulated, closed circuit irrigation was started using a 

common SX for all of the samples defined as oxides (columns 1 to 4 and columns 9 to 

13). 

Volume control on the columns during the irrigation period was by measuring weight 

and density. Metallurgical balance samples were taken from the incoming solution and 

from the effluent and were analyzed for Cu, Fe(t), Fe(II), H+, pH and Eh. The sampling 

was done daily during the first week, then every two days, later twice a week and 

finally once per week. 

2% of PLS solutions from each column was used as a weekly composite and was 

assayed for Cu(II), Fe, SO4-2, Al, Mn, Mg and Cl-. The metallurgical balances for the 

columns are presented below. The copper extraction is presented as percentage of 

calculated total copper. 

A. RESULTS OF COLUMNS ZONES 1, 2, 3 AND 4 

The results of the columns from the zones are shown in Table 16.9.

With sample Composite-1, for all the variables studied, the final copper extractions 

were near 81%. The net acid consumptions varied between 15 and 19 kg/t for the 6 m 

columns but for the 4 m columns were between 21 and 25 kg/t. 

The feed particle size, as variable, was studied in 6 m columns (Col-9 and Col 10) and 

4 m columns (Col-12 and Col-13). 

With both the 4 m and the 6 m columns the tendency was the same, this is to say, the 

column with finer material (Col-9 and 12) gives a faster copper extraction kinetics with 

respect to the column of equal height but with coarser material (Col-10 and 13). 

The net acid consumption for the 6m columns does not exceed the 4 kg H2SO4/kg Cu 

and for the 4 m columns the acid consumption is 5 kg H2SO4/kgCu. The comparative 

graphs for this variable are provided in Figure 16.10.

It was concluded that the effect of the particle size on the copper extraction kinetics 

was greater in the 4 m columns although there was little difference in kinetics between 

the heights studied. 

The height of the column had no significant effect on the copper extraction with 

differences of around 3%. The larger difference was in the acid consumption, with the 

shorter column giving a net consumption almost double than the longer column (3.8 

and 2.7 kg H+/t Cu, respectively). Figure 16.11 shows the copper extraction and the 

acid consumption in columns with different heights for Composite 1.

The flow rate was the other variable studied with sample Composite-1. The 6 m 

Columns were irrigated with 10 and 12 L/h/m2. This variable had no effect on the 

copper extraction or the acid consumption.  

Figure 16.12 shows the comparison of the results. It may be important to run tests 

with irrigation rates smaller than the one studied to assess the potential for a reduction 

of the acid consumption.

In general the impurities were similar. The main dissolved impurity was iron, which 

ranged from 1.7 to 5.6 g/L Fe(t) over the whole leaching period. 

16.1.10 THIRD STAGE: DISCHARGE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF RESIDUES 
FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

Once the drainage stage was completed and before discharging each column, the 

final height of the mineral bed was measured. The columns did not compact 

significantly as the height differential was generally less than a few centimeters. The 

initial and final heights are shown in Table 16.13.

Each column was discharged in 3 steps with each step taking approximately 1/3 of the 

final height of the column. Each section was weighed and dried in oven at 80°C and 

prepared separately but using the same methodology. Section 3 was the top section 

and section 1 was the bottom section.

The results of the size distribution were consistent with the particle distributions used 

for loading the columns. In Column 3, there was a small deviation between residues 

and head in the coarse fractions. It is possible that this happened due to adhesion of 

fine particles on the coarse ones which are difficult to separate in a dry leached 

residue. Column 4 shows a difference between the distribution of the head and the 

residue, in the fines fractions, and the results also agree quite well among the 

sections.

than the Sections above. The copper grade varied from 0.076% on the top to 0.128% 

in the base for Zone 3 and from 0.096% to 0.126% in the Zone 4. 

The distribution of the head grade indicated that the highest grades were in the fine 

fractions, while this effect was found to be reversed in the residues. In the coarse 

fractions, there was a poorer correlation of the grade, probably because the exposed 

area was very different in the larger fractions. 

B. RESULTS OF THE COLUMNS RESIDUES OF COMPOSITE 1 

The size distribution by Section of the residues from the columns pertaining to the 

Composites has a good correlation, as much between their Sections as with the head 

distribution. The small differences are because the fractions separation in acidic and 

dried residues is difficult to match exactly. This is caused by the fine particles that 

strongly adhere to the coarse ones or, on the other hand, due to the fractures 

produced by chemical diffusion of the particles. The results of these distributions are 

shown in Figure 16.14. 

Table 16.18 to Table 16.22 summarizes the results of the chemical analysis of 

residues from the columns charged with the sample Composite 1.

The residues from zones 3 and 4 (Col-3 and Col-4) show a clear gradient of copper 

concentration with respect to the column section. The grade difference between the 

top and the bottom sections of the columns is 0.05%. In the columns charged with the 

Composite 1, 6 m columns (Col-9, Col-10 and Col-11) have a difference of 0.07% 

between the upper and lower sections. However, in the 4 m columns (Col-12 and Col-

13) the difference between the sections is 0.14%. 

16.1.11 METALLURGY CONCLUSIONS FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

The following conclusions resulted from the testwork:  

• A global analysis of the results for zones 1, 2, 3 and 4 indicated that it was 

possible to extract around 85% of the total copper. The net acid consumption 

is around 20 kg/t for zones 2, 3 and 4, which is a bit higher than for a typical 

copper ore.  This may have been due to the presence of acid consuming 

species from the gangue. The net acid consumption for zone 1 is 23.5 kg/t 

which was much higher than typical. It may be possible to lower the 

consumption by adding less acid in the agglomeration stage, but this will 

cause the kinetics of copper extraction to be slower than those obtained under 

the tested conditions.

• The particle size distributions studied for sample Composite 1 were p80 18.3 

mm and p80 13.3 mm. As expected, copper extraction increases as particle 

size decreases. But, this variable does not have an important effect on the 

copper extraction. The copper extractions, based on the calculated head, were 

81% Cu(t) and 83% Cu(t), respectively. 

• The differences in copper extraction for sample Composite 1, based on the 

calculated head, are minimal between the 4 m and 6 m columns. For example, 

for both columns 9 and 12 the copper extraction is about 5 kg/ton for a passed 

volume of 1 m3/t. This may be due to the fact that being an oxidized material 

it, is altered and with a higher porosity, allowing more diffusion of the acid in 

the rock; 

• The impact on kinetics of the flow rate was studied with sample Composite 1. 

The 6 m Columns were irrigated with 10 and 12 L/h/m2. This variable had no 

effect on the copper extraction or the acid consumption. 

• Significant iron dissolution was observed from the ore samples studied. 

However, it is highly possible that when irrigating the ore with a typical raffinate 

solution containing iron, there will be some initial hydrolysis and part of the iron 

may remain in the ore bed. 

16.1.12 METALLURGY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

SGS recommends that the following be considered when defining further testwork 

programs for the project. 

• It may be advantageous to run tests with irrigation rates lower than those 

studied to evaluate a reduction of the acid consumption. 

• It is advisable to perform a complementary testwork program irrigating the 

columns with a synthetic raffinate solution containing iron, to get a better 

approach of the iron concentration in the steady state plant raffinate solution. It 

would be also advisable to monitor the dissolution of these impurities during 

the complementary testwork program.

• Based on the previous results and discussion, SGS recommends for future 

exploitations of the mineral deposit, to use 6 m height heaps, size distribution 

p80 13.3 mm for the feed sample and a flow rate of 10 L/h/m2. 

 

16.2 OXIDE ORE METALLURGICAL MODELLING 

16.2.1 SUMMARY 

The oxide ore mineralogy is dominated by malachite and chrysocolla. As a result the 

leaching shows two distinct phases: 

• A rinsing of copper dissolved by the agglomeration acid, and 

• A diffusion control regime of slow leaching due to the presence of the 

dominant chrysocolla. 

The acid consumption rate was interpreted for 10 g/L leaching acid. The consumption 

rate was 0.21 kg/t/day for 6.0 m column tests and 0.3 kg/t/day for 4.0 m column tests. 

Due to the low grade and the high acid consumption rate there will be a limit to the 

economic leaching of the ore. This is likely to be in the order of 85% recovery from a 

head grade of 0.56% copper. 

The ore has excellent geotechnical characteristics and should not present any 

significant issue with percolation or stability. 

A model was developed to allow assessment of the leaching response. The 'average' 

case developed by this method was: 

Grade    0.56% 

Recovery   85% 

Leach utilization  95% 

Lift height   6.0 m 

Leach time   115 days 

Bulk density   1.5 t/m3

Leach Flux   2.9 kL/t 

Acid consumption  27.9 kg/t 

The average PLS grade from this leach scenario was 1.6 g/L. A two stage leach with 

an ILS: PLS ratio of 1:1 would give a PLS grade of 3.2 g/L. This PLS grade would be 

suitable for the design of the SX plant. 

At the time of reporting results the following testwork results were not available: 

• Tails size by size analysis; 

• Column retained and advection moisture contents, and 

• Column drain down characteristics. 

The reports made available for this review were: 

• SGS Lakefield Research, January 2008, "Preliminary Final Report 

Metallurgical Test Program, San Jorge Project" Project no 4069; including 

updated laboratory data spreadsheets for oxide ore types only. 

• Excel spread sheet of quantitative QEMSEM analysis, 16th Nov 2007. 

16.2.2 MINERALOGY 

The mineralogical analysis was carried out using QEMSEM quantitative techniques 

The primary leachable copper contained in the oxide enrichment zones of the deposit 

are (in order of abundance)  

• Malachite. 

• Chrysocolla. 

• Cuprite. 

• Minor chalcocite. 

From the mineralogical descriptions the oxide copper should be generally acid soluble 

albeit slowly with the presence of significant Chrysocolla in the ore.

There was little information made available for review; as to the deportment of the 

minerals within the rock mass. The general geological description would seem to 

indicate that the mineralization is fracture and vein controlled but that late silicification 

events will have overprinted the rock defects. As such the copper should be generally 

presented as surface expression on crushed rocks rather than as disseminated within 

the rock mass. The major variation from this will be the leaching of chrysocolla as this 

will have copper values within the silica overprint event that will present possible thick 

occurrences of this slower leaching mineral. 

16.2.3 ANALYSIS OF TESTWORK PROGRAM OUTCOMES 

The test program consisted of two series of column tests undertaken after curing acid 

agglomeration. The samples tested are from four defined oxide zones and a 

composite of the first two years of oxide production. The oxide zones were tested 

under standard conditions while the composite was tested under varying parameters 

to assess their impact on the leaching responses. 

Parameters tested include: 

• Crush size, and 

• Column height. 

All tests were conducted in closed circuit with solvent extraction (SX) to replicate the 

long term solution chemistry that will be experienced.  

The summary of the oxide column test results is provided in Table 16.23.

A. LEACH KINETICS 

The leach kinetics was interpreted using the diffusion controlled model. This model 

has a transformation Tr(R) of the recovery (R) so that if the leaching is diffusion 

controlled at a single 'particle' size, then the recovery shows a straight line against 

time. The time factor is taken as leach flux - kL of solution / tonne ore; as this 

accounts for changes in irrigation rate, bulk density and leached height. 

Other parameters that are included in the model are acid concentration [A] and copper 

grade %Cu. It is thus potentially possible to compare leach rates from different head 

grades and using different acid concentrations. 

The acid added in agglomeration was 10 kg/t. This was sufficient to control the exit pH 

to <3.0 to prevent copper deposition in the columns. 

The recovery (R) information transformed into the diffusion controlled model Tr(R) and 

plotted against applied leach flux is shown in Figure 16.15 the rate of leaching is the 

slope of the curve at any particular point. Note that all recovery data have been 

renormalized based on the recalculated head grade. The recalculated grade is based 

on tails assay grade and copper leached into solution.

There is an initial non-linear decreasing leach rate (slope of the curve), followed by a 

liner and relatively slow leach rate. The acid concentration was constant throughout 

the test work at around 10 g/L. As there were no significant changes in the feed acid 

concentration there are no corresponding changes in the leaching kinetics. 

The curved portion of the Transformed Recovery plot indicates that there is an 

increase in the effective 'particle' size that is being leached. The linear portion of the 

plot indicates that the 'particle' size being leached is constant during this part of the 

leach. Examination of the detailed data for all the leach tests showed that this 

response is typical for all the 6.0 m oxide column tests undertaken. It was also the 

case for all the oxide short column tests undertaken previously. 

Since all the column test show a very similar leach response, the unique leaching plot 

for this ore is a result of the particular mineral assemblage. It is postulated that the 

leaching was being controlled by the presence of significant amounts of chrysocolla in 

the ore.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 168 OF 461 

The slow linear leach rate at the end of the recovery cycle is typical of leaching 

through a low porosity domain with resultant low diffusion rates. Chrysocolla has a 

generally tight silica matrix with porosity in the region of 2% to 5%. This compares 

with the porosity of agglomerates of 15% to 20% where the diffusion rates are much 

higher as a result. The non-linear early portion of the leaching is a combination of 

copper (dissolved by the agglomeration acid – mostly the readily soluble malachite, 

cuprite and azurite) being washed out of the agglomerates and the transition from this 

washing to the chrysocolla matrix diffusion control. Gold heap leaching shows a 

similar non-linear response as it is also a washing process of gold from the 

agglomerates. 

The leaching of the native copper is generally an acid + ferric leach. Examination of all 

the test log sheets shows that the ferric content of the exit solution is high and that the 

Eh is steadily rising through the leach cycle. This indicates that native copper will be 

actively leaching under these conditions. 

The transition point from washing copper from agglomerates; to chrysocolla diffusion 

control leaching will be a function of the proportion of the copper that is present as 

readily soluble species. Thus for similar ore samples there should be a similar 

transition point to liner diffusion controlled leaching. The summary of leach response 

parameters is given in Table 16.23. 

The four oxide samples show a very consistent change to single 'particle' diffusion 

control at a leach flux of 0.38 kL/t. This is replicated in the 12 mm column tests on the 

composite sample of 0.36 kL/t. The two 19 mm column tests show a longer time to 

reach the steady diffusion control of 0.49 kL/t. The larger particles are leaching for 

longer before the leach is controlled by the chrysocolla diffusion. 

The overall copper recovery at which the change in control is complete is the same at 

an average of 61% of total copper. This is further evidence that the rate control is 

similarly independent of crush size, but is controlled by the presence of significant 

proportions of chrysocolla. 

The change in leach rate is very close to that observed for the short column tests; and 

reinforces the conclusions reached from that program.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 169 OF 461 

The diffusion leach rate for the various oxide zones has been normalized for grade. 

This procedure multiples the slope of the linear diffusion leach rate by the copper 

grade to allow direct comparison of leaching from different ore grades. Examination of 

Table 16.23 shows that the four oxide zones have essentially the same normalized 

leach rate of 0.034. 

This it is clear that the oxide ores all leach with the same leach kinetics and can be 

considered as a single ore type. 

This leach rate is slower than under the same test conditions for the composite oxide 

sample (columns 9 & 11) of 0.42. There are no particular reasons for this faster 

leaching in the composite sample than in the individual ore types. However small 

changes in the geotechnical characteristics of the ore can have dramatic effects on 

the diffusion leach rate. Although the rates are significantly different the changes in 

ore geotechnical characteristics are likely to be the underlying driver for the faster 

rate. 

The 19 mm 6.0 m test (column 10) shows a significantly decreased leach rate 

compared to columns 9 & 11, of 0.033 compared to 0.042. The coarser crush has a 

significant effect on slowing the diffusion leach rate. 

The other 19 mm 4.0 m test in column 13 is slower at 0.021 than the same test at 12 

mm of 0.032. Again the coarser crush adversely affects the diffusion leach rate. 

The shorter columns also exhibit slower diffusion leaching than the taller columns. 

Table 16.24: Relationship between Diffusion Rates, Column Height and Particle Size 

Crush (mm) 12  19 

Height (m) Diffusion rate Diffusion rate 
6.0 0.042 0.033 

4.0 0.032 0.021 

The shorter columns are not using all of the acid in the feed solution in the latter part 

of the leach. Some is being discharged. The taller columns however are using all of 

the acid supplied to the columns and are leaching more copper as a result. The 

effective leach rate thus increases with column height.

B. LEACH RECOVERY 

In view of the copper leach kinetics discussed above, the overall recovery seems to 

have limits that are only set by any possible economic limit and the ability to manage 

the PLS grade. The economic limit has been modeled as part of the previous review 

and is discussed there in absolute terms of the copper grade and in relative terms of 

the economic limits as determined by the leach and gangue acid consumption (GAC) 

kinetics and the marginal capital and operating costs of the facility. 

The target marginal economic limit recovery was determined to be 85% of Cu total. 

The same target recovery has been used for modeling in this review. 

C. GANGUE ACID CONSUMPTION 

With the acid concentration consistently at 10 g/L during all the tests, there is a readily 

observable GAC rate as shown in Figure 16.16.

• There is an initial –ve region where copper leached by the agglomerate acid 

addition adds acid back into the system. 

• The GAC is linear with time. 

• GAC is ongoing with time (ie the longer the leach the greater the GAC). 

• There is no information on the dependency of GAC rate on acid concentration 

(due to the consistent level of acid concentration used). 

• The acid added in agglomeration at 10 kg/t is just sufficient to control the exit 

pH at < 3.0 to prevent copper precipitation in the column. 

• There is a GAC0 that reflects the readily soluble gangue that is leached by the 

agglomeration acid. From Table 16.23 it is seen to be very consistent at 

between 4.1 kg/t and 4.5 kg/t. The composite sample showed lower GAC0 

than the individual zones – again indicating that this sample is slightly different 

to the individual zones. 

• The GAC rate for the – ½" oxide tests was 0.21 kg/t/day in 6.0 m columns. 

• The GAC rate for the -¾" oxide tests was 0.20 kg/t/day in 6.0 m columns. 

• The GAC rate for the – ½" oxide tests was 0.30 kg/t/day in 4.0 m columns. 

• The GAC rate for the -¾" oxide tests was 0.32 kg/t/day in 4.0 m columns. 

The acid consumptions are based on the following parameters: 

• 10 kg/t added in agglomeration; 

• 10 g/L in leachate; and 

• Little free acid in PLS with a pH of around 2.0. 

The overall leach recovery and acid consumption interact to display the limit to 

economic leach recovery is very likely to be set by the GAC rate and slow diffusion 

controlled leach rate. This is discussed in more detail in the following section. 

D. GEOTECHNICAL ASPECTS

The bulk densities (dry) of all the oxide column tests are quite consistent across all 

column heights. 

• The initial bulk density of the 6m and 4.0 m columns is 1.5; 

• The overall slump is very low at significantly less than 1%; 

• The fines content is very low with 16% - 10# (1.78 mm) in all the -½" (-12 mm) 

samples; and 

• Agglomerate moisture addition was between 2% and 4% w/w which is a 

reflection of the low fines content. 

No permeability rate test results have been made available to date. 

The bulk density indicates a void fraction of 44% in the agglomerated ore. 7% w/w 

moisture is equivalent to 8.5% of the void space occupied by the moisture. Thus the 

saturation of the voids is very low. This also shows that there is likely to be little 

trouble leaching this ore from a geotechnical standpoint. 

E. SOLUTION DRAIN DOWN CHARACTERISTICS 

The solution drain down characteristics has not been considered for this report. 

16.2.4 LEACH PLANNING MODEL FOR OXIDE MINERALIZATION 

A. MODEL SUMMARY

remaining years.

B. MODELLING THE LEACHING 

The leaching was modeled with a combination of: 

• Agglomerate wash out recovery up to 60% recovery; 

• Particle matrix diffusion control from 60% upwards; 

• An acid consumption rate that is linear with time through the whole leach 

cycle, and 

• An agglomerate acid addition rate that is just sufficient to control exit PLS pH. 

A scale up factor has been used on the leach rates to account for the differences 

between nearly ideal column tests and non-ideal actual field results that can be 

expected. This scale up factor is applied to the time for leaching and is equivalent to 

an extra 50%. 

C. SCALE UP 

The scale up method used in this work is based on selecting the combined effect of 

various parameters on the underlying diffusion leach rate. If appropriate, a recovery 

cut off is applied if an acid consumption economic limit is identified. 

 

16.3 ENRICHED ORE METALLURGICAL MODELING 

16.3.1 SUMMARY 

The enriched ore mineralogy is chalcocite dominant. As a result the leaching shows 

two distinct phases: 

• A rinsing of copper dissolved by the agglomeration acid, and 

• A diffusion control regime of leaching from the acid ferric system. 

The acid consumption rate has been interpreted for 10 g/L leaching acid. The 

consumption rate is 0.15 kg/t/day for 6.0 m column tests and 0.19 kg/t/day for 4.0 m 

column tests.

Due to the low grade and the relatively high acid consumption rate there is a limit to 

the economic leaching of the ore. This is likely to be in the order of 85% recovery from 

a head grade of 0.56% soluble copper. 

The ore has excellent geotechnical characteristics and should not present any 

significant issue with percolation or stability. 

A model has been developed to allow assessment of the leaching response. The 

'average' case developed by this method is: 

Grade Cu sol   0.56 % 

Recovery   85 % 

Leach utilization  95 % 

Lift height   6.0  m 

Leach time   130  days 

Bulk density   1.5  t/m3 

Leach flux   3.3  kL/t 

Acid consumption  24.5  kg/t 

The average PLS grade from this leach scenario is 1.4 g/L. A two stage leach with an 

ILS: PLS ratio of 1:1 would give a PLS grade of 2.9 g/L. This PLS grade would be 

suitable for the design of the SX plant. 

Further results are yet to be made available as the column tests are ongoing: 

• Recovery based on tail and solution assay (back-calculated head); 

• Tails size by size analysis; 

• Column retained and advection moisture contents, and 

• Column drain down characteristics. 

The reports made available for this review were:

Enriched Columns up to Feb 25 2008. 

• Excel spread sheet of quantitative QEMSEM analysis, 16th Nov 2007. 

16.3.2 MINERALOGY 

The mineralogical analysis was carried out using QEMSEM quantitative techniques. 

The primary leachable copper, contained in the enriched zones of the deposit are (in 

order of abundance)  

• Chalcocite; 

• Chalcopyrite; 

• Cuprite, and 

• Minor chrysocolla and covellite. 

From the mineralogical descriptions the enriched copper should be generally acid / 

ferric soluble except for the chalcopyrite. 

There was little information made available for review as to the deportment of the 

minerals within the rock mass. The general geological description would seem to 

indicate that the mineralization is fracture and vein controlled but that late silicification 

events will have overprinted the rock defects. As such the copper should be generally 

presented as surface expression on crushed rocks rather than as disseminated within 

the rock mass. 

16.3.3 TESTWORK PROGRAM OUTCOMES 

The current report is based on tests that are still ongoing and may be subject to 

confirmation from final closure results. 

The current test program consisted of two series of column tests undertaken after 

curing acid agglomeration. The samples tested are from four defined enriched zones 

and a composite of the first two years of enriched production. The individual zones 

were tested under standard conditions while the composite was tested under varying 

parameters to assess their impact on the leaching responses.

Parameters tested included: 

• Crush size; 

• Column height, and 

• Agglomeration acid addition. 

All tests were conducted in closed circuit with solvent extraction (SX) to replicate the 

long term solution chemistry that will be experienced.  

The summary of the enriched ore column test results is provided in Table 16.26.

A. LEACH KINETICS 

One of the issues that was apparent in preliminary test program was that the acid 

added in agglomeration was in excess of that needed for pH control in the exit leach 

solution. As a result, in this series of tests, the acid added in agglomeration was 

reduced to 2 kg/t. This was not sufficient to control the exit pH to <2.5 to prevent 

copper deposition in the columns. The total acid consumption when the solution pH 

finally dropped below 2.5 was generally in the region of 8 kg/t. 

The recovery (R) information transformed into the diffusion controlled model Tr(R) and 

plotted against applied leach flux for column 5 is shown in Table 16.26. The rate of 

leaching is the slope of the curve at any particular point. Note that all recovery data 

has been renormalized based on the sequential assay soluble head grade. The 

recalculated grade based on tails assay grade and copper leached into solution will be 

used in the final analysis to more closely determine the leachable head grade.

There is an initial non-linear increasing leach rate (slope of the curve), followed by a 

linear leach rate. The acid concentration was constant throughout the test work at 

around 10 g/L. As there were no significant changes in the feed acid concentration 

there are no corresponding changes in the leaching kinetics.

The curved portion of the Transformed Recovery plot indicates that there is an 

increasing diffusion leach rate. The linear portion of the plot indicates that the 'particle' 

size being leached is constant during this part of the leach. Examination of the 

detailed data for all the leach tests in the Appendix shows that this response is typical 

for all the 6.0 m enriched column tests undertaken. The level of acid added to the 

agglomeration was not sufficient to satisfy the initial gangue acid consumption 

(GAC0). As a result the leaching is acid addition controlled (stoichiometric control) and 

a non-linear, increasing diffusion response is shown in the diffusion control leach rate.  

Since all the column test show a very similar leach response, the unique leaching plot 

for this ore is a result of the particularly low acid addition to the agglomerates.   

The linear leach rate at the end of the stoichiometric control is typical of leaching 

through a porous domain with resultant constant diffusion rates. 

The transition point from stoichiometric control; to diffusion control leaching will be a 

function of the amount of acid added to the agglomeration step. Thus for similar ore 

samples there should be a similar transition point to linear diffusion controlled 

leaching. The summary of leach response parameters is given in Table 16.26. 

The four enriched ore samples show a very consistent change to single 'particle' 

diffusion control at a leach flux of 0.60 kL/t. This is replicated in the 12 mm x 6.0 m 

column tests on the composite sample of 0.60 kL/t. The 4.0 m column tests show a 

'longer' stoichiometric control period of 0.7 kL/t. This is an artifact of the column height 

difference. The one 19 mm column test with 4 kg/t of acid addition did not show a 

longer time to reach steady diffusion control.   

The overall copper recovery at which the change in control is complete is the same at 

an average of 41% of soluble copper. However there is a wide range of recoveries 

and no firm conclusions can be drawn on this parameter.   

The diffusion leach rate for the various enriched ore zones has been normalized for 

grade. This procedure multiplies the slope of the linear diffusion leach rate by the 

copper grade to allow direct comparison of leaching from different ore grades.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 181 OF 461 

Examination of Table 16.26 shows that the four enriched ore zones have a wide range 

of normalized diffusion leach rates between 0.015 and 0.071. 

Thus it is clear that the enriched ore ores all leach with different leach kinetics and can 

not be considered as a single ore type. 

The average leach rate of 0.43 is similar to that from the same test conditions for the 

composite enriched ore sample (columns 14 & 16) of 0.44. 

The 19 mm 6.0 m test (column 15) shows a significantly decreased leach rate 

compared to columns 14 & 16, of 0.033 compared to 0.044. The coarser crush has a 

significant effect on slowing the diffusion leach rate. 

The shorter columns also exhibit slower diffusion leaching than the taller columns 

(Table 16.27). 

Table 16.27: Diffusion Leach Rates for Columns 

Crush (mm) 12 19 

Height (m) Diffusion Leach Rate Diffusion Leach Rate 
6.0 0.044 0.033 

4.0 0.032 - 

The shorter columns are not using all of the acid in the feed solution in the latter part 

of the leach. Some is being discharged. The taller columns however are using all of 

the acid supplied to the columns and are leaching more copper as a result. The 

effective leach rate thus increases with column height. 

B. LEACH RECOVERY 

In view of the copper leach kinetics discussed above, the overall recovery seems to 

have limits that are set only by any possible economic limit and the ability to manage 

the PLS grade. The economic limit has been modeled as part of the previous review 

and is discussed there. 

• In absolute terms of the copper grade; and 

• In relative terms of the economic limits as determined by the leach and GAC 

kinetics and the marginal capital and operating costs of the facility.

The target marginal economic limit recovery was determined to be 85% of Cu sol. The 

same target recovery has been used for modeling in this review. 

C. GANGUE ACID CONSUMPTION 

With the acid concentration consistently at 10 g/L during all the tests, there is a readily 

observable GAC rate as shown in Figure 16.18.

The points to note are that: 

• There is no initial –ve region as shown by the oxide tests with higher (10 kg/t) 

acid addition to agglomeration. 

• The GAC is linear with time. 

• GAC is ongoing with time (i.e. the longer the leach the greater the GAC). 

• There is no information on the dependency of GAC rate on acid concentration 

(due to the consistent level of acid concentration used). 

• The acid added in agglomeration at 2 kg/t is not sufficient to control the exit pH 

at < 3.0 in the column.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 183 OF 461 

• There is a GAC0 that reflects the readily soluble gangue that is leached by the 

agglomeration acid. From Table 16.26 is seen to be very consistent at 

between 1.9 kg/t and 3.6 kg/t. The composite sample showed slightly higher 

average GAC0 than the individual zones. 

• The GAC rate for the – ½" enriched ore tests was 0.122 kg/t/day in 6.0 m 

columns. 

• The GAC rate for the -¾" enriched ore tests was 0.138 kg/t/day in 6.0 m 

columns. 

• The GAC rate for the – ½" enriched ore tests was 0.194 kg/t/day in 4.0 m 

columns. 

The acid consumptions are based on the following parameters: 

• 2 kg/t added in agglomeration; 

• 10 g/L in leachate; and 

• Little free acid in PLS with a pH dropping from > 3.0 to 2.0. 

The overall leach recovery and acid consumption interact to display that the limit to 

economic leach recovery is very likely to be set by the GAC rate and slow diffusion 

controlled leach rate.  This is discussed in more detail in the following section; 

D. GEOTECHNICAL ASPECTS 

The bulk densities (dry) of all the enriched ore column tests are quite consistent 

across all column heights: 

• The initial bulk density of the 6m and 4.0 m columns is 1.4 to 1.55; 

• The overall slump is very low at significantly less than 1%; 

• The fines content is not reported as yet; and 

• Agglomerate moisture addition was between 2% and 4% w/w which is a 

reflection of low fines content. 

No permeability rate test results have been made available to date.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 184 OF 461 

The bulk density indicates a void fraction of 44% in the agglomerated ore. 7% w/w 

moisture is equivalent to 8.5% of the void space occupied by the moisture. Thus the 

saturation of the voids is very low. This also shows that there is likely to be little 

trouble leaching this ore from a geotechnical standpoint. 

E. SOLUTION DRAIN DOWN CHARACTERISTICS 

The solution drains down characteristics have not yet been provided for review.

A. MODELLING SUMMARY 

The parameters selected for use in the following leach modeling have been drawn 

from the average values determined in the data analysis. Some ranges have also 

been investigated to determine if there are any specific significant effects from them.

• Particle matrix diffusion control from 40% upwards; 

• An acid consumption rate that is linear with time through the whole leach 

cycle; and 

• An agglomerate acid addition rate that is just sufficient to control exit PLS pH.

A scale up factor has been used on the leach rates to account for the differences 

between nearly ideal column tests and non-ideal actual field results that can be 

expected. This scale up factor is applied to the time for leaching and is equivalent to 

an extra 50%. 

C. SCALE UP 

The scale up method used in this work is based on selecting the combined effect of 

various parameters on the underlying diffusion leach rate. If appropriate a recovery 

cut off is applied if an acid consumption economic limit is identified. 

 

16.4 MINERAL PROCESS DESIGN 

The processing facility proposed for the San Jorge Project has been designed to treat 

up to 6.3 million t/y of a mixed oxide/sulfide ore (predominantly malachite, chrysocolla 

and chalcocite ore) to produce 25,000 t/y of LME Grade A cathode copper.  

The overall processing scheme consists of the following: 

• Crushing which will reduce the ROM ore to a p80 of approximately 13 mm in a 

three-stage open circuit crushing plant. The crushing plant will also be able to 

produce liner protection material from suitable waste or low grade ore; 

• Ore railway transport from crushed ore stock in San Jorge site to processing 

plant in San Juan. 

• Agglomeration, which will assist stabilization of fines in the heap and also 

allow the intimate mixing of sulfuric acid and raffinate with the ore; and 

• Agglomerated ore delivery by truck (20 tons of capacity) and stacking using a 

radial stacker; 

• Heap leaching will be carried out in a two-stage operation where raffinate from 

the SX Plant and Intermediate Leach Solution (ILS) will be used to irrigate ore.  

Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) containing copper as well as iron and other 

impurities will be delivered to the SX Plant, which includes the following areas:

• Solvent extraction, where the PLS and electrolyte from the Electrowinning 

Plant are contacted with an organic extractant that selectively transfers copper 

from PLS to electrolyte and increases its concentration in the process.  

Raffinate (aqueous solution with low copper) will be returned to the leach 

circuit; 

• Electrowinning, where a direct electrical current is applied to the circulating 

electrolyte in cells containing multiple lead anodes and stainless steel cathode 

mother plates. Oxygen is formed at the PbO2 anode and copper metal is 

plated on the stainless steel mother-plates. This copper deposit will be 

stripped from the cathode mother plates and bundled and strapped for sale; 

• Sulfuric acid production using a sulfur burning acid plant; 

• Reagent storage, preparation and distribution of reagents such as sulfuric 

acid, diluent, cobalt sulfate and guar; and 

• Plant services which include a compressed air system and a hot water heating 

system. 

The overall processing scheme is shown in Figure 16.19.

The crushed ore will be agglomerated with raffinate and sulfuric acid in a agglomeration 

drum, with agglomerated ore trucked to the leach pad and placed in 6 m high lifts using a 

radial stacker. 

The radial stacker will place agglomerated ore in 12 panels approximately 82.5 m wide and 

605 m long. A single leach pad some 990 m long and 630 m wide will be stacked with 10 x 6 

m lifts to place the 48.4 Mt of ore over the life of the mine. 

A conventional two stage leach has been proposed for the San Jorge Project in order to 

maintain the Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) copper concentration of ~ 4 g/L needed to 

achieve copper cathode production of 25,000 t/y. 

Recovery of 85% of total copper in oxide ore and 66% of total copper in enriched ore during 

two-stage leach has been used in the design of the leach circuit. No contribution to ultimate 

recovery has been allowed for as a result of indirect irrigation by solution applied to overlying 

ore lifts. 

Intermediate Leach Solution (ILS) and then raffinate will be applied to crushed ore and the 

resultant Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) collected via drainage coil underlying the heap for 

delivery to the PLS pond. 

PLS will be pumped from the PLS pond to the Solvent Extraction (SX) Plant which will consist 

of a single train of three conventional mixer-settlers arranged in a series configuration (2E x

1S). All mixer settlers are designed with an O:A ratio of 1:1. Provision has been made to add 

an additional mixer settler and reconfigure the circuit to a series-parallel (2E x 1EP x 1S) 

arrangement if the design net PLS grade cannot be maintained. 

The Electrowinning (EW) Plant is an ISA Process design which uses permanent stainless 

steel mother plates as cathodes. An overhead crane and a semi-automatic cathode stripping 

machine will be installed for material handling duty. The EW Plant will contain 90 cells to 

meet the nameplate capacity of 25,000 t/y of cathode.

The program from the GSLIB library was used for the geo-statistical calculation.  

GEMCOM software was used for the generation of block model and interpolation of 

grades. The final model and database are available in GEMCOM and ASCII format. 

 

17.2 AVAILABLE INFORMATION 

The basic information for this study was provided by Coro and consisted of a drilling 

database, with the following major information: 

• Identification of 182 drill holes with UTM coordinates of collars, total length, 

Interval, Dip and Azimuth;  

• Samples with intervals from and to, analyses of total (CuT %), Cu sequential 

(CuS, Conc. y Cu Residual), Au and type of mineralization (Oxide, Enriched 

and Primary); 

• 16 sections East-West, each 50m apart, with the interpretation of mineralized 

zones (Oxide, Enriched and Primary), and 

• Results of 133 specific gravity measurements. 

Details of available information are presented below.

17.2.2 GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION 

Coro has provided the geological interpretation of the zones according to the type of 

mineralization, through a set of 16 sections E-W, spaced 50 m apart, which cover the 

entire deposit. The three zones of interest were Oxide, Enriched and Primary. 

Using the supplied interpreted sections, solids were generated for each zone of 

interest. In conjunction with the Coro geologists, the preliminary solids were smoothed 

with intermediate sections each 12.5 m, with the objective of securing the 3D 

consistency of each body and avoiding solid superposition. With the 16 major sections 

and intermediate sections, three final solids were generated through extrusions of 

12.5 m to each side. The group of solids was checked for validity, stability and 

consistency. 

Table 17.2 presents the codes utilized by Coro, for the interpretation of the models.

No significant differences between both types of codification in any of the elements 

under analyses were observed. Only in the case of CuS and CuCN was some transfer 

from high samples values observed between the population of oxide and enrichment, 

probably because of the effects of the border, during the construction of the solids.

For each composite with sequential analyses of Copper, the ratio of soluble copper 

(CuS/CuT) and leachable copper ((CuS+CuCn)/CuT) were calculated. Such variables 

were utilized in the estimation. The basic statistics of these variables by mineralization 

population are shown in the Table 17.10 to Table 17.11.

Even though the Oxide-Enriched contact shows a smooth limit relating to total copper, 

the analyses using soluble and leachable copper shows an abrupt limit between these 

units. Therefore, for consistency, hard borders boundaries were utilized between each 

mineralization type for all estimations.

17.6 VARIOGRAPHY – CALCULATION AND ADJUSTMENT OF VARIOGRAMS 

The variography has been accomplished for the CuT and Au for Oxide, Enriched and 

Primary zones, using Correlograms. These were calculated for distinct direcctions 

according to visual tendencies: no preferential directions were detected in the 

horizontal plane of the population of Oxide and Enriched, whereas in Primary 

mineralization slight differences have been detected between N-S and E-W directions. 

Downhole Correlograms were used to determine the nugget effect. Table 17.13 to 

Table 17.15 shows the parameters of the Correlograms which have been adjusted 

according to the defined directions.

Using the interpretation of the Oxide, Enriched and Primary, the respective models 

were generated, assigning the codes defined per each block of the model, using the 

intersection of the blocks and the respective solids. According to the blocks and the 

definition of the populations, a final model was generated with a unique code per each

17.8 KRIGING STRATEGY AND CRITERIA OF CATEGORISATION 

Grades of CuT and Au were estimated f in GEMCOM using Ordinary Kriging. 

Seven Kriging runs executed, in sequential order. The general concept was to fill the 

grade model using a series of search ellipses, which expanded from a base of 85% of 

the variogram sill (The distance, were correlogram reached the value equivalent to 

85% of the sill, is dominated D85). 

The Kriging plan is shown in Table 17.19.

Each population of blocks is estimated with samples of the same population. Capping 

was not utilized it was assumed that outliers would be smoothed by the large number 

of composites utilized in the estimation. 

The utilized D85 in each population, are presented in Table 17.20

Au – Enriched 35 35 20 
Au – Primary 30 30 55 

Grades of CuS and CuCN were not been estimated directly. The final models of CuS 

and CuCN were estimated from the model of CuT and the estimation of the solubility 

ratios CuS/CuT and (CuS+CuCN)/CuT. These variables are more stable and present 

lower variability. Consequently, this approach avoids a common error which is 

generated when estimation for variables CuT, CuS and CuCN are undertaken with 

differing numbers of samples and Kriging runs, frequently resulting in solubility ratios 

greater than 1. The advantage of the present method is that all blocks have solubility 

ratios between 0 and 1. 

Models of CuS/CuT and (CuS+CuCN)/CuT were generated by the inverse distance 

squared method. Both estimations have utilized 4 and 32 composites.

17.10 CLASSIFICATION OF RESOURCES 

The classification of resources has been undertaken according to the number and 

location of samples in the neighborhood of each block. This criterion meets the 

requirements established at the CIM code. 

The first pass generats block estimates with a minimum of two drill intercepts, both 

within distances shorter than the D85 (distance corresponding to the point where the 

correlogram reaches 85% of the sill). The second pass maintaines the restriction on 

the number of drill intercepts, but enlarged the search range by twice the D85. The 

third pass the same search range as pass 2, but reduces the minimum number pof 

pomposities and the number of octans criteria (Table 17.21). These three passes 

generate the Measured and indicated Resources ("demonstrated resources").  

Only the pass 1 generates measured resources. To separate Measured and Indicated 

resources in this pass, the Kriging Variance was utilized, since this parameter, in 

some way, indicates the error of estimation for each block. For this separation a 

threshold of 0.5 was used.  Finally, all the blocks estimated in the Passes from 4 to 7, 

were categorized as inferred.  

The scheme for categorization of resources is summarizes in Table 17.23.

6 5 x D85 2 Inferred Inferred 
7 5 x D85 1 Inferred Inferred 

The category codes utilized the model are: 1= Measured, 2= Indicated and 3 Inferred. 

 

17.11 RESOURCE MODEL VALIDATION 

The model was validated using three different methods, as follows:

• Visual validation; 

• Statistical validation, and 

• Moving window analysis. 

17.11.1 VISUAL VALIDATION 

Some plan views and vertical sections of the block model were selected and the 

grades of the blocks and the drill holes have been compared. Also, the resource 

classification was assessed comparing the existing information. Examples are 

presented in Figure 17.22 to Figure 17.27.

17.11.2 STATISTICAL VALIDATION 

The grades of composites and blocks have been compared statistically (Table 17.24 

to Table 17.27). The following tables present a comparison of the basic statistic of 

composites and blocks per population. Also included in the comparison table are the 

de-clustered grades, obtained using the nearest neighbors method.

It is concluded that the estimation generated robust results, from a statistical point of 

view. The differences between mean grades and de-clustered mean grades are 

generally low (+- 1 to 2%) in the populations of higher grades. The major differences 

(higher than 10%) are produced in the populations with lower, with no economic 

significance. 

17.11.3 MOVING WINDOW ANALYSIS 

For the moving window analyses of the block model, the mean and the de-clustered 

mean of the samples has been studied and compared with the block results (Figure 

17.28 to Figure 17.30).

All moving windows graphs have been calculated using the Measured and Indicated 

resources. In general, the estimated mean behaves in a satisfactory way, similarly 

with the declustered mean. Excessive smoothing is not observed. Generally, the 

declustered grades are lower than the mean samples when the differences between 

them are higher. Moreover, declustered grades are normally situated between them 

and closer to the declustered mean. From moving window and trends of presented 

grades, it is concluded that the model of estimated grades preserves the characteristic 

of the original samples (mean grade, global variability and trends). 

 

17.12 MINERAL RESOURCES

18.0 MINING METHODS 

18.1 INTRODUCTION 

All aspects related to mining in the current study correspond to an unchanged version 

of the work carried out by NCL Ingenieria y Construccion Ltda in the context of the 

Technical Report developed by Ausenco in May 2008. 

Since Ausenco's Prefeasibility Study was published in May 2008, the economic 

parameters concerning operating costs and copper price have changed significantly. 

The operating costs have increased due to escalation of labour cost, diesel, power, 

consumables and materials, plus the additional transport cost resulting of the currently 

proposed location of the process plant 22 km away from the mine. At the same time, 

the copper prices have also increased significantly, compensating the upward trend of 

the operating cost. 

The technical parameters of the project remained unchanged compared to Ausenco's 

Study, except for the location of the Heap Leach operation which has been moved 

22km away from the mine, as mentioned above.  

 Due to the above changes on the economic parameters, NCL carried out an analysis 

of the validity of the open pit design and mine plan reported in Ausenco's May 2008 

Study, and concluded that all those elements are valid under the conditions of the 

current study. The main conclusions of the analysis is that the increases on the 

operating costs are offset by the increase on the copper price, to the extent that the 

selected pit from a whittle exercise run using the current parameters is virtually 

identical to the pit selected on the 2008 Study.  

The mentioned analysis is shown in chapter 18.4.2 of the current report. 

 

18.2 OBJECTIVE 

The objectives of the mining study are to define an optimized long term mine plan for 

the exploitation of the oxides and secondary enrichment ores, for treatment in a heap 

leach - SX-EW plant.

18.3 DESCRIPTION OF MAIN ACTIVITIES 

The following activities were carried out as part of the mine study: 

• Basic data collection and modeling; 

• Mineable resource analysis; and 

• Long term mine planning, including capital and operating cost estimation. 

 

18.3.1 BASIC DATA COLLECTION AND MODELING 

The following data was collected, modeled within the design and planning software 

used at this stage (Gemcom, Whittle 4X, PlanInt) and checked for consistency prior to 

the start of the mineable reserves definition stage: 

• Surface topography;  

• Resource block model with rock types, density, CuT, CuS and CuCN grades, 

etc, estimated by NCL (Mineral Resource Model Update for San Jorge 

Copper-Gold Deposit, Mendoza, Argentina NCL, February 2008); 

• Metallurgical parameters, provided by Coro, and 

• Slope angles for the design of the pit. Preliminary input provided by Coro, and 

preliminary assessment of the final pit carried out by E- Mining Technology. 

18.3.2 MINEABLE RESOURCE ANALYSIS 

In the Technical Report developed by Ausenco in May 2008, according to CIM 

Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, NCL was unable to quote mineral 

reserves for the Project due to the current legislation in the Province of Mendoza 

which prohibits the use of toxic substances (including sulfuric acid which is required in 

heap leaching of copper ore). 

In an effort to resolve the issue of the ban on use of sulfuric acid in Mendoza, this 

study report shows that a viable project can be achieved by constructing an SX/EW

heap leach plant outside of the province of Mendoza at a distance of 20 km in the pro-

mining province of San Juan. According to Coro´s legal opinion, there is no legal 

impediment to transport ore between the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan, or to 

implement a Heap leach, SX/EW process plant in the province of San Juan. 

Therefore, relying in Coro´s legal opinion, NCL is now able to report mineral reserves 

under CIM Standards on Mineral Reserves for San Jorge Leach Project.  

The reserves exercise included the analysis of all the potential reserves in the deposit, 

and covered the following items: 

• Total reserves inventory for open pit mining (tonnage - grade curves), 

calculated using Whittle 4X optimizing program; 

• Final pit selection;  

• Definition of the open pit economic mining sequence through the selection of 

mining phases based on the Whittle 4X series of mining envelopes; and 

• Mineral reserves analysis for open pit mining. 

 

18.3.3 LONG TERM MINE PLAN 

This activity considered the elaboration of long term mine plans, within the limits of the 

previous analysis, to be used as a base for cash flow evaluation. At this level, the 

study included: 

• Operational final pit design, including the ramps layout; 

• Operational mining phase design, with the same level of detail of the final pit; 

• Definition of cut-off grade; 

• Long term mine production schedules reported with the detail of tonnages and 

grades of all the different materials produced per annual periods (the first year 

was scheduled in monthly periods and years two and three in quarters); 

• Analysis of haulage profiles, defining the best route per phase, bench and type 

of material and calculation of transport cycles;

• Mine unit operation analysis (drilling, blasting, loading, hauling and ancillary 

equipment) and equipment selection for each one of them, aiming to optimize 

the productivity and minimize the mine cost; 

• Equipment fleet estimate, according to detailed calculation of hours required 

per period and performance of the different unit operations; 

• Mine services analysis (workshops, etc.); 

• Mine manpower estimate; 

• Mine operating costs estimate per unit operation, and 

• Mine capital cost estimate including initial capital and replacement of 

equipment. 

 

18.4 ANALYSIS OF MINERAL RESERVES 

18.4.1 MAY 2008 OPEN PIT OPTIMIZATION  

18.4.1.1 MINE DESIGN METHODOLOGY 

A standard methodology for the definition of the pit limits and determination of the 

mining sequence was followed. This methodology is commonly accepted in the mining 

industry. 

The main steps in the applied planning process are shown in Figure 18.1, "Planning 

Process Diagram". The methodology can be summarized as follows: 

• Economic ultimate pit limits were calculated using the Whittle 4X software 

package. This software applied the Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm for definition 

of optimal envelopes. A series of nested envelopes for a given series of 

copper price (or revenue factors) was produced.  

• Practical design of the ultimate pit was carried out using a Gemcom package. 

• The economic extraction sequence was established using the Whittle 4X 

series of optimum envelopes as guidance.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 231 OF 461 

• Practical design of mining phases was performed with the same tools used for 

the final pit design. 

• Mine production scheduling was carried out with the use of a NCL specialized 

scheduling program. This program controls all operational restrictions and 

reports all the details of the plan. End-of-year photos were then produced with 

the same package. 

• Equipment fleet was estimated from the mine production schedules, 

performance and operational indices of the main equipment, and using factors 

related to the main equipment for the auxiliary units. A spreadsheet model was 

created for estimation of operating hours and number of units required. 

Hauling distances were obtained from the mine plan. This model was also 

used to calculate equipment procurement schedules, manpower, capital 

expenses and operating costs. 

• Standards applied in the industry according to the size of the operation and the 

equipment selected were used to ensure a safe and productive operation for 

personnel, equipment and installations. 

Equipment and manpower productivity were estimated according to NCL experience 

and industry standards for the size of the equipment and mine production rate.

18.4.1.2 INPUT DATA 

This section deals with the definition of the technical and economic input parameters 

for the estimation of the final optimum limits for the San Jorge pit.  

The ore resource model used in the Mine Study is the Resource Model estimated by 

NCL in Section 17.0.  

The main characteristics of the block model are summarized in Table 18.1: Model 

Dimensions. 

Table 18.1: Model Dimensions 

 

Mine topography was provided by Coro as used for the NCL block model. 

Table 18.2: Insitu Density summarizes the insitu density values were used for the 

different domains.

Optimum ultimate pit limits were calculated using the Whittle 4X packages. The 

optimization considered the optimization parameters defined by Coro, as presented in 

Table 18.3. 

For this stage of analysis a constant mining cost of US$1.20/t was applied to ore and 

waste. 

These parameters were applied per ore type as shown in the following table.

Threshold cut off grades of 0.3% CuT for oxides and 0.2% CuT for enriched ore were 

applied. The amount of enriched ore between 0.2% and 0.3% CuT was very small. 

18.4.1.3 MINERAL RESERVES ANALYSIS 

The analysis of the final pit limits was carried out with the above described resources 

block model and technical - economic parameters.  

This analysis includes the definition of the following main parameters: 

• Total in pit ore resources inventory; 

• Mine life (years) as a result of the inventory of in pit ore resources; 

• Volume of waste produced over the life of the mine; and 

• Land requirements for final pit and waste dumps. 

18.4.1.4 FINAL PIT SELECTION 

Using the pit optimization parameters summarized previously, a Whittle 4X run was 

carried out. This produced the series of pit envelopes summarized in Table 18.5.

The analysis of the Whittle series obtained showed little increase of the NPV for prices 

higher than US$1.11 /lb. At the same time the geometry of the series is such that the 

additional ore between the 1.11 and the 1.5 envelopes cannot be mined in a separate 

mine phase. This would bring this low grade ore to the initial years of the plan and 

reduce the NPV. For this reason, the US$1.11 /lb envelope (pit 9 of the series), was 

chosen as final pit. The ore left outside of the final pit is 13.96 Mt with an average 

grade of 0.34 % CuT and a stripping ratio of 0.94. 

Figure 18.5 shows the Whittle envelope selected as final pit. This pit was then 

designed with all the operational features, eliminating non-operational contours and 

adding the corresponding access ramps.

18.4.2 VALIDITY OF THE SELECTED FINAL PIT UNDER CURRENT PARAMETERS 

Since Ausenco's Study was published in May 2008, the economic parameters 

concerning operating costs and copper price have changed significantly. The 

operating costs have increased due to escalation of labor cost, diesel, power, 

consumables and materials, plus the additional transport cost resulting of the 

proposed location of the process plant 20 km away from the mine. At the same time, 

the copper prices have also increased significantly, compensating the upward trend of 

the operating cost. 

The technical parameters of the project remained unchanged compared to Ausenco's 

Study, except for the location of the Heap Leach operation which has been moved 

20km away from the mine, as mentioned above.

Due to the above changes on the economic parameters, NCL carried out an analysis 

of the validity of the proposed optimum open pit and mine plan reported in Ausenco's 

May 2008 Prefeasibility Study.  

The analysis carried out by NCL consisted of running a new open pit optimization 

exercise with the parameters defined for the current Technical Report, select an 

optimum open pit for these parameters, and compare it with the open pit selected in 

May 2008. 

The main parameters utilized in the Whittle optimization exercise are shown in table 

18.6.

Using the pit optimization parameters summarized previously, a Whittle 4X run was 

carried out. This produced the series of pit envelopes summarized in Table 18.5.

The analysis of the Whittle series obtained showed little increase of the NPV for prices 

higher than US$2.07 /lb. For this reason, the US$2.07 /lb envelope (pit 23 of the 

series), was chosen as final pit in this exercise. The ore left outside of the final pit is 

14.3 Mt with an average grade of 0.34 % CuT and a stripping ratio of 1.11, which is 

marginal in grade and has a relatively high stripping ratio, so it will not add value to 

the project. 

 

The optimum pit chosen in this exercise was compared with the optimum pit chosen in 

the May 2008 Ausenco Prefeasibility Study, and the conclusion is that both pits are 

virtually identical. The 2012 pit contains slightly more ore, and consequently has a 

slightly higher stripping ratio. The visual analysis of both pits show that the 2008 pit is 

contained in the 2012 pit. The following table shows a comparison of the selected 

optimum pits of the 2008 and 2012 exercises.

The above results suggest that the increases on the operating costs are offset by the 

increase on the copper price. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the pit chosen in 

2008 is valid as the optimum pit under the parameters of the current study.

18.4.3 OPERATIONAL PIT AND SEQUENCE 

Ramps were designed at 22 m width and 10% gradient this geometry is adequate for 

the use of trucks up to 120 tones. Its impact on the stripping ratio is not relevant given 

the shallowness of the pit and its elongated shape (the final pit is 1.2 km long and 440 

m wide). 

The design considers two pit exits according to the general layout of installations 

defined by Coro and included in Figure 18.6, one for the ore to the south of the pit, 

close to the position of the primary crusher and one exit to the north for the waste, that 

will go to the northeast dump (primary ore and gravels) and to the northwest dump 

(low grade oxide and enriched plus leached material). Enough capacity was defined in 

all the waste dumps to store all the waste material during the life of the mine. 

Two phases were designed, one for oxides and the second (to the final limit) for the 

enriched ore, with smoothed contours and with ramps incorporated to give access to 

the primary crusher and to the waste dumps, as shown in the following figures, 

according to the crusher location and mine infrastructure layout as shown in Figure 

18.9 and the corresponding waste dump design as shown in Figure 18.10.

The slope design of the final pit was evaluated by E – Mining Technology, specialist 

geotechnical consultants, which recommended a reduction in the angle of the pit to 

45º in gravels above the main access ramp, as shown in the Figure 18.8. The 

geotechnical analysis was based only on a preliminary assessment, and needs to be 

further studied in future stages of the project with more field data.

The tonnage – grade curves of the phases and final pit are shown in Table 18.9. This 

phase has a low proportion of enriched (5.2 Mt of enriched in a total of 25 Mt of ore) 

and a stripping ratio of 0.51 : 1. The separation of the two ore types is suitable for a 

schedule of oxides first followed by enriched in later years. 

Phase 2 (Enriched ore) tonnage grade curve is shown in Table 18.10. This phase has 

predominantly enriched ore and a stripping ratio of 0.82 : 1.

in May 2008, according to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, NCL was 

unable to quote mineral reserves for the Project due to the current legislation in the Province 

of Mendoza which prohibits the use of toxic substances (including sulfuric acid which is 

required in heap leaching of copper ore). 

In an effort to resolve the issue of the ban on use of sulfuric acid in Mendoza, this study 

report shows that a viable project can be achieved by constructing an SX/EW heap leach 

plant outside of the province of Mendoza at a distance of 20 km in the pro-mining province of 

San Juan. According to Coro´s legal opinion, there is no legal impediment to transport ore 

between the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan, or to implement a Heap leach, SX/EW 

process plant in the province of San Juan. Therefore, relying in Coro´s legal opinion, NCL is 

now able to report mineral reserves under CIM Standards on Mineral Reserves for San Jorge 

Leach Project.

Mineable reserves were determined based on the final pit described in the previous chapter, 

which were categorized according to the CIM Standards on Mineral Reserves 

A marginal cut off grade of 0.15% CuT was calculated for oxides and 0.18% CuT for 

enriched. 

The mine plan was developed using the threshold values defined for the optimization runs 

(0.3% for the oxides and 0.2% CuT for enriched), aiming for a better use of the SX/EW 

capacity and improving the cash flow in the initial years. 

The Overall mineral reserves contained in the mine plan developed by NCL are 48.4 million 

tonnes, with an average grade of 0.61% CuT. The Mineral Reserves are categorized as 83% 

Proven and 17% Probable of which 55% is oxide and 45% is enriched as is set out in the 

following. The Inferred resources are currently considered as waste.  

The following table shows the mineral reserves by category and ore type:

18.5 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

18.5.1 SCHEDULING CRITERIA 

The basic criteria used for the development of the mine production schedule are: 

• A nominal plant capacity of 25,000 tpa of cathodes; 

• A crusher capacity for a range up to 6.3 Mt per year;

• Stockpile of the enriched ore produced in the initial years when the production 

comes mainly from oxide ore  (once enough enriched is produced (year 4), 

separate pads will be prepared for this material), and 

• The plan was developed at the level of bench per phase.  

The size of the phases is big in terms of area, so the plan has a very low vertical 

advance rate. The size of the phases allow for the opening of different working areas 

in the same bench if required for blending or to obtain early waste materials for roads 

and platforms. 

18.5.2 CUT OFF GRADE 

A marginal cut off grade of 0.15% CuT was calculated for oxides and 0.18% CuT for 

enriched. 

The mine plan was developed using the threshold values defined for the optimization 

runs (0.3% for the oxides and 0.2% CuT for enriched), aiming for a better use of the 

EW capacity and improving the cash flow in the initial years. 

18.5.3 MINE EXTRACTION SCHEDULE 

The mine production schedule was developed using a NCL program structured to 

control the scheduling constraints and reporting of the main results. 

The input for the scheduling program consists of the tonnage grade curve of each 

bench in the two mining phases. 

The schedule was developed for each year. A summary of the mine extraction 

schedule is shown in Table 18.13.

Pre-stripping is required to obtain waste material for construction of roads and 

platforms. Enough waste can be produced in the initial months to comply with this 

requirement. A more detailed scheduling exercise (by mining polygons) may be used 

to define that material, leaving most of the ore as "insitu" stockpile to be used once the 

plant is ready to start. 

The detailed plan per phase and bench is not included in this report. End-of-year 

photos showing the progress of the pit and the waste dump are shown in Figure 18.11

18.6 MINING OPERATION AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS 

The type and quantity of mining equipment to satisfy the mine production schedule 

requirements are presented in this section. 

18.6.1 EQUIPMENT SELECTION CRITERIA 

The following criteria were adopted for mine equipment selection: 

• Medium capacity units, consistent with the size of the operation; 

• Proven technology, similar to many other operations of similar type; 

• Flexibility in operations, where required, and 

• High productivity in waste removal as well as high selectivity for ore extraction. 

The equipment was selected for a standard mining operation with conventional drill, 

blast, load and haul, plus all the regular services of face and roads maintenance. 

The equipment selection includes diesel drills of 191 mm diameter for waste and ore, 

11.5 m3 front end loaders for waste and ore, and 50 t capacity trucks.

Auxiliary equipment includes 335 kW trackdozer, 335 kW wheeldozer, 205 kW 

motorgrader and 30 m3 water truck.   

 

Operating Time Definition 

The following parameters were adopted for equipment fleet calculation: 

• 365 days of operation per year; 

• Two 12 hour shifts per day, and 

• Two meal breaks per shift (one of 40 minute and the other of 20 minute). 

Figure 18.19 shows the definitions used for equipment time allocation and calculation 

of the main operational indices:

1. Maintenance time:  

Applies when the equipment is :  

- In maintenance. 

- Waiting for maintenance personnel. 

- Waiting for maintenance equipment or spare parts. 

- Travel time to workshops. 

- Waiting time within the workshops. 

2. Scheduled losses: Time allocated for: 

- Meal breaks. 

- Shift change. 

- Blasting. 

- Refueling. 

- Meetings, etc. 

3. Reserve : The equipment is available but has not been allocated to a 

face 

4. Operational losses: Time allocated for: 

- Working face preparation. 

- Training. 

- Accidents/incidents. 

- Equipment movement. 

- Equipment inspection, etc. 

The general concept is that operational hours correspond to all the time when the 

odometer is working. It is a management issue to avoid any scheduled loss or reserve 

to operational losses.

The maintenance concept is to use a MARC contract (Maintenance and Repair 

Contracts) with a specialized contractor (supplier of equipment or similar), as a base 

case. In this concept the availability will correspond to the MARC availability (the 

value that is guaranteed by the contractor) less the time used for other maintenance 

activities not included in the MARC (like change of tires, etc.). A comparison with 

owner's maintenance costs is included in the operating costs chapter. 

The above mentioned operational indices have been estimated for all major units of 

equipment according to the experience of similar operations. 

18.6.2 DRILLING PERFORMANCE 

A general design of the drilling and blasting patterns has been carried out.  

Penetration rate was estimated at 40 m/h for both waste and ore. 

A drilling pattern of 6.0 x 6.0 m was adopted as shown in the following table. 

Additional drilling of 10% was allowed for buffer lines in smooth blasting for final 

contour of phases.

18.6.3 BLASTING DESIGN PARAMETERS 

The main assumptions for blasting design were: 

• Use of ANFO as primary blasting agent, and 

• Presence of water in 30% of drillholes that will require the use of emulsions. 

The explosives requirements were calculated according to the blasting design showed 

in Table 18.16.

18.6.6 TRUCK SPEEDS 

Truck speeds were determined based on typical values obtained from suppliers' 

information and similar operations. The basic information used is shown in Table 

18.19.

18.6.7 FIXED TIMES IN TRUCK CYCLE 

The truck cycles include other fixed times for loading, tipping, queuing, etc, estimated 

at 3.75 minutes per cycle 

18.6.8 MAIN EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT 

The number of units required was obtained by dividing the annual capacity of every 

piece of equipment, by the corresponding tonnage. 

A summary of the number of units of main equipment required is presented in Table 

18.20. 

Table 18.20: Main Equipment Required 

 

One drill rig is required, however two units were included in the capital estimate to 

have adequate contingency. Two front end loaders were sufficient for the 

requirements of the mine. 

The maximum nominal truck fleet was estimated at 8 trucks.

18.6.9 AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT 

The auxiliary equipment selection was made by taking into account the size and type 

of the main fleet for loading and hauling, the geometry and size of the pits and the 

amount of roads and waste dumps that will operate at the same time. 

This fleet is composed of track dozers (335 kW), wheeldozer (335 kW), motorgrader 

(205 kW) and water trucks (30 m3). 

The number of units in this case was determined as a function of the number of units 

in the main loading and hauling fleet and the total rock movement in the pit. The units 

required are the following: 

• 2 Bulldozers; 

• 1 Wheeldozer; 

• 1 Grader; and 

• 1 Water Truck. 

The following items were included in the list of support equipment for maintenance 

(will be operated by the maintenance contractor): 

• 1 Fuel truck; 

• 1 Lube truck; 

• 1 Tire handler; and 

• 3 Light Units. 

It was assumed that other service elements like cranes, etc, will be provided by the 

maintenance contractor. The MARC contract was assumed to include components 

and spare parts for major and minor repairs, oil and grease for lubrication. It does not 

include tires repair, wearing elements and fuel.

18.6.10 EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION PROGRAM 

Table 18.21 summarizes the schedule of acquisitions that was adopted, considering 

new equipment to absorb increases in production. Given the short life of the project, 

there was no allowance for replacement of units during the life of the mine.

18.7 MAINTENANCE SHOP AND OTHER PIT INFRASTRUCTURE 

There were many alternatives to maintain a mine equipment fleet like the one 

estimated for San Jorge, all of them with similar tasks but with different concepts of 

services. 

Maintenance tasks, as conceived in this case, include total field maintenance (i.e. 

scheduled and predictive maintenance, fuelling, diagnosis and solution of failures, 

change of components, etc.) for low mobility units (drilling rigs, bulldozers) and total 

service at workshop for high mobility units (trucks, front end loaders, wheeldozers, 

graders, etc.), considering that other situations can occur when the services will be 

provided in a different way depending on the urgency and resources available. 

To carry out these tasks, adequate infrastructure is required with permanent 

installations (service bays, welding shop, electric shop, warehouse, washing area, 

etc) and mobile service equipment (service truck, fuel and lubrication truck, crane, 

etc.), plus the set of tools and equipment required. 

Further to the physical infrastructure an organizational structure is required, that 

can be defined in many different ways (own services, partial or total external 

services from specialized contractors) 

18.7.1 MAINTENANCE TASKS 

Maintenance tasks include: 

• Operational control of the equipment; 

• Maintenance management; 

• Management of guarantees;  

• Continuous evaluation of the state of use of the equipment and its 

components (analysis of lubricants, measurement of thickness and depths, 

analysis of vibrations, thermography, control of equipment alarms, etc); 

• Planning and scheduling of maintenance activities;

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 271 OF 461 

 

• Execution of scheduled activities (daily inspections and services, preventive 

maintenance, scheduled change of components, etc); 

• Execution of non-scheduled activities (diagnosis and evaluation of 

problems, change or repair of damaged components); 

• Evaluation and implementation of new practices and/or technological 

improvements, and 

• Administration of consumables and spare parts. 

The execution of scheduled activities should be the main maintenance task. Non-

scheduled activities result in unexpected detention of the equipment, directly 

affecting the operation. Sufficient resources have to be provided for the effective 

performance of these tasks. 

18.7.2 PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 

The main installations for maintenance will be composed of a maintenance shop 

dimensioned for a fleet of 8 trucks, 2 front end loaders, 2 bulldozers, 1 grader, 1 

wheeldozer, 1 water truck and 1 drill rig. 

Two maintenance bays will be sufficient for this fleet (1 for trucks and the other for 

auxiliary equipment). The truck shop needs to be equipped with compressed air 

system, lubrication system, bridge crane of 25 t of capacity, water supply and 

sewage, system to treat effluents and solid residues, storage of lubricants, storage 

of tires, warehouse for spare parts and components storage, etc. 

A general layout of the proposed maintenance shop is shown in Figure 18.20.

A fuel station is also required. This is assumed to be provided by the fuel supplier 

and was not included in the capital cost estimate. 

Fuel consumption was estimated at a maximum of 17,600 L/day, mainly in trucks 

and front end loaders, which will attend to the fuel station for supply. Equipment 

with less mobility (drills and bulldozers), will be re-fueled with a service truck. A fuel 

tank for 15 days of operation (250 m3) is proposed

19.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

19.1 PROCESS DESIGN 

19.1.1 CRUSHING, AGGLOMERATION AND STACKING 

A. CRUSHING 

Crushing circuit design is dictated by the target product size set at p80 13 mm 

based on the leach recovery achieved at various crush sizes in the initial column 

leach testwork and the Run of Mine (ROM) ore top size (1000 mm) delivered to the 

crushing circuit. 

A three stage open circuit crushing plant is required to handle the crushing duty. 

The crushing plant will be directly fed by 50 t mine trucks and also by Front End 

Loader (FEL) from a small ROM stockpile. 

The primary jaw crusher will be fed by a vibrating grizzly feeder from the ROM 

dump bin and be serviced by a rock-breaker and an air-conditioned control cabin. 

Primary crushed ore will be fed to a single deck secondary scalping screen with 

oversize reporting to the secondary cone crusher. Screen undersize will be 

recombined with secondary crusher product and conveyed to a surge bin feeding a 

double deck tertiary scalping screens. 

Screen oversize is fed to the tertiary cone crusher and screen undersize 

recombined with tertiary crusher product to a product stockpile that will fed 14 

railway carriage of 56t capacity to be transported to the process plant stockpile in 

San Juan province, where it will be fed to the agglomerator.

B. AGGLOMERATION 

The agglomerator will be an inclined mild steel rubber-lined drum with an L:D ratio 

of approximately 3:1 driven at a variable speed of up to 15 rpm.  

Concentrated sulfuric acid will be transferred into the process acid tanks.   

The sulfuric acid will be added to the crushed ore in the drum via a spray manifold 

over the first third of the drum length.  Raffinate will also be added to the ore to 

provide additional moisture. 

The agglomerator is an inclined rotating drum with a tumbling action, causing fine 

particles to bind to each other and to larger particles and to intimately mix with acid 

and raffinate.   

C. STACKING 

Agglomerated ore will be discharged from the agglomerator to a conveyor that will 

load 20 t trucks that will deliver ore to the leach pad radial stacker 

The radial stacker includes a 6 m retractable extension (stinger) and is designed to 

stack ore in cells 82 m wide and 6 m high. Once the radial stacker has deposited 

one pass of ore on the heap it will be relocated. 

The retreat stacking system proposed for the San Jorge Project allows freshly 

stacked ore to be placed under irrigation as soon as sufficient area is available.

19.1.2 HEAP LEACHING 

A. PRE-PRODUCTION ORE PLACEMENT 

The placement of a significant tonnage of ore will be required in order to achieve 

design copper cathode production rates from start-up.  

The PLS grade and the ability to meet the production target in the early months of 

operation are sensitive to the pre-production tons and grade and the field leach 

kinetics projection applied to the ore placed. 

Pre-production mining was not considered as part of the pre-feasibility study. It is 

recommended that this be given consideration during the next phase of work when 

the field leach kinetics projection based on full size columns is available.  

B. HEAP LIFT DEVELOPMENT 

Ten 6 m lifts are required to place this quantity of ore on a leach pad with a nominal 

990 m long by 630 m wide footprint. 

Heap stacking will commence at the northern end of the leach pad.  On completion 

of this first panel the stacking equipment will be located 82 m to the south and this 

sequence repeated. 

As the heap height increases lift by lift ramps will be developed to provide access 

for trucks that will transport ore to the top of the heap to the radial stacker. 

C. LEACH PAD PREPARATION 

The study has looked at the earthworks required to accommodate a heap leach 

pad with base dimensions of 990 m x 630 m located across an alluvial plain on the 

north side of the ore body. The alluvial plain slopes toward the northeast. The 

surface of the plain is undulating with erosion features and is covered in sparse, 

low, scrub vegetation.  

The heap leach pad has been located with the long pad dimension aligned north-

south, at a slight skew across the alluvial plain, so that the surface will drain 

diagonally from the higher north-western corner to the lower south-eastern corner,

where the process ponds and plant are proposed to be located. The pad is 

proposed to be divided into 12 panels each of 82.5 m width. To minimize 

earthworks, each panel is separated from the next by an average 2.5m height 

batter slope. Along the top of each batter slope a 1m high bund will provide 

containment for the leachate solution to be collected off each panel. A 1m high 

bund will also be provided around the north, east and west perimeter of the pad to 

provide containment for the heap. The exposed surfaces of all leach pad panels, 

separating batter slopes and containment bunds will be lined with 1.5 mm thickness 

HDPE sheet.  

Each leach panel surface will be graded evenly at an average 2%, both across 

panel and down panel.  

Each leach panel surface will be graded evenly at an average 2%, both across 

panel and down panel.  

The lower corner of each leach pad panel will be connected by pairs of HDPE 

pipes to trapezoidal, HDPE lined, PLS and ILS solution drains (or W drains). The 

pipes will be provided with valves to control whether PLS or ILS leachate solution is 

discharged from each panel to the drains. The W drains grade at approximately 4% 

from west to east, parallel with the long dimension front edge of the pad. At the 

lower south-east corner of the pad the W drains will turn to flow between the PLS 

and ILS ponds. 

Between the front edge of the heap and the W solution drains, a service access 

track will run the length of the pad, parallel with and separating the pad from the W 

drains. The service track will continue completely round the perimeter of the leach 

pad. 

A system of leak detection drains is proposed to be provided under the pad liner. A 

filter wrapped proprietary mole drain is proposed to be laid in the pad subgrade, 

down the length of the each panel, on the down slope side, crossing under the 

service access track and the W drains and connecting to a leak monitoring pit 

located on the outer edge of the pad fill embankment.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 281 OF 461 

 

The leach pad has been sized to contain a total 43.96M tons of ore. Based on 

preliminary ore data it is proposed to build the heap in ten layers, each 6 m in 

depth, resulting in an ultimate heap height of 60 m. The leachate solution from the 

heap on each panel will be collected from under each 6m layer of ore by a system 

of HDPE collection pipes. The collectors are proposed to be DN100 perforated 

HDPE pipe laid at 3 m centers at a slight angle across the width of each panel. The 

collectors will connect to three DN250 HDPE pipes laid down the length of each 

panel, on the down slope side, each DN250 pipe catering for collection from one 

third of the length of the heap on each panel. 

To protect the HDPE liner over the pad surface from damage during delivery and 

stacking of the ore, a 0.5 m thick cushion layer of crushed rock is proposed to be 

placed over the pad liner. The cushion material will also assist in holding the liner in 

place on panels where ore has not yet been placed. The natural gravel or crushed 

rock cushion material will need to be acid resistant and durable. Depending on its 

permeability the collection piping may be laid either under or on top of the cushion 

material. A source of this material has not been identified yet. 

19.1.3 PROCESS PONDS 

The W solution drains are proposed to deliver the PLS and ILS solutions to a 

concrete distribution structure located between the ILS pond and PLS pond 1. 

Normally, collected solution flows are piped from this distribution structure into the 

PLS and ILS ponds. In the event of a large rainfall event the storm water runoff 

delivered from the heap leach pad via the W drains is proposed to bypass entry to 

the ponds by means of an overflow weir in the distribution structure and then via an 

HDPE lined channel directly to the environmental storm water pond. Overflows 

from the PLS and ILS ponds will be piped back to the overflow drain. The intention 

of the proposed system is to avoid sequential flow of all storm water runoff from the 

leach pad through the ponds and the consequent need for large lined connection 

channels between each pond.

The PLS, ILS and raffinate process ponds are sized to provide a live storage 

capacity equal to 12 hours storage, 8 hours storage and 10 hours storage 

respectively, at a solution cycling rate of 883 m3/hour. 

The resultant minimum live storage capacity required for each solution is 10,600 

m3 for PLS, 7,070 m3 for ILS and 8,850 m3 for raffinate. 

The PLS ponds are split 1/3 and 2/3 to provide two ponds - one of 3,550 m3 live 

storage and the other 7,070 m3 live storage. 

The ILS pond is a single pond providing 7,070 m3 live storage. 

The raffinate ponds are split 1/2 and 1/2 to provide two ponds of 4,425 m3 live 

storage capacity. 

The pond earthworks have been optimized in conjunction with the leach pad and 

the requirement for gravity flow from the W solution drains, to and through each 

pond, to give a near balance between cut and fill, with a surplus favoring cut. The 

pond depths have been limited to 4 m below crest level, allowing 1 m freeboard 

and 1 m for dead storage, providing 2 m net live storage depth. 

To facilitate installation of the necessary HDPE pond liner, pond side slopes are 

proposed to be 1 V to 2.5 H. The pond perimeter bund crest widths are nominally 5 

m. The ponds are designed to overflow from one to another commencing with 

rainfall runoff inflow from the leach pad to the first PLS pond, followed by sequential 

overflow into the second PLS pond, the ILS pond and then via an HDPE lined 

overflow channel to the site storm water pond. 

Pond liners are proposed to be two layers of 1.5 mm thick plain HDPE with an 

HDPE biaxial mesh geocomposite laid between the plain liner sheets as a primary 

means of leak detection and containment. The composite lining will be laid on the 

trimmed and compacted surfaces of the pond floors and walls, prepared to provide 

a smooth, sharp object free graded surface on which to lay the liner. It may be 

necessary to import and place a layer of suitable clay material to achieve an 

acceptable surface on which to place the pond liner. A source of such material has 

not been identified yet.

Secondary pond liner leak detection is proposed to be provided by means of a 

regular pattern of under liner mole drains, installed on and around the floor of each 

pond, the drains connecting through HDPE pipe to down-batter leak monitoring 

wells.

19.1.4 LEACH PAD IRRIGATION SYSTEM 

The leaching strategy adopted for the San Jorge Project is a two stage leach to 

maximize the copper tenor of PLS delivered to the SX Plant.  

Agglomerated ore placed on the leach pads will be irrigated first with Intermediate 

Leach Solution (ILS) and then with raffinate from the SX Plant. The heap run-off will 

be directed either into the PLS pond or the ILS pond depending on copper 

concentration in the leachate. 

All irrigation piping has been located along the eastern edge of the leach pad so 

that rising mains do not interfere with stacking system access ramps. HDPE pipe 

will be used for the raffinate and ILS manifolds and sub-headers.  

Each 82 m wide "panel" of the leach pad is divided into six "cells" 82 m wide by 100 

m long serviced by a single 300 mm header.  Each of these cells will be irrigated by 

two 82 m by 100 m ring mains formed in 110 mm HDPE piping feeding a 13 mm 

dripper tube network. 

Solution percolating through the ore will be collected by perforated plastic pipes 

which overlie the liner protection layer. These drainage pipes are arranged to assist 

the flow of leach solutions towards six 250 mm HDPE collection pipes running 

along the edge of the panel. These six pipes collect leach solution from the six 

"cells" that make up a panel. 

The leach solution is then directed into one side of the W drain or the other 

depending on copper tenor. The "W" drain delivers the leach solution into either the 

ILS Pond or the PLS Pond.

19.1.5 SOLVENT EXTRACTION 

The SX Plant will be configured initially as a 2E x 1S series circuit. Provision has 

been made to add an additional mixer settler and reconfigure the circuit to a series-

parallel (2E x 1EP x 1S) arrangement if the design PLS grade cannot be 

maintained. 

The leaching mass balance suggests that a PLS grade of approximately 4 g/L is 

achievable based on 85% total copper recovery from a two stage leach of 0.57% 

CuT oxide ore and 66% total copper recovery from a two stage leach of 0.61% CuT 

enriched ore. 

Based on the PLS grade of 4 g/L predicted by the leaching mass balance, a total 

PLS flow rate of 880 m3/h fed to a 2E x 1S SX plant configuration is required to 

produce 25,000 t/y of cathode copper.

A. ORGANIC RECOVERY SYSTEMS 

Extractant consumption in the SX Plant contributes significantly to operating costs 

and a pre-settler pond and "rope mop" organic recovery system will be installed to 

ensure maximum recovery of organic entrained in raffinate. 

B. CRUD HANDLING AND CLAY TREATMENT 

Formation of crud in the SX plant is typically caused by the presence of suspended 

solids in the PLS.  Although predicting the quantities of crud likely to be generated 

in a new circuit is difficult, several measures have been put in place to handle crud: 

• Use of a simple crud removal system; 

• Safe access to settlers to facilitate crud removal; and 

• Removal of final crud using a centrifuge. 

Regular clay treatment of the organic will be required to maintain the performance 

of the extractant. The crud tank and crud centrifuge will be used for this purpose.

19.1.6 ELECTROWINNING 

The Electrowinning Plant will be an ISA Process tankhouse or equivalent and has 

been designed to be able to produce some 25,000 t/y of cathode copper that 

conforms to LME Grade A specifications. Its design is based on a current efficiency 

of 92%, an operational utilization of 98% and a current density of 310 A/m2. 

The tankhouse will contain 90 cells – 18 scavenger and 72 commercial - each 

containing 46 anodes and 45 cathode mother plates.  

The electrowinning cells are designed with an electrode spacing of 104 mm, a 

nominal current density of 310 A/m2 and a maximum current density of 340 A/m2. 

This feature provides a turn-up of some 10%. 

Electrowon copper will be harvested on a seven day cycle from the electrowinning 

cells by an overhead crane that transports the cathode mother plates to the 

cathode stripping machine. A  cell live lift technique will be used, in which every 

third cathode is removed from the cells with the other  remaining live and carrying 

an additional 33% current until the freshly stripped mother plates are returned to 

the cells.  

The cathode stripping machine will be semi-automatic and contain a flexing 

stripping station. Cathode mother plates will be delivered to the feed-in conveyor of 

the machine and index automatically through the wash station where adherent 

copper sulfate crystals will be washed off. 

The stripping machine operator will pick up a single electrode from the wash station 

using the stripping machine hoist and deliver it to the flexing/stripping station. The 

flexing stripping station operation will be initiated by the operator and the cathode 

deposit will be automatically removed from the mother plate and delivered to the 

bundling station for manual strapping. The freshly stripped mother plate will be 

delivered to the feed-out conveyor and the mother plate will be automatically 

spaced for return to the cells.

Cobalt sulfate, which helps to prevent lead oxide spalling from the anodes, will be 

added to the electrolyte in the electrolyte circulation tank in order to maintain a 

cobalt concentration in electrolyte above 150 ppm. 

Guar is another reagent that will be added to the electrolyte. It is regarded as a 

cathode deposit grain refiner and acts to improve the density and hence the purity 

of the cathode deposit.

19.1.7 REAGENTS 

The main reagents that will be used in the Process Plant at San Jorge are: 

• Extractant; 

• Diluent; 

• Sulfuric acid; 

• Cobalt sulfate; 

• Guar; and 

• Clay. 

Extractant will be delivered to site and stored on site in 1 m3 Intermediate Bulk 

Containers (IBC). It will be pumped directly into extraction stage E2. 

Diluent will be delivered to site in road tankers and discharged directly into the 

Diluent Storage Tank located north of the SX Plant. The Diluent Pump will transfer 

diluent into the Crud Tank in the tank farm and into Strip Stage 1 in the SX Plant.  

Dry reagents such as salt, clay, diatomaceous earth, guar and cobalt sulfate will be 

delivered to site on pallets and stored in the reagent store within the warehouse. 

Guar and cobalt sulfate will be dissolved in potable water in agitated reagent tanks 

and dosed into the electrolyte overflowing out of cell 1 in the EW Plant.  

Salt will be added manually to the electrolyte circuit as required. 

Clay will be added manually to the Centrifuge Feed Tank for clay treatment of 

organic, discharged from the Crud Centrifuge and disposed of in the heap. 

At least two weeks supply of all reagents will be maintained on site so that the 

operation is not impacted by transport delays due to road closure caused by snow.

19.1.8 STORM WATER POND 

The stormwater pond has been sized to provide containment of runoff from the 

approximately 68 ha of the heap leach pad and the process ponds. The design 

rainfall to be contained has been taken to be the 25 year return period maximum 

daily runoff value of 58 mm. No allowance has been for drain down of the 

estimated 3% differential between the operating and drain-down moisture contents 

of the volume of the ore under leach, in the event of a power failure coincident with 

the storm event. 

The catchment area contributing runoff required to be captured is assumed to 

include the leach pad, the solution drains, the process ponds, dirty areas of the 

plant site, any connecting areas unable to be excluded by means of diversion 

drains or bunding and the storm water pond itself.  

The environmental storm water pond is proposed to be 6 m deep and lined with a 

single layer of 1.5 mm thickness HDPE. Otherwise, the storm water pond wall 

slopes, crest width and leak detection system is proposed to be the same as 

described for the process ponds. 

 A trapezoidal shaped overflow spillway will be constructed on the southern end of 

the storm water pond. The 1 m depth spillway will be HDPE lined over the width of 

the crest beyond which it will become an unlined trapezoidal channel graded to 

discharge to the natural drainage system draining to the southeast. 

19.1.9 SITE EARTHWORKS 

Minimalist earthworks cut to fill platforms have been allowed for the following site 

facilities: 

• The SX / EW process plant platforms; 

• Construction laydown platforms; 

• A combined platform area for the mine administration offices, the kitchen / 

dining facility and the camp accommodation;

• The ROM pad incorporating a steel faced reinforced earth ROM wall 

providing 17 m height difference between ROM pad and the primary 

crusher pad; 

• Platforms for the primary, secondary and tertiary crushing plant, 

agglomerator plant, truck load-out facility and connecting conveyors; 

• An acid manufacturing plant platform; 

• A sewerage treatment plant platform; 

• A mine workshop platform; 

• A warehouse platform; and 

• A fuel storage and distribution area. 

 

19.2 PLANT DESIGN 

19.2.1 DESIGN BASIS 

Materials of construction selected are compatible with the process solutions that 

will be handled and recognize specific issues such as control of static electricity in 

the SX Plant and the relatively high copper and sulfuric acid concentrations in 

electrolyte and leach solutions. 

19.2.2 CONTROL SYSTEM 

A control room located at the primary crusher will be used to control the crushing 

plant, agglomeration and the stacking system. A control room will also be provided 

adjacent to the cathode stripping machine in the EW Plant. This control room will 

be the base for the SX-EW Plant shift operator who will also be responsible for 

taking control samples as required.  The control room will be air-conditioned and 

pressurized with twin "airlock" doors to minimize dust contamination. 

The control room operators will be in contact with operators in the field via hand 

held radios.

PC–based operator interface stations will be provided in the control room running 

proprietary plant control software such as Citect. These will interface with 

programmable logic controllers (PLC) including those in vendor packages that will 

be installed in various locations around the plant site. 

Uninterruptible power supplies will be provided for the operator interface stations, 

printers and the radio base stations. 

19.2.3 SURFACE PROTECTION 

The leach and electrolyte solutions in the SX-EW Plant contain copper and sulfuric 

acid and if they come in contact with unprotected steel or concrete severe 

corrosion can occur. 

All steelwork will be protected by suitable high build epoxy paint systems. 

All concrete in the SX-EW Plant will be subject to splashing by low pH solutions. 

Some protective coating over the concrete has been allowed for in these areas. 

19.2.4 FIRE PROTECTION 

A. GENERAL 

The process plant and accommodation camp will be protected by a set of fire 

pumps operating on a reserve within the fire water and raw water ponds 

respectively. 

The fire water pump sets consist of an electric pump, diesel pump and jockey pump 

delivering fire water to up to four hydrants. 

B. SX FIRE PROTECTION 

Given the recent spate of fires in Solvent Extraction Plants, a number of safeguards 

have been put in place to address this issue: 

• A nominal separation distance of 50 m has been applied between Solvent 

Extraction and Electrowinning;

• All tankage and pipework within the SX plant that contains organic will be 

grounded to eliminate the risk associated with the build-up of static 

electricity charges; 

• The loaded organic pump will be driven through a variable speed drive; 

• All pumps in the SX Plant will be specified with direct drives; 

• Peristaltic pumps will be used as sump pumps; and 

• Organic weirs in the mixer-settlers will be operated at high levels to 

minimize free fall of organic and the potential for static electricity generation.

20.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

20.1 RAW WATER SUPPLY 

San Juan plant will be supplied with raw water by a pipeline from El Tigre stream. 

Pipeline system has been designed to provide a nominal continuous flow rate of 

216 m3/h. 

The raw water intake has been designed as a small earth dam on the El Tigre 

stream, about 7 km to the north of the San Jorge pit. In the absence of knowledge 

of available dam construction material properties and in recognition of the high 

seismicity of the Mendoza Province, the batter slopes for the earth dam have been 

taken to be 1 V to 3 H. With a maximum dam wall height of 6 m, the dam provides 

13,700 m3 storage, with 0.5 m freeboard. The storage is primarily to allow for 

sedimentation which, depending on stream bed load characteristics, will require 

periodic removal. 

The upstream face of the dam has been allowed to be waterproofed by means of a 

1.5 mm HDPE lining protected by felt geotextile with a facing of rock riprap  

A simple decant pipe intake will serve as the raw water intake. With the top of the 

dam wall at RL 2,700 m and the water treatment plant roughly 5 km downstream at 

RL 2,600 m, the plant site water supply system will be primarily gravity fed and then 

pumped by a 21 km of 315 mm HDPE pipeline. 

Raw water transportation system will have one single pump station with two 110 

kW centrifugal pumps (one operating and stand by) to provide pressure required to 

reach a maximum flow rate of 260 m3/h. Pipeline will run parallel to the railway 

track until reaching the distribution raw water tank and buried pipe will be installed 

a long of 100% of pipeline route to avoid external damage to pipeline facilities and 

have no impact in the wild life of the area. 

A 9 m width service corridor has been allowed to access the dam site. The corridor 

will accommodate a 3 m width track with pipeline bench and drainage either side. 

Earthworks are minimalist cut to fill with maximum grades of 20%, but only for short 

distances.

20.2 WATER TREATMENT AND DISTRIBUTION 

The water treatment plant will be a containerized system designed to treat 75 kL/d 

of raw water, fed from the Aº El Tigre de Yalguaraz intake, to meet internationally 

recognised drinking water standards. 

The proposed system will include a multimedia filter, a triple carbon filter system 

and a water softener. 

Disinfection of the potable water will be a continuous process, using a recirculation 

pumping system from the potable water tank, connected to a pH and residual 

chlorine analyser. This will monitor and continually maintain a set point pH of 7.2 

and a residual chlorine level of 2 ppm in the potable water storage tank at all times. 

Potable water will be reticulated around the site to the crushing plant, process 

plant, administration offices, canteen, accommodation camp, mine workshop and 

warehouse from a potable water tank located adjacent to the water treatment plant.

20.3 SULFURIC ACID PLANT 

At the end of the last century, acid from copper smelters was the predominant 

source of sulfuric acid supply to copper leaching operations. In the 2000's, the 

supply of smelter-produced acid has decreased due to smelter shutdowns and 

copper leaching acid demand has increased due to new copper leaching mine 

developments and higher acid consuming ores. This has led to the integration of 

sulfur-burning acid plant technology into copper leaching mine developments.  

San Jorge copper production process will require 300 to 410 metric tons per day of 

sulfuric acid to support the leaching of copper from the ore. In order to provide 

these acid requirements at the lowest cost possible, the project includes a sulfur-

burning acid plant to provide both acid and power. 

20.3.1 ACID PLANT – DESIGN AND LAYOUT 

Sulfur burning acid plant technology is a proven technology and every component 

within the San Jorge acid plant will be selected based on proven designs. The 

design is based on WSA technology from the Danish Haldor Topsoe for production 

of sulfuric acid of commercial grade through combustion of elemental sulfur WSA 

technology resulted in the most cost efficient and environmental friendly way for the 

following reasons: 

• Apart from cleaned gas, the only product is 98% weight concentrated 

sulfuric acid of commercial grade. 

• No waste product is produced. 

• The process uses no process water and produces no wastewater. 

• The process uses no fuel during normal operation. 

• Cooling water consumption is low. 

• High production of steam for export to power plant. 

• Heat from the process can be used for heating of process solutions. 

• The process is simple and flexible with a large turndown ratio.

• The process has a wide range of applications and more than 60 plants are 

in operation or under construction worldwide. 

WSA Technology is characterized by the fact that acid is condensed from a wet 

process gas, contrary to conventional acid technology where SO3 contained in a 

dry gas is absorbed in sulfuric acid. Therefore, it is not necessary to dry the gas, 

which naturally reduces the number of pieces of equipment and therefore also the 

initial capital expenditure. 

The main process steps in the WSA plant is presented in Figure 20.3 and 

explained as follows: 

• Combustion of sulfur to S02 gas: This is done by a sulfur burner using 
hot cooling air as combustion air, followed by a waste heat boiler cooling 

the process gas and producing steam. Before the process gas is sent into 

the plant, it is mixed with steam to increase the H2O content in the gas. By 

using the hot cooling air as burner air, the energy economy of the system 

will be improved and the steam export increased. 

• Oxidation of SO2 to SO3 in the SO2 converter with catalyst: The SO2 
gas is now sent into the SO2 reactor where it is oxidized to SO3. To 

increase the SO2 oxidation, the off-gas is cooled between the various 

catalyst beds by use of steam. 

• Cooling of the SO3 containing process gas to approximately 290ºC: 
After oxidation, a major part of the SO3 will hydrate to H2SO4 on gas 

format approximately 290ºC. Therefore, a substantial part of the heat of 

hydration is recovered through the steam-based heat recovery system. 

• Condensation of concentrated sulfuric acid in the WSA condenser: 
The WSA condenser is a heat exchanger with tubes in shock and acid 

resistant glass in which the process gas flows upwards. The cooling of the 

tubes takes place by means of atmospheric air on the shell side. When 

being cooled, the sulfuric acid condenses on the wall of the glass tubes,

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 305 OF 461 

 

and when flowing downwards and meeting the hot process gas, the acid 

concentrates to approximately 100ºC and proceeds to the stack. 

• Sulfuric acid cooling: The produced acid will leave the WSA condenser at 
a condensation temperature of approximately 245ºC. It is immediately 

cooled down by means of recirculation of cold acid, and final cooling to 

storage temperature is performed in a water-cooled plate heat exchanger 

with plates in Hastelloy. In this cooling step it is possible to use mining 

process solutions instead of water. 

As explained, all of the heat of SO2 oxidation, and a part of the heat of the SO3 

hydratation and of acid condensation are recovered through the inter-bed 

coolers/steam systems and then used for steam export. The surplus of steam (up 

to 60 Barg) will be used to generate electricity. 

Since cooling water is used only for cooling the produced acid, its consumption is 

about 10-15% of the conventional acid plant based on absorption consumption.

20.3.2 ACID PLANT - POWER PLANT 

As discussed above, the acid plant will produce approximately 25,000 kg/hour of 

superheated steam, which will be directed to a turbine generator. Budgetary 

proposals from several established turbine generator manufacturers have 

confirmed that design power production of approximately 4.8 MW can be expected 

from this steam flow.  

The turbine exhaust will be directed to a steam condenser operating under 

vacuum. The condenser will be a shell and tube type heat exchanger. The vapor 

enters the shell side of the heat exchanger and reports as condensate to the 

condensate pumps for recycling through the water treatment system. The cooling 

for the steam condenser would be provided by strong electrolyte (SE) solution 

entering the tubes of the heat exchanger from the SX processing plant at a rate

approximately 250 m3/hour (900 gpm). The materials used for construction of the 

condenser will be selected to ensure compatibility with raffinate chemistry and 

temperature. 

The power plant will include a dump condenser that will condense steam, in the 

event steam flow is required to by-pass the turbine generator. The dump condenser 

cooling will also be provided by raffinate solution (the raffinate will flow in series, 

first through the turbine's condenser followed by the dump condenser). 

20.3.3 ACID PLANT - WATER TREATMENT PLANT 

San Jorge water quality is shown below in Table 20.2.

Sulfur Costs: Sulfur is an internationally traded commodity and its pricing is 
monitored and forecast by several industry-recognized firms. The origin of the 

sulfur will likely be from Vancouver or Mexican gulf where elemental sulfur is 

produced and staked as a by-product of oil refining. For evaluation purposes, the 

project has considered information from main Canadian marketers as PRIMS 

Sulfur Corporation and PETROSUL International. The sulfur would be shipped in a 

20,000 ton Bessel capacity in a quarterly basis to a San Antonio port in Chile where 

it will be handled and transferred to a 30-ton-truck for hauling about 340 kilometers 

to site over the Andes border with Argentina to the sulfur stockpile adjacent to the 

acid plant.  

Coro has considered Canadian Marketers sulfur CFR prices forecast as shown in 

Table 20.5. Additional $45/t has been set for ocean freight and $35/t for handling 

and transport to project site. Note that each ton of sulfur produces approximately 

three tons of acid. The average sulfur cost for the mine life is $126/ton. This result 

in an average LOM cost of $42 per ton of acid.

Table 20.5: LOM Economic Model Sulfur Pricing 

Power Costs and Credits - Power requirements of approximately 846 kW are 

expected to produce acid at the rate of 411 t/d. The major power draw is the acid 

plant's combustion air compressor at 500 kW. The balance of the remaining power 

required is for boiler feed water pumping, cooling water pumping, acid pumping, 

and miscellaneous power demands, such as the cooling tower fans, sulfur pumping 

and water treatment requirements. 

The turbine generator is projected to generate 5,700 kW. The net power credit from 

the acid plant installation is estimated at approximately 4,800 kW. 

Reagent Costs - Reagents are primarily required to treat water. The water 

treatment plant will require chemicals to soften the water and scale inhibitors to 

reduce fouling of the RO system. 

The cooling tower will require chemicals that include algaecides and dispersants. 

The boiler feed water system will require chemicals including oxygen scavengers.

Operating Cost Summary - The operating and maintenance costs discussed above 

are summarized below in Table 20.6. True variable operating costs are estimated 

at $2/ton acid ($822 per day). These include the cost items discussed above, as 

well as operating and maintenance labor. A $1,500 per day allowance is allocated 

for equipment repair parts and to accrue funds for maintenance repairs that will be 

required every 12 to 18 months. This accrual includes maintenance costs for the 

steam and power plant areas of the plant. Acid plant operating cost for varying 

sulfur price scenarios is shown on Table 20.6.

Two 1 MW gensets are provided to allow for start up of the sulfuric acid plant and for 

emergency power supply of the project. Harmonic filtering and power factor correction 

is allowed for. 

A number of 13.2 kV/380 V transformers on overhead lines will provide power to the 

administration office, canteen, warehouse and fuel storage depot, workshop and the 

security gate.  

Allowances have been made for a plant earth system to be established and to earth 

the MCCs and transformers. 

A simple lightning protection system has been included based on utilising the metallic 

structure of the plant and earthing the SX and EW structures at ground level. An 

additional six lightning rods have been allowed for in the SX Plant mounted on the top 

of light poles. 

The acid plant to produce 140,000 t/y, generates 4.8 MW of electrical energy, thus 

reducing the plant electrical energy cost. 

20.5 ORE RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION 

As part of the infrastructure of the facilities a railroad will be constructed from the mine 

to the process plant site as shown in Figure 20.6. The purpose of the railway is to 

provide safe, economic and efficient ore deliveries by rail. The rail will run the property 

from the loading station at crushing stockpile to unloading station by the 

agglomeration in the north side of the property, about 22 km distance. Rail facilities 

will allow for unloading and parking at least 42 railcars, with deliveries expected on an 

hourly basis.  

Trade off studies were also performed to determine the most cost efficient way of 

hauling  ore from the mine site to the leaching process plant in San Juan. Trucking, 

Conveyor and Rail were studied, with the lowest operational cost and optimal

The product from the crushing plant, stored in a stock pile (1 day capacity) located in 

Mendoza, will be loaded in a group of 14 wagons of 58 ton each (1); while this loading 

operation is taking place, the 3,000 HP locomotive hauls mineral from Mendoza to 

San Juan's plant, located 22 km away (2). When the locomotive arrives to San Juan, it 

locates the wagons over a chute for unloading (3) which will convey the material to a 

stock pile (4). Once the wagons are in position, the locomotive unhooks the loaded 

wagons and hooks a group of empty wagons, to conduce them back to Mendoza (5). 

When arriving to Mendoza, the locomotive will place and then unhook the 14 empty 

wagons (6) and then it will hook the loaded wagons to start a new cycle of load / 

unload. During the loading operation the 14 wagons will be moved by a series of

21.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

This analysis is based on a projected annual capacity of 25.000 metric tonnes per 

year of ASTM B115 Grade 1 quality cathode. There are no contracts in place or 

required for the sale of copper cathode for this project. 

 

21.1 RECOMMENDED MARKETING STRATEGY 

The projected production volume is too small to justify a direct marketing effort, and it 

is recommended that full production tendered to a selected group of major merchants. 

This strategy will ensure immediate market entry and expedited payment with little or 

no credit risk in an increasingly competitive regional market. 

Metal merchants have generally been eager to source new production from non-

integrated producers in order to displace higher cost imported cathode, and to provide 

more competitive prices. Consequently, new electrowon cathode producers had 

obtained reasonable terms under long-term off-take contracts from major Asian, US 

and/or Europe merchants, most for 100% of production. 

These contracts include provisions for very prompt payment facilities. With a suitable 

counterparty these contracts could also be tied to bridge loans, senior or subordinated 

project debt facilities and/or corporate or project equity purchase agreements. 

 

21.2 CATHODE SALES TERMS AND NET REALIZATIONS 

Based on current cathode premium levels, estimated average freight costs to major 

consuming points in the Asian, US and Europe, and long-term cathode off-take terms 

negotiated recently by new electrowon cathode producers, San Jorge can expect to 

realize terms similar to the following: 

Delivery: FCA Refinery. Buyer arranges and pays for cathode transportation. 

Price: LME or COMEX average price during the Quotation Period less a discount of 
3.0 cents /lb for rod mill quality ASTM Grade 1 quality material, with negotiated 

discounts for lesser quality material. This estimate is based on a rough weighted

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 324 OF 461 

average freight and marketing costs (including merchant profit margins) in serving to 

the most likely regional end-users for this quality of cathode, and factors in the more 

competitive nature of the market with the growth in new SX-EW capacity. 

Quotation Period: Month of shipment, or month following month of shipment 
declarable by Buyer once or twice per year, depending on market conditions. 

Payment: On date of shipment (equivalent). 

Merchants provide useful services to the market. In recent years consumers have 

shifted a larger share of their cathode requirements to them for three main reasons: 

1. There are still only a few consumers that are equipped and willing to 

buy imported cathode on a CIF Port basis because of insufficient or 

inadequately trained staff and/or a desire to avoid lengthy pipeline 

financing. Nor are they willing to take on the performance risk in 

dealing with relatively small independent cathode producers. 

2. Consumers use merchants as a way of managing inventory at relatively 

low cost – buying unanticipated requirements from them and selling 

them back excess stocks as required to minimize these costs. 

3. Some merchants are more flexible on payment terms than producers 

who now all sell on a net cash basis. 

The metal price drivers in the world economy are extremely complex and there is no 

assurance that expected results will be met. Forward sales metal prices in terms of 

potential contracts are based on experience from actual similar operations and 

general knowledge. 

No direct marketing has been done for the potential San Jorge cathodes and therefore 

no off-take agreements exist. Based on current industry demands it is envisioned that 

the copper cathodes would be best suited not only for smelters in Asia, namely, 

Japan, Korea, India or China but also in US and Europe. There is the potential for the 

sale of cathodes to Argentinean consumers, however, these options will be reviewed 

in detail when the project proceeds to the feasibility stage.

22.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 

This section of the pre-feasibility study report: 

• States Coro's environmental philosophy; 

• Summarizes the Argentinean legal requirements for environmental protection; 

• Outlines the baseline data collection results; and 

• Summarizes possible impacts to the environment and the mitigation plans for 

project development, operation and closure. 

 

22.1 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY 

22.1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY 

Coro's policy is to meet or exceed all environmental requirements established by 

Argentinean Law. In the same manner, Coro will require that all of its contractors and 

employees comply with Coro's policy on environmental regulations. The following 

environmental policy will be adopted for the San Jorge Project: 

• All applicable environmental laws will be given due regard during the planning 

and implementation of facilities' construction and operation; 

• Management and employees at all levels will be kept aware of the project's 

environmental responsibilities through proper training; 

• Procedural reviews and risk assessment will be conducted periodically to 

identify any aspect which could cause environmental damage during facility 

construction and operations to permit reasonable corrective actions to be 

taken in a timely manner; and 

• At all organization levels, the environmental factors will be considered in the 

decision making process.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 326 OF 461 

22.1.2 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Below are the key elements of Coro's Environmental Management System: 

• Environmental issues are considered in the early stages of projects. MMDS 

(Mining and Minerals for Sustainable Development), IFC (International Finance 

Corporation) and WBG (World Bank Group) guidelines and codes of best 

practice are taken into account for any of Coro's projects; 

• Environmental issues will be incorporated into project procedures wherever 

relevant; 

• Environmental objectives will be included in the key performance indicators for 

projects; 

• Monitoring programs will be established to provide early warning of any 

deficiencies in the project's safeguards; 

• A review of management procedures will be made periodically to confirm their 

suitability for complying with the environmental responsibilities; 

• Audits will be conducted to verify environmental compliance at appropriate 

intervals; 

• • an environmental incident reporting system will be established and 

reports issued in a timely manner; and  

• Procedures will be established to assure fluid communications with 

government agencies. 

 

22.2 ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING FRAMEWORK 

National Law Nº 24.585, which provides the framework for national environmental 

regulations, introduced into the National Mining Code environmental protection 

requirements for the mining industry. Law Nº 5.961 is the environmental law for the 

province of Mendoza. Rules related to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 

and its procedure are stated by Provincial Decree Nº 820 of May 16th 2006, in 



 

CORO MINING CORPORATION TECHNICAL REPORT

ARGENTINA 
REV. 0

 

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 327 OF 461 

accordance with both National and Provincial laws. This Decree addresses the 

following: 

• Regulation of an interdisciplinary organization to evaluate mining projects 

(Interdisciplinary Commission for Mining Environmental Evaluation – CEIAM 

according to its Spanish acronym); 

• Regulation of the consultative councils; 

• Regulation of access to information and public participation included a public 

audience process; and 

• Regulation of the establishment of standards for environmental quality and 

emissions. 

The Decree does not specify a deadline for the EIA approval process, but it normally 

requires at least 180 days from the date the EIA is submitted. A period of 270 days 

has been estimated according to an analysis of the administrative schedule, with no 

considerable delays, according to Decree Nº 820. Said schedule does not include the 

public audience process, which may require 60 days. The approval process is 

completed with an official resolution, Environmental Impact Declaration, which 

approves the EIA and establishes obligations for future environmental management of 

the project. The Environmental Impact Declaration can be appealed to the Governor 

and to the Provincial Supreme Court of Justice. The EIA must be updated within a 

maximum period of 2 years. 

Regarding San Juan Province, Law N° 7687 and Law N° 7458 provide the framework 

for mining authority. The Decree 1426/96 and the Provincial Law Nº 6800 and Law Nº 

7620 rule the EIA procedure. That procedure is similar to Mendoza province, the main 

difference being the absence of a public audience procedure. 

On June 20th, 2007, the Provincial Government of Mendoza passed legislation 

prohibiting the use of certain toxic chemicals, including sulfuric acid, in any mining 

activity in the Province. This law 7722 includes prospection, exploration and 

exploitation project stage and also requires any mining EIA to be ratified by the 

provincial legislature after government approval. On July 23 2007, Coro announced

that it had filed an action to have this Provincial legislation declared unconstitutional, 

and this action continues to advance through the court system. In June 2008, a NI43-

101 compliant Preliminary Assessment technical report was completed by Minproc for 

processing, via conventional flotation and concentration methods, 10 million tons per 

year of San Jorge enriched and primary ores. The EIA process started in September 

of the same year and finished in February 2011 with the provincial government EIA 

granting approval of the EIA; however, its ratification was rejected by the lower 

chamber of the Provincial Legislature in August 2011, as a result of intense pressure 

from environmental groups during the 2011 elections. 

This technical report considers the exploitation of oxides and enriched ores, and their 

transport to San Juan province located 20 km to the north, for processing by heap 

leaching methods. 

 

22.3 BASELINE SURVEYS 

22.3.1 GENERAL INFORMATION 

Since a EIA approval process has been performed for the San Jorge Concentrator 

project, definitive environmental studies have been completed, and provided a 

detailed description of the mine site environmental conditions such as climate and 

meteorology, hydrology, hydrogeology, archaeology, flora and fauna, and social 

background of Uspallata in Mendoza and Barreal in San Juan.  

The local population is generally supportive of the project although concerns have 

been raised about the impact of the project on the environment, particularly the quality 

of the water and air. In the last approval process the authorities requested 

complementary studies that demonstrated that neither the quality nor quantity of 

hydrological resources, nor air quality in the immediate surroundings of the mine site, 

would be affected by the operation. Archaeological sites were also found in the 

project's area of influence and the application authority in Mendoza has set out 

preservation and controlling guidelines.

A strategy for communication with all parties has been developed in order to fully 

explain the potential impacts and the work that will be done to limit these impacts to 

the local mine site. San Jorge has also developed community actions to follow local 

development, environmental sustainability and economic growth, which has been 

published in Community Relationship Reports in 2009 and 2010. 

In this technical report, it is assumed that the environmental factors are unchanged for 

those activities that do not suffer a change in location; i.e. those related to the mine 

site area. For the leaching process plant in San Juan, some of the above 

environmental factors can be extrapolated because of the proximity, and the similarity 

of the physical and biological environment. However, some of them such as 

superficial and underground water will need to be revised and completed during a 

feasibility study stage. 

The baseline studies for the EIA related to San Jorge Project are based upon studies 

completed by various consultants: 

Vector Argentina S.A., 1997 

Vector Argentina S.A. (Vector) prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) 

(exploration stage) for Grupo Minero Aconcagua S.A. (GMA), a previous owner of the 

property, in compliance with Law 24.585 of the Environmental Legal Guidelines for 

Mining Activity of Argentina, and with the regulation approved by COFEMIN 

(Congreso San Carlos de Bariloche). The Vector report provides:  

• A general description of the site environmental conditions and socio-economic 

aspects; and 

• A general description of the exploration activities planned by GMA in 1997, as 

well as a summary of earlier exploration works conducted by others at the site; 

and summary of potential environmental effects of the planned exploration 

work and the means by which they would be mitigated during and after the 

work.

Dames & Moore, 1997 

Northern Orion a previous owner of the property retained the services of Dames & 

Moore (D&M) to perform environmental consulting work for the San Jorge Project. 

The project description presented by D&M summarized the proposed sulfuric acid 

heap leaching and solvent extraction processes for the copper oxide and copper 

sulfide mineralization. The overview noted that mining would be by open-pit methods 

and that the ponds, leach pads, and processing facilities would be protected by liners 

and collection systems to provide a total recirculation process 

The key environmental issues summarized in the overview report were primarily 

related to the transportation or on-site production, storage, and use of sulfuric acid in 

the process. 

In the legal framework section of the report, D&M summarized the 1997 Argentinean 

and Chilean legislation related to the transport of hazardous substances as applicable 

to environmental issues of the San Jorge Project. The summary included reviews of 

the Argentinean and Chilean laws regulating sulfuric acid transport, the Argentinean 

Environmental Protection Law for Mining Activities (including its requirement for 

preparation and submission of EIA reports), and the Province of Mendoza Law 5.961, 

which governs the San Jorge Project on a provincial level in Argentina. 

D&M also outlined the World Bank policy and guidelines on environmental 

assessments for mining projects, and presented a generic summary of the contents 

that should be included in such a report. 

Vector Argentina S.A., 2005-2006 

Vector conducted an Update for the Exploration EIA in October 2005, which was 

approved in October 2006 by means of Decree Nº 65 of the Directorate of Mining and 

Hydrocarbons and Decree Nº 304 of the Directorate of Environmental Control and 

Sanitation.

project 

22.3.2 STUDIES RESULTS COMPILATION 

A. PROJECT AREA 

The project lies along the western margin of the Uspallata Valley.  The valley is a 200 

km long graben that is flanked by the Cordillera Frontal, locally called Cordillera del 

Tigre to the west, which rises to elevations in excess of 5,000 m.a.s.l, and the Pre-

Cordillera to the east, which reaches elevations of approximately 3,000 m.a.s.l. 

Elevation on the property varies from 2,600 to 2,700 m.a.s.l, whereas the base of the 

Uspallata valley floor is at 2,200 to 2,300 m.a.s.l. The principal geomorphological 

features in the area are alluvial fans cut by drainage channels and the pediment 

associated with the Cordillera Frontal (SEGEMAR, Geologia Argentina 1999. Vector 

2007)

D. SOILS 

The soil is highly restrictive to vegetation growth because of its geomorphology and 

the high temperature variation.  The soil geomorphology prevents water retention, 

nutrient retention and root growth, due to high permeability, and hence prevents 

agricultural development in the area.  

For the area of study, the Entisoles soil order has been identified; it is represented by 

typical Torriorthent soils: In these soils, a series of layers with variable particle size 

distribution belonging to a sequence of C horizons can be observed. Superficially, the 

texture is loamy, and at depth it is loamy-silty, with moderate drainage. The organic 

matter content is variable, but always poor. The soils described are located in foothill 

areas, where the presence of boulders in the profile is typical, with hydric erosion that 

varies from moderate to severe. The textures go from sandy to loamy, and the most 

common one is loamy-sandy; its profiles have an important proportion of coarse 

framework (mineral fraction larger than 2 mm of diameter), varying between 8 and 61 

%, with an average of 31 % in volume. The average content of total nitrogen is low

and the presence of phosphorus in most of the area is medium, with a slightly alkaline 

pH (Ferrer Regairaz 1993, INTA 1990, Vector 2007). 

E. HYDROLOGY 

Figure 22.2 shows the Yalguaraz and Uspallata basins and the hydrological 

characterization of the area that is going to be influenced by the project - the El Tigre 

stream basins. 

El Tigre Stream Basin 

This is the most important water flow in the project area. The El Tigre stream basin 

starts in the high mountain at an elevation of 5,000 m.a.s.l and finishes before 

reaching Route 39 into the Yalguaraz Ranch at an elevation of 2,000 m.a.s.l, 

approximately to 4.5 km to the north-east of the mine site.

The EIA will include a general water balance of the above stream's hydrologic 

systems considering recharge, storage and discharge (INA 1995, CRAS 1992, Vector 

2007). 

F. WATER QUALITY 

Coro has been sampling the surface of the El Tigre stream and analyzing the water to 

determine the physical and chemical quality of the water and to study the potential 

effects that mining operations might have it. 

In general, the quality of the El Tigre stream is very good, as it originates from the 

melting of snow accumulated during winter. 

Table 22.4 shows the chemical analysis of the water stream that is used by the project 

and the results of the first quarterly monitoring campaign. A comparison of the water 

analysis with the Argentinean norms, as well as international guidelines, for potable

G. HYDRO-GEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION  

The low flow temporary streams (or arroyos) disappear in the alluvial deposits that go 

down from the mountainous fronts before reaching the lower sector of the sub-basin. 

These courses are part of the underground water recharge that makes up the 

Yalguaráz Aquifer. 

This depression, filled with quaternary sediments, has an area of approximately 150 

km2. On the North and the South, it is separated from other underground water basins 

existing in the Uspallata-Calingasta Valley by structural highs of the not-outcropping 

or partially outcropping basement.  

In order to determine its structure and relation to other nearby basins, 10 (ten) VESs 

(Vertical Electrical Soundings) were conducted (Table 22.5).

Results

Based on the results obtained at each of the VESs and their integration in continuous 

profiles in order to determine the underground dynamics, 4 (four) points were 

established to place future wells for monitoring purposes and water table control.

Conclusions and recommendations 

Four programmed exploration wells were drilled, and the following conclusions and 

recommendations were prepared as a result:  

• Well SJ_PM_3 was the only one that went through the complete alluvial layer, 

reaching the hydro-geological basement at 142 meters.

• At drillhole SJ_PM_2, the water level is almost at the last part of the tubing, 

with seasonal variations, but there is no correspondence between this level 

and that of well SJ_PM_3. 

• Integrating these results with the interpretation of SEV7 and SEV4, and 

considering the rock outcrops corresponding to Cerro del Tigre and smaller 

units, it could be inferred that in this sector there may be a basement block 

higher than the surroundings.  

• This higher block would divide the underground waters in this area and there 

would be no communication between both sub-basins.  

• Arroyo del Tigre would contribute width-wise in all its cones -both the present 

and the old ones- therefore, it would recharge the underground waters whose 

flow moves towards Yalguaraz and the ones with tendency towards the 

depocenter, located towards the South.  

• Although the superficial area of Uspallata Valley is located along only one 

tectonic depression -approximately 40 km long- the behavior of the 

underground basin is different from this model, and there exist very important 

local subdivisions.  

• To determine a possible basin closure in the Southern aquifer, it is 

recommended to conduct a morphological-structural analysis of the Uspallata

Electrical Soundings in the possible closure areas, and the verification of the 

indirect studies by means of exploratory perforations, located based on the 

geophysical exploration results.  

• By means of the new exploration wells, a piezometric level outline should be 

prepared for the area of influence, which could be affected by the Project 

activities.  

• In case it is required to carry out drilling for water production, it should be 

placed in the area surrounding drillhole No. 1, since water in that area is at the 

most superficial level.

• The drilling to be carried out should be planned in principle and at exploratory 

level, at least at 150 meters deep, and then an electrical profiling should be 

carried out to define the most convenient tubing design. 

H.  FLORA AND FAUNA 

The vegetation is typified by sparse, low-lying brush, cactus and patches of tic-bladed 

grasses. There were 37 flora species identified in the project and surrounding areas of 

which one of them, a cactus - Denmoza rhodacantha - is listed in Appendix II of 

CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). None of the other 

species was reported as in the endangered or threatened category. 

Thirty-eight species of fauna were identified of which 27 were birds, 9 mammals, 1 

reptile and 1 amphibian. Birds such as "chimango" (Milvago chimango), pigeon 

(Columba livia), "torcacita" (Columbina picus), "torcaza" (Zenaida auriculada) and 

"gorrión" (Passer domesticus, the common, domestic or European sparrow) were 

most abundant; but a condor (Vultur gryphus) and a species of eagle (Geranoetus 

melanoleucus) were also observed. The mammals were the "guanaco" (Lama 

guanicoe), hare (Lepus europeous), foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus and Pseudalopex 

griseus), and diverse species of field mice (Roig, Martinez Carretero, IADIZA 1998, 

Vector 2007) 

I. ARCHAEOLOGY  

Thirty-four archaeological points of interest were found which were classified within 

the pre-ceramic, agro-potter and Inca periods. The reference to the Inka road, which 

would be moved parallel to Provincial Route Nº 39 in the access to the Project, is 

noteworthy. Most of them indicate traces from temporary indigenous settlements that 

hunted, collected and processed prey in the upper part of the Aº El Tigre valley. There 

are five points in the project area that would require mitigation measures and 

complementary studies (Barcena 1997, 2001, 2002, Schobinger 1976, Vector 2007) 

J. SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND 

The socio-economic background of the project is based on the studies carried out by 

Vector in Uspallata, Las Heras Department, Mendoza Province (INDEC 2001,

Municipalidad de Uspallata, Vector 2007) 

Demographics 

According to the 2001 census, there were 5,217 inhabitants registered in Uspallata.  

This represents 2% of Las Heras' population and only 0.3% of the population of 

Mendoza province.  Despite the demographic density of Las Heras of 20.25 

inhabitants per square kilometer, in Uspallata it is only 0.61 inhabitants per square 

kilometer. 

Housing

About 34% of the houses are made of "adobe" (a mix of mud and clay) and 59% of 

the houses have from one to three rooms of which one is used as a kitchen. About 

40% of the inhabitants do not live in single family dwellings and 87.8% of the houses 

have at least 6 people living in them.  

Infrastructure and Services 

The community has neither sewerage nor a reticulated gas supply, and only 58% of 

the population has access to potable water. Electricity is supplied to 95% of the 

housing. These figures differ from the better corresponding statistics on a 

departmental and provincial level.  

The main road access for Uspallata is National Route 7 which connects Mendoza with 

Santiago in Chile. Provincial Route 149 connects Uspallata with Barreal in San Juan 

Province. 

Employment

In Uspallata about half of the population is under 24 years of age and 60% percent is 

classified as economically active. However, 26.4% did not finish their schooling. About 

30% of economically active people are unemployed.  The main economic activities 

are focused on agriculture, craftwork, tailoring and tourism. 

Education and Health Service

The community has five schools, of which two are primary, two are secondary and 

one is a kindergarten.  In addition, there are two schools for adults, one primary level 

and the other secondary. 

Regarding further education, Uspallata has a technical institute for management and 

administration:  "Escuela Superior en Gestión de Empersas y Microemprendimientos". 

Uspallata has one hospital which is classified as medium-low complexity. 

 

22.4 CLOSURE AND ABANDONMENT STAGE 

The following is a description of the project closure and abandonment stages. The 

purpose of this description is to provide a summary of activities necessary to perform 

the environmental impact assessment. 

The last stage of the project comprises the execution of a planned closure and 

abandonment of the mine and process plant and their associated facilities. A 

progressive closure should be considered (closure should be planned since 

construction day 1) Closure includes all the land reconditioning, equipment 

demobilization and facilities demolition activities and monitoring of the physical and 

chemical stability of all its components (mine, dumps and abandonment areas). 

Abandonment refers to the project area status after completion of the closure 

activities. 

It is important to highlight that the material described in this section is presented in 

terms of design and handling criteria, with general guidelines to provide the project 

with the necessary flexibility to suit the changes inherent to the regional development 

and the economic status at the time in which such activities are completed. 

The main objective of the closure plan is to prevent any adverse effect to either the 

environment or public safety once the project lifetime is completed, and to mitigate the 

environmental impacts that may occur during the closure activities and, to the greatest 

extent reasonably practicable, recover the original site condition.

23.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST 

23.1 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE 

23.1.1 SUMMARY 

Coro plans to develop the San Jorge property by establishing an open pit mining 

operation and a crushing plant at the mine site, an ore railway transport system, and a 

heap leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning processing plant, located 20 km to the 

north in San Juan province, capable of a throughput of up to 6.3 Mt/y of ore, over a 

mine life of 10 years to produce 25,000 t/y of cathode copper. The development also 

includes an Acid Plant from sulfur burning to supply the sulfuric acid required for 

leaching process. 

The acid and co-generation plant cost was based on budget pricing from Haldor 

Topsoe, to which was added a provision for QA/QC and scope definition to 

Argentinean design standards. 

Closure costs were estimated based on a strategy devised by Vector in 2007. 

The capital cost estimate for the mining operation, process plant and infrastructure 

has a base date of 4th Quarter 2011, is expressed in United States dollars and is 

estimated to an accuracy of ± 25%.

• Water supply - water consumption was estimated at 240 m3 per day (assuming 

8 passes per day of a 30 m3 truck), and 

• Road between the truck shop and the mine. 

A budget estimate of US$2.2M for the maintenance shop and offices was made using 

other similar examples as a reference.  

A total of $180.000 was estimated for the road, estimated for a total length of 1.5 km 

and a cost of $120.000 per km. 

Also US$2.8M was considered for pre-stripping initial capital, corresponding to a one 

quarter of the waste for the first year. 

The total capital estimated for the mine is US$ 22M, excluding $980.000 in sustaining 

capital.

expectations embedded in the estimate - changes which arise from outside or 

unpredictable circumstances. 

These include, but are not limited to, exchange rate variations from the estimate 

basis, escalation on materials and equipment, escalation of field construction labor 

costs above the base line escalation of 4Q2011, abnormalities in industrial relations, 

market conditions, inclement weather, or adverse political or regulatory developments. 

Project contingency as defined above was estimated by Coro at $5M, with an 

additional contingency for project closure of $5.24M. 

Accuracy Provision 

The component estimates were developed at bare cost (excluding accuracy 

provision). 

An accuracy provision allowance was then allocated to each area and element of the 

direct and indirect costs to reflect the level of definition available in the scope of work. 

The purpose of the accuracy provisions is to make allowance for uncertain elements 

of costs to cover such factors as: 

• Accuracy of material and labour rates; 

• Accuracy of productivity expectations; 

• Accuracy of equipment budget pricing; 

• Lack of direct knowledge of local contractor capabilities; and 

• Lack of direct knowledge of local permitting methods, procedures and 

outcomes. 

The sum of the estimated bare costs and accuracy provisions is the total estimated 

cost for the project. The US$185M initial capital cost includes US$15M in accuracy 

provisions.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 357 OF 461 

The capital cost estimate was structured into the following major categories - direct 

costs and indirect costs. 

Direct costs included: 

• Supply of permanent equipment and materials and fixed and mobile 

equipment; 

• Labor to undertake and manage the construction, installation and service 

activities. This includes wages and salaries with loadings for site labour, 

supervision and management, including associated expenses such as 

accommodation, messing and travel, and home and/or satellite office 

management expenses; 

• Supply of construction support facilities and services such as water, site roads, 

lay down areas and including maintenance of these facilities; 

• Contractors and suppliers mark-up and profit; and 

• Freight and shipping expenses for permanent and temporary equipment and 

materials. 

Indirect costs included: 

• Engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) services, 

together with construction supervision and commissioning of the plant; 

• Supply of temporary equipment, materials, consumables and small tools; and 

• Initial capital spares for permanent equipment and first fill of reagents and 

consumables. 

Local Supply, Construction Rates and Capabilities: 

Pricing was established based on local contractors for earthworks, concrete, and 

structural-mechanical-piping (SMP) works. Allowances for heavy lift cranage and plant 

and equipment were included. A gang labor rate was built up on the basis of a team of 

a small high expatriated group and skilled Argentinean artisans (with locals providing 

the unskilled work component.

The labor rates used are considered an "all-in" rate expressed in US Dollars and 

include: 

• Base labor rate, payroll burdens, overtime premiums; 

• Meals and accommodation for all supervision and labor;  

• Small tools and consumables, including safety consumables; 

• Contractor supervision and overheads; 

• Construction equipment – except major cranage; 

• Contractor's temporary facilities; 

• Contractors insurances; and 

• Mark up and profit. 

23.1.4 FIRST FILLS 

The quantities for first fill reagents, consumables, fuels and lubricants were estimated 

according to process requirements. Pricing is based on quotations from international 

suppliers. 

Wear steel for the crushing plant is assumed to be available as consignment stock in 

the warehouse.

23.1.5 DEFERRED AND SUSTAINING CAPITAL COSTS 

Deferred capital costs are those that can be delayed until after the commencement of 

operations. 

Sustaining capital is defined as the annual capital required for replacing equipment 

items that have served their useful life.  

A. DEFERRED CAPITAL COSTS 

The mine capital cost estimate included the deferral of $980,000 of mine capital to 

Year 2 of the project. 

B. SUSTAINING CAPITAL COSTS 

Average annual sustaining capital costs were estimated at $1,227,000 per year based 

on 1% of original capital cost. 

C. CLOSURE COSTS 

The pit closure will include: 

• The slopes of the pit walls will be assessed and adjusted if necessary to attain 

safe long-term structural conditions; 

• Placement of a 2 m high berm around the pit perimeter to limit access and to 

reduce erosion;

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 361 OF 461 

• Construction of drainage diversion channels to direct surface run-off away 

from the pit and to prevent it from entering the pit; 

• A watchtower will be installed to allow safe monitoring of the pit after closure; 

and 

• Access to the pit will be limited by safety fencing and safety signs will warn of 

potential hazards in the area. 

All costs for waste dump construction are included in the mine operating costs for the 

project. Deposits of sterile leached gravels and waste dumps will remain in the area at 

mine closure. 

The slopes of the waste dumps will be assessed, angles of repose adjusted if 

necessary and additional measures put in place to attain a long-term safe condition. 

Ore will be left in place on the last processed ore heaps and the process ponds will be 

abandoned with the impervious membranes left in place and the ponds filled in. 

The plant, equipment and infrastructure will be decommissioned and offered for sale. 

The cost of relocation will be covered by the purchaser. Concrete foundations will be 

covered with alluvial material. 

Electric overhead lines including power poles and cable will be dismantled and sold.  

Haul roads and mine site access roads will be left in place to allow ongoing access for 

monitoring activities when the mine site is abandoned. Unused roads will be blocked 

off. 

Once the process plant and infrastructure has been removed the salvage and special 

waste handling yards will be dismantled and salvage material and special wastes sold 

or disposed of in authorized landfills. Closure of the special waste handling yard will 

comply with statutory requirements.  

Soils in these areas will be assessed for potential contamination and if necessary both 

the salvage and special waste handling yards will be rehabilitated.  

Perimeter fences will be removed, foundations covered and the ground graded.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 362 OF 461 

Once the mine closure tasks are completed no more waste will be disposed of at the 

sanitary landfill. Closure of the sanitary landfill will also comply with statutory 

requirements.  

Once the mine closure initiatives have been completed a five year monitoring and 

inspection program will be put in place. 

Total plant closure costs were estimated by Coro at $5.24M including contingency.  

This included: 

• US$287,580 to adjust the final batter of the waste dumps for long term 

stability; 

• US$500,000 for decommissioning and filling in of the process ponds; 

• US$2.35 million for dismantling and demolition as required of the process plant 

and associated infrastructure; 

• US$221,250 for dismantling the overhead electric power lines; and 

• US$700,000 for dismantling and rehabilitation of the salvage and special 

waste handing yards and rehabilitation of these areas in accordance with 

statutory requirements. 

In addition, the ongoing cost of inspection and monitoring of the site after closure was 

estimated at US$262 500 over five years (Years 11 - 15).  

Table 23.6 shows the total capex for 10 years life of mine.

23.2 OPERATING COST ESTIMATE 

23.2.1 SUMMARY 

The operating costs for the San Jorge Project were estimated in American dollars to 

an accuracy of +/-20% and the base date for the estimate was the 4th Quarter 2011. 

The operating costs were broken into the following cost centres: 

• Mine; 

• Processing; and 

• General and administration. 

The estimated mining, processing and general and administration (G&A) operating 

costs, the mining schedule and the expected annual copper production over the life of 

the mine are shown in Table 23.7. The total operating cost is shown in dollars per ton 

of ore processed ($/t) and converted into cents per pound of copper cathode 

produced (c/lb copper).

25,000 t/y of copper cathode including crushing, railway transport and agglomeration 

of up to 6.3 Mt/y ore, stacking on a heap leach pad, leaching and the recovery of 

copper metal by the solvent extraction – electrowinning (SX-EW) process, and the 

total sulfuric acid production from an sulfur burning plant. The processing costs also 

include maintenance and treatment of waste streams. 

All common administration and support services not attributable to mining or 

processing have been collected in the General and Administration cost centre.  This 

includes general management, accounting, procurement, purchasing and 

warehousing, security, safety and training. 

Mining costs make up 29% and processing represent 56% of the total unit cost of 127 

c/lb of copper. General and administration costs remain essentially constant over the 

life of the operation and represent approximately 15% of the total unit cost. 

The mining cost centre is dominated by hauling and labor totaling more than 70% of 

the mine cost.  

Reagents (39%), railway transport (19%), and operating and maintenance 

consumables (15%) are the largest processing operating costs. 

Services including product transportation, freight and personnel costs 

(accommodation, catering and R&R transport) are the major components of the 

general and administration costs. 

The operating cost estimate excludes currency and commodity price fluctuations and 

duties and taxes.

23.2.2 BASIS OF OPERATING COST ESTIMATE 

A. BASIS OF ESTIMATE – MINING 

Information included in the model was obtained from various sources including 

equipment suppliers, similar operating mines, mining contractors and empirical 

calculations. 

Mine operating costs were calculated annually over the 10 year life of mine. The basis 

used in developing these costs were the required equipment operating hours, the unit 

rates applied to the different types of equipment, personnel requirements and unit 

costs for materials, services and labor. 

The mining costs include all mining operations required to feed ore to the primary 

crusher and the removal and haulage of waste to the disposal site. All costs 

associated with operation and maintenance of the mine is included. Contractors have 

been allowed for blasting operations and mining equipment maintenance. 

B. BASIS OF ESTIMATE – PROCESSING 

A detailed operating cost model was used to estimate costs incurred in the process 

plant, administration and the supporting services and infrastructure required for the 

operation. 

Annual operating costs have been estimated for reagents, labor, power, contractors, 

consumables and miscellaneous items. The life of mine production schedule was 

applied to unit costs on a $/t ore and $/t copper basis where appropriate to calculate 

annual operating costs. 

Operating cost estimates are based on the operating plans prepared for the 

processing functions.  The ore processing schedule and the process design criteria 

provided the basis for the estimation of reagent, power, contractor and consumable 

costs.  The estimates were derived for each of the cost centers using the methods 

detailed below.

Reagent unit costs were based on supplier quotations including freight to site. Except 

sulfur which was taken from several sources of Forward Supply/Demand/Pricing 

Forecasts for the Sulfur Market. 

Labor costs were allowed for at 20% of base annualized salaries. All other personnel 

costs including R&R travel, accommodation, clothing and messing were included as 

expense items in the G&A cost estimate. 

Fuel costs were based on 0.41 $/L for diesel delivered to site as it was quoted in 

Argentina for similar mining companies.  

Operating and maintenance consumable costs were based on supplier quotations and 

information derived from Propipe's database and experience with similar heap leach–

SX–EW operations. 

C. BASIS OF ESTIMATE – G&A 

The general and administration (G&A) costs include all costs not associated with 

either mining or processing and these were provided by Coro Mining corporation 

(Coro).  The G&A operating costs include labor, vehicles and other administration 

costs. 

Labor on-costs have been allowed for at 20% of base annualized salaries. Other 

personnel costs including R&R travel, clothing and accommodation and messing are 

collected under "Other Costs" in the G&A estimate.   

D. EXCLUSIONS 

The operating cost estimate excludes: 

• Marketing agency fees; 

• Cost of cathode freight from San Jorge site to purchaser; 

• Currency and commodity price fluctuations; and 

• Duties and taxes.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 369 OF 461 

The mining operating cost estimate was based on mining about 17,200 t of ore per 

day and a similar amount of waste, for a maximum total of 39,000 t/d, for 365 days per 

year. 

Mine operating costs were calculated annually for all the mine life periods. The basis 

used in developing these costs were the required equipment operating hours, the unit 

rates applied to the different types of equipment, personnel requirements, and unit 

costs for materials, services and labor.  

A summary by year for mining operating costs is presented in Table 23.8.

H. MINE OPERATIONS LABOR 

Mine operations manpower was estimated as a function of the number of equipment 

items in the fleet for every year of the mine plan. 

The number of operators was calculated assigning four operators to each unit. In the 

case of trucks and auxiliary equipments, a 0.9 factor has also been applied to account 

for the fleet availability. A 0.8 factor was used for auxiliary equipment. 

A 15% of extra labor force was considered for absenteeism, including vacations, 

sickness, etc. 

All the units operations will be carried out with the owner's personnel, with the 

exception of blasting and maintenance. 

Table 23.18 shows the calculation of the operation manpower for each unit operation 

per period of the plan.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 384 OF 461 

B. REAGENTS 

Reagent consumption estimates are based on: 

• Column leach test work and process modeling; 

• Process plant mass balance; and 

• Typical operating parameters for SX-EW plants. 

Budget quotes from suppliers which include freight to site have been used for major 

plant reagents. 

Reagent unit costs and consumptions are provided in Table 23.21. 

Table 23.21: Reagent Unit Costs and Consumptions 

Unit Cost
$/t

Extractant (LIX984N) 10,450 1.8 kg/t
Diluent (escaid 110) 1,390 25 kg/t
Sulfur 230 17-32 kg/t Inc´ $80/t Freight
Cobalt Sulfate (8% solution) 4,166 2.9 kg/t
Clay 1400 0.29 kg/t
Guar (t) 6,500 0.21 kg/t
Water 0.11 0.3 m3/t

Reagents Comsumption Comment

 

Extractant consumption is based on historical performance of a number of South 
American SX-EW operations provided by a major extractant supplier. 

Diluent consumption is made on the same basis as extractant consumption and this 
includes an allowance for evaporation losses. 

Sulfur consumption is based on the acid requirement calculated through process 
modeling that suggests that net acid consumption varies between 17 kg/t for enriched 

ore up to 40 kg/t for oxide ore.  Replacement acid in electrowinning for the acid lost in 

the iron bleed has been allowed for at 1.5 kg/t ore. 

Cobalt sulfate consumption is proportional to the electrolyte bleed required to 
maintain an iron concentration in electrolyte of 1.5 g/l and a cobalt concentration in 

electrolyte of 150 ppm based on an expected PLS iron concentration of about 7 g/L.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 385 OF 461 

Guar consumption is based on the standard industry application rate of 0.15-0.20 kg/t 
of cathode copper and remains constant throughout the mine life reflecting the 

constant copper production of 25,000 t/y. 

C. LABOR 

Labor costs include salary and cost charges for managerial, technical, supervisory, 

operating and maintenance staff at the plant.  Processing labor estimates have been 

developed assuming 12 hour shifts and a three panel shift roster.  Annualized salaries 

were based on similar mining projects in Argentina. A provision of 20% of base 

annualised salaries for labour cost contingencies have been allowed for. 

A manning schedule for processing personnel was developed assuming that the 

majority of the workforce will be sourced from San Juan and Mendoza province. 

The manning schedule provides for a maximum of 90 processing personnel and 25 

maintenance personnel.   

The processing supervision and technical group consists of 1 process superintendent, 

1 metallurgist, 1 metallurgical technician, 1 chemist, and 10 supervisors. In addition, 

there are 8 laboratory assistants. 

The processing operations group will consist of 53 operators. Each crushing, 

agglomeration, stacking and heap irrigation installation, monitoring and maintenance 

will be undertaken by a crew of 6 on each shift.  The SX-EW Plant including cathode 

stripping will be operated by a crew of 5 on each shift.  

The maintenance group will consist of 25 personnel including 7 maintenance 

supervisors, 10 mechanical tradesmen and 8 electrical-instrument tradesmen who will 

be responsible for the process plant and infrastructure.   

D. POWER 

Almost half of power is supplied from the sulfuric acid plant.  The required additional 

power will be supplied from the grid by a 66kV line from Calingasta in San Juan at 

0.08 $/kWh. 

E. CONSUMABLES

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 386 OF 461 

Operating Consumables 

Major operating parts and materials that will be consumed in processing up to 6.3 

million t/y of ore to produce 25,000 t/y of copper cathode include: 

• Feeder liners; 

• Crusher liners; 

• Screen decks; 

• Heap leach irrigation equipment; 

• Cathode mother plates; and 

• Lead anodes. 

The expected costs in $/t ore of crushing circuit wear parts such as feeder liners, 

crusher liners, and screen decks is based on a similar heap leach operation in Chile.  

The heap leach irrigation system has been designed so that it can be moved from cell 

to cell as required.  An allowance for emitter, piping and valve replacement has been 

allowed for in the estimate.  

Each cathode mother plate is handled by crane and through the cathode stripping 

machine each week as part of the tank-house cathode harvesting cycle.  The mother 

plates are sometimes damaged as a result of this handling and also due to chemical 

attack.  Allowance has been made for this normal wear and tear and also for the 

replacement of damaged edge strips.  

Lead anodes have lead alloy blades welded to a "steer horn" shaped copper hanger 

bar encapsulated in lead.  Although they are not handled as often as the cathode 

mother plates the blades deteriorate over time due to lead oxide spalling and an 

allowance has been made for lead anode blade replacement each year.   

Where specific information was unavailable the operating parts and materials have 

been factored off actual costs from a heap leach – solvent extraction – electrowinning 

plant of similar complexity.

Maintenance Consumables 

Maintenance consumable costs comprise maintenance parts and materials and these 

have been estimated as a percentage of the direct installed capital cost (% factor). 

The magnitude of the factors applied are based on typical industry values and the 

maintenance consumable costs derived by this method have been checked against 

an operation of the same size and complexity and found to be consistent.  The 

following factors have been applied to each discipline.  

• Wear steel, operating parts & materials, Crusher 0.35 $/t ore. 

• Operating parts & materials, Liners, Piping, Heap Leach 0.46 $/t ore. 

• Operating parts & materials in SX –EW, 5 $/t of copper cathodes. 

23.2.5 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS 

A. SUMMARY 

The general and administration costs cover those costs that cannot be directly 

assigned to mining or processing.  The annual General and Administration operating 

costs have been estimated by major cost driver: 

• Labor; 

• Vehicles; and 

• Other costs. 

The labor, expenses, accommodation & catering costs, vehicles, transport and 

exporting freight components of the general and administration cost estimate were 

developed based on experience from similar mining projects in Argentina 

The total estimated cost is US$ 9.6 million per year or approximately 18 c/lb copper 

produced. The major G&A costs are product transport & exporting freight ($2.5 

million), accommodation and catering costs ($2.0 million), labor ($3.1 million), general 

expenses ($2.0 million). 

A summary by year for mining operating costs is presented in Table 23.22.

24.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

An Excel™ spreadsheet cash flow analysis of the San Jorge Project was prepared 

using data from models developed by the major contributors to the pre-feasibility 

study for capital and operating costs, including mining, processing and general and 

administration estimates. 

The primary assessment criterion of project viability was determined by specific 

calculations of the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) using 

project cash flows and Base Case at a constant $2.80/lb copper price over the life of 

mine. 

24.1 HIGHLIGHTS 

• Measured and Indicated Resources of oxide and enriched material of 58 

million tonnes at 0.59%CuT containing 342,600 tonnes (750 million lbs) of 

copper  

• Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of oxide and enriched ores of 48 

million tonnes at 0.61% CuT containing 294,600 tonnes (650 million lbs) of 

copper 

• Mine life: 10 years  

• Total copper production: 223,400 tonnes (492 million lbs)  

• Copper price: $2.80/lb, flat 

• Average cash operating costs in years 1 to 5: $1.26/lb Cu 

• Stand-alone acid plant generating Project acid requirements and  contributing 

to power requirements 

• Initial capital costs: $184.5 million (with an accuracy of +/- 25%, including $5 

million in project contingency, $15 million in other provisions and $8.2 million in 

working capital) 

• Pre-tax NPV(10%): $259.5 million, IRR: 41%  

• After tax NPV(10%): $132.7 million, IRR: 29%

24.3 PRODUCTION SCHEDULES 

The project has an annual production rate of cathode copper of approximately 25,000 

t/y. The mining rate varies with the copper grade and proportion of oxide and enriched 

ore processed in order to maintain this cathode production rate throughout the 10 year 

mine life. 

A. MINING AND PROCESSING 

The annual tonnages of moved and processed ore are shown in Table 24.3

ARGENTINA 
REV. 0

 

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 397 OF 461 

B. PLANT PERFORMANCE 

The processing plant will produce approximately 25,000 t/y cathode copper The 

average copper recoveries assumed for this study and the base case economic model 

are 85% CuT for oxide ore and 66% CuT for enriched ore. 

 

24.4 CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 

The Project was evaluated on both a pre-tax basis and after all taxes, including export 

levy and provincial royalty. The Base Case operating cash flow peaks at $76 million in 

the 2sd year with a minimum cash flow of $23 million in the 10th year, which is the last 

operating period, as shown in Table 24.4.

25.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

25.1 GEOTECHNICAL 

25.1.1 SITE GEOTECHNICAL STUDY 

Several consultants have been requested for Coro to undertake the execution of a 

Geotechnical Study for San Jorge Copper Project: Vector Argentina (VASA) in 2007 

and 2008; SRK Consulting 2008; and recently Geoinvestment in 2011. 

The scope of work of VASA was divided in two stages: 

• Stage 1: Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS). 

o Preliminary Design Report. 

o Seismic and Geological Risk Report. 

o Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation. 

o Basic Engineering for the Heap Leach. 

• Stage 2: Final Feasibility Study (FFS.) 

o Final Geotechnical Investigation. 

o Final Design Report. 

o Materials required for the construction & budget. 

The objective of Stage 1 was to have available basic information coming from real 

data or assumed parameters based on VASA's expertise to support a capital cost 

estimate to complete the Preliminary Financial Evaluation included in the PFS. 

For Stage 2, the objectives were to confirm the assumed parameters or correct them if 

required, and complete the investigation, design, materials required for the 

construction, and budget for the Final Financial Assessment and FFS report. 

The Study was scheduled from June 2007 to the beginning of January 2008 and was 

stopped at the end of July 2007 by Coro because of the ban on sulfuric acid use in the 

mining industry by the Mendoza Parliament. Consequently, the Preliminary 

Geotechnical Investigation was only conducted partially.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 402 OF 461 

In general terms, the scope of VASA's Geotechnical Study included the following 

tasks:  

• Analysis of general site conditions this includes seismic and geological risk 

assessment; 

• Design criteria and engineering works initially, this included determining 

geotechnical parameters required for the design of facilities such as the open 

pit, leach pad, waste dumps, ore heaps, process plant and the facilities 

footprints; and later, the engineering development for the above facilities was 

to be considered; and 

• Site investigation to determine the availability of materials to perform the 

earthworks and civil works. 

The second and third tasks were split with the purpose of having a preliminary design 

report for the project Preliminary Feasibility Study stage, where the parameters for 

civil works and the geotechnical characteristics were determined based on the 

available site information and Vector's expertise. That report must be confirmed with 

the completion of the Geotechnical Study, which will be included in the Final 

Feasibility Study.  

The following summarizes information which is detailed in other reports developed by 

VASA: "Geological Risk, and Seismic and Hydraulic Risk Assessment", "San Jorge 

Geotechnical Campaign" and "Heap Leach Conceptual Engineering Report" 

((INPRES 1998 & 1995, Ramos 1996, Vector 2007) 

A summary of the main information and parameters is presented below: 

• The seismic risk assessment indicated a Maximum Potential Earthquake of Ms 

7.6 with 400-500 years of recurrence for the project site. For the plant facilities 

the design must consider the Argentine Seismic Code INPRES-CIRSOC 103 

with a Very High factor or its equivalent in the UBC Seismic Code. 

• The analysis did not detect any important geological risk associated to 

exogenous geodynamic events. Moreover, VASA did not find any condition for

mass landslide in the project facilities. The main seismic risks are not 

associated to potential ground failures or deformations, and it is more likely to 

have secondary seismic effects that could produce slope instability and 

liquefaction in sand deposits or instability of alluvial terraces close to Arroyo El 

Tigre. 

• There exist fast/occasional floods associated with alluvial fans and dry stream 

beds during the rainy seasons. The project facilities should consider water 

intake and deviation works in order to avoid damages. 

• The "insitu" density values are all above 1.8 t/m3 (assumed previously) 

reaching a maximum of 2.2 t/m3. The average indicated a value of 2.0 t/m3, 

eliminating the maximum values found above 2.3 t/m3. 

• From the global result of the 26 dynamic penetration tests (SPT) developed at 

different depths, the foundation soil for the different structures may be 

characterized as very dense, according to what is established by the 

specialized bibliography.  

• The results of the total soluble salts are below the generally recognized limit 

between 3% and 5%, except in the strong cementation zone called "Indian 

concrete", where considerably higher values were found and it is 

recommended to carry out further studies. 

• The angles adopted for the open pit have been decided on the main basis of 

the high recovery rate obtained in the perforations and on the dip of the main 

faults that affect the deposit. The angles adopted are 1H: 3V or 70.53º for the 

rocks and 1H: 1.5V or 48.19º for modern sediments. 

• It is estimated that approximately 8 km upstream of El Tigre, there are enough 

borrow materials for the civil works, the concrete and the leach pads drain 

system. Since the natural drainage material for the leach pad areas is located 

in a MSJ property, an extraction and transportation cost of US$5 per ton 

should be allowed.

• The fine material required under the leach pad liner is available at Ciénaga de 

Yalguaraz at about 15 kilometers from the plant facilities. Since these borrow 

material zones are located in a MSJ property, an extraction and transportation 

cost of US$ 9.40 per ton should be allowed. 

The items listed below still need to be completed or confirmed: 

• Report of laboratory testing conducted on the samples gathered in the field 

campaign; 

• General geotechnical description of the area of works and recommended 

parameters; 

• Estimation of material quantities for construction; 

• Estimation of cost by material; 

• Report on parameters for the analysis of footprint conditions of the different 

structures;  

• Availability of borrow materials for concrete or other purposes; 

• Geotechnical investigation; 

• Determination of seismic acceleration for project verification; and 

• Final design report. 

In 2008 Coro commissioned SRK to performed geotechnical studies related to 

geology, mining and soils for the San Jorge Concentrator project preliminary 

assessment which was looking for sulfides ore treatment because of acid sulfuric ban 

in mendoza. That information was reported in: "Memo 01 2200 03-01, Geología 

Geotécnica, Hidrología e Hidrogeología, Geotecnia Minera, Geotecnia Suelos, 

Botaderos – Rellenos, y Depósitos de Colas en Pasta para que MCA pueda 

establecer la factibilidad técnica y económica de la explotación por Rajo Abierto del 

Yacimiento San Jorge". As result, no important discrepancies were found regarding 

VASA conclusions report in 2007.

Propipe through its sub consultant Geoinvestment revised the heap leach foundation 

soil properties for performing the heap stability study in the new facilities location in 

San Juan. Since the geotechnical frameworks in both locations are very similar, no 

discrepancies were reported. 

In summary, a preliminary analysis of the project geotechnical parameters has been 

conducted, which should be confirmed in the feasibility stage. Based on the 

knowledge acquired in the first geotechnical campaign; the conditions that were 

assumed by VASA may be close to what was expected. Therefore, it is unlikely that 

there would be large calculation discrepancies or out-of-range parameters when the 

Project geotechnical studies are resumed. 

25.1.2 HEAP STABILITY STUDY 

Propipe requested Geoinvestment verify the stability of the heap leach, considering 

the new design, location and configuration. In that design, the heap orientation in the 

land and its footprint dimensions were also modified. The resultant report included the 

model plots, which showed the critical failure surfaces, the critical safety coefficient 

and the parameters adopted for the model.   

In this new design, placing an intermediate geomembrane between layers (interlift) 

was considered. The hydrostatic head level of the solution was placed 1 m above the 

geomembrane.  

Stability analyses were conducted for circular failures at the heap slopes at the end of 

the construction. These analyses indicate a safety factor result above the established 

standards, minimum static safety factor: 1.3 and minimum pseudo-static factor: 1.0 for 

these kinds of possible failures. 

For the pseudo-static analysis (with earthquake), a horizontal acceleration of 0.145g 

was used, that is to say, half of the vertical seismic acceleration (0.29g). These 

adopted values should be reviewed in later studies to determine the project 

earthquake risk.  

In order to determine the most unfavorable conditions, an analysis of the two main 

heap layouts was conducted (longitudinal and transverse). Three sections were

considered, including the footprint steepest slope with the ore heap slopes 

corresponding to the longitudinal section in order to ensure that the safety factors to 

be obtained are theoretically the lowest possible ones. 

The slope considered for each fill layer of material to be leached was 36º. 

Four pits were made in the pile new location, were samples were obtained to 

determine the physical properties of the soil and geotechnical parameters to use in 

the stability analysis. Also, for the property of pile and foundation material were used 

the data used in the VASA 2007 analysis report, laboratory tests results and also a 

sensitivity analysis was performed to the characteristic values of the crushed material 

that will form the pile itself, characterized by optimist properties, pessimist properties 

and most probable, properties shown in the following Table 25.1.

The results of the analyses provided safety factors that comply with design 

requirements for slope stability, that is to say, above 1.3 for the static case and above 

1 for the dynamic case. 

Although these results indicate that the design is stable, at a future stage it should be 

verified with the values of the soil and ore parameters obtained from additional geo-

mechanical characterization testing.  

Even though up to the present moment there are no precise data obtained from tests 

to determine the geotechnical characteristics of the heap foundation, with geo-

mechanical values adopted from the practice and experience, the heap is stable both 

statically and under pseudo-static conditions (with earthquake), with the values 

considered in the present analysis and for the diverse conditions adopted in it. 

The geo-mechanical tests for the foundation and ore material characterization will 

allow more certain values regarding the heap safety factors to be obtained. 

25.2 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 

25.2.1 INTRODUCTION 

This implementation plan for the San Jorge Project outlines the proposed strategy for 

the execution of the San Jorge Project including a conceptual contracting strategy for 

the construction of the crushing, agglomeration and stacking plant, leach pads and the 

solvent extraction – electrowinning (SX-EW) plant. The main infrastructure 

implementation considers the construction of a sulfur burning plant to produce sulfuric 

acid, and a railway to transport the ore to the process plant in San Juan. The plan 

includes the engineering, procurement and construction phases through to first 

cathode production and hand over to Coro. A typical project schedule for this process 

would be approximately 18 months, but this is dependent on long lead item supply 

times.   

This strategy deals with the type of contracts and provides recommendations for the 

nature of compensation arrangements. The objective of the plan is to provide the most 

economical approach for implementation of the project. Priorities were to minimize the 

construction period and to maximize the utilization of local resources without risking 

the quality of work.  

These processes include the following: 

• Engineering for the project including earthworks, civil, structural, process, 

mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, control, communications and 

infrastructure; 

• Development of a project schedule that provides package, activity and task 

level durations, timings and interfaces;

• A contracting strategy that embraces the requirements of engineering and 

construction and is in accordance with the requirements of Coro; 

• Supply and procurement functions undertaken in a timely manner based on 

engineering deliverables and construction requirements; 

• Engaging contractors and suppliers capable of fulfilling contractual obligations; 

and 

• Carrying out construction activities including the provision of all temporary 

facilities and ensuring that contractors perform work in accordance with 

contract documentation. 

25.2.2 APPROACH 

A detailed implementation plan will be developed during the Feasibility Study for the 

project. The plan contained herein is preliminary and based on the data available for 

the prefeasibility study. 

Project development will proceed through the following phases: 

• The completion of a Feasibility Study; 

• Basic engineering; 

• Detailed design; 

• Procurement in parallel with the above engineering and design phases; 

• Construction and construction management; 

• Commissioning, and 

• Project operation. 

The project implementation plan covers the phases from feasibility study to 

completion of construction. The project implementation plan was developed from 

general execution concepts and is based on the requirements of information gathered 

during site visits by team members and previous implementation plans for projects of

a similar nature. The implementation plan is an overview of the activities and time 

frames required to implement the San Jorge Project in the time frame indicated. 

25.2.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY 

A Feasibility Study will be prepared to support the final decision to proceed with a 

particular project in a specific, defined way. It will be used to secure project funding 

and approvals, and as the basis for preparing a control budget during the project 

implementation phase.  

The Feasibility Study includes capital and operating costs estimates with an accuracy 

range of ± 15%, or better, unless project specific factors suggest otherwise. 

The Feasibility Study implementation plan will be developed that provides a 

framework and methodology for planning the implementation of the Feasibility Study 

(FS) that includes: 

• A background statement, 

• The scope of project, 

• The scope of work, 

• The scope of services, 

• The study inputs, 

• The study basis, 

• The study objectives, 

• A draft of the FS report table of contents, 

• The participants' responsibility table, 

• An implementation schedule with key Study activities and target dates 

identified, 

• An organization chart that will indicate the relationships and key activities of 

the participating groups, 

• Project specific issues,

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 412 OF 461 

• Provide a glossary of terms for the implementation of the FS, 

• A budget for engineer's services and for the managed activities (via 

consultants) relating to the management and implementation of the FS, and 

• Agreement and sign off by all participants. 

The scope of work for the FS will be based on the findings of  this Technical Report 

and involve more detailed evaluation of the mine design, mine planning, plant layout, 

infrastructure, environmental and permitting issues. 

25.2.4 EPCM PHASE 

The implementation plant for the project is based on an Engineering, Procurement 

and Construction Management (EPCM) execution philosophy. The EPCM Contractor 

will be responsible for the detailed design of the facility, procurement of materials and 

equipment and construction management. 

An organization structure has been developed to match the EPCM Implementation 

Philosophy and the estimate developed. 

The organization for the project includes a home office based Project Director, site 

based Project and Construction Managers with a small team of site based 

supervision. Functional support for Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), Quality 

Assurance and Control (QA/QC), and Employee and Industrial Relations (EIR) will be 

sourced from the EPCM Contractors Head Office Figure 25.2 shows the proposed 

EPCM Organization Chart.

(STP); 

• Contractor area and process plant site collection and transfer to the sewage 

treatment plant; and  

• Sewage treatment and effluent discharge. 

Power

Generators will be provided at the accommodation camp and at the temporary 

construction office site. The following areas/facilities will require power during the 

construction phase: 

• Accommodation camp;  

• Construction offices; 

• Temporary utilities; 

• Water pumps and water treatment plants; 

• Communications network; 

• Sewerage treatment plants and pump out pits; and

• Emergency power for refrigeration and freezers at the camp plus the site 

medical facilities. 

Security

Coro will provide all security for the project. The level of security required during the 

construction phase must be sufficient to comply with duty of care obligations. These 

obligations include securing the various site areas from unauthorized entry and 

maintaining separation from construction activities.  Within the overall framework of 

site security, each contractor will be responsible for the security of their contractor 

offices, facilities, compounds, plant, equipment, tools, etc. 

C. CONSTRUCTION LABOUR 

Employee and Industrial Relations 

The Construction Manager in conjunction with the Project Manager will be responsible 

for industrial relations for the project. 

Source of Labor 

Local labor will be used where the skills are available. Contractors will engage the 

majority of the labor required for the project and will be responsible for selecting 

personnel who have the necessary skills and experience for the scope of work to be 

undertaken.  

Hours of Work and Roster 

The hours of work have been assumed as 70 hours per week spread over 7 days.   

The work roster adopted for the workforce will be 20 days on and 10 days off including 

travel.  This may be extended depending on schedule requirements. 

Personnel Logistics 

Contractors will be responsible for the transportation of their construction workforce to 

and from site.  Contractors based in the accommodation camp and Mendoza and San 

Juan will transport their workforce to the site using buses in order to minimize the use

of private vehicles. Coro supplied labor based outside the mine site will utilize Coro 

transportation. 

Construction Equipment 

Contractors will be responsible for the provision of construction equipment, equipment 

operators, materials and support facilities for their scope of work and duration. 

All contracts will be competitively bid.  Each contractor will provide only the level of 

equipment required for the period necessary, and will then demobilize the surplus 

equipment. 

Construction Fuel 

A temporary storage facility will be constructed for use prior to the commissioning of 

the permanent storage facility. 

It is expected that a single source and type of fuel supply will reduce the fuel costs 

and freight charges for the project. On this basis, a fuel contractor will be organized to 

deliver, store and distribute diesel fuel at a contract rate per liter to contractors and 

Coro during the construction phase. Alternatively, Coro will procure the project diesel 

fuel requirements and sell to all contractors on site. 

All contractors will be encouraged to provide diesel-powered equipment for 

construction and make their own arrangements for alternative fuels.  

Procurement and Contracting Strategy 

The criteria for developing the contracting strategy include: 

• A safe working environment and a strategy that recognizes that a safe working 

environment is paramount for all construction activities; 

• A short construction time - fast track systems will be used for feeding 

engineering and procurement outputs into the construction activities; 

• Cost effective construction - a control system that achieves optimum results for 

any expenditure making process; and

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 420 OF 461 

• Minimize on-site construction labor - a strategy to reduce on-site construction 

work. 

D. CONTRACTING METHODS AND PACKAGING 

There are a number of different contracting methods that may be applied to contracts 

between Coro and contractors to carry out construction work on the project: 

• Lump sum; 

• Schedule of rates; 

• Design and construct;  

• Turnkey; 

• Build/own/operate or build/own/operate/transfer; and 

• Partnering. 

The method selected for a given contract will depend on: 

• The scope of work definition progress at the time of bidding; 

• The design progress at the time of bidding; 

• Schedule constraints, in particular interfaces with other packages; 

• The complexity of the package; and 

• Number of interfaces with other work areas. 

Suppliers and contractors invited to bid for equipment and/or services will have a 

quality management system in place and operating. 

The recommended structure for the contract and supply packages is described below 

and summarized in Table 25.6. 

E. CONTRACT PACKAGES 

The use of Fixed Lump Sum Contract packages reduces the cost risk to the project 

but requires early definition and completion of engineering design. This reinforces the 

importance of finalizing the basic engineering concepts in the feasibility study.

Earthworks 

It is proposed that the bulk earthworks, including leach pads and ponds, haul roads, 

process plant platforms and minor plant works be performed by a civil contractor 

based in Mendoza or San Juan. A Schedule of Rates Contract is recommended for 

this activity, as it allows an earlier start to individual sections of the scope.  

Concrete Works 

The site concrete works package will be tendered on a Fixed Lump Sum Contract 

basis, to local contractors and will be scheduled to allow mobilization and 

commencement of the concrete works by the nominated contractor as soon as 

earthworks completion allows.  

The contractor will be required to establish its own batching plant on site and be 

responsible for sourcing cement, steel reinforcement, sand and aggregate. 

Structural Steelwork & Mechanical Platework Supply and Fabrication 

The structural steelwork and mechanical platework supply and fabrication packages 

will be tendered on a Fixed Lump Sum Contract basis, to Argentinean contractors. 

Generally pre-fabricated steelwork and platework will be supplied. Inspection and 

expediting will be carried out by the EPCM contractor. 

Structural Mechanical Piping Installation 

It is proposed that the structural, mechanical and piping (SMP) installation be 

consolidated into a single contract.  Pre-fabricated structural steel and mechanical 

platework will be free issued to the contractor for installation on site.  This contract 

includes all yard piping and any site fabrication of tanks, bins, etc. 

All new mechanical equipment, valves and piping material will also be free issued to 

the contractor.  Vendor supervision of some packages will be required. 

Shipping and expediting on these materials would be managed by the EPCM 

contractor.

Heavy lift carnage (future maintenance crane) will be free issued to the contractor as 

required. Contractors will be required to provide all of their own smaller cranage 

requirements. 

Electrical, Instrumentation and Control Installation 

The electrical, instrumentation control (EIC) installation and power reticulation lines 

will be undertaken by a single contractor. In addition to the installation scope, the 

contractor will also be responsible for the supply of all electrical reticulation and 

distribution materials and equipment. 

Major electrical components such as motor control centers (MCCs), transformers, 

programmable logic controllers (PLCs), variable speed drives and process control 

systems will be free issued to the contractor on site as will instrumentation.  The 

scope of works will include electrical distribution to respective infrastructure facilities, 

as well as the installation of communications and security systems. 

The EIC installation contract will be awarded on a Fixed Lump Sum Contract basis. 

Major Mechanical Equipment Installation 

The installation of major mechanical equipment will be undertaken by the SMP 

Contractor with assistance from vendor supervision to ensure warranties are 

protected.  Where installation is contracted to the vendor rather than only supervised, 

predominantly expatriate teams of specialized and experienced technicians and 

tradesmen are expected.   Fixed Lump Sum Contracts will be negotiated at the time of 

ordering of the equipment. 

Freight & Logistics 

A global freight and logistics company with previous shipping experience in South 

America will be appointed for the co-ordination of all freight and logistics of goods and 

materials to site.  As part of the services, they will be required to manage packaging of 

goods at their point of dispatch to ensure adequate protection from damage due to 

sea water, rain, and transport over rough roads.  The freight and logistics contract will 

be awarded on a Cost Plus or Schedule of Rates basis.

25.2.8 PROCUREMENT 

A. PROCUREMENT STRATEGY 

The overall procurement strategy is: 

• National sourcing of equipment where possible; 

• International sourcing of equipment as required; 

• Use of "Preferred Suppliers" previously utilized by the EPCM Contractor or 

Coro; and 

• Pre-qualification of bidders not previously used by the EPCM Contractor or 

Coro. 

B. SUPPLY STRATEGY 

The overall supply strategy is currently as summarized in the following items. 

Wherever possible, a fixed lump sum form of contract will be used. This requires that 

the scope of work is defined, the specification is complete and quantities are known. 

For situations where the final quantities of a product or equipment are not known, a 

schedule of rates form of contract (using fixed unit rates) will be used. 

C. PROJECT SUPPLY OF SPECIALISED EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS 

The Project will supply (for issue to siteworks contractors) all specialized equipment 

and some material especially those with a long lead time that would adversely affect 

the project schedule if they were procured by the contractor.  

This gives the project direct control over equipment quality, the choice of equipment 

and equipment manufacturer and direct control over timely equipment delivery. This 

also gives the project the ability to: 

• Purchase long lead-time items at a time to fit the construction schedule, 

• Rationalize spare parts requirements; and 

• Purchase in large quantities and obtain volume discounts.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 424 OF 461 

Contractor supplied "standard" equipment and items will include general structural 

steelwork and platework, piping, electrical cables, electrical equipment and fittings and 

all other equipment not specifically referred to above. Contractor supplied equipment 

and items will reduce the procurement resources required by the EPCM contractor, 

make interface issues the responsibility of the contractor, make standard equipment 

failure issues the responsibility of the contractor and make the contractor responsible 

for standard equipment inaccuracies. 

D. USE OF PROJECT PRICING AGREEMENTS 

Any existing Coro supply agreements that may benefit the project will be adopted for 

the project. 

E. USE OF PREFERRED SUPPLIERS 

Where off the shelf items and equipment are to be purchased, the EPCM contractor's 

preferred supplier lists will be used. Preferred supplier lists will be used for:  

• Valves and instruments; 

• Variable speed drives; 

• High and low voltage switchgear; 

• Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems; and 

• Programmable logic controllers (PLC). 

Coro will provide a list of any preferred suppliers which they wish to nominate to the 

EPCM contractor. 

F. COMMONALITY OF SPARE PARTS 

Equipment types will be rationalized to reduce warehousing space and the cost of 

holding spare parts. 

G. MATERIALS CONTROL 

The receipt of all equipment and materials delivered to the site by the suppliers' freight 

handling contractor will be the responsibility of the site clerk in conjunction with the

discipline supervisors. This will include management of the EPCM contractor's 

equipment laydown, storage and handling requirements and monitoring of delivery 

schedules. In addition, the site clerk will be responsible for minor materials, equipment 

and services purchases from the site office. 

H. CONTRACTS ADMINISTRATION 

The contracts engineer in conjunction with the EPCM project manager will administer 

and contractually control the direct and indirect contracts including the following:  

• Assignment of appropriately skilled staff to administer and control the 

contracts; 

• Ensuring the application of contract procedures are consistent; 

• Ensuring uniformity in the resolution of contractual problems; 

• Monitoring scope work changes and claim / change settlements; and 

• Closing out contracts, warranties, bank guarantees and certificate issue.

25.2.9 SAFETY 

A safety and health plan, based on the EPCM contractor's standard safety and health 

plan, will be developed for the project. The following strategies will apply: 

• Safety criteria and systems, based on the EPCM contractor's standard system, 

will be developed and implemented for the project; 

• Contractual obligations will require minimum acceptable safety and health 

standards and performance by contractors and subcontractors; 

• Measurable safety targets e.g. Lost Time Injury (LTI) frequencies or 

equivalent, will be established and discussed with all contractors. Contractor 

performance will be monitored against these;

• Contractors who have not shown previous good safety performance will not be 

permitted to tender; 

• Contractors who do not perform to project health and safety standards will be 

obliged to meet these standards to continue work; 

• Formal strategies will be developed for all phases of the project so that work 

procedures and personnel attitudes are focused on safety (culture) and not 

forced by policing; 

• All safety related incidents and accidents will be reported, investigated and 

corrective action implemented promptly; 

• Regular safety meetings will be held on-site to enhance awareness and to 

reinforce the individual's responsibility towards safety; 

• Regular safety audits and hazard surveys will be conducted throughout the 

design and construction phases of the project; 

• All personnel will receive an induction and, if necessary, instructive training 

before commencing work on-site, plus ongoing training to reinforce this as 

necessary; 

• Every effort will be made to rigidly prohibit drug abuse amongst the workers 

and control the effects of alcohol consumption; 

• Early purchase of the operations ambulance and fire appliance for use during 

construction; and 

• The Safety Officer will be responsible for safety, first aid and fire prevention 

with respect to all construction work.  

A. INDUCTIONS 

The Safety Officer will be responsible for the induction of all personnel. 

B. MEDICAL ISSUES

A medical facility will be established at the site prior to construction as it is a 

significant distance from the nearest medical facility. Coro will be responsible for 

providing personnel to provide medical services. 

25.2.10 PROJECT SCHEDULE AND CONTROL 

A. SCHEDULE TYPES 

For implementation of the Project, three levels of schedules will be used for project 

control: 

• Project Master Schedule (establishes work goals and overall time frames and 

is used by management to evaluate actual performance against plan); 

• Project Level Schedule (CPM – Critical Path Method schedule representing all 

work activities and deliverables and used to communicate activity status and 

progress – this schedule summarizes to master level); and 

• Control Level Schedule (engineering, procurement, construction and 

commissioning task level schedules – this schedule summarizes to project 

level). 

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE 

The implementation schedule is based on an 18 month execution period from Notice 

to Proceed to first production. 

The critical path for the project is influenced by the long lead items currently identified 

as: 

• Crushing plant equipment; 

• Sulfur burning plant; 

• Railway equipments (locomotive and carriages) 

• Agglomerator; 

• Stacking system; and 

• Rectiformer.

PROCESS AND PIPELINE PROJECTS                PAGE 429 OF 461 

No allowance has been taken to account for the influence of the wet season on critical 

schedule activities such as earthworks and civil construction. Figure 25.3 shows 

project schedule. 

C. SUBCONTRACTOR SCHEDULES 

The schedule prepared by the EPCM contractor provides the overall plan of the 

project. The construction contractors will prepare their own detailed construction 

schedules in accordance with the milestone dates established for each subcontract. 

Within the timeframes, subcontractors will have the latitude to schedule the work to 

suit their particular work plan. 

Each subcontractor will be required to submit his own detailed work schedule within 

the specified period of subcontract award.  This schedule will be reviewed by the 

EPCM contractor and approved once the schedule is in compliance with contract 

requirements. These approved subcontractor schedules will be updated monthly and 

will become the principal means of controlling construction. 

D. SUPPLIER SCHEDULING 

All purchase orders and contracts will include the required project delivery milestones 

as per the project schedule and milestone delivery dates. All selected suppliers will be 

required to provide detailed schedules for their work to facilitate expediting and 

inspection requirements. 

E. PROJECT CONTROLS 

The project controls plan details the project controls activities required for the project.  

The size of the San Jorge Project does not warrant the requirement for a site based 

controls group. Control of siteworks contracts will be provided by the construction 

manager and supervisors with support from the home office based contracts engineer 

and controls group. 

F. CHANGE CONTROL 

All changes will be continuously monitored and impact assessment studies will be 

done as the project becomes aware of events impacting on the schedule.

Potential significant changes to the scope of work will be notified and requested by a 

formal "Change Alert" including a description of the change, anticipated cost and time 

implications. All changes will require the approval of the EPCM contractor's project 

manager and the Client's appointed authorized person. 

Potential significant deviations of cost and time for an activity will be notified by a 

"Trend Alert" including a description of the trend, anticipated cost and time 

implications. 

G. MONTHLY REPORTING 

Monthly reporting will be provided in the form of the EPCM contractor's standard 

reporting format. Any specific reporting requirements, as requested by Client, will be 

incorporated into the standard report format.

27.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

27.1 GENERAL 

The development of the San Jorge property is currently affected by legislation in the 

Province of Mendoza which prohibits the use of toxic substances in mining, including 

sulfuric acid, which is required in the heap leaching of copper ore.  

 As a consequence of this legislation, Coro and Propipe have redesigned the project 

so that ore may be hauled to San Juan province 22 km to the north for processing 

where no restriction on sulfuric acid usage exists.  

The work completed for this report has assessed the potential for the treatment of 

48.4 Mt of ore within the proposed pit boundary by conventional heap leach, solvent 

extraction and electrowinning methods to produce up to 25,000 t copper per year. 

Coro and Propipe have received a legal opinion that there is no legal impediment to 

the transport of the ore between Mendoza and San Juan; and as such, this study 

qualifies as a preliminary feasibility study to CIM standard as defined in National 

Instrument 43-101.The economic results of this PFS are summarized in Table 27.1.

27.2 GEOLOGY AND RESOURCES 

The San Jorge Property is host to a significant sized copper-gold porphyry system, 

which is considered to be an advanced-stage exploration Property. Because of the

validation work undertaken by Coro in 2006 and 2007, the authors are comfortable in 

using the historic data for resource estimation purposes.   

Based on the reviewed information, the drilled portion of the San Jorge porphyry 

system has been relatively well-defined although the system has not been closed in 

all directions. There are also a number of regional geophysical targets that require 

further evaluation and follow-up exploration. The authors also believe that the 

structural geology of the deposit requires further definition as the mineralization 

appears to follow structural trends. 

Although the general grade of the hypogene mineralization is low, there are discrete 

areas of higher-grade hypogene material, which appear to be associated with faulting.   

A later influx of copper-rich solutions into these fault zones and/or fault intersections is 

manifested primarily by an increase in the abundance of chalcopyrite-bearing veins.   

Superimposed on the hypogene mineralization is a supergene-enriched zone, an 

oxide zone and a poorly-developed leached cap. The supergene-enriched zone, is 

characterized by chalcocite, digenite and covellite, and like the hypogene-enriched 

zones, is better developed in, and proximal to, the main fault zones. The oxide zone, 

which is dominated by malachite and chrysocolla mineralization, and the leached 

zone have a greater lateral persistency. 

The north-northeast-trending fault systems were high likely the main influence on the 

distribution of mineralization, and were the principal conduits for the hydrothermal 

fluids. However, the interplay between the north-northeast, east-west and northwest 

systems also appears to have had a significant influence on the distribution of 

mineralization. Associated with the main fault zones and the regions where interplay 

occurs are the zones of higher-grade hypogene, supergene-enriched and often oxide 

mineralization. 

The present mineral resources are NI 43-101 compliant.

27.3 MINING 

Pit optimization, mine design and scheduling have been completed for a 6.3 Mt/y 

process plant.  This work has utilized mineral reserves, and an inventory of 48.4 Mt at 

0.61% CuT of which 55% is oxide and 45% is enriched. The inferred resources were 

considered as waste. Annual average material movements are approximately 10.7 Mt 

representing a strip ratio of approximately 0.77:1 waste: ore. 

Equipment and support facilities for this schedule have been costed. The main 

installations for maintenance will be composed of a maintenance shop dimensions for 

a fleet of 8 trucks of 50 ton capacity, 2 front end loaders, 2 bulldozers, 1 grader, 1 

wheeldozer, 1 water truck and 1 drill rig, representing the most cost effective option. 

 

27.4 METALLURGICAL INFORMATION AND PROCESS DESIGN 

The metallurgy of the oxide composite samples that were selected by Coro and tested 

by SGS was reasonably consistent and indicates consistent copper recovery and 

leach kinetics. However, the metallurgy of the enriched composite samples were more 

variable and will require additional investigation in future feasibility study assessment 

to attribute the cause of the variations and quantify any potential impact on the 

project. 

 

27.5 GEOTECHNICAL INFORMATION 

Some site geotechnical work has been completed, and more field investigations are 

required to make geotechnical design recommendations for the Feasibility Stage, 

especially in the processing plant location in San Juan province. 

The area is in a high seismic zone, which needs to be taken into account in 

engineering design.

27.6 HYDROGEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL INFORMATION. 

Within the immediate project area, the El Tigre de Yalguaraz Stream offers the 

opportunity to access both surface water and groundwater resources. El Tigre de 

Yalguaraz contains the most important water flow in the project area, and has been 

selected as the main source of water. 

Wells have been investigated as an alternative or support source of water. Four 

potential bore-field locations were identified, but the number of wells and their 

configuration requires further study. 

 

27.7 TRANSPORT 

The project will produce copper cathodes that will be sold to either national or 

international companies. Depending on destination, cathodes will be transported in 

trucks from the processing plant directly to final consumer in Argentina or likely to 

ports in Chile. No new infrastructure or major modification requirements are 

forecasted for the storage, loading and freight of the copper cathodes. 

 

27.8 POWER SUPPLY 

Power supply will be obtained from Argentine electrical system (SADI) through a local 

distributor. San Jorge will be connected to the local electrical network by means of a 

66 kV transmission line from Calingasta located at San Juan province. The 93 km 

transmission also considers 66 kV sub-station at San Jorge site. 

 

27.9 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES 

Definitive environmental studies have been completed (Section 22.0), and provided a 

detailed description of the site environmental conditions such as climate and 

meteorology, hydrology, hydrogeology, archaeology, flora and fauna, and social 

background of Uspallata in Mendoza and Barreal in San Juan.

Archaeological sites were found in the project's area of influence and the application 

authority in Mendoza has set out preservation and controlling guidelines. 

The local population is generally supportive of the project, although concerns have 

been raised about the impact of the project on the environment, particularly the quality 

of the water and air. As a strategy for communication with all parties has been 

developed in order to fully explain the potential impacts and the work that will be done 

to limit these impacts to the local mine site, San Jorge has developed community 

actions to follow local development, environmental sustainability and economic 

growth, which has been published in Community Relationship Reports in 2009 and 

2010. 

Local neighborhoods groups and the school community are seen as significant parties 

to involve in this communication process. 

 

27.10 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

An EPCM approach to project implementation is recommended.  A schedule has been 

developed, showing: 

• The DFS study decision can be taken in the next few months, but the final 

study cannot begin until final decision to go ahead be confirmed by national 

and provincial governments 

• Additional key information for metallurgical testing at a DFS level is required, 

which could be available in 6 months. 

• Environmental permits should take approximately 1 year from presentation of 

the relevant studies. 

• The critical path, thereafter, is defined by the acquisition and assembly of key 

equipment which should take approximately 10 months. However, part of the 

sulfur burning acid plant could take up to 15 months. 

• Mineral production could commence in second quarter of 2015.

• Power supply engineering must be completed in parallel with the DFS. This 

will allow sufficient time to ensure that the power supply will be ready on time 

when the plant construction starts.

28.0 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK 

Sufficient metallurgical testwork has been completed for a preliminary feasibility study. 

However, two aspects of metallurgical performance require review and potentially 

further evaluation in a future feasibility study. Firstly, a detailed assessment of the 

feasibility study mine plan and testing of specific samples based on the early years of 

production up to the potential payback point (year 3) is recommended. Secondly, the 

variability in metallurgical performance of the enriched ore requires further 

assessment to determine the cause of this variation and its impact on the project. In 

addition, further work using the CuprochlorTM process may result in improved kinetics 

and Cu recovery. 

The limits of the deposit are well defined, except at depth, where it may be extended. 

In the primary ore a zone has been identified where the grades seem to be higher 

than the average of the deposit. In which case, the total metal Mineral Resource 

Model Update for contained Cu within the mineable resources may be higher than 

estimated. Further investigation is required to confirm this. The optimization of mining 

sequence and ramp layout to improve the grade profile and reduce haul distances is 

recommended.

MINERA SAN JORGE SA", Resolution 36/2001 of the Honorable Council of Mining, Tomo 21, 

fojas 191/198 and 199/204 from the Registro de Negocios de Minas e Hipotecas. 

 

We point out that there are three estacas-mine that are not yet registered in the name of 

MINERA SAN JORGE S.A. and correspond to the following expedients. 

1) 255-D-93 GUSTAVO I 

2) 256-G-93 VIRGILIO 

3) 249-A-93 SILVIA 

 

In the cases addressed on 1) and 2) both rights even though they are not included in the 

original rights cession in the name of Minera San Jorge S.A., nevertheless, as certified by the 

Mines Notary's Office, both appear as belonging to this company, given that Minera San Jorge 

S.A. has paid the corresponding taxes and followed all the procedures in these expedients, for 

which even though in the case of considering that they are not formally at its name, the mining 

prescription contemplated on the 327 article of the Mining Code has occurred on behalf of 

Minera San Jorge S.A.. 

 

D.- The corresponding taxes are paid for.  
 

E.- There are two expedients regarding formation of mining groups, in process: 
1.- 2514-A-03 "A.M.D. S.A. s/ GRUPO MINERO – PRESUUESTO UNIFICADO", which 
measurement was performed in 22-11-2006 and for which the measurement of each of the 

group's estacas is currently being notified. 

2.- 2475-A-03 "MINERA SAN JORGE S.A. P/INSCRIPCIÓN GRUPO MINERO – 
PRESUPUESTO UNIFICADO", not measured yet.

Mr. Minera 
San Jorge S.A. 
Ref. Legal Opinion on judicial and legal aspects for extracting mineral and transport it 
to the San Juan Province 

Given your timely request, we send our "Legal Opinion" referring to the reference 

subject: 

The 7,722 Law in any way prohibits the activity itself, but limits the use of certain 

substances in mining processes. Also it stipulates that the metal projects obtaining its 

corresponding EID shall be ratified by the Provincial Legislature. Therefore the 

extraction and transport of mineral is NOT contemplated in the 7,722 law. 

The San Juan province has no legal norm that forbidden pure and simply the use of 

any substance in the mining processes. It only limits to regulate its handling and use 

following the national and provincial norms on the subject, under the strict control of 

the application authority once its use permit is obtained. 

As for the requisites to comply, it shall be mentioned that before starting any mining 

activity it shall be obtained the corresponding EIA (251 Article of the MC), for which it 

shall be complied the requisites that as well as the Nation, through its Mining Code, as 

the provinces demands. The latter because the Nation sets the minimum 

environmental budgets and are the provinces that at regulating them may aggravate 

them by demanding higher requirements. In case of a project that develops in two 

provinces, it shall have the corresponding permits in each one of them.
