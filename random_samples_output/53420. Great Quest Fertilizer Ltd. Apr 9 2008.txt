1.0  Summary 
 

Great Quest Metals Ltd. has interests in several gold concessions in the Republic 
of Mali. This report describes the results of diamond drilling conducted on two of these 
concessions, referred to as the Kenieba Gold Concession – Arrette 04-2182 and 01-2049 
- during 2007. The 2007 drilling results are used to update a resource estimate for the 
Djambaye 2 gold deposit that, presently, is the focus of exploration on the property. The 
Kenieba Gold Property is 3,138 hectares in area.  

The concessions are located in western Mali, in the Kayes Region, Kenieba 
Cercle and are approximately 360 kilometres west of, Bamako, the capital of Mali. 
 
 

 
 

Figure 1. Location Map. 
 

Great Quest Metals Ltd. is the beneficial titleholder of the concessions, which 
were issued by the government of Mali. 

The concessions are underlain by folded Paleoproterozoic age sediments and 
volcanics of the Birimian Group. Several areas on the property are intruded by granitic 
dykes and plutons. Immediately east of the concessions Upper Proterozoic and Paleozoic 
sediments unconformably overlie the Birimian and intrusive rocks. Jurassic age dolerite 
dykes and sheets intrude the Birimian and Palaeozoic sediments. The younger 
sedimentary successions stand out in topographic relief forming highland plateaus 
demarcated by the Tamboura escarpment. Exploration conducted by Great Quest on the 
concessions since 2002 has resulted in the discovery of nine gold mineralized areas. 
Currently, the most important of the gold zones is the Djambaye 2 structure. Gold

mineralization is associated with quartz veins, which have a close association with 
altered albitite or keratophyre dykes.  

In 2006 Great Quest drilled a total of 3,078 metres in 28 NQ-sized cored holes. 
In 2007, a total of 5,712 metres in 41 NQ-sized core holes were drilled and of these 25 
tested the Djambaye 2 structure. Results of this work have tested a 1.85 kilometre 
section of the 4 kilometre Djambaye 2 structure. The Djambaye 2 deposit consists of two 
tabular, gold-bearing zones that are associated with variably altered albitite dykes.  
Zones of quartz vein stockworks and quartz matrix breccias occur in both the altered 
dykes and surrounding metasedimentary host rocks.  

Assays of drill intercepts from the 2007 program have been used to update an 
estimate of a preliminary, inferred resource for the project. The inferred resource 
estimate indicates that the area drilled has potential to host gold in two mineralized 
zones: the Djambaye 2-A Zone and the Djambaye 2–B Zone. Uncertainties in the 
estimation of tonnage of in the order of 15% have led to a range of estimated values for 
tonnage and gold contents, as tabulated below. A median or middle estimate for the 
combined Djambaye 2 – A and B Zones is 2,574,000 tonnes averaging 3.92 grams/tonne 
gold for a undiluted gold content of 10,080,000 grams or 324,000 ounces.

Further work is recommended to continue the evaluation of the potential of the 

concessions. A program designed to continue the exploration of the Djambaye 2 
structure as well as testing some of the other adjacent gold mineralized structures, such 
as Djambaye 1, is recommended. The estimated cost of the first phase of this work is 
$CDN 2,000,000. A second phase program, contingent upon the success of the first, is 
recommended and is estimated to cost $CDN 4,000,000.

4.0  Property Description and Location 
 

Great Quest Metals Ltd. has rights to acquire interests in two concessions in the 
Kayes Region of the western part of the Republic of Mali and collectively referred to as 
the Kenieba Gold Property. The concessions are centered at: 12

o
52'17" N, 11

o
15'00" W or 

at UTM (WGS 84, zone 29) 1,423,971 N and 255,814 E. The Kenieba concessions are 
approximately 3,138 hectares in area. Corner coordinates for the locations of the 
concessions are tabulated below (Table 2) and illustrated on Figure 2. 

Great Quest Metals Ltd. holds 100% beneficial title to the concessions pending 
fulfillment of certain obligations that it undertakes to complete. A 5% net profits interest 
royalty is payable to a Malian national on production from Arrette 04-2182. 

 
There has been no legal survey of the property boundaries. 
 
There are no environmental liabilities affecting the concessions in their present 

state of development. Great Quest has received all the required permits that the 
Government of Mali requires companies to obtain in order to undertake exploration 
work programs. As the exploration work programs expand in size additional permits 
may be required. Great Quest Metals Ltd. anticipates that it will be able to obtain 
required permits.

Great Quest Metals Ltd. recently acquired the Comifa concession, which adjoins 

Arrette 04-2182 to the west. Comifa is approximately 800 hectares in area. Great Quest 
also has interests in other concessions north of the Kenieba Gold Concession, namely the 
Baroya and Kenieti concessions located to the north of property. Baroya is a gold 
concession, approximately 610 hectares in area. However, Kenieti is a diamond

5.0  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure 
and Physiography 
 

The Kenieba Gold Concession is situated in generally low lying (100 - 150 
metres ASL) savannah or veldt of the Faleme River basin. The concessions are covered 
in open stands of deciduous and evergreen broad leaf trees; the under storey of which 
consists of a variety of grasses. 
 

There is road access to and though much of the concession from the town of 
Kenieba, which is situated on the south boundary of the Kenieba Gold Concession. 
Numerous small villages are located throughout the concession and provide a ready 
source of labour for conducting some aspects of sampling and exploration work. 
 

The area is considered to be part of the Sudanese climatic zone and as such 
experiences a long dry season from November through June when temperatures range 
from 25oC at night to 47oC during the day. The dry season is followed by a wet season – 
July to September – during which period travel becomes difficult because of flooding. 
 

The rights provided by the government of the Republic of Mali provide the 
concession holder with rights to gold and other commodities as the terms of the 
concession permit. In addition, rights to surface access are provided for in the concession 
agreements. Power is limited in the concession area but, conceivably electricity could be 
brought into the area from the hydroelectric plant at Manantali, 75 kilometres to the east. 
There is a concerted effort by other miners in the area (Nevsun and RandGold) to get the 
Mali government to upgrade infrastructure in the Kenieba area. While the concession 
areas are in a semi-arid environment ground water is readily available. There is a readily 
available work force that is capable of supplying many of the labour related jobs in 
mining; in addition there are some skilled technical people available as well. 
 

Because of the relatively subdued topography over much of the concession there 
are numerous areas that could be made available for tailings disposal and plant sites 
when exploration indicates the need for such facilities.

6.0  History 
 

The western part of Mali and in particular the Kenieba region has a history of 
gold mining going back to the third century. Artisanal gold miners have been active from 
that time to present. Accurate records of the artisanal production do not exist, however 
there are histories that indicate gold production has been substantial in the past. 

French explorers mentioned gold production in the Kenieba valley in 1747. 
Initial efforts at gold exploitation by the French focussed on alluvial occurrences of the 
Faleme and Doundi Rivers. The Companie Des Mines de la Faleme-Gambie is reputed 
to have dredged 2.5 tonnes of gold from the Faleme River during the period 1912 to 
1950. Between 1924 and 1925, La Societe des Mines d'Or du Bambouk is reputed to 
have produced 3.1 kilograms of gold from the Doundi River, in an area just south of the 
Kenieba Gold Property. In the 1950's the Service de Geologie et de Prospection Miniere 
conducted extensive prospecting programs in Western Mali that led to the discovery of 
the Medinandi deposit in 1953. The Medinandi gold deposit is located 33 kilometres to 
the south of the Kenieba Gold Property.  

In the early 1960's the state mining agency: SONAREM, undertook alluvial gold 
exploration in western Mali. In the late 1970's and through the 1980's the Malian Gold 
Syndicate (BRGM and the Malian Government) conducted regional geochemical 
surveys which led to the discoveries of a number of gold anomalies, including the 
Tabakoto, Segala and Loulo gold deposits. Also during the late 1980's Klockner 
Industrie-Alagen GmbH ran regional geochemical sampling programs that resulted in 
the discovery of the Sadiola gold deposit to the north of Kenieba, near Kayes. Great 
Quest became involved in gold exploration in the Kenieba area in 2002 with its 
acquisition of the concessions there. Initial work conducted by Great Quest consisted of 
geological mapping, soil sampling and trenching.

7.0  Geological Setting 
 

7.1  Regional Geological Setting 
 

 
Figure 3. Regional Geological Setting – Keniba Gold Property. 

 
Great Quest Metals Ltd's gold concession is situated in the central-western part of the 

West African Craton (Figure 4) – an amalgam of Archean to late Proterozoic metamorphic 
and intrusive rocks. Archean age greenstone belts in granitic gneissic terrains constitute the 
Man shield – a proto-continent that accreted to Africa 2.1 billion years ago in a collisional 
event that resulted in the collapse of Paleoproterozoic Birimian volcanic arc and sedimentary 
basinal successions that now mantle the Man shield from the north to the east (Milési, J-P, 
1992). The Birimian is intruded by syn- to late-tectonic intrusive bodies ranging from granite 
to diorite in composition. Late Proterozoic (?) and Phanerozic clastic sediments of the 
Taoudeni basin form a cover for Birimian formations in Mali. However, inliers exposing the 
Birimian occur in several areas of western Mali. The concessions of Great Quest Metals Ltd. 
lie within the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier.  Jurassic age dolerite sills and dykes intrude the 
Birimian and Taoudeni basin sediments.

7.2  Local and Property Geology 
 

Relatively deep topical weathering has produced extensive areas of iron and 
manganese-rich duricrust laterite over much of the Great Quest's gold concessions. Laterite 
is typically 1 to 2 metres thick on average. Weathered or saprolitic bedrock underlies the 
laterite and on average, can vary up to 10 or 20 metres in thickness, but can be much deeper 
in some areas such as at Kabaya 1. Weathering has obscured bedrock geology, most of which 
has been determined either from rare exposures in creeks, bedrock in pits dug by artisanal 
miners or from drill core. 

The gold concessions of Great Quest Metals are underlain exclusively by Birimian 
group metasediments consisting of pelitic and intercalated psammitic rocks. In drill core the 
metasediments are comprised of interbedded siltstone and sandstone. Siltstone layers are 
typically thin-bedded and laminated and vary from medium to dark grey in colour. The sand 
beds vary from thin-bedded, fine-grained, grey to buff colour layers between the siltstone to 
thick-bedded, medium grained greywacke beds. Quartz-tourmaline bands or "tourmalinite" 
occur in several areas on the Kenieba Gold Concession. Tourmalinite may reflect an exhalite 
component in the sedimentary succession. In some areas, such as at the Loulo gold deposit, 
tourmalinites are directly associated with gold mineralization. Intrusive into the Birimian are 
a variety of dykes (albitites or keratophyres and lamprophyres) and larger S-type (?) granitic 
bodies (Figure 6). The Birimian formations are in general tightly folded. Immediately to the 
east of the Kenieba Gold Concession, Upper Cambrian sediments – mainly quartzites, overlie 
the Birimian. These resistant units form the cliffs of the Tamboura escarpment. Intrusive into 
the Birimian and younger formations are Jurassic age dolerite dykes and sills. Extensive 
dolerite sills within the Upper Cambrian sedimentary succession are exposed in areas along 
the Tamboura escarpment. On the Kenieba Gold Concession a small dolerite plug crops out 
at the village of Kouroufing. Dolerite sills and dykes appear to emanate from this plug, cross-
cutting some of the gold mineralized zones A number of kimberlite pipes intrude Birimian 
and younger sediments in and around the Kenieba Gold Concession.  

A prominent north-northeasterly structural grain is developed by lineaments that are 
frequently filled with dolerite dykes. Northeasterly and easterly trending lineaments are also 
outlined on geological maps of the area (DNGM map sheet ND-29-1). 

A number of gold mineralized structures have been located on the Kenieba Gold 
Concession. These zones document a brittle style of deformation that prevailed during gold 
mineralizing events. The mineralized zones are primarily quartz veins associated with felsic 
dykes with abundant cross-cutting quartz veins, quartz-flooded breccia zones and local quartz 
vein stockworks. The dykes were initially given field names of rhyodacite and diorite. 
However, petrogaphic work undertaken by Jeff Harris, PhD in 2007 indicates that the diorites 
are in fact albitite or keratophyre dykes and the rhyodacite is an altered variety of those 
dykes. This change in nomenclature has resulted in changes to what was previously described 
as the Diorite Zone to the Djambaye 2 – B zone and the Rhyodacite Zone to the Djambaye 2 
– A Zone. In addition to the albitite dykes numerous other dykes intrude the metasedimentary 
sequence. Some of these dykes have distinct trachytoid textures others may be lamprophyres. 
These and the mineralized albitite dykes pre-date the dolerite dykes. Facing directions for the 
metasediments determined from drill cores suggest that the Djambaye 2 structure is situated 
in the core of a tightly folded anticline.

8.0  Deposit Types 
 
 To date gold mineralization found on the Kenieba Gold Concession is primarily 
hosted in quartz veins intimately associated with albitite dykes, with structural control 
being the dominant feature. Alteration associated with the structures consists of local 
silicification of the metasediments. A carbonate-chlorite + sericite assemblage is also 
locally found associated with the veins and in narrow, bleached alteration envelopes 
around the veins. This style of mineralization is similar to that found at the adjacent 
Tabakoto gold mine of Nevsun Resources Inc. 

Gold mineralization that is emplaced in veins filling shatter zones or secondary 
splays off major shears in rock units that have undergone brittle failure, as opposed to 
ductile deformation (Colvine et al., 1988), is one style of mineralization that occurs on 
the Kenieba Gold Property. Examples of such deposits with this mineralization style 
may include the Siguiri gold mine of AngloGold Ashanti in Guinea or the Tabakoto 
deposit of Nevsun near Kenieba, Mali. The key to exploring for these types of deposits is 
defining structural trends and testing these with thorough sampling programs. 

Another gold deposit type, that may be applicable to mineralization on the 
concessions, is that found in the Birimian terrain in association with chemical sediments 
(Leube et al., 1990) such as tourmaline-bearing sandstone at the Loulo deposit in Mali 
(Dommanget et al., 1993) or siliceous exhalative horizons.  

Intrusion-related gold deposits, where gold deposition is spatially related to 
granitic intrusions, is a possible model for mineralization on the concessions, particularly 
in light of the close association of the gold mineralization with albitite dykes. An 
example of these are the deposits of Moto Goldmines Limited in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, where gold is also associated with structurally controlled quartz-
albite-carbonate-pyrite alteration zones in regionally metamorphosed sediments adjacent 
to intrusives (Jones, 2005). 

The form of the gold mineralized zones can be variable, ranging from narrow, 
high-grade (15+ grams/tonne gold) shoots or lodes of several thousand to hundreds of 
thousands of tonnes in size, to large, low-grade (1-3 grams/tonne gold) zones of 
hundreds of thousands to millions of tonnes in size. Mining methods for extracting gold 
from such deposits will vary depending on the form, mineralization character and size 
and will range from underground to open pit operations. 

Gold in significant concentrations in laterite is also a potential target type. The 
Siguiri gold mine operated by AngloGold in Guinea is an example of a deposit that also 
contains this style of gold mineralization in laterite overlying the Birimian rocks. 
Exploration programs must be vigilant for the different environments as well as 
structural styles, which may contain gold and therefore should be thoroughly tested. 

Initial targeting of mineralized zones relies on gold soil geochemistry. In many 
respects, the work of artisanal miners is a proxy for gold geochemistry and has been 
used extensively to locate gold mineralized areas. Once located however, detailed grid 
soil sampling can be used to define mineralized trends in bedrock that then can be drill 
tested, utilizing either RAB, reverse circulation or core drills. 



 

 

12

9.0  Mineralization 
 

A number of structurally controlled gold-bearing zones have been defined on the 
Kenieba Gold Concession by soil geochemical surveys, evaluation of artisanal miners' 
workings and diamond drilling, as illustrated in Figure 5. To date the zone that has 
received the most attention has been Djambaye 2, however with continued exploration 
the other zones could prove to be equally as important. In addition, exploration may lead 
to the discovery of new gold zones on the concessions.  

Brief summaries of the mineralized zones are presented below. The dominant 
control for the mineralization is the northerly striking dykes as well as northeasterly 
cross-cutting quartz stringer zones that develop within the dykes. The dykes and quartz 
veins are all hosted in Birimian metasediments. Gold occurs as visible, native gold in 
some of the drilled intercepts in the Djambaye 2. In addition, artisanal miners have 
shown the writer quartz vein specimens that they have recovered from their workings 
that contain native gold. Sulphide minerals associated with gold and the quartz veining 
are not abundant, but locally may reach amounts in the order of 15%. Pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and lesser pyrrhotite are the main sulphide phases.

9.1 Djambaye 1 
 

Djambaye 1 is located in the eastern part of Arrette 04-2182. The geology of the 
Djambaye 1 gold zone is that of a gold mineralized north-south albitite dyke. In the wash 
to the north, some altered dykes have been found. Gold mineralization is associated with 
intervals of the albitite that are fractured and have numerous quartz stringers. Clay 
alteration (kaolinite?) occurs with the dyke and may be related to supergene processes. 
The dyke is hosted in Birimian metasediments. 

Great Quest drilled one hole in 2006, KN 37-06, which intersected 7.9 metres of 
8.02 g/t gold with 1.0 metre of 56.77 g/t. KN 02-04, drilled in 2004, intersected 29.80 
metres of 0.66 g/t gold approximately 200 metres south of KN 37-06. To date, the 
Djambaye 1 gold zone has been traced for 3,477 metres on the surface.  

 
9.2 Djambaye 2 
 
Djambaye 2 is located in Arrette 04-2182, north and west, by approximately 500 

metres, of Djambaye 1. The Djambaye 2 zone consists of two parallel, tabular structures 
(zones A & B) of gold in quartz veins in and adjacent to north-south striking, east 
dipping albitite dykes that intrude Birimian metasediments. The A zone has been traced 
on surface for a length of 4,000 metres of which the central 1,850 metres has been drill 
tested to 150 metres below surface in some areas. The true thickness of the Djambaye 2–
A Zone is estimated to range from 0.70 to 7.42 metres and average 2.98 metres. The B 
Zone is an intermittent zone that is parallel to and west of the A Zone by 20 to 30 
metres.  The B Zone averages 2.24 metres in thickness. The dykes comprising both 
zones have been fractured and quartz veins with gold have been emplaced into the 
fractures. Sulphide content of the veins and dykes is low and consists of pyrite and 
arsenopyrite. Native gold in quartz is not uncommon in drill intercepts and occasionally 
is spectacular. The structural setting for the mineralized dykes of Djambaye 2, as 
inferred from facing directions determined from fining upwards sequences in drill core 
of the metasedimentary wall rocks, is that the dykes were intruded into the cores of 
anticlines as depicted in Figure 6 below.

9.3 Djambaye 3 
 
Djambaye 3 is a zone of mineralized albitite that has been traced on surface 

through the activity of artisanal miners for a length of 600 metres in a north-south 
direction . The zone is parallel and to the east of Djambaye 1. 

 
 
9.4 Kabaya 1 
 
The Kabaya 1 area consists of several geochemically anomalous zones. The 

northeasterly striking Konate zone is an occurrence of quartz vein, quartz breccia and 
quartz stringers that have been traced on surface a distance of 600 metres. A single drill 
hole in the zone intersected anomalous gold in the vein zone. A similar, but northerly 
striking vein zone is situated north of Konate and is separated from Konate by a possible 
fault zone along which soils have returned anomalous gold values ranging from 34 to 
8,150 ppb Au. In addition, chip samples from a narrow northeasterly striking quartz vein 
in the northern part of the area ranged from 11 to 55,670 ppb gold. 

 
In the southeastern part of the Kabaya 1 area, a second northerly striking albitite 

dyke – the Kabaya Est - was located based on work of the artisanal miners. Seven 
samples taken from pits along the dyke returned gold values averaging 3,562 parts per 



 

 

15

billion (ppb) gold per sample over the 350 metre interval sampled. This zone has now 
been traced for 565 metres and appears open to the north.  

 
9.5 Kabaya 2 
 
The main feature of the Kabaya 2 area is a three- to four-metre-wide, north-south 

albitite dyke that pits and soil samples indicate could be at least 476 metres long. The 
fourteen soil samples taken from the area averaged 2,829 ppb gold (2.84 g/t gold) per 
sample.  

 
9.6 Kourufin 
 
The Kourufin vein system consists of a series of quartz veins in Birimian rock 

striking to the northwest. The center of the system is a two-metre-wide quartz vein that 
has been traced on the surface for 75 metres. Four samples taken across the vein over a 
length of 60 metres assayed 1.96, 5.28, 20.67 and 22.52 g/t gold. 

 
9.7 Sansanto 
 
The Sansanto gold zone was discovered in February 2006 below six metres of 

alluvium. The gold mineralization in this zone is centered in a north-south albitite dyke 
950 metres east of the northern part of the Djambaye 2 zone. The vein has been traced 
for 400 metres and drilling in July 2006 intersected 3.10 metres of 0.85 g/t gold with 1.0 
metre of 1.66 g/t gold in hole KN 38-06. 

 
9.8  Other Zones 
 
Exploration during 2007 located a new potentially mineralized gold zone referred 

to as Roche Rouge. The zone consisted of an area of reddish sandstones that contain 
quartz stringers. Initial drill testing with 3 NQ holes was completed in 2007. 

The Bokoba zone is situated immediately south of Konate and consists of a 
quartz vein that has been traced on surface for several hundred metres.

10.0  Exploration 
 
 Great Quest Metals Ltd. initiated exploration on the Kenieba Gold Concession in 
2003 with preliminary site visits, mapping and sampling of artisanal workings. Two diamond 
drill holes were drilled in that year under the supervision of Mr. Claude Aussant, an 
independent contractor (Aussant, 2003), in the Djambaye 1 zone.  

In 2005 and 2006 grids were established over some areas and detailed soil sampling 
undertaken. In addition, diamond drilling in 2005 was completed in 12 NQ-sized holes for a 
total of 1,226.70 metres on the Djambaye 2 zone under the supervision of Mr. Marvin A. 
Mitchell, P.Eng, an independent contractor (Mitchell, 2006), during the period March 
through June 2005. The Programme pour Le Developpement Des Ressources Minerales 
(PDRM) a department of the Direction Nationale De La Geologie et des Mines (DNGM) of 
the Government of Mali was contracted to conduct the diamond drilling. The results of this 
work indicated that over the 400 metres strike length of the Djambaye 2 zone that was tested, 
gold values ranged from less than 1.0 gram/tonne to over 800 grams/tonne. A summary of 
the 2005 drill holes is listed below in Table 3. Significant assays for the 2005 drilling are 
tabulated in Table 4.

In 2006, diamond drilling was conducted on the Kenieba Gold Concession 
during the period of March through July under the supervision of the writer. The 
Programme pour Le Developpement Des Ressources Minerales (PDRM), a department 
of the Direction Nationale De La Geologie et des Mines (DNGM) of the Government of 
Mali, was again contracted to conduct the diamond drilling. A further 22 diamond drill 
holes tested the Djambaye 2 zone and in addition, 6 holes tested other zones (Djambaye 
1, Bokoba and Konate) on the Kenieba Gold Property. The drilling results on the 
Djambaye 2 structure were used to make a preliminary resource estimate of the zone 
(Verley, 2007). The inferred resource was estimated at 928,787 tonnes averaging 4.48 
grams/tonne gold for 4,164,200 grams or 133,882 ounces.  

On a day-to-day basis Mr. Niatié Bengaly, B.Sc. project geologist for Great 
Quest managed the drilling and core logging. A table summarizing the drill hole 
information is found below (Table 5). Significant assays for the 2006 drilling are 
tabulated in Table 6.

11.0  Drilling 2007 
 
 Diamond drilling was again conducted on the Kenieba Gold Concession during 
the period of March through August 2007 under the supervision of the writer. The 
Programme pour Le Developpement Des Ressources Minerales (PDRM), a department 
of the Direction Nationale De La Geologie et des Mines (DNGM) of the Government of 
Mali, was contracted to conduct the diamond drilling.  
 A truck mounted Longyear 38 drill, rigged with NQ wireline equipment, was 
utilized to do the work. All of the holes were drilled at an inclination of –50o. Three 
crews, working 8-hour shifts each, conducted drilling on a 24-hour basis. A Great Quest 
Metals contracted person was on site at all times during the drilling in order to monitor 
the drilling progress and core recovery. Core was placed in metal core trays for easy 
handling and permanent storage. At the end of each shift the drill crew took drill core 
back to Great Quest Metals core logging facility in Kenieba. There the drill core was laid 
out and washed, and recovery and rock quality designation (RQD)were measured. Then 
the core was logged by Mr. Niatié Bengaly, project geologist for Great Quest. A table 
summarizing the drill hole information is found below (Table 7). 
 Drill hole inclination and azimuth was checked by the drill contractor using a 
Pajari down hole survey tool. Measurements were taken at the bottom of hole and at the 
mid-point. The Project geologist was responsible for checking each drill hole set-up 
prior to the commencement of drilling to ensure the collar azimuth and inclination were 
correctly set. Drill holes were marked after completion by appropriately number cement 
blocks. Drill hole locations were measured using a Global Positioning Instrument (GPS) 
set to record location in WGS 84, zone 29 north, map datum. A plan map illustrating the 
relative locations of the holes drilled on the Djambaye 2 structure is found in Figure 7. 
 The relationship between sampled drill intercept and true thickness of 
mineralization was estimated based on the known surface exposure of the Djambaye 2 
structure, the inclination of the drill holes with respect to that structure and the angle at 
which the drill holes crossed the structure. The drilled intercepts ranged from 90% of 
true thickness for holes drilled normal to the Djambaye 2 structure to 64% for holes drill 
at angle of 45o to the structure.

In addition to the diamond drilling conducted on the Djambaye 2 zone in 2007, 
testing of the Djambaye 1, Kabaya 1, Kabaya 2, Konate, Bokoba, Sansanto and Roche 
Rouge zones was undertaken. 

A total of 5 NQ holes (KN-73 to KN-77: 535.9 metres) were drilled in the 
Djambaye 1 zone. The best intercept was 6.7 metres that averaged 2.41 grams/tonne 
gold, from 38.6 to 45.3 metres in hole KN-76. 

Kabaya 1 was tested by 2 NQ drill holes (KN-80 & KN-81) totalling 240.3 
metres in 2007. No significant gold was intersected. 

Kabaya 2 was tested by 2 NQ drill holes (KN-78 & KN-79) totalling 225.3 
metres. In KN-78, from 40.1 to 41.8 metres (1.7 m), gold averaged 3.53 grams/tonne. In 
KN-79 gold averaged: 0.89 gm/t over the 1.5 metre interval from 120.2 to 121.7 metres. 



 

 

37

A total of 2 NQ drill holes (KN-68 & KN-69: 185.1 metres) were in the Sansanto 
zone. Drill hole KN-68 intersected 0.46 grams/tonne over 1.6 metres, from 23.3 to 24.9 
metres. 

The 3 NQ drill holes that tested the Roche Rouge zone (KN-70, KN-71 and KN-
72: 346.1 m total) intersected intermittent gold values of up to 0.18 grams/tonne over 
sampled lengths of 1.5 metres.  

Single NQ holes were drilled into the Bokoba (KN-82) and Konate (KN-83) 
zones, but failed to intersect significant gold mineralized intervals.

12.0  Sampling Method and Approach 
 

12.1 Drill Core: 
 

The approach to sampling drill core was to sample individual mineralized 
veins/dykes intersected by the drill as single samples where these intervals were less 
than 2 metres in length. For wider intercepts the mineralized interval was split into 2 or 
more samples not more than 1 metre in length. Altered (silicified or stockwork zones) 
enveloping the Djambaye 2 structures were sampled in intervals of general 1 metre in 
length or less.  

Drill core sample intervals were marked on the core and samples were split from 
the core using an electric diamond saw. Samples were systematically cut, with half of 
each cut portion being placed in uniquely numbered fiber weave sacks for shipping, to 
Abilab S.A.R.L. (now a subsidiary of ALS Global) in Bamako by either local trucking 
company to Kayes and from Kayes to Bamako by rail or, in some cases, samples were 
picked up on site by an ALS Global truck. After sampling, the remaining core was stored 
in a locked 40-foot steel-shipping container located in the town of Kenieba. 

 
 
13.0  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 
  There was no sample preparation conducted on site other than the splitting and 
bagging of core described above. Sample preparation was conducted at the Abilab 
facility in Bamako. A standard fire assay approach was used to estimate gold values in 
most of the drill core. The laboratory was notified of which samples contained visible 
gold, in order that screening for metallics could be undertaken and an assay estimated 
that took into account particulate gold. Abilab used its own internal standards, inserted 
one of every 20 samples, to provide quality control. In addition, check assays were 
preformed on every tenth sample. 
 Security on site was maintained by watchmen who patrolled the Kenieba base of 
operations on a 24 hour basis. Sample handling in 2007 was carefully scrutinized by the 
writer and found to be adequate for this stage of exploration. 
 
14.0  Data Verification 
 

The writer has reviewed all of the original laboratory data sheets, drill logs and 
has checked drill hole location and drill core on site. 
 
15.0  Adjacent Properties 
 

Nevsun Resources Inc. had a producing gold mine – the Tabakoto Mine (total 
published resource: 3,356,000 tonnes averaging 5.26 grams/tonne gold) – situated 6 
kilometres north of Great Quest's Kenieba Gold Concession. The Tabakoto mine was 
developed on a northerly trending structure that has some similar geological and 
mineralization characteristics when compared to the Djambaye 2 structure on Great 



 

 

39

Quest's property. In addition, Nevsun has a low-grade gold deposit – Segala (3,979,000 
tonnes averaging 2.98 grams/tonne gold) – that was slated for production. Production 
problems at the Tabakoto Mine resulted in its closure in late 2007. On March 25, 2008, 
Nevsun announced the sale of the Tabakoto mine and all its properties in Mali to Avion 
Resources Corp. for $US 20 million. 
 
16.0  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
 No mineral processing, in the sense of resource development or amenability 
studies, have been conducted on or of materials from Great Quest Metals Kenieba Gold 
Concession. 
 
17.0  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 
 An update of the preliminary resource estimate (Verley, 2007) has been made for 
the Djambaye 2 gold vein system in the Kenieba area of Mali. The estimate provides an 
inferred mineral resource (as per CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves, 2004) to a maximum depth of 150 metres for the gold mineralized 
quartz veined albitite dykes in Birimian metasediments that constitute the northerly 
striking, easterly dipping Djambaya 2 structure. The estimate has focused primarily on 
two parallel tabular structures (zones A & B). The Djambaye 2 is a north-south striking 
structure that has been traced on surface for a length of 4,000 metres. The resource 
estimate for the A Zone was made on a 1,850 metre portion of this. The B Zone is an 
intermittent zone that is parallel to and west of the A Zone by 20 to 30 metres.  

The estimation procedure utilized the data from 53 out of 60 diamond drill holes 
drilled in 2005, 2006 and 2007 on the Kenieba Gold Project. Assay data from a total of 
285 mineralized core samples were used in the estimate. The intercepts were plotted on a 
longitudinal section and 70 blocks around the mineralized intercepts were constructed. 
The estimated true thickness, which varied from 64 percent (in the case of holes drilled 
obliquely to the mineralized structures) and 90 percent (in the case of holes drill 
perpendicular to the mineralized structures) of the drill intercept, of each mineralized 
interval was used to define a thickness for each block. A volume was then estimated for 
each block based on the constructed area and estimated thickness. A specific gravity of 
2.67 tonnes per cubic metre, as previously determined for some of the mineralized core 
samples, was used. The specific gravity was applied to the volume estimate in order to 
determine a tonnage for each block. Assay data from Abilab S.A.R.L. in Mali was 
examined and averages of regular run assays, check assays and metallic assays were 
made. Assays greater than 100 gm/tonne, as in the case of two drill holes, were cut back 
to 30 grams. Several drill holes (KN-65, 66 and 67) that intersected the southern 
extension of the A Zone were not used in the estimate as the step out for these holes was 
considered to be too great a distance to allow for a reasonable estimate to be made of the 
grade and tonnage that they may contribute to the resource model. In-fill drilling around 
these holes will allow their inclusion in future resource estimates. Similarly, several 
holes (KN 33, 61 and 63) were left out of the B Zone estimate. In addition, a 10 metre 
surface layer was not included in the estimate in order to allow for possible depletion by 
artisanal miners.  



 

 

40

The averaged assays were then used to estimate weighted averages of the drill 
intercepts in mineralized zones. Drill intercepts used in the estimation are found in 
Tables 4, 6 and 8 found in the Section 10.0: Exploration and in Section 11.0: 2007 
Drilling, respectively. The weighted average for a particular block was applied to the 
tonnage estimate for that block in order to determine an estimated gold content of the 
block. The total for all of the blocks is summarized in Table 9. Estimated resources for 
the Djambaye 2 – A Zone are listed in Table 10 those for Djambaye 2 – B Zone in Table 
11.  
 

The estimate can only be viewed as preliminary in nature, providing an 
indication of the potential of the property. Some of the blocks are very large and will 
require further drilling in order to place greater confidence in the resource figures. As 
with many vein systems the grades fluctuate greatly, requiring detailed close spaced 
drilling in order to determine the grade variability as well as trends of mineralized 
shoots. Assumptions used in making this estimate are: grade continuity exists within 
blocks; estimated thickness for blocks is maintained across each block; specific gravity 
is 2.67 tonnes per cubic metre. Uncertainty, mainly stemming from the volume estimate, 
as well as to some degree gold grade, is believed to be in the order 15% for this estimate, 
consequently a range for the tonnage is presented. In addition it is assumed that the 
north-south strike and easterly dip of the mineralized structure is the main control for 
mineralization. East-west cross structures may play a role in mineralization and need 
further evaluation, especially to define higher-grade shoots. No consideration has been 
given in this estimate to potential dilution by wall rock or recovery of gold in a mining 
situation.

18.0  Other Relevant Data and Information 
  
 There is no other relevant data or information in the writer's opinion. 
 
 
19.0  Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
 Great Quest Metals Ltd. has interests in two gold concessions in western Mali 
referred to collectively as the Kenieba Gold Concession.  

 The Kenieba Gold Concession is located in the Kayes region of western Mali. 
The property is centered at latitude 12o52'17"N and longitude 11o15'00"W (UTM: 
255,814E; 1,423,971N). The property is 3,138 hectares in area. 

 Both concessions are underlain by Paleoproterozoic metasediments of the 
Birimian Group. The Birimian is unconformably overlain to the east by near flat lying 
Paleoproterozoic and younger quartzites, sandstones and shales of the Souroukoto 
Group, which crops out immediately to the east of the property. Paleoproterozoic 
granites and related rocks intrude the Birimian. Dykes of albitite intrude the Birimian 
and host gold mineralization. Lamprophyre dykes are not uncommon in the Birimian. In 
addition Jurassic dolerite dykes and sills intrude both Birimian and Souroukoto group 
rocks. Kimberlites of Cretaceous and possibly older age intrude the Birimian and 
Souroukoto.  

 Gold mineralization on Great Quest's Kenieba Gold Concession has been found 
in 10 structurally controlled zones to date. The largest of these – Djambaye 2 – has 
received 7,717.3 metres of diamond drilling in the last 3 years. This work has resulted in 
an estimation of a range for inferred resources for the Djambaye 2 structure. The median 
inferred resource estimate for the combined Djambaye 2 – A and B Zones is 2,574,000 
tonnes averaging 3.92 grams/tonne gold (uncut) over a 1,850 metre interval of the 4,000 
metre long zone. The data utilized in this estimate is reliable. The structure is open at 
depth and on strike. Further work should focus on increasing the density of drill 
intercepts in order to up grade and expand the resource estimate.  

On this basis and considering the favourable results from drilling, further work is 
warranted and strongly recommended for the Kenieba Gold Concession.

20.0  Recommendations 
 
 A two-stage program is recommended to continue the exploration of the Kenieba 
Gold Concession.  

 The first stage of work will consist of 8,000 metres NQ core drilling focussed 
primarily on testing the Djambaye 2 structure at depth as well as in-fill drill on strike, 
followed by step-out drilling to test the strike extensions. In conjunction with this work 
Rab drilling to test for extensions of the Djambaye structures and other promising targets 
on the Kenieba Gold Concession should be undertaken. Included in the first stage will be 
the establishment a self-contained exploration drill camp near the village of Sansanto. 
The camp should include adequate accommodation, power, sanitation and water as well 
as office and core storage facilities. 

In addition to this work Great Quest Metals Ltd. is advised to compile all assay, 
analytical and drill log data in a validated digital format in order that it can be easily 
imported into mine modelling software such as GEMCOM. Drill holes on the Djambaye 
2 structure must be surveyed. A rigorous quality control/quality assurance program for 
sampling and drill core handling must be implemented. 

The total estimated cost of this program is $CDN2,000,000.

Based upon the success of the first stage of work on the Kenieba Gold 
Concession a second stage of work is recommended. The Second stage program should 
consist of further detailed drill of the mineralized zones tested during the first stage in 
order to estimate gold resources for these zones and to upgrade existing resources to 
reserve categories. 

The estimated cost of second stage program will be in the order of $CDN 
4,000,000.
