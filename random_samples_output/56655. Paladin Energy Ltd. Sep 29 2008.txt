1  Summary 
 

Following an extensive drilling program in 2007 and 2008 Paladin Energy Ltd (Paladin) 
has undertaken a re-estimation of U3O8 resources at the Langer Heinrich prospect, Namibia.  
Those resources are to enable an updated Ore Reserve estimate to be produced and life of 
mine planning studies to be undertaken. 

 
Langer Heinrich is a calcrete-hosted secondary uranium deposit associated with valley-fill 

sediments in an extensive Tertiary palaeodrainage system.  It is located about 90 kilometres 
due east of Swakopmund, in the Namib Desert of central Namibia.  The large-scale, hard-
rock Rössing uranium mine is located about 40 kilometres north-west of Langer Heinrich.  
Uranium occurs as carnotite, an oxide mineral containing both uranium and vanadium, 
deposited as thin films lining cavities and fracture planes and as grain coatings and 
disseminations.  The deposit extends over a 15km length.  Mineralisation is near-surface, 
between one and thirty metres thick, and between 50 and 1,100 metres wide depending on 
the width of the palaeovalley. 

 
The deposit was discovered in 1973 after a government-sponsored airborne radiometric 

survey of the area.  Between 1974 and 1980 General Mining Union Corporation Limited 
(Gencor) undertook extensive percussion and diamond drilling, excavated a series of bulk 
sample test shafts, mined a large-scale costean and trial open pit, operated a trial dry 
screening plant and undertook detailed metallurgical, engineering and hydrological studies.  
The project was mothballed in the mid-1980's after a fall in the uranium price.  It was 
acquired by Acclaim Exploration NL in 1998.  That company completing infill RC drilling 
over a portion of the deposit and a pre-feasibility study in 1999-2000.  Again the project was 
put on hold due to prevailing uranium prices. 

 
Paladin Resources Ltd acquired the operating company, Langer Heinrich Uranium (Pty) 

Ltd and its assets in August 2002.  Paladin has reconstructed all available drill hole data into 
a digital database that has been extensively checked and validated.  The majority of sample 
data available to inform resource estimates derive from work undertaken by Gencor.  That 
work appears to have been undertaken to a high standard and comparisons of U3O8 grades 
in Gencor's drilling to grades in test shafts and XRF assays and radiometric logging of 
Acclaim and Paladin drill holes largely support the reliability of the historic data.  There 
were, however, relatively few data available to assess the reliability of U3O8 grades from 
Gencor percussion drill samples below the water table.   

 
Although water flow rates are reportedly low the quality of those samples were regarded 

as questionable, as a consequence Paladin undertook an extensive drilling program in the 
area of Detail 1 during the second half of 2004 to prove up the resources below the water 
table.  Paladin undertook drilling campaigns in 2005 to extend Details 1, 2 and 7 and in 2006 
to infill and extend Details 3, 4, 5 and 6.  During 2007 and 2008 an extensive drilling 
campaign was completed with 717 RC holes for 17,731m being drilled to infill Details 1 and 2 
and close off resources in Details 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Resources defined by drilling on a regular 
50m x 50m spacing or closer have been consigned to Measured category.  Areas in which 
50m drill coverage is incomplete have been consigned to Indicated category and 
mineralisation in areas drilled at 100m x 100m spacing have been allocated to Inferred 
category. 

  
Variograms of U3O8 grades indicate that the continuity of grades is relatively poor over 

even quite short distances, not unlike that observed in some gold deposits.  This is backed up 



 
 

 

14 

by comparisons of nearest neighbour samples in drill holes and test shafts.  However the 
overall continuity of mineralisation, the geological continuity, is quite strong in plan-view.  
Variograms based on areas of close-spaced sampling in Detail 1 have been used to guide 
modelling of the short-scale continuity of U3O8 grades in other areas. 

 
Resources have been estimated at a number of cut-off grades using Multiple Indicator 

Kriging with block support correction.  Primary model panel dimensions are 50mE x 50mN x 
3mRL.  Estimates assume that grade control sampling at about 3.2mE x 3.6mN x 1mRL will 
be available prior to mining and a selective mining unit of approximately 4mE x 4mN x 
3mRL.  Estimates for the entire deposit are summarised in the table below.

Total Langer Heinrich estimated resources 
 
In all tables where resource estimates are detailed, metal content in terms of t U3O8 are 

based on contained metal in the ground and take no account of mining or metallurgical 
recoveries, mining dilution or other economic parameters. 

 
The assumed degree of selectivity that can be achieved during mining is regarded as 

somewhat conservative.  Comparison to mining grade control and processing indicates that 
the resource model has a tendency to be conservative in relation to tonnes mined but is 
consistent with the resource grade above a 250ppm U3O8 cut off. The 250ppm U3O8 grade is 
the demarcation value used by Langer Heinrich mine to separate ore and waste. 

 

The Ore Reserve estimate, exclusive of ROM stockpiles, is summarized below, only Measured 

Resources have been used to report Proven Reserves and only Indicated Resources have been 

used to report Probable Reserves.  No Inferred Resources have been used in estimating the 

Mineral Reserve.

Key assumptions are summarised below, other assumptions are documented in Section 23 

Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development Properties and Production 

Properties. 

 

• Pit designs were prepared using industry standard mining software using the 

resource models, geotechnical slope recommendations and other cost parameters, established 

during the operations to date. 

 

• The revenue rate used in the estimate was US$60 per lb which is moderate when 

compared to the Ux spot price and existing term contracts. 

  

• The Ore Reserve estimate is based on a simplified project analysis on a pre-tax basis. 

 

Changes in the metal prices, metallurgical assumptions and operating costs will affect the size 

of the Ore Reserve. Higher operating costs and lower metallurgical recoveries would increase the 

cut off grade and so reduce the quantity of ore in the Ore Reserve. 

 

These reserves will form the basis of the detailed mine planning for the Project. The revised 

mine model will allow a remaining mine life of 11 years, including the expansion of processing 

capability to 6.0 million pounds per year, but does not include any contribution from the 

considerable amount of Inferred Resources within the open pit area or outside the current 

footprint. 

 

It is recommended that Langer Heinrich minesite continue the process of resource definition 

and infill drilling on a yearly basis to enable ongoing conversion of previously identified Inferred 

Mineral Resources to Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources so that they can be included in 

future Mineral Reserve estimates. It is assumed that future, updated, Mineral Reserves will 

support continued mining and milling operations at Langer Heinrich.

4  Property Description and Location 
 

4.1 Location 
 
The Langer Heinrich Uranium Project is located in the Republic of Namibia ("Namibia") 

in southern Africa.  The project site is within the Erongo Region, 180km west of the national 
capital, Windhoek and 80 km east of the major deepwater seaport at Walvis Bay, a well 
established city and the main sea port of Namibia, and the coastal town of Swakopmund . 

 
 

 
Figure 1:  Location Map 

 
Namibia, formerly a protectorate of the Republic of South Africa, became independent on 

the 21st March 1990.  The political system is a stable, multi-party parliamentary democracy.  
English is the official language and the legislative and fiscal regimes are very similar to those 
of South Africa.  The Namibian dollar is linked at parity with the South African Rand 
("SAR"). 

 
Namibia is part of the Southern Africa Development Corridor ("SADC") zone and has a 

population of 1.8M people.  The Namibian economy relies heavily on the country's mining 
industry with mining being its principal export industry and the Namibian Government 
offers considerable incentives to companies setting up new mining operations.  Specifically, 



 
 

 

21

title to exploration and mining tenements is clear-cut and certain, and accelerated 
depreciation and reduced corporate taxation rates are available. 

 
 

4.2 Description of Licence 
 
The Langer Heinrich Uranium Project is covered by a single Mining Licence, ML140.

Table 2: Coordinates of ML 140 
 

The Licence has been surveyed. 
 
In 1992 the new Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act (No 33 of 1992) of Namibia (see 

section 4.2.1) was promulgated and, in accordance with the new act, Gencor applied for a 
mineral deposit retention licence (MDRL).  MDRL 2236 was granted on the 16 August 1994 
for 5 years and has been renewed for further 3 periods (of two years).  MDRL 2236 was 
converted to a full mining license ML 140 in July 2005 prior to the commencement of mining 
in September 2006 

 
The current ML allows for the mining of the deposit to be carried out.  To maintain the 

licence in good standing, the company is required to: 
 

• Maintain the project database, 
 

• Submit annual financial statements to the Government of Namibia, and 
 

• Commence mining operations within a set period of time following the grant of the 
License.

The licence covers 3,975 ha of State land in the Namib Naukluft Park.  Since establishment 

of the park, numerous prospecting and mining activities have been conducted within it.  
Environmentally irresponsible behaviour by some operating companies, resulting in long-
lasting damage, has led to the establishment of the Policy for prospecting and mining in 
protected areas and national monuments in 1999 (the term 'protected areas' includes national 
parks and game reserves).  This policy document outlines the procedures to be followed 
before government takes a decision if a prospecting or mining activity may commence.  In 
addition, any proposed mining project shall also have to adhere to the following 13 
principles of environmental management (SAIEA, 2003): 

 
• Renewable resources shall be utilised on a sustainable basis for the benefit of current 

and future generations of Namibians, 

• Community involvement in natural resource management and sharing in the benefits 
arising there from shall be promoted and facilitated, 

• Public participation in decision making affecting the environment shall be promoted, 

• Fair and equitable access to natural resources shall be promoted, 

• Equitable access to sufficient water of acceptable quality and adequate sanitation shall 
be promoted and the water needs of ecological systems shall be fulfilled to ensure the 
sustainability of such systems, 

• The precautionary principle and the principle of preventative action shall be applied, 

• There shall be prior environmental assessment of projects and proposals which may 
significantly affect the environment or use of natural resources, 

• Sustainable development shall be promoted in land use planning, 

• Namibia's movable and immovable cultural and natural heritage including its 
biodiversity shall be protected and respected for the benefit of current and future 
generations, 

• Generators of waste and polluting substances shall adopt the best practicable 
environmental option to reduce such generation at source, 

• The polluter pays principle shall be applied, 

• Reduction, re-use and recycling shall be promoted, and 

• There shall be no importation of waste into Namibia. 

 
In addition supplementary conditions, that include the implementation of an 

environmental rehabilitation programme to the satisfaction of the Directorate of Resource 
Management – Ministry of Environment and Tourism, have been imposed on MDRL2236. 

 
A Mining Licence must be applied for and granted prior to project development. 
 

4.2.1 Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act (No 33 of 1992) 
 
Administrative body: Department of Mines, Ministry of Mines and Energy. 
 
Main objectives:  This act regulates reconnaissance, prospecting and mining of minerals.  

Various licence types, and their implications, are stipulated.  The act details reporting 
requirements for monitoring of activities and compliance to environmental performance, 
such as disposal methods.  The Mining Commissioner, appointed by the Minister, is 
responsible for implementing these regulations.  A Mineral Board has also been established, 
the functions of which are to advise the Minister and cooperate with other ministries. 

 



 
 

 

24

Several explicit references to the environment and its protection are contained in the act, 
which provides for environmental impact assessments, rehabilitation of prospecting and 
mining areas and minimising or preventing pollution. 

 
Section 91(f) requires that an application for a mining licence contains particulars of: 
 
• The condition of the existing environment; 

• An estimate of the impacts and the proposed mitigation measures; and 
• Details regarding pollution control, waste management, rehabilitation and 

minimisation of impacts on adjoining land. 
 
 

4.3 Ownership 
 
The Langer Heinrich Uranium Project is owned 100% by Langer Heinrich Uranium (Pty) 

Limited ("LHUPL"), a company registered in Namibia.  Through subsidiary holding 
companies, LHUPL is now beneficially owned 100% by Paladin 

 
LHUPL was formed by a subsidiary of the South African mining house, Gencor and 

others in 1973 to prospect for uranium in Namibia.  The participants had been granted 
prospecting concessions covering 970km2 in the Namib Desert.  The Langer Heinrich 
Deposit was discovered by Gencor within the concession area in late 1973.  Over the 
following seven years Gencor undertook extensive exploration and test work to evaluate the 
potential of the Deposit 

 
In 1998 ownership of LHUPL through its parent holding company, Lahndrik Holdings 

SA, a company registered in Luxembourg, was transferred from Gencor to Acclaim.  In July 
2002, Acclaim agreed to sell its 100% holding in Lahndrik Holdings SA to Paladin Energy 
Minerals NL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Paladin, and full ownership of LHUPL and the 
Langer Heinrich Uranium Project was thus acquired by Paladin

4.4 Fees / Taxes and Assessment of Work Requirements and Liabilities 
 

Work commitments relating to the granting of the Mining License, that mining activities 
should be commence within 1 month of grant and are substantially in alignment with the 
budget submitted in the ML application, have been carried out. Expenditure commitments 
attached to ML 140 are N$5,000 per annum, although these can be modified if the 
Government wishes to do so.   

 
Ml 140 is subject to a royalty of A$0.12 per kilogram U3O8 sold payable to Redport Ltd., a 

wholly owned subsidiary of Mega Uranium Ltd as well as a royalty payable to the Namibian 
government of 2% of the market value of nuclear fuel minerals.  

 
All permits required for the sustained operation of the mine have been granted.  There are 

no outstanding environmental liabilities other than those normally associated with the de-
commissioning of the mine site following the cessation of mining and processing activities.  
Clean up of the historical mining areas within the mining license will take place during the 
course of normal mining operations.

5  Accessibili ty,  Climate ,  Local  Resources,  
Infrastructure and Physiography 

 

5.1 Access 
 

 
The only land access to the licence area is via district road C28 from Swakopmund (Figure 

4), but following an existing turn-off approximately 20 km from the plant site.  Repairs and 
grading have been carried out to up-grade the quality of this dirt road from the turn-off to 
the site. 

 
There are two disused airstrips close to the project site that are capable of handling up to 

8-seater light aircraft.  One strip is in the middle of the valley near an old exploration camp 
and the other on the desert floor just west of the Gawib Valley.  The former has been re-
established as a usable strip (for small twin engine planes only) following the completion of 
some remedial work.  This air strip is now available for use in emergencies or as other needs 
arise. 

 
 

 
Figure 4: Site Location 

 

5.2 Climate 
 
The Langer Heinrich site is situated in the arid Namib Desert of Namibia, with the climate 

typical of a desert.  In general, the climate is typified by hot and dry conditions with rather 
cool nights.  The wind speed in winter is stronger than in summer, mostly due to the 
dominant high-pressure system of the inland regions that result in subsiding air drainage to 
the coastal regions.  Climatic assessment has been made based on data obtained over two 
year period, March of 2000 to June 2002.  This represents a short historical data set and 



 
 

 

27

therefore does not contain extremes such as wind gusts and maximum and minimum 
temperatures. 

 
A typical desert rainfall pattern is evident in the data as only two significant rainfall 

events were recorded during the measurement period.  The maximum rainfall recorded in 
one month was 76 mm (Figure 5) with 26 mm during a 24-hour period and 15.7 mm in one 
hour. 

 

 
Figure 5: Rainfall data at Langer Heinrich  

 
Due to the typical desert climatology, as measured at the site, the temperature variation 

can approach and even exceed 30°C on any given day.  The lowest hourly temperature 
measured during the sampling period was 4.3°C and the maximum hourly temperature was 
40.9°C.  Mean daily temperatures exceed 20°C for most months, with July and September the 
exceptions (Figure 6).  Due to the relative close proximity to the coast, frost will be a rare 
experience at this site. 

 
 

Figure 6: Monthly temperature range at Langer Heinrich 
 
The directional wind pattern at Langer Heinrich shows distinct summer and winter 

patterns, however, the topographical influence of the nearby mountain ranges and even the 
greater topographical influence of the high inland Plateau with the site at the border of the 
coastal plains are evident.  In summer (Figure 7), the constant southerly experienced on the 
coast swings to a westerly at the site due to the physical Langer Heinrich mountain in close 
proximity to the north of the site.

In winter the strong easterly winds is a function of the high-pressure system dominating 
the Southern African Highveld that causes air to subside and then to drain towards the coast 
(see Figure 7). 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

Figure 7: Frequency of wind direction at Langer Heinrich 
(in terms of wind speed during A - summer periods, B - winter) 

 
During autumn and spring the transitional state of the seasons is evident as both seasons 

have elements of the summer and winter wind frequency distribution. 
 
Because of prevailing climatic conditions the Langer Heinrich Project is able to operate 

365 days per year. 
 
 

5.3 Local Resources 
 
The population of the Erongo region is 107,629, which is approximately 6.7% of the total 

population of Namibia (CBS, 2002).  Most of the population is to be found in urban areas 
with 63% living in the towns of Walvis Bay, Swakopmund, Omaruru, Karibib, Arandis, 
Usakos, Uis and Henties Bay (IDC, 1995).  The closest towns to the proposed Langer 
Heinrich mine are Walvis Bay (popn.~41,000) and Swakopmund (popn. ~25,000). As

Namibia has a long history of mining activities there is a ready source of qualified mining 
and technical personnel available. 

 
The water supply is from the Swakopmund terminal reservoir, with a water pipeline to 

following the district road C28 before turning north-east, following an existing dirt road into 
the mine site.  NamWater has upgraded the terminal reservoir at Swakopmund with 
additional feed facilities through the upgrading of the existing Kuiseb and Omdel borehole 
schemes. 

 
Swakopmund and Walvis Bay are linked by a 220 kV power line from the national grid.  

Power for the project is available from Walmund substation.  The power supply for the site 
runs north from the Walmund substation until it intersects the water supply pipeline.  The 
power line then follows the water pipeline to the site, servicing the intermediate water pump 
stations en route. 

 
The granting of the Mining License for the project in 2005 also confers all necessary 

surface access rights to enable sustained mining operations. 
 

5.4 Infrastructure 
 
The national road network connects the Erongo region to the rest of the country via 

Okahandja, Windhoek and Otjiwarongo.  The trunk roads between Windhoek, Okahandja, 
Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and Omaruru are tarred.  Other major connections are gravel or 
salt roads.  The gravel road C14 passes south of the Langer Heinrich deposit. 

 
Railway connections exist between Walvis Bay, Otjiwarongo and Windhoek.  This railway 

network connects further to South Africa.  A class A airport is located at Walvis Bay.  The 
harbour at Walvis Bay is one of the key economic features of the region.  The harbour has 
two bulk terminals, cold storage facilities and ship repair and marine engineering services.  
A border post exists at the harbour as well as at the Walvis Bay airport. 

 
 

5.5 Physiography 
 
Namibia can be divided into three north-south geographic zones, which run parallel to 

the coast, namely the Desert Zone, the Scarp and the Plateau. 
 
The Desert Zone commences at the coast and extends eastwards as a steadily rising plain, 

attaining a height above sea level of about 650 m at the base of the Scarp.  The Scarp is a zone 
of rugged hills composed of outcropping metamorphic rocks and extends inland to around 
200 km from the coast where it meets the western edge of the inland Plateau.  The 1,500 m 
high Plateau extends eastwards uninterrupted into Botswana. 

 
The Langer Heinrich deposit is located at the eastern edge of the Desert Zone, in the 

foothills at the base of the Scarp within the most northerly part of the Namib-Naukluft 
National Park.  The project area is situated within and beneath a 1 km to 2 km wide, flat-
bottomed valley, wedged between the Langer Heinrich Mountains on the north (elevation 
1,152 m AMSL) and the Schiefer Mountains to the south (elevation 883 m AMSL).  The 
mineralised valley is 710 m AMSL at its high point and descends gradually toward the west 
to an elevation of 550 m AMSL 

 



 
 

 

30

The regional area is sparsely vegetated and very poorly watered.  The rainfall is low and 
the rivers are normally dry.  Occasionally stormwater entering the rivers in the upland areas 
reaches the sea.  Perennial surface water occurs at a few points in the rivers, but subsurface 
water is present in the larger rivers all year. 

 
Present day runoff is restricted to the Gawib and Tinkas rivers, which both flow into the 

Swakop River north of the Langer Heinrich Mountain.  The Tinkas River's catches runoff 
from the eastern end of Langer Heinrich Valley, while the Gawib River drains the western 
end of Langer Heinrich Valley.  The palaeochannel in which the Langer Heinrich deposit is 
situated extends westward beyond the Gawib River and beneath the Gawib Plain.  The 
surface water catchment of the Langer Heinrich Valley is approximately 80 km2. 

 
The closest surface water gauging station is on the Swakop River at Dorstrivier, north of 

Langer Heinrich.  The flow records from this station, between 1977 and 1987 have been 
examined.  During this period the Swakop River flowed on 3 occasions, February 1980, 
March 1984 and February 1985. 

 
5.5.1 Flora and Fauna 

 
Three major vegetation zones can be distinguished in Namibia, namely deserts, savannas 

and woodlands.  The deserts are subdivided into the northern Namib, central Namib, 
southern Namib, desert and succulent steppe (winter rainfall area), and the saline desert 
with dwarfshrub savanna fringe.  The central Namib lies between the Huab and Kuiseb 
rivers and the project area occurs within this zone. 

 
The central Namib is part of southern Africa's Desert Biome.  Macro-vegetation is sparse 

to non-existent, concentrated mostly in the Swakop River.  The hills are bare rock and the 
valley and desert floors are covered by coarse grit, the finer sands and clays having been 
winnowed towards the coast by the strong prevailing north-easterly winds.  Plant diversity 
is comparable to other desert regions of the world, but the levels of endemism are 
remarkably high.  Just over 400 plant species, about 10% of the flora of Namibia, occur in the 
central Namib. 

 
Three species of small native mammal were recorded on the site.  All are relatively 

numerous across their natural range in Southern Africa.   
 
Six species of large mammals were recorded.  The gemsbok, springbok, common duiker 

and klipspringer are relatively common species in Southern Africa.  Hartmann's mountain 
zebra, on the other hand, presently has a discontinuous distribution in small four 
populations, one of which is in the Naukluft mountains.  The only mammalian predator 
recorded is the brown hyaena. 

 
Five reptile species have been recorded and are likely to be common on the site and in 

suitable habitat in the wider region.  Three of the recorded species are endemic.  The 
Waterberg sand lizard however, has a very restricted range and could be of conservation 
concern. 

 
Eighteen bird species have been identified although none are considered as endangered 

within Namibia. 
 
The habitat and environmental features on the proposed mining site and those in the 

general vicinity are neither unique nor restricted in extent.  Those habitats present are 



 
 

 

31

represented in the Namib-Naukluft Park, adjacent to the site.  The total area that would be 
affected by the proposed mining activities is relatively small in regional terms, and has been 
subjected to intense exploration activities in the past. 

 
Most of the native fauna species present at this locality appear tolerant of varying degrees 

of disturbance and human activity, indicated by their persistence in spite of previous 
disturbance.  No species of conservation interest have been recorded.   

 

6  Project  History 
 
The exploration history of the Langer Heinrich Uranium Project is summarised in Table 4.  

It includes work carried out by Gencor and Acclaim during the periods that those companies 
controlled the Project. Any resources or reserves attributable to either Gencor or Acclaim

Table 4: Exploration History of the Langer Heinrich Uranium Project 
 
Details of the various stages of exploration and the programmes that were undertaken are 

set out below. 
 
 

6.1 Discovery 
 
Airborne radiometric surveys of the Namib were carried out by the State during 1968 

through the Geological Survey of the Republic of South Africa.  Based on the results of this 
initial survey the Ministry of Mines set aside a number of concessions for application by 
tender.  A consortium headed by Gencor was granted the Langer Heinrich concession. 

 
Towards the end of 1973 Gencor carried out a follow-up ground radiometric survey in the 

Gawib River valley, which verified the airborne results.  They identified several radiometric 
anomalies, which coincided with outcropping occurrences of carnotite in calc-arkosic valley-
fill sediments. 

 
 

6.2 Gencor 
 

6.2.1 Gencor Drilling 
 
Gencor drilled approximately 1,800 open-hole percussion drill holes on a 50m x 50m or 

100m x 100m grid-pattern.  These holes were drilled to delineate the geology and structure 
and to allow an estimate of the uranium resources of the Project.  They remain the main 
source of information for the Langer Heinrich Deposit.  Drill cuttings were analysed by XRF. 

 
This drilling could not penetrate either the unconsolidated gravel in the present-day, dry 

Gawib drainage channel or the area beneath some of the conglomerate terrace material.  In 
these areas the orebody remained untested.  Delineation of mineralisation below the water 
could not be established as the wet sandy clay caved in due to groundwater influx.  Potential 
of increasing defined reserves therefore exists as a considerable part of the orebody remains 
untested. 

 
Gencor drilled 72 diamond drill holes in order to: 

• determine the accuracy and limitations of open-hole percussion drilling by twinning a 
number of the percussion drill holes; 

• provide a means of estimating uranium resources below the water table; 

• allow estimation of uranium resources, in lateral extensions, beneath the Gawib River 
bed.  (These holes were used in Gencor's 1981 & 1983 internal ore reserve estimates 
when the high-grade resources of the deposit were calculated); and 

• give details of distribution and characteristics of uranium and rock types throughout 
the deposit. 

Core recovery in the early holes was poor in the unconsolidated sections.  Later triple tube 
core barrels were employed and recovery improved with better equipment and drilling 
practices.  Diamond drilling gave precise contacts to mineralisation and a more accurate 
assessment of grade. 

 



 
 

 

33

Poor-repeatability of assays from percussion drill hole samples was recognised in the 
Gencor drilling programs.  To evaluate the extent of this problem a program of excavating 
small pits or shafts was undertaken in 1976.  Gencor compared assayed grades of percussion 
drill holes to the excavated grade of material from 32 pits (shafts) excavated through the 
mineralisation.  The 2m x 1m pits were dug in groups of four, one located at each corner of a 
100m x 100m square. 

 
Each pit was sited with an original percussion drill hole in its centre.  A further four 

percussion holes were drilled on the corners of the proposed pit.  The percussion drill holes 
were sampled at 1metre intervals. 

 
A 4.2 tonne bulk sample was collected from each one metre depth interval in the 

mineralised section of each pit (mineralised sections ranged from 6m to 22m depth) and 
transported to the bulk sample stockpile site, located nearby.  The bulk samples were 
crushed, coned and quartered, milled and riffled down to 5kg on site.  Grab samples, cone 
and quartered samples and riffled samples were all sent to Group Laboratories in South 
Africa for analysis. 

 
Statistical evaluation of the pitting and percussion results were interpreted at the time to 

show that the percussion drilling defined the grades of the mineralisation within a 95% 
confidence level.  It was therefore concluded from this pit sampling programme that the 
average percussion drill sample analysis is accurate enough to provide an accurate resource 
estimate for the Langer Heinrich Deposit.  

 
6.2.2 Gencor Trial Mining 

 
Trial mining exercises were undertaken involving excavation of a Mega-Trench and a 

Test-Pit.  These campaigns enabled Gencor to develop satisfactory mining and grade control 
methods. 

 
The objective of the Mega-trench project was to: 
 

• Determine the distribution of carnotite and its relation to rock type; 

• Assess the degree of ore upgrading possible by selective mining; 

• Determine the blasting and physical characteristics of the CaCO3 cemented clastic 
sediments; 

• Provide ore for a pilot plant; 

• Determine the physical characteristics of the ore; 

• Determine the clay content and distribution following evidence that clay had a 
deleterious effect in the liquid-solid separation phase; 

• Evaluate grade-control methods using an on-the-spot scintillometer; 

• Determine the optimum mining techniques for both clastic sediments and the 
underlying sandy-clay; 

• Assess potential problems in mining that could arise from the presence of 
groundwater; and  

• Aid the selection of mining methods and equipment. 

 



 
 

 

34

The site for the Mega-Trench was chosen as having ore of low and high grade, thicker 
than 30m, high and low clay content, ore above and below the water table and ore resting on 
elevated basement. 

 
Prior to excavation, the centre-line was drilled at 10m intervals, down to bedrock.  Drill 

hole samples from above the water table were assayed by XRF.  Down-hole radiometric 
logging was undertaken so that uranium grade could be estimated in the gritty-clay below 
the water table. 

 
Blast-holes were drilled on a staggered 3m x 1.5m pattern down to the water table.  The 

water table was between 9m and 14m (in the north) below ground level. Drill hole chips 
were radiometrically analysed and the drill holes which went beyond the water table were 
all radiometrically logged down hole.  In addition samples from blast-holes, spaced every 
6m x 6m were, analysed for U3O8, V2O5, Cl and suspended solids (clay).  This selective 
assaying resulted in samples from 25% of the blast holes drilled being analysed. 

 

In addition 70ο (from the vertical) "smooth-wall" blast-holes were drilled at 2m intervals 
along the side of the pit.  The complete excavation was blasted to the water table prior to 
excavating and loading.  Re-blasts were necessary in several areas to render the ore and 
waste rock manageable with the small-scale equipment in use. 

 
From June to October 1977, 100,486 tonnes of ore (@ >0.1kg/t U3O8) was excavated from 

the north-northwest striking mega-trench.  The trench had planned dimensions of 280m x 
22m x up to 23m depth and was excavated to 8m below the water table. 

 
The excavation method used was to rip and load 1m thick horizontal benches to avoid 

mixing and allow an accurate assessment of grade distribution and effectiveness of selective 
loading. 

 
Trench Grade Control 
After blasting the trench floor was T-probed on a 1m x 1m pattern and marked into areas 

of different grade.  Ore was excavated in 1m thick benches according to its grade category 
and lithological category.  Each lithology and grade category had a specific dump and in 
total 23 ore dumps were established.  Rock <0.1kg/t U3O8 was dumped separately as waste. 

 
Truck Grade Control 
Each truckload of ore was T-probed at five different points of the load followed by 

Eberline scanner monitoring.  Every 10th truck was sent to the sampling plant and a 
"representative" grab sample was analysed by XRF. 

 
Systematic weighing of trucks during the Mega-Trench programme gave a dry bulk 

density, which varied from 1.95 for clay through to 2.25 for the CaCO3 cemented clastics and 
averaged 2.1g/cm3 for all ore extracted. 

 
During the trenching programme, several small perched pockets of water were 

encountered.  The maximum water flow was 2m3/hour at 606.5m AMSL proving that the 
rocks have low permeability.  Water levels within the excavation rose at a rate of 4cm/day 
during the first 8 weeks following excavation. 

 
During the trenching operations, water became a problem as the area of the trench was 

too small to excavate a sump from which to de-water.  On a larger-scale operation it was 
considered water will not offer any significant difficulty to mining operations. 



 
 

 

35

 
The Gencor conclusions of the trenching operations were as follows: 
 

• sediments occur as sub-horizontal layers 0.5m to 6m thick with undulating contacts; 

• there is an increase in grain size and CaCO3 content upwards; 

• carnotite is the only uranium mineral present and occurs throughout all clastic rock 
types.  It also occurs in joint and planes of basement rocks but this is not commercially 
significant; 

• natural cut-offs for uranium are 0.1 and 0.3 kg/t; U3O8 

• estimation of grades using 12.5m x 12.5m grid drilling compared to T-probing 
following blasting in the trench showed a correlation of ±10%; 

• percussion drill holes at 10m x 10m spacing gave excellent correlation to mined ore; 

• dilution was 5% with inclusion of internal waste in the ore; 

• selective loading is possible excavating 1m benches.  Selective loading using thicker 
benches is possible but must be controlled by drill holes as T-probes only read to 0.2-
0.5m below the pit floor; 

• bulk mining using 2m to 5m benches is possible but involves trade-off for selective 
mining and dilution; 

• trenching confirmed grade distribution and provided material for pilot plant testing 
along with correlation of percussion-hole indicated ore reserves to mineable reserves; 

• radiometric estimation of uranium grades from trucks is reliable; 

• pit-walls at 70o are very stable; 

• moisture content of ore was 2% above and 10% below the water table; 

• water inflows are not expected to cause any problems during mining operations; and 

• dewatering prior to mining is necessary. 

 

The Test-Pit was excavated from May to November 1978 to evaluate on-site upgrading 
methods using selective loading, screening and radiometric sorting techniques.  The pit was 
sited immediately alongside and to the east of the mega-trench.  A total of 80,000t of ore was 
mined of which 40,000t was passed through a pilot crushing, milling and screening plant 
erected on site. 

 
The main objectives of the Test-Pit and dry-screening plant operation were to: 

• test the effectiveness of screening and radiometric ore sorting; 

• provide ore for the pilot plant; 

• develop grade-control techniques and evaluate radiometric grade determination; 

• develop an understanding of any potential mining problems; 

• evaluate exploration and production drilling; and 

• evaluate selective loading, blasting, ripping and demarcation of grade boundaries. 

 
This work was geared specifically to enable the design of a model on which mining 

operations at Langer Heinrich could be based. 
 
The survey system used for the Test-Pit was the same as that utilised for the Mega-Trench.  

The 00m baseline defined the centre line of the Test-Pit and heights were reduced to Mean 
Sea Level.  The Test-Pit and Mega-Trench were separated by a wall of in-situ bedrock several 



 
 

 

36

metres thick.  The area selected for the Test-Pit mining was a high-grade portion of the 
orebody where lithological units are more gritty and sandy than other parts of the Deposit. 

 
The area of the Test-Pit was percussion drilled in early 1978 on a 12.5m x 12.5m grid.  

Drill-cuttings were radiometrically analysed and assayed by XRF where mineralised. 
 
Almost 75% of the material mined required blasting, the most efficient method being 

blasting of large areas in situ.  Blast-holes were drilled on a 2m x 2m square pattern.  The 
intention was to break all material to –160mm in situ, but this was not achieved and oversize 
material became a problem in the screening and sorting tests. 

 
The mining contractor, LTA Construction, carried out the blast-hole drilling, blasting, and 

excavation of the 30m x 100m x 12m deep pit.  An International TD25 bulldozer equipped 
with a one metre single-tyne ripper easily ripped semi-consolidated sandy grit, but lenses of 
calcareous cemented material caused difficulties. 

 
Ground surface was at an average 626.5m AMSL.  An average of 2m of soft sand and 

loam material was stripped as overburden and taken directly to waste dumps during May 
and June 1978. 

 
Ore was removed in 1 metre slices from 623m AMSL down to the 611m AMSL.  In situ T-

probing on a 2m x 1m grid, ripped by the bulldozer, determined grade and delineated blocks 
for selective loading.  Waste, low-grade and high-grade areas were physically demarcated.  
Grade categories were the same as those used for the Mega-Trench. 

 
Selective loading was carried out using a Poclain RC 200 face-shovel and 10-ton dump 

trucks.  Each truckload required three full shovels of material.  Loaded trucks passed under 
an Eberline Scanner and the loads were T-probed to confirm grade.  Grades derived from T-
probing of the loaded ore proved good for establishing the grade of run-of-mine product but 
were not acceptable for screened products.  A combination of truck scanning and T-probing 
was found to be most effective. 

 
The loads were then sent to waste/low-grade dumps or as feed for the screening plant.  

Every 10th load was weighed on a weighbridge to confirm tonnage calculations. 
 
Major geological boundaries were demarcated using steel droppers.  Each lithological ore 

type was loaded separately in order to test the screening efficiency of various lithological 
units.  Metal balance registers, using radiometric and chemical sampling, were kept to 
quantify the efficiency of operations from in-pit selective loading to loading the products of 
screening and sorting. 

 
The conclusions of the test mining operation from the Test-Pit were as follows: 
 
Resource estimation 

• the 50m x 50m exploration drilling underestimated the Test-Pit ore reserves; and 

• the 12.5m x 12.5m drilling predicted ore reserves accurately and is considered to be the 
optimum drill hole spacing for mine planning. 

 
Radiometric estimation of U3O8 grade 

• portable radiometric analytical devices (T-probe) were successful; 

• radiometric bore-hole logging was a reliable method of grade evaluation; 



 
 

 

37

• the Eberline truck-scanner was a highly stable, reliable and sensitive grade-evaluation 
instrument; 

• a combination of T-probing and Eberline Truck Scanning was found to back up 
selective loading, adding greatly to the upgrading of excavated ore; and 

• permanent grade control points with scanners and weighbridges should be used as 
primary checkpoints for confirmation of load grades and tonnage estimation. 

 

Selective loading 

• in spite of difficulties caused by poor fragmentation of the cemented conglomerates 
and grits, selective loading definitely achieved higher grades of ore being fed to the 
screening plant. 

 

Dilution 

• dilution was less than 10%. 

 

 

6.2.3 Gencor Screening and Process Trials 
 
The Screening Plant had a design capacity of 250 tonnes per hour, however, during 

operation it averaged 80 to 100 tonnes per hour.  Over the four months of testing from July to 
November 1978 40,000t of ore was screened. 

 
The objectives of the operation were to: 
 

• Quantify upgrading by screening of various feed head grades; 

• Test the efficiency of belt sorting; 

• Supply the pilot plant with upgraded fines for metallurgical tests; 

• Supply minus 25mm to minus 160mm material for lump sorting tests; and 

• Establish the operating efficiency of the screening plant design. 

 
Conclusions of the screening plant operation were that: 
 

• Carnotite concentrated in the finest fraction, (<3mm) except where there is a high 
proportion of clayey material; 

• Upgrading in the fines was achieved throughout the project; 

• A large proportion of the carnotite remained in downgraded +5mm to –25mm and 
+25mm material; 

• Conglomerate ore is best suited to upgrading by screening as the boulders and pebbles 
containing no U3O8 are easily screened out; 

• Coarser grits responded well with large amounts of quartz and feldspar in the grit 
fraction reporting to the +5mm –25mm fraction; 

• Calcareous grits were found to have a high-grade component in the +5mm to –25mm 
fraction; 

• Screening of sandy ore was only partially successful due to high fines content; 

• Silt and fine sandy ore were not suited to upgrading; 



 
 

 

38

• Simple screening upgraded the ore by a factor of 1.92, however a considerable amount 
of metal was lost to the waste in this process; 

• A moisture content >5% made screening almost impossible; 

• Radiometric belt sorters were not particularly effective as the ore was mixed during 
mining, loading and screening operations; and 

• The belt sorter only separated lower grade ore when the grade of the whole truckload 
was low.  Belt sorters remain a potentially advantageous method of feed grade control. 

 

Gencor constructed a one tonne per hour alkaline leach pilot plant.  The objectives of the 
pilot plant study were as follows: 

 

• Establish a grindability index for the ore; 

• Confirm the leach parameters established during the laboratory investigations; 

• Establish the settling and the checking characteristics of the leach slime; 

• Test ion exchange in unclassified pregnant solutions; and 

• Test the most effective uranium precipitation methods. 

 

The pilot plant was run over a twelve-month period and resulted in identification of a 
coherent flowsheet for the project.  Liquid-solid separation remained problematic.  

 
 

6.3 Acclaim Exploration 1999 
 
Following acquisition of the Langer Heinrich Uranium Project Acclaim drilled and re-

evaluated the Deposit and completed a positive Pre-Feasibility Study incorporating the 
results of the additional drilling for resource verification 

 
The primary effort of Acclaim centered on confirming the high-grade resource that had 

been identified by Gencor.  Production using the high-grade portion of the orebody, 
particularly in the early years, was seen as a key component to bring the deposit into 
production 

 
With the majority of the old Gencor data acquired, Acclaim's main objective was to prove 

that the Gencor data could be used and incorporated with data generated by Acclaim in 
1999.  The Gencor information was entered into a digital database along with data collected 
in the 1999 programmes.  Validation of the old information involved confirming the location 
and accuracy of all sampling points and determining the accuracy of all sample results. 

 
Surveying was undertaken by Acclaim to validate Gencor's survey base station network 

and to confirm the location and accuracy of drill holes, pits, Mega-Trench, Test-Pit etc.  
Internal and external checking procedures of the Gencor laboratory in Springs, Johannesburg 
were sought and confirmed.  Calibration methods and check procedures were confirmed for 
down-hole radiometric logging.  Bulk dry and wet densities were confirmed.  Reverse 
circulation drilling was undertaken to confirm the validity of results from Gencor's 
percussion and diamond drilling and pitting and to confirm their "reserve estimates". 

 
6.3.1 Acclaim Surveying 

 

Willem Knotze Professional Land Surveyors of 10 Eugene Marais Street, Windhoek, 
Namibia carried out an evaluation and field check of Gencor's survey work. 



 
 

 

39

 
A differential global positioning system (DGPS) using total-stations and precise levelling 

confirmed the high accuracy of seven original survey control stations within the Langer 
Heinrich valley by surveying and tying into three external Trig stations. 

 
Positions of all Gencor's surveyed points were found to be of a high accuracy.  Gencor's 

plotted positions for percussion drill hole collars agreed with their newly surveyed positions, 
with a mean error of 545mm within the horizontal plane and 419mm in the vertical plane.  
Diamond drill hole collar coordinates were found to be precise with errors of less than 
100mm.  Positions of pits, the Mega-Trench and Test-Pit were similarly found to be surveyed 
to a high level of accuracy. 

 

Acclaim's 1999 RC drill hole collar positions were surveyed to an accuracy of ±40mm by 
the DGPS survey work. 

 
Gencor had carried out a low-level aerial photographic survey in 1975.  Using the survey 

control network established at that time (white painted rock aerial markers which are still in 
place today) a 1:5,000 topographic plan with one metre contours was produced by 
photogrammetry.  A paper print of this plan was scanned, vectorised and tied into the 
survey control points established by Gencor. 
 

 

6.3.2 Acclaim Reverse Circulation Drilling 
 

The objectives of Acclaim's 1999 drilling programme were to: 
 
• Confirm the accuracy of the Gencor percussion and diamond drill results; 

• Prove that the high-grade core in this part of the deposit was continuous and could be 
mined as an entity; 

• Confirm the size and grade of extensions of mineralisation beneath the current Gawib 
River drainage channels and below the water table, as predicted from widely spaced 
diamond drilling carried out by Gencor; and 

• Drill out one area on a close-spaced grid pattern to allow a comparison to be made 
between  resource estimates based on Gencor's drill holes and Acclaim's 1999 RC drill 
holes and the confirmation of both.  

 
A total of 107 RC percussion holes were drilled by Acclaim between 28 May and 29 June 

1999.  Holes were positioned on the historical grid lines midway between Gencor holes.  A 
number of holes were drilled alongside selected Gencor percussion and diamond holes with 
some holes being drilled down the existing Gencor drill holes. 

 
The drill rig used was a reverse circulation air-core unit using a 1995 Hydco multipurpose 

top head drive rig mounted on a late model MAN 4x4 truck with a planetary drive train.  
The depths of holes varied between 16m and 45m. 

 
Drill chips were collected in a cyclone over 1m depth intervals into pre-numbered 

polywoven sample bags.  Each sample was weighed, lithologically logged and the total-
count radioactivity reading noted (using a 1 sec count on a Scintrex GIS 5 hand-held 
scintillometer).  An Auslog, calibrated, total-count radiometric logging system was used by 
Acclaim as the primary tool to determine equivalent U3O8 grade. 

 



 
 

 

40

The downhole logging succeeded in accurately locating the boundaries of the U3O8 
mineralisation and has excellent repeatability (shown by multiple recordings). XRF assays 
from both historic and 1999 drilling compared closely with grade determined from 
radiometric down-hole logging with differences in modelled grade of only 6%. 

 
Sample selection for chemical analysis was guided by the radiometric down-hole logging 

results.  All samples from mineralized intersections were submitted for analysis including an 
un-mineralised sample 1m either side of the mineralized interval.  Each entire 1m sample 
was dispatched to SGS analytical laboratories in Springs RSA for analysis. 

 
6.3.3 Paladin 2004 Infill drilling 

 
Paladin undertook infill Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling during the latter half of 2004 

(Rich, 2004).  This program had a number of objectives: 
 

• Infill existing Gencor and Acclaim drilling within Detail 1 to 50x50m sufficient to meet JORC 
requirements for "indicated" reserves particularly below the water table.  

• Test the theory that the palaeochannel thalweg extends due west from the Detail 1 test pit 
area to Detail 2. 

• Obtain bulk sample material for bench scale process testing. 
• Obtain samples from above and below the water table for disequilibrium studies. 
• Drill geotechnical holes for the mill and tailings sites. 
 
Drilling statistics are detailed below in Table 5, Two drilling contractors were used,

The drill crews commenced at about 6am and often worked through to 8pm or later, 7 

days a week.  The low average daily production rates are indicative of the difficulties both 
contractors encountered, particularly associated with the ground conditions, deep soft sands 
and down hole drilling conditions, unconsolidated boulders at surface and unconsolidated 
to weakly consolidated sediments at depth.   

 
6.3.4  Evaluation 
 
 

Resource Drilling provided a Smith Capital 14R6H mounted on a Samil 6x6 truck along 
with a Samil 6x6 support vehicle, Drillcon Africa provided an Ingersol Rand S4W rig but 
mounted on a double rear wheel drive Ford flatbed truck.  The compressor was separate, 
mounted on a 4x4 Samil along with a 4x4 Samil support truck. 

 
Both rigs used rods of identical outer and inner wall thickness, thereby allowing the same 

casing factor to be used for all radiometric logging.  The Resource Drilling holes were 
collared with 140mm thick walled (about 10mm) PVC.  This was robust enough to allow 



 
 

 

41

casing to be advanced with the hammer.  Drillcon Africa used thinner walled 140mm PVC 
and had much trouble with the PVC shattering during the collaring process. 

 
Resource Drilling  utilised a drill rig mounted Atlas Copco compressor with common 

intake manifold for the engine and compressor,  the Drillcon Africa drill rig used an Ingersol 
Rand compressor which being separately mounted could be parked at some distance from 
the drill rig and provided a better quality compressed air supply.

Figure 8: Drill Rigs used by LHU 

 
Geologically the Detail 1 & 2 areas proved extremely difficult to drill.  There were two 

principal problems: 
 

• unconsolidated boulder conglomerate at surface 
 

• unconsolidated to weakly consolidated sediments at depth  
 
Boulder conglomerates occur at surface and to a depth of about 6m at the eastern end of   

Detail 1.  Only Drillcon Africa encountered these conglomerates.  They contain boulders to 
0.5m diameter and form an unconsolidated (non calcreted) surface deposit.  The problem for 
the driller is that he must try to drill a hole through this and seat the casing in competent 
(calcreted) channel sediments.  The drill hammer tended to slip off boulder faces, boulders 
shifted and frequently the upper 1 to 2 m simply blew out leaving a large crater.  In these 
cases the hole was abandoned and redrilled.  The second problem was knowing where 
competent ground commenced.  Drillcon Africa tended to case off too early resulting in blow 
by around the outside of the casing.  Again several holes had to be abandoned when this 
became too extreme to continue. 

 
Unconsolidated sediments at depth were the most serious problem.  Gencor were well 

aware of this reporting that the presence of incompetent, soft, malleable when wet, 
sediments described as clayey siltstones, found in drill holes below the present day 
calcareous and gypsiferous duricrust are of importance to both the extraction metallurgy and 
to mining.  The current drilling indicates that these sediments are both clayey and in some 
instances simply well sorted fine sands and silts.  These are often "running" sands which 
bind around the rods preventing outside return, typically 90% of the air is returned with the 
sample up the inner annulus, the remaining 10% returns outside the rods to keep the drill 
hole clear.   



 
 

 

42

 
Because large quantities of air have been injected into the formation it is usually under 

pressure.  On numerous occasions running sands ran up 2 or 3 rod lengths necessitating 
tripping the rods and cleaning them out.  Even where this material does not run, the drillers 
still found it very difficult to maintain outside return.  Difficulties were often experienced 
withdrawing the hammer as material built up above the hammer prevented it entering the 
hole in the overlying competent calcreted sediments.   

 
Clay layers were also a problem.  Generally they resulted in the hammer being blocked 

and having to be withdrawn and cleaned out (often numerous times).  Often this occurred 
right above the basement contact (in some cases in deeply weathered basement saprolite) 
although puggy clay layers also occur in the channel itself. 

 
 
Ten compartment plastic chip trays were used to collect samples for the Namibian 

Department of Minerals and Energy (DME).  A sample was collected for every metre drilled.  
This process was designed to allow the DME to collect a number of reference samples over 
the deposit. 

 
All holes were radiometrically logged through the rods.  All logging was done with 

standard Auslog 43mm probes.  In a number of holes radiometric logging could not be 
completed to the bottom due to the probe hanging up on dirt or grit in the inner tube.  In 
such cases the probe was removed, and rods reflushed with air.  Normally this cleared the 
blockage however in a few instances the radiometric log had to be terminated above 
basement.  Radiometric data was e-mailed to Australia every evening and deconvolved data 
was available the following morning Namibian time. 

 
Holes LH 1001 to 1025 were riffle split in their entirety.  This proved too cumbersome and 

slow so for holes LH 1026 onwards only the sections to be sent for geochemical analyses 
were split.  With one rig the splitting crew could keep up with the rig however after two rigs 
commenced, the splitting crew worked independently.  Three identical sets of samples 
(average sample weight 400-500 g) were split for each metre to be analysed.  These were 
labelled 'A', 'B' & 'C'.  The 'C' samples were sent for assay with duplicates being drawn from 
the 'B' set.  The remaining 'A' set was set aside as a reference.  

 
Samples were prepared for submission to the assay lab as a separate task after the drilling 

was completed.  Samples were laid out in order and blanks inserted after the mineralised 
peaks (located by consulting the deconvolved eU3O8 and confirmed by scintillometer).  These 
blanks comprised dune sand collected south of Swakopmund.  Under the binocular 
microscope this material appears to be well sorted quartz sand with minor iron oxide grain 
coatings.  It assays below LLD (<4ppm U3O8).

6.3.6 Scope of Drilling Programme 

 
The scope of the drilling programme included drilling work required for planning 

purposes, infill to increase confidence in resource model and exploration.  The drilling was 
undertaken in the areas Detail 1, 2 and 7 and the drilling was commenced on 15th June by R 
A Longstaff (Namibia), using a Super Rock 1000 rig adapted for RC drilling and towing a 
separate Atlas Copco 1000 cfm x 260 psi compressor (Figure 9).  PVC collars were installed to

6m depth using a conventional hammer and holes were completed using a Reverse 
Circulation (RC) hammer.

Drilling commenced in the north western part of Detail 2, moving westwards into Detail 
7. Initially, the drilling progress was slow, since the rig was run by an inexperienced crew 
and driller, who had problems drilling the difficult ground. The major problem was 

unconsolidated to weakly consolidated and generally clay rich sediments at depth. 
However, the production rate improved considerably after an experienced driller was 
brought to site. Additionally, a second rig was brought onto site in July to prepare the collars 
for the RC rig. A total number of 244 boreholes and 51 pre-collars resulting in a total number 
of 11826 m have been drilled along the Detail 1, Detail 2, and Detail 7 areas during this year's 
RC drilling programme in the period from 15 June to 2 November 2005. The large number of 
"unused" pre-collars results from the fact the pre-collaring rig collared all planned holes (up 
to ten in each line). However, results from completed holes have often shown that only three 
or four holes per line were necessary to define the channel. 

 
All holes were geologically and radiometrically logged. Samples were collected through a 

cyclone for each meter drilled and split through a riffle-splitter by the drilling crew to give a 
sample for assay of 3 to 4 kg.  Rods and hammers have been lost in holes LH1667 & LH1168. 
After the completion of the drilling programme the drillers were able to retrieve rods and 
hammers from both holes.

6.3.8 Scope of Drilling Programme 

 
The scope of the drilling programme included drilling work required for exploration 

purposes in order to increase geological confidence, establish indicated mineral resources 
and increase inferred  mineral resources for Detail 5, 3 ,4 and 6.

In the run-up to the drilling programme an electromagnetic survey was conducted by 
Bittner Water Consult with the aim to localize the main course of the Langer Heinrich 
palaeo-channel (BIWAC 2006). The drilling work commenced on 5th July by RA Longstaff 
Namibia (Pty) Ltd, using a Super Rock 1000 rig adapted for RC drilling. An Atlas Copco 1000 
cfm x 260 psi compressor was towed separately. A total number of 231 boreholes resulting in 
a total number of 6355 drill meters have been drilled along Detail 3, 5 and 6 between 5th July 
and 15th September 2006 (Fig. 1). Initially, boreholes were drilled along 200 m line spacing 
with a 100 m distance between the boreholes of each line. Boreholes of this first phase of the 
drilling intersected the basement. Later, infill drilling along 100 m line spacing was 
conducted in the mineralized areas, which were defined during the first phase of drilling. 
The boreholes of the second phase of drilling intersected the mineralized zone, but did not 
intersect the basement in order to save drilling meters. The boreholes were between 4 and 51 
m deep with an average depth of 27.5 m. The drilling progress was good with an average 
daily drilling rate of 119 m; only minor problems with weakly unconsolidated and clay-
bearing sediments were encountered. No drilling equipment was lost during the campaign. 
The boreholes were geologically and radiometrically logged. Drill chip samples were 
collected through a cyclone for each meter drilled and split through a riffle-splitter by the 
drilling crew to give a sample for assay of 3 to 5 kg.

6.3.9 Safety 
 

Both, LHU and RA Longstaff complied with safety standards and wore long trousers and 
long sleeve shirts as well as appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including hard 
hat, ear plugs, dust masks, safety glasses and safety boots. Radiation exposure was 
monitored during the drilling campaign. Each member of the drilling crew as well as the 
LHU staff were equipped with personal dosimeters.

7  Geological  Setting 
 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Swakopmund environ forms part of the Damara Belt eugeosyncline.  The oldest beds 

consists of psammitic rocks of the Nosib Group overlain by several thousand metres of 
pelitic rocks of the Swakop Group and the Khomas Subgroup all of Neoproterozoic Age.  
Folding, combined with regional granitisation took place between 650 and 500 Ma ago.  
Some of these orogenic granites, for example Rössing, are uraniferous.  A number of 
subvolcanic to volcanic non-orogenic complexes were emplaced 120 Ma ago and huge 
volumes of basaltic lava were extruded.  Remnants of this basaltic cover have been preserved 
and are up to 800 m thick.  Weathering and erosion of the uraniferous granites was the 
source of uranium that precipitated to form secondary deposits such as Langer Heinrich. 

 
The lowermost rocks of the Damara Sequence, the pink quartzite of the Etusis Formation 

of the Nosib Group, form the Langer Heinrich Mountain anticlinorium, a major structure of 
the area.  Overlying these quartzites are schists comprised of rhythmically interbedded fine-
grained metapelite, metagreywacke and calcsilicate beds.  Collectively these form the Tinkas 
Member of the Khomas Subgroup, with a maximum thickness of 3,000 m.  The uranium 
mineralised Langer Heinrich palaeochannel is principally eroded into these schists.  Locally 
the base of the Khomas Subgroup is represented by glacial marine sediments of the Chuos 
Formation of which the thickness varies from 0 to 250 m. 

 
The orogenic Salem granite has intruded the metasediments and covers large areas north 

of the Langer Heinrich Mountain.  Southeast of the mountain, the Bloedkoppie granite, a 
leucocratic late-to-post-tectonic member of the Salem granite suite, has intruded the 
metasediments and covers an area of about 25 km2.  A portion of this granitic area forms the 
catchment drainage for the Langer Heinrich valley.  On average, it contains 10 – 15 ppm 
U3O8 and values up to 100 ppm U3O8 have been measured radiometrically.  These rocks are 
believed to be the source of the uranium in the Langer Heinrich deposit.  The Bloedkoppie 
granite is of the same age as the alaskite of the Rössing mine region and may be genetically 
related. 

 
The uranium mineralisation is calcrete related and occurs in valley-fill sediments within 

an extensive roughly east-west tertiary palaeodrainage system.  The calcrete consists of 
interstitial calcium carbonate that was precipitated under arid to semi-arid climatic 
conditions. 

 
The uranium occurs as carnotite, which is a secondary oxidised carbonate mineral 

containing both uranium and vanadium.  The deposit occurs over a 15 km length with seven 
drill-indicated higher grade pods (Details 1 to 7, Figure 11) occurring within a lower grade 
mineralised envelope.  The carnotite occurs as thin films filling cavities and fracture planes 
and as grain coatings and disseminations in the calcretised sediments.  Mineralisation is 
near-surface and and the host sequence varies from 0 to 60 m thick, and between 50 m and 
1,100 m wide, depending on the width of the palaeovalley. 

 
After calcrete development and mineralisation, parts of these sediments were eroded as a 

result of uplift that caused rejuvenated river flows - the largest being the Gawib River that in 
part follows the palaeovalley and has dissected and modified both the calcrete and 
associated mineralisation.  Headwater erosion by the Tinkas and Gawib rivers has eroded 
30 m – 40 m of the original palaeovalley sedimentary cover along the central and eastern 



 
 

 

46

portion of the orebody, and river capture by the Tinkas River has reversed the direction of 
the drainage system so that today the most eastern part of the orebody drains eastward into 
the Tinkas River.  A portion of the orebody has also been removed by this erosional process.  
Where not dissected by these ephemeral drainage systems, the deposit is blanketed by 
variable thicknesses of river sand and scree.  For instance, in Detail 7 this cover exceeds 40 m.

8  Deposit  Type 
 
Langer Heinrich is a calcrete related uranium deposit associated with valley-fill sediments 

occurring within an extensive Tertiary palaeodrainage system.  The calcretes are limestone 
deposits formed as chemical precipitates developed under arid to semi-arid climate 
conditions.  At Langer Heinrich calcretisation has affected a complex sequence of fluvially 
derived conglomerates, grits, sandstone, silts and clay deposits worked in a braided stream 
depositional environment. 

 
Beneath the sediments is a rugged basement topography, which occasionally rises high 

enough to form outliers exposed above the valley sediments.  As the basement rocks 
alternate between erosionally resistant and softer lithologies, the valley width changes from 
1 km to 2 km wide, to narrow gorges only a few hundred metres wide. 

 
The fluvial sedimentary sequence comprising the Langer Heinrich Formation is up to 

100 m thick and comprises clasts of angular to rounded basement debris in alternating bands 
of conglomerate, grit, sand, clay-grit and clay.  These sediments have undergone variable 
cementation by calcium carbonate (CaCO3) known as calcrete that precipitated from 
groundwater moving down the valley.  This CaCO3 can comprise up to 15% of the total rock 
mass.  

 
Uranium mineralisation has been defined along 15 km of the east-west trending 

palaeovalley and is nearly continuous along this section of the palaeovalley system.  The 
mineralisation is still open to the west where the cover is in excess of 40 m. 

 
 

9  Mineral isation 
 
Mineralisation at Langer Heinrich consists of sub-horizontal carnotite that has been 

precipitated within clastic valley-fill rock units, which vary from conglomerates through 
grits and sands to micaceous claystone.  In a general way, ore becomes finer grained with 
depth and hence ore from beneath the water table is mainly micaceous claystone. 

 
Carnotite is the only uranium mineral reported at Langer Heinrich.  It occurs as finely 

disseminated specks, as blebs up to 20 mm thick and coatings in open pore spaces, which are 
irregularly distributed within the matrix of all host lithologies within the valley.  The 
carnotite occurs preferentially in the less cemented portions of the host sediments. 

 
The mineralisation occurs as an undulating 1 m to 30 m thick layer, shaped like a 

subterranean meandering river.  At intervals down the valley, thick "pond-like" pods of 
higher-grade uranium have formed.  These are generally located immediately upstream of a 
narrowing of the valley.  These high-grade pods have probably formed where depositional 
solutions have ponded in basement depressions. The colour scheme for Figure 13 is as 
follows: grey represents 0-250ppm, blue 250-400ppm green 400-6500ppm and red >650ppm 
and the panels are scaled to the mineralisation proportion at a 250ppm cut off. 

 



 
 

 

48

 
 
 

 
Figure 13: Langer Heinrich Uranium Mineralisation 

 

 
Grade distribution within a layer, in cross-section, is as a series of broad concentric 

ellipsoidal shells, with highest grades in a central core and decreasing towards the bottom, 
top and banks of the channel.  Some of these findings may be a function of the drill hole 
spacing and/or lack of drilling in specific areas.  Within these mineralised ellipsoidal shells 
grade distribution in detail is very erratic or nuggetty.  However, the overall continuity of 
the mineralisation in plan view is quite strong. 

 
Calcium carbonate is an important constituent and the ore can be divided into low and 

high carbonate categories.  Calcium carbonate occurs in concentrations from 5% up to 35% 
and cements clastic particles together until, at high concentrations, an indurated rock has 
been formed.  The indurated layers are not related to lithology and tend to form sub-
horizontal layers of varying thickness.  The hard carbonate-cemented layers contain 
disseminated carnotite, but generally at lower concentrations than in the more porous less 
cemented sediments. 

 
Below the water table, mineralisation appears to be hosted in an unconsolidated 

micaceous silt-sand-clay.  Mineralogical investigation of the mineralisation shows uranium 
present only as carnotite, the potassium uranyl-vanadate mineral [K2(VO4)2(UO2)2.3H2O].  
Carnotite is interstitial to the clastic grains, generally as fine-grained flakes, though larger 
blebs, clumps and open-space coatings are present.  Carnotite occurs preferentially in less 
cemented sections of the ore but shows no relationship to any rock type.  It does not occur 
within the matrix of any of the clasts, whether boulder, sand, or silt size.

10  Explorat ion 
 

Exploration activities by LHU have been restricted to infill drilling of all Details to 
increase confidence in the estimation of the mineralisation.  This drilling is detailed in section 
11 below. Drilling operations referred to in this section were conducted by Major Drilling 
Namibia (PTY) Limited ("Major Drilling"), a subsidiary of Major Drilling Group 
International Inc.

11.1.1 Scope of Drilling Programme 

 
The scope of the drilling programme included drilling work required for planning 

purposes, infill to increase confidence in resource model and exploration.  The drilling was 
undertaken in  all Details with 50m x 50m infill drilling confined to Details 1 and 2 to the 
west of the current pit. In other Details the drilling was confined to closing off current drill 
lines to both the north and south as well as replacing some short holes drilled by Gencor. 
Detail 7 was drilled more systematically to enable the completion of a more representative 
resource estimate. Drilling activities were conducted by Major Drilling (Namibia) with up to 
3 drill rigs being used throughout the drilling program (Figure 14).  These consisted of a 
Suprarock 1000 mounted on a Mercedes 6x6 with integral compressor and rod rack, a Samail 
100 with integral compressor and a rod rack on a support truck and a Mercedes 1113 6x6 
with compressor on a separate support truck. All compressors used were XHP Ingersol Rand 
and capable of 400 psi and 900 cfm. PVC collars were installed to 6m depth using a 
conventional hammer and holes were completed using a Reverse Circulation (RC) hammer.  

 

 
 

Figure 14: Close spaced drilling to the west of the Gencor trial pit 

 
 

Drilling commenced immediately to the west of the historic Gencor trial pits in Detail 1, 
moving westwards into Detail 2. Previous experience with drilling conditions at Langer 
Heinrich enabled all drill crews to make rapid progress. The only problems encountered 
were unconsolidated to weakly consolidated and generally clay rich sediments at depth 
which cause the rods to get bogged intermittently. A total number of 717 boreholes resulting 
in a total number of 17,731 m have been drilled in all areas during this year's RC drilling 
programme in the period from May 2007 to June 2008.  

 



 
 

 

51

All holes were geologically and radiometrically logged. Samples were collected through a 
cyclone for each meter drilled and split through a riffle-splitter by the drilling crew to give a 
sample for assay of 3 to 4 kg.   

 
11.1.2 Safety 
 

Both, LHU and Major Drilling complied with safety standards and wore long trousers 
and long sleeve shirts as well as appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including 
hard hat, ear plugs, dust masks, safety glasses and safety boots. Radiation exposure was 
monitored during the drilling campaign. Each member of the drilling crew as well as the 
LHU staff were equipped with personal dosimeters. 

 
 

11.1.3 Drill Hole Collar Locations 
 
All drill holes from the 2005 and 2006 drilling campaign were surveyed by contract 

licensed surveyor, Willem Knotze of Windhoek using DGPS, and those drilled in 2007 and 
2008 for this resource update were surveyed by the mine site surveyor, also using DGPS, at 
both set out and post drilling. The average variation between set out and drilled position was 
2.7m with the largest displacement being 15.22m for topographic reasons.

12  Sampling Methods 
 

12.1 Paladin 2007 - 2008 Resource Close Off and Infill drilling 
 

12.1.1 Lithological logging 
 
All boreholes were geologically logged.  At the drill site, samples were checked for their 

colour, moisture, weight, and HCl reaction.  Additionally, all samples were measured for 
total gamma count using a Saphymo SPP2.  The sensitivity of Saphymo SPP2 was tested on 
the concrete pads at the old Gencor camp site.  After samples were split through a riffle-
splitter, RC drill chips were obtained by sieving the reject sample and then lithologically 
logged.  The lithological logging included the description of grain-size, sorting, mineralogy 
and the definition of a lithological code.  Finally, the reject samples were disposed in the old 
test pit area of Gencor's. The drill chips were stored at the sample container in the vicinity of 
the old Gencor camp site area. The logging data were captured in Microsoft Excel.  

 
 

12.1.2 Downhole logging 
 
Each hole was radiometrically logged through the RC rods after completion of drilling 

and prior to the rods being withdrawn from the hole.  A number of holes were logged in the 
open hole as well in order to confirm the calculation of a casing factor. Recalculation of 
casing factors in the course of the drilling programme indicated that the rods had a lower 
factor than the rods previously used in 2006. Finally, calculations by Doug Barrett suggest 
that a factor of 1.96 should be used instead of the 2.03 factor, which was used initially. 
Equivalent U3O8 values were calculated using the deconvolution methodology provided by 
consulting geophysicist Doug Barrett.

12.1.3 The purpose of sleeve calibrations 
 
As a routine part of the downhole logging operations at LHU, a calibration sleeves 

supplied by Auslog are read on all downhole probes each day before the commencement of 
logging. These readings are recorded and provide a quantitative check on the correct 
functioning of the logging system. Any variation in the calibration reading outside of the 
expected statistical range indicates a possible malfunction in the probe or the logger 
electronics. The readings also provide a longer term quality control check on the condition of 
the probe between primary calibrations which are made at a calibration facility on an annual 
basis. The readings in the attached graphs are derived from the average of 4 background and 
4 sleeve readings. 

 
12.1.4 Graphical representations of the data 

 
The daily sleeve calibration readings, corrected for background, are completed for all 

probes used. Representative graphs for probe S093 have been plotted and are shown below. 
The first graph shows the change in reading over the measurement period of some six 
months.  

 

  
Figure 16:  Calibration data of probe S093 for the period from Jan to July 2008 

 
As with all probes in use at Langer Heinrich S093 is used for both resource definition 

logging and production grade control. The probe was re-calibrated a number of times during 
the year particularly in January and again in July following periods of adverse drift in 
response. Other probes in use are similarly checked and re-calibrated as necessary.

12.2 Sampling 
 
12.2.1 XRF Assays 

 
A sample was collected through a cyclone for each meter drilled and split through a riffle-

splitter by the drill crew on the drill site to give a sample for assays of 3 - 4 kg. This sample 
was further split to produce two assay samples of about 300 to 500 g each, which were 
named as "A" and "B" samples.  Reject sample was used for geological logging, and then 
was disposed of in the old test pit area of Gencor's.

On the basis of the downhole logs, mineralised sections were selected from the boreholes 
in order to send them for XRF assay to Setpoint Laboratories, Isando, South Africa. The "A" 
samples were re-packed; and the new sample bags were tagged only with a serial number, 
one tag inside the bag and one outside the bag. Thus, borehole number and depth of the 
sample were not identifiable for the laboratory. 

 
Six sample batches were sent for assay. The assay included the pulverisation of the rock 

chip sample and the assay for U3O8 by pressed powder XRF. The total number of samples 
included 5 % quality samples. Blanks were inserted after every 20 normal samples and 
comprised dune sand collected south of Swakopmund consisting of well sorted quartz with 
minor iron oxide grain coatings. These dune sands assay below LLD (< 3 ppm U3O8). 
Duplicates were taken from every 20th normal samples. Duplicates were produced by taking 
"A" and "B" sample material together in order to get 33:33:33 split. The first split "A" was 
sent to the lab as a normal sample, the second split "B" was inserted at the end of each 
sample batch as a duplicate of "A". The last split "C" was kept as a reference sample and 
stored at the storage container. 

 
A comparison between XRF assay and radiometric eU3O8 shows that they do not correlate 

particularly well (Figure 19). This problem was already noted during the previous year's 
drilling programme and discussed in the corresponding drilling report by John Rich. A short 
summary is given below:   

 
1. The exact cylinder of rock which is ground up and removed for assay is the exact 

cylinder of rock which the down hole logger doesn't see. Thus, XRF assay and 
radiometric eU3O8 represent two completely separate samples of material. 

2. The RA logger and deconvolution process detects and uses gamma radiation 
emanating anywhere from an approximate 40cm radius. The geochemical assays 
can be considered to be "absolute", in other words they define exactly how much 
U is present in a sample. 

3. The mathematics upon which the deconvolution process is based (inaccuracies 
exist in applying a water factor, calculation for casing factor). 

4. Contamination almost certainly occurs due to drilling methodologies, e.g sample 
contamination in the cyclone, changing of sample bags, cleaning hoses etc. 

5. Inaccuracies in defining down hole depth. The RA operator took great care to 
position the probe so that hole "zero" equalled natural ground level, however the 
accuracy is probably no better than ± 10cm. 

 
To sum up, the potential difficulties outlined below suggest that on a meter by 

meter/sample by sample basis, correlation will always be poor, but as sample size increases 
and errors cancel, average eU3O8 will approach chemical U3O8.

13  Sample Preparat ion,  Analysis  and Security  
 

13.1 Assay Accuracy 
 

13.1.1 Chemical assays 
 
There is no information available to directly confirm the accuracy of XRF assays of Gencor 

samples from drill holes and test shafts.  The accuracy of those assays can only be inferred by 
comparison to later Acclaim and LHU drill sampling (Section 13.3.2, below).  Historic Gencor 
drilling now makes up only a small proportion of the total number of samples in the 
resource and are substantially confined to Details 4 and 6. 

 
Acclaim submitted blanks and certified reference materials with the RC drill samples sent 

for analysis by SGS Mineral Services.  Standards were sourced from Industrial Analytical 
(Pty) Ltd, Groenkloof, RSA.  Twenty-seven blank samples all returned U3O8 grades less than 
detection limit (3ppm).  Figure 20 to Figure 27 show run charts for assays of standards.  H&S 
considers the accuracy of SGS's assays satisfactory.  Assays for standards 6, 9 and 11 tend to 
report low across all batches but the errors are not considered significant in terms of resource 
estimation risk. 

 
Whilst in 2004 Paladin did not submit any standards with the assay batches ALS 

laboratory included a number of certified reference materials within the analysis batches.  
These standards were sourced from Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology ( 
Canmet ), National Research Centre for Certified Materials, China.  One Hundred and thirty 



 
 

 

57 

four blank samples all returned U3O8 grades less than detection limit (3ppm).  Figure 28 to 
Figure 30 show run charts for assays of standards.  H&S considers the accuracy of ALS's 
assays satisfactory; however the results from the BL-1 and NBL42-4 standards show a 
consistent under reporting of approximately 2% for batches 1-16, these errors are not 
considered significant in terms of resource estimation risk.

During the 2005 and 2006 drilling campaigns international standards were routinely 

submitted with assay batches. The results from these and the laboratory internal standards 
are detailed below. In most cases the standards returned values that were 1 to 2 % low,

appeared to suffer from a 3-5ppm background offset.  Figure 35 shows the performance of 
certified standard CUP-1 submitted by Paladin during the 2006 drilling program, this 
standard appears to be overestimated by approximately 4% although the precision of the 
analysis appears to be reasonable.   It should be noted that SetPoint Laboratories recommend 
a repeat analysis by fused disc for values above 1200ppm.

Figure 35: Assays of reference standard CUP-1 Submitted by Paladin 

 
During the 2007 and 2008 drilling campaigns international standards were routinely 

submitted with assay batches. The results from these and the laboratory internal standards are 
detailed below. In most cases the standards returned values that were 1 to 2 % low.  Figure 35 
shows the performance of certified standard CUP-1 submitted by Paladin during the 2008 
drilling program, this standard appears to be overestimated by approximately 6% although the 
precision of the analysis appears to be reasonable.

13.1.2 Accuracy of Grades from Radiometric Logging 

 
Acclaim reportedly calibrated scintillometers in a test-pit prior to down-hole logging of 

RC drill holes.  Determination of U3O8 grades from scintillometer counts requires a number 
of corrections including: 

 
• Deconvolution.  This is essentially a correction for the difference between the 

test-pit volume (or linear interval) of mineralisation used to calibrate the 
instrument and the volume (or linear intervals) of mineralisation comprising 
the source of down-hole counts. 

 

• Disequilbrium.  This correction accounts for the proportion of gamma rays 
that derive from decay of uranium versus the proportion that derive from 
decay of daughter products such as thorium, potassium and radon.  The 
correction is most important in deposits in which oxidation state varies.  This 
is almost certainly not the case at Langer Heinrich. 

 
It should be noted that the U3O8 grades derived from both Acclaim's and Paladin's down-

hole radiometric logs take the above corrections into account.  Considering the correlation of 
radiometric and XRF grades from both Acclaim and Paladin's work (Section 13.4.1, below) it 
appears likely that any change required to the disequilibrium corrections previously applied 
will have very little impact on resource estimates. Subsequent work by Barrett, based on all 
the assay and radiometric values produced to date indicate that disequilibrium is less than 
4% and this appears to be borne out by reconciliation of grade control data to processing 
plant production.  

 

13.2 Sampling Precision 
 

13.2.1 Gencor Percussion Drill Samples 
 
There are a large number of sample intervals from Gencor percussion drill holes for which 

XRF analyses are available for multiple sample splits but in many cases one of the samplings 
represents samples composited over several metres prior to submission for assay.  Instances 
where this was obviously the case were deleted for the sake of this comparison, leaving 142 
sample pairs.  Comparison of these assays captures the sampling and analytical error arising 
from the entire chain of sampling and analytical processes.

Figure 38 shows a scatter plot comparing assays of original sample splits and re-splits in 
single-metre sample intervals.  There is reasonable correlation between sample grades.  The 
quantile-quantile plot in Figure 39 compares the marginal histograms of the two sample 
populations and indicates that there is not significant bias to higher grades in either of the 
sample splits.

13.3 Assay Precision 
 
 

13.3.1 Gencor Percussion Drill Samples 
 
There are 166 native sample intervals from Gencor percussion drill holes with repeat XRF 

analyses available (Figure 43).  Comparison of these assays captures the sampling and 
analytical error arising from laboratory sub-sampling and analytical processes.  There is 
reasonable correlation between first and second analyses.  The usefulness of the comparison 
is reduced by the fact that, in some instances, initial analyses relate to composited sample 
intervals and repeat analyses to individual metre intervals.  In such instances the comparison 
is capturing sampling errors in addition to analytical errors.  There are no significant 
differences between the two sample populations (Figure 44).

13.4 Compatibility of XRF Assays and Radiometric Data 
 

13.4.1 XRF Assays and Radiometric Grades in Acclaim RC Drill Holes 
 
There are 1727 native sample intervals from Acclaim RC drill holes with U3O8 

determinations by both XRF analysis (above detection limit) and down-hole radiometric 
logging (Figure 48).  Grades of individual sample intervals vary considerably, as might be 
expected: the XRF analyses represent the grade of material extracted from holes whereas the 
radiometric logs represent the grade of material comprising the walls of drill holes.  Figure 
49 compares the marginal histograms of grades arising from the two samplings.  In high-
grade mineralisation there is a tendency for radiometric logging to report higher U3O8 grades 
but differences between the two grade populations are otherwise negligible.  The differences 
at high U3O8 grades may reflect a tendency, as indicated by assays of reference standards, for 
XRF assays to report slightly low.

Figure 49: U3O8 grades by XRF and by down-hole logging, Acclaim RC drill holes 

 
13.4.2 XRF Assays and Radiometric Grades in Paladin RC Drill Holes 

 
There are 100 Paladin RC drill holes with U3O8 determinations by both XRF analysis and 

down-hole radiometric logging (Figure 50).  Grades of individual sample intervals vary 
considerably, as might be expected: the XRF analyses represent the grade of material 
extracted from holes whereas the radiometric logs represent the grade of material 
comprising the walls of drill holes, as a consequence of this individual samples intervals 
have been composited to complete drill holes to minimise this local variability.  Figure 51 
compares the marginal histograms of grades arising from the two samplings.  In low-grade 
mineralisation there is a tendency for radiometric logging to report higher U3O8 grades. The 
differences at high U3O8 grades may reflect a tendency for XRF assays to report slightly low. 

 
Barrett Geophysical were engaged by Paladin to assess the relationship between the XRF 

values and those obtained by down hole radiometric logging.  It was their conclusion that 
the radiometric values contain an offset of 35ppm (most likely as a result of an elevated 
background) and appear, following regression analysis, to overstate the U3O8 values by 5%.   
This effect may be due to insufficient disequilibrium calibration factors being applied to the 
original radiometric values. 

 
 As a consequence all Paladin radiometric U3O8 values, after application of appropriate 

casing and water factors, used in the resource estimation were factored to 96% of their 
resultant value.  This in effect provides an allowance for formation and disequilibrium 
factors.

• Radiometric U3O8 grades for one-metre down-hole intervals above the water 
table in Acclaim drill holes. 

 
A search was conducted to find Acclaim samples lying within radii of 25mE x 25mN x 

0.49mRL of each Gencor sample.  The search located 527 nearest neighbour pairs separated 
by, on average, 22 metres that can be regarded as two independent samplings of 
approximately the same volume of mineralisation.  Figure 52 shows a quantile-quantile plot 
comparing the two sample grade populations.  In contrast to the comparison of XRF assays 
and radiometric logging in Acclaim RC drill holes, there is a tendency for Gencor's XRF 
analyses of percussion drill samples in higher-grade mineralisation to return higher U3O8 
grades than radiometric logs of nearby Acclaim RC drill holes.  This may indicate a tendency 
for a bias to higher grades in percussion drill samples.

grade populations.  Percussion drill samples show consistently higher grades than do nearby 
diamond core samples: either the percussion drill samples are biased high or the core 
samples are biased low.

13.5.2 Gencor Percussion Drill Samples and Test Shafts 
 
There are 32 test shafts that were excavated after a percussion drill hole had been drilled 

at the centre of each.  Figure 54 shows a scatter plot comparing paired one-metre samples in 
drill holes with bulk samples from the shafts, both populations being limited to samples 
from above the water table.  The scatter on the plot gives an indication of the short-scale 
spatial variation in U3O8 grades.  Figure 55 shows a quantile-quantile plot for the same data.  
As expected, considering the differences in volumes of the two sample types, percussion drill 
samples tend to be lower grades in low-grade mineralisation and higher in higher-grade 
mineralisation.  The variance of the population of grades from the test shaft samples is lower, 
an expression of the volume-variance effect.  Despite this, the means and medians of the two 
sample populations are very nearly equal, indicating that the percussion drill samples 
reliably represent the grade of mineralisation.

13.5.3 Gencor Diamond Core Samples and Test Shafts 
 
There are four diamond core holes over which test shafts were subsequently excavated.  

Pairing of samples grading over 15ppm U3O8 yields only 29 samples for comparison but the 
bulk samples from shafts report significantly higher U3O8 grades than do core samples.  
Considering the comparisons of U3O8 grades in percussion drill samples and test shafts and 
twinned percussion and diamond core holes, above, it appears likely that grades in diamond 
core samples are biased low.

13.6 Reliability of Gencor Wet Percussion Drill Samples 
 
The reliability of Gencor percussion drill samples that were probably drilled wet can be 

gauged by comparison with several other sources of sample grades: nearby diamond drill 
core samples, nearby test shafts and radiometric logs of nearby Paladin RC drill holes.  Only 
16 shaft samples are available below the interpreted water table level so no useful 
comparison can be had for wet percussion drill samples.  Of principal concern is the 
potential for down-hole sample contamination in percussion drill samples from below the 
water table. 

 
13.6.1 Wet Percussion Drill Samples and Radiometric Grades in Nearby Paladin RC Drill 

Holes 
 
A search was undertaken for nearest neighbour sample composites from: 
 

• Radiometric U3O8 grades for one-metre down-hole intervals below the water 
table and above basement in Paladin drill holes within Detail 1. 

 

• Gencor percussion drill sample composites from holes in Detail 1 other than 
close-spaced holes in the trial mine area, for which XRF assays are available, 
excluding samples from above the water table and those in basement rock 

 
The search located 451 pairs of sample composites within search radii 50mE x 50mN x 

1.0mRL, separated by, on average, 35 metres.  In low-grade mineralisation, wet percussion 
drill samples return U3O8 grades slightly higher than those from down-hole logging of 
nearby Paladin drill holes.  In high-grade mineralisation the trend is reversed.

13.6.2 Wet Percussion Drill Samples and Diamond Core Samples 
 
A search was undertaken to find sample composites from Gencor percussion drill holes 

lying within radii of 25mE x 25mN x 0.49mRL of each Gencor diamond drill sample using: 
 

• Gencor percussion drill sample composites from all areas other than close-
spaced holes in the trial mine area, for which XRF assays are available, 
excluding samples from above the water table and those in basement rock 

 

• Sample composites from Gencor diamond drill holes in all areas, for which 
XRF assays are available, excluding samples from above the water table and 
those in basement rock. 

 
The search located 172 nearest neighbour pairs separated by, on average, 2.3 metres.  

Figure 58 shows a quantile-quantile plot comparing the histograms of grades in the two 
sample populations.  Sample pairs are limited to relatively low-grade mineralisation and 
U3O8 grades in wet percussion drill samples are consistently higher than those in diamond 
core samples.  Considering that U3O8 grades from diamond core samples are probably biased 
low, it may be concluded that the wet percussion drill samples have not been grossly 
upgraded due to sample contamination.

Figure 58: U3O8 grades in wet Gencor percussion drill samples and twin diamond cores 

 
 

13.7 Conclusions 
 
XRF assays of Acclaim and Paladin RC drill samples are regarded as accurate and precise 

and they compare very closely to grades derived from down-hole radiometric logging of RC 
holes.  In high-grade mineralisation there is a tendency for radiometric logging to return 
slightly higher U3O8 grades.  The two types of grade determinations are considered 
compatible for the purposes of resource estimation. 

 
U3O8 grades in Gencor percussion drill samples from above the water table compare 

closely to grades of bulk samples from test shafts.  A small volume-variance effect is evident 
and differences in grades between individual paired samples from the same depth interval 
give an indication of the short-scale spatial continuity of U3O8 grades.  They also closely 
match grades derived from down-hole radiometric logging of nearby Acclaim and Paladin 
RC drill holes. 

 
Comparisons of U3O8 grades in Gencor percussion drill samples from below the water 

table with grades in nearby Paladin RC drill holes, and with twin diamond core holes, 
indicate that the wet samples may have suffered from some down-hole sample 
contamination.  There is, however, is no definitive evidence of significant upgrading of U3O8 
grades in the percussion drill samples. 

 
Comparisons of U3O8 grades in twinned Gencor percussion and diamond core holes, and 

twinned core holes and test shafts, indicate that grades in diamond core samples are 
probably biased low.  This possibly relates to loss of matrix material, the main host of 
mineralisation, during drilling and possibly during subsequent sub-sampling of core. 

 
Due to the extent of Paladin drilling from 2004 to date, the reliance on Gencor derived 

data has been very much reduced. This situation is expected to continue with additional 
infill and resource definition drilling planned to be undertaken in the future. A significant 
proportion of the original Gencor drilling was comprised of relatively short drill holes and 
these will be replaced by holes drilled to basement depth.

14  Data Verificat ion 
 

14.1 Data Sources and Database Compilation 
 

14.1.1 General 
 
The Gencor/Acclaim database acquired by Paladin consists of two parts: a large hard 

copy database containing numerous reports, paper maps and files, and a digital database 
which includes drill hole data, geochemical assays, downhole logging data, topographic 
contours, meteorological data and a photographic archive.  All materials located in the 
Swakopmund office and Acclaim's Perth offices were transferred to Paladin's office in Perth.   

 
Paladin reviewed every document and compiled a bibliography listing title and tabulated 

category, author, language, date and number of pages of each record.  The data were 
subdivided into nine principal categories: geology, geophysics, drilling, metallurgy, 
engineering/mining, environment, feasibility/planning summaries, corporate and 
photographs.  The completed bibliography contains 897 separate reports, memoranda, etc. in 
52 lever arch files. 

 
The primary author of this technical report has verified all the data referred to in this 

section. 
 

14.1.2 Digital Database Compilation 
 
Gencor 
 
The first digital database of the percussion drilling was compiled by Gencor in 1976.  

When Acclaim acquired the project this database was available only as printouts; the 
electronic version could not be found. 

 
Acclaim 
 
Acclaim endeavoured to digitise all availablee drill hole data.  Drill hole collars were 

entered from the Gencor computer printout and other survey sheets.  The drill hole survey 
commissioned by Acclaim in July 1999 had confirmed that Gencor drill holes had been 
correctly reported to within 0.5m.  The new survey data were entered for comparative 
purposes and the 1999 survey co-ordinates, where available, were used in preference to 
Gencor's data.  A total of 1889 drill holes, including Acclaim's drilling, were entered into this 
database. 

 
Assay data were compiled in sequence of data confidence with audit trail flags in the 

database to confirm validity.  The assay-certificated data were captured first with date and 
report number also recorded.  The Gencor printout assays that had no certificate numbering 
had to be confirmed as valid prior to inclusion into the new database.  The printout consisted 
of grades for regular one-metre down-hole intervals for only the percussion drilling.  Most of 
the diamond drill hole assay data utilised irregular intervals and have traceable assay 
certificates.  The Gencor computer printout of one-metre intervals was validated by Acclaim 
by cross-referencing the respective assay certificates and repeat assay certificates. 

 
A limited database of scintillometer readings from the collected drill samples and a very 

limited repeat assay database were also compiled and merged with the original assay 



 
 

 

79 

database.  Sample data from infill percussion drilling in the trial mining areas, and U3O8 
grades for blast holes drilled in the mega-trench, were also captured, with assays cross-
referenced to assay certificates. 

 
Paladin 
 
Paladin, in conjunction with H&S, found that the database collated by Acclaim contained 

numerous inconsistencies and inaccuracies that had significantly affected their resource 
estimates.  Some of these inconsistencies and inaccuracies resulted from Gencor's use of local 
grids, each with differing drill hole name and numbering systems along the 15 kilometre 
strike length of the deposit.  When Gencor digitised the drill hole data into a uniform global 
grid in 1976 some of the local grid drill hole names were retained, while some had to be 
changed because of the limitations of computer programs in use at that time.  This resulted 
in some drill holes having two different drill hole names. Further, in many instances, Gencor 
did not differentiate between twinned holes, both often having the same identifier name 
although one may have been a diamond and the other a percussion hole.  Only some of these 
"double" holes were removed by Acclaim when compiling their database.  Also most holes 
without intersections greater than 100ppm U3O8 were not recorded in the Gencor database 
and this practice was followed by Acclaim.  Both Gencor and Acclaim failed to enter < (less 
than) values as such in their respective databases, recording some values as 0 (zero) and 
others as 10 or 30ppm depending on the detection limit.  Also, drill hole intervals that had 
obviously been assayed as composite samples were listed by Acclaim as consecutive one-
metre sample intervals with the same U3O8 grade.  

 
Corrections and validation by Paladin have included: 
 

• Plotting drill holes on stacked sections to locate obvious errors and 
duplications; 

• Checks of drill hole numbers in relation to their locations to ensure that 
transposition from Gencor local grid co-ordinates to global grid co-ordinates 
was correct; 

• Checks of drill hole location against hardcopy Gencor maps and cross-
sections, identifying missing drill holes; 

• Checking easting, northing and elevation entries against Gencor computer 
printouts; 

• Cross-referencing updated hole names to previous Gencor hole names where 
consolidation of the database had necessitated changes; 

• Checks of hardcopy files and re-entry of correct down-hole sample intervals 
and U3O8 assays, cross-referenced to assay certificates where available; 

• Suffixing of diamond drill holes (D), twin percussion drill holes (T) and 
exploration shafts (P); and 

• Entry of lithological logs for the 396 holes for which logging is available. 
 
 
The work resulted in the removal of 181 duplicated drill holes from the database.  

Location co-ordinates for over 80 drill holes were corrected and 135 missing drill holes were 
added.  Paladin have incorporated all the recent drilling into this database which now 
includes 2,234, percussion exploration drill holes and 72 diamond drill holes for a total of 
2,306 exploration drill holes.  All 128 corner holes drilled to establish the exploration shafts 
were found to be mis-located in relation to the centre holes and these were corrected.  Data 
for the 32 exploration shafts and 253 infill and blast holes in the trial mining area were added 
to the main drill hole collar file.

14.1.3 Drill Hole Collar Locations 

 
Locations of drill hole collars and test shafts were checked by independent licensed 

surveyors in 1999 and are believed to be reliable (Section 14.1.2, above).  In 2004 H&S 
geologist David Princep walked a substantial number of Gencor drill traverses and located 
about eight per cent of drill hole collars, with another eight per cent of hole locations marked 
by pegs but with no visible remnant collars.  Collars of several holes not presently 
incorporated into the digital database were also located.  H&S considered that the 
uncaptured drill holes are unlikely to significantly affect the resource estimates.  About 60 
per cent of Acclaim RC drill hole collars were located in the field by H&S. 

 
All drill holes from the 2005 and 2006 drilling campaign were surveyed by contract 

licensed surveyor and those drilled in 2007 and 2008 for this resource update were surveyed 
by the mine site surveyor at both set out and post drilling. The average variation between set 
out and drilled position was 2.7m with the largest displacement being 15.22m for 
topographic reasons. 

 
14.1.4 Sample and Assay Information 

 
Sample and assay data were provided in digital form by Paladin.  H&S had previously 

cross-checked about 25 per cent of Gencor sample intervals and 60 per cent of Acclaim 
sample intervals in the digital database to hardcopy assay certificates. 

 
Paladin has used a series of alphabetical codes in the drill hole collar and assay files to 

track drill hole and sample type.  H&S initially added an equivalent series of numeric codes 
(Table 6) so that sample types could be tracked through the down-hole compositing process. 

 
Similarly, sample intervals in the Paladin database contain codes describing the source of 

U3O8 grades.  A series of numeric codes was added (Table 7) in order that this information 
could also be carried through the compositing process.

14.1.5 Geological Mapping and Logs 
 
A good geological base map compiled at 1:40,000 scale by Gencor is available in hardcopy 

form.  The map shows bedrock lithologies, the extents of valley-fill sediments, calcrete 
terraces and recent alluvium.  The mapped limits of valley-fill sediments were used by 
Paladin geologists to aid interpretation of the basement-sediment interface throughout the 
resource area. 

 
Drill hole logs are available for 1,574 holes.  Paladin has simplified lithological 

descriptions into a series of concatenated codes as shown in Table 8.

14.1.6 Topography 
 
A triangulated topographic surface was supplied in dxf format by Paladin Resources.  

That surface has been constructed using photogrammetry based on a low-level survey flown 
in 2004.  Ground checks by a licensed surveyor have indicated that the original work is 
reliable (Section 14.1.2, above) 

 
14.1.7 Valley Sediments Limits 

 
The basement topography was digitised on 50m North – South sections throughout the 

entire length of the deposit. In areas on denser drill spacing the section spacing was reduced 
to 12.5m which has allowed a much more detailed sub surface topography to be produced. 
The digitised basement sections were formed into a DTM which was then used to remove 
material from the final resource model as the basement is essentially unmineralised. 

 
14.1.8 Domains 

 
Checks on the drilling data indicated that the sample information could be separated into 

a number of domains based around the presence of mineralisation. There appears to be an 
upper essentially barren zone which may be composed of recent alluvium or unmineralised 
calcrete. This zone frequently extends across the entire width of the ore body. The main 
mineralisiation, which may form multiple horizontal layers, is underlain by significant 
thicknesses of barren material before the basement is encountered. This lower barren zone 
may or may not cover the width of the ore body on any particular section.  Upper and lower 
mineralisation surfaces were digitised on 50m North – South sections and DTM's formed 
from the digitised strings. These upper and lower DTM's were then used to code the sample 
data set and these were then subsequently used in the resource estimation. 

 
14.1.9 Bulk Density 

 
During mining of the mega-trench and trial pit Gencor weighed a substantial proportion 

of trucks.  The surveyed volumes of the excavations, truck counts and truck weights yielded 
an average bulk density estimate of 2.1g/cc, varying from 1.95g/cc for clay through to 
2.25g/cc for carbonate-cemented sediments. 

 
During subsequent screening and pilot plant operations Gencor determined densities on 

16 finely ground samples, resulting in an average wet density of 2.56g/cc.  Densities were 
also measured on nine lump rock samples, yielding an average dry density of 2.38g/cc. 

 
Acclaim attempted to improve the bulk density database by down-hole logging of 10 RC 

drill holes using a gamma-gamma probe with a Ce134 active isotope source to log density.  
The system reads "formation densities" (i.e., pore space is seen as pore space) and, in dry 
conditions, normally yields results that are directly comparable to true rock bulk density.  
The logging yielded average bulk densities of 2.28g/cc for material above the water table 
and 2.51 below the water table.  Using only sections with U3O8 grades of less than 100ppm 
(higher uranium concentrations can interfere with the method), average density was 2.4g/cc 
above the water table and 2.5 below. 

 



 
 

 

83 

Previous resource models have used a bulk density of 2.1g/cc however extensive work in 
the pit by Langer Heinrich employees, as well as volume/tonnage reconciliations between 
mined volumes and trucked tonnages (all mining trucks being fitted with load cells) 
indicates that a bulk density of 2.4g/cc is a more appropriate figure to use. As a consequence 
this resource estimate will use 2.4g/cc for conversion from volume to tonnes. Evidence 
suggests that there may be a correlation between grade and bulk density with waste areas 
being associated with lower densities however at this time these is insufficient data to model 
the distribution of bulk density.

16  Mineral  Processing and Metallurgical  Test ing 
 
Processing flowsheet development and metallurgical testing programme as part of the 

bankable feasibility study has been managed by GRD Minproc.  The following summary has 
been extracted from GRD Minproc's report for the LHU bankable feasibility study (GRD 
Minproc, 2005). Additional recent work undertaken by Langer Heinrich is detailed in Section 
16.12 

 
 

16.1 Summary 
 
Testwork has been completed at Mintek in Randburg, South Africa. The Langer Heinrich 

ore shows positive beneficiation and treatment characteristics. Batch testwork on the overall 
process has resulted in high quality U3O8 production and favourable processing parameters. 

 
The presence in the ores of competent siliceous rock grading low in uranium (U) and 

vanadium (V) is a primary factor of the beneficiation process. Simple size separation allows 
the coarse uneconomic grade component of the feed ore to be rejected, and a fine high grade 
economic component to be recovered. 

 
The testwork data available for study design was essentially based on samples derived 

from stockpiled crushed material on site, arising from previous testwork. Additional 
testwork was conducted with "below the water-table" material to verify that developed 
design parameters were also applicable to this material. Further work was conducted to 
establish the operating performance with feed of highly varying characteristics. 

 
The selected circuit, which is very similar to the original Gencor pilot plant, is designed to 

achieve staged classification and upgrading of primary uranium and secondary vanadium 
values, while minimising any valuable losses to the reject stream.  The plant comprises the 
following circuits: 

 
•  primary crushing; 
•  drum scrubbing; 
•  coarse screening; 
•  primary cyclone classification; 
•  attritioning; 
•  secondary classification; 
•  de-sliming; 
•  pre-leach thickening; 
•  leaching; 
•  counter-current-decantation; 
•  ion exchange; 
•  uranium precipitation; 
•  uranium calcining and product handling, and 
•  vanadium precipitation and disposal. 
 
The objectives of the process plant can be summarised as: 
 
•  optimise the upgrading and recovery of uranium, as well as vanadium, into a reduced 

mass for further processing; 



 
 

 

86 

•  maintain careful pH control in the leach circuit to minimise the carbonate 
consumption, and 

•  maintain acceptable chloride and sulphate levels in the ion exchange solutions through 
intermittent circuit bleeding. 

 
On the basis of testwork results and data already available, GRD Minproc has developed 

a flowsheet design and equipment selection for a "design ore", which is considered to be a 
typical ore. The circuit is designed to meet the objective of producing 1 100 t/a U3O8. In 
addition, the base case design was developed using 95% availability and 95% utilisation, 
resulting in ±7 900 operating hours per annum. 

 
For this BFS, testwork was carried out by Mintek and specialist liquid-solid equipment 

vendors to establish or confirm process parameters.  This work encompassed:  
 
•  Screening 
•  Scrubbing 
•  Attritioning 
•  Viscosity testing 
•  Leaching 
•  Direct precipitation 
•  Filtration/settling 
•  Ion exchange 
•  U3O8 and vanadium precipitation 
 
The ore is amenable to an alkaline leach treatment circuit with an indicated overall 

uranium recovery in excess of 90%.  Testwork data and a review with Mintek personnel, 
yielded the following indicative plant recovery factors.  The vanadium generally upgrades in 
line with uranium, though at a slightly lower percentage.  

 
•  Feed preparation recovery 95.1% 
•  Leach Efficiency 96.0% 
•  Ion exchange recovery 99.5% 
•  Precipitation recovery 99.8% 
•  Overall uranium recovery to final product 89.9% 
 
The vanadium generally upgrades in line with uranium, though at a slightly lower 
percentage. Table 9 lists the main plant schedule data used in the development of 
the process. 
 
Aspen simulation software was used to provide an indication of the degree of impurity 

build-up in the re-circulating streams. Although the results of this work have not yet been 
finalised, initial observations are:  

 
•  The chloride equilibrium concentration is ±0.05 mole/dm³, while the naturally 

•  The chloride equilibrium concentration is ±0.05 mole/dm³, while the naturally arising 
concentration is 0.012 mole/dm³. Sensitivity tests conducted indicate a small drop in 
the uranium equilibrium loading capacity, from ±37 g/dm³ to ±32 g/dm³. This is still 
within acceptable limits. 

•  The sulphate reaches an equilibrium value of ±0.2 mole/dm³. This is not within 
acceptable limits. 



 
 

 

87 

•  The model provides a good indication of the impurity build-up, as well as carbonate 
losses/requirements and the water/solution balance. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 9 Plant Schedule Data for The Langer Heinrich Project 

 
 
There are a few process issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed in the 
completed testwork. These items, as listed below, will be addressed as part of the ongoing 
upfront engineering activities: 
 

•  The choice of equipment selected for the primary crushers needs to be confirmed. There is 
presently a concern with the perceived low availability of the mineral sizers. The more 
conventional use of a jaw crusher will be investigated to minimise this potential problem. 

•  The samples used in the testwork conducted to date are believed to be representative. 
There is, however, still some uncertainty with regards to the amount of fine material that 
could be encountered intermittently from the mining operation. Although this can 
potentially be managed by ROM blending, it is recommended that further classification 
work be conducted on site to confirm present data. 

• At present there is some concern about the data used to quantify the carbonate balance 
and consumption. Although, the initial results of the Aspen simulation appear to confirm 
the assumption made in the process development, the quantities of reagent consumed 
justifies the need for further investigation into this matter. 

•  The vanadium recoveries achieved to date have been rather poor and this potential 
revenue source is presently being mixed in with the tailings stream. In light of the current 
vanadium price, alternative ways of recovering the vanadium, without aggravating 
sodium carbonate losses, are being investigated. 

•  The Aspen results suggest that the potential for the build-up of unacceptable levels of 
sulphates does exist within the existing vanadium precipitation circuit. It is suggested that 
locked cycle tests be conducted to better understand the extent of this effect. Given that 
this circuit may be replaced (see above), this may not be required. 

•  Viscosities are very high around the leach and CCD circuit, which precludes the use of 
conventional centrifugal pumps. The various pumping circuits, especially the tailings 
system, will be reviewed by specialist pump suppliers.

16.2 Introduction 
 
Gencor in late 1970's developed what appeared to be a viable Langer Heinrich uranium 

process.   However, the basis for this design was testwork conducted some 25-30 years ago. It 
was believed that, in certain areas, the technology has changed significantly and there were 
several highlighted problem areas that needed further investigation. With this in mind, a test 
schedule was developed, both to address the previous shortcomings and to improve the 
process. The testwork started in mid-2004 and was concluded during the first quarter of 
2005. 

 
 

16.3 Metallurgical Test Programmes and Results 
 
LHUPL contracted Mintek to conduct a series of testwork campaigns in order to define a 

viable uranium processing route for the Langer Heinrich project. The original process route 
developed closely followed the one generated by Gencor. However, as results from the 
testwork started to become available, there were some significant changes implemented to 
the circuit.  

 
The following is a list of testwork conducted at Mintek followed by the primary results; 
 
•  Screening and assaying 
•  Wet scrubbing 
•  Classification and assaying 
•  Attritioning and assaying 
•  Leaching 
•  Direct precipitation 
•  Leachate filtration 
•  Viscosity measurements 
•  Leachate thickening 
•  Ion exchange (adsorption, elution and re-generation) 
•  Uranium precipitation 
•  Vanadium precipitation 
 
Very limited amount of crushing is required as the valuables are primarily found in the 

calcrete matrix holding the agglomerates together. Consequently, a significant effort was 
made to minimise the degree of size reduction, whilst at the same time maximising the 
amount of barren oversize material. Scrubbing proved to be highly successful with over 80% 
of uranium reporting to the -500 µm size fraction after 6 minutes in the scrubber. 

 
Agglomerates were still visible after 10 minutes of scrubbing and assays indicated higher 

than acceptable uranium values. It was, consequently, decided to attrition this material.  This 
proved to be successful, with both the 8 x 3.35 mm and the 3.35 x 0.5 mm fraction achieving 
acceptable barren uranium assays (≤100 ppm), the latter albeit at a higher energy input. The 
total uranium recovery across the feed preparation circuit is ±95% in <40% of the original 
mass. 

 
Leaching at 75°C, for >30 hours, 25% solids (w/w) and ±40 g/L carbonate achieved a 

uranium recovery >96%. The approach not to employ too much size reduction was further 
supported by leach testwork conducted, where reducing the topsize to -200 µm provided no 



 
 

 

89 

benefits compared with a -500 µm topsize. To reduce power requirements, the leach slurry is 
heated through heat exchangers with water in closed circuit. Some of the heat from the leach 
product is recovered through a preheating circuit. Further recovery might be possible at 
slightly higher temperatures, but this will have to be weighed up against the increased cost 
of heating the slurry. 

 
The original intention was always to filter the leach product. Elevated viscosities 

encountered during leaching, however, meant that the envisaged filter area requirements 
would exceed 1 000 m², whilst failing to provide a competent dry product. It was decided, 
after conducting challenging but successful settling tests, that a conventional countercurrent 
decantation (CCD) circuit would be employed. Thickener underflows with >40% solids 
(w/w) were achieved with flocculant dosages ≤140 g/t solids feed and expected wash 
efficiencies of >98%. 

 
Ion exchange proved to be very successful, using a strong basic resin, even at ambient 

temperature (±40°C), with >99% uranium recoveries. The uranium adsorbs very rapidly on 
the resin and is efficiently stripped using sodium chloride. To ensure adequate chloride 
removal from the resin, before re-use in the adsorption cycle, the resin is regenerated using 
sodium carbonate. 

 
Uranium is precipitated very effectively (>99.8%) by firstly adding sulphuric acid, to 

reduce the pH to ±2.0, then adding hydrogen peroxide and, finally, elevating the pH to ±5.0 
with sodium hydroxide.  

 
Vanadium, unexpectedly, did not co-adsorb on the resin with the uranium. Instead, it 

reported to the barren solution stream. It was hoped that the vanadium could be recovered 
in a saleable form to off-set some of the operating costs, but the system currently in place 
precipitates the vanadium directly from the solution through the addition of ferrous 
sulphate. Recoveries in the range 60-70% are achieved; the vanadium precipitate is combined 
with the tails and disposed of in the tails dam. 

 
In addition to the above, Aspen simulation software was used to provide an indication of 

the degree of impurity build-up in the re-circulating streams. Although the results of this 
work have not yet been finalised, initial observations are: 

 
• The chloride equilibrium concentration is ±0.05 mole/dm³, while the naturally arising 

concentration is 0.012 mole/dm³. Sensitivity tests conducted indicate a small drop in 
the uranium equilibrium loading capacity, from ±37 g/dm³ to ±32 g/dm³. This is still 
within acceptable limits. 

• The sulphate reaches an equilibrium value of ±0.2 mole/dm³. This is not within 
acceptable limits. 

• The model provides a good indication of the impurity build-up, as well as carbonate 
losses/requirements and the water/solution balance. Some areas requiring further 
work prior to the commencement of project execution have been identified. These are 
listed in no particular order below and are discussed in greater detail below: 

• Quantify the carbonate balance across the leach and Ion exchange circuits. 

• Develop a vanadium recovery circuit that produces a saleable product. 

• The aforementioned is linked to ensuring that sulphate levels in the recycled water are 
kept within an acceptable level. 



 
 

 

90 

• Further investigate leach and CCD circuit inter-stage slimes pumping, with special 
attention to the tails removal system. 

• Investigate the possible benefits of using viscosity modifiers in the tails removal system 
and the CCD circuit (possibly enabling filtration of the leach product). 

• The surprisingly rapid uranium adsorption implies that the current Ion exchange 
system can be significantly improved. 

 
 

16.4 Historical Testwork and Results 
 

16.4.1 Introduction 
 
Reports detailing previous metallurgical testwork undertaken by Gencor during 1975-

1981 were reviewed. Similarly, a report prepared by Kaiser Ltd, (an internationally and 
highly respected Process Engineering Company) in Perth Australia, which reflected then 
current practices within the Uranium Industry, (particularly in deposits similar to Langer 
Heinrich) was reviewed by LTA Process Engineering (LTA), based in Randburg, South 
Africa. In addition further testwork was conducted at Mintek in August-October 1999.   

 
Mineralogical investigation of Langer Heinrich ore shows that uranium is present only as 

the mineral carnotite (a potassium uranyl-vanadate). Carnotite is interstitial to the clastic 
grains, generally as fine-grained flakes, though larger blebs, clumps and open-space coatings 
are present. Carnotite occurs preferentially in less cemented sections of the ore, but shows no 
relationship to any rock type. It does not occur within any clasts, whether boulder, sand or 
silt size. However, the carnotite often forms high-grade coatings on clasts of any size, and 
occasionally it occurs in cracks within large clasts. The high CaCO3 of the sedimentary 
material meant that an alkaline leach step was an integral part of all process routes 
investigated in previous work. 

 
 

16.4.2 Gencor Work 
 
Gencor previously held the Langer Heinrich mineral rights and conducted extensive 

metallurgical testwork at its Group Laboratories West in Krugersdorp. It ran a large scale 
pilot plant over the period 1978-80 and treated some 3 000 t of material, choosing the route of 
alkaline atmospheric leaching followed by Ion exchange. The systems investigated included 
the following, which formed the foundation for the preferred process route; 

 
• Dry crushing to -3.0 mm; 

• hot alkaline leach (including product screw classifier and hydro-cyclone classification); 
followed by 

• coarse sand (+35 mesh) washing on dewatering screen; 

• fine sand washing in counter-current cycloning plant; 

• slime washing in counter-current decantation circuit; 

• sludge dewatering in centrifuge; 

• counter-current Ion exchange; 

• uranium and vanadium precipitation, and 

• product drying. 



 
 

 

91 

 

 
In addition to the above, liquid/solid separation of the leach slurries by means of a 

double belt filter press and recovery of uranium from pregnant solution by direct 
precipitation with sodium hydroxide were investigated. Other "fringe" options, including 
heap leaching, were also studied, but these are not further discussed due to poor results. 
Below follows a brief non-exhaustive summary of the results derived from the 
comprehensive testwork campaign. 

 
16.4.2.1 Comminution 

 
This area was not satisfactorily defined. Fine crushing by impact milling was ruled out 

due to high wear rates and high fines generation. Upgrading the ore by scalping the hard 
coarse fraction after fine crushing achieved an upgrade factor of only 1.04 with an associated 
uranium loss of 1.3%. In conclusion, the recommendation was to wet mill the material to -3.0 
mm.  

 
Further milling and scrubbing tests showed that fully-autogenous milling can produce a 

-3.3 mm product, which simulates a mill with a diameter of 4.3 m.  It is estimated that the 
gross power consumption would be 2.25 kWh/t.  It is then possible to produce a barren 3.3 x 
0.4 mm fraction by scrubbing in the presence of +3.3 mm particles. Semiautogenous milling 
would require 8.1 kWh/t. 

 
Another milling exercise, by M. Moys, showed that the Langer Heinrich material can 

successfully be ground to -2.0 mm by fully-autogenous milling, again with a power 
requirement in the order of 2.5 kWh/t. 

 
16.4.2.2 Gravity Separation 

 
The range of specific gravity of the ore is rather narrow, lying between 2.5-2.9, particularly 

in the range 2.6-2.7. However, it was not expected to achieve uranium recoveries in excess of 
80%. No further work of this nature was conducted. Wet High-Intensity Magnetic Separation 
It was quickly determined that the Langer Heinrich ore is not amenable to WHIMS. 

 
16.4.2.3 Hot Alkaline Leaching 

 
The pilot plant demonstrated that the Langer Heinrich material could be leached in a 

series of 8 open leach tanks to achieve 95% uranium dissolution.  The conditions required 
were 80-83°C leach temperature, 40-45 g/L sodium carbonate in the leach discharge liquor 
and at least 21 hours residence time.  Up to 16 kg of sodium carbonate per tonne ore leached 
was consumed in the leach process, considerably more than expected from laboratory batch 
testwork.  Steam consumption averaged 289 kg/t of ore treated and successful leaching was 
conducted on slurries with solids contents >36% solids (w/w). 

 
  



 
 

 

92 

16.4.2.4 Sand/Slime Separation and Sand Washing 
 
In short, the proposed process looked at using a screw classifier to produce a coarse and a 

fine fraction, the fine fraction being pumped through a classifying cyclone, the cyclone 
underflow would be combined with the screw classifier coarse material and discharged onto 
a dewatering screen. The screen oversize would be barren material, any screen undersize 
material would report back to the screw classifier. The cyclone overflow would pass over a 
safety screen (sieve bend), any oversize material reporting to the dewatering screen and the 
undersize being sent to the counter-current decantation circuit.  This process proved 
satisfactory and was recommended for any future work. 

 
16.4.2.5 Counter-Current Decantation 

 
Major problems where encountered with the initial operation of underflow pumps due to 

elevated viscosities encountered at solids contents in the range 20-25% by mass. This was 
overcome by changing to variable speed mono pumps. The feed solids should be kept below 
4% by mass, even if this means circulating the overflow. The solids handling capacity was 
40-50 kg/h/m², which is expected to be improved by installing picket rakes. 

 
16.4.2.6 Filtration 

 
Leach discharge was effectively dewatered by a pressure filter, producing a filter cake 

with a final moisture content of <23% by mass. The flocculant dosage requirement lying in 
the range 250-300 g/t feed. Washing efficiencies were suspect due to difficulty of filtering 
washed and repulped filter cake. Consequently, CCD was the preferred method of slimes 
removal, especially in view of several lengthy downtime periods encountered through filter 
cloth failures. 

 
16.4.2.7 Continuous Ion Exchange 

 
CIX was found to be a suitable system for concentrating uranium, with no signs of 

permanent poisoning after six months in use. Silica pick-up was found to be minimal at 1.5%, 
but inefficient elution can lead to a build-up of vanadium, which would require an acid 
treatment for its removal. The most efficient eluant found was 1 M sodium chloride and, to 
keep chloride build-up to a minimum, it was recommended to regenerate the resin by 
passing sodium bicarbonate through the elution column. 

 
16.4.2.8 Uranium Precipitation 

 
Conventional ammonia precipitation did not produce a yellow cake compliant with 

specifications, although a very high uranium recovery was achieved at 99.95%. Hydrogen 
peroxide precipitation, on the other hand, yielded a product of an acceptable grade, but only 
when treating a reasonably concentrated eluate, i.e. in the region of 8 g/L uranium. 

 
16.4.2.9 Direct Precipitation 

 
Direct precipitation was not successful, primarily attributed to high carbonate values and 

low uranium values in the pregnant solution. In addition, the conclusion was that direct 
precipitation would be more expensive than CIX and was not further considered.

16.4.3 LTA Work 
 
Acclaim Uranium NL (Acclaim), an Australian based company, purchased the mineral 

rights to the Langer Heinrich uranium deposit in Namibia. It then set up a company called 
Langer Heinrich (Pty) Ltd (LHUPL) to exploit it. This was subject to favourable findings of a 
planned feasibility study. Mintek was asked by Acclaim to undertake laboratory scoping 
(scouting) tests in support of an up-front pre-feasibility study, put together by LTA.  The 
geology and extent of this major deposit were considered to be well established, with 
previous work having shown that carnotite tends to concentrate in the fines, and that all 
gangue materials – sands, grits, pebbles and boulders – are barren.  

 
Acclaim was fully aware of the extensive work conducted by Gencor and other tests done 

on carnotite deposits in Australia where calcrete was present. In discussions with Mintek, 
Acclaim made it clear that they were looking for innovative technology to overcome the 
problems experienced by previous workers with this type of ore. In short, LTA's objective 
was to economically produce yellowcake acceptable as feedstock to the nuclear fuel 
enrichment industry. The basic process route chosen consisted of: 

 
• a comminution stage; 
• an alkaline pressure leach; 
• liquor preparation; 
• yellowcake precipitation, and 
• a drying stage. 
 
This basic process was adopted with some recommendations for improvement by further 
testwork.  The proposed comminution section is a conventional process, consisting of 

primary crushing by toothed roll crusher, secondary crushing by cone crusher and grinding 
of crushed ore by ball milling and classification of the ore slurry by hydrocyclones. The 
pressure leach stage is carried out by heating the slurry to 150°C, utilising steam heat 
exchangers, followed by an accelerated leach stage. The slurry is then cooled and 
depressurised, with the resulting steam being recovered using flash vessels. 

  
The liquor preparation stage separates the solids from the leach liquor by using a CCD 

process. Because of the relatively high clay content of the ore and the slow settling 
characteristics thereof, eight stages of high rate thickeners are needed to wash the leached 
ore effectively. 

 
In the precipitation stage, the leach liquor is treated with sulphuric acid to break down the 

soluble complexes of uranium. The solution is then precipitated using hydrogen peroxide to 
produce yellow uranyl peroxide, which is then dewatered and calcined before packaging 
and shipment.  

 
In support of the idea that a significant degree of upgrading can be achieved by screening, 

a preliminary size grading analysis was carried out on the -10 mm "as received" material. 
This showed an increase in uranium and calcite content at lower particle sizes, 55% of the 
uranium and 67% of the calcite reporting in the 33% of the mass obtained below 150 µm. 

 
Massive samples of conglomerate and grits were also received and examination showed 

high Bond rod work indices of 20.66 kWh/t and 21.11 kWh/t respectively. The rest of the 
testwork was performed on minus 300 µm material. 



 
 

 

94

The testwork was done on the Mintek Bond rod mill test rig as used for predicting rod 
mill power requirements. Materials used were Types C and D, consisting of grits and 
conglomerates. Results are shown in Table 10. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 10: Langer Heinrich Ores (Types C and D); Bond Rod Work Index Testwork 
 
 
The figures of 21-22 kWh/t are higher than expected. This was thought to be due to the 

small limiting screen size chosen by the client, and the fact that calcite and clay material are 
not really suitable for dry milling The sodium carbonate or alkaline pressure leach route was 
examined, and especially the effect of leach conditions - notably temperature - on the 
amenability of the leached pulp to downstream liquid/solid separation.  

 

In this connection, an important finding was that, at a leaching temperature of 230 οC and 
above, the leached pulp exhibited much improved settling and filtration characteristics, but 
the uranium dissolution and reagent consumption suffered drastically. This can be explained 
by the formation of zeolites, which have the ability to absorb large ions. Confirmation of this 
will be possible only with extensive SEM studies. Leaching at temperatures at or above 
230 οC is, therefore, not recommended. 

 
The pressure leach tests were done with a starting solids concentration of 30% (m/m).  

The effect of sodium carbonate reagent type (Analar and Sappi Black Ash), reagent 
concentration (30 and 50 g/L), water type (Rand Water Board and Langer Heinrich derived 

water), leach temperature and duration ( 120 to 250 οC, 0 to 60 minutes at target temperature) 
on uranium dissolution. Reagent consumption and leached pulp settling characteristics were 
variously observed and are briefly discussed.  

 
At temperatures in the range 150 to 200 οC, and at sodium carbonate concentrations as low 

as 30 g/L, uranium dissolution in excess of 95 % can be achieved in the pressure reactor 
within 30 minutes. The sodium carbonate chemically consumed in the leach was less 
quantifiable. In the case of the lower temperatures tested, it varied from an apparent 1.53 

kg/t at 120 οC to 7.25 kg/t at 150 οC and up to 8.67 kg/t at 200 οC.  In summary: 
 

• At temperatures in the range 150 to 200 οC, and at sodium carbonate concentrations as 
low as 30 g/L, uranium dissolution in excess of 95 % can be achieved by pressure 
leaching within 30 minutes. For costing purposes, the sodium carbonate chemically 
consumed in the leach may be taken as 7.25 kg/t. 

• Leaching at temperatures above 230 οC has a profound effect on the uranium 
dissolution, sodium carbonate consumption and the settling characteristics of the 
leached pulp. The benefits gained in the latter are negated by the drastic reduction in 
uranium dissolution and the large increase in reagent consumption. 

• The use of local Langer Heinrich water on site will give rise to higher reagent 
consumption. 



 
 

 

95 

• There seems to be no advantage in increasing the start reagent concentration above 30 
g/L. 

 

The suppliers of thickening and filtration equipment were provided with leached pulp 

prepared in Mintek's 200 L pressure reactor at 150 οC. Leach start conditions were 30 % 
solids, -300 mm material, 30 g/L of sodium carbonate and a residence time of 30 minutes 
once the target temperature was reached. Flocculant suppliers tested the leached pulp and 
recommended Magnafloc 333 as a settling aid at a dosage rate of 50 g/t solids. The dosage 
rate for pulp prior to leaching was 70 g/t solids of Magnafloc 156. 

 
In addition, it was again demonstrated that it is possible to use a flotation process to 

separate the carbonate and silica fraction in the Larger-Heinrich ore. For a 28% mass removal 
to the concentrate, 82% of the carbonate and 38% of the uranium reported to this fraction. 
The carbonate grade of the flotation tails was thus reduced from 10% in the feed to 2.4%. The 
acid consumptions predicted on the basis of the CaCO3 equivalent could be reduced from 
168 kg/t to 41 kg/t. It appears that it is important to use a frother as part of the reagent suite. 
However, this approach would necessitate two separate circuits, one alkaline and one 
conventional acidic, which would have significant impact on the capital cost, operating cost 
and would introduce further complexity to the process. This option was not further 
investigated. 

 
 
 

16.5 Process Development 
 

16.5.1 Introduction 
 
The beneficiation plant has been designed based primarily on recent (2004-2005) 

metallurgical testwork conducted at Mintek together with historical mineralogical reports 
and previous work conducted by LTA and Gencor.  The uranium mineralisation is 
associated with calcrete and occurs within valley-fill fluvial sediments in an extensive 
tertiary palaeodrainage system. It occurs in the form of carnotite which is a secondary 
oxidised uranium and vanadium mineral. 

 
The ore lends itself to beneficiation, i.e. upgrading of both uranium and vanadium into a 

smaller mass, before leaching. The calcrete matrix is an acid consumer and subsequently the 
leach is of the alkaline type.  Scrubbing and attritioning followed by simple size classification 
allows a coarse barren fraction to be rejected, and a fine high grade fraction to be recovered 
for further processing. 

 
The selected circuit is designed to upgrade primarily the uranium whilst minimizing 

valuable losses to the reject streams. The presence of aluminium in the ore is a complicating 
factor. This element, under elevated temperatures, appears to form aluminium silicate which 
gives rise to elevated viscosities during leaching, and makes subsequent dewatering more 
difficult. 

 
The objectives of the beneficiation plant can be summarised as follows: 
 
• Optimum upgrade and recovery of uranium (and to a lesser extent vanadium) into a 

reduced mass of material for hydrometallurgical processing. 



 
 

 

96 

• Minimising effluent streams from the processing plant, which includes maintaining a 
closed water circuit. 

 
The Mintek testwork was conducted using a 600 kg composite sample from existing 

stockpiles on site and the results derived were then used for the purpose of circuit and 
flowsheet development. In addition, a further fresh ±200 kg sample of below the water table 
material was also tested to verify the developed operating conditions. 

 
The results from the testwork provided a basis for the design of a uranium and vanadium 

beneficiation processes comprising the following; 
 
•  Primary crushing 
•  Scrubbing 
•  Oversize crushing 
•  Attritioning and secondary classification 
•  Pre-leach thickening 
•  Alkaline leach 
•  Counter current decantation 
•  Ion exchange 
•  Uranium precipitation 
•  Uranium drying and packaging 
•  Vanadium precipitation 
• Vanadium packaging 
 
The following narrative indicates the key testwork results and describes how these results 

were interpreted in generating the final flowsheet. A schematic representation of the overall 
process flow is shown in Figure 60. 

 
 

16.5.2 Primary Crushing 
 
Unfortunately, due to percussion borehole sampling, the material used for the recent 

testwork at Mintek did not provide naturally arising particle size distributions. 
Consequently GRD Minproc was reliant on previous particle size distributions derived by 
Gencor, which indicated sizes up to 300 mm, with all of the larger material as either quartz 
pebbles/boulders or agglomerates. The latter is held together by a calcrete matrix, 
comprising primarily calcium carbonate, in which the valuables are contained in the form of 
carnotite. Gencor proposed crushing and milling, which would entail expending large 
amounts of energy reducing essentially barren material, GRD Minproc investigated various 
means of reducing the oversize material without generating additional fines. 

 
This investigation concluded the installation of two mineral sizers in series, which 

provides great flexibility, while fines generation is kept to an absolute minimum. The 
envisaged crushing ratios are purposefully kept low. In the event of one unit being off-line 
the plant can still operate albeit at reduced throughputs, providing improved flexibility. 
Should any material report to the mineral sizer that is either too large or competent then 
there is a facility provided to dump this material immediately adjacent to the crusher. No 
work in regards to the above was conducted at Mintek, although a number of discussions 
were held with MMD, the supplier of the mineral sizer.

16.5.3 Scrubbing and Primary Classification 

 
The three bulk samples from site, namely M1, M2 and M3, were blended separately.  

Subsamples of each, weighing ±70 kg, were drawn off, these three samples were then 
thoroughly mixed and split three times into A, B and C samples. The remainder was retained 
for possible further testwork. 

 
Gencor advocated the use of milling, but, after investigating scrubbing extensively it 

became apparent that this would be superfluous. GRD Minproc strived to keep the fines 
generation to a minimum whilst generating a sizable coarse barren fraction for disposal 
before the downstream process. 70 kg of composite material was scrubbed in a 1.0 x 0.26 m 
laboratory scrubber fitted with four 100 mm lifter bars. At different retention times, the feed 
and products were wet screened and the various size fractions submitted for assaying. 

 
Figure 61 shows the variability of the scrubber feed particle size distributions (PSD), 

which is primarily attributed to the limited amount of coarser material. It should be noted 
that the three primary samples, M1, M2 and M3 had already been crushed prior to delivery 
to Mintek. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 61: Scrubber Feed Particle Size Distribution 

 
 
Figure 62, shows that the three scrubber particle size distributions are very similar and 

there is no apparent benefit in prolonged residence times. The conclusion is that the material 
needs to be wetted. Six minutes residence time was selected to provide some latitude in the 
event of the feed material being of greater competency.

Figure 62: Scrubber Product Particle Size Distribution 

 
Figure 63 below confirms the conclusion derived from the above graph, namely there is 

no apparent benefit in increasing the residence time. The slightly better deportment of 
uranium in the 6 minute sample is attributed to the finer particle size distribution.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 63: Uranium Deportment

 Figure 64 below shows the uranium assay in the various scrubber product size fractions. 
A rather long tail is evident. With Paladin having stipulated an acceptable barren cut-off 
grade of 100ppm and GRD Minproc's aim being to reduce the downstream load it became 
clear that further uranium recovery was necessary. It should be noted that a full-scale 
scrubber is expected to perform better than the Mintek test unit, due to improved dynamics. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Figure 64: Scrubber Product Uranium Distribution 

 
 
 
The scrubber product passes through a trommel, with 40mm apertures, which protects 

the scrubber product screen. Any oversize reports to a conveyor. To provide further plant 
flexibility it was decided to fit an online analyser on this conveyor, thus in the event of the 
barren cut-off grade not being met the material can be fed back to the scrubber circuit. 
Should the incoming material be of a very competent nature, this material can be 
reintroduced to aid in the scrubber. The trommel undersize reports to the scrubber product 
screen, this screen produces three products, a 40 x 8 mm size fraction, a 8.0 x 3.35 mm size 
fraction and a -3.35 mm size fraction. Although it is possible to combine the two finer size 
fractions, as discussed in Section 16.4.5 below, it is not advisable. The 8 mm topsize was 
based on supplier recommendations. 

 
The coarse scrubber screen product (40 x 8 mm) should comprise primarily of quartz 

pebbles. In the event of carnotite containing agglomerates and/or pebbles (as a coating) 
reporting to this stream, a facility to re-cycle this material has been provided. In keeping with 
a near closed water circuit, it is likely that carbonate will report to the feed preparation 
circuit and in conjunction with the downstream viscosity issues encountered, it necessitated 
that additional scrubbing tests be conducted in the presence of 40 g/L sodium carbonate in 
order to visually quantify any adverse effects on the slurry. No apparent changes were 
observed; subsequently no further tests were conducted in this regard. 



 
 

 

101 

 
The particle size distributions used to generate the mass balance around the scrubber and 

associated screen was based on extrapolation of existing Gencor data (Table 11). This was 
conducted using Rossin Rammler paper and assuming that the fines slope remained the 
same, whilst the reduced coarse predominantly reports to the middlings. This assumption 
would need to be validated in any future testwork, as any additional material reporting to 
the fines fraction would increase the downstream process load. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 11: Estimated Particle Size Distribution 
 
 

16.5.4 Oversize Crushing 
 
Scrubber screen oversize material (40 x 8 mm) is discharged on to a conveyor fitted with 

an online analyser. Through the use of a bifurcated chute, the material can either be 
transferred to another conveyor for improved uranium recovery or discharged directly on to 
a barren stockpile. The second conveyor transfers the material to a cone crusher that 
produces a product with a P80 of ±25 mm, this material reports back to the scrubber feed 
conveyor.  No additional testwork on this crushed material was conducted; it was assumed 
that all entrained uranium in this fraction has been recovered. 

 
 
 

16.5.5 Attritioning and Secondary Classification 
 
Based on the premise that a barren stream could be produced from the feed preparation 

area and, in conjunction with an acceptable barren cut-off grade of 100 ppm (as agreed with 
LHULP), there was a need to further process the -8.0 mm material. Again the primary driver 
was to find a method of recovering some additional uranium whilst making every effort to 
avoid generating additional fines. 

 



 
 

 

102 

Attritioning was subsequently explored in some detail. Firstly, two samples were selected 
from the 6 minute scrubbed material, one sample being 9.5 x 3.35 mm and the other 3.35 x 0.5 
mm. These samples were then subjected to attritioning in a 1.5 L unit at 1 370 rpm for 10 
minutes. 

 
Table 12 shows that the coarse fraction is close to the acceptable cut-off grade, while the 

finer fraction still contains too much uranium for direct disposal. The upgrade achieved was 
very encouraging, indicating that further residence time would achieve the necessary results. 
A review of data indicated that should the two -0.5 mm size fractions be combined a further 
±5% uranium recovery could be realized in an additional ±7-8% mass. It was therefore 
decided to conduct some further testwork on some of the +0.5 mm material from the 
remaining combined sample. Three samples were prepared, namely a 9.5 x 3.35 mm, 3.35 x 
0.5 mm and finally a 25 x 9.5 mm size fraction. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Table 12: Primary Attritioning Results 

 
 
Based on Figure 65 and Figure 66 below, the following observations were made. Firstly, 

between 10-25% fines, -0.5 mm, material is generated by attritioning. The middlings fraction 
therefore clearly comprises a significant amount of agglomerates. Secondly, and more 
importantly, the -3.35 mm size fraction uranium assay appears independent of the residence 
time. 

 
In order to establish the way forward two samples of scrubbed material were taken for 

microscopic investigation. The coarser fraction, the 9.5 x 3.35 mm, looked very clean with 
predominantly un-coated quartz pebbles. Some of these were black due to the radiation and 
only a few agglomerates were observed.

Figure 65: Attritioining Fines Generation 

 
Note that the relatively low uranium assays come as no surprise. The finer size fraction 

indicated more yellow/orange coatings on the quartz pebbles present. Thus it was suggested 
that attritioning might still be the way to reduce the uranium content further. Unfortunately, 
significantly more energy input would be required for this to be achieved. It was decided to 
double the impeller speed and investigate the effect on the 3.35 x 0.5 mm size fraction. One 
supplier had indicated a possible benefit in combining the two size fractions. Subsequently a 
9.5 x 0.5 mm size fraction was also tested. The results are shown below. 

 
From Table 13 below the uranium recovery in the 3.35 x 0.5 mm size fraction has 

improved from 42% to 82%, however, the mass yield has increased from 13.8% to 26.7%. 
More importantly the cut-off grade off 100 ppm has finally been met. Consequently, the 
selected process has made provision for two separate attritioning circuits, one for the coarser 
and the other for the finer size fractions, the latter with considerably more power input.

Figure 66: Attritioning Assay Results  

 
16.5.6 Pre-Leach Thickening 

 
No testwork was conducted on any pre-leach material, although much work was 

performed on leached material. It was assumed that this application would behave in a 
similar fashion, or even more efficiently, to that of the CCD feed with leached material. A 21 
m high-rate thickener was thus selected and the required flocculant dosage was assumed to 
be 140 g/t feed, as per the design parameters used for the CCD. Due to the elevated 
viscosities encountered during the leach tests, it was decided to provide a pre-leach thickener 
underflow conditioning tank. The sodium carbonate and bicarbonate are added in the 
required quantities to achieve a pH of around 10.6.  

 
16.5.7 Alkaline Leaching 

 
In order to evaluate the effect of particle size, temperature and time on leach efficiency, 

the six and ten minute scrubber products were blended and split into two sub-samples. One 
sample was used to screen out -500 µm material and the other sample was screened at 212 
µm. The oversize was then reduced to -212 µm and mixed with the naturally arising -212 µm 
material. 

 
During the course of the testwork it became apparent that the elevated viscosities 

encountered would necessitate some changes to the envisaged process. This sequence of 
leaching was entirely unsuccessful, primarily due to these high viscosities. This in turn 
compromised the sample preparation. Slurry samples collected were filtered using a 
conventional Buchner funnel and filter paper.  Filtration times were very long, giving rise to 
significant evaporation losses. Ultimately these problems meant that any analytical results 
provided for solid residues were of little or no value. Some conclusions can be drawn from 



 
 

 

105 

the following two graphs (Figure 67 and Figure 68). Firstly, the top size appears to have no 
or limited effect on the degree of uranium and vanadium dissolution.  Secondly, the leach 
clearly has to be conducted at elevated temperature as the inferred leach efficiency at both 
40°C and 60°C is poor.

It was decided that the viscosity issue needed to be investigated in more detail before 

carrying on with further leaching testing. Mintek was duly instructed to conduct viscosity 



 
 

 

106 

tests under varying conditions. The results are presented in Table 14 using -500 µm material, 
leached at 75°C with 40 g/L sodium carbonate. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 14: Mintek Viscosity Test Results 
 
 
Based on the above results, it was decided that all future leach testwork would only be 

conducted on 25% solid slurries. The next phase of leach testwork centered on determining 
the amount of sodium carbonate in the leach slurry that is required for efficient leaching. The 
range tested was 30 g/L, 35 g/L and 40 g/L; these concentrations were based on the Gencor 
testwork. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 15:  Effect of Sodium Carbonate Concentration on % Uranium Dissolution 
 
The above table is inconclusive and indicates that there does not appear to be any 

optimum sodium carbonate concentration. A conservative figure of 40 g/L was selected for 
future testwork. A 600 kg bulk sample was scrubbed and the -500 µm material collected. This 
was used to makeup a 25% solid slurry sample that was then heated to 75°C. 40 g/L sodium 
carbonate was added. It was also decided to repeat the test at 20 g/L sodium carbonate. 
Finally, the effect of adding 10 g/L of sodium bicarbonate was investigated. 

 
From Table 16 and Figure 69 it can be seen that uranium dissolutions of 92% can be 

achieved after 36 hours with 40 g/L sodium carbonate. With the addition of sodium 
bicarbonate the dissolution increases to 96%, which is significant. The leach circuit was 
subsequently designed according to the following parameters: 

 
•  75°C 
•  40 g/L sodium carbonate 
•  10 g/L sodium bicarbonate 
•  36 hour residence time 
•  -500 µm feed size 
•  25% solids

Figure 69:  Bulk Leach Resolution Results 

 
 
The residence leach time selected is conservative; indications are that leach times of 24 to 

30 hours will give acceptable uranium dissolution rates. This conservatism is incorporated to 
allow for time spent heating the slurry to the required temperature.  

 
 
 
 

16.5.8 Counter Current Decantation 
 



 
 

 

108 

 The original intention was to filter the leachate. Consequently suppliers (GL&V, Larox, 
Lightnin, Outokumpu, IST and Filtres Philippe) were invited to conduct filtration testwork 
on freshly generated heated slurry. Filtration proved very slow, even with very high 
flocculant dosages. 

 
A summary of the results received follows below (note, several suppliers did not provide 

GRD Minproc with any feedback). 
 
i) Filtres Philippe (Belt Filter Supplier) 
 
Filtres Philippe provided GRD Minproc SA with the most comprehensive feedback. >90% 

wash efficiencies are possible at a production rate of ≤20 kg/h/m² filter cake.  The required 
wash ratio (m³ water/tonne dry solids) was found to be ≥1.5 for ≥90% wash efficiencies. 
Under these conditions one can expect a filter cake thickness of 6 mm with a residual 
moisture content of ±60% at a flocculant dosage rate of 250 g/t. In summary this would 
necessitate a filter area of ±1 200m², the filter cost alone, without auxiliaries and associated 
structures, was indicated at ±US$12 M. 

 
ii) MacOne (Mintek Thickening and Filtration Consultant) 
 
MacOne summarised the work by stating that at 323 g/t flocculant the filtration area 

requirement would be 11 m²/t. It is possible to reduce this filter area to 2.2 m²/t. This is at a 
chemical cost in the range US$1.0-1.5 /t solids. Unflocculated solids would require ±110 
m²/t. 

 
iii) Larox (Pressure Filtration Supplier) 
 
Larox did not report with any official findings.  From visual observations made at Mintek, 

it was apparent that as the pressure started building-up some liquor was recovered. This 
soon stopped, even at 60 bar pressure. Upon opening the pressure vessel the solids were 
found compacted on the filter cloth, with a layer of liquor on top. 

 
iv) IST (Thickener, Belt Filter and Pressure Filtration Supplier) 
 
IST managed to produce a couple of filter cakes ±30 mm thick in a Buchner funnel, by 

adding 127-347 g/t flocculant, with a residual moisture content of ±50%. In conclusion, the 
above indicates a filtration rate of only 8-10 kg/m²/h. Once Larox, after applying 60bar to 
the slurry sample, failed to produce a viable product it became clear that filtration would not 
be a feasible option. CCD work was investigated further. Even when a filter cake was 
formed, the residual moisture content was not significantly better than that found in the high 
rate thickener underflow.  

 
Once again the same suppliers, with the exception of Filters Philippe and Larox, were 

invited to conduct some settling tests on fresh leachate. This application still proved a 
challenge with high flocculant dosages, murky supernatants, poor compaction, etc. The 
results received by GRD Minproc to date are summarised in Table 17.

Table 17: Settling Test Summary 
 
As can be seen from the above table the results vary significantly. Outokumpu and 

Lightnin, both considered technically competent, indicated similar results. Consequently, a 
combination of their data was used in the design of the CCD circuit, incorporating the 
following parameters: 

 
• ≤140 g/t flocculant 
• 6 stages 
• 2:1 wash water ratio 
• ≥35% solids in the underflow 
• a pregnant liquor clarifier stage (this was included to cater for any upset conditions in 

the plant) 
 
The following notes apply to the settling tests: 
 
• During some of the settling tests conducted at Mintek a "doughnut" was formed in the 

settling cylinder. Therefore, thickener designs will have to accommodate "doughnut 
breaker" rake mechanism. 

• Under plant operating conditions higher underflow densities can be expected than 
those generated under laboratory conditions. These higher underflow densities being 
up to 2-5% more. 

• The high rheology of the thickened slurry might necessitate the use of steeper bottom 
slope, higher side wall and higher raking and drive components. 

 
Any further testwork must be done on standardised flocculant selection (the thickener 
vendor companies indicated that they selected the best flocculant based on feedback from 
MacOne, yet they differ).

16.5.9 Ion Exchange 
 
Solvent extraction for uranium is limited to acid leach solutions. Subsequently, the focus 

of the next phase of work fell squarely on developing an Ion exchange circuit. 
 

16.5.9.1 IX Adsorption 
 
The high pH of the pregnant solution from the leach circuit precludes the use of weak 

base resins. Only strong base ion exchange resins were investigated further, namely: 
 
• Bayer M600 
• Bayer M500 
• Bayer K6367 
• DOW 21K 
 
Preliminary work was conducted on a solution obtained by leaching an old Langer 

Heinrich sample stored at Mintek. Two suites of tests were conducted with the different 
resins. The first with a 40 g/L sodium carbonate solution and the second with a 71 g/L 
sodium carbonate solution. The different resins performed very similarly with loadings of 
between 60-80 g/L in the 40 g/L sodium carbonate solution and ±0.7 g/L uranium. In the 
elevated sodium carbonate solution the loading decreased to between 30-40 g/L. Bayer M500 
was selected for all future testwork based on price and technical assistance from the supplier. 

 
The next phase involved developing equilibrium isotherms for both the uranium and the 

vanadium. A Langmiur equation was fitted to the uranium isotherm, which in turn, was 
used to predict the maximum uranium loading under envisaged pregnant stream conditions. 
The result indicates a maximum loading of 35-45 g/L, but accountability was stated as 80% 
only. Vanadium provided a surprise, in that, it did not co-load on to the resin in the same 
ratio to the uranium as it occurs in the pregnant solution. Results indicate that under 
prevailing pregnant solution conditions vanadium will only load to ±0.7 g/L. 

 
Resin loading versus time was the next item to be investigated through bottle roll tests at 

various solution resin ratios. It was determined that maximum loadings are achieved within 
4.5 hours, as can be seen in Figure 70. It is noteworthy that the loading is relatively rapid and 
a shorter equilibrium point should be investigated. Two hours is suggested. 

 
The vanadium equilibrium loadings indicate a single, terminal maximum value of around 

0.35-0.40 g/L, independent of the solution:resin ratio, as displayed in Figure 71. The 
problems experienced with assaying the vanadium might be the reason that the indicated 
starting vanadium assay is lower than the concentration of vanadium in solution. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 

111 

 
Figure 70: Equilibrium Loading Of Uranium 

 
 

The effect of anions was also investigated, with special attention given to sulphate, chloride, carbonate and bicarbonate 
(refer to Figure 72,  

 
Figure 73 and  

Figure 74). GRD Minproc's interpretation of the test includes an adjustment to the 
Mintek's. Chlorides, however, are clearly detrimental to the resin loading capacity. 
Increasing the amount of chlorides from 0.012 mol/dm³ to 0.098 mol/dm³ reduces the 
capacity from ±35 g/L to 19.5 g/L. The carbonate and sulphate behaved very similarly, 
except for the last point. This is more than likely is due to the pH of the solution starting to 
drop. 

 
Additional tests at Mintek indicated that once the pH starts dropping below 10.4 the uranium loading capacity of the 

resin decreases dramatically, whereas, as expected, the vanadium loading capacity increases in a similar dramatic fashion 
( 

Figure 75).

Figure 75:  Uranium/Vanadium Loading vs pH 

 
 

16.5.9.2 IX Elution 
 
Resin was pre-loaded with uranium by contacting it directly with leached pulp. Three 

different eluants for stripping the uranium were investigated, namely NaCl, Na2SO4 and 
NaHCO3. The temperature was maintained at 60°C throughout the elution testwork and the 
eluant concentrations were kept at 1M and a flow-rate of 4 BV/h. 

 
Table 18 clearly demonstrates the superior performance of the NaCl as eluant, both for 

uranium and vanadium. The two best options, namely NaCl and Na2SO4, both require 
regeneration/conversion back to the carbonate form after each elution. The sulphate has 
potentially far less of a detrimental effect on resin loading capacity than chloride. It was thus 
decided to further investigate the sulphate route at reduced concentration and reduced flow-
rate. From a literature survey conducted by Mintek on uranium precipitation, it came to light 
that eluate sulphate concentrations of ≥1.0 mol/dm³ have a very detrimental effect on the 
process. Clearly the elution efficiency, when using sulphate as an eluant at concentrations of 
±0.5 mol/dm³, is not sufficient (Table 19). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 

115 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 18: Elution Efficiencies 
 
 
The use of sodium chloride as an eluant was further investigated at different flow and 

temperatures. The results are found in Table 20. Temperature and eluant flow volume did 
not appear to have a significant impact on the uranium elution, except that the elution is 
slower at the lower temperature. The elution is still complete within 4 BV's.

Table 20 Sodium Chloriade As Eluant 



 
 

 

116 

In conclusion, it was decided to use the following parameters for the elution cycle design 
basis: 

 
• flow-rate of 4.0 BV/h 
• NaCl eluant concentration 1M 
• 5 BV of eluant required for 100% uranium elution 
• The elution will be conducted at 40°C 
 
 

16.5.9.3 IX Regeneration 
 
As stated above, if using either a sulphate or chloride solution as an eluant, regeneration 

of the resin is required after each elution. This process revolves around replacing the 
chloride anion now loaded on the resin with a carbonate anion. Carbonate will also inhibit 
the uranium loading capacity, but to a lesser extent than chloride. 1M sodium carbonate was 
passed through a NaCl eluted resin bed at 2.0 BV/h and ambient temperature. 

 
The test confirmed that ±4 BV of NaCl is required for complete uranium elution. After 

passing 8 BV through the bed, elution was assumed complete, a further 6 BV of sodium 
carbonate was passed through as a regenerant (Figure 76).

Figure 77:  Uranium Elution and Regeneration 

 
 
From Figure 77, it appears as if the regeneration has attained an equilibrium after 5- 6  
 
BV with a residual chloride concentration on the solution of ±4 g/dm³ and an associated 

±30 g/dm³ concentration of carbonate. Based on the above information, the following 
parameters were used for the regeneration circuit: 

 
• regenerant flow-rate of 4.0 BV/h 
• Na2CO3 regenerant concentration 1M 
• 4 BV of regenerant required 
• The regeneration will be conducted at 40°C 
 
 

16.5.9.4 IX Summary 
 
The operating parameters derived from the above testwork were used in two laboratory 

scale counter current Ion exchange tests. The resin beds were divided into eight sections, in 
an attempt to simulate plant conditions and sampling was conducted over the 14- 15 hour 
test run. The two head samples were of similar make-up and the results are tabled below. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 

118 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 21  Continuous Ix Run Results 

 
 
Table 21 confirms that Ion exchange parameters generated in the above section, e.g. the 

elution is completed in less than 4 BV, superficial linear velocities of ±0.3 cm/s (±10 m/h) 
and an operating pH of ±10.6. In addition, the regeneration solution has a high residual 
chloride content and should thus be kept in closed circuit with the eluant system. 

The wash water is low in valuables and can thus be used outside the IX circuit; however, 
chloride levels must be monitored, to prevent build-up, as well as carbonate, which is a 
costly reagent. The destination of these streams will be investigated in greater detail in 
conjunction with the Aspen model. 

 
 

16.5.10 Uranium Precipitation 
 
At the outset it was assumed that one common precipitation circuit would be needed to 

recover both uranium and vanadium, albeit in separate steps. However, as mentioned in the 
IX section above, the vanadium does not conform to expectations and reported to the barren 
rather than to the eluate stream. The following section focuses on the precipitation of the 
entrained uranium. 

 
Based on a literature survey, the initial testwork focused on reducing the eluate stream 

pH to ±3, by adding sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The pH was raised to ±5 using 
sodium hydroxide and the solution was left for up to 6 hours. Before developing a detailed 
uranium precipitation circuit, it was decided to investigate the propensity for direct 
precipitation of the uranium from the leach liquor using sodium hydroxide (Table 22). The 



 
 

 

119 

results raised two points of concern, namely the poor uranium recovery and the relatively 
high vanadium content in the barren liquor. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 22 Direct Precipitation Of Uranium From Leach Liquor 

 
 
Since direct precipitation failed to achieve high enough recoveries it was decided to 

pursue the more conventional process route. Ion exchange tests conducted in parallel 
indicated very high elution efficiencies when using NaCl as an eluant. It was thus necessary 
to determine the effect of the eluant used on uranium precipitation. To this effect a synthetic 
eluate solution was made-up and precipitation conducted under varying eluant 
concentrations. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Table 23 Uranium Precipitation (Using Hydrogen Peroxide) From Synthetic Eluate Under Varying Eluant 

Concentrations 

 
 
From Table 23, it is clear that precipitation of uranium is very rapid and nearly complete 

when the eluant used in the Ion exchange circuit is NaCl. These results were very 
encouraging so the next phase entailed repeating this work but on a real eluate solution. In 
addition to looking at precipitating uranium from two eluate samples (one generated using 
sodium chloride, the other using sodium sulphate as eluant) it was decided to spike one 
eluate sample with vanadium (Table 24). 

 
 
 



 
 

 

120 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 24 Precipitation Of Uranium From Eluate Solution 

 
 
 
The results from tests conducted on the synthetic eluate solution are confirmed and even 

improved on. The vanadium present appears to have no adverse effect on the uranium 
precipitation efficiency. The next step was to try to optimise the uranium precipitation 
process by investigating the effect of varying hydrogen peroxide additions (Table 25) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Table 25 Uranium Precipitation Under Varying Hydrogen Peroxide Additions 

 
The uranium precipitation is very rapid and nearly complete under all scenarios 

investigated. Based on the results, 50% stoichiometric excess was assumed for the design of 
the precipitation circuit. No thickener settling tests were conducted on the precipitate and 
the vendors had to draw on in-house expertise to size these units. Likewise there was no 
opportunity to conduct any uranium centrifuging testwork. The uranium precipitate was 
submitted for analysis and was found to comply with typical product specifications.  
  



 
 

 

121 

16.5.11 Uranium Drying and Packing 
 
A sample of uranium product, recovered from filtering precipitate solution, was dried at 

±540°C. No further tests were conducted in this area. GRD Minproc chose a supplier (Jord in 
Australia) who has recent experience in vertical uranium calcining, to size and cost the 
calciner. Similarly, the packaging plant design is based on visits to the Ranger and Rössing 
Uranium sites and local in-house powder packaging experience. The small daily production 
of uranium powder does not warrant a fully automated system such as the Ranger 
operation.  

 
16.5.12 Vanadium Precipitation 

 
As mentioned above, the vanadium did not co-adsorb on to the resin as expected, thus 

alternatives to recovering the vanadium from the barren IX adsorption stream had to be 
investigated. Based on discussions with possible end-users, the target would be to produce 
either a meta or poly vanadate, and through Mintek literature search, one feasible option 
involves ferric vanadate precipitation. Some exploratory tests were conducted on a synthetic 
solution containing 4.1 g/L vanadium pentoxide. Firstly, the solution pH was adjusted to 3 
and the temperature raised to 95°C. The second test included adding some cations in the 
form of ammonium and the third test entailed adding an alternative cation in the form of 
ferrous. In an attempt to simulate the operation situation more closely, some eluate was 
spiked with vanadium. The results of the above suite of tests are listed in the Table 26.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 26 Vanadium Precipitation Using Synthetic Liquor 

 
This proved to be a hypothetical exercise as dropping the pH to 3 would entail loosing all 

the accompanying carbonate in the form of carbon dioxide. This is the major OPEX 
component and any losses of this magnitude would jeopardize the project viability and was 
subsequently not pursued any further. In addition, the indicated reaction times are long and, 
since the barren volume is large, it implies a much larger plant. Further, an extensive effort 
has been made to recover heat from the leaching circuit, through a rather expensive heat 
exchanger plant, and the above would entail heating a similar volume to an even higher 
reaction temperature. 

 
The second alternative investigated revolved around direct precipitation of the vanadium 

in the barren solution with ferrous sulphate salt. The drawback being that this could produce 
an insoluble hydroxide and as such would not have any commercial value. Three tests were 
conducted with different stoichiometric amounts of coarse ferrous sulphate heptahydrate 
added to the barren solution. This was followed by three further tests using finely ground 
ferrous sulphate, it was envisaged that this would improve the efficiency of reduction of 
vanadium. 

 
 



 
 

 

122 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Table 27 Direct Precipitation of Vanadium Using Ferrous Sulphate 

 
Based on the above table (Table 27), the barren vanadium concentration can be reduced 

from 150 ppm to 50 ppm by direct precipitation using ferrous sulphate. For the purpose of 
the study it has been assumed that two thirds of the vanadium can be recovered for a 
stoichiometric ratio of 4.5. The final figures will only be available once the Aspen simulation 
has been concluded and interrogated thoroughly. It must be noted that this process produces 
a large amount of sulphates that, if allowed to build up, could adversely impact on the 
efficiency of uranium loading on the IX resin (Table 28). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 28 Vanadium Stream Analysis 

 
 
 
 
Attempts to load the vanadium on to resins were also conducted (Table 29). No loading 

was achieved in the naturally arising carbonate form and only limited loading achieved 
when in ferrous form. The resin Lewetit TP207 was loaded with ferrous Ion before being 
contacted with barren solution. 
  



 
 

 

123 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Table 29 Vanadium Resin Loading Test Summary 

 
The recovery of vanadium from this solution is an area requiring some further 

investigation in order to derive the optimum process. 
 

16.5.13 Vanadium Packing 
 
Currently the vanadium product is assumed to have no commercial value and as such is 
co-deposited with the CCD slimes in the tailings dam. 
 
 

16.5.14 Reagents 
 
The flocculant requirements (140 g/t) for the Langer Heinrich uranium project are 

substantial and it was therefore decided to issue the flocculant systems as a vendor package. 
In addition, as results started coming back from Mintek, it also became apparent that the 
reagent requirements would be substantial. These chemicals could be handled and treated in 
a very similar fashion to that of the flocculant, so it was decided to incorporate the reagents 
into the flocculant package. Thus, flocculant and reagent requirements, both in term of 
consumptions and concentrations, were issued to selected vendors for quotation. 

 
 

16.5.15 Proposed Further Testwork 
 
A few process issues have been identified in recent months that have not yet been 

satisfactorily addressed in the completed testwork. These items, as listed below, form the 
basis of the proposed ongoing testwork programme to minimise or mitigate potential areas 
of risk, while enhancing the value of the project, and will be addressed as part of the ongoing 
upfront engineering activities: 

 
•  The choice of equipment selected for the primary crushers needs to be confirmed. 

There is presently a concern with the perceived low availability of the mineral sizers. 
The more conventional use of a jaw crusher will be investigated to minimise this 
potential problem. 

•  The samples used in the testwork conducted to date are believed to be representative. 
There is, however, still some uncertainty with regards to the amount of fine material 
that could be encountered intermittently from the mining operation. Although this can 
potentially be managed by ROM blending, it is recommended that further classification 
work be conducted on site to confirm present data. 

•  At present there is some concern about the data used to quantify the carbonate balance 
and consumption. Although, the initial results of the Aspen simulation appear to 



 
 

 

124 

confirm the assumption made in the process development, the quantities of reagent 
consumed justifies the need for further investigation into this matter. 

•  The vanadium recoveries achieved to date have been rather poor and this potential 
revenue source is presently being mixed in with the tailings stream. In light of the 
current vanadium price, alternative ways of recovering the vanadium, without 
aggravating sodium carbonate losses, are being investigated.  

 
The market place has been sourced for alternative technologies. The following will be 

investigated: 
 
•  The use of vanadium specific resins. 

•  Evaporation and crystallization technology would provide an expensive alternative, 
but has the capability of producing clean water, carbonate salt and a saleable vanadate. 
This would form part of a value adding engineering exercise. 

•  Precipitating the vanadium as a sulphide, this is the least attractive alternative as it 
entails dropping the pH to ±7. 

•  The Aspen results suggest that the potential for the build-up of unacceptable levels of 
sulphates does exist within the existing vanadium precipitation circuit. It is suggested 
that locked cycle tests be conducted to better understand the extent of this effect. Given 
that this circuit may be replaced (see above), this may not be required. 

• Viscosities are very high around the leach and CCD circuit, which precludes the use of 
conventional centrifugal pumps. The various pumping circuits, especially the tailings 
system, will be reviewed by specialist pump suppliers. Slurry samples should be sent 
to Patterson & Cooke in Cape Town for analysis. This should include adding viscosity 
modifiers to the slimes and monitoring their effects. 

 

16.6 Process Plant Design Criteria 
 
The design of the Langer Heinrich process plant is based primarily upon design criteria 

developed from the metallurgical testwork performed at Mintek. The testwork and flow 
sheet development are discussed in detail in Section 16.4. Where no specific test data exists, 
information has been drawn from previous testwork or reasonable assumptions have been 
based on in-house experience. 

 
The main process design data is contained in Table 30 and Table 31. 
 
 
In order for the design criteria to be fully understood, all data used has been referenced to 
a specific source. In this manner it is possible to identify areas in which assumptions have 
been made which might require verification prior to final detailed design. 
It should also be noted that statements of grade, mineral recoveries and upgrade factors 
quoted in the design criteria relate to figures used for design purposes, rather than being 
predictions of grade, recovery or upgrade.

16.7 Process Description 
 
The process plant site was chosen for its proximity to the mining area and by 

topographical constraints. This location minimises the initial truck haulage distances for both 
ROM to the plant and barren waste return to the waste dump. The proposed plant layout is 
shown in Figure 78.

16.7.1 Primary Crushing 

 
Run of mine (ROM) material is delivered to the plant site by truck and dumped either 

onto a ROM stockpile or onto a 400 mm aperture static grizzly mounted over a ROM bin. 
Any oversize material remaining on the grizzly is removed and discarded. This oversize 
generally consists of quartz boulders or quartz pebbles/boulders embedded in a calcrete 
matrix in the form of agglomerates. It is expected that the agglomerates will break-up when 
discharged on the grizzly and report as -500 mm material, whereas any remaining large 
quartz boulders will not, and being essentially barren can be removed and discarded. 

 
Scalped ROM is withdrawn from the bin by means of a variable speed apron feeder, 

which in turn feeds two mineral sizers, a primary and a secondary unit, in series. The 
primary unit reduces the top-size of the incoming material to ±150mm and the secondary 
unit reduces the top size further to ±75 mm. This is a very conservative crushing ratio and 
was chosen so as to improve the availability of this circuit, should either of the units not be 
available the plant is still able to run, albeit at reduced throughput. 

 
The apron feeder is variable speed to provide a facility to maintain the plant feed at a 

predetermined rate. Secondary crusher product drops directly down on a scrubber feed 
conveyor. This conveyor, which extends underneath the apron feeder (to pick up any 
spillages), is fitted with a weightometer, which is used for metallurgical accounting and 
plant feed control. 

 
The conveyor head pulley is equipped with a series of belt scrapers and a water spray 

system to remove any adhering material. Any slurry collected here reports to a dribble chute 
which in turn discharges directly into the scrubber. In addition the head chute is fitted with a 
pulping water facility. 

 
To further improve the feed preparation circuit flexibility and availability, provision has 

been made for an emergency feed system immediately adjacent to the scrubber feed 
conveyor. This system comprises a ramp, a feed hopper and a vibrating feeder. In the event 
of the upstream circuit being offline, a FEL would be able to feed material to the plant. The 
hopper will be fitted with a static grizzly, ±150mm aperture, to ensure no oversize material 
reports to the downstream circuit. 

 
 

16.7.2 Scrubbing 
 
Crushed ROM reports to the scrubber, via the plant feed conveyor head chute where the 

material is pulped with process water. The slurry then enters the scrubber, which is designed 
to provide a residence time of ten minutes. 

 
 Scrubbed product reports directly to a trommel section with an aperture of ±40 mm, these 

panels are of the rubber type to withstand the heavy duty. The trommel section is fitted with 
water spray bars to ensure efficient screening, as any adhering slimes will contain valuables. 
Trommel oversize material then gravitates through a chute onto a stacking conveyor, and is 
discharged onto a 24 hour capacity stockpile.  The stacking conveyor is fitted with an online 
analyser. In the event that the oversize material contains valuables in excess of the acceptable 
barren cut-off grade the material can be returned to the circuit via the emergency feed 
system. The trommel oversize conveyor is also fitted with a weightometer for metallurgical 
accounting purposes. 



 
 

 

128 

 
Trommel undersize reports to a wet, inclined double deck vibrating screen, with the top 

deck cutting at 8 mm and the bottom deck at 3.35 mm. Any oversize material is discharged 
onto a recycle conveyor. Should any of this material contain unacceptably high valuable 
grades then this material can be re-circulated to the scrubber, described in greater detail in 
Section 16.6.3. 

 
Screen middlings report directly to the coarse attritioner feed conveyor, which is fitted 

with a cross-belt sampler and weightometer for metallurgical accounting and plant control 
purposes.  

 
The screen undersize (-3.35 mm) gravitates straight into the scrubber product sump, from 

where the slurry is pumped to a fine attritioning feed classifying cyclone. The slurry delivery 
line is fitted with a slurry sampler, density meter and flow meter for metallurgical 
accounting and plant control purposes. 

 
16.7.3 Screen Oversize Crushing Circuit 

 
The screen oversize reports to the oversize crusher feed conveyor, which is fitted with a 

weightometer and an on-line analyser for metallurgical accounting and control purposes. 
Should the barren cut-off grade be achieved then a bifurcated chute will discharge the 
material onto a ten hour capacity stockpile for later disposal as barren material. In the event 
that the cut-off grade is not met, the material is rerouted to a recycle conveyor. This conveyor 
is fitted with a permanent tramp iron magnet, a cross-belt sampler and a weightometer, the 
former removes any metallic foreign objects before the material is discharged into the recycle 
cone crusher, which in turn is mounted directly above the scrubber feed conveyor. The 
weightometer and cross-belt sampler are used for metallurgical accounting and plant control 
purposes. 

 
The crusher reduces the material to provide a P80 of ±30 mm. In the event that the cone 

crusher is off-line or the crusher capacity is exceeded provision has been made for bypassing 
the unit by dumping the material straight onto a dedicated pad immediately adjacent to the 
scrubber feed conveyor. This material can then be recovered and reintroduced to the plant 
through the emergency feed system. 

 
16.7.4 Attritioning and Final Classification 

 
The coarse attritioning feed conveyor transfers the material (-8 mm +3.35 mm) to the 

coarse attritioning units (there are six 2 m³ units, two banks of three cells in series, one bank 
operating and one standby) where the solids are mixed with water to make-up slurry of 
±80% solids by mass. These attritioning units are designed to provide the slurry with ten 
minutes residence time. The attritioner product gravitates directly to an attritioning deslime 
screen which screens out the -500 µm material.  

 
The primary scrubber discharge screen undersize slurry, containing the -3.35 mm 

material, reports to the attritioning classifying cyclone which is designed to provide a 500 µm 
cut point. The cyclone overflow gravitates to a DSM protection screen, the cyclone underflow 
reports to a fine dewatering screen. Any oversize material from this fine dewatering screen 
cascades directly into the fine attritioner, (there are 8 units, two banks of four 5 m³ cells, one 
bank in operation and one standby) whilst the screen undersize gravitates directly to the 
attritioning product sump as this material is all -0.5 mm. The fine attritioner feed (screen 
oversize) is mixed with water in the attritioner to provide slurry of ±80% solids, which again 



 
 

 

129 

is designed to provide a residence time of ten minutes. More energy is, however, applied in 
this application in order to achieve an acceptable barren product. The fine attritioning 
product discharges directly onto the attritioning de-sliming/dewatering screen.  

 
The oversize from the DSM screen also reports to the de-sliming/dewatering screen 

together with any floor spillages, this screen has a cut-point of 500 µm. Any undersize (-500 
microns) from the DSM and de-sliming/dewatering screen reports directly to the attritioning 
product sump.  

 
Oversize material from the de-sliming/dewatering screen is discharged straight onto a 

barren material conveyor, which in turn drops the material onto a barren stockpile for 
removal by trucks. This conveyor is fitted with a cross-belt sampler and a weightometer for 
metallurgical accounting purposes.  

 
The attritioning product pump delivers the slurry (-500 µm) to the pre-leach thickener. 
 

16.7.5 Pre Leach Circuit 
 
The product stream from the attritioning circuit reports to the pre-leach thickener where 

the slurry is thickened to ±27% solids. The thickener is capable of achieving higher 
underflow solids concentrations, but, as discussed in the flow sheet development section 
above, there are associated problems in doing so. 

 
Thickener overflow gravitates to the process water reservoir, whilst the thickener 

underflow is pumped to the leach conditioning tank. In this tank chemicals, such as sodium 
carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, are mixed together with the slurry to elevate the pH to 
±10.5. Sodium carbonate was selected for leaching as the incoming ore contains appreciable 
amounts of acid consuming elements, bicarbonate solution is added to enhance the 
Uranium/Vanadium dissolution. 

 
16.7.6 Alkaline Leaching Circuit 
 

The conditioned slurry is pumped to a series of five shell and tube heat exchangers in 
series, in the first four the slurry temperature is raised to 70°C using hot water heated by a 
heat recovery circuit situated at the end of the leach circuit. The slurry exit temperatures are 
carefully monitored. 

 
In the final stage the slurry exit temperature is controlled to ±75°C by regulating the 

volume of hot water received directly from the hot water tank. Slurry leaving this final stage 
reports to the first of nine leach tanks installed in series. 

 
The slurry then cascades through the alkaline leach train, which consists of nine tanks, 

each fitted with a mixer. Facilities have been provided to maintain the leach temperature at 
75°C, through insulation and capping of the leach tanks. Provision has been made to 
maintain the pH at ±10.5 through the addition of more sodium carbonate and sodium 
bicarbonate. These chemicals pass through separate heat exchangers so as to ensure stable 
operating temperatures throughout the leach train. 

 
Leachate from the last leach stage reports to a bank of four shell and tube heat exchangers 

in series, were water and leachate are contacted in a counter current fashion. This recovers a 
significant amount of heat into the water stream which is then used to preheat the fresh 
incoming slurry thereby considerably reducing the overall energy requirement across the 



 
 

 

130 

leach circuit. Due to the elevated viscosities the leach tanks will be squatter than is usual for 
such an application, so as to ensure sufficient mixing of the slurry. 

 
16.7.7 Counter Current Decantation Circuit 
 

The CCD circuit comprises a clarifier and six high rate thickeners operating in series.  
 
Cooled leachate reports to CCD 1 via a mixing tank where it is diluted with the overflow 

from CCD 2. The overflow from CCD 1 gravitates to a clarifier feed launder whilst the 
underflow (at ±40% solids) is pumped tangentially into a similar mixing tank above CCD 2. 
Here the slurry is mixed with the overflow from CCD 3, before reporting to the CCD 2 
centre-well. 

 
The CCD 2 overflow reports to a separate tank fitted with a variable speed pump, which 

in turn transfers the solution to the mixing tank on CCD 1. The CCD 2 underflow is pumped 
to another mixing box on CCD 3.  

 
This counter current operation is repeated across all six CCD tanks. In the final stage, 

CCD 6, the underflow is transferred to a sump before being pumped to the slimes dam as 
waste disposal. 

 
Each CCD unit allows for extensive internal dilution to take place as solids contents of 3% 

and less are required to achieve acceptable settling rates and compaction. Facilities to bypass 
individual thickeners have also been provided. The clarifier overflow is collected in the 
pregnant solution transfer sump from which a pump transfers this solution to the pregnant 
solution holding tank.  

 
The clarifier underflow is pumped to the CCD slimes tank, where it is combined with 

CCD 6 underflow and deposited on the slimes dam some ±2 000 m away in a mined-out part 
of the mine. 

 
Flocculant is dosed to each thickener to assist with the settling of solids.  
 
It is believed that the underflow densities can be increased, but the elevated viscosities 

bring about rheological problems which in turn might limit pumping to positive 
displacement applications only. The adverse effect of high viscosities is already manifested 
in the design through reduced operating percentage solids, typically ±45%. In addition the 
mixer velocity has been reduced which raises the torque and subsequently increases the 
power draw. 

 
16.7.8 Ion Exchange Circuit 
 

The pregnant solution from the CCD circuit reports to a holding tank. From here it is 
pumped to one of three multi-stage adsorption columns. Each column is fed by a separate 
pump. 

 
Overflow from each of the adsorption columns is collected in a vanadium precipitation 

feed tank. 
 
Periodically loaded resin from the three adsorption columns is transferred in batches to an 

elution column where the resin is washed, eluted and regenerated. Each adsorption column 
has its own, dedicated elution column. 



 
 

 

131 

 
The operation of the adsorption columns is described in greater detail below. 
 
Absorption Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin loading 
 

During the forward flow (column feed) period, solution, from the pregnant 
solution tank is pumped up through the adsorption column and fluidises the resin 
contained in each stage. The uranium depleted solution overflows the upper 
flared-section of the column as the barren solution. This solution reports to the 
vanadium precipitation feed tank. 
 

Step 2 Settling 
 

The flow of solution to the adsorption column is temporarily stopped, allowing the 
resin to settle on the inter-stage plates in the column. 
 

Step 3 Resin transfer 
 

During the reverse flow period, a fixed volume of solution is drained from the 
adsorption column to the elution column. This flow causes loaded resin transfer to 
occur downwards from stage to stage and out of the bottom stage. 
 

Step 4 Flushing 
 

The cone is flushed to ensure that all the remaining resin in the cone and in the 
pipe are transferred to the elution column. 
 

Once this stage has been concluded the cycle starts from Step 1 again. 
 
The operation of the wash, elution and regeneration processes is as follows: 
 
Elution Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin wash 
 

Loaded resin is received by the elution column from the adsorption column and is 
allowed to settle. Entrained solution is drained out of the elution column back to 
the pregnant solution tank. 
 

Step 2 Flushing 
 

Wash water is added to flush out the remaining solution, which also reports to the 
pregnant solution holding tank. 
 

Step 3 Elution 
 

Eluant, in this case NaCl, is pumped through the elution column for a 
predetermined period. 
 



 
 

 

132 

During the first half of this period the eluate is collected in the uranium precipitation 
holding tank. During the remainder of the elution the eluate reports to the eluant recycle 
tank and forms the eluant for the first half of the next elution. Before each elution commences 
the concentration of NaCl is measured and adjusted to the required level. 

 
The second half of each elution uses a fresh NaCl solution. 
 
Prior to entering the elution column the temperature of the eluant is raised to 45°C by an 

electric heating element in the fresh eluant solution tank. Eluate leaving the column is used 
to pre-heat the eluant by passing through a re-cooperating heat exchanger. 

 
Regeneration Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin wash 
 

At the end of the elution the resin is rinsed with wash water. As it contains 
appreciable amounts of chloride the wash water is dispatched to the dust storage 
tank for use in road dust control. 

 
Step 2 Resin regeneration 
 

The resin is now regenerated by pumping a sodium carbonate solution through the 
resin which has the effect of replacing the chloride Ions on the resin with carbonate 
Ions. 
 

Step 3 Resin wash 
 

Finally, the resin is washed with water. This wash water, which could contain 
residual carbonate Ions, is routed back to the fresh carbonate tank for make-up 
purposes. 
 

Step 4 Resin transfer 
 

Resin is transferred, using pressurised water, over a dewatering sieve bend on the 
top of the adsorption column. From this screen it is returned to the adsorption 
column after the next loaded resin transfer is completed and before the feed to that 
adsorption column has commenced. 
 

16.7.9 Uranium Precipitation Circuit 
 

The eluate from the Ion exchange/elution circuit reports to a uranium precipitation 
holding tank where the pH of the solution is dropped to ~2.0 through the addition of 
sulphuric acid (H2SO4). 

 
From here it is pumped to a precipitation tank where hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, is then 

added at a controlled rate together with NaOH, whilst maintaining the pH at ~2.0. The 
residence time in this stage is ±10 minutes. 

 
This tank then overflows into a second, stirred vessel where further sodium hydroxide, 

NaOH, is added to bring the solution pH up to ~5.0. Overflow from this tank feeds a third 
vessel (total residence time across the second and third vessel is two to four hours). The 
mixture is then pumped to the uranium settler/thickener. 



 
 

 

133 

 
The uranium settler overflow gravitates to the precipitation barren tank, this solution is 

returned to the process water reservoir. The settler underflow is pumped to the uranium 
dewatering centrifuge from which the dewatered uranium solids are discharged into the 
uranium calciner feed hopper. Solution from the centrifuge is recycled to the uranium settler 
feed well. 

 
The facilities for adding flocculent to the settler feed have been provided. 
 
 
 

16.7.10 Uranium Calcining 
 

The uranium centrifuge product is introduced into a multiple stage rabble arm vertical 
hearth calciner operating at 500-550°C. Here the water of crystallization is removed from the 
precipitate product producing a high grade U3O8 product. 

 
From here the dry product, U3O8, is discharged into a hammer mill, ensuring that the dry 

product takes on true powder characteristics by eliminating any lumps. This product is then 
collected in a product holding bin ahead of the packaging plant. 

 
16.7.11 Uranium Packing Circuit 

 
The uranium product holding bin is designed to accommodate 120 hours of production, 

the bin is fully enclosed and fitted with a pulsating dust filter, recovered dust discharging 
straight back into the bin.  

 
Material is drawn from the holding bin by means of a screw feeder; a telescopic chute on 

the screw feeder discharges the material into a 200 L drum. Negative pressure is applied in 
the telescopic chute, any recovered dust reporting back to the holding bin through a flexible 
hose. The drum is placed on load cells, so once the correct weight has been reached the drum 
is moved away. The drum is then sealed and marked up by the operator and placed on a 
pallet. 

 
16.7.12 Vanadium Precipitation Circuit 
 

The barren stream from the IX adsorption stage reports to the vanadium conditioning 
tank. 

 
 Ferrous sulphate is added to this tank for direct precipitation of the vanadium, the 

precipitation is rapid nearing completion within 30 minutes. The tank is fitted with a mixer 
to aid the process of precipitation. 

 
The slurry is then pumped to the vanadium settler, the vanadium settler overflow 

gravitates to a tank, and this solution is returned to the leach process, due to the high 
carbonate grade. Settler underflow is pumped to the tailings disposal sump, where it is 
pumped to the tailings facility and co-deposited with CCD slimes. Preliminary Mintek 
testwork has indicated that the vanadium complex precipitated is inert in nature. 

 
The facilities for adding flocculent to the settler feed have been provided. 
 



 
 

 

134 

16.7.13 Vanadium Circuit Product Handling 
 
The vanadium precipitate has little or no commercial value in its present form. 

Subsequently, the vanadium settler underflow is combined with CCD underflow and 
codeposited in the tailings facility. 

 
16.7.14 Reagents 
 

The chemical reagent area can be split up into three areas and these are described below. 
These facilities are geared to provide sufficient storage for 14 days of operation. The dosing 
system is to have a 30 hour storage capacity, as mixing of the various reagents will only take 
place during the day shift, under normal operating conditions. 

i. Powder Flocculant 
 

Flocculation tests have not been conducted on either the pre-leach, clarifier, 
uranium and vanadium thickeners/settlers. Subsequently the following 
assumptions were made; firstly the pre-leach will use the same flocculant used in 
the counter current decantation circuit; secondly the uranium, vanadium and 
clarifier flocculants are assumed different and have their own dedicated systems. 
 
The flocculant systems will be supplied by a single supplier as an all inclusive 
package and will consequently not be discussed in any detail, only briefly out-
lined below: 
 
Powder flocculant arrives in bags on trucks from various parts of Southern Africa. 
Dedicated hoists are used to offload the bulk bags into separate storage bays. To 
mix a batch, the required number of bags are picked up by the same hoist and 
bottom discharged into a dry powder hopper. The powder is withdrawn by means 
of a screw feeder. This feeder in turn, discharges the powder into a funnel that 
introduces the powder into a PVC pipe. A blower transfers the powder in the PVC 
pipe to an eductor mounted just below the grating on the mixing tank. Here, clean 
water is introduced and mixed with the powder. The mixture reports to the mixing 
tank where more water is added to achieve the desired solution strength. The tank 
is fitted with a mixer and typically two hours allowed for proper hydration of the 
flocculant. 
 
Once the flocculant is properly hydrated the solution is transferred to the dosing 
tank through a positive displacement pump. Dosage to the various chemical 
addition points is achieved through the use of positive displacement pumps. 
 

ii. Powder Reagents 
 

Based on testwork conducted at Mintek, the following suite of chemicals has been 
selected: 
  



 
 

 

135 

• Sodium Carbonate 
 
This chemical is used to leach the uranium and vanadium from the 
ore and it is also used to regenerate the IX resin. The latter replaces 
the chloride used for stripping the resin with carbonate. 
 

• Sodium Bicarbonate 
 

This chemical is used solely in the leach circuit to aid in the 
dissolution of the uranium and vanadium. 
 

• Sodium Chloride 
 

NaCl was found to be the most suitable IX stripping reagent. The 
chlorides replace the uranium and vanadium on the resin. 
 

• Sodium Hydroxide 
 

NaOH is used exclusively in the precipitation of the uranium to raise 
the solution pH from ±2 to ±5. 

• Hydrogen Peroxide 
 

Hydrogen Peroxide is also exclusively used in the uranium 
precipitation circuit. 
 

• Ferrous Sulphate 
Ferrous sulphate is used for direct precipitation of the vanadium in 
the IX adsorption barren solution. The possibility of generating this 
chemical using scrap metal and sulphuric acid needs to be 
investigated, as supply can be sporadic. 
 

These chemicals have all been lumped together with the flocculants as the systems 
employed are very similar and subsequently not further described. The primary 
difference being that hydration time is not an issue. 
 
Note: 
 
The NaOH circuit needs extra attention due to its very corrosive properties. The 
powder hopper will be operated under a slight negative pressure, i.e. when bottom 
discharging the bulk bag any dust will be captured in a filter mounted on the 
hopper. 

 
This filter will discharge any entrained dust back into the hopper once filling is 

concluded. 
 
iii) Liquid Reagents 

The only liquid reagent currently envisaged is sulphuric acid, this chemical will 
be delivered by isotainer to site and transferred into the 10 m³ transfer tank. The 
sulphuric acid is then transferred to either one of two 20 m³ holding/dosing tanks. 

  



 
 

 

136 

There is 100% redundancy on the transfer pumps. Two solution pumps, one 
operating and one standby, deliver the solution to the uranium precipitation circuit 
as and when required. 

 
16.7.15 Water Reticulation Circuit 
 

Raw water is brought in from Swakopmund via an 80 km new pipeline. In order to keep 
the water consumption to a minimum, every effort has been made to close the water circuits 
as far as possible. 

 
The raw water reports to four Braithwaite tanks with a capacity of ±2 000 m³ each, 

providing the Langer Heinrich process complex 24 hours of clean water. This is in the event 
of any supply disruption. Three of these tanks supply the raw water reservoir with top-up 
water. The fourth tank is a dedicated fire water tank. The fire water tank has three pumps 
connected to a common manifold, two electric and one diesel unit. 

 
Two pumps, operating off a common manifold connected to the three other tanks, deliver 

the water to either of two 7 000 m³ water reservoirs and a dedicated clean water tank. 
 
The two reservoirs are linked so the level under normal operating conditions will be 

equal. 
 
In the event that either reservoir needs to go offline, they can be isolated. Recovered water 

from the slimes dam, pre-leach thickener overflow, IX sieve bend undersize and the uranium 
precipitation barren solution report back to the reservoirs. 

 
The reservoirs share a common water manifold line with two suctions from each 

reservoir. 
 
Each suction in turn is fitted with a manual isolation valve. On this manifold there are 

four sets of two pumps. Each set has one operating and one standby unit. 
 
The clean water tank is required to supply gland water to the pumps and make-up water 

for the reagents. Potable water for human consumption will be a completely separate system 
to ensure no cross contamination. 

 
16.8 Mass And Water Balance 
 

A complete set of flowsheets, including mass and water balance information are included 
in the Appendix of the feasibility study but not included in this document. 

 

16.9 Process Equipment Selection 
 

In general, "Request for Quotation" (RFQ's) documentation were issued to a minimum of 
three suppliers. Received quotes were then technically adjudicated by process and 
engineering. Technical compliance being the first and foremost criteria. Further criteria 
investigated included quality of documentation, local content, technical back-up and 
relevant experience. 

 



 
 

 

137 

16.10 Process Control Philosophy 
 
16.10.1 Introduction 
 

The design of the plant is based on the principle of minimising human error and 
providing a relatively simple and reliable plant to operate. 

 
All automatic controls have manual overrides and bypasses to permit continued plant 

operation under manual control. 
 

16.10.2 Primary Crushing 
 

For the ore crushing area, the operator visually monitors the process on a roving basis. 
Oversize material (+500 mm) on the ROM bin grizzly needs to be removed manually or by 
front end loader to prevent blockages. ROM bin level detectors indicate the need to stop 
trucks discharging or FEL feeding if the bin becomes too full. 

 
The plant feed rate is controlled at a set point by the plant feed conveyor weightometer 

and the variable speed apron feeder setting. 
 
 

16.10.3 Scrubbing and Primary Classification 
 

The scrubber/trommel is manually controlled with power, speed and water addition 
being continuously displayed. Water is automatically added (regulated by signals from the 
two weightometers on the scrubber feed and recycle no.2 conveyor) but manual control 
valves allow actual manipulation of the flowrate. 

 
The trommel and scrubber screen oversize conveyor weightometers are also used for 

metallurgical accounting and, in the latter case, for monitoring the variations in the amount 
of recycled oversize. Should this re-circulating load increase to an unacceptable level or the 
design capacity of the crusher be exceeded, then there is an automated facility to divert the 
oversize to the ground. 

 
The screen undersize reports to a sump fitted with a level transmitter that controls the 

water makeup control valve. 
 

16.10.4 Oversize Crushing 
 
The scrubber screen oversize report to the recycle conveyor no.1. This conveyor is fitted 

with a weightometer and an online analyser. The oversize material then reports a bifurcated 
chute. Should the acceptable barren cut-off grade be achieved, then a hydraulic cylinder will 
position the flopper to discharge onto a barren stockpile. Should this stockpile be full then 
the feed to plant will stop. 

 
In the event that the barren cut-off grade is not met, the flopper will move across to enable 

discharge onto the recycle conveyor no.2. This in turn transfers the material to the cone 
crusher, via a bifurcated chute. This conveyor is also fitted with a weightometer for 
metallurgical accounting and plant control purposes. Should the recycle load build-up to 
such an extent that the design capacity of the crusher is exceeded, a hydraulic cylinder will 
move the flopper across to the emergency stockpile. Similarly, should the crusher be off-line, 
the flopper will be moved across to the emergency stockpile position. If the stockpile is not 



 
 

 

138 

properly controlled and allowed to build-up (with the crusher off-line) to such an extent so 
as to activate the blocked chute switch then the plant feed will be stopped. 

 
16.10.5 Attritioning And Secondary Classification 
 

Coarse Attritioning Circuit 
 
The water makeup line to the attritioner feed is fitted with a flow meter, control valve and 

a manual isolation valve. Water addition is regulated by the weightometer on the attritioner 
feed conveyor to achieve the set point percentage solids feeding the attritioners. 

 
Fine Attritioning Circuit 
 
The undersize material from the primary classification screen reports to a cyclone with a 

field mounted pressure indicator. There is also a pressure transmitter for alarming purposes. 
The cyclone underflow reports to a fine classifying screen where spray water is 

automatically added to the screen upon start-up. The flowrate can be manipulated through a 
manual control valve and is continuously monitored through a flow transmitter. 

 
The de-sliming screen spray water is controlled as per the fine classifying screen above. 
 
The attritioning circuit product sump level is controlled through a sump level transmitter 

and an automated control valve on the make-up water line. 
 

16.10.6 Pre-Leach Thickening 
 

The high rate thickener is controlled via bed depth monitoring and flocculant flow rate 
control. In addition a bed pressure transmitter is used to control the variable speed thickener 
underflow pump. 

 
This unit operates unattended with alarms on the controllers to signal malfunction or loss 

of control. This is included as part of the vendor proprietary package. 
 
In the even of high torque on the rake shaft, the rakes will rise. Similarly when the torque 

decreases the rakes will be lowered. In the event of the torque reaching a pre-determined 
high value the plant feed will stop. Should the torque continue rising then the plant will be 
tripped. 

 
During a power outage the emergency power will be activated and the thickener will be 

operated in re-circulation mode. 
 
The underflow solids content is carefully controlled to a pre-determined set-point (i.e. 

±25% solids by mass) before being pumped to a conditioning tank. This tank is fitted a mixer, 
level monitor and pH monitor. The latter regulating the amount of carbonate that is added to 
the tank to achieve the required set-point, ±10.5. The bicarbonate is controlled pro-rata to the 
carbonate i.e.: is indirectly controlled by the pH. 

 
16.10.7 Alkaline Leaching 
 

The pre-leach thickener underflow stream reports to the first of five shell and tube heat 
exchangers in series. The first four receive warm water, ±70°C, from the heat recovery 
system. This raises the slurry temperature from ambient to ±70°C. In the fifth heat exchanger, 



 
 

 

139 

before reporting to the first leach tank, the slurry is heated to ±75°C using hot water from the 
hot water tank. The final stage is fitted with a temperature monitor on the leach tank feed 
line. This information is used to control the control valve on the water exit line. 

 
Sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate are pumped from the reagent area through 

separate strainers to ensure no solids or gels get through to the down-stream operation. 
 
The solutions then report to the first of two plate heat exchangers in series. Water from the 

heat recovery circuit is used to raise the solution temperature from ambient to 65°C in the 
first stage. 

 
In the second stage water from, primarily, the hot water tank is used to raise the solution 

temperature to 75°C. 
 
The above system is all part of the vendor supplied package. 
 
The water pH is controlled through an automated control valve on the sodium carbonate 

line, which in turn is fitted with a flow meter. 
 
Level control is achieved through an automated control valve on the process water line, 

which is also fitted with a flow meter. 
The leach tanks (9 off) are continuously monitored for pH and temperature. 
 
The pH is controlled as described above, as are the carbonate additions, both sodium and 

sodium bicarbonate. 
Temperature control is managed throughout the leach train by extensive insulation and 

tank capping, the loss across the system has been estimated at <0.5 MW and as such it is 
assumed that the slurry exit temperature will be close to 75°C. 

 
"Cold" water, at roughly 30degrees, from the first four stages in the slurry heating system 

and the two primary plate heat exchangers are used in four heat exchangers in series to 
recover some of the heat from the leachate. The water exit temperature is ±70°C and the 
leachate is ±40°C. 

 
Water from the two secondary plate heat exchangers and the final slurry heating stage are 

recovered in the hot water tank, here the water temperature is maintained at 95°C through 
the use of six electrical heaters and/or two diesel fired heaters. 

 
The diesel units could be used to accelerate heating after a lengthy shutdown and assist in 

maintaining the correct temperature during high load conditions. They could also maintain 
the correct operating temperature during a power outage i.e.: it is not envisaged that this 
system will be in operation under normal operating conditions. 

 
In the event of a power outage the mixers will remain activated in order to prevent solids 

from settling out in the leach tanks. 
 

16.10.8 Counter Current Decantation 
 

The high rate thickeners (6 off) are controlled via bed depth monitoring and flocculant 
flow rate control. In addition bed pressure transmitters are used to control the variable speed 
thickener underflow pumps. 

 



 
 

 

140 

Each overflow reports to a separate tank. The level in each being controlled through a 
level transmitter and a variable speed pump. These units operate unattended with alarms on 
the controllers to signal malfunction or loss of control, included as part of the vendor 
proprietary package. 

 
In the event of high torque on a rake shaft, the rakes will rise. Similarly, when the torque 

decreases the rakes will be lowered. In the event of the torque reaching a pre-determined 
high value, an alarm will be indicated and the thickener will be manually by-passed. 

 
Should the torque continue rising then the rakes will be automatically tripped. 
 
During a power outage the emergency power will be activated and the thickeners will be 

operated in re-circulation mode. 
 
Thickener underflow from the final stage CCD and clarifier are collected in the tailings 

slimes disposal tank. This tank is fitted with a level detector. Two sets of two variable speed 
pumps in series, one set operating and one standby, dispose of the slimes, through a ±2000m 
HDPE line, into a previously mined pit. The level in this sump is controlled through the 
variable speed drive on the pumps. 

 
The final configuration of the slimes disposal system will be verified during the next 

phase. 
 
It is likely that positive displacement pumps rather than centrifugal will be installed as the 

underflow density is expected be ± 40% by mass. 
 

16.10.9 Ion Exchange 
 

The narrative in Section 16.7.8 has been copied and expanded upon to include valve 
operation. Valves that are not mentioned in the following operating philosophy are assumed 
closed. 

 
The operation of the adsorption columns is described in greater detail below. 
 
Absorption Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin loading 
 

During the forward flow (column feed) period, solution, from the pregnant 
solution tank, is pumped up through the adsorption column and fluidizes the resin 
contained in each stage. The uranium depleted solution overflows the upper flared-
section of the column as the barren solution. The pregnant solution pump is started 
and valve V6 is opened, valve V3 is opened and valve V4 controls the level in the 
pregnant solution tank.  

  



 
 

 

141 

Step 2 Settling 
 

The flow of solution to the adsorption column is temporarily stopped, allowing the 
resin to settle on the inter-stage plates in the column. Valve V6 closes and the 
pregnant solution pump has stopped. 

 
Step 3 Resin transfer 
 

During the reverse flow period, a fixed volume of solution is drained from the 
adsorption column to the elution column. This flow causes loaded resin transfer to 
occur downwards from stage to stage and also out of the bottom stage. 

 
At the end of this period, which expires when a low level switch is actuated, some of 

the loaded resin is left in the conical section of the column and the pipe 
interconnecting the column and the elution column. 

 
Valve V18 is opened and the hydrostatic pressure in the column is used to transfer the 

loaded resin to the elution column. Once the low level is reached valve V2 opens 
and a known volume of water (measured by a flow element) is used to flush the 
cone section. When flushing is concluded valves V18 and V2 are closed. 

 
Step 4 Flushing 
 

The cone is flushed to ensure that all the remaining resin in the cone and in the pipe are 
transferred to the elution column. 

 
Once this stage has been concluded the cycle starts from Step 1 again. 
The operation of the wash, elution and regeneration processes is as follows: 
 
Elution Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin wash 
 

Loaded resin is received by the elution column from the adsorption column and is 
allowed to settle. Entrained solution is drained out of the elution column back to the 
pregnant solution tank. 

Valves V18 and V23 remain open until this operation is concluded, then valve V18 
closes. 
 

Step 2 Flushing 
 

Wash water is added to flush out the remaining solution, which also reports to the 
pregnant solution holding tank. 

Valve V22 is now opened and a known volume of water (measured by a flow 
element) is flushed through the elution column in order to remove any entrained 
pregnant solution. 

Once the water flush has been concluded valves V22 and V23 are closed.

Step 3 Elution 
 

Eluant, in this case NaCl, is pumped through the elution column for a 
predetermined period. 

During the first half of this period the eluate is collected in the uranium 
precipitation holding tank. During the remainder of the elution, the eluate reports to 
the eluant recycle tank and forms the eluant for the first half of the next elution. 

 
Before each elution commences the concentration of NaCl is measured and 

adjusted to the required level. 
 
The second half of each elution uses a fresh NaCl solution. 
 
Prior to entering the elution column the temperature of the eluant is raised to 45°C 

by an electric heating element in the fresh eluant solution tank. Eluate leaving the 
column is used to pre-heat the eluant by passing through a recooperating heat 
exchanger. 

The eluant solution pump is now started and valves V11, V8 and V24 are opened. 
Once a known volume of eluant, at a pre-determined flowrate, has passed through the 
column these valves are closed and the eluant solution pump stopped. 

  
This operation would in all likelihood only be followed the first time the circuit is 

started. During subsequent operations the recycle eluant would be used for the loaded 
resin and fresh eluant would only be used during the second elution phase. 

 
Regeneration Cycle: 
 
Step 1 Resin wash 
 

At the end of the elution, the resin is rinsed with wash water. As it contains 
appreciable amounts of chloride the wash water is dispatched to the dust storage tank 
for use in road dust control. 

 
Valves V11 would be closed and the fresh eluant pump stopped. Valve V26 is also 

closed. Valve V22 would open for a known period of time and valve V26 remains 
open. With the rinse finished these two valves close. 

 
Step 2 Resin regeneration 
 

The resin is now regenerated by pumping a sodium carbonate solution through the 
resin, which has the effect of replacing the chloride Ions on the resin with carbonate 
Ions. 

  
Valve V29, V32 and V25 are opened and the recovered regen pump started. Once a 

pre-determined volume passes through the column, valve V32 closes and recovered 
solution can be sent either to the leach circuit or to the bleed stream. 

 
During this period valve V16 is opened and the fresh regen pump started. Once the 

regen period has been concluded, valve V16 is closed and the fresh regen pump 
stopped. 

 
Step 3 Resin wash 



 
 

 

143 

 
Finally, the resin is washed with water. This wash water, which could contain 

residual carbonate Ions, is routed back to the fresh carbonate tank for make-up or 
recycled to the leach circuit. 

 
Step 4 Resin transfer 
 

Resin is transferred, using pressurised water, over a dewatering sieve bend on the 
top of the adsorption column. From this screen it is returned to the adsorption column 
after the next loaded resin transfer is completed. This occurs before the feed to that 
adsorption column has commenced. 

 
Valve V25 remains open and valve V22 opens and a known volume of wash water 

is passed through the column after which valves V22, V25, V29 close and the 
recovered regen' solution pump is stopped. 

 
Valves V27 and V20 are then opened and a known volume of high pressure water 

hydraulically transfers the eluted resin back to the top of the adsorption column. Once 
transfer is concluded these two valves close. 

 
16.10.10 Uranium Precipitation 

 
Eluate from the Ion exchange circuit arrives at a pH of ~10. This pH is reduced to ~2.0 

through the addition of sulphuric acid, regulated by a pH monitor on the tank overflow. 
 
The pH is then maintained whilst adding known quantities of hydrogen peroxide and 

sodium hydroxide. These quantities are added at set rates through dedicated dosing pumps. 
 
The pH in the second and third vessels is then raised to ~5.0 by adding sodium 

hydroxide. 
Addition rates are regulated by pH probes on the overflows from both tanks. 
 
This solution is then pumped to the Uranium settler feed launder. It is mixed with a 

known fixed volume of flocculant solution, that can be manually manipulated, should the 
need arise before reaching the settler centre-well. 

 
The Uranium settler is controlled via bed depth monitoring and flocculant flow rate 

control. 
 
In addition a bed pressure transmitter is used to control the variable speed thickener 

underflow pump. 
 
This unit operates unattended, with alarms on the controllers to signal malfunction or loss 

of control, included as part of the vendor proprietary package. In the even of high torque on 
the rake shaft, the rakes will rise, and similarly when the torque decreases the rakes will be 
lowered. 

In the event of the torque reaching a pre-determined high value, an alarm will be 
indicated and the feed to the settler manually stopped. Should the torque continue rising 
then the plant will be tripped. 

 
During a power outage the emergency power will be activated and the thickener will be 

operated in re-circulation mode.

16.10.11 Uranium Drying and Packing 
 
The Uranium Calciner is a vendor package and detailed operating philosophy has not 

been made available. 
 
The uranium product holding bin is designed to accommodate 120 hours of production. 
 
The bin is fully enclosed and fitted with a pulsating dust filter. Recovered dust is 

intermittently discharged straight back into the bin. The bin is fitted with a continuous level 
detector. Should a high level be reached then the plant feed will be stopped. Should a high-
high level then be reached, the plant is stopped. 

 
Under normal operating conditions, drum packaging will only be conducted during the 

day shift. Material is drawn from the holding bin by means of a variable screw feeder. A 
telescopic chute on the screw feeder discharges the material into a 200 L drum. Negative 
pressure is applied to the telescopic chute, and any recovered dust reports straight back to 
the holding bin through a flexible hose. The drum is placed on load-cells, so that, once the 
correct weight has been reached, the drum is covered and moved away. To reduce the risk of 
spillage the screw feeder will slow down once the weight reaches a certain fill. 

 
When the drum is full, the screw feeder will stop and then reverse for a set period of time. 
 
The drum is then sealed and marked-up by the operator and placed on a pallet awaiting 

transport to Walvis Bay. 
 

16.10.12 Vanadium Precipitation 
 

The barren stream from the IX adsorption stage reports to the vanadium conditioning 
tank. The quantity of ferrous sulphate added to this tank is carefully measured to achieve a 
stoichiometric ratio of 4.5 Fe+2/V2O5. The reaction dynamic for direct precipitation of 
vanadium is rapid and provision has been made for ±30 minutes residence time in the tank. 
The tank is fitted with a mixer to aid the process of precipitation. 

 
The slurry is then pumped to the vanadium settler, the vanadium settler overflow 

gravitates to a tank. This solution is returned to the leach process, due to the high carbonate 
grade. Settler underflow is pumped directly to the tailings disposal sump for codeposition on 
the tailings dam. The vanadium settler underflow delivery line is fitted with both a density 
and flow element for metallurgical accounting and control purposes. Due to the small 
amounts of vanadium precipitate it is more than likely that the settler underflow will be re-
circulated until desired solids content has been reached. Then the underflow will be pumped 
to the tailings disposal sump until the solids content has reached a low level and the 
underflow goes back to re-circulation mode. 

 
The facilities for adding flocculent to the settler feed have been provided. 

  



 
 

 

145 

 
16.10.13 Vanadium Circuit Product Handling 

 
The current testwork indicated that an inert, non-saleable, vanadium product is produced. 

There has, therefore, been no provision made for a vanadium product handling facility at 
this stage. 

 
 

16.10.14 Reagents 
 
As mentioned in the Process Description above these systems will be supplied as 

packages and will not be described in detail here. The typical operation entails: 
 
• A hoist used to lift up the 1 t bulk bags to the powder storage hopper. The bag is 

manually bottom discharged into the hopper. 
 
• The start sequence is then initiated. The mixing and dosing tank mixers start and the 

screw feeder will begin withdrawing powder from the hopper. The material is discharged 
into a funnel that in turn reports to a PVC pipe. A blower, mounted on the one end of the 
PVC pipe, blows the powder to an eductor. 

 
• Water, mixed with the flocculant powder in the eductor, the product dropping into 
the mixing tank. 
• Once a known amount of flocculant has been transferred to the mixing tank, determined 

by a timer and/or conductivity probe, the screw, blower and water to the eductor stop. 
 
• Makeup water through another larger bore pipe is then added until a predetermined 

level is reached when the water is stopped. 
 
• Typical hydration time is ±2 hours; once hydration is complete the solution is pumped 

to the dosing tank, which is also fitted with a mixer. Should there be more than one dosing 
tank then the transfer can take place sooner and the hydration completed in the dosing tank 
instead. 

 
• A variable speed dosing pump is used to deliver the required amount of reagent. The 

amount, in the case of thickener applications, being controlled by the mudlevel. 
 

16.10.15 Water Reticulation 
 
The four ±2 000m³ Braithwaite tanks are fitted with continuous level detectors. The 

individual raw water makeup lines to these tanks are equipped with automated control 
valves and manual isolation valves. The primary control function is to maintain the tanks at 
100%. Thus, when a high level is reached, the automated valve closes. Should the level drop 
the valve will continue opening until the level starts to increase again. If the valve is fully 
opened and the level continues to drop then this condition is alarmed. When the level 
reaches a low level another alarm is given and finally, if the low-low level is reached, then 
the raw water pumps switch off. 

 
The manual isolation valves allow individual tanks to be isolated should the need arise. A 

common manifold is used for three of the tanks, each with its own suction and isolation 
valve. Two pumps, one operating and one standby, deliver fresh water to the process water 
reservoir.

16.11 Health and Safety 
 
Langer Heinrich Uranium (Pty) Ltd intends that, to the maximum practical extend 

possible, hazards will be designed-out or minimised at the design stage, rather than 
controlled by procedures during operation. All work will take place only after due 
consideration has been given to the proper control of all work-related hazards. The company 
will develop a culture of safety within the workforce and then work to maintain that culture 
through a structured and dynamic programme. 

 
Safety management procedures will include formal inspections, review of identified 

hazards and selection of control requirements, review of any accidents and near-misses, 
regular formal safety reviews and planning meetings. Active involvement of personnel (in 
the establishment, enforcement and review of these procedures) will ensure buy-in with the 
company's safety management system. 

 

16.12 Additional Information 
 

The original 43-101 application for Langer Heinrich was based around the process flowsheet 
developed during the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) namely a Carbonate leach, Counter 
Current Decantation (CDD), Ion Exchange, Resin Elution with sodium chloride, and uranium 
precipitation using hydrogen peroxide. 

 
During the latter stages of the BFS a potential alternative elution process was identified which 

used sodium bicarbonate instead of sodium chloride as the eluant. This option was explored 
further during the early stages of project execution by commissioning the Australian Nuclear 
science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Sydney, Australia to conduct a detailed 
testwork campaign. Following a very successful investigation the new process was adopted and 
constructed as part of the Langer Heinrich recovery plant. The new process provided the 
following benefits: 

 
� Reduced chloride levels on resin and higher uranium loadings 
� Simpler elution process to operate 
� No need to introduce chlorides into the water circuits 
� No need for a chloride "bleed stream" to prevent excessive built-up of chlorides in circuit 
 

16.13 ANSTO test program 
 

As well as investigating the new elution process ANSTO also confirmed the leach efficiencies 
determined during the BFS where uranium dissolutions of +90% were consistently achieved.

A resin scrubbing process was developed which would selectively scrub the resin of 
vanadium prior to the uranium strip so that unacceptably high vanadium concentrations did not 
proceed through to product precipitation.

Finally, testwork was conducted on firstly the precipitation of Sodium Diuranate (SDU) from 
the eluate then the re-dissolution with sulphuric acid before final precipitation with hydrogen 
peroxide and caustic soda. This work identified the operating parameters required and confirmed 
that a product of UO4 could be produced which met the specifications of the various converters. 
 
 

16.14 Operating Performance 
 

The results of the ANSTO elution testwork program were incorporated into the final plant 
which was commissioned in January 2007. Since then the plant has progressed through a ramp-up 
phase achieving monthly name plate production in December 2007. 

 
There is currently an expansion program being implemented using the existing flowsheet, 

which is designed to boost annual production to 3.7tMlb/a U3O8. This is scheduled for mechanical 
completion in December 2008 with ramp up to nameplate planned by May 2009.

17  Mineral  Resource  Est imates 
 
Mineral Resources detailed below are quoted inclusive of any Mineral Reserves. 
 

17.1 Indicator Kriging for Resource Estimation 
 
The MIK method was developed in the early 1980's with a view toward addressing some 

of the problems associated with estimation of resources in mineral deposits.  These problems 
arise where sample grades show the property of extreme variation and consequently where 
estimates of grade show extreme sensitivity to a small number of very high grades.  These 
characteristics are typical of many metal deposits where the component of interest comprises 
a very small proportion of the rock mass, for example lode gold deposits, and where the 
coefficient of variation in samples is commonly 1.5 or higher 2.  MIK is one of a number of 
methods that can be used to provide better estimates than the more traditional methods such 
as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting. 

 
It is fundamental to the estimation of resources that the estimation error is inversely 

related to the size of the volume being estimated.  To take the extreme case, the estimate of 
the average grade of a deposit generated from a weighted average grade of the entire sample 
data set is much more reliable than the estimate of the average grade of a small block of 
material within the deposit generated from a local neighbourhood of data. 

 
Another fundamental notion relevant to the optimisation of resources to develop an open 

pit mine and schedule is that the optimisation algorithm does not require the resource be 
defined on extremely small blocks relative to data spacing. 

 
The basic unit of an MIK block model is a panel that normally has the dimensions of the 

average drill hole spacing in the horizontal plane.  The panel should be large enough to 
contain a reasonable number of blocks, or Selective Mining Units (SMUs; about 15).  The 
SMU is the smallest volume of rock that can be mined separately as ore or waste and is 
usually defined by a minimum mining width.  At Langer Heinrich, the dimensions of this 
block are assumed to be in the order of 4mE x 4mN x 3mRL. 

 
The goal of MIK is to estimate the tonnage and grade of ore that would be recovered from 

each panel if the panel were mined using the SMU as the minimum selection criteria to 
distinguish between ore and waste.  To achieve this goal, the following steps are performed: 

 
1. Estimate the proportion of each domain within each panel.  This estimation 

can be achieved by kriging of indicators of domain classifications of sample 
data points or by using wireframes.  In all Details of the Langer Heinrich 
model, the proportions of each domain in each panel were estimated by 
indicator kriging.   

 
2. Estimate the histogram of grades of sample-sized units within each domain 

within each panel using MIK.  MIK actually estimates the probability of the 
grade within each panel being less than a series of indicator threshold 
grades.  These probabilities are interpreted as panel proportions. 

 
3. For each domain, and for each panel that receives an estimated grade greater 

than 0 ppm U3O8, implement a block support correction (variance 
adjustment) on the estimated histogram of sample grades in order to achieve 



 
 

 

151

a histogram of grades for SMU-sized blocks.  This step incorporates an 
explicit adjustment for Information Effect. 

 
4. Calculate the proportion of each panel estimated to exceed a set of selected 

cut-off grades, and the grades of those proportions. 
 

5. Apply to each panel, or portion of a panel below surface, a bulk density to 
achieve estimates of recoverable tonnages and grades for each panel. 

 
Apart from considerations of resource confidence classification, Step 5 completes 

construction of the resource model.  The estimates of resources for each panel may be 
combined to provide an estimate of global resources for the deposit.

17.2 Indicator Kriging Parameters 
 
The input parameters to Indicator Kriging of the Langer Heinrich mineralisation include: 
 

• Indicator variogram models describing the spatial continuity of indicator 
variables within each domain at each indicator threshold. 

 

• Variograms describing the spatial continuity of U3O8 grades within each 
domain. 

 
• Mean U3O8 grades of each of the indicator classes within each domain. 

 
Figure 140 to Figure 148 list the indicator variogram models applied in each of the 

geological domains.  The last variogram model listed in each table is the variogram model of 
U3O8 grades, used for calculation of variance adjustments. 

 
Table 43 to Table 51 list the conditional statistics of sample data in each of the modelling 

domains.  The statistics in Detail 1 domain 1 were calculated on data that include the close-
spaced drilling in the trial mining area and those samples were included in the data that 
inform the indicator kriging estimates. 

 
Table 34 shows the grid framework and kriging search parameters used in the indicator 

kriging models.  Within each Detail, the boundaries between domains were treated as soft 
boundaries in the kriging process. 

 
 

17.3 Derivation of Preferred U3O8 Assays 
 
For Gencor drill holes and test shafts the following scheme was adopted: 
 

1. Where U3O8-1 (XRF assay) ≠ blank and is >0, accept U3O8-1 (9981 records) 
2. Where U3O8-1 = -30 adopt 15ppm, where = -20 adopt 10ppm, where = -10 

adopt 5ppm, where = -3 adopt 1ppm, where = -1 adopt 0ppm. 
3. Where U3O8-1 = blank and print-U3O8 ≠ blank and is >0, accept print-U3O8 

(2817 records) 
4. Where U3O8-1 = blank and print-U3O8 ≠ blank and is = 0, adopt 15ppm (726 

records) 



 
 

 

153

5. Where U3O8-1 = blank and print-U3O8 = blank and eU3O8 ≠ and is >-100, 
accept eU3O8 (528 records).  Replace –10 with 5ppm and 0 with 15ppm. 

6. Where U3O8-1 = blank and print-U3O8 = blank and eU3O8 = blank and 
U3O8-rsp-1 ≠ blank, accept U3O8-rsp-1. 

7. In diamond drill holes where no assay or eU3O8 is available and sample 
length ≥ 1 metre, adopt grade of 5ppm on the basis that core was scanned 
with a scintillometer and deliberately not assayed.  Affected intervals are 
normally at the tops and bottoms of core holes.  Exceptions to this procedure 
were applied to hole K7-D 8.87-10.08m and M4-D 7.37-8.48m which probably 
represent intervals of core loss.  These two intervals were treated as for 
shorter core loss intervals, below. 

8. In diamond core holes where no assay or eU3O8 is available and sample 
length is < 1 metre, at tops and bottoms of holes adopt 5ppm.  At other 
down-hole depths assume core loss and adopt a length-weighted average of 
grades from sample intervals immediately above and below the affected 
interval.  Affected intervals are mainly less than 5cm in length. 

9. Where type = HPEXP, HPMINE, MPPCE, HPPCO or HPTRENCH and 
U3O8-1 = blank and print-U3O8 = blank and eU3O8 = blank, adopt 15ppm on 
the basis that all percussion drill samples were checked by scintillometer and 
those with low counts were not submitted for XRF assay. (1330 HPEXP 
records, 24 HPPCE records, 36 HPPCO records, 0 HPMINE records, 15 
HPTRENCH records). 

10. Where type = HPSTAR and no U3O8 grade is available, adopt –99999.  These 
holes were selectively assayed and missing data should not be treated as low 
grades. 

11. Where type = SHAFT and no U3O8 grade is available, adopt 15ppm in near-
surface intervals not assayed and –99999 in lower intervals not assayed. 

12. Where type = HPREG and U3O8-1 = blank, adopt 0ppm.  These holes were 
assayed by low-level technique with lower detection limit of 1ppm. 

13. Where type = HPNOT or HDNOT and no U3O8 grade is available, adopt 
15ppm assuming all samples were read by scintillometer and deliberately not 
assayed because of low counts.  Subsequent viewing of data section-by-
section demonstrated that this was not sensible in all cases and intervals in  
holes SL72, SL75, SL81, SL94, SL95, SL96, SL97, SL98, SL99 (mega trench 
holes) and CE2, CF4, Z3, R1, H5, N7, L2, G3 and 28W1S were allocated –
99999. 

14. Where type = HPMINENOT and no U3O8 grade is available, adopt –99999. 
 
In Acclaim RC drill holes: 
 

15. Where eU3O8 ≠ blank accept eU3O8 
16. Where eU3O8 = blank and u3O8-1 ≠ blank, accept the XRF assay at U3O8-1.  

Note that Paladin moved samples below 15 metres depth up-hole by one 
metre based on metre-by-metre comparisons against U3O8 grades from 
down-hole radiometric logging. 

17. Otherwise set U3O8 to –99999. 
 
In Paladin RC drill holes: 
 

18. Where eU3O8 ≠ blank accept eU3O8 
19. Otherwise set U3O8 to –99999.

17.4 Compositing 
 
Figure 83 to Figure 89 show the native sample intervals employed by Gencor in drill holes 

in each of the Details.  The majority of intervals for which U3O8 assays are available are one-
metre lengths in all areas. 

 
After derivation of preferred U3O8 sample grades, weighted average grades were 

calculated for uniform one-metre down-hole composite intervals in all drill holes and test 
shafts.  Residuals less than 0.5 metres length were discarded.  Composited intervals receiving 
negative U3O8 grade that had been affected by unsampled intervals were also discarded.  
Numeric codes for sample type and assay method were carried across in the compositing 
process.  Composites were then assigned, by their mid-point locations, as being above or 
below the water table and above or below the interpreted basement surface.  Summaries of 
the numbers of resulting data by area and sample type are shown in Table 35to Table 41. 

 
Figure 90 to Figure 96 show data in each of the details.  In the figures, data are sorted 

prior to display such that highest-grade samples are plotted last.  This is a useful way of 
highlighting trends in U3O8 grades.

Each area was examined and, in all Details data were allocated to primary domains to 

separate areas of different directional trends or different general tenor of mineralisation.  
This domaining resulted in a vertical differentiation of mineralisation with 'waste' domains 
allocated above and below 'mineralised' domains. 

 
Figure 97 shows an example cross-section through Detail 1 with composites coloured by 

primary domain code. Domain 2 in all instances is treated as the primary mineralised 
domain with only minor mineralisation being present in domains 1 and 3.

17.6 Univariate Statistics 
 
Figure 98 to Figure 111 show histograms of U3O8 grades in each of the Details.  In some 

instances, data representing a Detail includes samples from the first one or two drill 
traverses in adjacent Details where it appeared useful to allow those data to inform estimates 
in the Detail.  The number of samples in the Detail 1 data subset, for example, portrayed in 
histograms may not equal the count that derives from sub-setting of Detail 1 data from the 
total set of composited data. Sample composites are subdivided by primary domains.   

 
Each of the areas contains large proportions of samples that were deliberately not assayed 

and have been allocated grades of 15ppm U3O8 (Section 16.1, above).  Composites grading 
less than 20ppm have been excluded from the data shown in the histograms and summary 
statistics.  The histograms thus indicate the distribution of mineralised samples above a low 
U3O8 grade threshold.  Proportions of the sample data in each area excluded by this 
treatment are shown in Table 42.

17.7 Variograms of U3O8 Grades 
 
For all Details, sample variograms were caluculated for the combined 'waste' 

domains (1 and 3) and the 'mineralised' domain (2). Figure 112 to Figure 117 show 
variogram maps of U3O8 grades in each of the resource areas.   

 
In all instances the directional trends evident in the variogram maps are evident to 

some extent in plan views of the sample data.  They normally conform to the 
expected direction of groundwater flow given the geometry of the palaeovalley at 
each location.  In some areas the maps are affected by the extent or pattern of drill 
coverage.  Ratios of anisotropy are mainly less than 2.  The variogram maps, in 
conjunction with plots of the sample data, were used to guide variogram model 
rotations. 

 
For each of Details, experimental variograms of U3O8 grades were calculated and 

modelled (Figure 118 to Figure 138).  The azimuths referred to in the titles of the 
diagrams conform to the trigonometric convention in which azimuth zero is grid east 
and azimuth 90 is grid north.   

 
As expected, variogram model ranges in the vertical direction are short.  The 

majority of variograms display reasonable structure, with anisotropies reflecting 
those observed in the variogram maps.  In Detail 7 the sill is reached at less than 100 
metres separation, the drill holes spacing.

Indicator Variograms 
 
Sample data from each of Details were transformed to indicator data using 

probability thresholds at P = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.97 
and 0.99.   

 
For each of Details, and for each domain in the Details, experimental indicator 

variograms were calculated and modelled.  Figure 139 shows an example set of 
down-hole indicator variograms and fitted models for domain 2 of Detail 1.  Relative 
nuggets increase, and ranges decrease at increasing indicator thresholds as expected.

17.9 Indicator Kriging Parameters 
 
The input parameters to Indicator Kriging of the Langer Heinrich mineralisation 

include: 
 

• Indicator variogram models describing the spatial continuity of 
indicator variables within each domain at each indicator threshold. 

 

• Variograms describing the spatial continuity of U3O8 grades within 
each domain. 

 

• Mean U3O8 grades of each of the indicator classes within each 
domain. 

 
Figure 140 to Figure 153 list the indicator variogram models applied in each of the 

geological domains.  The last variogram model listed in each table is the variogram 
model of U3O8 grades, used for calculation of variance adjustments. 

 
Table 43 to Table 56 list the conditional statistics of sample data in each of the 

modelling domains.  The statistics in Detail 1 domain 1 were calculated on data that 
exclude the close-spaced drilling in the trial mining area but those samples were 
included in the data that inform the indicator kriging estimates. 

 
Table 34 shows the grid framework and kriging search parameters used in the 

indicator kriging models.  Within each Detail, the boundaries between domains were 
treated as soft boundaries in the kriging process.

17.10 Block Support Adjustment (Variance Adjustment) 
 

17.10.1 General 
 
The block support adjustment is one of the most important properties of a 

recoverable resource model based on non-linear estimation methods like MIK.  It is 
an essential part of the model and involves important assumptions about the nature 
of the block grade distribution within each panel of the model. 

 
Indicator Kriging provides a direct and reliable estimate of the histogram of 

grades of sample-sized units within each panel of the model provided the panel 
dimensions are of an appropriate size.  However, ore is not selected on sample-sized 
units during mining; it is selected by shovels that have a minimum mining width and 
loaded into trucks that are despatched to either ore or waste.  The flexibility of 
digging equipment and the size of the trucking equipment provide an indication of 
the size of the smallest block of rock that will be mined as ore or waste.  To estimate 
with some accuracy the resources in a deposit that will be recovered with a certain set 
of mining equipment, the histogram of grades of sample-sized units in a panel 
provided by MIK must be adjusted to account for the size of the mining block. 

 
There are a number of adjustment methods that can be used and most of these are 

described well in Journel & Huijbregts (1978) or Isaaks & Srivastava (1989).  These 
methods make three reasonable assumptions: 

 

• The average grade of sample-sized units and blocks within the panel 
is the same and is equal to the estimated average grade of the panel. 

 

• The variance, or spread, of the block grades within the panel is less 
than the variance of grades of sample-sized units within the panel 
and the change of variance from sample-sized units to blocks can be 
calculated from the variogram of metal grades. 

 

• The approximate shape of the histogram of block grades can be 
reasonably predicted by some appropriate assumptions. 

 
17.10.2 The Variance Adjustment 

 
The size of the variance adjustment needed to obtain the variance of the block 

grade distribution within the panel can be calculated using the rule of additivity of 
variances, which in the case of block support adjustment is often called Krige's 
Relationship: 

 
Var(samples in a panel) = Var(samples in a block) + Var (blocks in a panel) 

 
The variance of sample grades in a panel and the variance of samples within a 

block can be directly calculated from the variogram of metal grades for the particular 



 
 

 

210

domain.  The ratio of Var(blocks in panel) to Var(samples in panel) is that required to 
implement the block support adjustment. 

 
17.10.3 Shape of the Block grade Distribution 

 
There are a number of rules of thumb that are useful when making judgements 

about the shape of the block grade distribution within each panel and they relate to 
the size of the variance adjustment ratio: 

 

• If the variance adjustment ratio is greater than 0.7, it may be useful to 
assume that the shape of the histogram of block grades is similar to 
that of the histogram of grades of sample-sized units.  This is known 
as the Affine Correction method.  Its application to deposits sensitive 
to extreme sample grades is usually inappropriate. 

 

• If the variance adjustment ratio is between 0.3 and 0.7 and the 
information adjustment is negligible, then the Indirect Lognormal 
Correction method of Isaaks & Srivastava (1989) can be useful.  This is 
a rule of thumb based on the experience of the authors. 

 

• If the variance adjustment ratio is less than 0.3, it is reasonable to 
assume there is a high degree of symmetrization in the block grade 
histogram.  If the histogram of sample grades in a panel is positively 
skewed, the histogram of block grades is assumed to be lognormal in 
shape.  If the histogram of sample grades in a panel is approximately 
symmetrical or negatively skewed, the block grade histogram is 
assumed to be normal in shape.  The theoretical support for these 
assumptions comes from the Central Limit Theorem of probability.  
The theory supports the interpretation that as the variance adjustment 
ratio becomes very small, the shape of the block grade distribution 
must approach that of a normal distribution.  This fact can also be 
demonstrated using geostatistical conditional simulation.  In H&S's 
implementation of MIK, this approach is called the Lognormal-
Normal Correction method.  As implemented by H&S, the shape of 
the histogram of sample-sized units is assessed on a panel-by-panel 
basis. 

 
17.10.4 The Information Effect 

 
The variance adjustment described above is only part of the adjustment required 

in many mineral deposits where the short scale variation in metal grades is extreme.  
This variance adjustment provides an estimate of the variance of true block grades 
under the assumption that grade control selection will operate with knowledge of the 
true block grades.  While this assumption is never absolutely true, it can be a 
reasonable assumption in some deposits where the short scale variability is small and 
the grade control sampling density is high.  In many deposits, however, an additional 
variance adjustment must be undertaken to account for the "Information Effect". 



 
 

 

211

 
In the absence of production information or grade control sampling, the 

Information Effect ratio is based on the variograms of metal grade and on the grade 
control sample spacing expected to be used during mining. 

 
17.10.5 Variance Adjustments Applied to the Langer Heinrich Models 

 
Variance adjustment ratios applied in estimating Langer Heinrich U3O8 resources 

are listed in Table 57.  These ratios have been applied using the Indirect Lognormal 
Correction method (i.e., incorporating symmetrization of block grade distributions).  
Selective mining (SMU) dimensions of 4mE x 4mN x 3mRL and grade control sample 
spacing of 3.2mE x 3.6mN x 1mRL have been assumed.

17.11 Resource Classification 
 
Panels in the resource model were allocated an initial confidence category based 

on the number and location of samples used to estimate proportions and grade of 
each panel.  The approach is based on the principle that larger numbers of samples, 
which are more evenly distributed throughout the search neighbourhood, will 
provide a more reliable estimate.  The number of samples and the particular 
geographic configurations that may qualify the panel as Measured rather than 
Indicated or Inferred are essentially the domain of the Competent Person.  The search 
parameters used to decide the initial classification of a panel resource in this study 
are: 

 
• Minimum number of samples found in the search neighbourhood. 

For Measured and Indicated resources, this parameter is set to 
sixteen.  For Inferred resources, a minimum of eight samples is required.  
This parameter ensures that the panel estimate is generated from a 
reasonable number of sample data. 

 
• Minimum number of spatial octants informed. 

The space around the centre of a panel being estimated is divided 
into eight octants by the axial planes of the data search ellipsoid.  This 
parameter ensures that the samples informing an estimate are relatively 
evenly spread around the panel and do not all come from one drill hole.  
For Measured and Indicated resources, at least four octants must 
contain at least one sample.  For Inferred panels, at least two octants 
must contain data. 



 
 

 

213

 
• The distance to informing data. 

The search radii define how far the kriging program may look in any 
direction to find samples to include in the estimation of resources in a 
panel.  Panel dimensions and the sampling density in various directions 
usually influence the length of these radii.  It is essential that the search 
radii be kept as short as possible while still achieving the degree of 
resolution required in the model.  For Measured resources the east, 
north and vertical radii were set to 55, 55 and 3 metres respectively.  For 
Indicated category, these radii were expanded by 36 per cent.  For 
Inferred category the plan view search radii were expanded to 100 x 100 
metres and the vertical search radius maintained at 5.2 metres. 

 
 

17.12 Post-processing and Reclassification 
 
The proportion of each panel lying below the basement interface was estimated 

using the triangulated basement surface and, at each cut-off grade, the tonnage and 
contained U3O8 estimated above cut-off was reduced by taking: 

 

• Original ore tonnes x proportion above basement = final ore tonnes 
• Original contained U3O8 x proportion above basement = final 

contained U3O8 
 
 

17.13 Resource Estimates 
 
Estimated resources above a series of cut-off grade are listed in Table 58 to Table 65.  

Grade-tonnage curves for Measured and Indicated resources in Details 1, 2, 3 and 5 
are shown in Figure 154 to Figure 157.  Estimates have been trimmed to the current 
surface topography.   

 
Figure 158 to Figure 181 show representative plan views of resource panels and 

informing data in Detail 1.  In Figure 158 to Figure 161 resource panels are coloured 
by estimated mean U3O8 grade.  Figure 162 to Figure 165 show panels coloured and 
scaled by recoverable proportion above 250ppm cut-off and Figures Figure 166 to 
Figure 169 show panels coloured by resource confidence category. 

 
Figures Figure 170 to Figure 181 show a series of cross-sections through Detail 1 

with model panels displayed by mean U3O8 grade, recoverable proportion and 
confidence category as for the plan views. 

 
The Mineral Resources were estimated by Mr David Princep, B.Sc., employed as

17.14 Other factors affecting resources 
 
The mining operations for LHU project are scheduled to work 350 days in a year.  

It is assumed that 15 days production in a year will be lost due to unscheduled 
delays.  The processing plant is scheduled to operate continuously except for planned 
maintenance periods.  The mine operates 24 hours per day in two 10-hour working 
shifts and intervening maintenance periods, processing currently operates 24 hours 
per day in three 8-hour working shifts.  

 
Mining contractor and owner's workforce commute from/to Swakopmund. The 

mining contractor total manpower requirement will be approximately 120 people in 
the first contract term of five years.  The owner's mining supervision and grade 
control personnel will be approximately 10 people.   

 
The selected mining method for the development of the LHU open pits and ore 

production is a conventional open pit excavator-truck operation with all production 
operations (drilling, blasting, loading, hauling and dumping) carried out by mining 
contractor.  Contractors will also provide earthmoving equipment and civil services 
for general site maintenance works.  

 
The selected equipment fleet will depend on the contractor but a main equipment 

fleet based on one 9m3 (180-200t) excavator and 5 90t trucks are considered necessary 
to achieve the production requirements in the first 5 years of the mining contract.  In 
terms of ancillary equipment, a wheel loader (970G), a track dozer (D9), a motor 
grader (14H) and a 40t water cart (or similar fleet) will be required for the mining 
operations. 

 
Drill and blast cost estimates currently assume in general that variability of the 

formations will require shallow holes and closely spaced blast patterns.  While 
production blasting will take place in 6m benches, a flitch height of 3m will be used 
in excavating and loading ore and waste material.   Normally two 102mm diameter 
drill rigs will be required to achieve the blasting requirements.   

 
The grade control will be based on RC drilling and radiometric probing practice to 

define the pit limits in a higher resolution than the defined by the current exploration 
model.  This will be followed with the probing of the blast holes and mathematical 
modelling to define the ore outlines.  Then, between the pit exit and ROM/stockpile 
areas, the ore trucks will be scanned by radiometric methods for an average grade 
that will specify the destination stockpiles. 

 
Process feed grade ore will be transported directly from open pit to the ROM pad 

for stockpiling.  The stockpiled ore will be loaded to the crusher with a front-end 
loader.  It is currently planned to maintain approximately 4 weeks ore supply 
stockpiled on the ROM pad to account for possible ore supply interruptions to the 
plant. In practice, ROM stock have been built up to considerably more than 4 weeks 
supply to maintain mining efficiencies.  



 
 

 

233

 
The pre-stripping of the initial production panels will require the construction of 

external waste dump(s).  In general, the height of the external dumps will not exceed 
15m depending on the topography at the dump locations. The current mining 
sequence and production schedule facilitate the waste backfilling of the mined out 
areas after the start-up period.  Some of these areas will also be used for process 
tailings storage through the mine life. 

 
The standard dual lane road width will be 20m.  The ramp width and the gradient 

to access the dump tip heads will be 20 m and 1 in 10 (10%) respectively. 
 
A minimal amount of free ground water flow is expected into the pits.  Pumping 

requirements are expected to be minimal considering the shallow depth of the pits, 
the development of relatively large pit areas and the climate at the project site. 

 
Environmental monitoring of air and water quality will be conducted on a regular 

basis.  Potentially environmentally hazardous artificial materials, such as chemicals 
and rubbish will be disposed following appropriate standard procedures.  Dust from 
the pits, dumps, stockpile operations and road surfaces will be controlled 
continuously by water or other means of suppression.    

 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves incorporate appropriate allowance for 

mining, metallurgical, infrastructure and other relevant factors. Any modifying 
factors have been detailed within Section 17. 

 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are not expected to be materially affected 

by known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, 
political or other relevant issues. 

 
In the tables above, the 250ppm U3O8 cut off grade has been highlighted as this is 

the minimum cut off grade to be used during mining operations, mineralisation is 
separated into low (250-400ppm U3O8), medium (400-650ppm U3O8) and high 
(>650ppm U3O8) grade stockpiles on mining.  

 
To the end of May 2008, mining activities have depleted the total resource by 

3.74Mt at a grade of 586ppm U3O8 and there are ROM stockpiles of 3.5Mt at a grade 
of 514ppm U3O8. 

 

17.15 Ore Reserve 
 

17.15.1 Material Definition 
 

The break-even cut off grade (BE cog) at the above mentioned parameters is: 

 

BE cog  = Processing Cost (US$/t) ÷ Revenue Rate (US$/t) ÷ Recovery 

= 248 ppm 



 
 

 

234

 

Allowing for fluctuations in the parameters the cut off grade for feed into the plant 

remains at 250ppm. 

 

Three discrete materials have been defined for the Langer Heinrich Uranium 

Project, these are ore, mineralised waste and clean waste. These definitions are 

summarised in Table 66. 
 

 

Table 66: Material Definitions 
 

Material  Cut Off Grade 

Ore  >250ppm 

Mineralised Waste 100ppm to 250 ppm 

Clean Waste <100ppm 

 

The introduction of mineralised waste is to allow one of two options be followed, 

(a) the mineralised waste will become heap leach ore should this process be 

developed and (b) this material carries sufficient uranium that if not processed it 

should be encapsulated within the clean waste dumps and therefore needs 

categorising and handled accordingly. 

 
17.15.2 Grade Dilution & Mining Losses 

 

The resource model is considered to incorporate dilution. No mining losses were 

applied to the ore inventories. 

 
17.15.3 Mineral Reserve 

 

The Ore Reserve, exclusive of ROM stockpiles, is summarized Table 67, and 

contains only the material defined in Section 17.15.1 as "Ore". 

 

Only Measured Resources have been used to report Proven Reserves and only 

Indicated Resources have been used to report Probable Reserves.  No Inferred 

Resources have been used in estimating the Mineral Reserve.

Total Ore Reserve 50.6 0.06 29,874 65.84 



 
 

 

235 

 

The Ore Reserves were estimated by Mr Andrew Hutson, BE (Mining), employed as 

Principal Mining Engineer by Paladin Energy.   

 
17.15.4 Key Assumptions 

 

Key assumptions are summarised below, other assumptions are documented in 

Section 23 Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development 

Properties and Production Properties. 

 

• Pit designs were prepared using industry standard mining software using 

the resource models, geotechnical slope recommendations and other cost 

parameters, established during the operations to date. 

• The revenue rate used in the estimate was US$60 per lb which is moderate 

when compared to the Ux spot price and existing term contracts  

• The Ore Reserve estimate is based on a simplified project analysis on a pre-

tax basis. 

 

Changes in the metal prices, metallurgical assumptions and operating costs will 

affect the size of the Ore Reserve. Higher operating costs and lower metallurgical 

recoveries would increase the cut off grade and so reduce the quantity of ore in the 

Ore Reserve. 

 

These reserves will form the basis of the detailed mine planning for the Project. The 

revised mine model will allow a remaining mine life of 11 years, including the 

expansion of processing capability to 6.0 million pounds per year, but does not 

include any contribution from the considerable amount of Inferred Resources 

within the open pit area or Detail 4, 6 or 7 outside the current footprint.

18.1 Reconciliation to Gencor Trial Mining Results 
 
The MIK model was cut to the surveyed pit and trench surfaces supplied, with top 

and bottom elevation limits of 624RL and 611RL applied to the pit to reflect the 
interval over which Gencor mining records apply.  Tonnes and grades reporting from 
the model are compared to those from Gencor's mining records (Anon., 1980; 
Fletcher & Kuschke, 1979) in Table 68 and Table 69.  The conditional statistics of all 
drill samples within the two trial mining volumes are also listed, with tonnages 
reporting above cut-offs based on sample counts assuming no clustering of the 
sample data.

Clearly the recoverable tonnages and grades predicted by the MIK model do not 

match recorded production very well.  It appears likely there are two reasons for this: 
 

• Trial mining was centred on an area of abnormally high-grade 
mineralisation.  Although indicator data from close-spaced drilling in 
the mega-trench and trial pit areas were used to inform the MIK 
model, the U3O8 grades in close-spaced drill holes were not used to 
calculate the conditional statistics that inform grade estimates in the 
model because of the effect of data clustering on those statistics.  The 
MIK estimates thus represent a more "average" view of the resources 
in Detail 1, i.e., the precision of local estimates has been sacrificed for 
accuracy of global estimates. 

 

• Gencor's mining has employed much greater selectivity than is 
considered achievable in the scale of operation being considered by 
LHU.  Figure 182 and Figure 183 shows the grade-tonnage curves 
deriving from the figures in Table 68 and Table 69.  Gencor have mined 
lower tonnages at far higher average grades than would be predicted 
from interrogation of the histograms of sample grades.  Because of the 
Volume-Variance Effect, the converse would normally be true, in 
sampling mineralisation by truck-loads rather than drill hole samples 
one would expect a higher tonnage at lower average grade to report 
as ore above any particular cut-off grade.  Gencor have achieved very 
selective mining.

It may be concluded that Gencor's mining records are of little use in assessing the 

reliability of the MIK estimates but they do indicate that highly selective separation 
of ore and waste can be achieved in Langer Heinrich mineralisation. As there was no 
additional drilling in 2005 or 2006 that influenced the resource estimations in the area 
of the Gencor trial mining no comparison to the current resource is included. 

 

18.2 Comparison to previous resource estimates 
 
 
The drilling campaigns in 2007 and 2008 were primarily targeted at increasing 

resource confidence by infilling to 50m x 50m in areas where there was historical 
drilling at 100m x 100m or greater and extending the resource in areas which had 
been poorly defined by previous drilling.

Table 71: Current resources (2008) 
 
Comparison between Table 70 and Table 71 shows that there has been a significant 

increase in resource tonnes in all categories and at all cut off grades.  As the 
methodologies and parameters employed in both resource estimations were 
substantially the same, the increase in Measured and Indicated can be attributed to 
infill drilling of the previously Inferred resources and the increase in Inferred 
resources is as a result of extensional drilling particularly in Detail 7. 

 
Reconciliation between grade control defined mined tonnes and grade indicates 

that there is a reasonable agreement between the mined grade and resource grade 
above a 250ppm U3O8 cut off grade however the resource model under reports 
tonnes. It appears that the MIK proportions per panel are low when compared to the 
effective grade control model. This is most likely as a result of the increased 
information available from the very close spaced blast hole drilling compared to 
relatively wide spaced 12.5m and 50m drilling. From this the indication is that the 
resource model is conservative in terms of tonnes but reasonably accurate on grade.

Table 72: Resource model vs. Grade Control reconciliation. 

 
A direct comparison of Resource model panels (50m x 50m x 3m) and Grade 

Control model blocks (4m x 4m x 3m) where there is a 100% correlation between 
Panels and blocks shows that there is a very good correlation between grades, with 
the Resource being 611ppm U3O8 and the Grade Control model 611ppm U3O8 .The 
Grade Control ore proportion at 0.739 for the same area is significantly higher than 
the Resource model proportion of 0.576. This figure can be directly related to tonnes 
of material. This relationship between Resource and Grade Control defined tonnes 
can also be seen in Table 72 above. It is presumed that this situation is caused by 



 
 

 

240

significantly increasing the effective sample density to better inform the grade control 
model blocks as to the quantity of mineralisation present. The grade of that material 
appears to be reasonably estimated.

19  Conclusions 
 
Sufficient quality control data are available to indicate that XRF assays of both 

Acclaim's and Paladin's RC drill samples are both accurate and precise.  Grades 
derived from down-hole radiometric logging compare closely to XRF assays, with a 
tendency for radiometric logs to return slightly higher U3O8 grades in high-grade 
mineralisation.  This may relate to the way disequilibrium corrections have been 
applied to the radiometric data.  The generally good agreement between U3O8 grades 
derived by the two methods indicates that they are compatible for the purposes of 
resource estimation. 

 
The reliability of grades derived from Gencor's percussion drilling can be assessed 

by comparing them to the Acclaim data, to bulk samples from test shafts and to 
diamond core samples.  U3O8 grades in percussion drill samples from above the 
water table compare closely to those from test shafts.  Comparisons to nearest 
neighbour radiometric U3O8 grades in Acclaim RC drill holes indicates a possible bias 
to about 10 per cent higher grades in the percussion drill samples at grades above 
about 800ppm but the comparison is not definitive.  Comparisons to grades from 
Gencor diamond core holes indicate that the core samples possibly under-represent 
the true grade of mineralisation, probably due to loss of matrix material during 
drilling. The most recent drilling by Paladin has served to reduce the reliance on the 
historical drilling by Gencor; it is proposed that this process of replacing the 
historical drilling is continued. 

 
Variograms of U3O8 grades indicate that the continuity of grades is relatively poor 

over even quite short distances, not unlike that observed in some gold deposits.  This 
is backed up by comparisons of nearest neighbour samples in drill holes and test 
shafts.  However the overall continuity of mineralisation, the geological continuity, is 
quite strong in plan-view.  Variograms based on areas of close-spaced sampling in 
Detail 1 have been used to guide modelling of the short-scale continuity of U3O8 
grades in other areas. 

 
Resources have been estimated using Multiple Indicator Kriging with block 

support correction.  Estimates assume that grade control sampling at about 5mE x 
5mN x 1mRL will be available prior to mining and a selective mining unit of 
approximately 5mE x 5mN x 2mRL.  It is now probable that mining will take place 
using grade control information based on a 3.2mx 3.6m grid with radiometric 
probing of blast holes and that the SMU size will be reduced to 4mx4mx3m.  Gencor's 
trial mining has demonstrated that highly selective mining can be achieved at 
relatively low production rates.  Picking of upper and lower ore contacts will be 
important in mining and the use of technology such as laser or DGPS excavation 
control may considerably reduce mining dilution. 

 
The resource definition drilling undertaken in 2005 and 2006 is considered to have 

been very successful in infilling and therefore increasing the resource confidence 
within existing areas of the deposit, as evidenced by the increase in quantity in both 
Measured and Indicated resource categories.  The drilling program has also extended 



 
 

 

242

the area of known mineralisation, particularly in the area of Detail 7 and to the 
northern edge of Detail 2, as evidenced by the overall increase in Inferred resources 
particularly in these areas.  

 
The drilling in 2005 and 2006 resulted in significant amounts of Inferred Resource 

being estimated in the northern areas of Detail 2. A substantial portion of this 
material was located at depth within a linear East – West feature within the 
paleochannel. The infill drilling undertaken in 2007 and 2008 was aimed at providing 
sufficient sample density in this area to estimate Measured and Indicated Resources. 
The drilling achieved this with significant success. The other aim of the drilling was 
to provide information for defining the ultimate limits of the resource and to confirm 
mineralisation continuity in Detail 7.  This was again successful with substantial 
amounts of Inferred Resources being estimated in Detail 7 and previous gaps in the 
resource model removed. The resource close off drilling was less successful with a 
number of areas on the periphery of the resource remaining open. 

 
The Ore Reserve estimate, exclusive of ROM stockpiles, is summarized below, 

only Measured Resources have been used to report Proven Reserves and only 
Indicated Resources have been used to report Probable Reserves.  No Inferred 
Resources have been used in estimating the Mineral Reserve.

Langer Heinrich estimated Ore Resource, depleted for mining 

 

Key assumptions are summarised below, other assumptions are documented in 

Section 23 Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development 

Properties and Production Properties. 

 

• Pit designs were prepared using industry standard mining software using 

the resource models, geotechnical slope recommendations and other cost 

parameters, established during the operations to date. 

 

• The revenue rate used in the estimate was US$60 per lb which is moderate 

when compared to the Ux spot price and existing term contracts. 

  

• The Ore Reserve estimate is based on a simplified project analysis on a pre-

tax basis. 

 

Changes in the metal prices, metallurgical assumptions and operating costs will 

affect the size of the Ore Reserve. Higher operating costs and lower metallurgical 



 
 

 

243 

recoveries would increase the cut off grade and so reduce the quantity of ore in the 

Ore Reserve. 

 

These reserves will form the basis of the detailed mine planning for the Project. 

The revised mine model will allow a remaining mine life of 11 years, including the 

expansion of processing capability to 6.0 million pounds per year, but does not 

include any contribution from the considerable amount of Inferred Resources within 

the open pit area or outside the current footprint.

20  Recommendations 
 
Paladin has developed the Langer Heinrich Uranium Orebody into an open cut 

mining operation treating approximately 1.5Mt of ore per annum to produce 
approximately 2.6Mlb of uranium oxide for the export market following successful 
completion of the Bankable Feasibility Study. 

 
Following continued improvement in the market for uranium Paladin has 

commenced a Stage II upgrade to the processing plant with the intention of lifting 
production levels to 3.7Mlb per annum from 2009. Planning is also underway for a 
Stage III upgrade to ultimately lift production to 6.0Mlb per annum. Heap leach 
studies are also in progress. 

 
Paladin now proposes to undertake additional drilling programs to further define 

the Mineral Resources within the tenement. These programs will be designed to 
progressively infill areas within the existing resource which are currently classified as 
Inferred with the intention of elevating the resource categorisation. It is also 
anticipated that additional extension drilling of the resource will be undertaken 
particularly in the area of Detail 7. 
 
It is suggested that the budget for this drilling be:- 
 
Period:  June 2008 to June 2009,  
Currency: Namibian dollars (N$7 = US$1) 
 

Expenditure Classification Total N$ 
Labour and Drilling 3,321,000 
Consultants and Contractors 250,000 
Materials and Utilities 105,500 
Transportation and Communication 136,500 
Outside Services 2,721,000 
Insurance 120,000 
Accommodation, Meals and Expenses 250,000 
Other expenses      350,000 
Total 7,253,000 

Table 73: Budget for Resource definition drilling 
 

It is expected that resource definition and infill drilling activities will take place on 
an annual basis for a number of years and will be budgeted for on a routine basis. In 
addition to the above, ongoing mining and processing operations will take place at 
the site.

23  Additional Requirements for  Technical  Reports  on 
Development Propert ies  and Production 
Properties  

 

23.1 Mining Operations 
 
Mining is undertaken by a specialist mining contractor who undertakes out drilling, 

loading, hauling, dumping, performs equipment maintenance, and provides blasting 

products and services.   

 

Mining is undertaken by conventional open pit methods, utilising excavators coupled 

with standard mine trucks operated 20 hours/day, nominally 350 days/year.   

 

Ore and waste mining is undertaken by excavator and truck on a campaign basis, 

which is managed to ensure sufficient stockpiles on the ROM pad to allow blending to the 

plant continue uninterrupted. Working benches are 3 m high. 

 

23.2 Open Pit Geotechnical 
 
Limited geotechnical investigations have been undertaken by the operations but 

considering the shallow nature of the mineralization and low slope risk for the project this 

is considered satisfactory. 

 

The current pit has slopes up to 70ο for 20-25m and is in very good condition, as is the 

existing test pit which is approximately 20 years old.  

 

Considering that the current pit design will be deeper and the pit walls will be 

developed below the groundwater table, an overall slope of 60 degrees face slopes with 

5m berms at 16-24m vertical intervals have been adopted in the pit designs. 

 

Some geotechnical investigations may be required as development moved into the 

deeper areas in 2 to 3 years. 

 

23.3 Open Pit hydrology 
 
A minimal amount of free ground water flow has been encountered to date in the pits. 

Pumping of this ground water is minimal considering the shallow depth of the pits, the 

development of relatively large pit areas and the climate at the project site and as such 

has minimal impact on the operation. 

 

Pumping capacity is available for storm water inflows 



 
 

 

247

 

23.4 Pit Optimisation 
 
Whittle Four-X software (Four-X) was used to generate optimal shells for the deposit 

based on analysis of the resource model. The pit optimisation runs processed all material 

above the pre-determined cut-off grades; this was used to define the pit shells for both the 

Ore Reserve and the Mining Inventory which includes the Inferred Resource. 

 

The cost parameters used in the reserve estimation are now well established and as 

such their inclusion can be reasonably justified.  

 

• Average Mining Cost   US$2.80   /t mined 

• Average Processing Cost  US$24.40 /t ore 

• Fixed Owner Costs    US$8.00   /t ore 

 

The revenue rate used in the estimate was US$60 per lb which is moderate when 

compared to the Ux spot price and existing term contracts. Plant recovery is as per 

current operating practices which average 90% over the long term. 

 

23.5 Mine Design 
 
Based on the pit optimisation results, the mine design has created two pits, one 8km 

long and the second 1km, that can be mined in a number of smaller mining areas. This 

staged development allows for additional open faces for ore blending and therefore can 

reduce the size of the stockpiles at the ROM pad and allow a smooth production profile 

for both the mine and the plant. The pit design is shown in Figure 184. 

 

The resource model for the project uses quite large panel size in the horizontal 

dimensions (50mEx50mNx3mRL), within which the ore tonnages are statistically defined 

for each panel selectively at a range of cut-off grades. This approach is sufficient to 

produce global resource and reserve estimates, but does not provide sufficient resolution 

for the detailed pit designs. 

 

Current practice is to utilise the ore reserve pit design as a guide for the grade control 

drilling which is undertaken in advance of mining to generate detailed pit designs and 

exactly define the pit limits. For this reason ramps are not included in the ore reserve pit 

design. 

 

Resource modelling to date has proved that the Inferred Resources can be upgraded to 

Measured or Indicated at a high proportion, as such the pit designs generated for the ore 

reserve include the Inferred Resource located in the immediate area of the Measured and 

Indicated Resource. 



 
 

 

248

 

This Inferred Resource that is included in the pit design is not included in the ore 

reserve but is included as processing plant feed in the subsequent mine planning. 

 

Pit designs were completed for Details 1, 2, 3 and 5 areas which will provide feed to 

the plant for a further 14 years of mine life, of which the ore reserve accounts for 11 years. 

 

The basic mine design criteria can be summarised as: 

• Minimum mining width     40 m 

• Bench Height         3 m 

• Inter-ramp Slope Angle     60° 

• Dual lane ramps and surface roads  25 m 

• Maximum ramp gradient     10%

23.6 Production Forecast 
 
The intention of the schedule was to incorporate the expansion of the processing plant to 

6.0 million pounds per year. This requires achieving, then maintaining a production rate 

through the crusher of 5.3 Mtpa at a head grade of approximately 600ppm U3O8. 

 

To achieve this mining takes place in 2 to 3 mining areas in any period and three 

excavators operating, up from the single excavator currently in operation. A total of 240.1 Mt 

(100.0 Mbcm) of material is mined over the life of the ore reserve, at a stripping ratio of 2.7:1. 

 

The mining rate required to maintain consistent feed into the processing plant is required 

to rise steadily from the current levels of 3.0 Mbcm/yr, doubling within twelve months 

peaking at 9.0 Mbcm within 3 years. Figure 185 shows the production schedule. 

 

 Figure 185: Mine Production Schedule  

 

Production of uranium can be achieved at, or above, the target levels for the life of the ore 

reserve. The potential for continuing this production level is regarded as high, as the nature 

of the deposit suggests that the Inferred Resources outside the current footprint should be 

upgraded in classification and provide an additional 6 – 8 years life 

 

 Figure 186 shows the annualized plant feed and uranium production. 

 

In Year 3 of the schedule, when the processing plant expansion is completed the feed 

grade into the plant drops to the average ore grade remaining in the design. This drop in

feed grade ensures that no significant low grade stockpiles are generated during the mine life 

and as such reduces the quantity of ore rehandled and eliminates the low grade tail 

commonly seen toward the end of a mine life. 

 Figure 186: Plant Production Schedule 

 

Due to the nature of the deposit being long, narrow and relatively shallow backfilling of 

the pit is both an economic and practical method of waste management for both the mine 

waste and the plant tailings. 

 

Whilst the pits are being developed the mine waste will be placed in ex-pit dumps located 

on the north and south sides of the pit, and used to form the boundaries of tailings storage 

facilities, both in and ex-pit. One backfilling can commence it is envisaged that waste will be 

placed into the mined voids to such a height that tailings can be placed on top taking into 

consideration the water table and the production schedules. 

 

23.7 Economic Summary 
 

The 67.3 Mt of ore to be treated by the project, which includes the Inferred Resource 

within the pit design is estimated to produce 77.1 Mlb tonnes of Uranium Oxide (U3O8). Of 

this production 78% is classified as either Proved or Probable Reserves and this is the base 

around which the economic analysis has been undertaken. Based on a U3O8 price of 

US$60/lb, it is anticipated that US$3589 M would be realised in revenue (pre capex, opex, 

royalties and taxes).

The cash flow summary includes the direct capital cost to establish the project and the 

costs incurred to date; these are included to allow a complete economic analysis to be 

undertaken. 
 

Table 74 shows the cash flows used to estimate the Mineral Reserves and shows a net 

positive cash flow of US$1569 M, and a payback period of four years when imputed or actual 

interest is taken into account. Year 12 shows a negative cash flow caused by an increase in 

the tonnage on inferred material that must be mined to allow further access to the Ore 

Reserve.  

 

The results of the financial model indicate that the NPV for the project, discounted at 8% 

per year, is US$781 M, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 71% and the Total Operating Costs 

including Working Capital and Sustaining Capital averages US$29 /lb of U3O8. 
 

The sensitivity analyses completed for the mining model encompassed the following 

range of variation in key inputs: 

• Uranium Oxide (U3O8) Price: Variations of -20%; -10%; +10%; and +20% of base 

case pricing; 

• Operating Costs: Variations of -20%; -10%; +10%; and +20% of base case costing; 

and 

• Capital Costs: Variations of -20%; -10%; +10%; and +20% in total capital costs, 

including Owner's Costs, EPCM and sustaining capital. 

• Sensitivity analysis on grade has a direct correlation to that for metal price and as 

such is not included. 
 

In assessing the sensitivity of the project returns, each of these parameters is varied 

independently of the others. Combined beneficial or adverse variations in any of these 

parameters will have a more marked effect on the economics of the project than the 

individual variations considered, while variations in opposite directions concurrently will 

lessen the net impact of the movements. 
 

The sensitivity analysis convention is that negative sensitivities are adjustments that 

reduce project value, i.e. increased capital and operating costs are presented as negative 

changes; conversely, decreased capital and operating costs are presented as positive changes. 
 

Table 75 presents the results of the sensitivity analyses.

23.8 Environmental Considerations 
 
Langer Heinrich Uranium reflects within its financial statement a mine closure provision of 

US$3.8M and a rehabilitation provision of US$4.4M to cover the eventual closure of the mine and 

rehabilitation of the mine site. These provisions are expected to be varied during the the life of 

the mine in accordance with standard accounting practices. A nominal value Environmental 

Bond has been established in compliance with current Namibian mining laws. Mine Closure 

planning studies are currently underway at the mine site with the intention of completing an 

comprehensive Mine Closure Plan in the near future. 

 

 

23.9 Marketing Contracts 
 
Transactions in the international nuclear fuel industry are principally based upon multi-year 

or term sales contracts for products and services.  The near-term (or spot) market for natural 

uranium concentrates (U3O8) involves material deliveries within 6-12 months of contracting.  

Historically, the annual volume of transactions taking place on the near-term uranium market 

equates to no more than 10-20% of the total annual uranium demand. 

 



 
 

 

255

For example, in 2005, aggregate global demand for natural uranium concentrates based upon 

reactor requirements was estimated to be 172 million pounds U3O8while total spot market 

volume was 35 million pounds U3O8 (20%).  The previous year (2004), worldwide uranium 

demand stood at 173.3 million pounds U3O8while near-term transactions totalled 18.6 million 

pounds U3O8 (11%). 

 

Paladin Energy Ltd. has adopted an overall uranium market and sales strategy emphasizing 

multi-year uranium sales agreements for project output.  Experienced international uranium 

marketing personnel tailor uranium sales proposals based upon currently evolving commercial 

terms and conditions which continue to be increasingly favourable to uranium suppliers after 

more than two decades of a "buyers market"." 

 

What this strategy incorporates is optimization of project sales through term agreements with 

reliable nuclear utilities in all three of the principal geographic regions: Western Europe, North 

American and Asia/Pacific.  Senior marketing professionals maintain regular contact and hold 

one-on-one meetings with select nuclear utilities in all three regions 

 

As the uranium production industry has contracted, the buying sector has experienced greatly 

diminished abilities to diversify uranium supply sources.  While some of the larger uranium 

suppliers such as Cameco Corporation and AREVA/Cogema tout their abilities to deliver from 

several sources, nuclear fuel buyers remain committed to broad diversification policies for future 

uranium sourcing including not only companies but also production regions/countries. 

 

Regarding the planned production from the Langer Heinrich Uranium, corporate marketing 

personnel have designed uranium supply proposals which reflect the needs of the project 

including, if appropriate, recapture of capital investment in a timely manner.  

 

Based upon current uranium market conditions, Paladin management will not offer either 

annual quantity flexibilities nor contract extension options unless adequate compensation is 

received from the buying organization. 

 

For example, in the past, annual quantity flexibilities (declared by the buying organization) 

have reached as high as 30-40% of the annual nominal delivery volumes as uranium sellers 

competed in a severely depressed term market.  At the present time, Paladin plans to offer zero 

annual quantity options and only provide such flexibilities for additional price compensation. 

 

Moreover, the vast majority of term uranium sales agreements executed prior to 2004 

contained annual extension options, again, at the full discretion of the buying utility.  At times, 

such extension options might provide for addition delivery years, under the current contractual 

terms and conditions for 3-4 years subsequent to the base term period.  To even make the 

situation more difficult for the suppliers, in some cases, these extensions options were provided 

on a year-by-year basis so the utility was able to extend the agreement each year for an additional 

year's volume. 

 

In the important area of term pricing, initial base prices for new term sales agreements have 

risen markedly over the past 24-36 months, currently standing at or above US$80.00 per pound 

U3O8.  That initial base price is subject to future adjustment in response to changes in specified 



 
 

 

256

economic indicators.  However, due to evolving market conditions, Paladin does not intend to 

enter into any forward delivery commitments under pricing provisions which limit potential 

upside improvement. 

 

When it is deemed appropriate by Paladin management to enter into future delivery 

agreements under market price conditions, these pricing mechanisms will favour the seller to the 

maximum extent possible.  Minimum purchase prices will be incorporated which closely reflect 

then-current market conditions and begin at only slightly less than the prevailing term base price.  

Moreover, Paladin intends to pursue future floor price adjustments based upon anticipated 

upward uranium price trends. 

 

The base periods for term uranium sales agreements will be designed to facilitate project 

construction and start-up as well as provide the opportunity to capture future market conditions.  

Initial contract lengths of 3-4 years are being contemplated unless the buying organization is 

willing to provide necessary price protection for the project. 

 

Paladin marketing will pursue contracting with preferred utility customers which have 

demonstrated a high level of customer-supplier relationship building in the past.  These utilities 

have already been identified by marketing management and will be primary contracting targets 

for the continuing phases of Langer Heinrich operations. 

 

23.10 Other Contracts 
 

Mining, transportation, handling, insurance and reagent contracts rates and charges are in line 

with industry norms.
