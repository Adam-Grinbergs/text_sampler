1.0 Executive Summary 
 

The 67,055.9 hectare Tagish Lake Project, NTS map sheets 104M/8 & 9, 104N/5 & 12, 
is located primarily between Tagish and Atlin Lakes, 15-35 km west of the community of 
Atlin in northwestern British Columbia. Atlin is approximately 180 km by road southeast 
of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. The property is situated in the Atlin Mining Division with 
a latitude and longitude of 59°27'N, 134°15.5'W. The claims comprising the Tagish Lake 
Project are registered to Blind Creek Resources Limited of Vancouver, British Columbia. 
 
Two crustal scale sub-parallel, northwest trending faults transect the Tagish Lake 
Project, the Nahlin Fault Zone in the northeastern property area and the Llewellyn Fault 
Zone through the Wann River area. The faults are grossly coincident with terrane 
boundaries. A belt of anomalously high regional gold-arsenic and antimony 
geochemistry extends the length of the Tagish Lake area, coextensive with the 
Llewellyn fault. 
 
The Tagish Lake Project is underlain by Carboniferous to Triassic oceanic rocks of the 
northern Cache Creek Terrane to the east of the Nahlin Fault Zone, Devonian to 
Permian metamorphic rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane to the west of the Llewellyn 
Fault Zone and Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary strata of the Whitehorse Trough 
between the faults. The above lithologies are cut by Late Cretaceous to Tertiary 
intrusions and intruded by Eocene plugs and dykes and overlain by associated volcanic 
rocks and basal coarse clastic sedimentary rocks of the Sloko Group. 
 
Potential exists within the Tagish Lake Project for epithermal gold-silver (Engineer Gold 
Camp), polymetallic vein (Ben-My-Chree), gold quartz vein (potential in Graham Creek 
area), copper (Whitehorse Copper) and gold skarn (TP in northern Tagish region) 
deposits, and possible Kuroko-style volcanogenic massive sulphide (Tulsequah Chief) 
deposits within Yukon-Tanana Terrane and copper-molybdenum-gold porphyry and 
gold-silver rich Eskay type shallow subaqueous hot spring deposits within the 
Whitehorse Trough. 
 
Seven Minfile occurrences are documented on the Tagish Lake Project, the Kim (109.7 
g/t Ag, 0.7 g/t Au and 4.0% Cu) and Douglas polymetallic vein showings in the 
southwestern property area, the Kirkland showing and Gleaner prospect covering 
epithermal veins near the Engineer Mine, the Graham Creek placer and upstream 
extent in the northern property area, and the Brown polymetallic vein showing and the 
copper-nickel-platinum-palladium Anyox-Rodeo prospect within the Wann River area. 
 
Exploration by Blind Creek Resources Limited has focused on the Wann River area 
which straddles the Llewellyn Fault Zone, a system of northwest trending, steeply 
northeast dipping structures. A 160° trending 800m long by 180m wide corridor with 
quartz vein mineralization has been identified with Devonian to Triassic Boundary 
Range biotite-feldspar-quartz schist in the southwest, and a faulted panel of Upper 
Triassic Stuhini andesite and quartz eye porphyry in the northeast. 



 
 2  

Mineralization at the Brown showing within the corridor consists of tetrahedritefreibergite, 
chalcopyrite, malachite, azurite, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite and galena. A sample collected 
from the Brown adit by the author in 2010, returning 8.6 g/t Au and 420 g/t Ag over 0.3m, 
confirmed previous results by the British Columbia Geological Survey from a chip sample 
(assaying 8.6 g/t Au and 315.38 g/t Ag) and verified the presence of significant gold-silver 
values on the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake Project.  

Results from grab samples from the Wann River area include 263 g/t Au, 1350 g/t Ag, 2.75% 
Cu, 4.45% Pb and 1.36% Zn hosted by quartz from tailings in the Lum trenches, and 15.9 g/t 
Au, 440 g/t Ag, and 1.04% Pb from the Newfie, 17.2 g/t Au from the Trail, including 32.9 g/t Au, 
1180 g/t Ag and 3.35% Cu and 3.79% Pb from float, and 126 g/t Ag from the River quartz vein 
showings.  

Based on the widespread indications of precious and variable base metal mineralization within 
a prospective 800m by 180m wide corridor, association with the Llewellyn Fault Zone, lack of 
overall exposure, and proximity and similarities to the past producing Engineer Mine, a 
significant exploration program is recommended on the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake 
Project. A program consisting of 2,000m of diamond drilling to evaluate the southeastern 
sector of the corridor, a ground magnetic geophysical survey to aid in geological mapping, and 
additional prospecting, mapping and sampling is recommended on Wann River with a budget 
of $950,000. A budget of $50,000 is recommended to evaluate the Engineer portion by 
mapping, prospecting and sampling.

2.4       Limitations, Restrictions and Assumptions 
 
The author has assumed that the previous documented work on the property is valid 
and has not encountered any information to discredit such work. Two check samples 
were collected from the old adit in 2010 by the author and are consistent with the tenor 
of mineralization previously reported, but do not constitute detailed quantitative check 
analyses. 
 
 
2.5 Scope  
 
This report describes the geology, previous exploration history and mineral potential of 
the Tagish Lake Project. Research included a review of the historical work that related 
to the immediate and surrounding area of the property. Regional geological data and 
current exploration information have been reviewed to determine the geological setting 
of the mineralization and to obtain an indication of the level of industry activity in the 
area. The property was examined and evaluated by the author on July 27, 2010 for 
Blind Creek Resources Limited, the registered owner of the property. Previous work by 
Blind Creek Resources Limited consisted of geological mapping, prospecting, rock and 
minor reconnaissance conventional and MMI soil geochemistry, and a limited ground 
magnetic survey (Aspinall, 2010). 
 
Based on the literature review, property examinations and review of the data and results 
from the 2005 to 2010 exploration programs, funded by Blind Creek Resources Limited 
recommendations are made for the next phase of exploration work. An estimate of costs 
has been made based on current rates for drilling, geophysical surveys and professional 
fees in British Columbia.

2.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The author has relied in part upon work and reports completed by others in previous 
years in the preparation of this report. Although the author personally collected samples 
to verify the tenor of mineralization exposed on the property, thorough checks to confirm 
the results of such prior work and reports have not been done. The author has no 
reason to doubt the correctness of such work and reports. Unless otherwise stated the 
author has not independently confirmed the accuracy of the data.   
 
Further, while claim data, title documents and option agreements were reviewed for this 
study, this report does not constitute nor is it intended to represent a legal, or any other, 
opinion as to the validity of the title and exact size of the claims.

The Tagish Lake Project has been subdivided into five separate blocks, shown in detail 
on the associated figures, covering prospective gold-silver zones: Wann River (Figure 
3), Edgar - Nelson Lakes Llewellyn Fault Zone Extension (Figure 4), Mt. Switzer - Ben 
My Chree Zone (Figure 5), Torres - Graham - Golden Gate Zone (Figure 6), and 
Engineer (Figure 7). 
 
The claims are located within the Traditional Territories of the Carcross/Tagish and 
Taku River Tlingit First Nations as identified in the Statements of Intents of the First 
Nations. The land in which the mineral claims are situated is Crown Land. The mineral 
claims fall under the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Government. Three mineral 
reserves occur in the Tagish Lake Project. Mineral Reserve Number 1004762 covers a 
portion of the Edgar - Nelson Lakes Llewellyn Fault Zone Extension, approximately 2 
km southeast of the Wann River area, and Mineral Reserve Numbers 1004742 and the 
southwest edge of 1004802 cover a portion of the Torres - Graham - Golden Gate Zone 
(Figure 9). Compensation for the loss of the claim area is generally negotiated with the 
British Columbia government. Atlin Park borders the Torres - Graham - Golden Gate 
Zone on the south. 
 
One deeded parcel of land (DL4360), with a small cabin and a 2 km access road from 
Tagish Lake is located within the Wann River area (Figure 8). The parcel pertains only 
to surface rights and not mineral title (Aspinall, 2010). All other surveyed parcels of land 
shown without a number designation on Figure 8 have expired and pose no conflict to 
mineral claim titles (Aspinall, 2010).

The Engineer portion of the Tagish Lake Project excludes the Engineer Mine property 
consisting of 76.76 hectares held by BCGold Corp, Vancouver British Columbia. The 
mine tenure comprises five deeded land parcels that precisely overlie five crown grants,  
DL 19, DL 200, DL 918, DL 106 and DL 20 (Figure 8). Two other crown grants, DL 250 
and DL 914, are located southeast of the Engineer Mine and are also excluded from the 
project (Aspinall, 2010). Three other deeded parcels of land, DL1264, 967 and 968 
occur within the Engineer portion of the Tagish Lake Project (Figure 8). The parcels 
pertain only to surface rights and not mineral title (Aspinall, 2010).

Certain types of exploration activity require a Mines Act Permit, issued by the British 
Columbia Government, prior to conducting work on a mineral property. The proposed 
helicopter supported drill program on the Wann River area requires a permit, which has 
been obtained (Aspinall, 2010). Other permits governed by laws and regulations 
pertaining to development, mining, production, taxes, labour standards, occupational 
health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine 
safety and other matters, may be required as the project progresses. 
 
To the author's knowledge the Tagish Lake property area is not subject to any 
environmental liability. 
 
 
  
5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
 
5.1 Access, Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The project area is accessible by helicopter, float plane or boat from Atlin, located 15-35 
km to the east, or alternatively by boat or barge from the communities of Tagish and 
Carcross, located 90 km to the north. During winter months the property is easily 
accessible from Atlin by skidoo, provided lake ice is firm. Atlin is located approximately 
180 km by road southeast of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory via the Alaska Highway and 
Highway 7. The communities of Tagish and Carcross are connected to the Alaska 
Highway by road, and Carcross is connected to Skagway, Alaska, an all season port, by 
both road and railroad.  
 
In the Wann River area one good 1.5 km ATV trail is present on the east side of the 
Wann River, leading from Tagish Lake to an old dam site (Figures 2 and 3). Suitable 
camp locations exist along the shore of Tagish Lake with the recent camp situated at 
6590367mN, 542031mE. A walking trail was established from the camp to the vein 
occurrences along the west side of the Wann River. There are six cabins in the lower 
Wann River area and a trailer camp and dock at the Engineer Mine on the east shore of 
Tagish Lake (Aspinall, 2010).   
 
Atlin is the closest town, with a population of approximately 400. Facilities include an 
airstrip, helicopter service, grocery stores, health centre, police station, a service 
station, post office, accommodation and restaurants. Some heavy equipment and a 
small mining oriented labour force are available for contract mining work. Complete 
services are available in Whitehorse, approximately 2 hours by all-weather highway, 
180 km northwest of Atlin (Figure 1).

5.2     Physiography, Climate and Infrastructure 
 
The Tagish Lake Project generally covers an area between Tagish and Atlin Lakes 
within northwestern British Columbia (Figure 1). It includes the Wann River valley, 
where the majority of the work has been concentrated, between Tagish Lake and Edgar 
Lake along the southeast shore of Tagish Lake. The topography is gentle (Figure 2). 
Elevations range from about 700m above sea level (ASL) along Tagish Lake to 1450m 
in the northeastern property area. Lower elevation slopes, below treeline at 1100 to 
1400m ASL, are forested with lodge-pole pine, spruce, balsam and cottonwood trees 
with sparse hemlock. Outcrop is sparse, except along the Wann River, but amounts to 
less than 1%.   
 
In the Wann River area water is available from the Wann River, a fast flowing river once 
studied as a possible site for a hydroelectric development  (Figures 2 and 4). Elevation 
of Tagish Lake at the northwest end of the Project area is 656m ASL, while  Edgar Lake 
2.5 kilometres to the southeast is 765m, a difference of 109m. The lower section of 
Wann River drains from Edgar Lake into Tagish Lake, and is extremely fast flowing, 
even grading to rapids in part of its course. Ling cod, but no salmon, lake trout, grayling 
or other sport fish are reported in Edgar and Nelson Lakes. Tagish Lake contains lake 
trout and grayling, but is not salmon bearing. (Aspinall, 2010). 
 
The project area lies within the Tagish district of northwestern British Columbia with 
long, cold winters and short, mild to cool summers. Due to proximity to the Boundary 
Ranges, the area is strongly influenced by coastal weather systems and attendant 
higher precipitation patterns. Summers are moderately cool to hot, with average 
temperatures of 5°C to 18°C. Winters are cold, with average temperatures of -11 (high) 
to -20°C (low). The exploration season lasts from mid May until October. "Boating on 
Tagish Lake can be hazardous and should only be undertaken by persons with 
experience in operating large boat craft."  (Aspinall, 2010).  
 
Although there does not appear to be any topographic or physiographic impediments, 
and suitable lands appear to be available for a potential mine, including mill, tailings 
storage, heap leach and waste disposal sites, engineering studies have not been 
undertaken and there is no guarantee that such areas will be available within the 
subject property. The nearest source of hydroelectric power is Atlin, British Columbia, 
which commenced production in April, 2009. 
 
 
 
6.0 HISTORY 
 
The Tagish Lake Project lies proximal to the historic Engineer gold mine of BCGold 
Corp., reportedly discovered in 1899 by engineers surveying a possible southern route 
for the White Pass and Yukon Railway (Mihalynuk, 1999). The Kirkland (now part of the 
Tagish Lake Group) and the Gleaner groups of mineral claims (partly within the Tagish 
Lake Group) were subsequently staked adjacent to the Engineer Mine (Minister of 
Mines, 1913). 



 
 

 

15   

 
The Kirkland group (also referred to as Kirtland) consisted of six mineral claims owned 
by Captain W. Hawthorn, R.N. and Thomas Kirkland of Atlin. Two shallow shafts (3 and 
4m) were sunk directly south of the present Engineer Mine property on veins, trending 
NE/88°NW and 023°/76°SE, resembling those at the Engineer Mine (Minister of Mines, 
1914). Some gold was reported (Minister of Mines, 1914). The Gleaner group consisted 
of three mineral claims and a fraction, situated on the east side of the Engineer Mine 
(Minister of Mines, 1914). Five veins were reported that showed small amounts of native 
gold, pyrite and iron oxide (Cairnes, 1913).  
 
Seven Minfile occurrences are documented by the British Columbia Geological Survey 
on the Tagish Lake Project, which include the Kim showing (Minfile Number 104M 063) 
in the southwestern property area, the Douglas showing (Minfile Number 104M 092), in 
the southern property area, the Kirkland showing (Minfile Number 104M 015) and part 
of the Gleaner prospect (Minfile Number 104M 016), both proximal to the Engineer 
Mine, the Graham Creek placer (Minfile Number 104M 023), and upstream extent, in 
the northern property area and the Brown polymetallic vein showing (Minfile Number 
104M 026) and the copper-nickel-platinum-palladium Anyox-Rodeo prospect (Minfile 
Number 104M 017) within the Wann River area. 
 
An old adit is exposed at the Brown polymetallic vein showing on the southwest side of 
the Wann River at 6590036mN, 542629mE, Nad 83, Zone 8 projection. Two adits and a 
pit are documented at the copper-nickel-platinum-palladium Anyox-Rodeo showing 
(Cathro, 1968). Two adits and several trenches occur on the Gleaner prospect and two 
shafts and several trenches on the Kirkland showing in the Engineer portion of the 
property. 
 
The work completed by various operators as documented in British Columbia Minfile, 
various government publications of the British Columbia Geological Survey or its 
predecessors and the Geological Survey of Canada and company publications 
(primarily available as assessment reports filed with the government), is tabulated 
below. 
 
1913-14? Excavation of shafts at Kirkland showing and adits at Gleaner on veins 

similar to that of the adjacent Engineer Mine with some gold reported 
(Minister of Mines, 1913-14). 

 
1918-20? At the Brown showing a 10m adit was driven "…showing two seams of 

quartz carrying galena and blende" (Minister of Mines, 1918). An open cut 
above the adit exposes quartz mineralized with galena sphalerite and 
freibergite and a number of open cuts along the shore (Lum trenches) 
expose small, discontinuous veins of quartz (Minister of Mines, 1918). 
Possible excavation of the adits and pit on Anyox-Rodeo showing. 

 
1965-66 Four showings were discovered by Falconbidge Nickel Mines Limited, two 

copper and one lead-zinc skarn occurrences and a chalcopyrite bearing 
vein/fracture filling in the Kim showing area (Chateris, 1966). Sampling of 



 
 

 

16   

chalcopyrite and quartz with malachite staining at the Kim showing, in one 
of several poorly exposed shear zones hosted by granodiorite, returned 
109.7 g/t Ag, 0.7 g/t Au and 4.0% Cu from a 30 to 50 piece sample across 
4.5 to 6m (McDougall, 1966). 

 
1968 Program of linecutting and a 11 line km magnetic and electromagnetic 

geophysical survey on the Brown and Anyox-Rodeo showing areas by 
Idaho Silver Mines Ltd., identifying significant anomalies (Cathro,1968).  

 
1980 Geological mapping, geochemical sampling and diamond drilling of 306m 

in 3 holes on Gleaner showing area, by Windarra Minerals Limited under 
option from Mr. K. Lumsden, with maximum results of 1.0 g/t Au, 8.7 g/t 
Ag over 11.7m, including  2.1 g/t Au, 44.6 g/t Ag over 1.7m in DDH 80-1  
(Morgan, 1981).  

 
1993 Prospecting, trenching, rock sampling, 3.5 line km of grid, preliminary 

VLF-EM survey, adit rehabilitation, mapping and sampling, and a 
geological investigation on Gleaner showing area, held by Mr. K. Lumsden 
(Brownlee, 1993).  

 
1993 Road building and trenching program on Kirkland showing area, held by 

Mr. K. Lumsden (Brownlee, 1993). Results could not be located. 
 
 
 
7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
 
7.1 Regional Geology  (Figures 10 to 12) 
 
The BC Geological Branch completed 1:100,000 scale mapping in the Tagish Lake area 
in the 1990's. The regional geology below is summarized from this mapping (Mihalynuk, 
1999). 
 
The Tagish Lake Project is situated at the boundary between the north-northwest 
trending Coast Plutonic Belt in the west and the lntermontane Belt in the east. The Coast 
Intrusions are mainly the result of Late Cretaceous and Tertiary tectonism and 
magmatism.  
 
Two crustal scale sub-parallel northwest trending faults, transect the Tagish Lake 
Project, the Nahlin Fault Zone in the northeastern property area and the Llewellyn Fault 
Zone (LFZ) through the Wann River and Edgar - Nelson Lakes - Llewellyn Fault Zone 
Extension portions of the project area. The faults are grossly coincident with terrane 
boundaries and appear to have been intermittently active from Late Triassic into Tertiary 
time.  
 
 
 



 
 

 

17   

Weakly metamorphosed, Carboniferous to Triassic oceanic plateau remnants of the 
northern Cache Creek Terrane occur to the east of the Nahlin Fault Zone and are 
exposed in the northeast portion of the Torres-Graham-Golden Gate Zone of the Tagish 
Lake Project. Triassic arc, clastic arc apron, and overlying Jurassic basinal sedimentary 
strata of the Whitehorse Trough occur between the faults and underlie the Engineer, 
eastern Wann River and most of the Torres-Graham-Golden Gate portions of the 
project area. Two suites of metamorphic rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane occur to 
the west of the Llewellyn Fault Zone, a pre-Mississippian, siliciclastic succession of 
pericratonic origin, and a Devonian to Permian suite correlative with volcanic arc strata 
of the Stikine Terrane. Rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane are exposed in the Wann 
River, Mt. Switzer - Ben My Chree and Edgar - Nelson Lakes - Llewellyn Fault Zone 
Extension portions of the Tagish Lake Project. 
 
The above lithologies are intruded by Late Cretaceous to Tertiary bodies of the Coast 
Plutonic Complex and intruded and overlain by Eocene plugs, dykes and associated 
volcanic rocks and basal coarse clastic sedimentary rocks of the Sloko Group. 
  
The dominant structural feature within the project area is the Llewellyn Fault Zone, a  
system of northwest trending, steeply northeast dipping structures. In British Columbia 
the Llewellyn Fault Zone is a locally discreet, near vertical structure tens of metres wide, 
up to a maximum of one to three km with lithologies commonly silicified, argillically 
altered, and pervasively cleaved within the fault zone commonly with ductile 
deformation fabrics (Mihalynuk, 1999). 
 
Mineralization within the Tagish Lake area is intimately associated with volcanic centres 
of the Sloko Group and Llewellyn fault-linked structures. Examples include the past 
producing Engineer gold-silver Mine, the Teepee Peak gold prospect, located northwest 
of Tagish Lake, and the past producing Skukum gold-silver mine in the southern Yukon.  
(Mineralization at Skukum is also related to deep fault structures). The regional faults 
and Minfile locations are outlined on Figure 10, showing a concentration of Minfile 
occurrences along the Llewellyn Fault Zone. A belt of anomalously high regional gold-
arsenic and antimony geochemistry extends the length of the Tagish Lake area, 
coextensive with the crustal scale Llewellyn Fault (Mihalynuk, 1999).  
 
Potential exists within the Tagish Lake Project for epithermal gold-silver (Engineer Gold 
Camp), polymetallic vein (Ben-My-Chree), gold quartz vein (potential in Graham Creek 
area), copper skarn (Whitehorse Copper) and gold skarn (TP in northern Tagish region) 
deposits. There is also potential for Kuroko-style volcanogenic massive sulphide 
mineralization (such as at Tulsequah Chief) within the Yukon-Tanana Terrane and 
copper-molybdenum-gold porphyry and gold-silver rich Eskay type shallow subaqueous 
hot spring mineralization within the Whitehorse Trough sections of the Tagish Lake 
Project.

7.2      Detailed Geology   
 
7.2.1      Wann River  (Figure 13)  
 
Only a small portion of the Tagish Lake Project has been mapped in detail, covering 28 
hectares of the 2,271.45 hectare Wann River area within the Tagish Lake Project. The 
following description of the geology is summarized from Aspinall (2010). The mapping 
covers an 800m long by 180m wide corridor striking at an azimuth of 160° from the 
Lum#1 trenches (trenches 1 and 2) on the southeast side of Tagish Lake to a showing 
on the southwest banks of the Wann River (River showing).  
 
The corridor is 99% covered by glacial-fluvial tills in the low lands adjacent to the Wann 
River channel, with colluvial gravels observed along the eastern slopes of the channel. 
Low lying glacial fluvial morainal banks are present on the west side of the river in its 
lower sections. Thickness of overburden is estimated to be up to 5m. (Aspinall, 2010). 
 
Outcrop and subcrop of Devonian to Triassic Boundary Range biotite-feldspar-quartz 
schist (DTBG) occurs for 300m along the southwest side of the corridor. This unit  hosts 
the quartz vein stockwork exposed in the Lum #1 & 2 trenches. Immediately to the 
northeast, an assumed fault contact (LFZ1) with a northwest trending faulted panel of 
Upper Triassic Stuhini andesite (UTSV) hosts at least two separate, parallel, northwest 
trending mineralized quartz vein systems, the Trail - River Vein, and the Dutch Vein 
systems. Outcrops of  Upper Triassic Stuhini andesite, (UTSV) are barely exposed 
above the vein systems. 
 
A second assumed fault contact, (LFZ2) with a northwest trending panel of altered 
quartz eye porphyry is believed to be part of a Cretaceous diorite protolith (KD) 
(Mihalynuk, 1999) lies immediately to the northeast of this panel. Traces of Upper 
Triassic Stuhini andesite, (UTSV) are present on the southwest side of the shear in 
contact with the above intrusive. Within this KD panel is a shear zone 10m wide with an 
inner multi-quartz veined core zone 2m wide striking 110° having a variable near-
vertical dip as seen at the Brown Showing. The Brown and the Newfie showings, 130m  
apart, appear to occur within the same rock type and shear zone.  
 
All panels and fault contacts discussed above are part of the Llewellyn Fault Zone. The 
Devonian to Triassic Boundary Range biotite-feldspar-quartz schist (DTBG) forms the 
southwest boundary to the main Llewellyn Fault, although additional splay faulting to the 
southwest is expected.   
 
7.2.2      Engineer  (Figure 18)  
 
The geology of the Engineer Gold Camp, which lies approximately 10 km east of the 
Cretaceous to Tertiary Coast Plutonic Complex, is well documented (British Columbia 
Minfile, 2010). The area is underlain by Lower Jurassic Laberge Group greywacke, 
shale, slate and argillite which host the vein systems and are folded into a syncline with 
a northwest trending fold axis. Sedimentary rocks on the west limb trend 120°/30-40°NE 
Small granodiorite plugs outcrop west of Engineer Mountain and south of Bee Peak. 
Cretaceous or later (probaby Sloko Group equivalent) rhyolites, trachytes and volcanic 
breccias form a 4 km subcircular volcanic cap or neck, preserved predominantly as a 
down-dropped block, to the east of the Engineer Mountain plug. Feldspar porphyry, 
trachyte, and andesite dykes occur in the vicinity of, and are reportedly offset by, the 
Engineer veins (Figure 18).

 8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES  
 
The 800 by 180m corridor within the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake Project 
contains precious metal enriched multi-phase quartz veins and stockworks with minor 
associated base metal mineralization that appear to have features of the low 
sulphidation epithermal gold model. Reported vein mineralization on the Engineer 
portion of the Tagish Lake Project (Gleaner prospect and Kirkland showing), described 
as similar to the Engineer Mine, would have potential for the same deposit type as the 
Mine. Gold bearing veins in the Engineer Gold Camp appear to occur adjacent to splays 
of the crustal scale Llewellyn Fault zone. 
 
Two fluid inclusion determinations by Mihalynuk on one sample from the Double-Decker 
vein at the nearby Engineer Mine showed homogenization temperatures between 
171ºC to 195ºC, which would place them in the temperature range of an epithermal 
envelope (Mihalynuk, 1999). Gold/electrum vein emplacement at that mine possibly 
occurred 800m below the base of the Sloko volcanic rocks and the mineralization and 
volcanics are closely related in time (Mihalynuk, 1999).  
 
A polymetallic vein model has been postulated for mineralization at the Brown showing 
within the Wann River area, and at the Kim and Douglas showings in the southwestern 
property area (British Columbia Minfile, 2010). Minor copper and lead-zinc skarn type 
mineralization is also reported from the Kim showing area (Chateris, 1966). 
 
 
8.1 Low Sulphidation Epithermal Vein Model 
 
The following characteristics of the low sulphidation epithermal gold deposit model are 
primarily summarized from Panteleyev (1996). The mineralization and grade and 
tonnage figures discussed below are not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 
the Tagish Lake Project which is the subject of this report. 
 
Examples of this type of deposit include the Midas Mine of Franco Nevada in Nevada, 
the El Penon Mine of Meridian Minerals in Chile, and the former Baker and Cheni Mines 
in the Toodoggone District of British Columbia. Commodities are gold and silver with 
minor copper, lead and zinc.  
 
Mineralization typically occurs as quartz veins, stockworks and breccias carrying gold, 
silver, electrum, argentite and pyrite with lesser and variable amounts of sphalerite, 
chalcopyrite, galena, rare tetrahedrite and sulphosalt minerals in high level (epizonal) to 
near surface environments. The ore commonly exhibits open space filling textures and 
is associated with volcanic-related hydrothermal to geothermal systems in volcanic 
island and continent margin magmatic arcs and continental volcanic fields with 
extensional structures. 
 
Host rocks include most types of volcanic rocks with calc-alkaline andesitic 
compositions predominating. Some deposits occur in areas with bimodal volcanism and 
extensive subaerial ashflow deposits. A less common association is with alkalic 
intrusive rocks and shoshonitic volcanic rocks. Clastic and epiclastic sedimentary rocks 
host deposits in intra-volcanic basins and structural depressions. 



 
 

 

24   

Gangue minerals include quartz, amethyst, chalcedony, quartz pseudomorphs after 
calcite and calcite, with minor adularia, sericite, barite, fluorite and calcium-
mangnesium-manganese-iron carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite, hematite and 
chlorite. 
 
Alteration generally consists of extensive silicification occurring as multiple generations 
of quartz and chalcedony, commonly accompanied by adularia and calcite. Pervasive 
silicification in vein envelopes is flanked by sericite-illite-kaolinite assemblages. 

Intermediate argillic alteration (kaolinite-illite-montmorillonite ±smectite) forms adjacent 
to some veins. Advanced argillic alteration (kaolinite-alunite) may form along the tops of 
mineralized zones. Propylitic alteration dominates at depth and peripherally. Weathered 
outcrops are often characterized by resistant quartz ± alunite 'ledges' and extensive 
bleached, clay-altered zones on the edges with supergene alunite, jarosite and other 
limonite minerals. 
 
The deposits occur in high-level hydrothermal systems from depths of approximately 1 
km to surficial hotspring settings. They are associated with regional-scale fracture 
systems related to grabens, ±resurgent calderas, flow-dome complexes and rarely, 
maar diatremes. Extensional structures in volcanic fields (normal faults, fault splays, 
ladder veins and cymoid loops, etc.) are common; locally graben or caldera-fill clastic 
rocks are present. High-level (subvolcanic) stocks and/or dikes and pebble breccia 
diatremes occur in some areas. Locally resurgent or domal structures are related to 
underlying intrusive bodies.  
 
Ore zones are typically localized in structures, but may occur in permeable lithologies. 
Upward-flaring ore zones centred on structurally controlled hydrothermal conduits are 
typical. Large (greater than 1m wide and hundreds of metres in strike length) to small 
veins and stockworks are common with lesser disseminations and replacements. Vein 
systems can be laterally extensive but ore shoots have relatively restricted vertical 
extent. High-grade ores are commonly found in dilational zones in faults at flexures, 
splays and in cymoid loops. 
 
Deposits are commonly zoned vertically over 250 to 350m from a base metal poor, 
gold-silver rich top to a relatively silver rich base metal zone and an underlying base 
metal rich zone grading at depth into a sparse base metal, pyritic zone. From surface to 
depth, metal zones contain gold-silver-arsenic-antimony-mercury, gold-silver-lead-zinc-
copper, silver-lead-zinc. In alkalic hostrocks tellurides, roscoelite (vanadium mica) and 
fluorite may be abundant, with lesser molybdenite. 
 
Ages of mineralization are variable although Tertiary deposits are most abundant. The 
age is closely related to the associated volcanic rocks but invariably slightly younger in 
(0.5 to 1 Ma, more or less). 
 
Typical grade and tonnage figures for the median low sulphidation epithermal gold 
deposits, based on worldwide mines and U.S.A. models, include 0.77 million tonnes of 
7.5 g/t Au, 110 g/t Ag and minor copper, zinc and lead for 41 Comstock-type 'bonanza' 
deposits and 0.3 million tonnes of 1.3 g/t Au, 38 g/t Ag and >0.3% Cu from 20 Sado-
type gold-copper deposits. Associated deposit types include high sulphidation 
epithermal gold-silver, hotspring gold-silver, porphyry copper±molybdenum±gold and 
related polymetallic veins and placer gold. 



 
 

 

25   

Economic low sulphidation epithermal deposits are usually mined by a combination of 
open pit mining and underground operations with conventional cyanide milling 
processing, with moderate daily tonnage production. They typically contain high-grade 
sections, often with significant silver content, high silver to gold ratios, "clean" 
metallurgy, and good recoveries. 
 
 
8.2 Polymetallic Vein Model 
 
Intrusion hosted polymetallic veins occur within the Wann River and Mt. Switzer - Ben 
My Chree portions of the Tagish Lake Project. Examples of polymetallic deposits 
include the Beaverdell camp in British Columbia and Creede, Colorado, USA. 
Commodities include Ag, Pb, Zn (Cu, Au, Mn). Similarities exist to the orogenic type 
(Pogo Deposit in Alaska) and the intrusion-related gold pyrrhotite vein model such as at 
the past producing Snip Mine in northern British Columbia.  
 
The following characteristics of the intrusion hosted polymetallic vein deposit model are 
primarily summarized from Lefebure and Hõy, editors, (1996). 
 
Mineralization typically occurs as sulphide-rich veins containing sphalerite, galena, 
pyrite, silver and sulphosalt (tetrahedrite-tennantite) minerals, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite 
and stibnite, in a carbonate and quartz gangue ± specular hematite, hematite, barite 
and fluorite. Silver minerals often occur as inclusions in galena and native gold and 
electrum occurs in some deposits. Gold grades are generally low given the amount of 
sulphides present. Some veins contain more chalcopyrite and gold at depth.  
 
Wall rock alteration in volcanic and intrusive host rocks is argillic, sericitic or chloritic 
and may be quite extensive. 
 
Regional faults (Llewellyn Fault Zone), fault sets and fractures are an important ore 
control, although veins are typically associated with second order structures. In igneous 
rocks the faults may relate to volcanic centers (Sloko Group). Significant deposits are 
restricted to competent lithologies. Dykes are often emplaced along the same faults and 
in some camps are believed to be roughly contemporaneous with mineralization. Some 
polymetallic veins are found surrounding intrusions with porphyry deposits or prospects. 
 
Individual vein systems range from several hundred to several million tonnes grading 
from 5 to 1500 g/t Ag, 0.5 to 20% Pb and 0.5 to 8% Zn. Copper and gold are reported in 
less than half the British Columbia occurrences, with average grades of 0.09% Cu and 4 
g/t Au. The veins usually support small to medium-size underground mines. Larger 
polymetallic vein deposits are attractive because of their high grades and relatively easy 
benefication. They are potential sources of cadmium and germanium. 
 
 
 
9.0 MINERALIZATION  (Figures 3 and 10) 
 
Seven Minfile occurrences are documented on the Tagish Lake Project, which include 
the Kim showing (Minfile Number 104M 063), and the Douglas showing (Minfile Number 
104M 092), discovered by Blind Creek Resources Limited in 2006, in the southwestern 



 
 

 

26   

property area, the Kirkland showing (Minfile Number 104M 015) and part of the Gleaner 
prospect (Minfile Number 104M 016), both proximal to the Engineer Mine, the Graham 
Creek placer (Minfile Number 104M 023), and upstream extent, in the northern property 
area (Figure 10) and the Brown polymetallic vein showing (Minfile Number 104M 026) 
and the copper-nickel-platinum-palladium Anyox-Rodeo prospect (Minfile Number 104M 
017) within the Wann River area. 
 
At the Kim showing mineralization grading 109.7 g/t Ag, 0.7 g/t Au and 4.0% Cu occurs 
in one of several poorly exposed shear zones in a granodiorite host (Mihalynuk and 
Mountjoy, 1990). Copper and lead-zinc skarn occurrences are also reported in the area 
(Chateris, 1966).  
 
The Douglas showing (Figure 10), discovered by Blind Creek Resources Limited in 
2006 south of Mt Switzer, returned a maximum value of 0.6 g/t Au, 11 Ag, 0.19% Cu, 
0.69% Pb and 0.41% Zn from one of five parallel 330° trending quartz-sulphide veins 
(Justason and Davies, 2007). Sulphide minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena and 
sphalerite. Vein widths range from 5 to 12 cm wide, and one vein was traced for 330m 
(British Columbia Minfile, 2010). 
 
The north trending, west dipping, up to 1.2m wide Gleaner veins are situated on the 
northeast side of a major northwest trending shear zone, approximately 500m northeast 
of the main Engineer workings. Mineralization consists of pyrite and native gold hosted 
by sets of quartz stringers cutting sedimentary rocks, brecciated wallrock fragments 
cemented by quartz, and massive quartz veins. Grab samples assayed up to 1.275 
grams per tonne gold (McLeod, 1991). Only a small amount of gold has been reported 
from the Kirkland veins, which represent the southerly extension of the Engineer vein 
system. The main 60 cm wide and 425m long Jersey Lily vein on the Kirkland reportedly 
consists of vuggy comb-structured quartz (British Columbia Minfile, 2010).  
 
A 10m adit was driven at the Brown showing along a 070°/85°SE and 101°/74°S 
trending quartz vein and stringer zone with mineralized veins, up to 60 cm wide 
occurring over a distance of 70m. Mineralization consists of tetrahedrite-freibergite, 
chalcopyrite, malachite, azurite, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite and galena. The highest 
grades come from material along the northern hangingwall of the 2.5m vein/shear 
system exposed by the adit. A chip sample, also from vein material, assayed 8.6 g/t Au 
and 315.38 g/t Ag (BC Minfile, 2010). Grab sample MMI89-59-2A assayed 347 g/t Ag, 
17.9 g/t Au, 2.62% Pb, 0.56% Cu, and 1.0% Zn (BC Minfile, 2010). 
 
The Anyox-Rodeo showing consists of massive sulphide lens hosted by chlorite-
actinolite schist of the Boundary ranges near its contact with Upper Triassic Stuhini 
volcanic rocks. Pentlandite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pyrite occur as fracture fillings 
and interstially. The showing may be an example of basaltic copper or marine volcanic 
association (BC Minfile, 2010). A sample taken by the British Columbia Geological 
Survey assayed 0.15% Cu, 0.60% Ni and 0.12% Co (BC Minfile, 2010). 
 
The Tagish Lake Project has been subdivided into five prospective gold-silver zones: 
Wann River, Edgar-Nelson Lakes - Llewellyn Fault Zone Extension, Engineer, Mt 
Switzer - Ben My Chree Zone and the Torres-Graham-Golden Gate Zone (Figures 2 to 
7). Work on the Project has concentrated on the Wann River area, which occurs along 
the Llewellyn Fault Zone (Figure 3).  



 
 

 

27   

The following detailed discussion of mineralization in the Wann River area is 
summarized from Aspinall (2010). 
 
Although the Engineer Gold Mine system is recognized as being distally associated with 
the Llewellyn Fault Zone, mineralized zones in the Wann River area, 4 kilometres south 
of the historic Engineer gold mine, are directly related to the Llewellyn Fault Zone.  
 
The 800 by 180m corridor within the Wann River area consists of a multi-pulse, and 
polymetallic mineralized quartz veined system with tetrahedite, chalcopyrite, galena, 
sphalerite, malachite, azurite, trace molybdenite, variable pyrite and associated trace 
arsenic, with associated gold and silver.  Three  types of mineralization are recognized: 
 

1. Uncrowded quartz vein stockworks in biotite-feldspar-quartz schist (DTBG), open 
to the southeast. To the northwest the system trends under Tagish Lake. 

2. Quartz vein systems up to 80 cm thick traced for 90m and open along strike, 
hosted by Upper Triassic Stuhini andesite (UTSV). 

3. Shear zone hosted, crowded quartz vein stockworks with a 2m wide core, now 
projected for 130m and still open to the northwest. To the southeast the shear is 
cut off by an assumed displacement. Host rock is a quartz-eye porphyry believed 
to be part of the Cretaceous diorite unit (KD). 

 
Outcrops within the 800 by 180m corridor within the Wann River Project are currently 
limited to seven, all of which host anomalous amounts of gold and silver and variable 
copper, lead and zinc (Figure 13). The seven outcrops include: 
 

1. Lum #1 (trenches 1 and 2): A 1600 square metre mineralized outcrop of biotite-
plagioclase-quartz-schist, with cleavage striking 160°/40°SW, along the 
southeast shore of Tagish Lake is cut by a weak quartz stockwork. Mineralization 
includes chalcopyrite-galena-sphalerite-malachite-pyrite. Best returns from quartz 
dump tailings returned 263 g/t Au, 1350 g/t Ag, 2.75% Cu, 4.45% Pb and 1.36% 
Zn. Extensions of this outcrop area extend 300m to the southeast and are not 
mineralized.  

 
2. Trail Showing: Two sections of a composite quartz vein up to 80 cm wide occur 

near an old trail on the southwest bank of the Wann River, 720m southeast from 
the Lum #1 & Lum #2 trenches within the corridor.  The vein trends 140°/48°SW, 
within Upper Triassic Stuhini Group andesites (UTSV) with pyrite along contact 
selvages with the quartz veins. Mineralization includes tetrahedrite, galena, 
malachite, and trace arsenopyrite and molybdenite.  Best assays to date returned 
52.1 g/t Au, 746 g/t Ag, 1.79 % Cu, 5.76% Pb, and 1.04% Zn.  

 
3. River Showing: An 80 cm wide composite quartz vein outcrop, hosted by Upper 

Triassic Stuhini andesite, (UTSV) occurs on the Wann River bank, 800m 
southeast of the Lum trenches and 60m southeast of the Trail showing. 
Mineralization includes tetrahedrite on hanging and footwall of the quartz vein 
with pyritized wallrock along the vein contact. Best grab sample from the footwall 
of the vein returned 126 g/t Ag. 

 
4. Brown (Adit) Showing: A quartz vein zone is exposed with a 110° trending, near-

vertical, 2m wide quartz core within a 10m wide shear zone, 710m southeast of 
Lum#1 and #2 showings. Mineralization consists of tetrahedrite-sphalerite-



 
 

 

28   

arsenopyrite-malachite-azurite. Best assays from two Minfile records are 94.27 
g/t Au, 1227.22 g/t  Ag  and 17.9 g/t Au, 347 g/t Ag, 0.56 % Cu, 2.62% Pb, 1% Zn 
from grab samples. The host rock is an altered quartz eye feldspar porphyry, 
within an area mapped as Cretaceous diorite (KD).  

 
5. Dutch showing: A quartz vein 80 cm wide, striking 157°/80°NW, now exposed for 

25m by a recent hand-excavated trench, was discovered after quartz fragments 
were noted on surface by geologist Ian Coster while cutting a walking trail in 
2010. The location is 650m southeast of the Lum trenches. Mineralization 
consists of tetrahedrite-chalcopyrite-galena-malachite. Two chip samples were 
collected with maximum results of 3.40 g/t Au and 320 g/t Ag. 

 
6. Newfie Showing: A quartz veinlet stockwork in quartz eye porphyry, (tentatively a 

unit of Cretaceous diorite, KD) located 650m southeast of the Lum trenches, 50m 
northeast of the Dutch Vein and 130m northwest of the Brown (Adit) showing. 
This showing consists of two adjacent previously hand excavated pits, 
rediscovered by prospector John Dicks and Aspinall. This showing has been 
reclaimed by an estimated 70-80 years of forest vegetation, and old workings are 
not immediately recognizable. Present exposures were hand cleared. Two grab 
samples were collected with maximum values of  15.9 g/t Au and 440 g/t Ag. 

 
7. Spanish Showing: Quartz veins up to 20 cm wide, with traces of chalcopyrite, 

malachite and galena.  
 
 
 
10.0 EXPLORATION (Figures 14-17) 
 
Blind Creek Resources Limited initiated acquisition in the Tagish Lake area in 2004, 
continuing into 2010. Exploration has been conducted on the claims from 2005 to 
present and has included prospecting, mapping, geochemical reconnaissance, a limited 
Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) geochemical survey and a reconnaissance magnetic geophysics 
survey.  
 
 
10.1 Geochemistry 
 
A total of 293 geochemical samples are documented from the Tagish Lake Project by 
Blind Creek Resources Limited between 2005 and 2010 (Aspinall, 2010). The 2009 and 
2010 samples are from the Wann River area.

Limited sampling east of the Engineer Mine in 2005 did not return significant results 
(Aspinall, 2006). 
 
The Douglas showing (Figure 10), discovered by Blind Creek Resources Limited in 
2006 south of Mt Switzer, returned a maximum value of 0.6 g/t Au, 11 Ag, 0.19% Cu, 
0.69% Pb and 0.41% Zn from one of five parallel 330° trending quartz-sulphide veins 
(Justason and Davies, 2007). Vein widths range from 5 to 12 cm wide, and one vein 
was traced for 330m (British Columbia Minfile, 2010).  
 
A 30(?) sample MMI soil survey appears to have been conducted over the Engineer 
portion of the Tagish Lake Project in 2007 (Mark, 2008). It appears that the survey 
indicated elevated gold at approximately 6593841mN, 543425 and 543525mE from the 
Gleaner prospect area. MMI refers to mobile metal ions, which move in the weathering 
zone and are weakly or loosely attached to surface soil particles. MMI can be useful in 
detecting mineralization at depth and is not affected by glacial till. 
 
The following discussion of the geochemistry is primarily summarized from Aspinall 
(2010). 
 
A geochemical reconnaissance sampling program in the regions of Wann River and 
Mount Switzer in 2008 confirmed the anomalous results from the Anyox-Rodeo showing 
(Aspinall, 2008) sampled in 1998 by the British Columbia Geological Survey (Mihalynuk, 
1999). A grab sample from a 10 cm wide massive pyrrhotite vein at the head of the pit 
indicated anomalous values in gold (110 ppb), silver-arsenic-copper (6714 ppm), 
platinum (140 ppb), palladium (200 ppb), cobalt (1093 ppm) and nickel (4118 ppm).  
 
In 2009, twenty soil, silt, outcrop and float rock samples were collected, from the banks 
of the Wann River and adjacent areas by Tagish Lake (Aspinall, 2009a). Significant 
results are tabulated below.

Sample 9BCRWR02RF is a float sample found near an existing log cabin with other 
mineralized quartz material, and could have come from anywhere in the southern 
Tagish Lake area. Sample 9BCRWR05R was collected from old trenches into bedrock 
along the southern shore of Tagish Lake, 180m west of the Wann River delta and 
initiated the present interest in the Wann River area. (Aspinall, 2009a).

10.2 Geophysics   
 
Magnetic geophysical surveys were carried out along Tagish Lake in the winters of 
2009 (off-shore of the Engineer Mine) and 2010 (in the Wann River area), delineating a 
geologically complex environment (Aspinall, 2009b and 2010). (Refer to Figure 17).

11.0 DRILLING 
 
No drilling has been conducted on the Tagish Lake Project by Blind Creek Resources 
Limited. However, three drillholes are documented on the Gleaner prospect area of the 
Engineer Project and there is evidence of previous drilling within the 800m by 180m 
corridor on the Wann River Project.  
 
A total of 306m in 3 holes of BQ diamond drilling was undertaken on the Gleaner 
showing by Windarra Minerals Limited under option from Mr. K. Lumsden (Figure 18). 
Maximum results of 1.0 g/t Au, 8.7 g/t Ag over 11.7m, including 2.1 g/t Au, 44.6 g/t Ag 
over 1.7m were obtained from quartz vein and argillite breccia in DDH 80-1 testing the 
extension of the B2 vein (Morgan, 1981).  
 
Three Winkie drill set ups, estimated to be at least 25-30 years old, were discovered in 
the Wann River area by Blind Creek Resources Limited. No core, results or record of 
the drill program could be located. Drill hole locations are tabulated below.

12.0    SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH  
 
The 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010 programs were carried out by or under the direction of 
Clive Aspinall, P.Eng., a qualified professional in the industry (Aspinall, 2006, 2008-
2010). The 2006 program was completed by competent personnel with whom the author 
has previous experience (Justason and Davies, 2007). Two samples were collected from 
the Brown adit by the author in 2010. 
 
Rock samples generally consisted of grab samples of mineralized and altered zones, 
exposed as subcrop, outcrop and float. It should be noted that there is extremely poor 
exposure on the property. Samples were located and recorded by GPS in the field using 
UTM coordinates, Nad 83 datum, Zone 8 projection, placed in clear plastic sample 
bags, numbered and secured in the field. Sample locations and select results are 
plotted on Figures 14 to 16  and Plates 1-3. Complete results are contained in the 
respective yearly reports listed in section 21.0, "References" (Aspinall, 2006, 2008 to 
2010 and Justason and Davies, 2007).  
 
All samples were analyzed by Eco Tech Laboratory Ltd. (Alex Stewart Geochemical), 
Kamloops, British Columbia for Al, Sb, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Ca, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, La, Pb, Mg, 
Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Ag, Sr, Ti, Sn, W, U, V, Y and Zn using a 28 element inductively 
coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) package which involves a nitric-aqua regia 
digestion. Gold was analyzed by fire assay with an atomic absorption finish. Overlimit 
results were completed for gold by fire assay. Four rock samples were re-analysed for 
gold, platinum and palladium. Sample procedures are outlined in Appendix II. Eco Tech 
is an ISO 9001 accredited facility, registration number CDN 52172-07.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND SECURITY 
 
All 2008 to 2010 samples were kept in the custody of Clive Aspinall until delivered to the 
sample preparation laboratory of Eco Tech Laboratory in Whitehorse for preparation 
(Aspinall, 2010) and then internally sent directly to Kamloops, British Columbia for 
analysis. The two samples collected by the author in 2010 were personally delivered to 
the Whitehorse sample preparation laboratory. The 2005 to 2006 samples were directly 
sent to the Kamloops location. Laboratory sample preparation and analysis procedures 
are outlined in Appendix III. Quality control procedures were implemented at the 
laboratory, involving the regular insertion of blanks and standards and repeat analyses 
of at least 25% of the samples, with re-analyses being performed for one sample in 
each batch on the original sample prior to splitting (resplit). Sample procedures are 
outlined in Appendix II. 
 
The following discussion of sample preparation is summarized from Aspinall (2010). 
 
Rock samples were placed in heavy, double-plastic bags, closed with a tie wire and 
ribbon. Sample numbers were written in waterproof marker on the outside of each sample 
bag and numbered sample tags were placed inside the bags. Rock and field descriptions, 
including NAD 83 UTM coordinates were recorded on site in a field note book. A GPS 
model 76Cx instrument determined locations and sample numbers were also stored in the 
GPS for later retrieval. 
 
Soil and silt samples were collected in water resistant, kraft paper sample bags. Numbers 
were written on the outside of each bag, and locations were recorded as outlined above. 
 
A sampling protocol is recommended, involving the routine and regular insertion of blanks, 
standards and duplicates sent to the primary laboratory, and re-assaying of selected 
mineralized pulps at a second independent laboratory in the proposed drill program on the 
project. 
 
 
 
14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Two samples collected from the Brown adit (6590036mN, 542629mE, Nad 83, Zone 8 
projection) by the author in 2010 confirmed previous results and verified the presence of 
significant gold-silver values at the Brown adit in the Wann River portion of the Tagish 
Lake Project (Table 5). A previous chip sample from vein material in the adit assayed 
8.6 g/t Au and 315.38 g/t Ag (BC Minfile, 2010). Grab sample MMI89-59-2A assayed 
347 g/t Ag, 17.9 g/t Au, 2.62% Pb, 0.56% Cu, and 1.0% Zn (BC Minfile, 2010). The 
association of high silver values with significant arsenic, antimony and copper 
geochemistry suggests the presence of freibergite.

The current geochemical data was verified by sourcing original analytical certificates 
and digital data. Analytical data quality assurance and quality control was indicated by 
the favourable reproducibility obtained in laboratory standards, blanks and duplicates. 
Quality control procedures are discussed under Section 13.0, "Sample Preparation And 
Security". The geochemical programs between 2005 and 2010 were carried out by 
qualified personnel. The 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010 programs were carried out by or 
under the direction of Clive Aspinall, P.Eng., a qualified professional in the industry. 
 
 
 
15.0     ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The Engineer Mine property of BCGold Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia is 
surrounded by the Engineer portion of the Tagish Lake Project of Blind Creek 
Resources Limited and lies 4 kilometres north of the Wann River area (Figure 7). "The 
Engineer deposit was found in 1899 and produced 597,176 grams of gold between 
1913 and 1932. Native gold, tellurides (probably calaverite), pyrite, and trace allemontite 
(SbS), arsenopyrite, and needles of berthierite (FeS-Sb2S3), which were identified by X-
ray analysis, occur in a gangue of quartz, calcite, and mariposite. Good comb-
structures. as well as banding and vugs, characterize quartz veins. Host rocks include 
shales and greywackes of the Laberge Group" (Schroeter, 1986). 
 
Mineralized quartz veins up to 0.9m wide are hosted by a 24m by 3 km long shear zone 
in Lower Jurassic Laberge greywacke and argillite at the Happy Sullivan (Au, Ag) 
prospect north of the Engineer area (Figure 2). "The Happy Sullivan prospect has a 
similar mineralogical and geologic setting to that of the Engineer Mine, however, 
arsenopyrite is locally up to 20 per cent and dendritic crystals of native gold have been 
found" (Mihalynuk and Mountjoy, 1990). Grab sample results include 323.6 g/t Au 226.2 
g/t Ag (Mihalynuk and Mountjoy, 1990).  
 
The Ben-My-Chree (Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn) past producer is surrounded by the northern 
portion of the Mt. Switzer-Ben My Chree Zone of Blind Creek Resources Limited (Figure 
5). Approximately 7 tonnes of ore were produced in 1911 at Ben-My-Chree (Steep), 
from which 93 grams of gold and 31,103 grams of silver were recovered from quartz 
and quartz-calcite veins hosted by Cretaceous foliated diorites, which contain up to 4% 
chalcopyrite, galena and pyrite. A grab sample in 1985 returned 11 g/t Au, 450 Ag, 
0.14% Cu, 4.25% Pb and 0.037% Zn (Schroeter, 1986).  
 
The mineralization, production and resource information discussed in this section has 
not been verified by the author and is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 
the Tagish Lake Project which is the subject of this report. 
 
 
 
16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

The Tagish Lake Project is at an early exploration stage and no metallurgical testing has 
been carried out.

17.0    RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
There has not been sufficient drilling on the Tagish Lake Project to undertake a resource 
calculation or to delineate the limits of mineralization in any direction.  
 
 
 
18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
To the author's knowledge, there is no additional information or explanation necessary 
to make this technical report understandable and not misleading. 
 
 
 
19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Seven Minfile occurrences are documented on the Tagish Lake Project, the Kim (109.7 
g/t Ag, 0.7 g/t Au and 4.0% Cu) and Douglas polymetallic vein showings in the 
southwestern property area, the epithermal style Kirkland showing and Gleaner 
prospect near the Engineer Mine, the Graham Creek placer, and upstream extent, in the 
northern property area, and the Brown polymetallic vein showing and the copper-nickel-
platinum-palladium Anyox-Rodeo prospect within the Wann River area. 
 
Mineralization at the Brown showing consists of tetrahedrite-freibergite, chalcopyrite, 
malachite, azurite, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite and galena. A sample collected from 
the Brown adit by the author in 2010, returning 8.6 g/t Au and 420 g/t Ag over 0.3m, 
confirmed previous results by the British Columbia Geological Survey from a chip 
sample (assaying 8.6 g/t Au and 315.38 g/t Ag) and verified the presence of significant 
gold-silver values on the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake Project. 

 
Results from grab samples from the Wann River area include 263 g/t Au, 1350 g/t Ag, 
2.75% Cu, 4.45% Pb and 1.36% Zn in quartz from tailings in the Lum trenches, and 
15.9 g/t Au, 440 g/t Ag, and 1.04% Pb from the Newfie, 17.2 g/t Au from the Trail, 
including 32.9 g/t Au, 1180 g/t Ag and 3.35% Cu and 3.79% Pb from float, and 126 g/t 
Ag from the River quartz vein showings. 
 
The Wann River area covers a mineralized vein and shear zone prospect related to the 
Llewellyn Fault Zone, which has acted as a channelway for passage of mineralized 
solutions and their deposition. Mineralization is confined to narrow structures ranging 
from less than 80cm to 2m wide, but locally, the structures may widen into quartz 
stockworks, with widths up to 40m wide. 
 
Recent work on the Tagish Lake Project has focused on the Wann River area based on 
the widespread indications of precious and variable base metal mineralization within a 
prospective 800m by 180m wide corridor, association with the productive Llewellyn Fault 
Zone, and proximity and similarities to the past producing Engineer Mine. There is 
excellent exploration potential on the Wann River Project to host precious metal 
mineralization similar to that of the nearby past producing Engineer Mine. "Sheared and 
altered (broadly silicified) or quartz veined rocks within and adjacent to the Llewellyn 
fault zone are known to be anomalous in gold" (Mihalynuk, 1990).

There is also excellent exploration potential in the Engineer Project area of the Tagish Lake 
Project to locate additional epithermal style precious metal mineralization similar to that of the 
nearby past producing Engineer Mine. More than six epithermal veins are reported from the 
Kirkland showing and Gleaner prospects Exploration has been hindered due to separate 
ownership from the Engineer Mine, with the ground previously held by one individual, Mr. Keith 
Lumsden, since 1971.  

Exploration on the Tagish Lake Project has been hampered by lack of exposure, thick 
overburden cover, variable but generally poor soil profiles, and lack of recent exploration.  

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET  

Based on the widespread indications of precious and variable base metal mineralization within 
a prospective 800m by 180m wide corridor, association with the Llewellyn Fault Zone, lack of 
overall exposure, and proximity and similarities to the past producing Engineer Mine, a 
significant exploration program is recommended on the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake 
Project.  

An initial 2,000m diamond drill program is recommended in the Wann River area, utilizing a 
light weight helicopter transported drill capable of drilling NTW size core to a 250m depth, to 
evaluate the southeastern sector of the corridor. Drill permits are currently in place for this type 
of program. A ground magnetic geophysical survey is also recommended over the Wann River 
area to aid in geological mapping due to the paucity of exposure. Most of the core should be 
split and systematically sampled for gold and ICP. Additional prospecting and sampling can be 
undertaken at this time on the Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake Project. Approximately 
$50,000 of the following budget (5%) is recommended to evaluate the Engineer portion of the 
project by mapping, prospecting and sampling.  

Based on the above recommendations, the following exploration program primarily on the 
Wann River portion of the Tagish Lake Project with corresponding budget is proposed:

APPENDIX II: Geochemical Procedure 

 
 

ECO TECH LABORATORY (STEWART GROUP) 
 

Analytical Method for 
 

GEOCHEMICAL GOLD ANALYSIS 
 
 

Samples are catalogued and dried. Soils are prepared by sieving through an 80 mesh 
screen to obtain a minus 80 mesh fraction.  Samples unable to produce adequate minus 
80 mesh material are screened at a coarser fraction. These samples are flagged with 
the relevant mesh.  Rock samples are 2 stage crushed to minus 10 mesh and a 250 
gram subsample is pulverized on a ring mill pulverizer to -140 mesh. The subsample is 
rolled, homogenized and bagged in a pre-numbered bag. 
 
The sample is weighed to 10/15/30 grams and fused along with proper fluxing materials.  
The bead is digested in aqua regia and analyzed on an atomic absorption instrument.  
Over-range values for rocks are re-analyzed using gold assay methods. 
 
Appropriate reference materials accompany the samples through the process allowing 
for quality control assessment. Results are entered and printed along with quality 
control data (repeats and standards). The data is faxed and/or mailed to the client. 
 

 
GOLD and PGE ASSAYS 

 
Samples are sorted and dried (if necessary). The samples are crushed through a jaw 
crusher and cone or rolls crusher to -10 mesh. The sample is split through a Jones riffle 
until a -250 gram subsample is achieved.  The subsample is pulverized in a ring & puck 
pulverizer to 95% - 140 mesh. The sample is rolled to homogenize. 
 
For gold, a 1/2 or 1.0 assay ton sample size is fire assayed using appropriate fluxes. 
The resultant dore bead is parted and then digested with aqua regia and then analyzed 
on a Perkin Elmer AA instrument.  
 
Determinations for Au, Pt and Pd are completed by classical lead-collection fire assay 
on a 1 assay ton sample (30g). Analysis is by ICP after digestion of the dore bead.  
 
Appropriate standards and repeat sample (Quality Control components) accompany the 
samples on the data sheet. 



 
 

 

  

Analytical Procedure Assessment Report 
 
 
 MULTI ELEMENT ICP ANALYSIS 
 
 
Samples are catalogued and dried.  Soil samples are screened to obtain a -80 mesh 
sample.  Samples unable to produce adequate -80 mesh material are screened at a 
coarser fraction.  These samples are flagged with the relevant mesh.  Rock samples are 
2 stage crushed to minus 10 mesh and pulverized on a ring mill pulverizer to minus 140 
mesh, rolled and homogenized. 
 
 
A 0.5 gram sample is digested with aqua regia which contains beryllium which acts as 
an internal standard.  The sample is analyzed on a Jarrell Ash ICP unit. 
 
Results are collated by computer and are printed along with accompanying quality 
control data (repeats and standards).  Results are printed on a laser printer and are 
faxed and/or mailed to the client. 
 
 
 

 
 BASE METAL ASSAYS (Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn) 
 
 
Samples are catalogued and dried. Rock samples are 2 stage crushed followed by 
pulverizing a 250 gram subsample. The subsample is rolled and homogenized and 
bagged in a pre-numbered bag. 
 
A suitable sample weight is digested with aqua regia. The sample is allowed to cool, 
bulked up to a suitable volume and analyzed by an atomic absorption instrument, to .01 % 
detection limit. 
 
Appropriate certified reference materials accompany the samples through the process 
providing accurate quality control. 
 
Result data is entered along with standards and repeat values and are faxed and/or 
mailed to the client.
