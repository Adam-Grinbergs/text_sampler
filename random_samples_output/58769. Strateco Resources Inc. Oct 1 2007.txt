1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

INTRODUCTION 
Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by 

Jean-Pierre Lachance, Executive Vice President of Strateco Resources Inc. (Strateco), to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Matoush Project, in north central 

Quebec.  The purpose of this report is to support a mineral resource estimation made for 

the AM-15 Zone by Scott Wilson RPA and to evaluate and discuss the exploration 

potential elsewhere on the property.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 

Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on 

June 15-16, 2007. 

 

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The AM-15 Zone of uranium mineralization is localized at the intersection of the 

gabbro dike-hosting Matoush Fault Zone (MFZ) with the ACF 3 unit.  An inference to be 

drawn is that the conjunction of the dike-hosting structure and a probable paleoaquifer 

provided a location for the mixing of two different fluids (one presumably reducing and 

basement derived, the other presumably oxidizing and basin derived) resulting in the 

distinctive alteration of the host rocks and the deposition, over time, of uranium 

mineralization.  If Rhys (2007) is correct, the AM-15 Zone occurs on a dilational bend of 

the MFZ which probably implies a localized opportunity for enhanced fluid flow.  The 

MFZ shows AM-15-type wall rock alteration at other locations along its length but 

without uranium mineralization, indicating fluid flow at least.  Special circumstances are 

required for uranium mineralization to be deposited. 

 

As currently defined, the AM-15 Zone is dominantly a stratabound, north trending 

body of uranium mineralization hosted mainly within the ACF 3 unit.  The mineralization 

has a shallow overall plunge of 15º to the south such that there is some mineralization in 

the underlying CBF 4 sandstones and in the overlying CBF 3 sandstones, at the south and 

north ends respectively.  The indicated and inferred mineral resources as estimated by 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 1-2

Scott Wilson RPA for the AM-15 Zone occur within four roughly vertically oriented 

lenses that form an overall strike length of 300 m, and through a vertical distance of 50 m 

to 100 m, at a depth ranging from 175 m to 275 m below surface.  These lenses have been 

assigned the names: Main Lens, South Lens, Upper Lens and North Lens.  The Main 

Lens is the largest of the four identified at the AM-15 Zone with dimensions of 

approximately 235 m along strike, 50 m down-dip and thicknesses ranging between 2 m 

and 15 m and averaging about 7.5 m.  In cross section, the Main Lens varies from 

roughly ovoid to tabular.  

 

Indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79% U3O8 
containing 3.48 million pounds U3O8 at a cut off grade of 0.05% U3O8.  Inferred mineral 

resources are estimated to total 65,000 tonnes grading 0.43% U3O8 containing 0.62 

million pounds U3O8.  There are no mineral reserves estimated at Matoush. 

 

In the Otish Basin, the association of significant uranium mineralization with fault-

hosted mafic dikes is empiric (AM-15 Zone, L Zone).  The AM-15 Zone occurs in an 

overall Athabasca-type structural, stratigraphic and geotectonic setting but is in itself, not 

an unconformity-type deposit. Nor is it apparently a perched zone.  It might simply be 

described as an Otish-type uranium deposit. 

 

The Aeroquest airborne survey, although requiring more detailed interpretation, has 

given good magnetic, EM and radiometric responses which have outlined a host of fault 

structures and at least six areas with anomalous radioactive boulders which are being 

followed-up.  Target areas are being prioritized for future work which ultimately means 

drill testing.  With respect to the MFZ, the brittle fault strands coincide with the location 

of alteration along the fault, and even in areas distal to known mineralized zones, chlorite 

and roscoelite-fuchsite alteration is sporadically developed in the surrounding sandstone 

to the fault, suggesting that following the fault is a valid exploration method (Rhys, 

2007).

There is excellent potential for other uranium deposits on the Matoush properties.  

There are at least two interpreted fault structures parallel to the MFZ, one on either side, 

and any number of interpreted fault features in the aeromagnetic and EM data derived 

from the Aeroquest survey.  Targets to follow-up with drilling should be any basement-

rooted fault (however determined).  Flexures in such features would be targets as would 

the intersection with other faults.  Any direction of faulting should be considered a 

potential target until the target model can be refined more.  The working premise should 

initially be that a target mineralized zone would be at the intersection of a reactivated, 

basement-rooted fault with a paleoaquifer in the Indicator Formation which would 

include ACF 1, ACF 2, ACF 3, ACF 4 and also the basement unconformity. 

 

Future drilling on the Matoush Project should concentrate on stepping out, away from 

the AM-15 Zone, concentrating along the extent of the MFZ as well as investigating any 

other interpreted basement rooted fault zones.  The objective should be the location of 

other mineralized centres with potential to host substantial tonnages of uranium 

mineralization. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Strateco's AM-15 Zone is a very significant 

uranium deposit which indicates considerable exploration potential for the Matoush 

Project area.  The work program recommended is amply warranted. 

 

At the beginning of the Strateco exploration program at Matoush, the objective was to 

define and expand the AM-15 Zone.  That objective has been more than accomplished.  

In the process, the nature and controls on the mineralization has been demonstrated which 

in turn implies significant exploration potential for the balance of the Matoush properties. 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
The qualified persons responsible for this report are of the opinion that Strateco's 

Matoush properties in the Otish Basin already have a demonstrably important uranium 

resource in the AM-15 Zone, and that there is excellent potential to find other zones.  

Considerably more uranium exploration work is warranted and a substantial work 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com

program is recommended.  It must be noted that a large part of any exploration program 

on these properties will involve diamond drilling.  A recommended Phase 1 program to 

run from Jan. 1, 2008 through Dec. 31, 2008 includes extensive diamond drilling of 

targets already defined, review of current airborne and ground geophysical data and 

ground follow-up of anomalously radioactive boulder trains.  Compilation of geological 

and geophysical data plus geochemical data collected during the current drilling will 

doubtlessly lead to the definition of more drill targets associated with the fault structures 

as defined.   

 

Strateco have initiated a QA/QC program supervised by dedicated, on site personnel. 

When fully implemented, in addition to quarter split duplicates, Scott Wilson RPA 

recommends that sample batches include some combination of blanks, Certified 

Reference Materials, reject duplicates and pulp duplicates. The intent is to identify any 

Quality Control failures which would in turn trigger re-analysis of sample batches. 

 

The mineral resource estimate at AM-15 Zone could by refined by adjusting the 

tonnage factor by mineralization type and/or lens.  Strateco should continue to collect 

bulk density measurements until a sufficient amount of data with an appropriate spatial 

distribution permits a refinement to the mineral resource estimate at AM-15 Zone.   

 

Given the size of the Matoush properties, a Phase 2 program can be foreseen to also 

include significant diamond drilling of untested existing targets plus targets developed 

over time as a synthesis of existing and newly acquired data pin points new areas with 

potential for uranium mineralization.  Advancing to Phase 2 work will in part be 

contingent on positive results from Phase 1 work.  Nonetheless it is felt that at the end of 

Phase 1 there will still be a number of untested top priority drill targets, plus those that 

may be developed through detailed interpretation of the collective geophysical data.  

Details of the recommended programs are shown in Table 1-1.  Scott Wilson RPA has 

reviewed and concurs with the recommended program and budget.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Matoush project is centrally located within the Province of Quebec, situated 260 

km northeast of Chibougamau, in the Chibougamau Mining District, on NTS sheet 

32P/16, "Lac Hippocampe".  The property extends 31 km in a north-south direction and 

ranges from about one kilometre to 8 kilometres in width (from east to west).  The centre 

of the currently defined AM-15 uranium-mineralized zone is located at 699250E, 

5760600N (NAD 27, Zone 18), within the boundaries of claims 1045781 and 1045782.   

 

LAND TENURE 
The Matoush Project encompasses three separate claim groupings (Figure 4-2). The 

three entities are known as Matoush, Eclat and Matoush Extension, which collectively 

include 313 map-designated claims totalling 16,619.4 ha in area.  The Matoush Extension 

property is owned 100% by Strateco through its acquisition by staking. The Matoush 

property is owned 100% by Strateco, subject to a 2% NSR. Eclat is subject to an option 

agreement with a third party. 

 

In Table 25-1, Appendix 1, all of the subject claims are listed, according to their 

property grouping along with information including their designated number, recording 

date, renewal date, expiry date, area, work credits, fees and annual dollar work 

requirements.  As the map-designated claims have pre-established positions, a legal 

survey of the property is not required.  A map-designated claim is valid for two years and 

can be renewed indefinitely subject to the completion of necessary expenditure 

requirements.  The claim also guarantees the holder's right to obtain an extraction right 

upon the discovery of a mineral deposit.  

 

SITE INFRASTRUCTURE 
There is presently no infrastructure on the properties other than Strateco's recently 

constructed 45-person Weatherhaven camp.

HISTORY 
Major uranium exploration programs were carried out in the Otish Basin between 

1965 and 1985.  Exploration occurred in two successive waves, initially (1965-1975), by 

companies like Soquem, Atlantic Ritchfields, Uranerz and Phelps Dodge who targeted 

Elliot Lake-type deposits.  The second phase, from 1980 to 1985, targeted Athabasca 

unconformity-type deposits.  This work was conducted mainly by Séru-Cogéma for the 

eastern half of the Otish Basin, and by various parties for the western half, including 

Uranerz, Soquem, Pan-Continental-Cominco and Esso Minerals.   

 

The Matoush prospect was discovered in 1980 by Uranerz Exploration and Mining 

Ltd. (Uranerz) and work continued until 1984.  Extensive work was done in the general 

area including airborne magnetics, EM and radiometric surveying, ground mapping, 

sampling, ground geophysics and a total of 23 holes of exploration drilling.  The Matoush 

structure was defined geophysically for 3,900 m and tested over 900 m of strike length by 

17 drill holes. One hole, AM-15, intersected significant mineralization, 0.95% U3O8,over 

16 m but the project was abandoned in 1985. 

 

Following the discovery in 2002 of the Renard kimberlites 70 km to the north by the 

Ashton Diamonds/Soquem joint venture, the western portion of the Otish Basin 

experienced a staking rush and what is now the main Matoush property was acquired by 

Ditem Exploration Inc (Ditem).  Ditem flew an aeromagnetic survey over a large area and 

collected till samples for heavy mineral analyses.  Apparently no kimberlite targets were 

defined on the Matoush property and no holes were drilled.  Ditem optioned the property 

to Strateco in May 2005 and Strateco now owns it 100%, subject to a 2% NSR in favour 

of Ditem.. 

 

Strateco began work on the Matoush properties in early 2006 and to the end of 

August 2007 the following work has been completed:

8. Approximately 30 km2 of prospected area. 

 

GEOLOGY 
The Otish Basin is one of a chain of intracratonic Proterozoic basins situated along 

the southern and southeastern margin of the Archean Superior Craton.  As preserved, the 

basin is a north easterly trending trough, at least 160 km long and averaging about 30 km 

in width.  The southern margin is defined mainly by the Grenville Front.  The Otish Basin 

rests unconformably on Archean basement comprised of folded and metamorphosed 

supracrustal rocks, large areas of high grade quartzofeldspathic gneisses, migmatites and 

younger granitoid intrusions.  The generally flat lying, clastic formations were originally 

deposited on a weathered, regolithic Archean surface with high local relief.  The clastic 

material of all formations was derived from the Archean basement complexes north and 

east of the basin.  The Otish sedimentary sequence records a progression from a high 

energy fluvio-terrestrial, syn-rift facies to a lower energy marginal marine depositional 

environment reflecting a change from initially reducing depositional conditions to 

oxidizing conditions.   

 

The preserved Paleoproterozoic stratigraphy, defined as the Otish Group is comprised 

of the lower Indicator Formation and the overlying Peribonca Formation.  The Indicator 

Formation, underlying the whole of the basin is composed of conglomerates and 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 1-9

sandstones and varies from 330 m thick at the type section to 760 m or more in the deeper 

western end of the basin.  The overall colour of the Indicator Formation is buff to white.  

The Peribonca Formation conformably overlies the Indicator Formation and is found only 

in the centre and north eastern parts of the Otish Basin.  The Peribonca Formation is 

composed of red sandstones and minor conglomerates and bedded dolomite.  The 

maximum observed thickness is 380 m but the total thickness is unknown because the top 

of the formation is an erosion surface.  The Otish Group is cut by a series of olivine 

tholeiite (gabbro) dikes and sills.  The dikes trend dominantly northerly, N45°E and 

N70°E.  Strong fault patterns have been developed in the Otish Basin both before and as 

a result of the Grenville Orogeny. 

 

Quaternary glaciation has blanketed the area of the Otish Basin with a variable but 

pervasive layer of glacial till.  Local topography is dominated by glacial features, in 

particular drumlinoid ridges up to 30 m high and several kilometres long.  Outcrop is 

poor.  Most of the hills, streams and lakes are elongated in the 200° glacial direction.  Ice 

advances were from the northeast.  Drumlins, eskers and kames are common in the area 

and range between 15 m and 30 m in height. 

 

Uranerz were the first to describe and subdivide the top 500 m of the Indicator 

Formation on what is now the Matoush property.  By their interpretation, the lithologies 

represent fluvial sediments which were likely deposited in a braided river environment.  

Two lithological facies types which repeat in the stratigraphic column were recognized in 

the drill core and termed: Active Channel Facies (ACF) and Channel-Bar Facies (CBF). 

 

The ACF consists of massive to slightly cross bedded, gritty, coarse grained 

sandstone to conglomerate.  The sediments are poorly sorted with angular to subrounded 

grains and clasts.  The clast component consists of pebble to cobble size fragments of 

quartz, feldspar, granite and mudstone.  The conglomerates are dominantly matrix 

supported and the matrix is composed of clay-silt and medium to coarse sands.  The rocks 

are generally well cemented with silica.  The ACF is also characterized by numerous and 

sharp erosional contacts between individual beds.  A cyclic nature to the sedimentary

  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 1-10

deposition is also recognizable.  If a full cycle is preserved, it ranges from two metres to 

four metres in thickness.  The base of the cycle is a sharp erosional contact with the 

underlying bed, followed by a massive conglomerate which grades up into weakly cross-

bedded (large scale), very coarse grained sandstone.  The remaining section consists of 

well to moderately well cross-bedded medium to coarse-grained sands.  The top of the 

cycle may be a laminated fine sand to silt layer one centimetre to two centimetres in 

thickness.  

 

The CBF consists of medium- to coarse-grained, well cross-bedded, sorted, 

subarkosic sandstone.  The quartz and feldspar grains are subangular to subrounded.  The 

sandstone is well cemented with silica.  The cyclic nature of sedimentation is not as 

clearly defined in the unit due to gradational contacts and numerous mini cycles.  A cycle 

bounded by sharp erosional contacts in this facies may be greater than 15 m thick.  The 

cycle is composed of many mini cycles, 0.2 m to 0.5 m thick which have minor erosional 

or gradational contacts.  The mini cycle consists of a basal coarse- to very coarse-grained 

cross-bedded sand, which grades rapidly into medium-grained well cross-bedded 

sandstone.  Rare thin siltstone layers can be present at the top of some mini cycles.   

 

Recent detailed drilling by Strateco has elaborated considerably on the property 

stratigraphy.  At the Matoush Zone, approximately 800 m of Indicator Formation rests 

unconformably on a relatively unweathered, granitic basement.  Four ACF cycles have 

been recognized so far, separated by three CBF cycles.  From surface downward these are 

identified as ACF 1 (35 m), CBF 1 (75 m), ACF 2 (5 m), CBF 2 (85 m), ACF 3 (60 m), 

CBF 3 (100 m), ACF 4 (400 m), basal conglomerate (28 m) and basement regolith (4 m) 

(Figure 7-2).  Contacts are generally horizontal and transitional between all units though 

there are local erosional surfaces located at the lower boundary of ACF bands.   

 

An important local variation termed saccharoidal texture has been noted at the base of 

CBF 2, immediately overlying the AM-15 Zone.  This texture reflects the local absence 

of strong silicification, giving the appearance of a sugary texture to the rock.  Although 

saccharoidal bands are typically <10 cm in true thickness, the close stacking (<5 cm) of

  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 1-11

many bands over five metres to ten metres has been observed.  The most important zones 

of saccharoidal texture are observed near the base of the CBF2 which stratigraphically 

overlies the mineralized ACF3 rocks.  Porosity in these bands appears many times greater 

than in the remainder of the CBF.  The AM-15 mineralization extends upward into these 

rocks although it narrows considerably.  Saccharoidal bands have clear bedding planes, 

and commonly show tilted bedding.   

 

The main Matoush mineralization, termed the AM-15 Zone, is hosted in ACF 3.  The 

smaller and eroded AM-8 Zone is found at surface in ACF 1, vertically above the AM-15 

Zone.  Uranium mineralization of undefined extent has also been intersected in ACF 2 

(L43 occurrence), ACF 3 (L45 occurrence) 1.3 km south of AM-15 Zone and ACF 4 (22 

Deep occurrence).  

 

Little is known of the structural geology of the Matoush properties except that the 

stratigraphy is essentially flat lying and is cut by a number of northerly and north easterly 

trending faults.  The AM-15 Zone is associated with a north trending fault structure 

occupied by a mafic dike.  The Matoush Fault is best described as a fault zone (MFZ) 

since it locally contains multiple strands of north trending, generally steep east dipping 

clay gouge and cataclastic breccia.  The zone strikes at 007°, dips 85° E and is traceable 

on recent aeromagnetic surveys for at least 20 km.  No folding or re-orientation of the 

bedding is apparent in proximity to the MFZ in the area of detailed drilling.  The lack of 

apparent vertical offset of sedimentary marker units across the Matoush Fault strands 

suggests that either displacement was minimal, or was dominantly strike slip.  Uranium 

mineralization in the MFZ occurs along the trace of the Matoush Fault where the 

structure steps to the east in plan view.  Here, the northeasterly trend of the outline of 

mineralization/alteration differs from the more northerly trend of the fault and mafic 

dyke.  The overall pattern suggests the occurrence of mineralization in a dilational bend 

within the fault system, which would imply a component of dextral (right lateral) 

displacement on the fault during mineralization.

MINERAL RESOURCES  
Scott Wilson RPA has prepared a mineral resource estimate for the AM-15 Zone at 

Matoush using drill hole data available as of September 6, 2007 (Table 1-2).  A set of 

cross sections and plan views were interpreted to construct three dimensional (3D) grade-

shell wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 0.05% U3O8.  The mineralization making up 

the mineral resource is shared among four vertical lenses controlled by the Matoush Fault 

Zone (MFZ): Main Lens, South Lens, North Lens and an Upper Lens.  Variogram 

parameters were interpreted from one metre composited assay values.  Block model U3O8 
grades within the wireframe models were estimated by ordinary kriging.   

 

Indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79% U3O8 
containing 3.48 million pounds U3O8.  Inferred mineral resources are estimated to total 

65,000 tonnes grading 0.43% U3O8 containing 0.62 million pounds U3O8.  There are no 

mineral reserves estimated at Matoush.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
This report has been prepared by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott 

Wilson RPA) for Strateco Resources Inc.  The information, conclusions, opinions and 

estimates contained herein are based on: 

• Information available to Scott Wilson RPA at the time of preparation of this 

report, 

• Assumptions, conditions, and qualifications as set forth in this report, 

• Data, reports and other information supplied by Strateco and other third party 

sources. 

 
Three properties comprise the Matoush Project: Matoush Extension, Matoush and 

Eclat.  Strateco staked and owns 100% of the Matoush Extension.  Matoush is owned 

100% by Strateco, subject to a 2% NSR. Eclat is under option from a third party.  For the 

purpose of this report, Scott Wilson RPA has relied on ownership information provided 

by Strateco and detailed in Item 4 and Item 24, Appendix 1.  Scott Wilson RPA has not 

researched property title or mineral rights for the Matoush project and expresses no 

opinion as to the ownership status of the property.  Scott Wilson RPA did review the 

status of a few claims on the web site of the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles du 

Québec, de la Faune et des Parcs (https://gestim.mines.gouv.qc.ca) and for those claims 

verified the information as noted in Item 24, Appendix 1.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Matoush project is centrally located within the Province of Quebec, 260 km 

northeast of Chibougamau, in the Chibougamau Mining District, on NTS sheet 32P/16 

"Lac Hippocampe" (Figure 4-1).  The property extends 31 km in a north-south direction 

and ranges from about one kilometre to eight kilometres in width (east-west).  The long 

axis (north-south) of the property package is approximately along Longitude 72° 05" W. 

The 52nd Parallel (Latitude 52° 00" N) essentially bisects the property.  The centre of the 

currently defined Matoush uranium-mineralized zone is located at 699250E, 5760600N 

(NAD 27, Zone 18), within the boundaries of claims 1045781 and 1045782. 

 

LAND TENURE 
The Matoush Project encompasses three separate claim groupings (Figure 4-2) 

reflecting the acquisition of the property package over time.  The three entities are known 

as Matoush, Eclat and Matoush Extension, which collectively include 313 map-

designated claims totalling 16,619.4 ha in area.  In Table 25-1, Appendix 1, all of the 

subject claims are listed, according to their property grouping along with information 

including their designated number, recording date, renewal date, expiry date, area, work 

credits, fees and annual dollar work requirements.  As the map-designated claims have 

pre-established positions, a legal survey of the property is not required.  

 

A map-designated claim is valid for two years, and can be renewed indefinitely 

subject to the completion of necessary expenditure requirements.  The claims comprising 

the Matoush properties have an average (cell) size of 53.2 ha which requires expenditures 

of $1,200 every two years.  Each claim gives the holder an exclusive right to search for 

mineral substances, except sand, gravel, clay and other loose deposits, on the land 

subjected to the claim.  The claim also guarantees the holder's right to obtain an 

extraction right upon the discovery of a mineral deposit.  Ownership of the mining rights 

confers the right to acquire the surface rights.

The area lies north of the limit of commercial forest.  Consequently, acquisition of a 

forest management permit is not required, although recommended.  Certain limitations 

are nevertheless stipulated in the "Paix des Braves" in relation to the cutting of trees 

(Girard, 2006). 

 

The Matoush Extension property is owned 100% by Strateco through its acquisition 

by staking. The Matoush property is also owned 100% by Strateco, subject to a 2% NSR. 

The Eclat property is subject to an agreement with a third party.  The Eclat property was 

staked by Vija Ventures Corporation (Vija) in 2004 for its diamond potential.  The 

property covers the southern extension of the structure containing the Matoush prospect.  

On July 6, 2005, Vija granted Strateco Resources an option to acquire an interest in the 

property.  The agreement calls for Strateco to acquire a 100% interest in the Eclat 

property by making payments totalling $150,000 over four years, including $7,000 on 

signature of the agreement and $7,000 on the first anniversary, and by funding a total of 

$500,000 in exploration over four years and issuing 600,000 common shares of Strateco 

over three years.  The property is also subject to a 2% NSR royalty in favour of Vija 

which also retains the rights for diamond exploration and production. 

 

The Matoush property was staked by Ditem Exploration Inc. (Ditem) in 2002 for its 

diamond potential.  Strateco announced on February 23, 2006 that it had signed a letter of 

intent with Ditem to acquire a 100% interest in the Matoush uranium property and this 

has now been accomplished. Strateco has held an option, since May 12, 2005, to acquire 

a 51% interest in the property The terms of the February 23, 2006 amended agreement 

are as follows: 
 

1) $10,000 to be paid upon signing the letter of intent; 

2) $140,000 to be paid within five days of the regulatory approval; 

3) 400,000 common shares of Strateco to be issued to Ditem.  

4) A 2% NSR royalty in favour of Ditem.

At the same time, Strateco gave notice to Ditem that Strateco would not exercise its 

option to acquire a 51% interest in the Beaver Lake uranium property also located in the 

Otish Mountains. 

 

For the type of exploration program being carried out by Strateco minimum 

permitting is required.  Permits are required regarding the preservation of watercourses 

and for the bridging of streams.  These permits are in place.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 

For most of the year the easiest access to the Matoush project is by air, either through 

charter helicopter or by fixed wing aircraft from the base at Témiscamie River located at 

the end of Provincial Highway 167, about 130 km southwest of Strateco's Matoush camp.  

During the winter months, material can be hauled to the camp along the old Eastmain 

Mine winter road which begins at the terminus of Provincial Highway 167 and passes 

seven kilometres to the west of the Strateco camp.   

 

CLIMATE 
The Lac Hippocampe plateau has a sub arctic climate implying harsh winters.  The 

lakes are ice-free from early-June to mid-October at best.  Winter temperatures average 

around -10ºC but range down to -40ºC.  Summer temperatures average in the 15ºC range 

but can reach 30ºC.  A relatively large amount of precipitation falls during both summer 

and winter and can amount to 80 cm overall.  Snow can reach a depth of several metres.  

Fog is frequent. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
Various services are available at the Cree community of Mistissini, including a 

grocery store, fuel and a health centre.  A full range of industry services is available in 

Chibougamau, including a hospital, an office of the mining sector of the Ministère des 

Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune du Québec, various mining contractors, an airport 

and a helicopter base (Girard, 2006).  There is daily airline service to Montreal from 

Chibougamau.   

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

 5-2

INFRASTRUCTURE 
There is presently no infrastructure on the properties other than the Strateco camp.  

The former winter road leading from Lake Albanel to the old Eastmain mine runs seven 

kilometres to the west of the property (Figure 4-2).  This road, which in the winter is used 

to move fuel and equipment to the Strateco camp, may be rebuilt to access the Soquem-

Stornoway Renard kimberlite prospect, 70 km to the north.   

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
The Matoush, Eclat and Matoush Extension properties lie on the Lac Hippocampe 

plateau (Figure 4-2), between Lake Mistassini and the Téchigami and Otish mountains to 

the northeast.  Relief is gentle with hills aligned north-northeast, south-southwest.  The 

average elevation is about 760 m asl.  Located near the watershed between the James Bay 

and St. Lawrence drainage systems, the area is poorly drained toward the Peribonca River 

to the south or the Téchigami River to the north.  There are no major waterways or lakes 

in the area but there is a multitude of small lakes (Girard, 2006).  Local topography is 

dominated by glacial features, in particular the drumlinoid ridges which are up to 30 m 

high and several kilometres long.  The elevation of the Strateco camp at Lac Matoush is 

about 780 m asl. 

 

The area is covered by a sparse sub-alpine taiga forest, mostly stunted black spruce 

with minor jack pine and white birch with no commercial value.  The highest elevations 

in the area can display a tundra-like environment.

6 HISTORY 
Major uranium exploration programs were carried out in the Otish Basin from 1965 to 

1985.  A synthesis of this work is provided in the thesis of. Genest (1989).  Exploration 

occurred in two successive waves.  The initial wave (1965-1975)included companies 

such as Soquem, Atlantic Ritchfields, Uranerz and Phelps Dodge targeting Elliot Lake-

type deposits, namely pyrite and uraninite paleoplacers in quartz pebble conglomerates.  

The second phase, from 1980 to 1985, targeted Athabasca unconformity-type deposits. 

This work was conducted mainly by Séru-Cogéma for the eastern half of the Otish Basin, 

and by various parties for the western half, including Uranerz, Soquem, Pan-Continental- 

Cominco and Esso Minerals.  While the work by Séru-Cogéma is thoroughly disclosed in 

assessment files, recorded work done on the western portion, including the Matoush 

properties, is fragmentary and incomplete (Girard, 2006). 

 

The Matoush uranium prospect was discovered in 1980 by Uranerz Exploration and 

Mining Ltd. (Uranerz) and work continued until 1984.  Extensive work was done in the 

general area (GM 40357, 40864, 41931, 57682), including airborne magnetics, EM and 

radiometric surveying, ground mapping, sampling, ground geophysics including 

electromagnetic and magnetic surveys, down hole gamma probing and 23 holes of 

exploration drilling.  The Matoush structure was defined geophysically for 3,900 m and 

tested over 900 m of strike by 17 drill holes.  One hole, AM-15, intersected significant 

mineralization, 0.95% U3O8 over 16 m, but the project was abandoned the next year. 

 

Following the discovery in 2002 of the Renard kimberlites 70 km to the north by the 

Ashton Diamonds/Soquem joint venture, the western portion of the Otish Basin 

experienced a staking rush and what is now the main Matoush property was acquired by 

Ditem Exploration Inc. (Ditem).  Ditem flew an aeromagnetic survey over a large area 

and collected till samples for heavy mineral analyses.  Apparently no kimberlite targets 

were defined on the Matoush property and no holes were drilled.  Ditem optioned the 

property to Strateco in May 2005 and Strateco now own it 100%, subject to a 2% NSR in 

favour of Ditem.

Strateco began work on the Matoush properties in early 2006 and to the end of 

August 2007 the following work was completed: 

• Construction of a temporary camp to accommodate 20 people in 2006, 

surpassed by construction of a camp to accommodate 45 people the following 

year. 

• A total of 123.6 km of line cutting. 

• UTEM-III deep probing electromagnetic survey over 94.5 line km. 

• 46,390 m of diamond drilling in 141 holes  

• Down-hole geophysics. 

• A helicopter-borne geophysical survey, including multichannel spectrometry, 

magnetics and frequency domain electromagnetic survey was flown by 

Aeroquest Surveys. The survey totalled 1,440 line km. 

• Alpha Track surveys.  

• Approximately 30 km2 of prospected area.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The following material is taken mainly from Chown and Caty (1973) and Chown 

(1984). 

 

The Otish Basin is one of a chain of intracratonic Proterozoic basins situated along 

the southern and southeastern margin of the Archean Superior Craton.  As preserved, the 

basin is a north easterly trending trough, at least 160 km long and averaging about 30 km 

in width (Figure 7-1).  The southern margin is defined mainly by the Grenville Front.  

The Otish Basin rests unconformably on Archean basement comprised of folded and 

metamorphosed supracrustal rocks, large areas of high grade quartzofeldspathic gneisses, 

migmatites and younger granitoid intrusions.  The generally flat lying, clastic formations 

were originally deposited on a weathered, regolithic Archean surface with high local 

relief.  The clastic material of all formations was derived from the Archean basement 

complexes north and east of the basin.  The Otish sedimentary sequence records a 

progression from a high energy fluvioterrestrial, syn-rift facies to a lower energy 

marginal marine depositional environment reflecting a change from initially reducing 

depositional conditions to oxidizing (Gatzweiler, 1987).   

 

The preserved Paleoproterozoic stratigraphy, defined as the Otish Group by Chown 

and Caty (1973), is comprised of the Lower Indicator Formation and the overlying 

Peribonca Formation.  The Indicator Formation, underlying the whole of the basin, is 

composed of conglomerates and sandstones and varies in thickness from 330 m at the 

type section to 760 m or more in the deeper western end of the basin.  The overall colour 

of the Indicator Formation is buff to white.  The Peribonca Formation conformably 

overlies the Indicator Formation and is found only in the centre and northeastern parts of 

the Otish Basin.  The Peribonca Formation is composed of red sandstones and minor 

conglomerates and bedded dolomite.  The maximum observed thickness is 380 m but the 

total thickness is unknown because the top of the formation is an erosion surface.  The 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 7-2

Otish Group is cut by a series of olivine tholeiite (gabbro) dikes and sills.  The dikes 

trend dominantly northerly, N45°E and N70°E.   

 

Strong fault patterns have been developed in the Otish Basin both before and as a 

result of the Grenville Orogeny.

LOCAL GEOLOGY 

The local geology is dominated by the generally flat lying Otish Group, a fluvial 

accumulation of sandstone and conglomerate with only minor carbonate intervals, the 

lower levels of which were deposited on a well developed basement regolith.  The 

regolith was initially covered by abundant fresh arkosic material derived from the 

basement during periodic rapid uplifts.  The quartz pebble conglomerates and more 

quartz-rich sandstone reflect regolith-derived material from the hinterland.  Initial 

southwest trending irregularities in the basement controlled the early depositional pattern 

which first swung to the south and then returned to the southwest.  These changes, as well 

as periodic changes in the type of clastics reflect continual normal fault movement, 

probably on north-south and northwest trending faults.  Two or more periods of 

reactivation tailing off into quiescence are indicated (Chown, 1984).  Two formations 

define the stratigraphic sequence, the Indicator and the Peribonca.  Chown and Caty 

(1973) quote a preliminary geochronological study suggesting that the Otish Group is 

older than 1,750 ma.   

 

The Indicator Formation varies from 330 m thick at the type section, about 100 km 

northeast of the Matoush properties, to 760 m or more in the deeper western end of the 

basin.  Four units are present in the Formation at the type section although all are not 

found throughout the basin and their thickness varies considerably from place to place.  

The basal unit (Unit 1) of the formation is composed of polymictic conglomerate and 

conglomeratic sandstones with minor sandstones.  This unit has two subdivisions at the 

type section.  The lower 90 m is dominated by pebbly conglomeratic sandstone and 

quartz-pebble conglomerate, whereas the upper 75 m contains mostly conglomeratic 

sandstones and interbedded massive and laminated sandstones.  Unit 2, called the lower 

sandstone unit, is 67 m thick at the type section and composed of buff and grey laminated 

and cross-laminated, well-sorted sandstone with minor red argillite beds.  The overlying 

Unit 3 assemblage, termed the upper conglomeratic sandstone unit, consists of buff to 

orange-pink conglomeratic sandstone and minor quartz-pebble conglomerate with 

intercalated sandstone.  In the type section the assemblage is only 11 m thick and consists

essentially of two conglomeratic sandstone intervals separated by sandstone.  The unit 

generally thickens to the west and contains several conglomerate intervals, many of them 

thickening and thinning locally.  At the west end of the basin, where the whole formation 

is over 610 m thick, this unit appears to be about 457 m thick with twelve intervals of 

conglomeratic sandstone of varying thickness.  The uppermost assemblage (Unit 4) in the 

type section is the upper sandstone unit composed of buff white and pink sandstone and 

minor red argillites.  This is 73m thick at the type section where it is cut off by a gabbro 

sill.  An estimated 60 m of sandstone probably overlies the sill.  Some beds near the top 

of the sequence are dolomite cemented (Chown and Caty, 1973).  It is not known if Unit 

4 is preserved in the western portion of the Basin.  Scott Wilson RPA assumes that the 

stratigraphy of interest on Strateco's Matoush properties is Unit 3 of the Indicator 

Formation. 

 

The Peribonca Formation, occupying the centre and northeastern parts of the Otish 

Basin, conformably overlies and appears to grade into the Indicator Formation. The 

universally red coloured Peribonca Formation is composed of red sandstones and minor 

conglomerates. The total thickness is unknown as the top of the formation is an erosion 

surface. The maximum observed thickness is 380 m. The formation is divided into a 

lower member (A) of well-sorted sandstone, minor conglomerate, and dolomite, and an 

upper member (B) of argillaceous sandstone and conglomerate (Chown and Caty, 1973). 

Work by Cogema in the eastern part of the Basin defined a 10 m to 20 m thick interval of 

dolomite/dolomitic sandstone overlain by purplish siltstones as the boundary between the 

Indicator and the Peribonca. Cogema also recognized a 1 m thick horizon of acid ash tuff 

at the base of the lowest dolomite that is thought to be an Otish Basin-wide marker for the 

Indicator/Peribonca boundary (Pauwels, 2005).  

 

The Otish Group is in general flat lying to gently undulating but defines a broad north 

easterly trending syncline because of gentle uplift along portions of the southern margin 

caused by reverse thrust faults along the Grenville Front.  Strong fault patterns have been 

developed in the Otish Basin both before and as a result of the Grenville Orogeny.  The 

faults are dominantly strike-slip, trending 060° (dextral) and 010° (sinistral), the latter 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 7-6

dominating towards the southwest (Chown, 1979).  Deformation along the Grenville 

Front has been dated at 1100 Ma (Baker, 1980) with some later movements which are 

believed to be related to later reverse fault movements following the main thrusting and 

metamorphism.  Metamorphic grade within the Otish Group sediments is lower 

greenschist at best. 

 

The Otish Group is cut by a series of olivine tholeiite (gabbro) dikes and sills.  The 

dikes, trending dominantly northerly N45E and N70E, appear to exploit and intrude faults 

that predate the Grenville deformation.  Bernier and Moorehead (2000) dated some of 

these dykes at 1,730 ± 30 ma.  Cogema dated fresh gabbros in the eastern Basin at 1,730 

± 10 ma (Sm-Nd) (Bisson et al, 1983). 

 

Quaternary glaciation blanketed the area of the Otish Basin with a variable but 

pervasive layer of glacial till.  Local topography is dominated by glacial features, in 

particular drumlinoid ridges up to 30 m high and several kilometres long.  Outcrop is 

poor.  Most of the hills, streams and lakes are elongated in the 200° glacial direction.  Ice 

advances were from the northeast.  Drumlins, eskers and kames are common in the area 

and range between 15 m and 30 m in height (Jenkins, 1984). 

 

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

Jenkins (1984) was the first to describe and subdivide the top 500 m of Indicator 

Formation on what is now termed the Matoush property.  By his interpretation, the 

lithologies represent fluvial sediments which were likely deposited in a braided river 

environment.  Two lithological facies types which repeat in the stratigraphic column were 

recognized in the drill core and termed: Active Channel Facies (ACF) and Channel-Bar 

Facies (CBF).

LITHOLOGIES 
The ACF consists of massive to slightly cross-bedded, gritty, coarse grained 

sandstone to conglomerate.  The sediments are poorly sorted with angular to subrounded 

grains and clasts.  The clast component consists of pebble to cobble size fragments of 

quartz, feldspar, granite and mudstone.  The conglomerates are dominantly matrix 

supported and the matrix is composed of clay-silt and medium to coarse sands.  The rocks 

are generally well cemented with silica.  The ACF is also characterized by numerous and 

sharp erosional contacts between individual beds.  A cyclic nature to the sedimentary 

deposition is also recognizable.  If a full cycle is preserved, it ranges from two metres to 

four metres in thickness.  The base of the cycle is a sharp erosional contact with the 

underlying bed, followed by a massive conglomerate which grades up into weakly cross-

bedded (large scale), very coarse grained sandstone.  The remaining section consists of 

well- to moderately-well cross-bedded medium-to coarse-grained sands.  The top of the 

cycle may be a laminated fine sand to silt layer one centimetre to two centimetres in 

thickness.  The ACF reaches a thickness in the range of 50 m.   

 

The CBF consists of medium-to coarse-grained, well cross-bedded, sorted, subarkosic 

sandstone.  The quartz and feldspar grains are subangular to subrounded.  The sandstone 

is well cemented with silica.  The cyclic nature of sedimentation is not as clearly defined 

in the unit due to gradational contacts and numerous mini cycles.  A cycle bounded by 

sharp erosional contacts in this facies may be greater than 15 m thick.  The cycle is 

composed of many mini cycles, 0.2 m to 0.5 m thick, which have minor erosional or 

gradational contacts.  The mini cycle consists of a basal coarse- to very coarse-grained 

cross-bedded sand, which grades rapidly into medium-grained well cross-bedded 

sandstone.  Rare thin siltstone layers can be present at the top of some mini cycles.  The 

CBF reaches a thickness in the range of 150 m (Jenkins, 1984). 

 

Recent detailed drilling by Strateco has elaborated considerably on the property 

stratigraphy.  At the Matoush Zone, there are approximately 800 m of Indicator 

Formation present, resting unconformably on a relatively unweathered, granitic 

basement.  Four ACF cycles have been recognized so far, separated by three CBF cycles.  



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 7-9

From surface downward these are identified as ACF 1 (35 m), CBF 1 (75 m), ACF 2 (5 

m), CBF 2 (85 m), ACF 3 (60 m), CBF 3 (100 m), ACF 4 (400 m), basal conglomerate 

(28 m) and basement regolith (4 m) (Figure 7-2).  Contacts are generally horizontal and 

transitional between all units though there are local erosional surfaces located at the lower 

boundary of ACF bands.  This stacking order and thickness is relatively constant 

throughout all drill holes in the area investigated.  The main Matoush mineralization, 

termed the AM-15 Zone, is hosted in ACF 3.  The smaller and eroded AM-8 Zone is 

found at surface in ACF 1 vertically above the AM-15 Zone.  Uranium mineralization of 

undefined extent has also been intersected in ACF 2 (L43 occurrence), ACF 3 (L45 

occurrence) 1.3 km south of AM-15 Zone and ACF 4 (22 Deep occurrence).   

 

Lafontaine (2007) summarizes the Matoush stratigraphy as two interlayered 

sedimentary facies that have subtle but important differences.  The Active Channel Facies 

(ACF) is a medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone to sub-conglomerate (Figure 7-3).  

It is immature with generally sub-angular to sub-rounded, 2 mm to 25mm clasts of quartz 

and potash feldspar (Kspar).  It is poorly sorted and can be locally arkosic to sub-arkosic.  

Silicification is moderate to locally intense.  Local porosity is relatively important since 

the bulk of the AM-15 Zone mineralization is hosted within ACF 3.

FIGURE 7-3   ACTIVE CHANNEL FACIES 
 

 
(Lafontaine, J., 2007) 

 

The Channel Bar Facies (CBF) is fine- to medium-grained, well sorted, mature, 

quartzose sandstones with trace Kspar content.  Grains are sub-rounded to rounded, 

typically less than two millimetres (Figure 6-2).  Silicification is typically intense but can 

be locally weak.  Unlike the ACF, bedding is thicker and normally well defined.  Local 

syn-sedimentary turbidity (?) may disturb bedding over core lengths of one metre without 

affecting the overall composition.  Soft-sedimentary structures or slumping may also 

cause this.  CBF facies frequently have minor silty layers and local thin argillite has been 

observed.

FIGURE 7-4   CHANNEL BAR FACIES 

 
(Lafontaine, J., 2007) 
 

An important local variation termed saccharoidal texture (Figure 6-3) has been noted 

at the base of CBF 2, immediately overlying the AM-15 Zone.  This texture reflects the 

local absence of strong silicification, giving the appearance of a sugary texture to the 

rock.  Although saccharoidal bands are typically less than 10 cm in true thickness, the 

close stacking (<5cm) of many bands over five metres to ten metres has been observed.  

The most important zones of saccharoidal texture are observed near the base of the CBF2 

which stratigraphically overlies the mineralized ACF3 rocks.  Porosity in these bands 

appears many times greater than in the remainder of the CBF and interestingly the AM-

15 mineralization extends upward into these rocks although it narrows considerably.  

Saccharoidal bands have clear bedding planes, may commonly show tilted bedding, and 

may have points rouge and points noire, hematitic and sooty pyritic alteration spots 

generally less than on centimetre in diameter.

STRUCTURE 
Little is known of the structural geology of the Matoush properties except that the 

stratigraphy is essentially flat lying and is cut by a number of north and northeast trending 

faults.  The AM-15 Zone is associated with a north trending fault structure occupied by a 

mafic dike.  The Matoush Fault is best described as a fault zone (MFZ) since it locally 

contains multiple strands of north trending, generally steep east dipping clay gouge and 

cataclastic breccia (Rhys, 2007).  The zone strikes at 007°, dips 85° E and is traceable on 

recent aeromagnetic surveys for at least 20 km.  No folding or re-orientation of the 

bedding is apparent in proximity to the Matoush Fault and no vertical offsets of marker 

units within the sequence or of the basal Otish Group unconformity are apparent across 

the fault or mineralization, at least in the area of detailed drilling.   

  

The lack of apparent vertical offset of sedimentary marker units across the Matoush 

Fault strands suggests that either displacement is minimal, or was dominantly strike slip, 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

resulting in little vertical apparent offset.  Uranium mineralization in the MFZ occurs 

along the trace of the Matoush fault where the structure steps to the east in plan view 

(Figure 7-3).  Here, the northeasterly trend of the outline of mineralization/alteration 

differs from the more northerly trend of the fault and mafic dyke.  The overall pattern 

suggests the occurrence of mineralization in a dilational bend within the fault system, 

which would imply a component of dextral (right lateral) displacement on the fault during 

mineralization (Rhys, 2007).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
A potential target on the Matoush project is an Athabasca unconformity-type uranium 

deposit.  The requisite, continental-scale geotectonic environment for these deposits is at 

the base of flat-lying, thin (<2 km), Proterozoic, red, fluviatile quartz-dominated 

siliclastic sequences of fluvial conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone resting on 

peneplained tectonometamorphic complexes in the interior of large cratons.  Variable 

thicknesses of red hematitic regolith underlie the strata, grading down through green 

chlorite-altered rock into fresh basement (Jefferson et al, 2007).  The model requires 

reactivated basement faults and two distinct hydrothermal fluids.  One fluid is reducing, 

originates in the basement and is channelled along basement faults.  A second, oxidizing 

fluid originates within the Athabasca sandstone stratigraphy and migrates through the 

inherent porosity therein.  In appropriate circumstances, these two fluids mix and 

precipitate uranium in a structural trap at the sub-Athabasca unconformity.   

 

In cross section, the Athabasca model envisages a mushroom-shaped deposit 

replacing the lower sandstone with a root zone extending into the basement along a fault 

usually coincident with graphitic pelite.  Perched mineralization may occur (or may have 

been remobilized) in the controlling fault structures, in the sandstone, well above the 

unconformity.  It is implicit in this model that basement faults have been reactivated and 

that the overlying Proterozoic stratigraphy has been locally disrupted.   

 

In plan view the deposits can be hundreds of metres long and a few metres to 30 m 

wide and/or thick and following the trace of the underlying graphitic pelites and 

associated faults, along the unconformity.  The graphitic rocks are often the locus of pre-

Athabasca faulting that has been reactivated after Athabasca deposition.   

 

Unconformity deposits are marked by a complex mineralogy and geochemistry.  

Pitchblende, uraninite and coffinite are the primary uranium minerals accompanied, 

variously by nickel sulphides, molybdenite, copper sulphides, galena, sphalerite, 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 8-2

hematite, goethite, psilomelane, native copper and gold.  Gangue minerals include quartz, 

calcite, dolomite, ankerite, siderite, chlorite, sericite and adularia (SGS, 2003). 

 

Unconformity-type uranium deposits are surrounded by extensive alteration 

envelopes that may extend upwards into the Athabasca group for tens to even 100 m or 

more above the unconformity and penetrate well into the crystalline basement.  

Hydrothermal alteration is variously marked by chloritization, tourmalinization (high B, 

dravite), hematization (several episodes), illitization, silicification and dolomitization 

(Hoeve, 1984).   

 

While sharing some characteristics with Athabasca unconformity-type uranium 

deposits, e.g. Proterozoic sedimentary environment, probable Proterozoic age, similar 

mineralization and alteration and prominent structural control, the Matoush AM-15 Zone 

has significant differences.  The AM-15 mineralization occurs at least 520 m above the 

basement without demonstrably significant uranium mineralization at the unconformity 

hence the Zone should probably not be termed a perched deposit.  The deposit does occur 

at the intersection of a basement penetrating fault (occupied by a mafic dike) and an 

apparent peleoaquifer, the ACF 3 unit.  The Matoush stratigraphy and mineralization may 

also be older than that in the Athabasca basin and the deposit style might for the present 

simply be termed Otish-type uranium.

9 MINERALIZATION 
AM-15 ZONE 

The best defined uranium mineralization on the Matoush project is the AM-15 Zone 

which is localized at the intersection of the ACF 3 unit with the gabbro dike-hosting 

Matoush Fault Zone (MFZ).  As currently defined, the AM-15 Zone is dominantly a 

stratabound, north trending body of uranium mineralization hosted mainly within the 

ACF 3 unit.  The mineralization does have a shallow overall plunge of 15º to the south 

such that there is some mineralization in the underlying CBF 4 sandstones and in the 

overlying CBF 3 sandstones, at the south and north ends respectively.  The indicated and 

inferred mineral resources, as estimated by Scott Wilson RPA for the AM-15 Zone, occur 

within four roughly vertically oriented lenses that form an overall strike length of 300 m 

through a vertical distance of 50 m to 100 m at a depth ranging from 175 m to 275 m 

below surface.  These lenses have been assigned the names: Main Lens, South Lens, 

Upper Lens, and North Lens (Figure 9-1).   

 

The Main Lens is the largest of the four identified at the AM-15 Zone with 

dimensions of approximately 235 m along strike, 50 m down dip and a thickness ranging 

between 2 m and 15 m, with an average thickness of 7.5 m.  In cross section, the Main 

Lens varies from roughly ovoid to tabular.   

 

The South Lens (SL) forms a splay from the Main Lens, with a near vertically 

dipping tabular form.  It is roughly 190 m along strike, 30 m down dip, and averages 

three to four metres in thickness.  It is the only lens that extends into the CBF 3 unit.  

 

The North Lens (NL) has an elongated form with dimensions of 150 m along strike, 

20 m to 45 m down dip, and approximately three metres in thickness.  It is located within 

the ACF 3, below the Main Lens.   

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 9-2

The Upper Lens (UL) is the smallest and has the lowest grade of the four identified 

lenses.  It is a thin vertical lens located above the Main and South lenses entirely within 

the CBF 2 unit.  It is approximately 35 m by 40 m and 2 m thick.

The uranium mineralization in the AM-15 Zone, occurring within a much broader

secondary uranophane is also present.  The mineralization is distributed on both sides of 

the fault but is generally thicker on the south or hanging wall side.  According to 

Gatzweiler (1987), the mineralization (seen by Uranerz) consists of pitchblende and 

minor coffinite with subordinate sulphides, arsenides and selenides including pyrite, 

chalcocite, covellite, bravoite, gersdorfite, niccolite, maucherite, sphalerite, galena and 

clausthalite.  Geochemically, the mineralization is characterized by Cr, V, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, 

Cu, Bi, Au, Se and Te, based on Strateco trace element analyses.   

 

The bulk of the uranium mineralization in the AM-15 Zone occurs along the trace of 

the MFZ where the structure steps to the east in plan view.  Here, the northeasterly trend 

of the outline of mineralization/alteration differs from the more northerly trend of the 

fault and mafic dike.  The overall pattern suggests the occurrence of mineralization in a 

dilational bend within the fault system, which would imply a component of dextral (right 

lateral) displacement on the fault during mineralization (Rhys, 2007). In this context, it is 

noted that the pitchblende-quartz veins mentioned above, ranging in width up to five 

centimetres or more, strike east-west and dip steeply.  The prismatic fill to these veins 

indicates that they are extension veins that could have formed in response to strike slip 

displacement on the MFZ and reflect dilatational opening in the proposed jog setting to 

the mineralized zone (Rhys, 2007).   

 

The AM-15 Zone is largely stratabound, being preferentially localized within the 50 

m -70 m thick flat-lying coarse-grained sandstone to sub-conglomerate ACF 3 unit, 

between finer-grained sandstone and siltstone-bearing horizons above (CBF 2) and below 

(CBF 3).  While the CBF 2-ACF 3 contact appears to be planar, the lower ACF 3 contact 

as defined by drilling below the AM-15 Zone is quite irregular and shows local dramatic 

relief of 20 m or more (Figure 9-2).  This may indicate that there was truly an active 

paleochannel scoured into the stratigraphic footwall of AM-15 and that during the 

mineralizing event this was a highly productive paleoaquifer channelling oxidized basin 

water into the MFZ.

ALTERATION 
From their generally shallower drilling, Uranerz recognized a zoned alteration halo up 

to 50 m wide developed symmetrically around the MFZ and comprised of an inner 

tourmaline zone surrounded by a Mg-chlorite and Cr-V muscovite zone.  Hematite and 

limonite form the outermost halo (Gatzweiler, 1987). 

 

A dramatic aspect of the AM-15 Zone is its association, on both sides of the MFZ, 

with a wide alteration package the most noticeable aspect of which is the central zone of 

dark green to apple green colours.  Rhys (2007) recognizes a diffuse outer halo of reddish 

hematite or limonite alteration followed inward by an outer pale to apple green vanadium 

and chromium phyllosilicate zone which may be composed of fuchsite and/or roscoelite.  

This outer zone may locally be >10 m thick comprising patchy green phyllosilicate 

alteration of variable intensity often separated by intervals of bleached sandstone.  This 

chromium-vanadium phyllosilicate alteration may occur on both sides of the mineralized 

zone, but generally is best developed on the hanging wall (east side) of the MFZ.   

 

Sharply to gradationally succeeding the vanadium-chromium phyllosilicate zone is an 

inner mottled dark green-grey zone of magnesium-chlorite (?) dominant alteration which 

contains variable quantities of disseminated pitchblende throughout.  This uranium-

bearing style of alteration frequently forms a large portion of the mineralized zone, as a 

pervasively or patchy green-grey altered area.  Gatzweiler (1987) describes the principal 

dominant mineral in this zone as magnesium chlorite, which imparts the dark green-grey 

colour.  Tourmaline could also be common in blebs with chlorite and pitchblende.  The 

inner pale grey-green alteration zone often occurs in the core of the wider mineralized 

intercepts and comprises mottled pale grey-green altered sandstone with pitchblende 

blebs.  Patches of reddish limonite-hematite are common and often associated with the 

largest blebs of pitchblende.  This style of alteration may vary from several meters to 

greater than 10 m wide.  It has gradational contacts, and may alternate with the darker 

green, more chlorite-rich style of alteration described above. It also contains possible 

disseminated tourmaline.   

 

The innermost alteration zone noted is the mottled to banded tourmaline zone 

occurring locally immediately adjacent to, and on either side of strands of the Matoush 

fault and dyke.  This style of alteration is narrow, generally confined to less than two  

metres from the fault and occurs most commonly marginal to the AM-15 Zone.  Strateco 

have found the tourmaline zone to be spatially limited and irregular.   

 

A late white clay alteration occurs within the MFZ, altering the gabbro dike where 

present, surrounding the fault strands and extending into the adjacent sandstones.  The 

most intense clay alteration is in and near the AM-15 Zone, where clay alteration can 

extend several metres into the surrounding sandstone, overprinting earlier alteration 

assemblages associated with uranium mineralization.  Although clearly postdating most if 

not all mineralization/alteration, it is unclear if the clay gouge and associated clay 

alteration along the fault strands represent a late phase in the hydrothermal system and 

continuation of synmineralization displacement, or a completely unrelated phase of much 

younger faulting/alteration which just exploits the earlier mineralizing fault surfaces.  

Either way, the brittle fault strands coincide with the location of alteration along the fault, 

and even in areas distal to known mineralized zones, chlorite and roscoelite-fuchsite 

alteration is sporadically developed in the surrounding sandstone to the fault, suggesting 

that following the fault is a valid exploration method (Rhys, 2007).

Strong alteration without significant mineralization has been intersected in the MFZ 

on the Eclat property six kilometres south of the AM-15 Zone and five kilometres to the 

north within the Matoush property. 

 

OTHER MINERALIZED ZONES 
The smaller and eroded AM-8 Zone is found at surface in ACF 1, approximately 200 

m vertically above the AM-15 Zone.  Uranium mineralization of undefined extent has 

also been intersected in ACF 2 (L43 occurrence) and ACF 4 (22 Deep occurrence, 0.31% 

U3O8 over 1.4 m).  The 22 Deep occurrence is 200 m above the basement unconformity 

and about 330 m vertically beneath the AM-15 Zone.  All of this mineralization is located 

within the MFZ and is referred to as Otish-type uranium mineralization.  One should also 

bear in mind however, that there could be unconformity-type deposits on the property 

where the MFZ or other basement rooted faults traverse a basement of deeply weathered 

metasediments or metavolcanics.  Unconformity-type uranium mineralization does occur 

at the Camie River prospect, on the southern edge of the Otish Basin, 22 km south of the 

AM-15 Zone.

In the period February to April, 2006, Lamontagne Geophysics carried out 94 line km 

of UTEM-III surveying along six lines laid out parallel to the north-south trending MFZ 

with three lines on either side.  The purpose of the survey was to determine if there were 

any basement conductors in or near the Matoush Fault and to estimate depth to basement.  

The lines were spaced at 400 m intervals and the area surveyed was two kilometres wide 

and nine kilometres long (parallel to the fault).  A transmitter loop (approx. 1.5 km by 2.0 

km) was laid out across the north end of the lines and readings were taken alternately to 

the south and north from the loop front.  Six such loops were utilized to cover the lines 

from north to south.  A total of 94.225 km of UTEM data was collected with a nominal 

station spacing of 50 m.  All lines were surveyed measuring the vertical component, Hz, 

in 10-channel mode at a transmitter frequency of 30.974 Hz.   

 

Overall the background response seen in the UTEM profiles indicates a resistive 

stratigraphic sequence.  Features outlined are mainly contacts, northwest to northeast 

shallow (?) conductors and conductive zones - geological units, lake bottoms and 

structural features.  Several of these features are continuous across the grid.  No 

responses indicative of features at a depth of greater than 100 m to 300 m are evident on 

the profiles (Elson and Langridge, 2007).  Therefore there were no conductors detected in 

the basement which is at a depth of 800 m below surface.   

 

AIRBORNE SURVEYS 
In August 2006, Aeroquest Limited flew a 1,439.7 line-km survey over the Matoush 

properties.  Line spacing was 100 m and flying azimuth was east-west (088º).  

Instrumentation employed included Aeroquest's IMPULSE® helicopter-borne, six

frequency electromagnetic system, two high-sensitivity cesium vapour magnetometers 

and a five crystal gamma ray spectrometer.   

 

A gridded image of the coaxial quadrature phase component of the 21,750 Hz high 

frequency for the Aeroquest Impulse system exhibits an approximately north-south 

trending, thin, positive anomaly, interpreted to be consistent with a weakly conductive 

response due to a thin zone of alteration/clays and groundwater within the MFZ.  The 

electromagnetic (EM) response follows much of the same strike as indicated for the 

Matoush dike in the magnetic data, as discussed below, save for a slight offset of the EM 

response to the west of the magnetic response.  This may reflect increased 

porosity/alteration or fracturing, and relevant groundwater content, along the western 

margin of the Matoush dike (?).   

 

The aeromagnetic results display a distinct structural (?) striping at azimuths of 006° 

and 020°.  The MFZ is clearly visible and a variety of other north trending faults have 

been interpreted.  The Matoush structure appears to be clearly delineated by a thin, dike-

like north-south feature comprised of a series of 005° to 008° trending positive high-

frequency magnetic anomalies of moderate intensity, which are probably due to a mafic 

dike system that is within the MFZ.  This feature overprints similar linear magnetic 

lineaments, trending at a approximately 020° which are ubiquitous over the property and 

of unknown cause.  The Matoush dike magnetic response exhibits offsets and breaks 

along-strike and can be traced for roughly 12 km within the southern Matoush airborne 

geophysical block.  There are at least two similar and parallel features interpreted, one on 

either side of the MFZ.   

 

The radiometric data exhibited linear, ice-direction parallel (?) streaks in the uranium, 

thorium and potassium channels, trending roughly at an azimuth of 020.  Discrete 

maximum uranium peaks (approximately 4 ppm) within these streaks are occasionally 

coincident with the locations of uraniferous boulders reported from field prospecting, 

immediately down-ice from the main Matoush AM-15 Zone on lines 3000S and 3100S.  

These data imply that a number of linear boulder trains potentially exist on the property, 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 10-3

with the possibility of containing uraniferous boulders that relate to structurally 

controlled mineralization.  Ground follow-up is currently being done on several areas 

with apparent surface sources of radioactivity.  Further interpretation of the radiometric 

data appears to be required. 

 

GROUND GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS 
In addition to the UTEM survey, three other methods were tested in 2006.  VLF was 

tested by the first geological team sent in by IOS using a hand-held device.  Response 

was generally quite good as the MFZ and minor subsidiary faults were accurately mapped 

over lengths of several kilometres even with lines spaced by several hundred metres. 

 

Géosig was mandated to complete a two-phase program that included ground 

magnetics using a proton precession magnetometer and a Max-Min HLEM system.  

Measurements were made on 100-m spaced cut lines.  Responses were not as clear as 

expected and interpretations gave little or no additional information to complement the 

airborne survey.  The Max Min method outlined only poor conductors. 

 

PROSPECTING 
In 2006, some prospecting highlighted the uraniferous boulder trend that ends near 

the AM-8 zone.  Other minor spot anomalies were detected but could not be followed up 

for lack of data.  In 2007, a massive and ongoing targeted boulder prospecting campaign 

was launched to cover as much ground as possible.  Prospecting is done by teams of 

three.  The leader follows a 000º or a 090º bearing with a prospector on his left and right 

flank covering an equivalent of a 100 m band while systematically recording the 

background values with hand-held scintillometers.  If anomalous boulders are identified, 

the teams zero in to find a trend.   

 

This systematic approach was developed in response to poor outcrop exposure.  It has 

to date uncovered anomalous boulder trends which roughly vary in the 015º to 035º 

directions, and from less than 0.3 km to greater than 1 km in length.  Boulders with 

scintillometer readings of over 1,000 cps have been prioritized for follow-up work.  It is 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

felt that additional prospecting will be needed to ensure that these trends have adequately 

been covered and their up-ice source is potentially identified.  This systematic technique 

has covered important areas with no airborne geophysical cover.  To date, over 57 

boulders with over 1,000 cps have been located in several portions of the property.  As of 

September 1, the clearest uraniferous boulder trend that can be tracked up ice is the trend 

that trails from the AM-8 zone.  However, numerous other trends parallel to glaciation 

direction are highly prospective.   

 

ALPHATRACKS 
In June and July 2006, a technique of radon gas measurements was employed to 

attempt to identify potentially uraniferous deposits near surface through radon gas 

seepage from the MFZ.  A similar technique, TRACK ETCH, was used by Uranerz for 

prospecting in the area.  Alphatracks are plastic cups inserted upside-down approximately 

30 cm to 60 cm into the ground.  Cups were separated by 25 m intervals on lines 

irregularly spaced over the property, oriented approximately at 095 or near perpendicular 

to the MFZ.  A small 1cm2 alpha and gamma sensitive film is located inside the cup and 

activated by removing the shielding (masking tape).  Collection of these cups is made 

approximately one month after their installation, taking care to note ground conditions.  

Results are calculated in tracks per mm2.  Internal quality control included blanks and 

duplicates and accounted for approximately 8% of all values.  Blanks are cups with 

shielding left in place, duplicates are two cups inserted one next to the other in the same 

small hole.   

 

Alphatrack cups appear to interest several local small rodents as they destroyed or 

disturbed numerous stations leaving only spotty records on certain lines, in particular 

those stations located near the MFZ.  As results are locally sporadic, no overall statistical 

interpretation could be made from this survey, although some collected alpha tracks did 

appear to be subject to anomalous amounts of radon gas with recorded values as high as 

20,000 tracks per mm2. Although some Alphatrack anomalies correspond well with 

certain known radioactivity sources such as exposed trenches, cost estimates indicate that, 

overall, a soil or till sampling program may be better suited to the needs of this property.

DOWN HOLE PROBING -2006 
In 2006, down hole probing was done on 15 Strateco drill holes by Géophysique GPR 

Inc. of Montreal using a spectral probe.  Attempts were made to use other down hole 

geophysical tools.  This included magnetic and electric measurements taken in order to 

characterize physical properties of the mineralized rock and hopefully to have a semi-

quantitative uranium grade evaluation.  Results for the spectral probing were not 

conclusive and the probing was abandoned.  Electric and magnetic tests were not 

completed due to ground control problems and poor coupling parameters.   

 

DOWN HOLE PROBING -2007 
DGI Geoscience Ltd of Sudbury, Ontario, was mandated to attempt down hole 

gamma probing using a triple gamma instrument.  Measurement of local magnetic and 

electric properties of the rock were also attempted with other down hole equipment 

though again, results were unsatisfactory due to lack of appropriate electrical coupling 

and drill grease remaining in the bore hole.   

 

DGI completed 52 down hole triple gamma probing studies with considerable 

success.  A simple gamma instrument on loan from Cameco was also used.  Drill holes 

are systematically probed from top to bottom except for a core tube length at the bottom 

of the rods.  Extremely poor ground conditions (e.g. significant lengths of caved sand) 

limited the down hole access to only a few holes.  Approximately 10 holes with data from 

both the triple gamma instrument (DGI) and the simple gamma probe (Cameco) has 

revealed excellent to near perfect correlation of down hole data in all doubly surveyed 

holes.  Down hole probing has been done in 41 scattered holes drilled prior to DDH MT-

07-71, and systematically in every hole drilled thereafter.   

 

Results from both triple and simple gamma probing have yielded conclusive evidence 

that there is a measurable correlation between grade and gamma radiation.  Although 

locally different from assayed results, the estimated grades from down hole probing have 

to date given comparable or near-identical GT (grade-thickness) estimates to GT values 

from assaying.  Variations of GT are assumed to be due to core loss at or near

 10-6

mineralized zones or natural grade variations between the drill core and the actual in-situ 

rocks, as for example where a hole has cored adjacent to but not through a high grade 

pitchblende vein.  Results from the simple gamma probe can also be coupled with core 

logging to identify the different facies and their variations.  The ACF tend to have a 

generally higher value with evident spikes scattered throughout the length of the 

intersection (all below 30 cps).  The CBF tend to have generally lower gamma responses 

and are much more even with few if any gamma spikes.  The gamma spiking is thought 

to be related to K feldspar content of the host rock. 

 

DIAMOND DRILLING 
Diamond drilling has been ongoing at the Matoush project since early 2006.  Details 

of this work are described below.

11 DRILLING 
 Drilling on the Matoush project has been contracted to Major Drilling International 

Ltd. which uses a combination of Major 50 drill rigs and a Versadrill kmb.8 fly drill 

using NQ down hole tools that produce drill core of 47 mm diameter.  Collar locations for 

all holes have been determined by differential GPS.  All set ups are clearly identified with 

a 12 ft steel rod protruding from the ground.  All casings are identified with an aluminum 

cap with the engraved drill hole number.  The three dimensional location of all Strateco 

holes is determined with a Flex-it instrument in single point mode which measures the 

dip and azimuth at 50 m intervals down the hole with an initial test taken 15 m below the 

casing and a final at the bottom.  Casings were left in all holes but were removed from 

drill holes completed on lakes.   

 

Total drilling from 2006 through to August 31, 2007 amounted to 47,814 m in 149 

holes.  This is subdivided into 11 exploration holes in the southern portion of the 

property, near Lac Eclat, six deep basement-intersecting holes, and two exploration holes 

at the northern end of the Southern Matoush claim block.  A further 115 holes are in the 

horizon hosting the AM-15 Zone, including 30 drill holes targeting various geophysical 

and structural anomalies to the north and south.  A total of 15 holes were drilled in the 

vicinity of the AM-8 Zone.  As of August 31, 2007, no drill holes were completed in the 

Matoush Extension property.   

 

Probing with a Mount Sopris simple gamma logging unit was completed 

systematically on every drill hole as described in Section 10.   

 

Sampling of the holes was guided by the radiometric logs.  Samples were generally 

between 0.5 and 1 m in length but shorter (down to 0.3 m) when required by geological 

contacts or exceptionally high radioactive zones.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The mineralized rocks at the Matoush project are sandstones and pebble 

conglomerates.  Core recovery is generally excellent except in the fault strands of the 

MFZ.  The core is descriptively logged on site and marked for sampling.  All drill core in 

the fault zone is also carefully measured with a hand held spectrometer (GR-135 from 

SAIC) by removing each piece of drill core from the ambient background, noting the 

most pertinent reproducible result, and carefully returning it to its correct place in the 

core box.   

 

Strateco samples all drill core in fault zone intersections and samples for which hand 

held spectrometer readings exceed 100 counts per second (cps).  Sample lengths vary 

between fifty centimetres to one metre; occasionally 30 cm sample lengths are used.  

Sampling intervals are determined by lithology, alteration, nature of the mineralization 

and the radiometric values of intervals.  Barren samples are taken to shoulder both ends 

of mineralized intersections; shoulder lengths are at least one metre samples on either end 

but may be significantly more in areas with strong mineralization.  Short sample intervals 

are typically higher grade mineralization with readings of 30,000 cps to greater than 

60,000 cps.   

 

Core samples are tracked by three-part ticket books.  One part is stapled into the core 

box along with an aluminum Dymo tag with the same number, at the beginning of the 

assay interval.  One tag goes with the sample for assay and the last tag is kept with the 

geologist's records.  Core trays are marked with aluminum tags as well as felt marker.   

 

All core is split with a hand or hydraulic splitter according to sample intervals marked 

on the core.  One half of the core is preserved in the box for future reference and the other 

half is bagged, tagged and sealed in a plastic bag.  The bags of samples are placed in 

large plastic or metal pails and sealed for shipping.  Bags of highly radioactive material 

are covered with natural shielding which may be as simple as barren samples, or sand, to 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 12-2

reduce radioactivity to required levels for transportation before the shipping pails are 

sealed.   

 

The sampled material sent for assay is for the most part an accurate reflection of one 

half of the core and should be free of bias because of the very competent nature of the 

core recovered.  However, the mineralization is localized along either side of a crumbly, 

clay-altered fault zone from one metre to two metres wide, and despite precautions taken 

during drilling there can be significant core loss over short intervals.  In such instances, 

the core recovered is unlikely to be representative of the fault interval but an accurate 

measurement of the U3O8 content is determined by the gamma logging probe which is 

run in every hole.  

 

From the drilling done to date it has been determined that the AM-15 Zone is 

essentially vertically dipping.  Since all the drill holes used to define the AM-15 are 

inclined at -45º or -60º, core length intersections in such holes must be corrected to true 

width of mineralization.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 

As described in Section 12, core from the Matoush project is logged, marked for 

sampling, split and bagged for shipment by Strateco personnel.  In early 2006 Strateco 

was adding one blank sample and one quarter split duplicate each with every 14 samples 

but current policy is to add only one duplicate every eight or nine samples.   

 

As noted previously, pails of samples are sealed at the Strateco camp then flown by 

helicopter or float plane to the Témiskamie float plane base, trucked to Chibougamau and 

from there sent by courier to the SRC in Saskatoon.  The Geoanalytical Laboratories at 

the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) are unique facilities offering high quality 

analytical services to the exploration industry.  The laboratory has a Quality Assurance 

program dedicated to actively seeking to evaluate and continually improve the internal 

quality management system.  The laboratory is accredited by the Standards Council of 

Canada as an ISO/IEC 17025 Laboratory for Mineral Analysis Testing.  The laboratory is 

licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for possession, transfer, 

import, export, use and storage of designated nuclear substances by CNSC License 

Number 01784-1-09.3.  As such, the laboratory is closely monitored and inspected by the 

CNSC for compliance.  

 

On arrival at SRC samples are sorted into lots according to radioactivity level 

(normal, 1 dot, 2 dot, 3 dot, 4 dot and UR, (unreadable above 5,000 cps)), prepped and 

analyzed in that order.  With each batch of samples run, SRC inserts at the minimum, a 

blank sample, a duplicate from the batch and a QC standard of its own.  After standard 

sample preparation, SRC analyzes for U3O8 content by several means.  ICP 4-3R (partial 

digestion) and fluorimetry are used on samples with U3O8 less than 100 PPM.  ICP 4-3 

(total digestion) is employed on samples with normal to high radioactivity, hence for the 

majority of the samples submitted.  Samples done by ICP 4-3 also have the full package 

of trace elements run.  Samples with greater than 1,000 ppm U3O8 are also subjected to 

an Aqua Regia digestion before determination of wt% U3O8 also by ICP.

Scott Wilson RPA concurs with the adequacy of the samples taken, the security of the 

shipping procedures, the sample preparations and analytical procedures at SRC.  We 

recommend that blanks and standards be submitted by Strateco with every ten samples.  

Further, we recommend that in future batches of a variety of pulps from SRC be sent to at 

least two other laboratories for check analyses.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
INDEPENDENT ASSAY OF DRILL CORE 

During the site visit on June 16, 2007, Barry Cook and David Ross of Scott Wilson 

RPA selected and marked out six samples of split core for duplicate analysis.  The 

specified intervals were quarter split by a technician under supervision by Mr. Ross.  

David Ross and Barry Cook then bagged, tagged and sealed the samples in plastic bags.  

The bags of samples were packed in a metal pail, covered with sand and barren drill core 

as shielding and shipped by helicopter to a courier company in Chibougamau.  From 

Chibougamau, the pail was sent by courier to the Scott Wilson RPA offices in Toronto 

and from there they were forwarded by courier to the SGS laboratory in Don Mills, 

Ontario.  Because of the expected high contents of uranium, SGS forwarded the samples 

to their facility in Lakefield, Ontario, for analysis.  Table 14-1 indicates the relevant 

sample information, SGS assay results and the original uranium assays as determined by 

the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC). 

 

SGS is accredited to the ISO 17025 Standard by Certificate number 456.  The content 

of U3O8 in the samples was determined by borate fusion XRF.  Descriptions of the 

analytical procedures used by SGS are outlined in Appendix 2.

The independent sampling by Scott Wilson RPA clearly indicates that there is 

significant uranium mineralization in the drill holes sampled.  Six quartered-core 

duplicates are insufficient to make reliable statistical comparisons, however it is 

important to note that except for one sample, with negligible uranium content, all of the 

U3O8 values determined by SGS are uniformly lower than those from SRC.  While 

sample inhomogeneity may partly account for the differences it may also be reflective of 

the differing analytical procedures.  Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Strateco 

implement a rigorous QA/QC protocol for drill core assaying (see below).  

 

DATABASE VERIFICATION 

Most of the drill hole database was compiled by Tech2Mine Inc., of Val d'Or 

Quebec.  As part of the compilation process, Tech2Mine verified a large portion of the 

database against original records such as drill logs and assay certificates.  Several errors 

were identified and corrected.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA verified 233 U3O8 assay records in digital database against copies 

of the assay certificates.  This represents 13% of the all assay records.  No errors were 

identified.   

 

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 

In early 2006 Strateco were adding one blank sample and one quarter split duplicate 

each with every 14 samples but current policy is to add only one duplicate every eight or 

nine samples.  Results are described below.   

 

Strateco have initiated a QA/QC program supervised by dedicated, on site 

personnel .When fully implemented, in addition to quarter split duplicates, Scott Wilson 

RPA recommends that sample batches include some combination of blanks, Certified 

Reference Materials, reject duplicates and pulp duplicates. The intent is to identify any 

Quality Control failures which would in turn trigger re-analysis of sample batches.

BLANKS 
The regular submission of blank material is used to assess contamination during 

sample preparation and to identify sample numbering mistakes.  SRC's system of sorting 

samples in ascending order of radioactivity (see Section 13) helps eliminate significant 

contamination from preceding samples.  Nevertheless, Scott Wilson RPA recommends 

that Strateco continue submitting blank material.   

 

A total of 54 blank samples with assay results were provided to Scott Wilson RPA for 

analysis.  Assay results in Figure 14-3 are plotted in ascending order of sample number.  

The highest blank assay reported 15.7 ppm U, though 80% of the assays were under 5 

ppm U.  Although these values are acceptable for blanks, Scott Wilson RPA notes that 

the variation of assays increased with increasing sample number.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
An interesting analogy to the Matoush Zone and previously the largest known zone of 

mineralization in the Otish Basin is the L Zone discovered by Cogema in 1980.  Located 

approximately 80 km northeast of Matoush, in the eastern Otish Basin, the L Zone is 

located much higher in the stratigraphy but shares some striking similarities with the AM-

15 Zone.  Scott Wilson RPA has been unable to verify the information concerning the L 

Zone, and that information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the 

property that is the subject of the technical report.   

 

As described by Caillat (1984), the mineralization is associated with a N70E striking 

sub-vertical gabbro dike that was emplaced along a fault zone with the southern block 

down dropped at least 150 m.  The gabbro dike formed a sill-like protrusion at the level 

of the 10 m - 20 m thick dolomite beds that mark the boundary between the Peribonca 

and Indicator formations.  This resulted in strong deformation within the carbonate beds 

near the gabbro contact.  Uranium mineralization appears to have pooled below the 

carbonates in sandstones and in the gabbro.  Mineralization appears to be ribbon-like 

along the fault and has been traced for a strike length of 1,700 m but is continuous only 

over the easternmost 600 m and occurs at a depth of no more than110 m below surface.  

Widths of strong mineralization range up to seven metres.  

 

Mineralized zones are pervasively altered and brecciated and the gabbro is bleached 

grey.  About half of the mineralization at the L Zone is hosted by sandstones of the 

Indicator Formation.  Alteration minerals in the gabbro include albite, carbonate, quartz 

and sericite.  Alteration of the host sediments is not described in detail but includes clay 

alteration, sericitization and silicification which in part are local diagenetic aspects of the 

sandstone.  Elements associated with the uranium mineralization include Bi, Au, Ag, Cu, 

Pb, Se and Te (Pauwels, 2005). 

 

Séru Nucléaire (predecessor of Cogema) estimated a resource for the L Zone based on 

33 drill holes on 50 m centres and over a strike length of 612 m (Caillat and others,

1983).  Using a cut off grade of 0.1% U and mineralized intercepts of 0.2 m to 6.9 m, 

they estimated 385,000 t grading 0.595% U and 0.5 g/t Au.  This is a historical resource 

estimation, non-compliant with NI 43-101, and should not be relied upon. 

 

An interesting aspect of the L Zone mineralization is the implied older age compared 

to the Athabasca Basin.  Age determinations on the mineralization done by Cogema 

(U/Pb) gave 1,711 ± 2 ma as compared to an age of 1,730 ±10 ma (Sm-Nd) obtained 

from fresh gabbro samples (Bisson et al, 1983).  Available geochronology of the 

Athabasca Basin uranium deposits suggests two primary hydrothermal ore-related events 

within the basin at ca. 1,600 ma to 1,500 ma and 1,460 ma to 1,350 ma.  The period of 

sedimentation in the Athabasca Basin spanned from about 1,740 ma to at least 1,640 ma 

(Jefferson et al, 2007).

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL 
RESERVE ESTIMATES 
GENERAL STATEMENT 

Scott Wilson RPA has prepared a mineral resource estimate for the AM-15 Zone at 

Matoush using drill hole data available as of September 6, 2007 (Table 17-1).  A set of 

cross sections and plan views were interpreted to construct three dimensional (3D) grade-

shell wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 0.05% U3O8.  The mineralization making up 

the mineral resource is shared among four vertical lenses controlled by the Matoush Fault 

Zone (MFZ): Main Lens, South Lens, North Lens and an Upper Lens.  Variogram 

parameters were interpreted from one metre composited assay values.  Block model U3O8 
grades within the wireframe models were estimated by ordinary kriging.   

 

Indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79% U3O8 
containing 3.48 million pounds U3O8.  Inferred mineral resources are estimated to total 

65,000 tonnes grading 0.43% U3O8 containing 0.62 million pounds U3O8.  There are no 

mineral reserves estimated at Matoush.

Notes: 
1. CIM Definitions were followed for mineral resources. 
2. Grade-shell wireframes at 0.05% U3O8 were used to constrain the grade 

interpolation. 
3. U3O8 values were interpolated by ordinary kriging. 
4. Wireframes were constructed with a minimum horizontal thickness of two metres. 
5. High U3O8 grades were cut to 7% 
6. Downhole radiometric logging was used for assays in one drill hole. 
7. Blocks are 10 m by 10 m by 3 m.   
8. Several blocks less than 0.05% U3O8 were included for continuity or to expand 

the lenses to the two metre minimum horizontal thickness.  
9. Gemcom Software International Inc. Resource Evaluation Edition Version GEMS 

6.11 was used. 
10. Totals may not sum correctly due to rounding. 
 

 

RESOURCE DATABASE AND VALIDATION 

Scott Wilson RPA received header, survey, assay, lithology and related data from 

Strateco in Microsoft Access format.  Data were amalgamated and parsed as required, 

converted to ASCII, and imported into Gemcom Software International Inc. (Gemcom) 

Resource Evaluation Version 6.11 for modeling.  The Matoush Gemcom database 

includes 157 drill holes.  Of these, 119 holes representing 33,385 m of drilling intersect 

or are located near the AM-15 Zone (Table 17-2).  A total of 44 holes intersect the 

mineralized wireframe models.  Composite values from these holes were used to estimate 

block grades.

The Gemcom database for drill holes in or near the AM-15 Zone, includes 2,766 

chemical assay U3O8 values, ranging in length from 0.1 m to 5 m, totalling 2,592 m of 

sampling.  An additional nine holes have 3,176 m of equivalent U3O8 (eU3O8) values, 

calculated from gamma-log data collected by DGI.  Only one of these drill holes with 

eU3O8 values, and no chemical assays, intersects the mineralized wireframes used for the 

mineral resource estimate and block grade interpolation.   

 

Most of the drill hole database was compiled by Tech2Mine Inc., of Val d'Or 

Quebec.  A description compilation work by Tech2Mine is summarized in Section 14, 

Data Verification. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA ran several validation queries and routines in Excel, Access, and 

Gemcom to identify data errors.  Several problems were identified and corrected.  Scott 

Wilson RPA also verified a significant number of data records with original logs.  No 

discrepancies were identified.  Drill hole AM-15, the discovery hole drilled by Uranerz, 

was excluded from the drill hole database due to poor location data plus the fact it was 

drilled at a low angle to the mineralized lens.   

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 17-4

In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, the Gemcom drill hole database is valid and is 

suitable to estimate the mineral resources of the Matoush project. 

 

CUT-OFF GRADE 

Development of the AM-15 Zone would require an underground mining method 

given its depth below surface and geometry.  Scott Wilson RPA assumes that part of the 

deposit would be amenable to long-hole methods while other parts would require narrow 

vein mining.  The following economic assumptions were used to calculate an economic 

breakeven grade:   

• U3O8 price: US$75/lb 

• Processing cost: US$20/t 

• Underground mining cost: US$55/t 

• General and Administrative cost: US$15/t 

• Power cost: US$10/t 

• U3O8  recovery: 90% 

 

Cut-off grade  = Operating cost/(Metal Price x Recovery) 

   = $100/t/($75/lb x 90%) 

   = 1.48 lb/t 

   = 0.067% U3O8 
 

Scott Wilson RPA used 75% of this cut-off grade to estimate a marginal cut-off grade 

of 0.05% U3O8, which also corresponds to a natural break in the grade distribution.   

 

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND 3D SOLIDS 

Scott Wilson RPA created 32 north-northwest-south-southeast oriented cross sections 

spaced 10 m apart and 17 level plans extending from the 480 m to the 650 m elevation.  

These sections and plans were used to make an on-screen interpretation of wireframe 

models.  A set of composite control intervals were identified for each drill hole using a 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 17-5

0.05% U3O8 cut-off and a two metre minimum horizontal thickness (Figures 17-1 and 17-

2).   

 

The 3D wireframe models were built using 3D wobbly polylines on each cross 

section.  Occasionally, lower grade intersections were included to facilitate continuity.  

At model extremities, polylines were extrapolated approximately 5 m to 15 m beyond the 

last drill hole section.  Polylines were joined together in 3D using tie lines and the 

continuity was checked using the longitudinal section and plan views.  One main lens and 

three smaller lenses were identified and constructed: 

 

1. The Main Lens (ML) is an elongated tabular lens with variable thickness, 

dipping steeply to the east and plunging 15º to the south.  It is roughly 235 m 

along strike, 50 m down-dip and it ranges in thickness between 2 and 15 m, 

with an average thickness of 7.5m.  The Main Lens is intersected by 26 drill 

holes, including the discovery hole (AM-15) drilled by Uranerz in 1980.   

 

2. The South Lens (SL) is a near vertically dipping tabular lens splayed from the 

Main Lens.  It is roughly 190 m along strike, 30 m down dip, and averages 

three to four metres in thickness.  The South Lens is interpreted to overlap the 

Main Lens.  This overlap creates doubly "tagged" assay composites which 

were used in the grade interpolation for both the Main and South lenses.   

 

3. The Upper Lens (UL) is a thin vertical lens located above the Main and South 

lenses in the FBS unit.  It is approximately 35 m by 40 m and two metres 

thick.  Several of the intersections in the Upper Lens were diluted with 

surrounding non-mineralized material in order to meet the two metre 

minimum thickness criteria.   

 

4. The North Lens (NL) is an elongated lens located in the ACF3 unit below the 

Main Lens.  Its dimensions are 150 m along strike, 20 m to 45 m down dip, 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com

and approximately three metres thick.  Several low grade intersections were 

included to facilitate continuity.   

 

Several margins of the mineral resources remain open.  Scott Wilson RPA 

recommends several drill holes including: the north end of the North Lens; the north end 

of the Main Lens; south of the South Lens; and also near hole 06-33 which includes a 

mineralized intersection that does not correlate with the current interpretation.

U3O8 STATISTICS 

Percent U3O8 values inside the wireframes were tagged with domain identifiers and 

exported to Excel for basic statistical analysis.  Results on a lens by lens basis are 

summarized in Table 17-3.  Notable observations include: 

• The Main Lens includes the most assays and highest average U3O8 grade.   

• The average grade of assays within the Upper Lens is significantly lower than 

the other lenses.  This is one reason for keeping it a separate zone. 

• Since the Main Lens overlaps with the South Lens there are several assays that 

are shared between the two lenses and therefore the sum of assays in the four 

lenses is greater than the total number of assays. 

 

At the request of Strateco, Scott Wilson RPA included vanadium in this analysis of 

assay statistics to determine if it could be considered part of the mineral resources.  The 

average vanadium assay value is on the order of 500 ppm, which is considered too low to 

be part of the mineral resource estimate and was therefore not considered beyond this 

tabulation.

CUTTING HIGH GRADE VALUES 

Where the assay distribution is skewed right or approaches log-normal, erratic high 

grade assay values can have a disproportionate affect on the average grade of a deposit.  

One method of treating these outliers in order to reduce their influence on the average 

grade is to cut or cap them at a specific grade level.  In the absence of production data to 

calibrate the cutting level, inspection of the assay distribution can be used to estimate a 

"first pass" cutting level.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA's interpretation of the frequency distributions of the resource 

assays suggests cutting high grade values to 7% U3O8 (Figure 17-3).  Inspecting high 

grade values on section and plan confirms that the high grade values are spatially erratic 

and therefore cutting to this level is appropriate.  Scott Wilson RPA recommends that the 

cutting level be reassessed as more data become available.   

 

Cutting high grade U3O8 values to 7% affects 12 assay values which represent 2% of 

the resource values and reduces the average grade of the resource assays from 1.037% 

U3O8 to 0.969% U3O8, a 7% decrease (Table 17-4).  This is an acceptable decrease in 

Scott Wilson RPA's opinion.  In the Main Lens, where most of the cut values are located, 

the standard deviation is reduced from 2.055 to 1.610 and the coefficient of variation 

from 1.747 to 1.484.

COMPOSITING 

Sample length intervals range from 10 cm to three metres, and average less than one 

metre (Table 17-3).  Assays within the wireframe lens models were composited to one 

metre length starting at the first mineralized wireframe boundary from the collar and

 17-12

resetting at each new lens wireframe boundary.  Several shorter composites occur at the 

bottom of the mineralized zone, immediately above where the drill hole exits the 

wireframe.  Partial composites less than 30 cm long were removed from the dataset.  

Non-assayed intervals were treated as zero grade.

Table 17-5 summarizes statistics of the uncut and cut U3O8 composite values.  The 

decrease in average composite grade, when compared to raw assay grades, is mainly due 

to a sample length bias whereby the geologist logging the core selects shorter sample 

lengths for the higher grade intercepts, based on scintillometer response.   

 

DENSITY 

Scott Wilson RPA received 28 bulk density measurements made by Geoanalytical 

Laboratories of the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), Saskatoon.  A summary of 

results is listed in Table 17-6.  SRC used a standard water immersion method to calculate 

bulk density using the weight of the sample in air and water.  Samples were coated in an 

impermeable material prior to weighing in water and the temperature of the water was 

recorded at the time of each measurement.  All weights and temperatures were entered 

into a database and the bulk density was calculated for the sample. 

 

Based on our analysis of the results, Scott Wilson RPA used a global bulk density of 

2.65 t/m3 to convert volume to tonnage.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that the on-going bulk density measurement program 

recently implemented by Strateco be used to collect a sufficient number of samples with 

an appropriate spatial distribution to allow for a more sophisticated bulk density model 

that may permit a variable tonnage factor by mineralization type and/or lens.

VARIOGRAPHY AND KRIGING PARAMETERS 

Scott Wilson RPA used Sage 2001 software to prepare and interpret a series of 

variograms from U3O8 composite values located within the mineralized wireframes 

(Figures 24-1 to 24-3 in Appendix 3).  Composites with grades greater than 3% U3O8 

were excluded from the analysis.  The downhole variogram is well developed and 

indicates a nugget effect of 15%.  Long range variograms show the longest range in the 

direction of plunge.  Single structure spherical models were used with a 15% nugget 

effect to model the experimental variograms.   

 

A two-pass grade estimate by kriging was restricted by the grade-shell wireframe.  

The second pass used relaxed sample criteria and a larger search ellipse (Table 17-7).  

This two pass approached helped guide the classification of the mineral resources by 

tentatively tagging the blocks interpolated during the first pass as indicated.

BLOCK MODEL AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The rotated (-13º) Gemcom block model is made up of 44 columns, 59 rows, and 20 

levels for a total of 51,920 blocks.  The model origin is at UTM coordinates 699,112 mE 

5,760,403 mN and 653 m elevation.  Each block is 10 m by 10 m by 3 m in size and 

contains the following information: 

• Estimated cut and uncut U3O8 grades related to mineralized blocks inside the 

mineralization wireframes (Figures 17-4 to 17-9). 

• The percentage volume of each block within the mineralization wireframes. 

• A global tonnage factor of 2.65 t/m3. 

• Mineral Resource classification identifiers for mineral resource blocks. 

• The distance to the closest composite used to interpolate the block grade. 

• The average distance to all composites used to interpolate the block grade. 

• The number of composites used to estimate the block grade.

CLASSIFICATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those 

defined by CIM (2000 and 2004) and adopted by NI 43-101.  In the CIM classification, a 

Mineral Resource is defined as "a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic 

or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of 

such grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction".  Mineral 

Resources are classified into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories.  A Mineral 

Reserve is defined as the "economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated 

Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study".  Mineral 

Reserves are classified into Proven and Probable categories.  Scott Wilson RPA classified 

the AM-15 Zone as Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources.  There are no Mineral 

Reserves reported at Matoush. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA used the results from the two pass grade interpolation (described 

above) to guide the classification of the mineral resources into indicated and inferred 

categories.  The drill hole spacing in the Main Lens ranges from 10 m to 30 m.  In the 

South Lens the spacing is in the order of 10 to 15 m.  Taking into consideration the 

thickness of the lenses, continuity and variogram ranges, Scott Wilson RPA classified 

most of the Main and South lenses as indicated mineral resources.  Figure 17-8 shows the 

solid (grey) used to tag indicated blocks (green) in the Main Lens.  A similar process was 

applied to the South Lens.  The Upper and North lenses were both classified as inferred 

given the wider spaced drilling and/or uncertainties with respect to the continuity of 

mineralization. 

 

Although there are some areas of closely spaced drilling in the Main and South 

lenses, no blocks have been classified as measured mainly because grade continuity has 

not been established to the confidence level required for the measured category in Scott 

Wilson RPA's opinion. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 17-22

Scott Wilson RPA recommends several holes be drilled in and or near parts of the 

mineralized lenses that have been classified as inferred mineral resources.

MINERAL RESOURCE REPORTING 

Table 17-8 provides a breakdown of mineral resources at the AM-15 Zone, estimated 

by Scott Wilson RPA.  Notable observations include: 

 

• More than 80% of the tonnage and grade are classified as indicated. 

• More than 85% of the contained metal is classified as indicated. 

• Approximately 75% of the resources are located in the indicated portion of the 

Main Lens. 

• The average grade of the block model is consistent with the average grade of 

the composite values. 

• The differences between the uncut and cut average grades appear acceptable.

9. Totals may not sum correctly due to rounding. 
10. Several blocks less than 0.05% U3O8 were included for continuity or to expand the 

lenses to a two metre minimum horizontal thickness. 
 

MINERAL RESOURCE VALIDATION 

Scott Wilson RPA validated the block model based on visual inspection, volumetric 

comparison, and a comparison of results using inverse distance-squared grade 

interpolation.   

 

Visual comparison on vertical section and plan views found good overall correlation 

between block grades and composite grades.  Scott Wilson RPA notes that its grade 

interpolation profiles should be reviewed and revised as new data become available.   

 

The estimated total volume of the wireframe models is 101,200 m3, while the volume 

of the block model at a 0.05% U3O8 cut-off is 100,300 m3.  The small difference in 

volume is due to Gemcom's needling method that estimates the percentage of 

mineralization within each block.  Results are listed on a lens by lens basis in Table 17-9.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA estimated the average grade of the indicated mineral resources 

using inverse distance squared to be 0.83% U3O8.  This compares to the average grade of 

0.79% U3O8 as estimated by kriging.  This difference is within acceptable limits and may 

be due to the declustering effect of the kriging method.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

The properties are located in the James Bay territory and are therefore covered by the 

James Bay Agreement between the Cree nations and the Quebec Government, and more 

recently by the "Paix des Braves" agreement.  The area is classified as Category III land, 

meaning that there is no restriction with regard to aboriginal peoples in relation to 

exploitation of natural resources.   

 

The area lies within the Assinica Wildlife Reserve and Lakes Albanel, Mistassini and 

Waconichi Wildlife Reserve.  The area is not restricted for mineral resources exploration 

or exploitation.  No access rights are required.  However, the area is subject to some 

restrictions on some sporting activities, including hunting and fishing.  Limits of the 

planned Lac Albanel and Rivière Témiscami Provincial Park lie 16 km east of the 

properties, while limits of the planned Otish-Témiscami-Albanel Provincial Park are 12 

km to the south of the property, too far to be impacted by exploration activities.  

However, certain constraints could arise in the case of a future operation (Girard, 2006). 

 

No additional information or explanation is necessary to make this Technical Report 

understandable and not misleading.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The AM-15 Zone of uranium mineralization is localized largely at the intersection of 

the gabbro dike-hosting Matoush Fault Zone (MFZ) with the ACF 3 unit.  An inference 

to be drawn is that the conjunction of the dike-hosting structure and a probable 

peleoaquifer provided a location for the mixing of two different fluids (one presumably 

reducing and basement derived, the other presumably oxidizing and basin derived) 

resulting in the distinctive alteration of the host rocks and the deposition, over time, of 

uranium mineralization.  If Rhys (2007) is correct, the AM-15 Zone occurs on a dilational 

bend of the MFZ which probably implies a localized opportunity for enhanced fluid flow.  

The MFZ shows AM-15-type wall rock alteration at other locations along its length but 

without uranium mineralization, indicating fluid flow at least.  Obviously special 

circumstances are required for uranium mineralization to be deposited.   

 

As currently defined, the AM-15 Zone is dominantly a stratabound, north-trending 

body of uranium mineralization hosted mainly within the ACF 3 unit.  The mineralization 

does have a shallow overall plunge of 15º to the south such that there is some 

mineralization in the underlying CBF 4 sandstones and in the overlying CBF 3 

sandstones, at the south and north ends respectively.  The indicated and inferred mineral 

resources as estimated by Scott Wilson RPA for the AM-15 Zone occur within four 

roughly vertically oriented lenses that form an overall strike length of 300 m and through 

a vertical distance of 50 m to 100 m, at a depth ranging from 175 m to 275 m below 

surface.  These lenses have been assigned the names: Main Lens, South Lens, Upper 

Lens, and North Lens.  The Main Lens is the largest of the four identified at the AM-15 

Zone with dimensions of approximately 235 m along strike, 50 m down-dip and 

thicknesses ranging between two metres and 15 m and averaging about 7.5 m.  In cross 

section, the Main Lens varies from roughly ovoid to tabular.   

 

Indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79% U3O8 
containing 3.48 million pounds U3O8 at a cut off grade of 0.05% U3O8.  Inferred mineral

 19-2

resources are estimated to total 65,000 tonnes grading 0.43% U3O8 containing 0.62 

million pounds U3O8.  There are no mineral reserves estimated at Matoush.   

 

In the Otish Basin, the association of significant uranium mineralization with fault-

hosted mafic dikes is empiric (AM-15 Zone, L Zone).  The AM-15 Zone occurs in an 

overall Athabasca-type structural, stratigraphic and geotectonic setting but is in itself, not 

an unconformity-type deposit.  Nor is it apparently a perched zone.  It might simply be 

described as an Otish-type uranium deposit, a newly recognized deposit type in this area.   

 

The Aeroquest airborne survey, although requiring more detailed interpretation, has 

given good magnetic, EM and radiometric responses which have outlined a host of fault 

structures, and at least six areas with anomalous radioactive boulders which are being 

followed-up.  Target areas are being prioritized for future work which ultimately means 

drill testing.  With respect to the MFZ, the brittle fault strands coincide with the location 

of alteration along the fault, and even in areas distal to known mineralized zones, chlorite 

and roscoelite-fuchsite alteration is sporadically developed in the surrounding sandstone 

to the fault, suggesting that following the fault is a valid exploration method (Rhys, 

2007). 

 

There is surely excellent potential for other uranium deposits on the Matoush 

properties.  There are at least two interpreted fault structures parallel to the MFZ, one on 

either side, and any number of interpreted fault features in the aeromagnetic and EM data 

derived from the Aeroquest survey.  Targets to follow-up with drilling should be any 

basement-rooted fault (however determined).  Flexures in such features would be targets 

as would the intersection with other faults.  Any direction of faulting should be 

considered a potential target until the target model can be refined more.  The working 

premise should initially be that a target mineralized zone would be at the intersection of a 

reactivated, basement-rooted fault with a paleoaquifer in the Indicator Formation which 

would include ACF 1, ACF 2, ACF 3, ACF 4, and also the basement unconformity.

Future drilling on the Matoush Project should concentrate on stepping out, away from 

the AM-15 Zone, concentrating along the extent of the MFZ as well as investigating any 

other interpreted basement rooted fault zones.  The objective should be the location of 

other mineralized centres with potential to host substantial tonnages of uranium 

mineralization.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Strateco's AM-15 Zone is a very significant 

uranium deposit which indicates considerable exploration potential for the Matoush 

Project area.  The work program recommended is amply warranted.   

 

At the beginning of the Strateco exploration program at Matoush in 2006, the 

objective was to define and expand the AM-15 Zone.  That objective has been more than 

accomplished.  In the process, the nature and controls on the mineralization have been 

demonstrated, which in turn implies significant exploration potential for the balance of 

the Matoush properties.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Strateco's Matoush properties in the Otish 

Basin already contain a very significant uranium resource in the AM-15 Zone and that 

there is excellent potential to find other zones.  Considerably more uranium exploration 

work is warranted and a substantial work program is recommended.  It must be noted that 

a large part of any exploration program on these properties will involve diamond drilling.  

A recommended Phase 1 program to run from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 

2008 includes extensive diamond drilling of targets already defined, review of current 

airborne and ground geophysical data and ground follow-up of anomalously radioactive 

boulder trains.  Compilation of geological and geophysical data plus geochemical data 

collected during the current drilling will doubtlessly lead to the definition of more drill 

targets associated with the fault structures as defined.   

 

Strateco have initiated a QA/QC program supervised by dedicated, on site personnel. 

When fully implemented, in addition to quarter split duplicates, Scott Wilson RPA 

recommends that sample batches include some combination of blanks, Certified 

Reference Materials, reject duplicates and pulp duplicates. The intent is to identify any 

Quality Control failures which would in turn trigger re-analysis of sample batches 

 

The mineral resource estimate at AM-15 Zone could by refined by adjusting the 

tonnage factor by mineralization type and/or lens.  Strateco should continue to collect 

bulk density measurements until a sufficient amount of data with an appropriate spatial 

distribution permits a refinement to the mineral resource estimate at AM-15 Zone.   

 

Given the size of the Matoush properties, a Phase 2 program can be foreseen to also 

include significant diamond drilling of untested existing targets plus targets developed 

over time as a synthesis of existing and newly acquired data pinpoints new target areas 

with potential for uranium mineralization.  Advancing to Phase 2 work will in part be 

contingent on positive results from Phase 1 work.  Nonetheless it is felt that at the end of 

Phase 1 there will still be a number of untested top priority drill targets, not to mention

25 APPENDIX 2 
ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 

SASKATCHEWAN RESEARCH COUNCIL – REGULAR ICP PACKAGE 
METHOD SUMMARY FOR PROCEDURES ICP4-3 AND ICP4-3R 

1. Report Scope 
This method summary report was requested by Strateco Resources. The following report 
contains a description of Processing Methods performed on all samples received for 
Strateco Resources as well as the quality control procedures employed to verify the 
results produced; including the interpretation of control data results and charts for 
standards used during the procedures. 

 
2. Laboratory Background 

The Geoanalytical Laboratories at the Saskatchewan Research Council are 
unique facilities offering high quality analytical services to the exploration 
industry.  
The facilities consist of modern equipment maintained and engineered towards 
the needs of our customers.  
The laboratory has a Quality Assurance program dedicated to actively seeking to 
evaluate and continually improve the internal quality management system. These 
measures include: 

• Standards Council of Canada Accredited ISO/IEC 17025 Laboratory for 
Mineral Analysis Testing 

• Participating in a CANMET base metal and precious metal proficiency 
testing program. 

• Routine Quality control practices 
• Computerized sample management 
• Dedicated, experienced key personnel who are available to answer any 

questions raised by our customers 
• Continual review and improvement of all operations at the facility  

 
3. Quality Control  

All Quality Control data generated at SRC Geoanalytical Laboratory is reviewed by the 
Quality Assurance Specialist. The Quality Control Techniques used for verifying all 
results generated include:   

 
• Data verification: 

At least 2 levels of data verification performed prior to reporting results.  
 

• Instrument Calibration: 
All instrumentation is maintained and calibrated prior to sample analysis. 
This is to ensure the stability of the instrument during analysis. 
 

• Analysis of Blanks: 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 25-2

A digested blank sample is analysed by the same procedure as normal 
samples along with the sample group to ensure that there is no 
contamination from the sample preparation. 
 
 

• Analysis of duplicates:  
One sample preparation and analysis is duplicated with each group of 
samples to ensure that the repeatability of the results generated. All 
duplicate analysis must be within specified limits. 
 
Duplicate Error Determination 

 Percentage errors were determined by taking the difference between the two 
results and dividing it by average. 
 
Acceptance Criteria for duplicates 
All duplicates must be within the appropriate range of each other (within 
10%). Any duplicate ranges greater than this are reported to the 
customer. 
 

• Analysis of reference (QC) samples: 
Various QC samples are analysed with each group of samples and are 
used to monitor analytical performance. The results of QA analysis is 
charted using control charts/compare program on LIMS. 
 

• Control Charts: 
Quality Control charts are produced for each QC standard for all elements 
analyzed. Upper and lower limits are set at 3 standard deviations. 
Appropriate corrective action is initiated and the effectiveness of that action is 
evaluated internally before reporting the final results to the customer. 
The corrective action taken that may follow a deviation could involve one 
or more of the following: 
1) Reanalyze 
2) Re-digest and reanalyze 
3) Reprocess original data 

 
• Interpretation: Control Charts 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

  
 

The mean value is represented by the dashed line; the 3 standard 
deviation line is represented by the black lines (both upper and lower 
limits). Analytical results for each standard are represented by the black

(♦) points. The concentrations are displayed along the vertical axis and 
the number of analyses displayed along the horizontal axis 

 
 

• Monitoring of control Charts: 
Control Charts are monitored by QA on a regular basis. Any deviations or 
bias observed for a QC in the method shall be documented and reported 
to the customer. 

 
4. Sample Receipt and Preparation 

All samples are received and entered into the Laboratory Information 
Management System (LIMS).  All analytical data which is generated during the 
analysis of samples is the property of the customer and shall be controlled by QA 
measures at the laboratory. 
Depending on the sample type (non-mineralized, mineralized, etc.) each 
preparation step was performed in designated sample preparation areas. Rock 
samples were dried in the original plastic bags @80C overnight, then jaw 
crushed to 60% -2mm and 100-200g sub sample split out using a riffler. The sub 
sample was pulverized to 90% - 106 microns using a grinding mill (puck and ring 
or agate, depending on sample). The grinding mills were, at minimum, cleaned 
between samples, silica sand cleaning was employed in between groups. The 
pulp was transferred to a labeled plastic snap top vial. 
 

5. Sample Analysis/Testing Overview 
The samples are tested using validated documented procedures by trained 
personnel. All samples are digested prior to analysis by ICP. Two separate 
digestions were preformed: Partial and Total.  

 
6. Sample Preparation: Digestions 

 
Total: 
Total Digestions were performed on an aliquot of sample for the analysis of the 
requested elements by ICP. 
A 0.25g  aliquot of pulp was digested to dryness in a Teflon beaker using a hotplate in 
a mixture of concentrated HF:HNO3:HClO4. The residue was dissolved in 15 ml of 
dilute HN03. 
 
Partial: 
Partial Digestions were performed on an aliquot of sample for the analysis of the 
requested elements by ICP. 
A 2g  aliquot of pulp was digested in a digestion tube in a mixture of HNO3:HCl, 
in a hot water bath for approximately 1 hour, then diluted to 15ml using deionized 
water. 

 
7. Geochemical Analysis 

QC measures and data verification procedures applied 
 
ICP-OES: Mutli element on partial and total digestion: 
Two separate analyses were done for the partial and total digestions. Instruments 
were calibrated using certified commercial solutions. The instruments used were 
PerkinElmer Optima 300DV, Optima 4300DV or Optima 5300DV.

METHOD  9-6-2   Determination of As, Sb, Th, U, Ba, Sn and Ta 
by XRF using Internal Standard Addition  

 
9.  Parameter(s) measured, unit(s): 

arsenic, antimony, thorium, uranium, barium,  tin, tantalum; (%) 
 
10. Typical sample size:   

6 g 
 

11. Type of sample applicable (media): 
Rocks, soils, ores and concentrates 

 
12. Sample preparation technique used:   

This method is used as an alternative to fusion for analytical contexts where the 

analyte is volatile or if levels of detection below that attainable by fusion are required. 

The internal standard preparation technique forms a powder pellet specimen 

consisting of sample thoroughly mixed with a known amount of a reference 

compound and a binding agent.  The compound is chosen to provide reference 

intensity as close to the analyte line wavelength as possible while avoiding 

interposing major element lines or absorption edges.  Within an emission line series, 

this is usually the adjacent element in terms of atomic number. 

 
13. Method of analysis used: 

Xray fluorescence spectrometry 
 
14. Data reduction by:  

The results are exported via computer, on line, data fed to the Laboratory Information 
Management System with secure audit trail.
