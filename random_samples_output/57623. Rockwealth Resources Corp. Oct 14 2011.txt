This is an Independent Technical Report for the update of the Mineral Resources Estimates and the related 
Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Taysan Copper-Gold Porphyry Project (the "Taysan Project") 
which was first reported in the NI43-101 Report "Mineral Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, Taysan Project" dated 11 March 2011 ("11 March 2011 NI43-101 Report").  

The Taysan Project is comprised of two mining exploration permits and three mining exploration permit 
applications (permits: EP-IVA- 005 and EP-IVA-016, and permit applications: EPA-IVA-108, EPA-IVA-111 
and EPA-IVA-081) over five partly contiguous claim blocks covering a combined total area of 11,254 
hectares. The Taysan copper-gold porphyry deposit is located on the core granted exploration permit (EP-
IVAâ€“005) which covers an area of approximately 4,086 hectares. 

CHR commissioned this report to comply with Canada's National Instrument 43-101 Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI43-101"). At the request of Mr. Brian Lueck, Chairman of CHR, Mining 
Associates Pty Ltd ("MA") was contracted in April 2011 to undertake a mineral resource estimate update 
based on the on-going exploration and validation and new drilling at Taysan. This resource estimate update 
is part of a Prefeasibility Study currently in progress at Taysan. 

The Taysan Project hosts a large and only partly explored copper-gold porphyry deposit similar to other 
copper-gold porphyry deposits previously mined in the Philippines. The Project is located in southern Luzon, 
Philippines in the well-developed mining province of Batangas and readily accessible by road located 20km 
east of the provincial capital and deep-water commercial port of Batangas City.  

Geology and Mineralization 
The project area contains two known deposits; the major Taysan Copper-Gold Deposit which is a porphyry 
style deposit; one of a number of porphyry deposits which have developed along the spine of the Philippine 
island system and the smaller Antipolo Epithermal Gold Prospect. The Taysan copper gold mineralization is 
hosted in potassically altered hornblende diorite and hornblende quartz diorite porphyries. The 
mineralization occurs as disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite in the altered porphyry and as stockwork 
hosted mineralization within quartz veins and breccias. The deposit outcrops as a small hill with the majority 
of the mineralization covered by 10 to 55 metres of recent volcanic ash. The deposit occurs in gently 
undulating topography in what is largely cleared farmland and is of a geometry that is readily amenable to 
conventional open cut mining methods. 

Past Work 
The historical work and previous resource estimates are described in the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 Report.  
Exploration 
CHR undertook a ten drill hole programme (5,812.7m) between October and December 2010, to confirm the 
tenor of the historic drilling. The description of this program and the results are included in the 11 March 
2011 NI43-101 Report. Subsequent to this work, CHR continued exploration and validation drilling at 
Taysan, completing an additional 35 holes. The results for which are the subject of this report. 

The slight assay bias noted from the preliminary analysis by MA of the copper and gold certified reference 
material ("standards") in use since the commencement of the 2010 drilling program was addressed.  The 
gold standards were reported without bias and this level of quality control has continued with the 
subsequent drilling and sampling.  

The CHR drilling program conducted during 2010-2011 at the Taysan Copper Deposit has confirmed that a 
significant copper deposit exists within the Taysan Project.  The results of the initial 10 diamond drill 
programme have confirmed the tenor of the historically defined copper mineralisation to be correct; the 
drilling has also proved the deposit is open to depth. The results of the subsequent 35 hole diamond drill 
holes have confirmed these previous results and has led to the definition of a significant zone of copper-gold 
mineralisation which remains open down dip and along strike to the south.

Mineral Resource Estimate Update 
MA only used historical data for the 11 March 2011 resource estimate which outlined the following Inferred 
Resources:

The results of the 45 drill hole programme conducted from October 2010 to June 2011 have confirmed the 
tenor of the historically defined copper mineralisation to be correct. The drilling has also confirmed that 
copper grades decrease at depth and that the deposit remains open down dip. The recent drilling has 
bolstered confidence in the Taysan Project enabling an indicated and inferred copper resource to be 
estimated.   

MA created the copper mineral resource estimate from first principals using all historic and recent CHR drill 
data.  The gold resource is based on all recent CHR drilling, Chase and Kumakata historic data. The silver 
resource is based on recent CHR drill data and Kumakata drill data, only recent CHR drilling has magnetite 
data.   

The approach to the resource model consisted analysis of all drill data, wireframing in section; confirmation 
and review in flitch slices; grouping the wireframes into sub-domains of similar orientation and grade ranges; 
tagging and statistical analysis of the drill intercepts by domain; variography; analysing associated metals 
within the copper domains; estimation using Ordinary Kriging of copper, gold, silver and magnetite into a 
block model; analysis and validation guided by geology and alteration, informing data, statistical measures 
and check reporting.   

MA created the mineral resource estimate from first principals. The approach to the resource model 
consisted of wireframing the lenses in section; confirmation and review in flitch slices; grouping the 
wireframes into domains of similar orientation and grade ranges; tagging and statistical analysis of the drill 
intercepts by domain; variography; copper-gold regression; estimation using Ordinary Kriging of copper and 
gold into a block model; analysis and validation guided by geology, informing data, statistical measures, and 
check reporting. 

MA's updated mineral resource estimate defines an indicated resource of 411 Mt at an average grade of 
0.27% copper, 0.10 g/t gold, 0.92 g/t silver and 3.3% magnetite for 2,410 Mlb of contained copper, 1.27 Moz 
contained gold, 12.19 Moz contained silver and 13.4 Mt of contained magnetite and an additional inferred 
resource of 542 Mt at an average grade of 0.18% copper, 0.07 g/t gold, 0.47g/t silver and 2.8% magnetite 
for 2,190 M lbs of contained copper, 1.24 Moz contained gold, 8.24 Moz contained silver and 15.4 Mt 
contained magnetite.  Associated minerals have been estimated within the copper resource based on 
reduced available data, previous tenement holders did not routinely determine gold, silver or magnetite 
grades.  A cut-off grade of 0.1% copper was applied to for all reported resource blocks.

Within the defined copper resource are several associated accessory metals, gold, silver and magnetite. 
They were not routinely determined in the historic data.  The gold estimate is an improvement on previous 
regression based estimates; and silver and magnetite have not been estimated previously. All elements are 
estimated using ordinary kriging. The company is currently drilling the copper, gold, silver and magnetite 
resource to obtain sufficient data to improve confidence in the resource. 

It is the intention of Asian Arc to continue drilling at Taysan with the view to increasing the confidence in the 
resource estimate and allowing reserves to be estimated within the ten year pit shell as defined in the

Preliminary Economic Assessment (described in the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 Report), leading into a Pre-
Feasibility and Definitive Feasibility Study of the Taysan Copper Deposit. 

Notes to accompany the Taysan Inferred Category Mineral Resource Estimate:  

x The tenement holder is Asian Arc Mining Resources Incorporated ("Asian Arc").  Crazy Horse 
Resources Inc (CHR) currently owns 100% of Asian Arc.  

x Resource estimate is based on historical drillholes and Asian Arc holes to June 30th 2011 consisting 
of 193 historical holes (152 core and 41 percussion) and 45 Asian Arc (core) holes totalling 64,188 
metres (59,736 core metres and 4,452 percussion metres).  The 1983 TCI holes were rejected 
outright (2 holes totalling 328 metres) 

x MA did not conduct any audit of the data or sample collection of the historic drilling. Asian Arc drilled 
six twin holes and located 39 historic drill holes in the field. The findings validate the historic drill 
hole database. 

x MA has reviewed the Asian Arc procedures and visited site twice during the course of the Asian Arc 
drill programme. 

x There is no available QA/QC information (sample duplicates, blanks, drill core or certified reference 
materials) for the historical drilling data.  Drilling completed by Asian Arc undergoes internal QA/QC, 
including the submission of certified reference material, duplicates and blanks. The average grade 
for drilling completed by Asian Arc supports the average grade for the historical drilling data within 
the mineralised copper domains. 

x All copper drilling data with the exception of two TCI holes were used in the estimation of the copper 
resource (1983 TY-007 and TY-008). 

x Only Chase, Kumakata and Asian Arc gold assays were used for the estimation of the gold 
resource. 

x Only Kumakata and Asian Arc silver assays were used for the estimate of the silver resource.  
Kumakata and Asian Arc where the only drill programmes tested for silver. 

x Asian Arc recorded magnetic susceptibility readings of pulverised two metre samples for holes 
CZT001 to CZT042. Magnetite regression was determined from 107 Davis Tube Test samples. 

x Composite lengths and high grade cuts based on spatial distribution and probability plots were 
applied as follows, 

o Copper assay data was composited to 8 metres down hole within geological domains; 
giving 4,750 informing samples from 165 drillholes; a copper grade cap was applied 
informing composites 99th percentile in high copper domains and 97.5th percentile in the 
lower grade domains. 

o Gold assays were composited to four metres down hole within copper domains and were 
capped at the 99.5th percentile 

o Silver assays were composited to four metres down hole within copper domains and were 
capped at 99th percentile or the 98.5th percentile. 

o Magnetite content correlates to the magnetic susceptibility of the pulps, (R2=0.9733). 
Magnetite% = 0.1639 x MagSus reading + 0.8007 based on 107 Davis Tube Tests.  The 
regression was applied to all magnetite susceptibility readings (8239 readings of one kg 
pulp bags representing 2 metre samples). Magnetite % results were composited to four 
metres down hole within in copper domains and capped to 97.5th percentile. 

x Block model block sizes selection of XYZ 60 x 60 x 20m is based on Â½ to 1 times the drill hole 
spacing. Sub-blocking to 15 x15 x 5m for model volumes. Screened for overlying tuff and 
topography by sub-block. 

x Geological resource is constrained by sub-block with 18 wireframes in two grade domains based on 
lithology, structure, alteration, and a minimum sample grade of 0.1% Cu and 0.3% Cu, includes 
minor internal dilution. Each sub-block can only belong to one domain. 

x Routine bulk density measurements show some variation with an average bulk density across all 
oxidation states of 2.53. The fresh material has a bulk density of 2.6 applied; partially weathered 
material was assigned a bulk density of 2.5.  Oxide has an applied bulk density of 2.4, and the 
overlying tuff a bulk density 1.4.

x Grade was interpolated into a constrained block model by domain using ordinary krige techniques. 
Kriging parameters are derived from a study of variography by domain.  The block model was 
validated by statistical and visual comparison of data and estimated grades and by alternate 
estimation methods  

x Resources have been classified as Indicated and Inferred.  Resource classification is based on 
confidence in grade continuity and geological models of the primary commodity (Cu).  The indicated 
resource has been drilled on 120 x 120 drill sections with significant infill drilling on section to 60m 
centres, minor infill drilling on intermediate sections.  The inferred resource is drilled on 120 x 120 m 
pattern. 

x Lower cut off grade of 0.1% copper was applied to blocks in reporting the resource estimates. 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
One of the recommendations of the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 report was to test for the potential to produce 
magnetite concentrate due to the apparent high magnetite content of the mineralization. The report 
recommended Davis Tube testing (DTR) of drill core samples to determine the resources and grade 
variations and calibration of the magnetic susceptibility of drill core with the DTR results to minimise the 
DTR testing over the resource. These recommendations were conducted with DTR performed on 107 pulp 
samples from 12 drill holes.  Testing was preliminary in nature and focused upon determination of the total 
recoverable level of magnetite and the impact of magnetic intensity variation from 600 to 3,000 gauss on 
composite samples. 

The Davis Tube recovery tests indicated the magnetite recoveries of up to 65% at relatively concentrate 
grades of approximately 90% magnetite could be achieved with some of the alteration types. Each showed 
the typical trend of increasing magnetite recovery and decreasing concentrate magnetite grade with 
increasing magnetic intensity. The concentrates also exhibited the potential for further upgrading which is 
being evaluated in the current test work program. Analysis of the test work data indicated a LOM recovery of 
52% for magnetite could be expected. The test work also exhibited some anomalous results with a lower 
quality concentrate largely independent of magnetic intensity. The anomalies and the potential for magnetite 
concentrate grade and recovery improvement are being evaluated in ongoing testing programs. 

Preliminary Economic Assessment 
CHR commissioned an independent scoping study of an open pit mining operation at Taysan. The study 
was managed by AMEC Minproc Limited of Australia with technical contributions by a number of third party 
industry consultants. The resource model used in the mining study was the inferred resource estimate of 
March 2011 and was limited to Copper and Gold inferred resources. This updated PEA is based upon 
Mining Associates August, 2011 resource report described in this report and includes Indicated and inferred 
resources of Copper, Gold, Silver and Magnetite.  A Pre feasibility study is in progress under management 
by AMEC Minproc Limited of Australia and is scheduled to be completed by November, 2011. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The PEA is 
preliminary in nature, and is based partially on inferred mineral resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 
categorized as mineral reserves.  There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. 
 
The PEA, managed by AMEC Minproc Limited of Australia, indicates that the Taysan Project has a Net 
Present Value ("NPV") at a 10% discount rate of US$639M for the base case of US$3/lb Cu, US$1,000/oz 
Au, $26/oz Ag and $100/tonne of Magnetite. The internal rate of return ("IRR") is 21.9% for this base case.  
These numbers reflect a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) case and provide for a Philippines 
Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) certification of the processing plant.

In addition to silver and magnetite, the PEA was updated with current numbers for diesel fuel (US$1.00/l 
versus US$0.81/l in March, 2011) and grid power of US$0.128/kWh during the first four years of operations 
whilst the coal power plant is constructed (US$180M versus US$132M in March, 2011) in order to achieve 
project start up as scheduled. Power after year 4 remains at Scoping Study estimate of US$0.06/kWh. 

The Taysan Project is estimated to produce 3,212 Mlb Cu, 1.02 M oz Au, 4.23M oz Ag and 11.84 Mt of 
Magnetite over the twenty-five (25) year mine life, net of smelter recoveries and deductions.  Annual 
average production for years 1-4 is estimated at 175 Mlb Cu, 58,300 oz Au, 436,000 oz Ag and 0.53 Mt of 
Magnetite.  

A capital cost estimate of US$864M is lower than originally estimated (US$1,006M) due to the deferment of 
the power plant and refinement of the mining schedule.  

The C1 (cash) cost, including lower risk grid power, net of by-product credits is low at US$0.97/lb Cu for 
years 1-4 and US$1.38/lb Cu over the 25 year mine life.  Unit cost is estimated at US$8.77/t of ore 
processed and is driven by the low waste to ore ratio (0.8:1); proximity to port (20km); and low freight costs 
to expected market (China, Japan and Korea). 

Discussion and Conclusions 
An initial mineral resource estimate based on historical drilling was reported in the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 
report. The October 2011 NI43-101 (this report) is an update to the March 2011 minerals resource estimate 
and is based on the results of a 45 diamond drill hole programme conducted from October 2010 to June 
2011. 

Asian Arc work to date has defined a significant porphyry copper deposit within the Taysan Project.  The 
drilling has confirmed that copper grades decrease at depth and that the deposit remains open down dip. 
The 2011 drilling has bolstered confidence in the Taysan Project enabling an indicated and inferred copper 
resource to be estimated. The results have also provided data enabling a silver and magnetite inferred 
mineral resources to be added to the project.  

Low grade gold mineralisation at Taysan is broadly associated with copper mineralisation.  The CHR drilling 
indicates two distinct gold mineralising events; the initial syngenetic mineralisation associated with the 
porphyry copper mineralisation and subsequent epigenetic gold mineralisation associated with the quartz-
magnetite alteration.  Within the quartz-magnetite alteration evidence of retrograde alteration (chlorite / 
kaolinite) is often associated with elevated gold grades.  The March 2011 gold resource figures relied on 
limited gold assay data and a copper-gold regression to support block estimates, however the current 
estimate is based solely on gold assays providing a more robust estimate.  Silver mineralisation also 
correlates to gold mineralisation spatially.

Recommendations 
MA proposes the follow recommendations: 

x Future drilling should target confidence in the gold silver and magnetite resources, particularly 
inferred resources within the pit shell as defined by the PEA. 

x Drilling should target gold silver and magnetite infill drilling to obtain sufficient gold, silver and 
magnetite data to achieve more robust resource estimates; 

x Future drilling programs should employ rigorous QA/QC procedures to provide a dataset suitable for 
estimation and reporting of NI43-101 compliant resource. 

x Due to the fine nature of the low cut-off boundary, non-linear techniques such as Uniform 
Conditioning or Conditional Simulation that allow for mining selectivity and recovery should be 
considered. 

It is the intention of CHR to continue drilling at Taysan with the view to increase confidence in the resource 
allowing reserves to be calculated with the 10 year pit shell as defined in the current Prefeasibility Study 
permitting the commencement of a Feasibility Study of the Taysan Copper Deposit. 

AMEC Minproc and the project consultants proposed a number of recommendations for the Prefeasibility 
Study in the March 2011 NI43-101 many of which still stand or are currently underway: 

x Additional geotechnical investigations comprising predominantly for the Open Pit drilling, laboratory 
testing of rock and downhole groundwater testing are required for the open pit; and drilling to test 
foundations within the waste and plant site areas is currently underway. Testing requirements are 
considered to be "normal" and largely to confirm the assumptions made to date.  No excessive or 
overly complicated investigations are envisaged. 

x Drill and Blast assumptions should be reviewed with an aim to better estimate the proportions of 
Tuff, Oxide and Fresh material requiring drilling and blasting. 

x There may be scope at Taysan to operate at an elevated cut-off grade which would reduce the total 
ore tonnes but improve the overall grade delivered to the mill.  A cut-off grade optimisation study 
should be included in the PFS. 

x Waste material characterisation is ongoing to define the acid generating potential and suitability for 
Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") embankment construction in order to properly plan the waste 
material movements to the TSF. 

x Load and Haul costs form a large proportion of the mine operating costs at Taysan.  A thorough 
review of available options to reduce the impact of this significant cost should be carried out.  Larger 
excavators, larger trucks and increased bench heights should improve the overall mine operating 
cost.  The practicality of electric shovels/excavators could also be reviewed to lower the mine Opex. 

x Little information was available during the scoping study covering groundwater and other inflows 
into the Taysan pit during the life of the project.  A more thorough understanding of the pit inflow 
quantities is being developed.

x Engineering contracting and construction strategy requires further definition. 
x A formal copper and magnetite concentrate market research study should be undertaken and a 

marketing approach selected.   
x Based on the DTR magnetite bench testing, it is recommended that additional magnetic separation 

testing be conducted to evaluate the effect of multi-stage separation and the influence of regrinding 
the magnetic rougher concentrate to improve grade.  Testing should also evaluate the effects of 
staged cleaning on the final product grade,

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Terms of Reference 
This report is an independent technical report on the update of the mineral resource estimates for the 
Taysan Project ("Taysan"). Taysan is located approximately 120 km south Manila in Batangas Province on 
Luzon Island, Philippines.  

At the request of Mr. Brian Lueck, Chairman of Crazy Horse Resources Inc ("CHR"), MA was commissioned 
in April 2011 to conduct an update of the mineral resource estimate based on-going exploration and 
validation and new drilling at Taysan; and to prepare the related Independent Technical Report for the 
Taysan Project to comply with Canada's National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects ("NI43-101"). The report also includes an update of the preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") 
which has been compiled by CHR and reviewed by AMEC Minproc Limited ("AMEC Minproc"). 

MA has not been requested to provide an Independent Valuation, nor has MA been asked to comment on 
the Fairness or Reasonableness of any vendor or promoter considerations, and therefore no opinion on 
these matters has been offered. 

2.2 Purpose 
CHR intends that this report be used as an Independent Technical Report for the update of the first time 
mineral resource estimates and updated preliminary economic assessment which satisfies NI43-101 
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

2.3 Information used 
This report is based on historical technical data and recent technical (drilling) data provided by CHR.  CHR 
provided open access to all available records, in the opinion of MA, to enable a proper assessment of the 
resource estimates. It also relies on information provided in 2 previous recent NI43-101 reports: 

x "Mineral Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment, Taysan Project, Batangas 
Province, Philippines" for Crazy Horse Resources Inc., dated 11 March 2011" and authored by 
Mining Associates Pty Ltd, ("11 March 2011 NI43-101 Report"). 

x 04 June 2010 NI43-101 Report entitled "A Technical Review of Exploration and Resource Estimates 
of the Taysan Project, Batangas Province, Philippines", dated 04 June 2010 and authored by 
Geosynthesis Pty Ltd, ("Geosynthesis NI43-101 Report") 

CHR has warranted in writing to MA that full disclosure has been made of all material information and that, 
to the best of CRH's knowledge and understanding, such information is complete, accurate and true. 
Readers of this report must appreciate that there is an inherent risk of error in the acquisition, processing 
and interpretation of geological data. 

The references at the end of this report lists the sources consulted.  

Six months have been spent on data collection and analysis, resource estimation and preparation of this 
report. Two site visits to the Taysan copper project area were conducted by Mr Ian Taylor for MA on 20 
October 2010 and again on 22 January 2011.  At the time of Mr Taylor's first visit, 2 core holes had been 
started.  Mr Taylor's second visit (22 January 2011) coincided with the completion of the initial 10 hole 
6,000m programme when the five drill rigs were commencing the drilling for this resource update. The 
drilling database was supplied during and after the site visit by electronic transfer.   

Geological information usually consists of a series of small points of data on a large blank canvas. The true 
nature of any body of mineralization is never known until the last tonne of ore has been mined out, by which 
time exploration has long since ceased. Exploration information relies on interpretation of a relatively small 
statistical sample of the deposit being studied; thus a variety of interpretations may be possible from the 
fragmentary data available. Investors should note that the statements and diagrams in this report are based

Page 16 of 142 

on the best information available at the time, but may not necessarily be absolutely correct. Such 
statements and diagrams are subject to change or refinement as new exploration makes new data 
available, or new research alters prevailing geological concepts. Appraisal of all the information mentioned 
above forms the basis for this report.  The views and conclusions expressed are solely those of MA. When 
conclusions and interpretations credited specifically to other parties are discussed within the report, then 
these are not necessarily the views of MA. 

The updated PEA portion of this report (Sections 16-22) has been prepared by AMEC Minproc based on 
assumptions as identified throughout the text and upon information and data supplied by others. 

AMEC Minproc has, in preparing the Report, followed methodology and procedures, and exercised due care 
consistent with the intended level of accuracy, using its professional judgment and reasonable care.  
However, no warranty should be implied as to the accuracy of estimates or other values and all estimates 
and other values are only valid as at the date of the Report and will vary thereafter.  

Parts of the Report have been prepared or arranged by Crazy Horse Resources Inc or third party 
contributors, as detailed in the document.  While the contents of those parts have been generally reviewed 
by AMEC Minproc for inclusion into the Report, they have not been fully audited or sought to be verified by 
AMEC Minproc.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
Please refer to, "A Technical Review of Exploration and Resource Estimates of the Taysan Project in 
Batangas Province, Philippines for Taysan Copper Corporation and Crazy Horse Resources Inc., June 
2010". 

The property description and location is detailed in Section 4 of the Geosynthesis NI43-101 Report. 
The Taysan Project is made up of 2 granted exploration permits ("EP") and 3 exploration permit applications 
("EPA") purchased by Taysan Copper Corporation ("TCC"). TCC signed Agreements with Kumakata Mining 
Company Inc, (KMCI") a subsidiary of Freeport McMoran Exploration Corporation, and Japan Oil, Gas and 
Metals National Corporation ("JOGMEC") on 15 April 2010 to purchase a 100% interest in Exploration 
Permits EP-IVA-005 which covers the Taysan Deposit.  The Agreements with KMCI and JOGMEC also 
include the purchase of 100% interest in the adjoining 4 Exploration Permit applications EPA-IVA-0081, 
EPA-IVA-086, EPA-IVA-108 and EPA-IVA-111 owned 100% by KMCI. Since the date of the agreement, 
EPA-IVA-086 has been granted as EP-IVA-016. Altogether the 5 tenement grouping is collectively known as 
the "Taysan Project" and cover 11,253.56 hectares. 

On November 12, 2010 CHR acquired a 100% interest in the Taysan Project through its wholly owned 
Philippine subsidiary, Asian Arc from TCC in exchange for issuing 20 million common shares of the 
Company pro-rata to the shareholders of Taysan Copper Corporation; paying US$1.7 million and granting a 
1.5-per-cent net smelter royalty. Additionally, the CHR issued 500,000 common shares as a finder's fee to 
an arm's-length third party. 

The Taysan Project is located the province of Batangas on the island of Luzon in the Republic of the 
Philippines, some 100km south of Manila and 20 km east of the provincial capital of Batangas City. The 
Taysan deposit lies within the municipality of Taysan (population 33,454) and the project tenement group 
straddles the municipalities of Taysan, Rosario, Ibaan, and Lobo.

The Taysan Project consists of comprised of two mining exploration permits and three mining exploration 
permit applications (permits: EP-IVA- 005 and EP-IVA-016, and permit applications: EPA-IVA-108, EPA-
IVA-111 and EPA-IVA-081) over five mainly contiguous claim blocks covering a combined total area of 
11,254 hectares. The Taysan copper-gold porphyry deposit is located on the core granted exploration 
permit (EP-IVAâ€“005) which covers an area of approximately 4,086, hectares located in the municipality of 
Taysan, province of Batangas. The adjacent Taysan Project tenements lie within the municipality of Taysan 
and into neighbouring the municipalities of Rosario and Lobo. The regional location of the Taysan Project 
tenements is shown in Figure 1 and the tenement group in Figure 2.

The tenement wholly encompassed the Taysan copper deposit (Figure 2), which has been identified and 
drilled by a number of previous explorers. There is also a known gold prospect, Antipolo Gold Prospect, 
which also lies within the tenement boundary. 

FORTUN NARVASA & SALAZAR provided legal due diligence for TCC and CHR for the Taysan Project 
and Asian Arc.  Based on their evaluation of the Mining Tenements, they are of the opinion that: 

x Each of the Mining Tenements is in good standing, except EPA IVA-081 Amended, with respect to all 
applicable Philippine laws, rules and regulations, and with respect to all applicable Philippine 
governmental agencies, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the EPs and to further 
compliance with the requirements of the Mining Act in respect of the EP Applications. 

x Asian Arc, as assignee of the Application registered under the name of Kumakata by virtue of the Deed 
of Assignment dated August 13, 2010 between Asian Arc and Kumakata and registered with MGB 
Regional Office No. IV-A on October 13, 2010, must pursue the Motion for Reconsideration that it filed 
on February 21, 2011 in order to be able to obtain a reversal of the earlier denial of EPA IVA-081, 
Amended. 

x Except for the protest filed against EPA No. IVA-108 by the Office of the City Legal Officer of Batangas 
City on the ground that certain portions of the applied area fall within the designated special zone,

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY  

Please refer to, "A Technical Review of Exploration and Resource Estimates of the Taysan Project in 
Batangas Province, Philippines for Taysan Copper Corporation and Crazy Horse Resources Inc., June 
2010". 

The accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure and physiography are more fully detailed in Section 
4.5 of the Geosynthesis NI43-101 Report. 

5.1 Access 
Taysan is located approximately 20km east of the provincial capital, Batangas City, located on the south 
coast of Luzon. Batangas City is 100km and 1.5 hours away from Manila via the South Luzon Expressway 
and STAR Tollway. The project site is located 20km east of Batangas City via the National road to Lipa City 
and the town of Taysan.  Access is good in dry weather with sealed roads to within several kilometres of the 
project area (Figure 1).  

There is no existing airport in Batangas City however Ninoy Aquino International Airport is just 1.5 hours by 
road.  Alternatively, there is a government-operated airport, the Fernando Airbase in Lipa City, 
approximately 20km north northwest of Taysan. 

5.2 Climate 
Dry season extends from November to April and wet season for the rest of the year. The area falls within 
the Type 1 climate, with two pronounced seasons: dry from December to April and wet from May to 
November with average temperatures around 25ÂºC with April/May being the hottest months when 
temperatures can reach 35 â€“ 40ÂºC. The average annual rainfall is 1.6m with a monthly average of about 
14cm (Figure 3). The main atmospheric systems affecting rainfall are the southwest monsoon from June to 
September, the northeast monsoon from October to February and the easterly waves from March to April.

Typhoons, local thermal convections and inter-tropical convergence zones contribute significantly to the 
total annual rainfall. At least 27 tropical cyclones have been recorded tracking within 50 km of Taysan over 
the 104 year period 1906 to 2009, corresponding to an average of about 1 tropical cyclone every 4 years 
(Figure 4).

5.3 Infrastructure 
The regional and local infrastructure is described in the Geosynthesis NI43-101 Report. 

In May 2011, CHR entered into an agreement with a private Philippine company, to acquire its 15.94-
hectare port facility in Batangas, Philippines. The facility includes a six-metre-by-147-metre T pier with two 
dolphins, licensed foreshore lease, administrative buildings, security fencing and site services, including 
power and water. Access from the Taysan Project is via a 20-kilometre paved road.

5.4 Local Resources - Corporate Social Responsibility 
In May 2011, CHR received a formal resolution of support to develop its Taysan Project from the provincial 
board of Batangas, Republic of the Philippines, and a formal resolution of appreciation from the Taysan 
municipal council. Provincial resolution 253 was passed supporting the Company as "a responsible mining 
company and an active player in the private government partnership (a key initiative by President Aquino to 
spur development growth) in bringing about continued development and industrialization to the province of 
Batangas." 

Provincial Resolution 253 was passed supporting the Company and the Company's wholly owned 
Philippines development company as "a responsible mining company and an active player in the Private-
Government-Partnership (a key initiative by President Aquino to spur development growth) in bringing about 
continued development and industrialization to the Province of Batangas". Resolution 253 manifests 
government support of the Company's approach and mining methods to be used in the development of 
Taysan Copper Gold project. The Resolution recognizes that to achieve sustainable development, "it is 
imperative that the Province of Batangas and the Municipalities of Taysan and Lobo welcome and 
encourage the presence of foreign and local investors in the Province in the mineral industry such as Crazy 
Horse Resources Inc.".  

Municipal Resolution 2011-006 was passed by the Taysan Municipal Counsel Board, expressing gratitude 
to the Company and its officers for the invaluable support they have extended to the Taysan municipality. 

6 HISTORY 
Please refer to Geosynthesis NI-43-101 Report, Section 5, and the March 2011 NI43-101 Report, Section 8 
for descriptions of the property history. 

The Taysan project area has been investigated and drilled by four companies since 1968. A total of 195 
drillholes have been drilled up to 2009 with a total depth of 44,892m. Of this total, 154 holes were diamond 
core holes for 40,440m and the remaining 41 drillholes were drilled using the Reverse Circulation Hammer 
technique. Of the total 195 drillholes, 144 holes totalling 36,562m were drilled at or nearby the Taysan 
Deposit.   

There have been 4 historical resource estimates conducted for the mineralization intersected at Taysan 

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
Please refer to the Geosynthesis NI-43-101 Report, Section 6 and Section 8 and the March 2011 NI-43-101 
Report, Section 9.

Figure 5: Regional Geology of the Taysan Project 
(Source: CHR, 2011) 

7.1 Taysan Copper-Gold Deposit 
Mineralisation at Taysan is of porphyry copper style and nature probably occurring at between 1-2 km below 
the paleosurface.  Mineralisation comprises chalcopyrite and bornite with associated pyrite and Fe-Ti oxides 
(magnetite, sphene, ilmenite and rutile).  Fe-Ti oxides and biotite-chlorite alteration assemblages are 
intimately associated with copper mineralisation (De los Santos).   

Various authors have suggested that two separate mineralising events may have taken place: 

1. An initial porphyry style mineralising event associated with the cooling of the parent quartz diorite 
porphyry intrusion (circa 14.8 MA) and; 

2. Reactivation of porphyry copper mineralisation with later volcanic events at Mt Banoy (7.8 MA) and 
intrusion of porphyritic andesite and Dacite dykes. 

At Taysan copper mineralization has been observed to occur as: 

1. Disseminated or fine fracture filling chalcopyrite and bornite with biotite and magnetite, as potassic 
alteration products of original hornblende phenocrysts and sometimes associated with orthoclase 
veining or alteration/flooding of the diorite. 

2. Coarse chalcopyrite deposited with quartz-magnetite stockwork veins in the centre of the orebody. 
3. Late copper Â± bornite mineralisation also occurs as vein swarms and hydrothermal matrix-fill in late 

potassic stage hydrothermal breccias, often below of cross cutting quartz magnetite veins.  Due to their 
porosity these breccias are usually overprinted by late stage retro argillic alteration. 

Phase 1 is the oldest and Phase 3 is the youngest copper mineralising phase as observed from cross 
cutting relationships in core.  These mineralising events are logged as K1, K2 and K3 alteration phases. 

The upper portions of the ore body and to depth within the quartz-magnetite stockwork and breccia zones 
have been subject to a late stage phyllic alteration comprising sericite (illite)-quartz-pyrite-chlorite-hematite-
anhydrite to argillic alteration comprising sericite (smectite)-chlorite-calcite-epidote-pyriteÂ±kaolinite/dickite.  
This is interpreted to be due to late stage retrograde acidic/sulphate fluids refluxing down the more porous 
sections of the ore body.

T.M. Leach (1999) conducted a study of the mineralization at Taysan from which the following descriptions 
were extracted: 

 "Copper +/- gold mineralization at Taysan occurred during the waning stages of the porphyry system 
associated with moderately low temperature (<250-300C) chlorite-epidote-sericite-laumontite retrograde 
events. Ore grade (>0.25% copper) occurs in two sigmoidal, easterly dipping zones that are not related 
to the distribution of the dacite porphyry stocks, the Stage I potassic or the Stage II porphyry quartz 
veins. It is interpreted that these dilational features have formed in response to sinistral rotation on the 
NE-structures (Figure 6). It is speculated that the late stage mineralising fluids have exsolved from the 
deep parent melt to the dacitic porphyry stocks and migrated up the NE-structures. Cooling and/or 
dilution of these fluids within the dilational structures resulted in copper-gold mineralization. 

Figure 6: E-W cross-section of the geology and mineralization of the Taysan deposit 
(Source: after Leach, 1999) 

Chalcopyrite is the main copper mineral and was deposited almost exclusively during late stage (Stage 
IV) replacement and deposition. It occurs as: 

x As disseminated grains that fill open cavities in the wallrock, commonly associated with chlorite 
(+/- sericite) alteration of mafics 

x In thin discontinuous to sheeted fractures that cut the dacite porphyry and the 
diorite/granodiorite; and 

x In fractures and cavities in Stage II quartz and less commonly in Stage III K-feldspar-biotite 
veins associated with disseminated mineralization 

The chalcopyrite typically overgrows, but in places is intergrown with chlorite, epidote and sericite; and 
is overgrown, but locally intergrown with, calcite and rarely laumontite. 

Bornite is rare at Taysan and like chalcopyrite is almost exclusively associated with the Stage IV event. 
It is common where sericite alteration is intense and occurs as intergrowths with, and overgrowing 
chalcopyrite. Idaite locally co-exists with bornite. 

Pale yellow (iron poor) sphalerite occurs in sericite-chlorite veinlets at shallow levels and co-exists with 
chalcopyrite and trace galena. Traces of bismuth sulphosalts also are locally associated with 
chalcopyrite mineralization. Pyrite is rare, and is commonly absent from drill core at Taysan, and is only 
encountered in moderate quantities where sphalerite mineralization is present. 

Native gold is observed in trace amounts as inclusions in chalcopyrite hosted in sheeted Stage IV 
chlorite-carbonate+/- epidote +/- sericite veinlets."

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Please refer to Section 7 of the Geosynthesis NI-43-101 Report for descriptions of Deposit Types relevant 
to the Taysan Project. 

Taysan Copper deposit is considered a porphyry copper-gold deposit type (USGS Models 17 and 20C, Cox 
and Singer 1992) comprising copper mineralization comprising chalcopyrite veinlets, quartz + Magnetite 
veins + chalcopyrite + bornite + gold +silver, hosted within a hornblende diorite intrusive and later, 
fractionated, quartz diorite porphyry. 

The occurrence is within eroded intrusive stocks associated with the calc-alkaline Western Luzon Island Arc 
and subject to transcurrent faulting along the Verde Is fault, a splay off the Philippines Fault.

9 EXPLORATION 
Please refer to Section 12 of the March 2011 NI43-101 Report for descriptions of Exploration conducted in 
2010 and into 2011. 

During the acquisition process for the Taysan Project, a drilling program of 10 drill holes was undertaken 
between 1st October and 24th December 2010.  These drill holes were planned to twin various drill holes 
from the Benguet Corp, Newmont and Chase drilling programs, to check the copper, gold and silver assays 
reported previously and to check block models based on these earlier drill programs. In addition, field 
exploration involving geophysical surveys was also conducted. Results are reported in the March 2011 
NI43-101 Report. 

9.1 Crazy Horse Resources â€“ 2011 
The CHR exploration team consists of a team of eight Filipino Geologists under the supervision of Mr 
Eduardo Manuel with assistance by Ricardo Baja.  Geology Manager Mr Geoff Boswell provides 
management and technical direction.  Two geologists concentrate solely on field work while the remainder 
work mainly on the drilling program. 

9.1.1 Geophysical Surveys 
During late 2010 and early 2011, detailed ground magnetic surveys were conducted over the Taysan 
deposit and areas to the north, west and south of the deposit (Figure 8, Figure 9).   

Austhai Geophysics was tasked to perform a Ground Magnetics Survey over part of the Taysan ore body to 
determine whether this method could help locate potassic, quartz magnetite "high grade" mineralisation.  
The survey was carried out between the 1st Dec and the 23rd Dec 2010 and 5th Jan to 7th Feb 2011.  This 
survey was undertaken at 5m centres on lines trending 240o and 60m apart.  The north western area 
comprises 102 km of survey and the south eastern area comprises 30 km (Figure 8). 

The following equipment was used in the survey: 

x WCZ-2 Proton Magnetometer with Integrated GPS Receiver system 
x Scintrex ENVI PRO magnetometer Base station 
x Hand held 12 channel GPS system. 
x All wire/cables and accessories necessary for carrying out Magnetic surveys. 
x Field Processing Computer.  
x Hand Held UHF Radios 

This survey gave higher resolution and less noisy results than previous in-house surveys on lines 120m 
apart by Kumakata Corp.  A re-interpretation of regional aeromagnetics and radiometrics results obtained by 
Geodiscovery in 2005 also resulted in significant improvements in anomaly resolution, partly due to 
advancements in visualisation software and micro-levelling of data.

Figure 8: 2010 Area of Ground Magnetic Survey 
(Source: ASIAN ARC 2011) 

The 2010 Geodiscovery RTP (reduced to pole) re-interpretation was shown to have been undertaken with a 
significant NW filter which obscured the true nature of some anomalies.  The 2011 Austhai micro-levelled 
RTP data shows more realistic anomalies.  In particular, the anomaly that extends north of the proposed 
Taysan pit is shown to be much less significant than first thought (Figure 9). 

This northwestern oriented survey provided better resolution than previous surveys and considered useful 
for determining fault traces and offsets.  A magnetic high occurs over the quartz magnetite zone in the 
proposed open pit however magnetic highs also occur over areas of un-mineralised recent volcanics on the 
western side of the survey. 

CZT018 (Figure 8),drilled to 490.30m depth, tested an aeromagnetic and ground magnetic anomaly to the 
north of the Taysan Project ore body which was interpreted to be magnetite mineralization. The detailed 
micro-levelled ground magnetic survey showed this anomaly to be smaller in comparison to previous 
analyses of previous ground and aero-magnetic data and small in comparison with the Taysan deposit 
proper but still related to significant structures that require drill testing. The hole intersected altered andesitic 
volcanic rock and volcanic sediments for most of its length, explaining the magnetic anomaly and significant 
ore grade mineralization was only encountered in an 8 meter wide zone of andesitic volcanics assaying 
0.23% Cu and 0.105 g/t Au and 0.525 g/t Ag from 72 to 80 meters depth.

Figure 9: 2010 Ground Magnetic showing potential targets 

(Source: ASIAN ARC 2010) 

A ground magnetics survey at 5m centres on lines trending 240o and 60m apart was also carried out over 
the anomalous area to the south east of the proposed Taysan pit in the area of CZT038 (Figure 8) and the 
interpretation of the results suggested that copper anomalies in this area are probably less important than 
first thought.  As modelled by Chase Corporation in 1997, this southern area has most likely been up thrown 
therefore the small zones of copper porphyry mineralisation that are considered therefore to be vestigial, 
having been more significantly eroded than at Taysan proper. 

CZT038, drilled to 337.70, tested an aeromagnetic anomaly in the survey area which exhibits a projected 
ground magnetic anomaly and small chalcopyrite bearing outcrops to the south east of the Taysan Project 
ore body. This was interpreted to represent the outcrop of copper mineralised diorite porphyry ore bodies 
however CZT038 encountered coarse biotite, hornblende diorite with only minor chalcopyrite mineralisation 
and no significant mineralised intervals.  These diorite intrusives are interpreted to have been up-thrown and 
eroded, losing most if not all of the potentially copper mineralised zone to erosion.  This zone is within the 
proposed tailings dam. 

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Drilling 2010 
Please refer to Section 12 of the March 2011 NI43-101 Report for descriptions of drilling procedures and 
conducted in 2010 into 2011. 

The 2010 drilling was conducted during October and December 2010 and consisted of a total of 5,812.7m 
made up of six twinned drill holes to validate the historical drilling results and four holes to test the 
geological model. The results from this drilling indicated that there were no anomalous discrepancies in the 
copper data from Benguet, Newmont or Chase data.  This drilling also confirmed the Chase gold data to be 
correct and that the historical Benguet and Newmont gold data was reporting inflated gold values. The 
Benguet and Newmont gold data therefore was rejected for use in the March 2011 and in the current 
resource estimations.

10.2 Drilling 2011 
A planned 6,000 metre diamond drilling programme was commenced at Taysan in October 2010. The 
program continued into 2011 with an additional 13,811m drilled in 35 holes. Overall, 45 holes were drilled 
totalling 19,624 to June 2011.   

The drilling being carried out by United Philippines Drilling (UPD) a subsidiary or Quest Exploration Drilling 
(QED) utilising three Edson 1000 and two LF70's.  The Edson Drill rigs have a 1000 metres HQ capacity, 
though are not required to drill past 700m at this stage, the smaller LF70 have a 600 metre HQ capacity. 

The initial programme in 2010 focused on validating the previous (historical) drill results, (six twin holes, 
CZT001-006); and to validate the section interpretations and geological model (four holes, CZT007-010).  
Subsequently, a further 35 holes were drilled to bolster the mineral resource categories to satisfy NI43-101 
guidelines permitting an updated resource to be calculated. 

Holes are collared with PQ through the oxidized material, and are completed with HQ, leaving the option to 
case of and drill to completion with NQ should drilling complications arise.

10.4 Discussion 
The CHR drilling programme conducted during 2010-2011 at the Taysan Copper Deposit has confirmed the 
presence of the significant copper deposit within the Taysan Project.  The CHR drill programme focused on 
the central portion of the ore body, to develop confidence in a suitably large copper resource and define the 
associated gold, silver and magnetite potential.

11  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
Please refer to Section 14 and Section 15 of the March 2011 NI43-101 Report for descriptions of sample 
preparation, analyses and security. The following sub-sections cover new material since that reported in the 
March 2011 NI43-101 Report. 

Drilling is carried out by Quest Exploration Drilling (Philippines) Inc. using Edson 3000 and LF70 drill rigs 
and a triple tube diamond core drilling system. All holes are started in PQ (150-200m) then continued in HQ. 
All core is split using a diamond-bladed drill-core saw and always sampled from the (true) left side of the 
core. The remaining half of the core is sealed in plastic bags in a nitrogen atmosphere and stored in a 
covered, guarded core shed. Core samples are bagged in new polyethylene, UV stable plastic bags, sealed 
with a plastic tie, numbered outside and have a tag placed inside the bag. All samples are accompanied by 
Asian Arc personnel from site to the McPhar Laboratory under secure "Chain of Custody" procedures. 
McPhar Geoservices (Phil), Inc. is ISO 17025:2005 accredited and is a member of the International Intertek 
Laboratory Group. 

At the McPhar Laboratory, samples are crushed to 85% < 2 mm then 1 kg is split out and pulverised in an 
LM2 Puck and Bowl Pulveriser to 90% <75 um. Gold is assayed by Fire Assay (50g charge) with AAS finish 
(PM6). Cu, As, Mo, Fe and S are assayed by ore grade analysis, 3 Acid (HCl / HNO3 / HClO4) Digest with 
ICPAES finish (ICP-2). Ag is analysed by ore grade analysis (HNO3 / HClO4) digest with AAS finish 
(2A1/AAS). Sample rejects are returned from the McPhar Laboratory under secure "Chain of Custody" 
procedures by Asian Arc staff and also stored in the core shed in heat sealed plastic bags in a nitrogen 
atmosphere.

11.2 Recovery and quality 
Core recovery for the 32 CZT holes (CZT-011 to CZT-042) was slightly lower than that for the first 10 holes 
with 95% of the samples logged as 80-100% core recovery (98% for CZT-001 to CZT-010)  Table 3 lists the 
core recovery statistics.

11.3 Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements 
A program of Magnetic Susceptibility measurements was conducted to determine the magnetic content of 
the copper and gold mineralised material through the use of Magnetic Susceptibility("MagSus") meter. 
Magnetic susceptibility is the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field. 
The MagSus measurement procedure covers a range of information, including magnetic susceptibility 
principle, sample handling and operational details of the relevant specific procedures.  To determine the 
amount of magnetite the MagSus meter measures (i.e. excluding the response from other magnetic iron 
bearing minerals such as pyrrhotite), a linear correlation was determined using Davies Tube results ("DTT"). 
DTT measures the magnetic content in ore samples using a powerful electromagnet. The DTT gives a 
percent mass recovery of magnetic material and the recovered magnetic and non-magnetic portions can be 
analysed for chemical composition. 

The Geologist has the responsibility of performance of this procedure, unless those operations are assigned 
to other trained personnel in which case the geologist was responsible for the oversight of the operations. A 
laboratory notebook will record activities performed on each sample. 

The field office where magnetic susceptibility readings are being taken is not set up as a laboratory and staff 
are not trained to handle sample pulps outside the sealed plastic bag therefore  measurement of 
subsamples was not be carried out.  All measurements were of ~0.5 â€“ 1kg of fine rejects (90% <75um) 
inside the laboratory sealed plastic bag.  

Davis tube tests by ALS were carried out on 107 samples using a 20g subsample in a bench test set up.  
Correlation between the Davis tube results from ALS and magnetic susceptibility measurements by CHR 
staff on site was 0.997.  This is considered justification for the simplified method set out below for measuring 
MagSus of fine rejects inside the sample bag: 

1. Sample bags to be used are simple plastic bags designed to be heat sealed with no metallic ties or 
other components 

2. Clear the sample bag from staples and/or any metallic objects 
3. Record weight of the entire sample 
4. Hold the sample ensuring no void spaces inside the bag and is tightly pack 
5. Each sample is measured using a scanner, with the display result recorded  

A routine insertion of a standard reference material (standard), blank and duplicates were used for each 
batch of sample to be measured.  Results from these samples will be continuously monitored to assure the 
quality of analyses and to allow an estimate of accuracy of the method and provide batch failure criteria. A 
'failure table' will be maintained to document departures from the accepted limits and to track corrective 
action. Measurement exceeding the acceptable limits will be examined to determine if there has likely been 
a sample mix-up in the field or laboratory, or whether it is likely an analytical issue that will require corrective 
action. Where necessary, the batch is re-measured.

11.4 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) 
Quality Assurance ("QA") concerns the establishment of measurement systems and procedures to provide 
adequate confidence that quality is adhered to. Quality Control ("QC") is one aspect of QA and refers to the 
use of control checks of the measurements to ensure the systems are working as planned.  

The QC terms commonly used to discuss geochemical data are: 

x Precision: how close the assay result is to that of a repeat or duplicate of the same sample, i.e. the 
reproducibility of assay results.  

x Accuracy: how close the assay result is to the expected result (of a certified standard).  
x Bias: the amount by which the analysis varies from the correct result.  

11.4.1 QA/QC Program 
According to CRH's QA/QC procedures, the following samples are taken or inserted into the sample stream.  

x Certified Reference Materials ("CRM"): 0.7, 0.35 and 0.15% Cu and a certified blank are added at 
the planned rate of one every 20 samples. CRM assess accuracy. 

x Field Blank: Samples of a "blank", known to contain low level of economically interesting metals are 
randomly inserted into the sample stream to replace every 4th CRM (i.e. 1 in 80). Blanks assess 
contamination. 

x Field Duplicate Samples ("FD"): Every 30th sample is cut twice into Â¼ core.  Both samples are 
inserted into the sampling stream and prepared and assayed like any other sample.  The results 
can be examined as a duplicate sample.  The results are combined and averaged to give the value 
that goes into the resource database.  This sample is used to monitor sample batches for poor 
sample management, contamination and tampering and laboratory precision. FD assess precision. 
The FD insertion is new to the program for 2011 and started with hole CZT-020 (Figure 11): 

In addition, CHR has instructed McPhar laboratory to conduct duplicate assaying and repeats:  

x Laboratory Duplicates ("LD"): The assay lab is instructed to prepare a split of the crushed samples 
every 20th sample to be pulverised and assayed for comparison with the original assay. LD assess 
precision. 

x Laboratory Repeats: The assay lab also runs duplicate assays on every 10th pulverised sample as 
an internal check. Lab repeats assess precision and bias. 

x Referee Laboratory - Duplicate Assays by an Independent Laboratory: Up to 10% of pulps are to be 
sent for duplicate assay to another laboratory i.e. SGS Manila, Jakarta, China, or ALS, Perth.  
These results are than plotted against the original McPhar results to check for anomalous results, 
contamination or equipment failure or calibration trends (bias).  

These QA/QC methods, namely routine blank, duplicate and internal standards as well as the laboratory 
check assaying are considered adequate for the determination of accuracy and precision.

11.4.2 QA/QC Results 
Laboratory Duplicates: Precision 

The quality of the sample preparation process is determined by replicating samples early in the sample 
preparation process. Commonly referred to a second splits, the second split is taken immediately after the 
core is crushed to a nominal 2mm fragment size. Second splits monitor the quality of the sample 
preparation process within the laboratory, identifying inherent sample variability and errors beyond the 
crushing circuit.   



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project

Page 34 of 142 

The results of the second split graphs show 90% within the 50% difference ranges for copper, 42% for gold 
and 61% for Mo.  Failures are defined as one of the pair of duplicate values being 50% greater or lesser 
than the other. Most of the failures are from samples with very low assay results, i.e. near detection limit, 
and are not considered significant due to the inherent lower precision associated with detection level assays 
(i.e. precision decreases approaching the diction limit of the assay technique). There were 18 Au failures 
however only one is considered significant being the only one at a grade greater than 0.1 ppm: sample 
606832 from hole CZT-029, 0.216 ppm vs BL (Figure 15, Table 4). This sample also returned one of the 2 
significant Cu failures, 4451 ppm vs 81 ppm Cu (Figure 13) and a failure for Mo as well (Figure 17). The other 
Cu failure of note is from 6002938 in CZT-012, 4656 vs 2820 ppm Cu. There were 12 Mo failures, 3 of 
which are considered significant. 

The six failures considered significant are not a concern as only 1 is a multiple element failure in the same 
sample. They may reflect inherent sample variability. Sample 606832 is an exception due to the extreme 
high grade: low grade multi-element result and should be investigated.

The results show that the sample preparation protocols put in place by McPhar are acceptable however the 
high grade Cu failure although rare, indicates that monitoring of the second splits should continue.   

The results are illustrated in Figure 12 to Figure 17 and do not indicate any significant bias in the results.

Laboratory Repeats: Precision 

Sample precision is the ability to replicate a result, it does not give assurance the result is correct.  To test 
precision laboratories will sub-sample twice from the one sample pulp (laboratory repeats).  This gives the 
lab and client assurance the analytical technique is performing.  It is the simplest form of quality control.  

Results are plotted in Figure 18 to Figure 20 and show very high precision for copper and molybdenum and 
high precision for gold. Precision lessens for gold and molybdenum approaching the analysis detection 
limits. The pattern of the Mo plot for the relative percent difference chart (Figure 20) reflects the rounding of 
detection limit assay results.

Referee Laboratory: Duplicate Assays by an Independent Laboratory  

Sample pulps are sent for duplicate assay to independent laboratory, SGS-CSTC Standards Technical 
Services ("SGS") located in Tianjin, China, another independent laboratory.  SGS is a global leader in Audit, 
Certification and Training Services.  

The assay results are plotted against the original McPhar results to check for anomalous results, 
contamination or equipment failure or calibration trends. One hundred and sixty (160) sample from drill 
holes CZT-001 to CZT-010 including 17 CRM were sent to SGS. The comparison results are displayed in 
Figure X to Figure Y.  

They show that there are no suggestions of contamination or anomalous results for the Taysan samples 
processed for copper, gold and molybdenum. There are 4 "failures" for Cu, 17 for Au and 23 for Mo. None of 
the apparent failures are significant with all being very low to near detection levels which is not unexpected 
due to the varying precision levels for the assay techniques for the 2 labs (Table 5). MA notes that many of 
the failures including all the 4 Cu failures are from analysis of CRM Oreas 22b, a blank standard which we 
note in the following section has been over reported during the first phase of drilling (CZT-001 to CZT-010). 
This issue was subsequently corrected during the following drilling program.

Standards: Accuracy 

Accuracy is identifying the true grade of a sample, often achieved by submitting certified reference material 
("CRM") commonly referred to as standards ("STD"). 

ORE Research & Exploration Pty Ltd ("Oreas"), the CRM supplier, uses sophisticated proprietary 
technology ensures high levels of homogeneity, with industry-leading repeatability.  All CRMs are prepared 
and certified to ISO standards and are supplied with comprehensive documentation detailing the elements 
and expected limits.  Individual assays for each standard are plotted on a time sequential basis onto 
separate charts.  Short-term problems are identified by any assay lying outside of the two standard 
deviation limits (expected limits).  Experience shows that a large proportion of these problems can be 
rectified without re-assaying as they relate to calculation or transcription errors. (Roden & Smith 2001) 

CHR selected five CRM to specifically monitor waste (barren), approximate cut off grade, low and high 
grade material (Table 6). A total of 511 CRM were submitted for an insertion rate of 1 in 11 with 45% being 
blank CRM.

There were 4 obvious mislabelling or STD insertion errors, i.e. wrong STD labelled or inserted as the 
anomalous results match the range for one of the other STD.

Only Oreas 50c and 52c contained values for silver but are not given Oreas standard deviation performance 
gates. In this case, MA used the internal standard deviation of the dataset to determine accuracy. 

Figure 30: Silver Results from Oreas 50c and 52c 

The results from the low, medium and high grade CRM are very consistent and within the tolerance levels 
indicating consistent accuracy in assay results for the assay techniques used for all the elements listed 
above with the exception of sulphur which shows a series of under call results from Oreas 52c samples 
inserted in CZT-024, CZT-026 to CZT-029 (Figure 27). 

Blank Standards: Accuracy and Contamination 

As with the previous QA/QC report (March 2011 NI43-101), the blank standard (Oreas 22b) shows some 
"contamination" (Figure 31) which may be a function of the lack of precision with analysis near the detection 
limits particularly for Mo.  Oreas 22b shows consistent copper over call (Figure 31) however results for CRM 
Oreas 22c are within tolerance levels (Figure 31) as defined by 2 SD to 3 SD for Cu.   

The insertions for Oreas 22c began with hole CZT-037 and Oreas 22b insertions ceased with CZT-038. The 
improved accuracy shown by the Oreas 22c results suggests either improved laboratory controls or that the 
CRM 22b is not consistent, i.e. Cu content is corrupted or not as certified. The results displayed in Figure 31 
indicate a tightening of values about the certified value for Oreas 22b over the last 24 samples, i.e. an 
improvement in laboratory results.  This is consistent with the SGS lab results noted above.  Following 
discussions with McPhar and MA representative Ian Taylor in March 2011, the analytical process was 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 42 of 142 

adjusted correct the over call for copper in very low grade material.  We suggest using both Oreas 22b and 
Oreas 22c going forward to confirm this interpretation. 

MA notes that for Mo, the lower tolerance levels are beyond the assay technique's detection level (5 ppm) 
which explains the level base for the lower value for both blank CRM. The Mo results of use therefore are 
higher values which show consistent over call for both CRM (Figure 33) indicating a lack of accuracy for Mo 
analysis as these low grades rather than contamination.  

Gold results for both blank CRM are within the tolerance levels for all results indicating no gold 
contamination during the assay process.   

Figure 31: Copper Blank Standard Oreas 22b and 22c 
 

Figure 32: Gold Blank Standard Oreas 22b and 22c 
 

Figure 33: Molybdenum  Blank Standard Oreas 22b and 22c 

The possibility of Oreas 22b being corrupted for Cu content was examined by comparing the results for 
copper using the sample population average and SD to interpret the sample precision. High precision of 
results (although not accurate in terms of the CRM defined value) would point to an error with the CRM 
rather than an error with sample analysis. It would also indicate any trends in analysis results over time. The 
SD for Cu for the sample population is 2.70 compared to 0.7 for the CRM. The results are displayed in 
Figure 34 and are ambiguous as the time sequence of results in Figure 34 and Figure 31 indicates a 
tightening of values about the certified value rather than the average grade, i.e. an improvement in 
laboratory results over the last 24 samples.

Field Blanks: Contamination 

Field Blank standards are obtained from within the vicinity of the project area by selecting an un-mineralised 
outcrop of similar mineralogy and weathering as the samples being submitted.  This could also be a nearby 
andesite quarry so the rock is pre-crushed to 2-4 cm.  The crushed rock is hand mixed with a shovel on a 
tarpaulin, then bagged.  A scoop can be taken for each field Blank sample and they will look similar to core 
being submitted. 

Field Blanks were to be submitted into the sample submissions to the Laboratory in lieu of a standard as a 
substitute for every 3rd or 4th standard, using the same numbering system. A total of 83 field blanks were 
used for an insertion rate of 1 in 64 samples. The planned rate was 1 in 80.  

The results are plotted in Figure 35 and Figure 36.

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 44 of 142 

Figure 37: Field Blank â€“ Ag results 

The results show that values for Au, Mo and Ag are well within the tolerance limits (5 x the detection limit) 
with the exception of one sample (607338 from CZT-032) which returned 74 ppm Cu, 0.024 ppm Au, 34 
ppm Mo, 1.6 ppm Ag and 0.41% S. The assay results of drill core samples in the sample stream adjacent to 
this blank insertion should be examined for evidence of contamination. 

Cu and S results were totally outside the tolerance levels indicating that the background Cu and S content 
of the field blank is too high to be used as a blank as the results cannot be distinguished from external Cu 
contamination. In order to detect potential Cu contamination, it would be necessary to either: 

x use another source rock for the field blank which does not contain the levels of background copper 
as the current field blanks do;  

x restrict the analysis to Au and other near DL elements (Ag) on the assumption that anomalous 
result with these elements would pick up related Cu contamination, or  

x use the certified blanks for detecting Cu contamination during the assay process.  

Field Duplicates: Precision 

In the March 2011 NI-43-101 report, MA recommended that field duplicates be used to monitor the precision 
of the entire sampling and assaying process.  As a result, Â¼ core field duplicates were introduced in the 
sample stream starting with CZT-020.  The Field duplicate procedure at Taysan consists of taking a normal 
2m Â½ core sample and cutting it into Â¼'s.  Each half will be submitted as a field duplicate and noted as 
Fieldup_1 and Fieldup_2 in the Category column. This was to be done every 30th core sample as part of 
the sampling process.  

A total of 101 field duplicate are recorded in the database MA reviewed, indicating an insertion rate of about 
1 in 35, slightly less than the target rate of 1 in 30. 

Overall the precision shown in this data is very good for copper and gold but less precise for molybdenum. 

Failure results are tabulated in Table 8. Results for copper are very consistent with only 2 failures, i.e. one 
of the pair of duplicate values being 50% greater or lesser than the other, but only 1 of which is considered 
significant due to the high grade involved. The duplicate for sample 607888 assayed almost double the 
grade of the original (8405 vs 4791 ppm Cu). 

Gold had 8 fails of which 2 are significant, including sample 607888. Molybdenum has the most failures of 
which 8 are considered significant due to the grade.

There is a very slight indication of the lower assay bias in the duplicate results for copper (Figure 38). Gold 
shows slight bias for high values in the duplicates (Figure 40).  Results for Mo (Figure 42) show a greater 
spread (lower precision) than that for Cu and Au. Ag results (Figure 44, Figure 45) indicate lower precision 
at values less than 1ppm.

11.4.3 QA/QC 11.3 Magnetic Susceptibility 
Davis tube tests by ALS were carried out on 107 samples using a 20g subsample in a bench test set up.  
Correlation between the Davis tube results from ALS and magnetic susceptibility measurements by CHR 
staff on site was 0.997.   

Following the results of Davis Tube analysis on selected fine rejects, magnetic susceptibility measurement 
on CZT001 to CZT042 fine rejects was conducted. The measurements were made using a KT-10 magnetic 
susceptibility in contact with the fine rejects bag surface. Before and after each reading, free air 
measurement was made to allow correction for linear background drift. To determine the accuracy and 
precision of the values obtained, fine rejects originally submitted to ALS for Davis Tubes analysis 
(duplicates), 34 x 10-5 Georadis 2010/12 Magnetic susceptibility standard, and a block of wood (blank) were 
inserted. 

Prior to measurement of magnetic susceptibility on fine rejects, several sighter test were conducted to 
determine the correlation between the actual % magnetite content to magnetic susceptibility. Figure 46 
depicts the results of some these sighter test: 
 

Figure 46: Sighter test results -correlation between  % magnetite content and Magsus

Page 49 of 142 

With these successful correlation results, measurement of magnetic susceptibility through fine rejects 
sample bag was recommended to obtain values for CZT001 to CZT042 which was then correlated to ALS 
normalized results. 

To monitor measurement accuracy, ALS Samples with known magnetic susceptibility values, a magnetic 
susceptibility standard from Georadis and a block of wood was inserted. Figure 47 shows the resulting 
magsus results relative to expected 3rd standard deviation ("3SD") upper and lower control limits. MA notes 
that all values including the controls fall within the the 3SD limits. 

Figure 47: MagSus Accuracy Control Chart  
 
The ALS samples with known values were also used to monitor repeatability of magnetic susceptibility 
measurements. Results are illustrated in Figure 48 which show a high level of precision with no failures 
indicated in the relative percent difference chart.

11.5 Discussion on Accuracy 
Discussions were held with McPhar's General Manager-Laboratory Operation Mr Craig Ritchie and Geology 
Manager Taysan Mr Geoff Boswell and MA representative Ian Taylor on 16 March 2011, a number of 
QA/QC issues were raised and addressed: 

x Assay methodology changed from three acid digest to four acid digest 
x Field duplicates were introduced 
x Field blanks were introduced 
x Independent Referee Laboratory Checks introduced 
x Ongoing CRM were monitored on a more frequent basis 

Sample protocols, including sample methodology, preparation, analysis and data verification have been 
conducted in accordance with industry standards using appropriate quality assurance/quality control 
procedures since the inception of CHR work in 2010 under the direct supervision of the Geology Manager 
Mr Geoff Boswell.  MA was impressed with the high level of professionalism with which the field programs 
were organised and executed, being to international standards. 

Following the introduction of changes listed above, McPhar internal laboratory repeat assay results indicate 
the laboratory is reporting precise results. The referee laboratory results indicate that there are no issues of 
contamination or equipment failure or calibration trends. The results the CHR inserted CRM indicate that the 
McPhar assay results are accurate and precise for mineralised material, and less precise with very low 
grade material.  The low grade precision may have improved with the increased accuracy for Cu from a 
change in analysis process as noted from results after the adjustment from Oreas 22b and from the new 
blank standard (Oreas 22c).  

MA notes that Oreas 22c blank standard returned copper values within tolerance limits; as were all the gold 
values from the both blank CRM. For the regular Oreas standards, all elements are consistently within 
tolerance levels with the exception of sulphur in Oreas 52c. There were a number of outliers across all 
elements for several standards, all of which are related to mislabelling of standards, i.e. a high grade CRM 
is mislabelled as a blank CRM. 

MA notes that the copper CRM analysis of results reported in the March 2011 NI43-101 report were based 
on the 95% confidence level which over reported CRM failures. MA has used the 2nd and 3rd standard 
deviation (i.e. certified value +/- 2 or 3 SD) as the tolerance limits for this report. All CRM results with the 
exception of the blank CRMs and sulphur in Oreas 52c mentioned above, are within 2 SD limits for the 2011 
drilling.

In the March 2011 NI-43-101 report, MA recommended that field duplicates be used to monitor the precision 
of the entire sampling and assaying process.  As a result, Â¼ core field duplicates were introduced in the 
sample stream. Results from 101 field duplicates indicate that overall the precision is very good for copper 
and gold but less precise for molybdenum and silver (below 1ppm).. 

The field blanks values for Cu and S results were totally outside the tolerance levels indicating that the 
background Cu and S content of the field blank is too high to be used as a blank, although the Au, Mo and 
Ag results were satisfactory.  

The high accuracy and precision of the magnetic susceptibility measurements was demonstrated from the 
results recorded for values obtained from the duplicates, standard and blank, the results for which were 
review by MA  

Recommendations 

MA recommends using both Oreas 22b and Oreas 22c going forward to confirm the interpretation that 
McPhar has improved analysis procedures for low grade copper material. 

MA recommends investigation of Lab Duplicate sample 606832 from hole CZT-029 which returned very low 
grade gold and copper results from a lab duplicate of high grade material. The results from the adjacent 
samples should be reviewed to check whether there are any anomalous results, i.e. low grade where high 
grade may be expected according to the logging. If warranted, these samples including 606832 should be 
re-assayed. 

MA recommends investigation of Field Duplicate sample 607888 from CZT-037, a duplicate which assayed 
almost double the grade of the original (8405 vs 4791 ppm Cu). The results from the adjacent samples 
should be reviewed to check whether there are any anomalous results relative to the duplicate and logging. 
If warranted, these samples including 607888 should be re-assayed. 

MA recommends investigation of Field Blank sample 607338, which was inserted in the sample stream with 
hole CZT-032 This sample returned anomalous results across all elements. The drill core samples in the 
sample stream adjacent to this blank insertion should be examined for evidence of contamination. 

Due to the high copper background values of the material used for field blanks, MA recommends that in 
order to detect potential Cu contamination, it would be necessary to either: 

x use another source rock for the field blank which does not contain background copper as the 
current field blanks do;  

x restrict the analysis to Au and other near DL elements (Ag) on the assumption that anomalous 
result with these elements would pick up related Cu contamination, or  

x use the certified blanks for detecting Cu contamination during the assay process 

MA suggests increasing the insertion rate for field duplicates to 1 in 30, decreasing the insertion rate of 
CRM from the current 1 in 11 to 1 in 20.  

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Review of Historical Drilling Results 
CHR undertook a ten drill hole programme between October and December 2010, to confirm the tenor of 
the historic drilling. The results of this study were reported in the March 2011 NI43-101.  The twinned holes 
showed that the mineralisation is quite repeatable with similar thickness of mineralisation and similar assay 
results.  The basic statistics were collated for the two potentially economic elements, copper and gold.  The 
copper results are similar and are within acceptable tolerances for the major historical drill data sets.  Gold, 
while less comprehensively sampled historically; drilling demonstrated elevated historical gold results 
compared to CHR gold results.   

The initial ten diamond holes drilled by CHR have validated the historical copper data.  In addition, the CHR 
gold results have confirmed the Chase gold data to be correct and that the Benguet gold data was reporting 
inflated gold values.  As a result of these findings, MA recommended using historical data only to identify

October 2011 

 

Page 52 of 142 

the high grade gold mineralisation trend (tonnes) and not to use historical Benguet and Newmont gold data 
for the purpose of estimation. 

12.2 Site Visit & Independent Samples 
As reported in the March 2011 NI43-101m, there were two site visits to the Taysan copper project area 
conducted by Mr Ian Taylor for MA, on 20 October 2010 and again on 22 January 2011.  At the time of Mr 
Taylor's first visit, 2 core holes had been started, the third rig had arrived on site though was being 
commissioned.  Mr Taylor's second visit (22 January 2011) coincided with the completion of the initial 10 
hole 6,000m programme when, the five drill rigs were commencing the drill out phase of the project in 
preparation for the pre-feasibility study. 

12.3 Discussion and Limitations 
No independent samples were collected due to the advanced stage of the project and the previous sampling 
conducted for the Geosynthesis NI43-101 Report.  

Due to the confirmatory results of the test drilling (detailed in the 31 March 2011 NI43-101) and site visits 
inspections and procedure audits, it is MA's opinion that the data is adequate for the mineral resource 
estimation update described in this report. 

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Please refer to Section 16 of the March 2011 NI43-101 Report for descriptions of recent metallurgical 
testing prior to 2011. The following sub-sections cover new material since that reported in March 2011. 

One of the recommendations of the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 report was to test for the potential to produce 
magnetite concentrate due to the apparent high magnetite content of the mineralization. It was 
recommended Davis Tube testing (DTR) of drill core samples to determine the resources and grade 
variations and calibration of the magnetic susceptibility of drill core with the DTR results to minimise the 
DTR testing over the resource. A total of 520 samples were considered for magnetite metallurgical test 
work. Further consideration to the proportion of each alteration type within the deposit determined the 
number of samples for each zone.  In total 107 samples, across 12 drill holes, were selected to take into 
consideration the rock type alteration type and location for specific 2 m composites for Davis Tube test 
work. This work was performed at a constant magnetic intensity of 3,000 Gauss.  Additionally 6 composites, 
each of 1 kg were split from the fine reject residues to represent the range of alteration types within the 
mineralisation.  These samples were subjected to a range of magnetic separation intensities from 600 to 
3,000 Gauss. Testing was conducted by Australian Laboratory Services Pty. Ltd. (ALS) an ISO 17025:2005 
accredited laboratory, in Perth Western Australia.  

Magnetite recovery from the Taysan resource was estimated from: 

1. Davis Tube Recovery (DTR) data at various magnetic intensities conducted on samples with a P80 
feed size of approximately 38 Âµm. 

2. Industry test data to allow a calibration between SiO2, magnetite recovery and grind size. 
3. An offset of DTR recoveries to simulate a 20 Âµm P80 feed grind with a magnetite concentrate 

containing 2.5% SiO2 to 2.0% SiO2. 
4. Generation of a relation between magnetite recovery and feed magnetite content at a 20 Âµm P80 

feed grind with a magnetite concentrate containing 2.5.% SiO2 to 2.5.% SiO2. 
5. Application of this relation to a set of 8,238 magnetite values calculated from magnetic susceptibility 

readings. 

The limited evaluation of magnetite recovery was conducted at ALS as mentioned above were conducted at 
a reported feed size of 38 Âµm and represented rougher type magnetic separation conditions. 

The magnetite recovery, Rmag was calculated with the standard formula:

where cmag is the magnetite grade of the Davis Tube concentrate and fmag is the magnetite grade of the 
Davis Tube feed sample. 

Figure 50 shows the magnetite grade versus magnetite recovery for samples of various feed grades, tested 
under various magnetic intensities. 

Samples TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 produced magnetite recoveries of up to 65% at 
relatively concentrate grades of approximately 90% magnetite. Each showed the typical trend of increasing 
magnetite recovery and decreasing concentrate magnetite grade with increasing magnetic intensity.  

Sample TayPhyC1 produced an anomalous result with a lower quality concentrate largely independent of 
magnetic intensity. 

Based on the analysis of the preliminary Davis Tube test results a magnetite recovery of 52% for magnetite 
for the life of mine has been determined.  This determination is preliminary and an ongoing program of test 
work is currently underway to evaluate the recovery improvement and concentrate upgrade potential for the 
magnetite.

Considering the elevated concentrate TiO2 grade the Davis Tube concentrates were evaluated from a 
perspective of suitability to produce a concentrate for the heavy media market. Figure 52 shows the SiO2 
concentrate grade versus magnetite recovery for the samples tested under various magnetic intensities. 

Samples TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 showed the typical trend of decreasing SiO2 content in 
concentrate with decreasing magnetic intensity. At 600 Gauss these samples achieved a Davis Tube 
concentrate SiO2 grade varying between 4% and 5%. Although above a typical heavy media specification of 
between 4% SiO2 and 5% SiO2 there is a high probability that specifications can be met through finer 
grinding and cleaning stages and being tested in the current test work program. Sample TayPhyC1 
produced an anomalous result with high SiO2 content in the concentrate largely independent of magnetic 
intensity.

Figure 52: Davis Tube Magnetite Recovery Versus Concentrate SiO2 Grade 

Figure 53 details a typical effect of reducing grind size on the SiO2 grade in magnetite concentrate from 
Davis Tube tests. The trend line for Taysan indicates that to achieve a SiO2 grade in magnetite concentrate 
of 3% at a 20 Âµm grind, the SiO2 grade at the test grind of 38 Âµm will need to be 5.9% SiO2 or less. Samples 
TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 all match this criterion however, sample TayPhyC1 does not.

14  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Resource Estimates 

14.1.1 Estimation Methodology and Testing 
A global resource estimate for Taysan Copper Project was undertaken by Mining Associates Pty Ltd, using 
standard Surpac block models, grade was interpolated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) within grade wireframes 
which were based on 0.1% and 0.3% Cu grade cut-off.  The estimation was based on historical and more 
recent Asian Arc drillhole data. 

The project database consists of 240 drillholes (64,516 metres) consisting of 199 diamond drillholes (60,064 
metres) and 41 RC drillholes (4,452 metres).  The mineral resource is defined by 165 holes resulting in 
5,064 informing eight metre composites.  The informing composites are derived from 164 diamond drillholes 
(5,054 composites) and 1 RC drillhole intercepts (10 composite).  75 holes had no significant intercepts, and 
were not included within the resource boundary. 

The grade estimation uses ordinary kriging into a parent block size of 60 m (E) by 60 m (N) by 20 m (RL). A 
sub-block size of 15 m (E) by 15 m (N) by 5 m (RL) was used against all wireframes for volumes. 

It is not possible to perform an independent audit of the historic data in the resource area because 
supporting documentation in the form or original laboratory assay sheets and certificates, original geological 
logs or drill core was not available.  MA recommended a confirmatory drill program and CHR conducted the 
initial confirmatory programme; ten drill hole for 5,812.7m; during October and December 2010, six twinned 
drill holes and four holes to test the geological model.  There were no anomalous discrepancies in the 
copper data from Benguet, Newmont or Chase data.  The recent Asian Arc gold results have confirmed the 
Chase gold data to be correct, the drilling has also confirmed Geosysthsis' concern that Benguet gold data 
was reporting inflated gold values (NI43-101, June 2010). It is also noted Newmont data displays elevated 
results compared to Asian Arc Data. MA used historical and recent Asian Arc data for the estimation of 
copper, however continued to reject the use Benguet and Newmont gold data for the purpose of gold 
estimation.

14.1.2 Supplied Data 
MA was supplied with CHR's drill database, as an access database; TaysanDB_2011Jun30.mdb (Table 9):

The original Chase recorded coordinates for Benguet and Chase holes were maintained and the remainder 
of the holes were transformed using a two point transformation.  Asian Arc surveyed 39 historic holes (Table 
10) recorded collar coordinates post 1990 were found to be accurate.  Holes drilled pre 1990 were generally 
accurate, the worst case (BT050) was 6.7 metres from the recorded collar.  Two historic holes identified in 
the field were selected as control point to transform drill holes without recorded chase grid coordinates, 
(CT009 and CT012)

The review of the metallurgical report identified holes CT22 through CT28 as drilled yet no collar, assay, 
geology logs or down hole survey data is available.  Collar details for hole CT021 are recorded, though no 
assay data is available the geology logs indicate this is hole has targeted some high grade mineralisation.  
MA recommends the missing data for these chase holes be located and added to the resource database. 

TY drill series were suspected of erroneous sample lengths, (too compact) and were not used for the 
purpose of grade estimation of grade.

There dimensional topography was supplied as a thinned Lidar surface map (taysanlidarxyz.dtm), the data 
points were thinned to preserve the detail in topographically complex areas and simplify detail in flat and 
undulating regions. Lithology and alteration wire frame models were supplied by the client. 

A thorough search, as recommended by MA (11 March Report) by site failed to locate details of the 
metallurgical holes CT021 to CT026, these holes are not used in the definition of the resource. 

14.1.3 Dimensions 
The area of interpreted mineralisation extends 1.7km along strike and up to 0.75km down dip (19520m N).  
The depth as defined by drilling is approximately 400m from the outcrop at elevation 150mASL to -400m 
BSL. The copper deposit is divided into two domains, (above 1000ppm Cu and above 3000ppm Cu) which 
are subsequently divided into sub-domains.  The gold, silver and magnetite mineralisation is not domained 
independently of the copper sub-domains; Enriched zones of copper, gold, silver and magnetite are 
associated with quartz magnetite alteration.

Geological and grade modelling work encompassed all previous drilling including of the CHR 2010/2011 
drilling.  Modelling work was extended vertically to the limits of the current drillhole assay database, section 
interpretations were extended a maximum of 120 metres down dip beyond the limit of drilling in the east.  
Mineralisation is restricted to the west by the unconformity with the overlying volcanic tuffs.  The deposit is

Page 58 of 142 

not constrained by drilling along strike and mineralisation is interpreted to be continuous between drill holes 
both along strike and down dip.  Mineralisation is restricted to 60 metres beyond lateral drill extents. 

14.2 Geologic Interpretation 
The Taysan Copper Deposit is a "Porphyry Copper" style deposit, gently dipping east (30o).  The deposit 
has a higher grade core of greater than 0.3% copper within a halo of 0.1% copper mineralisation. 

Lithological and alteration models were provided by the client.  MA reviewed and validated the 3D models.  
Interpretations were constructed on 60m drill sections.  The dominant lithologies, San Juan Metavolcanics 
and porphyritic diorites are modelled as three dimensional triangulations, the ash overburden is modelled as 
a digital terrain model.  Five alteration types were modelled; argillic (arg), potassic with silica and magnetite 
(K2), potassic (K1), phyllic (phyll) and breccia although not strictly an alteration.  Geological logs were 
simplified for the purposes of modelling, rock codes were wireframed into Quartz Diorite, Hornblende 
Diorite, General Diorite and MetaSediments/Volcanitcs.  Alteration was combined as background propolytic, 
over written with Argillic, Phylic, Potassic (1 & 2) and finally Breccia.  Rock codes were assigned to the 
block model as a four character code; rocks are the prefix and alteration the suffix.

- - BX Breccia 

Mineralized sub-domains were interpreted on 60m drill sections, in conjunction with continuity confirmation 
from 25m flitch plans. The mineralised envelopes were digitised using a general 0.1% Cu lower cut-off. The 
mineralised intercepts were defined by a minimum width of eight metres downhole with some internal waste 
dilution allowed but every effort was made to exclude sub-grade zones.  There is no limit in the total length 
of waste inside a mineralized intercept provided the average grade is above 0.1 % Cu. The mineralized 
outlines were extended to a maximum of 2 times the drill spacing (120m) beyond the last drill holes down 
dip.  Mineralised interpretation was extended one drill section along strike (60m). 

The low grade domain (0.1% Cu) is constrained by seven large wireframe objects (ore_v4_1000,dtm), no 
reported resources occurs outside this wireframe.  The higher grade internal 0.3% Cu wireframe has been 
identified as more continuous than previous interpretations (11 March 2011 NI43-101 Report) and consists 
of 4 wireframes (ore_v4_3000.dtm); all wireframes are defined by more than three holes though some are 
only defined on one 60m east - west drill section.  Where the 0.3% Cu wireframe extrudes the 0.1% Cu 
wireframe blocks are reset to waste. 

The post/syngenetic mineralisation porphyries are modelled as internal waste zones (wsts_v4_1000.dtm), 
very low copper grades are associated with these late stage porphyries, copper within the late porphyries 
has not been reported as a resource. 

14.3 Data Preparation and Statistical Analysis  
The statistical analysis of the grade was carried out in Supervisor Software.  The Supervisor suite of 
applications provides an efficient, robust and easy to use toolset for practical geological data analysis. The 
application has been adopted by industry professional throughout the world, and is now regarded as a 
benchmark by the mining and resources industry.  

Prior to a statistical analysis grade domaining is required to delineate homogeneous areas of grade data.  
Statistical analysis does not take into account the spatial relationships of the data. 

The purpose of the statistical analysis is to define the main characteristics of the underlying grade 
distribution to assist with the geological and grade modelling work.  This process is important as the 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 59 of 142 

statistics of the individual sample populations can influence how the grade data is treated and the 
application of the grade estimation techniques.  For example highly skewed data may require special grade 
capping and semivariogram analysis requirements. 

The raw drillhole database is stored in an Access relational database. The Taysan database is connected 
directly to Surpac for data display, down-hole compositing, wireframing of homogeneous grade domains 
and block model estimation.  Surpac is used to export the data as comma delimited files for importation into 
Supervisor. 

14.3.1 Drill Hole Spacing 
Drill hole data spacing is variable within each domain, though the majority of the ore body is drilled on 60m x 
120m grid, the region between 19400mN and 19700mN within the high grade 0.3%Cu zone is infill drilled on 
60m sections.

14.3.2 Compositing 
An eight metre composite was chosen for the statistical analysis and grade estimation of Cu. 

The objective of compositing data is to obtain an even representation of sample grades and to eliminate any 
bias due to sample length (Volume Variance).  The dominant historical sample length at Taysan is four 
metres and two metres sample length for the CHR drilling. Selected composite lengths should be multiples 
of the primary sample length to prevent over smoothing the informing data.  An important factor in 
compositing is the mining method, the critical feature is the perceived bench height, and in a large open pit 
a ten metre bench height is common.  Considering the bench height, raw sample length and to limit 
clustering of informing data in the z direction a composite length of eight metres was selected.  The most 
significant decrease in sample numbers is from two metre composites to six metre composites (Figure 55).  
The mean grade remains un-affected, and the variance is consistently reduced with longer composites. 

 
Figure 55: Composite Length Analysis - Copper 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project

Page 60 of 142 

Four metre composites were chosen for gold, silver and magnetite.  The dominant sample length for these 
elements is two metres with few four metre samples.  Use of four metre composites lead to an improvement 
of experimental variograms for Au, Ag in all domains, due to the reduction in variance associated with the 
longer composite length.  Composite length had minimal effect on the average and variance of magnetite.

14.4 Stationarity 
A domain is a three-dimensional volume that delineates the spatial limits of a single grade population, has a 
single orientation of grade continuity, and is geological homogeneous and has statistical and geostatistical 
parameters that are applicable throughout the volume (i.e. the principles of stationarity apply). Typical 
controls that can be used as the boundaries to domains include structural features, weathering, 
mineralisation halos and lithology. 

Due to grade domaining, stationarity concerns are minimised during resource estimation as each domain 
contains only one population of grade data. 

14.4.1 Domains 
Histogram and log probability plots were generated to aid the assessment of the copper distribution within 
the deposit.  

The Log Histogram (Figure 58) displays a reasonably well defined single population, however closer scrutiny 
of the data with the log probability plot highlights four potential grade populations.

The probability plot is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a data set approximates a normal 
distributed.  The data are plotted against a theoretical normal distribution in such a way that the points 
should form an approximate straight line (Figure 59). The different populations should appear as straight 
line segments of the graph separated by breaks that may take the form of sharp changes or gradual curves 
dependant on the degree of overlap between the sample distributions. 

Figure 59: Log Probability Plot (all 8m Composites) 

Below 1000 ppm (0.1%) the data forms a line representing a population of very low grade material and is 
likely the background mineralisation of the host rock.  The Geochemical boundary is at 1000 ppm with a 
second population from 3000 ppm (0.3%) to 7000 ppm (0.7%).  There are sufficient high grade samples 
above 7000 ppm to confirm these are not outliers and thus don't need capping, however there are 
insufficient samples to create a separate high grade (>7000 ppm) domain.  A review of the high (>7000 
ppm) data indicates there is strike continuity over several sections, however geological continuity is not 
assured (mineralised shapes are not consistent orientations) and the volume is relatively small, thus no 
separate domain was created. 

14.4.2 Basic Statistics 
Basic statistics report the univariate statistical characteristics for each geological domain.  The basic 
statistics are also used as a validation of the later resource estimates.  The univariate statistics have been 
generated on each of the main sub domains at Taysan. 

These statistics are based on eight metre composites.  The composites have been edited to remove partial 
composites with lengths less than four metres (less than 50 % of composite length).  No grade capping has 
been applied to the univariate statistics. 

Table 15 lists the basic statistics for the all the eight metre composites of copper within the sub domains, the 
box and whisker plot confirms the individual objects are sub domains with sufficient stationarity to be 
grouped into domains.

14.4.3 Grade Capping 

14.4.3.1 Copper 
Capping is the process of reducing the grade of the outlier sample to a value that is representative of the 
surrounding grade distribution.  Reducing the value of an outlier sample grade minimises the overestimation 
of adjacent blocks in the vicinity of an outlier grade value.  At no stage are sample grades removed from the 
database if grade capping is applied. The risks associated with the treatment of the high grades are to 
potentially over (or under) estimate the contained metal of the deposit.  Statistical parameters such as 
coefficient of variation and mean plots, metal loss, histograms and log probability plots were used as guides 
to determine the appropriate grade cap. 

The improved domaining of copper has highlighted outliers exist and capping is required, particularly in the 
low grade domains where small portions of the above 0.3% copper mineralisation occurs as discrete zones 
too small to domain as above 0.3% copper.  Copper is reasonably normally distributed (Figure 58), resulting 
in CVs well below one (Table 19) in part due to the composite lengths, only slight (99th  percentile) capping 
was deemed necessary within the high grade domains, slightly harsher capping was applied to the lower 
grade copper domains (97.5 percentile).

Gold grade is moderately skewed, in part because all gold composites within the copper mineralisation halo 
have been included in the grade capping analysis.  Very minor grade capping was deemed necessary for 
gold; the 98.5 percentile (0.405g/t Au) was selected for grade capping. 

14.4.3.2 Associated Mineral Distribution 
Associated mineralisation (gold silver and magnetite) are present at Taysan and are broadly associated with 
copper mineralisation.  Gold was capped by sub domain at 99.5 percentile, silver was capped at the 99th 
percentile for the high grade sub-domains and dominant low grade domains the remaining domains were 
capped at 98.5 percentile.  Magnetite is capped at the 97.5th percentile.

14.5 Variography 
The most important bivariate statistic used in geostatistics is the semivariogram. The experimental 
semivariogram is estimated as half the average of squared differences between data separated exactly by a 
distance vector 'h'.  Semivariogram models used in grade estimation should incorporate the main spatial 
characteristics of the underlying grade distribution at the scale at which mining is likely to occur. 

The semivariogram analysis was undertaken for individual elements within each major grade domain that 
contain sufficient data to allow a semivariogram to be generated.  Three dimensional (3-D) semivariograms 
are generated using three orthogonal principal directions.   

14.5.1 Methodology 
For each variable in each sub domain, the experimental variogram containing the clearest structure and 
greatest difference in range between each direction was selected for use in model fitting where possible.  
The variogram modelling process using variables is described as follows:

x Experimental variograms with small lags orientated down hole to aid interpretation of nugget effect 
x Omni-directional variogram to determine optimal lag distance and short range structure if not 

evident in directional components of variograms 
x Variogram maps, computing 18 directions in the reference plane and normal to the reference plane 
x Directional variogram with two directions in reference plane (down dip) oriented parallel to the 

average orientation of the wireframe models of each domain, plus variogram normal to the plane 
(across strike). 

x Repeat for gold, silver and magnetite 

Directional variograms proved difficult to model, experimental variograms were often noisy.  Where grade 
continuity was not clear, the dominant strike and dip of the domain was selected.   

Gold, silver and Magnetite directional variograms models were made possible by modelling hybrid 
variograms (combining omni directional and directional variograms). These provided better definition of 
structures without directions at close ranges and allowed definition of directions further afield.  

14.5.2 Variogram Models and Parameters 
Directional variograms were selected as best representing the grade continuity.  The copper variogram is 
defined with a low nugget (1/4 to 

1/3 of the variance) and reasonably good continuity with approximately half 
the variance reached between 25 and 168 metres total variance is reached beyond 160 metres.

The gold and silver variogram have relatively low nugget (1/5 to 
1/3 variance

), a result of 4m compositing, lack 
of defined gold specific domains and generally low grade gold mineralisation.  The final structure of the 
modelled variogram was deliberately pushed to enable as many blocks to be filled and to capture sufficient 
composites to be used in the estimation, without introducing negative weights.  Silver has the poorest 
variograms attributable to the poor sample coverage and inherent variable nature of silver mineralisation.

Quartz magnetite as an alteration features spatially larger domains; several of the copper sub-domains were 
combined to provide three areas of similar magnetite distributions, simply the high grade copper domain 
(31) is richer in magnetite, the upper (114,115 and 33) were low in magnetite, the remaining domains were 
sufficiently similar to group as one magnetite domain.

14.6 Discussion 
A global resource estimate for Taysan Copper Project was undertaken by Mining Associates Pty Ltd, using 
standard Surpac block models, grade was interpolated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) within grade wireframes 
which were based on 0.1% and 0.3% Cu grade cut-off.  The estimation was based on historical and more 
recent Asian Arc drillhole data. 

The area of interpreted mineralisation extends 1.7 km along strike and up to 0.75 km down dip (19520m N).  
The depth as defined by drilling is approximately 400m from the outcrop at elevation 150m ASL to -400m 
BSL. 

The Taysan Copper Deposit is a "Porphyry Copper" style deposit, gently dipping east (30o).  The deposit 
has a higher grade core of greater than 0.3% copper within a halo of 0.1% copper mineralisation. The post 
mineralisation porphyries are modelled as internal waste zones. 

The raw drillhole database is stored in an Access relational database.  Drill hole data spacing is variable 
though the majority of the ore body is drilled on 60 m EW x 120m NS, the region between 19400 mN and 
19700 mN is infill drilled to a 60 m x 60 m grid.  The Taysan database is connected directly to Surpac for 
data display, down-hole compositing, wireframing of homogeneous grade domains and block model 
estimation.  Surpac is used to export the data as comma delimited files for importation into Supervisor, 
which provides additional applications for statistical investigation of geological data. 

Stationarity issues were largely overcome by domaining the data.  Domains were based primarily on grade 
ranges (0.1% Cu and 0.3% Cu), with the introduction of sub-domains to control changes in spatial variation 
and specific orebody orientations. 

Copper samples are composited to 8 metres, and gold silver and magnetite samples are composited to 4 
metres to maintain the inherent variance that occurs within the copper sub-domains.  Grade capping is kept 
slight, in part due to the long composite lengths, copper high grade is capped at the 99th percentile and low 
grade copper domains are capped at the 97.5th percentile.  The associated minerals, gold silver and 
magnetite are broadly associated with copper mineralisation.  Gold is capped at 99.5% percentile by copper 
sub-domain, silver is capped to 99th percentile for the high grade copper sub-domains and dominant low 
grade copper sub-domains are capped to the 98.5 percentile.  Magnetite is capped at the 97.5th percentile 
for all sub domains. 

Variogram analysis was performed on sub-domains with sufficient samples and continuity.  Experimental 
variograms were generated and modelled; often directional variograms were able to be modelled.  Sub 
Domains that failed to neat experimental variograms were assigned parameters from a similar sub-domain. 

14.7 Grade Estimation 
Kriging techniques were used to estimate grade into parent blocks, these blocks were subsequently sub-
blocked to give accurate volumes.  The sub-blocks approach the size of the SMU. The estimation has been 
tightly constrained by the wireframes. 

Kriging techniques can be used to estimate grades into the larger parent blocks.  However, to determine 
tonnes and grade at the scale of the Selective Mining Unit ("SMU") the use of more advanced non-linear 
geostatistical approaches such as Uniform Conditioning may be required. 

14.7.1 Ordinary Kriging 
Ordinary kriging ("OK") is a robust grade estimation technique and is the main algorithm used in 
geostatistics.  The most common use of OK is to estimate the average grades into blocks at the scale of the 
available drillhole spacing.  OK is a globally unbiased estimator which produces the least error variance for 
grade estimates.   

It uses the grade continuity information from the semivariogram to estimate grades into blocks.  It is also 
able to accommodate anisotropy within the data and is able to replicate this in the block estimates.  Another

important feature of kriging is that it automatically deals with clustering of data which is important in areas 
where the data density is not uniform. 

Due to variable non-stationary issues OK was used in preference to simple kriging ("SK") as only local 
stationarity conditions are required for the OK algorithm.   

Kriging forms a sound basis for generating block grade estimates at a scale which is appropriate to the 
sample density.  If tonnes and grades are required for volumes smaller than the kriging block size then other 
more advanced non-linear techniques need to be applied. 

14.7.2 Block Model 
The Taysan block model uses regular shaped blocks measuring 60 metres by 60 metres and by 20 metres 
in height. The choice of the block size was patterned with the trend and continuity of the mineralization, 
taking into account the dominant drill pattern. The orientation of the block model is normal to the direction of 
the local grid. To accurately measure the volume of the mineralized wireframe inside each block, volume 
sub-blocking to 15 m by 15 m by 5 m was used.  Block model parameters are shown in Table 27, and block 
model attributes are shown in Table 32.  The Lidar topography file was used to exclude air blocks from the 
model estimation.  The grade estimates assigned to the sub-blocks are the grade of the parent blocks, thus 
ensuring over smoothing is reduced because block variances are honoured. 

Two identical block models were created as working models, Taysan_v4a.mdl for the estimation of gold and 
silver and Taysan_v4c.mdl for the estimation of copper and magnetite.  Once estimation and validation was 
completed the two models were imported into one model (Taysan_v4.mdl).  A compact model consisting of 
key fields was created for exportation to csv, (Taysan_v4_exp.mdl). 

14.7.2.1 Block Size 
Block size selection was based on the current drill pattern, sample density and mining method, overly small 
blocks were avoided to minimise smoothing and bias.  One block size selected was 60 mN by 60m E and 
20m RL for all models, sub-blocking was permitted to 15 mN by 15 mE by 5 m RL.  The final whittle model 
was exported at maximum resolution; all blocks at 15 mN by 15 mE by 5 m RL.

14.7.2.2 Search Parameters 
The search parameters were based on modelled variograms ranges as fitted to the experimental 
variograms.  The domains are treated as having hard boundaries, though no direct evidence exists, there is 
an association of quartz magnetite veins and potassic alteration with the higher grade copper mineralisation.  
The assumption of hard boundaries restricts the grade from influencing blocks in adjoining sub-domains 
(over smoothing). 

Informing Samples 
Selection of the informing sample is via a moving neighbourhood, moving with respect to the centroid of the 
block. The search ellipse defines a pre-selection and sample weights are defined by the variogram model.  
Large search ellipses, with respect to variogram ranges, can present distal samples with negative weights, 
however due to the sparse nature of sample points; negative kriging weights from distant samples did not 
present a problem during estimation. 

It is recommended (Vann et. al.2003) that more than 10 â€“ 12 samples be used as a minimum, particularly in 
high nugget or appreciable short-scale structures are present in the variogram, no limit is suggested for low

Page 70 of 142 

nugget variograms, as low nugget models imply little variance over short ranges, thus close composites get 
a high weighting.  18 composites was selected as the maximum, each composite consist of approximately 4 
samples. The minimum number of informing composites (three) was specified to allow blocks in poorly 
sampled peripheral portions of the domains to be estimated.  The maximum number of informing 
composites per hole was restricted to four; ensuring informing composites are spread across several drill 
holes. 

Search Radii 
Search radii are generally optimal at or near the distance that the variogram reached the sill.  The maximum 
search distances for the 0.3% copper domain was set to the variogram range, 300 metres; the 0.1% Cu 
range was set between 160 to 300 metres.   

The maximum search distances were based on the range of the modelled variograms, generally ranges for 
copper were between 160 and 300m, gold 120 to 360m; silver 70 to 200 metres and magnetite ranges are 
200 to 300 metres.

14.7.2.3 Discretisation 
Discretisation is a means of correcting the estimate for the volume variance effect. It is used to give an 
indication of the size and form of the block to the kriging system. This ensures that the estimates are a good 
representation of the block through the whole block. 5 (Y) by 5 (X) by 2 (Z) discretisation points were used 
when estimating with 10 metre composites.   

14.7.3 Block Model Attributes 
The block model stores numerous variables either calculated or directly assigned, grade variables (copper 
and magnetite, gold and silver) were estimated using ordinary kriging and associated statistics for copper

and gold are stored (average distance to informing samples, distance to nearest sample, number of 
informing samples, krige variance).  Weathering, rock_code and SG were assigned to blocks using three 
dimensional wireframe models ore digital terrain models and are consistent in all models.  The merged 
model (Taysan_v4.mdl) is the most cumbersome and all imported attributes are listed in Table 32, Table 33

14.7.4 Validation and Comparison with Previous Estimates 
Validation of the integrity of the data and geological interpretation are paramount in obtaining a robust 
resource model, due to the limited records substantiating the data this estimated is only considered as a 
significant drill defined mineral target.  Figure 65 and Figure 66 represent the mineral target at greater than 
0.1% copper and greater than 0.3% copper.

The estimate has been visually checked within Surpac to validate the block grades against drill hole data, 
composite values in both section and plan view.  Swath plots were generated of major domains, block 
model and eight metre composite data was analysed (Figure 67 and Figure 69 show two dominant copper 
domains) by Northing, northings have been selected to straddle the drill sections. 

Generally the resource estimate compares favourably with the historic copper estimates. This resource 
update has marginally increased the ore tonnes; the focus of the drill programme was to increase 
confidence in the resource model.

14.7.5 Economic Cut-off Parameters 
All resources have been stated above a block grade 0.1% Cu cut-off.  Figure 71 shows high grade and low 
tonnes proximal to the bottom of the barren tuff, the tuff has a thickness of between 0 and 50 metres over 
the Taysan copper deposit.  Maximum tonnes per bench (assumed 20m) are encountered at around 70 mRl 
and the grade steadies around 0.21% copper.  Tonnes steadily reduce from 20 Mt per 20m bench at 
approximately -90 mRl. 

14.7.6 Grade Tonnage Curves 
The grade tonnage curve (Figure 72) indicates the available tonnage is highly sensitive to cut-off grade 
between 0.1% and 0.25% Cu. Small variances in cut-off grade within this range result in large variances in 
tonnage and strip ratio.  The reported cut-off grade is stated at 0.1% Cu.

Assumptions for 'reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction' 
Assumptions for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction applied to this deposit include but 
may not be limited to the following: 

x Copper pricing at US$3.00/lb; 
x No silver or magnetite credits were considered in evaluating the resource, as per CIM Notes 2009 

(CIM, Nov 2009) 
x PEA indicated 0.1% copper cut off as economic, based on copper and gold revenue (March 2011 

NI43-101 Report)

14.7.7 Bulk Density 
Drill Core Specific Gravity:  

Bulk density is a measure of the sample inclusive of porosity.  Samples are dried to ensure moisture content 
does not affect the bulk density determinations.  The primary controls related to bulk density are: 

x Mineralogy  
x Degree of weathering and oxidation 
x Porosity or void spaces 

A total of 1429 bulk density measurements were conducted on drill core produced by the CHR since 
October 2010. Measurements are made under the supervision of the responsible geologist, using the 
waster displacement â€“ wax coated method (Lipton 2001). The weighted average bulk density of all oxidation 
states is 2.5 t/m3 as shown in Figure 73.

Figure 73: Bulk Density Summary Statistics 

The average density is high due to the proportion of hornblende quartz diorite porphyry and quartz diorite 
porphyry (HQD & QDP) samples. These two units host the majority of the Taysan Copper Deposit.  The 
overlying tuff is very light with a bulk density of 1.4 t/m3.

Density has been assigned based on rock type. Fresh rock is assigned a density of 2.6; partially oxidised 
rock a density of 2.5; oxidised material is assigned 2.4 and the ash/tuff cover a density of 1.4.  No moisture 
or bulk density measurements are recorded in the historic database.  CHR have collected 1429 density 
samples, the weighted average density of all material and oxidation states is 2.53.

14.8 Mining Factors 
No mining factors have been applied to the in situ grade estimates for mining dilution or loss as a result of 
grade control or mining process.  

The block model was exported to a comma delimited file and sent to IMC for Mineral Reserve calculations. 

14.9 Metallurgical Factors 
No metallurgical factors are applied to the in situ grade of this mineral resource. Metallurgical factors will be 
applied to the resource along with mining factors for the conversion to reserves upon completion of the 
Prefeasibility Study. 

14.10 Resource Classification 
Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralisation of the Taysan Copper Gold Project is 
classified as a resource according to the definitions from CIM Definition Standards â€“ for Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves: 

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, 
or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 
minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it 
has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 
characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 
specific geological evidence and knowledge."

For the classification of mineral resources of the Taysan Copper Gold Deposit a range of factors such as 
drill density, sample extents, geological confidence and estimation statistics were considered.  Copper 
Assays have been routinely acquired throughout the life of the project and have subsequently been proved 
reliable through CHR twin drilling programme, the historic Benguet and Newmont gold data was found to 
overcall the gold grade and was rejected by MA.  The reduced gold and silver assays along with magnetite 
determinations consequently lowers the confidence that can be placed on the gold and silver estimate as 
only Chase and CHR drill data is considered reliable. 

The resource is classified as indicated and inferred.  Resource categories are primarily based on the 
dominant commodity; copper, there is reasonable prospect for economic extraction based on copper alone. 
Accessory minerals are less well understood due to a combination of less supporting data and poorer 
geological understanding of the gold and silver. Although magnetite has limited supporting data the 
magnetite model is well understood.  The gold, silver and magnetite resource are considered by-products 
within the copper resource.   

Indicated Resource 

The indicated mineral resource is defined by detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 
gathered from drill holes spaced close enough to allow confident interpretation of the geological framework 
and to reasonably assume the continuity of mineralization.  Groups of blocks with a kriging variance of less 
than 0.4 for copper with a minimum of 5 informing samples, in regions drilled on 120m sections with drill 
centres spaced 60m along section and must have supporting drill holes on intermediate 60m sections. 

Inferred Resources 

The Inferred Mineral Resource is defined as regions for which quantity and grade is estimated on the basis 
of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 77 of 142 

continuity.  Such regions are defined by drill spacing of approximately 120 x 120m centres and krige 
variance of greater than 0.4. 

Geological continuity can be assumed as the geological model accounts for gold-silver enrichment and 
general quartz-magnetite alteration, further drilling specifically targeting poorly defined gold silver and 
magnetite resources are planned for completion before the end of the 2011. 

14.10.1 Mineral Resource Statement 
The CHR drilling programme conducted during 2010-2011 at the Taysan Copper Deposit has enhanced the 
significant copper deposit that exists within the Taysan Project.  The CHR drill programme has focused on 
the central portion of the ore body, to develop confidence in a suitably large copper resource and define the 
associated gold, silver and magnetite potential. 

MA created the copper mineral resource estimate from first principals using all historic and recent CHR drill 
data.  The gold resource is based on all recent CHR drilling, Chase and Kumakata historic data. The silver 
resource is based on recent CHR drill data and Kumakata drill data, only recent CHR drilling has magnetite 
data.   

The approach to the resource model consisted analysis of all drill data, wireframing in section; confirmation 
and review in flitch slices; grouping the wireframes into sub-domains of similar orientation and grade ranges; 
tagging and statistical analysis of the drill intercepts by domain; variography; analysing associated metals 
within the copper domains; estimation using Ordinary Kriging of copper, gold, silver and magnetite into a 
block model; analysis and validation guided by geology and alteration, informing data, statistical measures 
and check reporting.   

MA's updated mineral resource estimate has defined an indicated resource of 411 Mt at an average grade 
of 0.27% copper, 0.10 g/t gold, 0.92 g/t silver and 3.3% magnetite for 2,410 Mlb of contained copper, 1.27 
Moz contained gold, 12.19 Moz contained silver and 13.4 Mt of contained magnetite. In additional an 
inferred resource of 542 Mt at an average grade of 0.18% copper, 0.07 g/t gold, 0.47g/t silver and 2.8% 
magnetite for 2,190 M lbs of contained copper, 1.24 Moz contained gold, 8.24 Moz contained silver and 
15.4 Mt contained magnetite is defined.  A cut-off grade of 0.1% copper was applied to for all reported 
resource blocks.

Within the defined copper resource are several associated accessory metals, gold, silver and magnetite. 
They were not routinely determined in the historic data.  The gold estimate is an improvement on previous 
regression based estimates; and silver and magnetite have not been estimated previously. All elements are 
estimated using ordinary kriging. The company is currently drilling the copper, gold, silver and magnetite 
resource to obtain sufficient data to improve confidence in the resource.  

Notes to accompany the Taysan Inferred Resource Estimate:  
x The tenement holder is Asian Arc Mining Resources Incorporated ("Asian Arc").  Crazy Horse 

Resources Inc (CHR) currently owns 100% of Asian Arc.  
x Resource estimate is based on historical drillholes and Asian Arc holes to June 30th 2011 consisting 

of 193 historical holes (152 core and 41 percussion) and 45 Asian Arc (core) holes totalling 64,188 
metres (59,736 core metres and 4,452 percussion metres).  The 1983 TCI holes were rejected 
outright (2 holes totalling 328 metres) 

x MA did not conduct any audit of the data or sample collection of the historic drilling. Asian Arc drilled 
six twin holes and located 39 historic drill holes in the field. The findings validate the historic drill 
hole database. 

x MA has reviewed the Asian Arc procedures and visited site twice during the course of the Asian Arc 
drill programme.

x There is no available QA/QC information (sample duplicates, blanks, drill core or certified reference 
materials) for the historical drilling data.  Drilling completed by Asian Arc undergoes internal QA/QC, 
including the submission of certified reference material, duplicates and blanks. The average grade 
for drilling completed by Asian Arc supports the average grade for the historical drilling data within 
the mineralised copper domains. 

x All copper drilling data with the exception of two TCI holes were used in the estimation of the copper 
resource (1983 TY-007 and TY-008). 

x Only Chase, Kumakata and Asian Arc gold assays were used for the estimation of the gold 
resource. 

x Only Kumakata and Asian Arc silver assays were used for the estimate of the silver resource.  
Kumakata and Asian Arc where the only drill programmes tested for silver. 

x Asian Arc recorded magnetic susceptibility readings of pulverised two metre samples for holes 
CZT001 to CZT042. Magnetite regression was determined from 107 Davis Tube Test samples. 

x Composite lengths and high grade cuts based on spatial distribution and probability plots were 
applied as follows, 

o Copper assay data was composited to 8 metres down hole within geological domains; 
giving 4,750 informing samples from 165 drillholes; a copper grade cap was applied 
informing composites 99th percentile in high copper domains and 97.5th percentile in the 
lower grade domains. 

o Gold assays were composited to four metres down hole within copper domains and were 
capped at the 99.5th percentile 

o Silver assays were composited to four metres down hole within copper domains and were 
capped at 99th percentile or the 98.5th percentile. 

o Magnetite content correlates to the magnetic susceptibility of the pulps, (R2=0.9733). 
Magnetite% = 0.1639 x MagSus reading + 0.8007 based on 107 Davis Tube Tests.  The 
regression was applied to all magnetite susceptibility readings (8239 readings of one kg 
pulp bags representing 2 metre samples). Magnetite % results were composited to four 
metres down hole within in copper domains and capped to 97.5th percentile. 

x Block model block sizes selection of XYZ 60 x 60 x 20m is based on Â½ to 1 times the drill hole 
spacing. Sub-blocking to 15 x15 x 5m for model volumes. Screened for overlying tuff and 
topography by sub-block. 

x Geological resource is constrained by sub-block with 18 wireframes in two grade domains based on 
lithology, structure, alteration, and a minimum sample grade of 0.1% Cu and 0.3% Cu, includes 
minor internal dilution. Each sub-block can only belong to one domain. 

x Routine bulk density measurements show some variation with an average bulk density across all 
oxidation states of 2.53. The fresh material has a bulk density of 2.6 applied; partially weathered 
material was assigned a bulk density of 2.5.  Oxide has an applied bulk density of 2.4, and the 
overlying tuff a bulk density 1.4. 

x Grade was interpolated into a constrained block model by domain using ordinary krige techniques. 
Kriging parameters are derived from a study of variography by domain.  The block mode was 
validated by statistical and visual comparison of data and estimated grades and by alternate 
estimation methods  

x Resources have been classified as Indicated and Inferred.  Resource classification is based on 
confidence in grade continuity and geological models of the primary commodity (Cu).  The indicated 
resource has been drilled on 120 x 120 drill sections with significant infill drilling on section to 60m 
centres, minor infill drilling on intermediate sections. The majority of blocks must have a krige 
variance less than 0.4.  The inferred resource is drilled on 120 x 120 m pattern and the majority of 
blocks have a krige variance greater than 0.4. 

x Lower cut off grade of 0.1% copper was applied to blocks in reporting the resource estimates.

14.10.2 Factors Potentially Affecting Materiality of Resources  
Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The 
following factors could potentially impact on the materiality of the mineral resource estimate: 

x The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, 
title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

x MA did not conduct any audit of data or sample collection procedures of the historic drilling, no 
supporting document were available.  CHR drilled six twin holes to test the validity of the historic 
drill hole database, 39 historic drill collars were identified in the field as per drill hole recorded collar 
locations. 

x A thorough search, as recommended by MA (11 March Report) by site failed to locate details of the 
metallurgical holes CT021 to CT026, therefore these holes have not been used in the definition of 
the resource. 

x The oxidation profile was digitised on section and wire framed as a digital terrain model.  The DTM 
was used to constrain the block model. 

x Density has been assigned based on oxidation state. The fresh material has a bulk density of 2.6 
applied; partially weathered material was assigned a bulk density of 2.5.  Oxide has an applied bulk 
density of 2.4, and the overlying tuff a bulk density 1.4. 

x The portion of the Taysan copper gold project that have been classified as an Inferred resource, 
cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. 

x Historic and recent CHR data was used in the definition of the copper estimate. Only Chase, 
Kumakata and CHR gold assays were directly used for the estimation of the gold resource. Only 
Kumakata and Asian Arc drill results were used in the silver estimate. Only Asian Arc drill results 
were used in the magnetite estimate. 

14.10.3 Discussion 
A portion of the copper resource is sufficiently well supported to classify as indicated. The associated 
minerals within this same tonnage are supported by less data as a number of previous drill programs have 
either no data for the associated minerals or the data that was collected was rejected by MA as biased due 
to poor sampling or analytical practises. That said, CHR still has sufficient data to inform all elements in the 
indicated resource tonnage.  

MA notes the following CIM guidance on this matter, extracted from "Questions resulting from CSA-CIM 
Committee Meetings (April 14, 2008 - edited November 30, 2009)" 

 "the Committees' sense is that if the project was economic on the basis of gold data alone, many QPs 
would classify the project as an Indicated Mineral Resource. If the silver assays were required to make 
the project economic, some QPs would refuse to classify the estimate until more sampling for silver was 
completed or they would classify the estimate as an Inferred Mineral Resource because of the lack of 
confidence in the silver data.  In all cases, the QPs were of the opinion that, in the report, the QP must 
make very clear the status of both sets of data so that there can be no confusion created in the mind of 
the reader. Most felt that the best way to do this was to explain that silver is present in the deposit, 
report the grade if material to the deposit but states that insufficient information is available to estimate 
a grade with the required confidence." ï¿½

CHR independent mining consultants IMC have carried out a whittle pit optimisation based on copper 
revenues only, excluding revenues from the Accessory Minerals. The results clearly show that the project is 
viable on copper alone, thus meeting the criteria that copper is the primary consideration and driver of the 
project. If the accessory minerals were to be critical in the optimisation, then MA would have classified the 
whole resource inferred. 

The copper resource is well defined in the indicated portion and MA is confident that more drilling will not 
grossly affect the tonnes and grade or geological models supporting the copper resource. In terms of the 
other commodities, magnetite requires more data to inform the inferred portions of the magnetite model.

Page 80 of 142 

The emplacement model for magnetite is well understood as it is visibly identifiable as quartz-magnetite 
alteration, and reduces in intensity where the copper gold and silver mineralisation drops off in grade. Gold 
and silver are spatially correlated with the footwall of the high grade copper mineralisation and as such, Am 
is confident in the location of the higher grade gold and silver, however gold and silver are inherently more 
variable than copper. The portions of the gold and silver resource which have low confidence are still 
confined to the inferred resource, It is the opinion of MA that more dill data will significantly raise the gold 
and silver estimate in the poorly drilled areas. In addition, there may be higher grade copper, gold, silver 
and magnetite within the poorly defined down dip in extents, as found up dip in the suitably drilled portions.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
Mineral reserves have not been estimated for the Taysan project.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature, and is based on inferred mineral resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 
categorized as mineral reserves. 

Mineral reserves are expected to be estimated in the Definitive Feasibility Study in 2012.  

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Introduction 
The following preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") of an open pit mining operation at Taysan has 
been extracted from the Scoping Study Report compiled and reviewed by AMEC Minproc It is a revision of 
the PEA described in the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 report and has been updated in this report to reflect the 
updated mineral resource with the addition of silver and magnetite.

Project coordination and communication was the responsibility of Grahame Binks, Senior Study Manager for 
AMEC Minproc.  CHR has provided much of the information regarding the project property situation as well 
as background information on the property. Where possible, AMEC Minproc has confirmed information 
provided by CHZ or previous authors by comparison against other data sources or by field observation. 
Where checks and confirmations are not possible, AMEC Minproc has assumed that all information supplied 
is complete and reliable within normally accepted limits of error. During the normal course of the work, we 
have not discovered any reason to doubt that assumption.  AMEC Minproc has not specifically reviewed or 
audited the property ownership documents at Taysan.  AMEC Minproc has relied on the opinion of 
Philippine legal counsel Fortun Narvasa & Salazar provided in the Due Diligence report dated 28 February 
2011 to CHR outlining the property ownership at Taysan and signed by R. C. Salazar III which has been 
viewed by AMEC Minproc.

As noted in Table 39 various consultants have provided significant input into this report. AMEC Minproc has 
not specifically reviewed nor audited the documented information other than for consistency in reporting. 

The PEA is preliminary in nature, and is partially based on inferred mineral resources that are considered 
too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to 
be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized.

CHR has included grid power within this study for the first four years of production at US$0.128/kWh 
followed by owner built coal power costs of US$0.060/kWh for years 5 â€“ 25 on the basis of data provided by 
GHD Engineering. 

Owner operator mining costs were built up from first principles from scoping level quotes and with scoping 
level assumptions of waste dump locations and haul roads. 

In absence of engineering studies or data, "industry experience" or usage rates or percentages were 
factored in to the estimate capital and operating costs.

16.1.2 Scoping Study Accuracy 
The Scoping Study accuracy for the estimates of capital costs and operating costs was defined at Â± 40% for 
mining and process plant capital costs and infrastructure costs.  The mining and process operating costs 
are at a higher level of accuracy, Â± 25% as a result of recent budget vendor enquiries for consumables.  The 
cost estimate data is pertinent to Q4 2010. 

16.1.3 Scope of the Report 
This report details the findings of the Scoping Study for the Taysan Copper Gold Project. The Scoping 
Study reviews the following: 

x The geology, mineralisation styles and geological models displayed on the tenements; 
x The historical exploration carried out on the Project areas and the results from this exploration 

including identification of future exploration target areas 
x The historical drilling and various studies completed by the various tenement holders 
x All metallurgical testwork and other geotechnical and engineering studies completed on the project 

area by CHR and other groups 
x The proposed work programme for the project. 

16.2 Mining Studies 
IMC Mining Group Pty Ltd (IMC) were engaged to complete the mining aspects of the Taysan Copper-Gold 
Scoping Study.   

The resource model used in the mining study was completed by Mining Associates in July 2011 and 
included Indicated and Inferred mineral resources as described earlier in this report. 

The Taysan mining study has not yet been restricted by a resource classification field in the resource model.  
Inferred resources are included in the PEA mining studies. 

16.3 Mining Method 
The Taysan orebody is planned to be mined by conventional open pit bulk mining methods utilising drill and 
blast, large hydraulic excavators/shovels and a fleet of off-road dump trucks to haul the material to either the 
mill or the waste rock dump.  The Taysan mine will be considered a large scale mine in the Philippines. 

16.4 Geotechnical 
Asian Arc Mining Resources Incorporated commissioned Resource Development Consultants Ltd (RDCL) 
to carry out a "confirmatory" scoping level geotechnical study of the proposed open pit, waste dump and 
plant site foundations for the Taysan Copper-Gold Project, Batangas Province, Southern Luzon, Philippines. 

This study is based on existing information, a walkover of the deposit and review of previous exploration 
drilling.   

The Taysan deposit is covered by pyroclastics deposits (Taal Tuff), from 0 to 50 m thick, and overlying the 
mineralised unit comprising an intrusive hornblende diorite. Potassic (K), Sericite-chlorite-carbonate (SCC), 
and Quartz-magnetite (QMt) stockwork alteration (associated with the ore) is found associated with 
mineralisation. 

A number of faults are interpreted to intersect the project area, none of which are considered active.   The 
East Luzon Trench is relatively close and a number of large faults are close to the study area.  A site 
specific seismic study should be undertaken due to the proximity of significant regional structures.

16.4.1 Open Pit  
A substantial open pit is considered feasible for the Taysan project.  Indicative overall slope angles for the 
pit are shown in the following Table 41.  RDCL believe this could improve with better understanding of the 
geotechnical conditions. 

Table 41: Pit Slope Design Guidelines 
All Domains Weathered/Altered Rock Fresh Rock 
Bench Height 15 m 20 m 
Bench Slope 55Â° 60Â° 
Bern Width 7.5 m 8 m 
Inter-ramp Slope 40Â° 49Â° 
Bench Height 15 m 20 m 

The geotechnical constraints in developing the Taysan open pit are likely to be: 
x Geological structures (dips generally not known) intersecting the pit wall with the potential to 

generate kinematic failures 
x Alteration within pit walls and associated zones of "lower strength" rock mass 
x Generally "Poor" rock mass conditions 
x Uncertainties in design can be adequately managed through: 
x Adopting an overall slope as proposed.  This is a fairly conservative position designed to promote 

the long term stability of the wall. 
x Drilling, downhole testing and mapping to provide: 

o Further information on the likelihood and existence of any faults/structures within the pit 
walls 

o Greater understanding of influence of alteration on overall rock mass strength and 
x Assessment of groundwater pressures and conductivity in more detail. 

16.4.2 Waste Dumps 
Waste management is considered relatively straight forward with "good" foundation conditions and "flat" 
topography (for external stability).  For internal stability the dump will need to be zoned with "good" quality 
waste placed on the outside, and "poor" quality waste placed in the middle.  This is to ensure stability 
particularly if any height is envisaged, and also for long term slop performance. 

Drilling indicates that the area is underlain by a blanket of Tuff ranging from 15-20 m in the south, thickening 
to 57 m in the north and west of the proposed waste dump area.  The tuff unit is underlain by generally 
massive, competent diorite. 

We consider that preparation of foundations for the waste dump can be completed without undue 
geotechnical constraints.   

It is likely that heavily altered rock will perform differently over the long term compared to "less" altered rock.  
The waste dump design will need to account for difference in performance.  In general we recommend: 

x A waste model should be developed for integration with the mine production schedule.  The model 
should indicate "good" and "poor" quality waste based on rock strength, alteration and engineering 
characteristics which can be investigated during the project studies and from observation during 
operation. 

x The dump is zoned with "good" quality material on the outside, and "poor" quality material in the 
inner part of the dump.  This is to help ensure the interior stability of the structure of any height is 
developed in the dump, and for the long term performance of dump slopes. 

x We recommend the landform be designed to improve the amenity of the local area.  The structure 
will comprise a large scale earthmoving exercise.  Proper engineering and consideration may allow 
such things as terraced housing, rice fields or even a golf course.

16.4.3 Plant Site 
The proposed Process Plant will be founded in Taal Tuff. We consider that preparation of foundations for 
the Plant Site can be completed without undue geotechnical constraints.  We recommend: 

x Foundations are stripped of all organic material, topsoil and soft soils. 
x Mass foundations are most likely for "heavy and vibrating" equipment, and 
x Pad or strip foundations for most other structures 
x Tanks are likely to be found directly in surface stripped of any organic or loose materials. 

16.4.4 Additional Geotechnical Investigations 
Additional investigations comprising predominantly for the Open Pit drilling, laboratory testing of rock and 
downhole groundwater testing is required for the open pit; and drilling to test foundations within the waste 
and plant site areas is required. 

Testing requirements are considered to be "normal" and largely to confirm the assumptions made to date.  
No excessive or overly complicated investigations are envisaged. 

16.5 Pit Optimisation 
The pit optimisation process is essentially a mechanism for outlining pit shells that are economic at given 
financial parameters. The pit shells so developed honour criteria established for slope constraints. 

16.5.1 Mine Optimisation Parameters 
A summary of the key modifying factors that were applied to derive the potential economic material in the pit 
optimisation is shown in Table 42. 

A mine gate revenue, or net smelter return, was calculated to estimate the mining revenue from copper, 
gold, silver and magnetite sales whilst allowing for downstream costs and royalties between the mine and 
the point of sale.  It should be noted that the mine gate revenue for gold and silver is variable based on the 
grade of these elements in the concentrate which is in turn based on the head grade delivered to the mill.  It 
follows, therefore, that the mine gate revenue for gold and silver varies on a block by block basis in the 
optimisation which precluded the use of a singular copper equivalence formula. 

Copper, gold, silver and magnetite revenues have been considered in the pit optimisation.

Mine Gate Revenue - Au US$/tr. oz 834 
Mine Gate Revenue â€“ Ag US$/tr .oz 11.2 
Mine Gate Revenue â€“ Magnetite US$/t 93.6 

16.5.2 Cut-off Grade 
A cash-flow approach rather than a pre-determined cut-off grade was applied in the Taysan Pit 
Optimisations to define ore and waste.  Ore was selected by comparing the cash flow (including copper, 
gold, silver and magnetite revenue) which would be produced by processing a block and the cash flow 
which would be produced by mining the same block as waste. If the cash flow from processing the block 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 86 of 142 

was higher, then the block was treated as ore. If not, the block was treated as waste â€“ this approach is 
consistent with a metal equivalence formula.   

On a copper grade basis, the marginal cut-off grade at Taysan is sensitive to changes in processing cost, 
metal price, processing recovery and playability of the metal in the final concentrate.  The impact on the 
planning reserves due to changes in the cut-off grade are shown by the six optimisation options shown in 
Table 43 and Table 44. 

The recovered cut-off grade (rather than the in-situ cut-off grade) is typically more meaningful when 
recoveries vary with the head grade to the mill as is the case at Taysan.  The marginal cut-off grade at 
Taysan on a recovered copper grade basis is 0.08% (or 0.09% on an in-situ copper grade basis).   

It should be noted that this cut-off is lower than the cut off grade used in the block model to define the 
mineral resource.  It follows, therefore, that the effective cut off grade applied in the mining studies is 
equivalent to 0.10% Cu in-situ (or 0.09% Cu recovered).    

16.5.3 Ore Loss and Dilution 
A mining loss of 2.5% was applied to the ore tonnes to estimate the planning reserves to account for mining 
recovery, poorly assigned trucks, blast movement and geological loss. 

No dilution has been applied in the mining schedule due to low marginal cut off grade used and the massive 
and low grade nature of the Taysan porphyry orebody.  Dilution is not expected to be a significant issue at 
Taysan and in IMC's opinion this has been effectively accounted for in the block model due to the large 
(60mx60mx20m) panel sizes and 8m sample composites used to estimate the block average grade. 

16.5.4 Optimisation Summary 
A number of optimisation scenarios were run to assess the impact of various copper price and processing 
cost scenarios on the Taysan pit volume and present value.  The cost of power delivered to the mill is the 
single largest cost driver for the processing cost which, in turn, has a direct impact on the marginal cut-off 
grade.   

Three processing cost options were considered at $2.5/lb and $3.0/lb copper: 

1. Total processing post of $4.42/t ($0.06/kWh from year 1+) 
2. Total processing post of $6.07/t ($0.128/kWh year 1-4) and $4.42/t ($0.06/kWh from year 5+)  
3. Total processing post of $6.07/t ($0.128/kWh from year 1+) 

It should be noted that for the purposes of the pit optimisation the processing cost includes the following: 

1. Cost of processing the ore ($3.49/t); 
2. General and administration costs ($0.63/t); 
3. Sustaining Capex for Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") lifts and other miscellaneous items ($0.20/t), 

and 
4. Grade control costs ($0.02/t). 

The six options with varying copper prices and processing costs were assessed in the pit optimisation and 
the results are shown in Table 43 and Table 44. 

The results from the pit optimisation demonstrate that the Taysan project can be mined by open cut 
methods and generally forms a large pit of between 1.2B to 1.4B total tonnes (ore plus waste).  The overall 
pit size is sensitive to changes in the copper price and processing cost as shown by the smaller pit size 
(964Mt) in the Option 3 optimisation.  This reduction in pit size is due to the combined impact of a higher 
processing cost ($6.07/t) and a lower copper price ($2.5/lb) on the marginal cut off grade.  It remains 
important for the Taysan project to operate at a marginal cut off grade between 0.10% and 0.15% Cu to 
ensure a balance is maintained between the overall mine life and the project strip ratio.

The Option 5 pit optimisation was chosen as the preferred case for the PEA as this took into account the 
variable power cost and the $3.0/lb base case copper price as per the project wide assumptions.  Detailed 
designs were based on the interim pit shells from the Option 5 optimisation.

16.5.5 Interim Pit Shells for Mine Design 
A number of interim pit shells have been proposed to provide guidance for the detailed mine designs and 
mining schedules.  These pit shells are shown in plan view (local grid) in Figure 76 and in cross-section in 
Figure 77 and Figure 78.

Based on the $4.42/t processing cost pit optimisation at $3.0/lb copper (Option 5), the pit shells shown in 
Figure 77 to Figure 78 were chosen for detailed designs and scheduling.  Two additional pit stages were 
added to improve the mine production schedule and help defer waste movement (Pit Shell 1 and 16 were 
also designed). 

The quantities contained within the pit designs (based on these optimised shells) are shown in Table 45.

16.6 Pit Designs and Stages 
In total, five pit stages have been designed based on the results of the pit optimisation; Stages 1 to 5.  In 
terms of contained ore, the 5 pit stages are notionally equivalent to 2 year, 4 year, 10 year, 17 year and 25 
year pits based on a 30 Mtpa milling rate. 

The pit design to Whittle shell reconciliation is shown in Table 45.  It is generally quite simple to follow the 
optimised pit shells at Taysan due to the favourable geometry of the ore body. The pit designs for the 5 
stages are shown in plan view in Figure 79 and in cross-section in Figure 80 and Figure 81.

The five pit stages have been designed on the basis of optimised pit shells to improve the project value.  
Stage 1, 2 and 3 combined correspond roughly to a 10 year pit whilst Stage 4 and 5 add an additional 15 
years to the mine life. 

The five stages have been designed with independent access ramps to allow for multiple stages to be 
mined at any time and to allow sufficient working areas for the mining fleet and to smooth out total 
movement requirements.   

The 10 year pit (Stage 1, 2 and 3) has higher copper grades and a significantly lower strip ratio than the 
final two stages as shown in Figure 82 and Figure 83.

16.7 Waste Dumps 
Only a limited amount of information was available regarding the acid rock drainage potential of the waste 
rock at Taysan.  It is expected that the waste rock will generally have a low potential for acid rock drainage 
in the barren waste zones whilst the mineralised waste will be potentially acid forming ("PAF"). 

Waste rock from the Taysan pit will be either dumped in the external waste rock dump south of the plant site 
or used to construct the TSF embankments.  It is expected that the mining fleet will haul waste rock from the 
mine to the TSF embankments, as there is very little difference in haulage distance between the external 
waste dump and the TSF embankment. 

Approximately 25% of the waste from the Stage 1 and Stage 2 pits is estimated to be used for TSF 
construction.

16.8.2 Material Movement 
The following figures (Figure 85 and Figure 86) show the scheduled material movement by stage.  The pre-
stripping of the subsequent stages is based on the requirement to have exposed enough ore before the 
completion of the previous stage to ensure a steady supply of ore to the mill whilst balancing total 
movement requirements. 

The mining schedule is characterised by an upfront 4 year period of low strip ratios and higher copper, gold, 
silver and magnetite grades.  Another grade peak is expected from Year 8 to 11 as the high grade ore in the 
lower parts of the 10 Year pit is mined.

16.8.3 Ore Delivered to the Mill 
The ore processing schedule is very similar to the mining schedule as very limited low grade stockpiling is 
expected at Taysan.  The ore mined in the pre-production period (Month 1 to Month 12) will be processed in 
Year 1.   

The material processed and associated grades are shown graphically in Figure 87 to Figure 91 and in more 
detail in Table 47 and Table 48.

The Taysan project has been estimated to operate 362 days per year on a 22 hour per day roster (3 panels 
working 2 x 11 hr shifts per day). 

The Taysan project will benefit from being only a two hour drive from Manila in terms of support from the 
equipment suppliers, availability of skilled labour and access to spare parts with minimal downtime 
compared to other parts of the Philippines where access is more difficult. 

The operating time estimate for the primary fleet is shown in Table 49.

16.9.2 Equipment Productivity 
The productivity estimates of the loading and hauling equipment has been developed on the basis of 
empirical estimates together with haulage simulations to determine the truck productivity as shown in Table 
50.  

The production rate for the primary truck fleet has been estimated from simulations carried out for each pit 
stage.  The productivity of the haulage fleet varies with depth and material type due to changes in haul 
distance, gradient and material density. 

Each pit stage had a unique haul route profile to the ROM pad and to the waste dump.  The results from the 
truck simulations were used to determine the average loaded and empty travelling speeds per year for each 
of the material destinations, which in turn was used to estimate the required number of trucks.

16.9.3 Mining Fleet  
The estimated mining equipment fleet requirement for Taysan is shown in Table 51.  The mining fleet is 
initially planned to consist of four 250t excavators and one 200t excavator for waste and ore mining.  A fleet 
of 140 tonne capacity off-road dump trucks have been planned as the primary truck fleet. 

The peak fleet size for Taysan is planned to occur in Year 12 as the mining development schedule moves 
into the higher strip ratio Stages 4 and 5.  At the peak, six excavators and 52 trucks are estimated to be 
required to maintain feed to the plant and move the required waste quantities to the waste dump and TSF 
construction site.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
This is an abridged version of the Metallurgical Development report submitted by Alphrai Pty Ltd. An 
assessment of the basic metallurgical characteristics and the flotation response of Taysan ore were carried 
out by Chase Minerals (Philippines) Corporation in 1995. In 2010, scout test work was initiated by CHR on a 
selection of fresh ore samples to confirm the process response observed during the 1995 test work as well 
as to assess the potential performance variability. Although the CHR test work results generally confirmed 
the amenability of the Taysan ore to beneficiation by means of flotation, the findings nevertheless indicated 
a broader variability in the process response that was not evident in the outcome of the 1995 test work. 

The 1995 test work was performed using bulk composites with the constituent samples being selected from 
a number of different drill holes. This bulking of the individual samples had averaged the indicated process 
response of the ore. Conversely, the 2010 test work by CHR was carried out using continuous intercept 
samples from discrete drill holes so as to identify the process response at particular locations throughout the 
deposit and to therefore provide an initial indication of the process variability that might be anticipated in the 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 102 of 142 

operating environment. The CHR test work did confirm that a greater variability in the response output might 
indeed be anticipated compared to that indicated by the 1995 data although the average response would 
likely be similar in the longer term. 

Although the 2010 flotation test work on the individual drill hole composites did exhibit a greater degree of 
variability than did the 1995 bulk samples, the general trend of the results was similar. The recovery of 
copper to the final concentrate varied directly with the copper grade of the ore, albeit within the scope of a 
broad operating envelope. On average, copper recoveries in excess of 90% would be anticipated for head 
grades above 0.3% Cu into a final concentrate assaying circa 25% Cu to 27% Cu. 

Gold and silver will contribute to the product revenue stream, although to only a minor extent. The test 
results indicated that a strong correlation existed between the Cu:Au assay ratio in the feed and that in the 
concentrate. When the gold content in the feed was high in relative terms at a given copper assay, then the 
gold in the concentrate was likewise high â€“ and vice versa.  Although the gold content of the ore is not high 
overall, the initial test work result suggest that a gold assay of circa 7 g/t Au will ensue on average in a 
commercial grade copper concentrate assaying of the order of 25% Cu to 27% Cu. The test work data 
similarly indicate that a silver assay of approximately 80 g/t Ag would also be present in the same 
concentrate product. 

The comminution characteristics of the 1995 and 2010 samples were quite consistent indicating that the 
Taysan ore would be regarded as being of only moderate hardness from a comminution perspective so that 
the grinding power requirements would not be overly onerous. The abrasivity of the ore was however quite 
high such that from an operating perspective, a high wear rate would be anticipated for grinding media, 
equipment liners and general wear parts. 

17.1 Magnetite Recovery 
One of the recommendations of the 11 March 2011 NI43-101 report was to test for the potential to produce 
magnetite concentrate due to the apparent high magnetite content of the mineralization. Scout magnetic 
separation test work was carried in order to ascertain the potential for the production of a magnetite 
concentrate. Although the assessment was of a preliminary nature, the response of the ore did suggest that 
the production of a magnetite concentrate from flotation circuit tailings would represent a reasonable 
process option from the technical perspective. Regrinding of a magnetic rougher product would be required 
in order to generate sufficient liberation of the magnetite to produce a high grade magnetic concentrate in a 
subsequent cleaning sequence. 

It was recommended Davis Tube testing ("DTR") of drill core samples to determine the resources and grade 
variations and calibration of the magnetic susceptibility of drill core with the DTR results to minimise the 
DTR testing over the resource. These recommendations were conducted with DTR performed on 107 pulp 
samples from 12 drill holes.  Testing was preliminary in nature and focused upon determination of the total 
recoverable level of magnetite and the impact of magnetic intensity variation from 600 to 3,000 gauss on six 
composited samples as best representing the ore body. 

Magnetite recovery from the Taysan resource was estimated from: 

1. Davis Tube Recovery (DTR) data at various magnetic intensities conducted on samples with a P80 
feed size of approximately 38 Âµm. 

2. Industry test data to allow a calibration between SiO2, magnetite recovery and grind size. 
3. An offset of DTR recoveries to simulate a 20 Âµm P80 feed grind with a magnetite concentrate 

containing 2.5% SiO2 to 2.0% SiO2. 
4. Generation of a relation between magnetite recovery and feed magnetite content at a 20 Âµm P80 

feed grind with a magnetite concentrate containing 2.5.% SiO2 to 2.5.% SiO2. 
5. Application of this relation to a set of 8,238 magnetite values calculated from magnetic susceptibility 

readings. 

The limited evaluation of magnetite recovery was conducted at ALS as mentioned above were conducted at 
a reported feed size of 38 Âµm and represented rougher type magnetic separation conditions. 

The magnetite recovery, Rmag was calculated with the standard formula:

where cmag is the magnetite grade of the Davis Tube concentrate and fmag is the magnetite grade of the 
Davis Tube feed sample. 

Figure 92 shows the magnetite grade versus magnetite recovery for samples of various feed grades, tested 
under various magnetic intensities. 

Samples TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 produced magnetite recoveries of up to 65% at 
relatively concentrate grades of approximately 90% magnetite. Each showed the typical trend of increasing 
magnetite recovery and decreasing concentrate magnetite grade with increasing magnetic intensity.  

Sample TayPhyC1 produced an anomalous result with a lower quality concentrate largely independent of 
magnetic intensity. 

Based on the analysis of the preliminary Davis Tube test results a magnetite recovery of 52% for magnetite 
for the life of mine has been determined.  This determination is preliminary and an ongoing program of test 
work is currently underway to evaluate the recovery improvement and concentrate upgrade potential for the 
magnetite.

Considering the elevated concentrate TiO2 grade the Davis Tube concentrates were evaluated from a 
perspective of suitability to produce a concentrate for the heavy media market. Figure 94 shows the SiO2 
concentrate grade versus magnetite recovery for the samples tested under various magnetic intensities. 

Samples TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 showed the typical trend of decreasing SiO2 content in 
concentrate with decreasing magnetic intensity. At 600 Gauss these samples achieved a Davis Tube 
concentrate SiO2 grade varying between 4% and 5%. Although above a typical heavy media specification of 
between 4% SiO2 and 5% SiO2 there is a high probability that specifications can be met through finer 
grinding and cleaning stages and being tested in the current test work program. Sample TayPhyC1 
produced an anomalous result with high SiO2 content in the concentrate largely independent of magnetic 
intensity.

Figure 94: Davis Tube Magnetite Recovery Versus Concentrate SiO2 Grade 

Figure 95 details a typical effect of reducing grind size on the SiO2 grade in magnetite concentrate from 
Davis Tube tests. The trend line for Taysan indicates that to achieve a SiO2 grade in magnetite concentrate 
of 3% at a 20 Âµm grind the SiO2 grade at the test grind of 38 Âµm will need to be 5.9% SiO2 or less. Samples 
TayArgC1, TayK1C1, TayK2C1, TayK3C1 all match this criterion however, sample TayPhyC1 does not.

17.2.2 Process and Equipment Selection 
Sources of Information 

Specific data for the development of the Taysan process design was sourced from: 
x Metcon and Ammtec laboratory test work 
x Chase Minerals Corporation Optimet Test Work Report 95034 (December 1995) 
x AMEC Minproc In-House database 
x Preliminary Vendor and Catalogue Data 

The process design criteria forms the basis for the design of the processing facilities and required site 
services.  The process mass balance allows specification of equipment capacity.  The mass balance also 
allows development of operating requirements such as power, water and reagents.  There is a detailed 
mechanical equipment list developed for the scoping study covering the following components. 

17.2.3 Primary Crushing 
The crusher circuit is designed based on 75% availability and 90% utilisation equating to an operating 
utilisation of 67.5%.  To meet the design mill throughput of 30 Mt/a, a total crusher circuit throughput of 
5,074 t/h is required. The circuit consists of two parallel lines of 62 x 75 Metso gyratory crushers, each 
processing half the throughput.  Gyratory crushers have been selected to minimise capital cost compared to 
the requirement for 4 jaw crushers.  Consideration was given to a single crusher operation however there 
was little capital advantage as the single crusher produced coarser feed to the mills requiring larger mills.  
At this stage of study it was not possible to select either circuit on cost so the twin train approach was 
selected based on operability.  

17.2.4 Coarse Ore Storage and Reclaim 
The coarse ore stockpiles will have a live capacity of 16 hours or 30,000 tonnes with a fall back capacity 
(100,000 tonnes) equivalent to 2 days operation. Coarse ore reclaim is by 4 apron feeders each delivering 
1,250 t/h to the milling circuits. 

17.2.5 Grinding and Classification 
Dual SAG-Ball (SAB) grinding circuits have been adopted with an overall availability of 91.3%. Each 
processing 15 Mtpa (nominally 1,875 t/h) and comprise a single 16 MW Metso SAG mill (38ft x 20ft)  and a 
16 MW single Metso Ball mill (26ft x 44ft).    Allowance has been made for the possible future inclusion of a 
pebble crusher circuit if required.  

17.2.6 Flotation 
The flotation and concentrate handling circuits have been designed on the basis of a 3,750 t/h throughput, 
nominal feed grade of 0.30% Cu and 90% overall copper recovery to a 27% copper concentrate. The 
flotation circuit with rougher flotation and two stages of cleaning is typical for this size concentrator. The 
rougher flotation circuit consists of two parallel banks of six 300 mÂ³ tank type flotation cells. Rougher 
concentrate from the flotation banks is combined prior to being pumped to the cleaner flotation circuit.  
Tailings from the two rougher circuit reports to the final tails thickener initially however, it becomes the feed 
to the magnetite circuit if it is introduced. 

Rougher circuit concentrate will be reground in two parallel M10000 ISAMillsÂ® to achieve a 60 Âµm product.  
The ISAMillsÂ® have been selected based on contemporary designs for copper concentrators. 

Rougher circuit concentrate, cleaner scavenger concentrate and re-cleaner tails feed the cleaner flotation 
circuit.  The two stage cleaner flotation circuit comprises five, 100 m3 cleaner cells, four, 100 m3 cleaner 
scavenger tank type flotation cells and two 3 m diameter re-cleaner columns. 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 108 of 142 

17.2.7 Copper concentrate handling 
Re-cleaner flotation concentrate is thickened in a 20 m diameter Outotec designed thickener. Thickener 
overflow is recycled to the process circuit and the thickened concentrate is filtered on a vertical plate and 
frame IPM filter.  Filtered concentrate is stored in the bulk copper concentrate storage shed.  A front-end 
loader will be used to load concentrate trucks prior to the concentrate being transported to port. 

17.2.8 Magnetite recovery 
Magnetite will be recovered as a by-product from the copper flotation circuit final tails streams. Both rougher 
tails and cleaner scavenger tails will constitute the feed to the magnetite recovery circuit. The magnetite 
rougher circuit will consist of twenty; 1.2 m diameter wet low intensity magnetic separator drums with 17 in 
operation and 3 on stand-by. The magnetite rougher concentrate will be combined with the magnetite 
regrind mill discharge. Magnetic concentrate recovered from the rougher magnetic separation circuit will 
constitute the feed to the magnetite regrind circuit which consists of an ISAMillÂ®.  The rougher magnetic 
separator concentrate is pumped to the regrind mill.  The regrind mill overflow is pumped to the classifying 
cyclones.  Overflow from the magnetite regrind cyclones, at an 80% passing size of 20Âµm, will gravitate to 
the cleaner magnetic separation circuit. 

Prior to the cleaner magnetic separation circuit, it is considered normal practice for the reground magnetite 
rougher concentrate to pass through a hydro separator. The hydro separator will use dilution water and 
magnetic coil to assist with the removal of silica. The hydro separator underflow will gravitate to the 
magnetic cleaner feed hopper via de-mag coil (reduces the potential agglomeration of magnetite trapping 
silica in downstream cleaning), while the overflow will report back to the magnetic rougher tails hopper.  

The cleaner magnetic separation circuit consists of three triple drum magnetic separators. Tails from the 
cleaner magnetic separation circuit will be combined with the rougher magnetic separator tails, and pumped 
to the final tails thickener. Concentrate from the cleaner magnetic separators will be pumped to the 
magnetite concentrate thickening area.   

Cleaner magnetite concentrate, magnetite concentrate filter filtrate will report to the magnetite concentrate 
thickener. No flocculent should be used in the magnetite dewatering thickener due to the potential to entrap 
fine silica.  The preferred option is to install a permanent magnet on the centre well feed line.  This has two 
advantages, firstly, promotes rapid flocculation of the magnetite and secondly, allows the fine (colloidal) to 
report to the thickener overflow.  The thickener overflow will gravitate to the magnetite concentrate thickener 
overflow tank, where it will be pumped to the final tails thickener.  

17.2.9 Tailings  
The tailings from the rougher and cleaner scavenger flotation circuits is flocculated and thickened in a 72 m 
diameter thickener.  The tailings underflow is discharged to the TSF and the overflow returned to the 
process plant. The overflow recycle does not meet the full process water demand.  Make-up process water 
will need to be collected from the TSF along with addition raw water.   

17.2.10 Process control  
The control philosophy to be implemented for the Taysan copper project is a typical system employed in 
contemporary mineral processing operations. Field instrumentation provides inputs to the Process Control 
System (PCS) via the fibre optic data network.  The PCS control modules will be located in the Motor 
Control Centres (MCCs) and contain the proprietary hardware, power supplies and I/O modules for 
instrument monitoring and loop control. The control functions are performed by collection of status 
information for drives, instrumentation and packaged equipment, provision of drive control and process 
interlocking and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control for process control loops.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
GHD was commissioned by CHR to provide professional engineering infrastructure services in the conduct 
of a scoping study for the Taysan Porphyry Copper-Gold Project.  The following is a summary of the full 
GHD report. 

18.1 Hydrology 
The Municipality of Taysan has an area classified as having a Type I Climate. Type I Climate is generally 
characterized by a distinct dry season from November to April and wet season during the rest of the year. 

Water requirements in the mining area were estimated for process demands only. It was assumed that for 
plant commissioning and in the initial start up, the full process demand will all be obtained from the ground 
water sources. However, the water supply to the adjacent communities might be reduced or worse depleted 
such that alternate source are to be considered. The water requirement for the ore processing will be 
assumed to be constant up to the end of operation (assumed 25 years).  

The mass balance figures developed for the TSF produce 4,974 m3/h (7,212 t/h) tailings at 50 wt% solids. It 
is further assumed that there is a 75% recovery of water from the material entering the TSF which is used 
back in the plant. 

18.2 Water Supply 
Potential water supply sources are to be identified to satisfy the water requirement of the process plant and 
the whole of the mine site for 25 years. It is anticipated that communities located near and within the Project 
Site will be affected once the mining operation commences, hence the scoping study also includes 
identification of potential water supply sources for these communities.  

Utilization of groundwater is considered as a potential source. Information on the groundwater wells was 
obtained from the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) of Taysan municipality through inputs from 
TAYWAD.  

Surface water is considered as another viable water source. There are two river systems located within and 
near the Project site, namely, Kalumpang River and Lobo River respectively. Since there are no stream flow 
data for these two rivers, it would be necessary to conduct a stream flow study for the area. 

Options were developed for the domestic requirement of the adjacent communities comprising of nine 
barangays and the process requirement for the mine. It is envisaged that present water sources of the 
adjacent communities will be scarce when the mine will be in operation such that options to mitigate this 
scenario are being studied. Option 1 considers mining water requirement from bore field and domestic water 
requirement from Lobo River. Option 2, on the other hand, considers mining water requirement from Lobo 
River and domestic water requirement from bore field. The estimated total cost for the water supply system 
amounts to USD 52,923,000 for Option 1 and USD 33,798,000 for Option 2. All unit costs were referred 
from local canvass/suppliers.  

18.3 Tailings Storage Facility 
The site selected for the TSF comprises a relatively steep sided valley between the flat plateau around San 
Marcelino village and the mountainous country further south The proposal allows for a combined TSF/WRD 
structure with total area of approximately 12 km2, rising to a maximum elevation of RL230m, giving ultimate 
embankment height of approximately 70 m on the northern side and up to approximately 130 m on the 
western side. The storage is bounded by natural surface on the southern and eastern boundaries as shown 
in attached drawings.  

The western extent of the TSF has been limited to prevent interference with a major tributary of the Lobo 
River, which has a significant catchment in the western hills.  



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 110 of 142 

It is envisaged that the embankment construction will incorporate waste rock but the volumes required are 
less than the total waste rock expected. There is capacity for excess waste rock to also be deposited in the 
valley to the west of the TSF. This would be desirable to allow reduced batter slopes on the TSF structure 
and facilitate eventual closure. It would also be preferable with regard to avoiding waste rock dumping in the 
more populated areas to the west of the pit. 

The proposed tailings management system comprises thickened tailings targeting a slurry density in excess 
of 60% solids (target 66%) with expectation of significant decant water return. The thickened tailings option 
has been chosen to give the best potential tailings density and thus reduce storage volume, whilst still 
allowing pumping using conventional centrifugal pumps.  

It is not proposed to consider upstream construction due to concerns that tailings properties will not allow 
sufficient density to be achieved to limit the risk of liquefaction during seismic loading.   

To create an efficient beaching regime the conceptual design allows for a perimeter tailings pipeline with 
regular spigots to create an extensive beach around the TSF. This will allow maximum drying and 
densification of tailings. A central primary spillway/decant structure will be accessed by a causeway and will 
feature a permeable decant well to draw water to a submersible pump for return to the Mill. Once the decant 
pond becomes sufficiently elevated a gravity return pipe can be provided. 

The TSF will be provided with an emergency spillway and will also feature a downstream retention pond to 
collect silt runoff from the active works areas of the dam during construction and intercept any seepage. 

Current expectations are that Acid and Metalliferous Drainage (AMD) will not be a significant issue and can 
be managed during operations and contained at closure. However, pyrite was noted in cores from the site 
and this issue will need to be confirmed by geo-chemical testing. 

The TSF will be designed to meet relevant aspects of the Equator Principles. This means that the proposed 
dam design basis will follow recognised international practice for safe and sustainable tailings storage. In 
particular the design will follow International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) and Australian National 
Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD) Guidelines. 

The annual rainfall has varied from a minimum of 1124 mm to 2075 mm during a 9 year period. Using the 
potentially conservative value for runoff, the water harvest from the TSF is likely to range between 13,500 
ML and 25,000 ML per annum. 

The extended catchment area of the proposed fresh-water/environment dam is approximately 40 km2.  This 
brings the total average water harvesting potential to approximately 40,000 ML. This should be more than 
sufficient to provide make-up process water and other water requirements. Total water uses are still to be 
determined but WRD dust suppression estimated could be at least 3000 m3/day for haul roads i.e. 1000 
ML/annum. 

Start-up requirements for water will need to be considered and will depend on the time of year when the 
plant is commissioned. An appropriate for storage may be 3 months supply of make up water for tailings, 
which would be 30,000 ML, but if river flow is proved to be reliable then this could be reduced. 

The conceptual design comprises the following features: 

x Starter dam for Year 1 using in-situ materials won from within the storage. Section to comprise clay 
core with crushed rock filters. Foundation cut-off trench and allowing cement grouting of foundations 
in rock. 

x Further progressive raising by downstream construction using selectively placed waste rock, with 
overburden clays placed on the tailings side, crushed rock filter placed against the clay, selected 
fine rock placed against the filter and general waste rock placed on the outer face.  

x Detailed design of progressive rising will be incorporated into the mine plan to coordinate materials 
availability and placement location. In addition AMD issues related to waste rock will need to be 
included. This could involve encapsulation of sulphide bearing waste within the TSF embankment 
structure. 

x A waste rock causeway will be constructed into the storage to provide a strategic primary spillway 
and decant collection location able to maximise beach area.

x Decant will initially be pumped until the TSF is high enough to allow gravitation after the first few 
years. 

x Excess decant water will be released to the Lobo River via a retention pond below the TSF/WRD 
structure. This will be designed to  
ï¿½ Settle and retain silt run-off from the works areas upstream 
ï¿½ Allow controlled release to meet water quality requirements 
ï¿½ Provide sufficient retention for process water supply during start-up and dry periods 

x An emergency spillway will be provided to cater for extreme flood events 

The storage capacity chart for the TSF is shown in Figure 97. This shows that the embankment for Stage 1 
mining (10 years) would need to reach an average beach level of approximately RL 197 m. Allowing for 
beach slope the dam crest would need to be approximately RL 200 m with a maximum height of 
approximately 70 m. This could be achieved with an initial starter dam of 45 m, followed by annual lifts of 
approximately 5 m. 

The ultimate dam crest level is likely to be approximately RL 240 m by year 25. This could be achieved by 
lifts of 5 m every 2 years. 

 
Figure 97: TSF Storage Capacity Chart 

The water storage/retention dam has been located downstream of the TSF and waste rock dump area with 
the dual purpose of: 

x Providing storage for process water 
x Providing retention of runoff water from waste disposal areas for water quality purposes 

The dam site has not been inspected but appears to be suited to construction of a dam approximately 30 m 
high. Preliminary concept development is based on an earth and rock fill embankment with a central clay 
core and filters with upstream batter of 2.5:1 and downstream batter of 2:1. The dam will feature a spillway 
and outlet works including a pump for return of water to the Mill. The outlet will allow selection of a draw-off 
point to ensure best quality water is discharged. 

The spillway may need to be concrete lined as fresh rock is likely to be at depth below the abutments. An 
alternative may be a saddle to the north-west of the dam embankment site. 

The capital estimate for the TSF is presented in Table 53, with the cost estimate for the Fresh 
Water/Retention Dam in Table 54.  Estimates include allowances for engineering (10%) and contingency 
(30%).

18.4 Access Roads 
The scoping study identified existing roads going to the mine site, as well as from the mine going to the 
potential port facility locations. 

The Taysan-Rosario municipal road is located along the stretch of the provincial road named Batangas-
Quezon Road in an intersection approximately some 9.0 km from Ibaan town proper. The road stretches 
approximately 10 km down south from the town proper of Rosario to the Municipality of Taysan. This 
existing concrete type road has a standard width of 6.1 m two-way travelled lane. 

Another service route option to the mine site from the town of Ibaan is the Ibaan-Taysan Road which is 
similar to the Rosario-Taysan Road and can also be considered as service road entry and exit point to and 
from the Makati Central Business District (CBD). This route is presumed to accommodate only light vehicles 
based on the existing geometric alignment. Several sharp and tight curves have been noticed that were not 
manageable to long vehicle manoeuvrability. Also the existing concrete spillway (Causeway) located some 
3.7 km away from Ibaan was found to be impassable during heavy rains due to strong current.  

The Pag-asa - Bilogo Road is a municipal road with approximate length of 7.5 km from Taysan proper, 
connecting to Gov. Antonio Carpio Road. The existing concrete type road with part asphalt overlay along 
selected segments has a travelled lane width of 6.0 meters two-way traffic condition and shoulder width 
ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 meters wide. The road traverses a flat to rolling terrain with roadside land use of 
residential lot to agricultural land. 

Governor Antonio Carpio Road is a provincial road linking the Municipality of Taysan to the City of 
Batangas. The road is approximately 24 km from Taysan town proper to the intersection with the national 
road in Barangay Pallocan leading to the Port of Batangas. The road traverses a rolling to flat terrain in 
westward direction toward Batangas City. Considered to be a primary route to the port area from the mine 
site, the concrete pavement type road has a width of 6.7 m travelled lane and a shoulder width of 2.0 m on 
the average, which is enough to accommodate stalled vehicles without causing traffic jam to motorist. 

The city road to Tabangao port starts at the intersection with the Gov. Antonio Carpio road going in south 
direction toward highly industrialized zone of Barangay Tabangao, approximately 12 km from the 
intersection to Tabangao Port. Land use is mostly industrial zone with small residential areas along the 
roadside. 

18.5 Port Facilities 
Existing and potential port locations and facilities along the coastline of Batangas Bay were considered for 
the export of copper gold concentrate to be mined from Taysan. This strip of coastline is located along the 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 113 of 142 

most industrialized zone of Batangas City strategically placed to provide transport link to businesses and 
commercial establishments via existing road networks.   

Following the scoping site visit and sourced information from the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), and 
information supplied by CHRI, three sites were identified along the coastline of Batangas Bay considered to 
be potential port options: Tabangao Port (an existing fishing port), Pinamukan Beach Resort (a private 
resort) and Port of Batangas (an existing modernized port facility under the PPA).   

On the information available, the best export port option appears to be the existing Port of Batangas. This is 
qualified as the land area available is of unknown size or shape.  It is presumed that there is loading 
equipment available for this project and that the wharf available is suitable for the required ships. However 
all of these matters need to be quantified. 

The land area required for stockpiling is typically large. Assuming similar properties for the copper and 
magnetite ore concentrate of bulk density of 2 t/m3, stable angles of repose of 1:1.5 and a maximum 
stockpile height of 5 m result in a stack having a plan area of 15 m x 400 m for 15,000 m3 of ore.  

Transport cost is related to the number of shipping movements and associated costs, e.g. berthing, pilotage, 
etc and the economies of scale.  

In general, vessels bringing plant, equipment and consumables to the Port may vary from coastal ships, 
small container vessels or in the case of heavy loads - special heavy lift ships. These vessels typically have 
drafts of less than 10 m. Unloading general cargo would be typically by ships cranes (if fitted) or mobile 
cranes. The frequency of shipping will depend on what plant and equipment is required and the quantum to 
be delivered in the allowed for establishment time. 

Based on Reference 1 â€“ Admiralty Sailing Instructions (Philippine Islands Pilot, NP 33, Second Edition 
2004) and the limited bathymetry information available at Batangas Port, it may be possible to operate a 
typical Handymax class ship at or near full load capacity with tidal assistance. 

It is also understood that the large number of truck trips will need to be on already crowded roads. It is 
possible that trucking would need to be considered at night and certainly not in peak hour periods. 

18.6 Power  
GHD was commissioned to evaluate additional power options.  For the PEA it is assumed the project will 
purchase grid power at US$0.128/kWh for the initial four years whilst a US$180M coal fired owned plant is 
designed and constructed delivering cheaper power at US$0.06/kWh for years five to end of mine life. A 
distribution line will have to be constructed before project start up. 

The Batangas II Electric Cooperative (BATELEC II) is the local power distributor of the Municipality of 
Taysan. Three options have been identified during this scoping study as potential source of power for the 
project. These options were based on review of existing information gathered from various agencies of 
concern, as well as initial site inspection. 

There are a number of large power generation plants in South Luzon region which are producing electricity 
at a very competitive price for export to Metro Manila, the major load centre for the Luzon grid. Addition of 
any further power plants in the region will need to be very competitive or otherwise shall suffer financial 
losses. 

A number of existing generators in the region have expressed interest to supply power to the mine through 
installation of additional units at the existing sites such as Calaca, Pagbilao etc. The brown field expansions 
are likely to be more economic than the green field units. 

A 230 kV switchyard and a 230 kV transmission line will require to be built at mine site to receive the power 
from the grid at mine substation. Power for the port may be procured from the local power distribution 
company, BATELEC II. 

The power supply for mine and its infrastructure including port facilities can be categorised as follows: 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 114 of 142 

x Essential Services 

The essential services load is estimated to be about 10 MW, 70% at the mine location and the balance 30% 
being at the port facility. 

The power for essential services shall be available at all times, and will be secured through installation of 
Emergency Diesel Generator Sets both at port site and the mine. It is expected that Uninterrupted Power 
Supply (UPS) shall be available in addition, for emergency lighting, control room and for other critical 
installations. 

x Mine and Port Operational Power 

The average mine and port operational load required at the time of mine operation is estimated to be about 
95 MW. Mine and its process is a line operation, however intermediate storage points are also provided. It is 
understood that the key mining equipment such as Sag mills and Ball mills are expected to be in operational 
for 8000 hours in a year. 

It is also to be noted that certain key equipment are also in multiple number, e.g. there are two ball mills, 
suggesting with part power supply 50% mine processing operation can also be sustained. 

The essential services at port and mine require very high availability of power. Backup power supply will be 
arranged to address this. Power supply to the mine and port will require a reliability factor of 99.5%.  

GHD Engineering identified the following key options for power supply: 

1. Grid power. One option is the 300 MVA Batangas substation, which would require a 69 kV 
transmission line to run from the substation to the project site. It traverses the Gov. Antonio Carpio 
Road, which has a 5-km distance between the tapping points to the project site. The cost to install 
transmission line is approximately Php 5 million (US$112,000) per km or a total of Php 25 million 
(US$560,000) for the 5 km stretch. These figures are preliminary and do not include the cost for 
acquisition for Right-of-Way.  

2. Another option is to source power from an existing power plant within the vicinity. The 1,500 MW 
Sta. Rita-San Lorenzo Combined Cycle Power Plant, which is situated in Batangas City 
approximately 30 km from the project site, has been identified for this scoping study. For this power 
supply option, a direct connection to the 230 kV transmission line running along the national road is 
necessary as per the National Grip Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) recommendations. It has 
a total distance of approximately 30 km from the power supply to the project site and traverses the 2 
highways, National Road and Gov. Antonio Carpio Road. This connection, however, is subject for 
approval by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). It is estimated that the cost of this 
transmission line is approximately Php 8 million (US$178,000) per kilometre or a total of Php 240 
million (US$5.40 million), excluding the cost for the Right-of-Way acquisition. During commercial 
operations of the mine, NGCP shall request their Tariff Group to simulate the plant power bill using 
the plant final power demand.  

3. Another option to consider for power supply is to construct a power plant based on power 
requirements of the project. In recent years, the capital costs of building a new power plant have 
increased because of the surging prices of raw materials (primarily steel and cement), inflation rates 
and various technologies that are now being utilised. In the Philippines, the estimated installed cost 
of building a coal-fired power plant has risen to approximately US$2.5 million to US$3.5 million per 
megawatt. This cost does not include transmission line costs. For enhanced power service and 
reliability, a coal-fired power plant should be located close to the process plant. It would be an 
advantage for the coal storage facility to be situated within the port facility.

18.7 Telecommunications 
There are three telecommunication service providers identified within the area. These are Globe Telecom 
(Globe), Smart Communications (Smart) and DIGITEL Telecommunications (Digital). Both Globe and Smart 
have network towers within the vicinity of the project site.  

Currently, Taysan residents have access to wireless landline and internet. Expansion plans from the service 
providers for telecom cable infrastructure are no longer applicable in Taysan because of the high cost of 
investment and access to wireless technology via Wi-Fi that have been introduced already and widely 
accepted.  

18.8 Copper Concentrate and Magnetite Handling 
Based on initial estimates, it is understood that the mine production targets are given as follows: 

x 335,000 tpa of wet copper concentrate 

To calculate the number of trucks required to transport the copper concentrate, the following items are 
assumed for purposes of this scoping study: 

x Travel days per annum = 365 days 
x Round-trip distance (mine site to port and back) = 50 km 
x Average truck speed = 50 kph 
x Loading/Unloading standby time = 1 hr 

It is estimated that the daily volume of copper concentrate for transport is 918 t per day. To transport this 
amount using trucks with 20 t load capacity, the estimated daily truckload requirement is 46 truckloads per 
day. For an 11 hour day shift operation scenario, one 20 t capacity truck is expected to make 6 trips per 
day. The total number of trucks required is estimated at 13 trucks per day. If redundancy is included, the 
total is 14 trucks per day. For a 24 hour operation scenario, one 20-tonne capacity truck is expected to 
make 11 trips per 22 hour day shift. The total number of trucks required is estimated at 7 trucks per day, 
with redundancy it is 8 trucks per day. 

The preferred mode of transport for copper concentrate is by trucks, which is typical in the Philippines. With 
the given amount of concentrate and estimated hauling distance from mine site to port facility, it would be 
viable to use trucks for transport. Trucking the concentrate would have a relatively low up front capital costs 
and probably suit this application. However, if looking at a long-term prospect and factors such as difficult 
terrain would prove that trucking is not feasible, there may be opportunity to pump the slurry through 
pipeline and dewater at the port. Use of slurry pipeline would entail a round-the-clock delivery of the 
concentrates, no drivers nor trailers are required and dust blowing around during transport of the 
concentrates would be eliminated.  

More information is needed to firmly establish the best option, such as material sizes, topography, truck 
sizes, road routes and conditions, etc. This could be determined in the next phase of the study.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Copper Concentrate 
Standard Chartered Equity Research in August 2010 indicated the current copper mine supply is the tightest 
on record.  Their market research showed about 3.5 million tonne of new copper supply was delayed due to 
the 2008 financial crisis.  Standard Chartered project a 0.9% global supply growth in 2011 and attribute the 
shortfall in copper mine supply to:  

x Ageing mines, declining ore grades, deeper mines, increasing costs and labour unrest. 
x Largest copper mines having an average age of 52 years â€“ likely why they are missing targets. 
x Market expected to be in deficit until 2013 assuming conservative demand assumptions. 
x Consumers have destocked at a time when they think copper could spike to $US12,000/tonne. 

A common presumption that is made is the tendency to believe that it is a matter of time before the copper 
price migrates back to the marginal highest cost producer in the industry, which is around $US2.0/lb. 
Standard Chartered's research estimates new copper projects, on average, require a $2.83/pound copper 
price to incentivise their development (assuming 15% IRR). If the miners have a 20% IRR as the benchmark 
for developing new projects, they estimated an incentive price of $US3.25/lb, which is well below the 
present spot price. Given an environment of increasing production costs and capital expenditure blowouts, 
Standard Chartered estimate copper price of $US3.00/lb as the floor for the longer term. 

 
Figure 98: LME 5 Year Copper Price 

The sale of copper concentrate is dependent upon the marketing strategy adopted.  As there is no 
integrated smelting operation with the Taysan resource, the market will be to a custom smelter or smelters.  
This market accounts for about 50% of copper concentrate sales.  The contract type can be long term frame 
between the mines and smelter or through an intermediary merchant or trader. Also sales can be 
accomplished on the spot market usually via merchants.  Alternatively price share contracts may be 
entertained where charges are levied as a percentage of the prevailing copper price.  

Contract terms are normally fixed over the life of the contract and include: 

x Term of Contract 
x Brick or Block 
x Calendar or Mid-Year 
x Tonnage (tonnage options) 
x Holiday or No-Holiday 
x Reference Clauses (e.g. Major Settlements in Japan) 
x Delivery Terms (CIF or FOB; destinations) 
x Shipping Terms (SHINC/SATPMSHEX/SHEX) 
x Quotational Periods [QP] Price Reference period 
x Usually a single Month 
x Anchored to Month of Shipment or Arrival

x Sometimes Options granted (usually to Buyer) 
x Some Buyers request back-pricing 
x Price Reference LME / London Bullion Market 
x Publication Reference Platt's / Metal Bulletin 
x Penalty Elements/Schedules As / Hg / Co+Ni / Al2O3+MgO / Cl / F etc. 
x Payable Rates (all metals) % of metal content paid / mid deduction 
x Payment Terms Timing / Interest %. 
x Concentrate terms are typically negotiated on an annual basis and these normally represent smelter 

charges: 
x Treatment Charge $ / DMT 
x Refining Charge (Cu) Â¢ / lb 
x Refining Charge (Au) $ / oz 
x Refining Charge (Ag) $ / oz 
x Price Participation [PP] (Cu) % of Cu Price. 

Historically concentrate terms have accounted for about Â± 10% of copper price above/below 90Â¢/lb with 
caps and floors existing.  Caps and floors have been eliminated in the current concentrate market. 

The concentrate sales market is complex and an appropriate marketing strategy should be adopted.  It is 
recommended that a formal copper concentrate market research study be undertaken in the next stage of 
the project and a marketing approach selected.  This will ensure availability of technical information relating 
to concentrate quality can be integrated into the financial model based on accurate analysis of the 
concentrate. 

19.2 Magnetite 
Koenig Consulting provided a study to determine the marketability of magnetite concentrate produced from 
the tailings of the Taysan Copper Gold project in Batangas Province in the Philippines. The Koenig study 
assumed a stand-alone magnetite recovery facility. 

To provide a basis for the magnetite study, the following has been undertaken: 
x Review of the current copper circuit test data in relation to magnetite recovery 
x Determination of the process and transport requirements for producing and shipping magnetite 

concentrate 
x Review of the uses and markets for magnetite 
x Review of the current and expected pricing for the concentrate 
x Review of the location of potential customers, (by country only) 
x Development of a conceptual financial analysis spread sheet to determine the value of producing 

and marketing magnetite concentrate. 

Although the grades of magnetite in the tailings seem low at around 2% weight recovery, the project has 
value because of the low operating and capital costs.  Current and predicted iron ore prices have also 
assisted in the project showing a significant return on investment. Considering the elevated concentrate 
TiO2 grade, the Davis Tube concentrates were evaluated from a perspective of suitability to produce a 
concentrate for the heavy media market. 

19.3 Contracts 
There are no contracts entered into at this stage of the preliminary economic study with the exception of the 
non-binding agreement announced on February 21, 2011 whereby CHR entered into a non-binding letter of 
intent with a private Philippine company to acquire a 16 hectare port facility in Batangas, Philippines, to 
handle anticipated future production from the Taysan Project, assuming its successful development.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL 
OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

This section is derived from the Environmental Baseline Report prepared for CHR by GAIA South Inc., 
Environmental Consultants.  The Environmental Baseline Report presents the current status of the existing 
surroundings and people prior to the proposed mining operations.  The scope of the study covers the entire 
proposed facilities and its vicinities.  Application of professional methodologies acceptable to environmental 
standards was employed in this study.  Technically sound analyses and scientifically-based studies of the 
various biological, physical, social and health concepts were adopted to present the results of the 
assessment. 

x The Taysan Property is seated in the plain with an elevation of 150 m to 179 m.  The topography is 
gently sloping with undulating plains. Some ancient volcanic features characterize the area. The 
tributaries in the vicinity drain to the west and northwest. 

x There is substantial copper and gold deposit in the area that may justify economic recovery through 
open pit mining. 

x The seismicity within the vicinity of Taysan Property is affected by the geologic structures such as 
Philippine Fault, Manila Trench, East Luzon Trough, West Valley Fault, Lubang Fault and 
Casiguran Fault.  

x There are two (2) volcanic centers that are near to the project site.  Taal Volcano is about 30 km to 
the north and Mt. Banahaw is about the same distance to the northeast. PHILVOCS has classified 
these two (2) volcanoes as active. 

x There are no geological conditions that can prevent mining at the site.  There are no significant 
geohazards that threaten the site; and neither does any unique geological condition that may be 
used to justify objection to the proposed mining project. 

Significant findings on the environment and social situation were discussed in this report based on the 
baseline study.  These are summarized as follows: 

x Non-existence of local resolutions, ordinances or administrative orders declaring the immediate 
mine site area for conservation.   

x Wildlife species observed were mostly "least concern" in terms of conservation status. Majority of 
the plants are either agricultural crops or less important tree species that grow within a secondary 
growth forest.  However, some trees of Molave (Vitex parviflora) were documented. This species is 
considered "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural 
Resources (IUCN, 2010).   

x High susceptibility of the Ibaan Clay loam on the lower half of the area to landsliding is observed. 
Diverting the flow of tributaries near the proposed TSF may lower the risk of flooding. 

x The estimated surface water yield from the Pit and PiÃ±a sub-catchments, which amount to 9.14 and 
16.22 MCM per year, constitute the maximum reduction in discharge that may occur from the 
Kalumpang and Rosario Rivers, respectively.  Considering the total output of the Kalumpang and 
Rosario rivers, these represent 1.2% and 5.4% of the total yield of the Kalumpang and Rosario 
rivers, respectively. 

x The Municipality of Lobo where Rosario River runs through from Taysan via Bucao and PiÃ±ahan 
Rivers is directly facing the Verde Island and is part of the Verde Island Passage.  The possible 
impact of accidental tailings spillage from dam failure as well as chemical seepage through the 
Rosario River to this important biodiversity area could be properly and significantly addressed 
through the conduct particle transport modelling. 

x The predicted noise level and ambient air quality in the area were assessed to be within the 
National Standards.   

x The Taysan local government and its people have been supported by various industries operating 
in the area. The presence of school facilities, barangay health centres, well-built barangay halls, 
business establishments, residential subdivisions, recreational facilities, covered courts, multi-
purpose hall, and water/ irrigation facilities among others reflect that resources in the area are 
available.

x At present, the community which will directly be affected by the development comprised 
approximately 5,000 titled or claimed lots embracing around 199 households.  Issue on 
relocation/resettlement may arise if no proper agreement between the company and land-owners 
will be settled. 

x No records of security problems were noted during the assessment and based on community 
documentation. 

x Need for the development of an Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) Program in the 
community focusing on environmental management and monitoring, technical and safety features of 
the operation, and community development among others. 

x Need to formulate the company's Mission-Vision-Goal Statement to serve as guiding tool in its 
operation and concern to environment and people; and 

x Need to devise a Social Development and Management Plan (SDMP) focusing on infrastructure 
development, social services, livelihood assistance, relocation and resettlement, and community 
organizing (CO).

GHD has reviewed the capital cost estimate for an owner built power facility.  The PEA allows for a four year 
development plan and US$180M has been included as power plant sustaining cost over years 1-4 of 
operation based upon the Calaca coal power plant cost of approximately US$1,800/kWh. 

The capital cost includes: 

x Project Development cost including engineering cost, permitting cost etc. 
x Cost for land wherever applicable 
x Cost for site development wherever applicable 
x All financing and legal costs 
x Engineering-procurement-construction cost 
x O&M team setup cost 
x Initial capital and strategic spares cost 
x Owner's implementation team cost such as Owner's Engineer and other advisors. 

The above cost estimates are high level estimates for comparison and PEA purpose only; detailed study will 
be required once one or two preferred options are selected for the feasibility study exercise. 

21.2 Operating Costs 

21.2.1 Mining 
The estimated diesel usage at Taysan varies with haul distance and total movement.  On average Taysan 
will consume an estimated 35ML of diesel per year which is approximately 38% of the total operating cost. 

The mine operating cost has been estimated from first principles using IMC's operating cost modelling 
database along with inputs from local contractors and equipment suppliers.   

The average operating cost (excluding fixed overheads) at Taysan is estimated to be $1.68 per ROM tonne 
for ore mining and $1.58 per waste tonne for waste mining as shown in Table 56.  The waste mining cost is 
lower than the ore mining cost as 40% of the waste is not expected to require blasting (tuff and oxide).

21.2.2 Process Plant  
The process operating costs have been determined for nine discrete cost centres and have been compiled 
from a variety of sources.  The operating costs presented here represent the base case evaluation including 
the magnetite circuit in operation.  Operating costs have been developed using the ore specific plant 
parameters specified in the process design criteria.  The overall process operating costs are summarised in 
Table 58.

According to the MREPEA, the above was "calculated based on the electrical load as generated from the 
major mechanical equipment list".   

The total power demand and consumption based on 8000 hours of annual operation is provided below: 

The process and the infrastructure engineers are undertaking further assessment of the power 
consumptions for various load centres as part of the prefeasibility study. As and when the new information 
becomes available, the above table will be revisited.  

An existing 69 kV power line within 5 km of the proposed site has been sighted by GHD, which may be 
adequate for construction power to the site, however further investigation will be necessary to understand 
the current loading of the system. During the construction time, power could be purchased through the local 
retail operator or, subject to further review of the Grid Code rules, purchased directly from the electricity 
market.  In the latter case, some level of power contracting could be maintained to protect against events on 
the system which could cause significant periods of unusually high power prices. 

The base case option for construction power is the pre-installation of Emergency Diesel Generator sets; 
however, it is almost certain that a more reliable and much more economic option through direct purchase 
from the market or purchase from a retailer will be available. 

National grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) has set a number of charges for use of its regulated 
transmission assets and also for use of the transmission system which ensures security of power supply.

The various elements of grid charges are described below. The rates may vary month to month for 
necessary minor adjustments to ensure the full recovery. The rates below are quoted for April 2011. 

ï¿½ Power Delivery Service (PDS) Rates: The PDS rates are based on a recovery of approved Maximum 
Allowable Revenue set by the regulatory authority. For Luzon, the rates are as follows: 

â€“ Firm Rate of 354.96 P/kW per month 
â€“ Non-firm rate of 11.67 P/kW per day 

ï¿½ System Operator Charge:  
â€“ Firm Rate of 17.1 P/kW per month 
â€“ Non-firm rate of 0.5622 P/kW per day 

ï¿½ Metering Service Provider Charge 
â€“ Common Metering Charge 2,297 P per month 
â€“ Metering Service Charge  25,140 P per month at 230 kV 

ï¿½ Ancillary Services Charges 
â€“ Regulating Reserve: Firm 21.05 P/kW per month, Non-firm 0.6921 P/kW per day 
â€“ Contingency Reserve: Firm 40.18 P/kW per month, Non-firm 1.3953 P/kW per day 
â€“ Dispatchable Reserve: Firm 42.44 P/kW per month, Non-firm 1.3210 P/kW per day 
â€“ Black Start Capacity: Firm 0.10 P/kW per month, Non-firm 0.0033 P/kW per day 

For a load of 100 MW with 8000 hours of operation, the transmission grid charges can be estimated to be 
about 0.75 P/kWh. 

The amount of line rental or line loss will vary depending on the location of the generator supplying the load 
and the customer high voltage load point. However, it is expected to be typically 3-4% for large loads. 

Given, the location of Taysan being in a power surplus zone, the line loss is expected to be at the lower 
end, say 3% for the NGCP grid. For distribution system, the total line losses could be about 8.5% including 
the transmission system losses. 

GHD's investigation shows a power delivery price of 5.5 Php/kWh may be considered for the PEA exercise.  

For Taysan Copper port operations, the electricity is likely to be supplied by the local distribution company in 
which case the distribution losses and also user charges for distribution system will apply in addition. Such 
charges would be in the order of 2.50 â€“ 3.00 P/kWh giving a cost of 8.50 â€“ 10 P/kWh for port load.  

Please note that the above estimates do not include any government tax such as VAT.

22.2 Economic Analysis 
The PEA, managed by AMEC Minproc Limited of Australia, indicates that the Taysan Project has a Net 
Present Value ("NPV") at a 10% discount rate of US$639M for the base case of US$3/lb Cu, US$1,000/oz 
Au, $26/oz Ag and $100/tonne of Magnetite. The internal rate of return ("IRR") is 21.9% for this base case.  
These numbers reflect a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) case and provide for a Philippines 
Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) certification of the processing plant. 

The Taysan Project remains sensitive to copper prices as shown in Table 62.

Project IRR % 9.9% 19.4% 35.6%  10.9% 21.9% 41.0% 

In addition to silver and magnetite, the PEA was updated with current numbers for diesel fuel (US$1.00/l 
versus US$0.81/l in March, 2011) and grid power of US$0.128/kWh for years 1-4 against coal power of 
US$0.06 over the same period.  The PEA allows for grid power during the first four years of operations 
whilst the coal power plant is constructed (US$180M versus US$132M in March, 2011) in order to achieve 
project start up as scheduled. Power after year 4 remains at Scoping Study estimate of US$0.06/kWh. 

The Taysan Project is estimated to produce 3,212 Mlb Cu, 1.02 M oz Au, 4.23M oz Ag and 11.84 Mt of 
Magnetite over the twenty-five (25) year mine life, net of smelter recoveries and deductions.  Annual 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
October 2011 

 

Page 125 of 142 

average production for years 1-4 is estimated at 175 Mlb Cu, 58,300 oz Au, 436,000 oz Ag and 0.53 Mt of 
Magnetite.  

A capital cost estimate of US$864M is lower than originally estimated (US$1,006M) due to the deferment of 
the power plant and refinement of the mining schedule.  

The C1 (cash) cost, including lower risk grid power, net of by-product credits is low at US$0.97/lb Cu for 
years 1-4 and US$1.38/lb Cu over the 25 year mine life.  Unit cost is estimated at US$8.77/t of ore 
processed and is driven by the low waste to ore ratio (0.8:1); proximity to port (20km); and low freight costs 
to expected market (China, Japan and Korea). 

The base case economic analysis of the project has been carried out using the Indicated and Inferred 
Resources and the scoping study economic assumptions stated in this document, including but not limited 
to the project Capex and Opex, Base Case metal prices, diesel price of US$1.00/litre, FX of 45PHP:1USD 
and the assumption of 100% equity financing.  Net Present Value has been calculated at a nominal 10%  

Project sensitivities have been run against ranges of varying capital and operating costs, metal prices and 
discount rate and assumption of two options of tax regimes. 

The un-audited financial model was prepared by Navigator Project Finance Pty Ltd with input from the 
various study consultants where appropriate.   

Taysan is wholly owned by Crazy Horse Resources, Inc. however the delivery mechanism of MPSA versus 
FTAA has not been decided on at this stage. The MPSA shows greater NPV. The FTAA scenario, however, 
will be easier to debt finance as non-Philippine banks are able to exercise and hold security over the 100% 
foreign owned FTAA share structure. The vast majority of foreign resources investments in the Philippines 
are under a two-company structure with the mining being conducted under MPSA and ore sold to a 100% 
foreign owned processing facility at cost plus 4% - 12% margin. The economic outcome in the two company 
scenario is somewhere between MPSA and FTAA.  

The following tables show the MPSA and FTAA base case metal price scenarios followed by sensitivities to 
capital and operating costs, metal prices and are summarized below.

22.3 Payback 
At the base case metal price assumptions, the project equity has a payback period of 3.5 years.   At a 
sensitivity of higher metal prices, the equity payback period is 2 years and 3 months.  At low metal 
prices, the payback is 7 years and at +5% Opex, the payback is 3 years and 8 months. 

22.4 Sensitivities 
Typically projects such as Taysan are sensitive to grade, recovery, metal prices and operating cost 
(power specifically).  They are not sensitive to capital cost.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Summary of Results 
An initial mineral resource estimate based on historical drilling was reported in the 11 March 2011 
NI43-101 report. The October 2011 NI43-101 (this report) is an update to the March 2011 minerals 
resource estimate and is based on the results of a 45 diamond drillhole programme conducted from 
October 2010 to June 2011. 

CHR's work to date has defined a significant porphyry copper deposit within the Taysan Project.  The 
drilling has confirmed that copper grades decrease at depth and that the deposit remains open down 
dip. The CHR drilling has bolstered confidence in the Taysan Project enabling an indicated and 
inferred copper resource to be estimated. The results have also provided data enabling a silver and 
magnetite inferred mineral resources to be added to the project.  

Low grade gold mineralisation at Taysan is broadly associated with copper mineralisation.  The CHR 
drilling indicates two distinct gold mineralising events; the initial syngenetic mineralisation associated 
with the porphyry copper mineralisation and subsequent epigenetic gold mineralisation associated 
with the quartz-magnetite alteration.  Within the quartz-magnetite alteration evidence of retrograde 
alteration (chlorite / kaolinite) is often associated with elevated gold grades.  The March 2011 gold 
resource figures relied on limited gold assay data and a copper-gold regression to support block 
estimates, however the current estimate is based solely on gold assays providing a more robust 
estimate.  Silver mineralisation also correlates to gold mineralisation spatially. 

25.1 Risks and Uncertainties 
Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
Portions of the Taysan copper gold project that have been classified as an Inferred resource, cannot 
be assumed will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued 
exploration. 
The development of the Taysan Project may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.  
Taysan lies within a typhoon zone with an average of 1 tropical typhoon every 4 years tracking within 
50km of Taysan. Typhoons present a temporary hazard which must be accounted for in terms of 
project infrastructure, open pit flood control and building codes. 

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
26.1 MA Recommendations 
MA proposes the follow recommendations: 

x Future drilling should target strike extensions and depth extensions. 
x Drilling should target gold silver and magnetite infill drilling to obtain sufficient gold, silver and 

magnetite data to achieve more robust resource estimates; 
x Future drilling programs should employ rigorous QA/QC procedures to provide a dataset 

suitable for estimation and reporting of NI43-101 compliant resource. 
x Due to the fine nature of the low cut-off boundary, non-linear techniques such as Uniform 

Conditioning or Conditional Simulation that allow for mining selectivity and recovery should be 
considered. 

It is the intension of CHR to continue drilling at Taysan with the view to increase confidence in the 
resource allowing reserves to be calculated with the 10 year pit shell as defined in the current 
Prefeasibility Study permitting the commencement of a Feasibility Study of the Taysan Copper 
Deposit.

26.2 AMEC Minproc Recommendations 
AMEC Minproc and the project consultants proposed a number of recommendations for the 
Prefeasibility Study in the March 2011 NI43-101 many of which still stand or are currently underway: 

x Additional geotechnical investigations comprising predominantly for the Open Pit drilling, 
laboratory testing of rock and downhole groundwater testing are required for the open pit; and 
drilling to test foundations within the waste and plant site areas is currently underway. Testing 
requirements are considered to be "normal" and largely to confirm the assumptions made to 
date.  No excessive or overly complicated investigations are envisaged. 

x Drill and Blast assumptions should be reviewed with an aim to better estimate the proportions 
of Tuff, Oxide and Fresh material requiring drilling and blasting. 

x There may be scope at Taysan to operate at an elevated cut-off grade which would reduce 
the total ore tonnes but improve the overall grade delivered to the mill.  A cut-off grade 
optimisation study should be included in the PFS. 

x Waste material characterisation is ongoing to define the acid generating potential and 
suitability for TSF embankment construction in order to properly plan the waste material 
movements to the TSF. 

x Load and Haul costs form a large proportion of the mine operating costs at Taysan.  A 
thorough review of available options to reduce the impact of this significant cost should be 
carried out.  Larger excavators, larger trucks and increased bench heights should improve the 
overall mine operating cost.  The practicality of electric shovels/excavators could also be 
reviewed to lower the mine Opex. 

x Little information was available during the scoping study covering groundwater and other 
inflows into the Taysan pit during the life of the project.  A more thorough understanding of the 
pit inflow quantities is being developed. 

x Engineering contracting and construction strategy requires further definition. 
x A formal copper and magnetite concentrate market research study should be undertaken and 

a marketing approach selected.   
x Based on the DTR magnetite bench testing, it is recommended that additional magnetic 

separation testing be conducted to evaluate the effect of multi-stage separation and the 
influence of regrinding the magnetic rougher concentrate to improve grade.  Testing should 
also evaluate the effects of staged cleaning on the final product grade,

30 GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS 
This glossary comprises a general list of common technical terms that are typically used by 
geologists. The list has been edited to conform in general to actual usage in the body of this report. 
However, the inclusion of a technical term in this glossary does not necessarily mean that it appears 
in the body of this report, and no imputation should be drawn. Investors should refer to more 
comprehensive dictionaries of geology in printed form or available in the internet for a complete 
glossary. 

 "200 mesh" the number of openings (200) in one linear inch of screen mesh (200 mesh approximately 
equals 75 microns) 

Analytic Signal The analytic signal method, known also as the total gradient method, is a method for 
interpretation of magnetic/gravity data. The data is transformed to produce a particular 
type of calculated gravity or magnetic anomaly enhancement map used for defining in a 
map sense the edges (boundaries) of geologically anomalous density or magnetization 
distributions 

"Au" chemical symbol for gold 

"block model" A block model is a computer based representation of a deposit in which geological zones 
are defined and filled with blocks which are assigned estimated values of grade and other 
attributes.  The purpose of the block model (BM) is to associate grades with the volume 
model. The blocks in the BM are basically cubes with the size defined according to certain 
parameters.  

"bulk density" The dry in-situ tonnage factor used to convert volumes to tonnage. Bulk density testwork 
is carried out on site and is relatively comprehensive, although samples of the more 
friable and broken portions of the mineralised zones are often unable to be measured 
with any degree of confidence, therefore caution is used when using the data.  Bulk 
density measurements are carried out on selected representative samples of whole drill 
core wherever possible.  The samples are dried and bulk density measured using the 
classical wax-coating and water immersion method.   

"cut off grade" The lowest grade value that is included in a resource statement. Must comply with JORC 
requirement "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" the lowest grade, or 
quality, of mineralised material that qualifies as economically mineable and available in a 
given deposit.  May be defined on the basis of economic evaluation, or on physical or 
chemical attributes that define an acceptable product specification.   

"diamond drilling, 
diamond core" 

Rotary drilling technique using diamond set or impregnated bits, to cut a solid, continuous 
core sample of the rock.  The core sample is retrieved to the surface, in a core barrel, by 
a wireline. 

"down-hole survey" Drillhole deviation as surveyed down-hole by using a conventional single-shot camera 
and readings taken at regular depth intervals, usually every 50 metres. 

"drill-hole database" The drilling, surveying, geological and analyses database is produced by qualified 
personnel and is compiled, validated and maintained in digital and hardcopy formats. 

"g/t" grams per tonne, equivalent to parts per million 

"g/t Au" grams of gold per tone 

"gold assay" Gold analysis should be carried out by an independent accredited laboratory by classical 
'Screen Fire Assay' technique that involves sieving a 900-1,000 gram sample to 200 
mesh (~75microns).  The entire oversize and duplicate undersize fractions are fire 
assayed and the weighted average gold grade calculated.  This is one of the most 
appropriate methods for determining gold content if there is a 'coarse gold' component to 
the mineralization. 

"grade cap, also 
called top cut" 

The maximum value assigned to individual informing sample composites to reduce bias in 
the resource estimate.  They are capped to prevent over estimation of the total resource 
as they exert an undue statistical weight. Capped samples may represent "outliers" or a 
small high-grade portion that is volumetrically too small to be separately domained. 

"inverse distance 
estimation" 

It asserts that samples closer to the point of estimation are more likely to be similar to the 
sample at the estimation point than samples further away. Samples closer to the point of 
estimation are collected and weighted according to the inverse of their separation from 



  

Mineral Resource Estimate Update Taysan Project 
September 2011 

 

Page 141 of 142 

the point of estimation, so samples closer to the point of estimation receive a higher 
weight than samples further away.  
The inverse distance weights can also be raised to a power, generally 2 (also called 
inverse distance squared). The higher the power, the more weight is assigned to the 
closer value. A power of 2 was used in the estimate used for comparison with the OK 
estimates. 

"JORC" The Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves, 2004 (the "JORC Code" or "the Code").  The Code sets out minimum 
standards, recommendations and guidelines for Public Reporting in Australasia of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.  The definitions in the JORC 
Code are either identical to, or not materially different from, those similar codes, 
guidelines and standards published and adopted by the relevant professional bodies in 
Australia, Canada, South Africa, USA, UK, Ireland and many countries in Europe. 

"JORC or NI43-101 
Inferred Resource" 

That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be 
estimated with a low level of confidence.  It is inferred from geological evidence and 
assumed but not verified geological and/or grade continuity.  It is based on information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability. 

"JORC or NI43-101 
Indicated Resource" 
 

That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of 
confidence.  It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes.  The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or 
grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed. 

"JORC or NI43-101 
Measured 
Resource" 

That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of 
confidence.  It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  The locations are spaced closely enough to 
confirm geological and grade continuity. 

"kriging 
neighbourhood 
analysis, or KNA" 

The methodology for quantitatively assessing the suitability of a kriging neighbourhood 
involves some simple tests. It has been argued that KNA is a mandatory step in setting up 
any kriging estimate. Kriging is commonly described as a "minimum variance estimator" 
but this is only true when the block size and neighbourhood are properly defined. The 
objective of KNA is to determine the combination of search neighbourhood and block size 
that will result in conditional unbiasedness. 

"lb" Avoirdupois pound (= 453.59237 grams). Mlb = million avoirdupois pounds 

"micron (Âµ)" Unit of length (= one thousandth of a millimetre or one millionth of a metre). 

"Mineral Resource" A concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the 
Earth's crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics 
and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of 
increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories when 
reporting under JORC or NI43-101. 

"Mo" Chemical symbol for molybdenum 

"nearest neighbour 
estimation" 
"Inferred" 

Nearest Neighbour assigns values to blocks in the model by assigning the values from 
the nearest sample point to the block attribute of interest. That part of a Mineral Resource 
for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of 
confidence.  It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified 
geological and/or grade continuity.  It is based on information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drillholes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability. 

"ordinary Kriging 
estimation, or "OK" 

Kriging is an inverse distance weighting technique where weights are selected via the 
variogram according to the samples distance and direction from the point of estimation. 
The weights are not only derived from the distance between samples and the block to be 
estimated, but also the distance between the samples themselves. This tends to give 
much lower weights to individual samples in an area where the samples are clustered.  
OK is known as the "best linear unbiased estimator. The kriging estimates are controlled 
by the variogram parameters. The variogram model parameters are interpreted from the

data while the search parameters are optimised during kriging neighbourhood analysis. 

"oz" Troy ounce (= 31.103477 grams). Moz = million troy ounces 

"QA/QC" Quality Assurance/Quality Control. The procedures for sample collection, analysis and 
storage. Drill samples are despatched to 'certified' independent analytical laboratories for 
analyses.  Blanks, Duplicates and Certified Reference Material samples are included with 
each batch of drill samples as part of the Company's QA/QC programme. Mining 
Associates, as part of database management, monitors the results on a batch-by-batch 
basis. 

"RC drilling" Reverse Circulation drilling.  A method of rotary drilling in which the sample is returned to 
the surface, using compressed air, inside the inner-tube of the drill-rod.  A face-sampling 
hammer is used to penetrate the rock and provide crushed and pulverised sample to the 
surface without contamination. 

"survey" Comprehensive surveying of drillhole positions, topography, and other cadastral features. 
Locations are usually stored in both local drill grid and UTM coordinates. 

"t"  Tonne (= 1 million grams) 

"variogram" The Variogram (or more accurately the Semi-variogram) is a method of displaying and 
modelling the difference in grade between two samples separated by a distance h, called 
the "lag" distance.  It provides the mathematical model of variation with distance upon 
which the Krige estimation method is based. 

"wireframe" This is created by using triangulation to produce an isometric projection of, for example, a 
rock type, mineralization envelope or an underground stope.  Volumes can be determined 
directly of each solid.
