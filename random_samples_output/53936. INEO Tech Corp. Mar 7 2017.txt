1.0 SUMMARY 
 
Kristian Whitehead. P.Geo. ("the author") was retained by Metron Capital Corp. ("MCC" 
or "the Company") to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Metron Big 
Smokey Valley (BSV) Brine Lithium Property ("the Property"). The purpose of the report 
is to meet the Toronto Stock Exchange's listing requirements and to support future 
financings.       
 
The Property is located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometres) from Tonopah in 
Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA and is about 50 kilometres to the west of Goldfield, the 
County Seat of Esmeralda County. The property consists of 100 placer claims located in 
Townships 1 and 2, Range 38, and 38 ½ East, Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA. Each claim 
is approximately 20 acres with a total combined property area of 2,000 acres, configured 
within two blocks. Metron has an option to acquire 100% interest in the property 
through cash payments, issuing shares and work commitment. 
 
The South Big Smokey Valley area is a typical internally drained valley hemmed in by 
mountains, low foothills, and broad alluvial fans. Limestone, quartzite, slate, and schist, 
aggregating several thousand feet in thickness and ranging in age from Lower Cambrian 
to Carboniferous which are the oldest rocks found in this region. Since their deposition, 
they have been extensively deformed, eroded, intruded by lavas, and largely covered by 
igneous bodies and sedimentary deposits. Originally, they probably covered the entire 
region, but at present they are found over extensive areas only in the Toyabe, Toquima, 
Silver Peak, and Lone Mountain ranges. The Quaternary deposits are generally 
comprised of the soils of uplands and mountains, soils of valley fills, outwash plains and 
alluvial fans, soils on alluvial fans and aprons, as well as playas and soils on flats and 
basins. The playas soils are moderate to poorly drained and have a desirable character 
for potential development of brines and accumulation of lithium. 
 
The Late Miocene to Pliocene tuffaceous lacustrine facies of the Esmeralda Formation is 
documented to contain up to 1,300 ppm lithium with an overall average of 100 ppm 
lithium. 2015 surface sampling by Ultra Lithium indicated up to 100 ppm lithium in lake 
sediments which represent typical soils of Playas on Flats and Basins. 
 
In 1980, United States Geological Survey carried out an investigation for potential 
lithium bearing brines in and around Clayton Valley as part of regional study related to 
lithium supply sources. Big Smokey Valley was also part of this study where two reverse 
circulatory drill holes (BS13 and BS 14) were drilled just outside the current Property.  In 
BS 13, a maximum value of 1.7 ppm Li was reported in a water sample and 364 ppm in 
sediment samples. Bore-hole 14 was abandoned after drilling 215 feet (66 m) into 
unconsolidated sand and gravel. A maximum of 1.3 ppm Li was reported in a water 
sample and 287 ppm in sediment samples. 
 

Ultra Lithium Inc. carried out ground geophysical survey in 2014, as well as a subsequent 
soil and water sampling program in 2015. The ground geophysical survey consisted of 



Page 6 of 76 

eight CSAMT survey lines (called Lines A through H) covering 53.8 kilometers. Lines C, D, 
E and F are partially or fully located on the Property. The survey results indicate that, in 
northeastern area, the lowest resistivities are indicated south of Line E, in the vicinity of 
station 6200 on Line F and from station 9400 on Line C to station 2800 on Line D. 
Evidence for faulting is very tentative in this area, and the depth of investigation does 
not extend as deeply as on the southwestern lines.  
 
On December 11-18, 2015, a soil and water sampling program completed by Ultra 
Lithium was aimed at following up on the results of the CSAMT ground geophysical 
survey, with its purpose to investigate the presence of lithium in shallow soil, and 
characterize its groundwater system. A total of 48 soil / sediment samples were 
collected to cover survey lines A to H. Additionally, five water samples were collected 
from different areas, of which four were collected from surface water / ice and one 
from a water well, located on adjacent ground to the Property. The results confirmed 
the presence of lithium in the South Big Smokey hydrogeological system. Of particular 
interest is the area contained within geophysical survey lines C, D, E and F. Maximum 
assay values derived from these sediments reported 100 ppm lithium, 480 ppm boron, 
and 7,600 ppm potassium. Generally, lithium, boron and potassium values correspond 
well with each other, where samples with higher lithium concentrations yield higher 
values of other two elements.  
 
In May 2016, Ultra Lithium Inc. completed one HQ diameter diamond core drill hole on 
the Property. The hole was drilled down to 1,000 feet (305 metres). Drilling was limited 
to 1,000 feet (305 metres) due to artesian water pressure. The hole was later reamed to 
a six-inch diameter and a monitoring well was installed to a depth of 500 feet, with 3-
inch diameter screen located in the bottom 120 feet. The results of 22 drill core samples 
collected from the hole BSH16-01 indicate maximum values for lithium of 270 parts per 
million (ppm), 410 ppm boron, 10,000 ppm potassium, and 12,000 ppm magnesium; 
whereas the average lithium concentration in all core samples is 131 ppm, 151 ppm 
boron, 5,575 ppm potassium, and 6,210 ppm magnesium.  One sample from a 10-cm 
gypsum layer yielded a lithium value below the detection limit. These samples were 
taken at various depth intervals down to 1,000 feet (305 metres) below ground surface. 
Two rounds of groundwater sampling from this well yielded lithium values of 1 ppm or 
less. Total exploration expenditures for this drill hole were $165,394.58 USD 
($215,012.95 CAD) paid by Ultra Lithium Inc. 
 
The author visited the Property on December 3, 2016, and the geological work 
performed in order to verify the existing data consisted of visiting existing drill hole on 
the Property (BSH16-01), examining rock outcrops and lake sediments areas of the Big 
Smokey Valley, taking geological and hydrogeological observations, and observing 
several claim posts. The drill core for hole BSH16-01 is stored at a locked storage unit 
located in Tonopah. The author viewed various core sections and collected five 
representative samples from selected intervals.  The sample assay results indicated 
lithium values in the range of 192 to 357 ppm, boron 97 to 230 ppm, potassium 7200 to 
12000 ppm, and magnesium 7200 to 13000 ppm.

Continental brines are the most common type of brine deposits located in saline desert 
basins (also known as salt lakes, salt flats or salars). They are located near tertiary or 
recent volcanoes and are made up of sand, minerals with brine and saline water with 
high concentrations of dissolved salts. A playa is a brine deposit whose surface is 
composed mostly of silts and clays which contain less salt than a salar. The South Big 
Smokey Valley brine lithium property has characteristics of a playa type brine deposit 
model. It shares geological similarities with the Clayton Valley which hosts the only 
lithium producing brine operation in North America.  
 
The Property is located in an active mining and mineral exploration region where many 
operators carried out lithium exploration and/ or development work on adjacent 
properties. The Silver Peak brine lithium mine located on the adjacent Clayton Valley, 
currently operated by Rockwood is located approximately 25 kilometres to the southeast 
of the Property. Similarly, Pure Energy Minerals is working on the southern part of Clayton 
Valley, adjacent to the south extent of the Silver Peak mine.  
 
The Property has good year-round road access from Tonopah Station through highway 
6/95. Highway 265 to Silver Peak branches off from 6/95 and crosses the southwestern 
part of the Property.  The source of water is groundwater exclusive and power is readily 
available locally. 
 
The present report is based on available data in the public domain, reports from Metron 
Capital Corp., published reports by the US Geological Survey, and personal observations. 
All consulted sources are listed in the references section.  The sources of the maps are 
noted on the individual figures.  All consulted data sources are deemed reliable. The 
data collected during the course of present study is considered sufficient to provide an 
opinion about the merit of the Property and deemed a viable exploration target.  
 
Based on the favourable geological, hydrogeological and tectonic setting, presence of 
anomalous surface lithium values, and the results of present study, it is concluded that 
the Property is a property of merit and possess a good potential for a discovery of 
lithium brine mineralization.  The Property has good road access, readily available 
exploration and mining services locally available as well as nearby power and water 
resources to support mining activities. The author is of the opinion that the present 
study has met it original objectives.    
 

Recommendations 
In the qualified person's opinion, the character of the South Big Smokey Valley Property 
is sufficient to merit a follow-up work program. This can be accomplished through a 
two-phase exploration program, where each phase is contingent upon the results of the 
previous phase.

Phase 1 – Surface Sampling and Drilling 
A total of 12 samples were collected from the property during 2015 surface soil 
sampling program. This sampling identified anomalous values of lithium, and requires a 
follow up detailed surface sampling to get better coverage of the property area.  
 
The ground geophysical CSAMT survey and soil sampling program has identified various 
distinct potential brine targets for drilling. The lowest resistivities are indicated south of 
Line E, in the vicinity of station 6200 on Line F and from station 9400 on Line C to station 
2800 on Line D. The drill hole BSH16-01 was drilled at location C9700 where core 
samples indicated anomalous lithium values however groundwater samples reported 
low lithium values (1 ppm and below). To test the CSAMT target at line D, one single drill 
hole is proposed at station D2350 down to a depth of 2,200 feet (670 m). All 
hydrogeological units intercepted during drilling should be sampled via soil and 
groundwater testing for lithium, boron, potassium and magnesium. A water well should 
be installed at this borehole location to support water sampling, downhole geophysical 
logging, pumping tests, permeability tests and other hydrogeological studies. 
 

The estimated cost of this program is USD $309,334 (CAD $412,445) and will take an 
estimated 8 to 12 weeks to complete. 
 

Phase 2 – Detailed Drilling 
Based on the results of Phase 1 program, an additional 5-hole drill program should be 
completed on the Property. A scope of work, location of drill holes and budget for Phase 
2 will be prepared after reviewing the results of Phase 1 drill program.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The author has relied on the records and copies of records provided by Metron Capital 
Corp. to verify the claim data. A limited search of tenure data on the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) website LR2000 on December 10, 2016, conforms to the data 
supplied by Metron Capital Corp. However, the limited research by the author does not 
express a legal opinion as to the ownership status of the Property. This disclaimer 
applies to ownership information relating to the Property, and the information is 
available in Section 1 (Summary) and Section 4 (Property Description and Location) of 
this report.  
 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Property is located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometres) from Tonopah in 
Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA (Figure 1). It is about 50 kilometres to the west of 
Goldfield, the County Seat of Esmeralda County. It consists of 100 placer claims located 
in Townships 1 and 2, Range 38 and 38 ½ East, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Each claim is 
approximately 20 acres with a total property area of 2,000 acres, configured in two claim 
blocks (Metron 1 and 2).  Claim data is summarized in Table 1, while map showing the 
claims is presented in Figures 2 and 3.   
 
The Property was acquired through an option agreement signed on December 2, 2016 
between Ultra Lithium Inc. and Metron Capital Corp. Under the terms of the agreement

Metron Capital Corp. will then have earned a 100% interest in the said Claims after 
completing the 3rd year cash payments, share payments and work commitment. The 
Optionor will provide Metron Capital Corp. with a fully executed claim transfer following 
completion of the 3rd year cash and share payments. 
 
Metron Capital Corp. will pay to the Optionor a royalty equal to three percent 3% Gross 
Overriding Royalty (GOR) from this property with a 5km area of interest around these said 
claims. The Royalty will be payable for as long as Metron Capital Corp. and/or its successors 
and assigns hold any interest in the claims. Metron Capital Corp. will have a right to 
purchase a 1% NSR for $1,500,000, at any time up to when a production decision is made. 
 

Mineral deposits subject to placer claims include all those deposits not subject to lode 
claims. Originally, these included only deposits of unconsolidated materials, such as 
sand and gravel, containing free gold or other minerals. By Congressional acts and 
judicial interpretations, many nonmetallic bedded or layered deposits, such as gypsum, 
lithium, and high calcium limestone, are also considered placer deposits. 
 
Placer claims, where practicable, are located by legal subdivision (for example: 
Township 10 South, Range 11 East, Section 9, SE1/4). The maximum size of a placer 
claim is 20 acres per locator. An association of two locators may locate 40 acres, and 
three may locate 60 acres, etc. The maximum area of an association placer claim is 160 
acres for eight or more persons. Corporations may not locate association placer claims 
unless they are in association with other private individuals or other corporations as co-
locators.

In addition to filing with the BLM, the claim holder is required to file an Affidavit of 
Assessment Work or Notice of Intent to Hold with the county recorder's office by 
September 30

th
. The location of this office will always be in the county seat of the county 

in which the claims are situated (Esmeralda County office located in Goldfield). 
  
A Notice of Intent permitting process is required to carry out the recommended work 
program. This process entails providing a short description of the proposed works, plus 
supporting drawings and accompanying bonding, until such time that the works are 
complete and the area is reclaimed to its previous condition. A minimum bond required is 
$3,000 but the actual bond amount is based upon the type of exploration and the degree 
of disturbance. A Notice of Intent permit application has been approved by BLM for Phase 
1 recommended work program.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 Access  
 
The Property has good year-round road access from Tonopah Station through highway 
6/95 (Figure 2). Tonopah Station is a local commercial town located half way between 
Las Vegas and Reno on US Route 95 which is a major highway traversing north-south the 
State of Nevada. Highway 265 to Silver Peak branches off from 6/95 and crosses the 
southwestern part of the Property. Tonopah is connected with Las Vegas through 198-
mile-long railroad which is a part of the Union Pacific Railroad and serves as their 
mainline between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. 
 
From highways 6/95 and 265, numerous gravel roads traverse through different areas of 
the Property providing access to various claim blocks.  
 

5.2 Climate 
 
The climate of the Big Smokey Valley, like Nevada's in general, is characterized by bright 
sunshine, clean and clear air, low, annual rainfall in the valleys and deserts, and variable 
heavy snow in the higher mountains. Annual average precipitation in the state as a 
whole is close to 9 inches, about one-half of which falls between December and March. 
January is the wettest month; August, the driest. Over a 24-year period, precipitation 
records during the first half of the twentieth century for Millett, a former stage station 
and town site at the north end of Smokey Valley, show an average of 6 inches per year, 
ranging from 2.45 to 8.67 inches (McCracken 1997). Maximum summer temperatures 
can reach over 90°F (32.2 C°) during the months of July and August, whereas the winter 
temperature can drop below 10°F (-12.2 C°) in December and January. Exploration work 
can be carried out around the year. Some frozen surface water was observed in parts of 
the valley during the current field visit in December.

5.3 Physiography 
 
The Property is part of the South Big Smokey Valley which is located within the Basin 
and Range physiographic province of Nevada, an arid region throughout, characterized 
by numerous disconnected mountain ranges, low foothills, and broad alluvial fans. The 
ranges are primarily the result of faulting and uplifting of large blocks of the earth's 
crust.  
 
The South Big Smokey Valley is bordered on the east by the San Antonio Mountains, an 
irregular mountain mass about 30 miles (48km) long beginning just south of the 
Toquima; the highest point is 8500 feet (2591 m). The southern terminus of the valley is 
formed by Lone Mountain, a conspicuous solitary peak with a precipitous slope that 
rises to 9114 feet (2778 m). The Silver Peak Range, the border on the southwest, is wide 
and rather high, separating Smokey Valley from Fish Lake Valley to the south; its highest 
point is Piper Peak, at 9447 feet (2879 m). The Monte Cristo Range, which creates the 
western border of the 'lower valley', reaches 7997 feet (2437); with little timber or 



Page 21 of 76 

vegetation, it appears desiccated. Lone Valley, lying west of the southern end of Smokey 
Valley, has a drainage basin of about 500 square miles (1295 square km) that drains into 
the South Big Smokey Valley (McCracken 1997). 
  
Streams formed by snowmelt and occasional heavy rains have carved canyons of various 
sizes in the mountain walls enclosing the Big Smokey Valley, and at the mouth of each 
canyon that discharges water, a large alluvial fan has formed. Small gravelly fans that 
end abruptly and have little or no arable land are found at the mouths of the small dry 
canyons, and expanded, gently sloping fans are found at the mouths of the large 
canyons.

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The Property is located approximately 40 kilometers from the town of Tonopah which is 
also County Seat of Nye County. Tonopah is a historic mining town which experienced a 
silver rush at the turn of Twentieth Century and was named "Queen of the Silver 
Camps".  According to 2010 census data, the town had a population of 2,476. There are 
a few hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses to support the needs of 
an exploration program. The small town of Silver Peak is located approximately 25 
kilometers from the Property. Silver Peak lies near Clayton Valley which is currently the 
only operating source of lithium in the United States.    
 
Mining personnel are available locally, whereas, the other specialized services like 
ground and airborne geophysical survey and drilling companies normally send their own 
crews. Groundwater is a potential source of water for any mining operations on the 
Property. Historical water wells located on adjacent grounds indicate water is available 
from depths of 14 to over 100 feet.  Several powerlines are located on the property and 
on adjacent areas.

6.0 HISTORY  
 

6.1 General History 
 
In 1980, the United States Geological Survey carried out an investigation for potential 
lithium bearing brines in and around the Clayton Valley as part of regional study related 
to lithium supply sources. The Big Smokey Valley was also part of this study due to the 
fact that it is one of the largest intermontane valleys in Nevada and was occupied by 
two large lakes during the Pleistocene. The southern lake was 22 miles (35 km) long by 
5.5 miles (9 km) wide and covered an area estimated to be 85 square miles (211 km

2
) to 

a maximum depth of approximately 70 feet (21 m). A series of gravelly beach ridges 
encircled the southwestern part of the ancient lake, enclosing a playa characterized by 
soft, puffy, unconsolidated, silty and clayey lake sediments.  
 
Two reverse circulatory drill holes (BS 13 and BS 14) were drilled in the Big Smokey 
Valley. Both holes were located outside the Property, where BS 13 was located on a 
power line right-of-way road, and BS 14 was located on a beach ridge on the 
southwestern edge of the playa. BS 13 was completed to a depth of 675 feet (206 m), of 
which 655 feet (199 m) was in alluvial valley fill and the last 20 feet (7 m) was in the 
consolidated sedimentary rocks of the Esmeralda Formation of Miocene age. This 
complete penetration of the valley fill was helpful in the interpretation of the results of 
water analyses. A maximum value of 1.7 ppm Li was found in a water sample with a Li-Cl 
ratio of 0.0027 at a depth of 395 feet (120 m). BS 14 was abandoned after drilling 215 
feet (66 m) into unconsolidated sand and gravel. A maximum of 1.3 ppm Li was found in 
a water sample with a Li-Cl ratio of 0.0031 at a depth of 135 feet (41 m)(Vine 1980).

6.2 Work by Ultra Lithium Inc. 
 
Ultra Lithium Inc. ("ULI") carried out a ground geophysical survey in 2014, soil and water 
sampling program in 2015, and a diamond drilling program in 2016. The following 
sections provide a summary of each work on the Property.  

6.2.1 Ground Geophysics 

In 2014, ULI contracted Zonge International to complete a CSAMT (Controlled Source 
Audio-Frequency Magneto-telluric) ground geophysical survey program on the Property. 



Page 24 of 76 

This geophysical survey is a non-intrusive, low-impact method which is considered 
suitable for mineral and groundwater exploration purposes.   
 
This survey consisted of eight CSAMT survey lines (named Lines A through H) covering 
53.8 kilometers of data. A station spacing and electric-field dipole size of 100 meters 
was used on all lines except Line E, for which a station spacing and e-field dipole size of 
200 m was used. The location of the lines and stations are shown on Figure 2. 
 
CSAMT is a surface-based electromagnetic method that provides subsurface electrical 
resistivity information, which can often be related to changes in pore space and pore 
fluids. Bedrock is often high resistivity relative to overlying material, and fractured, 
saturated bedrock is often lower resistivity than un-fractured bedrock. Areas of high TDS 
in the groundwater appear more conductive than equivalent areas of low TDS. 
Variations in depth to bedrock, faulting, and other structural changes are often also 
evident as changes in resistivity. In nearby Clayton Valley, lithium-bearing brines are 
known to be very low resistivity. The goal of the CSAMT survey was to delineate the 
extent and depth of very low resistivities, and to map, if possible, faults that may 
influence brine accumulation.

Geophysical Survey Results 

The survey results are included as cross sections of 2D inversion model results (Figures 7 
to 10), with station numbers (in meters) across the top and elevation (in meters) down 



Page 25 of 76 

the side. Pertinent culture and reference points are shown along the line topography. 
Resistivity values are shown in ohm-meters, contoured logarithmically, with low 
resistivities shaded toward the red end of the spectrum and high resistivities shaded 
toward the blue. All resistivity cross sections are shaded using the same scale for 
comparison. Transparent black dashed lines indicate possible faults evident in the data.  
 

In general, resistivity values are realistic and consistent with data acquired over other 
playas in Nevada, ranging from hundreds of ohm-meters to less than one ohm-meter. 
Moderate and high resistivities are seen in the near surface and toward the edges of the 
playa, and very low resistivities are seen in some areas, usually as layers rather than as 
small, localized features. For discussion purposes, the 1.0 ohm-meter contour line is 
thicker and bold on these cross sections to highlight the areas of lowest resistivities, but 
this is not intended to necessarily indicate an outline of lithium-bearing brine. 
 
Interpretation of Lines C, D, E, and F: 
The area of geophysical survey lines C, D, E, and F is topographically lower and is visually 
different at the surface with lighter, fine grained materials as well as sand dunes. Line E 
runs perpendicular to Line F, moving from darker surface material north of the playa, 
crossing the very light playa material, and back to darker surface material on the 
southeast, providing a good cross section of the feature. Line C started at a small 
outcrop of volcanic material on the west, which ran east-southeast to Line E; following a 
bend in the line at Line E, the line continues as Line D to the southeast.  
 
The resistivity modeling results for Lines C and D are shown on Figure 7. Roads were 
crossed on Line C at stations 1750 and 3000, but otherwise no other cultural features 
were noted by the field crews. Note that due to the overall lower resistivities, bedrock is 
not evident except on the northwestern end of Line C. Resistivities generally decrease 
from the northwestern end of the line to the southeast. Surface resistivity are lowest on 
Line C from station 8600 to station 1300 Line D, but the lowest resistivities at depth are 
offset further southeast, from station 9400 of Line C to 2800 on Line D. This is consistent 
with the data from Line F, which also shows the deep lowest resistivities to be south of 
Line E. It is possible that the zone of lowest resistivities from station 9400 on Line C to 
station 2800 on Line D is bounded by faults in the vicinity of station 9400 and 2900, but 
this is difficult to interpret in the absence of any data extending into bedrock.  
 
For Line E, station spacing was 200 meters due to budget constraints. In the presence of 
low resistivities along most of the line, the depth of investigation is limited to only 600 
meters on the southern segment, and approximately 800 meters on the northern 
segment. From the southwestern end of the line to approximately station 14500 surface 
resistivities are very low, as would be expected from the playa material. Along this 
segment of the line, low resistivities extend to the depth of the survey, though a thin 
moderately resistive layer is evident in the upper 150 m along the line, suggesting a 
layer of more competent, perhaps dryer material. The data on this line is in good 
agreement with the data at the intersections with the other lines, although the thin 
resistive layer is less evident on Line C-D than it is on Line E. Northeast of station 14500, 



Page 26 of 76 

near-surface resistivities are more moderate, the deep low resistivities weaken and 
become gradually shallower, underlain by moderately high resistivities, interpreted as 
bedrock. At the north end of the line a low resistivity layer is of a narrow width, located 
approximately 300 m deep. In the absence of deeper bedrock information along this 
line, faults are difficult to interpret, though faults in the vicinity of station 5800, 8500, 
12100, and 13300 may be interpreted based on subtle changes seen in the resistivity 
values collected.

Figure 9: Geophysical line E (Extension) 

 

Figure 10: Geophysical line F 

Line F ran from northwest to southeast, intersecting Line E at station 10000 (Figure 6). 
This line crossed a powerline on the northwest end of the line near Highway 6/95, but 
only minor effects are seen in the data. Low resistivities are seen at the surface as the 
line crosses the playa from about station 4900 to 7500, and moderate surface 
resistivities are evident north and south of the playa. Similar to some of the other lines, 
thin alternating layers of high and low resistivities are seen in the upper 200 meters. A 
fault is mapped at station 3600, and a second nearby fault would intersect the line at 
station 4100 if it were extended through interpretation. A very low resistivity zone (< 1 
ohm-meter) in the deeper data is bounded by these two mapped faults, however the 
change in the data is relatively subtle, and the correlation is considered tentative. 
Additional low, deep resistivities are evident just southwest of the intersection with Line 
E, from station 5900 to 6600. This zone is consistent with the data seen on Lines C-D, in 
which low, deep resistivities are seen south of Line E.

6.2.2 2015 Soil and Water Sampling 

In December 2015, Afzaal Pirzada, P.Geo. (currently VP Exploration of Ultra Lithium) was 
contracted by Ultra Lithium to conduct exploration work on the Property which included 
collecting surface soil samples along 2014 CSAMT geophysical survey lines. The sampling 
program was aimed at following up on the results of the CSAMT ground geophysical 
survey, and its purpose was to investigate the presence of lithium in shallow soil, and 
within its groundwater system. A total of 48 soil / sediment samples were collected to 
cover survey lines A to H. Additionally, five water samples were collected from different 
areas, out of which four were from surface water / ice and one from a water well, 
located on adjacent ground to the Property. The soil samples were collected using hand 
shovel or a mechanical auger which was able to penetrate 1 to 5 feet below ground 
surface. The sampling work commenced from December 11-18, 2015. All the samples 
were shipped to Western Environmental Testing Laboratory (WETLABS) in Sparks, 
Nevada. Below are the highlights of geological work and field sampling program. 

 Conducted traverses around the property and the surrounding areas to get 
familiar with the overall geological setting of the Big Smokey Valley (BSV), Silver 
Peak operational area of Rockwood Holdings, and Clayton Valley. 

 Carried out detailed traverses along the ground geophysical survey (CSAMT) lines 
conducted by Zonge International noting general soil, hydrogeology and 
geotechnical conditions.   

 Hydrogeological observations confirming the Property is within an area of the Big 
Smokey Valley (BSV) which is an enclosed basin which receives its water 
recharge from the surrounding ranges. The rocks on the southeastern part of 
BSV were observed to be dipping inwards towards the basin. Overall slope of the 
basin is to the southwest.  

 Traverses along the geophysical survey lines indicated subsurface sediments 
generally composed of silty clay, silty sand and gravel. The amount of 
volocanogenic material and salt varies from place to place but overall it was 
observed in a majority of the claims held by Ultra Lithium. At several locations, 
the top sections of sediments are covered by pebbles of broken rocks derived of 
surrounding outcrops.   

 During a brief visit to the Clayton Valley and Silver Peak brine lithium mine it was 
observed that distinct layers of white to light grey colour volcanic ash beds 
surround the Clayton Valley. These ash beds continued to the north, towards the 
South Big Smokey Valley (BSV). Volcanic ash material observed in both valleys 
appeared very similar. Outcrops of rhyolite which were observed in the Clayton 
Valley were not very prominent in BSV.   

 

Geophysical Line A (Not on the Property) 

 A total of nine stations (A 2000, A 2500, A 3000, A 3500, A 4000, A 4500, A 5000, 
A 5500, and A 6000) were sampled along this line at 500 m spacing. A brown clay 



Page 29 of 76 

horizon with a mixture of volcanic ash material, considered prospective for 
lithium was intercepted at station A 2000, A 3500, A 4000, A 5500, and A 6000.  

 

Geophysical Line F (Partly on the Property) 

 Seven stations (F 4000, F 4500, F 5000, F 5500, F 6000, F6500, and F7000) were 
sampled along these lines at 500 m interval. A light grey clay unit mixed with 
volcanic ash material, considered an ideal geological marker for lithium 
exploration was intercepted in all stations except for F 6500 and F7000, located 
on the east margin of BSV. The clay unit is exposed on surface in the middle of 
the valley on stations F 4500, F5500, and F 6000. All thin water layers in the 
central portion of BSV are frozen due to severe winter weather conditions. One 
ice sample was broken at station F6000 and collected as a water sample. 

 

Geophysical Line E (Partly on the Property) 

 Three stations along this line were sampled (E 7800, E 8400, and E 9000). A grey 
clay layer with volcanic as material was intercepted at each of the three stations 
at depths ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 feet, and the top was found to be covered with 
brown silty sand with some gravel. This clay layer is very sticky and plastic where 
damp or moist.  

Geophysical Line B (Not on the Property) 

 A total of eight stations (B 2500, B 3000, B 3500, B 4000, B 4500, B 5000, B 6000, 
and B 6500) were sampled along this line at 500 m spacing, except for station B 
5500 which was not sampled due to duplication as it was located at intersection 
with Line A. This line is marked by brown silty sand and gravel from surface to 
four feet in depth. It does not present a favorable surface horizon in terms of 
lithium accumulation as very little silt, clay or volcanic ash material was 
encountered during investigations.  

Geophysical Line C (Partly on the Property) 

 Eight stations (C 5000, C 5500, C 6000, C 6500, C 7000, C 7500, C 8000, and C 
9600) were sampled along this line at approximately 500 m intervals. The area 
between station C 8000 and C 9600 was not sampled due to intervening staked 
claims by a third party. A light grey clay unit mixed with volcanic ash material, 
considered interesting for lithium exploration was intercepted in all stations. At 
stations C 5000 and C 9600, this unit was covered by a 1-3 feet layer of brown 
silty sand and gravel.  This accumulation is a result of their locations being at the 
margins of the central part of BSV.  This promising grey clay unit is exposed on 
surface, within the middle of the valley, as well as, on all the stations except for 
the two mentioned above.  

Geophysical Line D (Partly on the Property) 



Page 30 of 76 

 This line is in the southern extension of geophysical line C and runs almost 
parallel to line F. Five stations (D 1100, D 1500, D 2000, D 2500, and D 30000 
were sampled along this line at 500 m or less intervals. A light grey clay unit 
mixed with volcanic ash material, considered interesting for lithium exploration 
was intercepted at stations D 1100 and D 1500, whereas the remaining stations 
intersected brown and grey silty sand with some gravel due to their location on 
the east margin of BSV. 

Geophysical Line E (Partly on the Property) 

 Six stations (E 4800, E 5400, E 5600, E 7800, E 8400, and E 9000) were sampled 
along this line. A grey clay layer with volcanics was intercepted at two stations (E 
5400 and E 4800) down to a depth of 3-5 feet. The surface was covered with 
brown silty sand with minor gravel. The clay layer is very sticky and plastic where 
damp or moist. This unit was not encountered at station E 5600 as the auger was 
not able to penetrate below 3 feet at this location. 

Water Sampling 

Four of the five water samples collected represent surface water composition which is 
essentially a perched water table most likely due to the presence of a grey volcanogenic 
clay layer starting from surface or a few feet below surface. The water well which was 
the fifth sample has water table at 14 feet below ground surface (17 feet at top of 
casing) as measured on December 17, 2015.  As there is no lithological data for this well 
it is not possible to comment on this water table as confined or unconfined.  
 

In conclusion, the shallow surface observations in the immediate area of geophysical 
lines C, D, E and F appear to be of sound prospect for additional lithium exploration. The 
area of lines A, B, G and H represents sand and gravel at shallow subsurface at the 
majority of the locations. A thin layer of volcanic clay was intercepted at few locations.

Assay Results and Interpretation 

The assay results confirmed the presence of lithium in the South Big Smokey 
hydrogeological system. Of particular interest is the area of geophysical survey lines C, 
D, E and F. Maximum values for lithium in sediments is 100 ppm, 480 ppm boron, and 
7,600 ppm potassium. Generally, the lithium, boron and potassium values corresponds 
well with each other, where the samples with higher lithium concentration have higher 
values of other two elements. A distinct geological similarity with Clayton Valley is the 
presence of volcanogenic clays in the South Big Smokey Valley. A brief summary of 
results is provided in the following paragraphs.   
 
The surface and shallow subsurface water samples show less than one mg/L value of 
lithium and low values of other three elements tested. Average lithium concentration in 
all soil / sediment samples is 47 mg/kg, boron 142 mg/kg, potassium 4,915 mg/kg, and 
magnesium 6,685 mg/kg.  
 
The area of lines A, B, G and H represents sand and gravel at shallow subsurface at 
majority of the sampling locations and represent a low lithium value on surface. 
Interpreted source of lithium is being contributed from the surrounding rocks as the 
historical sampling from Esmeralda Formation is documented to contain up to 1,300 
mg/kg Li with average 100 mg/kg Li (Munk and Chamberlain 2011).  
 



Page 32 of 76 

The present data, especially the water samples corresponds with similar investigations 
carried out on Clayton Valley by US Geological Survey (Munk and Chamberlain 2011) 
where the clay / sediment samples show average lithium concentration of 22 mg/kg, 
snow and fresh water samples have lithium values of less than 1 mg/L (ppm), and one of 
the brine aquifer (LAS Aquifer) 406.9 mg/L.  
 
The sampling data and results are presented in table 4, concentration of lithium is 
shown on Figure 11, boron on Figure 12, potassium on Figure 13, and magnesium on 
Figure 14.   
 

Geophysical Line A (Not on the Property) 

 The results of nine samples show low lithium and boron in soil / sediment 
samples, with a moderate concentration of potassium and magnesium. Lithium 
values are in the range of 14 to 48 mg/kg, boron 11 to 37 mg/kg, potassium 
3,700 to 7,600 mg/kg, and magnesium 3,300 to 7,900 mg/kg.   

 

Geophysical Line B (Not on the Property) 

 The results of eight samples show lithium in soil samples to be generally low, 
ranges from 14 mg/kg (ppm) to 45 mg/kg, boron 8.2 mg/kg to 80 mg/kg, 
potassium 1100 to 7600 mg/kg, and magnesium 2800 to 4400 mg/kg.  

 

Geophysical Line C (Partly on the Property) 

 The results of eight samples show that this line represents the best results for 
lithium, boron, and potassium. Magnesium level is also higher in samples. The 
assay results indicate lithium in the range of 50 to 100 mg/kg, boron 160 to 300 
mg/kg, potassium 4,000 to 6,400 mg/kg, and magnesium 5,900 to 9,400 mg/kg.   

 
Geophysical Line D (Partly on the Property) 

 This line is in the southern extension of geophysical line and its results represent 
low to moderate values of lithium, boron, and potassium potentially 
corresponding with ash layers, whereas magnesium concentration is moderate 
to higher. Concentration of lithium is in the range of 15 to 71 mg/kg, boron 82 to 
330 mg/kg, potassium 2,300 to 6,500 mg/kg, and magnesium 3,000 to 9,700 
mg/kg.   

 
Geophysical Line E (Partly on the Property) 

 The assay results yielded the most consistent values in soil / sediments along this 
line with very little variation. Concentration of lithium is in the range of 65 to 92 
mg/kg, boron 160 to 360 mg/kg, potassium 5,100 to 7,600 mg/kg, and 
magnesium 8,900 to 11,000 mg/kg.  

 



Page 33 of 76 

 

Geophysical Line F (Partly on the Property) 

 The soil / sediment samples from this line show a relatively wider range of 
concentration in all four elements tested. Lithium values are in the range of 16 to 
78 mg/kg, boron 34 to 480 mg/kg, potassium 2,400 to 6,300 mg/kg, and 
magnesium 3,200 to 11,000 mg/kg. 

 

Geophysical Line G (Not on the Property) 

 The assay results yielded low values of lithium and boron in soil / sediments. 
Concentration of lithium is in the range of 16 to 20 mg/kg, boron 16 to 20 mg/kg, 
potassium 2,900 to 5,000 mg/kg, and magnesium 3,900 to 8,400 mg/kg.  

 

Water Sampling (Not on the Property) 

Concentrations of all four elements tested in water samples was generally low 
representing freshwater conditions on the surface and shallow ground water. Lithium 
concentration in four surface water / ice samples was less than one mg/L (ppm) and in 
the water well sample the lithium value was below detection limit, boron 0.51 to 4 
mg/L, potassium 27 to 58 mg/L and magnesium reporting 4 to 92 mg/L.

6.2.3 Drilling 

In the early 2016, Ultra Lithium Inc. applied for drilling permit for three drill holes to the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and received notice-of-intent exploration work 
permit from to conduct Phase 1 exploratory drilling. ULI signed a drilling contract with 
Harris Exploration Drilling to complete one HQ size core drill hole on the Property. The 
drilling started on May 10, 2016 and the drilling contractor was only able to drill to 
1,000 feet (305 metres).  The hole was stopped due to artesian water pressure.  
 
Based on (CSAMT) geophysical survey data, two potential brine targets were interpreted 
at this borehole location. Drilling results confirmed that the first target continues down 
to approximately 500 feet (152 metres) below surface, whereas the second target 
begins at 700 feet (213 metres). The second target is expected to continue down to 
1,800 feet (549 metres) below surface which was the proposed depth of this hole.  The 
hole was reamed to a six-inch diameter and a monitoring well was installed down to a 
depth of 500 feet, with 3-inch diameter screen installed at the bottom 120 feet.  
 
The following are the highlights of the data collected from drill hole BSH16-01: 

 Results indicate anomalous values of lithium in drill core samples. The drill core 
logs show the presence of volcanic clays, organic matter and tuff at various 
depths which are documented to be contributed from Late Miocene to Pliocene 
tuffaceous lacustrine facies of the Esmeralda Formation.  Several geological 
studies consider the Esmeralda Formation to be the source of lithium brine in 
the South Big Smokey and Clayton valleys. There are a few gypsum layers within 
sand and clay layers. The amount of volcanic material and tuffs increases with 
depth.  

 The drill core data shows the presence of multiple sand aquifers down to a 
drilled depth of 1,000 feet (305 metres) below surface. Water levels as 
measured on June 04, 2016 was at 2 feet (0.6 meters) below ground surface 
indicating artesian water pressure from a confined aquifer at 349 to 479 feet 
(106 to 146 metres). The aquifer is comprised of sand with intervening thin clay 
layers.  

 Assays of groundwater samples taken at various intervals to a depth of 1,000 
feet (305 metres) using Harris Exploration's sampling technique indicated 
anomalous values of lithium. Later sampling after well development and purging 
indicated lithium values of 1 ppm and lower. 

 
The results of 22 drill core samples from the hole BSH16-01 indicate maximum values 
for lithium of 270 parts per million (ppm), boron 410 ppm, potassium 10,000 ppm, and 
magnesium 12,000 ppm; whereas the average lithium concentration in all core samples 
is 131 ppm, boron 151 ppm, potassium 5,575 ppm, and magnesium 6,210 ppm.  One 
sample from a 10 cm gypsum layer yielded a lithium value below the detection limit. 
These samples were taken at various depth intervals down to 1,000 feet (305 meters)

below ground surface. Two rounds of groundwater sampling from this well indicated 
lithium values of 1 ppm or less.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 Regional Geology  
 
The South Big Smokey Valley area is a typical internally drained valley hemmed in by 
mountains, low foothills, and broad alluvial fans. Limestone, quartzite, slate, and schist, 
aggregating several thousand feet in thickness and ranging in age from Lower Cambrian 
to Carboniferous are the oldest rocks found in this region. Since their deposition, they 
have been extensively deformed, eroded, intruded by lavas, and largely covered by 
igneous bodies and sedimentary deposits. Originally, they probably covered the entire 
region, but at present they are found over extensive areas only in the Toyabe, Toquima, 
Silver Peak, and Lone Mountain ranges.  
 
Several bodies of granite and associated crystalline rocks occur in this region. Wherever 
their relations have been determined they are intrusive in the Paleozoic strata and older 
than the Tertiary eruptive rocks. A large granite mass forms the main part of Lone 
Mountain, and granite crops out in the ridges farther southwest.  
 
Eruptive formations of Tertiary age, consisting of rhyolite and minor amounts of basalt 
and rocks of intermediate composition with associated tuffs and breccias, occur over 
extensive areas in all the ranges bordering the Big Smokey Valley. They lie at the surface 
in much of the greater part of the San Antonio and Monte Cristo ranges and the hill 
country north of the Monte Cristo Range, and in considerable areas in the Silver Peak 
and Lone Mountain ranges.  
 
Tertiary sedimentary rocks of the Esmeralda Formation are developed in the foothill 
region southwest of Lone Mountain and in the region west and southwest of Blair 
Junction, but they are widely distributed in the ranges bordering the lower valley and 
either crop out or lie near the surface over extensive areas in the marginal parts of the 
lower valley and Lone Valley. There are occurrences of sharp structural unconformities 
between the Tertiary beds and the overlying Quaternary deposits (O. E. Ivieinzer, 1915).  
 
The Quaternary deposits in general are comprised of soils of uplands and mountains, 
soils of valley fills, outwash plains and alluvial fans, soils on alluvial fans and aprons, and 
playas and soils on flats and basins, as described in US Department of Agriculture report 
on Soil Survey of Big Smokey Valley (1980). 
 
  



Page 52 of 76 

7.2 Local and Property Geology 
 
The South Big Smokey Valley is located within the Basin and Range Province in southern 
Nevada. It is a closed-basin that is bounded to the northwest by Monte Cristo Range, 
the east and northeast by Lone Mountain, and to the southeast by Weeepah Hills and to 
the south by Red Mountain and the Silver Peak Range. The basement rocks consist of 
late Neoproterozoic to Ordovician carbonate and clastic rocks which were deposited 
along the ancient western passive margin of North America. During late Paleozoic and 
Mesozoic orogenies, the region was shortened and subjected to low‐grade 
metamorphism and granitoids were emplaced at ca. 155 and 85 Ma.  
 
Multiple wetting and drying periods during the Pleistocene resulted in the formation of 
lacustrine deposits, salt beds, in this part of the Big Smokey Valley and cover majority of 
the property claims. The following types of soils are described in US Department of 
Agriculture report on Soil Survey of Big Smokey Valley (1980).  
 
Soils of Uplands and Mountains: These soils are formed in residuum and colluvium 
derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, and volcanic ash. The surface layer is gravelly 
and cobbly, medium textured and moderately coarse textured. The soils are well 
drained, shallow and moderately deep, exposed mostly at the margins of the property 
claims, and the southwestern claim block. 
 
Soils of Valley Fills, Outwash Plains and Alluvial Fans: These soils formed in alluvium 
mainly derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, rhyolite, tuffs and latite, and 
admixtures of limestone and shale. The surface layer is gravelly and coarse, moderately 
coarse, or medium in texture. The soils are well drained to excessively drained.  
 
Soils on Alluvial Fans and Aprons: These soils formed in alluvium mainly derived from 
volcanics such as basalt, rhyolite, tuffs and andesite, and from limestone and granitic 
rocks. The surface layer is generally coarse textured or moderately coarse textured. The 
soils are excessively drained, somewhat excessively drained, and well drained. 
 
Playas and Soils on Flats and Basins: The soils formed in silty lacustrine sediment 
derived from mixed rock sources. The surface layer is generally medium textured, 
moderately fine textured or fine textured. These soils are somewhat poorly drained to 
poorly drained and have a desirable character for potential development of brines and 
accumulation of lithium. 
 
The Late Miocene to Pliocene tuffaceous lacustrine facies of the Esmeralda Formation 
are documented to contain up to 1,300 ppm lithium and an average of 100 ppm lithium. 
2015 surface sampling by Ultra Lithium indicated up to 100 ppm lithium in lake 
sediments which represent soils of Playas on Flats and Basins.

7.3 Mineralization 
 

The fine-grained lake sediments in the centre of the South Big Smokey Valley have 
anomalous values of lithium. Surface and shallow subsurface water samples collected 
during 2015 fieldwork season did not show anomalous values of lithium.  
 

7.4 Hydrogeology 

Hydrogeological observations during 2015 fieldwork indicate that the property area 
which is a part of the South Big Smokey Valley (BSV), is an enclosed basin which receives 
water recharge from the surrounding ranges. The rocks on the southeastern part of BSV 
were observed to be dipping inwards towards the basin, whereas the overall slope of 
the basin is to the southwest. Traverses along geophysical survey lines indicated 
subsurface sediments were generally composed of silty clay, silty sand and gravel. The 
amount of volocanogenic material and salt varies from place to place however was 
generally observed in the majority of the claims held by Ultra Lithium. At several 
locations, the top portion of sediments was covered by pebbles of broken rocks of 
surrounding outcrops. The Central part of the Property represents a light grey fine silty 
clay unit mixed with volcanic ash material which has a puffy appearance due to water 
action on its soil surface.  

The Lithium brine at Clayton Valley is documented to be formed from a complex process 
of evaporation, mixing, halite and hectorite dissolution, precipitation and ion-
exchange/absorption. Mixing of salts and volcanic material is observed within the 
central part of the South Big Smokey Valley and on the Property indicating a favorable 
setting for the accumulation of lithium. Numerous sand dunes were observed in the 
northeastern claim area near geophysical lines E (station 10000) and F (between station 
5000 and 6000). 

Within the Clayton Valley including the Silver Peak brine lithium project area a display of 
distinct layers of white to light grey colored volcanic ash beds can be observed.  These 
ash beds can be seen to continue to the north, towards the South Big Smokey Valley. 
Similarity of the presence of volcanic ash is of note for both valleys. Of contrast, 
outcrops of rhyolite, observed in Clayton valley are not very prominent in the Big 
Smokey Valley.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
8.1 Lithium Deposit Types 
 
Global lithium resources are estimated to be 39 million metric tons (MT) and lithium is 
currently mined from three types of deposits: brines, pegmatites and sedimentary rocks. 
Continental brines and pegmatites (or hard-rock ore) are the main sources for 
commercial lithium production. Generally, lithium extraction from brine sources has 
proven more economical than production from hard-rock ore. While hard-rock lithium 
production once dominated the market, the majority of lithium carbonate is now 
produced from continental brines in Latin America, primarily due to the lower cost of 
production. 
 
Pegmatite is coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock formed from crystallized magma 
below the earth's crust. It can contain extractable amounts of a number of elements, 
including lithium, tin, niobium and tantalum. Lithium in pegmatites is commonly found 
in the mineral spodumene, but also may be present in petalite, lepidolite, amblygonite 
and eucryptite. This form of deposit accounts for 26 percent of known global lithium 
resources.  
 
Sedimentary rock deposits account for 8 percent of known global lithium resources and 
are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites. In clay deposits, lithium is found in 
hectorite, which is rich in both magnesium and lithium. The most commonly-known 
form of lithium-containing lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia for 
which the lithium- and boron-bearing element jadarite is named. 
 
Brine deposits represent about 66 percent of global lithium resources and are found 
mainly in the salt flats of Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, China and Tibet. The second half of the 
20th century saw a dramatic shift in lithium carbonate (and some lithium chloride) 
production from the usual pegmatite sources to brines. Today, all lithium carbonate, 
which is the basis of various downstream lithium chemicals, comes from the brines of the 
Salar de Atacama, Chile, and Clayton Valley, Nevada (United States). Lithium chloride is 
also produced from the Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina. Various other salars and 
playas such as those of China, Bolivia, Argentina, and Tibet are being evaluated for future 
lithium chemical production. The industry was once dominated by two major U.S. 
producers, until a third producer from Chile started production of various salts, including 
lithium carbonate. This shift in sources led to the shutdown of both U.S. pegmatite 
operations. Australia, Canada, and Zimbabwe have continued to supply lithium mineral 
concentrates for the ceramic and glass industry and other applications. Minor producers 
in Brazil, Portugal, Russia, and the People's Republic of China mine various lithium 
minerals. One new U.S. supplier of lithium chemicals came on stream using the depleted 
lithium hydroxide government stockpile (Kunasz 2004).  
 
 



Page 57 of 76 

8.2 Deposit Models 
 
There are three types of brine deposits — continental, geothermal and oil field — with 
the most common being continental saline desert basins (also known as salt lakes, salt 
flats or salars). They are located near tertiary or recent volcanoes and are made up of 
sand, minerals with brine and saline water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. A 
playa is a brine deposit whose surface is composed mostly of silts and clays; they have 
less salt than a salar. The South Big Smokey Valley brine lithium property also falls 
within the playa type brine deposit model. It shares geological similarities with Clayton 
Valley which is the only lithium producing brine operation in North America. The Lithium 
brine at Clayton Valley is documented to be formed from a complex process of 
evaporation, mixing, halite and hectorite dissolution, precipitation and ion-
exchange/absorption. The Li-rich brines are currently being produced from six different 
aquifers in the playa as shown in the following Figure (Munk 2011). 
 

 

Figure 17- Generalized cross section of nearby Clayton Valley, after Davis (1986) 

(Indicating that lithium concentrations (in ppm) increase against faults forming 
structural traps) 
 
All producing lithium brine deposits share a number of first-order characteristics: (1) 
arid climate; (2) closed basin containing a playa or salar; (3) tectonically driven 
subsidence; (4) associated igneous or geothermal activity; (5) suitable lithium source-
rocks; (6) one or more adequate aquifers; and (7) sufficient time to concentrate a brine. 
Key aspects of the proposed lithium-brine deposit model are shown in Figure 18. In 
essence, lithium is liberated by weathering or derived from hydrothermal fluids from a 
variety of rock sources within a closed basin. Circumstantial evidence from the Clayton 
Valley suggests that felsic vitric tuffs are a particularly favorable primary source. 
Another potentially important lithium source in the Clayton Valley is uplifted Neogene 
lake beds from earlier in the basin's history, which had previously been hydrothermally 
altered to hectorite. Lithium is highly soluble and, unlike sodium (Na), potassium (K), or 
calcium (Ca), does not readily produce evaporite minerals when concentrated by 
evaporation. Instead it ends up in residual brines in the shallow subsurface. Economic 
brines have Li concentrations in the range of 200 to 4,000 milligrams per liter (mg/l). 
Other elements in solution, such as boron and potassium, may be recovered as 
byproducts or coproducts; brines can also contain undesirable elements that create 
problems in processing (magnesium) or toxic elements that require care in waste 
disposal (Bradley 2013).  



Page 58 of 76 

 
The single most important factor determining if a non-marine basin can accumulate 
lithium brine is whether or not the basin is closed. Closed basins form because of 
tectonics but they are maintained only where, over longer time-spans, evaporation 
exceeds precipitation. If the long-term rate of precipitation in a basin increases 
sufficiently, eventually lake water will overspill at some point along the drainage divide 
and drain away, carrying with it any dissolved lithium.  
 
Active faulting appears to be a consistent attribute for lithium host basins. Fault-related 
subsidence creates accommodation space, without such only a thin veneer of basin 
sediments could accumulate. A thick basin fill is needed to provide an aquifer of 
sufficient volume to hold a viable brine resource. In contrast, shallow, superficial basins 
in cratonic regions such as the Sahara Desert lack fault control and are not known to be 
prospective for lithium brines. Some basins are cut by active intrabasinal faults. Brine 
pools in the Clayton Valley and Salar de Atacama are localized along active intrabasinal 
faults that control the distribution of aquifers and also influence groundwater 
movement patterns. These intrabasinal faults are known from boreholes and have no 
surface expression (Bradley et.al., 2013).  
 
Because they are contained by aquifers of various geometries, lithium brines are 
localized in the subsurface rather than being present throughout at depth. At Salar de 
Atacama, the brine is hosted in the porous, upper 30 meters of the salar's halite 
nucleus. Little is known about the potential of brine aquifers at depth in Salar de 
Atacama. At Clayton Valley, brines are pumped from six gently dipping aquifers that are 
variously composed of ash, fanglomerate, tufa, and halite (Bradley et.al., 2013).

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
Metron Capital Corp. has not done any exploration work on the Property. 
 

10.0 DRILLING 

No drilling was done on the Property by Metron Capital Corp. 
 

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
The samples for this study were shipped directly by the author to Western 
Environmental Testing Laboratory in Sparks, Nevada, which is an US EPA accredited 
laboratory. The samples were analyzed for lithium, potassium, boron, and magnesium 
using Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, online edition, 
Methods for Determination of Organic Compounds in Drinking Water, EPA-600/4-79-
020, and Test Methods for Evaluation of Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods 
(SW846), Third Edition. Laboratory used its own quality control and quality assurance 
protocols for sample analysis. The soil and water samples from Ultra Lithium's 
exploration work of 2015-16 were also prepared and analyzed from the same laboratory 
using the above- mentioned methodology. 
 
For the present study, the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures used by 
the laboratories are considered adequate. No officer, director, employee or associate of 
Metron Capital Corp. or Ultra Lithium Inc. was involved in sample preparation and 
analysis. 
 

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The author visited the Property on December 3, 2016, and the geological work 
performed in order to verify the existing data consisted of visiting existing drill hole on 
the Property (BSH16-01), examining rock outcrops and lake sediments areas of the Big 
Smokey Valley, taking geological and hydrogeological observations, and observing 
several claim posts. GPS coordinates using NAD 83 datum were also recorded for several 
claim posts to confirm the staking process. The drill core for hole BSH16-01 is stored at a 
locked storage unit located on the Clown Motel property in Tonopah. The author viewed 
various core sections and collected five representative samples from selected intervals.  
All samples were under the care and control of the author and are considered 
representative.  
 
The sample assay results (Table 6) indicated lithium values in the range of 192 to 357 
ppm, boron 97 to 230 ppm, potassium 7200 to 12000 ppm, and magnesium 7200 to 
13000 ppm. These results are consistent with 22 core sample results of May 2016 from 
the same drill hole as discussed in Section 6.2.3 of this report.

23.1 Silver Peak Mine, Clayton Valley, Nevada 
 
The Clayton Valley is located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA approximately 180 km 
north of Death Valley, California and is the location of the only lithium brine deposit in 
production in North America (Fig 19). The Clayton Valley is a closed basin with an area of 
1,342 km

2
 and a playa surface of 72 km

2
. The basin lies in the eastern rain shadow of the 

Sierra Nevada and is arid with an annual average precipitation of 13 cm, average 
evaporation rates of 142 cm/yr and an average temperature of 13°C. The elevation of 
the valley floor is 1298 m, the lowest of than any of neighboring basins in the region 
(Munk 2011).  
 

Foote Mineral Company traces its origins to A.E. Foote, who founded the company in 
1876 as a purveyor of rare minerals. It became a major producer of lithium chemicals 
when it acquired the right to mine spodumene at Kings Mountain, North Carolina, in the 
early 1950s. In the 1960s, Foote pioneered the production of lithium carbonate from 
brine with the opening of the Silver Peak plant (Clayton Valley). It was acquired by Cyprus 
Minerals Company, then by Chemetall of Germany and more recently by Rockwood 
Specialties.  The Clayton Valley salt marsh was first investigated during the World War II 
effort to locate sources of strategic minerals, one of which was potash. The salt marsh 
area was leased by the American Potash Corp., which let the leases lapse. The leases were 
picked up by the Leprechaun Mining Company (Clyde Kegel), which conducted some 
exploration on the subsurface brines and identified lithium in addition to potassium. An 
agreement was later negotiated with Foote Mineral Company, which developed the 
brines of the basin as a source of lithium carbonate (Barrett and O'Neill 1970). In Clayton 
Valley, lithium-bearing brines occur in an asymmetric, undrained structural depression 
filled with Quaternary sediments composed mainly of clay minerals, including hectorite, 
volcanic sands, and alluvial gravels, and saline minerals consisting of gypsum and halite 
(Kunasz 1970). The brine that saturates the sediments is chemically simple. It is a 
concentrated sodium chloride solution containing subordinate amounts of potassium and 
minor amounts of magnesium and calcium. The lithium concentration is variable and 
decreases with pumping; the lithium concentration in the brine varies from 100 to 300 
ppm Li. The dominant source of lithium has been a volcanic ash that extends across the 
basin. Exploration has identified additional aquifers which supply additional volumes of 
lithium-bearing brine. 
 
An extensive well field supplies the brine into some 4,000 acres of solar evaporation 
ponds. Over 12 to 18 months, the concentration of the brine increases to 6,000 ppm 
Lithium solely via solar evaporation. When the lithium chloride reaches an optimum 
concentration, the liquid is pumped to a recovery plant and treated with soda ash, 
precipitating lithium carbonate, which is then filtrated out, dried, and shipped. At this 
time, the Silver Peak mine operation is one of the world's leading producers of lithium 
hydroxide (Kunasz 2004).

23.2 Pure Energy Minerals Ltd. 
 
Pure Energy Minerals Ltd. is a publicly traded lithium exploration company listed on the 
TSX Venture Exchange (TSX:PE) with a total lease area of 3,240 ha (8,004 acres) of public 
land in the southern Clayton Valley, Nevada, USA. The leases are adjacent to 
Albemarle's Silver Peak Operations where lithium brines are processed in evaporation 
ponds and used to produce a variety of lithium chemicals. The operation is unique to 
North America and has been in operation since 1967. Highways and electric power are 
in place, and local and regional resources are easily accessible.  
 
Rodinia Minerals, Inc., a previous holder of the claims, completed a geophysical survey 
surrounding the existing lithium operation and identified a deep northeast-southwest 
structural trough in the southern Clayton Valley. Rodinia drilled 2 dual wall reverse 
circulation boreholes in the north section of its claims (now Pure Energy claims) in 
2009/10 and identified aquifers that contained lithium up to 400 ppm Li to 488 m (1600 
ft) in depth. Rodinia dropped the claims in order to concentrate financial resources on 
other projects in South America. 
 
Pure Energy completed detailed gravity and seismic reflection surveys during 2014 and 
2015 that confirmed a deep structural trough on its claims and identified 19 reflectors 
from sediment layers that correspond to previously identified Lithium host aquifer 
horizons. Two exploratory boreholes were completed in the north end of Pure Energy's 
claims. CV-1 "twinned" the Rodina hole SPD-9, and CV-2 explored new ground further 
south. Pumping tests completed for 8 hrs. in CV-1 provided positive results of 150 gpm 
(9.5 L/s) and 225 ppm Li. 
 
An Inferred Resource of 816,000 metric tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) 
has been calculated based on borehole sample chemistry, seismic and gravity 
interpretations of basin stratigraphy.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 

24.1 Environmental Concerns 
 
The author is not aware of any environmental liabilities related to the Property. The 
company is bound by the federal and the state laws concerning environmental 
compliance.   
 

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Metron Big Smokey Valley Brine Lithium Property is located approximately 25 miles 
(40 kilometres) from Tonopah in Esmeralda County, Nevada, USA. It is about 50 
kilometres to the west of Goldfield, the County Seat of Esmeralda County. It consists of 
100 placer claims located in Townships 1 and 2, Range 38 and 38 ½ East, Esmeralda 
County, Nevada, USA. Each claim is approximately 20 acres with a total property area of 
2,000 acres, configured in two blocks (Metron 1 and 2).  
 
This part of the valley is a typical internally drained basin hemmed in by mountains, low 
foothills, and broad alluvial fans. Limestone, quartzite, slate, and schist, aggregating 
several thousand feet in thickness and ranging in age from Lower Cambrian to 
Carboniferous are the oldest rocks found in this region. Since their deposition, they have 
been extensively deformed, eroded, intruded by lavas, and largely covered by igneous 
bodies and sedimentary deposits. Originally, they probably covered the entire region, 
but at present they are found over extensive areas only in the Toyabe, Toquima, Silver 
Peak, and Lone Mountain ranges. The Quaternary deposits are generally comprised of 
the soils of uplands and mountains, soils of valley fills, outwash plains and alluvial fans, 
soils on alluvial fans and aprons, and playas and soils on flats and basins. The playas soils 
are somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained and have a desirable character for 
potential development of brines and accumulation of lithium. 
 
The Late Miocene to Pliocene tuffaceous lacustrine facies of the Esmeralda Formation 
are documented to contain up to 1,300 ppm lithium and an average of 100 ppm lithium. 
2015 surface sampling by Ultra Lithium indicated up to 100 ppm lithium in lake 
sediments which represent soils of Playas on Flats and Basins. 
 
In 1980, United States Geological Survey carried out an investigation for potential 
lithium bearing brines in and around Clayton Valley as part of regional study related to 
lithium supply sources. The Big Smokey Valley was also part of this study where two 
reverse circulatory drill holes (BS13 and BS14) were drilled outside the current Property.  
In BS13, a maximum value of 1.7 ppm Li was found in a water sample and 364 ppm in 
sediment samples. BS14 was abandoned after drilling 215 feet (66 m) into 



Page 68 of 76 

unconsolidated sand and gravel. A maximum of 1.3 ppm Li was found in a water sample 
and 287 ppm in sediment samples. 
 

Ultra Lithium Inc. carried out ground geophysical survey in 2014, and a soil and water 
sampling program in 2015. A ground geophysical survey consisted of eight CSAMT 
survey lines (called Lines A through H) covering 53.8 kilometers of data. Lines C, D, E and 
F are partially or fully located on the Property. The survey results indicate that in the 
northeastern area, the lowest resistivities are south of Line E, in the vicinity of station 
6200 on Line F and from station 9400 on Line C to station 2800 on Line D. Evidence for 
faulting is very tentative in this area, and the depth of investigation does not extend as 
deep as observed on the southwestern lines.  
 
On December 11-18, 2015, a soil and water sampling program completed by Ultra 
Lithium was designed to follow up on the results of a CSAMT ground geophysical survey, 
and its purpose was to investigate the presence of lithium in shallow soil and within its 
groundwater system. A total of 48 soil / sediment samples were collected to cover 
survey lines A to H. Additionally, five water samples were collected from different areas, 
of which four were from surface water / ice with the fifth sample collected from a water 
well, located on adjacent ground to the Property. The results confirmed the presence of 
lithium in the Property's hydrogeological system. Of particular interest is the area of 
geophysical survey lines C, D, E and F. Maximum values for lithium in sediments is 100 
ppm, boron 480 ppm, and potassium 7,600 ppm. Generally, the lithium, boron and 
potassium values correspond well with each other, where samples with higher lithium 
concentrations tend to have higher values of other two elements. The next exploration 
phase planned was to a drill hole to a depth which would intersect all potentially brine 
bearing aquifers identified in the CSAMT geophysical survey interpretation.  
 
In May 2016, Ultra Lithium Inc. completed one HQ size core drill hole on the Property. 
The hole was drilled down to 1,000 feet (305 metres) and was terminated early due to 
artesian water pressure. The hole was later reamed to a six-inch diameter and a 
monitoring well was installed to a depth of 500 feet. A 3-inch diameter screen was 
installed at the bottom 120 feet of the hole. The results of 22 drill core samples 
collected from the hole BSH16-01 indicate maximum values for lithium of 270 parts per 
million (ppm), boron 410 ppm, potassium 10,000 ppm, and magnesium 12,000 ppm; 
whereas the average lithium concentration in all core samples was 131 ppm, boron 151 
ppm, potassium 5,575 ppm, and magnesium 6,210 ppm.  One sample from a 10-cm 
gypsum layer yielded a lithium value below detection limit. These samples were taken at 
various depth intervals down to 1,000 feet (305 meters). Two rounds of groundwater 
sampling from this well yielded lithium values of 1 ppm or less. The total exploration 
expenditures for this drill hole were USD $165,394.58 (CAD $215,012.95).  
 
The author visited the Property on December 3, 2016, and the geological work 
performed in order to verify the existing data consisted of visiting existing drill hole on 
the Property (BSH16-01), examining rock outcrops and lake sediments areas of the Big 
Smokey Valley, taking geological and hydrogeological observations, and observing 



Page 69 of 76 

several claim posts. The drill core for hole BSH16-01 is stored at a locked storage unit 
located in Tonopah. The author viewed various core sections and collected five 
representative samples from selected intervals.  The sample assay results indicated 
lithium values in the range of 192 to 357 ppm, boron 97 to 230 ppm, potassium 7200 to 
12000 ppm, and magnesium 7200 to 13000 ppm.  
 
Continental brines are the most common type of brine deposits located in saline desert 
basins (also known as salt lakes, salt flats or salars). They are located near tertiary or 
recent volcanoes and are made up of sand, minerals with brine and saline water with 
high concentrations of dissolved salts. A playa is a brine deposit whose surface is 
composed mostly of silts and clays and have less salt than a salar. The South Big Smokey 
Valley brine lithium property would be characterized as a playa type brine deposit 
model. It shares geological similarities with neighboring Clayton Valley. 
 
The Property is located in an active mining and mineral exploration region where many 
neighboring operators have recently carried out lithium exploration and/ or development 
work on their adjacent properties.  The Silver Peak brine lithium mine on the adjacent 
Clayton Valley, currently operated by Rockwood is located approximately 25 kilometres to 
the southeast of the Property. Similarly, Pure Energy Minerals is working on the southern 
portion of the Clayton Valley, adjacent to the south extent of the Silver Peak mine.  
 
The Property is exposed to certain risks due to gaps in various claim blocks which can 
create a competition in pumping lithium containing brines from the adjoining claims by 
other parties. The Company should make arrangements to acquire claims to fill gaps in its 
claim blocks if the recommended exploration work is successful.  
 
The Property has a good year-round road access from Tonopah Station through highway 
6/95. Highway 265 to Silver Peak branches off from 6/95 and crosses the southwestern 
extent of the Property.  The primary source of water is groundwater and power is 
available locally. 
 
Based on the favourable geological, hydrogeological and tectonic setting, presence of 
surface lithium anomalous values, and the results of present study, it is concluded that 
the Property is a property of merit and possess a good potential for discovery of brine 
lithium mineralization. It has good road access, most of the exploration and mining 
services are available in the immediate vicinity. The author is of the opinion that the 
present study has met it original objectives.    
 

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
In the qualified person's opinion, the character of the South Big Smokey Valley Property 
is sufficient to merit for a follow-up work program. This can be accomplished through a 
two-phase exploration program, where each phase is contingent upon the results of the 
previous phase.

Phase 1 – Surface Sampling and Drilling 
A total of 12 samples were collected from the property during 2015 surface soil 
sampling program. This sampling identified anomalous values of lithium, and requires a 
follow up detailed surface sampling to get better coverage of the property area.  
 
The ground geophysical CSAMT survey and soil sampling program has identified various 
distinct potential brine targets for drilling. The lowest resistivities are indicated south of 
Line E, in the vicinity of station 6200 on Line F and from station 9400 on Line C to station 
2800 on Line D. The drill hole BSH16-01 was drilled at location C9700 where core 
samples indicated anomalous lithium values however groundwater samples reported 
low lithium values (1 ppm and below). To test the CSAMT target at line D, one single drill 
hole is proposed at station D2350 down to a depth of 2,200 feet (670 m). All 
hydrogeological units intercepted during drilling should be sampled via soil and 
groundwater testing for lithium, boron, potassium and magnesium. A water well should 
be installed at this borehole location to support water sampling, downhole geophysical 
logging, pumping tests, permeability tests and other hydrogeological studies. 
 

The estimated cost of this program is USD $309,334 (CAD $412,445) and will take an 
estimated 8 to 12 weeks to complete. 
 

Phase 2 – Detailed Drilling 
Based on the results of Phase 1 program, an additional 5-hole drill program should be 
completed on the Property. A scope of work, location of drill holes and budget for Phase 
2 will be prepared after reviewing the results of Phase 1 drill program.
