Western Keltic Mines Inc. (WKM) has commissioned Wardrop Engineering Inc. 
(Wardrop) to prepare a prefeasibility study and technical report for the Kutcho Project 
in northern British Columbia, Canada.  Previous studies, including engineering and 
design studies, were completed by Wright Engineers Limited (WEL) in April 1985.

The work completed by Wardrop began in April of 2007, and entailed generating a 
mineral resource estimate and incorporating this estimate in a new prefeasibility 
study for the Kutcho deposits. 

The work represents a revision of all aspects of the project design, including waste 
handling and storage, tailings impoundment, power and electrical distribution, milling, 
concentrate processing and storage, and transportation.  The prefeasibility study 
presented here is to a +/- 25% level of accuracy. 

The mineral resource estimate was prepared by Tim Carew, P.Geo.; mine design 
and plans were prepared under the supervision of Andrew Nichols, P.Eng. and 
Sandy McVey, P.Eng.  Tim Carew and Sandy McVey visited the property on 11 June 
2007.

In preparing this report, Wardrop has relied on information provided by WKM for 
matters pertaining to environmental, socioeconomic, and permitting issues.  Wardrop 
did not carry out a title search for the property, but have relied on information 
provided by Miller Thomson, LLP, WKM's legal counsel.  

Information on permitting requirements and the status of permitting of the property 
has been provided by WKM. 

The following experts have been relied upon: 

• Renata Wood – AMEC Earth & Environmental 

• Steve Sibbick – AMEC Earth & Environmental 

• Michael McGurk – Rescan Environmental Services Ltd. 

• Carl Hovey – Allnorth Consultants Ltd.

The Kutcho project area is situated 100 km east of the town of Dease Lake, and 
330 km north of Smithers in northern BC (Figure 4.1).  The property appears on NTS 
map sheet 104I/1, and geodetic coordinates for the center of the claim area are 
58°12'N and 128°22'W.  The claims cover an area of approximately 5,500 ha.  As a 
result of overlap between historical claims, the sum of the individual claim areas are 
much greater than the actual total claim area.  Claims are shown in Figure 4.2 and 
listed in Table 4.1 below.  Western Keltic Mines Inc. (WKM) owns the claims through 
two separate purchase agreements.  One agreement is with Barrick Gold Inc. (a 
subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation) and AMI Resources Inc., who had 80% and 
20% ownership, respectively, in all of the claims except the 16 SMRB claims and the 
30 KC claims.  The other agreement is with Sumac Mines Inc., a subsidiary of 
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd. 

Key Royalty Terms: 

• In terms suitable for prefeasibility study, Barrick has a royalty over 40% of 
the Main deposit and Sumac has a royalty on the remaining 60% of the Main 
deposit based on the property definition per the acquisition agreements.  
This split will be refined on detailed mining plans produced during feasibility 
studies.  See Figure 4.2 for the division of Sumac and Barrick claims in the 
Main deposit, and Figure 4.3 for all claims on the property. 

• commencement of commercial production for the Sumac property starts at 
the beginning of year 1 

• ore from the Main deposit Barrick claims will be completely mined out in 
years 1-3 

• Sumac claims will be mined from year 1 to year 8, with royalties in effect 
from years 4-8 

• Barrick has a royalty on 100% of the Esso deposit 

• underground mining of the Esso deposit will commence in year 4 and end in 
year 8. 

Details for the royalties are shown in Table 4.2.

Access to the property is by fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter from Smithers or 
Dease Lake, landing at the 900 m gravel airstrip located at the junction of Kutcho and 
Andrea Creeks.  The deposit area of the property is connected to the airstrip by a 
10 km road.  Currently this road has had culverts removed and is only passable to 
four-wheel drive trucks with good ground clearance.  Four-wheel drive vehicles have 
access to the property, via the track road to Dease Lake during the late summer and 
early fall, but this access is somewhat weather-dependant due to extensive muddy 
sections. 

The property is located within the Cassiar Mountains, just to the north of the 
continental divide between the Arctic and Pacific watersheds.  The area is 
moderately rugged with elevations ranging from 1,400 to 2,200 metres.  Most of the 
area is alpine with tree line at approximately 1,500 metres.  Snow cover can persist 
for nine months of the year, particularly on shady north-facing slopes.  Winters are 
cold and dry, while summers are cool and moist.  Average annual temperature is 
-1°C, and approximately half of the average annual precipitation of 50 cm occurs as 
snow.   

Structural fabric and two periods of glaciation have produced an intersecting pattern 
of east-west and north-south ridges and valleys.  The major valleys are commonly 
filled with a deep layer of glacial till and outwash gravels.

Mineralization on what was to become the Kutcho property was first discovered in 
1968 by a joint venture exploration operated by Imperial Oil Ltd.  The discovery was 
made by prospecting in response to anomalous stream sediment samples collected 
during a regional drainage survey.  Twenty claims were staked by W. Melnyk directly 
over the as of yet undiscovered main Kutcho sulphide deposit.  These claims were 
allowed to lapse when the other partners in the joint venture declined to fund further 
exploration.  After the statutes of the joint venture agreement expired, Imperial Oil 
returned to the area in 1972 in order to re-stake the area.  However, Sumac Mines 
Ltd. (Sumac) had conducted stream sediment sampling earlier that season, and in 
response to anomalous samples R. Britten staked eight "two-post" claims along the 
anomalous stream and eight more claims along the geological strike direction, 
resulting in the cruciform claim outline overlying the western part of the main Kutcho 
sulphide deposit.  Imperial Oil (later becoming Esso Minerals Canada Ltd.) staked a 
much larger area encompassing Sumac's claims. 

Beginning in 1973 both Sumac and Esso carried out exploration work, and their early 
successes prompted additional staking which resulted in claim boundaries roughly as 
they are today.  Diamond drilling commenced in 1974, and by 1982 approximately 
60,000 metres had been drilled by both companies, defining three sulphide lenses.  
During this time Esso also drilled a number of exploration targets in other areas of 
the property with moderate success.  Environmental, metallurgical, and engineering 
studies were begun by both groups in 1980.  A partnership agreement on 
engineering and development work was signed by Esso and Sumac in 1983, made 
retroactive to 1981 (the year Sumac began work driving the adit in order to collect a 
100 tonne bulk sample).  The agreement was essentially a 50/50 joint venture for 
development work, and culminated in a prefeasibility study by Wright Engineers 
Limited in 1985.  This study indicated an 11% internal rate of return when using a 
copper price of US$0.95/lb.  Given the risk factors involved and long-term price 
projections for copper below the US$0.95/lb level, the companies put the project on 
hold pending further exploration results.  A limited amount of exploration work was 
done on Esso's claims to the south of the main mineralized trend between 1985 and 
1988; however, this work and the numerous geophysical surveys that had been 
undertaken indicated limited potential for additional open pit mineralization.   

In 1989, Esso sold most of its mining assets to Homestake Canada Ltd. 
(Homestake).  In 1990, Homestake optioned the Kutcho property to American 
Reserve Mining Corporation (ARMC), who funded a $1.1 M exploration program 
(Homestake remained the operator) which included 7,031 m of drilling in 28 holes, 
mostly in outlying target areas (Homestake remained the operator, thereby earning a 
20% interest).  Exploration successfully confirmed the presence of extensive areas of 
favourable geology and alteration indicative of hydrothermal activity, but failed to

discover zones of potentially economic mineralization.  For example, 10 km 
southwest of the Kutcho deposit, a narrow zone of cryptocrystalline massive pyrite 
with a strike length in excess of 5 km was intersected in four widely-spaced drill 
holes, but was barren of base or precious metals.  ARMC carried out engineering 
studies but did no further exploration work, relinquishing the option in 1993 while 
retaining a 20% interest in Homestake's property.  The property was optioned to 
Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCL) in 1992.  TCL carried out deep penetration EM geophysical 
surveys (UTEM) over the Esso West Zone with the goal of defining additional 
conductors along the Kutcho trend.  Due to extensive cover of conductive 
argillaceous units in the hanging wall, the UTEM system was unable to detect the 
Esso West deposit or other conductors at depth, leading TCL to drop their option.  
Homestake was purchased by Barrick Gold Corp. (Barrick) in 2003. 

Extensions of the Kutcho stratigraphy to the west have been staked and worked by 
various companies in the past.  Shortly after the discovery of the Kutcho deposits, 
Noranda staked the Kutcho formation to the west of Kutcho Creek.  Noranda 
conducted geophysical surveys and carried out a small drilling program.  The claims 
were allowed to lapse and were re-staked in 1995 by Gary Belik.  Mr. Belik carried 
out a detailed mapping program and optioned the claims to Atna Resources Ltd. 
(Atna) in 1997.  Atna conducted UTEM geophysical surveys and an extensive drilling 
program.  Results of Atna's work were mixed, and although no deposits were 
discovered, significant but weak to moderately mineralized alteration zones were 
intersected.  Structural complexity and lack of clear geophysical targets prevented 
additional work and the option was terminated. 

Negotiations by Western Keltic Mines Inc. (WKM) to purchase the property from 
Barrick and Sumitomo were initiated in 2003 and concluded in early 2004.  WKM 
carried out diamond drilling within the Main and Esso deposits during 2004 to confirm 
historical results and obtain material for metallurgical studies.  A second round of 
drilling by WKM in 2005 tested the Main deposit's potential for up-dip and down dip 
extensions, as well as western extensions to the Esso deposit.  The Sumac deposit 
was also drilled in 2005 to test for higher grade zones.  A third round of drilling in 
2006 focused on infill drilling within the five-year pit area of the Main deposit.  The 
Kutcho property was entered into the Mine Development Review Process in 2006 
and Environmental Assessment (EA) studies were initiated to provide baseline data 
for provincial and federal EA reviews.

7.1.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Kutcho property lies within the King Salmon Allochthon (KSA), a narrow belt of 
Permotriassic island arc volcanic rocks and Jurassic sediments, sandwiched 
between two northerly-dipping thrust faults: the Nahlin fault to the north, and the King 
Salmon fault to the south (Figure 7.1).  Penetrative foliation and axial planes of major 
folds are parallel to these east-west trending bounding faults.  The belt of volcanic 
rocks is thickest in the area where it hosts the volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) 
deposits, partly due to primary deposition, but also to stratigraphic repetition by 
folding and possibly thrusting.  The KSA is terminated to the east (near the eastern 
edge of the property) by the Kutcho strike-slip fault (Gabrielse, 1978), but extends to 
the west for hundreds of kilometres.  However, Kutcho Formation rocks thin to the 
west, and do not occur or are rarely exposed 10 km to the west of Kutcho Creek.   

Stratigraphy of the KSA consists primarily of the Kutcho Formation, which is overlain 
by the limestone of the upper Triassic Sinwa Formation, which in turn is overlain by 
sediments (predominately argillite) of the Lower Jurassic Inklin Formation.  Major 
folds are delineated by the Sinwa limestone and, where the Sinwa is absent, by the 
contact between the Kutcho and Inklin Formations (Figure 7.2).  

7.1.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

STRATIGRAPHY 
Stratigraphy of the Kutcho property has been described by Bridge (1984), Thorstad 
(1983), and Holbek (1985) and will only be briefly reviewed here.  A property plan 
map is given in Figure 7.3, and a generalized reconstructed stratigraphic section is 
presented in Figure 7.4.  Stratigraphy is best understood in the upper part of the 
Kutcho Formation, where units are better exposed and drill information is available.  
The footwall stratigraphy (particularly away from the deposit area) is not well 
understood. 

The lowest rocks in the section are exposed on the southern ends of Imperial and 
Sumac Ridges and include interbedded basalts, basaltic tuffs and wackes, rhyolitic 
lapilli tuffs, and possible trondhjemite.  The mafic rocks are fine to very fine-grained, 
chloritic, equigranular to weakly porphyritic, and are commonly given the field term of 
greenstone.  The lapilli tuffs are pale grey and siliceous, and commonly contain very 
fine quartz phenocrysts and lenticular fragments from 0.5-3.0 cm in length.  Textures

can only be seen on weathered (but lichen-free) surfaces.  The trondhjemite unit is 
somewhat unclear.  It is described by Pearson and Pantaleyev (1975) and Bridge et 
al. (1983) as a fine-grained, equigranular, plagioclase-rich unit, but it is very similar to 
some of the tuffaceous units as well.  A weak but pervasive carbonate-chlorite-pyrite 
or propylitic alteration of this unit is subtle but discernible.

Rocks overlying the greenstone-lapilli tuff package have been termed the "ore-
sequence," and consist of lapilli tuffs, crystal-lithic tuffs, and quartz and quartz-
feldspar crystal tuffs.  Away from the deposit area these units tend to be thin, 
interbedded, and variably but weakly altered.  Fine quartz-crystal ash tuff with silica-
rich laminations and rare thin zones of ferroan dolomite typically mark the distal 
exhalative zone.  The sulphide zones occur at (or near to) the contact between 
footwall lapilli tuff and hanging wall quartz-crystal tuff.  In general, both lapilli 
fragments and phenocrysts are much coarser grained in the vicinity of the deposits, 
becoming progressively finer grained to the south and west.  The quartz-feldspar 
crystal tuff is quartz-rich near the deposits, becoming more feldspar-rich to the south.  
A large zone of feldspar crystal tuff with almost no free quartz occurs a few hundred 
metres south of the sulphide zones, and whether this unit is footwall, hanging wall, or 
a facies equivalent to the quartz-feldspar crystal tuff is as yet indeterminate.  An 
interesting feature is the occurrence of a coarse breccia texture within the quartz-
feldspar crystal tuff immediately over the sulphide zones.  The breccia fragments are 
typically subround, from 2–30 cm in size, and are identical to crystal tuff matrix 
except for an increase in the amount of epidote from 1–2% to closer to 10%.  This 
feature has been interpreted to be a debris flow of semi-consolidated crystal tuff, 
shed from a flow dome complex and trapped in the graben or half-graben like 
structure which hosts the sulphide lenses. 

Rocks between the ore sequence and the overlying conglomerate unit are referred to 
as the Tuff-Argillite Unit (TAU), and consist of gabbroic to basaltic intrusive sills and 
dykes, greywackes, and argillite.  In the area of the deposit the gabbroic units are 
commonly coarse-grained and are commonly referred to as metagabbro.  Higher in 
the section and both to the east and west of the Kutcho deposit this mafic unit 
becomes much finer grained, and an intrusive origin is not so clearly identified.  The 
amount of argillite increases in a westerly direction, supporting the concept that this 
direction is towards the marine basin.  The base of the TAU is interpreted to be a 
thrust fault, and there are numerous other fault zones within the unit as noted in drill 
cores and the adit.  The basal thrust plane does not cause significant offset of the 
Sinwa limestone in the fold nose to the west, implying a scissor-type action with 
increasing movement to the east.   

Overlying the TAU and truncating it to the west is the Kutcho Conglomerate.  This 
unit is a heterolithic, fragment-supported conglomerate composed of subrounded 
clasts, ranging in size from 1–38 cm (long axis), and derived from all of the 
underlying lithologies.  The conglomerate is conformably overlain and transitional into 
the Sinwa limestone, which in turn appears to be conformably overlain by Jurassic 
aged Inklin Formation argillite.  (However, it is quite possible that there could be a 
contact between Kutcho Formation argillite and Inklin Formation argillite higher in the 
section, which would be difficult to spot and could be unconformable). 

The Kutcho Formation is of Upper Triassic to uppermost Permian in age.  Thorstad 
(1983) determined an Upper Triassic age on the basis of rubidium-strontium dating of 
volcanic rocks and regional stratigraphic constraints.  Subsequent work by F. Childe

at the Mineral Deposit Research Unit of The University of British Columbia in 1996 
suggests an age range from Lower Triassic to uppermost Permian.

STRUCTURE 
Rocks of the Kutcho Formation are characterized by penetrative axial planar foliation 
that has a relatively constant strike direction of 270–290° with northerly dips from  
45–65°.  Minor but systematic changes in foliation from the east to west suggest low 
amplitude buckling of the fold axes.  There appears to be a tendency for the dip of 
the foliation to decrease with structural depth, indicating that the axial planes are 
convex to the south.   

Folds are open to tight, asymmetrical, inclined, and verging to the south.  Fold 
plunges range from 0–30° in a westerly direction.  Folds are most evident in well-
bedded competent units, and therefore spatial distribution of the fold data is heavily 
biased to the western property area, where these units predominate.   

Two aspects of the structure that critically affect stratigraphic interpretations are the 
number and size of foliation parallel thrust faults, and the degree to which the folds 
are propagated through the stratigraphic sequence.  Neither of these aspects can be 
determined independently, and thus there remains considerable scope to reinterpret 
the stratigraphic position of various units locally.  Foliation parallel thrust faults are 
difficult to detect from surface outcrop, but can be inferred from missing stratigraphy, 
contact geometry, shearing, and topographic evidence.  Faults of this type are 
consistent with the deformation style and are considered to be prevalent over the 
property area. 

Fold hinges outlined by the Sinwa limestone unit on Conglomerate Ridge 
(immediately east of Kutcho Creek) are difficult to trace in an easterly direction.  
Structural data (Holbek, 1985) indicate that the folds are cylindrical and therefore 
should be continuous within the depth of exposed stratigraphy.  However, lithological 
competency contrasts are likely to result in disharmonic folding (Holbek and 
Heberlein, 1986), causing discontinuity of the axial plane towards the core of the fold.  
Stratigraphically thicker units will tend to produce a series of lower amplitude folds 
toward the core of the structure, which may explain why the fold axes so clearly 
outlined by the limestone unit on the western part of the property are not at all 
evident to the east, in the vicinity of the Sumac and Main deposits.  Therefore, a 
certain degree of flexibility needs to be maintained regarding structural and 
stratigraphic interpretations in the vicinity of the sulphide deposits.

Mineralization of the Kutcho Project is part of the volcanogenic massive sulphide 
(VMS) or volcanic hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) family of deposits.  These 
deposits are major sources of copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold around the world.  
Speculation about the origin of these deposits goes back to the mid-1850s, when 
various French and English scientists postulated chemical precipitation from seafloor 
volcanic activity (Stanton, 1991).  In the early 19th century, Japanese workers 
documented astute observations of the sulphide textures preserved in the Kuroko 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 7-17 0752370200-REP-R0004-00

deposits of Japan and the association of these deposits with rhyolite domes and 
articulated the "submarine sinter theory".  However this work did not seem to attract 
much attention, and genetic theories or models of ore formation of this deposit type 
did not gain international acceptance until similar observations were published by 
others worldwide in the 1950s and '60s (Ohmoto and Skinner, 1983).  Discovery of 
the Red Sea brine deposits in 1965 provided substantial impetus for the proponents 
of the "submarine exhalative" model.  A certain amount of controversy between 
syngenetic and epigenetic theories continued through the 1970s, but with the advent 
of deep-sea submersibles and the filming of black and white hydrothermal vents (or 
"smokers") in volcanic rift zones on the seafloor, scientific models went to a new level 
of realism and detail.   

VMS deposits have been classified into various subtypes, depending upon the 
composition of the host rocks and the mineralization, and the tectonic setting of 
origin.  The Kutcho deposits are VMS deposits of the Kuroko type or felsic volcani-
siliciclastic depending upon the classification scheme.  Mineralization is related to 
felsic volcanism in island arc or back-arc tectonic settings.  Perhaps the most 
significant feature of VMS deposits from an exploration perspective is their tendency 
to occur in clusters.  Larger VMS camps can have up to 25 discrete deposits, and 
mineralized districts are common. 

Features of the Kutcho deposits suggest that they formed at (or very near to) the 
water-seafloor interface in a structurally controlled depression, likely a half-graben 
type structure.  The Kutcho deposits have some uncommon features: the absence of 
lead and barite is likely due to the low potassium content of the volcanic host rocks 
(and presumably the associated rhyolite dome), and the abundant carbonate is 
probably of exhalative origin. 

Alteration associated with VMS deposits is well documented, and provides a valuable 
exploration tool in that the area of alteration is much larger (by a factor of up to 10–
100) than the actual sulphide deposit, thereby providing a much larger exploration 
target.  Extensive studies of the alteration around the Kutcho deposit have been 
undertaken, and the chemical composition of the alteration is well zoned about the 
hydrothermal vent areas.  This zonation allows the use of geochemical analysis of 
drill core within the alteration zone to provide vectors towards the hydrothermal vent 
area and, hopefully, the sulphide deposits.   

Geophysical techniques such as electromagnetic (EM) and gravity surveys are useful 
for locating conductors or possible sulphide concentrations.  EM methods can be 
used in airborne and ground surveys, but can also be used down drill holes to locate 
"off-hole" conductors, thereby effectively increasing the search area of a drill hole.  A 
large number of airborne and ground-based geophysical surveys have been 
completed on the Kutcho property and all high-priority targets have been tested; 
however, there are many lower priority targets that still require additional follow-up.

There are three known deposits that comprise the Kutcho Project and form a 
westerly plunging linear trend (see Figure 7.5).  From east to west, the deposits are 
termed the Main (previously known as Kutcho), Sumac, and Esso deposits.  The 
Main deposit comes to surface at its eastern end, whereas the Esso deposit occurs 
at depths about 400 m below surface.

Deposits, Drill Holes, and Surface Topography of the Kutcho Project 

 
Image view is to the South 

7.3.1 MAIN DEPOSIT 
The Main deposit has an elliptical, lenticular shape with approximate dimensions of 
1,500 m long, 260 m wide (down-dip), and 36 m maximum thickness.  The long axis 
of the deposit plunges to the west at about 12°, just slightly less than the regional fold 
axes.  The deposit is conformable with stratigraphy, dipping moderately to the north.  
There is a gentle warping of the deposit, such that the dip of the deposit changes 
from east to west and north to south.  The shallowest dip (about 38°) occurs at the 
southeastern edge and becomes progressively steeper (to about 63°) at the 
northwestern edge.  In general, the up-dip edge of the sulphide lens is narrow and 
pinches out, whereas the down-dip edge is thicker and interlayered with tuffaceous 
rock, giving the deposit an approximate flattened arrowhead shape in cross-section 
(Figure 7.6). 

In detail, the Main deposit is composed of three depositional cycles.  The cycles are 
interpreted to begin with pyritic mineralization, which then becomes more copper-rich 
and finally zinc-rich.  The cycles are variably separated by siliceous or carbonate 
exhalative material and minor volcanic ash and detritus.  Interpretation of the shape

of the sulphide zone, taken together with the observed volcanic and depositional 
textures of the enclosing rocks, suggests that the sulphide mineralization was 
deposited in a structural depression, likely a half-graben type structure.  Fine 
mineralogical layering and sulphide-ash, sulphide-silica, or carbonate inter-layering, 
as well as framboidal and "snowball" textures in both the sulphide and carbonate 
minerals, suggests quasi-sedimentary deposition at the seawater seafloor interface.  
Polished section analysis indicates that very little sulphide recrystalization has taken 
place.   

Sulphide mineralogy of the deposit is relatively simple, consisting of pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and bornite, with minor sulphide minerals chalcocite, 
tetrahedrite, diginite (and related minerals), galena, idiaite, hessite, and electrum.  
Gangue minerals include quartz, dolomite, ankerite, sericite, gypsum, and anhydrite.  
Fluorite and barite have been observed, but do not occur in volumetrically significant 
amounts. 

The internal stratigraphy of the Main deposit was determined by detailed drill core 
logging (Holbek and Heberlein, 1986) along a single longitudinal section of drill holes 
and is given in Figure 7.7.  The deposit appears to have formed from three 
hydrothermal-depositional cycles that begin with barren pyrite which grades into a 
copper-rich middle and zinc-rich top.  Depositional cycles are commonly separated 
by layers of exhalative quartz and/or carbonate and minor volcanic ash; however, 
continued hydrothermal activity results in sulphide replacement mineralization, which 
tends to blur grade boundaries in some areas.  Additional features also cause 
complexity to the internal sulphide stratigraphy, such as an irregular depositional 
surface, localized slumping of sulphide mineralization or chimney collapse, and late 
stage (post depositional) hydrothermal activity.  Areas of late overprinting by oxidized 
copper species and enrichment in precious metals are interpreted as indicators of 
vent areas, and occur along a linear trend on the down-dip side of the deposit, with 
two "hot-spots" near each end of the deposit.  However, no well-defined areas of 
classical footwall stringer mineralization have been identified by drilling. 

The upper contact of the sulphide mineralization is sharp, with almost no sulphide 
minerals occurring in the hanging wall rocks with the exception of scattered coarse 
grains of porphyroblastic pyrite.  However, alteration of feldspar to sericite and 
carbonate in the hanging wall is intense, and occurs for up to 50 m above the 
sulphide contact.  It is common for a small shear zone to occur at the sulphide-schist 
contact, which varies in thickness from 20–200 cm, and in many drill holes carries 
some grade.  The base of the deposit consists of nearly barren massive pyrite with 
interstitial quartz.  The contact between ore and the footwall pyrite zone can be either 
gradational or sharp.  Below the footwall pyrite zone is quartz-sericite schist with 
bands of generally barren massive to semi-massive pyrite.  The footwall pyrite 
content diminishes with depth away from the deposit, but extends to a maximum 
depth of 200 m below the central part of the deposit.  Although the footwall material 
appears incompetent in the drill core ("poker chip" cleavage), it holds up very well in 
the underground adit.

7.3.2 SUMAC DEPOSIT 
The Sumac deposit has not received much attention historically, due to its relatively 
low grades.  The shape of the deposit is primarily taken from conductance contours 
generated by a chargeability geophysical survey carried out during the mid-1980s.  A 
chargeability survey is carried out by putting an electrical current into a sulphide zone 
and measuring the change in the magnetic field due to electrical flow through the 
conductive (sulphide-rich) rocks.  A total of 14 drill holes at 100–200 m spacing 
define the Sumac deposit.  Better intercepts include 1.45% Cu, 2.56% Zn, and 
23.7 g/t Ag over 26.1 m, and 1.37% Cu, 1.9% Zn, and 26.2 g/t Ag over 23.4 m. 

The Sumac deposit is nearly (but not quite) continuous with the Esso deposit (across 
the historical property boundary), but sits within a local depression relative to the 
Main and Esso deposits.   

An additional 4 drill holes were completed in the Sumac deposit in 2005 by Western 
Keltic Mines Inc. (WKM).  These holes, drilled in the western part of the deposit, 
provided two of the best intersections within the deposit and helped establish the 
western end of the deposit.  Reinterpretation of the Sumac drill data suggests that 
the core of the deposit has a much steeper plunge than previously suspected, 
indicating that historical drilling in the deposit's eastern end was likely too deep and 
opening up more area for test drilling (see Figure 7.9).  The Sumac deposit is finely 
banded but massive and competent, and has the highest sulphide content (+90%) of 
the three deposits.  Alteration of the host stratigraphy around it is very similar to that 
of the other two deposits.

7 .3.3 ESSO DEPOSIT 
The Esso deposit was discovered as a natural consequence of following the trend in 
mineralization through the Main and Sumac deposit areas.  The Esso deposit occurs 
at depths of between 400–520 m below surface.  The Esso deposit, like the others, is 
an elongate lens shape with current dimensions of approximately 580 m in length, up 
to 100 m in width, and up to 21 m in thickness.  In general, there is zonation both in 
thickness and in grades from the central deposit area. 

Historical drill holes are spaced at approximately 10–30 m along sections that are 
variably spaced, usually at 60 m but some at 120 m (Figure 7.9).  WKM completed 
16 drill holes and wedge branches in the Esso deposit area in 2005, of which half 
were within the deposit and half were peripheral to the deposit.  Current and 
historical drilling is sufficient to define the overall size and geometry of the deposit.  
Minor changes along the deposit edges are possible with additional drilling, but these 
would not be significant with respect to tonnage, grade, or mine planning. 

7.3.4 OTHER MINERALIZATION 
Other zones of mineralization include the Footwall Zone (FWZ), and the Jenn Area.  
The FWZ occurs approximately 100 m stratigraphically below the Main deposit and 
slightly up-dip and to the east of the centre of the Main deposit.  The FWZ is 
relatively narrow, at 2–5 m thick, and relatively zinc-rich.  The mineralization was only 
systematically drilled up to the historical Esso-Sumac property boundary, but a 
number of drill holes by SMC (and more recently WKM) demonstrate that the FWZ 
does not extend for significant distances to the west or down-dip of its current 
position.   

The Jenn Area is on the eastern end of the property and received a fair amount of 
attention by EMC.  Although significant alteration and some local mineralization were 
intersected in a number of drill holes, no resources have been defined in the Jenn 
Area.  There are some structural and stratigraphic complexities in the region that 
make interpretation of drill data less than straightforward; however, airborne 
geophysical surveys did not detect significant untested conductors in the area, 
suggesting that any potential area deposits would be at considerable depths.

Historical exploration programs previously carried out on the Kutcho Property are 
described in Section 6.0: History.  Exploration work, consisting primarily of resource 
drilling, has been carried out by WKM in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  Most of this work is 
described in other sections of the report, primarily the following Section 7.5: Drilling.

Approximately 88,000 m of diamond drilling in 365 drill holes and 43 wedge branches 
has been completed on the property.  Most of the drilling was completed between 
1974 and 1983 (by EMC and SMC) with an additional 7,031 m in 28 exploration 
holes completed by ARM and Homestake in 1990, and nearly 16,000 m of drilling in 
87 holes completed by WKM between 2004 and 2006. 

The Main deposit is defined by 221 drill holes (Table 7.1).  The Esso deposit is 
defined by 33 pilot holes and an additional 43 wedge branches for a total of 76 
intercepts, of which 48 are within the deposit shell or wire frame.  The general shape 
of the Sumac deposit has been determined from both drill data and geophysical data, 
as there are only 14 drill holes in and around the deposit.

Locations of drill holes that define the Main deposit are displayed on a plan map, 
which also shows an approximate vertical projection of the deposit (Figure 7.8).  
Locations of drill holes defining the Esso deposit are shown in Figure 7.9. 

Drill collars and claim locations were surveyed periodically during exploration 
programs by McElhanney Engineering Services Limited (MESL) until 1983; all later 
WKM drill holes and many of the historical drill holes were surveyed or resurveyed by 
MESL in September 2006.  Previous surveys were surveyed in mine-grid 
coordinates, whereas the recent survey was carried out in UTM coordinates, and 
survey points that were not resurveyed were converted to UTM grid points by MESL.   

Most of the drill sites have been reclaimed, although many collars are still locatable 
and most of the drill core is stored on the property.  A new core storage area was 
constructed for the Esso deposit drill core in 1985, and all of it was moved there over 
the following six years.  The Sumac deposit core was stored on core racks in the 
area between the Main and Sumac deposits.  Due to decomposition of these racks, 
the core was recently removed and cross-stacked nearby, and the core racks were 
dismantled.  Approximately half of both Sumac and Esso deposits drill core was re-
logged in 1984 and 1985 (Holbek and Heberlein, 1986) using the GEOLOG system.  
WKM has recovered all available data (in both digital and paper formats) and merged 
it with current data into two master databases; one for resource work and a total 
exploration database.

Initial drilling in the Main deposit was carried out on 120 m spaced sections with drill 
holes spaced approximately 60 m along section lines.  This spacing was 
subsequently reduced to approximately 30 m spaced drill intersections along 60 m 
spaced sections, and recently WKM has been reducing the drill spacing in selected 
areas to 30 m or less.  Historical drill hole diameters are mostly BQ (38 mm) and 
recoveries were generally very good with only rare core loss in minor fault zones.  
The more recent drilling has been a combination of HQ and NQ in the Main deposit 
and NQ (or BQTW in wedge branches) within the Sumac and Esso deposits.  Most 
holes were drilled at -45° to -60° in order to intersect mineralization at close to 90°.  
Due to strong foliation dipping to the north, even vertical holes tend to flatten and cut 
the mineralization roughly perpendicular to its dip.   

The historical drill hole database for the Main deposit contained assays for copper, 
zinc, silver, and specific gravity (SG), with most holes containing assays for gold and 
approximately 60% containing assays for sulphur.  Historical drill data for the Sumac 
and Esso deposits contain results for copper, zinc, silver, gold, and specific gravity.  
There are 4,569 assay intervals within the total resource database, of which 1,589 
are new (WKM).  Of the remaining 2,978 historical assay intervals, 2,061 are in the 
Main deposit, 443 from the Esso side of the deposit, and 1,618 from the Sumac side.  
The assay intervals were generally longer on the Esso side, while the Sumac data 
commonly contained shorter intervals based on sulphide mineralogy.  Comparative 
statistics for the two historical data subsets are given in Table 7.2.

The SMC data set has a greater range than the EMC data set, partly due to samples 
having come from a larger area, but also because the individual sample lengths are 
smaller (a minimum 0.2 m and maximum 1.5 m, compared to Esso's minimum 0.4 m 
and maximum of 5.4 m).  The difference in grades reflects the higher grade of the up-
dip eastern part of the Main deposit, but is also a function of SMC taking more 
shoulder samples of lower grade.

The first drill holes into the Main deposit where carried out nearly simultaneously by 
EMC and SML in the summer of 1974, although within different areas of the deposit.  
The first two seasons of drilling were experimental, with relatively wide-spaced drill 
holes used to determine approximate extents of the mineralization.  In 1976, SML 
carried out a chargeability geophysical survey, which provided clear indications of the 
size of the conductive mineralization, as well as indications of the Sumac deposit.  
Shortly thereafter both companies adopted a grid approach to the location of drill 
holes.  A common grid for both companies was implemented later, with north-south 
grid lines spaced at 60 m.  The 60 m spacing (as opposed to the more common 
50 m) was chosen as it allowed for four subdivisions (if required) and better 
approximated the 100 and 200 foot line spacing used by EMC for initial soil 
geochemical surveys.  Consequently, almost 90% of the drill holes within the Main 
deposit are located along the grid lines.  Similar approaches were applied to the 
Sumac and Esso deposits. 

In 2004, initial large diameter (HQ) core drilling in the Main deposit was carried out 
by WKM to verify historical data and to obtain metallurgical samples.  The approach 
to drill hole locations for this program was to obtain a distribution of drill holes 
covering the entire deposit area, with specific drill hole locations placed where they 
would result in infilling areas of lower drill hole density.  Because the HQ drill was a 
skid-mounted rig, drill hole locations were restricted to areas accessible to such a rig 
with minimal road building.  The 2006 drilling program on the Main Zone was 
designed to infill the starter pit area on approximate 30 m centres. 

Sampling methods for drill core were similar for all of the exploration phases on the 
property.  Core size varied (as discussed in earlier sections) and sampling of the 
core using a mechanical splitter was initially used by both SML and EMC, with SML 
switching to a diamond saw after the first nine drill holes, and EMC switching after 
approximately 30 drill holes.  Splitting by diamond saw has been used ever since.  
Sample selection within mineralized drill core is more significant, and is discussed in 
detail in the following section.

Data verification and quality control and quality assurance for the Kutcho Project was 
studied extensively by AMEC (Chong, 2007) who worked closely with company 
personnel in order to determine that all historical data was suitable for use in 
resource or reserve estimates and that modern data met high standards for quality 
assurance and quality control. 

7.7.1 HISTORICAL  DATA 
Historical drill hole data (originally from Esso) were obtained from Barrick in the form 
of digital ASCII files derived from the original tapes used by Wright Engineers during 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 7-28 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

their work on the prefeasibility study.  The drill hole data was edited in ASCII format 
in order to load in Surpac Vision, a program from Surpac Software International.  
Data was plotted on sections and compared to sections within EMC and SMC reports 
and some of the original drill logs that contained assay information.  Not all holes 
were in the database, and those that weren't were entered manually from the drill 
logs.  In a few cases survey information was incorrect or missing, and had to be 
corrected or obtained from the original drill logs.  Original assay lab reports were 
available for most of the EMC data, but were not available for the SML data, and the 
typed drill logs were relied upon for verification. 

Neither EMC nor SMC documented their sampling and analytical protocol, but both 
companies typically carried out their work to the highest industry standards of the 
time.  Some of the EMC drill logs have duplicate sample data written adjacent to the 
original samples, suggesting that duplicate samples were a standard procedure.  The 
duplicate samples displayed normal expected variations between duplicates, and it is 
probable that the added values were re-analyses of sample pulps by a different lab.  
There is no documentation of any analytical problems.   

Both EMC and SML used the same drilling company (Arctic Diamond Drilling) and 
the same drills (Longyear 38 Flyable).  Core size was BQ and recoveries were 
normally excellent.  Due to the deposits striking approximately east-west and dipping 
approximately 45° to the north, most drill holes were drilled with azimuths of 180° and 
inclinations from -45° to -90°.  The steeper drill holes tended to curve into the 
foliation, consequently holes that began as vertical would flatten with depth, and the 
degree of drill hole curvature could on occasion be considerable.  The drill hole 
flattening was common to EMC, SML, and ARM drilling, but not as significant for 
WKM due to changes in drill and bit technology. 

Both EMC and SML logged core at camps on site, marked samples, and split core 
for analytical samples.  EMC used a manual splitter for the first three years and then 
switched to a diamond saw (preferable for massive sulphide mineralization), while 
SML used a manual splitter for the first year (nine holes) and a diamond saw 
thereafter.  EMC tended to take long samples of about 2–3 m lengths (to a maximum 
of 5.4 m) in the early years of exploration, but took shorter, more geologically 
constrained samples in the later years.  Additionally, in much of the early sampling by 
EMC, the geologists did not take shoulder samples, so the samples tend to start and 
end in significant grade.  Based on current experience with the deposit, it is unlikely 
that EMC missed any significant grade; however, grade of potential dilution will be 
more difficult to estimate.  SML sampling was good, with samples selected on the 
basis of geology and sulphide mineralogy, average sample lengths of about 1 m, and 
collection of shoulder samples.  EMC used Min-En Labs of North Vancouver (bought 
out by Bondar-Clegg in the 1990s) for almost all of their analytical work, while SML 
used ALS Chemex Laboratories (Chemex), also of North Vancouver.  Check 
samples for EMC were carried out by Terramin Labs in Calgary and SGS Lakefield 
Research Ltd. in Lakefield, Ontario.

Almost all of the sulphide intersections from EMC core were used for metallurgical 
research and are not available for inspection or resampling.  In contrast, SML 
quartered their core for metallurgical samples, and most of the remaining core was 
available on the property.  

7.7.2 CURRENT DATA 
WKM carried out diamond drilling programs on the Kutcho Project in 2004, 2005, and 
2006.  The 2004 program in the Main deposit consisted of 21 HQ drill holes which 
were drilled to verify historical drilling and to collect material for metallurgical testing: 
ten NQ drill holes and four BQTW wedge branches in or near the Esso deposit, and 
seven HQ drill holes in the Footwall Zone.  The 2005 drill program consisted of 16 
NQ drill holes in the Main deposit; four NQ drill holes in the Sumac deposit; four HQ 
drill holes and two BQTW wedge branches in the Esso deposit and two other drill 
holes.  The 2006 drill program consisted of 23 BQTW drill holes within the eastern 
part of the Main deposit.  Sampling methodology and analytical work is similar for all 
three programs. 

7.7.3 CORE SAMPLING 
Drill core was transported from the drill by truck or helicopter to the core logging 
facilities, situated adjacent to the Kutcho Airstrip approximately 8 km west of the drill 
area.  Core was geologically logged and marked for splitting, with approximately 70% 
of the deposit intersections also selected for metallurgical study, with the core sawn 
in half and the half-core metallurgical samples collected by a geologist and sealed in 
a labelled, nitrogen-filled bag.  The half-cores were then sawn into quarter core 
samples which the geologist collected, measured their specific gravities, placed the 
samples in plastic bags, and heat-sealed the bags closed.  The process was the 
same for core not being used for metallurgical samples, except that half-core 
samples were collected and placed into plastic bags, which were then sealed, but not 
packed in nitrogen.  Sealed sample bags were then placed into labelled rice bags for 
shipment to the laboratory.  Sample shipment bags were transported to Dease Lake 
or Smithers by aircraft and picked up at the aircraft hangar by the trucking company 
for transport to the laboratory.   

7.7.4 ASSAYING 
All routine analysis of drill core was carried out by Chemex of North Vancouver.  
Core samples (including blanks) were ground to 80% passing 100 mesh, and were 
analyzed (including standards) using induced coupled plasma (ICP) methods for 33 
elements following an aqua regia digestion.  Copper, zinc, and silver values above 
the ICP detection limits (10,000 ppm for copper and zinc; 100 ppm for silver) were 
assayed by atomic absorption methods following an aqua regia digestion.  All 
samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay in 30 g sub-samples, and sulphur was 
analyzed by Leco furnace.

Most core samples were measured for SG unless the rock was so highly altered as 
to render a measurement meaningless.  SGs were measured in the field by weighing 
the sample using an Ohaus scale in air and in water, with the SG calculated using 
the formula: 

Weight in air 
(weight in air – weight in water) 

Sample weights were accurate to the nearest tenth of a gram. 

Blanks and standards were inserted into the sample stream at a rate of one per 10–
20 samples and numbered consecutively with the core samples.  Field blanks 
consisted of non-mineralized limestone and rhyolite crush.  The WKM internal field 
standards were prepared in 2004 by collecting 30 kg of mineralized material from the 
dumps adjacent to the adit.  The material was visually hand-sorted into low, medium, 
and high-grade material, and shipped to Pioneer Laboratories in Richmond, BC for 
grinding and homogenization, with aliquots placed in laboratory supplied pulp bags.  
The WKM standards were assayed by three independent laboratories to ensure that 
the samples were fully homogenous and to determine the grades for the standards.  
For the 2006 drill program assays, commercial standards at three different copper 
and zinc grades were obtained from Canadian Resource Laboratories, and used in 
conjunction with the WKM internal standards.

The qualified person (QP) for this report has reviewed the extensive data verification 
done by AMEC and is of the opinion that data relied upon is a true and accurate 
representation of the geology of this project.  AMEC determined that individual table 
error rates fell within the ≤1% error rate considered sufficient for resource modelling 
at the prefeasibility level.   

The error rates are summarized as follows: 

• 0.3% error rate for 100% of the collar table data reviewed 

• 0.3% error rate for 23% of the down-hole survey data reviewed 

• 0.5% error rate for 6% of the geology table data reviewed (excluding pyrite 
field) 

• 0.1% error rate for 56% of the assay table data reviewed (Cu, Zn, Au, Ag, S, 
SGm and Hg) 

• 1.1% combined error rate for the assay table SML campaign SG data, SGm 
and S, representing a combined 8% of the data within those fields. 

• 0.0% error rate for the top 170 high-grade samples within the assay table.

The QP agrees with the AMEC assumption that the non-reviewed portion of the 
database will have similar error rates for the relevant tables and fields. 

The QP carried out a site visit on June 11, 2007 when he had the opportunity to 
examine drill core, sampling procedures, drill sites, property geology, and overall site 
layout.   

7.8.1 HISTORICAL  DATA 
Data verification of historical data has been carried out in a number of different ways, 
including verification of the digital data by double data re-entry of historical drill logs 
and original assay sheets (for EMC data),  statistical analysis and comparisons of 
various data sets, resampling of drill core (SML), and twinning holes (EMC). 

In the prefeasibility study Wright Engineers noted that there was no discrepancy in 
grades or metal ratios across the property boundary, and that the two drill holes 
adjacent to the bulk sample were very comparable in grade and thickness to the 
values obtained from the 100 tonne bulk sample.  Table 7.3 shows the grades 
obtained from the 4 by 3 m adit compared with the surrounding drill holes.  The drill 
hole grades are based on a cutoff that was not applied to the adit sampling, and 
there is a trend to higher copper in the up-dip and higher zinc in the down-dip 
direction.  A length-weighted average grade from the two holes adjacent to the adit 
(KT092 and KT025) is very similar to the length-weighted adit grades; however, in 
the adit sample the slightly lower grades combined with the greater thickness 
suggests that there is probably dilution from the margins of the mineralization.

Analytical results of two holes drilled in the Kutcho lens during the ARM/Homestake 
program in 1990 did not show a discrepancy in metal grades with nearby holes that 
had been drilled up to 10 years earlier.  Likewise, the WKM drill holes within the Main 
deposit generally gave very similar results to the average of the three nearest 
surrounding drill holes, with the exception that precious metal grades showed an 
approximate average 10% increase, likely due to improved analytical techniques.

7 .8.2 VALIDATION OF SML HISTORICAL  ANALYSES 
In order to verify historical drill results for the SML drill holes (where original 
certificates are not available), WKM conducted resampling of mineralized core drilled 
by Sumitomo between 1974 and 1982.  There are 129 SML drill holes in the project 
area, of which approximately 105 are within the Main deposit.  SML core had been 
previously resampled in 2004, and the new analyses were very similar to historical 
analyses; however, no CRM or standards were included during that investigation, so 
a second resampling program was undertaken (as per AMEC Americas Ltd. 
recommendations).  In order to provide corroboration for the historical data a total of 
137 samples were collected from 18 drill holes, spanning the range from K001 to 
K094.  SML core was sawn core and all of the remaining half-core or quartered core 
was collected for re-analysis.  The half-core was not quartered due to relatively poor 
core and core-box conditions after 30 years in the elements.  

A comparison between the historical data and the new assays is presented in Figure 
7.10 through Figure 7.14 for copper, zinc, silver, gold, and sulfur, respectively.  

Slopes and intercepts have been calculated using the Reduction to Major Axis 
method, which does not introduce underlying assumptions about which data set is 
correct, nor does it assume any dependence or independence between the sample 
pairs (as a linear regression does).  This method also allows for differences in 
population variance between the two data sets.  

The formula used for these calculations is y = mx + b (or b = y – mx), where b 
represents the intercept  Both x and y are known numbers (the mean values of the 
data sets), and m is derived from the standard deviation of the y data set divided by 
the standard deviation of the x data set.  

For copper, x = 1.55, y = 1.58, and m = 0.9350 (STDEVy = 1.607331, STDEVx = 
1.71899), therefore b = y – mx = 0.1285.

The above figure and those following show that the two data sets correlate well for 
copper and zinc.  The reproducibility of historical assays is limited by several factors.  
Split core shifting in the boxes through handling, and footage markers not always 
being legible, led to difficulties in collecting identical sample intervals.  As well, 
improved lab techniques may yield different results, as lower detection limits are now 
available.  However, given these challenges, the correspondence between data sets 
is remarkably good.  The few outliers in Figure 7.10, Figure 7.11, and Figure 7.12 
can be explained by either normal analytical variability or the previously noted 
challenges in obtaining true sample duplicates.

Using the formula from page 7-22 and the values for zinc, x = 2.48, y = 2.65, and m = 
1.0534 (STDEVy = 4.544127, STDEVx = 4.31382), therefore b = y – mx = 0.0095. 

With only a few exceptions, the agreement for zinc results between historical and 
new data sets is very good.  The most dramatic variances are from drill hole KT001, 
where both the near 10% and sub 1% zinc points could, in fact, be the same sample 
interval, but were possibly incorrectly designated during resampling.  The other two 
outliers cannot be easily explained, but may be due to incomplete sample intervals 
available for resampling leading to a higher-grade bias induced by a few high-grade 
zinc core pieces within the remaining sampled core. 

The chart for silver (Figure 7.12) contains more outliers and a wider spread in the 
correlation cluster.  At least two outliers are related to the KT001 sampling error 
noted for zinc.  Others could be explained by a silver "nugget" effect, where silver-
rich core pieces may have been included in the historic and resampled cores.  The 
overall correlation between historic and resampled core is reasonable, with a slight 
increase in overall grade likely due to improvements in contemporary analytical 
methods and equipment.

Correlation of gold results is severely limited by gold detection limits and historical 
reporting of gold assays in oz/t to three decimal places.  Combined with a predictable 
"nugget" effect exacerbated by the small historic core volumes, only a moderate 
correlation is revealed; however, average grades would be approximately equal, with 
slightly higher values expected from the modern analysis.  

Figure 7.14 shows that the two data sets correlate well for the sulphur % values.  
Given the mineralized interval's massive pyrite nature, a good correlation would be 
expected, and significant deviations would demonstrate errors in sampling over a 
non-mineralized interval.

A separate standard and blank Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) study has 
been done for the historical core intersection resampling.  Since all the standards 
were part of one sample submission batch, they are plotted as different samples.

As with blanks submitted during the 2006 drill sampling program, cross-
contamination is evident, but the absolute value of that contamination is within the 
range of analytical variability for most ore-grade samples.  Unequal chart axis ranges 
exaggerate the cross-contamination effect, and illustrate that it is more difficult to 
keep zinc from affecting the following sample.  The results are suggestive of 
incomplete labware cleaning between sample preparations. 

7.8.3 VALIDATION OF EMC HISTORICAL  DATA 
No sulphide intersections from EMC core were available for resampling; this was not 
such a critical issue, however, as analytical certificates were available for most of the 
data.  There has also been sufficient new drilling in the EMC part of the Main deposit 
to alleviate any concerns about historical analytical quality.  By the recommendation 
of consultants, WKM attempted to twin three historical holes.  Due to different 
deflections between the historical and modern drilling, it was difficult to keep the twin 
intersections proximal to one another, so distances between the parts of the drill 
holes vary from 3–15 m.  In general, the twin holes confirm the location of the 
mineralization, and show a general correspondence to grade variation or internal 
sulphide stratigraphy.  But because sample intervals differ and the drill holes cut the 
deposit at different angles, there is enough grade variation that it is difficult to draw 
conclusions about the analytical quality of EMC data.  However, the twin holes do 
confirm the presence and general tenor of mineralization.

7.8.4 CURRENT DATA 
The QA/QC program at the Kutcho Project has evolved since 2004.  Initially, 
analytical quality was monitored through the use of company standards and blanks 
and re-analysis of 5% of the data set at another laboratory.  In 2006, additional work 
was undertaken to ensure data homogenization and conformance to recommended 
values of the company and project standards.  Three different commercially certified 
standards were added to the program, a full range of standards and blanks were 
included in the re-analysis of samples by a different lab, and five drill holes were 
sampled and analyzed twice, providing information on sampling and analytical 
variance and precision.  With the exception of minor contamination of the blank 
samples, no issues with the quality of the analytical data were identified.  Analysis of 
blank samples showed a general correlation of the value of the blank with the grade

of the preceding sample, strongly suggesting some cross-contamination or carry 
over.  Further investigation and discussion with the lab confirmed that a certain 
amount of carry over is common, and, in the case of soft massive sulphide 
mineralization, may be more pronounced.  With the possible exception of a single 
sample, the amount of carry-over would be insignificant to separation of waste-ore, 
deposit interpretation, or resource estimates; however, better cleaning between 
samples by the lab is also a possible solution.

7.8.5 CHECK ANALYSES 
A total of 59 pulps (including some blanks and standards) were pulled from Chemex 
and sent to EcoTech Laboratory Ltd. (EcoTech) in Kamloops for re-analysis.  
Samples were collected from every 2006 drill hole and every analytical shipment, as 
well as being collected to span a range of copper and zinc values.  Results for all 
elements were plotted on X-Y scatter plots (copper included below, Figure 7.20).  
The scatter plots show that there is very little difference between the two laboratories' 
results.

There is only one property adjacent to WKM's Kutcho property.  A number of claims, 
some of which are contiguous with WKM's claims, were staked to cover the westerly 
extension of the Kutcho formation by Gary Belik.  These claims cover areas that 
were previously worked by both EMC and Noranda.  In 1997, Atna Resources Ltd. 
optioned the Belik claims, and carried out UTEM surveys and a diamond drilling 
program.  The program identified favourable stratigraphy which was altered and 
weakly mineralized, but did not encounter economic mineralization.

The Main Zone assay data is approximately lognormally distributed in all metals, and 
displays a fair amount of variability.  The gold distribution is strongly positively 
skewed, with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 1.77.  All of the metals exhibit 
evidence of bimodal populations, with both copper and zinc being distinctly bimodal, 
as evidenced by flexures in the lognormal probability plots.  These plots also 
illustrate some pronounced breaks in the higher percentiles.  Although these breaks 
can be used to determine thresholds for the capping of high-grade outlier samples 
before compositing, the qualified person opted to utilize a high-grade restriction 
approach, as detailed in Section 8.1.6: Composite Statistics.  

The statistics for the Esso and Sumac Zones exhibit similar features to those of the 
Main Zone, although there is a definite increase in variability, as seen in elevated 
COV values.  There are, however, far fewer data available in these zones. 

8.1.3  GEOLOGIC  (ROCK)  MODELL ING 
3D geological solid models of the Main, Esso and Sumac deposits were developed 
by Western Keltic Mines Inc. (WKM) and used as the bounding domains for grade 
interpolation in this estimate.  The general methodology was as follows: 

• Sections were plotted and checked against historical sections for accuracy 
of location and metal grades. 

• Polygons were generated on the sections to represent potentially mineable 
material, generally a US$15/tonne cutoff was used for the Main deposit and 
US$35/tonne cutoff was used for the Esso deposit; however, some lower 
grade material was included to maintain continuity in the down-dip direction 
and to maintain a minimum 3 m horizontal thickness.  No cutoff grade was 
used for the Sumac deposit, as the shell was matched directly to massive 
sulphide rock type. 

• The sectional polygonal interpretations were tied together to create 3D 
geologic solids that were then used to code the rock type block model used 
to constrain the grade interpolation. 

A 3D perspective view of the Main 3D solid is shown in Figure 8.3, and a 
representative section in Figure 8.4.

8 .1.4 DENSITY 
The specific gravity (SG) data used for resource estimation purposes is a 
combination of measured values and calculated values, and was tabulated by 
interval in the assay database table.  Sumac Mines Limited (SML) conducted SG 
determinations in the field using a "weigh in water, weigh in air" method, and also 
had ALS Chemex Laboratories (Chemex) of North Vancouver perform density 
measurements on uncrushed core from holes KT040 through KT049.  Additionally, 
SML went back to the old core and carried out SG measurements in the field on the 
main or significant grade parts of the intersections in most (but not all) of the holes 
drilled prior to hole 40.  

The calculated SGs are based primarily on various formulas relating the metal and 
sulphide content to SG, as documented in a March 2007 memorandum titled 
"Memorandum on Specific Gravity Determinations and Estimations for the Kutcho 
Project".  Sulphur and SG have a very strong correlation in the data that has both 
analyses, which is the majority of the database.  Wardrop has reviewed this report 
and considers the conclusions and methodology reasonable.   

The summary statistics of the SG data are shown in Table 8.1, where SG = Best 
Choice adopted, SGm = Measured SG, SGe = Estimated SG, and SGc = Calculated 
SG.

8.1.5 COMPOSIT ING 
The drill hole assay data was composited into 2.5 m down-the-hole composites 
within the Main Zone, Esso, and Sumac 3D solids.  This composite length was 
selected with reference to the block dimensions of 5 x 5 x 5 m, and to the occurrence 
of relatively narrow portions of all of the solids.  Composites that were <1 m long 
(40%) were discarded.  Given that the sectional interpretations were largely snapped 
to assay intervals, not many of these residuals were generated.  

8.1.6 COMPOSITE STATIST ICS 
The 2.5 m mineralized zone composites were then tagged with the rock code from 
the appropriate 3D solid, and this data was extracted for analysis and modelling.

8 .1.7 OUTLIERS AND DECLUSTERING 
The Main Zone composite data is approximately lognormally distributed, and 
relatively well behaved for most metals, with a COV of 0.85–1.13 for copper, zinc, 
and silver.  The gold distribution is strongly positively skewed, with a COV of 1.77.  
The gold distribution is unimodal, as opposed to the other metals, which exhibit 
evidence of bimodal populations.  The lognormal probability plots for the same 
sample set illustrate some pronounced breaks in the higher percentiles.  Based on 
these breaks, values were selected for high-grade restriction in interpolation.  High-
grade search restrictions were used to constrain isolated high-grade composites, 
both to reduce the metal at risk and to prevent unwanted smearing of high-grade 
values into low-grade areas.  The method imposes a smaller search ellipse (or 
shorter range of influence) on composites above a threshold value.  Composites with 
values greater than the established thresholds were not included in the estimation 
neighbourhood if they were not captured within the smaller search ellipse.  This 
method is considered to be a better approach than high-grade capping, because it 
allows isolated high-grade composites to have an influence on local blocks, while 
simultaneously preventing unwarranted smearing of high-grade.  

The statistics for the Esso and Sumac Zones exhibit similar features to those for the 
Main Zone, although there is a definite increase in variability, as seen in elevated 
COV values.  It should be noted, however, that there is considerably less data 
available in these zones. 

Clustering would be present if a disproportionately large percentage of intercepts are 
concentrated within a limited area of higher grade mineralization.  Given the overall 
spacing of the drilling, declustering of the data was not considered necessary in this 
case (noting also that ordinary kriging was used for grade interpolation). 

8.1.8 TOPOGRAPHIC SURFACES 
The bounding topographic surfaces used in the resource estimates were generated 
from a one metre topographic contour map created by McElhanney Engineering 
Services Limited and supplied by WKM.  

8.1.9 VARIOGRAM ANALYSIS 
There are several mathematical functions that measure variability in space; the 
qualified person finds that the correlogram, which is a variant of the semi-variogram, 
generally provides a stable estimate of spatial continuity.  The correlogram measures 
the correlation coefficient between two sets of data, comprising values at both the 
heads and tails of vectors with similar direction and magnitude.  For ease of 
modelling, the correlogram value is subtracted from one and is presented in a similar 
graphical form to the variogram.  In this report the correlograms presented this way 
are referred to as variograms.  Directional variograms were generated for the Main 
Zone composites using the SAGE2001 program, in 30° increments of azimuth and 
15° increments of dip.  The variogram parameters are summarized in Table 8.2.

Variogram analysis of the Esso/Sumac composites was inconclusive due to the low 
number of available samples.  Given the similarity between the deposits, the Main 
Zone variography was extended to these zones.

8.1.10 GEOLOGIC MODELL ING 
The 3D geological models of the Main, Esso, and Sumac Zones were used to code 
the rock type model in Gemcom GEMS modelling software.  The rock type model 
was first initialized with the "Air" rock code, and then all blocks below the topographic 
surface were set to a background rock code.  The 3D solids were then used to 
overprint blocks falling within the solids, with the percentage being stored to provide 
accurate volumetrics reporting (partial block model).  Additional 3D solids and 
surfaces were used to create a potential acid generating (PAG) model for use in 
waste planning.  The 2.5 m composites falling within the solids were tagged with 
corresponding rock codes, to allow for the use of "hard" boundaries (i.e., only 
composites falling within the modelled zones can be used for interpolating blocks 
coded by the solids). 

8.1.11 MODELLING PARAMETERS 
Table 8.3 shows the modelling parameters used to generate the grade models.  
Separate block models were developed for the Main Zone and for the Esso/Sumac 
Zones because of the significant strike distance between them.  Ordinary kriging was 
used for all areas, and three passes were utilized.  The initial pass used search 
distances at approximately half of the variogram range, with the second pass using 
search distances at twice the previous values.  The third pass utilized search 
distances double those of the previous pass.  The search ellipsoid orientation was 
kept constant for all zones.  The maximum of two samples per hole dictated that at 
least two holes were used to meet the minimum requirement of three samples.  A 
nearest neighbour model using the same search parameters was also generated for 
comparison purposes.

Following interpolation of the copper, zinc, gold, and silver grade models, a model of 
Copper Equivalent (CuEq) was generated using the following formula: 

CuEq = (%Cu*1)+ (%Zn*0.414) + (g/t Ag*0.00256) + (g/t Au*0.119) 

This equivalent is calculated using prices of US$2.36/lb copper, US$1.38/lb zinc, 
US$534.36/oz gold, and US$9.78/oz silver.  Metallurgical recoveries are 
87% copper, 79% zinc, 31% gold, and 37% silver.

Note: 

• the search distances for the Esso/Sumac model were increased twofold to 
account for the decreased number of composites available in these zones.  

• the ranges used for values falling above the restriction threshold were 12 x 
12 x 5 m in the X, Y, and Z axes. 

8.1.12 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIF ICATION 
The mineral resource has been classified with respect to the mean of distance to the 
samples used to interpolate a particular block, and the kriging variance relative to the 
drill hole spacing in strike and dip.  An average distance of 30 m and relative kriging 
variance of 0.6 (based on examination of kriging variance relative to pierce points in 
the plane of the deposit) was used to identify Measured material.  The average 
distance was increased to 70 m for Indicated material and an average distance 
greater than 70 m identified Inferred material.  The Main Zone classification relative 
to the drill holes is illustrated in Figure 8.7.

8 .1.14 MODEL VALIDATION 
A number of methods were used to validate the grade modelling: 

• visual comparison of block and composite grades on plan and section 

• global statistical comparison of block and declustered (nearest neighbour) 
composite grades  

• local comparison of block and declustered (nearest neighbour) composite 
grades. 

8.1.15 VISUAL COMPARISON 
Few discrepancies between block and composite grades were observed. 

8.1.16 GLOBAL STATISTICAL COMPARISON 
The mean of the block grades in the Main and Esso/Sumac Zones lie within the 
acceptable limit for global bias of ±5% of the mean of the declustered (nearest 
neighbour) composites. 

8.1.17 LOCAL COMPARISON OF BLOCK AND DECLUSTERED COMPOSITE GRADES 
Swath plots were generated to check for local estimation bias.  Average kriged block 
values on a series of parallel slices are plotted against the average declustered 
(nearest neighbour) values in the three primary model directions (row, column, and 
level), as illustrated in Figure 8.8 and Figure 8.9. 

Kriged blocks generally honour the distribution of declustered (nearest neighbour) 
sample grades, indicating that there is no local bias.  Deviation notes generally 
correspond to areas where the number of samples is low.

8 .1.18 MINERALOGICAL AND METALLURGICAL CORRELATION – MAIN  DEPOSIT  AND ESSO 
DEPOSIT 
Mineralogically, the Main deposit and Esso deposit are essentially identical and can 
be expected to respond in the same way quantitatively and qualitatively to the 
mineral separation processes. 

8 . 2  M I N E R A L  R E S E R V E  E S T I M A T E  

National Instrument 43-101 defines a mineral reserve as "the economically mineable 
part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource".  Only Indicated or Measured 
resources have been used to establish the probable mineral reserves. 

Resource and reserve tonnages and grades were derived from a geological block 
model representing the Main, Esso, and Sumac deposits.  Block models and solids 
for both deposits were developed from the drill data.

8.2.1 ESSO DEPOSIT  MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
Surpac Minex Group software was used to examine the block model and solids, 
representing Esso and Sumac deposits.  Horizontal sections of the deposits (plan 
view) were produced at 5 m vertical intervals and vertical sections were produced at 
10 m intervals to examine thickness and dip angle of the deposits.  A minimum of 
3 m horizontal width of the deposit was applied to estimate a minimum mineable ore 
thickness. 

A recovery factor of 90% and a dilution rate of 15% were used to estimate the total 
amount of diluted probable mineral reserves.  The volume of the ore and waste 
multiplied by the density of ore and waste defined the diluted mineable reserve 
tonnage.  Waste density was taken to be 2.7 t/m3, while ore density varied by level 
averaging at 3.3 t/m3.  Ore reserve calculations conservatively assumed dilution to 
contain no mineral value.

A cutoff grade of Cdn$62/tonne NSR was used, assuming a net mine return (NMR) 
of Cdn$62/tonne, which includes mining, processing, and general and administrative 
costs. 

Concentrate trucking to Stewart and estimated ocean shipping costs to a smelter in 
Japan were included in the NSR calculation. 

8.2.2 MAIN DEPOSIT  MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
Whittle software was applied to the geological block model of the Main deposit to 
conduct pit optimization as described in Sections 9.1.6 through 9.1.11. 

8 . 3  M I N I N G  R E C O V E R Y  A N D  D I L U T I O N  

Dilution is defined as the ratio of waste to ore (waste tonnes/ore tonnes).  Dilution of 
ore during stoping will result from drilling and blasting overbreak, or variations in 
hanging wall and footwall regularity and ground conditions.  At this stage, without a 
geotechnical assessment and with limited information of ground conditions, dilution is 
hard to predict.  Only external or production dilution was considered in this study. 

For the Esso deposit, which will be mined by underground methods, dilution was 
assessed based on mining method and deposit parameters.  Mining dilution was 
estimated by applying 1 m of hanging wall and 0.5 m of footwall with the long-hole 
(LH) stopes and 0.5 m at each side of mechanized cut-and-fill (MCF) stopes, 
resulting in an average dilution rate of 15%, which is considered appropriate at this 
level of study.  Grade of dilution has conservatively been assumed as having no 
mineral value, whereas in practice dilution will contain mineral which will contribute to 
revenue. 

A recovery factor of 90% was assumed for mineral reserve estimation in the Esso 
deposit, which will account for ore left in the pillars, losses during the stoping due to 
hanging wall or footwall contact irregularities, and losses during mucking from the 
stopes.  

For the Main deposit, which will be mined by open pit methods, dilution was forecast 
to be 5%.  Recovery is expected to be 95% due to the ability to apply more stringent 
grade control in the open pit environment 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 9-62 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

9 . 0  M I N I N G  

For most of the life of mine, ore will be produced simultaneously from the Main 
deposit by open pit methods and from the Esso deposit by underground methods. 
The production rate from both deposits will be adjusted to provide a constant feed of 
2,190,000 tonnes run-of-mine ore to the process plant, providing an eight year mine 
life (Table 9.1). 

Mining will be scheduled in each deposit to access the highest grade ore as early as 
possible to provide the best cash flow to the project.  From a cash-flow perspective, 
the project benefits from the highest grade ore in the main deposit being close to the 
surface, and also that this outcropping will require minimal pre-stripping. 

In contrast, accessing the Esso deposit will require over two years of underground 
development work, which will cost over $30M.  To minimize the negative impact of 
the cost of this development on the project economics, underground mining will be 
deferred as late as possible in the project.  In this way the main benefit of mining the 
Esso deposit, namely increasing the mineral reserve, will still accrue to the project, 
but the negative impact of the capital cost will be reduced due to the effect of time on 
the value of money.

The Main deposit underlies a north-sloping hillside and will be mined by open pit, 
with the pit access road entering the pit at the west end.  It is approximately 1,500 m 
long, ranging from 1,300 m to 1,650 m above sea level. 

Mining of the Main Zone deposit will involve moving 100 Mt of waste and 15 Mt of 
ore. Pit design and optimization was facilitated by the use of proprietary mine design 
software. Mining equipment will comprise a bench drill, a diesel shovel and front end 
loaders, and haul trucks. 

9 . 2  U N D E R G R O U N D  M I N I N G  –  E S S O  D E P O S I T  

Esso orebody will be mined by underground mining methods, and will be accessed 
through twin declines driven simultaneously from the portals located near the crusher 
station.  Ore will be mined by a mix of long-hole stoping and mechanized-cut-and-fill 
methods.  

In addition to the twin ramps, a ventilation raise will be developed to provide a return 
airway to surface, and to connect each sublevel to its exhaust decline.   

Development will be driven with electrohydraulic twin-boom jumbos, and the broken 
rock will be mucked from the face by a 4.6 m3 load-haul-dump (LHD) and then 
hauled to surface waste dump by 30 tonne trucks.

Extensive metallurgical testwork (including process mineralogy) has been conducted 
since 1975 by Esso Minerals Canada Ltd., Coastech Research, Sumitomo Mining's 
Niihama lab, and SGS Lakefield Research (SGS), and included batch tests, locked 
cycle tests (LCT), and a pilot plant campaign.  These programs investigated the 
copper-zinc differential flotation process, as well as copper-zinc bulk flotation 
followed by copper-zinc separation.  The results obtained from main testwork 
programs were not consistent but similar in some degree of range.

The indications are that the mineralization of the deposits is complex.  Fine grind is 
required to obtain sufficient liberation of the target minerals.  According to the most 
recent test results and historical metallurgical findings, bulk flotation followed by 
copper and zinc separation is recommended for the prefeasibility study.

The main sulphide mineral is pyrite, with minor amounts of chalcopyrite and 
sphalerite with lesser amounts of bornite and trace amounts of chalcochite, covellite, 
and galena present.  The 70% liberation sizes of the copper minerals, sphalerite, and 
pyrite are approximately 20 to 30 µm. 

Pyrite occurrence is dominantly as coarse and blocky grains with interstitial 
sphalerite and chalcopyrite, and also as fine granular particles within a matrix of 
bornite and, to a lesser extent, chalcopyrite.

Bond Work Indexes (WI) were determined on various mineral samples and indicate 
that the samples are moderately soft for ball milling and soft for rod milling.

Extensive testwork done to date indicates that differential flotation will be more 
successful than bulk flotation. 

Further testwork recommended for the feasibility study includes: 

• further investigation of reagent regime optimization.  This should include 
screening more effective zinc depression reagents, reducing reagent 
consumption 

• optimize flowsheet, including differential flotation and bulk flotation 

• further determine grindability, in particular SAG mill specific energy 
consumption by JK drop-weight test or SPI test.  Energy consumption 
determination of regrinding is recommended, especially energy 
requirements for ultra fine regrind by an Isamill for the copper rougher 
concentrate 

• free gold recovery by gravity separation 

• thickening and filtration testing on the concentrates generated should be 
conducted to generate data to size the dewatering equipment.

A 6,000 t/d process plant is designed for the Kutcho Project to operate 365 days per 
year at an annual process rate of 2,190,000 tonnes.  The process plant will operate 
two shifts per day at 92% availability. 

The ore will be crushed by a 950 x 1,250 mm jaw crusher to 80% passing 150 mm, 
and then ground to 80% passing 74 µm in a SAG and ball mill grinding circuit.  The 
ground ore will be processed using copper-zinc bulk flotation followed by copper-zinc 
separation; copper and zinc rougher concentrates will then be upgraded by three and 
four stages of cleaner flotation, respectively.  Bulk flotation tailings and zinc flotation 
tailings from copper-zinc separation circuit will be sent to the tailings disposal facility.  
Copper and zinc concentrates are thickened and then pressure filtered before load-
out. 

The average dry concentrate production is forecast to be: 

Copper Concentrate: 102,012 t/a 
Including: 31,212 t/a copper 

219 kg/a (7,040 oz/a) gold 
20,807 kg/a (668,958 oz/a) silver
 

Zinc Concentrate: 71,448 t/a 
Including: 38,904 t/a zinc

The bulk flotation tailings, zinc rougher scavenger flotation tailings, and first zinc 
cleaner scavenger tailings will be directed to the final tailings standpipe, and then 
discharged by gravity flow to the tailings discharge facility through an approximately 
2 km long pipeline with a 559 mm Ø.   

Decant water will be recycled to the process water tank by reclaim water pumps 
installed on a barge at the east end of the pond.

The final concentrate and intermediate streams will be monitored by an on-line X-ray 
diffraction analyzer, which includes pH control and reagent addition systems.  The 
assay data will be fed back to the central control room and used to optimize process 
conditions.  Routine samples of feed, intermediate products, final products, and 
tailings will be collected and analyzed in the assay laboratory where standard assays 
will be performed.  The data obtained will be used for product quality control and 
routine process optimization.

The plant control system will consist of a Distributed Control System (DCS) with PC 
based Operator Interface Stations (OIS) located in two separate control rooms.  The 
DCS, in conjunction with the OIS, will perform all equipment and process 
interlocking, control, alarming, trending, event logging, and report generation.

The tailings management facility consists of a zoned earth and rockfill embankment.  
An upstream low-permeability till zone will provide seepage control through the 
embankment, while the downstream shell will be constructed from competent, non-
acid generating (NAG) run-of-mine (ROM) waste rock.  This type of embankment 
was selected to take advantage of locally available construction materials.  Due to 
the large upstream catchment area and the local climate, non-contact surface runoff 
will be diverted around the facility and discharged downstream of the tailings 
embankment throughout life of mine. 

The geotechnical conditions at the proposed tailings site were based on 
investigations carried out and reported by Golder Associates in 1984.  In general, the 
subsurface conditions consisted of a veneer of peat and organic soils (generally less 
than 0.2 m thick but locally exceeding 1 m in thickness) overlying up to several 
meters of colluvial, fluvial, or weathered till deposits, underlain by predominantly silt 
till deposits which ranged from clayey silt to silty sand till.  The till is in turn underlain 
by schist bedrock. 

It is anticipated that the tailings dam will be operated as a conventional tailings slurry 
storage facility.  A starter dam will be constructed to provide approximately two years 
of tailings storage, which will be constructed sufficiently in advance of mill 
commissioning to acquire the necessary water for operations.  The operational plan 
includes two raises of the dam over the life of mine. 

During operation, the tailings will be spigotted from the crest of the tailings dam, 
which will form a small beach. The design provides for a 4–5 m freeboard throughout 
operation.  

A diversion channel will be constructed upstream of the maximum anticipated extent 
of the tailings impoundment, which will discharge into Andrea Creek approximately 
350 m downstream of the downstream toe of the tailings facility.

Seepage from the proposed tailings management facility through the embankment fill 
and foundation will be intercepted and collected in a dam and pumped back into the 
tailings facility.

Over the LOM an estimated 100 Mt of waste rock will be generated.  The waste will 
be trucked from the pit and built up in successive lifts by end-dumping.  Of this total, 
75 Mt is NAG rock and 25 Mt is PAG rock.  Waste rock dumps will consist of a 
permanent NAG rock dump and a temporary PAG rock dump. 

Non-acid generating (NAG) waste rock will be permanently stored to the northeast of 
the pit, between the pit, Andrea Creek, and the tailings impoundment.  Potentially 
acid generating (PAG) waste rock will be temporarily stored adjacent to the northeast 
corner of the pit, next to the NAG waste rock pile.  At closure the PAG waste will be 
returned to the pit for permanent disposal.   

1 2 . 3  E F F L U E N T  T R E A T M E N T  

The tailings water consists of recycled process water, reclaimed pit water, 
precipitation, runoff from the process plant and areas upstream of the tailings dam, 
and recycled seepage from under the tailings dam.  The excess water that is not 
recycled to the mill will be treated to meet the appropriate water quality standards 
before being discharged to the environment.   

The effluent treatment plant will be a conventional two-stage circuit, in which the 
effluent will be clarified by adding lime and the subsequent addition of ferric sulphate 
to precipitate heavy metals.   

Main streams of water generated during the mine operation include mill tailings 
solution process water, water from the open pit and underground mine, and runoff 
from the mill site area.  Seepage from under the tailings dam will be recycled to the 
tailings at a net zero change.

Domestic and industrial wastes will be treated during the construction phase and

Electrical power will be generated on-site by multiple modular diesel generator units.  
The number of generator sets will be N + 1, where N is the number of units required 
to meet the maximum power demand at any time.  N is determined to be six 3.6 MW 
generator units.  Each generator will be capable of 10% extra power generation to 
cover momentary surges in power demand. 

No provision is made in this study for recovering waste heat from engine coolant, 
engine-lubricating oil, and exhaust gases, although a preliminary analysis shows that 
these would provide sufficient recovered heat for all surface buildings under winter 
conditions.

Diesel and propane are the only fuels to be used on the mine site.  Diesel will power 
all mobile equipment, including light vehicles.

A total of 38 million litres of diesel will be consumed per year at full production.  
Diesel will be brought to the mine site by road tanker and stored in a one million litre 
steel tank or tanks adjacent to the power plant, sufficient for 1.5 weeks of operation.

The mine will be accessed by a 120 km resource road connecting the mine with 
Highway 37 just south of Dease Lake.  Building this access road forms a part of this 
project. Currently there is a track from Highway 37 to the mine site, which fords the 
various streams and rivers along its route.   

This will be an all-season, year-round, radio-controlled single-lane access road, and 
its construction involves 21 bridges, 2 of which will be over 60 metres long, 29,000 
metres of culvert and 250 metres of open-bottom arches.

Operating the mine requires the delivery of 49,000 t/a of inbound general cargos and 
38 million litres of fuel per year to the mine, and outbound shipments averaging 
173,000 t/a of wet concentrate, (240,000 t/a in the first year reducing steadily to 
144,000 t/a in the final year), to either Stewart, British Columbia, or Flin Flon, 
Manitoba.  

Inbound cargo will typically be sourced at Vancouver and transported by truck 
through Prince George to the mine site; other general cargos will be transported by 
line-haul truck from the vendor's point of origin directly to the mine site.  Grinding 
balls will be shipped directly from the vendor in Kamloops.  Pebble lime will be 
sourced from Pavilion, BC, where Graymont has a Lime Plant. 

Fuel will be transported by rail to Terrace, BC, where it will be transferred to 
63,500 litre capacity road tankers for transport to site.  

Concentrate will be hauled by truck, either to an existing marine terminal in Stewart 
for export to an overseas smelter, or to Kitwanga where it will be loaded into CN 
railcars for transport to Flin Flon, MB, for processing at the Hudson Bay Mining & 
Smelting Co. Ltd. smelter. 

Concentrate trucks will be of the dual hopper, side-dump design with a net capacity 
of 42 t.  Hydraulically actuated hopper covers will eliminate escapement of fugitive 
concentrate dust.

Concentrate exported through Stewart will be trucked to an existing terminal in 
Stewart where it will be stored to await the arrival of the vessel.  

The existing terminal at Stewart has two concentrate storage sheds with capacities of 
25,000 t and 15,000 t.  The Huckleberry Mine is currently using this port.  Various 
plans to transport concentrate from the Kemess Mine and bcMetals' (now part of 
Imperial Metals Corp.) proposed Red Chris Mine, and coal from Fortune Minerals' 
proposed Klappan Mine have been suggested, but there are no definite plans as yet. 

On this basis, it has been assumed that it will not be necessary to construct 
additional concentrate storage facilities at Stewart.  Preliminary discussions with the 
terminal owner indicate that there is space available for currently projected 
production and that approval is in place to construct an additional concentrate

storage shed, if required.  It is likely that additional truck wheel wash and 
containment facilities will be installed prior to the Kutcho Project's start up. 

Arrow Transport Ltd operates a railcar-loading terminal in Kitwanga where the 
concentrate will be loaded into 90 t net capacity CN rail cars.

The majority of mine employees will travel to the mine by chartered plane from 
Smithers to Dease Lake and then be bussed to mine site, with a minority of 
employees commencing their journey to mine site at Dease Lake. 

Limited numbers of personnel will fly into the mine's airstrip from Smithers.  Since the 
airstrip will have no runway lights or guidance system, it will not be available for use 
at night or during extreme fog, snowfall, or bad weather.  Emergency night-time 
landings or take-offs will be made possible through the use of flares.

The Kutcho Project is subject to the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act 
(BCEAA) and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA).  The BCEAA 
requires that large projects undergo an environmental assessment (EA) and obtain 
an EA Certificate before they can proceed.  The CEAA applies when a federal 
department or agency is required to make a decision, such as issuing a permit, 
license, or authorization on a proposed project. 

The EA process commenced with the submission of a Project Description Report to 
the BC Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) in July 2005.  The Kutcho Project 
was initiated into the BC EA process through the issuance of a Section 10 order on 
29 July 2005.  Pursuant to the Canada-British Columbia Agreement for 
Environmental Assessment Cooperation (CEAA, 2004), the provincial and federal 
processes are expected to be integrated into a harmonized review, with the EAO 
taking the lead.

The Kutcho Project will be subject to the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) 
enabled by the Fisheries Act.  WKM will need authorization to have the Kutcho 
Project tailings impoundment added to Schedule 2 (Tailings Impoundment Areas) of 
the MMER.  The regulations require WKM to achieve the specified effluent discharge 
standards, to implement a comprehensive Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) 
program, and to provide compensation for the harmful alteration of fish habitat.  An 
approved Fish Habitat Compensation Agreement is required for the latter.

Extensive effort has been placed on the characterization of the Kutcho Project area 
over the years.  In 2006, WKM conducted a program of baseline studies to complete 
the collection of information necessary to prepare the EA application and to develop 
management and monitoring plans.  For some disciplines, studies were extended 
into 2007 to further bolster the level of information available. 

Required baseline studies already underway include: 

• meteorology and air quality

• soils 

• ecosystem mapping and vegetation 

• wildlife 

• wetlands 

• archaeology 

• country foods 

• socioeconomics 

• hydrology 

• hydrogeology 

• aquatics and fisheries resources 

1 6 . 4  S T U D Y  A R E A S  

Baseline studies have been carried out at two general scales: broad (Regional Study 
Area) and fine (Local Study Area).  The Regional Study Area covers approximately 
305,000 ha and is located within the Stikine Ranges which form a part of the larger 
Cassiar Mountains.  The Local Study Area includes the proposed mine site area and 
a two kilometre wide corridor (one kilometre on either side of the centre line) 
surrounding the proposed access road.

The Kutcho project is located in an area of overlap of the traditional territories of the 
Tahltan and Kaska nations.  Consultation activities have occurred in the Tahltan 
communities of Iskut, Telegraph Creek, and Dease Lake. (Dease Lake has both First 
Nations and non-aboriginal residents).  Consultation activities have occurred in the 
Kaska communities of Good Hope Lake and Lower Post. 

The Tahltan Nation and the Kaska Nation have both been active in the Pre-
Application of the BC EA Process, including active participation Working Groups 
established by the EAO, review of Section 11 Order under the BC Process, and input 
to the Terms of Reference. 

Baseline socioeconomic studies have been conducted in consultation with both the 
Tahltan and the Kaska nations. 

Three additional (non-aboriginal) consultation communities have been identified and 
consulted: Smithers, Terrace, and Stewart. 

Primary study communities based on proximity to the project include Dease Lake, 
Telegraph Creek, Iskut, Good Hope Lake, Lower Post, and Stewart. Smithers and 
Terrace have been identified as secondary study communities due to their roles as 
the primary service centres for the northwestern BC region.   

Land and Resource Use, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge data-gathering is 
proceeding towards establishing Traditional Knowledge Agreements.

Acid base accounting (ABA) and acid rock drainage/metal leaching (ARD/ML) 
studies were initiated in the Kutcho Project area in the mid to late 1980s, and further 
work commenced in 2005 after the project was reactivated.  Subsequent sampling in 
late 2006 collected additional samples throughout the upper parts of the hanging wall 
rocks. 

The results of ABA and ARD/ML studies suggest that five Mt of potentially acid 
generation (PAG) rock could be produced by mining the Main deposit.  It is not 
possible to predict the precise location of the PAG rock, and it is anticipated that a 
blasthole ABA program will be required during mining. 

1 6 . 7  I M P L I C A T I O N S  F O R  W A S T E  M A N A G E M E N T  

The results of ARD/ML testing show that the waste rock, pit walls, and mill tailings 
are composed of PAG material.  These components will need to be managed to 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 16-91 0752370200-REP-R0004-00

address potential metal leaching and acid generation during mine operations and 
during the post-closure phase.  The long-term strategy is to submerge PAG material 
to minimize acid generation and to address the elements released from sulphide 
minerals under non-acidic conditions. 

Tailings will be managed by subaqueous disposal in the tailings impoundment.  
Water accumulating in the tailings pond will be treated to meet the discharge 
standards stipulated under the MMER and provincial water quality objectives before 
being released into the environment.  The effluent treatment plant will remain 
operational after mine closure until the quality of water in the tailings pond is suitable 
for direct discharge to the environment. 

It is proposed that waste rock will be managed in two stages: operations and post-
closure.  During mine operations the waste rock is expected to be stored in a 
temporary pile next to the open pit.  The pile will be up-gradient of the tailings 
impoundment.  Surface runoff from the waste rock will be collected by a network of 
ditches and diverted to the tailings impoundment.   

At mine closure, the waste rock will be bulldozed into the open pit.  The pit will be 
allowed to fill with water forming a pit lake that will submerge the waste rock and a 
substantial area of the pit walls.  Like all mine effluents, any discharges from the pit 
will be required to meet MMER and provincial water quality objectives prior to release 
to the receiving environment.   

Additional ARD/ML studies are planned to provide a better understanding of ARD 
production.  The studies will focus on: 

• ongoing on-site monitoring of the ARD cribs and ARD/ML seeps in Sumac 
and Andrea Valleys 

• additional ARD/ML studies, including analysis of the Sumac and Esso 
deposits and laboratory-based column testing 

• ARD/ML survey of the access road.

The Kutcho project will employ approximately 300 persons during the construction 
phase.  Workers' shifts will follow a three-weeks on/one-week off rotation.  During 
operations (based on an 8 year mine life) the Kutcho Project will employ 
approximately 250 workers.  During decommissioning, the project is expected to 
employ approximately 50 workers. 

Indirect jobs will predominately be created in the construction, transportation, 
environmental, and services sectors.  The consumption of direct and indirect salaries 
will further create induced employment, primarily in service sector industries.

The economic effects of the Kutcho Project have been generated by BC Statistics 
and are predicted to be: 

• economic output (estimated to amount to $880.25 million) 

• an estimated direct GDP of $120 million, which at this stage only reflects 
direct household income 

• direct tax revenues estimated at $77 million, with the federal and provincial 
governments receiving roughly equal shares of the total 

• industries supplying goods and services (including purchased construction 
services) used by the Kutcho Project are expected to increase their output 
by $530 million, and add another $211 million to the province's GDP 

• indirect employment is estimated at 3,491 people, and tax revenues 
received as a result of the activities of supplier industries are estimated at 
$32 million.

Construction is scheduled to start in October 2008 and concentrate to be produced in 
November of 2010.  This is an aggressive but achievable program, necessary to 
achieve revenue in the shortest time possible.  

Major phases of the Kutcho Project include the following: 

• submit Environmental Assessment (EA) application............. NOV 2007 

• receive EA Certificate ............................................................SEP 2008 

• apply for Special Use Permit (SUP) .......................................SEP 2008 

• receive SUP...........................................................................OCT 2008 

• start access road construction ...............................................OCT 2008 

• start tailings dam and plantsite earthworks/construction........ FEB 2009

• plant fully operational ............................................................ NOV 2010 

1 7 . 1  P R E C O N S T R U C T I O N  L O G I S T I C S  

Key to maintaining the schedule is establishing the site construction infrastructure on 
time.  Preconstruction infrastructure includes construction workers' accommodation 
and associated facilities, sewage treatment plant, workshops, material receiving 
areas, water supply, electrical power generation, and warehouses. 

The main means of getting materials and equipment to the mine site will be by truck 
via Highway 37 and the 120 km access road. Material and equipment travelling along 
the coast of BC by ship or barge will dock at the port at Stewart, BC, and then be 
transported by truck along Highway 37 and the 120 km access road to the mine site.

The construction of the 120 km all-weather road is a critical element of the project 
schedule. Prior to its construction, equipment, personnel, and materials can be 
moved to the mine site by three modes of transport: 

• by plane, landing at the refurbished existing airstrip approximately ten 
kilometres west of the mine site 

• by helicopter 

• by rough-terrain trucks capable of travelling the 120 km track and of fording 
rivers and streams. 

To save time on the construction schedule, earthmoving equipment and limited 
amounts of construction materials will be moved onto site prior to the completion of 
the all-weather road via a combination of the existing track and a pioneering road 
built on the access road alignment.  This will allow early site capture and the plant 
site and tailings dam earthworks to be performed in parallel with the construction of 
the access road.

Mine site construction is planned to start in February 2009 with work on the 
accommodations, plant site, and site roads. 

Earthworks for the plant site area and the tailings dam will be predominantly fill, using 
material from open pit pre-stripping.  For this reason, open pit mining equipment 
should be procured and put into operation early in the project.  This will reduce 
overall project cost by using mine-owned equipment rather than contractors' to 
perform the majority of construction earthworks.

The Kutcho Project will be developed, operated, and closed with the objective of 
leaving the property in a condition that will mitigate potential environmental impacts 
and restore the land to its pre-mining land use and capability.  Closure and 
reclamation activities will be carried out concurrent with mine operation where 
possible, and final closure and reclamation measures will be implemented at the time 
of mine closure. 

The primary objective of the reclamation plan will be to return, where practical, all 
areas disturbed by mining operations to their pre-mining land use and capability.  
Before exploration began in the Kutcho Project area, the principal land use was as 
wildlife habitat that supported hunting, guide outfitting, trapping, and some general 
outdoor recreation.  

The following goals are implicit in achieving this primary objective: 

• the long-term preservation of water quality within and downstream of 
decommissioned operations 

• the long-term stability of engineered structures, including the waste rock 
dumps, open pit, and tailings impoundment 

• the removal and proper disposal of all access roads, structures, and 
equipment that will not be required after the end of the mine life 

• the long-term stabilization of all exposed erodable materials 

• the natural integration of disturbed areas into the surrounding landscape, 
and the restoration of a natural appearance to the disturbed areas after 
mining ceases, to the best practical extent 

• the establishment of a self-sustaining cover of vegetation that is consistent 
with existing forestry and wildlife needs.

At the end of mine life the Main pit will be allowed to flood. The pit is expected to 
flood to the low point of the pit rim (at 1,570 m elevation) from where it would 
discharge towards Sumac Creek.  A channel will be constructed from the point of 
discharge from the pit to divert the flow to the tailings dam.  More detailed 
hydrogeological studies will be undertaken at the feasibility stage to refine the 
flooding model for the pit.   



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 18-99 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

Potentially acid-generating (PAG) rock stored at the northeast of the Main pit will be 
backfilled into the pit following closure.  PAG waste rock will be placed in the deepest 
parts of the pit.  Once placed, the PAG rock will be covered with a 5 m layer of 
compacted non-acid generating (NAG) waste rock to isolate the PAG rock from the 
pit lake.  A compacted till layer may be placed over the NAG rock to further 
hydraulically isolate the wastes. 

ARD/ML is expected from the unflooded PAG footwall (the south wall of the pit) after 
closure.  Loading from this wall is expected to decrease as the pit floods and parts of 
the wall are inundated.  However, metals and acidity loading from the unflooded PAG 
rock exposed on the footwall above the pit lake are currently assumed to continue in 
perpetuity.  This is expected to make the pit water unsuitable for direct discharge to 
the environment and necessitate the use of water treatment. 

An alternative being assessed by WKM will be to mine the footwall to remove the 
PAG rock and leave the unflooded pit highwall composed of NAG rock.  The PAG 
waste rock generated by doing this would be placed in the pit following closure with 
the other PAG rock removed during mining.   

At the end of mining, all machinery and materials such as mining equipment, piping, 
pumps, and electrical cables will be removed for resale or disposal at an approved 
facility.  Any suitably inert materials will be left in the pit for disposal.  As well, inert 
non-salvageable building materials from the demolition of the site facilities will be 
placed in the pit for disposal.  The materials will be compacted and buried under a 
layer of NAG waste rock.   

1 8 . 2  U N D E R G R O U N D  M I N E  

After closure, all machinery and equipment will be removed from the underground 
workings.  The mine openings (portal and vent raises) will be hydraulically sealed 
with concrete bulkheads and the workings will be allowed to flood.   

1 8 . 3  W A S T E  R O C K   

Over the mine life an estimated 100 Mt of waste rock will be generated.  During 
mining operations, the waste will be trucked from the pit and built up in successive 
lifts by end-dumping.  Of this total, approximately 75 Mt is NAG rock and 25 Mt is 
PAG rock.  Waste rock dumps built during life of mine will consist of a permanent 
NAG rock dump and a temporary PAG rock dump. 

The NAG waste rock will be permanently stored to the northeast of the pit, between 
the pit, Andrea Creek, and the tailings impoundment.  The PAG rock will be 
temporarily stored adjacent to the northeast corner of the pit, next to the NAG waste 
rock pile.  The base and toe areas of the temporary PAG dump will consist of a layer 
of NAG rock to isolate the PAG from the underlying surface.  A drainage channel will

be constructed along the eastern perimeter of the temporary PAG dump to direct 
runoff and seepage into the tailings dam.   

Additional design considerations for the temporary PAG dump include progressive 
capping with a till cover to reduce infiltration and the placement of a crushed 
limestone layer above the NAG rock foundation as ways to reduce the release of 
metals and acidity from the dump.   

At closure the PAG waste will be returned to the pit for permanent disposal, either by 
means of one or more rock chutes constructed in the pit wall or by truck haulage 
where chutes are not possible due to pit geometry.  The rock will be regraded into 
the deepest parts of the pit, along with the NAG base layer and any impacted soils 
underlying the temporary PAG dump.  Once placed, the PAG rock will be covered 
with a layer of compacted NAG waste rock to isolate the PAG.  If required, a till cap 
may be placed over the NAG cover to further isolate the PAG wastes from the pit 
lake expected to form after flooding. 

The NAG waste dump will be regraded and recontoured to provide natural slope 
angles that match the surrounding environment.  The space left by the relocation of 
the temporary PAG dump will be used to regrade the dump to a lower elevation and 
flatten slopes to natural angles.  A thin layer of fine grained NAG rock will be graded 
over the dump surface which will then be covered by a layer of soil.  The soil layer 
will be fertilized and reseeded with local native species to develop a stable vegetative 
cover.  

1 8 . 4  T A I L I N G S  I M P O U N D M E N T  A R E A  

The tailings impoundment area (TIA) consists of the tailings dam, water dam, and 
tailings retained by the dam, plus related infrastructure such as seepage capture 
dams, diversion channels, and the spillway.  Flows and seepage from the waste rock 
dumps and the open pit will flow by gravity into the tailings impoundment.  Drainage 
from the plant site area will also flow downhill into the impoundment. 

Water cover will be maintained over the tailings during operations, with a small beach 
exposed along the dam. Following closure the water level will be raised to flood the 
tailings and provide a minimum water cover depth of 1 m.  The dam will be 
constructed to ensure a long term water cover over the tailings that will prevent the 
onset of ARD/ML. 

Water treatment of the dam water is expected to be required for a period following 
closure, due to the release of dissolved metals from the tailings.  This metal release 
is expected to decrease over time. Dam water will be pumped to the treatment plant 
and treated.  Treated water that meets the discharge permit requirements will be 
discharged into Andrea Creek.  During treatment the water level will be maintained at 
a level that prevents discharge over the dam spillway.  



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 18-101 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

Once the dam water meets the discharge permit requirements, water treatment of 
the tailings dam will cease.  Drainage from the open pit will then be redirected from 
the tailings dam and sent directly to the treatment plant.  The tailings dam will be 
allowed to discharge over the dam spillway directly into Andrea Creek while 
maintaining sufficient water cover over the tailings.   

The diversion channel and associated structures will be decommissioned and 
reclaimed when the dam water meets discharge permit requirements.  The channel 
will be filled in with the soils stockpiled along its length and seeded.  Structures 
diverting the tributaries into the channel will be removed.  The streams draining into 
the diversion will be returned to their natural flow path and reclaimed where 
necessary.  Water from these streams will be allowed to flow into the tailings dam 
and discharge over the spillway into Andrea Creek.  Depending upon the tailings 
impoundment water balance and flow requirements for Andrea Creek, 
decommissioning of the diversion channel may be staged over several years to 
maintain flows in Andrea Creek and permit the raising of the tailings dam level. 

1 8 . 5  W A T E R  T R E A T M E N T  

Water treatment will be required for water discharged to the environment during the 
operational phase of the mine, and after closure until water discharged from the 
tailings dam meets the discharge permit requirements.  After closure, water from the 
open pit, tailings impoundment, and potentially the underground mine will require 
treatment to remove metals and acidity from the discharge.   

An HDS lime treatment plant will be constructed on-site during the operational phase 
of the mine to treat contaminated mine water.  This plant will pump water from the 
tailings dam and treat the water for discharge.  The volume of water treated from the 
dam will be managed in order to prevent discharge over the spillway and also to 
maintain an adequate cover over the tailings.  Sludge produced by the treatment 
plant will be disposed in the open pit. 

Flows from the open pit and waste dumps will be directed to the tailings dam during 
operations, and this configuration will also be maintained after closure.  However, as 
metal loadings from the tailings decrease over time and become an insignificant 
contaminant source to the dam water, the operation of the plant may be realigned to 
only treat discharge from the open pit.   

Currently it is not possible to determine how long water released to the environment 
will require treatment after mine closure, but it is conceivable that it will be required in 
perpetuity.  Under this scenario, the treatment plant will require long term 
maintenance and periodic reconstruction.  

During mine operation, alternative treatment methods will be assessed and 
considered for the post-closure phase.  Passive treatment options will be evaluated 
as a means of reducing manpower requirements for the site. Water management

strategies will also be assessed and optimized to minimize the volumes of water 
requiring treatment.   

1 8 . 6  M I N E  S I T E  F A C I L I T I E S  

Buildings and structures that comprise the mine site facilities (mill, camp, power 
station, administration, maintenance shop, laboratory, site roads, fuel storage, and 
explosives storage) will be removed at closure.  These facilities will be dismantled or 
demolished.  Salvageable materials will be removed from site and sold.  Hazardous 
wastes will be removed from site and disposed of in an approved facility.   

The majority of the non-hazardous, inert building materials will be disposed of in the 
site landfill or placed in the bottom of the open pit and covered with a layer of NAG 
waste rock.  Concrete footings will be broken up and disposed of in the open pit.  Any 
metal-contaminated soils will be removed and disposed of in the open pit.  
Hydrocarbon-contaminated soils will be excavated and treated on site in a landfarm.  
Once successfully treated, these soils will be placed in the landfill or the open pit.   

Following removal of the facilities and any associated contamination, the disturbed 
areas will be regraded, capped with topsoil where needed, fertilized, and seeded with 
native species.  Mine site roads will be scarified and seeded, with all stream 
crossings returned to their pre-mining condition.  The site landfill will be closed using 
best practice methods.   

1 8 . 7  A C C E S S  R O A D  

Road access to the site will be required as long as the water treatment plant remains 
in operation.  The road surface, security gates, bridges, and culverts will be 
maintained during this period.   

If it is determined that road access is no longer required, the access road will be 
reclaimed.  Bridges and culverts will be removed, with the stream crossings regraded 
to their pre-mining form.  Road surfaces will be regraded to shed water from their 
surface and then scarified to encourage vegetation growth. 

1 8 . 8  A I R S T R I P  

The airstrip will be reclaimed following closure.  The timing of its decommissioning 
will be based on the need for fixed-wing access to the site after the mine ends 
production.   

The airstrip will be scarified and the site fertilized and seeded with a local seed mix.  
Buildings, structures, fuel tanks, and drums will be removed from the site.  Any

hydrocarbon contaminated soils will be excavated and sent to the site landfarm for 
treatment.   

1 8 . 9  P O S T - C L O S U R E  M O N I T O R I N G  

The level of post-closure monitoring will be a function of the environmental 
performance of the mine site.  Monitoring requirements are expected to reduce over 
time as the potential impacts to the receiving environment decrease.  However, 
under the current scenario, water treatment may be required for a long period, 
possibly in perpetuity.  This will necessitate a post-closure monitoring program of 
similar length.   

Long-term monitoring requirements will be developed in detail during the operational 
phase of the mine life.  During the active closure and reclamation phase, where the 
mine is being decommissioned and reclaimed, monitoring will continue at the same 
level as during the operational phase.  However, once the major closure and 
reclamation activities are completed and the mine moves into the post-closure phase 
the monitoring requirements will decrease.  Post-closure monitoring will likely consist 
of the following: 

• water quality monitoring of applicable sampling stations, including the 
treatment plant discharge, tailings dam, open pit discharge and downstream 
flows on Andrea and Sumac Creeks 

• environmental effects monitoring, including sediment, benthos, and fisheries 
studies to assess effects on the aquatic receiving environment 

• engineering inspections by qualified persons of the tailings impoundment, 
open pit, and all engineered structures, including the water treatment plant 
and landfill. 

Water quality monitoring will be done on a regular basis by the on-site water 
treatment plant staff. It is assumed that daily measurements of the plant inflows and 
outflows will be required as part of the plant operation.   

Monitoring requirements will decrease once the tailings dam discharge is suitable for 
direct discharge into Andrea Creek and the geotechnical stability of the engineered 
structures is demonstrated.  However, water quality and environmental effect 
monitoring will be required as long as operation of the water treatment plant is 
required.

Markets for the mineral concentrate produced from the Kutcho Project are 
necessarily loosely defined at a prefeasibility study level, due to the unwillingness of 
potential purchasers of mineral concentrates to discuss terms at so early a stage in 
the project. 

However, markets for mineral concentrates are sufficiently well understood by 
Wardrop's engineers to be able to state that the mineral concentrates from the 
Kutcho Project are of a quality that will find a market with smelters in Asia or 
elsewhere. 

For the sake of this study, a smelter in Japan is the assumed destination for the 
mineral concentrate, which allows ocean freight costs to be defined, a necessary 
input to the economic assessment of the project. 

Smelter terms used in this study are based on Wardrop engineers' knowledge of the 
market for mineral concentrates, and such estimates of smelter terms are considered 
sufficiently accurate for this level of study.  Details of assumed smelter terms and 
ocean freight costs are provided in Section 1.21: Economic Evaluation. 

Wardrop recommends the use of an independent third party for smelter terms and 
metal price forecasting at feasibility level.

The Basis of Operating Cost Estimate is by quotation from suppliers and equipment 
vendors on major items, and by allowances based on the experience of Wardrop 
engineers of costs on similar current projects for minor items.  The accuracy of the 
estimate is ±25% and is deemed suitable for evaluating the viability of proceeding to 
feasibility study level. 

Sources used for establishing mining labour rates included Western Mining 
Engineering's published figures, recent Wardrop projects for the same area, current 
quotes from several underground contractors, and labour rates at similar mining 
operations in British Columbia. 

Productivities, equipment operating hours, personnel, and supply requirements were 
estimated for each type of mining activity based on 10 hour shifts.  Underground 
equipment operating cost estimation has been based on hourly equipment operating 
costs provided by mine equipment suppliers, Western Mine Engineering Inc., 
published data, and the experience and knowledge base of Wardrop engineers. 

Quotes for major mining supplies such as explosives, drilling supplies, ground 
support, ventilation tubing, piping, and electrical cables were obtained from the 
suppliers.  Allowances have been made for material wastage where applicable. 

The following assumptions were made for the operating cost estimation: 

• 365 working days per year 

• all production activities including mine development and pre-stripping, ore 
production, and mine services will be carried out by company personnel 

• shift schedule will be two ten-hour shifts per day, seven days per week. 

Underground production operating costs were estimated for various widths of 
longhole stopes of a standard 30 m height, and for mechanized cut-and-fill mining 
methods.  Truck haulage productivities and costs and mine services costs were 
estimated and applied to the mine schedule as haul distances and haul methods 
change over the life of mine. 

Mineral Processing Plant unit costs are based on ore tonnage treated in the plant at 
the rate of 6,000 tonnes per day, 365 days per year.  Staffing is based on two 12-
hour shifts per day.  Labour rates are based on current rates at similar mines in 
British Columbia.  Mill liner and reagent costs are based on quotations, and 
consumption is based on metallurgical testwork and vendor-supplied data.  Tailings 
management and disposal are included in the process plant operating costs. 

Unit processing rates were estimated for the following: 

• staffing 

• processing plant supplies 

• tailings and effluent treatment.

Power generation costs have been derived from input data from two power 
generation equipment vendors.  Power requirements have been predicted throughout 
the mine life, and are based on details of all electrical equipment.  Diesel is the 
largest input cost for electrical power generation, and is priced at mine site by 
quotation. 

Transportation costs have been estimated for transporting concentrate on B-Train 
(BDT) from mine site to Stewart, and from Stewart to a smelter in Japan in bulk 
ocean-carriers.  Costs for each segment of the shipping route have been derived as 
follows: 

• Mine Site to Highway 37 Junction (120 km): truck haulage costs derived 
from information supplied by haul truck vendors. 

• Highway 37Junction – Stewart (398 km): truck haulage costs derived from 
information supplied by haul truck vendors. 

• Truck unloading, concentrate handling and bulk ocean carrier loading in 
Stewart: costs based on quotation from Stewart Bulk Terminals Inc. in 
Stewart, the operator of the Stewart bulk terminal. 

• Ocean carriage from Stewart to smelter in Japan: derived from Wardrop 
engineer's knowledge of costs from similar projects. 

While incoming mine supply transportation costs might reduce by utilizing the free 
back-haul on empty concentrate trucks returning to the mine from Stewart, this has 
not been allowed for in the estimate.  

Transport costs for incoming mine supplies, material, and equipment have been 
included in the unit cost for each item.

The capital cost estimate is divided into preproduction capital and sustaining capital.  
Preproduction capital is all capital spent prior to the first production of concentrate 
from the process plant.  Sustaining capital is all capital spent after the process plant 
comes on stream.

Economic evaluation indicates a pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 23% and a 
pre-tax net present value (NPV) of Cdn$154 million at a discount rate of 8.0%.  The 
pre-tax base case financial model is calculated within the following parameters: 

• mine construction will start in 2009 with commissioning in 2010 

• mining from the Main deposit will be continuous throughout the life of mine, 
and mining from the Esso deposit will take place from years 4 to 8 

• 3 year average metal prices 

• 3 year average diesel and propane prices 

• 3 year average US/Canadian exchange rate 

• assumed current net smelter terms. 

The model was prepared on a pre-tax basis. 

No allowance has been made for the cost of future agreements with First Nations. 

Variations of the base case are presented to show the effect of using two-year 
historical metal prices, current metal prices, and predicted future metal prices.  

2 2 . 1  N P V  A N D  I R R  S U M M A R Y  

This study presents the predicted NPV and IRR for the project, and a sensitivity 
analysis of the project to key variables including metal prices, exchange rates, and 
operating and capital costs.  

Initial and sustaining capital has been considered on a year-by-year basis for the life 
of project.  Initial capital comprises all capital expenditure prior to first production of 
mineral concentrate from the process plant; sustaining capital comprises all 
subsequent capital expenditure, including equipment replacement based on 
predicted equipment life.  Contingency varies by project area, depending on the 
predicted level of risk.   

Salvage costs are based on 10% of the initial direct process capital cost. 

Reclamation costs are not provided in this study.  An allowance of Cdn$28.3 million 
is included in the financial evaluation to balance salvage value of equipment and 
working capital recovery at end of mine life.

Working capital of Cdn$22.3 million is included in Year 1, being three months of the 
direct operating cost. 

The discounted cash flow rate of 8.0% is considered an industry standard. 

The net revenue is defined as the gross revenue less costs incurred subsequent to 
concentrating, which includes transportation, insurance, and refining.  No provision is 
made for deducting mine operating costs for this calculation.  Operating cash flow is 
defined as the net revenue less mine operating costs. 

The summary of pricing scenarios is shown below.

IRR and NPV were considered.  Figure 22.1 and Figure 22.2 show the sensitivity 
trends, and Figure 22.3 shows the cash flow projection.   

The project is most sensitive to exchange rate and metal price.  The project NPV is

The payback period for the base case is 2.6 years, being the time required after 
revenue is first received in year 1 to achieve break-even cumulative cash flow.  The 
payback period is based on the annual un-discounted cash flows.  There is no 
consideration for inflation, interest, or depreciation in this calculation.

The following NSR royalties are included in the economic evaluation: 

• for prefeasibility study terms, Barrick has a royalty over 40% of the Main 
deposit and Sumac has a royalty on the remaining 60% of the Main deposit 
based on the property definition per the acquisition agreements.  This split 
may be adjusted based on detailed mining plans produced in the feasibility 
study 

• commencement of commercial production for the Sumac Property starts at 
the beginning of year 1 

• ore from the Main deposit Barrick claims will be completely mined out in 
years 1-3  

• Sumac claims will be mined from year 1 to year 8, with royalties in effect 
from years 4-8 

• Barrick has a royalty on 100% of the Esso deposit 

• underground mining of the Esso deposit will commence year 4 and end in

Based on assessments for similar projects at the prefeasibility stage, the Kutcho 
Project appears to be no more risky than many that have previously proceeded to 
successful development.  This project will stand the best chance of success by 
adhering to the developed (and necessarily augmented or updated) risk 
management strategies.   

A recommendation is that, during feasibility studies, the risk assessment mitigation 
plans should be reviewed at the regular team meetings.  The overall risk assessment 
should also be revisited by the project management team (Western Keltic Mines Inc., 
Wardrop Engineering Inc., Rescan Environmental Services Ltd., and AMEC) at least 
once during feasibility engineering as well as at the beginning, middle, and end of 
construction.  When revisiting the assessment, the appropriateness of the 
remediation strategies can be evaluated, but risk items can also be added to the risk 
register as appropriate. 

2 3 . 1  R I S K S  –  G E O L O G Y  A N D  R E S E R V E S  

DILUTION AND RESERVE LOSSES 
Geological risk exists in the difference between the predicted and actual deposit 
shapes, potentially leading to higher dilution and reduction in mineral reserve 
tonnage.  This risk can be mitigated by one or more of the following: 

• monitoring production drilling to delineate the deposit, and adjusting the rock 
mined accordingly to reduce mining waste rock 

• increasing definition drilling to delineate the deposit, and adjusting the rock 
mined accordingly to reduce mining waste rock 

• for underground mining, using mechanized cut-and-fill or other selective 
mining methods which allow convoluted, discontinuous, and narrow 
orebodies to be mined without excessive dilution 

• using smaller diameter blastholes at closer spacing in narrow, convoluted, or 
discontinuous sections of the orebodies 

• in open pit mining, employing grade control practices based on the clearly 
visible delineation of ore and waste at both footwall and hanging wall 
boundaries.

Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

OPEN PIT GROUNDWATER INFLOW 
Groundwater might occur in greater quantities than predicted, leading to higher 
pumping and explosives costs.  

Mitigation — dewatering wells can be installed around the pit perimeter to draw down 
the water table and reduce inflows to the pit. 

UNDERGROUND MINE GROUNDWATER INFLOW 
Groundwater inflow might be greater than anticipated and impede mining operations. 

Mitigation — install more pumping capacity, and grout to stem localized inflows.   

2 3 . 2  R I S K S  –  M I N I N G  

UNDERGROUND BACKFILL  REACTIV ITY 
The pyrite content of backfill might prove to be chemically reactive, consequently 
producing sulphur dioxide and consuming oxygen, creating a danger to underground 
workers. 

Mitigation — monitoring of reactivity of backfill and gases produced, good ventilation 
practices, and worker training.  

UNDERGROUND GEOTECHNICAL  INFORMATION 
There is currently insufficient geotechnical information for underground mine design 
to be done with confidence. 

Mitigation — mine design for this study has used conservative assumptions, which 
will be confirmed or modified by detailed geotechnical assessments done at the 
feasibility study level. 

OPEN PIT GEOTECHNICAL  INFORMATION 
There is currently insufficient geotechnical information to design with confidence the 
final configuration of the footwall pit wall, especially considering the calcite bonding of 
the bedding planes of the sheared sericites, which might degrade and weaken on 
being exposed. 

Mitigation — the mine design for this study has been based conservatively on the 
assumption that the footwall final pit wall will be at a shallower angle than the 
bedding planes of the footwall material.

Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

MIN ING CONTRACTOR NON-PERFORMANCE 
There is a risk that the mining contractor will fall behind on schedule, and incur cost 
overruns resulting from various causes. 

Mitigation — closely monitoring and managing the mining contractors' progress to 
eliminate avoidable overruns, and to minimize unavoidable overruns by addressing 
them early.  Unavoidable overruns will be covered by the contingency allowed in this 
study's capital cost estimate. 

NON-AVAILABIL ITY  OF MIN ING PERSONNEL 
There is a risk that general numbers of personnel and certain key individuals 
required for underground mining will not be available when required. 

Mitigation — retain the services of the mining contractor to cover the shortfall until 
the appropriate personnel can be hired. 

NON-AVAILABIL ITY  OF MIN ING EQUIPMENT 
There is a risk that mining equipment will not be available when required. 

Mitigation — retain the services of the mining contractor, or the mining contractor's 
equipment, to cover the shortfall. 

Other mitigating tactics include purchase of mining contractor's equipment, or the 
purchase of more readily available second-hand equipment. 

PLANT COMPLEX AND CAMP COMPLEX LOCATION 
The Plant and Camp Site proximity to the open pit is such that workers/camp 
personnel will require evacuation during pit blasting. 

Mitigation – Assess plant and camp site location outside a minimum 500 m radius of 
the pit shell to ensure risk of fly rock is acceptable and limit noise/dust exposure. 

2 3 . 3  W A S T E  M A T E R I A L  H A N D L I N G  A N D  S T O R A G E  

PAG ROCK IN  NAG WASTE ROCK PILE  
Potentially acid-generating (PAG) waste rock not returned to the open pit at closure 
(as a result of misidentification or mixing with non-acid generating (NAG) waste rock) 
might lead to the generation and release of acidic water after closure. 

Mitigation — close geological monitoring and operational control to ensure PAG 
waste rock is placed in the correct location on surface to facilitate return to the open 
pit on closure.  Further mitigation comes from the fact that the gabbro rock which 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 23-122 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

forms the hanging wall tends to be self-neutralizing, thus reducing the potential for 
generation and release of acidic water.  In addition, both surficial and subterranean 
leachate from PAG waste rock left on surface at closure will report to the tailings 
dam, where it will be handled in accordance with the mine closure plan for treating 
effluent. 

WASTE ROCK DUMP FOUNDATION SEEPAGE  
Infiltration and seepage into waste rock pile results in contaminated groundwater 
outflow downstream of the dump toe.  

Mitigation – Investigate till cover below foundation of dump to ensure it blankets the 
area thoroughly and provides an impervious layer for seepage infiltration.  Where till 
is thin or absent, add a suitable thickness of an engineered till cover.  

WASTE ROCK DUMP FOUNDATION INFORMATION   
Geotechnical information on the foundation characteristics is limited.  Dump storage 
capacity may be compromised because of poorer than anticipated foundation 
conditions and/or dump configuration  

Mitigation – Investigate foundation characteristics in critical areas such as near the 
open pit, creek areas and infrastructure.  Consider excavating poor foundation 
material and replacement with more competent material to enhance dump stability.  

TAIL INGS VOLUMES HIGHER THAN ANTIC IPATED 
The tailings volumes could be higher than anticipated due to increased ore volumes 
or decreased in-situ densities within the tailings management facility. 

Mitigation – regular monitoring and inspection of impoundment levels to assess filling 
rates.  If filling rates are higher than anticipated, more frequent and/or higher raises 
would be required.  The ultimate embankment would be higher and the diversion 
channel would require relocation to a higher elevation.   

BREACHING OF DIVERSION CHANNEL 
An extreme storm event, a snow slide, or insufficient inspection and maintenance of 
the diversion channel could result in a local blockage which could lead to overtopping 
and breaching of the diversion channel.  This would cause increased flows into the 
tailings facility while repairs are made. 

Mitigation – Should the diversion channel be locally breached the tailings 
management facility will be designed to provide suitable freeboard to handle 
temporarily increased flow.  Pumping rates from the tailings pond might also be 
temporarily increased.  Other measures include lowering pond levels in the fall 
and/or winter when inflows to the facilities are low to increase the available freeboard 



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 23-123 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

prior to the spring freshette.  Sensitivity analyses can be completed to assess the 
impact of diversion overflow and tailing impoundment storage/design. 

POOR PERFORMANCE OF TAIL INGS IMPOUNDMENT AREA 
Poor performance of the tailings impoundment area such as excessive seepage, 
deformation, or insufficient freeboard could result in release of tailings to the 
environment. 

Mitigation – In addition to appropriate design and construction measures, a robust 
instrumentation, monitoring and inspection plan will be required.  Given that the 
tailings management facility is located at an active mine site and will be filled over 
time there is ample opportunity to assess the performance of the dam to ensure that 
the design assumptions are valid.  Changes in operating procedures could be 
implemented and remediation of the embankment (e.g. construction of buttresses, 
toe drains, slope flattening, grouting, etc.) could be carried out as required.  

2 3 . 4  R I S K S  –  P R O C E S S I N G   

PLANT RECOVERY RATES AND CONCENTRATE GRADES 
The metallurgical testwork developed for the prefeasibility study is based on 
composites that are of higher than the average grade. 

Mitigation — Testwork is recommended to confirm the concentrate recoveries and 
grades concurrent with the feasibility study, and be included in the report. 

ESSO DEPOSIT  METALLURGICAL RESULTS 
Although the Esso deposit is comparable to the Sumac deposit, there is no 
metallurgical testwork to confirm the recoveries and concentrate grades. 

Mitigation — Testwork is recommended to evaluate the Esso deposit using the 
flowsheet developed for the Kutcho deposit. 

SAG MILL  SIZ ING 
No SAG mill testwork has been done to accurately size the SAG mill. 

Mitigation — The SAG mill will be sized conservatively to insure the mill throughput 
and size reduction requirements will be met.  The mill will be re-sized if samples 
become available. 

MILL  ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
There are significant high power consumption units in the mill building which have 
not been accurately sized, such as the tower mills and Isamills.   



 

 

 Western Keltic Mines Inc. 23-124 0752370200-REP-R0004-00 
Technical Report on the Kutcho Property – British Columbia, Canada  26/09/2007 
 

Mitigation — The equipment have been sized conservatively.  Testwork is 
recommended to evaluate identification of power savings that could reduce the 
capital and/or operating cost in the feasibility study. 

TAIL INGS PIPELINES FREEZING SOLID 
It is possible that pipelines to and from the tailings dam might freeze and cause an 
interruption to process plant production. 

Mitigation — a spare pipeline has been included to be used in this eventuality.  
Additionally, these pipelines will be insulated. 

AVALANCHE HAZARDS 
Access road alignment has been arranged to avoid all potential avalanche hazards. 

There are no avalanche hazards affecting the mine site infrastructure. 

2 3 . 5  R I S K S  –  P O W E R  G E N E R A T I O N   

Generation of electric power will be by multiple diesel generator units, which must be 
shut down from time to time for regular maintenance and major overhaul.  To provide 
sufficient power when a generator unit is out for maintenance, the number of diesel 
generator unit will be N + 1, where N is the minimum number of units to provide the 
necessary power.  This arrangement does not cover the eventuality of a breakdown 
occurring in one of the operating units at the same time that a unit is out for regular 
maintenance.  Should this occur, not enough electrical generating capacity would be 
available to run the mine at full capacity. 

Mitigation – procedures will be established whereby plant maintenance, which would 
inevitably have to be performed, will be done during such a generator outage; in this 
way, overall plant availability and project economics will remain unaffected.  

2 3 . 6  R I S K S  –  L O G I S T I C S  

Transport of hazardous materials to and from the mine site by air or road presents a 
hazard to the environment in the event of an accidental spill.

2 3 . 7  R I S K S  –  C O N S T R U C T I O N  

There are risks that the project schedule slips due to one of the following reasons: 

• project finance delay 

Mitigation — ensure that the appropriate resources and efforts are directed 
early to secure financing. 

• non-availability of key personnel (management, engineering, supervisory, 
artisans) 

Mitigation — ensure early placement of contracts, prompt and effective 
recruiting at start of project, and the expanded use of contractors and 
consultants. 

• non-availability of construction equipment (including cranes, modular site 
buildings, aggregate plant, etc.) 

Mitigation — ensure early placement of orders for purchase and contracts 
for lease of construction equipment, followed by effective expediting. 

• non-availability of contractors (mining, construction, earthworks, catering) 

Mitigation — obtain early commitments from contractors. 

• long lead times on capital equipment delivery 

Mitigation — ensure early order placement, followed by appropriate 
expediting.  Additional mitigation can come from using alternate equipment 
types and vendors or used equipment. 

• increased excavation cost and time due to worse-than-anticipated 
geotechnical conditions 

Mitigation — assess site conditions early to allow time for schedule 
adjustment as required.  Use contingency allowed in capital cost estimate as 
necessary. 

2 3 . 8  R I S K S  –  E N V I R O N M E N T  A N D  P E R M I T T I N G  

It is possible that one or more permits necessary for the project execution are not 
obtained in a timely manner, thus delaying the project. 

Mitigation — extensive consultations over a number of years have been held with 
permitting authorities, resulting in a high degree of certainty that all required permits 
and licences have been identified along with the steps required to obtain them, and 
that outstanding permits will be granted on making correct applications.  No unduly 
onerous or challenging permitting requirements have been identified.

2 3 . 9  R I S K S  –  E C O N O M I C  

Economic uncertainty exists in the following areas: 

• changing exchange rates 

Mitigation — monitor negative exchange rate trends and implement 
strategies (such as hedging) as appropriate. 

• changing metal prices 

Mitigation — monitor negative changing metal price trends and implement 
strategies (such as hedging) as appropriate. 

• changing smelter terms 

Mitigation — monitor smelter term trends generally, and implement 
strategies such as using alternate smelters and entering long-term contracts. 

• capital overruns 

Mitigation — financial resilience of the project makes moderate capital 
overruns non-fatal.

MINE VICIN ITY 
Inferred mineral resources of 0.8 million tonnes in the Main deposit, 10 millon tonnes 
in the Sumac deposit, and 0.4 million tonnes in the Esso deposit might be converted 
to Indicated mineral resources by infill and exploration diamond drilling. 

Further mineral resources might be located in the mine vicinity by diamond drill 
exploration. 

REGION 
Further orebodies might be found in the common stratigraphy that exists in the area. 

UNDERGROUND MINING OF ESSO DEPOSIT 
The underground mining rate of the Esso deposit might be increased, thereby 
increasing the cash flow and improving the internal rate of return of the project.  This 
would be achieved by increasing the number of working areas and mining equipment 
underground. 

Narrow parts of the deposit, currently excluded from the reserve tonnage, might be 
mined.

The amount of waste rock development might be reduced by moving the ramp closer 
to the deposit.  Geotechnical assessment is required to determine the feasible 
minimum distance of ramp and shaft from the deposit. 

The proposed ground support has been conservatively configured due to limited 
geotechnical data.  Geotechnical data will expand once mine development 
commences, allowing optimization and a potential reduction in ground support 
requirements. 

Underground development accessing the Esso deposit can be designed to pass 
through a part of the Sumac deposit, with ore being generated instead of barren 
waste in the process. 

MINING OF SUMAC DEPOSIT 
The Sumac deposit, currently classified as an Inferred mineral resource, might be 
economically mined.  Further drilling is required to improve the geological knowledge 
of this deposit and to upgrade the classification to a Measured or Indicated mineral 
resource. 

The shallower part of the Sumac deposit might be mined by open pit methods, while 
the deeper part might be mined by underground methods. 

2 3 . 1 1  O P P O R T U N I T I E S  –  P R O C E S S I N G  

Recovery of mineral concentrates might be improved by optimizing the flotation 
process.  Metallurgical testing will indicate the required changes to the flotation 
process, and such changes can be implemented at little cost.   

Plant efficiency might be increased in the following areas: 

• improved quality of concentrates 

• optimized primary grind size and regrind size 

• gold and silver might be recovered from tailings before these are discharged 
from the process plant, through a process defined by further metallurgical 
testwork such as gravity separation. 

2 3 . 1 2  O P P O R T U N I T I E S  –  L O G I S T I C S  

The cost of transporting mine supplies, including diesel, might be reduced by using 
concentrate haul trucks to back-haul supplies.  This has been suggested as viable by 
Arrow Transportation Systems Inc. who has quoted the transport of concentrate from 
mine site to Stewart, BC, which is something they do for similar operations.

The building of a rail line passing through Dease Lake is a matter of ongoing 
discussion.  Should it occur, it would allow a reduction in the cost of transport of 
mineral concentrate and mine supplies.

Construction cost of the main plant building might be reduced by optimizing designs 
during detailed engineering to minimize excavation, structure, and concrete 
quantities. 

Optimizing the location of buildings on the plant site might reduce construction costs 
by minimizing excavation and concrete quantities. 

Construction costs might be reduced and certainty of meeting construction deadlines 
increased by pre-constructing mine buildings off-site, including the main mill building. 

2 3 . 1 4  O P P O R T U N I T I E S  –  E L E C T R I C  P O W E R  G E N E R A T I O N  

The long-discussed electrification of Highway 37 would allow the mine to be run on 
grid electrical power upon building a 120 km connecting power line, which would 
significantly reduce operating costs. 

Alternate means of generating electric power might be studied, including wind and 
hydroelectric power.

Wardrop has applied industry standard mining, mine construction, and economic 
evaluation practices to assess the Kutcho Project and is of the opinion that there is 
adequate geological and other pertinent data on the project to generate a valid 
prefeasibility study at ±25% accuracy. 

The mineral reserves are of sufficient quality and quantity to support the building of a 
mine having an eight-year life and providing an internal rate of return of 23% with a 
payback period of 2.6 years. 

Required initial capital is estimated to be $299 million, and sustaining capital over the 
life of mine to be $96 million, both figures including contingency amounts.  

The likelihood of improving the project economics by finding more ore in the Main 
deposit is low, but more ore might be found in the Esso deposit.  Further drilling of 
the Sumac deposit also has the potential of converting the 10 Mt of inferred mineral 
resource to a measured or indicated mineral resource, but this has a low probability 
of occurring due to the low grades that exist there. 

Sufficient work has been done on permitting and environmental aspects of the 
project to indicate that required permits to proceed with the project, to operate the 
mine, and to deal with mine closure at end of the mine life, have a reasonable 
likelihood of being forthcoming.

Wardrop recommends that this project proceed to feasibility study to confirm and 
refine the findings of this prefeasibility study, and to inspect means of improving the 
project's economics. 

Specific areas recommended for further study include:  

• detailed planning of open-pit mining and waste rock management of the 
Main deposit, including the option of mining part of the Main deposit by 
underground methods 

• detailed planning of underground mining of the Esso deposit, especially with 
respect to access development 

• variability testwork on Kutcho core samples to represent a range of head 
grades – this allows the development of head grade recovery relationships 
that will enable the projection of  the Kutcho metallurgy over the life of the 
mine for the cash flow model. 

• testwork to determine regrind and dewatering design parameters. 

• testwork on an Esso composite sample to ensure the Esso ore can be 
treated by the same process as the Main deposit. 

• reagent regime optimization - includes screening for more effective zinc 
depression reagents, and reducing reagent consumption. 

• optimize flowsheet, including differential flotation and bulk flotation. 

• Test for grindability, in particular SAG mill specific energy consumption by 
JK drop-weight test or SPI test.  Energy consumption determination of 
regrinding is recommended, especially energy requirements for ultra fine 
regrind by an Isamill for the copper rougher concentrate. 

• Free gold recovery by gravity separation. 

• trade-off studies to determine the optimum placement of the process plant 
and campsite complex, especially with respect to the potential of mining the 
Sumac deposit 

• detailed planning of the 120 km access road.
