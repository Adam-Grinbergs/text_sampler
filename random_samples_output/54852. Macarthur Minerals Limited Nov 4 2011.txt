1 Summary 

This Technical Report has been commission by Macarthur Minerals Limited ('Macarthur') for 

the purpose of updating the company's investors on their Macarthur Hematite Project, part 

of the Macarthur Iron Ore Project, located 150km north west of Kalgoorlie in Western 

Australia. The Mineral Resources were previously reported in 2010 (Allen, 2011).   

The Macarthur Iron Ore Project consists of two distinct mineral projects: 

1. Macarthur Hematite Project: encompasses hematite iron ore ("hematite"), to be 

marketed as potential Direct Shipping Ore ("DSO"); and 

2. Macarthur Magnetite Project: encompasses magnetite iron ore ("magnetite"), to 

be marketed as a beneficiated concentrate.  

This Technical Report focuses on the Macarthur Hematite Project. 

Mineral Resource estimates prepared for the Macarthur Hematite Project are presented in 

Table 1.

Note: The CSA Mineral Resources were estimated within constraining wireframe solids based on a 
lower cut-off grade of 50% Fe. The resources are quoted from blocks above the specified Fe% cut-off 
grade. Differences may occur due to rounding. 

The property is held 100% by Macarthur Iron Ore Pty Ltd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary 

of Macarthur. No mining operations have taken place to date.  

The outcropping geology of the project area is comprised of a combination of un-altered 

silica rich banded iron formations (BIFs) and altered, enriched haematite/goethite (H/G) 

BIFs. The H/G units are the source of Macarthur's H/G Mineral Resources to date and exist 

largely as a supergene product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of 

the silica from the BIFs, thus producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched

bands vary from 1m to 30m in true thickness and are largely steeply dipping at 70
o
-90

o
. The 

mineralisation extends along a strike extent of 6000m (Snark), 1,200m (Drabble Downs), 

3,200m (Banjo / Lost World), 3,200m (Central) and 2,200m (Moonshine). Mineralisation has 

been modelled to a depth of 55m below surface except where closed by drilling.  

Exploration by way of reverse circulation (RC) and diamond core drilling has occurred 

through 2011 and complements drill results from previous years to support the current 

Mineral Resource estimate. The database supporting the Mineral Resource estimate on 

which this study includes all information collected up until 31st August 2011. As of this date 

there were 819 drill holes (807 RC, 11 DDH) loaded in the database for 55,249.4m. Of this 

total, 29,990m from 819 holes were assayed, and verified for use in the Mineral Resource 

estimate. 

The Mineral Resource estimate is based upon a set of 3D wireframe solids, built upon drill 

assays returning >50% Fe. Dilution was allowed within the wireframes to an accepted 

tolerance. The wireframed envelopes represent the constraining geology and the dip and 

strike of each envelope attempt to mirror the data from field fact mapping as far as possible. 

Block models were constructed for Snark and Drabble Downs, Central, Banjo and Lost World, 

and Moonshine. Parent cell sizes were set for each individual Mineral Resource model, 

dependent upon the local drill spacing. The sample assayed grades were estimated into the 

block model using ordinary kriging. A density value of 2.9t/m
3
 was applied to Snark and 

Drabble Downs, whilst the densities for Central, Banjo / Lost World, and Moonshine were 

calculated by an algorithm according to the interpolated iron grade.  

The Mineral Resource is classified as Indicated and Inferred, as required by NI 43-101 and 

described in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The 

classification level is based upon an assessment of geological and mineralisation continuity, 

quality control results from drilling and assaying, and an analysis of available density 

information. 

CSA recommend the following actions to increase or maintain the confidence of future 

Mineral Resource estimates: 

 Construct a deposit scale geological model incorporating lithology, mineralisation, 

weathering and structural features that locally control the occurrence and location 

of mineralisation. 

 Interpret localised geology to model expected depth of mineralisation with a higher 

degree of confidence. The current deeper mineralisation is classified as Inferred, 

which can be upgraded if depth of mineralisation is better understood. 

 Review density data obtained from diamond core and geophysical logging, and 

determine appropriate algorithms to assign density values. 

 Maintain field geological procedures with respect to drill rig inspections and 

sampling procedures, vetting the maintenance and cleanliness of sample splitters 

and sample recovery.

 Monitor the performance of certified reference materials (CRM) and field duplicates 

immediately upon receipt of assays. 

 Complete additional drilling in Inferred Mineral Resource areas to decrease drill hole 

spacing and geological confidence of individual mineralised units.

4.5 Environmental Liabilities 

Environmental baseline studies are required to be completed prior to the commencement of 

mining related proposals in Western Australia. Based on the outcomes of these studies, the 

proposal must be assessed and approved under either the State Environmental Protection 

Act 1986, by the Environmental Protection Authority, or under the State Mining Act 1978, by 

the Department of Minerals and Petroleum. In the event that the proposed action has the 

potential to have a significant impact on Matters of National Environmental Significance 

(NES), the proposal must also be assessed and approved by the Commonwealth Department 



Macarthur Minerals Limited   
Hematite Mineral Resource    
 

 

 

Report No: R335.2011  11 

 
 

of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC) under the 

Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999.  

Macarthur have previously undertaken flora and fauna desktop studies for the project area 

which identified the potential for the presence of conservation significant species, including 

priority listed flora, fauna and ecological communities, as well as several Matters of NES. An 

extensive range of environmental baseline studies for the project are currently being 

undertaken including flora and vegetation, vertebrate fauna, short-range endemic (SRE) and 

subterranean fauna surveys, as well as groundwater, waste characterisation and landform 

design studies. 

These studies are scheduled to be completed by early 2012 and results will be assessed to 

determine the appropriate environmental approvals pathway and to develop the 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. The EIA report will include a summary of 

known environmental aspects, discussion of potential impacts, an outline of proposed 

environmental management measures to mitigate impacts to any identified conservation 

significant flora and fauna or other sensitive environmental receptors and detail proposed 

mine closure objectives.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local 
Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The topography of the Macarthur Hematite Project area is comprised of low ridges 

associated with the BIF units, striking in a general northwest - southeast direction, that rise 

up from the surrounding sandy plains. The range in elevation is approximately 120m with 

the highest point at approximately 520mRL. 

The vegetation of the project area is dominated by mulga scrub with local patches of low to 

medium eucalyptus woodland and areas of salt tolerant shrub and spinifex. 

5.2 Access to Property 

The project can be accessed 130km north from Kalgoorlie via the sealed Goldfields Highway 

and then 115km from Menzies via the graded Menzies-Evanston road (Figure 2). Menzies is a 

small town located in the West Australian Goldfields region and at the 2006 census had a 

population of 56 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007). 

5.3 Climate 

The climate at the Macarthur Hematite Project is characterised as a semi-arid climate. The 

Diemals weather station, located to the west of the project at Latitude 29.67
o
 S, Longitude 

119.30
o
E, was operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology between 1970 and 1994 

(Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2011). Diemals recorded a mean annual rainfall of 

275.7mm with rain fall mostly in the winter months. The temperature averages over 40°C for 

15 days in the summer months, from November to March, while in the winter months, from 

June to August, the temperature averages a minimum range from 3.9°C to 5.0°C. See Figure 

3 for more details. 

The climate at the project area allows an operating season covering the full length of the 

year. In the Kalgoorlie region, mining and exploration activities are conducted throughout 

the year, with infrequent generally short disruptions during and after periods of heavy rain.

5.4 Infrastructure 

At present a pre-feasibility study is being undertaken by Macarthur. A major part of this and 

subsequent studies will be to identify the availability sources of power, water, personnel, 

potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, and potential processing 

plant sites.  

The Macarthur Hematite Project is serviced from the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, with a 

population of 28,000 people (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007), which provides services 

to a large number of operating mines and exploration properties in the region. 

Some limited facilities are available in Menzies including fuel, accommodation and meals.  A 

railway line passes through Menzies, and road freight lines deliver to the town.

6 History 

6.1 Property Ownership 

Since the late 1960's several exploration companies have held the exploration rights to the 

project tenements. There have been 3 main phases of exploration; nickel exploration   from 

1968 to 1972, gold exploration from 1993 to 2004 and more recently iron ore exploration. 

The following summary has been derived from Revell (2006), Farmer (1997a, 1998a, 1998c) 

and Busbridge (1998a, 1998b). 

6.2 Project Results – Previous Owners 

6.2.1 Nickel 

Nickel exploration occurred from 1968 up to 1972, primarily for nickel sulphide 

mineralisation. During this period the project tenements were held by Amax Australia Inc, 

Consolidated Goldfields Australia Limited, Geotechnics Pty Ltd (Geotechnics) on behalf of 

Welcome Stranger Mining Company Limited, Kia Ora Gold Corp, Delta Minerals NL and Le 

Nickel Exploration Pty Ltd. 

During this period geological mapping, rock chip sampling, geophysical surveys including 

magnetic, electromagnetic and induced polarization were undertaken (Ward et al 1970). 

Geotechnics was the only company to drill in the area during this period. Table 4 summarises 

the drilling completed by Geotechnics, however the grid that Geotechnics used has not been 

re-established and the exact location of the drill holes is unknown.

6.2.2 Gold 

From 1993 to 1998 several companies explored the area for gold mineralisation. 

In May 1993 Battle Mountain Australia Incorporated (Battle Mountain) was granted the 

tenement E30/93 which partly overlies the tenement E30/0240, which is part of the Lake 

Giles area (Famer 1997a, 1998a, 1998c). Battle Mountain established a grid over E30/040 

from which the company collected 37 rock chip samples and completed a soil 50m x 500m 

sample program, which the company subsequently in filled to a 50 x 100 metre spacing for a

total of 1,175 samples. This soil sample program identified several gold anomalous zones 

with maximum grades of 3 to 12 ppb gold (Anon 1994). 

In August 1993, Aztec Mining Company Limited (Aztec) was granted the E30/100 lease which 

is immediately west of the project tenements and in December 1993 Aztec was granted 

tenement E30/99 (covered by tenements M30/213-218). Aztec collected 715 soil samples, 

31 stream sediment samples and 901msoli auger samples with identified several anonymous 

gold zones which peaked at 53ppb. Aztec drilled 80 RAB holes (Table 5) to test the 

anomalous gold zones, which returned weak mineralisation, with the best result being from 

drill hole DON06 for 25 meters at 0.4 g/t (Smith el at 1995, Busbridge 1998b). 

Battle Mountain drilled 41 RAB drill holes (Table 5) in 1994/5, targeting the anomalies 

identified in the soil sampling. These anomalies were named Soapbox and Enfield prospects 

in tenement E30/99. The best result from the RAB drill holes was from DOP8 for 4m @ 0.4 

g/t at the Soapbox prospect (Anon 1995). 

In 1995 Noble Resources NL (Noble) formed a joint venture with Battle Mountain to explore 

E30/93, however Noble interest was transferred to Barclay Holdings Limited, a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Titan Resources NL (Titan), in February 1997. 

Titan commissioned Telsa Airborne Geophysics in 1997 to complete an airborne geophysics 

survey of the tenements E30/93, E30/93 and E30/100. The airborne survey included 

magnetics and radiometric surveys and was flown at a height of 50 meters on 100 meter line 

spacing. In the same year Titan completed a 537 soil auger program over the tenement 

E30/93. (Famer 1997a, 1997b 1998a). 

In early 1998 Titan collected 311 meter soil sample on a 50 x 80 meter grid within tenement 

E30/99, but failed to define any anonymous gold zones (Busbridge 1998a). Mid 1998, Titan 

commissioned G&D Drilling to undertake a vacuum drilling program on tenement E30/100. 

The drill hole went down to a maximum depth of 1.5 meters and a total of 1,275 samples 

were collected on a drill spacing of 100m x 400m. In December 1998 Titan withdrew from 

the joint venture and Noble surrendered the tenement (Busbridge 1998a). 

From Late 1998 to 2003 Mr Troy Dalla-Costa was granted a number of tenements which 

were to become the Macarthur Iron Ore Project area.

6.2.3 Iron Ore 

Geotechnics conducted some rock chip sampling of the BIF units prior to 1972 for iron ore 

mineralisation. Results included 36.1 % Fe and 63.5 % Fe, however these were not followed

up and no exploration targeted iron ore mineralisation until Internickel Australia Pty Ltd 

(Internickel) started exploring the tenements. 

Internickel purchased the project tenements from Mr Troy Dalla-Costa in 2003 and then 

Internickel was purchased by Adex Holdings Limited (Adex) in 2004. Adex changed its name 

to Internickel in 2004 and Macarthur purchased the project tenements in 2005. 

Macarthur has explored the project tenements for iron ore since 2005 and has completed 

geological mapping surveys, geophysical surveys, auger sampling of the pisolite targets and 

RC and diamond drilling of the magnetite ore targets (Revell 2006, Fox 2001, Fox 2002 and 

Fox 2003). To data Macarthur has drilled 1,430 reverse circulation and 40 diamond drill holes 

for 121,913m and 2,576.95m respectively as part of the Macarthur Iron Ore Project. 

6.3 Historical Mineral Production 

There has been no mining in the Macarthur Iron Ore Project area to date.

7 Geological Setting and 
Mineralisation 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Macarthur Iron Ore project covers most of the Yerilgee Greenstone Belt which is up to 

60 kilometres in length within the Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn Craton. The Yilgarn 

Craton consists of the lenticular greenstone belts surrounded by partly foliated gneissic 

granitoids. 

The greenstone belts consist of metamorphosed ultramafic, mafic and sediments, including 

BIF which are Archaean in age and are commonly intruded by mafic, intermediate and 

granitic rocks. 

The greenstone belts are generally metamorphosed to mid greenschist facies towards the 

central parts of the belt and lower amphibolite facies on the edges of the belt where they 

are in contact with the granitoids. 

The greenstone belts are highly deformed, faulted and folded. Four deformation events are 

recognised regionally throughout the Yilgarn Craton: 

 D1 - movement along the south-north direction 

 D2 and D3 - shortening and shear movements in the ENE-WSW compression 

direction 

 D4 - Lateral extension of the greenstone belt in a NNW-SSE direction 

Figure 4 shows the regional geology of the Macarthur area and its surrounding, derived from 

GSWA (2011).

Figure 4.  Project area with regional interpreted geology (GSWA) and infrastructure 

7.2 Local Geology 

The parts of the north-northwest trending Yerilgee greenstone belt covered by the project 

tenements are underlain by a layered succession of Archaean rocks. At the interpreted base 

of the succession is a sequence of high-magnesium basalt flows more than one kilometre 

thick overlain by komatiitic ultramafic volcanic rocks with narrow interflow BIFs and in some 

cases other sedimentary rocks. Further high-magnesium basalt lavas with occasional 

interflow BIFs overlain, possibly unconformably by sedimentary rocks (cherty, silicified, 

pyritic and graphitic) are thought to form the top of this sequence. In places gabbroic sills 

have been intruded into the lower mafic and ultramafic lavas. These are believed to be co-

Hematite Mineral Resource    
 

 

 

Report No: R335.2011  19 

 
 

magmatic with the upper high-magnesium basalts. The elongated lens shaped Yerilgee belt 

is bounded by major north-northwest trending fault/shear zones. 

The Archaean sequence has been intensely folded. At least five possibly sinistral fault zones 

of similar but slightly more north-westerly trend are interpreted within the widest part of 

the belt. These are believed to successively repeat the layered succession. Also two 

northerly trending sinistral faults obliquely crosscut the belt in this area. 

A number of large synclinal fold structures have been identified. These appear to be located 

adjacent to the eastern margins of the fault blocks. These folds have north-westerly and 

north-north-westerly trending axes and where mapped in detail (Greenfield, 2001) show a 

plunge at 30° to 60° in the same direction. In general the fold axes are steeply dipping. The 

folding appears to have been contemporaneous with faulting. In plan, the movement on the 

fault planes was sinistral but in a true sense is believed also to have been reverse faulting 

with the direction of movement on the western down-throw sides of the fault planes being 

inclined at 30° to 60° towards the east northeast. The synclines and anticlines are considered 

to be drag fold structures. 

The most recent notable tectonic event was approximately 2.6 billion years ago and appears 

to have dilated the north-northwest trending shear zones, generated north-northeast 

trending and conjugate northeast to easterly trending structures. These brittle factures have 

in many places been intruded by granitic dykes or quartz veins. The project tenements cover 

about 60 kilometres of the greenstone belts strike length but because of fault repeats are 

estimated to cover more than 100 kilometres of komatiite sequence strike length. 

7.3 Property Geology 

Figure 5 presents details of the outcropping geology of the Macarthur Hematite Project. The 

outcropping geology of the hematite areas are comprised of a combination of un-altered 

silica rich BIFs and altered, enriched haematite/goethite (H/G) BIFs. The H/G units are the 

source of the company's H/G resources to date and exist largely as a supergene product. 

Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of the silica from the BIFs, thus 

producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched bands vary from 1m to 30m in 

true thickness and are largely steeply dipping by 70
o
 to 90

o
. 

The project area is comprised of multiple parallel bands of BIF, many of which are enriched, 

with varying (1m to 30m) thicknesses. The strike of these bands is largely NW-SE. A number 

of folds with a NW plunge have been identified with further work into the structure of the 

deposit on-going. The strike extent of the main ridge line at Snark is 5.9km and the package 

consisting of the multiple BIF bands along with the inter-bedded ultramafics has a thickness 

of approximately 500m. The drill tested area at Drabble Downs consists of three main BIF 

ridges with a combined strike length of approximately 3.4km. 

At Central drill tested BIF ridges cover a combined strike extent of approximately 10.5km. As 

at Snark the package consists of two main BIF ridges, each consisting of multiple parallel 

bands of BIF ranging from 1m to 30m thickness. The total package thickness including inter-

bedded mafics and ultramafics is over 1km. 



Macarthur Minerals Limited   
Hematite Mineral Resource    
 

 

 

Report No: R335.2011  20 

 
 

The same geological package is repeated at both Banjo / Lost World and at Moonshine. At 

Banjo / Lost World the total strike length is approximately 4.0km and at Moonshine the total 

strike length is 0.8km. 

The mapped outcrops range from locally dark, rich and dense mineralized BIF (as shown in 

Figure 6 and Figure 7); to porous and lateritic weathered BIF with locally enriched layers (as 

shown in Figure 8 to Figure 9).  In RC chips the mineralized material is dusty and brown. 

The appearance in many parts is unprepossessing, and the drill sample assays confirm that 

the grade is averaging around 55% with local grades as 59% Fe. Hand specimens collected on 

surface tend to average higher, over 60% probably as a result of visual grade biasing, and are 

not used for resource estimation.

7.4 Weathering Profile 

The rocks of the Macarthur project have been logged into six different weathering 

classifications: 

 Complete – All clay with no remnant rock texture 

 Extreme – Largely clay with some remnant rock texture 

 Strong – Rock texture moderately preserved, significant presence of fines, often 

weak 

 Moderate – Rock texture fully preserved, all minerals show weathering 

 Partial – Oxidation limited to the most unstable minerals only (e.g. sulphides) 

 Fresh – No oxidation of any minerals 

The majority of the H/G ore grade (>50%Fe) material is located within the Strong and 

Moderate classifications. The boundary between partial oxidation and fresh rock has been 

determined to be variable within this area with down hole (-60
o
 dip) depths ranging from 

30m to 100 m.

7.5 Water Table 

The water table throughout the project area varies greatly in both level and salinity. The 

Snark area has been subject to a recent hydrological study and the water table has been 

interpreted to between 50m to 65m below the surface, at an RL of 410m to 425m. This is 

largely considered to be below the base of H/G mineralisation. With regards to salinity the 

ground water in the area has a TDS  value that typically ranges between 1,600 and 13,000 

mg/L, which indicates a moderately brackish to saline classification (typical seawater is 

>35,000 mg/L).

8 Deposit Types 

8.1 Mineralisation Styles 

The mineralisation currently known at the Macarthur Iron Ore Project comes in two forms: 

 Magnetite – present in the fresh BIFs along with high quantities of silica. This is the 

primary unaltered form of BIFs at site and in general has not been subject to any 

later iron enrichment. 

 Haematite/Goethite (H/G) – present in the weathered BIFs with lower quantities of 

silica. Product of supergene enrichment of the BIFs, which results in the leaching of 

the silica from the primary fresh BIFs. This results in elevated iron content in 

comparison. 

The focus of this document is the H/G style of mineralisation. 

8.2 Conceptual Models 

The H/G units are the source of the company's H/G resources to date and exist largely as a 

supergene product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of the silica from 

the BIFs, thus producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched bands vary from 

1m to 30m in true thickness and are largely steeply dipping between 70
o
 and 90

o
 with 

variable dip directions dependent on the location within the deposit. The main units in 

Drabble Downs are generally shallower dipping (50
o
 to 80

o
) to the south-west and appear to 

form the centre of the overall regional Snark fold sequence.

9 Exploration 

Over the past two years Macarthur geologists have conducted ground traverses and 

geologically mapped the Macarthur prospects. The outcropping rock was classified as either 

BIF or H/G enriched BIF. The extent of outcrops was surveyed by handheld Garmin GPS 

devices, with an accuracy of ± 3 metres on the GDA94  grid system. These boundaries were 

subsequently digitised in the MapInfo GIS software package. The location of outcrops and 

mapped structural information was used in planning the location and orientation of drill 

holes for Mineral Resource modelling. 

Outcrop maps with drill collars for the H/G project areas are presented in Figure 10 to Figure

Macarthur contracted Orbit Drilling Pty Ltd ('Orbit Drilling') to carry out both the RC and 

diamond drilling. Orbit Drilling are an exploration drilling company based in Perth, Western 

Australia. Two RC drill rigs were utilised in 2010 and 2011, a Schramm T660 (Volvo 8x4 wheel 

rig) and a track mounted Schramm T450WS. 

Macarthur has a number of procedures in place, which have been designed to reduce the 

risk of errors from drilling, sampling and assaying processes. These processes along with the 

associated risk reduction procedures are summarised below. 

Every hole drilled was planned and supervised by Macarthur geological staff. Holes were 

planned to intercept the resource body in the most representative way possible considering 

terrain, outcropping geology and results from previous drilling. During drilling, a company 

geologist would supervise the work and log the geology to each metre interval and end the 

hole at a certain depth based on the outcome of the drilling and the estimates provided by 

the planning. 

Planned drill hole collar positions were marked by GPS, and if clearing was required to 

provide a suitable drill site, then planned collar positions were re-marked after clearing. To 

assist with drill rig alignment, two sighter pegs were placed at appropriate distances from 

the collar position using a sighter compass. After drilling  all drill holes included in the 

Mineral Resource estimates were surveyed by high accuracy Real Time Kinematic GPS 

(RTKGPS). RTKGPS surveys, which were undertaken by surveyors from Minecomp Pty Ltd are 

accurate to within 50 millimetres in three dimensions.  

After the drill rig set up on each hole, Macarthur staff checked hole inclinations with a 

clinometer. Holes drilled in 2009 and 2010 field seasons were down-hole surveyed with a 

single shot down-hole camera lowered down the rod string. Holes drilled in 2011 (Snark and 

Drabble Downs) were surveyed with a GYRO tool.  

Drill collar plans are presented in Figure 10 to Figure 12, and shows the locations of drill hole 

collars superimposed on outcrop mapping. This demonstrates the number of ridges yet to be 

drill tested (as at the 31st August, date of database cut-off). It is important to note that some 

ridges have been assessed to be made up of non-mineralised BIF and are not intended to be 

drilled.  

Figure 13 to Figure 15 present typical cross sections through the mineralisation, 

demonstrating the relationship between sample lengths and the true thickness of 

mineralisation, as well as the geological orientation of the mineralisation.  

Drill hole intercepts for Snark, Drabble Downs, Banjo, Lost World, Central and Moonshine 

are presented in Appendix 5. 

The Qualified Person is not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could 

materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Drilling practices are focused on maximizing sample recovery and minimizing sample 

contamination. At the end of each six metre drill rod, the drilling pauses and compressed air 

is blown through the rods to flush cuttings from the drill hole, the sample hoses and the 

cyclone to minimize sample contamination, and to ensure that there are no blockages in the 

sample stream. The cyclone is regularly inspected and cleaned as necessary. Samples are 

collected over one metre down-hole intervals and a sub-sample collected in a calico bag by 

splitting through an industry standard three tier riffle splitter. A total of 75% of the sample 

passes through the splitter to be captured in a residue bucket (Figure 20), whilst the 

remaining 25% of the sample is evenly distributed through the primary sample chute and the 

field duplicate chute. The calico bag sub-samples are labelled with the drill hole number and

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and 
Security 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Security 

On completion of each hole the field assistants collect the samples and secure them in 

polyweave bags using a cable tie labelled with a unique ID, which the lab would check upon 

receipt as a way of being aware of tampering. The polyweave bags are securely stored in the 

Macarthur Iron Ore Project exploration camp compound, where Macarthur personnel are 

located on a continual basis. 

The samples are transported to the assay laboratory depot in Kalgoorlie in a large bulka bag 

to avoid loss of samples, prior to being dispatched to the assay laboratory in Perth using the 

Coastal Mid-West freight company. 

Drill samples were sent to Amdel - Ultratrace Assay Laboratories (Amdel), Perth. A flow chart 

demonstrating sample preparation for all Macarthur samples is presented in Figure 17. The 

pulverised residues were analysed by XRF. Amdel maintained sound security for all samples, 

from receipt of sample to storage of crush and pulp residue (limited storage time). Assay 

results were emailed to Macarthur and CSA Database Management. 

Amdel Laboratories, wholly owned by Bureau Veritas, are independent of Macarthur, and 

are ISO and Nata Accredited. They are a member of ISO MN-002-02 Chemical Analysis 

Committee AQIS registered.

11.2  Drill Hole Database 

All data is loaded and processed by CSA Global through Datashed, which is a database 

management system developed by Maxwell Geoservices.  The data is loaded via Datashed 

into Maxwells' latest data model housed on an SQL server in the CSA Global Perth office.  

The data model has various criteria, relationships and triggers to ensure the data entered

Report No: R335.2011  38 

 
 

into the database is valid.  The database has been active since May 2011 and strict security 

and daily backups are managed by SQL server software. 

Prior to May 2011, drill hole data was stored in a Microsoft Access database, maintained in 

Macarthur's Perth office. Data tables were exported as comma separated text files (csv 

format) and imported into Datamine. The Mineral Resource estimates for Central, Banjo, 

Lost World and Moonshine are based upon data contained within this MS Access database. 

As of May 2011 all drill data was imported into the Datashed database. 

11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control – 2011 Drilling 

11.3.1 Certified Reference Materials 

Certified reference materials (CRMs) are packets of rock sample that have been ground to a 

size consistent with the grind size used in commercial assay laboratories, typically 105um. A 

variety of CRM types exist, and Macarthur chose the CRM type that most resembled the rock 

type that exists at the Macarthur Hematite Project. They are certified because the 

manufacturer of the CRM has independently tested the accuracy of the expected mean 

grade of the sample through a series of round robin laboratory umpire testing, and therefore 

"certify" the assay grade. 

Macarthur used CRMs sourced from Geostats Pty Ltd, a supplier of reference material based 

in Perth, Western Australia. Two CRMs were submitted with drill samples through the 2011 

drill campaigns, and are detailed in Table 8. CRMs were inserted at the rate of one CRM 

every 50m of sampling, with at least one per hole. The results of the CRM assays are 

presented in a time sequenced scatter plot, and show the actual assayed grade against the 

expected grade of the sample (Table 8) within acceptable tolerances. Macarthur has 

nominated a tolerance limit of ± 2 standard deviations; if the assayed CRM falls within these 

limits then the results of assays from samples submitted for XRF testing with that CRM are 

deemed to have passed. If the assayed value for the CRM falls outside the tolerance limits, 

then the assayed CRM is deemed to have failed, which therefore casts doubt on the 

accuracy of the assays for samples that were submitted with the CRM. In this case 

Macarthur have the option of re-assaying a batch of samples, to ensure that the suite of 

assays received from the laboratory are as accurate as possible, when compared to available 

checks and balances. The graphs also allow the monitoring of any drift in assay trends over 

time and thus provide information on analytical accuracy. 

The CRM plots for Fe (%) for both CRM types submitted to Amdel are presented in Figure 18 

and Figure 19. CRM plots for the other elements are presented in Appendix 4.

11.3.2 Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates are duplicate samples taken at the drill rig, in parallel to the primary sample 

that is submitted for assay analysis. The purpose of a field duplicate is to test firstly the 

quality of the sample splitter on the drill rig; and secondly the quality of sample preparation 

at the assay laboratory. Figure 20 demonstrates the collection of a duplicate field sample, 

whereby the sample collected from the drill hole passes evenly through a three tiered riffle 

splitter, with equal portions of sample passing through to the primary sample and field 

duplicate sample. The field duplicate sample is submitted to the assay laboratory at the 

same time as the primary sample. Macarthur captures a field duplicate sample at the 8m 

depth of every hole, then every 25m beyond that depth, for each hole. When a field 

duplicate sample is not captured by calico bag, the sample stream from the duplicate chute 

is allowed to fall to the ground where it is discarded. The field duplicate calico bag is stored 

on the reject sample pile alongside the primary sample, as demonstrated in Figure 21. 

Field duplicate results are presented in quantile – quantile (QQ) plots, as shown in Figure 22. 

The QQ plot demonstrates that the sampling populations are very similar and that there are 

no overall significant issues with the sampling procedures in the field. The use of duplicate 

field samples provides information on the overall precision (repeatability) of the analytical 

results.

11.3.3 Lab Pulp Duplicates 

The assay laboratory independently tests its' own analytical quality using internal laboratory 

control procedures, one method of which is to submit a 'split' of the 105µm sample for XRF 

analyses, sometime after the original sample has been analyses. This is to test the accuracy 

of the XRF analyser. Assay results for iron ore samples are anticipated to be very similar due 

to the low nugget effect of the mineralisation. 

A scatter plot of primary pulp samples versus laboratory pulp samples for Fe% from Amdel is 

presented in Figure 23. This demonstrates a high level of accuracy.

11.4  Quality Assurance and Quality Control – 2009 to 2010 Drilling 

The following QAQC analyses were conducted for Banjo, Lost World, Central and Moonshine. 

They also cover the Mineral Resource estimate published for Snark in 2010 (Macarthur 

Minerals Limited, 2010). 

The QAQC data provided up to December 2010 included a separate database table of 176 

field duplicate assays taken from the mineralized intercepts, and 623 laboratory repeat 

assays. The 176 field duplicates taken from hole LGRC_223 to LGRC_470 were resolved to 

169 paired assays.  All were of mineralized hematite-goethite intercepts, analysed for whole 

rock Fe suite XRF analysis.

Report No: R335.2011  43 

 
 

Five 'duplicates' were excluded as the 1m samples correlated to a interval that was stored as 

a five metre sample in the assay table, so were not used (LGRC_270 102-107); it is possible 

these were somehow erroneously entered in the duplicates table and should be moved to 

the assay table.  

The graphs of field duplicates versus original XRF assays as presented in Figure 24 show very 

good correlation. Only three samples appeared to be incorrectly paired, possibly due to 

mislabelled duplicate samples. These were LGRC_241 49-50, LGRC_249 12-13 and LGRC_253 

37-38.

procedures support the Mineral Resource classification discussed, and are of industry 

standard.

12 Data Verification 

The Qualified Person (QP) has visited the Macarthur Hematite Project site three times during 

2011, and has inspected many drill sites, both historical and active. Collar coordinates were 

measured using a hand held GPS and compared to the surveyed coordinates, and in all cases 

the surveyed collar coordinates were confirmed. The QP has also relied upon data validation 

carried out by site geologists who independently recorded the coordinates of holes and 

compared these against actual coordinates. The QP is satisfied that the drill hole location 

data used to compile the Mineral Resource estimate is of acceptable quality. 

Sample assays were compared against lithological logs and were consistent with the 

geological intervals. For example, Fe grades of >50% were associated with H/G 

mineralisation and sometimes BIF; but never with ultramafics. 

The drill hole database was validated initially by the database operator, and queries were 

sent to site for clarification. The author is satisfied that as many checks and balances as 

possible have occurred, and any errors or omissions that do exist will only possibly affect the 

Mineral Resource estimate in a marginal manner. 

Finally, the drill holes were loaded into Datamine (Section 14) and drill hole traces were 

visually checked to ensure they did not exhibit kinking (resultant from erroneous down hole 

surveys), were dipping downwards, and the collars were in the expected locations and not 

offset from the targeted mineralisation without good reason.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

14.1 Software 

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Macarthur Hematite Project was completed using 

Datamine Studio v3.19.4135. Geostatistical analyses were conducted using the 'Supervisor' 

(Snowden Industries) and 'GeoAccess Professional' (Widenbar and Associates) packages. 

14.2 Mineral Resource Estimate – Snark and Drabble Downs 

14.2.1 Drill Hole Database Loading 

Eight tables were exported from the drill hole database in csv format. These tables included 

collars, assays, surveys, lithology and density. 

These tables were loaded into Datamine to generate a de-surveyed drill hole file named 

assay.d. , using Datamine's 'HOLES3D' command. 

14.2.2 Geological Interpretation 

14.2.2.1 Lithology 

No lithological domains were modelled for this Mineral Resource estimate.  

14.2.2.2 Weathering 

No weathering profiles were modelled as part of this Mineral Resource estimate. 

14.2.2.3 Mineralisation 

Mineralised domains were interpreted to follow the strike of surface mapping, as discussed 

in Section 7. Mineralisation sometimes demonstrated continuity by drill results, where 

surface mapping indicated no outcrop. 

Mineralisation envelopes were modelled based upon a lower Fe grade cut-off of 50%. This 

was the mineralisation cut-off grade used in previous Mineral Resource estimates for the 

Macarthur Hematite Project. The Fe (%) assay grades were displayed against the drill hole 

trace with the primary lithological code, to ensure that only lithologies associated with iron 

mineralisation (BIF or hematite/goethite) were captured inside the envelopes. This 

eventuated to be always the case.  

A general rule followed was to allow up to 2 consecutive metres of less than 50% Fe from 

any drill hole inside a mineralisation envelope. This rule was relaxed to allow for 

mineralisation marginally below the cut-off grade, especially if needed to maintain strike or 

depth continuity. An interpretation for any domain required strike continuity along at least 

two drill sections. Where a polygon was digitised around a drill hole exhibiting Fe 

mineralisation and no strike continuity was observed, either by closure by drilling, or open

Hematite Mineral Resource    
 

 

 

Report No: R335.2011  48 

 
 

due to no drilling, then that hole and associated domain were not included in the final 

Mineral Resource estimate. 

Dip and dip direction of the mineralisation envelopes were determined by surface structural 

readings near the drill hole collars. 

14.2.2.4 Topography 

A LIDAR topographic survey was flown in June 2011. The data was re-sampled from 1m to 

2m and exported as a wireframe surface in dxf format. The dxf file was imported into 

Datamine and saved as a wireframe surface. The surface was validated against several drill 

collars, representing different geographical locations of the resource, to ensure matching 

elevation levels between drill hole survey and topographic survey. The topographic DTM 

covers an area significantly larger than the mineralisation footprint. 

14.2.3 Wireframes 

A total of sixty three (63) wireframe solids were constructed for mineralisation across the 

Snark and Drabble Downs prospect areas. The construction of the solids was controlled by 

the use of tie lines. End plates were projected approximately 20 metres along strike, or to 

the limits of surface expression of the mineralisation as determined by outcrop mapping. 

The wireframes were named and numbered min1_tr/pt to min58_tr/pt for Snark, and 

min101_tr/pt to min105_tr/pt for Drabble Downs. The *tr/pt notation is the Datamine 

wireframe filename notation for the storage of related wireframe triangle and point files. 

Depth of mineralisation was set to no more than 55 metres below surface by translating the 

topographic wireframe 55m vertically. Any mineralisation domain extending below this sub 

surface wireframe was set as barren, via the block model macro (refer section 14.2.8). 

14.2.4 Sample Domaining 

14.2.4.1 Domain Coding 

Samples within the Datamine drill hole file were flagged according to the mineralisation 

wireframe solid within which they were located. Table 9 presents the wireframe names, 

Datamine variable (MINZON) and associated codes.

14.2.4.2 Sample Length Analyses 

An analysis of all RC sample lengths, from samples contained within mineralisation domains 

discussed in Section 14.2.4.1, indicates that all lengths are 1.0m. Diamond core lengths were 

not assessed because they were not assayed, and therefore not used for grade estimation.

14.2.5 Sample Compositing 

Drill hole samples were composited to 1.0m lengths, based upon the sampling interval 

described in Section 14.2.4.2. 

14.2.6 Statistical Analyses 

14.2.6.1 Summary Statistics – Sample Assays 

A statistical summary of key assay results for all mineralisation domains combined is 

presented in Table 10. Histograms of grade variables are presented in Appendix 1. The 

statistics demonstrate typical grade distributions for this type of H/G deposit, with 

negatively skewed distribution for Fe and positively skewed distributions for the other 

variables. Approximately 20% of the Fe data has assay values of less than 50% Fe, which is 

related to internal dilution modelled within the wireframes. Approximately 90% of the Fe 

population is greater than 47.8%, indicating that modelling has allowed the capture of Fe 

grades slightly less than the expected cut-off of 50% Fe. This further implies that the dilution 

constitutes mineralised BIF rather than ultramafic rock which is located to both the 

hangingwall and footwall of the mineralised bands.  

Summary statistics for Snark and Drabble Downs, based upon domains presented in Table 9, 

are presented in  

 

 

Table 11 and Table 12.. These demonstrate general similarities between the two deposits, 

which are expected due to geological similarities and the close proximity to each other. The 

notable exception is the elevated sulphur grade observed in Drabble Downs, reasons for 

which are unknown at this stage. Drabble Downs also exhibits a slightly higher LOI than 

Snark. 

Summary statistics for grade variables, by MINZON domain, are presented in Appendix 1.

14.2.6.2 Mass Balance 

An analysis of mass data is required to ensure the assayed grade values (%) sum 100%, 

within a tolerance of ±1.5%. Figure 26 demonstrates that the assayed data is mostly within

tolerance for each MINZON domain. One notable domain is MINZON = 9, which is 

intercepted by RC hole LGRC_541, and which exhibits total mass balances of >101% but 

<102% in most instances. This hole was retained in the Mineral Resource estimate.

14.2.6.3 Density 

Density measurements were conducted on billets of diamond core, and via geophysical 

down hole density probing. 

A total of 19 diamond core samples were measured for in-situ density values by ALS 

Ammtec, Perth. The samples were collected from diamond core drilled in May 2011. A total 

of 19 samples from 11 holes were selected. One of the holes did not intercept the 

mineralisation, accounting for two of the samples. The remainder of the samples were 

derived from zones of mineralisation. 

The density data are displayed as a histogram in Figure 27. This demonstrates a mean 

density value of 3.05 from the hematite/goethite lenses.

Macarthur tested 93 holes with a geophysical probe, using the independent survey company

on 11 diamond core and 82 RC holes. A summary of the holes probed is presented in Table 1.

The down hole intervals were either 0.01m and 0.1m, dependent upon the operator at the 

time of the survey. The raw data was composited by CSA to 0.1m intervals prior to further 

assessment. The holes were flagged according to the mineralisation domain within which 

the samples were located (refer Section 14.2.4) and composited again to 1.0m intervals. The 

resultant drill hole data file, containing density, calliper and assay data was output to csv 

format and statistically analysed. 

Figure 28 presents scatter plots of density values against calliper measurements. This 

demonstrates the two main hole diameter populations (100mm diamond core, 140mm RC) 

with their attendant samples point diameters. There can be clearly seen a blowout of hole 

diameter beyond 160mm (10% additional volume to expected), with corresponding low 

density values. Therefore this data was trimmed, for all Caliper readings less than 160mm. 

Figure 29 presents a scatter plot of Fe v Density, for all mineralisation domains, with calliper 

readings of <160mm. A line of regression has been calculated for this population. It can be 

clearly seen that the majority of density values lie below 3.0, with a mean value of 

approximately 2.6 t/m

There is a marked contrast in mean density values, between diamond core samples and 

geophysical probe data. CSA are unwilling to apply a low density value averaging 2.6 t/m
3
 for 

the Mineral Resource. This is the same density as for quartz and is lower than the 

recommended density value applied to volcano-sedimentary lithologies of the Eastern 

Goldfields. Conversely, CSA believe the average value of 3.0 derived from billets of diamond 

core is slightly too high, based upon discussions with Macarthur geological staff regarding 

the competency of the mineralised lodes. CSA have decided therefore to take a conservative 

route and applied a density of 2.9 t/m
3
 for the Mineral Resource. CSA strongly recommend 

further analysis of the probe density data. 

14.2.6.4 Grade Cutting 

The populations of the grade variables were analysed, as discussed in Section 14.2.6.1, to 

determine if upper or lower cuts were required prior to grade estimation. Cutting of data 

would be required to limit the impact of locally estimating a very high grade or low grade 

outlier, which would materially impact the Mineral Resource estimate. The 1m composited 

drill hole file was applied with either a bottom cut, for Fe, or top cuts prior to further data 

analyses and grade estimation. These are presented in Table 14.

14.2.7.1 Definitions 

A variogram is a graph of the variability between pairs of samples against the distance 

between them in a specific direction. A model is calculated for a particular variogram, which 

provides parameters known as the nugget, sills and ranges. An example is provided in Figure 

30.

Figure 30.  Example of Variogram Models. Green lines are variogram models, blue bars are 
number of pairs. 

The nugget effect is the variability between the closest spaced samples available, which is 

usually two adjacent samples from the same drill hole. The nugget value is where the 

variogram model cuts the Y-axis, and is usually referred to as a percentage of the total sill. 

The type of variogram that produces such a variogram is termed a down hole variogram.  

The sill is the population variance within a domain, and is often normalised to 1.0. The range 

is the distance at which samples are no longer spatially correlated, and can be considered as 

the point where the variogram model approaches or cuts the sill. This is a subjective decision 

for which the resource estimator or geostatistician will call on their experience from other 

projects for the same commodity. More than one sill is often modelled; the first sill (and 

short range) defines a range of influence up to which the variance between samples may rise 

very rapidly with increasing distance. Beyond this short range the variability may increase 

less rapidly with distance until the sill is reached. 

14.2.7.2 Methodology 

Prior to generating variograms, the composited drill hole file was split into four populations 

(domains) reflecting variations in strike of the host lithological units. These domains are 

presented in Figure 31 and Table 15.

Easting limits described in Table 15

An attempt was made to model variograms for each of the variogram domains listed in Table 

15, but the low numbers of sample pairs for domains 1, 3 and 4 resulted in poorly structured 

variograms which could not adequately be modelled. Therefore variograms were only 

modelled for data located within variogram domain 2, which had over 2,700 samples. The 

variogram parameters from this domain would be used for the other domains, after 

adjustments made to the rotation of the variogram ellipse. 

Normal down hole variograms were obtained from the 1m down the hole composites. These 

variograms were used to calculate the sample population nugget effect and sample variance 

related to the shortest distance between samples, for iron, phosphorus and sulphur.  

The nugget effect is the theoretical variance in grade that would be obtained if a duplicate 

sample was taken at exactly the same point in space. The nugget effect is an important 

measure of the reliability/variability of the assay value of samples and is one of the 

parameters used to determine the weight assigned to individual samples when estimating 

block grades. A sample population with a low nugget means that more reliability can be 

placed on nearby individual samples to estimate the grade of a block, such as may be 

achieved with an "inverse distance weighted" estimate with a high power. Conversely, a 

grade estimation from a sample population with a high nugget means that the average grade

Report No: R335.2011  58 

 
 

from a large number of samples will be required to give the best estimate of the grade for 

each block. 

Spatial variograms were modeled for drill data within variogram domain 2, within the dip 

plane of the variogram domain mineralisation wireframes, as per Table 15. Variograms were 

modelled for Fe, P and S. Variogram results are presented in Table 16. Variogram models are 

presented in Figure 32 to Figure 34.

The final block model 'sn0911md' dimensions and parameters are listed in Table 17. The 

parent block sizes were based upon approximately half the typical drill spacing. Sub blocks 

were used to ensure the block model honoured the mineralisation zone geometries and the 

geological contacts. Variable names are consistent with the drill hole sample variables.

14.2.9 Grade Estimation 

14.2.9.1 Data Used 

All composited RC drill holes that intercepted mineralisation domains as detailed in Section 

14.2.4 were available for grade interpolation. Only the portions of the holes intercepting the 

domains were used. Diamond holes were not assayed and therefore not used for grade 

estimation. 

Grade variables estimated were Fe, P, SiO2, Al2O3, LOI and S. 

14.2.9.2 Methodology 

The grade variables listed in Section 14.2.9.1 were estimated into the mineralisation 

domains using ordinary kriging (OK). This is a distance weighted technique that uses a 

variogram model to apply weights to a sample grade. A more traditional grade estimation 

technique, inverse distance squared (IDS), was used to estimate Fe only, as a check estimate 

for the OK estimates. IDS applies weights to a sample, according to the inverse of the 

geometric distance of the sample from the block centroid. Therefore a sample close to a 

block will receive a higher weight (to the power 2) than a sample further away. IDS does not 

make any recognition of the statistics of the sample population, whereas OK does so via the 

use of the variogram model and translates geometric distances to geological distances based 

on the observed sample correlation. 

Each mineralisation domain (MINZON) was estimated only by those composited drill samples 

located within them. This is achieved by using the same MINZON values for samples and 

blocks. Coding of blocks and drill holes is discussed in Sections 14.2.4.1 and 14.2.8.

A primary search ellipse of 125m along strike by 75m down dip by 25m across strike was 

used. The minimum number of samples used within the search was 8, with the maximum 

being 30.  The primary search was tripled if the minimum number of samples were not 

encountered within the various searches. A maximum of six samples per drill hole per block 

estimate was set, with discretisation of 3 x 3 x 3 used. No octant based search was used. 

Kriging estimation runs for SiO2, Al2O3 and LOI used the variogram parameters modelled for 

Fe to help ensure consistent major element support. Estimation runs for phosphorus used 

the P variogram parameters, and sulphur used variograms modelled for S. 

Variogram ellipses were aligned for each mineralisation domain, using the parameters 

modeled in Section 14.2.7. 

14.2.10 Model Validation 

Model validation was carried out graphically and statistically to ensure that block model 

grades accurately represent the drill hole data. Drill hole cross sections were examined to 

ensure that model grades honour the local composite drill hole grades. Several statistical 

methods were employed to validate the block model, which included: 

 Model tonnes vs drill hole meters 

 Model grade vs drill hole grade 

 Comparison of ID2, Kriged model and composite populations 

14.2.10.1 Mean Domain Grades 

Table 18 displays the input sample mean grade for the global data (derived from the cut and 

composited data) against the corresponding block estimates (first search volume). The mean 

of the block estimates is within allowable tolerance for all grade variables.  

A complete set of histograms, comparing samples against block estimates, can be found in

14.2.10.3 Trend Plots 

Trend plots were generated for Fe and P, in easting, northing and elevation sections, from 

selected mineralisation domains. These trend plots compare the trends of data in each 

direction and reveal whether the estimated block grades follow the trend of sample grades 

in each direction. This demonstrates the appropriate sample data were selected for 

estimating the block model domains. Figure 37 and Figure 38 shows trend plots for Fe and P.

14.2.10.4 Cross Sectional Validation 

Computer screen cross sections were used to visually validate on screen drill intercepts. The 

block estimates for iron were checked for similarity to their nearest drill sample intervals. 

This task was simplified by colour coding blocks and drill assay data with the same colour 

legend, therefore requiring the visual validation to compare similar colours for blocks and 

drill data. 

14.3  Mineral Resource Estimate – Central, Banjo, Lost World, Moonshine 

14.3.1 Drill Hole Database Loading 

Tables were exported from the drill hole database in csv format. These tables included 

collars, assays, surveys, lithology and density. 

These tables were loaded into Datamine to generate a de-surveyed drill hole file named 

allass.d. , using Datamine's 'HOLES3D' command. 

14.3.2  Geological Interpretation 

14.3.2.1 Lithology 

No lithological domains were modelled for this Mineral Resource estimate.  

14.3.2.2 Weathering 

No weathering profiles were modelled as part of this Mineral Resource estimate. 

14.3.2.3 Mineralisation 

Mineralised domains were interpreted to follow the strike of surface mapping, as discussed 

in Section 7. Mineralisation sometimes demonstrated continuity by drill results, where 

surface mapping indicated no outcrop. 

Mineralisation envelopes were modelled based upon a lower Fe grade cut-off of 50%. The Fe 

(%) assay grades were displayed against the drill hole trace with the primary lithological 

code, to ensure that only lithologies associated with iron mineralisation (BIF or 

hematite/goethite) were captured inside the envelopes. This eventuated to be always the 

case.  

A general rule followed was to allow up to 2 consecutive metres of less than 50% Fe from 

any drill hole inside a mineralisation envelope. This rule was relaxed to allow for 

mineralisation marginally below the cut-off grade, especially if needed to maintain strike or 

depth continuity. An interpretation for any domain required strike continuity along at least 

two drill sections. Where a polygon was digitised around a drill hole exhibiting Fe 

mineralisation and no strike continuity was observed, either by closure by drilling, or open 

due to no drilling, then that hole and associated domain were not included in the final 

Mineral Resource estimate.

Dip and dip direction of the mineralisation envelopes were determined by surface structural 

readings near the drill hole collars. 

14.3.2.4 Topography 

Wireframe surfaces were created from the drill hole collars, in the absence of any measured 

survey data. The wireframe surfaces were expanded to cover the entire block model area for 

each of the resource models. 

14.3.3 Wireframes 

Wireframe solids were created from the 3D mineralisation interpreted polygons. The 

wireframe solids were all combined to form one wireframe solid, which each of the Mineral 

Resource estimates were based upon. 

Depth of mineralisation was set to no more than 55 metres below surface.  

14.3.4 Sample Domaining 

14.3.4.1 Domain Coding 

Samples within the Datamine drill hole file were flagged according to the mineralisation 

wireframe solid within which they were located. Flagging variables were the same as used in 

Snark and Drabble Downs, as discussed in Section 14.2.4 

14.3.5  Sample Compositing 

Drill hole samples were composited to 1.0m lengths, based upon the standard sampling 

interval. 

14.3.6  Summary Statistics 

The summary statistics show that the hematite-goethite mineralization is low grade, 

averaging around 55% Fe and 9% SiO2, Al2O3 is around 4.5% and P about 0.065 on average 

as shown in Table 19. The detailed statistics tables are shown in Error! Reference source not 

found., Table 20 and Table 21. The samples were also flagged with individual lens numbers, 

but statistics were too detailed for so few samples per lens.

Table 21. Summary statistics for Banjo-Lost World 1m drill hole samples 

 

 

Histograms for the hematite-goethite deposits are shown in Figure 39 and Figure 40. They 

show well-formed distributions without obvious subpopulations or long tails of extreme 

values. This is partly a function of the interpretation and sample flagging, and suggests that 

they are appropriate to the geological style of the deposits. 

The absence of long sample tails means that top cuts on contaminants or bottom cuts on Fe 

are not particularly required. Aside from considerations of strike direction, these 

distributions to not indicate a need to further sub-domain the deposits.

14.3.7 Spatial Statistics 

14.3.7.1 Initial DSO Spatial Statistical Review 

Variograms for the Banjo – Moonshine drill hole assay data were generated but had very 

poor structures except for the down hole variogram.  A large radius variogram model was 

created as a nominal variogram for estimation, as the experimental variograms were too 

poor to model. 

All variograms were traditional variograms, without transformations using 20° latitude (40° 

included) in the plane of search and no restriction perpendicular to the search. 

14.3.7.2 Domains for Variography 

Based on the univariate statistics for the lenses, a single domain was used along the strike of 

the lenses. Variograms were created for Fe as a starting point and used also to interpolate P 

SiO2, Al2O3, LOI, S.  

The major axis for Fe was set along strike with a range of 258m; semi-major down dip ranges 

of 195m and minor axis ranges across strike of 92m and 68m. Other major elements ranged 

from 250m (SiO2, East lode) to 697m (LOI, East Lode). Variogram parameters are presented 

in Table 22. Variograms for Banjo are presented in Figure 41 and Figure 42.

14.3.9 Model Fields and Zone Coding 

The fields created in the model were as follows: 

1. MINZON –mineralized lenses (10) and waste (99). 

2. LENS – used for validation only. 

3. CLASS – all set to 3 for Inferred. 

14.3.10  Grade Interpolation 

14.3.10.1 Grade Interpolation Method  

Grades at all areas were interpolated using Ordinary Kriging, with the same search envelope 

used for all assays but each assay with its own variogram model. 

Block grades were estimated for Fe, SiO2, Al2O3, LOI, and S.    

14.3.10.2 Grade Interpolation Parameters 

The search parameters were based on the Fe variogram. The same ellipse was used for all 

assays, with radii of 150m x 500m x 75m.   The alignment was altered for the different strike 

domains of each modelled area. 

A minimum number of 10 composites was used to interpolate each cell (except 12 in the 

earlier Moonshine model), with a maximum of 12 per drill hole. Maximum number of 

composites was 30 (Table 24). 

Variogram models are shown in tables in the Variography section above, in Table 22.

14.3.10.3 Absent Grades 

Gaps in drill hole assays were left as absent data for grade interpolation.  

14.3.10.4 Top and Bottom Cut Grades 

Top cuts were applied to S and Al2O3. The top cuts prevent extreme values having a 

disproportionate impact on the estimated block grades.

point where the normal distribution shape might reasonably be projected to the histogram X 

axis. Minimal cuts were preferred.

14.3.10.5 Validation of Interpolated Grades 

The in-situ head grades were interpolated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and validated by: 

 comparing composite grades and model grades in sliced steps in plan and cross-

section;  

 by generating stepped comparisons of composites to model grades in each 

direction;  

 by comparing mean of each zone for composite and assay data; and  

 by comparing grade distributions for each of the assayed elements. 

Examples of validation steps are presented in Figure 43 to Figure 45.

14.3.11 Density 

Macarthur has provided density data and recommendations for H/G mineralisation (Drabble 

2010a). 

Early density measurements were based on two data types:  

 Pycnometer measurements from RC drill chips. 

 Whole diamond core measured by the weight-in-water, weight-in-air method. 

The pycnometer (or specific gravity bottle) method of determining density can give the 

particle density of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied. The 

powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder 

sample. The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is 

completely insoluble. The weight of the displaced liquid is then determined, and hence the 

specific gravity of the powder. 

The whole-core method usually involves a square-cut piece of diamond core, but can be 

done on rough chunks. The sample is weighed in air and weighed again suspended in water, 

and the specific gravity directly calculated. If the sample is porous or absorbs water it can be 

coated in wax or spray lacquer or even plastic cling film. For square cut diamond core the 

length and diameter can be measured with calipers to calculate volume as a cross check. 

Macarthur did not provide descriptions of the density methods used, and the density 

readings provided all came from other deposits in the same area. Density samples were 

taken from Clark Hill and Snark but not taken at Moonshine. 

To improve the density data in 2010, Macarthur undertook the following: 

 A downhole geophysical logging program, of 2000m over 11 drillholes at Moonshine. 

 Density measurements on diamond core taken for metallurgical testing – 40 

measurements over 4 holes.  

 Surface sampling for density tests – 30 tests. 

In mid April 2010 a program of surface sampling was undertaken within the Banjo and 

Moonshine prospects.  The purpose of this program was to provide samples that could be 

analysed and their dry bulk density (DBD) determined, as well is the geochemistry. The 

reason for getting both the DBD and the chemistry was so that comparisons could be made 

with the hope of determining a reliable correlation between Fe% and density. 

The sampling programme involved the collection of 15 rock samples from Moonshine  

(DS_1-15) and 15 from Banjo (DS_16-30). The samples were collected in a way that was 

deemed to make the data suitably representative. Sampling locations were selected across 

the outcrops of the mineralised areas so that at least 1 sample was collected for each part of 

the resources.

The technique used was to select one in situ piece of outcrop which was representative of 

the specific location and break this off using a hammer, retaining it in one piece. Each 

sample was given a unique sample name (e.g. DS_1); this was recorded along with a 

description of the geology of each sample and the co-ordinates of its location. This 

information can be found in 'Table 2'. Each sample was bagged in separate, labelled calico 

bags and despatched immediately to the SGS metallurgical laboratory in Perth. 

Density measurements were taken from four diamond holes drilled into the Moonshine  

(LGDD_004) and Banjo (LGDD_001 to 003) deposits. Part of the test work on this involved a 

number of DBD determinations. They were tested from various points throughout the core, 

both in and out of the main ore zone.   Table 29 shows the details of where these 

measurements were taken. 

The surface sample locations, measured density and selected analyses are shown in

Table 26. The densities were plotted and various regression lines tested on the graph in 

Figure 46. Note that the average density is 3.50, and average Fe of these samples is 60.6% , 

somewhat higher than the average grade of the deposits.

Figure 46. Regression of density values against Fe for hematite-goethite enriched samples. 

In addition, Macarthur arranged for downhole geophysical logging to be carried out on 11 

drillholes at Moonshine. 

A total of 1916m  over the 11 drill holes were logged (Table 27), which included  1461 m 

logged as BIF, and 18m of hematite mineralized BIF.  Average density by logged rocktype is 

shown in Table 28.   

The density histogram in Figure 47 shows that though the overall BIF mean density is 3.1, if 

the separate population of densities below 2.5 is excluded (possibly using an Fe grade 

cutoff), the average will be approximately 3.3.  The Fe histogram on the right of the figure 

demonstrates that the drill holes logged covered some lower-grade to unmineralized BIF. 

The scatterplots with regression lines (Figure 48, Figure 49) show a positive relationship 

between Fe and BIF density.   

Finally, the drill core sample densities (Table 29) show an average density of 2.6, apparently 

averaging significantly lower than other measures of density.

14.3.11.1 Density relationship with other variables 

Scatterplots show a clear relationship of density to Fe content (Figure 52).  Apart from a 

number of outliers that appear so improbably that they should be excluded as possible bad 

data. Hellman and Schofield (2009) found differences in the results from different drilling 

phases so a plot was generated of FE vs density for the three groups of results for diamond 

core (Phase 5), RC Phases 1-3 and RC phases 4 and 6 (Figure 52).

14.3.11.2 Density Applied to Mineral Resource models 

The following formula based on the regression from surface samples Fe vs density calculates 

density values per block, based upon the interpolated block grade for iron (Figure 46): 

DENSITY = 0.0037*FE*FE-0.3476*FE+11.127 

 

This resulted in deposits averaging densities ranging from 3.22t/m

14.4 Mineral Resource Classification 

The Mineral Resource is classified as Indicated and Inferred, as required by NI 43-101 and 

described in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The 

classification level is based upon an assessment of geological understanding of the deposit, 

geological and mineralisation continuity, quality control results and an analysis of available 

density information.

14.4.1  Snark and Drabble Downs 

The upper portions of the mineralised rock units have been classified as Indicated, due to 

the higher drill density (number of holes penetrating the mineralisation in a given volume) 

penetrating the mineralisation near surface. Outcrop mapping also provides information as 

to occurrence and style of mineralisation at surface, which can be reasonably projected 

down dip. The largest unknown factor in this Mineral Resource estimate is an understanding 

of the depth at which the proto-rock type BIF is converted to hematite. Drilling information, 

in the way of lithological logs from RC chips, and sample assays, controlled the depth extent 

of the mineralisation shapes. However, when the deepest hole on a particular section 

penetrates mineralisation, the depth at which mineralisation terminates on that section is 

generally unknown, and subjective. The mineralisation envelopes were extended to a 

nominal depth of 55m below surface, however the risk that the deeper mineralisation 

indeed exists has resulted in the deep mineralisation being classified as Inferred. 

As drilling density reduces with depth, the higher confidence levels felt for the anticipated 

occurrence of mineralisation reduces, to a point where the resource classification level 

needs be changed to Inferred. The nominal depth at which this occurs has been set at 30m 

below topographic surface. This is a subjective depth, determined from the Qualified 

Persons' understanding of the mineralisation and geology of the deposit. 

Exceptions to the above rule are mineralisation domains (MINZON, refer to Section 14.2.4) 

which either are informed by too few holes (two or three) to provide sound confidence for 

the grade estimation, or sections of well drilled domains where drilling density has dropped, 

below a nominated depth.  

There is currently no Measured classification applied to this Mineral Resource estimate. CSA 

recommend Macarthur gain greater understanding of the style of mineralisation and 

geological controls, and incorporate these into future Mineral Resource estimates. CSA also 

recommend an improvement in the quality of drill sampling, by more stringent and thorough 

quality control checks and drill rig inspections by the project geologists. Further analysis of 

the density database is required, to provide an algorithm that will provide local density 

assignments according to the Fe grade of the mineralisation and the geological 

characteristics of the rock. Attention to these areas may allow certain areas of future 

Mineral Resource estimates to be elevated to Measured status. 

Assignment of resource classification (CLASS variable) to the block model was by the 

MINZON variable, and / or spatial coordinates. Table 30 presents the classification criteria 

for the Mineral Resource estimate. Block model variables related to classification are 

presented in Table 17.

14.4.2  Central, Banjo, Lost World and Moonshine 

The Mineral Resource estimates for Central, Banjo, Lost World and Moonshine have all been 

classified as Inferred. This is due to the wide spaced drilling, for which continuity of 

mineralisation is assumed but not verified. Many drill sections have only one drill hole, and 

depth of mineralisation has been assumed. There are not enough QAQC results to support a 

higher level of classification. Density measurements are based upon a few rock chip samples, 

measured for density. 

14.5  Mineral Resource Reporting  

The Mineral Resource estimate has been reported above a nominal cut-off grade of 50% Fe, 

for all blocks in the resource model. No depletion has taken place from earlier mining 

activity. The entire Mineral Resource estimate has reasonable prospects for eventual 

economic extraction, and is a realistic inventory of mineralisation which, under assumed and 

justifiable technical and economic conditions, might, in whole or in part, become 

economically extractable.  

The Mineral Resource is not believed to be materially affected by any known environmental, 

permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant 

factors. 

The Mineral Resource is reported in Table 31.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions 

A Mineral Resource estimate has been compiled for the Macarthur Hematite Project, based 

upon a total of 819 RC drill holes. Results from these drill holes, and from geological field 

mapping and observations, provided the basis for the geological interpretations. The Mineral 

Resource estimate was classified as Indicated and Inferred, required by NI 43-101 and 

described in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The 

classification level is based upon an assessment of geological and mineralisation continuity, 

quality control results from drilling and assaying, and an analysis of available density 

information. 

The Mineral Resource compiled as part of this report increases the hematite / goethite (H/G) 

Mineral Resource at the Macarthur Hematite Project, since the previous H/G Mineral 

Resource estimate was published (Allen, 2011). The current Mineral Resource for the 

Macarthur Hematite Project is presented in Table 33.

Note: The CSA Mineral Resource was estimated within constraining wireframe solids based on a lower

Differences may occur due to rounding 

The outcropping geology of the Macarthur Hematite Project area is comprised of a 

combination of un-altered silica rich BIFs and altered, enriched H/G BIFs. The H/G units are 

the source of Macarthur's H/G Mineral Resources to date and exist largely as a supergene 

product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of the silica from the BIFs, 

thus producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched bands vary from 1m to 

30m in true thickness and are largely steeply dipping at 70
o
-90

o
. The mineralisation extends 

along a strike extent of 6000m (Snark), 1,200m (Drabble Downs), 3,200m (Banjo / Lost 

World), 3,200m (Central) and 2,200m (Moonshine). Mineralisation has been modelled to a 

depth of 55m below surface except where closed by drilling. 

The classification levels applied to this Mineral Resource are compliant with NI43-101 (2011) 

and relate to levels of risk built into the model. An Inferred classification carries the highest 



Macarthur Minerals Limited   
Hematite Mineral Resource    
 

 

 

Report No: R335.2011  111 

 
 

level of risk, and with regard to the Snark and Drabble Downs model, the risk is associated 

with anticipated depth of mineralisation. The current geological interpretation pushes the 

hematite mineralisation model to a depth of 55m below the topography, unless 'cut off' by a 

deeper drill hole. This depth has been arbitrarily decided, based upon field observations by 

Macarthur geologists, and the experience of the Qualified Person with hematite deposits of 

similar style. The risk is that the volume, therefore tonnage of mineralisation modelled, may 

be over or under estimated in local areas. 

An Indicated classification level is the middle risk classification category (the lowest risk 

category is Measured); there is higher confidence implied in the geological interpretation, 

primarily based upon a greater density of drilling results. The Indicated Mineral Resources 

typically outcrop, although some of the smaller hematite lenses have been classified as 

Inferred due to lower density of drilling intercepting these. 

A density value of 2.9t/m
3
 has been applied to all blocks in the Snark and Drabble Downs 

Mineral Resource estimate. This value was determined following the study of density data 

from geophysical probing of selected holes, and density measurements derived from 

diamond core. As discussed in detail in Section 14.2.6.3, there is a marked contrast in mean 

density values, between diamond core samples and geophysical probe data. CSA are 

unwilling to apply a low density value averaging 2.6 t/m
3
, derived from geophysical probe 

data, for the Mineral Resource. This is the same density as for quartz and is lower than the 

recommended density value applied to volcano-sedimentary lithologies of the Eastern 

Goldfields. Conversely, CSA believe the average value of 3.0t/m
3
 derived from billets of 

diamond core is slightly too high, based upon discussions with Macarthur geological staff 

regarding the competency of the mineralised lodes. CSA have decided therefore to take a 

conservative route and applied a density of 2.9t/m
3
 for the Mineral Resource. CSA strongly 

recommend further analysis of the probe density data. There is currently a risk associated 

with the applied value of 2.9t/m
3
, because the tonnage of the Mineral Resource is directly 

related to the density, the other component being volume of the resource model. The 

Indicated classification level has allowed for some tolerance in this density value; 

nevertheless the risk must be considered when evaluating this Mineral Resource. 

A density value based upon a regression algorithm of estimated Fe% block grades was 

applied to the Central, Banjo / Lost World and Moonshine Mineral Resource estimates, as 

discussed in Section 14.3.11.

26 Recommendations 

CSA recommend the following actions to increase or maintain the confidence of future 

Mineral Resource estimates: 

 Construct a deposit scale geological model incorporating lithology, mineralisation, 

weathering and structural features that locally control the occurrence and location 

of mineralisation. This should be done by Macarthur field geologists in parallel with 

their geological interpretations of drill hole results. 

 Interpret local geology to model expected depth of mineralisation with a higher 

degree of confidence. The current deeper mineralisation is classified as Inferred, 

which can be upgraded if depth of mineralisation is better understood. This should 

be done by Macarthur field geologists in parallel with their geological interpretations 

of drill hole results. 

 Review density data obtained during 2011 from diamond core and geophysical 

logging, and determine appropriate algorithms to assign density values. This requires 

dedicated evaluation of currently available results, and preferably requires the 

geological interpretations and models to be completed. 

 Maintain field geological procedures with respect to drill rig inspections and 

sampling procedures, vetting the maintenance and cleanliness of sample splitters 

and sample recovery. This forms part of Macarthur's 'Standard Operating Procedure' 

and is not an additional requirement. 

 Monitor the performance of certified reference materials (CRM) and field duplicates 

immediately upon receipt of assays. This forms part of Macarthur's 'Standard 

Operating Procedure' and is not an additional requirement. 

 Complete additional drilling in Inferred Mineral Resource areas, to decrease drill 

hole spacing and increase geological confidence of individual mineralised units. This 

will require budgeting of money and resources, and will require a time frame of at 

least twelve months from initial drill hole planning and budgetary approval, to final 

receipt of sample assays. A proposed budget is as follows (excludes fixed costs):
