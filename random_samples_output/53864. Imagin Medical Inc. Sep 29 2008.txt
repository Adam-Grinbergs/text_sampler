1.0 SUMMARY 

Universal Uranium Ltd (Universal) contracted North Rim Exploration Ltd. (NREL) to 

prepare a Preliminary Assessment Study of Potash Resource Prospectivity in the Bay St Georges 

Subbasin of Western Newfoundland, Canada. The completed technical report may be used by 

Universal Uranium Ltd. toward completion of the requirements of the TSX Venture Exchange. 

Universal Uranium Ltd has acquired in seven exploration licences (comprising 816 

claims) covering part of the Bay St Georges Subbasin. The subbbasin is a Carboniferous 

"graben" structure containing an evaporite sequence within the Mississippian-age Codroy Group. 

The Bay St Georges Subbasin is an extension of the larger Carboniferous-age, Maritime Basin 

that underlies much of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The evaporite- 

bearing formations in Newfoundland are believed to be similar in age to potash-producing 

formations in the Moncton Subbasin of New Brunswick, which is also part of the Maritime 

Basin.  Previous exploration for "salt" and potash in the Bay St Georges subbasin was mostly 

conducted in the 1970's, however more recent petroleum exploration has discovered some thick 

evaporite formations with associated potash beds. 

Based on a review of publicly available information the authors conclude that, 

1. Sylvinite and carnallite mineralization has been reported and confirmed by personal 
observation from drill holes in the general St. Georges Subbasin of western 

Newfoundland and it is therefore it is reasonable to expect the discovery of additional 

sylvinite and carnallite mineralization, given the right geological (sedimentological and 

structural) conditions, within the St. Georges Subbasin;  

2. In the opinion of the authors, the highest prospectivity for potash mineralization in the 
subject area is coincident with the lower Codroy Group sediments (Figure 5 and Figure 

8).  Furthermore, it is the opinion of the authors that the potash mineralization may be 

associated with the thickest intersections of evaporite, which also coincide with 

geophysical gravity "lows". If the subject exploration licenses are shown to be the 

location of lower Codroy Formation evaporitic sequences it may be reasonable to expect 

that exploration of the ground where these sequences are present could result in the 

discovery of evaporite minerals that may include sylvinite and carnallite; and 

3. While there has been no drilling on the Universal property for potash, it is the opinion of 
the authors that further work is justified in testing for the presence of sylvinite and/or 

carnallite mineralization within the licenced ground, specifically within the regions 

marked by the highlighted area on Figure 9, as investigations to date suggest that these 

lands lie within the extent of the prospective lower Codroy Group rocks and may locally 

be coincident with a gravity lows.

Given the above conclusions, the authors recommend the following further steps in 

determining whether or not a potash mineral resource is present on the Universal Uranium Ltd. 

mineral exploration licenses: 

• Ground truthing and confirmation of the sedimentological and structural 
environment on the Universal Uranium mineral licences; 

• If appropriate stratigraphy is indicated, a detailed ground gravity survey to 
identify and delineate any gravity "low" features on the property could follow; 

and 

• If suitable gravity features are identified a program of drill testing of these 
features may be warranted to confirm the presence of sylvinite and/or carnallite 

mineralization. 

The St Georges Subbasin is a metallogenically interesting area with regional indications of 

several other mineral commodities, including coal, uranium and base metals. The potential for 

economic concentrations of these should not be discounted during the proposed work program.

DISCLAIMER 

In the preparation of this report, the authors have relied on historical reports, opinions and 

statements not prepared under their supervision; therefore the authors hereby do not take 

responsibility specifically for the accuracy of the historical data.  These items will be hereinafter 

identified in this report as being either "third party reports" or "historical information". 

Analytical procedures, personnel, and facilities used by the previous evaluators were not 

necessarily independent and it is not known if the authors of those reports were "Qualified 

Persons" as defined by National Instrument 43-101. 

Sources of information on prior exploration work in the general mineral exploration licence area 

are available as technical reports filed in fulfillment of annual assessment requirements that 

become non-confidential after 3 years.  These reports do not necessarily provide a complete 

record of exploration work.  It is not known if the material on file represents the complete record 

of all information collected by the previous exploration company. 

The Phanerozoic stratigraphy in the Bay St Georges area and the processes of evaporite 

precipitation, diagenesis, dissolution, and preservation are topics of both historical and on-going 

research by numerous industry, academic, and government bodies.  

Property descriptions and land status were obtained from the list of lands as set forth in the on-

line data provided by the Department of Mines and Energy, Newfoundland and Labrador 

Mineral Licence Inquiry database. No attempt to independently verify the land tenure 

information was made by the present authors.

The present Technical Report is prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of 

National Instrument 43-101.  It is based upon a study undertaken by the authors on behalf of 

Universal Uranium Ltd.. of the geology of its mineral licences comprising the Bay St Georges 

property, the main objectives of the study being to determine the general prospectivity of the 

property for potash. Most information comprising the bulk of the investigation was available 
through public record sources and derived from the expertise of the authors, which was gained 

during their participation in other mining ventures.  No engineering designs were produced and 

assumptions and estimates were made in many areas given the generic sense of the report and 

that the project is still in the early phase of evaluation.  Consequently, final grade and tonnage 

values based upon a selected mining cut or room height, mill feed calculation and the calculation 

of estimated revenue and expense streams were not made, nor was any reference given either to 

potash "ore" ,"reserve", or "resource", which as yet, does not exist.   

Furthermore, the reader is reminded that the term "ore" should not be used, disclosed or implied 

unless proven reserves have been estimated on the property.  To be called ore, the economic 

factor must be taken into account and it must be possible to extract metals or minerals profitably 

from the ore.  Since no proven reserves have been identified during the course of work 

undertaken to prepare this report, the term "ore" will not be used; however, where the term "ore" 

is used in this report, it is in the context of a direct quote taken from third-party reports or papers 

and as such is not compliant with recommendations set forth in National Instrument 43-101.  

The primary use of the technical information contained within the study will be to provide basic 

information for additional geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic studies.

2.1.2 Other Terms and Definitions 

The term "potash" is a colloquial term that is a contraction of "muriate of potash" which 

is expressed by the chemical formula "K2O" or "potassium oxide."  The terms "muriate of 

potash" and the contraction "K2O" are commonly used in the potash industry to refer to the sales 

product (i.e., potassium oxide resulting from the mining and milling of sylvite-bearing rock or 

"sylvinite").  "Sylvite" refers to the potassium mineral "sylvite" or potassium chloride ("KCl").  

The product mined and sold is KCl.  A ton of KCl contains an equivalent of 0.63 tons of K2O. 

In this report, the term "potash" will be used in the generic sense of the minerals that are 

potassium chloride-bearing, and the term "sylvinite" will be used to describe the specific mixture 

of sylvite (KCl) and halite (NaCl) that is the source of the "potash."  Sylvinite may also contain 

clay, anhydrite, and dolomite crystals that are collectively identified in the assay reports as 

"water insolubles."  Other impurities include the minerals carnallite (KCl.MgCl2.6H2O) and 

kieserite (MgSO4.H2O).  The presence of magnesium (Mg) is unfavorable and concentrations 

over 0.25% Mg can impact plant performance and require special non-standard processing.  

Where these terms are used in quotes, it reflects the use of these terms as per the historical record 

or previous authors. The word "salt" is also used as a colloquial term referring to the unspecified 

or undifferentiated evaporite minerals. For the purposes of this report the word halite is used 

wherever NaCl is known to occur.  The term evaporite refers to a generic category of minerals 

that have formed as a result of water evaporation, such as halite. 

Potash fertilizer is concentrated, >95% pure KCL, but the convention for reporting ore grades is 

based on the K2O value of the different potassium-bearing rocks and minerals. To convert from 

K2O equivalent tones to actual KCL tonnes, multiply by 1.63. 

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

The authors have relied upon information available to the general public and have not undertaken 

any work to validate such work.  As part of the reporting process, Mr. Halabura undertook a site 

visit to the properties during the period August 14 to 15, 2008.  During the visit no attempt was 

made to physically determine the presence of potash, other than to visit the ground location of 

the permits, discuss, in person, the geology of the St. Georges Basin with local geologists, and 

visit the offices and the core of the Department of Mineral Resources in Pasadena, 

Newfoundland. While at the A.K. Snelgrove Mineral Core Library in Pasadena, NL Mr. 

Halabura examined selected cores from the drill holes PF-1, PF-2, Hooker #1 and Captain Cook 

#1, and was able to confirm the local presence of sylvinite and carnallitite. No attempt was made 

to undertake detailed descriptive core logging. 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The Universal Uranium Ltd. Bay St Georges Property consists of 816 contiguous mineral 

exploration claims issued to Alpha Uranium Resources Inc. under the Mineral Act of 

Newfoundland and Labrador in 2007. These licences were subsequently sold to Universal 

Uranium Ltd (Appendix 1).

5.2 Climate 

 

This part of western Newfoundland is characterized by northern boreal zone climatic 

conditions. Dramatic seasonal variations occur, with winter conditions of freezing temperatures 

and heavy snowfall expected from late November through late March. Spring and fall seasons 

are cool, with frequent periods of rain, while summer conditions can be expected to prevail from 

late June through early September and typically provide good working conditions for field 

parties. Environment Canada records for the 1971 to 2000 period for nearby Stephenville show 

daily mean temperatures in August of 16.2
○
 Celsius (C) and an average summer maximum daily 

temperatures of 29.9
○

5.3 Infrastructure 

The St Georges Bay physiographic region is relatively sparsely populated region except 

for the settlements and communities along the coast of St Georges Bay. The property lies 

between the larger communities of Stephenville and Port-aux Basques. Numerous smaller 

communities are found along the coast. The property is cut by the Trans Canada highway 

(Highway No. 1) as it extends between Corner Brook and Channel-Port-aux-Basques, NL. 

Numerous logging roads run from the Trans Canada highway into the foothills of the 

Long Range Mountains, and into the Anguille Mountains.  

The nearest communities to the property are Jeffery's and Loch Leven, both coastal 

communities along the St Georges Bay west of the property. 

The Bay St Georges area has utilized two bulk loading facilities with conveyor systems to 

load ships. The Turf Point facility is south of Stephenville beside the town of St George and was 

built for the export of gypsum. A second bulk loading facility is located at Lower Cove, at the 

midpoint of the south side of the Port au Port Peninsula. This terminal was used for carbonate 

aggregate shipping. The authors have not verified the current activity at these ports. 

6.0 REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND TECTONIC SETTING  

The geological formations which host the evaporite sequences in Newfoundland are a 

northeastern extension of the Carboniferous aged Maritime Basin (Figure 3). This 

intracontinental basin system covered much of Atlantic Canada about 360 to 300 million years 

ago, after the closing of the Proto-Atlantic Ocean. The early and late infilling of this basin was 

by non-marine, continental clastic sediments. During the middle of this interval, (the Visean 

Epoch, estimated to be approximately 17 million years) there was significant deposition of 

marine sediments. In the Maritimes this saline basin is referred to as the Windsor Sea and the 

marine sediments are assigned to the Windsor Group. Geology of the Bay St Georges Subbasin 

of Newfoundland is considered to be broadly analogous to the geology in New Brunswick 

 

There are two large Carboniferous basins in western Newfoundland – the Deer Lake 

Basin in the north and the Bay St Georges Subbasin in the south (Figure 3) there was no 

significant marine deposition in the Deer Lake Basin and therefore it is unprospective for 

evaporite sequences including potash mineralization. 

 

The greatest thickness of Mississippian sediments within eastern Canada lies in the 

Fundy Epieugeosyncline.  During late Devonian times this northeasterly trending graben or rift 

structure extended from eastern New Brunswick to western Newfoundland.  The tectonic activity 

referred to as the Maritime Disturbance occurred mainly in the basin areas of the Fundy 

Epieugeosyncline.  This resulted in fragmentation of the Appalachian Basement followed by 

contemporaneous uplift and subsidence, creating source and deposition areas for Carboniferous 

sedimentation.  The combination of recurring epieugeosyncline subsidence with local uplifts 

during Carboniferous sedimentation resulted in onlap of each succeeding rock unit upon the 

flanks of positive areas.

The Bay St. Georges Subbasin exists within the regional scale Fundy Epieugeosyncline 

and lies along the southwest coast of Newfoundland.  It is bounded on the northwest by the 

folded Cambrian Platform and on the southeast by the Newfoundland Platform (Anderle 

1982).  These two positive areas stood topographically above the sites of deposition throughout 

Carboniferous time.  The Long Range Mountains composed of Precambrian igneous and 

metamorphic rocks were thrust westward up onto the younger Carboniferous Lowlands, and 

subsequently dissected the St. Georges Subbasin to its present surface (Anderle and Rogers, 

1981). The Anguille anticline forms mountainous highlands which dominate the southern half of 

the basin, from the mouth of the Codroy River, north to the Crabbes River 

 

The Bay St Georges Subbasin formed as a "pull-apart" basin on the western side of the 

Long Range Mountains. Its maximum width during the time of the deposition of the Codroy 

Group was approximately 60 km. Deformation caused local and regional compression and tilting 

of the sedimentary rocks, resulting in broad, open folds, reverse and normal faulting and "salt" 

tectonism.  Today, the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian formations lie with pronounced angular 

unconformity on Paleozoic and Precambrian fault-bounded basement blocks. 

 

Carboniferous rocks in the St. Georges Subbasin area were folded into two northeast-trending 

folds.  An open anticline involving mainly Mississippian rocks is called the Anguille Anticline 

and occupies most of the western central portion of the area.  It extends from Flat Bay to 

Robinsons.  The other fold is an open syncline, called the Codroy Syncline that involves mainly 

Pennsylvanian rocks and occupies the eastern portion of the Fischells area. A northeast-trending 

fault extending through the centre of the area separates the two open folds.  This latter fault 

passes between the previous Amax and Hooker drill holes at Fischells Brook.  Other small 

reverse and normal faults trend northeastwards and northwestwards (Anderle and Rogers, 1981). 

     

This marine-dominated package of rocks is approximately 1000 metres thick with over 

half of the section comprised of evaporites. In New Brunswick and Nova Scotia this marine 

sequence of rocks are extremely important economically, for it contains mineable deposits of 

potash, halite and gypsum, agricultural and metallurgical grade limestone, barite, celestite, 

masonry shale and native sulphur deposits. There is ongoing exploration for hydrocarbons in 

Carboniferous aged rocks in New Brunswick and Newfoundland.  

 

In the Bay St Georges Subbasin there is an approximately 10,000 metre thick sequence of 

sediments that are divided into three groups, namely the lower Anguille Group, the middle 

Codroy Group, and the upper Barachois Group. Marine sediments are only present in the Codroy 

Group (Figure 4).  

 

In the Bay St Georges Subbasin the prospective zones for marine evaporite deposition are 

within the lower Codroy Group which is the only marine portion of the stratigraphic sequence in 

this area. At the base of the Codroy Group is the Ship Cove Formation, a subtidal to supratidal 

laminated limestone unit from 20 to 45 metres thick and conformably overlying the Anguille 

Group. The Ship Cove limestone is overlain by the Codroy Road Formation and the lower 

Jeffrey's Village member of the Robinsons River Formation. These rocks comprise sulphate and

chloride evaporites. The upper Jeffrey's Village and Highland members of the Robinsons River 

Formation contain marine sediments and alluvial red beds. Fluvial sandstones of the Barachois 

Group overlie the sequence. The most prospective units for evaporite deposits are at the bottom 

(zone a) and top (zone b) of the Codroy Road Formation (Figure 4 and Figure 8). 

 

A portion of the Universal Uranium's mineral lease property coincides with bedrock geology of 

the Codroy Group although bedrock of the Barachois Group is present in the north central 

licence areas and the Anguille Group is present in licence area 01358M, located on the 

southwestern edge of the property (Figure 5).    

 

7.0 STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ST GEORGES SUBBASIN AREA 

No documentation of the stratigraphy of the immediate property area is known to the 

authors, nor have any drill cores from the immediate area been examined to determine the 

stratigraphy on the property or its immediate environs. This section is a summary based on a 

stratigraphic study by (Worth 1981) and included in Dimmell (1981) and a report on the potash 

resources of Newfoundland by Anderle (1982) which also cites Knight (1981). These references 

reflect the regional stratigraphic setting in the St Georges subbasin. Variations of the geology on 

the exploration leases may include areas where some units were not deposited or preserved or 

different units may be present. This could only be determined by onsite core drilling. 

In the St Georges Subbasin the basement rocks upon which the Carboniferous sediments 

lie are pre-Carboniferous anorthosites and basic gneisses of the Long Range Complex. These 

rocks make up the core of the Anguille anticline and fragments of them are present in the 

younger clastics of the area. 

7.1 Anguille Group 

The Anguille Group are the oldest and lower most sedimentary rocks, which were 

deposited after the basin was formed, are many fluvial conglomerates and sandstones with minor 

marine shales of late Devonian/early Mississippian age..  

7.2 Codroy Group 

The Lower Carboniferous Codroy Group in the Bay St Georges area was documented by  

Hayes and Johnson (1938), Bell (1948), Fong and Knight (1975)  and Worth (1981). The most 

comprehensive assessment of the stratigraphy in this area is the work by Bell (1948). Bell 

studied the fossil fauna of the limestones within the Codroy red beds and compared them with 

the type-section area of the Windsor Group in Nova Scotia. The Windsor Group is host to the 

most significant evaporite mineralization in the Maritime Basin, including the operating potash 

mine at Sussex NB.  

The Codroy Group contains up to 2,700 metres of red shales, siltstones, limestones, 

gypsum and sandstones which disconformably overly the Anguille Group rocks.

The lower Codroy section comprises a basal succession of limestone. gypsum, and fine-

grained clastics overlain by four red bed units, two of which contain relatively thick limestone 

units (Figures 4 and 7). 

7.2.1 Ship Cove Formation 

The Ship Cove lies at the base of the Codroy Group. This sequence includes the basal 

Ship Cove arenaceous limestone and sandstone. Other lithologies include the black fossiliferous 

Cormorant Limestone and several gypsum horizons ranging from 3 metres to 35 metres in 

thickness. These are intercalated with red-brown and grey siltstone, mudstone and shale.  

7.2.2 Journois Pond Formation 

Rocks of the Journois Pond Formation conformably overlie the Ship Cove Formation. This 

formation is composed of mainly gypsum and anhydrite lithologies. Two horizons of gypsum 

occur at the base of the Journois Pond Formation. The basal unit is a red and grey gypsiferous 

shale overlain by grey marine mudstone. 

7.2.3 Woodville Formation 

The two lower gypsum/anhydrite units of the Jounois Pond Formation are overlain by the "salt" 

and grey shale sequence of the Woodville Formation. This formation is divided into basal, 

middle and upper halite members with an overlying grey shale member. 

7.2.4 Jeffreys Village Formation 

The Woodville Formation evaporites are overlain by the clastic sequence of the Jeffreys Village 

Formation. The lower portion was deposited as deltaic channel sediments with minor evaporitic 

mudflats and hypersaline ponds and lagoons. 

The upper Jeffreys Village Formation is marine limestone and dolomite beds with intercalated 

calcareous sandstone and siltstone beds. A thick gypsum bed may be marked by sinkholes at 

surface.  

7.2.5 Summary 

The Ship Cove limestones, Journois Pond anhydrite and the Woodville evaporites and marine 

shale comprise the "Windsor A sub-zone" of Bell (1948). 

In summary, the sequence most likely to contain sylvinite and carnallite beds within the vicinity 

of the Universal exploration licences are within the lower Codroy Group. If the Woodville or 

equivalent formations are present on the property they would be the most prospective for potash 

mineralization. 

7.3 Structural Geology 

Worth (1981) points out that based on his interpretation of air photographs of this area, 

there is evidence that the Codroy Group is divided into several structural blocks by east-west 

trending thrust zones and cut by east-west trending normal (?) faults.

Worth (1981) interpreted that the main thrust zones extend from Plaster Cove to French 

Brook and along Butter Brook. Early east-west faulting is reported to be most evident in the Ship 

Cove area (Figure 1). It trends sub-parallel to the Codroy/Anguille contact. This faulting lies 

beneath the Plaster Cover – French Brook thrust Zone. These faults could be genetically related 

to the thrust although Worth did not think that these faults extend into the overlying thrust plate.  

 

8.0 HISTORY OF EXPLORATION FOR POTASH IN THE BAY ST GEORGES 

SUBBASIN 

The following summary of "salt" and potash exploration history of the Bay St Georges 

Subbasin is based on conversations between the senior author and Andrew Kerr of the 

Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey in June, 2008. Where terms are presented in 

quotes, the usage reflects the use of the terms as they appear in the historical record.  

The presence of "salt" springs in southwest Newfoundland was first noted in the 1930's. 

Regional gravity surveys completed in the 1950's identified several "gravity lows", suspected to 

be caused by subsurface evaporites. In 1968, a drill hole near Fischells Brook intersected a 

sequence of evaporite minerals, primarily halite with sylvite and carnallite. It is the opinion of 

the authors that the intersection referred to in the historical record is probably found within lower 

strata of the Codroy Group, possibly the Woodville Formation.  Further gravity surveys were 

then completed, leading to the identification of additional anomalies. Subsequent drilling at St 

Fintans and Robinsons also intersected subsurface "salt" deposits. Drill testing of anomalies at St 

Teresa, near Fischells Brook, and elsewhere failed to identify "salt" deposits. Other gravity lows 

in the subbasin remain untested, as they were interpreted to reflect locally thick overburden, 

rather than subsurface evaporites. The most extensive drilling to date was at Fischells Brook, in 

the early 1980's. The locations of this historic drilling are presented on Figures 5 and 6. 

Complete details of these exploration programs and their results are provided by Knight (1983) 

and Dimmell (2001).  

In 2002 and 2004 Vulcan Minerals explored the petroleum potential of the northern Bay St 

George Subbasin and completed two drill holes in the Flat Bay area. These holes intersected 

thick sequences of "salt", including several potash-enriched sections (Laracy, 2002). There has 

been substantial interest in potash potential recently, due to rising commodity prices, and much 

of the prospective ground has been staked.  

Selected drill cores from historical drilling programs are preserved at the A.K. Snelgrove 

Mineral Core Library at Pasadena NL.  A summary spreadsheet and photographs documenting 

these cores is included in Appendix 2. Stephen Halabura visited the facility and examined a very 

small selection of archived core from the St Georges Bay Subbasin in conjunction with the 

property site visit on August 14, 2008.

8.1 Summary of Known "Salt" and "Potash" Occurrences in the Bay St 

Georges Subbasin 

 

The material under this heading is summarized from Knight (1983), Dimmell (2001), 

Mineral Occurrence Data System (MODS) and Laracy (2002). There are presently five "salt" 

occurrences listed in MODS, of which four are known to contain associated potash. The sixth 

occurrence (Flat Bay #2) is not yet present in the MODS database (Andrew Kerr, 2008 pers 

comm.). None of the historic exploration documented in these references was conducted on the 

Universal Uranium exploration leases or has been verified by the authors of this report. 

8.1.1 Fischells Brook  

The Fischells Brook "salt" occurrence is located approximately 4 km due east of the 

Trans Canada Highway bridge over Fischells Brook and 300m south of the Trans Canada 

Highway, approximately 12 km northeast of the subject exploration leases (Figures 5 and 6). The 

area is a wooded, swampy, river valley within the coastal plain region. 

 

This is the most extensively explored evaporite deposit in the province, but it is still 

defined by only a few drill holes. Initial drilling by Hooker Chemical in 1968 intersected 750 m 

of "salt", commencing at a depth of 358m below surface, with a potash-bearing zone near the top 

of the evaporite sequence (381- 410m) that comprises an upper sylvite-bearing zone and a lower 

carnallite-bearing zone. Subsequent drilling in the 1980s also indicated substantial thicknesses of 

"salt", but did not adequately define a resource. This work further confirmed the upper potash-

bearing unit, and also defined a deeper unit (below 515m) dominated by carnallite, rather than 

sylvite. Knight (1983) suggested that the deposit could contain as much as 7 billion tonnes of 

"salt", based on earlier interpretation of the associated gravity anomaly. The unusual thickness of 

this "salt" deposit suggests that it may be a diapiric "plug" rather than a stratigraphic 

accumulation, although such unusual thicknesses could be produced in the latter situation if 

sedimentation was accompanied by active subsidence. The potash-bearing zones contain from 

3.7% to 15.3% K2O. The highest-grade intersection was 4.1 m averaging 13.2% K2O, reported to 

be mostly sylvite; the thickest intersection of interest was 7.8 m at 7.95% K2O. The possibility 

that the Fischells Brook deposit is a discordant plug developed through diapiric processes 

suggests that potash-rich zones within it may be complex in geometry and/or discontinuous. 

Dimmell (2001) considered the area to have potential for further exploration aimed at potash, 

rather than "salt". 

 

Evaporite minerals documented at the Fischells Brook occurrence are halite, polyhalite, 

sylvite and carnallite. The "salt" deposit lies on the eastern limb of the northeast-striking 

Fischells - Barachois anticline and has a distinct gravity (low) signature associated with it.  The 

deposit has been intersected by three diamond drill holes which reveal some detail of the 

deposit.  The 1968 discovery hole drilled by Hooker Chemical was located about 120m south of 

the Trans Canada Highway near Fischells Brook, 15km south-southwest of the Town of St.

Georges and 10km from the coast.  The total depth of the hole was 1099m (3605 

feet).  Approximately 750m of "salt" was intersected with the hole still in "salt" at 1099m.  

 

The "salt" deposits are within an evaporite sequence of the Codroy Group 

(Mississippian)(Woodville Formation?) and appear to constitute domal structures consisting 

mainly of halite (NaCl) with some potassium, either as sylvite (KC1) or carnallite (KMgCl3 - 

6H20) (Fleming, 1974). The Codroy Group evaporites were intersected at a depth of 337m with 

the "salt" section beginning at 358m.  Minor potash was located within the "salt" section. A total 

of 7.6m (25 feet) grading 6.9% K2O was intersected between 376m (1234 feet) and 383.7m 

(1259 feet).  The best section was 1.5m (5 feet) grading 13.4% K2O. 

     

Within the "salt" zone, there are a few "salt"-bearing red and brown mudstone beds.  The 

evaporite minerals consist mainly of red, orange, pink and gray halite and various amounts of 

polyhalite and sylvite. 

  

Gypsum and anhydrite are present in the basal part of this zone.  Halite crystals up to 

10cm in diameter are common within these beds.  The best sylvite mineralization is in the 

section from 370m to 393m which contains up to 11% KC1.  The content of NaC1 in the same 

section ranges from 97% to 98.2%.  Assays for the other part of the "salt" zone in this hole are 

not available. 

 

In 1980, Pronto Exploration drilled two holes (PF-1 and PF-2) to test the potash potential 

of the northern portion of the inland negative gravity anomaly at Fischells Brook (Figure 1 and 

Figure 6).  The following descriptions are extracted from Anderle (1982). 

  

The first Pronto drill hole (PF-1) was located some 1,066 m (3500 feet) north-northwest 

of the Hooker Chemical discovery drill hole. The drill hole collared in rocks of the Highlands 

Formation.  At 42.7 to 70.1m (140 to 230 feet), a series of thin limestone beds were 

intersected.  The hole encountered the gypsiferous rocks of the Woodville Formation at 286.5m 

(940 feet).  The top of the "salt" sequence was encountered at 321.9m (1,056 feet) without 

encountering any major anhydrite or gypsum beds. 

 

The upper "salt" member contains interbedded mudstone-siltstone and brown halite from 321.8 

to 370.3m (1056 to 1215 feet); banded brown-clear-black halite interbedded with carnallite and 

mudstone, with minor sylvite and scattered polyhalite from 370.3 to 706.5m (1215 to 2318 

feet).  The lower basal "salt" member consists of light orange halite and anhydrite stringers from 

706.5 to 720.2m (2318 to 2363 feet) and coarse-grained, grey halite with bands of grey anhydrite 

from 720.2 to 879.9m (2363 to 3887 feet).  The Lower Basal "salt" contains two sylvite units 

between 711.1 to 731.2m (2333 to 2399 feet) that contain 6.3 to 9.2% K2O across 5.6 and 3.0 

feet respectively. 

     

The second Pronto drill hole (PF-2) was located some 1200m (3940 feet) north of the 

Hooker Chemical discovery hole.  This hole encountered dark gray shales and minor gypsum 

beds of the Woodville Formation after penetrating 18.2m (60 feet) of glacial till.  "Salt" was 

encountered at 203.4m (667 feet).  "Potash" mineralization consisting of minor sylvite and

crystal coatings of carnallite was first encountered at 214.9m (705 feet).  A 0 to 30 degree 

dipping sylvite horizon was encountered at 230.4 to 465.1m (753 to 1526 feet). 

     

The carnallite horizon, although structurally disturbed, lies immediately below the sylvite 

horizon at 551.7 to 565.2m (1810 to 1854.4 feet).  It is associated with a sylvite zone at 565.2 to 

567.3m (1854.4 to 1861.4 feet) that runs 13.3% K2O.  The carnallite zone is at 555.9 to 564.3m 

(1824 to 1851.4 feet) averaging 8.33% K2O with 1 to 22% water insolubles. 

     

The upper "salt" member contains interbedded mudstone with brownish halite from 203.3 

to 214.9m (667 to 705 feet); interbedded brown to orange halite, mudstone, clear sylvite and 

minor red carnallite from 214.9 to 421.5m (705 to 1383 feet); the lower basal "salt" contains a 

potash member from 431.3 to 446.8 m (1415 to 1466 feet).  The core interval between 465.1 to 

545.9m (1526 to 1791 feet) is a faulted and folded section repeating the beds from 417.8 to 

564.1m (1371 to 1526 feet).  A clear to pink fibrous bed of pure carnallite averaging 17% K2O is 

repeated four times between 506.8 to 520.6m (1663 to 1708 feet).  The lower basal "salt" is 

again recognizable as gray halite with anhydrite stringers and/or blebs at 591.6m (1941 feet).  

 

Repeated portions of these folded zones average 13.2% and 15.3% K2O. Analyses - Oven-dried 

basis 105 degrees Celsius. 

 

8.1.2 Captain Cook # 1 

This thick evaporite deposit is indicated by a petroleum exploration well completed in the 

Flat Bay area in 2002 (Figures 1, 3 and 5). Vulcan Minerals Inc. identified anomalous features 

that were suggestive of halite deposits. The single 605.2m drill hole (Captain Cook #1) was 

highlighted by the intersection of  more than 150m of halite including several potassium-

enriched sections (Laracy, 2002). 

 

Drilling indicated over 165m of "salt" deposits, which appear to be well stratified, 

suggesting that there has been little flowage of material. The depth to the top of the "salt" is 

about 197m. The descriptions indicate white, homogeneous halite, and thinner pink to red beds 

interpreted to contain the minerals sylvite and/or carnallite (Laracy, 2002). The "salt" section is 

underlain by almost 250m of anhydrite. No information on potash grades has been released by 

the company; however personal examination of the core by Halabura during the August 14, 2008 

site visit confirmed the occurrence of sylvite (290.0m to 293.0m) and carnallite (293.5 to 

297.0m).

8.1.3 Flat Bay # 2  

This occurrence was discovered by means of a petroleum exploration well drilled at this 

site in 2004. The drill hole, Flat Bay #2, is located approximately 2 km southeast of Captain 

Cook #1, and it intersected 200m of primarily halite bearing evaporites. Vulcan Minerals 

describe this material as similar to the "salt" zone in Captain Cook #1, and proposes that the two 

deposits may be physically connected on the basis of seismic surveys, There is presently no 

information on the distribution and/or grades of any potash-rich zones in the evaporite interval, 

or if there is a lower section of anhydrite mineralization, as in Captain Cook #1. 

 

8.1.4 St. Fintans 

The St Fintans occurrence is located 2.5 km due south of the mouth of Crabbes River, 

approximately 200m from the road between St. David's and St. Fintans (Highway 405) (Figures 

1 and 5).  It is the closest drilled occurrence of potash to the Universal Uranium mineral leases, 

occurring some 10 to 15 kilometers from the western  boundary of the Mineral Exploration 

Lease 013584M. The occurrence is located in a very flat coastal plane approximately 1.7 km 

from the St. Georges Bay coastline. There may be  some karst development in the area, manifest 

by small sinkholes

The drill hole is located on the northern limb of an open symmetrical syncline; with the 

trend of the axial plain being NW-SE. Worth's report on the stratigraphy of the Highlands - St. 

Fintans area suggests intense deformation of the "salt" and "potash" beds in the St. Fintans "salt" 

body (Dimmell, 1981). 

 

This deposit is defined by a drill hole completed in the 1970s, which intersected 

approximately 89m of  evaporite mineralization. The top of the deposit is located at about 230m 

below surface. The main "salt" zone is flanked by zones containing numerous thin "salt" beds. 

The "salt" was not considered to be high enough in quality to warrant economic exploitation, and 

individual beds were generally less than 3 m thick. There are 11 "potash"-rich zones, ranging 

from < 0.5 m to 4.3 m in thickness, grading from 3.7% to 9.1% K2O. Both sylvite and carnallite 

were reported to be present. Anhydrite is also present in the "salt"-rich sections, and the 

insoluble content is relatively high. The deposit is overlain by approximately 756 feet of glacial 

material and Codroy shale. 

     

The highest potassium assay results from the core were 6.61% (over 2.5 feet) of white 

and red "salt" at the 803 to 806 foot depth.  

8.1.5 Robinsons  

The occurrence is located ENE of the community of Heatherton, between highway 63 

and the CNR rail line on the south side of Seal Brook. The occurrence lies in a wooded, low, flat 

coastal plain 1.1 km from tidewater. Some karst topography  may occur in the area. Outcrop in 

the area is very scarce; the drill hole penetrated in excess of 45 m of overburden at the site.   

 

Three anomalies appear in the residual gravity map but only the northernmost was 

tested.  Gypsum and/or overburden were considered as likely causes for the two minor anomalies 

in this area.   The existence of "salt" springs in this area and the relatively shallow depths at 

which "salt" might have added to the interest in this prospect. 

 

The "salt" deposits are within an evaporite sequence of the Codroy Group (Mississippian 

age) and appears to constitute domal structures consisting mainly of halite with some potassium, 

either as sylvite (KCl) or carnallite (KMgCl)3 6H20) (Fleming, 1974). 

 

This occurrence was discovered by a drill hole completed in the 1970s which intersected 

250 m of "salt" at a  "depth of 217m to 467.5m; this section consisted of "salt", described as 

gray, white, off-white or "beautiful salt", also some sections of mud and some "potash".  From 

467.5 to 692m end of the hole) a mixture of "salt", mud and potash was encountered. Below the 

main "salt" zones, are black shales with thin "salt" units, and about 50m of "salt" is present just 

above the bottom of the hole (692m). The "salt" was described as of generally poor quality, and 

commonly mixed with thin mudstone units. "Potash"-rich zones (14 in total) range from about 

1m to 8.5m in thickness, but the grades are relatively low, at 2.7% to 5.6% K2O. Both sylvite 

and carnallite were noted in the drill core. Over the length of the hole sodium chloride assays 

ranged from 99.08% down to 24.12%.  Potassium (K) assays ranged from 4.9% down to 0 .06%.

Four grab samples of core four inches long, chosen because of their apparent "potash" 

potential returned assays that ranged from 4.4% at 1090 feet up to 12% at 1715 feet. 

 

8.1.6 Highlands River 

The occurrence is located on the southern fringe of a major southwest-northeast trending 

gravity low that lies between Highlands River and Crabbes River, about 2 km south of the 

subject mineral leases. Verrall (1954) also notes the existence of "salt" springs at this location. 

This occurrence consists of a series of "salt"-bearing springs indicating the presence of 

subsurface evaporites, but apparently it has not been tested through drilling. Interpretation of the 

gravity data in this area suggested that the potential size of any "salt" deposits would be limited. 

(Fleming, 1974). A series of "salt"-bearing springs of particular interest occur in a zone about 

150 m long, about 300 m due east of Cartwheel Turn.  Salty and brackish water flows in 

considerable volume from several vents.  Fresh specimens of the water are crystal clear but on 

standing for an hour or two turn cloudy brown with limonite which gradually settles to the 

bottom or clings to the sides of a container (Verrall, 1954).  A cursory analysis indicates a little 

over 1% sodium chloride.  The springs issue from strata of the lower Codroy Group of clastic 

and carbonate rocks.  They strike northeast and dip to the southeast. The beds are folded into 

anticlinal/synclinal structures and are faulted locally. 

8.1.7 Potential for Further Discoveries 

This section is based on correspondence between the principal author and Dr. Andrew 

Kerr of the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey in June, 2008 (Kerr, 2008 per 

comm.).The presence of evaporite deposits containing lesser amounts of "potash" is well 

established in the northern part of the Bay St. Georges Subbasin, but the details and extent of 

such deposits are not fully defined. Nevertheless, the thickness of evaporite deposits at Fischells 

Brook, and the possible continuity of these deposits between the Captain Cook and Flat Bay 

petroleum wells imply the potential for large potential resources. The indicated "potash" grades 

are mostly less than 10% K2O, (compared to grades of some 20% to 23% K2O in Saskatchewan 

and New Brunswick), and "potash" zones identified to date are relatively thin. These grades were 

too low to attract serious interest in the past, but may merit consideration if the current trend 

continues and the price of potash is sufficient. As noted by Knight (1983), only the central parts 

of most gravity lows have been tested to date, and economic potash deposits in equivalent rocks 

in New Brunswick occur on the flanks of associated gravity lows (Knight 1983) and Figure 8. To 

date, all known "salt" and/or "potash" deposits are located in the northwestern part of the Bay St 

Georges Subbasin, where the prospective rocks lie at relatively shallow depths around the flanks 

of the Flat Bay anticline. The interpretations of Knight (1983) suggest that prospective strata also 

lie in the deeper subsurface in the northeast, beneath coal-bearing strata of the Barachois Group, 

and also in the southeast, beneath the upper terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the Codroy Group. 

The depth to rocks with potential to contain evaporites ranges from 1000m in the northeast to as 

much as 2000m in the southeast, although the latter estimate is tentative. Given that potash 

mining in Saskatchewan currently takes place at depths of approximately 1000m, these 

unexplored areas also have potential for economic discoveries, although they represent 

intrinsically more challenging targets for exploration and development.

9.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Potash in the Maritime Basin of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia occurs within 

structurally complex geological settings which are very different from the settings found in the 

Prairie Evaporite sequence of Saskatchewan. It is the opinion of the authors that any occurrences 

as described above within the Bay St Georges Basin would likely be similarly complex.   

The Carboniferous geology of the Maritime Provinces and Quebec is characterized by a 

series of northeast trending fault-bound grabens containing clastics and evaporites (mostly halite) 

up to 10 km thick. (Roberts and Williams, 1993) The Windsor Group (Visean) in Nova Scotia 

and New Brunswick hosts MgSO4  potash evaporites in several continental intermontaine basins 

that were created by extension-driven post-Acadian strike-slip faulting with the evaporite beds 

then subjected to plastic deformation, first by extension and then by subsequent compression. 

The same evaporite unit that hosts the reported potash beds also acts as a seal to Mississippi 

Valley-type deposits at Gays River and Jubilee. 

In the Moncton Subbasin, near Sussex New Brunswick the Penobsquis/Piccadilly potash 

deposits are hosed in bedded marine evaporite deposits which were precipitated within an Early 

Carboniferous rift basin. This depositional complex is believed to have extended from western 

Newfoundland southward to the Sussex region of southern New Brunswick where the 

Penobsquis / Piccadilly sylvite mineralization is presently being mined. Following deposition, 

the horizontally bedded evaporite units were deformed by late Carboniferous thrusting, into 

large-scale isoclinal recumbent folds.   

10.0 MINERALIZATION 

 No potash mineralization is known to occur on the subject mineral exploration licenses. 

Section 8.1 of this report summarizes results of previous exploration programs conducted in the 

Bay St. Georges Subbasin region. During the site visit of August 14, 2008, Mr. Halabura visited 

the A.K. Snelgrove core facility at Pasadena, NL and visually inspected selected cores. He 

visually identified sylvite and carnallite in PR-1, PF-2 and Captain Cook #1. None of these drill 

holes are located on the Universal Uranium Ltd. mineral exploration licenses. 

11.0 EXPLORATION 

The subject mineral exploration Licence Area is exploratory in that there has been no 

production of potash from the area lands.  Universal Uranium Ltd. has not undertaken any 

exploration on their own behalf, other than to review public-domain geological reports and maps, 

and to view cores at the A.K. Snelgrove Mineral Core Library at Pasadena, Newfoundland, 

which was done by author Halabura during a site visit undertaken August 14 and 15, 2008.      

Given that the potash occurrences described for the St. Georges Subbasin represent 

subsurface mineralization, nowhere in the Licences Area does the potash mineralization outcrop 

at surface; therefore the only data available for evaluation are existing drill-hole results 

consisting of, geological reports, chemical assays of drill core, and interpreted gravity maps

which were recovered from the public records. It is important to note that none of the drill 

holes documenting potash mineralization in the Bay St Georges Subbasin were collared on 

the subject mineral exploration Licences Area; therefore no mineral resource is present 

within the subject lands at the time of writing the report.   

12.0 DRILLING 

There is no potash exploration or verification drilling within the Universal Uranium Ltd. 

mineral exploration Licences Area therefore no mineral resource is present within the 

subject lands at the time of writing this report.

16.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

16.1 Other Potash Properties within the Maritime Basin 

 

The Moncton Subbasin in New Brunswick hosts evaporite mineralization that has been 

the subject of  exploration  since the late 1800's. Production from the Penobsquis mine belonging 

to Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PCS), near Sussex, New Brunswick began in 1983. 

The potash seam here is reported to be steeply-dipping and hosted in the Windsor Formation. 

The mine operates as a conventional cut and fill underground operation at depths between 300 

and 700 metres below surface. From inception until 2008, this mine  is reported to have produced 

over 46 million tonnes of muriate of potash. 

In 2001, another zone of potash mineralization in the vicinity of the Penobsquis mine 

(Piccadilly zone) was identified during a natural gas drilling program. Since then PCS has 

carried out two potash exploration programs to delineate the zone. The results were sufficiently 

encouraging that mine design and feasibility studies were carried out by 2007 (Moore et al, 

2008).

16.2  Potash Occurrences in the Bay St. Georges Subbasin 

 

Based on information presented by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and 

Labrador (Mineral Occurrences Data System, MODS), there are five "salt" (interpreted by the 

authors to mean halite and associated evaporite minerals) occurrences listed, of which four are 

known to contain associated potash, i.e. sylvinite. The sixth occurrence (Flat Bay #2) is not yet 

present in the MODS database.(Andrew Kerr, 2008 pers comm.). None of the historic "salt" or 

potash occurrences are located on the Universal Uranium mineral exploration licences.  
 

A detailed summary of these occurrences is presented under Section 7.1 "Summary of 

Known Salt and Potash Occurrences in the Bay St Georges Subbasin". The most extensively 

explored occurrence area is Fischells Brook (Figure 5). 

 

17.0 MINERAL PROCESSING METALLURGICAL TESTING 

This section is not applicable. 

18.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

This section is not applicable. 

20.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

The Bay St Georges Subbasin is a subbasin within the Maritime Sedimentary Basin 

which extends over substantial portions of the Maritime Provinces of Nova Scotia, New 

Brunswick and Newfoundland (Figure 2). In New Brunswick and Nova Scotia significant 

deposits of potash mineralization are known and in the case of New Brunswick, actively mined 

at Sussex New Brunswick. The Bay St Georges Subbasin has been the subject of several 

intervals of exploration and is a metallogenically interesting domain considered to be prospective 

for base metals, coal and uranium as well as economic concentrations of evaporite minerals 

including halite, gypsum and potash. 

The area was drilled for "salt" (halite) in the early 1970's. Gravity geophysical surveys 

were undertaken and selected anomalies were tested. At St Fintans, near the western end of the 

Universal Uranium mineral leases, halite, sylvite and carnallite were encountered. The "salt" was 

not considered to be of high quality as the insoluble residue content was considered to be too 

high to be of economic value.  

It is the conclusion of the authors that:

1. Sylvinite and carnallite mineralization has been reported from drill holes in the general St. 
Georges Subbasin of western Newfoundland and it is therefore it is reasonable to expect the 

discovery of additional sylvinite and carnallite mineralization, given the right geological 

(sedimentological and structural) conditions, within the St. Georges Subbasin; 

Historical drilling has identified sylvinite and carnallite beds, generally some 30 meters 

thick with grades less than 10% K2O, however the potash-bearing zones at Fischells 

Brook contain from 3.7% to 15.3% K2O. The highest-grade intersection was 4.1m 

averaging 13.2% K2O, reported to be mostly sylvite; the thickest intersection of interest 

was 7.8m at 7.95% K2O.  The reader is cautioned that we are not able to verify these 

numbers, nor are we able to comment upon the size, vertical and lateral continuity 

or aerial extent of the beds in question. 

Furthermore, we are not able to verify anything concerning the sampling and/or 

assay methods, and the reader is reminded that such information is not to the 

standards set forth in National Instrument 43-101." 

2. In the opinion of the authors, the highest prospectivity for potash mineralization in the 
subject area is coincident with the lower Codroy Group sediments (Figure 5).  Furthermore, it 

is the opinion of the authors that the potash mineralization may be associated with the 

thickest intersections of evaporite, which also coincide with geophysical gravity "lows". If 

the subject exploration licenses are shown to be the location of lower Codroy Formation 

evaporitic sequences it may be reasonable to expect that exploration of the ground where 

these sequences are present could result in the discovery of evaporite minerals that may 

include sylvinite and carnallite; and 

3. While there has been no drilling on the Universal property for potash, it is the opinion of the 
authors that further work is justified in testing for the presence of sylvinite and/or carnallite 

mineralization within the licenced ground, specifically within the regions marked by the 

highlighted area on Figure 9, as investigations to date suggest that these lands lie within the 

extent of the prospective lower Codroy Group rocks and may be coincident with a gravity 

lows. 

Given the above conclusions, the authors recommend the following further steps in 

determining whether or not a potash mineral resource is present on the Universal Uranium Ltd. 

Exploration Licenses: 

1. Previous studies carried out by Worth (1981) and Knight (1983) suggest that the area 
between St Fintans and Highlands, including the subject area, have been intensely, 

structurally deformed.  Because these faults were inferred from interpretations of 

photographs, it is recommended that first, a comprehensive interpretation of the structural 

geology be undertaken, including ground checks, to confirm the nature of faulting and 

better define the structural geology of the licence lands; 

2. If the above field mapping program suggests that preserved evaporite may be present in 
structurally favorable portions of the licences, then it is recommended as a second step

that a ground gravity geophysical survey be undertaken over the anomalies identified in 

previous episodes of reconnaissance exploration so as to delineate prospective drilling 

targets for the drilling of one or several potash exploration drill holes; 

3. Although the present mineral resource assessment focused on the potential for potash 
mineralization, consideration of the potential for other economic mineral concentrations 

should not be overlooked during the exploration work recommended above. The inferred 

presence of thrust faulting identified by Dimmell (1981) especially the movement of 

strata over the basal Ship Cove and Cormorant Limestones draws attention to the base 

metal potential of the area near the Codroy-Anguille contact. This area should be 

explored for base metal deposits in the carbonates, where breccias would be expected.  

Furthermore, there are reports of coal beds (Figure 9) encountered in the vicinity of the 

licences, so attention should be paid to identifying the potential presence of a coal 

resource.

LETTER TO THE HONOURABLE KATHY DUNDERDALE 

MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND 

LABRADOR 

RECOGNIZING OUTSTANDING SERVICE OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF 

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR



 

 
The Honourable Kathy Dunderdale 

Ministry of Natural Resources 

Box 8700, St John's, NL 

A1B 4J6 

 

In regards to: the services of Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador 

 

Dear Minister, 

Subject: Quality Information and Outstanding Service 

 

I wish to communicate the high degree of satisfaction that we experience whenever dealing with 

the Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey. I have dealt with several individuals in the" 

Survey", most often in the Mineral Deposits Section. I have the privilege of dealing with similar 

organizations across Canada and internationally. The information platform provided by the 

Geological Survey portion of the Natural Resources web site is the most complete and accessible 

I have encountered. The staff of the Geological Survey have the depth of experience and 

dedication to provide a high level of service. We have recently enjoyed excellent service from 

Dr. Andrew Kerr, Senior Geologist, Mineral Deposits Section and Dr. Ian Knight, Project 

Geologist, Regional Geology Section. 

The services and resources provided by the Geological Survey are critical to the development of 

the mineral resources industry in Newfoundland and Labrador. The levels of funding for 

mapping and information delivery to the mineral industry must be kept up in order to continue 

and expand the level of service that has been established. I commend you and your government 

on your commitment to date and encourage the continued support of this highly motivated and 

successful team to the fullest extent possible. 

 
 
Respectfully, 

 

 

 

Sandra Foster 

Consulting Geologist
