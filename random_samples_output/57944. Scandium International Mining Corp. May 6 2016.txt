1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction and Statement of Objectives of the Technical Report 

This report, entitled "Feasibility Study - Nyngan Scandium Project" (the "Technical 
Report", or the Report), has been prepared for Scandium International Mining Corp. (SCY, 
or the Company), a Canadian TSX-listed mining company (TSX:SCY.To), headquartered 
in Sparks, Nevada, USA.  SCY owns 80% of EMC Metals Australia Pty Ltd (EMC-A).  
EMC-A is an Australian company, headquartered in Queensland and is 100% owner of 
the Nyngan Scandium Project (the Project), located in NSW, Australia. 

The Company formally changed its name from EMC Metals Corp. (EMC) to Scandium 
International Mining Corp. in November 2014, to better reflect the purpose and strategic 
direction of the Company.  Activity and reporting on this project prior to that name change, 
done in the name of EMC, as may be identified in this Technical Report, is synonymous 
with SCY. 

The Company requested Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd (Lycopodium) of Brisbane, 
Australia to complete this Technical Report to report on the results of a feasibility study on 
the Project (the Feasibility Study or the DFS).  This Technical Report has been 
independently compiled for SCY in the form prescribed under National Instrument 43-101 
– Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") by Lycopodium. 

This Technical Report presents an update to the measured and indicated resource (M&I 
Resource) previously reported in the Amended Technical Report and Preliminary 
Economic Assessment of the Nyngan Scandium Project, NSW, Australia (the PEA), 
originally announced in October 2014.  The Technical Report further establishes the initial 
Mineral Reserve on a portion of the M&I Resource associated with the Nyngan property 
and presents new engineering and economic disclosures on the proposed development of 
the Nyngan Scandium Project. 

The Technical Report on the overall economics of the Nyngan Scandium Project has been 
designed to a Class 2 Definitive Feasibility Study level, with an overall standard of 
accuracy of +15%/-5%. 

This Feasibility Study is the first study commissioned by SCY to employ a continuous high 
pressure acid leach system (HPAL) to the front end of the Project processing flowsheet.  
The Company has previously explored atmospheric leaching, high temperature 
atmospheric leaching (Acid Bake), and finally, batch HPAL as employed in the PEA.  
Continuous pressure leaching systems, employing constant feed into an autoclave, are 
the systems typically used in large lateritic resource processing plants, most analogous to 
nickel processing, often with co-product cobalt circuits.  This process tends to be the most 
efficient in minimising acid consumption, achieving the best overall product recovery, and 
ultimately with the lowest production cost.  It has been applied in numerous lateritic 
resource metal recovery plants over +20 years, with commercial success.  That said, this 
Project is sized very much at the small end of the spectrum to employ a continuous HPAL

process.  The Technical Report results support the choice, particularly with review of the 
results of earlier processing techniques on this Resource, and at this scale. 

This Technical Report incorporates information from other reports previously completed 
for SCY, in particular: 

 NI 43-101 Amended Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment on 
the Nyngan Scandium Project, NSW, Australia, prepared for EMC by Larpro, of 
Toowong, Qld, Australia, Effective Date- October 10, 2014.   

 Nyngan Scandium Project Study, prepared for EMC management by SNC-
Lavalin of Brisbane, Australia, February 2012. 

 Scandium Recovery From Gilgai Laterite Ores by Acid Curing, Baking, Leaching, 
Solvent Extraction, and Precipitation, prepared for EMC management by Roberts 
& Schaefer Company, of Sandy, Utah, July 2010. 

In addition to these reports on the project, SCY has commissioned a number of 
metallurgical test work programs with various independent groups, over the previous six 
years dating back to 2010, the results of which were all considered in this Technical 
Report. 

This Technical Report has been developed in accordance with the Canadian Institute of 
Mining (CIM) guidelines for such Technical Reports to accomplish the following objectives: 

 Define the economic viability of the Nyngan Scandium Project, and present a 
single investment option for consideration. 

 Obtain a reasonable certainty of process, production, revenue, scope, time and 
cost. 

 Develop a document that will support further development decisions by the 
Project sponsors, and support further funding for those advanced studies 

 Establish a baseline for both Project execution and operations  

1.2 DFS Financial Highlights 

A summary of the key financial results from the DFS is presented in Table 1.1.  

NOTE:  All dollar figures are expressed in United States Dollars (US$) unless 
otherwise noted and all tonnes references are intended to be metric tonnes,

1.3 Property Description and Location 

The Nyngan project site is located approximately 450 km northwest of Sydney (flight 
distance), NSW, Australia and approximately 25 km (road distance) due west from the 
town of Nyngan, a rural town of approximately 2,100 people.  The project site is accessed 
from the Barrier Highway, a paved two lane all-weather road connecting the town of 
Nyngan with Cobar.  The project site is located 5 km south of Miandetta, off the Barrier 
Highway and is situated in flat countryside classified as agricultural land.  Local area land 
use is predominantly wheat farming and livestock grazing. 

Mining has historically been and continues to be a feature of the local economy.  The 
closest current mining operation to the town of Nyngan is the Tritton copper mine, located 
approximately 45 km to the northwest.  The Tritton resource has been in near-continuous 
operation for over 23 years, initially developed in 1992 as the Girilambone copper mine 
and processing plant, which closed in 2001.  Straits Resources Limited (ASX:SRQ) 
reopened the mine as the Tritton Copper mine in 2004.  The mine is currently operating, 
and Straits Resources has taken new partners and renamed itself Aeris Resources Ltd. 
(ASX:AIS).  Aeris Resources recently announced a positive feasibility study and initiation 
of a 3+ year extension on operations referred to as the Murrawombie U/G Copper Mine 
Project, augmenting production in Q4 FY16.  The town of Cobar, 120 km west of the

Nyngan property, has been host to copper mining since 1870, where the CSA Mine is 
currently in operation producing copper and silver, owned and operated by Glencore. 

The most significant mining project under development (A$1bn capex) in the area is the 
Dubbo Zirconium Project, owned by Alkane Resources Limited (ASX:ALK), approximately 
165 km southeast of the town of Nyngan, which will produce zirconia and a range of rare 
earth products. 

1.4 Project Geology and Resources 

The general area is dominated by Cainozoic alluvium of the Bogan River floodplain (part 
of the Murray-Darling River Basin) with minor colluvium and outcrop.  The Gilgai intrusive 
complex underlies the Nyngan property, covered by 8 to 40 m of alluvial material, and is 
almost certainly the source of the scandium, nickel, cobalt and precious metals in the 
regolith.  The Gilgai complex is an Alaskan type ultramafic complex, crudely concentrically 
zoned, and made up of a range of rock types including hornblende monzonite, 
hornblendite, pyroxenite, olivine pyroxenite to dunite / peridotite and is believed to be of 
Ordovician age.  The intrusives are included within the "Fifield Platinum Province". 

The Nyngan scandium resource is located in a highly weathered (ultramafic) zone, where 
the weathering profile can extend to a depth of more than 60 m.  This highly weathered 
zone exhibits a fairly typical laterite profile, with hematitic clay just under the alluvium, 
followed by limonitic and saprolitic clays, weathered bedrock and fresh bedrock.  The bulk 
of the scandium resource resides in the limonite and saprolite material. 

The original resource was established on the Nyngan property in 2010.  That original 
resource was based on 2005 and 2006 drill programs conducted and supervised by 
Jervois Mining Ltd., consisting of 72 aircore holes in to the laterite body supplemented by 
assays of sample pulps from seven historic holes, to delineate a scandium resource. 

In 2014 and 2015, EMC Metals (Australia) Pty. Ltd. drilled an additional 33 aircore holes 
and three diamond core holes to validate the resource and provide superior sample 
material for further assessment.  The Company also drilled six geotechnical core holes in 
the general resource area, four of which passed through the laterite profile and provided 
assays and data for specific gravity (SG) calculations. 

The total drill program history has generated a new property resource, now incorporating 
all recent drill and assay data.  The full data base has been digitised and used Whittle 4-X 
resource calculation software to arrive at a new resource estimate, as shown in Table 1.2.

Table 1.2 2016 Updated Nyngan Project Mineral Resource Estimate 

 

The 20-year Project plan will utilise approximately 1.45 million tonnes of limonite resource 
from the total measured and indicated categories, albeit at a grade higher than the 
average resource grade shown in Table 1.2 for the combined limonite and saprolite 
resource. 

1.5 Mineral Reserve Estimates 

The DFS confirms positive economics on a portion of the mineral resource to a sufficient 
level of accuracy to establish a mineral reserve on the portion of the resource mined and 
processed in the 20 year DFS.  The reserve was prepared by evaluating the resource 
using Whittle-4X optimisation software.  Economic and physical inputs were validated to 
identify the optimised pit shells in two mining pits, both a part of the 20 year mine plan.  
The mineral reserve is shown in Table 1.3. 

Table 1.3 Mineral Reserve - Nyngan Scandium Project 

 

1.6 General Project Description 

The Nyngan Scandium Project is designed as a small surface mining operation, 
recovering approximately 75,000 t of limonite ore from the resource per year, at an 
average strip ratio of 3.37:1 waste to ore.  The average limonite scandium head grade to 
the mill facility over 20 years is 409ppm.  The mill facility will size the input material, heat 
and apply sulphuric acid to pre-treat the material, and feed the acidified ore into a 
continuous autoclave (HPAL) system.  Downstream systems will then recover scandium

from the autoclave leachate, using solvent extraction (SX), oxalate precipitation, and 
calcination, to generate a finished scandium oxide product, grading 98 to 99.9% Sc2O3. 

The Project development and commissioning schedule includes a one year construction 
period, commencing in 2017, with initial commissioning in late 2017, wet commissioning in 
the first two months of 2018, and a total 24 month ramp-up period to reach nameplate 
capacity of 75,000 tpy ore throughput and approximately 38,500 kg of scandium oxide 
product per year. 

The mine plan generates slightly different tonnages and grades by year, so most of the 
annual capacities and cost / revenue figures in this DFS are presented as 20 year 
averages.  Key operating parameters are presented in Table 1.4.

1.7 Mining Activity Detail 

Mining activity is planned on a relatively small scale, based on the size of the overall 
operation.  The resource is surface mineable, employing open cut mining techniques in 
two separate pits.  A contractor will be employed for the mining earthworks and will be 
responsible for the provision of excavation including grade management, pit and ramp 
formation and haul road and dump management.  The contractor will employ a hydraulic 
excavator to remove overburden and expose the top of the mineralisation.  All in-pit 
material has been identified as free dig material, and no drilling and blasting is planned or 
required.  Dozer assist will be used to excavate the limonite in flitches of 2.5 m, with 
thinner lenses being mined as grade control dictates.  Approximately 75,000 tonnes of 
ROM feed will be won from the two pits each year, utilising a campaign mining schedule, 
approximately three to four times annually.  From these campaigns, mill feed ore will be 
mined, stockpiled and covered on a ROM pad adjacent to the process plant, on an as 
required basis. 

Waste material will be hauled to the site infrastructure work as required, including surface 
ponds, roads, and the Residue Storage Facility (tailings pond).  Mineralised waste will be 
deposited on a dedicated mineralised waste dump. 

1.8 Process Plant Detail 

While the project resource contains both limonite and saprolite resource material, the DFS 
contemplates a process plant that will only receive limonite mill feed.  Limonite resources 
sit above saprolite in the deposit, are more heavily weathered, and exhibit significantly 
higher scandium grades.  Limonite tends to require more vigorous process inputs to 
liberate scandium than saprolites.  Process test work suggests that autoclave systems 
work well on either resource type, but specific process parameters are different enough to 
prevent optimisation of a mill feed that is a mix of the two types.   Best results would 
require distinct process runs to optimise recovery from each ore type.   

While the Company has done work on optimum recovery of scandium from saprolite 
resources, that work is not a part of this DFS.  The mine plan and project design has been 
careful not to sterilise or in any way prevent the Company from utilising the deeper 
saprolite resources at some point in the future. 

The process flowsheet can be summarised by the following sequential activities / circuits: 

 Recovery of ore from mined stockpiles using a front end loader. 

 De-agglomeration of the ore in a drum scrubber. 

 Grinding the ore using a closed circuit ball mill to a P80 of 75µm. 

 Thickening of ground ore to 38% solids. 

 High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) of ore through a continuous 3-stage 
preheat, autoclave, 3-stage letdown circuit.

1.9 Project Infrastructure 

The general infrastructure in the vicinity of the project site is good.  The town of Nyngan is 
close enough and large enough to represent a suitable location for staff / families.  The 
Barrier Highway runs directly past the project, within 5 km of the plant site.  Adequate 
water supply is available for the project via raw water supply line/s, which are ultimately 
sourced from the Burrendong Dam, located 230 kms to the southeast.  This water pipeline 
is owned and operated by the water board at Cobar, and runs alongside the Barrier 
Highway, close to site.  Grid electrical power, in the form of separate 132kV, 66kV and 
33kV lines, all run within 5 km of the site.  This existing general infrastructure is available 
to the project, but specific additional site infrastructure will need to be built, including: 

 An all-weather unsealed two lane access road from the Barrier Highway to the 
plant site, approximately 5 km in length. 

 An all-weather unsealed haul road between the mine and the process plant. 

 Connection from the existing 33kV overhead powerline running adjacent to the 
Barrier Highway to the plant site. 

 A fibre-optic network within the process plant for communications with connection 
to the National Broadband Network via high speed wireless link. 

 Raw water supply line to the plant site connected to the existing Cobar Water 
Board supply lines running adjacent to the Barrier Highway. 

 A residue storage facility (RSF) comprising a HDPE lined, dual cell, paddock 
style facility with a perimeter embankment around all sides of the facility 
constructed in stages over the life of the project. 

 An external decant pond to allow supernatant water to be kept at a minimum 
practical level in the RSF. 

 An evaporation pond to dispose of high salt streams from the process plant. 

 A raw water storage pond with 15 ML storage capacity. 

 A process plant area event pond to capture any spills or run-off from the process 
plant area. 

 A sediment pond for the process plant and RSF areas to capture run-off. 

 A sediment pond for the mining area to capture run-off. 

 A flood protection bund / levee bank around the process plant, RSF area and 
mining area to prevent external floodwater ingress.

 Plant site buildings and facilities, which will include an administration building, 
carpark, process plant laboratory, a combined workshop / warehouse building a 
combined electrical switchroom / control room, and a covered reagent storage 
facility. 

A dedicated accommodation camp will not be constructed for either the construction or 
operational phases of the project.  Use will be made of existing facilities in the surrounding 
area. 

1.10 Environmental Studies, Social or Community Impact 

The results of the environmental studies may be summarised as follows. 

 Air quality:  No significant impacts are expected.  Mining / plant operations will 
be required to ensure suitable emissions and dust control standards are met. 

 Biodiversity:  No significant impacts are expected.  Management has committed 
to measures in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Biodiversity 
Offset Strategy, incorporating a Biodiversity Offset Area of 64hectares. 

 Surface water:  No significant impacts are expected. Management has 
committed in the EIS to operating a zero-discharge site, and to the following 
actions addressing surface water quality and containment: 

- the active areas of the Project Site are bunded to exclude a 1 in 1000 
year ARI rainfall / flood event 

- all water containing chemicals or salt is retained and used for processing 
operations or evaporated from the Evaporation Pond 

- all water containing suspended sediment is captured and, if discharge is 
required, tested prior to discharge. 

 Traffic and transportation:  No significant impacts are expected.   Management 
has committed in the EIS to construct the Site Access Road and Intersection to 
the relevant standards, and to implement measures to monitor and manage 
driver fatigue. 

No other environmental impacts of significance have been identified. 

1.11 Project Permitting Requirements 

The Proposal would require the following permits, consents, leases, licences and 
approvals: 

 Development Consent under Division 4.1 of the Environmental Planning and 
Assessment Act 1979. 



NYNGAN SCANDIUM PROJECT

Page 1.12 

May 2016 
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd 

 An Environment Protection Licence under Section 47 of the Protection of the 
Environment Operations Act 1997. 

 A Mining Lease under the Mining Act 1992. 

 A Water Supply Works and Use Approval and Water Access Licence issued by 
the DPI – Water under the Water Management Act 2000. 

 A Section 138 Permit under the Roads Act 1993. 

 An approval from the NSW Dams Safety Committee for the design and 
construction of the Residue Storage Facility, Evaporation Pond and External 
Decant Pond. 

 A high voltage connection agreement under the Electricity Supply Act 1995. 

 A range of approvals / construction certificates for infrastructure within the Project 
Site. 

Because the Project capital cost exceeds A$30M, it is considered a 'State Significant 
Development", as defined by Schedule 1 of the State Environmental Planning Policy for 
NSW.  The Minister for the NSW Department of Planning and Environment holds approval 
authority to grant a Development Consent on the Project, based on a project-specific 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which has been filed in April 2016.  Development 
Consent, along with various required permits and rights, represent a multi-agency process 
which supports the granting of a Mining Lease from the Division of Resources and Energy 
(Department of Industry).  That said, the attitudes and support of the local Nyngan 
community to the project are very important, and will be considered by all decision makers 
in this process.  A range of community and government agency consultations has been 
undertaken by the Company, at both State and local levels, including the first of several 
planned public town hall meetings in the town of Nyngan.  No significant issues or 
objections have been identified during the consultation process to date. 

1.12 Mine Closure Requirements 

The DFS presents a 20 year project plan which utilises only a portion of the total resource, 
in fact less than 20% of the limonite resource and 10% of the entire resource.  It is likely 
that the project will have an option to extend and not close in year 21, 2038, based on 
commercial circumstances at that time, but not based on resource constraints. 

The DFS assumes the Residue Storage Facility will be fully rehabilitated in 2038  
(year 21), because it has reached a practical size limit by that point in time.  The 
estimated cost of that work is US$5.2M, including a 15% contingency.  No other 
reclamation expenditure has been included in the project cash flow. 

The EIS does contemplate a list of actions, in the event the project is closed after 20 years 
operation.  Those actions include fencing mine pits, reclaiming some but not all of the 
water catchment facilities, clearing off the process plant and buildings in the event another

industrial use is not found at that time, removing levee bunds on the site, and of course a 
similar reclamation of the Residue Storage Facility (tailings pond) to that contemplated in 
the DFS.  The EIS does contemplate that the event storage pond, a sediment pond and 
the access road be left in place, but the area would be left suitable either as an industrial 
site, or for resumption of agricultural activity, which is its current use today 

1.13 Key Research and Investigations 

Successful development, operation and realisation of financial returns from this Project 
will depend specifically on execution in two key areas of the development plan:   

 Achieve processing plant targets to separate scandium from the resource within 
the financial and functional parameters outlined in the plant design, and  

 Establish markets for scandium oxide which are not possible to empirically 
demonstrate in today's supply-limited marketplace. 

The Company has invested in significant investigations in both of these areas. 

Process Flowsheets 

Final DFS process plant flow sheets have been based on metallurgical test work on 
several different flow sheet options, involving multiple independent testing facilities to seek 
and verify operating parameters that are viable and effective.  Key metallurgical 
laboratories and tasks include:  

 SGS Lakefield (Canada).  High pressure acid leaching test work was conducted 
on limonite, saprolite and combinations of the two, sourced from the Nyngan 
laterite deposit, using both 2 L and 20 L batch autoclaves.  Multiple test programs 
from 2011 to present.  This group also conducted work on the chemistry and 
settling properties of leach residue before and after neutralisation. 

 Hazen Research (Colorado). Conducted extensive test work on an acid-bake 
roasting process followed by water leaching.  While the acid-bake work was not 
relevant to this report, Hazen did produce process solutions for subsequent 
solvent extraction and scandium recovery test work.  This included a continuous 
solvent extraction pilot plant campaign which formed the basis of subsequent SX 
test work at Nagrom Pty Ltd (Brisbane).  Hazen also conducted pioneering work 
on the precipitation of scandium oxalate from solution using oxalic acid. 

 CSIRO (Australia).  This Australian governmental R&D group conducted test 
work on the acid bake process to produce solutions for subsequent downstream 
processing.  They also conducted solvent extraction test work on a range of 
organic extractants, and examined the oxalate precipitation process.  This formed 
the basis for subsequent test work at Nagrom Pty Ltd (Brisbane).

 Nagrom Pty Ltd. (Brisbane).  Laboratory conducted solvent extraction test work, 
both on a batch basis and a semi-continuous basis with laboratory scale mixer 
settler units using a synthetic feed solution.  The loaded strip liquor from the 
solvent extraction pilot plant was used for scandium oxalate precipitation and 
calcination trials.  The procedures to produce 99.9% scandium oxide were 
developed during this campaign, and in fact produced 99.87% oxide in a single 
pass system. 

Extensive use was made METSIM process software modelling capability in this DFS, as 
was done in the PEA in 2014.  METSIM was applied as a tool to validate various process 
variants and options, all based on actual independent test work results that SCY was able 
to provide from prior studies.  The final METSIM result on the DFS was a fully convergent 
model, with various recycle and bleed streams considered and quantified, and included a 
mass and water balance for the process.  From these quantities, a mechanical equipment 
list compliant with the mass balance was produced as the basis for capital cost estimation.  
The model also provided reagent and consumable quantities that were used as the basis 
for the operating cost determination.  The model also provided guidance for test work 
solutions where synthetic solutions were used. 

Marketing Scandium Oxide 

The Company has signed a three year off-take agreement with a knowledgeable 
aluminum alloy group, intent on making master alloy and aluminum alloys with scandium.  
This off-take is the only known signed off-take in the market presently.  The Company has 
also commissioned an independent marketing study on the ten year supply / demand 
outlook for scandium (the Outlook), and likely pricing trends during that timeframe - 2016 
to 2026.  While the Company considers the Outlook to be confidential, and has no intent 
to release the document to the public, Lycopodium has reviewed the contained price 
forecast and supply / demand projections and confirms it is consistent with the sales and 
marketing objectives presented in this DFS.  Some key details of this marketing study are 
specifically identified in Chapter 19 (Marketing) in this Technical Report. 

1.14 Project Capital Cost 

The capital cost estimate for the Project is US$87.1M.  The capital cost estimate is 
provided at an accuracy level of +15%/-5%.  A summary of the initial capital estimate is 
shown in Table 1.5.

Table 1.5 Total Project Initial Capital Cost 

 

1.15 Project Operating Cost 

Operating costs were estimated annually, based on the quantity of mill feed delivered by 
the mining plan to the processing plant. 

Mining costs were based on contractor bids, although activity rates remained fixed 
throughout the 20 year project timeframe.  Mining costs showed variation based on 
tonnage delivered, substantial annual waste removal variances, haul distances, and pit 
depth as mining advanced over the term of the project.  Mining costs also included both a 
fixed and an ancillary component of cost which did not vary by mine output.  The mine 
plan builds a considerable low grade mill feed stockpile of 620,000 t over the 20 year mine 
life.  This resource material is above the 100ppm economic cut-off value and is stored for 
future processing.  The costs of this stockpiled resource material is expensed through 
costs and cash flow in the timeframe costs are incurred. 

Plant operating costs also varied by year, due to small changes in annual mill feed 
quantities beginning in 2020 (year 3).  Processing plant costs were segregated into fixed 
and variable components.  The variation in annual plant feed was the primary cause for 
annual differences in processing plant costs. 

The fixed versus variable cost components did affect sensitivity analysis calculations.  
They were also important in the first two years of partial production, in the ramp-up to 
nameplate capacity.   

The ramp-up provided for 35% of nameplate throughput (26,250 tonnes) in production 
year 1 (2018) and 80% of nameplate throughput (60,000 tonnes) in production year 2 
(2019).  The respective scandium oxide product output figures during those years was

13,300 kg and 30,900 kg, respectively.  This two year ramp-up to nameplate capacity was 
determined based on the commissioning experience of other HPAL plants of similar 
general design, built and brought online in the last 15 years.  All of these benchmarking 
examples were nickel plants processing lateritic ores, all but one were initial installations, 
and all were of much bigger size than the Nyngan processing plant. 

Recognising the year by year variation in output and costs for the processing plant, 
operating costs have been presented throughout this Technical Report on a 20 year 
average basis.  The averages absorb the effects of the ramp-up period, and account for 
the difference in average throughputs compared to nameplate capacities.  That 
comparison is illustrated in Table 1.6.

1.16 Sensitivities to Finance and Operating Variances 

The project is more sensitive to changes in product prices and exchange rates than to 
most other 10% variances.  In Table 1.8, dramatically lower pricing is explored, showing 
the Project maintains a minimum 15% IRR on a 40% price shortfall.  However, a standard 
10% pricing variation to US$1,800 /kg would reduce IRR to 29.0%.  Similarly, for a change 
in the Australian exchange rate assumption by 10% unfavorable to US$0.77, the IRR falls 
to 29.6%.  A 10% loss in recoveries represents a particularly serious impost on any mining 
operation and this plant is no exception, where a drop to 75% recoveries decreases the 
IRR to 28.8%.  Generally, these significant negative variations do not in any case 
represent a severe degradation to the return on capital for the project.

1.17 Interpretation and Conclusions 

This Technical Report details the engineering and study work undertaken to apply 
continuous high pressure acid leaching of the Nyngan scandium resource and subsequent 
processing to produce a scandium oxide product.  The basis for the design generally 
follows the path of established nickel laterite plants.  That said, this plant design and 
flowsheet are purpose-built by Lycopodium and Altrius Engineering Services to address 
the unique differences presented by scandium, as directed by dedicated metallurgical test 
work in a number of key areas.  The batch flowsheet design used in the PEA for this 
project has been superseded and clearly improved by the continuous system in this DFS.  
Overall scandium recovery levels are acceptable, and product purity has increased 
substantially, without the need for multiple purification steps to meet the highest grades 
demanded in the marketplace. 

Resource definition is at a suitable level for study work at this accuracy level.  The first 
Reserve has been established on the resource as well.  While the current process plant 
design is suitable for the limonite portion of the resource only, this fact highlights the level 
of flowsheet tuning that has been applied in this Technical Report.  The 20-year mine plan 
is predominantly within limonite resource at the measured category, and that measured 
resource is twice the size needed to complete a 20 year project at current design 
volumes.

The financial model includes provisions for sustaining costs, owner's costs, working 
capital, and a significant closure cost allowance. 

The US$2,000 /kg sale price for scandium oxide that has been used is conservative, 
based on current prices.  Market discussions with potential end users has indicated that it 
is likely that the presence of a large, reliable producer in a stable Western democracy will 
enable an increase in scandium use without a significant price reduction.  The scandium 
pricing and demand assumptions in this Technical Report are supported by an 
independently prepared marketing study, researched by authors with significant career 
experience in the aluminium alloy industry. 

The financial returns on the Project indicate a positive, development opportunity.  The 
short payback period (3.3 years) and ability to service debt should support leverage 
financing, and the underlying profitability, the possibility of expansion based on un-
assigned resources, and a nascent market for scandium should be attractive to equity 
investors. 

1.18 Recommendations 

The Project demonstrates a viable process flow sheet, and modelled economic analysis 
has been shown at the DFS level to be attractive.  The conclusions of the Technical 
Report are positive, and the recommendation is therefore to proceed to project finance 
and execution. 

Marketing efforts should be continued with the goal of developing further offtake 
arrangements  

Detailed engineering should be initiated as soon as practicable on the continuous 
autoclave system with a preferred supplier, to ensure proper and optimal design 
parameters and manage delivery timing on this long-lead key plant component. 

In parallel with early detailed engineering, some additional metallurgical test work is 
recommended in order to further optimise the processing flowsheet and operating 
conditions.

2.4 Definitions  

Certain key definitions applied in this Technical Report are defined in the CIM Definition 
Standards, as most recently updated on 10 May 2014.  Those CIM definitions are as 
follows: 

Mineral Resource 

Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into 
Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.  An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower 
level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource.  An Indicated 
Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but 
has a lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest 
in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are 
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. 

The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a 
Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence 
and knowledge, including sampling.

NOTE:  Material of economic interest refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, 
or natural solid fossilised organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and 
industrial minerals. 

The term Mineral Resource covers mineralisation and natural material of intrinsic 
economic interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and 
sampling and within which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the 
consideration and application of Modifying Factors.  The phrase 'reasonable prospects 
for eventual economic extraction' implies a judgment by the Qualified Person in respect 
of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic 
extraction.  The Qualified Person should consider and clearly state the basis for 
determining that the material has reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction.  Assumptions should include estimates of cut-off grade and geological 
continuity at the selected cut-off, metallurgical recovery, smelter payments, commodity 
price or product value, mining and processing method and mining, processing and 
general and administrative costs.  The Qualified Person should state if the assessment is 
based on any direct evidence and testing. 

Interpretation of the word 'eventual' in this context may vary depending on the commodity 
or mineral involved.  For example, for some coal, iron, potash deposits and other bulk 
minerals or commodities, it may be reasonable to envisage 'eventual economic 
extraction' as covering time periods in excess of 50 years.  However, for many gold 
deposits, application of the concept would normally be restricted to perhaps 10 to 15 
years, and frequently to much shorter periods of time. 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling.  
Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality 
continuity. 

An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an 
Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve.  It is 
reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded 
to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 

NOTE:  An Inferred Mineral Resource is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  Inferred Mineral Resources must not be 
included in the economic analysis, production schedules, or estimated mine life in 
publicly disclosed Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and 
cash flow models of developed mines.  Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in 
economic studies as provided under NI 43-101. 

There may be circumstances, where appropriate sampling, testing, and other 
measurements are sufficient to demonstrate data integrity, geological and  
grade / quality continuity of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource, however,

quality assurance and quality control or other information may not meet all industry 
norms for the disclosure of an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource.  Under these 
circumstances, it may be reasonable for the Qualified Person to report an Inferred 
Mineral Resource if the Qualified Person has taken steps to verify the information 
meets the requirements of an Inferred Mineral Resource. 

Indicated Mineral Resource 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient 
confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, 
sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity 
between points of observation. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a 
Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 

NOTE:  Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the 
Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as 
to allow confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume 
the continuity of mineralisation.  The Qualified Person must recognise the importance 
of the Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of 
the project.  An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support 
a Pre-Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions. 

Measured Mineral Resource 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed 
mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and 
testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between 
points of observation. 

A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to 
either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource.  It may be 
converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 

NOTE:  Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as 
a Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity 
and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade or quality of the 
mineralisation can be estimated to within close limits, and that variation from the 
estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability of the deposit.  This

category requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and 
controls of the mineral deposit. 

Modifying Factors 

Modifying Factors are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral 
Reserves.  These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, 
infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. 

Mineral Reserve 

Mineral Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable 
Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral Reserves.  A Probable Mineral Reserve has a 
lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated 
Mineral Resource.  It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may 
occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at  
Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying 
Factors.  Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could 
reasonably be justified. 

The reference point at which Mineral Reserves are defined, usually the point where the 
ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated.  It is important that, in all 
situations where the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a 
clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is 
being reported. 

The public disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a Pre-Feasibility 
Study or Feasibility Study. 

NOTE:  Mineral Reserves are those parts of Mineral Resources which, after the 
application of all mining factors, result in an estimated tonnage and grade which, in the 
opinion of the Qualified Person(s) making the estimates, is the basis of an economically 
viable project after taking account of all relevant Modifying Factors.  Mineral Reserves are 
inclusive of diluting material that will be mined in conjunction with the Mineral Reserves 
and delivered to the treatment plant or equivalent facility.  The term 'Mineral Reserve' 
need not necessarily signify that extraction facilities are in place or operative or that all 
governmental approvals have been received.  It does signify that there are reasonable 
expectations of such approvals. 

'Reference Point' refers to the mining or process point at which the Qualified Person 
prepares a Mineral Reserve.  For example, most metal deposits disclose mineral 
reserves with a "mill feed" reference point.  In these cases, reserves are reported as 
mined ore delivered to the plant and do not include reductions attributed to anticipated 
plant losses.  In contrast, coal reserves have traditionally been reported as tonnes of 
"clean coal".  In this coal example, reserves are reported as a "saleable product"

reference point and include reductions for plant yield (recovery).  The Qualified Person 
must clearly state the 'reference point' used in the Mineral Reserve estimate. 

Probable Mineral Reserve 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in 
some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.  The confidence in the Modifying 
Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven 
Mineral Reserve. 

NOTE:  The Qualified Person(s) may elect to convert Measured Mineral Resources to 
Probable Mineral Reserves if the confidence in the Modifying Factors is lower than 
that applied to a Proven Mineral Reserve.  Probable Mineral Reserve estimates must 
be demonstrated to be economic, at the time of reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility 
Study. 

Proven Mineral Reserve (Proved Mineral Reserve) 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral 
Resource.  A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the 
Modifying Factors. 

NOTE:  Application of the Proven Mineral Reserve category implies that the Qualified 
Person has the highest degree of confidence in the estimate with the consequent 
expectation in the minds of the readers of the report.  The term should be restricted to that 
part of the deposit where production planning is taking place and for which any 
variation in the estimate would not significantly affect the potential economic viability of 
the deposit.  Proven Mineral Reserve estimates must be demonstrated to be economic, 
at the time of reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study.  Within the CIM Definition 
standards the term Proved Mineral Reserve is an equivalent term to a Proven Mineral 
Reserve. 

Feasibility Study 

A Feasibility Study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected 
development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments 
of applicable Modifying Factors together with any other relevant operational factors and 
detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that 
extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable).  The results of the study may 
reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to 
proceed with, or finance, the development of the project.  The confidence level of the 
study will be higher than that of a Pre-Feasibility Study. 

The term proponent captures issuers who may finance a project without using traditional 
financial institutions.  In these cases, the technical and economic confidence of the 
Feasibility Study is equivalent to that required by a financial institution.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

3.1 Introduction 

The QP authors have relied on the environmental work undertaken by R.W. Corkery of 
Orange, NSW, Australia, for EMC Mining Australia Pty Ltd, and Scandium International 
Mining Corp, and the lack of discovery of any serious archaeological or social limitations 
to property development for mining or mineral processing.  The authors are aware of the 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) document, written and compiled by R.W. Corkery, 
and recently filed with the NSW Department of Planning and Development, in April 2016.  
The authors are familiar with the conclusions of the EIS, in in certain cases have been 
involved with and contributed to or reviewed its contents in detail.  The EIS document is 
further supported by a Specialist Consultants Study Compendium, representing various 
independent environmental specialist reviews of specific elements of the Nyngan property 
development plan.   

The conclusions of the EIS state the following: 

"In light of the conclusions included throughout this Environmental Impact 
Statement, it is assessed that the Proposal could be constructed and operated in 
a manner that would satisfy all relevant statutory goals and criteria, 
environmental objectives and reasonable community expectations." 

The QP authors have, with respect to this Technical Report, relied on the work and 
conclusions contained in the EIS with regard to all environmental matters, but most 
specifically Chapters 1 (Executive Summary), 18 (Project Infrastructure) and 20 
(Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social and Community Impact).

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Property Location 

The Nyngan scandium deposit lies 20 km west-southwest of the town of Nyngan, New 
South Wales (NSW), approximately 450 km northwest of Sydney.  The property is 5 km 
southeast of the hamlet of Miandetta, off the Barrier Highway that connects Nyngan to 
Cobar as shown schematically in Figure 4.1. 

Figure 4.1 Location of Nyngan Scandium Property 

 
 

The drive from the town of Nyngan to the property takes approximately 20 minutes.  The 
area can be reached via the paved Barrier Highway and Gilgai Road which allow year 
round access, but access to the site itself is along clay farm tracks making access in wet 
conditions difficult.  Several of the Crown Roads in the area are in the process of being 
closed or offered for sale, and one in particular would make a superior choice to provide

access to the property directly from the highway, with minimum impact on local land 
owners.  Discussions on securing this asset are currently underway. 

The resource site is located at geographic coordinates MGA zone 55, GDA 94, Latitude – 
31.6130S, Longitude 146.9306E, Map Sheets 1:250k – Cobar (SH/55-14) and 1:100k 
Hermidale (8234). 

4.2 Mineral Titles 

The scandium resource is held under the mineral title – Exploration Licence (EL) No. 8316 
(Block Number 3132, units d, e, j, k and Block No. 3133, unit f) EL 8316 is surrounded by 
two other titles held by EMC Metals Australia Pty. Ltd. (EMC-A).  EL- 6096 (five units) and 
ELA (application for an exploration licence) - 5232 (six units).  EMC-A also holds 
Exploration Licence 7977 at Honeybugle, 25 kms to the south.  Each of the EL's and the 
ELA are backed by a A$10,000 environmental bond, in a form of a cash collateralised 
security deposit with the Department of Industry and Trade, NSW.  They also have 
minimum annual spend requirements.  The exploration tenements are not subject to any 
other environmental liabilities, other than to reclaim any drilling impacts on the land, and 
safely reclaim all drill holes. 

The combined area of the exploration tenements covering the Nyngan scandium project is 
almost 50 square km.  The main resource area (at a lower cut-off of 100 ppm Sc) covers 
approximately 2.0 square km. 

The Exploration Licences allow the licence holder to conduct exploration on private land 
(with landowner consents and signed compensation agreements in place) and public 
lands not including wildlife reserves, heritage areas, Nature Reserves or National Parks.  
The scandium resource is fully enclosed on private agricultural land. 

The local administrative body with property taxation jurisdiction is the Bogan Shire 
Council, Nyngan, NSW.  Annual property rates, subject to annual assessment, are A$828 
and payable to the Bogan Shire Council Offices on or before 31 August each year. 

The freehold property boundaries are defined by standard land survey techniques 
undertaken by the Lands Department and currently presented in the form of Cadastral 
Deposited Plans (DP) and Lots.  The total surface (freehold) ownership, directly on top of 
the resource, is 800 acres, and covers approximately 70% of the resource and 100% of 
the anticipated footprint of combined planned mining areas and processing facilities.  The 
defined Sc resource lies within Lot 1 and Lot 7, DP 752 879.  EMC-A is currently 
negotiating with a landowner for purchase of relevant parts of Lot 1.

In order to develop the property into a mining operation, EMC-A must seek and be 
granted a series of approvals and operating licenses, most significantly a Mining Lease 
(ML) from the NSW Division of Resources and Energy (Department of Industry), and a 
Development Consent from the Minister of the Department of Planning and Environment. 

The Nyngan Project qualifies as a State Significant Development, as defined by  
Schedule 1 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (State and Regional Development) 
2011.  As a State Significant Development (>A$30M capex), operating approvals are 
reviewed, granted, and managed by multiple governmental agencies, coordinated by the 
Minister of the Department of Planning and Environment. 

This process begins with the submission of a completed Environmental Impact Study 
(EIS), which is considered the foundation document for any developer considering a 
mining project in NSW.  The EIS is submitted to the Department of Planning and 
Environment, along with a request for a Development Consent.  The EIS is reviewed for 
adequacy, and placed on public exhibition, for comment and scrutiny for 30 to 60 days, 
while simultaneously undergoing multi-agency review and consideration.

Once the Development Consent is granted, there are a number of operating licenses and 
approvals that are required from various regulatory agencies to construct and operate a 
mining operation in NSW. 

The key license approvals are: 

 An Environment Protection Licence. 

 A Mining Lease. 

 Water Supply Works and Use Approval and Water Access Licence. 

 A Section 138 Permit issued by the Bogan Shire Council, for construction of the 
intersection of the Site Access Road and Gilgai Road. 

 An approval from the NSW Dams Safety Committee for the design and 
construction of the Residue Storage Facility. 

 A high voltage connection agreement with Essential Energy. 

The timeframe for completion of these reviews and granting of licenses is not fixed, and is 
dependent on the results of the adequacy review of the EIS including the extent of the 
questions that may arise from the project review, and the available resources in 
government to address the review itself.  General estimates of the overall development 
review and approval process time frame range from six to nine months, with some 
proposals taking longer, particularly larger proposals, or proposals with more community 
and environmental impacts to consider.  With completion of all governmental reviews and 
approvals, the Project can be expected to receive operating rights which encompass a 
project footprint that corresponds to the resource and process plant area. 

The ML has a two-year expiry on advancement to operations, in that EMC-A has two 
years from ML grant to initiate plant and mine construction. 

The Nyngan property is subject to five separate royalty agreements, four based on 
revenue and one based on pre-tax profit.  The details on these royalties are as follows: 

 Revenue-Based Royalties, Levied on Revenue (less freight): 

- Jervois Mining Limited Royalty.  1.7% of actual sales prices on 
oxide, subject to a 10 tpy minimum once production commences, 
and a 12 year time period to expiry. 

- Lenders Royalty.  0.2% of actual sales prices on oxide, subject to a 
cap of US$370,000 total payout, expected to be approximately 2.5 
years of production.

- New South Wales Mineral Royalty.  4% on actual sales prices, but 
refining, processing, and freight costs may be deductible for 
calculation of royalty payable.  The royalty runs in perpetuity. 

- Jennings Royalty.  A 0.7% royalty payable on actual sales prices of 
scandium products or other mineral products, net of any freight 
costs.  The royalty runs in perpetuity. 

 NPI's – Net Profit Royalties, levied on Pre-Tax Income: 

- Plumbum & Canateal Royalty.  1.5% on actual sales prices, but all 
costs of production are allowable deductions, so this is a percentage 
on earnings before tax.  The royalty runs in perpetuity. 

The property does not have any existing environmental liabilities that would burden the 
project, either in operation or in closure.  Other sections of this report do address 
environmental flora and fauna matters and the Company's plans on closure and salvage 
of site facilities and assets at the end of mine life. 

No other significant factors are known that would affect access, title or the right or ability 
to perform work on the property at this time.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The topography is mildly undulating to flat elevated plateaus at an average elevation of 
173 m above sea level.  The area is overlain with alluvial red clays which display  
'Gilgai-type' swelling characteristics. 

Historically the area was predominantly dry eucalypt and native pine woodland.  Large 
areas of original woodlands have been permanently altered through the removal of pine 
for timber, the clearing of trees and shrubs for grazing by livestock and the invasion of 
woody weeds. 

5.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 

The Nyngan area climate is generally described as sub-arid.  The highest mean summer 
temperatures of 34°C usually occur in January.  Winter mean minimum temperatures of 
16°C typically are recorded in July.  In summer, temperatures can reach 40°C, while 
winter low temperatures can occasionally reach 0°C during night time.  These extremes 
are relatively rare, and would pose no limitations on mining or processing operations. 

The mean maximum (summer) rainfall of 51 mm occurs in January and the mean (winter) 
rainfall minimum of 27 mm in September.  Nyngan is generally under a sub-tropical to 
tropical influence from the north of the continent.  The operating season for a mining 
operation can be all year round, provided all-weather gravel roads with appropriate 
drainage are constructed for access. 

5.3 Access to Property 

The town of Nyngan, New South Wales (NSW) lies on the Mitchell Highway, northwest of 
Dubbo, which is the largest regional community in proximity to the project area.  To reach 
EMC's Nyngan property from the town of Nyngan, the most direct route is via the Barrier 
Highway, which intersects the Mitchell Highway at the western end of the town of Nyngan.  
The hamlet of Miandetta lies approximately 22 kms from Nyngan, along the Barrier 
Highway.  At Miandetta, the highway intersects Gilgai Road.  The Nyngan property is 
approximately 5 km south west on the Gilgai Road (paved), accessible through private 
roads and Crown roads, which are all weather roads but not paved.  The property is not 
visible from the Gilgai Road. 

5.4 Surface Rights 

EMC-A has purchased approximately 800 acres of land (freehold) which encompasses 
most of the scandium resource on the property.  The surface rights are managed by 
Hetherington Exploitation and Mining Title Services Pty. Ltd., Sydney, NSW on behalf of 
EMC-A.

5.4.1 Access Roads and Transportation 

The township of Nyngan is accessed by the Barrier and Mitchell Highways, both paved all-
weather inter-State two lane highways.  There is a single track rail line used for hauling 
grain and sulphide concentrates from mines at Cobar that runs through Nyngan to the 
eastern seaboard ports, and past the Nyngan property, approximately 5 km from the 
resource area. 

5.4.2 Power Supply 

The closest major electricity substation is located in the regional city of Dubbo, NSW, 
approximately 170 km from the Nyngan property.  A high voltage power line (132 kV) runs 
parallel to the Barrier Highway from Nyngan to Cobar, and passes within 4 km of the 
resource area.  Domestic power lines also run along the Gilgai Road. 

The largest solar farm in Australia has recently been constructed in the area as well.  The 
owner and operator, AGL (ASX Ticker:AGK) has completed construction of a 102 MW 
fixed (non-tracking) solar photovoltaic installation directly adjacent to the Barrier Highway, 
approximately 10 km from Nyngan and 20 km from the Nyngan property.  The facility was 
completed in mid 2015, and formally opened in January 2016.  The installation will 
generate 360,000 MWh of electric power per year, and include a transformer station to tie 
directly into the existing 132 kV Nyngan-Cobar high voltage transmission line.  

5.4.3 Town of Nyngan 

The town of Nyngan has a population of 2,073 (shire population 3,076), and has a 
regional hospital, primary through tertiary school systems and several restaurants and 
hotels, although rooms are not plentiful.  The town hosts the local governmental offices of 
the Bogan Shire, and caters to the road traffic travelling between Cobar and Dubbo.  It is 
estimated that approximately 12 to 20% of the population either works or services mining 
projects in the area.  The primary regional industry is agriculture, with wheat the 
predominant crop. 

The AGL solar construction project has brought over 300 local jobs to the community, and 
required the company to construct a mess / accommodation facility to support the project 
during construction and commissioning.   

Travel times by car from the town of Nyngan to both Dubbo and Cobar are each about  
1.5 hours.  Dubbo's population is about 40,000, is considered the crossroads of NSW, and 
supports a regional population of over 130,000.  Cobar is slightly larger than Nyngan 
(town population estimate 3,817, shire 4,700) and is both an historic and current mining 
community with copper-lead-zinc and gold mining that began in the 1880s.

5.4.4 Water Supply 

The project will require almost 200 mega-litres (ML) of water per annum.  This water can 
be sourced from two possible areas: 

1. Underground water from the Lachlan Fold Belt. 

2. From an existing storage reservoir (Burrendong Dam on the Macquarie River). 

EMC-A plans to apply for an allocation from the Burrendong Dam.  Water is released from 
the dam and flows to the township of Nyngan via the Macquarie River, a 68 km irrigation 
channel and finally into the Bogan River near Nyngan.  A pumping station then pumps the 
water via two existing parallel pipelines which supply Cobar some 120 km away.  These 
pipelines follow the Barrier Highway and are within 5 km of the Nyngan Project.  A modest 
off-take would be required to provide water to the project. 

5.4.5 Port 

The nearest port facility is at Newcastle, NSW, located approximately 500 km from the 
property via the paved State highway system, capable of transporting heavy equipment to 
site, and supporting continuous all-weather transport of process inputs for the project. 

5.4.6 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 

There are currently no buildings or ancillary facilities on the site. 

5.4.7 Manpower 

Adequate skilled labour for technical and hourly staff is available in Nyngan, Cobar and 
other regional communities.  The Nyngan community has the room and infrastructure in 
place to expand to meet the demands of growing local business, although at present there 
is not a ready supply of housing available for rent or purchase.  The major solar project 
recently constructed involved as many as 300 construction staff.  A mining project such as 
Nyngan Scandium would likely require a similar solution, on a much smaller scale during 
construction, and the solar project facility may represent a timing opportunity for EMC-A to 
use established facilities after completion of that project.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Origins of the Name 'Gilgai' 

The Nyngan scandium property had been commonly also known as the Gilgai scandium 
property, as it was referred to during numerous drilling phases and owners through the 
1980s and 1990s.  The word is Aboriginal in origin, and means 'small water hole'.  Gilgais 
form where heavily clayed soils swell and crack, creating shallow depressions that capture 
and retain water in small pools.  Gilgais are further encouraged by areas with pronounced 
wet and dry seasons, and were important water sources for native Australians, range 
animals, and early pastoral farmers and graziers. 

The prospect was named by M. Rangott in 1987, and came from the Parish of Gilgai, 
County of Flinders, as the prospect lies within that Parish.  The name was later applied by 
geologists and exploration groups to the significant local buried geologic formation, known 
as the Gilgai Complex, a zoned Alaskan-type intrusive that is host to nickel, cobalt, 
platinum and scandium. 

EMC refers to the property as either the Nyngan scandium property or the Nyngan 
Scandium Project, reserving the Gilgai name as a title for the broad geologic formation 
associated with the property and the scandium resource. 

6.2 Past Exploration and Development 

The first systematic exploration in the region was by Selection Trust in the late 1970s, 
targeting base metal and gold mineralisation.  Work included mapping, rock chip sampling 
and the drilling of seven percussion drill holes.  The results returned were not deemed 
encouraging by Selection Trust, however values of up to 1.16% nickel were reported from 
nearby alpine serpentinites. 

North Broken Hill Ltd. took up a number of tenements in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
initially to look for tin, but later for ultramafic sulphide mineralisation.  To the south of the 
Nyngan property, in the Honeybugle area, they conducted regional exploration including 
the drilling of 52 auger holes (287 m) on Pangee Road and at the Pangee Road Pits. 

Lachlan Resources N.L., as manager of the "Platsearch Group" explored for PGE 
mineralisation in the late 1980s, relinquishing the ground in 1993.  Airborne and ground 
magnetic surveys were used to locate and delineate the intrusive "Alaskan-style" 
ultramafic complexes considered to be prospective for PGE mineralisation, modelled 
initially on the platinum bearing Tout (Syerston) intrusive complex near Fifield, then on the 
Kars Complex near Condobolin.  Broad-spaced rotary air-blast (RAB) drilling identified a 
platiniferous zone at the western end of the large Gilgai complex, under alluvial cover.  A 
follow-up program included detailed ground magnetic surveys and RAB drilling at  
25 m x 50 m spacing over an area of 400 m x 500 m.  A total of 134 RAB holes for a 
cumulative 6,779 m were drilled.  Two inclined diamond holes were also completed, each 
250 m deep.  Assay results from the diamond drilling program showed peak values of 
1.53 g/t Pt, and revealed an iron-rich phase with abundant magnetite and minor sulphides

including pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite.  Jervois Mining Limited later sampled the 
stored core from one of the holes, including three samples from the iron-rich phase.  The 
five samples were submitted to Bequered Laboratories for Neutron Activation Analysis, 
which gave 108, 104, and 110 g/t scandium as shown in Table 6.1. 

Table 6.1 Select Lachlan Assay Results 

 

Anaconda (NSW) Pty. Ltd. acquired exploration title to the area in 1999, and concentrated 
on searching for nickel / cobalt enrichment in laterites overlying serpentinite and the Gilgai 
Complex.  Regionally, Anaconda completed some 31 km of ground magnetic traversing 
and drilled 54 reverse circulation (RC) holes, totalling 2,302 m.  Further work was planned 
by Anaconda but was not carried out, and the property was relinquished in 2001. 

Jervois Mining Limited was conducting exploration in the general area at about the same 
time as Anaconda, and obtained the sample pulps from Anaconda's RC drill program in 
2003, after Anaconda relinquished the exploration area.  Jervois further analysed the drill 
samples for other minerals, including scandium.  These initial assay results confirmed 
significant scandium enrichment in the Gilgai laterites. 

During 2006, Jervois completed an RC program on the property, drilling 64 holes for a 
total of 2,638 m.  This drilling result allowed a resource to be generated, compliant with 
both NI 43-101 and the JORC Code, which was completed by Douglas McKenna and 
Partners during 2010. 

In February 2010, EMC Metals entered into a joint venture earn-in agreement with Jervois 
to deliver a feasibility study on the Nyngan Scandium Project, within two years.  At the two 
year anniversary (February 2012), a dispute developed between the parties which 
ultimately concluded in a private and binding settlement in early 2013.  The terms of the 
settlement required EMC Metals to pay Jervois a cash sum over an 18 month period 
through to June 2014, in return for the transfer of 100% of the Nyngan Scandium Project, 
including the land and mineral licence rights, to EMC Metals.  EMC Metals was also 
required, as part of the settlement, to pay Jervois an NSR royalty of 1.7% on scandium 
produced during the first 12 years of production, and to accept assignment of an existing 
NSR royalty (technically a net profits interest) on the property that Jervois had signed to 
obtain the property years earlier. 

As of October 2014, all payments due on the settlement agreement between the parties 
were made, and formal transfer of exploration tenements and freehold land rights 
associated with the Nyngan scandium property was completed.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

The area is dominated by Cainozoic alluvium of the Bogan River floodplain, which is part 
of the broader Murray-Darling River Basin with minor colluvium and outcrop.  Immediately 
to the east of the project area, the Palaeozoic basement is onlapped by the southern 
margin of part of the Mesozoic aged Surat Basin, known as the Coonamble Embayment.  
The Cainozoic sediments cover both major geological domains, in some cases to depths 
of more than 100 m.  There is evidence of varying degrees of laterisation in the area. 

The area is located within the western-most north-south structural zone of the Lachlan 
Fold Belt, which is known as the Girilambone Structural Zone.  It is composed of 
Cambrian-Ordovician metasediments and minor basic volcanics and is known as the 
Girilambone Group, and it is intruded by numerous mafic and ultramafic bodies of similar 
age and by middle Silurian granite and volcanics. 

Within EMC-A's exploration licences, the Gilgai and Honeybugle intrusive complexes are 
Alaskan-type complexes made up of a range of lithologies from hornblende monzonite, 
hornblendite, pyroxenite and olivine pyroxenite to dunite-peridotites.  The complexes are 
included within the 'Fifield Platinum Province'.  The Gilgai complex is covered by 8 m to 
50 m of Tertiary to Recent age alluvial material, with alluvium detected to 85 m depth near 
the northern margin of the complex (to the north of the defined resource). 

Scandium levels appear to be highest in the pyroxenite and olivine pyroxenite phases of 
the complexes, so these rock types are considered to be the main bedrock sources for the 
scandium mineralisation in the laterites.  The highest scandium grades occur in the 
limonitic laterite units, overlying or close to the pyroxenite source rocks.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

The Nyngan scandium resource is located within a limonitic and saprolitic tertiary age 
laterite profile, covered by 12 to approximately 25m of Cainozoic alluvium.  A fairly typical 
laterite profile is developed at the prospect: 

 Hematitic clay. 

 Limonitic clay. 

 Saprolitic clay. 

 Weathered bedrock. 

 Fresh bedrock. 

The resource is centred over the more mafic phases of the zoned Gilgai ultramafic 
complex.  Weathering persists to more than 65 m depth at the northern margin of the 
resource. 

8.1 Mineralisation 

A geological interpretation plan has been previously prepared, based on bedrock 
intersections in both recent and previous drilling.  Because of the weathered nature of the 
drill cuttings, the geological plan must be considered interpretive.  The igneous rock types 
which have been encountered are: 

 Pyroxenite. 

 Olivine Pyroxenite. 

 Hornblende Pyroxenite. 

 Hornblendite. 

 Magnetite Pyroxenite. 

 Dunite. 

 Monzonite. 

There is a suggestion of a layered trend of the complex in a NW-SE direction (this is 
supported by the magnetic pattern).  These trends reflect a broadly concentric zonation of 
lithologies (mafic lithologies in the centre becoming intermediate in moving out from the 
"core") in the complex.  There also appears to be a zone of stronger alteration in the 
(south) centre of the zone where abundant magnetite and mica (phlogopite) occur.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Surveys and Investigations Done For/By SCY or EMC 

No exploration work on or around the Nyngan scandium property was conducted prior to 
2010, by or on behalf of the Company.  The property was known to have a scandium 
resource at the time the company formed its interest in the property and the project. 

9.2 Surveys and Investigations Done by Others 

Previous shallow RAB drilling (60 holes in 1988 to 1989) on the Nyngan property 
searching for platinum, revealed a large concealed laterite body over an area of more than 
1,000 m x 500 m.  The titleholder, Platinum Search N.L., subsequently drilled two 250 m 
inclined diamond core holes to test the platinum grades in the olivine pyroxene. 

Between 1999 and 2001, two traverses of RC drill holes were drilled by Anaconda NSW 
Pty. Ltd., specifically exploring for nickel on the Nyngan property.  Jervois made the initial 
discovery of the presence of scandium from NAA analysis that they had carried out on 
samples of core from one of the 1989 Platinum Search core holes. 

In September 2005, as part of a regional air core drilling program, Jervois Mining Limited 
drilled five vertical aircore holes (NA49 to NA53 inclusive) along an east-west fence line 
through the centre of the laterite body.  Results from this drilling suggested that a major 
resource of scandium was present at Nyngan. 

Jervois Mining Limited subsequently drilled 69 vertical aircore holes in 2006 (total  
2,638 m), and proved up an initial JORC resource at the prospect. 

The holes were geologically logged (one metre intervals), weighed and magnetic 
susceptibility readings taken.  Chip tray samples were prepared for each drill hole.  All 
intervals below the alluvial overburden were sampled and dispatched for assay (except for 
two holes, NA55 and NA89, which penetrated monzonite and sediments respectively).  All 
sample residues, except alluvium, were transported to a secure, locked shed in Nyngan 
and stored for use in future metallurgical test work.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Drill Program Overview 

While the Nyngan property has been drilled by numerous prior owners since the early 
1980s, the target was never for scandium, and consequently none of the early holes were 
assayed for scandium.  Jervois Mining Limited (Jervois) initiated the scandium interest at 
Nyngan by re-assaying a section of Platinum Search drill core in 2003, which served to 
identify the presence of scandium on the property.   

An NI 43-101 Resource was first established in 2010, based on drill work commissioned 
by Jervois in 2006 (68 holes).  Jervois conducted a second drill program in 2008 (nine 
holes) which served to provide material for metallurgical test work.  The assays from this 
second drill program were not included in the 2010 resource estimate, or the updated 
2016 resource estimate. 

During 2014 and 2015, EMC-A conducted two drilling programs, completing a total of 33 
air core holes for 1,323 m and three diamond holes for 129 m.  In addition, one diamond 
geotechnical hole was extended through the laterite profile to bedrock.  The 2014 to 2015 
drilling data was combined with the earlier drilling information, and used to form the 2016 
NI43-101 resource estimate. 

10.2 Initial 2006 Drilling Program - Procedures 

The 2006 air core drilling program was performed by Competitive Drilling Services Pty. 
Ltd. of Blayney NSW.  The rig used was a Schramm 450, hole diameter 3½" (89 mm) and 
the compressor had a capacity of 350 psi and 600 cfm.  The program drilled a total of 
2,638 m in 68 holes.  A subsequent nine hole program was completed in 2008, in order to 
obtain sample material for research and development.  The assay results from this second 
program were not subsequently included in any resource estimates, although the assay 
results were consistent with the resource defined by the earlier (2006) program. 

All air core drilling was vertical – the lithotype intersection lengths are close to true 
'stratigraphic' widths. 

Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty Ltd employees were present and participated / 
supervised the drill contractor in the field work on both drill programs, in 2006 and in 2014 
to 2015.

10.3 EMC-A 2014 to 2015 Drilling Program - Procedures 

During October 2014 and October 2015, EMC-A completed two resource drilling programs 
on the Nyngan property.  A total of 33 air core drill holes and three diamond holes were 
completed within the measured and indicated scandium laterite resource area.  The aim of 
the drilling was twofold:  

1. To further validate the previous air core drilling results done in 2006, with 
additional air core close infill drilling, particularly where the feasibility study was 
planning production pits. 

2. To provide a large number of diamond core samples from a sufficient geographic 
area of the measured scandium resource area for laterite and lithological 
characterisation, grade validation, and specific gravity (SG) measurements. 

Both the air core and diamond drilling activities utilised the same UDR650 drilling rig. 

The air core drilling used a nominal 120 mm (2014) and 110 mm and 125 mm diameter 
aircore bits (2015) with 100 mm rods and an additional compressed air source to 
maximise sample recovery, and to minimise blockages through the drilling and cyclone 
system of the drilling rig.  Sample returns passed through a standard cyclone into a clean 
plastic bulk bag for each metre drilled.  The bulk bag was delivered to the sampling and 
logging crew who were employees of Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty Ltd.  The air core 
drilling was completed by an experienced driller with at least 20 years of drilling 
experience and extensive experience drilling lateritic deposits in NSW. 

The diamond drilling program used a standard PQ (83 mm / 3¼") diamond drilling 
configuration with a triple tube set up to maximise recovery and the condition of the 
recovered core.  While recovery was variable in the alluvial overburden (improving during 
the program), recovery of laterite, saprolite and saprock was excellent and usually was 
100% for most drilling runs of up to three metres in length.  The recovered core was 
marked with a driller's line and placed into plastic PQ diamond core trays.  Core mark up, 
recoveries and geological logging was completed on site before transport to RME's 
Orange premises.  At RME the core was stored in a locked up warehouse and placed on 
core racks where specific gravity measurements were taken.  A number of short intervals 
of core were selected from each diamond hole and weighed wet and immersed.  The core 
was then dried in a locked gas-fired dryer and then re-weighed and weighed immersed.  
Each interval was identified with an aluminium tag placed in the core tray and also in the 
aluminium tray used to move and dry each piece of core individually.  After the specific 
gravity measurements were completed the core was returned to the core trays ready for 
splitting and sampling. 

In addition to the air core and diamond drill work, one large diameter (48.65 m) PQ 
geotechnical core hole (MP-BH01) was drilled to bedrock between the two planned initial 
pit areas.  This hole intersected 20 m of limonitic laterite.  SG determinations on core from 
this hole were incorporated in to the average SG figures used in the resource calculations 
but the assay data were not.

10.4 Drill Recoveries and Drilling Conditions 

The 2006 drill program suffered some progress delays, caused by blockages in the head 
take-off tube, especially in gravel overburden.  Except for occasional hard hematite (hole 
NA85 was abandoned due to hard hematitic ground), the laterite zone generally allowed 
good drilling and recovery.  A hammer bit (4¾" = 121 mm diameter) was used in one hole 
(NA100) due to hard ground. 

The 2014 to 2015 drill program results were similar, in that the alluvial gravels were the 
area where productivity was reduced.  Sample recovery during the air core drilling 
program was satisfactory.  Diamond core recoveries were determined by accurate length 
measurements taken on the drill core recovered during drilling.  The recovery of diamond 
drill core during the program was very good except for several intervals in the overlying 
alluvial gravels. 

Moisture was not a problem for either the 2006 or the 2014 to 2015 air core drilling 
programs, as surface drilling conditions were dry, with only minor water encountered.  The 
hematitic and limonitic laterites intersected were also generally dry with good recoveries.  
Saprolite intersected was dry to moist and sticky, with some minor impact on recoveries, 
however recovery overall was good.  Diamond core quality from the 2014 to 2015 
campaign was excellent from the three diamond holes and the core was mostly competent 
and recovered in solid lengths. 

10.5 Drill Collar Surveying and Locations 

The 2006 program completed each hole by capping it with a blast hole plug about one 
metre down from the collar and backfilling.  The hole's position was then surveyed using a 
Garmin GPS12 XL instrument and a marker pin with drill hole number was placed in the 
collar location.  At the end of the drilling program, Consulting Surveyors, Langford and 
Rowe of Dubbo completed a controlled survey of the drill hole collars using a Leica 
Differential (RTK and static) system. 

The 2014 to 2015 program completed each hole similarly, and then located both air core 
and diamond drill hole collars with a Trimble GeoExplorer 6000 differential GPS meter.  
The data was post-processed, and has 10 cm vertical and horizontal accuracy.  All 
coordinates were reported in Map Grid of Australia (MGA94) Zone 55 projection. 

The collar plan for the holes included in the Resource is shown in Figure 10.1.

The 2014 to 2015 air core program was designed to provide infill to the existing 100 m x 
100 m and 50 m x 50 m spaced areas of the resource.  The objective of this program was 
to provide 50 m x 25 m spaced holes, particularly in the higher grade section of the 
resource, to confirm continuity of grade and thickness of the mineralised horizon at that 
drill spacing and to provide information on the future grade control requirements for the 
deposit. 

The three diamond holes were drilled primarily for geotechnical information.   

The most recent air core program also confirmed that the laterite portion of the resource 
has the higher scandium grades, when compared to typical scandium grades occurring in 
the saprolite intervals.  The limonite and saprolite intervals do vary in thickness laterally, 
and the grade also varies.  Ground water and below surface topography are suggested as 
significant in determining the grade of scandium in these intervals. 

10.7 Relevant Samples – 2014 and 2015 Drilling Results 

Refer to Table 10.1 and 10.2 for the significant intervals relating to the 2006 and the 2014 
to 2015 drill programs.  All widths are considered true as the holes were drilled vertically.  
The results are calculated using a 100ppm cut-off for the interval grade.

10.8 Specific Gravity Determinations 

As described in Section 10.3, in-situ (wet-weight basis) and dry-weight basis specific 
gravity determinations were made on sections of core from holes SNRDD-001, 002, and 
003.  Four determinations were made on alluvium, four on hematitic laterite, 58 on 
limonitic laterite, 27 on saprolitic material, and three on bedrock. 

In addition, dry-weight determinations only were made on core from geotechnical hole 
MPBH-01, including three sections of alluvium, 16 of limonitic laterite, nine of saprolitic 
material and one of bedrock.  The data was combined to calculate average specific gravity 
figures, the ranges of specific gravity values and average moisture contents for each 
lithotype.  These are summarised in Table 10.3.  The "dry-weight" SGs were used in the 
resource calculations.

11.0 SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sample Recovery Methods - General 

The Nyngan property resource has proven itself very amenable to air core drilling, based 
on depth, material characteristics, and overall efficiencies in applying this drill technique.  
While some sample recovery risk is inherent in any drilling technique, air drilling 
techniques require care in certain specific areas to minimise potential error.  The 
application of this drill technique is common in laterite mineralisation, and is the drill 
technique of choice in the NSW lateritic belt.  The combination of available reverse-
circulation drill rigs, the use of high air flow rates, and a competent, experienced drill 
operator resulted in acceptable resource sample recoveries from this technique.   

Maintaining and observing consistency in sample weights is a good basic indicator of 
driller performance in the resource.  The weights of the bulk (1 metre interval) samples 
were generally in the target range of 11 to 15 kg, with only occasional deviation to lower or 
higher weights. 

In damp or wet stratigraphy (particularly the leached saprolite), sample weights did often 
drop below 10 kg, possibly due to returns sticking to the internal walls of the rod string and 
the pipe work leading to the cyclone, to the walls of the cyclone itself, or possibly 
remaining in the drill hole behind the bit.  The main effect of this was likely some 
'smearing' (contamination) of assay values across subsequent sample intervals, which 
might in turn affect average grades as observed in the lower level saprolite lithology.  This 
is considered unlikely to have had any material effect on the overall grade of each 
lithology in the resource model. 

11.2 Sample Recovery Methods – 2006 Drill Program  

The 2006 drill program sampling method (Competitive Drilling Services Pty. Ltd.) collected 
initial samples through a cyclone mounted directly on the drilling rig, individually captured, 
at one metre intervals, in large plastic bags (bulk sample bags).  These large bags were 
individually weighed, and magnetic susceptibility readings taken. 

Each hole was geologically logged by sieving material from each of these large bags, into 
smaller sample bags of 1 to 2 kg each (assay sample bags).  The smaller samples were 
collected for analysis using a metal scoop by hand.  Reference chip samples were also 
taken for each drill hole.  The air was expelled from the small bags, the tops folded down 
several times, and sealed with heavy-duty staples.  All drill intervals below the alluvial 
overburden were sampled in this manner, generating an individual assay sample bag for 
each. 

The small plastic assay sample bags were packed into labelled larger plastic bags for 
ease of shipment and better protection against damage, and transported to a secure  
shed in Nyngan at the end of each day, where they remained locked until the end of the 
drilling program.  Shortly after the end of the program, all of the assay sample bags were

loaded onto pallets, shrink-wrapped and sent to the Australian Laboratory Services Pty 
Ltd's (ALS) assay facility in Orange by commercial road transport, a distance of 315 km by 
road, for mineral assay. 

Approximately a week after the completion of the drilling program, concurrently with 
rehabilitation of the drill sites, all of the large bulk sample bags, except those of alluvium 
or metasediments, were transported to a locked, secure shed owned by Jervois, for long-
term secure storage. 

At a later date, Jervois personnel retrieved a limited number of the stored one metre bulk 
samples, and using a riffle splitter, split off new samples for analysis, to check against 
those samples collected by scoop.  The scandium assay values for the split samples 
corresponded closely to those of the scooped samples sent earlier for assay to ALS in 
Orange. 

The 2006 program bulk sample bags were subsequently retrieved by Rangott Mineral 
Exploration personnel, and placed in a secure storage facility managed and controlled by 
Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty Ltd, in Orange, NSW (RME). 

11.3 Sample Recovery Methods – 2014 to 2015 Drill Program 

The 2014 to 2015 drill program (Drillit Consulting Pty Ltd) sampling method was similar to 
the earlier 2006 program.  Bulk pre-numbered sample bags were delivered from the 
drilling rig cyclone to the sampling crew by the driller's offsider.  The driller signalled to the 
offsider when each metre had been drilled and the sample from each metre was 
downloaded into the bulk bag while attached to the outlet of the cyclone.  The pre-
numbered bulk bags were available for each metre drilled, and were used to eliminate 
cross contamination and splitting issues encountered by the use of buckets or bins.  
Careful checking of metres drilled was undertaken after every 10 m drilled and tallied with 
the bulk bags that were placed in lines of 20 m. 

Each hole had both pre-numbered plastic bulk and calico assay bags, marked with pre-
determined depths based on the expected final depth of each hole and depth of alluvium.  
Sample numbers were designated by the hole number and depth interval to eliminate 
sampling errors with sequential numbering.  Spare plastic and calico bags were also 
available in case a drill hole was drilled deeper than expected.   

Alluvium was not sampled, however it was collected into a bulk bag on a metre basis and 
stored at each drill site for future reference.  Due to variability of the depth of alluvium in 
each hole, the decision to commence splitting and sampling was based on the visual 
identification of laterite in the bulk bags (during drilling, with special attention taken close 
to the anticipated laterite contact).  In some cases, a further check of the bulk samples 
resulted in additional sampling of intervals where mixed alluvium-laterite was 
encountered. 

Each bulk bag was weighed on delivery by the driller's offsider on a set of Wedderburn 
high capacity scales.  A tare weight was programmed into the scales.  Sample weights for

each metre drilled, excluding alluvium were recorded during the operations bulk sample 
weight sheets.  The bulk bags were lined up ready for splitting after weighing was 
completed.  Alluvium bags were not weighed and were lined up in the designated bulk bag 
area for each drill hole. 

When laterite was identified in the bulk bags, the corresponding pre-numbered plastic bulk 
and calico assay bags were attached to a three tier splitter.  The plastic bulk bag from the 
corresponding interval was then emptied into the splitter.  On completion of each hole and 
the splitting off of a duplicate sample (one per hole), all calico assay bags were collected 
into polyweave bags and sealed with a cable tie.  The polyweave bags were stored in 
locked premises before being transported, as one lot, to RME's premises in Orange where 
blanks, standards and high grade check pulps were inserted into the bags.  The assay 
bags were then shipped by RME to ALS in Orange, NSW, for mineral assay.  At all times, 
the assay samples were either supervised by RME personnel or secured in locked 
premises. 

One metre reference chip samples were taken for each hole during the sampling and 
splitting operation with a small sample retrieved from the split bulk bag via a sample 
spear.  Minimal dry sieving was undertaken with a representative sample collected for 
each metre and spooned in to a pre-labelled 20-compartment plastic chip tray.  A sample 
sheet, brief geological log (lithology only) and cross section was updated during the 
splitting and sampling operations for each hole in conjunction with the collection of chip 
tray samples.  As a general observation, once the laterite-alluvium contact was 
intersected, no further alluvium was encountered, and splitting and sampling operations 
were continuous from that point to the end of each hole (EOH).  EOH was determined by 
assessment of the amount of hard saprolite or saprock present during sieving.  After the 
weighing, splitting and sampling and drill chip collection the numbered bulk sample bags 
were placed in lines of 20 and folded over. 

Specific actions were taken to maintain sampling accuracy and minimise contamination of 
individual samples at the drill site, for both bulk and assay samples.  The cyclone was 
cleaned before the drilling of each hole and was inspected regularly during the drilling.  
After blockages, the drill rods and hoses were flushed with air to remove potential 
contamination.  The drilling of at least 15 m of alluvium cover in each hole was also 
thought to be effective at removing contamination from hole to hole.  Clean blank bags 
were only used on the cyclone with the collection of bulk air core samples on a metre 
basis.  The three tier splitter was thoroughly cleaned between the splitting of one metre 
samples.  After completion of drilling, the air core bulk sample bags were either 
transported back to Orange or stored in a fenced bag farm at the Nyngan property site.  
The holes stored at the Nyngan site were re-sampled for the purposes of keeping archive 
samples from those holes.  The archive sampling was completed during the drilling 
program using a sample spear and plastic bags sealed with cable ties. 

Diamond core sampling followed a different protocol, tailored to the different technique.  
After initial logging (at the drill site) of the diamond drill core, coherent 10 to 20 cm long 
pieces of core were selected for subsequent specific gravity (SG) determinations.  The 
individual cores had their top and bottom depths marked on them, they were then

wrapped in cling-wrap to reduce moisture loss, and were returned to their positions in the 
core trays.  The core trays were securely strapped in to the trays of two RME vehicles and 
an RME industrial trailer, and transported to Orange, to RME's storage facility, in two lots.  
At Orange, the trays were unloaded and stored in RME's locked warehouse. 

After the specific gravity measurements and all other logging activities were completed, 
the diamond core was split and sampled by RME personnel.  The majority of the core was 
split with the use of a paint scraper, hammer and chisel and in some cases a historic core 
splitter.  The more competent core was cut with a diamond core using minimal water flow 
to minimise core loss.  Duplicate intervals were identified before splitting and cutting.  
After splitting and cutting the ½ core was sampled on a metre basis and where duplicate 
intervals were indicated, a ¼ core sample was included in the main sample stream at the 
end of the sampling interval in each hole.   

11.4 Assaying and Analytical Procedures 

All samples, from both drill programs, were sent to the same assay laboratory for sample 
preparation, ALS Laboratories in Orange, NSW.  This facility has extensive experience 
with NSW laterites and was considered highly experienced and knowledgeable with 
regard to the nature of the local material represented at Nyngan.   

The 2006 drill assays were delivered to the ALS facility in Orange, NSW, where pallets of 
samples were stored for several days prior to sample preparation.  ALS dried the samples 
and pulverised them in accordance with their PUL-23 protocol, described below:  

"A sample up to 3 kg is ground in a ring mill pulveriser using a standard low-
chrome steel ring set.  If the sample is >3 kg, it is split prior to pulverizing and 
the remainder may be retained or discarded.  Samples too coarse to be put 
directly into a pulverizing mill, or where the particle size needs to be reduced 
before a representative split can be taken are crushed and split prior to 
pulverizing.  The remainder may be saved or dumped at the client's request." 

From the pulverised material, two 150 g sub-samples were taken, and sent to the ALS 
head office facility in Brisbane.  The PUL-23 method has a specified grind size of 85% 
less than 75 μm.  The remainder and majority of the samples were analysed by ALS in 
Orange. 

The bulk of the assays, conducted by ALS Orange, were analyzed by Technique ME-
MS62s, a single-element trace level method.  A 0.25 g aliquot of the sub-sample was 
digested using a standard "four acid" method consisting of perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric 
and hydrochloric acids (regarded as a "near-total" decomposition), and the solution was 
then analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry, with a lower detection 
limit for scandium of 1ppm and an upper limit of 500ppm. 

Samples which assayed ≥500ppm scandium were re-analysed by Technique ME-ICP61.  
This method uses the same four-acid ("near-total") digestion method with a similar 0.25 g 
aliquot, with Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy determination of

scandium with a lower detection limit of 1ppm and an upper limit of 10,000ppm (1%).  This 
technique also analyses for a range of elements. 

The two small batches of samples assayed by the Brisbane ALS Head Office were 
analysed by Technique ME-ICP AES, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission 
Spectroscopy, specifically type OG-62.  A 0.4 to 0.5 g aliquot of the sub-sample was 
similarly subjected to a four-acid digestion, then analysed for a range of elements (which 
included scandium), with a lower detection limit for scandium of 1ppm. 

The results of the two different laboratory tests and techniques was not divergent, and 
indicated little preference for one technique over the other-with respect to scandium assay 
accuracy or repeatability.  Where a full suite of element assays are desirable, the multi-
element result from ME-ICP61 technique was considered desirable and was adopted in 
later assay work. 

In 2014, ALS and Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty Ltd, discovered a tendency for the 
traditional four-acid digestion technique to either incompletely digest scandium or to re-
precipitate scandium prior to final assay, thereby subsequently generating an 
understatement of scandium present in the following assay step.  The tendency was more 
pronounced in limonitic and hematitic clays than in saprolitic clays, and more significant in 
laterites exceeding 100ppm.  ALS believes this is a result of premature precipitation of 
CaF2 in the test tubes during digestion.  This concern has been further reinforced by 
results from a lithium borate fusion digestion technique to replace the four-acid digestion 
step, followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) 
for assay.  The fusion-ICP process is referred to as Technique Sc-ICP06, and it 
consistently generates scandium assays noticably higher in the Nyngan resource.  Other 
groups, specifically assaying lateritic clays for scandium using ALS laboratories in 
Australia, are finding similar results.  

The analytical process for Sc-ICP06, as described by ALS, is as follows.  A small sample 
(0.1 g) is fused in 12:22 flux, which is a mixture of 12 parts lithium tetraborate and 22 parts 
lithium metaborate.  The fusion is carried out in a graphite crucible at 1,000°C.  The 
resultant glass (solidified from cooling the melt) is dissolved in dilute acid and made to 
volume of 100 ml.  There is no visible undissolved sample residue after the fusion, 
although sometimes there is a small amount of graphite powder from the crucible.  Once 
the fused sample is dissolved into the liquid acid, the solution is then assayed for 
scandium by ICP-AES. 

The Company notes that fusion digestion results generally deliver higher scandium 
assays than the four-acid digestion method, traditionally used in nickel and cobalt assay 
work, where the Sc content is >100ppm.  The Company believes the fusion technique 
generates a truer assay result, and intends to rely on and utilise fusion digestion 
techniques going forward to support mine planning and advanced economic and 
development studies.  The fusion results were the only assay results used in the updated 
2016 resource with regard to the 2014 to 2015 drill program.  The assays on the 2006 drill 
program, also a part of the updated 2016 resource, are only available in ME-ICP61 as

completed in 2006, and were included in that form as previously applied to earlier 
resource estimates.  

The 2014 to 2015 drill samples were assayed using two independent techniques, ME-
ICP61 and Sc-ICP06 (fusion) analysis, to determine and compare the scandium content 
and to also obtain the multi-element content of each sample.  ALS in Orange did the initial 
sample preparation work, while ALS Brisbane did the assay work, in the same manner as 
the 2006 assay work was completed.  A comparison of the two assay techniques, over all 
33 air core holes and all three diamond core holes in the 2014 to 2015 program, showed a 
25% higher scandium assay result with a lithium borate fusion assay system (weighted 
average over all assays and one metre lengths). 

ALS / Orange dried and weighed the received assay samples, and pulverised the entire 
sample to 85% passing 75 microns or better (technique PUL-21).  50 g bags of the pulps 
were then split off and sent to the ALS laboratory at Stafford in Brisbane, Queensland for 
analysis.  

ALS / Brisbane analysed the pulps for scandium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, iron, 
magnesium, manganese, aluminium and calcium, using Inductively Coupled Plasma 
Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) after a four acid digestion (technique ME-
ICP61).  The results were also repeat-tested, only for scandium, using a lithium borate 
fusion digestion technique, followed by similar ICP-AES assay.  The lower detection limit 
for scandium using either technique is 1ppm.  RME included one commercial standard 
sample and three high-grade scandium pulps from previously analysed batches, for 
quality control; and also included one duplicate sample from each hole in the batch.  For 
internal quality control, ALS / Brisbane added additional standard samples (for repeat 
analyses), blank samples and duplicate samples to the batch.  

11.5 Laboratory Certification 

None of the assay samples used to support the mineral resource estimate contained in 
this report were prepared for analysis by any employees or subcontract personnel of 
EMC-A or by Jervois Mining Limited.  All assay samples, from all drill programs included 
in the resource estimate, were prepared by Australian Laboratory Services Pty. Ltd. 
(ALS). 

The ALS staff are supported by a Quality Management System (QMS) framework which is 
designed to highlight data inconsistencies sufficiently early enough in the process to 
enable suitable corrective action to be taken in time to meet reporting deadlines.  The 
QMS framework follows ISO 17025:2005 for laboratory analysis.  The ALS Laboratories 
used by EMC-A are certified by NATA.  ALS is completely independent of EMC-A and its 
Parent, SCY. 

11.6 Quality Control – Duplicates, Blanks, and Standards 

Both the 2006 drill program and the 2014 to 2015 drill program utilised duplicate assay 
pulps, and followed the practice of inserting blanks and standards into the assay process.

Rangott Mineral Exploration personel were present in supervisory roles on both programs, 
and ALS followed these quality control steps as well, and provided certificates to verify the 
practice.  Specific detail is provided on the 2014 to 2015 program, as follows: 

Every hole in this program (36) had a duplicate inserted, at a random depth.  The 
duplicate was selected semi-randomly from either laterite and saprolite lithologies with 
preference given to intersections from the anticipated Sc ore zones.  The bulk one metre 
sample was split and sampled using the same procedure used during the sampling of all 
aircore drill holes.  The duplicate interval was recorded on the sample sheet and backed 
up with a permanent label on the relevant bulk bag (DUP or *).  The duplicate sample 
calico bag sent for assay was designated by the hole number and the suffix 'X2', so that 
the laboratory had no indication of the depth interval of the duplicate. 

A blank sample consisting of Tertiary Basalt crusher dust was inserted before each 
duplicate sample and designated with the hole number and suffix 'X1'. 

Duplicate intervals for the diamond drill holes were pre-selected and included laterite and 
saprolite lithologies.  One duplicate each was selected for diamond drill hole SNRDD001 
and SNRDD002, while two duplicates were selected for diamond drill hole SNRDD003.  
During the splitting and sampling process, when a duplicate interval was reached, the 
core was split into ¼ cores.  The duplicate intervals were recorded and sampled into a 
separate calico bag with a sample number designated with the hole number and a false 
depth interval at the end that hole. 

The duplicate results demonstrated that the results were repeatable with only three 
duplicate samples varying by more than 5%, when the duplicate result was compared to 
the result for the corresponding interval.  These duplicate results included EMCG018,  
29 to 30 m, difference of +5.79%, EMCG025, 24 to 25 m, difference of +6.02% and 
SNRDD003 20 to 21 m, difference of -7.81% (see Table 11.1 for duplicate results).

A number of certified standards and high grade Sc laterite reference duplicate pulps were 
inserted into the aircore sample stream submitted to ALS Laboratories in Orange, NSW.  
The two certified standards used (see Table 11.2), included Oreas 45d and Oreas 45e 
(see Table 11.2).   

Three high grade reference duplicate pulps were also used and were obtained from bulk 
drill samples from another high grade scandium laterite deposit in NSW for which Sc had 
been determined by analytical methods ME-ICP61 and Sc-ICP06 (fusion) (ALS 
Laboratories) and Neutron Activation method INAA (ActLabs Canada).  The high grade 
reference duplicate sample numbers are HGSR-1, HGSR-2 and HGSR-3.  These are not 
certified standards; they are essentially reference duplicate samples.

After the 2015 drilling program, a total of two certified standards and four of the high grade 
reference duplicate pulps were inserted into the assay sample stream.  The variability 
between the certified standard assay results (assayed during the 2015 Nyngan program) 
and the certified value was -1.08% to 3.45%.  The variability between the assay results for 
the high grade duplicate pulps (assayed during the 2015 Nyngan program) and the 
averaged historic assay results was 1.64% to 5.05% (see Table 11.2 for historic results 
and averages). 

With the diamond drill samples, a total of four certified standards and four high grade 
reference duplicate pulps were inserted into the sample stream.  The variability between 
the certified standard assay results and the certified value was -6.45% to -2.64%.  The 
variability between the assay results from the high grade duplicate pulps (assayed during 
the 2015 Nyngan program) and the averaged historic assay results was -0.64% to 1.37% 
(see Table 11.2 for historic results and averages). 

The performance of the high grade reference duplicate samples using the three analytical 
techniques is compared in Table 11.3 and lists all assay results obtained from these 
samples prior to the 2015 Nyngan drilling program.  An average of the initial Sc-ICP06 Sc 
results and all subsequent historic Sc-ICP06 assay results for each of the high grade 
duplicate pulps (HGSR-1, HGSR-2 and HGSR-3) has been used to compare the 
performance of the use of these pulps with the 2015 program.

11.7 Adequacy Opinion of Author 

In the opinion of the QP, Stuart Hutchin, the quality of sample preparation, security and 
analytical proceedures is considered adequate.  The Author also notes that ALS operates 
with a rigorous system of internal standards and duplicates, and participates in regular 
round-robin analyses of samples with other commercial laboratories worldwide. 

Considerable development of analytical proceedures has been conducted by ALS in 
recent years for scandium contained in laterite deposits, including direct work in concert 
with Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty Ltd, on the Nyngan resource and other NSW lateritic 
scandium property targets under development by other mining companies.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Data Verification Measures 

The geological database has been provided to Mining One by Rangott Mineral Exploration 
Pty Ltd, (RME) and by SCY.  RME has been involved with the project since the intitial 
drilling program was undertaken by Jervois in 2005, and SCY has been involved with the 
project since 2009.  In addition to the drilling program data, Mining One has also been 
provided with ALS reports and assay logs on the drill hole data used in this Report.  

During the period of ownership by EMC-A, a number of validation exercises have been 
completed on the database to provide a high level of confidence in the data used in the 
geological modeling and the associated Mineral Resource Estimate. 

The following discussion provides a summary of the previous verification exercises 
completed by RME (as part of the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report) and by Mining 
One, as a part of the current Technical Report.  

12.2 Data Verification on 2010 and 2014 Technical Reports 

The following observations and independent checks by RME personnel were undertaken 
to support the accuracy and integrity of the assay and resource calculation work on the 
initial (2010) Nyngan Resource, on which Maxell Rangott was QP, and on the 2014 
Technical Report (ammended in 2015), on which Maxell Rangott was also QP: 

 RME personnel reviewed sampling techniques on the  2006 (and 2008) drill 
program holes, including the recording of sample recoveries captured on the drill 
log sheets. 

 RME personnel verified the packaging and shipment of mineral samples to the 
ALS assay laboratory. 

 Jervois employees who supervised the drill operators on the 2006 drill program 
were personally interviewed by Maxell Rangott, as to verification of process 
employed for field sample collection, preparation, and transport procedures. 

 The analysis of the samples was conducted by ALS, an independent minerals 
assay laboratory, applying methods with wide industry acceptance, consistent 
with techniques others in this district had been using with confidence for some 
years, after various check analyses in other laboratories. 

 ALS included standards, blanks and duplicates during the laboratory analysis and 
provided certificates to verify this practice.  There were no anomalies reported 
from this control measure. 

 The original ALS assay results documents are available, and in the posession of 
SCY and RME, and they were reviewed and checked for consistency by RME

against assay results used in the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report, with an 
effective date of October 10, 2014. 

 RME verified that proper care was taken to accurately locate the drill hole 
locations on the 2006 (and 2008) Nyngan drill programs.  Drill collars were 
surveyed using a Garmin GPS12 XL instrument.  A marker pin inscribed with the 
drill hole number was placed in each collar.  At the end of the drilling program, 
Consulting Surveyors completed a controlled survey of the drill hole collars using 
(1.41) Differential GPS software. 

RME has had the opportunity to participate in other project work in the district, where 
lateritic resources were being evaluated.  This has generated data that has corroborating 
value for the Nyngan resource data accuracy, assay accuracy, and density calculation 
accuracy.  Specifically: 

 RME reviewed results of an assay check program done previously on laterite 
samples (predominantly from Jervois' nickel/cobalt laterite deposits at Young, 
NSW).  This program compared ALS assay values to Becquerel Laboratories 
Neutron Activation assays on Young samples, both at laboratories at Lucas 
Heights, NSW, and in Canada, noting consistency in results, further supporting 
ALS work accuracy on Nyngan property laterite samples. 

 RME reviewed results of a density check program on local laterites, again 
conducted by Jervois, comparing calculations on the four lithologies in the 
Nyngan resource, and compared them to those from another laterite project in 
NSW for consistency.  RME also compared the density figures with those 
determined on core from a third prospect in NSW.  Good agreement between the 
three sets of values for the hematitic and limonitic laterite were noted, with a 
somewhat lower value noted for the saprolitic laterite at Nyngan, when compared 
to the other two prospects. 

The assay results of the 2014-15 SCY drilling program, while not a part of the drill hole 
data included in the 2014 Technical Report, were partially available in 2014, and were 
reviewed to validate the grades, lithologies and data consistency of the earlier drill results.  
The more recent drilling results that were available, were cross-checked by RME staff for 
that purpose, at the time the 2014 NI 43-101 PEA, ammended in 2015, was issued by 
SCY. 

12.3 Mining One Data Verification on 2016 Technical Report 

Mining One conducted independent verification on data used in this Technical Report, 
both in discussions with RME personnel, and through independent review and check of 
data resulting from the 2014 to 2015 drill program.  Specific verification steps included: 

 Review of ALS assay reports on the 2014 to 2015 drill program, confirming 
consistency with data files supplied by RME.

 Confirmation that ALS employed industry standard use of blanks, duplicates and 
standards in their assay results reporting. 

 Detailed discussion with Maxell Rangott of RME, regarding work and steps taken 
to insure verification of data accuracy on the 2006 drill program, were  
Mr. Rangott had first-hand experience with the program and the results. 

 Detailed discussion with RME personnel, who managed and field-supervised the 
drill program in 2014-15 for EMC-A, as to QA-QC steps taken at that time, and 
since, to secure data and samples. 

 Independent verification with ALS regarding the validity of assay techniques used 
on Nyngan resource, specifically the validity, integrety and accuracy preference 
with respect to lithium borate fusion techniques over four acid digestion 
techniques for new assay results, where they are available with recent drilling 
assays. 

12.4 Site Inspections 

In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Stuart Hutchin and Geoffrey Duckworth, both 
Qualified Persons with respect to this Report, have both visited the Nyngan project site 
within the six months prior to the effective date of this Report.  The purpose of these visits 
was as follows: 

 Understand and view the geological and geographical setting of the Project. 

 Witness the extent and locations of development drilling conducted to date on the 
property, specifically the recent 2014 to 2015 drill program and recent 
geotechnical drilling supporting the site development plans in the feasibility study. 

 Understand the ecological setting for the Project, including flora and fauna on 
site, water management,  and potential impacts from mine development and 
mitigation strategies that should be a part of mine and property development. 

 Understand logistical matters with respect to haul roads, topography, fencing 
needs, proximity to neighbors and to evaluate the resources and support 
capabilities in existance in the town of Nyngan. 

12.5 Opinion on Data Adequacy 

The 2006 to 2008 resource database and information was verified without discrepancy by 
Maxell Rangott for SCY, as a part of a 2014 NI 43-101 Technical Report Ammended in 
2015), as the Qualified Person.  

Mining One, with Stuart Hutchin as the Qualified Person, has accepted that appropriate 
scientific methods and best professional judgement were used in the collection and 
interpretation of the 2006 to 2008 resource drill program, and similarly that the database 
related to both the 2006 to 2008 and the 2014 to 2015 drilling programs, as supplied by

13.2 Mineralised Resource Provided to Metallurgical Laboratories 

The samples delivered to Hazen Research, SGS Lakefield and CSIRO facilities that were 
used in the test work programs were bulk samples taken from the original sample bags 
which contained drill cuttings for each metre of the Jervois drilling program.  Some 
samples were entirely limonitic whilst others were entirely saprolitic and some were a

combination of the two hosting clays.  Prior to dispatch of the samples to test facilities, the 
bags were stored in a locked, secure building in Nyngan. 

Hazen Research received two shipments of laterite material from EMC Metals in 2010 that 
was primarily used for an acid bake research program.  The first was a set of five small 
samples, three limonite and two saprolite samples, weighing from 1.4 kg to 8.6 kg each, 
which were used in the laboratory scale program.  The second shipment included  
741 kg of limonite and 371 kg of saprolite for pilot scale test work.  These samples were 
bulk samples of indeterminate origin from the Nyngan site recovered from the remnant 
samples of the 2008 Jervois Mining drilling program and were shipped directly from 
Australia to Hazen in Colorado (USA). 

The limonite and saprolite samples were separately dried and homogenised.  Prior to 
crushing, 51 kg of limonite and 29 kg of saprolite were extracted and saved as library 
samples.  Each sample type was then crushed to 100% passing 50 mesh (297 μm) and 
re-blended.  A 10 kg split of each crushed sample type was saved as a library sample for 
further analysis work as needed. 

The five small samples were individually homogenised and representative splits of each of 
the samples removed for analysis and testing.  Semi-quantitative XRF scans were 
performed at Hazen Research, followed by quantitative analysis of minor elements not 
considered reliable in the XRF scan, namely scandium, cerium, lanthanum and 
phosphorus.  These were checked by an outside laboratory (Huffman Laboratories, Inc.) 
as a quality control measure.  

The second shipment consisted of bagged and loose material in steel drums.  Samples 
referenced in Metcon reports labelled as Batch 3 Gilgai limonite and Batch 2 Gilgai 
saprolite were used for laboratory studies.  The results from these samples are shown in 
Table 13.1.  A second batch of Batch 3 limonite was also used in some of the extraction 
work.

For the SGS Lakefield HPAL work, two batches of material were received.  For the work 
conducted in 2012, two bulk samples of Nyngan limonite were supplied by EMC Metals to 
SGS Lakefield.  These were labelled as "Limonite" and "Raw Limonite" similar in origin to 
the Hazen samples.  These samples were composited from limonite material recovered 
from drill core from Jervois Mining drill holes NA29 (18 to 23 m), NA54 (20 to 22 m),  
NA57 (52 to 53 m) and NA58 (38 to 43 m). 

The second batch of samples used in the 2014 to 2015 test program were the metre by 
metre samples from drill holes EMCG009 (14 to 24 m) and EMCG010 (15 to 30 m).  
These were characterised in terms of chemical analysis, analysis for moisture and 
contained chloride, and chemistry by size fraction.  The head assays for the composites 
made from the samples and used in the HPAL leaching work are shown in Table 13.1.  
These drill holes were specifically selected because they are located in the early years of 
the preliminary pit design.  They are substantially higher in grade than the earlier samples 
used in the early leaching work. 

It should be noted that the limonite at Nyngan varies in chemical analysis by depth within 
the limonite layer.  Figure 13.1 shows the scandium composition by depth within the 
limonite layer for the two drill holes used in the latest SGS work.  The scandium 
concentration is highest in the middle of the limonite layer.

13.3.1 High Pressure Acid Leach Test Work 

Test work on High Pressure Acid Leaching has been conducted at both Hazen Research 
and SGS Lakefield.  Most of the leaching has been conducted using two litre autoclaves, 
although some 20L autoclave tests were conducted at SGS.  The traditional variables 
commonly used for HPAL leaching of nickel laterites were examined including: 

 Acid:ore ratio. 

 Residence time. 

 Temperature. 

 Pressure. 

 Solids density. 

The limonite used for the test work came from a number of drill holes from the Nyngan 
site, with the latter work at SGS using material from drill holes located in the proposed first 
five years of mining operation.  

The early work at Hazen Research consisted of six HPAL tests at 2L scale in which 
recoveries of 73 to 81% were achieved at 10 and 20% solids and up to 60 minutes 
residence time.  The tests appear to have used limited acid additions at 0.25 kg sulphuric 
acid per kg of limonite, which could explain the less than desirable scandium recoveries. 

The work at SGS on HPAL leaching has been conducted in three campaigns: 

 A series of 16 HPAL tests, ten on limonite and six on acid bake leach residue. 

 A second series of six HPAL tests, three on limonite, two on saprolite and one on 
a limonite / saprolite blend. 

 A third series of 20 HPAL tests on limonite only. 

 A final fourth series of tests in conjunction with sample production for residue 
settling trials. 

Most of the tests have been conducted in 2L autoclaves, although three were conducted 
at 20L scale to produce leach residue for subsequent tailings testing. 

From the bench scale tests at SGS Lakefield, a set of optimum leach conditions based 
largely on the third SGS Lakefield series of HPAL tests have been selected for the DFS.  
These include: 

 Acid:ore ratio of 0.325:1.0, resulting in a net sulphuric acid consumption (when 
some recirculation to pregnant leach solution (PLS) feed is taken into 
consideration) of 275 kg/t of limonite ore.

 Residence time of 90 minutes. 

 Temperature of 265°C which is within the known technical capability of HPAL 
operations. 

 An average scandium recovery to solution of 87%. 

With no continuous autoclave pilot operation having been conducted, the CCD circuit after 
HPAL was been designed on a limited amount of static and dynamic settling testing.  A 
conservative figure of 31% thickener underflow density has been assumed across the 
plant, resulting in the need for an eight stage CCD thickener wash circuit. 

13.3.2 Solvent Extraction Test Work 

Solvent extraction test work for recovery of scandium from the HPAL solutions has been 
conducted at CSIRO, Hazen Research and at the Nagrom laboratory in Brisbane. 

Solvent extraction test work was initially conducted at CSIRO in 2010, for Jervois Mining, 
on solutions generated from acid bake processing of Nyngan limonite drill core.  Bench 
scale work examined a number of potential solvent extraction organic reagents.  
Extraction efficiency and selectivity of scandium over a range of other elements was 
conducted across a range of pH values.  

This work identified Primene JM-T primary amine as the preferred solvent extraction 
organic reagent.  It was found to be quite selective for scandium over iron.  A series of 
isotherms was conducted at various organic strengths.  Examination of diluent to be 
mixed with the Primene JM-T showed little influence on extraction characteristics. 

Stripping kinetic tests showed that stripping was very rapid with 96% of the scandium 
being stripped in 30 seconds. 

Some limited phase disengagement work was conducted, showing that the Primene JM-T 
would have a reasonable probability of success. 

Subsequent pilot plant operation at Hazen Research in 2011, also on acid bake solution, 
confirmed the operation of the Primene JM-T system on a semi-continuous basis.  This 
pilot plant operated for ten days, on a 12 hours per day basis.  Prior to the pilot plant 
operation, Hazen Research conducted some bench scale work on both extraction and 
stripping solutions to identify the number of stages required. 

Operation of the pilot plant had the prime objective of scandium recovery.  Using 5% 
Primene JM-T, extraction resulted in raffinate levels of 1 to 3ppm scandium from a  
59ppm scandium feed.  For the 5% Primene JM-T concentration, loaded strip liquor 
achieved 800 to 900ppm scandium and almost 3 g/l iron. 

Bench scale work was conducted at Nagrom in Brisbane in 2015 to follow on from the 
Hazen work.  Initially this was commenced to further examine the strip solution 
composition after precipitation test work identified contamination of the scandium oxalate

precipitate during trials at SGS.  This work led to a new confidential strip liquor 
composition. 

Re-examination of the extraction and strip isotherms showed that two to three extraction 
stages would be required and only one to two strip stages. 

The work at Nagrom then proceeded to a six day, 12 hours per day pilot plant campaign, 
using synthetic PLS solution as the feed, as dictated by a comprehensive METSIM model 
of the flowsheet.  This model assumed that no pre-neutralisation of the PLS before 
extraction was required.  This not only provided confirmation of the Primene JM-T organic 
with a feed composition close to that expected for HPAL solution, but also confirmed the 
new strip liquor composition as being very effective. 

Extraction efficiency of > 99% was achieved, with raffinate regularly at 1ppm using a feed 
of 109ppm Sc.  The loaded strip liquor assayed in the range 2,200 to 3,000ppm, 
depending on the process variants being examined.  The first three days of operation 
were conducted with the solution composition from the original METSIM model, whereas 
the final three days used a slightly different composition.  Also at the three day mark, the 
regeneration stage was removed from the circuit, seemingly without any detrimental 
effect.  At the five day mark, the PLS composition was again changed to replicate a 
proposed process variant.  This was very successful and became the process flowsheet 
carried into the DFS design. 

Operation of the pilot plant was very stable and examination of the loading capacity of the 
organic used in the pilot plant campaign showed no significant deterioration over the six 
day period of the program.  The loading capacity was also unaffected by the removal of 
the regeneration stage for the last three days of the trial. 

13.3.3 Scandium Oxide Precipitation Test Work 

Precipitation of scandium compounds has largely focussed on the precipitation of 
scandium oxalate and its subsequent calcination to produce scandium oxide. 

Hazen Research examined precipitation of scandium using oxalic acid using the strip 
solution from the pilot plant SX trial.  Oxalic acid solution was added and the solutions 
held for three hours at 65°C.  A range of oxalic acid addition rates were examined, but 
were all high.  The lowest oxalic acid addition rate was 2.88 molar ratio to scandium and 
this produced 97.3% scandium oxide.  This was conducted on a feed solution of 1.65 g/l 
Sc and 14.5 g/l Fe, a much higher iron level compared to the DFS flowsheet. 

SGS conducted a number of scandium precipitation and calcination trials in late 2015.  A 
total of 23 precipitation trials were conducted from different feed solutions, at different 
temperatures, at various oxalic acid addition rates and using different neutralising agents 
or different acid levels.  The starting point for the work was a synthetic loaded strip liquor, 
with various additions of neutralising agents to set a free acid level prior to precipitation. 

The loaded strip liquor from the Nagrom pilot plant solvent extraction trials was used to 
conduct 12 precipitation trials.  These trials focussed on scandium oxalate precipitation

and examined process variables such as temperature and oxalic acid addition rates and 
were running in parallel to the SGS trials.  The latter six oxalate samples were further 
calcined to scandium oxide and were then washed and assayed. 

The scandium oxalate samples produced at Nagrom were much higher in grade than 
those produced at Hazen, SGS, and CSIRO.  The scandium oxalate purity approached 
99.9% at times and was always >99%.  When calcined to scandium oxide, an increase in 
impurity levels was experienced as the scandium oxalate lost mass in calcining.  
Procedures were developed for production of 99.9% scandium oxide purity and product of 
this purity has been produced.  At this level of purity, specialist analysis methods should 
be used for key elements, so the assaying of the small amount of sample was not 
considered to be absolute. 

13.3.4 Filtration and Residue Settling Test Work 

Dynamic and static settling tests have been conducted on the leach feed and leach 
residues in order to determine the likely thickener underflow tests.  Limited filtration tests 
have also been conducted but were deemed to be unsuccessful. 

Dynamic settling tests on the leach feed slurry showed that 40% underflow density was 
likely to be able to be achieved using Magnafloc 24 flocculant. 

Filtration tests on feed slurry resulted in poor filtration characteristics with the lowest 
moisture able to be obtained being 44%. 

Settling and filtration characteristics were conducted on HPAL discharge slurries.  An 
underflow density of only 31% was able to be obtained from a 5% thickener feed using 
Magnafloc 338 as the flocculant. 

13.3.5 Future Test Work 

The current research program has led to a conservative process engineering design at 
DFS level.  Further reductions in capital cost and operating cost could be possible if 
further development of the flowsheet was conducted.  This could include: 

 Further investigation of optimum conditions in the high pressure acid leach of the 
limonite, including further work at lower leach temperatures and slightly higher 
slurry feed densities. 

 Settling test work on hot HPAL slurries to improve the settled density in the CCD 
circuit, including a broader screening of flocculants and coagulants. 

 Work to further justify the removal of the regeneration stage in solvent extraction 
which appears to be unnecessary. 

 More work on the precipitation of scandium oxalate using real HPAL solution (not 
synthetic solutions) including further investigation into factors affecting product 
purity and recovery to solution.

 Further work on the calcination temperature for the oxalate and possible wash 
solutions to achieve even higher purity scandium oxide product. 

 Further investigation of the final neutralisation process to gain better 
understanding of chromium, magnesium and manganese deportments in 
particular. 

13.3.6 Flowsheet Implications 

In general, the test work program has shown that 87% recovery of scandium to solution 
from a 400ppm scandium-bearing limonite can be recovered in a conventional HPAL 
circuit.  Conventional CCD equipment can produce a solution in excess of 100ppm 
scandium as feed into solvent extraction.  A well-known primary amine solvent extraction 
organic can concentrate the scandium approximately 20-fold in conventional equipment 
and using common reagents.  The loaded strip liquor produced can produce high grade 
scandium oxalate which can be calcined and water washed to produce 99.8 to 99.9% 
scandium oxide utilising a single precipitation and single calcination stage.  The simplified 
schematic flowsheet is shown in Figure 13.2.

The solvent extraction and precipitation programs conducted in 2015 have resulted in an 
evolution of the flowsheet compared to that developed by other researchers in the 
following areas: 

 The extraction phase could be conducted successfully on HPAL discharge liquor. 

 Stripping was easily conducted with a low acid strip solution. 

 High purity scandium oxalate could be precipitated from the solvent extraction 
loaded strip liquor. 

 Calcined scandium oxide, approaching 99.9% purity can be produced using the 
process flowsheet that has been developed with 83.7% scandium recovery of 
scandium in feed to final product.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Previous Estimates 

An initial polygonal resource estimate on the Nyngan property was disclosed in a technical 
report entitled "Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project, Jervois Mining 
Limited, Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia" and filed on SEDAR in March of 2010.  
The resource estimate, and the methodology behind the estimate, was most recently 
updated in the NI43-101 Technical Report (PEA) with an effective date of October 2014, 
subsequently re-filed as an Amended Technical Report in May 2015.  The resources 
reported in these two Technical Reports are summarised in Table 14.1. 

Table 14.1 Previous Nyngan Project Mineral Resource Estimate 

 

Other than the February 2010 resource estimate described above, no other resource 
estimates have been reported for the project, prior to the release of this 2016 Technical 
Report. 

14.2 Source Data 

A source Microsoft Access database was supplied to Mining One by Rangott Mineral 
Exploration Pty Ltd (RME) that contained all previous drilling and assaying data for the 
Nyngan Project.  This database was used to derive the estimation of resources.  The

14.3 Density Measurements 

The 2010 polygonal resource estimate assigned density values that were derived from 
measurements taken at the nearby Young laterite (nickel) deposit.  During 2015, density 
measurements were taken from core samples drilled into the Nyngan project area.  The 
measurements were taken using the Archimedes method, which involves the 
measurement of loss of weight in water of the full core sample using an electronic 
balance.  The core samples were dried prior to being covered in lacquer, and then 
weighed.  These measurements are summarised in Table 14.3.

14.4 Lithological Domains 

Surfaces were constructed for each of the lithological domains, namely the base of 
alluvium, base of hematite, base of limonite and base of saprolite.  These surfaces were 
constructed using the geological logging data contained within the drill hole database.  
Sections string interpretations were created on 50 m spaced sections through the deposit 
as shown in Figure 14.5.

A digital terrain surface model (DTM) was then constructed from these strings to form the 
wireframe surface for each lithological type as shown in Figure 14.6. 

The lithological and topographic surface DTM's were then used to constrain the resource 
estimate and also to code the model for lithology type.

14.5 Drill Sample Compositing 

The median sampling interval contained within the drill database is one metre.  Given that 
one metre is the most common sampling interval and that the deposit is likely to be mined 
via open pit methods, a composite length was assessed as appropriate.  A summary of 
the composite file statistics for each of the lithological domains is shown in Table 14.5. 

The composite datasets for each lithological domain are also shown as histograms and

14.6 High Grade Outliers 

High grade outliers within the resource assay dataset can potentially lead to an 
overestimation of the block grades if not appropriately accounted for within the resource 
modelling process. 

Several methods are used to determine if high grade outliers require "capping", that is to 
decrease these grades back to the 95% confidence interval or by visually looking at the 
grade populations in probability and other plots. 

The assay data contained within the limonite domain indicates that the 95% confidence 
interval is at 633ppm Sc.  56 scandium assays are above 633ppm, which represents less 
than 5% of the total assay dataset.  Taking this into account and looking at the grade 
population distribution curves, it was not deemed appropriate to apply any grade capping 
to the dataset for the purposes of the resource estimation.

14.7 Variography & Estimation Search Parameters 

Variogram analysis was completed for each of the lithological domains.  The limonite and 
saprolite domains had sufficient sample pairs to allow for resolution of variograms.  The 
variogram model used for the limonite domain is shown in Figure 14.11.  The variogram 
parameters are also shown in Table 14.7.

14.8 Block Model Construction 

The block model was constructed in Surpac software with the parent block chosen based 
on the average drill spacing and potential open pit mining methods.  Sub blocking was 
also used to provide sufficient resolution along the contacts between the lithological 
domains.  The parameters used to construct the base block model are summarised in

14.9 Estimation Technique 

Given the style of mineralisation and supporting drilling data, it was assessed that 
Ordinary Kriging would be a suitable estimation technique.  An inverse distance estimate 
was also created to be used for model validation purposes. 

The lithological surface wireframes were used as hard boundaries to constrain the grade 
interpolation and the estimation was also constrained by the topography. 

14.10 Grade Interpolation Parameters 

Grades were estimated into the model using the one metre composite files created for the 
hematite, limonite and saprolite domains.  Three estimation passes were run for each of 
these lithological domains.  Details of the parameters used for each estimation pass are 
summarised in Table 14.10.

14.11 Resource Classification 

The resources were classified using a combination of the drill spacing and the confidence 
in the continuity of scandium grade and thickness of the modelled lithological domains.  
The variogram analysis shows ranges up to 80 m indicating sample correlation exists over 
that distance.  Drill spacing in the centre area of the deposit ranges between 25 m x 50 m 
and 50 m x 50 m.  This area is coded as measured and also exhibits strong continuity of 
mineralisation between drill holes.

The blocks within the area of the resource where the drill spacing is 100 m x 100 m has 
been coded as indicated.  Geological confidence is still high within these blocks, however 
the larger drill spacing is assessed as only supporting an indicated resource category. 

No inferred blocks have been coded into the model given that the boundary of the 
mineralised area is covered by a minimum of 100 m x 100 m spaced drilling and that the 
lithological model has not been extended outside of the area drilled to this spacing.   

The blocks were coded using three dimensional wireframes for the measured and 
indicated material as supported by the drill density and overall geological confidence in 
the mineralisation's continuity between drill holes. 

The resource categories coded into block model are shown in Figure 14.12. 

Figure 14.12 Resource Classification of Blocks – Plan View 

 

14.12 Estimation Results 

The results of the estimation indicate that the limonite domain contains 52.8% of the total 
resource tonnage at the highest grade using a scandium grade cut-off above 100ppm.  
The limonite domain is the focus of the estimation of project reserves.  Given the drill 
spacing and confidence in the continuity of the scandium mineralisation, it was deemed 
appropriate to state resources in the Measured and Indicated categories with no Inferred 
blocks.  A boundary was applied to the estimation however, to ensure that blocks were not 
estimated within areas of low geological confidence.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Introduction 

This Feasibility Study demonstrates that the Nyngan Scandium Project is economically 
viable, based on; mineral resources, production cost estimates, metallurgical recoveries, 
and market pricing estimates.  Based on these results, Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resources within the designed pits are considered Proven and Probable Reserves 
according to CIM Definition Standards.  The final reserves are reported at an effective 
cutoff of 155ppm scandium, which is the same for both mining pits.  This cut-off was 
chosen to maximise the Project NPV and IRR, and are not the same as the minimum 
economic cutoff applied to the resource estimates (100ppm Sc).  

This Reserve estimate has been generated using conventional mine optimisation and 
evaluation techniques.  Mining related cost data has been developed by Mining One, 
while all other economic inputs including processing costs, recoveries and sales data has 
been provided by Lycopodium and SCY.  Where data has been provided by third parties, 
Mining One have substantiated these estimates to ensure they are reasonable and 
consistent with the assumptions and findings in other sections of this Technical Report. 

15.2 Whittle Pit Optimisation 

The optimisation methodology adopted for the Nyngan Scandium Project used the 
resource model generated by Mining One, which contained mineable resource codes to 
which Whittle-specific fields were allocated, in preparation for an optimisation calculation, 
done in Gemcom's Whittle-4X optimisation software. 

Whittle-4X utilises a Lerchs-Grossman algorithm to calculate a suite of pit shells which 
enables the highest value shells to be identified for specified revenue factors, and  
ultimately enable the most economic pit to be identified.   Application of the  
Lerchs-Grossman algorithm is an industry-standard approach for defining an optimum 
open pit shape and development of a mining sequence.  The methodology relies on the 
preparation of a 3D block model to represent all parts of the mineralisation and host rock 
that can reasonably influence the pit shape.   

Whittle-4X structure arcs are used to define the precedence of block removal, such that 
any block cannot be considered for mining unless certain overlying blocks are also mined.  
This effectively defines the slope geometry for an open pit operation.  The optimisation 
then considers finding the combination of positive and negative cash flow blocks, 
consistent with the slope precedent rules, which are accumulated to find pit shell with the 
maximum positive cash flow. 

Three key parameters were optimised along with the pit dimensions and outputs, 
specifically: 

 A target scandium grade of 400ppm was set for each year's mining output, 
designed around a benchmark 75,000 tpy ore delivery requirement to the process 
facility.

 The mine production life was set at 20 years. 

 Additional borrow pits have been designed outside the economic pit optimisation, 
to generate waste material for construction of the residue storage facility and site-
required earthworks.  These pits have been captured as a construction cost and 
are reflected in the economic justification for the mine. 

15.3 Calculation Parameters 

The resource is divided into three mineral lithologies; hematites, limonites, and saprolites, 
and while each lithology contains economic scandium content above the resource cutoff 
grade of 100ppm, the different resource types have not all been evaluated economic.  
Hematitic and saprolitic ore types have potential future value however have not been 
assigned economic value in the preparation of these reserves.  These materials report to 
the mineralised waste dump which may have future economic value but the lack of 
processing data on these materials has resulted in this potential being excluded from the 
economic modelling.  For this reason, realizing optimum recoveries will require that these 
different resource types not be mixed together, specifically at the front end of the 
processing facility (autoclave). 

This Feasibility Study is based on processing limonite resource only for scandium, so the 
demonstration of economic viability with respect to establishing a Mineral Resource is only 
for that resource type.  The Feasibility Study considers a 20 year project life.  While the 
mineral resource totals suggest more capacity to produce product, and for longer periods, 
the planning, assumptions and economics have been constrained to 20 years of 
production, and on a relatively small scale of mining and processing.   

This assumption also represents limiting parameters on establishing the Mineral Reserve 
estimate. 

This assumption also represents limiting parameters on establishing the Mineral Reserve 
estimate. 

The selected mining strategy includes the following general factors: 

 Mining will be done on a campaign basis, over a 20 year assumed life. 

 Mining will employ open pit mining methods, utilising a conventional truck – 
excavator technique. 

 Plant ore feed will only be limonite resource, averaging 409ppm scandium over 
the planned mine life. 

 Material characteristics and geotechnical considerations have been included into 
the design parameters. 

 Consideration has been given to topographical characteristics and lease 
boundaries which may affect mining, surface infrastructure, waste dumps, and 
stockpile locations and dimensions.

 The mine pits have been designed with consideration to the impact on the 
environment, including minimising tree line disturbance. 

 The construction of surface infrastructure supplement pit waste material from 
within the optimised pit footprint, with borrow-pit waste material, which will then 
serve as pre-strip activity for mining beyond the current mine life. 

15.4 Cut-off Grade Equations 

The mineral reserve estimate for the Nyngan Scandium Project is based on two open pit 
designs and predicated on a US$2,000 /kg scandium oxide price.  The operating cost 
assumptions are in general alignment with feasibility study estimates for limonite resource. 

The cut-off grade applied to the mineral reserve is effectively 155ppm.  This 155ppm  
cut-off was applied as a constraint parameter to the Whittle pit optimisation work to ensure 
an annual head feed grade of 400ppm.  It served to exclude the lowest grade levels of 
limonite resource from the 20 year production model and enabled realization of the  
400ppm target grade production in certain years.  Hematite and saproloite lithologies have 
been excluded from all cutoff grade assumptions.  A total of 19,500 t of limonite ore 
representing 3% of the total mineralised waste stockpile failed to meet cutoff and blending 
parameters.  

15.5 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Using the NI 43-101 updated Mineral Resource Estimate that is a part of this Technical 
Report, a new Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve of 1,436,000 t is established at a 
grade of 409ppm scandium, for the Nyngan scandium property.  Estimated mineral 
reserves have been presented in Table 15.1.

Notes: 

1)  The Mineral Reserve is as of April 15, 2016. 

2) All Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with CIM standards as prescribed by the National 
Instrument 43-101. 

3)  Mineral Reserves were estimated using the following mining and economic factors: 

a. A 2% dilution factor and 97.5% recovery was applied to the mining method; 

b. Wall angles of 37 degrees for the West pit and 33.5 degrees for the East Pit;  

c. A Scandium Oxide (Sc2O3) price of US$2,000/kg 

d. An overall processing recovery of 83.2% for scandium oxide from the process facility 

4) The Mineral Reserve calculation effectively employed a cut-off grade of 155ppm elemental scandium, which is 
above the economic cut-off grade, and allows Whittle to achieve an average ROM grade of +400ppm for the life of 
mine. 

5)  Mineral Reserve Estimates were prepared under the guidance of Dean Basile who is a Principal Engineer at

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 General Overview 

The Nyngan scandium deposit is considered a surface-mineable deposit, with an overall 
strip ratio approximating 3.4:1, depending on specific areas mined, and which portions of 
the resource material is being mined for production.  The mine design has been prepared 
by Mining One Consultants (Melbourne) and has been developed using industry 
recognised analysis techniques including pit optimisation using Whittle-4X and Surpac 
mine planning software.  All earthworks will be carried out using a mining contractor on a 
campaign basis, and mining will be carried out using selective truck and excavator mining 
methods.  Campaigns will typically be conducted three times each year for the 20 year 
mine life. 

Four key parameters have been applied to the mine plan to maximise project value: 

1. The mine plan is limited to a 20-year duration, recognising that this timeframe 
utilises less than 12% of the total measured and indicated resource contained in 
the resource model. 

2. The mine plan targets delivery of only limonite resource to the processing facility, 
the processing route designed in this Feasibility Study is tailored for limonite-only 
production, at a 75,000 tonnes of ore per year (tpy) feed rate. 

3. The pit optimisation achieved an optimised shell approximating 100 years at the 
scheduled ROM feed rates.  For the purpose of this study and to align with the 
economic life of the processing assets the pit shell approximating 20 years of ore 
production at a feed rate of 75,000 tpy was selected as the basis for the pit 
design.  An overall head grade of over 400ppm was achieved for this shell.  

4. The optimisation identified two discrete mining areas to which a western and 
eastern pit design was developed.  While these represented the optimum pit 
designs the pits will be over excavated to source material for the construction of 
the Residue Storage Facility.  These cutbacks are referred to as borrow pits and 
the costs associated with these pits have been captured as sustaining capital in 
the economic analysis. 

These four external variables to the mine planning / optimisation process created two 
associated mining activities, not specifically related to the primary task of delivering 
scandium resource material to the processing facility.   

 The head grade target and limonite-only restriction applied to the reserves 
resulted in other grade-bearing material being deposited onto a mineralised 
waste dump.  This includes low grade limonite ore, scandium bearing hematite, 
and saprolite ore.  A total of 620,000 t of mineralised waste at a grade averaging 
200ppm will remain at the end of the 20 year mine life.  Further work is required

to determine the economic viability of this material and therefore no economic 
value has been assigned to this potential asset.  

 The two pit mining strategy generates significant waste, but not enough to meet 
the 20 year infrastructure requirements for capacity expansions of the Residue 
Storage Facility.  As a result, additional borrow pit material is excavated from 
around the pit area and used to meet the needs of the Residue Storage Facility 
construction and all waste material is consumed by site infrastructure.  No waste 
dump will be required for the project.  

 These two mining-related activities represent value to the Project beyond the 20 
year term, in the form of a potential stockpiled resource for processing and pre-
strip value for future mining areas.  The borrow pits have been located based on 
the outlines of pit shells that were generated by the optimisation project which will 
reduce the pre-strip demands on any future cutbacks to the pit.  The cost of these 
activities has been absorbed in the 20 year Feasibility Study economics and the 
potential future value has not been recognised. 

16.2 Mine Development and Optimisation Process 

A systematic approach was undertaken to deliver a balance between the three target 
parameters of head grade, annual production and waste movement.  Mine design, 
planning and scheduling to an optimised development plan is an iterative process to 
ensure all options are reviewed and the selected scenario will provide the desired outputs 
for the project.  The mine design and scheduling process followed for this Project is 
illustrated in Figure 16.1.

16.3 Mine Pit Optimisation - Overview 

Industry recognised pit optimisation practices were used to identify the optimum pit to 
mine, based on the mineral inventory provided from the Mineral Resource database.  The 
digitised mineral resource block model database from Surpac software was imported into 
Gemcoms' Whittle-4X mine optimisation software, where a full evaluation of the resource 
was conducted to identify the pit shell design that balanced the highest NPV value against 
the required 20 year throughput target for the processing facility.  

16.3.1 Pit Optimisation using Whittle-4X Software 

The Project resource model was the source of mineable resource blocks to which Whittle -
specific fields were allocated in preparation for the optimisation in Gemcom's Whittle-4X 
optimisation software.  Whittle-4X calculates a suite of pit shells which enables the highest

value shells to be identified for specified revenue factors, which ultimately enable the most 
economic pit to be located within the ore body.  This is achieved based on a given set of 
mining, metallurgy and economic parameters. 

Whittle-4X software drives its optimisation calculations by applying the Lerchs-Grossman 
algorithm; an industry-standard approach for defining an optimum open pit shape and 
development of a mining sequence.  The methodology relies on the preparation of a 3D 
block model to represent all parts of the mineralisation and host rock that can reasonably 
influence the pit shape.  The individual resource blocks are assigned a revenue value, 
which then initiates an optimised sequencing and selection of blocks based on various 
cost factors. 

Whittle-4X structure arcs are used to define the precedence of block removal, such that, a 
block cannot be considered for mining unless certain overlying blocks are also mined.  
This effectively defines the slope geometry for an open pit operation.  The optimisation 
then considers finding the combination of positive and negative cash flow blocks, 
consistent with the slope precedent rules, which are accumulated to find pit shell with the 
maximum positive cash flow. 

Whittle-4X software has capabilities to vary mineral pricing and other cost parameters to 
create nested pit shells that inform mine planners how to revise mine plans as mineral 
prices change with time.  In this case, prices were considered stable and the 20 year mine 
life assumption on a much larger potential resource limited the value of planning around 
more marginal resource blocks. 

16.3.2 Block Model 

The Mineral Resource Model (nyngan_scandium_dec2015.mdl) was constructed in 
Surpac software and was used as the basis for the Whittle block model.  Section 15 of this 
report summarises the process to generate the resource model.  The resource block 
model was imported into Whittle software package using the user / parent block size of 
25m x 25m x 5m.  This enabled a reasonable resolution to be achieved for the pit shells. 

Several checks were undertaken to validate the block model to ensure all data was 
imported correctly: 

 The block extents were checked to ensure the block model was adequate for the 
optimisation, this involved checking maximum and minimum values. 

 The model was checked to ensure no null values existed in the model. 

 Grade distributions were checked to ensure there were no abnormal values in the 
model. 

 Ore totals were checked and validated against the resource statement. 

 Field values were checked to ensure all required fields existed within the model.

Prior to the Whittle Pit Optimisation, the block model was modified to ensure there was 
sufficient data for the optimisation, this primarily involved the inclusion of fields to enable 
the economic evaluation to be undertaken.  Several attributes / data fields were created in 
the block model as required for the Whittle process as follows: 

Rock Type Code 

The 'wtype' data field was added to the block model as a 'Whittle rock type' code to 
identify ore and waste blocks.  An ore block, within this context, simply means that Whittle 
will treat the block as ore if revenue exceeds or equals the cost of mining the block and is 
based on economic data specific to the recover and sale of Scandium oxide. 

The basic assumptions to differentiate rock types were as follows: 

 'AIR' was assigned to the blocks above the topographic surface (topo = 1). A 
block that was partly below the topographic surface was classified either as a 
Waste Block or a Potential Ore Block. 

 'WSTS' was assigned to the blocks with zero Scandium grades. 

 All blocks with over 0% Scandium grade were classified as potential ore blocks. 

 The rock type was also differentiated by Resources Classification so the 
optimisation outputs could be grouped based on the resource classification.  

Other Modifying Factors 

 'gtzone' – a code for geotechnical zones, this enables different slope angles to be 
specified for various face orientations to ensure the geotechnical parameters are 
met. 

 'mcaf' – the Mining Cost Adjustment Factor, is the factor is to adjust the mining 
cost based on the depth of mining.  MCAF is used in Whittle to represent the 
mining cost adjustment as mining progresses deeper. MCAF acts as a multiplier 
on a reference mining cost. 

 'mcaf' – the Mining Cost Adjustment Factor, is the factor is to adjust the mining 
cost based on the depth of mining.  MCAF is used in Whittle to represent the 
mining cost adjustment as mining progresses deeper. MCAF acts as a multiplier 
on a reference mining cost. 

 'pcaf' – the Processing Cost Adjustment Factor is similar to MCAF, PCAF is 
assigned to differentiate processing cost based on the bench or pit location. 
PCAF acts as a multiplier on a reference processing cost.  A default value of one 
was used in the block model.

16.3.3 Whittle Optimisation Parameters and Process 

The processing assumptions, cost operating parameters, and commodity price were 
identified and validated for input into the Whittle program.  These economic values were 
derived from detailed economic modelling of the proposed mining and processing 
methodologies. 

A summary of the input parameters and assumptions used to develop the Whittle base 
case (mining, processing, and selling costs) are presented in Table 16.1.

With the Whittle inputs selected from the Surpac resource block model and the mining and 
costing parameters identified and established, the software was run in iterative form to 
establish both a life-of-mine pit outline and sequence and a 20 year mine life pit design to 
meet the criteria of the feasibility study. 

Lithology codes were used to tag the ore and waste materials with only the limonite ore 
being assigned economic value.  Hematite and saprolite ores were ignored by the Whittle 
software and assigned zero economic value (ie. treated as waste).  To ensure the 
targeted head grade of 400ppm was achieved the cut-off grade was modified until this 
head grade was achieved.  An artificial cut-off grade of 155ppm scandium was adopted as

this was the lowest cut-off grade to deliver the desired head grade.  This ensured the 
Whittle optimisation did not attempt to optimise near surface low grade ore. 

The economic head grade for this project approximated 120ppm so the artificial cut-off 
was significantly higher than the natural cut-off grade. 

Upon completion of the Whittle output, a validation process was carried out to confirm that 
the optimisation process used the correct data and parameters.  In addition, the Whittle 
formula inputs were derived from the base formulas confirming that the Whittle output was 
valid and consistent.

The following validation routine was undertaken:  

 Rock tonnes comparison between Surpac and Whittle (see Table 16.3). 

 Block value check in Whittle. 

 Internal peer review. 

Based on the results from the checks that were carried out to validate the Whittle model, it 
was concluded that there were no significant flaws in the Whittle model and the model 
was considered valid for further mine planning.

The business objective required a pit design that delivered 20 years of feed to the 
processing plant at a rate of 75,000 tpy.  Based on this criterion, pit shell 3 was been 
selected as the basis of the pit design.  As illustrated in Figure 16.3 it can be seen that the 
selected shell is significantly smaller than the optimum shell.

covering the entire 8.9 Mt measured and indicated limonite resource.  The shell that met 
the 20 year mining criterion (shell 3) was then selected as the template for the pit design.

16.4 Mine Pit Final Design and Layout 

16.4.1 Design Criteria 

Following the pit optimisation process, pit designs were fitted to the shells based on the 
design criteria determined by the geotechnical assessment of the site.  Two separate pits 
were designated as the western and eastern pits.  The western pit is the larger of the two, 
and is sequenced such that mining commences in this pit first, as it is physically closer to 
the Residual Storage Facility and the processing plant.  This location minimises early 
period costs associated with the initial Residue Storage Facility construction, the 
production haulage costs and it provides time to address environmental offsets for access 
into the eastern pit. 

Pit design parameters were based on geotechnical recommendations from work 
completed by Knight Piésold Consulting (Feb 2016: BR801-00286 TDR M16001).  The 
waste dump was designed based on estimated slope parameters provided by Mining One. 

The overall pit design was aligned with the geotechnical design criteria with the benches 
being designed to meet the slope design specifications outlined in Table 16.6.  The final 
20 year outlines on the western and eastern pits are shown in Figures 16.5 and  
Figure 16.6, respectively.

To ensure the pit designs were in line with the Whittle shells upon which they were based, 
a comparison of the relative quantities between the Whittle shell and the pit designs was 
prepared to ensure the design was within the accepted tolerances.  Table 16.7 illustrates 
that the pit design carried approximately 3.7% more material than the Whittle shell.  This 
is considered to be within acceptable limits as allowances for roads and berms must be 
factored into the discrepancy.

16.5 Mining Scheduling Overview 

The scheduling process for each mining pit involved sequential bench design, calculation 
of ore and waste quantities by bench, and resource grades by bench, using Surpac 
software and the resource database.  In-pit resource mining was then scheduled using 
Geovia's software.  Head grades were then calculated for the resource delivered to the 
process facility ROM stockpile, based on a mine recovery parameter of 97.5%, and a 
dilution factor of 2%.  Logical mine bench sequencing was then determined, based on 
delivery requirements for both ore and waste.  The schedule was refined over a number of 
runs to deliver 75,000 t of ore at a grade approximating 400ppm for each year of 
operation.  

Loss and dilution of 2.5% and 2.0% respectively was applied to the schedule, these 
dilution estimates were calculated using dilution modelling.  Dilution modelling applied a 
250 mm skin across the target resource and then calculated equivalent loss and dilution 
estimates based on this skin being mined as part of the target material.  The low numbers 
achieved for this exercise are the result of mining within the larger life of mine ore 
boundary, such that most of the dilution material carried economic grade.  

The mine is considered a relatively low volume operation, with annual total waste/ore 
production varying between 700,000 tpa the early years down to 100,000 t in later 
production periods, as depicted in Figure 16.9.

The 20 year mining schedule incorporated both the western and eastern pit designs, with 
the western pit developed first.  No interim pits were designed, as the pit geometry 
provided little space for stage plans to be developed.  The start-up profile for the operation 
was to ramp up scandium feed to the process plant over the initial two years of operation, 
reaching nameplate throughput in year three of 75,000 tpy, as shown in Table 16.8, at a 
400ppm head grade.

years 6 to 20 on an annual basis.  It should also be noted that the 400ppm head grade is 
sustained over the 20 years of operation. 

Figure 16.10 ROM Ore Tonnes and Scandium Grade (ppm) 

 

The resource data and optimisation software generated pit shells in two areas where in-
situ limonite grades generally averaged 400ppm.  The limonite is shallow in these areas 
and shows good continuity at good mineable widths.  Given a longer mine life assumption, 
the two separate pits would ultimately converge into one, as can be understood from 
Figure 16.4.  The majority of the resource material is in the measured category in both of 
these two mine pits, further increasing confidence in the data supporting the selection 
points. 

The schedule maintained an average scandium grade of approximately 409ppm for the 
life of the mine.  Mining tonnages are shown by year over the 20 year production period in 
Table 16.9, and scandium grades (ppm) of resource mined and delivered to the 
processing plant facility or the low grade stockpile are shown by year in Table 16.10.

Limited ground water data was available at the time of preparing this report, however the 
December 2011 groundwater study prepared by Impax group (IMPAX; 2011) was 
considered in the preparation of this report.  Minimum groundwater is anticipated on the 
basis of the Impax report for the proposed pit designs. 

16.7 Mine Waste Handling and Management 
 
The Nyngan resource sits close to the surface with a low overall strip ratio, and as a result 
the mining process does not generate adequate waste to meet the volume demands for 
required site infrastructure.  All waste generated by mining activity will be consumed by 
the construction of various site facilities, the biggest of which is the Residue Storage 
Facility.  It is unusual for a surface mine to not require a waste dump facility, but this mine 
as designed will not require one. 

Figure 16.16 and Table 16.12 provide a summary of the waste balance between the 
scheduled waste movement and overall infrastructure demands. 

Figure 16.16 Cumulative Mining Waste Generation – 20 Year Project 

 

The alluvium waste will be removed by excavator and loaded into trucks, where it will then 
be transported directly to site infrastructure works, to minimise any double handling costs.  
The single largest demand for construction materials will be for the Residue Storage 
Facility, which requires significant material during mine development, but also requires 
significant material for capacity expansions throughout the 20 year life of the Project.  
Infrastructure material demands during initial site development also relate to construction 
of a number of water catchment ponds, mine roadways, and berms, which are required 
across the lease.  Great care was taken to align waste removal schedules with the

The waste movement generated by mining activity can sustain infrastructure requirements 
until the start of year nine, after which time waste material will have to be sourced from 
borrow pits. 

The borrow pits have been located within the footprint of future economic mining areas, in 
order to allow the waste material movement to contribute the future development of the 
resource.  The borrow pit design consists of three phases, illustrated in Table 16.13, 
included is an overview of the development timeline.

 Cumulative Volume (BCM) Year 

Phase 1 377,185 9 to 11 

Phase 2 1,390,213 11 to 15 

Phase 3 3,004,476 15 to 20 

 

The three borrow pit phases have been designed primarily to meet the capacity expansion 
needs of the Residue Storage Facility in the later years of the mining operation.  The final 
borrow pit volume also provides additional capacity to cater for variations in the material 
balance.  This also provides a waste resource for capping at the end of mining if required.  
The batter angle on all borrow pits was flattened to 18° to minimise the need for landform 
contouring at the end of mining.

16.7 Mineralised Waste Dump 

There are several material types within the pit areas that contain scandium grade but are 
not suitable for processing simultaneously in the scandium recovery circuits.  Most of the 
surface hematite and underlying saprolite resource fall in this category and if they need to 
be mined they will be stored on the mineralised waste dump.  While this material typically 
carries economic scandium grades, these resources do not lend themselves to the current 
recovery method and therefore are currently considered uneconomic.  This material may 
have future value if an economic method of recovering the scandium with a plant 
configuration that is optimised for this type of material is developed in the future. 

The mineralised waste dump (low grade resource stockpile) has been configured to hold 
300,000 bcm of mineralised waste material and designed to accommodate a 20% swell 
factor.  This was considered sufficient to accommodate the mineralised waste from both 
mining pits for the 20 year planned life of the Project.  The dump has been strategically 
located within the tailings dam catchment area so that any runoff from this dump is 
returned to the site water balance. 

The total volume of low grade mineralised waste estimated to be placed in the low grade 
dump over the 20 year planned Project life is summarised in Table 16.14.

16.8 Mining Activity Detail 

Mining, haul road maintenance, and waste removal are planned to be carried out by a 
contractor, who will work three to four campaigns each year to maintain adequate 
inventory on the ROM.  The contractor will likely operate on a dayshift-only basis, however 
this will be dictated by the contractor who will be paid on a schedule-of-rates basis.  The 
primary earthmoving equipment will be a small excavator loading articulated dump trucks.  
While this equipment is not the most cost effective, the ease with which it can be 
mobilised and demobilised from site fits with the campaign strategy outlined for the 
project.  Additionally, the all-wheel drive nature of articulated trucks will lend themselves to 
mining the clay materials encountered at site. 

There are three basic materials being handled from the two mining areas - waste, ore and 
mineralised waste (low grade or off-spec resource).  Each material has been scheduled to 
different locations for the determination of equipment and cost calculations: 

 High Grade Ore:  All limonite ore that is scheduled to be blended to meet the 
400ppm scandium head grade target will be hauled from the respective pit to the 
processing plant run-of-mine (ROM) pad.  Material will be stockpiled at the ROM 
pad and a processing plant loader will rehandle the material into the plant feed 
bin. 

 Mineralised Waste:  This consists of a number of materials but this material will 
be stockpiled on a single mineralised waste dump which is located between the 
western pit and the Residue Storage Facility.  It is anticipated that during the 20 
years of planned mining a total of 390,000 bcm (614,000 t) of this material will be 
stockpiled.  Material scheduled to this dump includes: 

- low grade (<155ppm Sc) limonite resource 

- all saprolite resource 

- all resource-bearing hematite material (not all hematite material contains 
scandium over 100ppm). 

 Waste:  All material classified as waste will be directly transported to the relevant 
infrastructure location for final placement.  Excavation of the pit and construction 
of the infrastructure will occur concurrently, to eliminate double handling.  For 
costing purposes, all material has been calculated to be hauled to the base of the 
residue storage facility where an overall cost has been applied and factored into 
the construction cost.

16.8.1 Contractor Mine Responsibilities 

The campaign mining program will utilise local contractors whenever possible.  To ensure 
the economics of this approach, four local contract companies were approached to 
provide pricing on the site works.  To provide context for proper and comparable bids, 
each contractor was provided with a contract framework and a responsibility matrix.  The 
key areas outlined in that responsibility matrix included: 

 Staff:  All operational personnel including a Mine Manager, mining supervision 
and maintenance supervision are to be provided by the contractor.  Survey, 
grade control, environmental and processing personnel are the responsibility of 
EMC-A. 

 Labour:  All equipment operators and mine maintenance personnel to be 
provided as a part of the schedule of rates.  This included personnel to support 
pit de-water / pumping operations while on site. 

 Mine Planning:  Mine planning is to be prepared by EMC-A, with plans adhered 
to by the contractor.  The contractor will be responsible for leaving the mining 
area in a safe state at all times.  Bench clean-up and surface preparation, 
including drainage, is the responsibility of the contractor. 

 Geology: All geological work will be conducted by EMC-A.

 Survey:  To be provided by EMC-A, although control to be maintained by the 
contractor. 

 Geotechnical:  All technical advice and design criteria to be provided by EMC-A.  
The contractor will be responsible for excavating the pit in accordance with the 
design, and managing local geotechnical issues. 

 Administration:  The contractor will be required to provide monthly production 
reports and attend production meetings while they are operating on site. 

 Communications:  The contractor is to provide adequate communication 
infrastructure, including two-way radio coverage in the mining area. 

 Accommodation:   Contractor is to include accommodation overheads as a part 
of the contract rates. 

 Transport and Mobilisation:  All logistics are to be managed by the contractor, 
and a fixed mobilisation and demobilisation cost is to be identified as part of the 
bid. 

 Haul roads:  Major haul roads will be constructed by EMC-A, but will need to be 
maintained by the contractor whilst on site.  The contractor will need to manage 
all in pit roads. 

 Dewatering:  Contractor to manage dewatering assets while on site.  This 
includes excavation of sumps and relocation of dewatering pipe work.  EMC-A 
will provide a pump, to be installed by the contractor at the end of each mining 
campaign. 

 Safety:  Contractor to comply with EMC-A standards in all respects.  Contractor 
to provide operational procedures for the mining area which is to include drug 
and alcohol management, pre-employment checks and operational procedures.  
Contractor to provide safety statistics as required, and within EMC-A reporting 
timelines, as a part of mine management safety monitoring and reporting. 

 Equipment:  The contractor is to supply all mobile equipment for the excavation 
of the pits and transport of waste to the infrastructure sites.  The number of fleet 
vehicles and capacities will be dictated by the schedule. 

 Infrastructure:  The contractor will provide all facilities to provide the earthwork 
services including any offices, workshops and warehousing facilities required by 
the contractor to complete their on-site tasks. 

 Maintenance:  All mobile maintenance is to be done by the contractor. 
Maintenance areas must comply with all environmental and legislative 
requirements, along with any standards set by EMC-A for the overall project.  It is 
expected that any major equipment repairs will be done off site.

Contractors provided costs for the service and these were validated against each other to 
ensure the mining rates were competitive and within an acceptable range.  From this 
exercise, Neill Earthmoving was selected as the basis for all economic assumptions for 
cost estimations.  This contractor was considered as it is anticipated the campaign mining 
strategy will require a contractor that is close to the operation to ensure mobilisation and 
demobilisation penalties are kept at a minimum as well as to assist in developing a strong 
presence with the local community. 

Neill Earthmoving provided a mobilisation and demobilisation cost as well as a schedule 
of rates based on commonly adopted rise and run estimates.  Their rates were based on a 
base production rate of 350 bcm per hour which was based on their local knowledge as 
well as a number of test excavations that they had been involved in at the Nyngan site.  
An additional contingency was added with a dozer employed to support the excavator. 

The mining fleet will typically be a small excavator, suitable for loading articulated dump 
trucks.  This will be supported by a fleet of graders, water carts and dozers which will 
ensure roadways and material handling strategies are maintained. 

Drill hole data combined with consultation with personnel involved in the excavation of 
preliminary test areas indicates that the ground will predominantly be free dig and 
therefore no drilling or blasting will be required.  The pits extend to a maximum depth of 
50 m and will be excavated in a weathered clay horizon which should lend itself to a free-
dig strategy. 

To ensure minimal delays to the excavation process an allowance has been made for a 
dozer to provide ripping services for 35% of the operating time.  This has been factored in 
at a rate reflecting Neil Earthmoving day rates. 

16.8.2 Topsoil Management and Storage 

The site will initially be cleared of topsoil which is 300 mm in depth.  The topsoil will be 
pushed up and stored in stockpiles out of the way of the operation as illustrated in  
Figure 16.24.  The western pit area will be cleared first as this provides the bulk of the 
waste for the construction of the initial infrastructure.  Topsoil will be removed in stages 
and only as required for developing the respective area of the mine.

The western pit area will be cleared first as this provides the bulk of the waste for the 
construction of the initial infrastructure.  Topsoil will be removed in stages and only as 
required for developing the respective area of the mine.  

16.8.3 Geotechnical Parameters 

The western pit will be mined by cutting down to ore in the southern end of the pit and 
then advancing to the north.  This will require an in-pit face to be developed.  This face will 
be maintained at a face angle that exceeds the recommended overall slope angle of 37 
degrees to ensure the batter angles are maintained at a safe overall face angle. 

Mining of the eastern pit will use a top down approach and therefore all faces will be 
dictated by the final pit angles as described in Section 15 of this report. 

16.8.4 Pit Dewatering Considerations 

A groundwater assessment prepared by Impax group (IMPAX; 2011) was used as the 
reference for determining the impact of ground water on the project.  Based on this 
document and the relative depth of the pit designs, ground water is not anticipated to have 
a major impact on the project.  According to the report the following observations were 
made: 

 There was no groundwater activity recorded in any of the test holes for the 
alluvium overburden and therefore no groundwater is anticipated during the 
excavation of the waste overburden.

 If mining occurs at a depth of greater than 30 m below ground level then they are 
likely to encounter water-bearing strata.  The potential rate of groundwater inflow 
to the open pits would depend of the area of aquifer exposed in the pit walls 
and/or pit base and the depth of excavation. 

 Groundwater in the upper four meters of the subsurface at the Project site is of 
poor quality and relatively low yielding.  Use of groundwater within a 10 km radius 
of the Project site is limited. 

The depth of the two pits will be 50 m and 45 m for the western and eastern pit 
respectively and while inflows are anticipated for the later 20 m of excavation, the inflow 
rates will be low.  Dewatering will be achieved by an in-pit dewatering pump with up to  
40 L/s capability to manage minimal groundwater volumes as well as surface catchment.  
The dewatering strategy will entail establishing a mobile dewatering pump at the base of 
the pit, installed at the end of each mining campaign.  The pumps will be started on a 
regular basis to draw down any accumulated water, between mining campaigns. 

The water will be discharged into a surface holding pond specifically for mine water.  This 
water will be cycled back to the plant for use in the recovery process.  The water balance, 
as prepared by Knight Piésold for this report, indicates that the water balance across site 
is negative, indicating that most of the mine water that does accumulate in the mine pits 
during inactive periods will be needed for and consumed by the recovery process. 

16.8.5 Regional Rainfall Details 

Historic rainfall records for the Nyngan area have been recorded and tabulated by the 
Bureau of Meteorology.  This data is available online, and was used to determine the 
rainfall trends in the region.  

The original intention was to campaign mine during the dryer months, to minimise wet 
condition impacts on field operations. Upon closer review, the data shows less opportunity 
for this scheduling opportunity than first anticipated.  Nyngan is subject to relatively 
consistent rainfall events throughout the year, as is depicted in Figure 16.25.  While the 
monthly median rainfall does range from an average low of 16 mm in April, to an average 
high of 37 mm in January, each month tends to have a wet three to four days of rain at 
some point.  Obviously, it is the heavy rain events that are best avoided in a production 
period.   

Discussions with local contractors indicated that only a handful of these rainfall events 
would result in a full day of lost production and many rainfall events would occur at night 
time as well.  The schedule will require some flexibility to weather that may not be planned 
out very far in advance.

16.8.6 Mining and In-Pit Grade Control 

At a daily process plant feed rate of 240 tpd, it is desirable to campaign mine and 
stockpile the mined material several times during the year, rather than attempt to maintain 
and operate an even smaller mining fleet throughout the year.  It is envisaged that 25,000 
to 30,000 t of scandium-bearing material will be mined during each campaign.  Because of 
the clay content of this material, the stockpile will be either contoured and compacted to 
minimise water ingress or covered by tarpaulins to prevent water absorption.  The mining 
strategy will minimise stockpile quantities by only mining the required ore quantities during 
each mining campaign.   On this basis, the required ROM capacity is relatively small, at 
50,000 t maximum. 

This stockpile strategy will be heavily dependent on the in-pit grade control methodology, 
including taking ore grade samples from each truck load that is delivered to the ROM.  
Better grade control in the pits will minimise the ROM stockpile quantities, along with any 
blending / re-handle needs from the ROM to the plant feed system. 

Mining technique will be tailored to address the importance of grade control.  Mining will 
be conducted on shallow mineralised lenses or flitches, typically of 2.5 m thickness.  In-pit 
grade control will be carried out on each flitch to ensure overall grade control of the 
mineralised zone. 

The in-pit sampling will occur at the end of each mining lense, and will involve a ditch 
witch cutting ditches at 5 to 10 m intervals through the exposed ore.  These ditches will be 
sampled and sent away for assaying so that delineation of the orebody can be done prior

to the next mining pass through the pit, or the next campaign.  This will enable time to 
process samples as well as minimise grade control delays to the excavation process. 

For stockpile grade control, each truck load will be assayed via a grab sample.  It is 
envisioned samples representing 100 t of material will be consolidated and used to 
validate grade control conditions.  This secondary grade control will be used to develop an 
understanding of the variance in the in pit grade control process and then be used to 
refine this process.  If the in-pit process proves to be robust then over the longer term it is 
envisioned that the stockpile testing could be removed from the overhead. 

There is opportunity to introduce in-pit assaying using hand held measuring tools, 
however this technology has not been proven and will be tested during the inception of the 
mine.  This may represent a significant cost saving if proven reliable, however for the 
purpose of this study a more traditional approach has been adopted and therefore there is 
upside in all grade control estimates if such methods prove successful. 

It is envisioned that in the longer term that assaying will be done on site, however for the 
purpose of generating an accurate economic estimate in this report all assaying has been 
evaluated using offsite commercial services.  

Mill process test work done to date indicates that consistent grade control regarding mill 
feed is necessary to ensure that performance is maintained.  While in-pit grade control is 
likely to be taken from 1 m trenches, the mining of ore would ideally be done on 2.5 m 
benches.  While a majority of the ore is predicted to be mined by this bulk method it is 
believed that some portions of the ore body may require more accurate mining techniques 
than others, and therefore a 20% mining premium has been added to the cost of mining 
ore to allow for more selective techniques to be adopted.  This also allows for dilution 
control. 

16.8.7 Electrical Power to Site  

Electrical power supply to the mining operations and associated infrastructure will be 
minimal as the contractor will be operating on a campaign basis.  All contract pricing has 
been based on the premise that the contractor provides all site power using portable 
power generation.  If power off-take is practical, then this will be factored into a detailed 
contract agreement as to leverage a better schedule of rates. 

16.8.8 Contractor Workshop Facilities 

Need for these facilities is expected to be minimal.  All major scheduled maintenance to 
contractor equipment is to occur off site.  While operating on site, the contractor will 
provide any relevant infrastructures to maintain equipment, and to warehouse any 
necessary parts / components to ensure mobile equipment productivity.  Field servicing 
should be practiced, and minimised. 

The mining contractor will be responsible for the provision of any office facilities required 
to deliver the mining service.  Technical contractors such as the grade control and survey 
personnel will utilise temporary desk space at the processing facility while at site.

16.8.9 Camp Accommodation 

The mine is located approximately 20 minutes from the town of Nyngan and therefore no 
accommodation facility is planned for the project.  All contractors and consultants will be 
responsible for providing their own accommodation within the local township or within a 
distance deemed suitable for a safe commute to the mine site.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Design 

The process flowsheet selected as the study basis for the treatment of the Nyngan ore 
body has been chosen after evaluation of the available geology, mineralogy and 
metallurgical testwork results (see Section 13).  The objective has been to select a robust 
treatment method that provides a sound basis for estimating capital and operating costs at 
a definitive feasibility study level of accuracy. 

17.1.1 Selected Process Flowsheet 

The process plant for the Nyngan Scandium Project will treat the scandium bearing 
limonite mineralisation from Nyngan to produce a scandium oxide product.  The flowsheet 
consists of: 

 Recovery of ore from mined stockpiles using a front end loader. 

 Adding the mill feed to a hopper and then onto a conveyor. 

 The lightly crushed mineralisation then is slurried with process water in the drum 
scrubber and then into a trommel screen. 

 The slurry from the trommel screen underflow falls into a hopper and is pumped 
to the ball mill circuit, via the cyclone feed hopper, in order to further break up 
clay material.  The trommel screen overflow is stockpiled as coarse rejects. 

 The slurry from the ball mill discharges into the cyclone feed hopper and then 
pumped to a series of cyclones.  Cyclone overflow passes to the leach feed 
thickener.  Cyclone underflow (+75 µm) is returned to the feed chute of the ball 
mill. 

 The leach feed thickener increases the solids density in the underflow to 38% 
solids.  Leach feed thickener overflow is returned to the ore preparation circuit via 
the leach feed thickener overflow tank and associated pumps.  The leach feed 
thickener underflow is pumped to the HPAL feed storage tanks. 

 Leach feed thickener underflow is combined with a proportion of the returned 
solvent extraction raffinate (approximately 20% of the raffinate stream) in one of 
two HPAL feed slurry storage tanks to achieve the nominal feed solids density of 
30% into the autoclave.  

 Feed from the HPAL feed slurry storage tanks is passed through the HPAL feed 
slurry heater where it is heated in a heat exchanger with excess high pressure 
splash steam. 

 Preheated HPAL feed slurry is further heated in three stages of splash vessels 
using flash vessel vent steam before being pumped with high pressure pumps

into the autoclave, where additional HP steam is added to raise the temperature 
to 265°C.  Concentrated sulphuric acid is also added to the autoclave with a high 
pressure pump.  Slurry density inside the autoclave is designed at 25% solids. 

 The slurry is depressurised in three stages of flash vessels with letdown steam 
recirculated back to the corresponding splash vessels.  Any excess steam is 
vented to atmosphere via the HPAL vent scrubber. 

 The leach slurry, containing the dissolved scandium, is passed through an eight 
stage counter current decantation (CCD) circuit to wash the entrained scandium 
from the leach residue.  The wash solution is a mixture of raw water, solvent 
extraction raffinate and dirty condensate streams from the flash vessels and pre-
heaters. 

 The pregnant solution from the CCD circuit containing the scandium is cooled, 
filtered in one of two sand filters and sent to solvent extraction for recovery of the 
scandium. 

 Solvent extraction of scandium occurs by contacting the PLS with an organic 
phase containing a primary amine (Primene JM-T) dissolved in a kerosene 
(Shellsol D70) in three counter current extraction stages.  A scandium sulphate 
complex ion leaves the aqueous phase and loads onto the amine.  The organic 
phase is then washed with a dilute sulphuric acid scrub solution. 

 Stripping the scandium from the Primene JM-T is conducted by contacting the 
loaded organic phase with a hydrochloric acid solution, boosted with extra 
chloride salt addition.  The scandium enters the aqueous strip liquor as a 
scandium chloride complex ion.  

 The stripped organic is regenerated with dilute sulphuric acid solution before 
being recirculated back to the extraction stages. 

 The loaded strip liquor is filtered through a garnet anthracite filter and then a 
carbon column before being heated to 65°C in the LSL tank. 

 Solution from the LSL tank is withdrawn in 6 m³ batches on day shift operations 
and the scandium is precipitated by adding oxalic acid solution to the tank and 
stirring for 15 minutes. 

 The scandium oxalate precipitate is filtered in a plate and frame filter press.  The 
scandium oxalate is added to rotating kiln furnace and calcined to scandium 
oxide at 900°C, before being washed with deionised water and filtered.  The 
scandium oxide is then dried and dispatched in small security drums. 

 The residual slurry from the CCD circuit is partially neutralised with lime slurry to 
pH 2 and then sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) is added to convert any Cr (IV) in 
solution to Cr (III).  More lime slurry is added in two stages to raise the pH to 9 in 
order to precipitate any heavy metal ions from solution.

 The neutralised tailings slurry is thickened and sent to a conventional lined 
residue storage facility (RSF).  Decant from the RSF is re-used as process water.

17.1.2 Mass Balance 

A mass and water balance for the processing plant has been developed.  Because of the 
complex hydrometallurgical process flow sheet, this was developed using METSIM 
software.  Whilst as many inputs into the METSIM model were made on information from 
relevant metallurgical test work, at times some assumptions were made.  These were 
largely process chemistry related or related to thickener underflow densities where test 
work did not exist or is not reliable. 

Mass and water balances external to the process plant were not included in the METSIM 
model.  The process mass and water balance have been reported for the 75,000 t/a 
nominal feed rate.  The mass balance represents a nominal steady state design case and 
has been used to determine the plant design conditions in treatment of the Nyngan ore. 

The mass and water balance is the basis for the design and specification of equipment 
that have been used to determine the plant layout and the capital cost estimate.  In 
addition, they allow for the development of schedules for operating requirements, such as 
power, water, reagents and consumables used to calculate the plant operating cost 
estimate.

17.2 Process and Plant Description 

The major plant areas for the Nyngan Scandium process plant are as follows: 

 Ore Preparation. 

 Leach Feed Thickening and Storage. 

 High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL). 

 Counter Current Decantation (CCD). 

 Solvent Extraction (SX). 

 Scandium Oxalate Precipitation. 

 Scandium Oxide Recovery. 

 Final Neutralisation and Tailings. 

 Reagents. 

 Services. 

17.2.1 Ore Preparation 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0001 and 0002  

Scandium bearing ore will be recovered from the Nyngan mine using open pit mining 
techniques and trucked to a run of mine (ROM) ore stockpile. 

Material will be reclaimed from the ROM stockpile using a front end loader and added to a 
feed bin.  A belt feeder then feeds ore from the bin onto a conveyor which delivers ore to a 
trommel scrubber to de-agglomerate the ore.  The +10 mm oversize from the scrubber is 
rejected to a coarse rejects bin.  The -10 mm material is directed to the ball mill discharge 
sump. 

The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with cyclones being fed from the cyclone feed 
hopper via pumps.  The +75 μm oversize from the cyclone underflow is directed back to 
the ball mill feed chute.  The overflow from the cyclones is directed to the leach feed 
thickener. 

17.2.2 Leach Feed thickening and Storage 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0003 and 0004  

The Leach Feed Thickener will thicken the slurry to 38% solids with the aid of flocculant 
addition.  The underflow from the thickener will be pumped to the HPAL Feed Slurry 
Storage Tanks.  Slurry from the tanks is then pumped to the LP Splash Heater.  Excess

HP Splash steam from the HPAL circuit will be used to pre-heat this slurry to 80°C via the 
use of a spiral heat exchanger.  Leach Feed Thickener overflow is re-used in the ore 
preparation circuit. 

17.2.3 High Pressure Acid Leaching 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0005 to 0008  

The HPAL circuit consists of a continuous high pressure autoclave with three stages of 
preheat and letdown.  

The preheated HPAL feed slurry is further heated in three stages of splash vessels using 
flash vessel vent steam before being pumped with high pressure pumps into the 
autoclave, where additional HP steam is added to raise the temperature to 265°C.  
Concentrated sulphuric acid is also added to the autoclave with a high pressure pump.  
Slurry density inside the autoclave is designed at 25% solids.  Scandium and other metals 
are extracted from the solids under these leaching conditions. 

The slurry from the autoclave is depressurised in three stages of flash vessels with 
letdown steam recirculated back to the corresponding splash vessels.  Any excess steam 
is vented to atmosphere via the HPAL vent scrubber. 

Any emergency pressure relief from the splash, autoclave and flash vessels is directed to 
the HPAL Vent Knockout Pot.  

The slurry from the LP Flash Vessel gravitates to the Flash Seal Tank, prior to pumping to 
the CCD circuit. 

The HPAL circuit also contains all necessary agitator seal and flush systems, along with 
pump HP gland water circuits. 

17.2.4 CCD Circuit 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0010 to 0013 

The leached slurry from the HPAL circuit, containing the dissolved scandium, is passed 
through an eight stage counter current decantation (CCD) circuit to wash the entrained 
scandium from the leach residue.  Each CCD thickener will thicken the slurry to 31% 
solids with the aid of flocculant addition, prior to being pumped to the next thickener in the 
circuit.  The wash solution (added to CCD No.8) is a mixture of raw water, solvent 
extraction raffinate and dirty condensate streams from the flash vessels and pre-heaters. 

CCD No.1 overflow reports to the solvent extraction (SX) circuit as pregnant liquor (PLS), 
whilst CCD No. 8 underflow is pumped to the final neutralisation circuit.

17.2.5 Solvent Extraction 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0014 to 0018 

CCD No. 1 overflow solution (PLS) forms the basis of the solution feed into solvent 
extraction.  The PLS is filtered and then cooled and stored in the PLS Storage Tanks.  
The PLS is pumped from these tanks to the first of three counter-current Extraction Mixer-
Settler Units.  Scandium is extracted from the PLS by contact with an organic extractant 
dispersed in a solvent kerosene product.  When contacted together, the scandium 
transfers from the aqueous phase to the organic phase.  The solution that is stripped of 
scandium (raffinate) is passed through activated carbon columns to remove any entrained 
organic phase and then returned to various areas of the HPAL and CCD circuits. 

The loaded organic is scrubbed with a dilute sulphuric acid solution in the Wash Mixer-
Settler to wash the organic phase.  The washed organic is then pumped to the first of two 
counter-current Strip Mixer-Settler Units.  Scandium is stripped off the organic phase of 
scandium with a diluted hydrochloric acid solution boosted with chloride.  The resulting 
loaded strip liquor (LSL) is then passed through a dual-media filter to remove any 
entrained organic phase before passing into the scandium recovery circuits.  The stripped 
organic phase is regenerated with dilute sulphuric acid solution in the Regeneration Mixer-
Settler and then returned to the extraction circuit. 

In the unlikely event of a fire occurring, within the solvent extraction mixer-settlers and/or 
the solvent extraction tank farm and bunded area, fire fighting foam is provided from a 
Foam Fire Suppression system. 

Crud will be removed from the Mixer Settlers units on an as-needs basis, by a mobile air-
operated pump system.  The crud will be pumped to a collection tank for processing 
through the crud treatment circuit.  This circuit will also treat entrained organic from after-
settlers, along with spillage into SX sumps. 

17.2.6 Scandium Oxalate Precipitation  

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0019 and 0020  

The loaded strip liquor (LSL) is the feed product for scandium oxalate precipitation.  The 
LSL is filtered to remove entrained organic form the SX circuit prior to storage in the 
Loaded Strip Liquor Tank.  Heated LSL is added in a batch process to the Oxalate 
Precipitation Tank, where oxalic acid solution is added to precipitate scandium as 
scandium oxalate.  After completion of the batch process, the precipitate is pumped to the 
Scandium Oxalate Filter for filtration and collection of washed scandium oxalate solids.  

At the end of the filtration cycle, the Scandium Oxalate Filter is opened and the filter cake 
discharged into the Oxalate Filter Discharge Cart.  This cart is then manually delivered to 
the Scandium Oxalate Rotary kiln.

17.2.7 Scandium Oxide Recovery and Packaging 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0020 and 0021 

The scandium oxalate solids are added to the Scandium Oxalate Rotating Kiln and 
calcined to form scandium oxide at 900°C, before being washed with deionised water to 
remove impurities and then filtered.  The scandium oxide is then dried at 120°C, cooled, 
then manually loaded into the Scandium Oxide Storage Hopper.  The Scandium Oxide 
Screw Conveyor will fill the final product drums.  These drums are located on a Weigh 
Scale for final product mass measurement.  Samples of each batch of oxide are taken and 
the batch number is recorded on each of the product drums. 

The areas located near dry scandium oxide operations are ducted into the Drying Oven 
Bag Filter for hygiene purposes and to recover any valuable scandium oxide dust.  The 
contents of the Dust Collector Bin are periodically manually returned to the Oxalate 
Precipitation Tank. 

17.2.8 Final Neutralisation and Tailings 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0023 to 0025 

The residual slurry from the CCD circuit (CCD No.8 underflow) is pumped to the final 
neutralisation circuit.  The slurry is partially neutralised with hydrated lime slurry to pH 2 
followed by addition of sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) to convert any chromium in solution 
as Cr (IV) to Cr (III).  Additional hydrated lime is added in two stages to raise the pH to 9 
in order to precipitate any heavy metal ions from solution prior to tailings disposal. 

The neutralised tailings slurry reports to the Final Neutralisation Thickener where it is 
thickened to 31% solids with the aid of flocculant addition.  The thickener underflow is 
pumped to the Final Tails Surge Tank and then subsequently pumped to the Residue 
Storage Facility (RSF).  The RSF is a conventional lined slurry storage pond.  Thickener 
overflow is pumped to the process water tank for re-use in the plant. 

Supernatant from the RSF is directed to the Decant Pond for storage prior to returning to 
the process plant for re-use as process water. 

A lined evaporation pond is included in the plant infrastructure for evaporation of excess 
process water, and/or other saline waters from the process plant.  

17.2.9 Reagents 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0026 to 0029 

The major reagents utilised within the process plant will include: 

 Concentrated sulphuric acid for the high pressure acid leach circuit and solvent 
extraction circuit.

Raw Water, Filtered Water and Fire Water 

Raw water requirements for the process plant will be made-up from both reclaimed water 
from the mine pit and sediment pond, along with from the pipeline that services both the 
Nyngan and Cobar townships.  A Raw Water Pond with 30 days of storage will be 
constructed.  The majority of the raw water will be filtered for various uses.  Raw water will 
also be used to supplement the process water requirements, along with hydrated lime 
slurrying.  

Raw water will undergo filtration and then be stored in the Filtered Water Tank.  Filtered 
water will be distributed to all non acidic process water uses, including reagent make-up, 
gland water, cooling water make-up, potable water make-up and feed to the RO treatment 
plant. 

Firewater will be supplied from the raw water storage pond, via a dedicated suction 
manifold.  The firewater system will comprise: 

 An electrical jockey pump. 

 An electrical firewater pump. 

 A diesel standby firewater pump. 

The firewater system pressure will be maintained by the jockey water pump.  An electric 
fire water pump will automatically start on a drop in line pressure.  The diesel fire water 
pump will automatically start if the line pressure continues to drop below the target supply 
pressure, which will occur when there is significant fire water demand or during a power 
failure. 

Process Water 

Final Neutralisation thickener overflow and RSF decant return provide the source of 
process water.  Any make-up requirements to the process water circuit will be from the 
Raw Water Pond.  

Process water is used for a number of services including: 

 Ore preparation dilution water. 

 Vent Scrubber solution make-up. 

 Mine water requirements. 

 Flocculant dilution water. 

 Dust suppression. 

 Service points around the plant.

Demineralised Water 

Demineralised water will be produced from the Reverse Osmosis (RO) treatment facility.  
It will primarily be used as boiler feed supply for HP steam production.  Other uses include 
mixing and/or dilution of reagents used within the SX and scandium precipitation circuits 
to achieve high product purity, along with make-up to the HPAL agitator seal water circuit. 

Gland Water 

Gland water will be filtered water.  Dedicated gland water pumps will supply gland seal 
water from the Filtered Water Tank to the required pumps across the process plant. 

Potable Water 

Filtered water will be pumped to the Potable Water Treatment Plant for production of 
potable water for the process plant site.  From the treatment plant it will be stored in the 
Potable Water Tank.  Potable water will be distributed for human consumption across the 
site, and to the safety showers and eye wash stations throughout the process plant. 

17.2.11 Air and Steam Services 

PFDs 3185-000-PRPFD-0033 to 0034 

Plant Air and Instrument Air 

Plant and instrument air at 700 kPag will be provided by two high pressure air 
compressors, operating in a lead-lag configuration.  Instrument air will be fed from the HP 
Air Receiver and dried for subsequent instrument air demand.   

LPG Storage and Distribution 

Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will be delivered to site in bulk and transferred to a storage 
bullet on site.  LPG will be used as the fuel source to operate the steam boiler. 

Steam Generation 

HP Steam will be generated from the Boiler Package.  Saturated steam at 280°C and 
6,300 kPa will be produced and used for slurry heating in the HPAL circuit. 

17.3 Process Plant Layout 

The layout for the Nyngan Scandium process plant is shown in Figure 17.2.  Equipment 
has been sized according to scale as per the detailed mechanical equipment list 
developed for the feasibility study. 

More detailed layouts of various areas of the process plant were developed for estimating 
of structural steelwork and concrete quantities.  The High Pressure Acid Leaching area is 
shown in Figure 17.3 and the Solvent Extraction area is shown in Figure 17.4.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Access and Haul Roads 

The Site Access Road from the Barrier Highway to the plant side is planned as an all-
weather, unsealed two lane road suitable for use by light and heavy vehicles.  The road 
has been designed to a width of 10.5 m that would provide dimensional adequacy for two 
loaded semi-trailer trucks to pass safely.  The planned road elevation is slightly above the 
natural ground surface and appropriate road-side drainage would be constructed due to 
the propensity of flooding during periods of heavy rain.  It is likely that a "Crown Road" 
easement will be acquired for the road.  The road will be used for accessing the plant by 
operating and maintenance personnel, supply of reagents and consumables and transport 
of product.  A mine haul road will be constructed for the short distance from the mine to 
the process plant site.  This road would have a width of 10.5 m to allow safe haulage 34 
tonne road haul trucks and bunding to 50% of the tyre height.  Plant roads are to be built 
within the plant boundary and will be all weather gravel roads. 

It is planned that the plant personnel will be housed in existing accommodation in Nyngan 
and will drive the approximately 20 km to and from site every day. 

18.2 Power Supply 

18.2.1 Installed Load and Maximum Demand 

The installed load and maximum demand for the site is shown in Table 18.1.  The 
maximum demand is calculated for a half hour window and represents the minimum 
supply capacity required for the site. 

Table 18.1 Plant Power Demand

TSF / Infrastructure 190 kW 67 kW 60 kW 

Totals 3,247 kW 1,479 kW 1,294 kW 

 

18.2.2 Power Supply 

The site will be supplied at 33 kV via a connection to an existing overhead powerline, 
running adjacent to the Barrier Highway through existing farm land, located 2.5 km north 
of the site.  The overhead powerline is owned by Essential Energy and a preliminary 
connection request was lodged as part of the feasibility study.  A subsequent response 
from Essential Energy has been received confirming the viability of a 1.6 MW supply 
capacity, subject to the following line upgrade / modification works being undertaken by 
the Proponent as part of the project.

 Conductor replacement (re-stringing) of 19 km of the existing overhead line 
between the Nyngan townsite 22/33 kV step-up transformer yard (NYGS) and the 
mine take-off. 

 Installation of isolation transformers to three existing spur SWER (single wire 
earth return) overhead lines along the upgraded line section. 

 Provision of temporary generation to consumers during line outages. 

From the mine take-off point, a 2.5 km 33 kV overhead spur line will be constructed down 
to the plant site, running adjacent to the site access road easement.  This will then 
terminate at the site HV switchboard providing the Essential Energy battery limit and utility 
metering. 

Of note from the preliminary discussions with Essential Energy is that the present 
proposed site electrical loads are close to the maximum capacity that their network can 
support on this existing 33 kV overhead line.  Should the load increase significantly in the 
future due to process expansion then it is highly likely that further upgrades to the town 
substation would be required or preferably a new connection to the nearby 66 kV 
overhead line would be established.  Neither option has been explored in depth in this 
study due to the significant capital outlay they present for no present operating benefit.  
Implementation timing for both options would likely be in excess of 24 months given the 
challenges in dealing with the Essential Energy and coordination of significant grid 
outages. 

18.3 Electrical Distribution 

The electrical system for the Project is based on 33 kV high voltage distribution and 415 V 
drive voltages.  System frequency is designed at 50 Hz. 

The site High Voltage (HV) switchboard will be located on the north edge of the 
administration area with all connecting supply cabling installed underground in conduits. 

The HV switchboard primarily supplies the process plant distribution transformer, a  
2,500 kVA 33 kV / 415 V step down transformer to supply all process and local 
infrastructure requirements.  A second feeder also supplies an overhead powerline 
system on the site which reticulates power to the decant pond, tailings storage facility and 
mine services contractors yard via a combination of pole top and skid mounted step down 
transformers.  The overhead line length is approximately 2.3 km and will be strung with 
Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) to facilitate connection of remote facilities via fibre optic. 

To prevent equipment damage and extended downtime following power outages, the site 
process plant drives have been split into non-essential and essential services.  All 
essential services are capable of being powered by a standby generator which will start in 
the event of a power failure.  The generator is nominally rated at 1000 kVA and self 
bunded with fuel capacity for 24 hours run time.

18.3.1 Electrical Switchroom / Control Room 

The process plant is based around a single electrical switchroom which houses two LV 
Motor Control Centres (MCC), Process Control System (PCS), Variable Speed Drives 
(VSD) and operator control room.  Based on the equipment requirements, approximate 
dimensions for the switchroom have been calculated at 45 m long x 4.5 m wide.  The 
room would be transported in two sections and joined onsite via an open walkway. 

The switchroom is sealed for dust ingress and will be supplied complete with air 
conditioning, Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and fire detection system. 

The switchroom will be mounted on 2 m high steel pedestals to facilitate cable installation 
below the switchroom and bottom entry connection to the internal equipment through 
gland plates.  Entry to the rooms will be via stairs and access platforms constructed at 
each end and in the middle. 

18.3.2 Transformers and Compounds 

All 33 kV / 415 V distribution transformers will be of ONAN (non-fan forced) cooling 
configuration and vector group Dyn11. 

The process plant transformer will be installed into a bunded compound, sufficiently 
spaced from the switchroom, standby generator and other structures so as to avoid 
requirements for fire rated blast wall. 

Field distribution transformers for the stormwater pond and mine services contractors' 
yard are 100 kVA 33 kV / 415 V and will be pole mounted on the overhead powerline. 

Due to the incremental construction and stage lift methodology for the residue storage 
facility, the transformer and decant pump MCC will be skid mounted and connected to the 
overhead powerline via a trailing cable.  Subsequent lifts to the decant causeway, will only 
require disconnection / removal of the skid and coiling up of the trailing cable whilst the 
works are undertaken.  Following completion of the earth works, the cable shall be 
uncoiled and the skid reinstalled at the new lifted height. 

18.3.3 HV Switchboards 

The site HV switchboard is a SF6 gas insulated fixed switchgear type installed into a 
raised outer enclosure.  The board is provided with an incoming circuit breaker and 
metering cubical for utility tariff metering.  The board is non-extendable and provided with 
a single future feeder for future potential process plant additions. 

The design fault level and circuit breaker ratings adopted are: 

 33 kV switchboard busbar 630 A, 20 kA at 1 seconds. 

 33 kV circuit breakers  630 A. 

Protection will be provided by microprocessor based protection relays.

18.3.4 Electronic Variable Speed Drives 

LV variable speed drive (VSD) units range up to 75 kW and will be powered from the LV 
MCCs.  These units will be installed along the internal wall of the electrical switchroom or 
internally to the field MCCs at the stormwater pond and tailings dam. 

18.3.5 415 V Motor Control Centres 

The LV MCCs will be double-sided and housed in the electrical switchroom.  Construction 
of all MCCs is based on Form 4 segregation, Type 2 co-ordination.  Starters in MCCs will 
be of demountable design and main incoming circuit breakers will be of withdrawable 
design complete with protection.  Motor starters up to 90 kW will be equipped with thermal 
overload protection and electronic protection will be used for all larger drives.  The LV 
MCCs will supply power to the low voltage motors, low voltage variable speed drives and 
low voltage distribution boards. 

18.3.6 Fire Protection 

The electrical switchroom will be provided with local fire detection systems consisting of 
Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA) sampling for the LV MCCs.  Signals 
from the fire detection system will be wired to the respective Fire Indication Panel (FIP) in 
the switchroom and all signals will be monitored by a master fire detection panel (MFIP) in 
the Administration Building.  Each FIP will also be wired to a local siren with beacon to 
warn staff of the fire detection. 

18.3.7 Earthing System and Lightning Protection 

The earthing system within the plant will be designed in accordance with relevant 
Australian Standards.  The following method of system earthing will be implemented at 
various voltage levels: 

 33 kV Resistance earthed via Essential Energy. 

 415 V Solidly earthed system / Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN) / T-N-C-S. 

Lightning protection will be provided for buildings and structural steel as appropriate.  
Structural high points will be fitted with lightning masts of sufficient height and quantity to 
ensure that all exposed points will be covered as per 'Rolling Sphere Method' of AS 1768.  
Lightning protection systems will have their own independent earthing electrodes and will 
be interconnected with the power earthing system. 

18.3.8 Electrical Field Installation 

Cable ladder will generally be laid horizontally, with vertical ladders used in areas where 
spillage may occur.  The central plant pipe rack will accommodate the primary cable runs, 
with multiple cable ladders used to segregate between power, control and instrumentation 
cabling.  Sun cover will be provided over the top level of all cable ladder to provide 
protection against UV damage to cables and plant spillage.  All cabling will be affixed with 
stainless steel cable ties on vertical runs and nylon on horizontal.

Plant lighting will be designed in a fit for purpose manner to suit the operational 
requirements of the plant.  Ten metre high area flood lighting towers will provide general 
access lighting around the feed preparation and infrastructure areas.  Process areas and 
staircases will be fitted with traditional break-back lighting poles and fixtures. 

Cables of different voltage groups will be installed on separate ladders.  If they need to be 
installed on the same ladder, then complete segregation of the ladders will be provided.  
Ladder routes will follow the mechanical pipe racks. 

The scandium precipitation plant and solvent extraction modules have both been identified 
as areas with electrical hazardous areas.  The field installation in both areas will utilise 
intrinsically safe instrumentation and hazardous area 'Ex d' rated flame proof enclosures 
for all terminal boxes and control stations. 

18.4 Control System 

18.4.1 General Overview 

The general control philosophy for the plant will be one with a high level of automation and 
remote control facilities.  Instrumentation will be provided within the plant to measure and 
control key process parameters. 

The main control room, which will be located within the electrical switchroom, will house 
two PC based operator interface terminals (OIT).  Two additional servers will also be 
located here to act as the control system supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) servers in a redundant configuration.  The control room is intended to provide a 
central area from where the plant is operated and monitored and from which the 
regulatory control loops can be monitored and adjusted.  All key process and maintenance 
parameters will be available for trending and alarming on the process control system 
(PCS). 

The process control system that will be used for the plant will be a programmable logic 
controller (PLC) and Citect SCADA based system.  The PCS will control the process 
interlocks and PID control loops for non-packaged equipment.  Control loop set-point 
changes for non-packaged equipment will be made at the OIT. 

18.4.2 Field I/O 

All instrumentation and field controls will be captured by the PCS via remote I/O modules, 
generally located at each process module of the plant, primarily to minimise the extended 
cable run lengths back to switchroom.  These remote I/O modules are electrical field 
enclosures housing power supplies, network equipment, marshalling terminals and PLC 
remote I/O nodes.  All remote I/O nodes will be linked to the PLC via a PCS Ethernet 
network, supported over the site fibre optic cabling between switchroom, remote I/O 
modules and key infrastructure buildings.

18.4.3 Drive Control 

In general, the plant process drives will report their ready, run and start pushbutton status 
to the PCS and will be displayed on the OIT.  Local control stations will be located in the 
field in proximity to the relevant drives.  These will, as a minimum, contain start and latch-
off-stop (LOS) pushbuttons which will be hard-wired to the drive starter.  Plant drives will 
predominantly be started by the control system in automatic operation. 

The OITs will allow drives to be selected to Auto, Local, Remote or Out-of-Service modes 
via the drive control popup.  Statutory interlocks such as emergency stops and thermal 
protection will be hardwired and will apply in all modes of operation.  All PLC generated 
process interlocks will apply in Auto and Remote modes.  Process interlocks will be 
disabled or bypassed in Local mode with the exception of critical interlocks such as 
lubrication systems on the mill.  

Local selection will allow each drive to be operated by the operator in the field via the local 
start pushbutton.  Remote selection will allow the equipment to be started from the control 
room via the drive control pop-up.  Status indication of process interlocks as well as the 
selected mode of operation will be displayed on the OIT. 

18.4.4 Control Loops 

Regulatory control loops will be provided for all key process circuits to provide optimal 
functionality without regular operator intervention. 

There will be two modes for loop controlled set points available in the OIT.  These are 
'Loop Auto Mode' and 'Loop Manual Mode'.  In Loop Auto Mode (analogous to cascade 
control), the set point will be predominantly controlled by the applicable 'master' PID loop 
(e.g. for thickener underflow pumping control, the bed pressure PID controller output will 
supply a set point for the thickener underflow flow control loop which ultimately controls 
the speed of the thickener underflow pump).  In Loop Manual Mode, set point may be 
entered manually from the loop set point pop-up in the OIT. 

Where required, analogue set points from the PCS to vendor supplied control panels can 
be done either via the OIT or via vendor control panels. 

18.5 Communications 

18.5.1 Network Topology 

The onsite communications network is designed around a site wide fibre optic backbone 
which will be shared by all services.  This will minimise cabling and related 
communications equipment and be installed in underground conduits, cable tray and via 
the overhead powerline OPGW.  The services that will use the common fibre optic 
backbone include: 

 Corporate LAN including telephony (Voice over Internet Protocol – VoIP). 

 Plant Control System.

18.5.2 External Connectivity 

To provide external connectivity to the site, a high speed wireless link will be installed to 
communicate to the National Broadband Network (NBN).  This is presently being rolled 
out through regional NSW and is expected to be provisioned to Nyngan town site in 2016 
by way of new hardware installed on the existing mobile phone tower.  This solution offers 
the lowest capital and operating expenditure compared to traditional high cost dedicated 
fibre optic links with Telstra and is ideally suited to the minimal site numbers. 

18.5.3 Server / Computer Infrastructure 

Corporate servers, network switches and a firewall will be installed onsite to support the 
users locally, with the expectation the Proponent will implement a VPN link to any remote 
central office as required.  An allowance of 20 computers, a mixture of workstations and 
laptops, has been made along with required software and office equipment such as 
docking stations, monitors, photocopiers and cabling. 

18.5.4 Voice Services 

The site voice service is based on the implementation of a Voice over IP (VoIP) system.  
An allowance has been provided for provision of 20 desk phones, plus reception and 
meeting room conference phone.  Supporting server infrastructure and software will be 
installed on the site servers.  The system will function over the high bandwidth site link to 
the NBN.  The site also receives mobile phone coverage and an indoor booster for the 
main office has been included. 

18.6 Water Supply and Onsite Water Management 

18.6.1 Water Supply Source 

Water will be provided to the site by connecting to one of the two parallel pipelines which 
runs adjacent to the Barrier Highway, some 5 km from the raw water storage pond at the 
processing facility.  The pipelines are owned and operated by the Cobar Water Board, 
which was established to supply bulk water to the Cobar Shire Council and local mining 
companies. 

The Board's principal source of water is the Bogan River at Nyngan, where water is stored 
in a series of pools known as the Bogan Storages.  The storages are formed by a weir 
(the Overshot Weir) and several earthen embankments.  The Bogan River is an 
ephemeral stream, and is generally inadequate to meet the needs of the Board, Nyngan 
town and approved irrigators.  

Security is better assured by a connection to the Macquarie River at Warren through the 
Albert Priest Channel.  This channel is an approximately 70 km long earth channel and 
was constructed in 1942.  The channel discharges flows into the upper reaches of the 
Bogan Storages. 

From Nyngan, the Board pumps water through parallel pipelines some 130 km to a  
1.14 ML reservoir at Fort Bourke Hill, Cobar.  Hermidale booster pumping station, located

mid-way along the pipelines, is in operation to increase the rate of flow to assist in the 
transfer of water.  

In 2014 and 2015, approximately 4,600 ML of water was pumped through these pipelines. 

A new 160 mm diameter HDPE pipe is planned to tie into the existing pipeline, be fitted 
with an isolation valve and be buried alongside the new access road to fill a site based 
raw water storage dam of 15 ML capacity.   The 160 mm line will be of sufficient size to 
cater for a potential fourfold expansion of the processing plant without the need for further 
upgrade (subject to available spare capacity in the supply pipeline). 

The raw water dam will be an earthen dam with a balance cut-to-fill "turkey's nest" 
construction. 

The average daily demand for raw water for the plant will be approximately 0.8 ML, and 
the raw water dam will hold approximately 18 days of storage.  An on-site storage buffer is 
recommended as a protection against potential supply outages in the Cobar Water Board 
infrastructure. 

The annual demand for raw water will be approximately 260 ML.  In order to ensure the 
project has access to sufficient water in times of supply cutbacks, EMC intend to purchase 
high security water licences for twice the anticipated annual requirement.  This will also 
cover supply system losses of the Albert Priest Channel and the Bogan Storages. 

EMC-A have confirmation from the Cobar Water Board that an application for a Major 
Consumer connection for this project would be considered favourably. 

18.6.2 Water Balance Modelling  

A detailed water balance model was developed for the site with a daily time step.  
The water balance model was run under average, 1 in 100 ARI dry and 1 in  
100 ARI wet climatic conditions.  The average results indicate that between 19% 
and 42% of the process demand is provided by water recovered from the RSF, 
with annual water demand from Cobar water service pipeline of up to 19% of the 
total process water demand. 

Under 1 in 100 ARI dry conditions, the predicted water shortfall increases 
significantly (by three to six times) compared to the average conditions.  The 
highest shortfall would be in year 20, with approximately 163,700 m3 of water 
needing to be obtained from the Cobar water service pipeline.  

Under 1 in 100 ARI wet conditions, no plant shortfalls are anticipated other than 
during year one when a shortfall of 6,300 m3 would be required from the Cobar 
water service pipeline.  However, the water volumes within the RSF pond, event 
pond, external decant pond and evaporation pond do not exceed their defined 
capacities under wet conditions.  As such, no uncontrolled water releases should 
occur.

18.6.3 On-site Water Storages 

Several on site water storages have been designed to manage the different 
classes of water onsite including raw water feed, sediment laden water and 
process or contaminated water.  These storages have been designed by Knight 
Piésold with details of the designs provided in the Residue Storage and Water 
Management Report prepared by Knight Piésold (Knight Piésold, 2016). 

External Decant Pond 

Supernatant water removed from the surface of the RSF will be pumped to a decant pond.  
The decant pond is a paddock style facility which abuts the southwest embankment of the 
RSF.  The design storage capacity of the external decant pond is 85 ML with an additional 
0.6 m freeboard.  This design capacity provides sufficient volume on top of the maximum 
normal operating pond to allow the runoff generated by a 1 in 1,000 year ARI 72 hour 
rainfall event on the RSF to be stored, whilst retaining sufficient freeboard to store a  
24 hour PMP event.  No spillway has been provided for this facility as it has no external 
catchment and the freeboard is sufficient to store the 24 hour PMP event.  Based on the 
geochemistry of the supernatant, the decant pond includes a robust liner system, 
comprising 1 mm HDPE, underlain by a flownet drainage layer and secondary 1.5 mm 
HDPE liner.  The secondary HDPE liner is then underlain by a 300 mm compacted clay 
liner consisting of conditioned in-situ material or imported clay from other development 
areas. 

Evaporation Pond 

The evaporation pond is required to store spent process solutions which are not 
appropriate to recycle.  The evaporation pond is a paddock style facility which abuts the 
west embankment of the decant pond.  The design storage capacity is 25 ML with an 
additional 0.9 m freeboard which is sufficient capacity to store rainfall from the 72 hour 
PMP event.  This is a conservative flood storage allowance to account for uncertainty 
relating to the volume of salt which will accumulate in the facility and the likely high 
concentration of metals.  Based on the geochemistry of the process solutions, the 
evaporation pond includes a robust liner system, comprising 1 mm HDPE, underlain by a 
flownet drainage layer and secondary 1.5 mm HDPE liner.  The secondary HDPE liner is 
then underlain by a 300 mm compacted clay liner consisting of conditioned in-situ material 
or imported clay from other development areas. 

Raw Water Pond 

Raw water for the project will be supplied via the Cobar water service pipeline.  However, 
at certain times this water source may be unavailable for several days at a time.  
Therefore, a small raw water pond will be maintained on site at full capacity in case of 
pipeline outages.  The design storage capacity is 15 ML with an additional 0.5 m 
freeboard.  There is no requirement to line this facility as the water contained will be of a

Event Pond 

The event pond is a below ground facility designed to contain all plant site runoff 
associated with a 1 in 100 year ARI 72 hour event, equivalent to a volume of 22 ML.  
However, sediment will need to be removed from the facility following rainfall events to 
maintain capacity.  Base preparation will consist of scarifying, moisture conditioning and 
compacting the base and sides of the facility and overlaying with a 1.5 mm HDPE liner.  

Sediment Ponds 

Excess water from the pit dewatering will be temporarily stored in Sediment Pond 1 and 
pumped back to the plant circuit as required.  The rainfall runoff from the RSF 
downstream batters and areas contained within the process area levee bund will drain to 
the process area sediment pond (Sediment Pond 2).  The water stored within the process 
area sediment pond will be pumped to the external decant pond for reuse.  Water 
collected in these sediment ponds should be appropriate for pasture irrigation.  Base 
preparation of the sediment ponds will consist of scarifying, moisture conditioning and 
compacting.  

18.7 Residue Storage Facility 

Knight Piésold has designed the Residue Storage Facility (RSF) for the Project in 
accordance with the ANCOLD Guidelines on Tailings Dams – Planning, Design, 
Construction, Operation and Closure and the New South Wales Dams Safety Committee 
(DSC) Guidance Sheets.  Details of the design are provided in the Residue Storage and 
Water Management Report prepared by Knight Piésold (Knight Piésold, 2016). 

18.7.1 Geotechnical Investigation  

Knight Piésold conducted a geotechnical investigation of the proposed RSF to determine 
the foundation conditions.  Knight Piésold also conducted geotechnical investigations of 
the open pit to determine the material types available for construction of the RSF.  The 
geotechnical investigations found that the RSF is underlain by a clayey topsoil layer 
averaging 300 mm thickness, underlain by indurated alluvial clays of between 2 m and  
6 m thickness.  These clays are moderate to high plasticity and in places are cemented by 
iron oxides.  Underlying the clay is a variable sequence of alluvial sands, gravel, silts and 
clays.  Drilling in the RSF area did not encounter bedrock with the bore holes advanced to 
a maximum depth of 62 m. 

The open pit area exhibited a similar strata profile to the RSF area with the exception that 
the base of the alluvial material was encountered from depths of approximately 17 m.  The 
alluvial deposits were underlain by a laterite / saprolite / saprock sequence prior to 
medium strength pyroxenite bedrock being encountered.  

Groundwater was not monitored during the geotechnical investigation, however, previous 
studies indicate that the standing water level in the vicinity of the pit to be between 22 m 
and 25 m below ground surface.

18.7.2 Residue Physical Characteristics  

Residue will be pumped to the RSF as a slurry at 31% solids and will be deposited sub-
aerially to facilitate drying and consolidation of the residue mass.  A residue sample was 
produced by SGS Minerals Services (Lakefield) from a 20 litre autoclave bench scale test 
and supplied to Knight Piésold for testing.  The sample consists of 12% sand, 86% silt and 
2% clay.  The testing indicates that the material is silt, with sand. 

The residue tests indicated that the residue is expected to settle moderately fast but 
achieve low densities.  The densities achieved in the testing were 0.50 t/m3 and 0.59 t/m3 
in the undrained and drained tests respectively. 

Air drying of the samples indicates that they will reach a maximum air dried density of 
approximately 0.92 t/m3 after approximately 80 mm of evaporation, when the moisture 
content of the sample is reduced to approximately 30%. 

Both high strain and low strain consolidation testing was conducted indicating that 
consolidation due to self-weight loading from additional residue will not lead to significant 
increases in density above that achieved in the air drying test.   

The residue is estimated to release 20 to 25% of the slurry water volume during the 
settling process, with the remainder of the water either lost to evaporation or retained in 
the deposited residue.  

18.7.3 Residue Geochemical Characteristics  

The residue solids were found to be 'Potentially Acid Forming – Low Capacity'.  However, 
this classification was due to the presence of alunite rather than sulphide minerals which 
are typically associated with acid generation.  In theory, where hydrolysis of aluminium 
(released during alunite dissolution) proceeds to completion (with the generation of 
aluminium oxyhydroxides), the pH of the solution is near pH 4. 

The residue solids were found to have a low number of element enrichments.  However, 
the elements which were significantly enriched, namely arsenic, antimony and selenium, 
are metalloids which have a high degree of environmental toxicity and display solubility 
over a range of pH conditions.  That said, these metalloids do exhibit strong adsorption 
onto iron oxides and, therefore, are likely to be tightly bound to the hematite in the residue 
solids.  When the residue multi-element results are compared to guidelines for site 
contamination, they are found to exceed the human health and ecological criteria. 

The residue supernatant was found to be of a poor water quality when compared to 
appropriate reference guidelines, primarily due to chromium (VI) present in solution at 
7.52 mg/L.  Later testing by EMC however has shown that the chromium (VI) 
concentration in solution can be reduced to 0.04 mg/L which will significantly reduce the 
risk profile of the supernatant.

18.7.4 Consequence Category  

A consequence category assessment of the RSF has been conducted by Knight Piésold 
in accordance with the ANCOLD Guidelines on the Consequence Categories for Dams, 
and the New South Wales Dam Safety Committee Guidance Sheet for Consequence 
Categories for Dams.  The RSF has been assigned a dam failure consequence category 
of "HIGH B" and an Environmental Spill consequence category of "SIGNIFICANT".  

18.7.5 RSF Design  

The RSF has been designed as a paddock style facility with a perimeter embankment 
around all sides of the facility constructed in stages over the life of the project.  The facility 
will have a maximum height of 32 m at the end of the life of mine (LOM) and has been 
designed to store all residue produced by the process plant over a 20 year operating life.  
The total crest length at the end of the LOM will be 1,300 m, with a basin area of 12.7 ha 
and a total footprint area (to the downstream embankment toe) of 28 ha.  

The facility has been designed to promote air drying to maximise the density of the 
residue stored within the facility.  This has been achieved by staging the construction of 
the facility so that the drying area expands as the process plant throughput increases over 
the first four years of operation.  In addition, a specialised decant tower system has been 
designed which will allow the pond on the facility to be reduced in size below that which 
would normally be achievable with conventional decant systems.  Supernatant water and 
rainfall runoff will be pumped from the facility and stored in an external decant pond from 
where it will be recycled to the plant to meet process demands.  

The RSF is equipped with an underdrainage system on top of the liner, comprising basin 
underdrainage drains and embankment toe drains to reduce the phreatic surface within 
the facility and to allow dewatering of the residue during operations and post closure.  
These drains report to the underdrainage sump from where the water will be recovered 
and pumped to the supernatant pond.  

The RSF design includes a robust liner system on the basin and upstream embankment 
batters of the facility to reduce the potential for seepage from the facility.  The basin liner 
system comprises a 1.5 mm HDPE liner overlying a 300 mm clay liner, which will be 
compacted to achieve a maximum permeability of 1.0 x 10-9 m/sec.  Below the upper clay 
liner, a flownet (synthetic drainage layer) will be installed to capture and recover seepage 
(if any) which passes through the upper liner system.  This sub-liner drainage will report to 
a drainage sump from where the water will be recovered and pumped to the supernatant 
pond.  A secondary liner of compacted clay with a maximum permeability of 1.0 x  
10-9 m/sec will be constructed below the flownet drainage layer.  

The embankment will be constructed with an upstream 6 m wide compacted clay zone 
(with a maximum permeability of 1.0 x 10-9 m/sec) overlain by a 1.5 mm HDPE liner.  The 
structural embankment zone will be constructed of overburden from the pit which will 
comprise moisture conditioned and compacted alluvial soil (clayey sands and gravels).  
The upstream batter of the facility will have an effective slope of 18.4° (1V:3H) to allow 
deployment of the HDPE liner and the downstream life of mine batter slope will also be

18.4° (1V:3H) to provide a stable facility that can be easily rehabilitated with minimal 
reshaping.  

Seepage analysis of the facility design indicates that the phreatic surface within the 
residue mass close to the embankment drops considerably, indicating the effectiveness of 
the proposed toe drain system.  The results further indicate very little infiltration through 
the liner system, with the embankment body remaining unsaturated.  Additional seepage 
modelling indicates that the liner system proposed for the Nyngan RSF exceeds the liner 
criteria recommended by the NSW EPA for solid waste landfills.  

The embankments have been designed to be geotechnically stable under design loading 
conditions, with stability analysis conducted in accordance with ANCOLD guidelines, 
taking into consideration drained, undrained and seismic design loads. 

Simplified deformation analysis was undertaken for the LOM embankment to determine 
the post-earthquake induced vertical settlements which may lead to a potential loss of 
freeboard.  The predicted maximum embankment crest settlements under the MDE are 
less than the design freeboard of 0.5 m.  Therefore, the MDE event is considered unlikely 
to cause severe damage or instantaneous failure of the RSF embankments. 

The liquefaction potential of the residue was evaluated using the PSD method based on 
gradation curves obtained from residue testing.  Results indicate that the residue is likely 
to be liquefiable, as the grading curve for the residue falls within the boundaries of 
materials which are susceptible to liquefaction.  The liquefaction potential of the 
foundation material which will also be utilised for embankment construction (Zone A) was 
evaluated based on the plasticity characteristics.  The results indicate that the foundation / 
embankment construction material is unlikely to be liquefiable as the Atterberg limits fall 
outside the liquefiable zones.  

The facility has been designed in accordance with the freeboard requirements of the NSW 
dams safety committee, with the facility provided with an operational freeboard of 500 mm 
and an environmental containment freeboard sufficient to contain the runoff generated by 
a 1 in 1,000 year ARI 72 hour rainfall event.  A spillway has been designed and will be 
constructed at each stage of construction, with sufficient capacity to pass the peak flow 
generated by the probable maximum precipitation event (PMP).  

18.7.6 Construction of the RSF  

The facility will be constructed in stages over the life of the project.  To reduce capital 
expenditure and to provide an appropriately sized facility for the initial residue throughput 
rates, the Stage 1 facility will be constructed as a single cell.  The first cell will be located 
in the western half of the RSF footprint area and will be constructed during the pre-
commissioning phase.  This cell will be raised once after the first year of production.  After 
the second year of production, the second cell will be constructed to the east of the first 
cell.  The two cells will be combined into a single cell during the third year of production, 
after which the facility will continue to be constructed and operated as a single cell.  

The facility will be constructed by downstream construction methods utilising material 
excavated from the open pit.  The material will be hauled to the RSF from the open pit

using mining trucks and will be placed in the embankment and liner zones.  The material 
will then be moisture conditioned by water trucks prior to compaction of the fill using a 
combination of traffic compaction of vibratory rollers.  Compaction, moisture content, 
particle size, plasticity and in-situ permeability of the fill will be measured during 
construction to ensure the material meets the geotechnical technical specification.  

The geomembrane liners and flownet drains will be installed by a specialist geomembrane 
installation company.  Quality control and quality assurance testing of the geomembranes 
and the installation welds will be conducted during the production of the liner material and 
during the installation process.  

The construction of the initial and all subsequent stages of the construction will be 
overseen and signed off by a qualified engineer in accordance with the NSW Dams Safety 
Committee requirements.  A construction report will be prepared which will contain a 
record of the all the quality control and quality assurance testing conducted during the 
construction with the report submitted to the NSW Dam Safety Committee. 

18.7.7 Operation of the RSF 

The residue will be transported from the processing plant to the RSF via a HDPE pipeline.  
When outside of the RSF footprint, the pipeline will be contained within a bunded corridor 
which will prevent release of residue in the event of pipeline failure. 

The facility will be operated as a subaerial facility, with the residue deposited from the 
external embankments.  During the deposition process, the solids will settle out to form 
sloping beaches and the liquid fraction (supernatant) will drain to the supernatant pond.  

The deposition location will be moved on a regular basis using a system of spigots which 
will be opened or closed to move the deposition around the facility and maintain the 
supernatant pond at the decant tower location.  

Supernatant liquor and minor rainfall runoff will be removed from the RSF by pumping 
from the decant tower to the external decant pond via a HDPE pipeline.  A submersible 
decant return pump will be used for this application.  After a large rainfall event a 
supplementary (stormwater) pump will be used to remove excess water from the facility.  
This water will also be pumped to the external decant pond via a HDPE pipeline.  The 
stormwater pump has been sized to allow the runoff generated by a 1 in 1000 year ARI 72 
hour rainfall event to be removed from the facility within seven days.  The pond on the 
RSF will be kept as small as practical at all times to maximise the beach area and drying 
potential. 

Submersible pumps will be installed in the two underdrainage sumps and two sub-liner 
drainage sumps to recover water.  These pumps will have float switches so that when 
water is present within the sumps the pumps will operate automatically and pump the 
water to the supernatant pond.

18.7.8 Residue Storage Facility Closure Design 

The geochemistry of the residues which will be deposited in the facility require a robust 
closure cover to minimise rainfall infiltration into the facility and reduce the potential for 
seepage from the facility post closure.  To achieve this objective, the closure strategy for 
the facility will be to isolate and cover the contained residues by the construction of domed 
fill platforms, over which a HDPE liner will be installed.  A sub-soil layer will be placed over 
the liner and the entire surface topsoiled and revegetated with shallow rooted pasture 
species.  This will reduce the potential for rainfall infiltration into the facility and, therefore, 
reduce the potential for seepage.  

18.7.9 Monitoring and Instrumentation  

A comprehensive monitoring program has been proposed for the RSF to detect a number 
of potential problems which may arise during operation.  The monitoring will include eight 
survey pins to check embankment movements in each stage and six deep and shallow 
monitoring bores to monitor groundwater levels and water quality downstream of the RSF.  

The RSF is considered to have a "HIGH B" hazard rating.  Thus, in accordance with the 
requirements of ANCOLD and DSC guidelines, annual audits will be required by a suitably 
qualified engineer to ensure that the facility is operating in a safe and efficient manner.   

18.8 Surface Water Management 

A detailed hydrological and flood modelling study was undertaken to estimate the peak 
runoff flow rates which occur in Whitbarrow Creek directly to the south of the Nyngan 
project site.  

18.8.1 Flood Protection Bund 

Assuming a freeboard of 1,000 mm above the 0.1% AEP flood extent, the flood protection 
bund around the pit will require a crest elevation of 185.6 m RL.  Assuming a freeboard of 
1,000 mm above the 0.1% AEP flood extent, the flood protection bund around the process 
area will require a crest elevation of 186.6 m RL. 

18.8.2 Floodway 

A floodway will be required between the Nyngan pit levee area and the process plant 
levee area to allow flows from the catchment to the north to be passed between these 
areas.  The peak flow has been calculated at 2.6 m3/s and the design of the road between 
these two areas shall include sufficient culvert opening and erosion protected overflow 
floodway width to convey this flow.  

18.8.3 Bogan Creek Flooding  

In additional to modelling of the peak storm runoff from Whitbarrow Creek, the potential 
impact (if any) to the Nyngan project from flooding of the Bogan River was assessed.  The 
PMF has previously been estimated for Bogan River at the town of Nyngan as 
15,162 m3/s.  Estimations of normal depth at a cross section adjacent the Nyngan project

showed that the floodwaters would not impact on the project and, therefore, no detailed 
modelling of the Bogan River was conducted. 

18.9 Mine Support Infrastructure 

Mining will be undertaken by a small fleet of contract mining trucks and support equipment 
that will require periodic upkeep and maintenance.  All pricing for the earthwork service 
was inclusive of contract facilities and therefore the only infrastructure required to be 
provided from EMC is a power supply for the mining contractor's offices and facilities. 

As part of the earthworks contract, the contractor will provide the following facilities: 

 A hardstand or compacted earth area for equipment park up. 

 Upkeep and maintenance of temporary safety bunds and drains to enable mining 
to occur. 

 Installation of a hardstand or compacted earth area for undertaking minor 
equipment repairs.  All major repairs will be done offsite. 

 Portable buildings as required to provide the excavation service. 

 Standpipes for transferring water into site water carts. 

 Mobile refuel and lube facilities that meet relevant Australian standards 

The contractor will maintain all haulage routes and in pit roads as part of the haulage 
overhead.  All contract personnel will reside locally and therefore no onsite camp facility 
will be required. 

18.10 Process Plant Infrastructure 

A security fence will be built around the process plant.  The process plant utilises a 
number of high pressure vessels and corrosive liquids and access to site will need to be 
strictly monitored and stringent induction of site visitors will need to be conducted.  The 
security fence will also need to be high enough to keep out grazing stock and kangaroos 
from entering the plant site. 

The scandium oxide product is a high unit value product valued at around US$2,000 /kg.  
A one tonne shipment of product is therefore worth US$2M.  However, no special security 
requirements are planned for shipping as the product would be very difficult to sell on the 
black market and the material from Nyngan is likely to have a chemical signature that will 
be specific to the Nyngan operation and would be easy to trace.  Road transport of 
product in sealed steel drums to shipping facilities in a coastal location like Newcastle or 
Brisbane is envisaged.  Air freight of the product from Dubbo is also a possibility.

Other process plant infrastructure will include: 

 An administration building.  This will be a prefabricated building approximately  
30 m x 12 m comprising reception, offices, open plan office area, meeting room, 
crib room and ablutions. 

 A laboratory.  This will be a prefabricated building approximately 20 m x 12 m 
comprising an office, sample storage area, wet lab area, an XRF room, an ICP 
and AAS room, a LECO room and a clean room.  A separate 20 m x 6 m 
undercover concrete slab area adjacent to the laboratory will be used for sample 
delivery and preparation. 

The laboratory will be equipped with some reasonably complex and expensive 
analytical instruments including: 

- an XRF (X-ray fluorescence) spectrometer 

- an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) 

- an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ISP-
OES) 

- two fume cabinets 

- small jaw crusher 

- ring mill

- drying oven 

- analytical balance. 

 A combined workshop / warehouse building.  Overall building size will be 
approximately 30 m x 30 m, and this will be a prefabricated shed without an 
overhead crane and will include a couple of offices. 

 A combined MCC / central control room building complete with single office and 
ablution facility. 

 A reagent storage building.  This will be a prefabricated shed approximately  
24 m x 12 m. 

Roads within the process plant will be formed and sheeted with imported fill material, but 
will not be sealed. 

An unsealed carpark for ten vehicles will be provided adjacent to the administration 
building.

The warehouse and reagent storage and delivery areas are kept separate from the main 
process plant to minimise heavy traffic interactions.  As sulphuric acid may be delivered in 
B-double tankers, main delivery roads will be designed to accommodate these vehicles. 

Any runoff from the unbunded areas of the process plant will drain via unsealed ground to 
the event pond.  Subject to analysis of stormwater captured in the event pond, this will 
either be directed to the decant pond, evaporation pond or elsewhere via mobile diesel 
powered pump. 

18.11 Accommodation 

No dedicated construction camp will be provided for the project.  Construction workers will 
be accommodated in Nyngan or use will be made of a currently unused construction camp 
(built for the recently constructed AGL Nyngan Solar Plant).   

No dedicated operations camp will be provided for the project.  Operating personnel will 
be accommodated in the Nyngan township.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Introduction – What is Scandium? 

Scandium is an element, categorised as a light transition metal, atomic number 21.  It is 
not technically a rare earth element (REE), although marketing convention has at times 
lumped scandium in with REE's.  Nor is scandium geologically rare: with a crustal (Clarke) 
value of 22ppm, it is about as common as cobalt or yttrium, and is more common than 
lithium or lead.  What is rare about scandium is for it to occur naturally in any significant 
concentration, which can be defined as over 100ppm.  The fact that scandium widely 
distributes itself in low concentrations has made the element commonly geologically 
observed but consistently expensive to gather, concentrate and purify, and explains its 
scarcity as a commercially available commodity.  

Scandium's uniqueness is such that minute additions of the element to aluminium alloys 
results in a step improvement in overall performance properties, including strength.  No 
other alloying element gives the same level of multiple property improvements in such a 
diverse range of aluminium alloy systems as scandium. 

19.2 Current Global Market Size 

There is no transparent marketplace clearinghouse for scandium today.  Buyers and 
sellers of any size advertise their respective interests and negotiate private commercial 
transactions.  To the extent these scandium transactions trigger import/export reporting, or 
duty, they will be captured in governmental statistics, but the data is very incomplete, and 
can also be influenced by material upgrading into semi-finished parts.  The most-quoted 
source of global scandium trade comes from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral 
Commodity Summaries, published annually for approximately 90 minerals and specialty 
metals.  The 2016 USGS summary for scandium (page 146) estimates the annual sales 
figure at "10 to 15 tonnes" for the twelve months ended December 2015, and has 
previously pegged the volume at "less than 10 tonnes" for many years.  SCY believes the 
current scandium market in all forms to be between 15 and 20 tpy, based on apparent 
consumption of oxide in both alloys and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.  Product 
sources in Russia and China are difficult to track into global use statistics, and can take 
the form of aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) 2% master alloy, in addition to scandium oxide.  
SCY believes the largest single user of scandium oxide today is Bloom Energy 
(Sunnyvale, California), which makes SOFC's.  While their consumption is not publically 
disclosed, their supply sources (China / Russia) and imports of scandium-content semi-
finished parts would likely fall outside the USGS data capture systems.  

Aside from Bloom Energy, which has been able to meet its critical scandium need from 
current supply sources, the rest of the potential global market for scandium is constrained 
by limited product supply.  The market is unable to answer greater demand, even at 
higher prices, and the product that is offered for sale is invariably absorbed by buyers 
willing to pay high prices for small amounts, in order to make small product runs or 
explore scandium's impacts in various applications.

19.3 Scandium Products Defined 

Scandium is almost always found in nature in the form of a complex oxide, expressed by 
the chemical formula Sc2O3, also commonly referred to as scandia.  Scandia is the form of 
the element that is most typically demanded by initial-use consumers, either for use 
directly or as an ingredient in downstream products. 

Scandium can be purified into pure elemental form as a metal, although it is technically 
difficult and expensive to do so.  In this elemental form, scandium metal is principally 
purchased and used for scientific and laboratory work.  The element is not found in nature 
in this form, and will return to oxide unless carefully isolated from the atmosphere. 

Scandia is most typically modified into a master alloy (or hardener) for use in alloying 
aluminium.  An Al-Sc 2% master alloy typically has a 98% aluminium content and a 2% 
scandium content, and is designed to facilitate dosing precise quantities of scandium into 
larger volumes of molten aluminium, and can be done with or without other master alloys 
containing other metals to achieve desired multi-metal alloy recipes. 

The purity standards for scandia in these different applications vary with the end-use 
application.  Electrical applications and lighting usually require and specify 99.9% purity, 
while alloying and heat stabilising applications can generally be satisfied by 95 to 98% 
grades.  Scandium metal and oxide grades above 99.9% purity are reserved for science 
and technical exploration of new applications. 

19.4 Market Supply – Scandium Sources 

There are no known primary scandium mining producers today.  Most scandium 
production comes from by-product recovery from current refining activities for other 
metals, minerals, or rare earths.  Scandium can also be found and separated from tailings, 
where it has been enriched by historic mineral processing, or from waste streams of 
operating chemical processing facilities, most notably titanium dioxide facilities (sulfate 
TiO2 pigment plants) and uranium leach solutions.   

Current significant scandium producers are located in China and Russia.  Those and other 
potential sources can be summarised as follows: 

 Chinese sources are spread over numerous producing assets.  The Bayan Obo 
REE (Nb-Fe deposit) mine, host to the world's largest known rare earth element 
resource and located in inner Mongolia, produces some scandium.  Other 
scandium sources are located in southern and central China, typically based off 
leach solution waste streams.  China has additional potential scandium by-
product sources from iron, tin, aluminium, and tungsten mining assets, located in 
a number of provinces. 

 Russian production has traditionally come from scandium content in tailings from 
the Zheltye Zvoti mine in the Ukraine, formerly an iron and uranium underground 
mine, closed in the 1980s.  Stockpiles of scandium oxide and Al-Sc 2% master 
alloy, from Russian strategic stockpiles built in the 1970s, continue to find their

way onto commercial markets.  UC RUSAL has recently announced their intent to 
construct a processing circuit at their Ural aluminium smelter facility to produce 
up to 2.5 tpy of scandium oxide from 'Red Mud' waste material, for use in alloys 
at that and other RUSAL aluminium facilities. 

 Historic US and Canadian sources are very limited, and relate to historic fluorite 
and tantalum mining and processing facilities.  Some (but not all) former tungsten 
mine tailings are known to contain potentially commercial amounts of scandium.  
Canadian REE projects are generally good candidates for scandium by-product 
recovery at the refining stage, and an early stage titanium / niobium project in 
Nebraska has additional scandium potential if developed. 

 Australia has significant, large scale scandium resource potential in lateritic nickel 
and cobalt resources in the States of New South Wales and Queensland.  
Several potential scandium mining projects have been proposed, however there 
are currently no producing mines and no mines under construction.  Certain other 
Asian lateritic nickel projects, specifically in Indonesia, the Philippines and New 
Caledonia, share this scandium by-product potential, but at lower scandium 
grades than the Australian targets. 

 Madagascar and Norway have potential scandium resources, uniquely occurring 
in pegmatite formations containing the mineral thortveitite.  There are currently no 
operating or proposed scandium mines in Madagascar or Norway. 

The challenges of multi-metal sources with respect to scandium bears some further 
discussion. 

The Russian UC RUSAL Red Mud project (if built) will be the first to attempt to 
commercially extract scandium from Bayer Process waste streams formed in the bauxite 
refining process into alumina.  This process is the most common one for refining bauxite 
globally, and it generates large volumes of waste material with low levels of numerous 
residual metals.  Red mud tailings typically contain 50 to 110ppm scandium, but certain 
tailings locations show concentrations of 150ppm, depending on the mineralisation type 
and precise process route.  The processes that essentially double the original 
concentration of scandium (typically 30 to 50ppm) also concentrate numerous other 
metals, specifically iron, aluminium and titanium, which are energy and process intensive 
to separate from scandium.  Red muds also typically contain between 50 and 100ppm of 
uranium and thorium.  Consequently, scandium recovery from these environmental legacy 
residues can be problematic, both as to technical and environmental challenges, as well 
as cost. 

The multi-metal complexity issue tends to follow nickel / cobalt and niobium / titanium 
mineral deposits as well, where scandium is similarly in the 50 to 75ppm grade range.  
The process steps and refining parameters required to optimise recovery for the primary 
metals are not often the same as for scandium, forcing compromises on recoveries.  
Additionally, the size and scale of nickel / niobium / titanium projects is almost always 
large, and that can often create a mismatch for a scandium by-product circuit, either too 
small or too large to manage easily in the context of the principal target metal(s).

19.5 Scandium Market Pricing 

There is no central quoted market price or clearing house for scandium today.  Scandium 
oxide (and metal) sales take place between private parties at undisclosed prices.  Quotes 
for oxide product are influenced by quality specification (grade), volumes required, 
availability through thin supply channels, and of course demand at any point in time.   

Grade parameters are the single most important variant in oxide prices, for two reasons: 

1. Quality upgrades are expensive and can negatively impact overall recoveries. 

2. It is technically challenging to make higher purity product, and the capability to 
upgrade to very pure grades is not widely possessed. 

High quality oxide is considered to be 99.9% grade or higher, as required for electrical 
applications.  Aluminium alloy applications do not require this grade of oxide, and can be 
successfully manufactured from master alloy formed with scandia product grading 95 to 
98%. 

The nature of the trace contaminants also matters, with some being more problematic 
than others in specific applications.  Radioactive elements, or metals that interfere with 
electrical applications in the case of SOFC's, are particular problems.  Certain elements in 
very minute quantities can disrupt the surface quality of very thin rolled aluminium alloys.

These scandium oxide quality issues aside, discounts for lower grade product have 
greatly diminished in recent years, due to the tight supply for any grade of oxide product. 

The published USGS Mineral Commodities data sheet has provided an influential 
reference in defining the apparent price for scandium oxide and scandium metal.  The 
USGS posted prices were notoriously low in the 2008 to 2011 timeframe, as real market 
pricing during this period was demonstrated to be considerably higher.  More recent 
USGS price estimates are consistent with current market experience.  These estimates, 
as referenced below, are understood to be established by canvassing traders and 
specialty metals sellers annually for offered prices, and they represent small quantity 
sales only.  They also tend to focus on highest quality product, rather than on 
commercially viable grades and forms. 

Certainly, the Al-Sc 2% master alloy pricing is very relevant, as that is a 'manufacturing-
ready', end-user form of scandium.  In general terms, 1 kg of scandia can be converted 
into approximately 30 kg of 2% master alloy, so ignoring manufacturing costs, margins, 
material losses and technical capability, the 2% master alloy and scandia prices (99.99%) 
shown below are in rough balance for most years. 

Table 19.1 USGS Historic Published Pricing for Various Scandium Products 

Source:  USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries, 2016, revised annually for scandium. 

 

A call to Stanford Materials Corp., the US supplier referenced in the footnotes of the 
USGS Commodity Summary data sheet as a source of scandium quotations, confirmed 
(31 March 2016) the current oxide price for 1 kg of 99.5% grade product to be  
US$5,290 /kg, reasonably consistent with the price in the table above.  A 10 kg order 
would reduce that price to US$4,920 /kg. 

Current prices quoted on the Alibaba Group Holding Limited (HK) website  
(28 March 2016) for 99.9% to 99.99% grade oxide range from US$1,600 to US$3,500 (no 
duty paid), ex China chemical manufacturers, typically for 1 kg minimums.  SCY initiated a 
purchase of a small quantity of <US$2,000 /kg oxide from a Chinese supplier working off 
this website in January, which has not been delivered as of the writing of this Report (four 
months). 

This data supports a true oxide spot price, grading 99% to 99.9% ('two nines to three 
nines'), of around US$2,500 /kg today, recognising supplies are only available in limited 
quantities.  Large quantity (tonnes) oxide pricing is not available, and only one long term

three-year term, 98.5% minimum grade scandium oxide, annual quantity of 7.5 t 
(7,500 kg), at an undisclosed price. 

19.6 Scandium Applications 

Two principal and potential high volume markets await a reliable and expanded supply of 
scandium.  These two markets are: 

1. SOFCs, which are very efficient electrical generation devices powered by a pure 
hydrogen source, or by re-formed natural gas / methane or more complex 
hydrogen sources. 

2. Aluminium-Scandium alloys (Al-Sc alloys), superior performing variants of 
existing aluminium alloy types. 

The principle advantages scandium delivers in these two market applications are: 

 SOFCs – Scandium promotes critical and desired electro-chemical reactions at 
lower temperatures, which substantially extends the commercial life of the unit, 
avoids higher cost materials for containment, and increases electrical power 
output over competing materials. 

 Aluminium Alloys – Scandium adds strength while preserving desirable 
properties in aluminium alloys.  Scandium additions promote grain refinement, 
while retaining desirable superplasticity (ductility), and make alloys more 
responsive to precipitation hardening techniques.  These effects increase the 
strength of almost all aluminium alloys, and substantially increase the strength of 
certain alloys.  Scandium delivers this strength improvement while 
preserving/improving both corrosion resistance and weldability in specific 
aluminium alloys where it already exists. 

Other commercial applications for scandium include doping of ceramics for increased 
hardness, applications in electrical devices that include laser parts and computer 
switches, mercury vapour high intensity lighting, and TV / digital displays. 

19.7 Scandium Markets 

The SOFC market is an emerging market with a revolutionary technology for efficient, 
clean, distributed electrical power.  While the global power market is enormous, the 
application for this form of generation is particularly suited to certain power needs, such as 
ultra-high reliability requirement users, Direct Current (DC) demand, and off-grid users.  
Stationary power applications are commercial now, and the industry leader (Bloom 
Energy) is poised to meet rapid adoption.  This market represents an immediate customer 
for reliable scandium supply in the short term, with very good growth potential over time, 
across global markets.

The global aluminium industry produced 58 Mt of primary metal in 2015, making it a 
US$100bn a year marketplace, not counting remelt and recycle sources -which are 
significant.  Most aluminium sold today is alloyed with other metals in some form or 
another to promote improved material characteristics, particularly strength, and those 
alloys sell for two to four times the price of primary metal, making the market even larger.  
Aluminium alloys rival iron ore as the largest globally traded metal-containing commodity, 
and is ubiquitous in the manufacturing marketplace.  Scandium represents a well-known 
additive in this alloy mix, and has application in all manner of construction, transport, 
aerospace, marine, and tubing markets.  Scandium additions also show promise across 
all forms of aluminium products: wrought (sheet / plate), extruded forms, and cast 
systems.  These alloy markets are already highly developed, as aluminium is widely 
accepted and integrated into products used today.  Scandium's benefits will enable 
engineers to employ better alloy properties to existing applications and build higher 
performance products, within existing design and tooling parameters. 

19.8 Scandium Market Forecast – Demand and Price 

The demand for scandium will not be empirically evidenced until there is an adequate 
supply of scandium available for trade on world markets.  Pricing will matter as well.  
Products will absorb the cost of scandium in aluminium alloys in different ways and to a 
different cost tolerance.  The aircraft industry will likely be the most price insensitive 
application, even at low oil prices, but more so at high fuel cost levels.  Other aluminium 
alloy applications will not see enough benefits from improved properties to justify added 
cost, and will see little scandium alloy take-up. 

SCY commissioned an independent metals marketing group, CM Group of Adelaide, 
Australia, to provide a ten year scandia demand estimate and associated price forecast.  
The study, entitled "The 10 Year Outlook for the Global Scandium Market to 2026", was 
received by SCY in March 2016.  The CM Group has experience in commodities research 
and market development studies, having previously done independent long-term market 
studies for magnesium, aluminium and tungsten, among other market analyses.  The CM 
Group has historical ties to the aluminium industry worldwide.  The detailed CM Group 
document is considered confidential, as it contains specific market strategy information, 
and will not be made publicly available.  That noted, the outlook was commissioned in part 
to independently inform this feasibility study on future scandium price assumptions.  Key 
findings in the CM Group research as they relate to scandium demand estimates and 
price forecasts, are as follows: 

 The aluminium industry is generally aware of scandium and its significant positive 
influence on the properties of most aluminium alloys. 

 The transportation sector, specifically aerospace, is likely to be a key demand 
source for scandium, although the SOFC market will also be important, as will 
other alloy applications.

 The global scandium market is expected to exceed 100 tpy by 2021 and to 
approach 180 tpy in the 10 year timeframe from 2016 to 2026.  This growth 
forecast represents a 27% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the 
scandium market over the next ten years. 

 Scandium pricing will depend somewhat on the realisation of supply growth, the 
timing of that growth, and the adoption rate of customers and industry segments 
to scandium alloys. 

 The most likely case pricing scenario supports a current US$2,500 /kg scandia 
price today, with a downwards drift to US$2,000 /kg by 2020, followed by a drift 
back up to US$2,500 /kg by 2026. 

 High and low pricing scenarios were also outlined.  Their pricing estimates 
average approximately US$3,000 /kg and US$1,500 /kg over the ten year time 
frame. 

 Both alternate scenarios assume a number of potential primary and secondary  
co-product supply sources come on line in the next three to four years, but the 
demand trends either ramp up faster than forecast or are delayed and develop 
more slowly.  The low price / low demand scenario settles above US$1,500 /kg 
by 2022, based on product prices set by the highest cost, co-product supply 
sources. 

19.9 Scandium Price Assumptions 

This economic analysis for the Nyngan Project development contains an average 
US$2,000 /kg scandia price assumption, over all 20 years, covering various grades of 
product offered from 97% to 99.9%.  This price assumption is supported by the pricing 
outlook supplied by CM Group, by a wide ranging set of discussions that SCY has had 
with interested customers over several years, and by evidence of a three year sales 
contract with an independent third party for 7.5 tpy of scandia, starting with project start-up 
in 2018.  The existing off-take is with Alcereco (Kingston, Ontario), who is a 
knowledgeable alloy and master alloy manufacturer.  SCY also has a formal strategic 
alliance with Alcereco, supported by a Memo of Understanding (MOU) and an addendum 
to that initial agreement specifically indicating the parties are actively building scandium 
markets for future sales agreements.  The price on the off-take agreement has not been 
disclosed and is considered confidential by the parties. 

The assumed scandia pricing level of US$2,000 /kg, applied to the economics of this 
feasibility study, is understood to enable scandium to bring value to both the SOFC and 
Al-Sc markets for customers. 

The QP for Lycopodium has read both the CM Group 10 Year Scandium Global Outlook 
document and the SCY / Alcereco 2015 off-take agreement, and notes that the 
statements made in this marketing summary are fully consistent with those documents, 
and is supportive of the scandium oxide price assumption in this feasibility study.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Summary of Result of Environmental Studies 

20.1.1 Introduction 

R.W. Corkery & Co Pty Limited (RWC) completed an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) in April 2016, on behalf of EMC-A (the Applicant).  This EIS supports an application 
for Development Consent for the Nyngan Scandium Project, and was submitted to the 
Department of Planning and Environment on 29 April 2016.  The EIS, accompanied by a 
Specialist Consultants Study Compendium, will receive a compulsory adequacy review by 
Department staff and other relevant government agencies, as a condition to formal 
acceptance and public availability.  

The EIS, and ultimately the granting of a Development Consent, forms a key part of a 
successful mining license application (MLA) to the NSW Division of Resources and 
Energy (Department of Industry), requesting permission to develop the Nyngan Scandium 
Project (the Proposal). 

The EIS document was prepared with the assistance of the following specialist 
environmental and engineering consultants: 

 Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas – Ramboll Environ Australia. 

 Biodiversity – EnviroKey. 

 Water, Rock and Surface Water – Knight Piésold. 

 Groundwater – Ground Doctor. 

 Noise – Spectrum Acoustics. 

 Traffic – Constructive Solutions. 

 Heritage – Artefact Heritage Services. 

 Soils – Strategic Environmental and Engineering Consultants. 

The following presents a brief overview of the results of those studies. 

20.1.2 Air Quality 

Ramboll Environ (2016) determined that no predicted particulate matter concentration or 
deposition result would exceed criteria at any residences as a result of the Proposal, and 
that that the Proposal would not result in significant greenhouse gas impacts.  
Furthermore, taking into consideration the Applicant's commitment to install a range of

emission control devices to ensure compliance with the NSW Clean Air Regulations, 
Ramboll Environ (2016) determined that the Proposal would not result in adverse air 
quality impacts associated with the proposed processing operations.  

20.1.3 Biodiversity 

The Proposal would result in the disturbance of approximately: 

 9.3 ha of Poplar Box – Gum-barked Coolibah – White Cypress Pine shrubby 
woodland mainly in the Cobar Peneplain Bioregion vegetation community. 

 135.7 ha of disturbed land used for cropping activities. 

EnviroKey (2016) undertook an assessment of the impacts associated with the 
disturbance of this vegetation, and determined that the Proposal would not have a 
significant impact upon this community, as it is well represented in the immediate area. 

EnviroKey (2016) further identified that: 

 Five species listed under the TSC Act have the potential to occur within the 
Project Site. 

 One protected species listed under the EPBC Act has the potential to occur 
within the Project Site. 

EnviroKey (2016) undertook significance assessments for each of these species and 
determined that, with the implementation of management and mitigation measures, the 
Proposal would be unlikely to have a significant impact on any identified species. 

The Applicant would implement a Biodiversity Offset Strategy to offset vegetation clearing 
impacts, including a proposed 64 ha Biodiversity Offset Area.  EnviroKey (2016) 
concluded that the proposed Biodiversity Offset Strategy would be consistent with the 
Office of Environment and Heritage's offsetting principles. 

20.1.4 Surface Water 

Knight Piésold (2016c) undertook an assessment of the hydrology of the Project Site and 
surrounds.  In particular, the assessment focused on the potential for flooding associated 
with Whitbarrow Creek, located to the south of the Project Site.  The assessment 
considered both a 1% (1 in 100 year) and 0.1% (1 in 1000 year) Annual Exceedance 
Probability (AEP) Storm.  

Knight Piésold (2016c) determined that the maximum flood height under a 0.1% AEP 
event in the vicinity of the Processing Plant / Residue Storage Facility Area and the open 
cuts would be approximately 185.2 m AHD and 184.5 m AHD respectively.  As a result; 
the Applicant proposes to construct levee bunds around the Processing Plant / Residue 
Storage Facility Area and open cuts of 186.6 m AHD and 185.6 m AHD respectively, or 
more than 1 m higher than the anticipated 0.1% AEP flood level.

In addition, all water with the potential to contain processing chemicals or salt would be 
retained within the Project Site under all circumstances.  Water with the potential to 
contain suspended sediment only would, if required to be discharged, be tested prior to 
being irrigated to the surrounding land. 

As a result, no adverse surface water impacts are anticipated. 

20.1.5 Groundwater 

Impax (2016) determined that the groundwater within the Project Site would not be 
suitable for any common beneficial use without prior treatment due to high salinity.  Impax 
(2016) also determined that the Proposal is not anticipated to result in groundwater 
drawdown at any surrounding groundwater bores or drainage lines. 

20.1.6 Noise 

Operational and transport noise generated by the Proposal would, assuming the 
implementation of the nominated safeguards and controls, not exceed the relevant criteria 
at any privately-owned residence. 

20.1.7 Traffic and Transportation 

The Site Access Road and the intersection with Gilgai Road would be constructed to a 
standard suitable for all vehicles expected to access the Project Site (indicatively up to  
B-double size).  Constructive Solutions (2016) state that the level crossing over the 
Nyngan to Cobar Railway and the intersection with the Barrier Highway are adequate for 
the proposed traffic movements.  Finally, the proposed additional traffic movements would 
not result in the surrounding roads reaching or approaching their capacity/ 

As a result, the Proposal would not result in additional adverse traffic-related impacts. 

20.1.8 Aboriginal and Historic Heritage 

No sites of Aboriginal or historic heritage significance were identified within the Project 
Site. 

20.1.9 Visual Amenity 

Based on relative isolation of the Project Site and the proposed landscape and visual 
amenity related controls, the Proposal would not impact significantly on local visual 
amenity. 

20.1.10 Soils and Capability 

Given the establishment of soil management procedures and safeguards, the Proposal 
would result in significant soil and land capability impacts.

20.1.11 Other Impacts 

Bushfire and agricultural impacts associated with the Proposal would be negligible. 

20.2 Environmental Management Plans 

The following Environmental Management Plans will be required to be prepared prior to 
the commencement of operations: 

 Mining Operations Plan / Rehabilitation Management Plan. 

 Environmental Management Strategy. 

 Water and Flooding Management Plan. 

 Noise Management Plan. 

 Air Quality and Emissions Management Plan. 

 Biodiversity Offset Strategy.  

 Biodiversity Management Plan. 

 Transport Management Plan. 

 Pollution Incident and Response Management Plan. 

20.3 Project Permitting Requirements 

The Proposal would require Development Consent from the Minister for Planning and 
Environment and under Division 4.1 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 
1979.  In addition, the following licences, leases, permits, agreements and approvals 
would be required to allow commencement of the Proposal: 

 An Environment Protection Licence issued by the Environment Protection 
Authority (EPA) under Section 47 of the Protection of the Environment 
Operations Act 1997. 

 A Mining Lease issued by the Department of Trade and Investment – Division of 
Resources and Energy (DRE) under the Mining Act 1992.  The Applicant 
currently holds EL8316, ELA5232 and EL6096 over the Project Site and will 
submit a Mining Lease Application (MLA). 

 Water Supply Works and Use Approval and Water Access Licence issued by the 
DPI – Water under the Water Management Act 2000 for incidental water 
intersected by the proposed open cuts.  The Water Access Licence must be 
consistent with the Water Sharing Plan for the Macquarie Bogan Unregulated and 
Alluvial Water Sources.

Following receipt of development consent, the Applicant would also seek the necessary 
approvals / construction certificates from Bogan Shire Council for the construction of 
buildings, structures, and appropriate waste water treatment systems for the Proposal. 

20.4 Social and Community Relationships 

20.4.1 Community Consultation 

The following information describes the consultation undertaken by the Applicant with the 
local and surrounding landholders. 

20.4.2 Consultation with Neighbouring Landholders 

The Applicant has undertaken a long-term program of consultation with surrounding 
landholders since the Applicant first became associated with the project in early 2010, 
including one-on-one meetings and informal conversations on site and via telephone.  In 
addition, all neighbouring landholders were provided with a private briefing during the final 
stages of preparation of the EIS, with all comments incorporated into the final version of 
that document 

20.4.3 Consultation with the Wider Community 

The Applicant held a community meeting at the Nyngan RSL on 7 December 2015.  The 
meeting was attended by approximately 15 residents of Nyngan.  Mr George Putnam, 
President, CEO and Director of the Applicant, provided an overview of the Proposal and 
opened the floor for general questions and discussion.  The attendees asked a number of 
questions in relation to the processing methodology and likely employment and business 
opportunities associated with the Proposal.  The general consensus of the attendees was 
that the Proposal would provide much needed employment and economic activity.  One 
attendee made the comment that the residents of Nyngan and surrounding areas are 
familiar with mining operations as many rely on the existing Tritton Copper Mine for part 
time employment and off-farm income.

20.5 Government Agency Consultation 

20.5.1 Introduction 

Both formal and informal consultation was undertaken with a range of government 
agencies at State and local levels throughout the preparation of this document.  The 
following subsections provide an overview of government agency consultation in 
formalised meetings and throughout the ongoing development of the Proposal. 

20.5.2 Conceptual Project Development Plan Meeting 

A Conceptual Project Development Plan Meeting was held with the Department of Trade 
and Investment Division of Resources and Energy (DRE), on 31 January 2012.  At that 
meeting, the viability of a scandium mine, potential markets, the identified resources and 
the Proposal, as it was then understood, were presented.  As a result of that meeting, 
DRE agreed to support the Proposal moving to the development application phase and 
advised the Department of Planning and Environment that formal government agency 
consultation could commence. 

20.5.3 Planning Focus Meeting 

A Planning focus meeting was held for the Proposal on 21 February 2012 with the 
following government agencies in attendance: 

 NSW Trade and Investment (now Division of Resources and Energy). 

 Bogan Shire Council. 

 DPI Crown Lands. 

 NSW Office of Water (now DPI Water). 

 Environment Protection Authority. 

During the meeting, an overview of the Proposal, as it was then understood, was 
presented and attendees inspected the Project Site.  Following the site inspection, the 
attending government agencies present verbally outlined the issues from their 
perspectives that the Environmental Impact Statement should address.  A number of 
these issues and others (including submissions by the government agencies who couldn't 
attend the Planning Focus Meeting) were subsequently provided to the then Department 
of Planning and Infrastructure in writing to assist in the formulation of the Director-
General's Requirements which were provided on 19 March 2012.  

20.5.4 Revised Secretary's Environmental Assessment Requirements 

The 2012 Director-General's Requirements identified that should an application for 
Development Consent not be submitted with two years of the date of the requirements, 
namely by 19 March 2014, that further consultation should be undertaken.  As a result, the

20.6 Mine Closure Requirements 

20.6.1 Introduction 

The Applicant notes that based on the identified resource and the proposed production 
rate, sufficient resources exist for 180 years of mining operations.  Notwithstanding this, 
however, rehabilitation of all areas to be disturbed would be an integral part of the 
Proposal.  Emphasis would be placed upon progressively creating the final landform,  
re-establishing soil profiles and vegetation essential to achieving the preferred land uses. 

Rehabilitation activities would be planned and undertaken in accordance with a Mining 
Operations Plan (MOP) to be submitted to the DRE and approved following the issue of 
development consent and prior to the commencement of on-site activities.  The MOP 
would also address any rehabilitation-related requirements nominated in the Development 
Consent for the Proposal. 

In addition to the rehabilitation commitments in the EIS, rehabilitation would be planned 
and undertaken with reference to the following documentation: 

 Mine Rehabilitation – Leading Practice Sustainable Development Program for the 
Mining Industry (Commonwealth Government, 2006). 

 Mine Closure and Completion – Leading Practice Sustainable Development 
Program for the Mining Industry (Commonwealth Government, 2006).

 Strategic Framework for Mine Closure (ANZMEC, 2000). 

20.6.2 Rehabilitation Objectives 

In the short term, the Applicant's objectives would be to stabilise all earthworks and 
disturbed areas no longer required for Proposal-related activities.  In particular, emphasis 
would be placed on shaping and stabilising the outer face of the levee bund and elevated 
haul road to minimise the potential for erosion of these structures and associated 
sedimentation. 

The Applicant's longer term rehabilitation objectives are to ensure that: 

 The rehabilitated landform is safe, stable, non-polluting and suitable for the 
identified long-term final land uses 

 Suitable vegetation is established on the final landform, taking into account the 
proposed final land use 

 The rehabilitated landform requires levels of maintenance commensurate with 
surrounding land 

 Rehabilitation is undertaken in an efficient and economically sustainable manner 

 The mining lease(s) over the rehabilitated landform can be relinquished and the 
security returned within a reasonable time after the completion of all mining and 
rehabilitation activities. 

Final Landform 

The final landform would comprise the following: 

 Two bunded and fenced open cuts within a larger borrow pit. 

 A free draining, covered Residue Storage Facility. 

 A generally flat Processing Plant Area with all infrastructure not required for the 
final land use, including the levee bunds, removed. 

 Two water storage dams, namely the Event Pond and Sediment Pond 1, with all 
other water storages removed. 

 A site access road. 

20.6.3 Final Land Use 

The Applicant proposes the following final land uses for the Project Site.  These land uses 
are permissible without further consent under the Bogan Local Environment Plan 2011.

 Residue Storage Facility – nature conservation (grassland) 

As the establishment of deep rooted vegetation on the facility could potentially 
adversely impact on the impermeable cap for the facility, the Applicant would 
establish a native grassland community on the final landform. 

• Open cuts – water storage / final void and nature conservation (woodland) 

As backfilling of the final voids would sterilise surrounding resource, the Applicant 
proposes to use the final open cut voids for water storage or simply retain the 
open cuts as bunded voids to facilitate future mining operations. 

 Borrow Pit – nature conservation (woodland) 

The generally flat floor and side slopes of the Borrow Pit would be rehabilitated to 
achieve a native woodland consistent with the existing native vegetation within 
the Project Site, namely Benson ID 103 – Poplar Box – Gum Coolabah and White 
Cypress Pine Shrubby Woodland mainly in the Cobar Peneplain Bioregion.  The 
walls of the Borrow Pit would be shaped to be stable in the long term.  The Final 
Levee Bunds would remain in place. 

 Event Pond and Sediment Pond – Water storage 

The Event and Sediment Ponds would be retained as agricultural dams. 

 Processing Plant Area – Agriculture 

The Processing Plant Area would be returned to the existing land use, namely 
agriculture. 

Finally, a range of alternative post-mining land uses for the Project Site have been 
considered.  Each of these require further development consent or approval under the 
Bogan Local Environment Plan 2011 following the completion of mining and processing 
operations. 

 Solar farm 

The Applicant notes that the Nyngan Solar Plant received development consent 
on 15 July 2013, with construction completed in mid-2015.  As the Project Site 
would include large flat disturbed areas and power transmission infrastructure, 
potential exists for a similar facility to be constructed within the Project Site. 

 Manufacturing facility 

Potential exists for an industrial manufacturing facility that would require 
separation from surrounding residential receivers while having good access to 
power, water and transportation.  Examples may include chemical manufacturing 
plants or explosive manufacturing or storage plants.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Capital and Operating Costs - Overview 

Total initial capital cost for the project is estimated at US$87.1M.  This spend level is 
envisioned to be completed on a 12 month schedule, commencing and completing in 
2017.  Minor amounts of engineering capital included in this estimate will need to be spent 
by the project owner in late 2016, in order to meet this timetable with regard to longer 
lead-time items.  The capital cost estimate is summarised in Table 21.1. 

Table 21.1 Total Project Initial Capital Cost  

 

Project economics were modelled over 21 periods, with construction in period one, and 
operations planned over the next 20 years. 

Mining activity was scheduled quarterly for five years, annually thereafter.  The overall 
project throughput followed the mine plan, which generated yearly individual estimates of 
waste removal tonnes, annual mined tonnes delivered to the plant, and individual 
resource scandium grades based on resource modelling, by year. 

Plant operating costs followed the individual mining tonnage throughput schedule, and 
estimated cost based on fixed and variable components.  The fixed cost component 
represented an annual cost, regardless of plant throughput, while the variable component 
flexed the annual spend to reflect variable plant throughput levels. 

These annual variables generate unique cost figures for each year of the 20 year project 
life, meaning no two years are alike.  As a result, the presentation of annual spend and

21.2 Mining - Capital Cost Detail 

Overburden removal and resource mining for mill feed will be undertaken by a contract 
miner, who will supply all necessary operators and mining equipment to safely excavate 
the two pits.  Pit dewatering will be maintained by pumping from the pit void, requiring a 
pump, a lighting plant, and pipework as capital items.  Table 21.3 provides an overview of 
the mining capital:

21.3 Mining - Operating Cost Detail 

The mining operation is very small, as the plant feed requirement is only 75,000 t of 
resource per year.  Strip ratios are also modest (3.5 average), resulting in relatively low 
overburden removal requirements.  Both overburden and resource mining will be free-dig, 
and will not require blasting.  Annual overall mining costs do vary however, as the 
stripping ratio on a year to year basis fluctuates. 

This mining will be conducted on a campaign basis, expected to be two or three times per 
year, with the mining contractor on site on an as-required basis.  The length of each 
campaign will be dictated by the scheduled material quantities, but will typically be of a 
one month duration. 

A preliminary tender was conducted to establish the cost of a full service bid from a local 
contractor.  This established a rise and run matrix for the operation.  Overall mining costs 
varied with both overburden requirements and also with depth from surface. 

Table 21.4 Mining Unit Cost Detail 

 

In addition to mining resource for mill feed, there is a significant requirement for 
infrastructure construction material.  This need, combined with the initial stripping required 
to access resource mill feed, results in significant stripping during the early years of the 
project, significantly increasing overall mining costs during these years. 

21.4 Process Plant & Infrastructure Capital Cost Detail 

21.4.1 Introduction 

The Nyngan Scandium Project is a relatively small development project by mining 
standards.  Whilst the processing facility will typically process only 75,000 tpa of ore, it is 
relatively technically sophisticated.  The plant contains a large number of process stages 
and reagent inputs, processes hot and acidic liquid / solid solutions, has notable high 
pressure circuits, and consequently will require a number of high grade materials of 
construction.  Accordingly, the capital cost intensity ($/tpa throughput) can be expected to

be significantly higher for this plant than other larger, less complex mineral processing 
operations. 

21.4.2 Initial Plant Capital Cost 

The initial capital cost for the process plant and infrastructure components of the project

21.4.3 Future Plant Costs – Capital and Expense 

Sustaining process plant and infrastructure costs on the project (including owner's costs) 
are primarily related to recurring expenditure on the residue storage facility (tailings pond).  
These costs, over 20 years, total US$22.4M.  This work is predominantly associated with 
the ongoing expansion of the residue storage facility, which requires capacity increases in 
18 future stages (Stages 2 to 19), over planned the 20 year life of the project. 

These ongoing operational costs are treated in the financial model as annual expenses.  
As the residue storage facility never exceeds a three year capacity relative to the project 
plan, the costs can be expensed annually as incurred, and are shown as part of annual 
costs.  The initial cost of building the residue storage facility is capitalised and shown as 
capital in the initial capital estimate. 

Apart from the earthworks cost associated with the periodic expansion of the residue 
storage facility, expenditure is included for decant pumps and associated pipes, power 
etc. for the second cell of the residue storage facility in 2020, also expensed, and a 
deferred purchase of an additional water licence (capital item), also planned for 2020. 

Future capital costs are summarised by stage in Table 21.7. 

Table 21.7 Residual Storage Facility Expansion Expense (by Year / Stage) 

 

21.4.4 Closure Capital Cost 

At the end of the 20 year planned operation of the project, should the project not continue, 
the site and facilities would need to be reclaimed.  With respect to the residue storage 
facility, which has in all likelihood reached its practical terminal size at 20 years, it will be 
necessary to carry out rehabilitation works on that facility.  These works include: 

 Shaping the upper surface of the facility to form a domed, free draining structure, 
once the contents are sufficiently dry. 

 Installation of a HDPE liner over the shaped landform to prevent infiltration of 
water into the residue pile.

 Covering the liner with at least one metre of overburden. 

No allowance has been made for closure costs of the process plant and remaining 
infrastructure components as it is likely that the plant will continue to operate beyond  
20 years.  There will also be some salvage value for components of the process plant that 
will offset significant portions of any process plant closure costs. 

The total closure capital cost estimate for the process plant and infrastructure components 
of the project is US$5.1M, including contingency of US$0.6M. 

21.4.5 Capital Cost Basis of Estimate  

Base Currency and Estimate Base Date 

All capital cost estimates are presented in United States Dollars (US$) with a base date of 
first quarter 2016 (1Q16) unless otherwise noted. 

No allowance has been made for escalation between the estimate base date and the time 
at which commitments will actually be incurred, and payments made. 

Estimate Class and Accuracy 

The estimate has been prepared in accordance with Lycopodium's requirements for a 
Class 2 definitive feasibility study estimate.   

The accuracy range for the estimate is +15% / -5%. 

Qualifications and Assumptions 

The following general qualifications and assumptions have been made in assembling the 
capital cost estimate for the process plant and infrastructure components: 

 The Capital Cost Estimate (CCE) has been based on the implementation of an 
EPCM contracting strategy. 

 Where the mine plan accommodates the use of overburden material for the 
construction of the residue storage facility, levee banks and roads, the cost of 
winning the material from the mine and hauling to the required site is covered in 
the mining costs.  The costs to dump, move, and compact the material is included 
in the process plant and infrastructure costs. 

 No dedicated construction camp will be provided for the project.  Construction 
workers will be accommodated in Nyngan or will make use of the currently 
unused construction camp (built for the recently constructed AGL Nyngan Solar 
Plant).  Rates for site work are inclusive of transport, accommodation and meals 
for the workforce.

 No dedicated operations camp will be provided for the project.  Operating 
personnel will be accommodated in the Nyngan township. 

 There is no allowance for unforeseen blasting and excavation of rock in the bulk 
earthworks.  

Exclusions 

The following items are excluded from the capital cost estimate: 

 Sunk costs, including prior testwork, drilling, land acquisition and studies. 

 Any upgrade to the existing intersection between Gilgai Road and the Barrier 
Highway, or any upgrade works to any other public roads. 

 Escalation. 

 Working capital, (which is included in cash flow estimates). 

 Financing costs or interest costs during construction. 

 Exchange rate variations. 

 Australian Goods and Services Tax (GST). 

Estimating Methodology 

The capital cost estimate has been prepared and based on an EPCM contract execution 
strategy.  An EPCM contractor will be engaged to complete all detailed engineering for the 
process plant and infrastructure, as well as manage the procurement of all equipment and 
off-site fabrication, and all on-site installation works. 

Major site contracts will include: 

 Earthworks (likely to be combined with mining pre-strip works). 

 Concrete (including supply of all formwork, reinforcement, cast-in items and 
concrete batching plant). 

 SMP installation (including installation of fabricated steelwork, fabricated 
platework, proprietary mechanical equipment and valves, and the supply and 
installation of pipework including insulation). 

 E&I installation (including installation of proprietary electrical equipment and 
instruments, and the supply and installation of cables from HV to control). 

 Prefabricated buildings (detailed design, supply and install).

The estimate has been prepared and based on the following key documentation: 

 Process flow diagrams. 

 HPAL area P&IDs. 

 Mechanical equipment list. 

 General process plant layout drawings. 

Engineering Status 

The design status varies across plant areas due to the level of detail available and actual 
design work undertaken.  The design has utilised recently completed facility designs from 
other like projects and studies, and modified construction and as-built drawings of past 
project facilities.  The level of design carried out varies from initial concept drawings 
through to reconfiguration of existing plant layouts and quantity take-offs generated 
specifically for this project. 

Equipment sizes and materials of construction are as documented in the mechanical 
equipment list, and have been designed to suit the mass balance and process design 
criteria, while utilising information from previous similar plants where possible. 

Estimate Methods of Calculation 

Capital costs for the process plant and infrastructure area were compiled using the

 The Tropicana Gold Project in Western Australia designed by Lycopodium and 
constructed in 2013, was used to benchmark site commodity and labour rates.  It 
was determined that the rates used in the Nyngan Scandium project estimate are 
typically lower than Tropicana, that being reflective of a softening in market 
conditions and also a difference in project scale.  The smaller Nyngan project 
enables the use of localised lower tier contractors of suitable capability.

Fabrication Costs 

Budget enquiries were issued to Australian based contractors for the fabrication of 
platework (both carbon steel and various grades of stainless steel) and structural 
steelwork. 

Fabrication rates were requested based on a preliminary bill of quantities for the project. 

Rates provided were all inclusive of workshop detailing, supply of materials, fabrication, 
painting and loading onto transport. 

Of the four responding fabrication bidders for both structural steel and platework 
packages, prices were within ± 4% of the average price. 

Fabrication rates from a vendor on the lower end of the range were selected for the capital 
estimate. 

Given the small quantities of structural steel involved in the project, it was not considered 
worthwhile to source pricing from Asian based fabricators.  There is potential to further 
explore this option during the execution phase of the project. 

Installation Costs 

Budget enquiries were issued to east coast Australian based contractors for the major site 
works packages based on a preliminary estimate of quantities. 

Quoted installation costs included direct labour, equipment, and contractors' indirect 
costs. 

The labour component reflects the cost of the direct workforce required to construct the 
Project, being the product of the estimated working hours spent on site multiplied by the 
cost of labour to the contractor, inclusive of overtime premiums, statutory overheads, 
payroll burden and contractor margin. 

Manhours for all disciplines are based on Australian norms for recent completed 
installations, with a productivity factor of 1.25 having been applied. 

The equipment component reflects the cost of the construction equipment and running 
costs required to construct the Project.  It also includes cranes, vehicles, small tools, 
consumables, PPE, and the applicable contractor margin. 

Contractors' indirect costs encompass the remaining cost of installation and include items 
such as off-site management, on-site staff and supervision above trade level, crane 
drivers, mobilisation and demobilisation, R&R, meals and accommodation, and the 
applicable contractor margin. 

Labour gang rates including equipment and contractor indirect costs for each major trade 
commodity are shown in Table 21.11.

 Communications.  

 Computers, IT services, servers, and telephones. 

 Construction services that include power, water, fuel (facilities provided by the 
individual contractors), consumables, PPE and costs for meals and 
accommodation. 

 Local indirect labour for installation support. 

Contractor indirect costs are typically quoted as a percentage of the direct labour 
component.  Contractor indirect costs by discipline are shown in Table 21.12.

Freight and Import Duty Costs 

Freight for fabricated structural steel and platework has been estimated on a tonnage 
basis using rates provided by fabrication contractors.  By way of example, freight for 
structural steel is estimated at US$134 /t. 

Freight for mechanical, electrical and piping materials has been estimated on a 
percentage of supply cost basis considering the origin of manufacture.  The average 
freight cost for mechanical equipment represents 6.2% of total supply cost. 

Import duty has been assigned at 5% of equipment supply cost for any equipment with a 
supply location other than Australia.  Equipment that may be partially manufactured 
outside of Australia although quoted with an Australian supply location, does not have any 
import duty applied. 

Residue Storage Facility, Roads, and Ponds 

Earthworks quantities for the construction each stage of the Residue Storage Facility and 
the construction of the roads, levees, and ponds have been extracted from 3D CAD 
models for each infrastructure elements.  

The estimated cost for the construction of the first nine stages of the Residue Storage 
Facility and levees where material is sourced from the overburden removal operations 
exclude mining and haulage costs, with the overburden removal costs for the mining 
operation covering supply of the material to the centroid of the Residue Storage Facility 
and levee.  The costs for the construction of the first nine stages for the Residue Storage 
Facility and levees earthworks have been estimated based on recently tendered rates 
from similar earthworks projects in Australia and include only for placement, spreading, 
moisture conditioning and trimming to form the embankment / levee to the design profiles. 

The estimated cost for the construction of Stages 10 to 19 and for closure covers of the 
Residue Storage Facility where material is sourced from borrow pits include for winning, 
loading, haulage, placement, spreading, moisture conditioning and trimming to form the 
embankment / cover system to the design profiles.  The costs for the construction of 
Stages 10 to 19 and for closure covers for the Residue Storage Facility have been 
estimated based on recently tendered rates from similar earthworks projects in Australia 

The estimated costs for the construction of the ponds and roads have been estimated 
based on recently tendered rates from similar earthworks projects in Australia and include 
for excavation, haulage, placement, spreading, moisture conditioning, and trimming to 
form the embankments / roads to the design profiles. 

Quantities for the geomebrane liners and flownet synthetic drainage layers which are 
required for the Residue Storage Facility and contaminated water ponds have been 
extracted from the 3D CAD models.  Budget pricing for supply, installed and QA / QC of 
these liners has been obtained from specialist liner suppliers / installers.

Quantities for imported materials including road sheeting, rockfill and drainage gravel and 
drainage sand have been extracted from the 3D CAD Models.  Budget pricing has been 
obtained from a local earthworks contractor for supply of these materials to site.  The 
costs for placement of the materials, compaction and moisture conditioning (where 
required) have been taken from Knight Piésold's cost database from similar earthworks 
projects in Australia. 

Management Costs 

The Project will be implemented using an EPCM approach, whereby the EPCM 
Contractor will provide design, procurement, construction management, project 
management and commissioning supervision services on behalf of the Owner, based on 
the agreed project schedule. 

The EPCM services cost estimate allows for the cost of home office and site staffing, sub-
consultants, office consumables, equipment, and associated project travel.  The 
engineering design component of the EPCM estimate for the home office has been 
derived from a deliverables based estimate required to complete the Project and has been 
benchmarked against previous Lycopodium experience on similar projects.   

The EPCM costs for the process plant component of the Project represents approximately 
14.3% of the direct costs (excluding Owner's costs and management costs) of the process 
plant facility. 

The management costs also include the costs for the design of the RSF, ponds and 
roads. 

Included in management costs is also an estimate for specialist vendor representatives 
expected to be required to assist with construction verification and commissioning. 

Owners Costs 

A separate estimate has been prepared and approved by EMC to cover Owner's costs 
including: 

• Owner's project management team. 

• Some additional testwork. 

• Miscellaneous consultancy costs (excluded from EPCM services). 

• Licensing and permit costs (most notably for a water licence). 

• Insurance. 

• Pre-production labour costs (prior to introducing ore to the plant).  An average of 
three months labour costs for the complete operations team has been allowed for 
pre-production labour.

Table 21.13 summarises the source of pricing by major commodity, weighted by value of 
the direct permanent works (excluding temporary works, construction services, 
commissioning assistance, EPCM costs and contingency), including supply and 
installation.

Contingency 

The contingency allowance is shown as a separate amount in the CCE and has been 
applied on a WBS line-by-line basis in accordance with Lycopodium's estimating 
guidelines. 

Contingency has been provided to cover anticipated variances between the specific items 
included the estimate and the final total installed project cost.  The contingency does not 
cover scope changes, design growth, etc., or the listed qualifications and exclusions. 

Contingency has been applied in a deterministic manner by assessing the level of 
confidence in each of the defined item cost inputs.  It should be noted that contingency is 
not a function of the specified estimate accuracy, and should be measured against the 
project total that includes contingency.

EMC Metals Australia has supplied a fixed and variable water operating cost from their 
discussion with water brokers in the region.  These figures are as follows: 

 Fixed maintenance cost of A$20,000 per annum. 

 Variable cost of A$1,170 per ML of water consumed. 

LPG will be used as the fuel source for the operation of the steam boiler for production of 
HP steam for the HPAL.  LPG will be delivered to site and transferred to a pressurised  
50 t bullet on site.  This will provide approximately six days of storage.  A price of  
A$0.50 /L has been supplied by ELGAS, with an additional US$18,000 per annum for 
LPG site storage. 

Power consumption for the process plant has been calculated based on the mechanical 
equipment and subsequent electrical load list.  During normal plant operation, the overall 
absorbed power requirement for the process plant is 1.3 MW.  For this study, Essential 
Energy has supplied a fixed and variable tariff for connection into the existing 33kV supply 
which runs adjacent to the Barrier Highway, approximately 5 km from the project site.  
These figures are as follows: 

 Fixed connection fee of A$7,358 per month. 

 Variable cost of A$0.104 /kWh. 

Table 21.18 shows the required power and subsequent annual cost by major plant area. 

Table 21.18 Power Usage and Cost Summary 

 

Diesel is required for the process plant mobile equipment fleet.  The required consumption 
has been calculated based on the number, type and average operating time for each 
vehicle.  An annual consumption of 290 kL is required, which based on the Australian 
three month moving average diesel price of A$1.22 /L, results in an annual diesel 
operating cost of US$247,500.

Labour cost 

The Nyngan processing plant will require a workforce of 73 personnel.  The process plant 
will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on a 12 hour shift, four panel roster.  The 
workforce will include both day and shift personnel, depending on the job position.  It is 
anticipated that the majority of the workforce will be recruited from the regional area, 
which includes a number of existing mines and mineral processing operations. 

Operating labour costs include remuneration for all personnel required for the operation of 
the processing plant and general and administration facilities.  Operating labour costs 
accounts for approximately 31% of the total operating cost for the plant. 

The manning numbers and positions were developed by Lycopodium with input and 
agreement from EMC.  Remuneration rates for employees for both process plant and 
general and administration personnel were based on information from the 2105 Hays 
Salary Guide for Resources and Mining in New South Wales (NSW), with 
acknowledgement of some increased salary rates for personnel in key positions and with 
specialised expertise in high pressure acid leach mineral processing.  

There has been no inclusion in the labour operating cost for operator training or 
commissioning personnel.  These labour items have been capitalised in the owner's costs.

Contracts and Consultant Expenses 

A general philosophy has been applied of limiting operating personnel to those tasks and 
responsibilities considered essential to the operation.  Certain functions have been 
deemed to be more appropriately carried out by external contractors and consultants.  

Contract expenses relate generally to agencies that supply goods or services to the 
project on a renewable contract basis.  In general, these expenses have been determined 
on a dollar allowance basis and include items such as: 

 Specialist maintenance and engineering services such as major pump overhauls, 
crane servicing, gearbox overhauls, etc. 

 External laboratory analyses for environmental testing, product analysis and third 
party QA / QC. 

 Specialised laboratory equipment maintenance and licensing.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Basis of Estimate 

The economic performance of the project, as outlined in this Feasibility Study (DFS), has 
been valued using a constant dollar cash flow forecast, based on predicted revenue, costs 
and capital requirements.  The cash flow stream has been discounted by various discount 
rates to generate Net Present Values (NPV's) for a 21 year project plan, including an 
initial construction year.  Both pre-tax and after-tax NPV results are presented, at various 
discount rates.  Discounted cash flow-internal rate of return ("DCF-IRR" or "IRR") results 
are also presented, again on both a before-tax and an after-tax basis.  The effects of 
changes in key inputs has also been assessed and presented in a sensitivities review. 

This DFS is based on a finalised flow sheet design for the project.  No results are included 
for any alternative process designs, and no expansion cases have been presented.  This 
DFS does combine the best currently known options for process design and project 
development for this scandium resource, as supported by completed test work. 

All project returns are shown on a 100% owned basis.  The Nyngan Scandium Project is 
100% owned by EMC Metals Australia Pty. Ltd., which is in turn 80% owned by SCY and 
20% owned by Scandium Investments LLC. (SIL), a private Nevada Corporation, owned 
by a group of US-based investors. 

Project returns are presented on a 100% equity basis.  The cash flow model is 
constructed with annual revenue and cost inputs, plus scheduled annual capital cost 
inputs.  No leverage has been applied to the economics or the financial results - all project 
capital is assumed provided from equity sources.  No leasing of capital items has been 
assumed for plant or infrastructure, although periodic contract mining rates do assume 
contractors will provide their required equipment. 

The cash flow model is a constant dollar model, and no inflation is assumed in costs, 
revenues, or margins.  NPV discount rates need to be viewed as constant dollar rates as 
well. 

Annual cash flows are discounted back to 'time zero', specifically 1 January 2017 
(beginning period convention), to arrive at NPV and IRR calculations. 

22.2 Cash Flow Model – Financial Summary 

The project exhibits strong financial returns from initial capital investment of US$87.1M, 
with the direct mechanical items sourced in either US dollars (US$), Euros (€) or 
Australian Dollars (A$), and all local erection, installation and infrastructure sourced in 
Australian dollars (A$).  All project revenues, capital costs, operating costs, and financial 
returns have been converted to US$, and presented in this DFS in US$, unless otherwise 
noted.

Project after-tax NPV (10% discount rate) is US$177.5M, generating an IRR of 33.1% and 
a 3.3 year payback on initial invested capital. Project investment spending to date, and 
through to commencement of detailed design and construction, is considered sunk cost 
and is not a part of the financial returns.  Financial returns from the economic model are 
shown in Table 22.1.

Q1 2018.   Working capital totalling US$2M is not in the initial capital cost, but is 
accumulated over the 2018 to 20 period as production ramps up, reflecting 30 day 
payment terms on product shipments. 

Sustaining plant and operations capital is provided as an annual expensed contingency, 
and totals US$3.6M over the life of the project.  Sustaining tailings pond capital is similarly 
provided for and expensed annually to operating costs, and totals US$22.4M over the life 
of the project.  While these costs are often treated as capital items, and the initial tailings 
pond cost is included in the project capital cost, these ongoing expenses have been taken 
through the income statement and cash flow annually, due to their annual recurrence.  
They are not treated as sustaining capital items, as presented.  They are also treated as 
cash unit production costs, where those figures are provided. 

The initial capital cost is spread over a number of areas, but the high pressure autoclave 
systems (HPAL), leaching and neutralisation circuits are the most significant capital items, 
totalling direct mechanical costs of US$33M or 38% of total costs.  EPCM costs, Owners 
costs, and all contingency allowances total US$21.6 M or 25% of total costs. 

Details of the elements of capital are presented in Table 22.3.

single largest processing cost is sulphuric acid (H2SO4), followed by labour costs and 
other reagents used in the solvent extraction circuits.  Transport does contribute to these 
costs, as the property is in a rural location, but utilities are accessible and the pressure-

atmospheric process systems previously tested. 

The cash flow inputs reflect the key operating assumptions described in Table 22.4. 

Table 22.4 Key Operating Costs Summary 

 

22.5 Project Scope 

The cash model is based on a 20-year mine plan to process limonite resources only.  
Saprolite resources underlie the limonite, and they tend to hold lower scandium grades 
and require different leaching parameters to be effectively processed.  SCY has 
completed adequate testing to determine that campaign-processing one resource type at 
a time, or potentially concurrently through separate process streams, is economically 
desirable as to cost and recovery. 

The project will process 1.44 Mt of limonite resource out of a total 8.9 Mt of measured and 
indicated (M&I) limonite resource, at a planned average head grade of 408ppm, 
somewhat higher than the 277ppm average limonite resource (M&I) grade.  The higher 
grade is achieved by mine location in higher grade sections of the resource.  The overall 
resource (limonite and saprolite, plus minor amounts of included hematite and bedrock

material) totals 16.8 Mt at 235ppm.  Planned resource consumption, as outlined in this  
20 year DFS, represents approximately 8.6% of the total available M&I resource. 

Please refer to Sections 14 to 16 for further discussion on the ability of the mine plan to 
achieve these higher initial grades.  The project plan calls for a 12 month construction 
program throughout 2017, wet commissioning in January to February 2018, followed by 
initial ramp-up production beginning in March 2018.  The project is planned to reach 
annual nameplate capacity of 38 tpy scandia production in 24 months, in December 2019. 

22.6 Basis of Review Estimate 

Sales revenues are based on SCY pricing knowledge in the market today, independent 
spot market pricing done at the time of this report, direct conversations as to off-take and 
pricing with key customers, and an existing off-take agreement with a customer capable of 
processing scandia into master alloy or aluminium alloy.  The market for scandium oxide 
is not developed, or at all transparent.  Based on these market discussions, the Report 
establishes an average long term FOB price for oxide of US$2,000 /kg.  See Section 19 
for further detail. 

22.7 Currency Exchange Rate Assumptions 

The cash flow model is expressed in US dollars (US$), and any locally-sourced or 
Australian currency-based costs have been converted at an exchange rate of 
A$1.00:US$0.70.  The US$ rate as of the writing of this report is US$0.75 (4 April 16). 

The Australian dollar traded historically at or above parity with the US$ from 2011 through 
much of 2013, when it began a weakening trend against the US$ and other currencies.  
The currency settled into the A$1.00:US$0.75 range in 2015 and hit lows in the 
A$1.00:US$0.68 range in September 2015, repeated again in January 2016. 

The Nyngan Project has exposure to a change in the A$ / US$ relationship, because 
operating costs are largely in Australian dollars, while revenues are expected to be 
denominated in US dollars, and with international customers.  The project requires a  
20-year view on exchange rates, although it will be most sensitive to rates in 2017, as that 
is the construction year for the project, and approximately 70% of the construction costs 
were bid in Australian dollars.  This vendor bidding took place predominantly in Q1 2016, 
when the exchange rate was A$1.00:US$0.69 to 0.71.  Banks and financial institutions 
offer forecasts, and the consensus offered on Bloomberg indicates A$0.71 cents for the 
first half of 2017, A$0.74 cents by the end of 2017, and A$0.75 cents as the broker-
consensus forecast for full year 2018.  The range of individual broker estimates in these 
years varies from A$1.00:US$0.67 to 0.89, with approximately 50% of the opinions at or 
under A$1.00:US$0.75.

22.8 Mine Closure and Salvage Costs 

The cash flow model includes US$5.2M in costs for tailings pond closure, expensed one 
year after the final year of operation, which is 2038.  The pond will likely have reached its 
optimal size at this time, and would need to be reclaimed in any event.  The model does 
not include any costs for demolition of facilities, or recovery of value for equipment or 
facilities in the form of salvage.  The site would be a suitable industrial site, with utilities 
services in place, perhaps suited to a solar farm similar to the AGL 102 MW solar farm 
located close to the mine site.  This report did not conduct detailed investigations of 
alternate site uses for the project facility after 20 years, because the Measured and 
Indicated scandium resource is considerably larger than the current project would 
consume, allowing for either expansions of capacity, extensions of the 20-year initial time 
period of operation, or both.  One or both of these project extensions is viewed as more 
likely, based on markets for product, than a closure of operations in 20 years. 

22.9 Taxes and Royalties 

The property is burdened by five royalties, each different as to amounts and the 
circumstance to which they have been established. Each has been modelled and included 
in the cash flow analysis.  The royalties fall under two categories: revenue-based and 
profit-based, defined and detailed as follows: 

 Revenue-Based Royalties, Levied on Revenue (less freight). 

- Jervois Mining Limited Royalty.  1.7% of actual sales prices on 
oxide, subject to a 10 tpy minimum once production commences, 
and a 12 year time period to expiry

Page 22.9 

May 2016 
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd 

- Lenders Royalty.  0.2% of actual sales prices on oxide, subject to a 
cap of US$370,000 total payout, expected to be approximately 2.5 
years of production 

- New South Wales Mineral Royalty.  4% on actual sales prices, but 
refining, processing, and freight costs may be deductible for 
calculation of royalty payable.  The royalty runs in perpetuity 

- Jennings Royalty.  A 0.7% royalty payable on actual sales prices of 
scandium products or other mineral products, net of any freight 
costs.  The royalty runs in perpetuity. 

 NPI's – Net Profit Royalties, levied on Pre-Tax Income: 

- Plumbum & Canateal Royalty.  1.5% on actual sales prices, but all 
costs of production are allowable deductions, so this is a percentage 
on earnings before tax.  The royalty runs in perpetuity. 

Australian Federal corporate taxes are currently 30% on pre-tax income generated from 
Australia-source business assets and entities, and 30% is the long-term tax rate 
assumption applied to the project.  There are opportunities for this rate to be reduced in 
2016 (28% proposed), but the rates have not been made into law as of the writing of this 
report, and the current rates have been retained and applied. 

Australia offers attractive research tax credits, referred to as an R&D Tax Concession 
Program.  These credits are intended to encourage technology application in new 
businesses, and SCY anticipates that the Nyngan Project, as the first primary scandium 
mine / mill in Australia, would qualify.  The new program offers a 45% refundable tax 
offset (equivalent to a 150% tax deduction) in advance of production, and a 40%  
non-refundable tax offset (equivalent to a 133% tax deduction) after revenues exceed 
A$20M.  Foreign R&D spend is also eligible now, so long as it is matched by Australian-
based R&D work.  The cash flow model assumes A$1.5M in eligible benefits will generate 
a US$0.45M credit on company tax payable in the first year of operation, 2017. 

Australia levies a Goods and Services Tax ("GST") on sales of most items.  GST has not 
been included in the cost of all consumables that make up operating costs, and therefore 
no allowance has been made in the cash flow for recovery of the tax, which would 
otherwise be recoverable.  Export sales of product are exempt from GST, and no 
Australian sales of product are assumed in the cash model. 

22.10 Sensitivities to Key Variables 

Various project economic and operating risks to the base case development plan were 
assessed and can be seen below.  The risks were segregated into three categories, as 
follows: 

 Sensitivity to product pricing assumptions, as shown in Table 22.5. 



NYNGAN SCANDIUM PROJECT 
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT  
 
 
 

3185\16.04\3185-000-GEREP-0001_0 S22 
 

Page 22.10 

May 2016

 Sensitivity to other operating financial parameters, such as production cost, 
capital cost, and exchange rate changes.  Product pricing variances are shown 
again, but in scale to the other variants in this table (± 10%).  These sensitivities 
are shown in Table 22.6. 

 Sensitivity to production and operating parameters, such as mill recoveries, mill 
availabilities, the production ramp-up timeframes to nameplate capacity, and 
resource head grade assumptions, as shown in Table 22.7. 

As illustrated in the three tables below, the project generally maintains IRR's of 30% under 
negative variances of 10% over most of the typical exposure elements in operations. 

 Product price sensitivity beyond 10% is significant, although pricing variances 
would need to approach high cost producer cash costs to drop the IRR below 
20%. 

 Exchange rates are an exposure area, as the project is a US-functional currency 
project, with virtually all operating costs and a majority of the initial capital spend 
grounded in Australian dollar terms.  The FX rate used in the DFS reflects the Q1 
2016 rate at the time capital and operating cost bids were submitted.  Australian 
sourced equipment, which benefited significantly from the weak A$ during this 
timeframe, may not remain competitive against Asian or US capital item bid 
options at some of the unfavourable exchange rate scenarios explored in the 
sensitivities table.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Project Risks 

24.1.1 Overview 

Risk management is an integral component of project management and provides project 
managers with a set of tools to assist with project planning and execution.  Additionally, 
risk management provides assurance to key stakeholders that a credible and structured 
process has been undertaken in identifying, evaluating, analysing and treating the risks 
associated with the project development and the project's jurisdiction.  Assurance and 
confidence is achieved by demonstrating that: 

 Risks to the project have been identified, assessed and categorised. 

 Risks have been mitigated, as much as possible. 

 "Remaining" or "inherent" risks associated with the investment opportunity are 
clearly stated and the future variance in the project has been documented as 
much as possible to limit impact on the project resulting from unidentified risks. 

An initial risk register has been prepared for the project.  This risk register has been 
populated by the following contributing companies: 

 SCY/EMC-A. 

 Lycopodium. 

 Altrius Engineering. 

 Knight Piésold. 

 Mining One. 

 RW Corkery. 

Risks have been categorised into the following areas: 

 Political. 

 Environmental. 

 Health and Safety. 

 Contract.

24.1.3 Risk Definitions 

Risk 

Risk is defined as the chance of something happening that will have an impact upon 
objectives.  It is measured in terms of consequences and likelihood. 

Risk Assessment 

A risk assessment provides the project with a structured process for identifying and 
responding to risks that may affect the project's achievement of objectives.  It is the overall 
process of risk analysis and risk evaluation. 

Consequence 

The impact is the effect on the project phase if a given event occurs.  Consequence 
criteria are defined in Table 24.1. 

Likelihood 

Likelihood represents the possibility that a given event will occur.  Likelihood criteria are 
defined in Table 24.2. 

Risk Ranking 

The ranking of risks based upon an assessment of the likelihood and consequence.  This 
provides a mechanism for prioritising action plans.  Risk rankings are defined in Table 
24.3. 

Risk Control 

That part of risk management, which involves the implementation of policies, standards, 
procedures and physical changes to eliminate or minimise diverse risks. 

Note:  The implementation of controls provides two potential benefits: 

 To reduce the likelihood and/or the consequences if the event occurs. 

 May provide additional "upside" benefits as a result of the new control, e.g. a new 
control implemented to mitigate a risk event, may increase capacity of the 
process, thus having a direct financial (or other) benefit. 

Risk Appetite 

The level of risk an organisation is willing to take to achieve the desired return.

24.1.4 Risk Management Plan 

The risk register will be an essential tool for the ongoing management of the project risk 
profile.  Moving forward, it will be maintained by the EMC-A team and be reviewed 
frequently, with mitigating strategies being reviewed for effectiveness and modified if 
necessary. 

As the project proceeds through the next phases of the development lifecycle, risks will 
change in accordance with activities carried out during these phases.  To ensure that 
existing risks are reviewed, and new risks identified and assessed, risk assessment will be 
undertaken during each subsequent phase of the project.  The risk assessment outcomes 
will provide a solid foundation for the development of action plans to address the 
perceived risks. 

24.1.5 Identified Extreme Risks

TEC-3-04 

Unable to connect to grid 
power.  The existing 33kV 
supply line has insufficient 
capacity to supply power to the 
plant.  It requires an upgrade, 
and this must be undertaken 
by the responsible party, 
Essential Energy.  There is 
some risk that this work may 
not be completed in time for 
plant start-up. 

The progress of Essential Energy in 
upgrading the 33kV supply line needs 
to be monitored during detailed 
design.  If there is some doubt over 
their ability to deliver, alternatives such 
as additional diesel generators should 
be incorporated into the plant.

24.2 Opportunities 

A number of opportunities have been identified during the course of the study.  These 
include: 

 Alternative Sulphuric Acid Supply.  Currently, it is intended to ship sulphuric 
acid to site from a NSW coastal port.  It is possible that by the time the Project is 
built that an alternative supply of sulphuric acid will be available from the Dubbo 



NYNGAN SCANDIUM PROJECT

Zirconia Plant located approximately 200 km from the site.  This would likely 
result in a reduced cost of sulphuric acid supply. 

 In-Pit Residue Disposal.  There is some potential that residue streams may be 
able to be stored within the mine pit at a future point (say year 10 of operation) 
rather than being stored in the above-ground residue storage facility.  If this were 
to occur, the future costs of raising the walls of the residue storage facility would 
be reduced. 

 Reduction in Residue Storage Facility Liner Requirements.  Recent test work 
results have indicated that the concentration of chromium VI in the residue may 
be effectively managed to significantly lower levels than the concentration 
indicated in the residue testing conducted by Knight Piésold for the original 
design of the RSF.  If this test work can be confirmed, it has the opportunity to 
reduce the liner requirements within the RSF. 

 Removal of Regeneration Stage in Solvent Extraction.  Recent test work has 
indicated the potential to remove the regeneration stage in the solvent extraction 
circuit, without a negative impact on either recovery or product purity.  Further 
test work may confirm this potential. 

 Reduction in HCl Acid Consumption.  Recent test work has indicated the 
potential to reduce the HCl and chloride concentrations in the solvent extraction 
strip liquor, without a negative impact on either recovery or product purity.  
Further test work may confirm this potential. 

 Increase in Product Purity.  Recent test work involving optimising the 
calcination temperature for the oxalate and alternative wash solutions has 
indicated the potential to produce higher purity scandium oxide product.  If 
scandium oxide can be produced at 99.9% purity, this is likely to attract a 
premium in the market, with customers who require this purity level.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Technical 

This Technical Report details the engineering and study work that examines continuous 
high pressure acid leaching of the Nyngan scandium deposit and subsequent processing 
to produce a scandium oxide product.  The basis for the design has been dedicated test 
work specifically addressing the flowsheet that has been developed by Lycopodium and 
Altrius Engineering Services.  The flowsheet used in the PEA for the project has been 
superseded and improved.  Some aspects of the flowsheet are the subject of patent 
applications and have not been detailed fully to avoid potential voiding of patent claims.  
Overall processing facility recovery of scandium is 83.7% and product purity has 
increased substantially compared to the process that was detailed in the PEA. 

The Lycopodium and Altrius Engineering Services technical teams have reviewed the test 
work that forms the basis of the flowsheet detailed in this report, and are satisfied that 
HPAL leaching, followed by solvent extraction with a primary amine and scandium oxalate 
precipitation and calcination has been demonstrated by test work and process modelling 
to be a viable process flowsheet.  It is noted that the full process has not been piloted in a 
locked cycle fashion, and as a result there remains some technical risk with respect to 
build up of impurities in recycle streams.  However, it is considered that sufficient margin 
has been allowed in the design to accommodate this risk.  Additional test work has been 
recommended in Section 26.1.3 to address this.  Dr. Nigel Ricketts has personally 
directed some of the test work to ensure that it meets the requirements to develop capital 
and operating costs to the level required for a definitive feasibility study. 

Resource definition is at a suitable level for project development.  The current process 
plant design is suitable for the limonite portion of the resource only.  The 20 year mine 
plan defines and utilises Reserves in the Proven and Probable classification. 

The Lycopodium technical team have developed a mechanical equipment list and process 
engineering variables which have been used to developed a capital cost estimate 
consistent with +15%/-5% accuracy.  They have also developed a rigorous operating cost 
estimate, with reagent usage data provided by a fully converged METSIM mathematical 
model of the proposed process.  The accuracy of the operating cost provided is ± 15% 
accuracy. 

Mining costs have been developed by Mining One via a process of preliminary tendering 
with a number of local contractors.  Pricing was based on preliminary scheduling and 
design and are subject to the costings for load and haul at the time of conducting this 
study and are consistent with a +15%/-5% accuracy.  Additional services have been 
obtained from industry suppliers and have been built into the mining cost model 
accordingly. 

The infrastructure for the project is excellent and well understood.  Plans appear to be in 
place to continue with progression of these in the future.  Evidence of suitable 
negotiations with government agencies and major suppliers was provided to the QPs.

Both water supply and electricity supply contracts will need to be finalised.  Opportunities 
exist for negotiation on sulphuric acid and LPG gas supply contracts or even 
replacements with LNG as an alternative. 

25.2 Commercial 

In development of a capital cost estimate, the technical team has taken into account the 
relatively small size of the operation.  The ability to employ modular design systems, 
consisting of modules of multiple pieces of equipment, has been considered, in particular. 
in the feed preparation and solvent extraction circuits.   

The capital cost and operating cost estimates have been used in a financial model that is 
consistent with industry norms.  The model includes provisions for sustaining capital costs 
and owner's costs. 

A US$2,000 /kg sale price for scandium oxide has been used.  This price is conservative 
based on current prices.  This price is supported by a three year sales contract for 
approximately 27.5% of estimated plant production over the three year period, and 56% of 
estimated plant production in the initial production year. 

An independent marketing study, commissioned by SCY has forecast growth in the 
scandium market exceeding the capacity of the proposed plant, by a factor of two to four 
times over the 10 year market demand estimate.  The marketing study focussed this 
demand estimate on two principal market opportunities, while SCY considers many more 
potential markets to be viable as well.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Technical 

26.1.1 HPAL Leaching 

Further work in HPAL leaching is recommended to test a number of parameters which 
have design implications for equipment selection: 

 Further test work on the optimum slurry density in the autoclave. 

 HPAL work on the limonite material from the area known as the eastern pit, as 
this is potentially higher grade material. 

 Examining process variables to attempt to reduce the soluble aluminium content 
in the leach solution. 

26.1.2 CCD Circuit 

Further work is recommended to examine a broader range of flocculants and coagulants 
to improve the CCD thickener underflow density in an effort to reduce soluble scandium 
losses 

26.1.3 Solvent Extraction 

Whilst the solvent extraction flowsheet appears to be robust, further solvent extraction test 
work is recommended on solution straight from HPAL operations, preferably utilising an 
extended pilot plant operation. 

26.1.4 Tailings 

While the Residue Storage Facility is relatively small, the tailings dam design will still need 
to be engineered.  This activity should include test work on final settled density (once the 
CCD work has been concluded) and the effect of likely impurities in the decant water from 
the tailings dam when it is returned to the process water circuit. 

26.1.5 Scandium Oxalate Precipitation 

Scandium oxalate precipitation test work should be conducted on real HPAL solutions that 
have passed through solvent extraction in order to determine the following: 

 Further definition of the operating window where high grade hydrated scandium 
oxalate is produced. 

 Further definition of the operating window for calcination of the hydrated 
scandium oxalate precipitate, including potential differential thermal analysis.

26.1.6 Mining 

Mining cost data and production data are consistent with the requirements of a feasibility 
study however further work is recommended to validate the robustness of the input 
assumptions, including: 

 Extending test work on core to include mechanical properties of the lateritic 
material to validate the free dig assumptions applied in this study. 

 Validating groundwater flow by conducting additional pump tests on a number of 
local bore holes. 

26.2 General 

The project has been shown to have developed a viable process flow sheet and modelled 
economic analysis has been shown at the DFS level to be attractive.  The 
recommendation is therefore to proceed to project construction.  The following 
engineering pre-work is recommended: 

 Finalising / optimising the flowsheet with the recommended test work. 

 Examining possible alternative project execution strategies. 

 Additional specific and detailed discussions with vendors on the long lead items, 
in particular those associated with the autoclave. 

 Commencement of long-term tailings stability studies. 

 Advanced geotechnical studies to support mine engineering, Residue Storage 
Facility design, and process plant site design. 

Marketing efforts should be continued, with the goal of developing further off-take 
arrangements.  Increasing the surety that product produced from the Nyngan plant will 
have a ready market, at the projected price structure, will enhance the prospects of 
financing the project under favourable terms.
