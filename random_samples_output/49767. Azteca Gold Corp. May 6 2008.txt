1.0 SUMMARY 

This report provides a summary of the physical setting, geology, recent 
exploration history, and mineral exploration potential of the Geroe Creek exploration 
project (formerly called Copper Hammer), and provides recommendations for future 
exploration. The report was prepared at the request of Azteca Gold Corp. so as to 
conform to National Instrument 43-101 disclosure requirements.  The primary author, 
Mr. Edward Brennan, is a qualified person under Canadian Securities Administrators' 
National Instrument 43-101.

The Geroe Creek exploration project area is located in northern Alaska, 
approximately 260 miles north of Fairbanks, and lies in the Philip Smith Mountains on 
the south flank of the south-central Brooks Range in rugged terrain (Figure 1).  The 
project area sits primarily within the Chandalar mining district, but a small portion 
extends westward into the Koyukuk mining district.

The Brooks Range is located in the northern portion of the State of Alaska, 
U.S.A.  It is an east-west-trending, 600 mile long mountain range that extends from the 
western coast of Alaska into Canada's Yukon Territory.  It is considered to be the 
northern-most extension of the Rocky Mountains.  The highest point of elevation in the 
range is Mount Chamberlin at 9,019 feet.  The topography of the Brooks Range is 
characterized by broad U-shaped valleys, braided stream channels, morainal 
topography, and low mountains and plateaus on the northern coastal plain.
Geologically, the Brooks Range is composed of a series of lithotectonic assemblages all 
related to an ancient collision between continental and oceanic rocks.  The project area 
has seen recent glaciations and a rock glacier currently occupies the headwaters of 
Geroe Creek.

The Geroe Creek exploration project represents an early-stage exploration target 
considered prospective for the discovery of copper, lead, zinc, and molybdenum (± 
silver) mineralization.  Results of the first phase of exploration work suggest the 
presence of a porphyry Cu-Mo system associated with the Geroe Creek pluton, 
including possible mineralization continuing into the surrounding country rocks 
composed primarily of schist.  It is therefore recommended that further exploration 
include continued surface geochemical sampling, detailed geologic mapping, 
geophysics, and core drilling.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 The Geroe Creek exploration project is located within the Chandalar and 
Koyukuk mining districts of northern Alaska (Figure 2).  The area is accessed via the 
Dalton Highway by traveling approximately 260 miles north from Fairbanks, Alaska, to 
the town site of Wiseman, Alaska, then traveling approximately 35 miles northeast via 
helicopter to the project area.  Fairbanks is the nearest railhead. 

 The project is situated within an alpine area where winter temperatures can 
reach -50°F to -70°F in January and February. There is a complete loss of sunlight from 
early December to early January.  High temperatures in the summer can reach 90°F, 
but the average high temperature is in the mid 60s (°F).  Annual precipitation averages 
approximately 15 inches, and snowfall averages approximately 36 inches per year. 

 The project area is remote and essentially undeveloped.  The terrain is rugged 
and steep. The hill slopes are largely covered by rock talus, the valleys by alluvium and 
vegetation.  Presently, the project can only be reached by helicopter in the summer 
months by flying out of Wiseman, Alaska.  In the winter months an overland winter trail 
(the Coldfoot-Chandalar Lake Trail) allows partial access into the Chandalar mining 
district, but not into the project area itself.  In January 2007, the State of Alaska 
obtained a right-of-way access into the Chandalar area via the Coldfoot-Chandalar Lake 
Trail which allows the State of Alaska to construct a permanent, all-weather road along 
the Trail.  All-weather road access into the Chandalar area would positively impact 
exploration activities at Geroe Creek and adjacent areas by allowing improved and 
year-long access to the property. 

 The closest major airport to the Geroe Creek project area is in Fairbanks, Alaska.
Necessary supplies, equipment, and services to carry out exploration and mine 
development projects are available in Fairbanks.  A trained mining workforce is also 
available in Fairbanks.

 Existing current infrastructure at the project site is inadequate to support a large 
exploration or development crew. 

6.0 HISTORY 

 References to the Chandalar mining region are common in the earliest mineral 
investigations completely by the U.S. Geological Survey in the early 20

th
 century, 

particularly regarding the Little Squaw gold placer area.  Due to the close proximity of 
Little Squaw to the Geroe Creek project area, it is likely that mineralization in the Geroe 
Creek project area was recognized at that time as well.

 A 1967 U.S. Geological Survey preliminary map by E.H. Cobb entitled Metallic
Resources Map of the Chandalar Quadrangle, Alaska shows that one sample was 
collected by Cobb on Willow Creek just outside the Azteca claim block that contained 
detectable zinc.   Several more samples were collected outside but adjacent to the 



12

claim block and all contained detectable amounts of copper, zinc, lead, and/or silver.
Gold occurred in several locations south of the Geroe Creek claim block.

 In 1970, the U.S. Geological Survey released a preliminary map by Brosge and 
Reiser entitled Chemical Analyses of Rock and Soil Samples from the Chandalar and 
Eastern Wiseman Quadrangles, Alaska.  The report contains the location and analytical 
results of 207 samples and reports up to 2500 ppm Zn and 700 ppm Pb within the 
Geroe Creek claim block.  Another report by Brosge and Reiser (1970) entitled 
Chemical Analysis of Stream Sediment Samples, Chandalar and Eastern Wiseman 
Quadrangles, Alaska shows many stream sediment samples collected on and adjacent 
to the Geroe Creek claim block; however, the available written report for this document 
is incorrect on the USGS website.  Therefore, no analytical results are available for 
these samples at this time. 

 A 1972 U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper by Brosge and Reiser entitled 
Geochemical Reconnaissance in the Wiseman and Chandalar Districts and Adjacent 
Region, Southern Brooks Range, Alaska reports that gold and silver anomalies are 
often associated with base-metal anomalies in three general areas.  One of those areas 
is located just north of the Geroe Creek claim block within a carbonate terrane. 

 In 1983, Cobb and Cruz report that claims were staked in the Geroe Creek area 
in 1975 and 1976.  The target was a porphyry molybdenum deposit associated with the 
Geroe Creek pluton containing disseminated molybdenite and copper sulfide minerals. 

 According to Britton (2000), veinlets in the stockworks occurring within the Geroe 
Creek claim block contain disseminated chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and pyrite 
associated with intense quartz-sericite-chlorite ± epidote alteration.  Eakins and others 
(1983, p. 41) reported Mo grades as much as 0.1 percent, and Nokleberg and others 
(1987) report that zones in the plutons as much as several meters thick contain values 
of 0.6 percent Cu, 0.02 percent Mo, and 0.1 grams of gold per ton. 

 Two aeromagnetic surveys were flown over the western and eastern halves of 
the Chandalar quad in the early 70s and released as open-file reports by the U.S. 
Geological Survey.  The flights were along N-S traverses spaced 2 km apart in the 
western half of the quad and at 1.6 km in the eastern half of the quad.  Using those 
data, the U.S. Geological Survey published a Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF-
878C (two sheets) in 1978 (Cady, 1978).  Interpreting the original aeromagnetic data, 
Cady concluded that the Chandalar quadrangle exhibited strong, intra-lithological 
variations in the amount of magnetite in outcropping rocks.  Cady (1978) states that 
porphyry copper and molybdenum deposits are often associated with the granitic 
intrusions.  Moreover, two groups of thrust faults were recognized in and adjacent to the 
Geroe Creek claim block with one fault lying in a zone of molybdenum mineralization 
and the others lying in a zone of copper mineralization.  Cady (1978) concludes that 
aeromagnetic data suggest that magnetite mapping may aid in the delineation of 
copper, lead, zinc, and molybdenum deposits associated with the non- to weakly 
magnetic granitic and carbonate rocks and the magnetic calc-mica schist unit.  The 
Geroe Creek claim block contains two separate, but likely related, granitic plutonic 
bodies, the Chandalar pluton on the south and the Geroe Creek pluton on the north.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING 

Regional Geology  

 Located in the south-central Brooks Range of Northern Alaska, the Geroe Creek 
exploration project area occurs within the Arctic Alaska Terrane, a group of regionally-
extensive rocks underlying most of the North Slope and Brooks Range of Alaska (Figure 
4).  The Arctic Alaska Terrane is a geologic terrane composed of a series of lithologic 
belts (or subterranes) bounded by major thrust structures that record a Jurassic-
Cretaceous collision between a paleo-continental margin and oceanic rocks.
Precambrian- to Cenozoic-aged metasedimentary and igneous rocks comprise the bulk 
of the rock types exposed in the Arctic Alaska Terrane.  The Kobuk-Malemute fault zone 
forms the southern boundary of the Arctic Alaska Terrane and has accommodated 
various types of displacement, including thrusting, extension, and right-lateral strike-slip 
movement.   Field evidence suggests that this structure is presently active and 
represents a suture between the ancient continent and colliding oceanic rocks. (Oldow 
and Avé Lallemant, 1998). 

 The project area lies approximately 31 miles north of the Kobuk-Malemute fault 
zone within the lithologically-defined schist belt (known also as the Coldfoot subterrane).  
The schist belt (Figure 4) is composed of Proterozoic to Middle Devonian basinal 
sediments, locally intruded and overlain by volcanics and granitic intrusives of Devonian 
age.  The belt was variably metamorphosed under greenschist, blueschist, and, locally, 
amphibolite facies conditions.  Northeast- and east-west-trending structures form the 
majority of faults and folds regionally along the southern portion of the Brooks Range 
and these are the result of collision-related thrusting. 

Local Geology 

 The Geroe Creek project area occurs in the northern half of the USGS 250K 
Chandalar quadrangle.  According to mapping by Brosge and Reiser (1964), rocks in 
the quadrangle include various metasedimentary rocks, metavolcanics, 
unmetamorphosed limestone, shale, and quartzites.  Metavolcanics, volcanics, and 
granitic rocks intrude and/or are interbedded with the country rocks.  A figure illustrating 
the local geology of the Geroe Creek project area is unavailable at this time.  No digital 
maps are available at this time and no mapping has been conducted to date.  However, 
the Brosge and Reiser (1964) geologic map (250K scale) can be found online at the 
Alaska Department of Natural Resources website (see reference for link). 

 The Skajit allochthon (known also as the Hammond subterrane), which contains 
Cambrian to Upper Devonian limestone, schists, marbles, siliciclastics, volcaniclastics, 
and granitic intrusives (Gottschalk et al., 1998), occurs approximately 6 miles northwest 
of the Geroe Creek claim block.

 Thrust faults represent the main structures within and adjacent to the Geroe 
Creek project area; they typically trend northeast and dip to the north.

Property Geology 

 The Geroe Creek claim block contains a variety of Paleozoic schists and 
metasediments, locally intruded by Paleozoic/Mesozoic granitic rocks. Specific rock
types within the claim block include quartz-mica schist, schistose quartzite, chlorite-
muscovite schist, garnet-hornblende green schist, carbonate schist, hornfels, and 
igneous rocks that range from gneissic granite to quartz monzonite and granodiorite.  
According to published maps and reports, there appear to be no post-metamorphic 
igneous rocks present in the Chandalar Mining District.   Early Devonian Pb/Pb zircon 
ages are reported from the Chandalar pluton (a.k.a. Baby Creek batholiths) and Horace 
Mountain plutons 

 The dominant rock type within the claim block is the Devonian granitic 
orthogneiss, followed by approximately equal amounts of quartz mica schist and albite-
chlorite mica schist (Brosge and Reiser, 1964).  Calcareous schist, marble, and calc-
silicate hornfels are also present on the claim block in minor amounts.  The northern-
most tip of the northeast-trending Chandalar pluton (a.k.a. Baby Creek batholith) is 
present on the claim block and appears to be genetically and temporally related to the 
larger outcrop of granitic orthogneiss located towards the northwest named the Geroe 
Creek pluton.

 The following description for the Geroe Creek project area is found in the USGS 
Alaska Resource Data File, Chandalar Quadrangle, Alaska, Open-File Report 00-357 
(Britton, 2000): 

The Geroe Creek prospect is one of several quartz stockworks and altered zones in the 
northeast-trending belt of Devonian peraluminous biotite-muscovite granites of the Baby 

Creek batholith and the Devonian metaluminous biotite-hornblende granites and 

granodiorites of the Horace Mountain plutons (Newberry and others, 1986). Porphyritic 

phases are locally present in these plutons, and Young and others (1997) reported that 

the mineralizing intrusives are porphyritic meta-granodiorites and biotite meta-granites. 

The country rocks are mainly Paleozoic schists and marble along with peraluminous 

metagranodiorite.

Young and others (1997) also noted that there is no skarn development in the calcareous 

rocks.

 Alteration is characterized by intense sericitization and propylitization of the 
porphyritic host rocks; and quartz-sericite-chlorite ± epidote, and local calcite of the 
country rocks.

 Thrust faults represent the main structures within and adjacent to the Geroe 
Creek project area; they typically trend northeast and dip to the north.  It is not known at 
this time if other significant structures are associated with mineralization at the Geroe 
Creek project area.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Regional Deposits 

 The Arctic Alaska Terrane is composed of a series of lithologic belts (or 
subterranes) bounded by major thrust structures that record a Jurassic-Cretaceous 
collision between a paleo-continental margin and oceanic rocks.  Within the North Slope 
terrane, several different metallic deposits have been recognized and exploited.  They 
include base-metal porphyry, sediment-hosted base-metal, carbonate-hosted copper, 
volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS), and mesothermal gold-quartz vein deposits. 

 The Geroe Creek project area lies within a known Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag metallogenic 
province in northern Alaska and is immediately adjacent to a Au (Sb-W) metallogenic 
province (Clark et al., 1974).  Moreover, the project area lies adjacent to the presently 
inferred eastern-most boundary of the Hogatza plutonic belt (Hollister, 1978).  The 
Hogatza plutonic belt is one of three porphyry copper provinces identified in Alaska, 
extending from St. Lawrence Island off the western coast of Alaska, northeast-ward to 
the intersection between the Kaltag and Kobuk faults.

 Far outside the Chandalar quad region, but worth noting here, is the Arctic 
volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, which occurs at the western-most 
extension of the Cu (Pb-Zn) metallogenic province.  The Arctic VMS Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag 
deposit is hosted within the Ambler sequence, a stratigraphic unit occurring in the lower 
portion of the schist belt - the same belt in which the Geroe Creek and Little Squaw (see 
below) projects are situated.  The Arctic deposit, as well as several other known VMS 
deposits, occurs approximately 106 miles east of Kotzebue, Alaska, and currently ranks 
as one of the largest and richest VMS deposits in the world.   The Ambler Sequence 
has been identified and mapped approximately 60 miles southwest of the Geroe Creek 
claim block (Gottschalk et al., 1998).  

Local Deposits 

 Several deposit types as defined by Cox and Singer (1986) have been 
recognized in the Chandalar quadrangle and include:  low-sulfide Au-quartz veins; Sb-
Au veins; polymetallic veins; porphyry Cu and Cu-Mo; Cu, Zn, and Zn-Pb skarns; 
carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb and Cu; and placer Au (Britton, 2000).  By far, the dominant 
deposit type overall is the placer gold type. Polymetallic veins, base-metal skarns, and 
low-sulfide Au-quartz veins are all potentially significant lode deposits in the Chandalar 
quad region.  Within a 5-mile radius of the Geroe Creek claim block, the dominant 
deposit types are base-metal-rich porphyries, skarns, and polymetallic vein deposits.

 Presently, the most significant deposit located near the Geroe Creek project area 
is the lode and placer gold occurrence currently held by Little Squaw Gold Mining 
Company of Spokane, Washington.  This deposit is located approximately 15 miles 
southeast of the Geroe Creek claim block.



17

 The primary deposit type model being utilized at the Geroe Creek during the first 
phase of exploration is the calk-alkaline porphyry Cu-Mo model.  Ore controls for this 
type of deposit are typically igneous/wallrock contacts, internal igneous phase contacts, 
the cupola of the porphyry, associated dike swarms, breccia pipes/bodies, and fracture 
zones related to the intrusive event. The geochemical signature of calc-alkaline 
porphyry Cu-Mo deposits (Panteleyev, 1995) generally has a central Cu-rich zone 
associated with Mo, Au, Ag, and possibly Bi, W, B, and Sr.  A peripheral zone generally 
is enriched in a combination of any of the following:  Pb, Zn, As, Sb, Mn, V, Se, Te, Co, 
Ba, Rb, and occasionally Hg.

 These deposits are often characterized by an increase in the presence of 
magnetite, common to intrusive bodies, and previous aeromagnetic investigations 
(Cady, 1978) have confirmed that this is the case in the Chandalar quad region, and in 
particular, the Chandalar and Geroe Creek plutons.  Cady (1978) states that copper and 
molybdenum in the Chandalar area is commonly associated with granitic intrusions and 
concludes that aeromagnetic data may aid in the delineation of copper, lead, zinc, and 
molybdenum deposits associated with the non- to weakly magnetic units.   According to 
geochemical data and Cady's (1978) aeromagnetic interpretation, most of the base-
metal anomalies occur near the southwestern margin of the Geroe Creek pluton.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

 As of the writing of this report, not enough work has been conducted to fully 
characterize the mineralization occurring on the Geroe Creek claim block.  Core drilling 
intersected primarily schist and approximately 205 feet of schistose to weakly gneissic 
granitic Geroe Creek pluton.  Copper, lead, and zinc mineralization intersected in the 
core is present as two distinct types:  1) disseminated galena, sphalerite, and 
chalcopyrite in quartz-rich horizons of the chlorite-muscovite schist, and 2) quartz-
galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite ± carbonate veinlets in the granitic intrusion.  No 
molybdenum mineralization was encountered in either of the two drill holes.

 Outcrop samples containing anomalous Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn typically showed 
very little alteration other than that associated with regional metamorphism.  One 
sample, however, contained 1.2 ppm Ag, 40 ppm Cu, 588 ppm Mo, 799 ppm Pb, and 
198 ppm Zn, as well as72, 300 ppm Mn.  The sample is blue-black in color with a small, 
2x2 inch patch of rock that is strongly schistose, and orange in color.  The blue-black 
portion of the rock did not exhibit schistose texture and the color is likely a result of 
intense manganese alteration that appears to have locally replaced the original rock, 
possibly schist.  A minor amount of fresh and weakly oxidized pyrite is present in the 
sample and is localized within the orange-colored patch containing abundant muscovite.  
Neither Zn-, Pb-, nor Mo-bearing minerals were identified in the hand sample, but may 
be present as very fine grains.

 According to Britton (2000), veinlets in the stockworks occurring within the 
Chandalar and Geroe Creek plutons contain disseminated chalcopyrite, molybdenite, 
and pyrite associated with intense quartz-sericite-chlorite ± epidote alteration.  Eakins 
and others (1983, p. 41) reported Mo grades as much as 0.1 percent, and Nokleberg 



18

and others (1987) report that zones in both plutons as much as several meters thick 
contain values of 0.6 percent Cu, 0.02 percent Mo, and 0.1 grams of Au per ton. 

 All samples collected during Azteca's 2007 field season were analyzed for 34 
elements (Tables 3 & 4) using Fire assay with AA finish for Au and the ICP-AES method 
for the remainder of the elements. Mercury data were not collected.

 Plotting the available surface geochemical data (Figures 5-14), three metallic 
associations are observed on the Geroe Creek claim block:  1) Cu-Ag (±Au); 2) Pb-Mo-
W (±Cu, Zn) associated with elevated Sb; and 3) Zn, associated with elevated As and 
Cd.  These relationships are likely related to zones and halos of alteration and 
mineralization often associated with porphyry systems.  The highest concentrations of 
base-metal and silver mineralization are concentrated near the contact between the 
southwestern tip of the Geroe Creek batholith and the chlorite-muscovite schist.
Examining the hand sample data, the highest values occurred slightly more often in the 
intrusive, but were also fairly common in the adjacent schist.

10.0 EXPLORATION 

 Examination of the Geroe Creek project area during the 2007 field season 
consisted of an initial reconnaissance of the property, diamond core drilling, and 
collection of surface geochemistry samples between May and September, 2007.  Two 
diamond drill holes were drilled between July and August, 2007 (Figure 15) and 400 
surface geochemical samples in the form of rock chip (outcrop), stream sediment, and 
float samples were collected on the claim block between August and September, 2007 
(Figures 5 through 14).  Float samples were collected in the Geroe Creek cirque area 
and occasionally elsewhere where no outcrop or stream sediment samples were 
possible.  All the work was conducted on behalf of Azteca Gold Corp. by M2 Technical 
Services, Inc. of 4207 E. Rowan Ave., Spokane, Washington 99217.

 Reconnaissance consisted of aerial review followed by ground traverses and the 
collection of several outcrop and float samples from within the Geroe Creek glacial 
cirque.  The two core holes were drilled from the same pad immediately east of the 
Geroe Creek glacial cirque.  Diamond drill hole -001 was cut short at a total depth of

176' due to extremely difficult drilling conditions as a result of freezing drilling fluids.  
Diamond drill hole -002 was drilled to a total depth of 780' before being shut down due 
to inclement weather conditions affecting the higher elevations.  Both holes were 
collared in chlorite-muscovite schist, but only -002 intersected the granitic intrusion 
(Geroe Creek pluton) at approximately 575-780'. 

 Following the drilling phase of the exploration program, a field crew of three two-
man crews (4 geologists, 2 geotechnicians) collected surface geochemical samples 
over a two week period during the last week of August and first week of September, 
2007.  Field crews followed drainages and ridge tops with the intention of collecting 
outcrop and/or stream sediment samples. Stream sediment samples were collected 
every 200 meters along the major portion of selected active and seasonal streams.  The 
team personnel consisted of two experienced geologists, Nicole Preuss and Rick West, 
two junior geologists, Noelle Madera and Noah Ferree, and two geotechnical assistants, 
Randy Painter and Mic Wandler.     

 Results of the examination are described above under section 9.0 
MINERALIZATION. Sample locations are shown in Figures 5 through 14; location of the 
drill pad is shown in Figure 15.

11.0 DRILLING 

 Azteca Gold Corp. drilled two holes between July and August, 2007.  The 
authors are not aware that any historic drilling has been carried out on the Geroe Creek 
property prior to its acquisition by Azteca Gold Corp.   

 The two core holes were drilled from the same pad (located at 67° 41'N, 148° 
48'W) immediately east of the Geroe Creek glacial cirque (Figure 15).  Diamond drill 
hole -001 was cut short at a total depth of 176' due to extremely difficult drilling 
conditions resulting from freezing drilling fluids.  Diamond drill hole -002 was drilled to a 
total depth of 780' before being shut down due to inclement weather conditions.  Both 
holes were collared in chlorite-muscovite schist, but only -002 intersected the granitic 
intrusion (Geroe Creek pluton) at a depth of approximately 575'.  Elevated 
concentrations of arsenic, antimony, and manganese appear to be associated with 
silver and base-metal mineralization, and core hole logging shows this relationship to be 
particularly strong in the chlorite-muscovite schist unit, but less apparent in the igneous 
unit.

Core Hole CH107-DDH-001 

 Core hole -001 was drilled at an azimuth bearing of 108° and an inclination of
-60°.  This hole contains Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn mineralization.  In general, much of the 
significant mineralization occurs within the same or adjacent intervals.  Arsenic and 
antimony are locally elevated in certain intervals and are loosely associated with 
increased zinc concentrations.

 The following summarizes important precious- and base-metal mineralization in 
core hole -001:

Ag:   -- 57 - 62 ft contains the highest concentration of silver at 4.8 ppm; 
-- 152 - 176 ft contains an average concentration of 1.28 ppm over a true 

thickness of 20.8 feet.

Cu: -- 137 -142 ft contains the highest concentration of copper at 654 ppm; 
-- 137 - 167 ft contains an average concentration of 321.3 ppm over a true 

thickness of 26 feet. 

Mo: -- 57 – 62 ft contains the highest concentration of molybdenum at 165 ppm. 

Pb: -- 57 - 62 ft contains the highest concentration of lead at 1,190 ppm; 
-- 57 - 72 ft contains an average concentration of 559.3 ppm over a true 

thickness of 13 feet. 

Zn: -- 22 - 27 ft contains the highest concentration of copper at 563 ppm; 
-- 12 - 37 ft contains an average concentration of 253.4 ppm over a true

thickness of 13 feet; 
-- 137 - 157 ft contains an average concentration of 306 ppm over a true 

thickness of 17 feet. 

Core Hole CH107-DDH-002 

 Core hole -002 was drilled at an azimuth bearing of 0° and an inclination of -90° 
on the same pad as -001.  This hole contains Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn mineralization.  In 
general, much of the significant mineralization occurs within the same or adjacent 
intervals.  Manganese, arsenic, and antimony are locally elevated in certain intervals 
and appear to be associated with increased silver and base-metal concentrations.  This 
relationship is particularly evident in the schist unit and less apparent in the intrusive.   

 The following summarizes important precious- and base-metal mineralization in 
core hole -002:

Ag:   -- 94 - 95 ft contains the highest concentration of silver at 24.5 ppm; 
-- 91 - 105 ft contains an average concentration of 7.52 ppm over a true 

thickness of 14 feet;
-- 180 - 205 ft contains an average concentration of 1.64 ppm over a true 

thickness of 25 feet;
-- 275 - 295 ft contains an average concentration of 2.35 ppm over a true 

thickness of 20 feet. 

Cu: -- 94 - 95 ft contains the highest concentration of copper at 2,100 ppm; 
-- 91 - 95 ft contains an average concentration of 1,145 ppm over a true 

thickness of 4 feet; 



33

-- 265 - 300 ft contains an average concentration of 210 ppm over a true 
thickness of 35 feet. 

Mo: -- 220–225 ft contains the highest concentration of molybdenum at 139 ppm. 

Pb: -- 94 - 95 ft contains the highest concentration of lead at 6,230 ppm; 
-- 85 - 110 ft contains an average concentration of 1,335 ppm over a true 

thickness of 25 feet; 
-- 190 - 235 ft contains an average concentration of 273 ppm over a true 

thickness of 45 feet; 
-- 275 - 295 ft contains an average concentration of 359 ppm over a true 

thickness of 20 feet. 

Zn: -- 94 - 95 ft contains the highest concentration of copper at 3,340 ppm; 
-- 91 - 115 ft contains an average concentration of 864 ppm over a true 

thickness of 25 feet; 
-- 190 - 235 ft contains an average concentration of 554 ppm over a true 

thickness of 40 feet; 
-- 265 - 300 ft contains an average concentration of 568 ppm over a true 

thickness of 35 feet. 

 As of the writing of this report, not enough drilling has been conducted to fully 
characterize the mineralization occurring on the Geroe Creek claim block.

12.0 SAMPLING APPROACH AND METHOD 

Approach

 The Geroe Creek geochemical database consists of results from surface and 
core drilling samples. The authors believe that the samples are representative and of 
sufficient quality for use in this report. Samples were collected from easily accessible 
surface outcrops, stream sediments, float, as well as from the drill core after it was 
subjected to preliminary geologic core logging data collection (e.g., recovery estimation, 
fracture and joint measurements, etc.). A helicopter was used to transport personnel, 
field equipment, and samples to and from the project site. 

Sampling Method 

 Samples collected from outcrops were "rock chip samples," not channel samples.  
They were collected using a rock hammer directly off a lithologic outcrop, and placed in 
7"x12.5" sample bags.  A GPS point location was taken at each sample and captured in 
the GPS unit as well as in field notebooks.

 Stream sediment samples were collected using a No. 10, 8-inch brass sieve.  A 
3.5"x5" sample bag was filled with the sieved sample.  Each team collected a minimum 
of 3 samples per day that were not sieved and were duplicates of sieved samples taken 
at the same locations.  A GPS point location was taken for each stream sample.  It is 



34

important to note that the sieved stream sediment samples were not sieved down to the 
typical very fine 80-mesh size due to time constraints.  During sample preparation for 
analysis, all stream sediment samples were pulverized to the same standard as the 
outcrop samples.  This was done to decrease nugget effect that may have occurred due 
to that samples coarser sieve size.

 Float samples were collected during a site visit in May 2007 when snow covered 
the outcrops, or made it impossible to get to them.  During subsequent site visits in June 
through September, a float sample was collected during field work if the rock was 
viewed as interesting by the geologist and could not be readily traced back to the 
originating outcrop. If assay analysis warrants, further investigation of float samples 
would need to be conducted. 

 Sample location data was collected on hand held GPS units.  The x, y, z 
coordinates, plus the amount of error at each location was recorded in the pre-made 
sample books, the team field book, and captured by the GPS unit.  Other information 
recorded in the sample book included the general location and/or description (i.e., 
Geroe Creek, the cirque, etc.), a general description of the sample, and for stream 
samples whether they were sieved on not.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

 After collection, samples were taken daily to a field office and stored.  At the end 
of each field session, samples were transported directly to the Fairbanks ALS Chemex 
sample prep facility by an Azteca representative.   ALS Chemex prepared the samples 
by crushing (90% passing -10 mesh screen), pulverizing (95% passing -150 mesh 
screen), and a final splitting by a riffle splitter. Pulps were shipped by ALS Chemex to 
the ALS Chemex facility in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for assay and 
analysis.   All samples, including core and surface, collected during Azteca's 2007 field 
season were analyzed for 34 elements (Tables 3 & 4) using Fire assay with AA finish for 
Au and the ICP-AES method for the remainder of the elements.  Mercury data were not 
collected.  All the core, pulps, and non-ground material are currently being stored in a 
locked warehouse facility in Spokane, WA, USA.  

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

 A senior geologist contracted by Azteca Gold Corp. personally supervised all the 
exploration sampling and sample handling during each site visit, and supervised the drill 
core logging and sample collection processes.  Azteca Gold Corp. had all the assay and 
analytical data in this report carried out by ALS Chemex, utilizing laboratory facilities in 
Fairbanks, Alaska and Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  For more information on ALS 
Chemex, their website may be viewed at www.alsglobal.com. 

 The assay and geochemical results were captured from digital files that were 
downloaded directly from ALS Chemex website using password-protected access by 
either senior personnel of Azteca Gold Corp. or their contracting agent, M2 Technical 
Services. All ALS laboratories operate in compliance with ISO17025, with dedicated 



35

Quality Control Chemists in each major laboratory, a dedicated Quality Control Group in 
each region of the world, and a Global Technical Manager for each service area in 
which the company operates. ALS Chemex is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory 
providing industry standard analytical services.  The authors conclude the sampling and 
analyses were conducted under good industry standards.  Duplicate and blank samples 
were not submitted for analysis at this initial stage of exploration. 

 After the data were obtained, they were independently checked and found to be 
reasonable based on historic elemental concentrations and known deposit types of the 
area, as well as known detection limits as stated by the analytical laboratory.  Data 
validation procedures were then implemented on the assay datasets in order to ensure 
the quality and representative nature of the data.  This step included verifying that 
concentrations did not fall outside of the stated detection limits. 

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 Mining claims controlled by other entities are present west, south, and southeast 
of the Geroe Creek claim block and the majority of these claims, with the exception of 
Little Squaw, are placer claims.  The following information is not necessarily indicative 
of the same mineralization occurring on the Geroe Creek claim block. 

Little Squaw Mining Company 

 Presently, the most significant exploration project located near the Geroe Creek 
project area is the lode and placer gold occurrence currently held by Little Squaw Gold 
Mining Company of Spokane, Washington. This deposit is located approximately 15 
miles southeast of the Geroe Creek claim block.

 The following is an excerpt from the Little Squaw Gold Mining Company website 
(http://www.littlesquawgold.com):

Prospectors discovered the district about 100 years ago, and its recorded production 

from placer and lode mines is 84,000 ounces. There has been a substantial but unknown 

amount of unreported and otherwise secret production. Of the recorded production, 

76,000 ounces of gold or about 90 percent of the total was recovered from placer 

deposits. Most of the remaining 10 percent of the total was recovered from the Mikado 

Lode.

The Mikado is one of some thirty auriferous quartz-sulfide veins that are now 

documented on the property. The Mikado, together with the Little Squaw, Summit, and 

Eneveloe quartz lodes have been explored with a total of about 2,000 ft of underground 

workings and several hundred feet of dozer trenches and open cuts. The shallow (< 200 

ft) exploration drilling of these four lodes has been sparse and inadequate. 

All of the other veins remain virtually unexplored except for a few surface samples that 

have verified the presence of gold in them. The Chandalar district has not experienced 

any kind of exploration study utilizing modern exploration techniques.



36

 Pacific Rim Geological Consulting interprets gold mineralization at Little Squaw 
as follows: 

The known gold-quartz lodes are interpreted to be classic, 'orogenic', gold deposits 

hosted in metamorphic rocks in the general absence of plausible plutonic source for the 

generation of hydrothermal fluids and bear resemblances to other 'orogenic' or 'Mother 

Lode' type gold deposits worldwide. 

 Far outside the Chandalar quad region, the next most significant metallic deposit 
is the Arctic volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, which occurs at the western-
most extension of the schist belt and Cu(-Pb-Zn) metallogenic province discussed 
above.  The Arctic VMS Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag deposit is hosted within the Ambler sequence, 
a lower stratigraphic unit of the schist belt.  The Arctic deposit as well as several other 
known VMS deposits occur approximately 106 miles east of Kotzebue, Alaska.    

According to Novagold Resources' website (www.novagold.com):

The Ambler project contains multiple promising prospects, the most notable of which is 

the Arctic deposit. The Arctic deposit ranks among the largest and richest VMS deposits 

in the world based on both total in-situ metal value and value per tonne, with an 

historical resource estimated at 36.3 million tonnes averaging 4% copper, 5.5% zinc, 

0.8% lead, 0.7 g/t gold and 54.9 g/t silver. The contained precious metals in this 

historical resource total over 800,000 ounces of gold and 64 million ounces of silver, 

while the base metals total 3.2 billion pounds of copper, 4.4 billion pounds of zinc and 

640 million pounds of lead. 

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 No metallurgical testing has been performed on the precious metal mineralization 
occurring on the Geroe Creek property Azteca's knowledge.  The ore mineralogy 
observed in the sampling, core, and geochemical results to date are not sufficient to 
make any definitive conclusions regarding the metallurgical character of the 
mineralization at Geroe Creek. 

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

 The Geroe Creek property is in the early stages of exploration and therefore no 
mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates or calculations have been performed as 
of the writing of this report. The property presently has only two drill holes and there is 
insufficient data to make such estimates. 

18.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

Permitting 

 Azteca will need to obtain the necessary permits required for drill site reparation 



37

and drilling. The permitting should be carried out at the same time as subsequent 
surface mapping, drilling, and geochemical and environmental surveys.  

Geologic Mapping and Sampling 

 The property should be mapped in detail at a scale appropriate to the terrain and 
with consideration of any time constraints (i.e., short summers).  Generally a scale of at 
least 1:500 is appropriate.  Mapping should include lithology, contacts, structure, and all 
safely accessible underground workings should any be discovered on the property.
Chip and channel samples should be cut across all surface exposures of the 
mineralized areas. Sampling should at all times be directly supervised by a qualified 
geologist and not left solely to a crew of samplers. 

Preliminary Metallurgical Testing 

 As of the writing of this report, the Geroe Creek exploration project is in its 
earliest stages of exploration and therefore there is no need for metallurgical testing.  
However, should the status of the Geroe Creek exploration project change, large 
lithologic samples should be collected from drill core for metallurgical and density 
testing. The project geologist should consult with the metallurgical laboratory and a 
mining engineer prior to collecting the samples to determine the optimum sample types, 
distribution, and density. 

Establish the Preliminary Model and Inferred Mineral Resource 

 As of the writing of this report, the Geroe Creek exploration project is in its 
earliest stages of exploration and therefore there is insufficient data with which to 
construct a geologic model or infer a mineral resource.  However, should the status of 
the Geroe Creek exploration project change, results from the drilling and surface 
geochemical results would need to be synthesized to determine if the mineralization is 
of sufficient grade and continuity to meet the definition of "Inferred Mineral Resource". It 
is particularly important that the project geologist be directly involved with the mining 
engineer in the development of the geologic model and the resource estimate (if any). If 
the results from the different phases of drilling programs are positive, additional drilling 
will be necessary to infill at 50 to 100 meter spacing and farther down dip in order to 
upgrade the status of the resource and begin the feasibility phase of the program. 

19.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 The Geroe Creek exploration project represents an early stage exploration target 
considered prospective for the discovery of copper, lead, zinc, and molybdenum (± 
silver) mineralization.  Results of this work suggest the presence of a porphyry Cu-Mo 
system associated with the Geroe Creek pluton, including possible mineralization 
continuing into the surrounding country rocks which are composed primarily of schist 
with little carbonate.



38

 The first phase of drilling and sampling confirmed the presence of potentially 
significant copper, lead, zinc, and molybdenum (± silver) mineralization.  The Geroe 
Creek project area lies within a known Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag metallogenic province in 
northern Alaska and is immediately adjacent to a Au (Sb-W) metallogenic province 
(Clark et al., 1974).  Moreover, the project area lies adjacent to the presently inferred 
eastern-most boundary of the Hogatza plutonic belt (Hollister, 1978).  The Hogatza 
plutonic belt is one of three porphyry copper provinces identified in Alaska, extending 
from St. Lawrence Island off the western coast of Alaska, northeast-ward to the 
intersection between the Kaltag and Kobuk faults.

 In addition, the Geroe Creek project area occurs within rocks of the lithologically-
defined schist belt (a.k.a., Coldfoot terrane), which is known to contain several different 
metallic deposits, including base-metal porphyry, sediment-hosted base-metal, 
carbonate-hosted copper, volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS), and mesothermal gold-
quartz vein deposits.  The most important and significant deposits hosted by schist belt 
rocks is the nearby Little Squaw lode and placer gold occurrence located approximately 
15 miles southeast of the Geroe Creek claim block.  Another potentially important 
deposit is the Ambler Sequence-hosted Arctic VMS Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag deposit located in 
the Ambler Mining District of western Alaska.  Several outcrops of the Ambler Sequence 
have been mapped southwest of the Geroe Creek claim block. 

 The results of the drilling and surface geochemical sampling in conjunction with 
the geology, and location of the Geroe Creek project indicate a strong potential for silver 
and base-metal mineralization occurring on or adjacent to the currently held Geroe 
Creek claim block. 

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 Azteca Gold Corp. should proceed with exploration at the Geroe Creek claim 
block.  Phase I of the exploration program was completed in 2007 and should be 
continued with at least two more phases of exploration.  The intention of subsequent 
exploration programs should be to further explore and discover additional precious and 
base-metal mineralization within and outside the Geroe Creek project area.  Based on a 
review of the available project data, the property represents an excellent opportunity to 
discover additional precious- and base-metal mineralization, particularly zinc which 
appears to occur fairly extensively, even extending across and outside the Geroe Creek 
claim block.  

 The multi-element geochemical analyses obtained to date suggest higher 
concentrations of base-metals are associated with elevated levels of silver, manganese, 
arsenic, and antimony.   This observation is consistent with the geochemical signature 
of calc-alkalic porphyry Cu, Cu-Mo, Mo systems and therefore utilizing the associated 
exploration model is important and recommended. 

 The results from the initial drilling and surface geochemical survey indicate the 
presence of abundant base-metal mineralization on and adjacent to the present claim 
boundaries.  Therefore, it is the recommendation of the authors that this property merits 



39

significant additional work to explore and further define the potential resource. The 
objective of the exploration work should be to define a resource which meets the 43-101 
compliant definition of "Inferred Mineral Resource".  

 It is recommended that exploration be continued in the area to the north of the 
present claim boundary in carbonate rocks where elevated levels of gold, silver, copper, 
lead, zinc occur.  In addition, Azteca Gold Corp. should conduct a detailed examination 
around the perimeter of both the Geroe Creek and Chandalar plutons, which is where 
most of the molybdenum may be occurring. 

Phase II Exploration Program 

Phase II of the Geroe Creek exploration project should include:

1) Additional claim staking.  Based on a review of the available data, it is 
recommended that additional claims be staked in the Anderson Creek 
area, to encompass as much of the Geroe Creek pluton as soon as 
possible, and any area exhibiting anomalous levels of precious and 
base-metal mineralization (Chandalar pluton?) as well as possible 
indicator elements (e.g., As, Sb, Mn, etc.).  In addition, it is 
recommended that Azteca Gold Corp. remain informed on the progress 
of the area located approximately 6 miles west-southwest of Horace 
Mountain, where a known high-grade base-metal skarn is located, at 
the moment, on contested ground.

2) Establish a surface location grid.  This grid will assist in field mapping 
and geochemical and geophysical survey activities by providing 
geographic control.  The personnel surveying in the grid could also be 
utilized to collect samples at each grid survey point.  The grid should be 
designed appropriate to the terrain. 

3) Complete orientation surveys.  Complete geological, geochemical, and 
geophysical orientation surveys of the project area.  The intent of the 
orientation surveys is to acquire and develop the necessary knowledge 
to recognize the presence of significant anomalies versus background 
geochemical concentrations, and to determine which exploration 
methods, techniques, pathfinder elements, will be useful in identifying 
and delineating new areas of mineralization.

Azteca's preliminary surface geochemical survey of ground within and 
adjacent to the Geroe Creek claim block contains a sufficient number of 
samples with which to begin delineating possible drill targets and 
determining geochemical background concentrations of various major 
and trace elements; however more samples are needed.  As more 
samples are collected and analyzed, they can be added to the 
geochemical database, resulting in a refinement of background level 
determinations.  Care must be taken to differentiate igneous from 



40

sedimentary and metamorphic rocks when calculating background 
levels. 

4) Detailed surface mapping.  A detailed geologic mapping program to 
focus on lithologic identification, alteration, and better delineation of 
lithologic contacts, with particular attention to the igneous units.  This 
will aid in the determination and identification of potential host rocks 
(e.g., carbonate rocks, Ambler Sequence, etc.) and potential 
mineralizing units/events.  The mapping should be within and adjacent 
to the current Geroe Creek claim block and carried out at a scale 
appropriate to the terrain and any time constraints. 

5) Diamond core drilling.  Diamond core drilling and assaying of 2 to 4 NQ-
sized holes is recommended to a depth of no less than approximately 
1,300 feet.  Drill locations should be determined based on previous 
drilling and the currently available surface geochemical data.  Presently, 
it is recommended that the drills specifically target the Geroe Creek 
pluton in the vicinity of the Geroe Creek cirque, as well as the contact 
zone between the intrusion and the schist wallrocks to the west and 
southwest.

41

Phase III Exploration Program 

 Phase III of the exploration program would be contingent upon favorable results 
obtained in the Phase II exploration program.  The focus of Phase III exploration 
program would be to follow-up on the evaluation of any significant surface geochemical, 
geophysical, and drill hole mineralized intercepts recognized during the second phase 
of exploration.  This phase would likely consist of additional surface sampling, 
geophysics, drilling of 10+ drill holes, and the delineation of a geologic resource.  
Estimated cost for this program would be approximately $2,500,000.
