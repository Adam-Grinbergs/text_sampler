Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page ii

Summary (Item 3) 
 
1. Geostat received the mandate to estimate the resources of the Barry I gold deposit located in the 

Barry Township, Québec. The Barry I claims block (Next Figure), located in the centre part of 
the Barry property, consists of 6 claims.  The SDBJ owns 5 claims. Due to a bureaucratic 
constraint, Murgor and the SDBJ have an agreement where Murgor gets an exclusive and 
irrevocable interest of one hundred percent in the mineral substances that can be extracted from 
the property. Metanor bought 100% of the rights from Murgor.  For the last Claim, Metanor 
bought 100% of the rights from Murgor and Freewest.   

 
2. For this study, Geostat used all the technical data available for the 2006 NI43-101 technical 

report prepared for Murgor Resources Inc. (database in electronic format, core logs, an electronic 
set of cross-sections and paper files).  Metanor Resources Inc. provided all the most recent 
technical data about new drill holes. The author did not visit the site for this drilling campaign. 
Most of the validations are based on the visit of the site by Ghislain Deschêsnes P. Geo. on 
December 6 to 9, 2005 for the preparation of the previous technical report. The sampling and 
security procedures inspected by Ghislain Deschêsnes were found to be adequate. 
 

3. The resources reported in this document are compliant with current standards as outlined in the 
National Instrument 43-101. This study was completed at the resources estimation stage for the 
Barry I gold deposit. It includes the gold mineralization of the Main zone and zones 43 and 45. 
  

4. The Barry property is located 100 km east of Lebel-sur-Quevillon. The Barry I property is easily 
accessible via paved and all year round gravel roads. 
 

5. The Barry I Main Zone Area is located along the Murgor Shear Zone. All the rocks of the Barry 
project property are metamorphosed to the greenschist facies. Three distinct rock units are 
present on the property: 
 

a) Unaltered mafic metavolcanic rocks (massive and pillowed). 
b) Altered mafic metavolcanic rocks (Fe-carbonate with quartz and albite veining with 

2-5% pyrite).  
c) Quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes and plugs. 

 
6. Gold-bearing mineralization lies in pyritized and moderately altered volcanic flows near contacts 

with quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes and plugs. Alteration mineralogy includes albite, carbonate, 
biotite, ankerite, epidote, chlorite, sericite and garnet. Those minerals are distributed in a board 
halo of chlorite-sericite-calcite-magnetite crosscut by a magnetite destructive proximal halo of 
biotite-ankerite-albite and pyrite. Mineralization is characterized by a system of east-northeast and 
north-northeast sheeted quartz-carbonate veins dipping at 40-60 degrees to the south-southeast 
and the east-southeast respectively. The known mineralization is up to 500 metres long, up to 
150 metres wide and tested, for the majority of the drill holes, to a vertical depth of 50 metres. 
Only 20 holes reached a vertical depth greater than 100 metres in the Main Zone Area (Main 
Zone, zones 43 and 45).

7. The Barry I gold mineralized envelopes are located south of a major shear and fold zone. The 

mineralized envelopes represent sub-horizontal elongated dome shapes even if the mineralized 
veins are dipping moderately. The mineralized envelopes show variable thicknesses, which vary 
from a few centimetres to more than 30 metres. The actual mineralized envelopes of the Main 
Zone Area occur mainly in the first 30 metres of rock below surface. The gold grades vary within 
the envelopes and visible gold is frequently observed in the core. 

 
8. Exploration work, including extensive drilling, was performed during several phases and over 

several years, from 1983 to 2007. Some 78 drill holes were completed on the property in the 
second half of 2004 and the beginning of 2005 by Osisko. A total of 61 of these drill holes were 
drilled on the Barry I Main Zone Area and the remaining 17 tested additional exploration targets 
on the Barry property. Six drill holes were drilled at the end of 2005 and 32 in the beginning of 
2006 by Murgor. Three major trenches and a broad stripped zone are present on the Main Zone.  
58 new holes have been drilled in 2006-2007. 

 
9. Ghislain Deschênes, professional geologist and qualified person assigned to the study, visited the 

site of the Barry property in December 2005, during the drilling campaign realized by Murgor in 
2005. Geostat declares that the assay verification program confirms the gold values present in the 
database and that no statistical bias was observed. 

 
10. The 2006-2007 drilling campaign permitted to link the mineralization from the zones 43 and 45 

to the Main and found a new zone at the southeast of the Main Zone. 
 

11. The staff of Murgor and Geostat carried out the geological interpretation of the gold-bearing 
envelopes. The gold-bearing intersections were defined in accordance with this interpretation. A 
set of composites of regular length of 1.5-metres was created in order to assess the continuity of 
the gold mineralization, define interpolation parameters and carry out the interpolation of the 
grades for the resource calculation.  

 
12. The resources of the Barry I Main Zone Area (Main Zone, Zones 43 and 45) gold deposit were 

estimated by inverse distance composites of 1.5 metres length. A measured specific gravity of 2.8 
g/cm3 is used in this study for all rock types. 

 
13. Even if the majority of the drill holes collars of the Main Zone Area still visible on the site and 

were surveyed, the absence of a detailed survey of the topographic surface in the considered area, 
the incertitude regarding the position of the hole collars not surveyed and the difficulty to get a 
good anisotropic variogram cause by the short distance of influence of the samples do not allow 
us to declare measured resources at this stage. The topographic surface is acting as a 
mineralization contact boundary. The parameters used to define the indicated and inferred 
categories are the distance and the number of composites and are the following: 

 
Category Search ellipse 

(oriented according to 
the lenses, 90ºx0ºx40º) 

Minimum

14. Different cut-offs grades of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 g/t Au were used for the resource calculation in 
various scenarios.

1- Introduction and terms of reference (Item 4) 
 
This technical report describes the basis and methodology used for modelling the Barry I Main 
Zone. The report is an update of the report written in March of 2006.  This report presents the full 
review of the history and geology of the 2006 report, other resource evaluations of the Barry 
property and provides recommendations for future works. The Barry resource estimate presented 
here incorporates a modified geological interpretation of the Barry I Main Zone Area gold deposit 
and an extension of the mineralized zones both in length and in depth. Metanor owns a 100% 
interest in the Barry I Main Zone Area. 
 
Geostat was hired to update the estimation of the resources of the Barry I Main Zone, exclusive 
mining right of Metanor Resources Inc. (Metanor) on the SDBJ claims. Metanor provided the 
necessary data for this study in an electronic format. Ghislain Deschêsnes, the author of the 2006 
report visited the site from December 6 to December 9 2005 for the preparation of the previous 
technical report. At the time of this visit, some core from previous campaigns and core drilled in 
2005 were examined and samples were taken for validation directly from the core boxes stored on 
the site of the project. The drilling sites were visited and the sampling procedure inspected. As snow 
covered the exposed area, it was not possible to verify the surface mineralization of the property.

4- Accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructures and 
physiography (Item 7). 

This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 

4.1 Accessibility 
 
The Barry I Main Zone Area project is easily accessible by the provincial paved highway 113, a 
major regional road linking the town of Senneterre to Chapais, and by a 120 km all-weather gravel 
road linking the property to the town of Lebel-sur-Quevillon. Many forest roads give access to the 
different sectors of the property. 
 
The topography is generally flat; the bedrock is covered by a relatively thin layer of till, and, in the 
majority of the surface property, by fir trees and black spruces. The thickness of the overburden 
varies between zero in the area already stripped to 30 metres. Only a few natural outcrops are 
present on the property.  
 

4.2 Climate 
 
The climatologic data used to characterize the sector under study comes from the meteorological 
station of Chapais, Québec. These observations were carried out during 1961-1990. 
 

4.2.1 Precipitation 
 
On average 919 mm of water falls annually in the area. The most abundant precipitation falls in 
September, with 120 mm of water. Average monthly precipitation ranges from 40 mm in February 
to 120 mm in September. 
 
It is in June, however, that the strongest precipitation, for one 24-hours period, was registered with 
101 mm of water. Snow falls from October to April, but is much more significant from November 
to March. The average for these five months is 23 mm, expressed in mm of water. 
 
The pH of the precipitation measured at the Joutel station in 1991 varies from 4.30 in November to 
4.78 in June (MEF, 1993). 
 

4.2.2 Temperature 
 
In the area of Chapais, the average daily temperature is slightly over the freezing point, i.e. 0.5°C. 
The average temperature during July reaches 16°C, while the temperature in January falls to -17°C.  
 

4.2.3 Winds 
 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 9 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

The anemometric data collected in Val d'Or between 1952 and 1980 show that from June to January 
the southwest winds are dominant, whereas from February to May the winds coming from the 
northwest are more frequent. Furthermore, in this sector, the winds have an average velocity varying 
between 11 and 14 km/h for an average of 13 km/h during the year. 
 

4.3 Local resources 
 
The regional resources concerning labour force, supplies and equipment are sufficient, the area 
being well served by geological and mining service firms. The closest town, Lebel-sur-Quevillon 
provides the workforce for minor services and the town of Val d'Or and Chibougamau for the 
possible mine exploitation. 
 
A camp on the property, built in 1996 by Murgor Resources Inc., provides living facilities for a small 
group and core logging and splitting facilities, as for storage. All major services are available in Val 
d'Or, Chibougamau, and minor ones in Lebel-sur-Quevillon.  
 

4.4 Infrastructures 
 
The access road, the camp and the stripping of the overburden were realised by Murgor between 
1995 and 2005 on Barry and are all kept in good condition. Installations with catering and sleeping 
facilities can accommodate up to six workers during a stay at the site.  
 
It is also important to mention the availability of sand and gravel from an esker crossing the Barry I 
property, if additional material is required. 
 
A major hydroelectric power line crosses the eastern part of the property. 
 
The Quebec government has encouraged, in the past, natural resources development through the 
granting of permits, title security and financial incentives. Politically, the province and the county of 
the Municipalité de la Baie James are supportive of mining activities. 
 

4.5 Physiography 
 
The overburden depth on the Murgor property is variable, ranging from zero metre to 5 metres 
thick in the area of the "Main Showing Zone" to over 30 metres in other areas of the property. It is 
often made up of gravel, large boulders and till. 
 
Topographic relief is weak to moderate, locally up to 50 metres in the northwest part of the property 
due to outcrop ridges and eskers trending in a NE-SW direction. The southeast part of the property 
is of very low relief and is poorly drained. Fir trees and black spruces characterize the vegetation in 
the well-drained part of the property. The more poorly drained parts to the south are covered with 
spruce, balsam and Labrador-tea.  
 
The site of the Barry I Main Zone Area project presents low relief topography. Primarily black 
spruce forests, swamps, eskers and small lakes cover the property area. The vertical relief in the area 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 10 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

is very low with a mean altitude of 400 metres above sea level. Very few outcrops occur on the 
property.

Figure 5: View looking east-northeast of the topography and the typical vegetation of the 
Barry I Main Zone Area property. 

 

Most of the overburden covering the Barry I Main Zone central area has been removed and is 
stored on the property. The remaining overburden in the Barry I Main Zone Area shows a thickness 
smaller than 5 metres, according to the present drilling information. 
 
There is plenty of room for potential waste rock and tailing storage to the northwest of the actual 
deposit. A processing plant could be built on the property or a stockpile pad close of the actual 
access road.

5.2 Details of previous work on Barry 
 
The area surrounding the Murgor property was first mapped in the 1940's, but it was not until 1962 
that exploration work on the property was first recorded. Exploration in the area has progressed 
significantly in the last 10 years due to the increased access provided by the expanding network of 
logging roads. 

5.2.1 Work by Fab Metals Mines in 1962-1964 

 
Seven shallow drill holes (458 m) were drilled outside of the "Main Showing" area. In 1962, Fab 
Metal Mines, owned by Fred A. Boylen, drilled three short holes totalling 87 metres on the eastern 
shore of the Macho River. Basalts and feldspar porphyry were intersected, which contained sparse 
pyrite mineralization and the odd quartz veins. These holes were drilled outside of the "Main 
Showing" area. 
 
In 1964, Boylen drilled two additional short holes totalling 37 metres on a zone of strong quartz 
veining on the west shore of the Macho River. Boylen's drill logs referred to sheared volcanics with 
quartz tourmaline veins and visible gold. No follow-up work has been done to date on that area.  
 

5.2.2 Work done by Questor Suveys Ltd in 1981-1984 

 
In 1981 and 1984, Questor Surveys Ltd. completed an airborne EM-INPUT and magnetometer 
survey over the area for the Quebec Ministry of Energy and Resources. This survey (DP 83-08 and 
DP 85-19A and B) identified several EM anomalies on the Murgor property associated with a strong 
magnetic conductor.  
 

5.2.3 Work done by SDBJ in 1982-1984 

 
The discovery of the "Main Showing" dates back to 1982 when grab samples taken by SDBJ assayed 
up to 35 g/t Au. Between 1982 and 1983, SDBJ completed prospecting, line cutting, geological 
mapping, magnetometer and horizontal loop EM surveys. Three diamond drill holes (83-9, 83-10 
and 83-11) totalling 264.5 metres were drilled in the area of the "Main Zone" to test geophysical 
targets. All the drill holes intersected anomalous gold mineralization, with drill hole 83-9 assaying 
4.l g/t over 1.4 metres.  
 

5.2.4 Work done by Mines Camchib in 1983 

 
In 1983, Mines Camchib completed one hole of 146 metres (MB-83-1 1) at the western edge of the 
property. No significant assays were reported.  



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 14 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

5.2.5 Work done by Cominco-Agnico Eagle in 1989-89 

 
In 1988-89, a Cominco-Agnico Eagle joint venture completed magnetic, EM, IP and soil 
geochemical surveys along with overburden trenching. Nine diamond drill holes (LON-88-l, -2, -3 & 
LON-89-4, -5, -6, -7, -8 and -9), totalling 1,461 metres, were drilled on the property. The best assay 
was from drill hole LON-88-3 with an assay of 6.45 g/t over 1.8 metres.  
 

5.2.6 Work done by Murgor resources in 1994 

 
In November of 1994, Murgor optioned the SDBJ claim block as well as the Duval and Boudreault 
claim blocks. The property was surveyed with magnetic, IP and basal till surveys along with an 
extensive overburden stripping and channel-sampling program. Diamond drilling completed by 
Murgor concentrated on the Barry I Main Zone Area and totalled 56 holes (MB-1 to 56) for 
5,918 metres. The Barry I Main Zone Area had been drilled over a strike length of 800 metres and 
down to a vertical depth of 250 metres. Multiple gold bearing zones were identified with 
intersections as high as 9.7 g/t Au over 7.7 metres. A mineral inventory was calculated on the 
Barry I Main by Murgor, which totalled 610,000 mt grading 6.8 g/t Au (Tessier, 1996).  
 

5.2.7 Work done by Murgor in 1995 

 
A program of 18 drill holes was completed on the Barry I property between February 20 to April 2 
1995. A total of 1,785 metres of NQ core were drilled with 1,516 samples were assayed for gold.  
 
The drilling confirmed the presence of gold. A typical gold zone is composed of alternating sections 
of auriferous altered volcanics and unaltered volcanics.  
 
The drill results proved the mineralized zones to be very complicated, where it was impossible to tie 
together the mineralization on strike and on section. Some features, which may be localizing the 
gold mineralization, could be the folding, contacts, fractures, flexures or intersecting structures. 
 
The conclusions of these works are the following: 
 
1) The Barry I property is located within a major deformation zone created by overlapping strain 

aureoles related to the emplacement of two large plutons. The two large plutons flank the 
greenstone rocks to the northwest and southeast.  

 
2) The strike orientation of the gold associated deformation zone is 060º (east-northeast). Several 

gold showings in this area are also associated with this orientation. The dip of the units on the 
property is 60° south, whereas the plunge is 45° - 50° to the east.  

 
3) The gold mineralization is typical Archean lode gold style with auriferous quartz-carbonate-

albite veinlets hosted within highly carbonatized pillowed basalts and basaltic flows. The gold 
usually occurs as the native element or as inclusions within the pyrite. 

 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 15 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

4) Hydrothermal fluids have been deposited within fractures rather than shear zones. Very little 
shearing is evident.  

 
5) 90% of the veinlets have the same dip as the foliation, which is 060° to the south.  
 
6) Broad zones of Fe carbonate exist, zoned away from the veinlets. Biotite alteration also exists at 

the immediate contact with the volcanics and sometimes along fractures at right angles within 
the veinlets. The presence of biotite and the hornfelsic appearance of the volcanics locally 
suggest a very high temperature deposition of the fluids. 

 
7) Some drill holes did not encounter the expected gold mineralization, as the result of previous 

surface works, suggesting a possible plunge of the main showing. 
 
8) The same style of veinlets and sulphides observed in the quartz feldspar porphyries did not 

carry gold mineralization even though they did in the volcanics. This suggested that the QFP 
was not chemically correct to allow for gold precipitation. 

 
9) The showing corresponds to a coincident MAG high and IP anomaly.  
 
10) The greater the vein frequency, the stronger the alteration, the higher the percentage of pyrite 

and therefore the higher the gold assays.  
 
11) The veinlets are bulged suggesting a stretching deformation, while the pillows are flattened 

suggesting a compression deformation. 
 

5.3.8 Work done by Teck option during 1997 

 
A total of 4,456 metres of diamond drilling in 15 drill holes were completed on the Murgor property 
between June and August of 1997. This drilling tested the extensions of the auriferous Barry I Main 
Zone and parallel or faulted off structures to the north.  
 
Drilling  
 
Teck had the holes MB-57 to 62 and MB-68 to 71 on the property. These holes tested the extension 
of the gold mineralization hosted in the Barry I Main Zone, along a strike of 800 metres and down 
to a vertical depth of 325 metres below surface. The gold mineralization was intersected in 
mineralized corridors in a variety of stratigraphic units. The most significant areas in order of 
importance include:  
 
1. Altered basalts at the hanging wall contact of the quartz-feldspar-porphyry. 
2. Basalts at the footwall contact of the quartz-feldspar-porphyry. 
3. Basalt-gabbro to the north of the quartz-feldspar porphyry. 
4. Quartz-feldspar porphyry. 
5. Massive basalt unit to the south of the quartz-feldspar porphyry. 
6. Brecciated basalt unit. 
 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 16 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

The best gold intersections were from the altered basalts located to the south of the hanging wall 
contact of the main quartz-feldspar-porphyry sill. The altered and mineralized basalts were 
intersected over thicknesses of up to 85 metres and contained several gold bearing zones. The best 
intersection assayed 6.38 g/t Au over 7.7 metres from hole MB-62. It is composed of several narrow 
higher-grade mineralized intervals with unaltered basalt located in-between. Other significant 
mineralized sections include 3.95 g/t Au over 5.0 metres and 3.39 g/t Au over 4.6 metres from 
holes MB-58 and MB-68 respectively. Although the major stratigraphic units in the area are 
continuous, the gold bearing sections are not as large and appear much more discontinuous. 
 
The location of the gold mineralization on the footwall side of the quartz-feldspar- porphyry is not 
as well defined as that found in the hanging wall due to the varying thickness of the quartz-feldspar-
porphyry unit. Best intersections include 8.48 g/t Au over 2.2 metres in drill hole MB-58 and 
6.47 g/t Au over 2.9 metres and from drill hole MB-70.  
 
Sections with anomalous gold mineralization were also identified in the quartz-feldspar porphyry 
unit, the brecciated basalt unit, the more massive basalt unit to the south of the quartz- feldspar-
porphyry and in the massive basalt-gabbro unit to the north of the quartz-feldspar- porphyry. Assay 
results for these zones were as high as 3.49 g/t Au over 1.8 metres. The gold mineralization in these 
corridors was commonly present as sheared and altered zones close to small quartz-feldspar-
porphyry sills. 
 
The diamond drilling did confirm that the mineralized system at the Barry I Main Zone Area is large, 
and the zone was intersected in virtually every hole. Although the mineralization remains open in all 
directions, the drilling shows that on a detailed scale the gold bearing zones are represented by 
numerous smaller lenses. Based on previous surface stripping and closed spaced shallow drilling the 
size of individual mineralized lenses may only be in the order of 45 metres in strike.  
 
The diamond drill holes MB-63 to 67 targeted a chargeability anomaly and associated magnetic high 
parallel and to the north of the Barry I Main Zone. The only significant assay from this shallow 
diamond drilling was from hole MB-64, which assayed 1.73 g/t Au over a core length of 1.6 metres. 
The gold mineralization encountered in this area is similar in style to that encountered at the Barry I 
Main Zone, and is associated with biotite-carbonate alteration, quartz-carbonate veining and 
disseminated pyrite. The assay quoted above in drill hole MB-64 is from the contact of a small 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry unit.  
 
Surface Mapping and Sampling  
 
A program of surface mapping and outcrop sampling was completed on the property concurrently 
with the diamond-drilling program in the summer of 1997. A total of 52 samples were analyzed for 
gold, of these, 27 samples were also analyzed for major and minor elements. The highest gold assay 
from a surface grab sample outside of the Barry I Main Zone Area was 2.01 g/t Au. This sample was 
taken from a small pit, located approximately 150 metres to the north of the Barry I Main Zone, 
which corresponds to the northern IP conductor drill tested with holes MB-63 to 67. The IP 
anomalies are due to the presence of disseminated pyrite and local stringers of magnetite.  
 
A significant amount of quartz veining with rare pyrite mineralization was located in outcrops close 
to IP chargeability anomalies in the northern part of the property at L23+85E, l2+75N and in the 
eastern part of the property at L4l+85E, 7+105. The quartz veins in the northern part of the 
property on L23+85E were also found to contain up to 5% of a mineral identified as geikielite

(MgTiO3), which has been found to be locally associated with gold mineralization in the Val d'Or 
mining camp.  
 
Geophysical IP survey  
 
A dipole-dipole array IP survey with a totalling 53 km covered portions of the property not covered 
by previous surveys was realized. Several moderate to strong chargeability anomalies were outlined 
in the northern and eastern parts of the property.  
 
Two of the 12 anomalies defined by previous surveys correspond to the known sulphide 
mineralization; i.e. the Barry I Main Zone Area and the zone 150-200 metres to the north. These 
17 anomalies are characterized by strong chargeability, background resistivity signatures and are 
associated with magnetic highs. Both of these anomalies, each approximately 1,000 metres in length, 
appear to have been offset by an E-W trending structure with a sinistral movement. The 
chargeability highs are due to finely disseminated pyrite (3-7%) and lesser pyrrhotite and magnetite. 
 
Based on the recent IP survey, there exist up to six separate IP (chargeability) anomalies in the 
northern and eastern part of the Murgor property. Individual IP anomalies can be traced over strike 
lengths of up to 2,000 metres. All are untested by diamond drilling and no outcrops are present in 
the area of the anomalies. 
 
IP surveying has proven to be the most useful geophysical technique in the Urban-Barry Volcanic 
Belt. It works well in identifying and locating the disseminated style of the sulphide mineralization 
associated with the gold mineralization.  
 
Litho geochemistry results 
 
Systematic core sampling at 30 metres intervals, for 160 samples, was completed on all drill holes. 
The samples were analyzed for 10 major oxides, loss on ignition and a 32 elements package by ICP. 
Alteration trends were appraised through bulk chemistry methods designed to monitor relative 
enrichment-depletion patterns of mobile elements typical of gold deposits 
 
The basaltic rocks are of tholeiitic to transitional affinity as defined by immobile element plots. 
Three populations of chemically different rock units were identified from various X-Y plots using 
AL2O3, Ti02, and Zr concentrations. These included quartz-feldspar porphyry, basalts and 
plagioclase-phyric basalts or feldspar porphyries. No significant geochemical difference could be 
established amongst the various subunits of basalts and gabbros.  
 
Though the most significant gold intersections were hosted within the basalts, the quartz-feldspar-
porphyry unit commonly showed a higher background concentration of gold. Median gold levels in 
the basalts are 6 ppb while, in the quartz-feldspar-porphyry, the values were almost four times 
higher at 23 ppb. The mineralized zones within the basalts do not show any significantly large 
alteration halo identifiable by geochemical anomalous gold values or associated pathfinder elements. 
The gold mineralization is restricted to the quartz veins and their borders.

The conclusions on the work done by Teck option during 1997 are the following: 
 
The continuity and size of these individual higher-grade zones is difficult to establish and appears 
erratic. No significant increase in the gold grade was observed along strike or at depth. The 
mineralized corridors do however remain open in all directions.  
 
The Murgor property covers iron rich basalts intruded by quartz-feldspar porphyry, both of which 
are favourable hosts for gold mineralization. Mineralization at the Barry I Main consists mainly of 
sheeted auriferous quartz-carbonate-albite veins aligned parallel to the regional foliation at 060°. A 
second set of contemporaneous quartz-carbonate-albite veins is also present, oriented at 020° 
parallel to the Milner Shear Zone. This favourable geology and structural setting are interpreted to 
be present elsewhere on the property.  
 

5.3.9 Work done by Osisko option during 2004-2005 

 
A total of 61 drill holes, for 2,580 metres, were drilled mainly on the Barry I Main Zone Area by 
Osisko Resources Inc. during the June 2004 and February 2005 period. A partial survey of the drill 
holes collars was carried out during this period. Only the computerized version of the drill logs was 
available for this study. One database including all the computerized data on the Barry property was 
prepared and kept up to date. No other document prepared by Osisko was given to Murgor. 
 
The staff of Osisko did a new interpretation of the mineralized deposit according to the information 
retrieved from the new drill holes. Following their study of the gold potential for that deposit, they 
released their option to concentrate their efforts on another deposit of larger tonnage. The size of 
the Barry deposit does not fulfill their requirement for a large deposit to exploit. 
 
The release of their report on the Barry property is still pending. 
 

5.3.10 Work done by Murgor during 2005-2006 

 
Six drill holes for 225 metres were drilled mainly on the Barry I Main Zone by Murgor during 
December 2005. A new geological model interpretation was developed according to the new data 
and tested by three drill holes required by Geostat. These drill holes confirmed the presence of gold. 
The three others aimed to add tonnage to the Barry I Main and to test a high-grade target in the 
southwest part of the Barry I Main Zone. One database was created and verify by Geostat's staff. 
The position of the collars had to be surveyed. The data of five of the previously drill holes were not 
found. All the assays greater then 1 g/t Au were checked when the assay certificates were available. 
A new resource estimate was calculated from the new geological interpretation and aimed at define 
resources possibly mined by open-pit. They were estimated by inverse distance using a maximum of 
10 composites of 1.5 metres length. 
 
The results of the estimates of February 2006, according to different cut offs, are the following'

5.3.11 Work done by Murgor during 2006 

 
A second drilling campaign was executed in the first months of 2006. Some 32 drill holes for a total 
of 1,409 m were drilled on the Main Zone and tested the SW extension of the Main Zone Area and 
the Zone 43. A total of 1,279 samples were sent to the lab for gold assay. Twenty of these samples 
were for quality control. 
 
Murgor performed a survey of the casings still presents and visible over the snow cover on the Main 
Zone Area that permitted to update their collar coordinates. The position of the surveyed drill holes 
moved slightly as their three coordinates changed. All the previous estimates were based on 
measured coordinated according to the cut line pattern.

This new drilling campaign permitted to better define the extension of the mineralized zone inside 
the Main Zone Area and to verify the southwest and northwest extensions of the Main Zone. Some 
of the holes drilled tested the extension of the Zone 43 located southwest of the Main Zone. They 
intersected this zone to a depth up to 50 meters and the known southwest northeast extension is 
130 metres. 
 
A new interpretation of the mineralized zones and an update of the previously estimated resources 
were performed. The resource estimate aimed to define mineralization exploitable by open-pit 
mining. This new design included the mineralized zones from the Main Zone, the zones 43, 45 and 
the southwest extension of the Main Zone. 

5.3.12 Work done during 2006-2007 

 
A new drilling campaign was executed. Some 58 drill holes for a total of 5,076 m were drilled on the 
Main Zone and tested the east, north and south deeper extensions of the Main Zone Area and the 
Zone 43. A total of 4,988 samples were sent to the lab for gold assay.  
 
This new drilling campaign permitted to better define the extension of the mineralized zone inside 
the Main Zone Area and to verify the extensions of the Main Zone.

6- Geological setting (Item 9) 
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 

6.1 Regional geology 
 
The Barry property is located in the north segment of the Abitibi. It belongs to the Archean Abitibi 
Volcano-plutonic Sub-Province, part of the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield within the 
volcanogenic Harricana-Turgeon belt of the northwest part of the Sub-province of Abitibi. All rock 
types are of Archean age except the diabase dykes (Proterozoic). The Barry I property belongs to the 
metavolcanic metasedimentary belt, which extends from Wilson Lake to the Grenville Front. This 
sequence of rocks named the "Wilson-Marceau" is flanked to both the north and south by granitic 
massive intrusives. Greenschist-grade metamorphism is found throughout the region except in areas 
proximal to granitoid stocks where metamorphic grade is increased to amphibolite grade. 
 
The Barry property covers largely the Casa Berardi Tectonic Zone, which includes several corridors 
of ductile E-W and ESE-WNW deformations. In the Harricana-Turgeon Belt, one can find the 
mining camps of Joutel, Matagami, Brouillan and Casa Berardi, where polymetallic volcanogenic 
clusters deposits (Estrades and Isle-Dieu), polymetallic veins deposits (Selbaie) and lode gold 
deposits (Casa Berardi, Vezza, Douay West and Détour) were discovered. 
 
On a regional scale, the known mineralization of the Murgor property is hosted at the intersection of 
two major structures. These are the Murgor Shear Zone, a more intense portion of the 060° regional 
deformation, and the Mimer Shear, a 020° structure known to contain several small yet significant 
gold showings. Both of these larger scale structures associated with gold mineralization, are 
represented by quartz vein systems that can be seen in the Barry I Main Zone.  
 

6.1.1 Other deposits in the Barry I deposit area 
 
Murgor possess the Windfall property, located about 20 km northeast of the Barry I project. The 
mineralization found consists of a sericite-fuschite shear zone with 1-15% quartz-
carbonate±tourmaline veins. These veins contain from traces up to 5% pyrite and locally some VG. 
The shear is between 2 to 5 metres thick, is oriented N060º and dipping NNW at 60-70º. Murgor is 
presently working on that property by geophysics surveys and drilling campaign. The mineralization 
appears close to the surface. 
 
At least two other properties are close to Barry I present deposit and had resources evaluated. These 
deposits are not close to the surface and could be mined by underground operations. The published 
resources of these properties, which are not NI 430-101 compliant, are:

6.2 Local geology 
 

6.2.1 Stratigraphy  

 
The property is underlain by greenschist facies volcanic and intrusive rocks belonging to the Wilson-
Marceau Volcanic Belt (Hocq, 1989). These rocks are of tholeiitic affinity. As there is limited 
outcrop exposure, the geology had to be deduced from drill holes data and geophysics. Geological 
mapping and diamond drilling identified a series of basaltic flows that are interpreted to cover over 
90% of the property. The only intrusive bodies identified on the property were the quartz-feldspar 
porphyry in the area of the Barry I Main Zone Area and a series of gabbro sills to the north. An 
outcrop of siltstone was identified approximately 300 metres northeast of the Barry I Main Zone. 
Stratigraphic tops are to the southeast, as indicated by pillow facing directions. The rocks on the 
property are overprinted by a weak to moderate NE-SW trending foliation (S2) that parallels the 
regional shearing and the contacts of the large granitic intrusions.  
 
The mafic volcanic rocks are the most common rocks on the property and consist of dark green, 
fine-grained, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts. In order of decreasing abundance, these flows vary from 
massive, amygdaloidal, brecciated, feldspar-phyric to locally pillow. Alteration varies from a regional 
chlorite alteration to locally carbonate, sericite, epidote plus minor silicification, hematization, biotite 
and actinolite alteration (Tessier 1996, Lariviere 1997). All these rocks vary from generally non-
magnetic to locally strongly magnetic with up to 5% disseminated magnetite crystals and less 
commonly stringers of magnetite. 
 
The mafic volcanic rocks in the area of the Barry I Main Zone Area are intruded by a series of 
porphyritic to granitic felsic dykes or sills. They are grey to pink in colour and contain up to 50% 
white feldspars, 15% blue quartz and 10% biotite phenocrysts ranging in size from two to l0 mm. 
The quartz-feldspar porphyry varies in colour from a fresh looking medium grey, to a reddish tint 

Barry I

(due to hematization), to a bleached light grey (due to strong silicification). The quartz-feldspar- 
porphyry is "sill like", maintaining a general stratigraphic position within the volcanic pile, while, at 
the same time, it can be seen crosscutting the volcanic stratigraphy on surface. The thickness of this 
unit varies from several metres to over 125 metres. 
 
One can observe two sets of porphyritic to granitic felsic dykes or sills. The first set is foliated and 
shows 35% of feldspars and less than 5% of blue quartz-eyes. The second set of quartz-feldspar 
porphyry is not foliated and contains 8-12% of blue quartz-eyes and 50% of feldspars. 
 
The gabbro is massive, medium to coarse-gained with a dark green colour. At times, the gabbro 
develops a finer gained gradational contact with the basalts and varies from moderately to non-
magnetic. Drilling indicates that the gabbro is sill like and up to 20 metres thick.  
 

6.2.2 Structure 

 
The overburden had been removed in 1995 over most of the Barry I Main Zone Area. The bedrock 
had been mapped in 1995 and the maps help to understand the structure of the mineralized zones. 
The major aspects of the structure observed on the Barry I Main Zone Area can be summarised as 
follow: 
 

• The impact of the major fault present at the northwest of the property, the Murgor Shear 
Zone, seems not very important, at least laterally. 

• The displacement of one fault, mapped in 1995, occurring in the northwest part of the 
stripped zone, seems to be less than 100 metres laterally. The vertical movement is 
unknown. 

• Occurrences of mapped folded zones suggest the presence of two major anticlines and one 
syncline. The orientation of the fold axes is southwest northeast. The plunges are variables, 
but generally sub-horizontal. 

• Many deformational features are brittles (faults, fractures, veinlets, intrusives) to brittle-
ductile (shear zones) and others are from the deformation of the ductile mafic formations 
(pillows deformation and boudinage). 

• According to the interpretation from the 2006 drill holes, the limb of the southeast anticline 
extends deeper to the southeast to form the Zone 43. Some drill holes intersected the 
Zone 43. 

• The Zone 43 can be interpreted as one side of a syncline, repeating the SW-NE undulating 
fold pattern. 

• Minor north south faults, with displacement smaller than 10 metres, are developed on the 
mapped area. 

• The main schistosity is 060°, dipping steeply to the southeast.

7- Deposit type (Item 10) 
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 
The Barry I Main Zone Area deposit is structurally complex. Its genesis seems to be from 
hydrothermal origin, with strong structural and chemical controls. The information acquired from 
the holes drilled between 2004 and 2006 offers a new perspective and a better understanding of the 
Barry I Main Zone Area mineralization and the Zones 43 and 45. It becomes obvious that the 
presence of gold-bearing mineralization is not only possible in the limbs of the fold, as previously 
taught, but also at the top of the fold. 
 
The next figures present the spatial organization of the mineralization, which we can find in the 
Barry I Main Zone Area and Zone 43 and 45. The sections are section 995 E and 1111 E.

The Barry I Main Zone Area is composed of steep southeast dipping (60°) quartz-carbonates, biotite 
and ankerite veins. The ankerite alteration extends outside the quartz veinlets. This alteration halo is 
very proximal and may extend for up to 30 cm on either side of the narrow 1 to 5 cm quartz 
carbonates veinlets. Where there is a high frequency of veins, the alteration veins merge, producing 
alteration zones of over 20 metres in thickness in certain areas. The biotite and ankerite quartz 
carbonates veinlets extend in depth, as they can be followed in the deepest drill holes. Their gold 
contain is variable. 
 
The Main Zone Area gold mineralized envelopes are located almost flat lying at the top of a dome 
shaped fold. The vertical thickness of the gold bearing envelopes varies between one up to 
20 metres. Their length is variable because they are pinching and swelling. The southwest northeast 
extension (up to 300 metres) of the envelopes zone is more important than the southeast northwest 
extension (60 to 85 metres). The first top 35 metres of rock contains most of the continuous gold 
mineralized envelopes. One small extension toward the southeast of the main zone, along the side of 
the anticline and in the top of the anticline, is defined by drilling in the southwest part of the main 
zone, further southwest of the quartz-porphyry intrusion. 
 
The dome shaped design of the mineralized zone seems to repeat itself in the northwest part of the 
Main Zone. A new interpretation of the mapped stratigraphy suggests the presence of another 
anticline in the northwest part of the exposed rock of the Main Zone Area (Figure 16). 
 
The Zone 43, identified by drilling, is located on the southeast limb of the Main Zone Area anticline, 
higher in the stratigraphy than the main zone. Six drill holes were drilled in 2005-2006 to better 
understand and explore this zone. The northeast part of the Zone 43, located south of the Main 
Zone, seems to be cut or displaced by a quartz-porphyry intrusion located just at the southeast of 
the Main Zone. The type of mineralization needs to be study. 
 
The Zone 45 is the possible extension of the Main Zone, to the southeast. The zone is present on 
the sections 700 and 750. It is possible to join this zone with the Main Zone at depth. The zone is 
possibly open to the east. The collars of the 107, 120 and 156 need to be surveyed to assure their 
local position on the section 800E 
 
The presumed sequence leading to the presence of gold mineralization is the following: 
 

• Lavas deposition 
• First alteration period– silicification and set-up of the first sequence of quartz-carbonate-

fuschite veins. The gold was distributed within the quartz veins and in the host rocks. The 
gold is present in disseminated and in nugget form. The nuggets can reach up to 1 mm. 

• Intrusion, after the alteration period, of the quartz-porphyry complexes. 
• Shear period, set-up of the presently visible foliation. 
• Second alteration period – Silicification and set-up of the second set of milky quartz veins, 

none neither folded nor sheared. 
 
The next figure presents a typical cross-section of the Barry I Main Zone.

8- Mineralization (Item 11) 
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 

8.1 The Barry I Main Zone Area type mineralization 
 
Gold mineralization on the property occurs for the most part in a system of sheeted quartz-
carbonate (ankerite) - albite veins, veinlets in the associated proximal alteration halos of biotite-
carbonate and disseminated pyrite. The gold occurs as free gold in gangue minerals within veins and 
altered wall rocks, as well as along micro fractures in pyrite (Lariviere, 1997).  
 

8.1.1 Quartz Veining 

 
From the mapping of the showing, one can observe that the main quartz veins system, which 
accounts for approximately 90% of the gold bearing veins, consist of sheeted veins. The dominant 
veins are oriented at 040° to 060°, parallel to the region foliation, and dip 62° to the SE (Tessier, 
1996). The veins are surprisingly continuous for their thickness, which generally does not exceed 
5 cm, yet at times, they extend for over 50 metres along strike. They are not folded. Their sulphides 
contain is low and they seems to appear lately in the sequence.  
 
The second set of quartz veins is less developed, oriented at 020° on the showing and at an angle to 
the drill core very variable, and is parallel to the Milner Shear and dip 73° to the east. These veins 
can be distinguished by their well-developed crenulations, or folding, bulging and is continuous over 
several metres at best. One can find the association quartz-carbonates-(ankerite)-fuschite in these 
folded veins. They show a brownish color and contain a variable amount of pyrite. They are found 
at the contact of the alteration zones and are possibly concordant with the schistosity. 
 
Although both sets of quartz veins crosscut each other and are composed of the same sugary quartz-
ankerite-albite mixture, they suggest an asynchronous time of injection. They are post depositional 
but some are anterior to the folding and the others posterior. Their gold mineralization seems to 
come from the remobilization of the gold during the folding period. 
 

8.1.2 Alteration 

 Alteration mineralogy includes.  
The alteration of the basalts most commonly associated with the gold mineralization on the property 
consists of a very fine mixture of albite, carbonate, biotite, ankerite, epidote, chlorite, sericite and 
garnet. This alteration halo is very proximal and may extend for up to 30 cm on either side of the 
narrow 1 to 5 cm quartz veins. Where there is a high frequency of veins, the alteration veins 
amalgamate together producing alteration zones of over 20 metres in thickness. In fresh core 
samples, the alteration may be distinguished by its darker grey colour due to the biotite, in contrast 
to the green more chloritic, non-mineralized sections. On surface, the oxidization of iron in the 
ankerite produces a very noticeable rusty brown colour.  
 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 30 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

A less common form of proximal alteration, often associated with the better gold mineralization, is 
an intense bleaching due to albitization and a local reddish colour produced due to hematization. 
 
A larger, broader alteration package that generally encompasses the mineralized basalts is 
characterized by the presence of chlorite-sericite-calcite-magnetite crosscut by a magnetite 
destructive proximal halo of biotite-ankerite-albite and pyrite. This alteration, locally referred to as 
"texture destructive alteration", may be as much as 80 metres thick and is commonly found close to 
the quartz-feldspar-porphyry basalt contact (Tessier, 1996).  
 
The alteration associated with gold mineralization in the quartz-feldspar-porphyry unit is generally a 
strong bleaching and texture destructive alteration caused by silicification. This alteration is most 
commonly found within the quartz-feldspar-porphyry at the contact with the basalts.  
 

8.1.3 Sulphides  
 
Sulphide mineralization is mainly pyrite, which can account for 3 to 5% of the rock, but can be as 
high as 10%. It is commonly finely disseminated in the host rock as sulphide haloes to the quartz 
veins. Locally coarse cubic pyrite, up to 10 mm in size, is present. Both the fine and coarse pyrite are 
found associated with visible gold. Pyrrhotite is also present, although less common than pyrite, it 
varies from one to 5%. Chalcopyrite and sphalerite have also been identified but are not common. 
 

8.1.4 Gold mineralization 

 
The gold mineralization on the property is closely related to the amount of veining, intensity of 
alteration and percentage of sulphides. All are key factors and generally all three of these elements 
are needed in order to obtain significant gold mineralization. This style of mineralization produces 
sections with significant gold concentrations but they are commonly narrow with widths in the order 
of 0.3 to 1.5 metres. The thicker mineralized sections represent a higher density of these narrow 
zones.  
 
The presence of the gold mineralization located at the top of the dome shaped is associated with 
silicified volcanites. At depth greater than 30 metres, the volcanic rocks are more mafic, massive and 
show the presence of vacuoles. 
 
The majority of the mineralized sections are located within the silicified-carbonated basalts close to 
the contacts with the quartz-feldspar-porphyry. It is thought that the emplacement of the quartz- 
feldspar-porphyry is significant in the ground preparation. The emplacement of the porphyry body is 
thought to have increased the fracture-induced permeability of the basalts and created the conducts 
necessary for gold bearing hydrothermal fluids to circulate (Lariviere, 1997). The motor of the 
leaching process can be the intrusion of the first sequence of quartz-feldspar-porphyry. The 
hydrothermal fluids leached surrounding carbonated rocks and created carbon-based acid that had 
dissolved their gold contain. As the oxide-reduction potential of the environment changed, the 
carbonated-gold rich solution precipitated in the fracture zone presents at the top of the dome-
shaped folds. The mineralized quartz-carbonate-albite veins, when extending from the basalts into 
the quartz-feldspar-porphyry, rarely contain any significant gold mineralization.

The folding periods having happened after the intrusion of the first porphyry body might have 
remobilized the gold mineralisation in the fold noses.

8.2 Other mineralized zones on the property 
 
The following is a brief description of the different mineralized zones on the Barry I property. 
Geostat did not recalculate the resources of these other mineralized zones  
 
Numerous other gold showings are present on the Barry I property. These principal zones are the 
SW extension, the zones 45 and 48. These zones were defined by geophysics and tested by diamond 
drill holes. The core shows interesting mineralized intersections and they need further drilling. The 
zone 51 was interpreted by geophysics and need to be drilled. 
 
The best intersection is located on the section 700 E in the Zone 45. The grade is 9.7 g/t Au over 
7.7 metres. This intersection can be connected with two holes present on the section 750E. 
 
More than 50 different gold occurrences are widespread over a surface of 1,000 x 350 metres, with 
many porphyry dykes intersecting the volcanics on the property. 
 
The next two figures present a schematic view of the Barry I Main Zone Area and a cross section of 
the mineralized zones.

9- Exploration work (Item 12) 
This item was taken and updated from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. 
Geo. from Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 
Exploration history of the property is directly linked to the history of the discovery and 
development of the Barry I property and other mineralized zones previously discussed in this report. 
 

9.1 Geophysics 
 
A large part of the Barry I property was surveyed by induced polarization and MAG ground surveys. 
Murgor still explore the property using geophysics methods. The mineralized zones on the Barry I 
property responded very well to geophysics. 
 
The next two figures show the compilation maps of the geophysical anomalies detected on the 
Barry I property.

9.2 Survey  
 
Several exploration campaigns have taken place on the Barry I property since its discovery. Three 
survey campaigns were performed since the beginning of the exploration works. Some of the holes 
were surveyed in 1996 according to the mine grid. In October 2004, a professional surveyor 
surveyed the position of most of the collars of the drill holes in the stripped area of the Barry I Main 
Zone Area according to the UTM Nad83 Zone 18 grid. In regards to the holes drilled in 2005-2006, 
the position of the remaining collars of the precedent campaign, including the latest holes drilled had 
been survey by the same professional surveyor as for the 2004 campaign. Some of the remaining 
drill holes, further away from the Main Zone drilling area, have also been surveyed. 
 

9.2.1 Grids used on the property  
 
One local grid system, in metres, is used on the property. All the surveys and other information are 
related or transferred to that grid system. The MTM and UTM NAD 83 coordinate systems are also 
used for survey, exploration and reporting purposes. The drill holes database includes MTM and 
local grids for the holes surveyed in 2004 and 2006 and only the local grid for the others. 
 
As the relative data from the 2006 survey in UTM coordinates and the values already loaded in the 
database does not correspond, the coordinates of the holes had been corrected according to the 
surveyed coordinate instead of the measured one. The common point chosen to link the local grid 
to the UTM grid is the collar of the hole MB95-05. The coordinates of all the drill holes surveyed 
according to the UTM grid were transferred to the local grid according to the common point. This 
modification of the drill holes coordinates changed slightly the position of some drill holes 
according to the others. The easting, the northing and the elevation of all the drill holes changed 
slightly. There was no major errors in the tape measured coordinates in regard of the surveyed 
coordinated. The March 2006 interpretation was done according the surveyed coordinates 
transferred in the local grid. 
 
The estimation of the resources is relative to local grid. The north of the local grid is oriented 
N330°. The next figure shows the position of the local grid over the claims position. 
 
Recent verification of the database shows an estimated convertion from the mining coordinates to 
UTMs of: 
Rotation: -28.8512936227465º 
Translation: 
X: +442886.77 m 
Y: +5426103.98 m 
Z: -1604.92 m

10- Drilling, mapping and trenches (Item 13) 
 
Metanor possess a voluminous drill holes database for the Barry property. A total of 427 drill holes 
and for 26,380 metres, have been drilled on the property and the information loaded in the database. 
The information regarding old five drill holes is not found. All these holes were drilled over several 
years, from 1962 up to 2006. During 1995, a total of 1,203 metres of channels samples had been 
collected and sent for gold assay.

An important quantity of core is stored on the project site. Some of the drill holes core intersecting 
the most interesting mineralized intercepts has been removed from the core boxes over the years by 
Murgor and various partners.  
 
The Barry I mineralized body has been interpreted using North 330° cross-sections of different 
spacing from the coordinate 650 E to 1,275 E. 
 

10.1 Trenches and mapping of the Barry I project by Murgor 
 
Given the thickness of the overburden and the few outcrops, there are only trenches in the Barry I 
Main Zone area.  
 
Murgor had stripped the overburden over the Barry I Main Zone Area in 1995. All the stripped 
areas were mapped and channel sampled. It is important to note that the channel samples are not 
used in this estimation of the property resources. They could have been used if surveyed in 3D to 
follow the topography. 
 
The detailed hard copy on the mapping is not available in electronic format. A scan on the simplified 
copy of the mapping is presented in Appendix.  
 

10.2 Recent drilling and evaluation of the Barry project by Murgor 
 
A new drilling campaign was executed. Some 58 drill holes for a total of 5,076 m were drilled on the 
Main Zone and tested the east, north and south deeper extensions of the Main Zone Area and the 
Zone 43. A total of 4,988 samples were sent to the lab for gold assay.  
 
This new drilling campaign permitted to better define the extension of the mineralized zone inside 
the Main Zone Area and to verify the extensions of the Main Zone. 
 
A new interpretation of the mineralized zones and an update of the previously estimated resources 
were performed. The resource estimate aimed to define mineralization exploitable by open-pit 
mining. This new design included the mineralized zones from the Main Zone, the zones 43, 45 and 
the southwest extension of the Main Zone. 
 
The mineralization possibly exploitable by open-pit was not altered by this new drilling. 
 
The next table shows the parameters of the 58 holes drilled in 2006-2007 by Murgor on the Barry I 
Main Zone area

11- Sampling methodology (Item 14) 
 
We do not have much information on the detailed methodology of sampling used before the 
exploration work on the property by Murgor in 2005. All we can state is that half core samples were 
sawed and then sent to an analytical laboratory to assay the gold content.  

11.1 Assay validation of the results from Osisko 2004 campaign 
 
Osisko Exploration Inc. drilled 61 holes on the property in 2004-2005. Most but not all the drill core 
of the mineralized zones were sawed and sent to the laboratory. They sent 2,001 core samples to the 
laboratory for gold assay. Some 55 standards were sent to the laboratory for quality control. A total 
of 2.7% of all the samples sent to the laboratory were for quality control. 
 
A total of 195 samples from the holes 101 to 108 were assayed by Osisko by the metallic sieve 
method and Au 50g-FA-AA and Au 50g-FA-GRAV.

Murgor initiated a quality control and assurance protocol for its gold exploration programs on the 
Barry I deposit for the samples of the drilling campaign in 2006, This procedure includes the 
systematic addition of a certified standard to approximately every holes drilled. Twenty 20 standards 
samples were sent for gold analysis at commercial certified laboratories. 
 
The next table shows the correlation between the standards values and laboratory results.

If we consider the values greater than 2 g/t Au, the maximum difference between the standard value 
and the assayed value is 0.19 g/t Au for a standard of 2.77 g/t Au ± 0.05 g/t Au. The results show 
that the error is less than 6% on the gold value. The average error is positive, with an augmentation 
of the gold contains of 0.02 g/t Au, for an average error of 2.65%. Geostat considers these values 
within the average for that type of metal determination.  
 
Samples coming from half cut NQ cores and lengths up to one metre are sent for analysis to ALS 
Chemex in Val d'Or, a certified laboratory. Samples are assayed by fire-assay followed by atomic 
absorption or gravimetry according to industry standards. Their methodology is well documented 
and a quality control is in place. A chemist signs their analysis certificates.  
 
We do not have reason to believe that the methodology used by the different laboratories was not 
adequate for the results in the Barry I project. Geostat carried out analytical checks of a series of 
core samples. The results are presented in the data validation section of this report.

As mentioned in the previous section, the method of preparation and analysis of the samples is not 
available for the core samples assayed before the work done in 2005. However, the assay certificates 
from the samples sent to the laboratory in 1995, 1997, in 2005 by Murgor and Osisko and in 2006 
by Murgor are available and a complete verification of the values higher than 1 g/t Au shows an 
excellent correspondence between these certificates and the values in the database. Only 158 of the 
206 holes drilled in the Barry I project area are intersecting the Main mineralized zone.

Afterwards, core boxes are opened for drill hole logging and identification of the intersection to be 
sampled by Murgor geologist and consultants. Core is described directly in the drill holes description 
software. Sections of the core to be analyzed are marked with a marker. Then, Murgor technicians 
prepare the sample books, sample bags and tags accordingly. After cutting the core in half for one 
core box, the samples are then inserted into the sample bags. The bags are sealed and put into a 
large bag for transportation to the laboratory. The splitting of the core is done with a rock saw. 
Murgor is well organized for core description and sample preparation. 
 
Their own staff has handled all the 2006 samples taken by Murgor. Logging of the core drilled in 
2006 by Murgor has been done by Mr. Robert Gagnon, Bsc. Geo., Project geologist, Consultant for 
Murgor, Mr. Jean-Philippe Desrochers, Ph. D., P. Geo., V.P. Exploration and Mr. André C. Tessier, 
P. Geo. (On), P. Eng. (QC), President and CEO of Murgor Resources Inc.

In Geostat opinion, the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures are adequate and are 
done according to the industry standards. Geostat has no reason to believe that samples or analytical 
results are tempered with at any point during the sampling, test work and assaying procedures for 
the holes drilled in the Main Zone. The values of the other drill holes were not validated.

13- Data validation (Item 16) 
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 
Within the framework of our visit to the site, Geostat carried out an independent sampling program 
and an analytical check of the samples for the holes drilled at the end of 2005. 
 
The objective of this validation was to confirm the presence of the high gold values, especially on 
the few sections responsible for the majority of the mineralization found in the Barry I Main Zone 
Area project. Geostat had three holes drilled to verify the model interpretation of the deposit. One 
of the holes was drilled 30 metres further west of the desired coordinates, due to error location in 
the field. These holes were sampled and the core transported directly to the laboratory by Geostat's 
staff. We verified and sampled again some other holes. These holes are MB_29, MB_31, MB_40, 
108, 103, 134, 139 and 140. We selected a set of nine mineralized intersections corresponding to 
samples already analyzed in the past to verify the gold contain. Previous partners of Murgor already 
retrieved some of the selected mineralized zones from the core boxes. The core of the hole MB_26, 
from 8.1 to 11.11, hole 103 from 5 to 12.8, hole 108 from 16 to 24.8 and hole 140 from 4.5 to 29 
was missing in the core boxes. Geostat selected all the samples and supervised their extraction from 
the core boxes. For the samples of which remained a half-core of sufficient size, a quarter of the 
core was taken. Geostat photographed in detail the core boxes before the assay sample removal.

The core samples were first sent to the ALS Chemex laboratory in Val d'Or for preparation, gold 
and for metallic sieve analysis. At our request, the ALS Chemex Laboratory also sent pulps of each 
sample to the Bourlamaque laboratory in Val-d'Or for gold check analysis. The rejects were kept by 
the laboratory for validation purpose. 
 
A total of 41 control samples and 102 core samples from freshly drill holes were assayed for the 
Barry I projects.  
 
The next table presents the assay results on the samples taken by Geostat.

Most of the samples present a good correlation between the three results. There are only 11 samples 
out of 68 containing more than 1 g/t of gold in the results obtained from the ALS Chemex 
laboratory for the gold assay by MS-sieve and 30g-GRAV in the samples taken by Geostat. The 
sample of the hole 164, from 20 to 21 metres, shows a certain variation between the 30g-GRAV and 
the MS-GRAV methods. The results from the gravimetric method, from the two different 
laboratories, are 15.1 and 10.3, while the metallic sieve result is 23.5. There are not sufficient high 
gold values assayed to reach any conclusion. 
 

13.2 Calculations 
 
The correlation between the results from the Bourlamaque and the ALS Chemex laboratories is 
0.986.  
 
We applied the "signs test" to the results to compare the values from the re-assays of the different 
samples. This test is non-parametric for paired values, i.e. it does not imply the calculation of 
statistical parameters as the average or the standard deviation. It consists in counting the proportion 
of the samples whose value of group 1 is higher than that of group 2 and by adding the half-
proportion to it where the samples are equal. 
 
If the difference is only random, the proportion should range between 0.5-1/n½ and 0.5+1/n½, 
where n is the number of pairs implied in the comparison with a probability of 95%. This means 
that with only 10 pairs, the proportion can be as high as 81% and as low as 19%. With 21 pairs, the 
result must lie between 28 and 72%. With 100 pairs, it must be between 40 and 60% while with 
1000 pairs, it must be between 47 and 53% 
 
In the case of the results from the two laboratories, we got 143 pairs. The result should be between 
0.5± 0.0836, i.e. 58% and 42%. The result is 67/142, 47%. Then, there is no bias observed in these 
results. 
 
The correlation between the results from the MS-Sieve and the 30g-GRAV assay from the ALS 
Chemex laboratory is 0.981. 
 
The result of the "sign test", for 68 pairs, should be between 0.5± 0.12, i.e. 38% and 62%. The result 
is 37/68, 54%. There is no bias observed in these results.

14- Adjacent properties (Item 17) 
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 
We can only find little information on the properties adjacent to the Barry I Zone and Barry claims.  
 
Murgor possess the Windfall property, located about 20 km northeast of the Barry I project. The 
mineralization found consists of a sericite-fuschite shear zone with 1-15% quartz-
carbonate±tourmaline veins. These veins contain from traces up to 5% pyrite and locally some VG. 
The shear zone is between 2 to 5 metres thick, oriented N060º and dipping NNW at 60-70º. Murgor 
is presently working on that property by geophysics surveys and drilling campaign. The 
mineralization appears close to the surface. 
 
At least two other known properties are close to Barry I present gold deposits and had resources 
evaluated. These deposits are not close to the surface and should probably be mined by 
underground operations. These resources are not NI 43-101 compliant. The resources of these 
properties published by the different owners are: 
 

Property Tonnage (mt) Au g/t 
Lac Rouleau deposit 544,000 7.0 
Nubar deposit 564,000 6.2 

Table 10: List of some of the deposits close to the Barry I property area. 

 
As presented in figure 6, many projects and prospects are worked near the Barry I project. 
 
Geostat's staffs have no mining interest in the sector.

15- Mineral processing and metallurgical testing (item 18) 
 
Geostat did not address the aspects of mineral processing and metallurgical treatment at this stage 
on the project but some mineral processing and metallurgical testing are part of our 
recommendations.

16- Mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates (Item 19) 
 
Geostat carried out the update of the resources estimation of the Barry I Main Zone Area project. 
This section presents the methodology used and the results of the resource estimation. 
 

16.1 Data used 
The data from the drill holes core used for the estimation comes from the drill holes database 
managed by Metanor. We added the results of the most recent drilling campaign (holes MB06-200 to 
MB06-257) and the hole LON88_3 to the database.  We added a total of 59 holes. A total of 189 
holes intersects the Barry I Main Zone in 437 instances. 48 of these holes are in the most recent 
drilling campaign. The surface topography still has to be surveyed by a certified surveyor. The 
topography used for the estimation is actually derived from the drill holes collars. Some of the drill 
holes was surveyed, others not. All the interpretation is done according to the local grid, which is 
roughly N330°. Most of the holes were drilled along the N330° orientation, roughly perpendicular to 
the general direction of the mineralized zones. 
 
It was noted that mine coordinates and UTMs were not concordant in some of the older holes and 
some of the newer holes.  Here are lists of missmatches between Mine and UTM coordinates.  
Recent holes have been tested in two dimentions. 
 
The estimated convertion from the mining coordinates to UTMs is: 
Rotation: -28.8512936227465º 
Translation: 
X: +442886.77 
Y: +5426103.98

The Mine coordinates were used for the calculations in this report.  The incertainty on the location 
of the holes leads us to classify all the resource as inferred. 
 
For the hole LON88_3 (Hole not used in the estimation because it does not intersect the Main 
zone), the mine coordinates have been calculated from the UTMs to be incorporated in the 
database.

16.2 Mineralized zones 
 
Geostat, based on the previous interpretation provided by the geologists of Murgor, carried out the 
geological interpretation of the mineralized zone. We checked the agreement between geological 
interpretation and the mineralized intersections defined from the drill holes. We designed envelopes 
around the composites formed of the mineralized zones estimated according to the geological 
interpretation between the sections and our knowledge of the deposit. The correlation with the rock 
types was not validated but for the quartz-porphyry, as the core description need to be standardized 
according to the new geological model and to the lack of information regarding the geology in the 
database. 
 
The gold mineralization on the property is closely related to the amount of veining, intensity of 
alteration and percentage of sulphides. All are key factors and generally all three of these elements 
are needed in order to obtain significant gold mineralization. This style of mineralization produces 
sections with significant gold concentrations but they are commonly narrow with widths in the order 
of 0.3 to 1.5 metres. The thicker mineralized sections represent a higher density of these narrow 
zones.  
 
Gold-bearing mineralization lies in pyritized and moderately altered volcanic flows near contacts 
with quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes and plugs. Mineralization is characterized by a system of east-
northeast and north-northeast sheeted quartz-carbonate veins dipping at 40-60 degrees to the south-
southeast and the east-southeast respectively. The known mineralization is up to 500 metres long, up 
to 150 metres wide and tested, for the majority of the drill holes. 
 
The Barry I gold mineralized envelopes are located south of a major shear and fold zone. The 
mineralized envelopes represent elongated dome shapes even if the mineralized veins are dipping 
moderately. The mineralized envelopes show variable thicknesses, which vary from a few 
centimetres to more than 30 metres. The actual mineralized envelopes of the Main Zone Area occur 
mainly in the first 30 metres of rock below surface. The presence of the gold mineralization located 
at the top of the dome shaped is associated with silicified volcanites. At depth greater than 30 
metres, the volcanic rocks are more mafic, massive and show the presence of vacuoles. 
 
The gold grades vary within the envelopes and visible gold is frequently observed in the core. 
 
The folding periods having happened after the intrusion of the first porphyry body might have 
remobilized the gold mineralisation in the fold noses.

16.3 Composites 
 
The method used to estimate the resources is to evaluate the grades of regular blocks inside the 
mineralized envelopes. This method requires the use of samples of regular length. Composites are 
then created starting from the original samples. We used a composite length of 1.5-m with a 
minimum of 0.8 meter sampled with some dillution. We consider this length suitable compared to 
the dimension of the blocks of the model (3 metres E by 3 metres N by 3 metres Z) and to smooth 
the effect of the high grade samples with shorter lengths.  The highest grades used are 60.9 g/t Au 
over 1 metre (Hole MB06-238) and 54.7 g/t Au over 0.5 metre (Hole 139). Moreover, we consider 
the average thickness of the mineralized zones at 6 metres.

16.4 Analysis of the gold grades distribution 
The grades of the 1.5-m composites used in the calculation show a distribution approaching the 
lognormal law. There is presence of high values. In the Barry project, the maximum gold content is 
39.8 g/t for a 1m composite and 26.03 g/t for a 1.5m composite. The following figures present the 
histograms and cumulative frequency plot of the 1.5-m composites in the Barry I Main Zone Area 
project.

Figure 31: Curve of cumulated frequencies for 1.5-m composites of Barry I Main Zone Area. 

 
As the histogram of the precedent figure shows, the high gold values do not deviate significantly 
from the lognormal curve, except for the very low grades. Therefore, according to this test, it is not 
necessary to cut the high values. 
 
It is also interesting to consider the contribution of the gold contained in the high-grade samples 
proportionally to their number in the data set. We consider an anomaly the situation when more 
than 10% of the gold contained in the high grades is found in less than 1% of the set of composites. 
In this case, 10% of the gold is contained in 1.55% of the composites. The following graph shows 
the gold contribution of the high-grade gold values according to the corresponding quantity of data 
(expressed as a percentage.) We conclude that the ratio 10:1 is not exceeded and that, according to 
this test, it is not necessary to cut the high gold values of the 1.5-m composites in the Barry I Main 
Zone Area project.

16.5 Spatial continuity of the gold distribution 
 
The spatial continuity of gold was calculated in the 2006 report.  All the calculated variograms 
suggested a short distance of influence of the samples, at maximum to 13.5 metres. The drilling 
pattern should be smaller than 13.5 m to be able to define a good anisotropic variogram.

16.6 Resource estimation 
 

16.6.1 Definitions: 
 
The classification of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves used in this report relies with the 
definitions provided in National Instrument 43-101, which came into effect on February 1, 2001. 
We further confirm that we have followed the guidelines adopted by the Council of the Canadian 
Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum. The relevant definitions for the 
CIM Standards/Nl 43-101 are as follows:  
 
1. Preliminary Feasibility Study  

A Preliminary Feasibility Study is a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project that 
has advanced to a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground mining, or the pit 
configuration, in the case of an open pit, has been established, where an effective method of 
mineral processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based on reasonable 
assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, and economic factors and evaluation of 
other relevant factors which are sufficient for a Qualified Person, acting reasonably, to 
determine if all or part of the Mineral Resource may be classified as a Mineral Reserve.  

 
2. Exploration Information  

Exploration information means geological, geophysical, geochemical, sampling, drilling, 
trenching, analytical testing, assaying, mineralogical, metallurgical and other similar information 
concerning a particular property that is derived from activities undertaken to locate, investigate, 
define or delineate a mineral prospect or mineral deposit.  

 
3. Mineral Resource  

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.  

 
4. Inferred Mineral Resource  

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  

 
5. Indicated Mineral Resource  

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are 
spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.  



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 81 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

 
6. Measured Mineral Resource  

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability 
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and 
grade continuity.  

 
7. Mineral Reserve  

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is 
mined.  

 
8. Probable Mineral Reserve  

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical,

extraction can be justified.  

 
9. Proven Mineral Reserve  

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.  

16.6.2 Resources evaluation  
 
The resources of the Main Zone Area were evaluated by the section and plan method. The 
calculation method used the average of the composites grades within the entire estimated envelope 
to calculate a grade. No individual envelopes for every composite were created for these evaluations. 
The minimum grade for a composite to be used for the calculation is 1 g/t Au over 1 metre. The 
results are the following: 
 

Method Tonnage, t. Grade, g/t Vertical Extents 
Sections 700E-1200E 1,747,000 3.81 1,825m to top 
Plan 1925-2009 1,526,000 3.90 1925m to top

Block modelling of the Main Zone Area resources  
 
A block model of 3 metres by 3 metres by 3 metres is used. The parameters of the block model are 
the following: 
 

Origin of the model East North Elevation 
Dimension of the blocks 3 3 -3 
Minimum coordinate 602m (1) -250m (1) 1904m (38) 
Maximum coordinate 1,250m (217) 0m (85) 2015m (1) 

Table 13: Geometric parameters used for the Main Zone block model estimation. 

 
Block modelling of the Main Zone Area resources by inverse distance 
 
The settings in BlkCad for the estimations were: 
Search Ellipsoid: 80m x 80m x 40m  Orientation: 180º x -40º x 0º 
Minimum number of samples to use: 1 
Maximum number of samples to use: 12 
Maximum number of samples from one hole: 4 
Block discretisation: 3 x 3 x 3 
Use ellipsoid influenced distances in calculation: Yes 
 
The estimated resources were classified in accordance with the specifications of the 43-101 Policy, 
namely in measured, indicated, and inferred resources. In spite of the close distance between the 
actual drill holes and a survey by a certified surveyor of most of their collars in the main Zone, no 
measured resources were defined in the Main Zone. This is due to the absence of a detailed 
topographic survey of the actual surface, the topographic surface acting as a mineralization contact 
boundary, the incertitude regarding the position of the hole collars not surveyed. The mineralized 
envelopes beginning close to the surface, this parameter is important for measured resources. The 
classification criterion is based on a scheme of proximity and the parameters are as follows:

lenses, 90ºx0ºx40º)

16.6.3 Specific gravity  
This item was taken from the 2006 NI43-101 Report from M. Ghislain Dechêsnes, P. Geo. from 
Geostat Systems Int'l Inc. 
 
Specific gravity measurements were done for the 2006 NI43-101 report in order to confirm and 
validate the previous values used by other companies that have worked on the property. Murgor 
prepared five samples. Geostat measured the volume and weighed the core samples in order to 
measure the specific gravity.  
 
The S.G. ranges from 2.79 up to 2.99. The average for the mineralized rock is 2.89. 
 

Measured density - Measured volume

Average       2.89

Table 17: 2005 results of the measured specific gravity of the Barry I Main Zone. 

 
A second estimation of the S.G. was realized by adding the cumulative error of ± 10 ml due to the 
reading error on the volume of the rock piece in the graduated cylinder. 10 ml were removed to the 
water value read on the cylinder with only water and 10 ml were added to the value read for the 
volume of water and sample. We added the two possible errors of reading on the cylinder to 
minimize the possibility of over-estimating the density. In that case, the S.G. ranges from 2.73 up to 
2.88. The average for the mineralized rock is 2.79.

18- Interpretation and conclusions (Item 21) 
 
The resources reported in this document are compliant with current standards as outlined in the 
National Instrument 43-101. 
 
Geostat can confirm that most of the gold content of the database are corroborated by check 
analyses and that no statistical bias was observed. 
 
Specific gravity measurement of the core was performed and it ranged from 2.79 to 2.99, the average 
value for the mineralized rock used in the calculation being 2.80.  
 
The absence of a detailed surveyed topography, the incertitude regarding the position of the drill 
holes not surveyed and the difficulty to calculate an anisotropic variogram does not allow us to 
declare measured resources at this stage.  
 
The resources estimated by block modelling (inverse distance), 3 metres along the all the directions 
(north, south, elevation) could be established as follows for the Barry I Main Zone Area project:

It could be envisaged to mine the upper levels of the mineralized body by open pit mining. 
 
The Barry I project contains enough indicated and inferred gold resources to justify additional work 
on the west side of the Main Zone, in the 43 and 45 zones and exploration work on the rest of the 
property. The quantity of resources in the part of the Main Zone at the east of the porphyry plug 
leads to a prefeasibility study and for metallurgical testing. We consider that it will be necessary to 
carry out certain work before or during this suggested study in order to increase the quality and the 
quantity of the resources.

19- Recommendations (Item 22) 
 
1. Geostat recommends the survey of the topography and all the drill holes in the area of the 

Barry I Main Zone Area. 
 
2. Geostat recommends the realisation of a detailed new description of the old drill core to better 

understand the correlation between the mineralized envelopes and the geology. 
 
3. Geostat recommends the completion of the sampling of the core from previous campaigns. 

 
4. Geostat recommends carrying out a metallurgical test from drill hole core samples. These tests 

are needed to define the best suitable treatment process and to measure the metallurgical 
recovery. These results should help for the design and the construction of a new mill, if this 
option is chosen. They will direct us in the search of an existing mill. 

 
5. Geostat recommends carrying the proposed additional drilling, interpretation and update of the 

resources prior to a prefeasibility study. 
 
6. Geostat recommends the continuation of exploration and development works on the Barry 

property. This project shows significant potential to evolve as a small gold mine. 
 
7. Geostat recommends preparing the necessary documents to obtain the permission to mine a 

bulk sample for metallurgical characterization in the case of the purchase of an existing mill and 
its move at the Barry site or in the case of custom milling. The bulk sample should be in the 
order of 1,000 to 10,000 tons. The sample could be sent to Joe Mann mine, in Chibougamau, to 
Beroma mill in Rouyn or to Bachelor Lake mill in Desmaraisville, if in operation.

Appendix 3: Procedure of samples preparation and assay. 
 

ALS Chemex 
 

Sample Preparation Procedures 
(From ALS Chemex web site) 

Crushing 
Samples that require crushing are dried at 110-120°C and then crushed with either an oscillating 
jaw crusher or a roll crusher. The ALS Chemex QC specification for crushed material is that 
>70% of the sample must pass a 2 mm (10 meshes) screen (as in graph below).  

 

Note that if the whole sample need to be pulverized, then this condition becomes irrelevant. 
Crushing charges are based on the sample weight. The entire sample is crushed, but depending 
on the method, only a portion of the crushed material may be carried through to the pulverizing 
stage. That amount, typically 250 g to 1 kg, is subdivided from the main sample by use of a riffle 
splitter. If splitting is required, a substantial part of the sample (the "reject" or "spare") remains. 
Ordinarily we retain a 1-2 kg split of this reject, but if a client wishes to pay a small additional 
charge, then we will retain the entire reject.  

Pulverizing  
A whole or split portion derived from the crushing process is pulverised using a ring mill. The 
size of the split is determined by the client based on the pulverising procedure that is selected. 
Split sizes for manganese or chrome steel rings are typically 250 g to 4 kg; however split sizes for 
zirconia rings are 100 g and those for tungsten carbide rings are only 75 g. Because of the relative 
lightness of these latter two materials, the size of the sample to be pulverized must necessarily be 
reduced to these weights in order to achieve the ALS Chemex QC specification for final 
pulverizing, namely that >85% of the sample be less than 75 microns (200 meshes) (see graph 
below ).  



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 112 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

 

 

For those samples which require enhanced homogeneity, such as samples which are known to 
exhibit coarse gold behaviour, intermediate pulverization of the entire sample (or a representative 
split) is also available 

Gold assays 
 

Gravimetric Methods  
Gravimetric methods involve the use of balances to weigh the element of interest, either in its 
pure elemental form or as a chemical compound. One of the most common gravimetric 
determinations is that of gold and silver following a fire assay fusion and cupellation. The 
precious metal bead that remains following cupellation is an alloy of silver and gold. Weighing 
this bead will give the total weight of silver and gold. If the bead is then treated with dilute nitric 
acid, it is possible to remove the silver quantitatively. The residual mass consists of pure gold, 
which can then be weighed separately, thus allowing the silver to be determined by difference. 
The balances used for this purpose are microbalances capable of weighing to the nearest 
microgram (one millionth of a gram). Analysis of bullion for gold, silver and base metal content is 
another common procedure.  

 

Lead Collection 
The standard fire assay procedure has been used for millennia to dissolve and separate gold, silver 
and other precious metals. In the first part of the fire assay, precious metals are dissolved using an 
aggressive fusion mixture consisting of litharge (lead oxide) and a variety of other fluxes such as 
sodium carbonate, borax, silica, potassium nitrate and household flour. During the complex 
reactions that occur between sample and the flux mixture, the litharge is reduced to molten lead 
and the silica within the sample is oxidized to a borosilicate slag. The molten lead that is produced 
within the reaction mixture forms as tiny droplets throughout. Because of the high specific gravity 



Technical Report - Resources Evaluation of April 2007 on the Barry I Project, Barry township, Metanor Resources Inc. Page 113 

Systèmes Géostat International Inc. 

of the lead droplets, they filter down through the reaction mixture, dissolving and collecting the 
precious metals as they do so. In an ideal fusion, the end result is a clean two-phase melt in which 
the barren borosilicate slag floats on top of the molten lead containing the precious metals. When 
this two-phase melt is poured into an iron mold to cool, the lead solidifies and can be recovered.  

The subsequent separation of lead and precious metals occurs during the next step known as 
cupellation. 

 

Cupellation 
Cupellation most commonly refers to that part of the fire assay process. Following a successful 
fusion, the analyst is left with a lead "button" which contains all the precious metals from a 
particular sample. Cupellation is the process by which the lead is separated from the precious 
metals. Cupellation is considered "total" if the lead is removed in its entirety and "partial" if it is 
not. For the determination of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, a total cupellation is standard. In 
this case, the lead button is placed on a magnesia cupel in a furnace at 960-1000°C. At this 
temperature, the lead melts and is simultaneously oxidised. Part of the lead is volatilised and part 
is drawn into the cupel by capillary attraction. Eventually the lead is entirely removed and what 
remains behind is a small precious metal bead that represents the entire precious metal content of 
the original sample. This bead can then be analysed by a variety of methods.
