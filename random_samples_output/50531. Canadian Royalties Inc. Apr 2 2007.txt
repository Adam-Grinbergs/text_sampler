SUMMARY 
 
The South Trend property consists of 81 un-surveyed contiguous map designated units covering 
3,344.13 ha located in NTS 35G/08 in the Nunavik region of Quebec, Canada. All map 
designated units are in good standing until May 25, 2009. On November 18th, 2002 Canadian 
Royalties Inc. ("CRI") was granted an option, as amended, to acquire a 100% interest in the 
Montoro South Trend property, provided that CRI paid a $30,000 cash fee and incurred 
exploration expenditures of $500,000 over 4 years.  As of December 31, 2005 CRI has exercised 
the option and now owns a 100% interest. Montoro retains a 1% net smelter royalty and 862539 
Alberta Ltd. retains a 2% net smelter royalty. CRI may purchase, at any time before the first 
anniversary of the date on which Commercial Production is achieved: (i) International Montoro 
Resources Inc.'s (formerly Montoro Resources Inc.) 1% NSR by paying $1,000,000; and (ii) half 
of 862539 Alberta Ltd.'s 2% NSR (i.e. 1%) by paying $1,000,000. 
 
The South Trend property is located on a broad plateau, at an elevation of 450-550 metres above 
sea level in an area of gently rolling topography, north of the tree line.  
 
The property can be reached by helicopter from the coastal communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and 
nearby Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay). All of these villages have daily air service from 
Montreal, Quebec. Heavy equipment, fuel and freight can be shipped to the coastal ports of 
Douglas Harbour located 84 kilometres northeast of the Ivakkak deposit or Deception Bay 
located 82 kilometres to the north, with arrivals in July through October from southern Canada 
and Europe. Personnel and perishable goods can be delivered to the Donaldson airstrip located 
55 km northeast of the Ivakkak deposit, which is operated year-round by Xstrata Nickel. 
Permission may be obtained for scheduling chartered flights in and out of Donaldson. Supplies 
are moved from this point by helicopter to the South Trend property. In winter bulk commodities 
can be delivered by ski-equipped aircraft directly to nearby lakes or by overland tractor.  
 
The Cape Smith Belt in which the South Trend property and the Ivakkak deposit are located in 
the Trans-Hudson Orogen, an early Proterozoic collisional zone, which separates the Archean 
Superior Province to the south from the northerly Proterozoic Churchill Province. Dominant rock 
types include tholeiitic basalt, argillaceous sediments and ultramafic intrusions and flows. The 
Cape Smith Belt hosts two belts of intrusive ultramafic rocks, approximately 15-20 km apart; the 
Raglan Trend in the north and the South Raglan Trend in the south. The Raglan Trend hosts the 
producing Katinniq nickel-copper-platinum group element (Ni-Cu-PGE) mine. The South 
Raglan Trend hosts the Mesamax, Mequillon, Expo, TK and Ivakkak deposits majority owned by 
Canadian Royalties Inc.  
 
The sulphide mineralization at Ivakkak is hosted in a relatively narrow sill or dyke of peridotite-
pyroxenite-gabbro composition intruding mafic volcanic rocks and/or a mixed sequence of mafic 
volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The mineralization consists of massive, net-textured and 
disseminated sulphides. Massive sulphides are generally constituted of more than 90% sulphides; 
the net-textured type contains perhaps 25 to 75% sulphides while the disseminated 
mineralization contains traces to 25% sulphides. The massive and net-textured types carry 
sufficiently high base and precious metal concentrations to be of economic interest. The net-
textured and disseminated types of mineralization are generally of greater volume and extent 
than the massive sulphides. Massive sulphide bodies, the exploration targets of choice, are of 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  ii 

relatively small size compared to their host ultramafic units, but exhibit good geological and 
grade continuity.  
 
There has been recent initial metallurgical test work conducted by SGS on the Ivakkak deposit 
with final results to be issued on or after March 23, 2007. Preliminary indications are that a 
copper concentrate with 30% Cu and 95% recovery and a nickel concentrate with 14% Ni and 
75% recovery are attainable for processing the Ivakkak deposit mineralized material. 
 
Exploration for these Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits relies primarily on geophysical techniques, 
geological mapping and surface prospecting, followed by diamond drilling. Exploration work on 
the property included magnetic, horizontal loop electromagnetic and pulse electromagnetic 
surveys, coupled with geological mapping and prospecting, which define the Ivakkak deposit. 
Subsequent diamond drilling in 2005 amounts to 32 holes recovering BQ size core for a total of 
3,553 metres. In 2006 CRI continued diamond drilling with 58 holes (7,362 m). The drill pattern 
included multiple holes from the same drill set-up with a variety of inclinations, at approximately 
25 metre intervals over a strike length of 450 metres with the deepest intersection at 185 metres 
vertical. 
 
A resource estimate using this data including massive and net-textured sulphide mineralization 
and a $C40/tonne NSR cut-off identifies indicated and inferred resources as follows:

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of mineral 
resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other 
relevant issues. 

(2) The quantity and grade reported in this inferred resource estimation are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration to define an indicated mineral resource on the property and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in 
discovery of an indicated or measured mineral resource on the property 

 
It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005. 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  iii 

Based on the success of exploration programs resulting in the discovery of the Ivakkak deposit 
on the South Trend property, a two-phase exploration program is warranted, and should expand 
the economic potential of this deposit. 
 
A total of 1,675 metres of infill and step out drilling is recommended in a Phase I budget of 
$475,000 that will focus on confirming and expanding the dimensions of the deposit. 
 
A Phase II budget of $450,000 is proposed to support the preparation of a feasibility study to 
assess the economic potential of the Ivakkak deposit. A limited amount of diamond drilling is 
also included in this budget to allow for any additional in fill drilling required for geotechnical 
and engineering purposes.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
At the request of Canadian Royalties Inc. ("CRI"), G.A. Harron & Associates Inc. ("GAHA"), 
and P & E Mining Consultants Inc. ("P&E") have been contracted to prepare a Technical Report 
on the Ivakkak deposit located on the South Trend property in the Lac Forcier area (NTS: 
35G/08) of Nunavik, as of January 15, 2007. P&E was also requested to estimate the inferred 
and indicated resources contained within the currently known deposit. GAHA was requested to 
qualify the proposed exploration programs and budgets for the on-going development of the 
property. The property is material to the issuer, as it contains a significant addition to known 
resources hosted within the Raglan South Nickel Project. The property is classified as an 
advanced exploration project. 
 
CRI is a reporting issuer corporation in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. The 
common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It is understood that this report will be 
used to provide continuous disclosure of the Ivakkak deposit inferred and indicated resources to 
the CRI Board of Directors and to support CRI's Annual Information Filing. In addition, this 
report will be used as a supporting document for a bankable feasibility study currently underway 
as of its filing date. 
 
This technical report is to conform to National Instrument 43-101 standards. Prior to this 
assignment GAHA and P&E provided CRI with a technical report on the Ivakkak deposit dated 
March 31, 2006 and is considered to be totally independent of CRI. Prior to this assignment P&E 
provided CRI with or participated in various technical reports including Resource Estimates on 
the Ivakkak and other deposits owned by CRI on their Raglan South Nickel Project. 
 
GAHA visited the property during the period August 9-23, 2005, and August 17-31, 2006 when 
active exploration drilling was taking place. For this report, GAHA has examined four drill core 
holes from the Ivakkak deposit. Two P&E qualified persons, Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Tracy 
Armstrong, P.Geo., also visited the Ivakkak Project site on August 18, 2006, examined two core 
drillholes and retrieved four representative verification core samples from those two holes. 
 
This report contains revised disclosure of inferred and indicated resources in the Ivakkak deposit 
resulting from additional diamond drilling in 2006. The report also contains details of the land 
tenure, a summary of previous exploration and development work, a compilation and synthesis 
of geology, geophysics and assay data, and recommendations for further exploration and 
development of the property. 
 
Cost data used to create proposed budgets to support the proposed work programs are based on a 
general knowledge of current costs, as experienced by the author on other projects in the 
Nunavik and Nunavut Territories over the past 12 months.  
 
Metric units of measure are used by geologists on this property.

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The property consists of 81 unsurveyed contiguous map designated units ("MDU") covering 
3,344.13 ha. The serial numbers of the MDU are 1019425 to 1019505 inclusive located in NTS 
35G/08 in the Nunavut region of Quebec, Canada (Figure 3-1 and 3-2). All MDU are in good 
standing until May 25, 2009.  
 
In order to maintain this type of mineral tenure of the lands exploration expenditures of $97,200 
and fees of $7,128 are required for the next renewal. There is $1,223,390 of excess credits 
available to be applied as annual renewal expenditures.  
 
On November 18, 2002 CRI was granted an option to acquire a 100% interest in the 81 MDU 
properties by Montoro Resources Inc. Terms included a cash payment of $30,000 and a work 
commitment of $500,000 over 4 years. As of December 31, 2005 CRI has exercised the option 
and now owns a 100% interest. Montoro retains a 1% net smelter royalty and 862539 Alberta 
Ltd. retains a 2% net smelter royalty. CRI may purchase, at any time before the first anniversary 
of the date on which Commercial Production is achieved: (i) International Montoro Resources 
Inc.'s (formerly Montoro Resources Inc.) 1% NSR by paying $1,000,000; and (ii) half of 862539 
Alberta Ltd.'s 2% NSR (i.e. 1%) by paying $1,000,000.   
 
Details of the MDU are presented in Appendix IX. 
 
To the writer's knowledge there are no current or pending challenges to ownership of the lands, 
as revealed in records maintained by the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles, Faune et Parcs 
("MRNFP"). CRI warrants that it has not received from any government authority any notice of, 
or communication relating to, any actual or alleged breach of any environmental laws, 
regulations, policies or permits with respect to the property.  
 
Permits issued by Provincial and Federal Government ministries are not required in order to 
execute preliminary exploration activities on the property. However permits to establish camp 
facilities are required and are in place.

4.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE, PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The South Trend property is located on a broad plateau, at an elevation of 450-550 metres above 
sea level. Relief is in the order of 50-75 metres in an area of gently rolling topography, north of 
the tree line, within the Povungnituk Range. The topography is characterized by east-west 
trending ridges and valleys with ridges preferentially underlain by mafic and ultramafic intrusive 
rocks. Drill hole information indicates that overburden in the area is generally less than 20 
metres in thickness.  CRI has the sufficiency of surface rights for future exploration and in the 
near future will be applying for mining leases that will allow mining operations, including 
potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, and potential processing plant 
sites.  
 
Vegetation consists of sparse shrubs, plants and grasses, which grow to less than 25 centimetres 
in height. Outcrop ridges are generally bare rock, devoid of vegetation, where outcrop or subcrop 
is commonly reduced to heaps of frost heaved blocks and boulders. The low areas between 
outcrop ridges are typically flat, grass-covered tundra traversed by small ephemeral streams. The 
entire area is underlain by permafrost resulting in widespread soil solifluction and soil polygons. 
At the nearby Raglan Mine, the permafrost reaches a depth of 400 metres, and the average rock 
temperature is -6°C.  
 
The climate of the area is sub-Arctic, with summer (July and early August) temperatures ranging 
from 0° C and 20° C while winter temperatures range from 0° C and -50 °C. Snow can 
accumulate in any month of the year. In some instances, sheltered gullies and small valleys can 
remain snow covered throughout the year. The field season for surface exploration activities 
optimally lasts the months of June, July, August and early September, with some early winter 
snow expected in late August and early September. The area is subject to strong wind conditions 
and periods of dense fog. 
 
The property can be reached by helicopter from the coastal communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and 
nearby Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay). All of these villages have daily air service from 
Montreal, Quebec. Heavy equipment, fuel and freight can be shipped to the coastal ports of 
Douglas Harbour located 84 kilometres northeast of the Ivakkak deposit or Deception Bay 
located 82 kilometres to the north, with arrivals in July through October from southern Canada 
and Europe. Personnel and perishable goods can be delivered to the Donaldson airstrip located 
55 km northeast of the Ivakkak deposit, which is operated year-round by Xstrata Nickel. 
Permission may be obtained for scheduling chartered flights in and out of Donaldson. Supplies 
are moved from this point by helicopter to the South Trend property. In winter bulk commodities 
can be delivered by ski-equipped aircraft directly to nearby lakes or by overland tractor.  
 
Exploration activities are supported by the Raglan South Nickel Project main camp, Expo, and 
the closest sub-camp, Mequillon, located 24 kilometres to the east. 
 
The project will need to recruit both technical and managerial manpower sources in southern 
Canada. Similarly all fuels, food and mining gear will need to be acquired in southern Canada. 
Electrical energy will need to be supplied by diesel generators, as no prospective power sources 
are known in the area.

5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
Early exploration activities began in the Ungava area with Mr. Murray Watts in the early 1930's. 
Intensive exploration efforts commenced in the 50's with the application of airborne geophysical 
techniques. Major discoveries over the years, include Xstrata Nickel's (formerly Falconbridge) 
Raglan deposits in 1964-66, the Amax Expo deposit in 1967, the Canadian Royalties TK, 
Mesamax, Mequillon deposits in 2001-2003 followed by the Tootoo and Ivakkak deposits in 
2005.

the best results (0.227% Ni, 0.304% Cu, 900 ppb Pd, 210 ppb Pt, 
22 ppb Au), were obtained in a thin (?) sheared and mineralized 
ultramafic sill (like Xstrata's Delta 8 and 9 prospects), which are 5 
km to the northwest. At the Ivakkak deposit, best grab sample 
(#161151) returned weak values of 106 ppm Cu and 94 ppm Ni. 

Recommendations: More mapping and geophysics to be done especially where they 
found interesting Ni, Cu and PGE results in the northwest part of 
the PEM, outside South Trend property. Balance of property 
including Ivakkak deposit be returned. Note: only 3 samples out of 
68 were analysed for PGE. 

 
GM-56271 
Company:  Augusta Metals Inc., 1997 
Location:  Just west of South Trend. 
Work:   MAG and HLEM surveys over three local grids (see GM-56270). 

 
GM-56270 
Company:  Augusta Metals Inc., 1997 
Location:  Same as GM-56271, just west of Ivakkak. 
Work: MAG and HLEM surveys, geological mapping and prospecting, 

following up an airborne geophysical survey (AMAG, AVLF-EM, 
AEM). 

Results: Targets were selected based on their geophysical response. Some 
diamond drilling was recommended. No assay results are available. 

 
GM-54965 
Company:  Augusta Metals Inc., 1996 
Location:  PEM 1072, just west of Ivakkak. 
Work:   AMAG and AEM, prospecting, lithogeochemical sampling. 
Results: No new or significant mineralized zones were found as an 

extensive layer of overburden covers a flat lying ultramafic body. 
 

GM-47537 
Company:  Beaufield Resources Inc., 1988 
Location:  PEM 716; over many blocks, but not Ivakkak. 
Work: Report describes previous airborne surveys (see GM-47536), and 

geological mapping follow up. 
Results: The vast majority of AEM conductors are caused by conductive 

sediments. 
The only AEM responses of interest have direct magnetic 
coincidence and may be due to massive pyrrhotite sulphides. 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit   Page 10 of 115 

Magnetic responses correspond with mafic sills. These tend to 
outcrop so only those portions of sills in apparent association with 
conductors need additional follow up. 

 
Three noteable PGE anomalies were found over this property (but 
not over Ivakkak). Grab samples returned assays up to 1.41% Cu, 
0.99% Ni and 1482 ppb Pd, a few kilometres west of Ivakkak, and 
assays of 0.49% Ni and 0.24% Cu, and 0.10% Ni and 0.20% Cu, a 
few kilometres east of Ivakkak. 

 
GM-46933 
Company:  Imperial Platinum Co., 1987 
Location: PEM 723; covers the north part of Ivakkak; same area as GM-

44929. 
Work: MAG and HLEM, geological mapping and assays for Pd, Pt, Au, 

Ni, Cu, etc. 
Results: The PEM is located in the "Upper Povungnituk group, dominated 

by tholeiitic volcanics with mafic and ultramafic sills in the 
sedimentary horizons. All the rocks have been repeatedly folded 
and faulted". 

 
Four areas hosting anomalous PGE were discovered in mafic / 
ultramafic sills, but all outside of Ivakkak deposit: Juliet East, 
Juliet South, Lac Forcier, Lac Fleury. Two styles of mineralization 
noted: primary disseminated sulphides and horizons of remobilized 
sulphides.  
 
Directly north of Lac Forcier, which is located at less than 1 km 
east of Ivakkak, a northeast trending concordant tabular pyroxenite 
body, contains up to 15% sulphides (chalcopyrite >> pyrrhotite), 
with an apparently concordant 2 m wide gossan zone, 30 m south 
of the ultramafics. Best assays: 0.23 g/t PGE in the pyroxenite, and 
0.45 g/t PGE in a shear. The Pd to Pt ratio is about 3 to 1. One 
sample also returned 0.064% Ni and 0.156% Cu. East of Lac 
Forcier, a north-striking gabbroic sill returned up to 0.25 g/t PGE, 
from a thin gossan on the east side of the gabbro. 

 
Recommendations: Detail mapping and geophysics (50 m line spacing), and drilling 

over Juliet East showing (about 12 km west-north-west of 
Ivakkak); mapping and geophysics over the other three areas of 
interest. 

 
GM-46929 
Company:  Imperial Platinum Corp., 1987 
Location: Over PEM 723, i.e. over the north part of Ivakkak property, and 

the area to the northeast. 
Work:   MAG and HLEM as reconnaissance geophysical traverses.

GM-44857 
Company:  Geotest Corp., 1987 
Location:  East of Forcier Lake. Not over Pproperty. 
Work: Geological reconnaissance and lithogeochemical surveys, 

including PGE assays. Weak values in Pt, Pd and Au east of 
Ivakkak (up to 70 ppb Pt, up to 68 ppb Pd and up to 182 ppb Au in 
various spots within 5 km E of Ivakkak). Their best result was 
obtained near Vaillant Lake, 15 km E of Ivakkak: 459 ppb Pt, 2071 
ppb Pd, in grab sample # 15025 (showing 7). 

 
GM-44856 
Company:  Geotest Corp., 1987 
Location:  West border of South Trend and westward. 
Work: Geological reconnaissance and lithogeochemical surveys, 

including PGE assays. Pd values approximately 2 km west of 
Ivakkak: 855 ppb Pd in grab sample # 15060 (showing 6), 492 ppb 
Pt, 642 ppb Pd and 118 ppb Au in grab sample # 15069 (showing 
7). Low values obtained over Ivakkak deposit. 

 
GM-9970 (A, B and C) 
Company:  Compagnie minière de l'Ungava, 1958 
Location:  Extending from Ivakkak to Mequillon Lake area. 
Work: Geological mapping and prospecting, soil geochemistry, 12 DDHs 

and 3 packsack drill holes (the DDHs are not located over Ivakkak 
deposit). 

Results: Soil geochemistry is confirmed to be useful for defining Cu-Ni 
bearing pyrrhotite and pyrite zones. Interesting values in Cu and Ni 
were found in the DDHs (up to 3.77% Cu over 2,03 m, up to 
1.22% Ni over 16,76 m, and 0.89% Ni and 0.80% Cu over 29,57 
m. 

Recommendations: Many untested areas remain. DDHs recommended for best HLEM 
conductive zones, with use of some ground VLEM and soil 
geochemistry to help discriminate the targets. First assaying for 
PGE's in the South Trend. 

 
Apart from reconnaissance geological mapping, no intensive work 
was done over the Ivakkak deposit area part of their property.

Company:  Compagnie minière de l'Ungava, 1958 
Location:  Extending from Ivakkak to Mequillon Lake area. 
Work: MAG and HLEM surveys on specific grids. VLEM surveys at a 

few locations. 
Recommendations: VLEM to detail some targets followed by diamond drilling, but not 

over Ivakkak property.

Results: Numerous showings discovered, especially near Mequillon Lake. 
Showings 15, 16 and 17, are within 15 km of the Ivakkak deposit. 
Assays from these showing yielded the following values: 
Showing 15: mineralized gabbro boulders, up to 0.47% Cu and up 
to 0.69% Ni. 
Showing 16: mineralized gabbro, 0.48% Cu and 0.73% Ni. 
Showing 17: contact gabbro and slate, up to 1.13% Cu and up to 
0.49% Ni. 

 
No significant values were recorded for the Ivakkak deposit 
location. 

 
In summary, reconnaissance level exploration was completed over 
the northern part of the property, and there is no record of diamond 
drilling occurred on the property. The best assay results, from grab 
samples taken at a few locations directly over the Ivakkak deposit, 
are 21 ppb Pt, 17 ppb Pd, 6 ppb Au, 885 ppm Ni and 342 ppm Cu 
(samples 73553 and 73551, GM-46933).

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Cape Smith Belt, in which the South Trend property and the Ivakkak deposit are located, is 
an interpreted foreland thrust-fold belt that constitutes the north eastern extension of the Trans-
Hudson Orogen, an early Proterozoic collisional zone, which separates the Archean Superior 
Province from the Proterozoic Churchill Province (Hynes and Francis, 1982; Hoffman 1990). 
The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba, and the New 
Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior Province. The Cape Smith 
(Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an east-west direction across the Ungava Peninsula 
of Nunavik. The greenschist facies foreland portion of the belt is divided into three structurally 
superimposed Proterozoic units, from south to north and oldest to youngest: Lamarche, 
Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups.  
 
The amphibolite grade hinterland is divided into four structurally superimposed Proterozoic units 
from south to north; Sparton, Parent, Perreault, and Watts Groups (Lamothe, 1994; St-Onge et 
al., 1992) The tectono-stratigraphic elements of the belt record a rifting event 2.0-1.9 billion 
years (Ga) ago, with accumulation of sedimentary and volcanic units (Povungnituk and Chukotat 
Groups) on a north-facing continental margin. Subsequent closing of the rift during the 
Hudsonian Orogeny (ca 1.8 Ga), resulted in a complex interaction of thrusting, penetrative 
shearing, metamorphism and imbrication of the foreland thrust belt with the tectono-stratigraphic 
units of the hinterland (Lamothe, 1994; Lucas and St.-Onge 1989; St-Onge and Lucas, 1990; St-
Onge et al., 1992). 
 
The Raglan South Nickel Project, of which the South Trend property is a component, is located 
within the central portion of the continental margin assemblage, and south of the suture 
separating the foreland from the hinterland domains (Figure 6.1). The North Domain is 
dominated by the mostly volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an island-arc 
accretionary complex. The South Domain includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat 
Groups, which are collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of 
basalts, sediments and ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The 
boundary between the North and South domains is marked by the regional scale Bergeron Fault, 
considered to be the surface expression of a subduction zone (Bergeron, 1957; Bergeron, 1959; 
Lamothe et al., 1983; Lamothe, 1986). The basin is interpreted to record a protracted regime of 
extension followed by sea-floor spreading and subsequent convergent tectonics marked by 
folding and thrusting. 
 
The Cape Smith Belt hosts two roughly parallel belts of intrusive ultramafic rocks, the Raglan 
Trend in the north and the South Raglan Trend in the south, some 15 to 20 kilometres apart. Both 
belts host a number of individual sulphide deposits developed in the ultramafic rocks that contain 
Ni, Cu, Co and PGE mineralization. While the general geology of the South Raglan Trend and 
Raglan Trend is similar with comparable sulphide mineral paragenesis and with similar sulphide 
textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The Raglan horizon displays a 3:1 ratio while the South 
Raglan Trend generally displays a ratio that is closer to parity. 
 
The South Raglan Trend includes a series of ultramafic units of varying thickness that were 
intruded into a variety of rock types, predominantly sulphide-bearing sediments, massive mafic  



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit     Page 14 of 115 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 15 of 115 

volcanic flows and gabbroic intrusions. The ultramafic flows or channels may contain massive 
sulphide lenses near their bottom that grade upwards into net-textured sulphides to be followed 
further upward by a wide halo of disseminated sulphides. The basal portions of the ultramafic 
bodies with their enclosed sulphides represent economic targets. 
 
Mineralization at Raglan is reported to occupy topographic lows which are believed to be 
thermal erosion channels (dykes). The sulphide bearing sediments in the footwall may have 
provided the sulphur necessary for the fixation of copper and nickel within the immiscible 
sulphide phase that was then available for gravity segregation and accumulation. Researchers 
have not reached a consensus on the significance of the sulphide-bearing sediments.  
 
6.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS 
 
The property is located in the Povungnituk group, just north of the contact with the Lamarche 
Group. The contact between the two groups is interpreted to be located along the Povungnituk 
River (southeast corner of property), which seems to be the site of major faulting. The major part 
of the property (Figure 6.2) is reported to be underlain by graphitic siltstones and mafic volcanic 
rocks. Many gabbroic and ultramafic sills are reported to occur within the property. 
 
One large northeast-southwest trending ultramafic body located in the central part of the property 
has been interpreted as a "central sill", with other smaller distal and proximal sills organized in a 
concentric fashion about the "central sill". This magmatic suite is dominantly peridotite with 
gabbroic margins.  
 
Silicified basalt underlies the northern portion of the property (Figure 6.3). Some of the basalt 
flows contain 10-20 % disseminated pyrrhotite, but without a significant nickel content. A 
peridotite sill within the basalt flows is host to the Ivakkak deposit. The sill has margins that vary 
from pyroxenite to gabbro.  
 
The southern part of the property is underlain by mixed sequence of argillaceous sediments and 
intercalated mafic volcanic rocks, which trend east and dip steeply north.  
 
The rocks of the property are subject to at least two known folding directions. An anticline with a 
north-northwest axis is superposed over an east-northeast folding pattern (Budkewitsch, in 
Lamothe 1986, however describes three deformation phases in the general area). Thrust faults 
are interpreted to occur in the north part of the property and along the Povungnituk River. A 
major fault trending northeast-southwest occurs immediately to the east of the Ivakkak deposit 
and appears to terminate the generally east-trending stratigraphy. East of the fault large 
ultramafic sills trending northeast dominate the stratigraphy.  
 
The southern part (about 40%) of the claim block has not covered by modern airborne 
geophysical surveys. However the historical (circa 1950-60) low resolution GSC magnetic 
survey (h = 300 metres) indicates a low and uniform magnetic field indicative of sedimentary 
rocks and gabbroic intrusions. 
 
The north part of the grid was covered in 1996 by a helicopter-borne survey (Aerodat) for 
Exploration Minière Ungava (GM-54366). The magnetic data shows three to four strong 
magnetic axes located approximately in the center of the property. The magnetic features trend 
east-west, and show a flexure conforming to the north-northwest anticline referred to above. 
These magnetic axes are regional in extent and correlate to ultramafic sills. Low conductance 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 16 of 115 

EM anomalies are located between the magnetic axes, this being interpreted as long syn-
formational graphitic sedimentary rock units intruded by the ultramafic sills. Two of these low 
conductance EM anomalies correlate with the location of the Ivakkak deposit.

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The mineral occurrences along the South Raglan Trend including the Ivakkak deposit as well as 
those of the Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits and are 
characterized by Lesher & Keays (2002) as "invasive lava channels" carrying mineralization that 
is characterized as follows: 

 The sulphides are typically, but not always concentrated at or near the bases of their 
ultramafic host rock units; 

 
 The sulphide textures vary from massive at the base to net-textured to disseminated 

peripheral to the massive portion; 
 

 Ore grades are "moderate to low", and there is a slight tendency of fractionation between 
nickel and copper; and 

 
 The time of sulphide deposition is early magmatic with sulphide segregation having taken 

place prior to or during emplacement of the host rock unit. 
 
The setting of these channels is variable and includes "cumulate lava channels, subvolcanic 
feeder sills, or magmatic conduits" that "occur in a wide range of volcanic and subvolcanic 
environments" (Lesher & Keays, 2002).  
 
A similar model for the Expo and Mesamax deposits, located along strike of the Ivakkak deposit 
to the northeast, has been proposed by Mungall & Keast, (2003) who describe the occurrences as 
"sharply discordant magmatic conduits" in which the "evolution of the sulfides is consistent with 
nearly complete equilibrium crystallization of monosulfide solid solution from sulfide magma". 
Monosulfide solid solution is a term describing the mineral containing Ni, Fe and S formed 
initially from a sulfide liquid at high temperatures. Pyrrhotite and pentlandite will later exsolve 
from monosulfide solid solution during cooling.

8.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
Exploration work to date by CRI and previous operators has established a channel-like or trough-
like, or dyke-like geometry of the ultramafic bodies on the South Raglan Trend, and the Expo 
peridotite is a good example of a series of trough-like geometry. With the exception of the Expo 
area, the ultramafic bodies are generally from 100 to 200 metres wide on surface, and extend 
laterally for several kilometres. These ultramafic bodies, some of which are open-ended sub-
vertical dykes are interpreted to be channel-flow units, which have thermally eroded into the 
underlying, overlying, and surrounding volcanic/sedimentary package. This is demonstrated by 
the observations that the ultramafic units clearly crosscut the volcanic/sedimentary package, that 
they have a thermal aureole, and display long, narrow sinuous dimensions. Others display more 
regular crosscutting dyke-like characteristics.  
 
The sulphide mineralization at Ivakkak appears to be hosted in a relatively narrow dyke of 
peridotite-pyroxenite-gabbro composition intruding mafic volcanic rocks and/or a mixed 
sequence of mafic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks. However the sulphides probably have 
the same genesis as other deposits in the Raglan South Trend. 
 
Massive, net-textured, and disseminated sulphides are associated with the ultramafic bodies. 
Massive sulphides are generally constituted of more than 90% sulphides; the net-textured type 
contains perhaps 25 to 75% sulphides while the disseminated mineralization contains traces to 
25% sulphides. The massive and net-textured types carry sufficiently high base and precious 
metal concentrations to be of economic interest. The net-textured and disseminated types of 
mineralization are generally of greater volume and extent than the massive sulphides, which 
accumulate at or near the bottom of the ultramafic bodies, or may be missing altogether. Massive 
sulphide bodies, the exploration targets of choice, are of relatively small size compared to their 
host ultramafic units, but do exhibit good geological and grade continuity. 
 
Petrographic work undertaken by Walker (2004a, 2004b) on the Expo and Mequillon deposits 
also describe the mineralogy of the Ivakkak deposit. Walker identified pyrrhotite (FeS) as the 
main sulphide mineral, followed by pentlandite ([Fe,Ni]S) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). 
Pentlandite occurs generally as a separate mineral and only rarely as exsolution lamellae in 
pyrrhotite. Pentlandite appears to be the main cobalt carrier. Niccolite (NiAs) and violarite (Ni, 
Fe)3S4 occur only rarely or are entirely absent. Intergrowth of both pentlandite and chalcopyrite 
with silicate minerals, particularly with serpentine, can be intricate. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a minor 
constituent of the rock, the result of the breakdown of the original olivine into serpentine plus 
magnetite. 
 
The results of detailed mineralogical work at the Mesamax deposit (Cabri, 2003) may be 
pertinent to Ivakkak. At Mesamax, accessory sulphides are galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), 
cubanite (CuFe2S3) and cobaltite (CoAsS). Cabri also reported a large number of platinum-group 
minerals (PGM's). He identified sudburyite (PdSb) and two new Pd-Sb minerals, Ungavite and 
Naldrettite as the principal palladium carriers in net-textured and massive sulphides, 
respectively, and PGE tellurides such as michenerite (PdBiTe), merenskyite (PdTe2), moncheite 
(PtTe2) and kotulskite (PdTe) as well as sperrylite (PtAs2). Electrum (a gold-silver alloy of 
varying composition) appears to be the main gold carrier. Comparable detailed mineralogical 
studies have yet to be completed on Expo samples.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
In 2005, an AeroTEM II geophysical survey was flown on behalf of CRI by AeroQuest Limited 
of Milton, Ontario. The survey totaled 4,376 line-kilometres over the entire South Raglan Trend 
property, including the Ivakkak deposit area. The AeroTEM II system is a time domain EM 
system in a "Coincident Loop" configuration that uses a triangular shape primary pulse that 
records the decaying secondary magnetic field both in the "OFF" and in the "ON" part of the 
cycle. The transmitter has a dipolar moment of approximately 40,000 Am2, at a frequency of 150 
Hz. The vertical and the horizontal (along track) components are read. The system also includes 
a magnetometer, GPS navigation, and a radar altimeter. The survey platform was an "A-Star" 
AS350B+ helicopter. The "bird" housing the survey equipment has a nominal ground clearance 
of 30 metres along north-south flight lines 100 metres apart resulting in a reading every 2-3 
metres in the horizontal direction.  
 
The Ivakkak deposit can be seen on at least 2 flight lines (in both the ON Time and OFF Time 
data). AeroQuest interpreted the conductance to be about 22 Siemens with a weak coincident 
magnetic high of about 250 nano tesla.  
 
Ground geophysical surveys include a Max-Min Mk II survey in a standard coplanar horizontal 
configuration and a 100 metre cable. Data was collected at three frequencies (440, 1760 and 
14080 Hz) at 25 metre intervals along lines 50 and 100 metres apart by TMC Geophysics 
personnel. A MAG survey over the same grid by the same contractor using a GSM-19 
magnetometer recorded data at 25 metre intervals. Diurnal drift was recorded by a base station 
located at the Kenty Lake camp and corrections were applied to the data set.  
 
A Crone TEM (time domain EM) survey was also conducted by TMC Geophysics in late 
August-early September. The survey technique employed a large fixed loop positioned south of 
the Ivakkak deposit with reading along at 25 metre intervals along the survey lines over the 
Ivakkak deposit.  
 
The Max-Min survey defined the Ivakkak deposit with a conductance of 6 to 48 Siemens over a 
200 m strike length, with a steep dip to the north and a plunge to the northwest. The MAG 
survey indicated a strong coincident positive response. The TEM survey indicates at least a 100 
metre extension to the west, and suggests an abrupt termination towards the east.  
 
The Ivakkak deposit was also identified as a surface showing while prospecting the 1996 
Dighem airborne geophysical survey. In 2003 two samples returned interesting values near the 
location of an AEM conductor. One sample returned 4.73% Cu and the other returned values of 
0.32 % Cu, 0.18 % Ni and 0.2 g/t Pd. In 2005, the area was geologically mapped by CRI staff 
(Bernard, 2005). The geological mapping and sampling indicates that disseminated sulphide-
bearing pyroxenite/gabbro float contain geochemically anomalous Ni, Cu and PGE values.  
 
Diamond drilling in 2005 was contracted to Major Group Drilling International Inc. using a JKS 
diamond drill The program consisted of thirty-two diamond drill holes (BQ size core) totaling 
3,527 metres were drilled between August 4 and September 29, 2005.  



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 22 of 115 

10.0 DRILLING 
 
Diamond drilling in 2006 was again contracted to Major Group Drilling International Inc. using 
a JKS diamond drill. Fifty-eight diamond drill holes (BQ size core) totaling 7,362 metres were 
drilled between July 9, 2006 and September 10, 2006 (Figure 10.1). The drill pattern included 
multiple holes with a variety of inclinations from the same drill set-up at approximately 25 metre 
intervals over a strike length of 450 metres with the deepest mineralized intersection at a vertical 
depth of 185 metres.  
 
Drill collars were positioned with reference to a 120° base line, and the collars were 
subsequently surveyed with high precision GPS instrumentation. Hot water was the main drilling 
fluid used to enable the relatively shallow drilling in the permafrost. Drill hole trajectories were 
monitored with a Reflex tool at approximately 50 metre intervals. 
 
Examination of multiple drill sections indicates that the relationship between the true thickness 
and the intersected width of the mineralization is variable, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, with an 
average of 0.7.  
 
The assay results of the core samples from all of the diamond drill holes is presented in Table 
10.1

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Sampling method and approach were essentially the same for the 2005 and 2006 programs at 
Ivakkak as they were for the 2003 and 2004 programs on the remainder of the Raglan South 
Nickel Project properties, and the procedures are summarized in the paragraphs that follow. 
 
All core logging and core splitting was completed in a core tent at the Mequillon camp to which 
the core boxes were transported by helicopter. The drill core was logged by CRI geologists and 
discussions and observations by the core loggers ensured consistent unit identification among 
them. The distance between the depth markers added by the drill personnel was measured to 
check for misplaced markers and for lost core. All logging information was recorded directly 
into laptop computers. Core intervals identified for sampling were marked with wax crayons, 
with sample tags placed at the start of a sample interval. Logging and sampling in 2005 and 2006 
was in the metric system. 
 
The sample length in obvious mineralization was generally one metre. Individual samples were 
not allowed to cross lithologic contacts or abrupt changes in mineralization. Core was split in 
half using a hydraulic core splitter. After splitting, core samples were immediately placed in 
plastic sample bags, tagged and recorded with unique sample numbers. Where possible, 
contiguous sample tag series were used. Sample intervals were recorded on sample ticket books, 
and later recorded on the computerized drill logs.  
 
There are no obvious drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability of 
the core samples. The even distribution of the sulphides in all types of mineralization ensures 
that the samples are of high quality and representative of the material or mineralization being 
sampled.

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
In 2005 and 2006, split core samples were collected and processed by personnel under contract 
to CRI and under the supervision of Todd Keast, project manager in 2004, Pat Pope, project 
manager in 2005 and Bertrand Brassard project manager for 2006. After splitting and bagging, 
the sealed individual samples were placed in shipping bags, which in turn were sealed with 
plastic tie straps. The bags remained sealed until they were opened by ALS Chemex personnel in 
Val-d'Or, Québec.  
 
All samples were initially stored in the field camp to await a scheduled flight. Samples were not 
secured in locked facilities as this precaution was deemed unnecessary due to the remote and 
isolated camp location. Samples were then shipped by helicopter to the Donaldson airport and 
loaded directly on a chartered aircraft for transport to Val-d'Or. Samples were collected at the 
airport by CRI personnel and delivered to the ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Val-
d'Or.  
 
The split drill core samples were crushed in their entirety to 90% passing 2 millimetres and the 
crusher was cleaned with barren rock between samples. From the coarse rejects a sub-sample of 
one kilogram was split and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns. The pulverizer was cleaned 
with silica sand between samples. 
 
From each pulp, a 100-gram sub-sample was split and shipped to the ALS Chemex laboratory in 
Vancouver, British Columbia for assay. The remainder of the pulp and the rejects are held at the 
preparation laboratory in Val-d'Or for future reference and are eventually returned to CRI. 
 
The base metals of economic interest (nickel, copper and cobalt), and elements of more general 
geochemical interest such as arsenic, chromium, iron, magnesium and sulphur, were determined 
using a 0.2-gram aliquot that was subjected to Geochemical Procedure ME-ICP81, (ALS 
Chemex internal code). This method uses a lithium meta-borate fusion to digest the sample, and 
is more appropriate for the concentrations encountered for the economic elements. 
 
The precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, were determined using Procedure PGM-
ICP27 (ALS Chemex internal code), a thirty-gram fire assay, again followed by ICP-AES, which 
is appropriate for higher grade rather than lower grade geochemical samples.  
 
The quality control program included the insertion of field duplicates, standards and blanks. 
Results of the QC program are discussed in Section 13.4 of this Technical Report. 
 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures were 
satisfactory.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
The Ivakkak deposit was visited by Mr. Gerald Harron, P.Eng. during the period August 9-23, 
2005, and August 17-31, 2006 when active exploration drilling was taking place. For this report, 
Mr. Harron examined four drill core holes from the Ivakkak deposit. Two P&E qualified 
persons, Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Tracy Armstrong, P.Geo., also visited the Ivakkak project 
site on August 18, 2006, examined two core drillholes and retrieved four representative 
verification core samples from those two holes. The other Raglan South Nickel Project properties 
were visited between August 17 to 20, 2006 with an independent sample verification program 
conducted on those properties at that time. An attempt was made to sample intervals from a 
variety of low and high-grade material for several deposits with an additional two samples taken 
from the Expo deposit, two from Mesamax, two from Mequillon and four from Tootoo. 
 
The chosen sample intervals were then sampled by taking quarter splits of the remaining half-
split core. The samples were then documented, bagged, and sealed with packing tape and were 
taken by E. Puritch to the SGS Lab in Toronto, Ontario for analysis. 
 
At no time, prior to the time of sampling, were any employees or other associates of Canadian 
Royalties advised as to the location or identification of any of the samples to be collected.  
 
A comparison of the P&E independent sample verification results versus the original assay 
results for Ni, Cu and combined PGE (Au, Pt and Pd) can be seen in Figures 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3. 
The P&E results demonstrate that the results obtained and reported by CRI were reproducible.

13.2 CORE RECOVERY 
 
The core recovery of the Ivakkak drill holes in 2005 and 2006 was very high. Given the overall 
excellent recoveries and the even distribution of the minerals of potential economic interest in 
the core, there is no reason to believe that core recovery has in any way influenced the reliability 
of the assay database for the Ivakkak deposit.  
 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 32 of 115 

13.3 DATABASE VERIFICATION  
 
The Ivakkak assay database is assembled and kept by CRI personnel in Val-d'Or, who are also 
responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the assay results with respect to the laboratory performance 
on standards and blanks. Drill core logging was done directly into a Gemcom logging software Access 
database and subsequently uploaded to a master Gemcom Access logging database in the CRI Val-d'Or 
office. 
 
Assay data are received electronically and imported into the spreadsheet without the need for 
manual manipulation. Sample numbers and intervals are checked against the data recorded in the 
drill hole logs. Routine searches are made for overlapping or missing assay intervals. Unsampled 
intervals have no entry. Results below detection limit were assigned one half of the detection 
limit value.  
 
After December 31, 2004, all projects in the South Raglan group of properties were regrouped 
into one large drill hole database called Ungava_Master. Individual projects Mesamax, 
Mequillon, Expo, Ivakkak and other smaller projects in the area were relocated in a General 
UTM grid instead of a variety of local grids. 
 
Special attention was focused on the location and re-surveying of previous holes, and in 
particular: 

• Geologists spent time in October and November 2006 verifying the location of the holes 
on section and in relation to the old grid;  

• Discrepancies were corrected and documented by L. Cloutier, acting database manager 
for CRI; 

• When building the Ungava_Master database, the former database manager re-imported 
all assay data directly from the lab certificates, eliminating errors caused by Cut & Paste 
techniques; 

• Minor manipulation was required to transform ppm to percent for certain elements like 
Co and Cr; 

• Validation tests were conducted on all data from the database, comparing maximum and 
minimum values; 

• Small discrepancies in hole survey data were noted and corrected; 
• Un-surveyed holes from the end of 2006 were located according to the local grid; NB: 

None of the un-surveyed holes was used in the 2006 Resources; 
• Verification was done on all previous assay data by comparing the previous databases 

(Mesamax, Expo, Mequillon and Ivakkak) with the Ungava_Master; 
• Discrepancies were noted and each one was verified with the source and corrected 

accordingly; 
• Verification was done on all 2005 and 2006 assay results by importing original lab 

certificates into the database. Checks done comparing both datasets confirmed the 
integrity of the Ungava_Master assay database. 

 
13.4 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
A thorough QA/QC program was instituted in 2002 and 2003 using property standards created 
from a large volume of drill core samples from the Mesamax deposit. Two different reference 
materials were made: Net Textured (CR-CS02-NT and CR-CS03-NTv2) and Massive Sulphide 
(CR-CS01-MS). Initial round robin characterization of the material was done by three different 
labs.  



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 33 of 115 

 
During the next three years, (2004, 2005 and 2006) both the net textured and massive sulphide 
standards were used systematically. Results for the net textured reference material were 
acceptable however the massive sulphide standard often demonstrated a low bias in relation to 
the characterization round robin.  
 
In 2005, H. Thalenhorst of Strathcona Minerals was asked to review the data and control charts 
for the 2004 and 2005 data. A recalibration of the massive sulphide standard was done at that 
time. 
 
In 2006, the results from the CR-CS01-MS standard were showing in excess of a 45% failure 
rate, which is defined as > ± 3 standard deviations from the mean.  
 
It was decided to re-calibrate the mean and standard deviation for the massive sulphide reference 
material. The reasoning behind doing this is summed up in the following communication with 
Valerie Murphy, B.Sc., C. Chem., SGS Minerals Services - Quality Control Coordinator. 
 
"It is far more acceptable to calculate the mean and standard deviation with a large data pool 
over a long time period (even from a single lab) than to use data gathered in a characterization 
study that only involves a few laboratories. This is not just a more acceptable and rugged 
practice for characterization studies but even for certified reference materials as certificate 
values may be skewed and limited. Typically, a lab will generate large amounts of data that 
involves different operators, different days, different environmental conditions etc. to capture the 
true uncertainty of the material and hence the necessary criteria to set appropriate acceptance 
criteria." 
 
The mean and standard deviation were re-calculated using standard procedures of trimming 
values >2 standard deviations prior to determining the final value of these parameters.  
 
Once the massive sulphide reference material was re-calibrated taking into account three years of 
assays, the ALS Chemex results fell within the acceptable parameters supported by the fact that 
their internal QAQC showed no failures.  
 
The low bias concerning CR-CS01-MS happened on September 29, 2006 with one failure and 2 
values between 2 and 3 standard deviations. The failed batch was re-assayed and all samples 
came back with values identical to the first assay, apart from the Reference Material CR-CS01-
MS.  
 
This only true failure, (September 29) appears to illustrate a problem with the specific standard 
sachet added to the batch. Apart from this particular case, the CR-CS01-MS behaves within the 
acceptable parameters.  
 
It was also decided to confirm the quality and the reliability of the Reference Material CR-CS01-
MS and three different labs were selected for a new round robin. 
 
Results of the new round robin indicated that values for copper were confirmed with a total 
average of the three labs close to the mean that was calculated from three years of repeated 
assaying. Nickel values were represented by a higher mean. 
All blank samples returned values at or below detection limit, apart from minor isolated cases. In 
these cases the batches were re-analyzed and results were satisfactory. 
 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 34 of 115 

In addition to the QC samples inserted in the field by Canadian Royalties, ALS Chemex 
prepared and analyzed their own lab duplicates and inserted their own internal reference 
standards and blanks. A complete set of the ALS Chemex lab QC data files was obtained and 
verified by the author responsible for this section. There were no abnormalities detected in either 
the procedures or the results.

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The reader is cautioned that the qualified person preparing this technical report has been unable 
to verify the information concerning adjacent properties and it is emphasized that the information 
in this section is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property that is the 
subject of this technical report. 
 
Mineralization at the nearby Raglan mining complex, operated by Xstrata Nickel, is associated 
with nine separate peridotite flows, which make up an overall ultramafic body, that has been 
identified along a distance of 55 km. Deposits along this ultramafic body include from east to 
west the Donaldson, Boundary, West Boundary, 13-14, 5-8, Katiniq, East Lake, 2-3 Zone and 
Cross Lake deposits. The thickness of the sulphide lenses varies from a few metres to a few tens 
of metres, and the strike length can vary from tens of metres to 200 metres. Production began in 
April 1998 at Katiniq, which consists of over 20 discrete lenses of massive and disseminated 
sulphide, which vary in size from 10 000 tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes (Falconbridge Limited, 
Website May 2003). The lenses extend along an ultramafic horizon 1400 metres in strike length, 
which dips to the northwest at 45° to 50°. The mineralized horizon has been traced to a depth of 
350 metres and is open in that direction. Mining reserves for the Falconbridge property currently 
stand at 8.3 million tonnes grading 2.9% Ni and 0.8% Cu in the proven category, and 9.4 million 
tonnes grading 2.9% Ni and 0.8% Cu in the probable category (Falconbridge Annual Report 
2003). 
 
Two mineral deposits have historically been known on the South Raglan Trend. The Delta 
deposit in which Xstrata Nickel (Falconbridge) owns 51%, Oasis Diamond Exploration Inc. 34% 
and Melkior Resources Inc. (Melkior) 15%, is reported to have a non 43-101 compliant "mineral 
inventory" of 0.8 million tonnes at 3.1% nickel, 1.1% copper, 1.0 g/t platinum, 1.6 g/t palladium 
and 0.2 g/t gold as determined by Falconbridge (Melkior Annual Report 2002). The Expo deposit 
located 40 kilometres east-northeast of Ivakkak hosts an NI 43-101 compliant resource of 9.0 
million tonnes at 0.77% Nickel, 0.76% copper, 0.1g/t gold, 0.3 g/t Platinum and 1.4 g/t 
palladium estimated by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. in December, 2006.

15.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
The sulphide mineralization at Ivakkak is hosted in a relatively narrow dyke of peridotite-
pyroxenite-gabbro composition intruding mafic volcanic rocks and/or a mixed sequence of mafic 
volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The mineralization consists of massive, net-textured and 
disseminated sulphides.  
 
There has been recent initial metallurgical test work conducted by SGS on the Ivakkak deposit 
with final results to be issued on or after March 23, 2007. Preliminary indications are that a 
copper concentrate with 30% Cu and 95% recovery and a nickel concentrate with 14% Ni and 
75% recovery are attainable for processing the Ivakkak deposit mineralized material.

16.0 MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Ivakkak deposit Resources in compliance 
with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, 
P.Eng. of P & E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario along with the assistance of 
Gerald Harron, P.Eng., of G. A. Harron & Associates Inc. The effective date of this resource 
estimate is December 31, 2006. 
 
16.2 DATABASE 
 
All drilling data was provided by Canadian Royalties Inc. (The Client) in the form of their 
Microsoft Access Ungava Master database, Excel files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Twenty 
two (22) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid looking northwest on an azimuth of 
3000 on a nominal 25 metre spacing named from 150-W to 375-E.  A Gemcom database was 
provided by the client containing 90 diamond drill holes of which 80 were utilized in the 
resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource 
estimate.  A surface drillhole plan is shown in Appendix I. 
 
The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the 
database contained 1,888 assays for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd.  All data are expressed in metric 
units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system. 
 
16.3 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,888 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt 
and Pd.  A few very minor data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 1,888 verified 
intervals were checked against assay lab certificates from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C. The 
checked assays represented 100% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and 
approximately 100% of the entire database.  
 
16.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION 
 
Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary 
interpretation from visual inspection of drill hole sections.  Two domains were developed named 
Massive Sulphide and Net Textured.  These domains were physically created with computer 
screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report.  The outlines 
were influenced by the selection of mineralized material that demonstrated massive and net 
textured characteristics, and zonal continuity along strike and down dip.  In a very few cases, 
some mineralization below characteristic massive or net textured grades was included for the 
purpose of maintaining zonal continuity. Smoothing was utilized to remove obvious jogs and 
dips in the domains and incorporated a minor addition of inferred mineralization. This exercise 
allowed for easier domain creation without triangulation errors from solids validation. 
 
On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but not 
extended more than 12 to 15 metres into untested territory.  Minimum constrained true width for 
interpretation was 1.0 metre. The interpreted polylines from each section were "wireframed" in 
Gemcom into 3-dimensional domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical 
analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.  See Appendix II. 
 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 38 of 115 

16.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION 
 
The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the mineralized domain solids.  
The list of rock codes used follows: 
 
Rock Code Description  
 0 Air  
10 Massive Sulphide Domain  
20 Net Textured Sulphide Domain 
30 Ultramafic Rocks  
99 Waste Rock 
 
16.6 COMPOSITES  
 
Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints 
of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and 
Pd over 2.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and 
hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint.  The compositing process was halted upon exit from 
the footwall of the aforementioned constraint.  Un-assayed intervals were treated as null data. 
Any composites calculated that were less than 0.5m in length, were discarded so as to not 
introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were transferred to 
Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files. 
 
16.7 GRADE CAPPING 
 
Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that 
the possible influence of erratic high values did not bias the database.  Extraction files were 
created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From 
these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated. Refer to Appendix III for graphs.

16.8 VARIOGRAPHY  
 
Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the two domains 
in the deposit model. The mineralized domains exhibited good sectional continuity but due to 



Canadian Royalties Inc., Ivakkak Deposit  Page 39 of 115 

low population densities did not yield discernable variograms. Additional future drilling may 
enhance variography for this deposit. 
 
16.9 BULK DENSITY 
 
The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of bulk density test 
work performed by ALS Chemex on thirty-two massive sulphide and thirty-eight net textured 
sulphide representative samples obtained by the client from drill core.  The resulting average bulk 
density model created from these samples was calculated to be 4.37 tonnes per cubic meter for the 
massive sulphide domain and 3.22 tonnes per cubic metre in the net textured domain.  
 
16.10 BLOCK MODELING 
 
The resource model was divided into a 3D block model framework. The block model has 548,100 
blocks that were 5m in the X direction, 5m in the Y direction and 5m in the Z direction.  There 
were 100 columns (X), 160 rows (Y) and 40 levels. The block model was rotated 30 degrees 
clockwise.  Separate block models were created for rock type, density, percent, Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt 
and Pd.  
 
The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage 
that was occupied by each block inside each constraining domain.  As a result, the domain 
boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable 
inclusion percentages within a particular domain. 
 
The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database 
composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) 
grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain 
for each element for the indicated and inferred classifications. The resulting Ni, Cu, and NSR 
blocks can be seen on the block model cross-sections and plans in Appendix IV and V.  The 
grade blocks within all domains were interpolated using the following parameters:

16.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined 
from the Ni interpolations for indicated and inferred due to Ni being the dominant revenue 
producing element in the NSR calculation. See block model classification cross-sections and 
plans in Appendix VI and VII.  
 
16.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and 
reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable areas.  The following

calculations demonstrate the rationale supporting the NSR cut-off grade that determines the 
potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

The above data were derived from the July 2006 Preliminary Economic Analysis on the Ivakkak 
deposit.  
 
In the anticipated open pit operation, Mill Processing and G&A costs combine for a total of 
($25.00 + $15.00) = $40.00/tonne milled which became the internal NSR cut-off value.  
 
In order for the constrained mineralization in the Ivakkak model to be considered as a resource 
which is potentially economic, a first pass Whittle 4X pit optimization was carried out utilizing 
the following criteria:

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of 
mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, 
marketing, or other relevant issues.  

(2) The quantity and grade reported in this inferred resource estimation are conceptual in nature and there has 
been insufficient exploration to define an indicated mineral resource on the property and it is uncertain if 
further exploration will result in discovery of an indicated or measured mineral resource on the property 

 
It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005. 
 
16.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE 
 
As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut 
off grade with blocks in all classifications summed and their grades weight averaged. This 
average is the average grade of all blocks within the mineralized domains. The values of the 
interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average 
grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are 
presented below.

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
There is to the author's knowledge no additional data or information, of either a positive or negative 
aspect, that would change the data presented or the derived recommended program.

18.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Exploration activities on the South Trend property were successful in discovering the Ivakkak 
deposit of Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralization. The massive and net-textured sulphide 
mineralization is hosted in a peridotite sill intruded into a mixed sequence of basalt and 
argillaceous sediments. Diamond drilling has defined the zone over a 450 metre strike length, 
with the deepest intersection at 185 metres vertical. The arcuate shaped variably north-dipping 
sheet of sulphide mineralization exhibits good geological and grade continuity using drill 
sections 25 metres apart.  
 
Diamond drill information indicates that the mineralization continues beyond the current drill 
pattern and offers the opportunity to expand the estimated resources in both vertical and lateral 
dimensions. The TEM geophysical survey also indicates at least a 100 metre extension of the 
sulphides to the west of the drilled area, within favourable geology. Geological data indicates a 
fault termination of the sulphide zone at the eastern end of the drilled area. Further exploration 
may define a severed portion of the Ivakkak deposit.

19.0 RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSED BUDGET 
 
It is the opinion of the authors of this report that exploration results to date indicate the property 
is of sufficient merit as to warrant continued exploration. 
 
A recommended Phase I program will focus on additional drilling in 2007 to expand the known 
resource. It is recommended that 1,675 metres of diamond drilling be allocated to drilling the 
Ivakkak deposit in order to upgrade inferred resources to indicated and extend down dip and 
down plunge mineralization. Appendix I shows a surface plan indicating the location of the 
proposed drill holes. The following proposed budget is designed to support the Phase I work 
program: 
 
Table 19.1: Proposed 2007 Phase I Budget  
 
Program Program Costs CDN$ 
1,675 m drilling $170,000 
Sampling, QA/QC   $30,000 
Camp Costs $75,000 
Helicopter Support $125,000 
Administration $75,000 
TOTAL $475,000 

 
A Phase II program is recommended for 2007 to support the preparation of a feasibility study to 
assess the economic potential of the Ivakkak deposit. A limited amount of diamond drilling is 
also included in this budget to allow for any additional in-fill drilling required for geotechnical 
and engineering purposes. The following proposed budget is designed to support the Phase II 
work program: 
 
Table 19.2: Proposed 2007 Phase II Budget  
 
Program Program Costs CDN$ 
1,500 m drilling   $150,000 
Sampling, QA/QC   $25,000 
Camp Costs   $75,000 
Helicopter Support  $125,000 
Administration  $75,000 
TOTAL $450,000
