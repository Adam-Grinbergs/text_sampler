2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 1  

1.0 SUMMARY 
 
The Golden Eagle Property is located in the northern Coast Mountains of northwestern British 
Columbia, just south of the Yukon-British Columbia border. The Property is centred 70 km west-
northwest of Atlin, British Columbia or 30 km south of Carcross, Yukon.  The project is divided 
into three property areas: The Bennett Lake Block, the Tannis Block (Middle Ridge) and the 
Golden Eagle Block.  
 
This area has a long history of mineral exploration, dating back to the Klondike Gold Rush, 
when gold seekers came through the Bennett Lake valley on their way to the Klondike.  Some 
old, undocumented adits on the Tannis Property may date back to this time.  The majority of 
modern exploration in the area was conducted in the later part of the 1980's and early to mid 
1990's when major companies such as Dupont, Noranda and Westmin conducted regional and 
property scale exploration in the district.  This work identified base and precious metal 
mineralization in a variety of geological settings and deposit model types over large area 
measuring at least 14 by 18 km.  The mineralization occurs as skarn-type mineralization in 
Devonian to Triassic meta-volcanic rocks bordering Cretaceous intrusions; as gold-bearing 
arsenopyrite-quartz veins in rhyolitic intrusions and adjacent host rocks; as disseminated copper-
gold mineralization in Cretaceous intrusions; and as feeder zone mineralization in a possible 
volcanogenic massive sulphide setting.  
 
In 2006, Aurora Geosciences Ltd, of Whitehorse was retained by the property owner, Troymet 
Exploration Corp. (then Signet Minerals Inc.) to conduct a geological mapping, sampling 
program, and to manage and execute a diamond drilling program on the property.  The program 
involved the establishment of an ATV access trail on Middle Ridge, the construction of a camp 
for the drilling program, preparation of drill pads, logging and sampling of the drill core. 
 
The drill program started late in the season due to the limited availability of diamond drills and 
was hampered by the onset of winter conditions.  However, the geological mapping, sampling 
and drilling in the Middle Ridge area confirmed the presence of high-grade gold mineralization 
in quartz-arsenopyrite.  Many drill targets remain to be tested there. 
 
Recommendations for future work on the project are: to conduct property scale geological 
mapping and detailed geological mapping of the showing areas; to evaluate the numerous 
magnetic anomalies and electromagnetic conductors throughout the property; to conduct further 
prospecting and sampling; and a program consisting of 3,000 m of diamond drilling distributed 
between Middle Ridge, the Bennett Lake Block and the Golden Eagle Block.  The budget for this 
program is estimated at $750,000.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Troymet Exploration Corp. (then Signet Minerals Inc.) contracted Aurora Geosciences Ltd to 
conduct a mineral exploration program on the Golden Eagle Property located on NTS map sheet 
104M/15 in northwestern British Columbia during the summer and fall of 2006.  The project area 
measures approximately 16 by 17 km. 
 
The exploration program consisted of construction of an ATV trail, detailed geological mapping, 
rock sampling, and diamond drilling.  The program was conducted in stages, with the ATV trail 
construction commencing on May 25, followed by the geological mapping and sampling and 
drill pad construction in June through early July.  The diamond drilling commenced on 
September 6 and was completed on November 30.  Caron Diamond Drilling Ltd of Whitehorse 
Yukon was the diamond drill contractor.  
 
This report includes a review of historical exploration work conducted in the area by previous 
operators and by Troymet Exploration (then Signet Minerals) and is based on published 
geological and geochemical studies in the public domain; on confidential reports prepared for 
Troymet Exploration (then Signet Minerals) and on private company reports and assessment 
reports prepared for previous claim holders in the area.  
 
The author, a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101, managed the field exploration 
program on the property in 2006. 
 
 
3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The historical data referenced in the preparation of this report was compiled by geologists and 
geophysicists that were employed directly by Noranda Exploration Company Limited, Lodestar 
Explorations Ltd, Westmin Resources Limited and Frame Mining Corporation and by outside 
contractors such as Beacon Hill Consultants Ltd, Pacific Geological Services and Minorex 
Consulting Ltd. The majority of these geoscientists would be classified as "qualified persons" 
today, although that designation did not exist when most of the historic work was done. . The 
author assumes no responsibility for the interpretations and inferences made by these individuals 
prior to the inception of the "qualified person" designation. 
 
 
4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Golden Eagle Project is located in the northern Coast Mountains of northwestern British 
Columbia, just south of the Yukon-BC border.  The property is centred 70 km west northwest of

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
The project area straddles the South Klondike Highway that runs from Carcross, Yukon to the 
port city of Skagway, Alaska.  The highway is paved and maintained year-round.  Gravel bush 
roads extend from the South Klondike Highway to provide access to the northern part of the 
Tannis claim block, along Paddy Pass, and to the northern part of the Bennett Lake claim block.  
The Golden Eagle Block has no road access at this time.  Helicopter support was provided from 
operations based in Atlin, B.C., 70 km to the east, and Whitehorse, Y.T., 90 km to the north. 
 
For the 2006 program a tent camp was established midway up the Bennett Plateau 4x4 road. 
Access to Middle Ridge was provided by a newly established ATV trail located on the east side 
of the ridge.  Access to the Skarn Zone and Plateau area was provide by the Plateau access road, 
and access to the Carbonate Zone and Camp Zone was provided by helicopter.  Drill moves in 
the Middle Ridge and Carbonate Zones were by helicopter and moves in the Skarn Zone and 
Plateau Zone were by bulldozer.  
 
The project area is within the Coast Mountains of British Columbia.  The topography in the area 
is mountainous and can be extremely rugged and precipitous at higher elevations.  Elevations 
range from about 1000 m above sea level (ASL) at Tutshi Lake to 2040 m ASL.  At lower 
elevations, balsam and lodge pole pine trees dominate the vegetation with willow and alder 
occurring in drainages and avalanche chutes.  The alpine areas have scrub balsam, heather and 
alpine flora. 
 
The area is affected by weather from the coast and receives abundant rain and snow.  Snow 
generally begins accumulating in the alpine areas in mid September and begins receding in late 
April to early May. The snow is generally melted back sufficiently by mid to late May to allow 
for fieldwork at lower elevations. 
 
The land in which the mineral claims are situated is Crown Land and falls under the jurisdiction 
of the Government of British Columbia. Surface rights would have to be obtained from the 
Government if the property were to go into development. 
 
Power is not available in the project area. The nearest source of power is in Carcross, 30 km 
north by road. Carcross is connected to the Whitehorse hydroelectric grid. At this time, the 
Whitehorse grid has plenty of excess power and the ability to readily increase its output to supply 
a large mining complex. Water resources are abundant in the project area in flowing streams and 
numerous large lakes. 
 
The nearest major city centre is Whitehorse, 110 km by road north of the project area. 
Whitehorse is a supply centre for this northern region and has an ample labour force. Due to 
historic mining activity in the area, an experienced work force, including mining personnel are 
available in Yukon and in Atlin. 
 
The author did not see any topographic or physiographic impediments for a potential mine, mill, 
heap leach or waste disposal sites. Suitable lands occur throughout the project area that should 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 8  

allow development of such facilities. However, there are certain areas of steep terrain in which 
such facilities could not be located. Environmental concerns and land claims issues with local 
First Nations are issues that Troymet will have to address from time-to-time as the project 
advances. 
 
 
6.0 HISTORY 
 
The mineral exploration history of the area dates back to 1890's, when prospectors traveling over 
the Chilkoot trail and across Bennett Lake to the Klondike goldfields first started exploring the 
area.  The first recorded discovery in the area was in 1901 with the discovery of the Venus vein 
system by J. M. Pooley on Montana Mountain, 15 km north of the property.  Four adits on 
Middle Ridge on the Tannis Block and three adits on the north side of the Bennett Lake Plateau 
appear to be from about the same time, although no documentation on their age or discoverer 
could be found.  The first recorded production in the area came from the Engineer Gold Mine at 
Taku Arm on Tagish Lake. No further work is reported until 1981, when modern exploration 
programs were documented in the area.  
 
In the Bennett Lake area, numerous old trenches and adits attest to a past exploration history, 
although none of this work was documented in assessment records or Ministry of Mines Reports. 
 
During 1982 and 1983, DuPont of Canada explored the GAUG claims, which covered the 
Plateau Zone (Rowins, 1996). Geological and geochemical surveys were conducted on portions 
of the upland plateau and a steep westerly-trending gully where three old adits are located. 
DuPont outlined high precious and base metal geochemical anomalies in the gully and on the 
surrounding upland plateau. Despite, these findings, Dupont ceased exploration in the region 
after the 1983 season and the claims were allowed to lapse in 1986.  
 
In 1983, Texaco Canada Resources Ltd. staked the BEN 1 to BEN 4 mineral claims in the Skarn 
Zone area. This staking was undertaken to protect gold and silver occurrences discovered by 
prospecting in 1982. Texaco's exploration program included prospecting, geologic mapping, 
geochemical sampling, geophysical surveying, and trenching. 
 
In 1986 and 1987, Messrs. G. Harris and G. Davidson staked the LQ and Pavey claims to cover 
the area previously staked as the GAUG claims.  Shortly after, Lodestar Explorations Inc. 
optioned this claim group and began prospecting, reconnaissance mapping, trenching, and 
sampling. This work identified the Ben Fault and LQ vein zones and recommended future 
trenching and diamond drilling on these targets.  In 1988, Lodestar added the WILLARD claim 
and optioned the adjoining BEN claims from Texaco.  However, no exploration was conducted 
that year. 
 
In 1990, Lodestar embarked on an extensive exploration program that tested a number of the 
prospective showings and discovered two new gold occurrences at the Skarn Zone and the 
Cowboy Zone.  The program included prospecting, lithogeochemical sampling, road building, 
trenching, and diamond drilling.  Their drill results included 3.43 g/mT gold over 8.0 m in hole 
90-08 and 14.64 g/mT gold over 1.0 m in hole 90-03.

Hemlo Gold Mines Inc. acquired an option on Lodestar's claim group (collectively known as the 
Pavey property) in 1993, and conducted limited prospecting in 1993 and 1994, with Noranda 
Exploration Company Limited acting as the operator on behalf of Hemlo.  In 1993, Lodestar 
Explorations Inc. changed its name to Precision International Resources.  In 1995, the PAVEY 
claims were allowed to lapse and in 1996, the BEN claims were allowed to lapse. 
 
In November and December 1995, and in July, 1996 Westmin Resources Limited re-staked the 
area as the LEW and LQ claims.  In 1996, Westmin conducted a program of geological mapping, 
lithogeochemical sampling, geophysical surveying and percussion drilling.  Their work focused 
on the Skarn Zone and on the Bennett Grid IP anomaly.  In 1997, Westmin conducted a program 
of diamond drilling on the Skarn Zone and Bennett Grid.  The drilling at the Bennett grid (1 hole, 
141.7 m) found the IP chargeability to be caused by graphitic sediments with anomalous, but low 
gold values (i.e. < 0.36 g/mT Au).  The drilling on the Skarn Zone intersected numerous quartz-
calcite-arsenopyrite veins with the best result being 10.08 g/mT gold over a 2.0-m-width (drill 
width).  No further work was done on the property.  
 
The Middle Ridge area was first mapped in 1957 by R.L. Christie of the Geological Survey of 
Canada.  In 1987, the BC Geological survey conducted a program of reconnaissance stream 
sediment and lithogeochemical sampling in the region and found the creek draining Paddy Pass 
and its most easterly, south tributary to be anomalous in gold, arsenic and antimony.  In 1988, 
Mihalynuk, Rouse, Moore and Friz from the BC Geological Survey re-mapped the area in 
greater detail. 
 
In the 1970's the north side of Paddy Pass was staked as the "Linda" claims then later the 
"Friendship Silver" claims and explored for molybdenum and copper (Morris, 1988).  The B.C. 
mineral inventory lists "Linda" as a molybdenite occurrence. 
 
In 1986, H. Copeland of Whitehorse staked the Catfish claims on the north side of Paddy Pass 
and conducted a program of geological mapping, sampling and prospecting.  This work 
identified two separate quartz vein trends, one striking west-northwest; the other northeast.  The 
west-northwest trend is generally barren and less than 50 cm wide.  The northeast trending veins 
are coarse-grained, milky white, comb-structured, vuggy with moderate to intense limonite and 
jarosite coatings.  A sample from a 15 m long adit driven on one of these veins returned 21.27 
g/mT gold (0.68 oz/ton) and 134.2 g/mT silver (4.29 oz/ton) but the nature of the sample was not 
mentioned. 
 
Copeland also found numerous pieces of mineralized float on the property, including malachite-
stained quartz containing up to 2% galena that assayed up to 148.3 g/mT silver (4.74 oz/ton), but 
he was not able to determine the source.  He was able to locate stibnite-galena mineralized quartz 
veins that were found to occur crosscutting rhyolite dykes.  One float sample of this material 
returned 3,800 ppb gold and 100.4 ppm silver.  He also discovered a silicified volcanic boulder 
in a creek bed that contained lenses and blebs of pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and galena 
comprising 20% of the rock.  Zinc values from this sample ran 47,766 ppm.  Coarse molybdenite 
was observed on fracture surfaces on a granite outcrop in one location.  
 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 10  

The Catfish Property was subsequently sold or optioned to Frame Mining Ltd.  In 1988, Frame 
contracted Beacon Hill Consultants Ltd to conduct an exploration program consisting of 
geological mapping, soil sampling, stream sediment sampling and rock sampling (Morris, 1988). 
 
Beacon Hill recorded four styles of mineralization on the property: molybdenum in quartz veins; 
a bleached, pyritic shear zone; an antimony-rich volcanic tuff horizon; and arsenopyrite-rich 
quartz veins.  The molybdenite in quartz veins was observed on the North Mountain, west of an 
old adit.  The bleached, pyritic shear zone occurs in a drainage on the east side of North 
Mountain.  The area is described as a large pyritic gossan, but no other mineralization was 
observed.  The antimony-rich tuff horizon occurs in the Lower to Middle Jurassic volcanics 
along the western part of the property. 
 
Arsenopyrite-rich quartz veins occur on North Mountain, Middle Ridge and South Mountain.  
The veins on the North Mountain are those described by Copeland in 1986.  On South Mountain, 
the mineralized veins are up to 0.6 m wide and are confined to a fine-grained rhyolite host. 
 
The arsenopyrite-rich quartz veins on Middle Ridge are up to 3.1 m wide and occur in a rhyolitic 
dyke that cuts Boundary Range Metamorphic rocks.  An anomalous gold trend was traced for 
over 2.5 km by soil and stream sediment anomalies with values as high as 47,325 ppb.  Soil 
samples yielded up to 24,220 ppb gold (0.71 oz/t) and up to 20,425 ppm arsenic.  Beacon Hill 
recommended an extensive program of mapping, soil sampling, trenching and diamond drilling. 
 
In 1989, Frame Mining conducted a more extensive program consisting of geological mapping, 
rock and soil sampling, petrographic work, 3.1 km of roadwork, blasting and hand trenching (8 
trenches), 10 km of line cutting and 10 km of Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical surveying.  
Frame collected 447 rock samples, 143 soil samples and 20 petrographic samples. 
 
The trenching program focused on the north side of Middle Ridge.  Highlights of the program 
include 1.00 g/mT Au and 15 g/mT Ag over 9.0 m in Trench 4; 1.34 g/mT Au and 25.0 g/mT Ag 
over 9.7 m in Trench 6; 1.17 g/mT Au over 6.0 m in Trench 7; and 2.05 g/mT Au and 141.1 
g/mT Ag over 6.0 m in Trench 8.  
 
Following the 1989 exploration program, Frame did not conduct any further exploration on the 
property and it was later allowed to lapse. 
 
The Tannis 1 to 4 claims were staked in September 2001, the Tannis 5 to 7 in April 2002, the and 
the Tannis 8, 9 and 11 in August 2002 by R.H. McMillan.  In October 2001, Marksmen 
Resources Ltd optioned the Tannis claims from R. H. McMillan and in 2002 Marksmen 
conducted an exploration program consisting of geological mapping, rock sampling and IP 
geophysical surveying on Middle Ridge.  In the spring and summer of 2004, Marksmen added 
the Tannis 12 and 13 and the Lake claim as well as the Connor 2 to 6 claims on the Golden Eagle 
Block.  
 
The first documented work on the Golden Eagle portion of the property, southeast of Tutshi Lake 
was in 1906, when Joe Bussinger staked the Great Northern claim group and discovered what is 
now known as the Jessie Showing.  Exploration of the showing was limited to hand and blast

trenching and was not reported until 1929, when a group of engineers from Timmins, Ontario 
expressed an interest in the property.  Average assays of the "ore" zone were reported to be 4.69 
g/mT gold (0.15 oz/ton), 738.3 g/mT silver (23.6 oz/ton) and 4.9% copper across a 6-foot wide 
shear zone in andesite. 
 
In 1981, Dupont and Kennco staked the area between Tutshi Lake and Moon Lake based on 
encouraging results from a regional geochemical survey in the area.  During the field season a 
program of geological mapping, soil, silt and rock sampling was conducted, however the work 
was not recorded for assessment purposes.  The claims were allowed to lapse in 1982. 
 
In 1985, Noranda Exploration Company Ltd initiated a regional exploration program in the area 
aimed at evaluating the Triassic volcanic rocks for their potential to host volcanogenic massive 
sulphide mineralization.  The program involved mapping with lithogeochemical sampling and 
prospecting.  During the program pods and lenses of massive pyrrhotite were found in a 
sequence of chert-shale and tuff in Moon Creek.  The sulphides returned values up to 130 ppb 
gold.  Noranda later staked the TUT 1 to 3 claims. 
 
In 1986, Noranda conducted exploration programs on the "Po" showing and the "Carbonate 
Zone" as well as regional silt sampling and prospecting in the surrounding area.  This work 
returned gold values up to 450 ppb from carbonate-altered volcanic float and up to 6,000 ppm 
copper and 7,800 ppm zinc from rock samples in the "Po" showing area. 
 
At the Carbonate Zone, Noranda established a grid with a 4.9 km baseline and 11.4 km of cross 
lines.  The grid was geologically mapped at 1:2,500 scale and soil-sampled with 524 samples 
being collected.  The mapping program outlined a carbonate alteration zone 75 m wide by 
several hundreds of m long.  The soil-sampling program returned anomalous copper, gold, silver 
and zinc values throughout the Carbonate Zone with gold values as high as 2,000 ppb.  Noranda 
also collected 224 rock samples.  One float sample from the Carbonate Zone returned a value of 
44,000 ppb gold, another returned 6.4 g/mT gold and 4% copper. 
 
The regional silt-sampling program returned one sample containing 380 ppb gold and with most 
samples showing a good correlation between copper, silver and gold.  Regional prospecting in 
the "Nasty Cirque" found a rock sample (grab) that contained up to 78 g/mT gold, 617 g/mT 
silver, >1,000 ppm arsenic, 0.3% copper and 5% combined lead and zinc within well brecciated, 
foliated to mylonitized siliceous rock with up to 15% sulphide in the matrix.  As well, a small 
massive sulphide lens exposed in a trench at the Jessie Showing returned 4.13 g/mT gold over 4 
m. 
 
In September 1986, Noranda staked three additional claims (TUT 4 to 6), followed by two more 
claims in December (TUT 7 and 8). In March of 1987, Noranda contracted Aerodat Ltd to 
conduct an airborne geophysical survey over the property.  The survey measured four 
electromagnetic frequencies, magnetics and two VLF-EM frequencies.  The survey was flown 
using an Aerospaciale A-Star helicopter towing a bird with a nominal terrain clearance of the 60 
m, a line spacing of 200 m and total survey length of 182 line-km.   
 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 12  

The airborne survey identified a number of north-westerly to north-north-westerly trending 
magnetic features with seven parallel conductive zones.  Two of the conductive zones 
(conductors III and VII) lie within the property.  Conductor III lies just east of the Camp Zone 
and was proven by Noranda to be caused by graphitic shale that lies just northeast of the 
Llewellyn Fault system.  Conductor VII occurs in the Carbonate Zone in an area of carbonatized 
mafic volcanic rocks.  Aerodat classed it as a possible bedrock sourced feature and that it may be 
a surficial conductor.  Nebocat (2002) interpreted it to be caused by a thin carbonaceous shale 
unit that occurs along the margins of altered Carbonate Zone rocks. 
 
The Aerodat airborne survey was followed-up by a ground magnetic survey as well as, detailed 
soil geochemistry, geological mapping and minor blast trenching.  The details of the 1987 
ground program were not documented, however, Noranda staked the TUT 9 claim in July of 
1987. 
 
In 1988, Noranda collected 153 soil, 2 silt and 77 rock samples, conducted an Induced 
Polarization (IP) survey and drilled two diamond drill holes.  The soil geochemical survey 
identified a northwest-southeast trending anomaly up to 400 m wide and 1000 m long.  Values in 
the soil were up to 18,000 ppb gold, with several samples returning over 1,000 ppb gold.  The 
rock sampling indicated the anomalous soil to be associated with a sheared mafic volcanic unit.  
The IP survey identified a resistivity anomaly in the Carbonate Zone that is coincident with the 
anomalous gold-in-soil zone.  
 
Two NQ drill holes totalling 365.91 m were completed in the Camp Zone.  The holes targeted 
the NW-SE trending gold-in–soil anomaly and IP chargeability high/resistivity low.  The holes 
intersected two main rock types: sub-volcanic intrusive (probably gabbro) and a variably 
sheared, metamorphosed and locally mylonitic dark green volcanic rock.  The core was sampled 
at 1.5 m intervals.  In both holes, the metavolcanic rocks at the top of the holes had anomalous 
gold that ranged up to 690 ppb and averaged 130 ppb over 18 m in hole 1 and 146 ppb gold over 
64.5 m in hole 2.  Noranda later allowed the claims to lapse. 
 
R. H. McMillan staked the Golden Eagle 2 and 3 claims on January 30, 1999 and the Connor 1 
claim on September 10, 2001.  In October of 2001, Marksmen (now Troymet), signed a deal to 
option the property from McMillan.  In September 2002, Marksmen conducted a program of IP 
geophysical surveying, mapping and rock sampling in the Carbonate Zone and southern part of 
the Camp Zone. 
 
The IP survey identified three types of anomalous responses.  The Type "A" responses are 
chargeability highs that are twice that of the background response, with low apparent resistivities 
(less than 300 ohm-metres).  Nebocat (2002) suspected these responses represent shallowly 
buried black shale and recommended geological mapping to locate their source. 
 
The second type of response, Type "B", are north-northwest trending moderate chargeability 
highs, on the order of 50% above background values.  The resistivity response is greater than 
1000 ohm-metres.  These responses appear to be within 25 to 50 metres of surface, they are 
narrow, and are the type of response expected from a sulphide-bearing vein-like source 
(Nebocat, 2002). 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 13  

 
The third response type, Type "C" anomalies, are broad, deep responses with chargeability highs 
50% above background and no resistivity signature.  They trend northwest and occur from Line 
0W to Line 6W. 
 
The rock-sampling program returned up to 1.28% copper and 97.9 ppm silver from a grab 
sample of carbonatized mafic volcanics and 8.95% copper from a sample of malachite-bearing 
mafic volcanic float. 
 
Marksmen Resources Ltd drilled seven diamond drill holes on the property in 2005: Two in the 
Skarn Zone, three on Middle Ridge, and two in the Camp Zone. Significant gold mineralization 
was returned from each area and these are summarized in Table 3, below. Also in 2005, 
Marksmen completed line cutting, ground magnetic, horizontal Loop Electromagnetic and IP 
surveys in the Skarn Zone and in the Plateau Zone. 
 
 
7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
7.1 Regional Geological Setting 
 
The regional geological setting of the project area is taken from Mihalynuk (1999).  The project 
area occurs at the contact between the Coast Belt and the western margin of the Intermontane 
Belt.  The Coast Belt is comprised of predominantly Late Cretaceous and Tertiary magmatic 
rocks, while the Intermontane Belt is composed of Mesozoic arc volcanic and arc-derived 
sedimentary rocks. 
 
The Intermontane Belt, in the area is divided into two packages: Yukon-Tanana Terrane, to the 
west; and rocks of the Whitehorse Trough, to the east.  Overlapping these packages is a Lower to 
Middle Jurassic Volcanic Suite. The Yukon-Tanana Terrane consists primarily of the Boundary 
Range Metamorphic Suite, a belt of polydeformed rocks bounded on the east by the Llewellyn 
Fault and on the west by mainly intrusive rocks of the Coast Belt.  The Boundary Range 
Metamorphic Suite is comprised a wide range of protoliths from quartzose to pelitic or 
carbonaceous and calcareous sediments through volcanic tuffs or flows to small lenses to large 
bodies up to several kilometres across of gabbroic, dioritic, granodioritic and granitic intrusives 
and ultramafite.  These rocks are believed to be Devonian to Triassic in age. 
 
The Whitehorse Trough is bounded by the Llewellyn Fault, to the west, and by the Nahlin Fault, 
to the east.  In the project area the Whitehorse Trough rocks consist of the Triassic Stuhini Group 
and Lower Jurassic Laberge Group.  The Stuhini Group is comprised of basic to intermediate sub 
alkaline volcanic flows, pyroclastics and related arc sediments.  In the Tagish Lake area the 
Stuhini Group stratigraphy consists of a basal volcanic flows and tuffs with interbedded 
conglomerate.  These rocks are intruded by granodioritic intrusions.  The upper part of the 
Stuhini Group is comprised of conglomerate, limestone, shale and wacke.  The Stuhini Group is 
correlative with the Lewes River Group in the Yukon and this sequence extends from central 
Yukon down to the Tulsequah River area in British Columbia. 
 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 14  

The Laberge Group is divided into the Takwahoni and Inklin Formations.  They are dominated 
by immature marine clastics that are regionally metamorphosed to prehnite-pumpellyite and 
epidote-albite facies.  Adjacent to plutons, they are hornfelsed to a higher grade.  The Takwahoni 
Formation is Early to Middle Jurassic age and consists of Stikinia-derived, conglomerate-rich 
clastic rocks.  The Inklin Formation consists of Early Jurassic, mainly fine-grained clastic 
succession of rhythmically bedded argillites and greywackes with locally abundant thin 
conglomerate units.   The argillite can be non-calcareous to weakly calcareous to siliceous.  
Conglomerate units in both the Takwahoni and Inklin Formation are polymictic with clasts of 
well-rounded volcanic, sedimentary and intrusive lithologies. 
 
The overlapping Lower to Middle Jurassic volcanic rocks crop out northwest and southeast of 
Tutshi Lake.  They are composed of andesitic to dacitic bladed feldspar porphyry flows and 
tuffs, dacitic lapilli tuff, rhyolite flows and ash flows, variegated feldspar-phyric flows or coarse 
pyroclastics, and polymictic felsic lapilli tuffs.  In many instances, volcanism appears to have 
been focused along major structural breaks, such as the Nahlin and Llewellyn faults.   
 
The structural geology of the area is dominated by two major sub-parallel, north-northwest 
trending faults that divide and define the boundaries between the Cache Creek Terrane and the 
Whitehorse Trough and between the Whitehorse Trough and the Yukon-Tanana Terrane.  The 
Nahlin Fault more or less marks the western extent of the Cache Creek Terrane and eastern 
extent of the Whitehorse Trough.  It is a steeply dipping to vertical fault, or series of faults and 
has seen intermittent activity from the Late Triassic to Tertiary time.  The Llewellyn fault marks 
the boundary between the regionally metamorphosed Yukon-Tanana Terrane and the Whitehorse 
Trough.  It is also steeply dipping and appears to have been active from Late Triassic to Tertiary 
time.

7.2 Property Geology  
 
The geology for the property is taken primarily from Nebocat (2003), Blanchflower (1990) and 
Terry, et. al. (1998).  The geology of the Tannis and Bennett Lake blocks is similar, while that of 
the Golden Eagle Block differs slightly.  Field observations from 2003 through 2006 are limited 
to specific, isolated areas on the West Gully Zone, south and east of the Skarn Zone, the West 
Draw, South Mountain, the cliffs along the highway, a few traverses southeast of Tutshi Lake, 
the Carbonate Zone and the Gossan Zone. In 2006, detailed mapping and sampling was 
undertaken on Middle Ridge. 
 
Bennett Lake and Middle Ridge Area 
 
The Middle Ridge and Bennett lake areas lie west of the Llewellyn Fault in Yukon-Tanana 
Terrane. The geology can generally be divided into three northwest-southeast trending packages: 
Stuhini Group rocks to the east; Boundary Range Metamorphic rocks in the centre; and Lower 
Jurassic Inklin sediments and Lower to Middle Jurassic volcanic rocks to the west. 
 
The Stuhini Group rocks outcrop in the northern part of Middle Ridge, on North Mountain, and 
extend into the Bennett Lake Block. They consist of dark-green, in part variegated green-
maroon, dense, massive, hornblende feldspar phyric volcanic rocks that contain up to 5% 
pervasive epidote.  In hand specimen, the rock is weakly porphyritic with 10% euhedral, white 
feldspar phenocrysts to 3 mm long. 
 
In the lower 150 m of the Stuhini Group rocks are at least four intervals of light buff-weathering, 
light green tremolite marble interbedded with dark grey, fine-grained lapilli tuff.  The marble is 
significantly altered and permeated by micro-fractures.  Towards the upper contact with the 
Inklin Formation is a dark green-grey volcaniclastic breccia, with clasts to 10 cm, interbedded 
with the volcanics. 
 
On North Mountain the lower Stuhini Group is in fault contact with the Boundary Range 
Metamorphic Rocks.  The Boundary Range Metamorphic Rocks are composed of feldspar-
hornblende+biotite+sericite gneiss, and feldspar-quartz-chlorite+ biotite schist.  Minor augen 
gneiss and rare carbonate intervals were observed, as well as occasionally unmetamorphosed 
intervals.  Petrological work on the Boundary Range Metamorphic Rocks by Morris (1988) 
suggests a volcanic and volcaniclastic affinity.   
 
On Middle Ridge and South Mountain localized hornfels has developed in the Boundary Range 
rocks where it is in contact with the rhyolitic intrusive.  Metamorphic grade and the degree of 
deformation are much higher in this unit than in the younger Stuhini Group indicating the 
occurrence of a deformational event prior to the deposition of the Upper Triassic rocks. 
 
On Middle Ridge a section tentatively assigned to Stuhini Group appears gradational with the 
overlying Inklin Formation (Laberge Group).  In the eastern part of Middle Ridge the lower 
contact with the metamorphic rocks is difficult to distinguish and is presumably faulted. An 
interbedded sequence of variegated, very dark grey to maroon microcrystalline tuff, medium 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 17  

grey brown sub-trachytic microlitic felsic tuff/flow, grades into very dark grey argillites of the 
Inklin Formation. 
 
The Inklin Formation is composed of carbonaceous argillites interbedded with minor 
carbonaceous siltstones.  The upper contact on Middle Ridge and South Mountain is covered by 
talus due to the recessive nature of the formation.  Shearing is evident in the basal Middle to 
upper Jurassic volcanics that overly the Inklin and could indicate a fault contact (see photo 1).  
Inklin derived clasts occur within intervals of the Jurassic volcanics indicating an erosional 
unconformity.  The lower contact on South Mountain is intruded by rhyolite. 
 
Nebocat (2003) mapped a section of Laberge Group pelagic sediments overlying the Stuhini 
Group volcanics along the western margin of the Tannis Block and on Middle Ridge.  Interbeds 
of argillite and argillaceous tuff occur within the overlying felsic to intermediate Jurassic (?) 
volcaniclastics, which may suggest a conformable contact with the underlying Laberge Group.  
The eastern contact between the overlying Laberge Group and fine-grained felsic intrusive 
appears to be fault controlled.  
 
Middle to Upper Jurassic volcanics occur in the south-western part of the claim group in a 
synclinal structure where a sub-unit of clast supported conglomerates are interbedded with and 
overlie a volcanic sequence (Morris, 1988).  The volcanic sequence consists of an intermediate 
medium brown-grey pyroclastic breccia with clasts ranging to 30 cm.  The unit is sheared 
towards the base and contains minor red hematitic chert clasts to 5 cm long (<1%).  Interbedded 
with breccia are intermediate to mafic ash-lapilli-lithic tuffs that have up to 80% lapilli to 15 
mm.  Weakly aligned lapilli that include sericite-altered glass indicate original bedding. 
 

 
Photo 1.  View of Rhyolitic Intrusion through Middle Ridge 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 18  

The volcanic unit also contains brown bladed, sub-trachytic feldspar porphyry flows having 50-
60% porphyroblasts to 6 mm that display graded bedding over intervals many meters thick and a 
narrow unit of intermediate to mafic agglomerate with porphyroblastic bombs to 40 cm in a fine-
grained matrix.  The overlying clast supported conglomerate is composed primarily of Inklin-
derived, finely laminated clay, silt and sand pebbles in a coarse sandy matrix.  These 
conglomerates have thin interbeds of carbonaceous argillite in part containing coarse woody 
fragments. 
 
A north-south trending rhyolitic sub volcanic dyke that is up to 200 m wide cuts Middle Ridge 
and South Mountain.  Mihalynuk and Rouse (1988) have interpreted the dyke to be an apophosy 
of the equigranular biotite granite that occurs in the Paddy Pass valley and southwest of there.  
The granite is in intrusive contact with the overlying Stuhini Group volcanics.  Nebocat (2003) 
observed an intrusive and/or fault contact between the rhyolite and biotite granite and suggests 
that the rhyolite may not be an apophysy. 
 
Large east-west joints traverse the rhyolite and are often filled by arsenopyrite-bearing quartz 
veins. These joints/veins penetrate the metamorphic rocks in a number of locations on the eastern 
side of Middle Ridge and in the volcanic rocks on the western side of Middle Ridge.  This joint 
pattern has not been observed in the biotite granite. 
 
The granite is medium to coarse grained, equigranular biotite granite on the north side of Middle 
Ridge and in the southwest and northwest part of the Bennett Lake Block.  It also occurs on the 
south side of Middle Ridge where it is more porphyritic granite with large potassium feldspar 
phenocrysts.  On the Bennett Lake Block, the biotite granite locally contains several percent 
pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. 
 
North of the Skarn Zone, on the east side of the plateau the Stuhini Group mafic volcanic rocks 
exhibit pillow structures.  These rocks are moderately chloritized and weakly carbonitized, 
probably related to spillitic alteration at the time of deposition.  Minor limonite staining was 
observed and very little pyrite was noted.  In the creek north of the Skarn Zone is the LQ quartz 
vein.  It is a 1.0-m-wide, bull-white quartz vein with coarse pyrite gobs to 10 cm.  Two samples 
collected from the vein in 2004; BEN04-25 and BEN04-26, returned 1,764 ppb and 4,718 ppb 
gold, respectively.  The vein also contains abundant antimony, arsenic, silver and lead. 
 
South of the Skarn Zone an area of moderate limonite staining was identified in Boundary Range 
metamorphic rocks near the contact with Stuhini Group rocks.  Samples collected in the area did 
not return any significantly anomalous precious or base metal values. 
 
A large area of moderate to strong carbonate-chlorite altered Stuhini Plutonic Suite gabbroic 
rocks was observed in the upper part of the West Gully.  Further down slope is a large rhyolite 
dyke, identical to that observed on Middle Ridge.  Two short adits driven on narrow quartz veins 
in the rhyolite were examined, but no significant mineralization was observed.  Scattered quartz-
stibnite-arsenopyrite veins to 0.8 m wide are observed in the altered gabbroic rocks.   
 
The most obvious structural control on the property is transverse and block faulting.  A NW-SE 
structure runs along the east side of Middle Ridge and continues southwards to South Mountain.  



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 19  

This structure appears to have been exploited by the rhyolitic intrusion in this area.  On the north 
side of Middle Ridge, this structure is truncated by another fault trending roughly north-south 
and marked by a steep, talus filled gully. 
 
A series of near parallel structures, trending 0 o to 15o azimuth and dipping from 80o west to 85o 
east were mapped on the north slope of Middle Ridge.  These structures define a number of 
drainages that flow north into Paddy Pass.  
 
In a north-south trending gully on the northwest side of Middle Ridge is a rhyolite dyke that 
appears to have intruded along a fault.  The dyke intrudes the biotite granite indicating the 
rhyolite to be younger that the granite.  However, it is also possible that later fault movement 
juxtaposed the rhyolite against the biotite granite.  No other rhyolite dykes have been observed 
cutting the granite on the property. 
 
Golden Eagle Block 
 
The Golden Eagle Block is underlain by Lower Jurassic Inklin sediments and Lower to Middle 
Jurassic volcanic rocks to the west, Boundary Range Metamorphic Suite rocks in the centre, and 
Stuhini Group volcanics to the east.  The Llewellyn fault cuts through the centre of the block and 
marks the contact between the Boundary Range rocks and the Stuhini Group rocks.  The Camp 
Zone is in a felsic volcaniclastic rocks.  The Carbonate Zone occurs 1 km southeast of the Camp 
Zone, across the Llewellyn Fault in Stuhini Group rocks. 
 
Noranda (1988) described drill core from the two holes drilled in the Camp Zone to be medium 
grained, slightly foliated granodiorite throughout the drill holes.  Nebocat (2003) describe a 
traverse examining talus along the base of slope in the Camp Zone to be greenstone, greenschist 
facies metamorphic rocks and a rhyolitic volcanic with "ropey" texture similar to primary flow 
features. 
 
The Carbonate Zone is underlain by dark green mafic volcanic that has undergone extensive 
carbonatization imparting an orange-brown coloration to the rocks (Photo 2).  The rusty-brown 
colour of many of the carbonate veins and stringers suggests that at least part of the carbonate is 
composed of ankerite and/or siderite.  Volcanic textures are not readily evident due to the intense 
carbonate alteration overprinting, but auto-breccia clasts are seen locally.  The rock is presumed 
to be basalt, it has been pervasively chloritized and fuchsite/mariposite are observed rarely.  
Weak evidence of pillow features were observed in the cliff face west of the small falls on the 
creek draining the Carbonate Zone. 
 
Overlying the intensely altered mafic volcanic rocks is a maroon to green tuff-breccia that 
appears to be genetically related to the underlying flows and breccias.  This unit is quite friable 
and subcrops only along the two ridge saddles on the east side of the Carbonate Zone. 
 
This volcanic unit is overlain by a thin shale/limestone horizon that is exposed on the northeast 
and southwest side of the Carbonate Zone draw.  The shale is black and graphitic and weathers 
recessively.  The limestone is light grey and forms prominent, blocky talus.  This unit is not more 
than 10 m thick.  This unit dips 40o northeast on the east side of the draw and sub-vertically on 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 20  

the west side.  These dips indicate either an anticline through the centre of the draw, or that the 
Carbonate Zone is a submarine domal feature that has a veneer of limestone deposited on its 
flanks.  Thus the Carbonate Zone may be the volcano that fed the mafic volcanics in the area (see 
Photo 2). 
 

 
Photo 2.  Possible Volcanic Dome Feature in Carbonate Zone 

  
Overlying the shale/limestone is a thick sequence of epiclastic sediments.  These sediments 
appear to conformably overlie the shale/limestone unit.  Lithologies vary from conglomerate, 
grit, wacke to mudstone.  These sediments are more prominent on the east side of the Carbonate 
Zone and have an apparent thickness of up to 200 m. 
 
Overlying the epiclastic rocks is an intermediate volcanic unit.  On the east side of the Carbonate 
Zone this unit is predominantly a volcaniclastic and plagioclase crystal tuff, while on the west 
side of the Carbonate Zone it is a plagioclase crystal tuff and plagioclase porphyritic flow. 
 
Intruding the Carbonate Zone rocks are rhyolite dykes along the northeast margin of the 
Carbonate Zone.  Along the margin of these dykes are considerable limonite and jarosite 
staining, boxwork cavities (after pyrite), intense argillic alteration and pyrite mineralization.  The 
alteration in this rock increases to the northeast.  One of these rhyolitic intrusions occurs 
proximal to a rusty iron seep.  A second rhyolitic intrusion occurs in the main creek area where 
intense carbonate alteration and abundant copper mineralization has been observed.  These 
intrusions may be related to the alteration and mineralization in these areas.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES  
 

The Bennett Lake-Tutshi Lake area has the potential to host several deposits types, from bulk 
tonnage copper/gold porphyries with associated skarn deposits to high-grade gold veins to 
volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits.  This area of northwestern BC and Southern 
Yukon has had an extensive history of exploration for high-grade gold veins and has had some 
production from the Venus vein system on Montana Mountain, 15 km east of the property, and 
from the Mount Skookum Mine, 35 km to the northwest.  High-grade gold-bearing arsenopyrite-
quartz veins have been observed throughout the property.  This style of mineralization is similar 
to the veins at Mt Skookum and Venus. 
 
Mihalynuk recognized the similarity of the geological setting and geochemical fingerprint of the 
Tutshi Lake area to that of the Eskay Creek area of British Columbia (Mihalynuk et. al., 2003).  
Eskay Creek is a gold-silver-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit.  The ore-forming 
horizons at Eskay Creek occur at the interface between Middle Jurassic argillaceous strata and 
felsic volcanic units in the Bowser Basin.  The mineralization is interpreted to have formed in a 
sub aqueous, near shore, hot spring environment in an active arc setting.  The volcanic strata are 
coincident with a regional geochemical province displaying an elevated gold-antimony-arsenic 
signature.  This geochemical fingerprint is typical of shallow submarine VMS deposits.  Many of 
these features are observed in the Tutshi Lake area. 
 
Other geological features in the Tutshi Lake area that indicate potential for VMS deposits are: 
 

1) Bimodal felsic and mafic volcanic rocks overlain by marine sediments 
2) Stockwork quartz-carbonate veining in the Carbonate Zone (possible hydrothermal feeder 

zone) 
3) Soil geochemical anomalies proximal to volcanic-sedimentary interface 
4) Copper-lead-zinc-gold-silver metal association in soil and rock samples 

 
The mafic volcanic rocks, carbonate alteration and stockwork veining in the Carbonate Zone are 
also indications of a potential mafic-hosted VMS-type deposit such as the Besshi-type or 
Cyprus-type Deposits. 
 
 
9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
Numerous styles of mineralization have been observed on the property. 
 
Quartz-arsenopyrite + pyrite + stibnite + sphalerite + galena veins occur in the Bennett lake area 
as north-striking and north-northwest striking veins that range in thickness from several 
centimetres to up to 3 metres.  They are commonly localized in dilatant shear or fault zones in 
the West Gully and Skarn Zone (Terry, 1998). 
 
Chalcopyrite and magnetite veins at Bennett Lake have been identified in shear zones on the 
west-facing cliffs above Bennett Lake and consist of disseminated and massive chalcopyrite and 
magnetite over a 10 m wide zone in a sheared granodiorite (Terry, 1998).  Rock grab samples 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 22  

from an old adit driven 7 metres on a vein/shear structure returned 3.3 to 9.5% copper 
(Blanchflower, 1990). 
 
Skarn-type mineralization is observed in the Skarn Zone. The mineralization occurs as 
pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, actinolite + calcite in fracture controlled veinlets and pervasive 
replacements of Boundary Range Metamorphic rocks and Stuhini Group volcanic rocks proximal 
to an amphibole-feldspar porphyry dyke that is up to 10 m thick.  Drilling in this area returned up 
to 10 g/mT gold. 
 
The greatest concentration of mineralized veins occurs on Middle Ridge on the Tannis Block.  
They occur on both sides of the ridge in the fine-grained rhyolite and in the Boundary Range 
Metamorphic rocks. The mineralization is reported to occur in two forms: arsenopyrite-rich cores 
with scorodite envelopes in the rhyolite host; and coarse arsenopyrite with rare chalcopyrite in 
quartz veins with no alteration in the metamorphic rocks.  The veins are up to 3.1 metres wide, 
strike roughly east-west and dip near vertical.   
 
A 5 metre-long adit and a 2 metre-long adit were driven to access two of these veins o the south 
side of Middle Ridge. The 5-metre adit was established to access a vein in the Boundary Range 
Metamorphic Rocks, but never reached its target.  The 3 m long adit was established to access a 
vein in the rhyolitic rocks and, also didn't reach its target.   
 
Arsenopyrite-quartz veins also occur on North Mountain and South Mountain on the Tannis 
Property. The veins on the North Mountain are hosted in rhyolitic intrusions and in the Boundary 
Range Metamorphic rocks and were described by Copeland in 1986.  On South Mountain, the 
mineralized veins are confined to a fine-grained rhyolite host.  The veins are up to 0.6 m wide 
and occur below 1385 m elevation and above 1400 m elevation. 
 
Mihalynuk (1999) reported discovering an antimony-rich tuff horizon in the Lower to Middle 
Jurassic volcanics, which overlie the Inklin Formation (Laberge Group) shales along the western 
part of the property.  In 1988, Mihalynuk collected a sample of this material that contained 975 
ppm antimony. 
 
A number of small (up to 2 m diameter) isolated pods of very fine-grained magnetite/pyrrhotite 
skarn mineralization were observed in Boundary Range Metamorphic rocks proximal to the 
Cretaceous intrusive contact above the highway on the south-eastern part of the Tannis Property.   
A number of samples of this mineralization were collected, however, they were not anomalous 
for precious or base metals. 
 
At the Golden Eagle Property, gold mineralization has been documented to occur with 
hydrothermal alteration related to either a shear zone in mafic volcanic rocks or to occur as 
disseminations in the altered mafic volcanic rocks.  In the drill logs prepared by Noranda (Duke, 
1989) they reported a high degree of propylitic alteration accompanied by silicification, 
carbonatization and disseminated and fracture-filed pyrite and pyrrhotite, which contained gold. 
 
Also at Golden Eagle, copper and gold mineralization has been found in surface rock samples 
and is indicated from soil sampling in the Carbonate Zone.  The mineralization occurs as 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 23  

chalcopyrite and pyrite in quartz carbonate veins that form a weak to moderate stockwork zone 
in the cliffs at the north end of the zone.  An iron-rich mineral seep occurs 200 m east of the 
stockwork zone and may indicate an extension of the stockwork zone eastward.  Sampling of the 
iron-rich seep material by previous workers, however, did not return any significant precious or 
base metals values.  The soil-sampling program above the stockwork zone returned a number of 
samples anomalous for copper and gold.  An IP geophysical survey conducted in the area in 
2002 indicates this zone to extend to depth. 
 
 
10.0 2006 EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 
The 2006 exploration program on the property consisted of construction of an ATV access trail 
on Middle Ridge, detailed geological mapping on Middle Ridge, and 1,125 m of diamond 
drilling in 6 holes. 
 
Aurora Geosciences Ltd of Whitehorse was contracted to conduct the field program.  The ATV 
trail construction was conducted from May 25 to June 19 and from July 7 to 15 and was 
accomplished with the use of a small Kabota backhoe.  The crew consisted of Gary Lee 
(supervisor), Gord Uttley (labourer), Gaetan Cyr (labourer), Jesse Halle (geologist) and Bob 
Stirling of Stewart Basin Exploration (backhoe owner/operator). 
 
The geological mapping and sampling program on Middle Ridge was conducted from June 20 to 
30 and was accomplished by Jesse Halle (geologist) and Lauren Blackburn (geologist).  
 
Drill pad blasting and construction was conducted from July 21 to August 4 and from August 18 
to 31 by Gary Lee (Crew supervisor and blaster), Gord Ruby (labourer) and Shawn Parent 
(labourer), Sabastian Roy (labourer) and Steve Francis (labourer). 
 
The drilling program commenced on September 6 and continued to November 30. The Aurora 
Crew consisted of Scott Casselman (Project Manager), Kel Sax (Project Geologist), Lauren 
Blackburn (Geologist), Allison Peel (Geologist), Sharon Monder (Cook), Remy Legace 
(Labourer), Casey Adshead (geological technician), Maxim Dubois (labourer) and Michael Mark 
(core cutter).  The drill contractor was Caron Diamond Drilling of Whitehorse, Yukon. 
 
The 2006 exploration program on the Golden Eagle Property focused on 4 target areas. At 
Middle Ridge, the mapping and drill program targeted previously identified gold-silver bearing 
quartz veins; In the Carbonate Zone the drill program targeted Induced Polarization chargeability 
anomalies that were identified in a survey performed by Aurora Geosciences in 2002;  At the 
Skarn Zone the drilling targeted an IP chargeability anomaly and gold mineralization associated 
with contact metasomatized volcanics; and a single drill hole was drilled in the Plateau Zone to 
test an IP Chargeability anomaly that had been previously drilled, but not thoroughly tested.  
Table 2 lists the drill hole technical data and Table 3 is a summary of drilling results.

The mapping and sampling program on Middle Ridge aided in defining the known quartz-
arsenopyrite veins and located a number of new veins west of the rhyolite dyke (Figure 5).  The 
sample results returned 12 samples with greater that 1 g/t gold (see sample description table in 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 25  

Appendix III) with sample GE-06-015 returning 39.31 g/t gold from a grab samples of quartz-
arsenopyrite mineralization south of the collar of hole Tan05-01.  These samples also returned 7 
samples with >100 g/t silver with two of those containing >1000 g/t Ag from quartz-arsenopyrite 
veins within the rhyolite dyke.  The program was confined to the central and easily accessible 
parts of Middle Ridge, however based on these results a greater effort should be made to expand 
the detailed mapping, prospecting and sampling westwards into prospective areas. 
 
Prior to the commencement of the drill program on Middle Ridge, eight drill sites were identified 
on the north side of the ridge and 4 drill sites were prepared.  However, due to the late start to the 
drill program and the onset of winter conditions, only one drill hole was completed in the Middle 
Ridge area (TAN06-04) before the drill had to be removed to a safer location.  This hole targeted 
surface mineralization identified in Trench 5 and the down dip extent of gold-silver bearing 
quartz veins identified in hole TAN05-01. The results of TAN06-04 are given in Table 3.  The 
hole interested two mineralized veins at the appropriate depths, however the gold and silver 
grades were not as significant as those from the upper hole or from the trench.  As should be 
expected in such an environment, there will be significant variability in precious metals 
concentrations. The drill hole, however did confirm the veins extending to depth and they are 
open at depth.  The gold-bearing sheeted quartz-arsenopyrite vein system in the rhyolitic 
intrusion and host Boundary Range Metamorphic rocks is quite extensive and contain significant 
gold values.  The nature of the mineralization appears to be from a high-level epithermal setting.  
 
Drill hole SIG06-05, in the Skarn Zone tested and IP chargeability anomaly a short distance from 
the gold-bearing mineralization.  The hole encountered 1 to 3% disseminated pyrrhotite and 
pyrite mineralization, explaining the chargeability anomaly, but failed to return any significant 
precious or base metals values. 
 
Drill hole SIG-06-06 was drilled in the Plateau Zone and tested an IP chargeability anomaly that 
was partially tested by Westmin in 1997, and returned significant widths of anomalous, but sub-
economic gold mineralization. The Westmin hole, however, did not test the full extent of the 
anomaly.  SIG06-06 targeted the eastern extremity of the anomaly and encountered graphitic 
mudstone and shale with disseminated pyrite. No significant values were returned.  
 
The three drill holes in the Carbonate Zone (GE06-03, 04 and 05) targeted IP chargeability 
anomalies in an area where selected grabs samples have returned significant copper 
mineralization and sporadic gold mineralization.  These holes intersected carbonate altered and 
veined mafic volcaniclastic rocks with disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite, but did not encounter 
any significant copper mineralization.  Hole GE06-04, however, did return 3.1 m grading 2.64 
g/t gold.  This intercept may warrant some follow-up work. 



 

2006 Golden Eagle Project – page 26  

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
The sampling method employed for reconnaissance and detailed prospecting involves the 
collection of 0.5 to 1.0 kg grab or chip samples representative of the mineralized rock 
encountered. Detailed descriptions are taken for every sample collected and sample locations are 
recorded by hand-held GPS. Chip samples are taken where practical, involving the collection of 
a continuous and representative rock chips over the entire sample width.  
 
The methodology of sampling drill core is to collect a representative sample of any significant 
mineralization and/or geological areas of interest encountered in the hole. Sample widths are 
often based on geology and can vary from a few tens of centimetres to 2.0 metres of core length. 
The typical sample size varies from 0.5 to 1.0 metre. The core is split down its length prior to 
sampling, allowing for a representative half of the sampled interval to remain for future 
reference. 
 
 
12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The collection and handling of all samples was conducted by Aurora Geosciences personnel 
under the overall supervision of the project manager and author, Scott Casselman. 
 
Rock samples were placed in plastic sample bags and sealed, with the sample numbers marked 
on the bags and the sample sites tagged and numbered.  
 
In the case of drill core sampling, selected sample intervals were marked on the core and 
assigned two sample tickets with a designated number. The core was then split with one half 
placed in a plastic bag with one of the tickets and the other half returned to the core box with the 
other ticket for future reference. The plastic bag was sealed and the sample number marked on 
the bag.  
 
All samples were sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver for processing.  Acme is 
an ISO 9002 accredited facility.  A total of 29 rock and 406 drill core samples were collected in 
the program.  All samples were handled in a secure manner and placed in sealed poly bags for 
shipment to the lab.  Geochemical Analytical Certificates are included in Appendix II, rock 
sample descriptions are included in Appendix III and drill logs are included in Appendix IV. 
 
Rock and core samples were prepared by drying the sample then crushing to -10-mesh.  A 250 
gm split was taken from the -10-mesh material and pulverized to -150-mesh.  A 30 gm sample of 
the –150-mesh material was then digested in 180 ml of aqua-regia solution and diluted to 600 ml 
with distilled water.  This solution was then analyzed for gold and 36 elements by Inductively 
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Any gold values that returned greater than 500 
ppb were then re-analyzed by fire assay on a 29.2 gram (1 assay-ton) sample with an ICP 
Emission Spectrometry Finish for a 0.001 oz/t detection limit.  For any copper, lead or zinc 
values greater than 10,000 ppm an assay involving aqua regia digestion on a 1 gm sample and 
ICP Emission Spectrometry was performed giving a 0.01% detection limit.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
In the author's opinion, appropriate control measures were employed throughout the sampling, 
shipping and analytical processes to ensure a reliable database. 
 
 
14.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 2006 exploration program on the Golden Eagle Property was successful in confirming the 
presence of significant precious metals mineralization in the Middle Ridge area.  Many drill sites 
and targets remain to be tested there.  The 2006 program returned a moderate gold intercept in 
hole GE06-04 in the Carbonate Zone that may warrant follow-up work. The program did not 
encounter any significant results in the Plateau Zone or Skarn Zone. Due to the late start of the 
drilling portion of the program, many of the drill targets in the Middle Ridge area and at the LQ 
vein near the Skarn Zone were not tested.   
 
 
15.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Recommendations for future work on the property are to: 
 
1) Complete the drill program on Middle Ridge with drill sites as listed in Table 4 below. 
2) Drill a minimum of two drill holes on the LQ vein with sites listed in Table 4. 
3) Undertake more geological mapping and sampling in the Middle Ridge area. 
4) Commence a property scale geological mapping program with a focus on following up 

airborne geophysical electromagnetic, magnetic and radiometric anomalies that were 
identified in 2005. 

5) Ground geophysics where warranted to follow-up field work in preparation for drilling. 
6) Additional drilling as dictated by results.

The airborne geophysical survey flown on the property in 2005 identified 62 electromagnetic 
conductors and a number of magnetic anomalies.  The majority of these anomalies have not been 
followed up.   
 
Massive pyrrhotite mineralization has been reported by Noranda in Moon Creek, north of the 
Golden Eagle Block and by Westmin in the Skarn Zone.  This mineralization may be related to 
VMS-style horizons. A number of isolated magnetic anomalies are observed scattered 
throughout the survey area, many of which are associated with EM responses.  These should be 
checked as part of the property-scale mapping program 
 
The budget for this program is estimated at: 
 
Geological mapping and sampling $200,000 
Ground geophysics $50,000 
3000 m of diamond drilling (all inclusive) $500,000 
 
Total $750,000

2.90, 3.25
Andesitic Lithic Tuff: Intensively broken core: Weathered and broken bed rock or talus. Lithology: Very similar/ same as underlying interval. No detailed
description as a result of broken core. Lower contact: Arbitrarily chosen. Gradational with decreasingly broken core.

3.25, 18.10
Andesitic Lithic Tuff: Variably dark green grey - dark brown grey, predominantly aphanitic - fine grained, mafic to andesitc rock. Brownish coloured sections
alternate with greenish coloured sections, grading into  mottled sections, possibly a (volcanic) clastic origin. The greenish colour is assumed to be chlorite,
the brownish colour is possibly finely disseminated biotite(?). Locally up to several dm sized patches and sections with quartz nodules (11.10 - 111.60 m),
possibly secondary silicification and gypsum(?) nodules (15.6 and 17.6 - 18.0 m,  from primary vesicles?). A clearly identifiable fragmental texture is very
rare, but locally developed (9.0 - 9.2 m). The protolith is probably mafic or intermediate volcaniclastic, possibly a basaltic or andesitic lithic ash tuff.
The interval is generally non magnetic, with up to ~ dm sized magnetic patches between 14.5 and 15.5 m, which are part of mostly greenish - dark greenish,
partially beige brown, variably orientated (from steep angle to CA - sub parallel to CA) and generally highly irregular, pinching veins of sub mm - several cm
width. The  veins appear to be chlorite, +/- quartz, amphibole actinolite(?), tremolite(?), +/- pyrrhotite +/- (magnetic patches), +/- pyrite and accessory
minerals: Malachite, +/- chalcopyrite, +/- VG at 3.6 m, 4.55 m and 11.70 m, +/- carbonate, +/- iron bearing carbonate.
The mineralisation appears to be predominantly confined to veins/ veinlets/ stringers, but rarely appears to grade into a pervasive alteration pattern (for
example silicification at 11.1 - 11.5 m). Rarely specks of mineralisation resembling the vein mineralisation form isolated specks within the host rock. Vein
mineralisation is estimated to amount to ~ 8 %.
The material is also cut with younger bright white - light coloured, carbonate-bearing, variably orientated, sub mm with a few mm wide veinlets.
Lower contact: Sharp, distinct, based on colour change to cream - beige. No orientation as a result of broken core.

18.10, 26.40
Hornblende-Feldspar Porphyry: Light cream grey - olive green grey, amphibole phyric  (hornblende) intrusive rock, presumably a dike or a sill, with ~ sub
mm to 5 mm sized, frequently elongated, angular, frequently sword shaped phenocrysts, which amount to ~ 10 %, in a light grey, aphanitic matrix. Also
present (particularly within the lower part of the interval): +/- irregular shaped,very soft, up to several mm sized greenish grey spots, which are assumed to
be chloritised feldspar or hornblende and amount to ~ 10 %. Near lower contact patches and up to dm sized sections with up to 3 mm sized, +/- irregular
shaped - euhedral feldspar phenocrysts in a light grey, aphanitic ground mass, amount to < 5 %. Weak trend of amphibole and feldspar content being
reverse proportional. Finely disseminated pyrite throughout; << 3 % (accessory), locally accumulating to sub mm sized specks.
The interval is nerved with white - rusty red, variably orientated (steep angle to CA - sub parallel to CA), generally sub mm wide, highly carbonate bearing
(+/- iron carbonate) veinlets, which are highlighted by up to ~ cm wide rusty red halos. Veinlet mineralisation is locally associated with black appearing, fine
grained mineral, possibly pyrite?
Lower contact: Not well defined as a result of fining towards lower contact (chill margin). Quartz nodules and quartz-, chlorite-, carbonate-, pyrite nodules
(presumably filled vesicles) within ~ 30 cm of assumed contact are assumed to be a result of chill. The contact is also marked by the appearance of
amphibole bearing veins, as described in previous interval.

26.40, 35.05
Andesitic Lithic Tuff: The lithology of this interval is very similar/ same as the lithology described from 2.9 - 18.1 m. Highly carbonate bearing and somewhat
chlorite bearing , white - light green, irregular and variably orientated veining is intense within up to ~ m sized sections, amounting to an estimated > 15 %
(for example at 28.2 - 29.3 m) and results in a shattered appearance. Amphibole vein mineralisation is still present, but significantly less abundant than in 2.9
- 18.1 m. Sulphides are very rare and appear to be pyrite only. Pyrite is also present as a finely disseminated accessory mineral within the host rock.
Malachite, chalcopyrite, quartz and gold  appear to be lacking within these veins. Very few and small magnetic patches could be detected, indicating the
presence of accessory pyrrhotite. Pyrite coating on fracture plane @ variable angle to CA.

Andesitic Lithic Tuff: Intensively broken core: Weathered and broken up bed rock or talus. Lithology: Very similar/ same as underlying interval. No detailed
description as a result of broken core.  Lower contact: Gradational over several dm, +/- arbitrarily chosen with decreasingly broken core.

9.40, 63.10
Andesitic Lithic Tuff: Variably green grey - brown grey -mauve grey, partially black and/ or white mottled (fragments) rock. Grain size and grain size
distribution is very variable from aphanitic - fine grained - lapilli sized, rarely bomb sized. This very heterogeneous interval is tentatively interpreted as an
alternating sequence of brownish, very fine grained ash tuff (or flow?) and a greenish, lithic lapilli ash tuff and/ or crystal ash tuff.
The poly lithic composition of the lapilli/ crystal ash tuff is very clearly displayed at 14.3  - 15.4 m: Up to several cm sized cream - green grey, dark spotted
(diorite?) fragments and up to ~ cm sized , angular - sub angular, rarely rounded, dark grey fragments (crystal fragments?).  Prominent fragmental (lapilli)
texture at 24.9 - 26 m. At ~ 25.3 m the feldspar appears yellow green, which is presumably the result of saussurisation. Interval is variably intensely
chloritized, with the chlorite content being higher within the green-grey sections. The brown-mauve-grey sections possibly have a higher biotite content (?).
The contacts between the lithic (crystal) lapilli ash tuff and the assumed ash tuff are variably sharp@ 45° to 50° CA.
2 - 3 % pyrrhotite in veinlets. Depending on their pyrrhotite content the veins and veinlets are variably (weakly - moderately - rarely strongly) magnetic,
resulting in a patchy magnetism, which grades locally into weakly - moderately magnetic sections of up to several m length.

Rods got stuck and hole lost before reaching target.

Diorite: Intensively broken core: Weathered bed rock or talus. Lithology: Similar/ same as underlying interval; no detailed description because of broken
core. Lower contact is gradational, +/- arbitrarily chosen with +/- less broken core.

4.90, 30.50
Diorite: Variably dark green grey - cream light grey, slightly brownish grey, mottled - spotted, presumably intrusive rock: Dark coloured, mafic minerals are
estimated to amount to ~ 35 %; light coloured, dull white - very slightly pinkish coloured, felsic minerals (feldspar) are estimated to amount to < 10 %? The
material is medium grained, from sub mm up to > 5 mm sized crystals. However, some of the assumed feldspar crystals appear to have translucent, glassy
appearing seams, partially grading into interwoven, granular appearing micro texture within the assumed feldspar crystals. The rock texture resembles a
volcanic rock, with anhedral phenocrysts in a green grey, chlorite bearing matrix. This rock has faintly developed fragmental texture (?) with rounded
fragments to several cm or possibly autobreccia within an intrusion? These subsections appear to be particularly susceptible to local quartz flooding (for
example at 5.7 m). The dark coloured mineral grains are assumed to be partially chloritized amphiboles, mostly with irregular shape, rarely resembling laths
and/ or with rectangular or hexagonal cross section. The interval is altered - heavily altered, chloritized and carbonate bearing throughout, with carbonate
disseminated and enriched within generally sub mm wide, variably orientated, irregular, pinching veinlets and stringers. Interval is pyrite bearing throughout,
with pyrite mostly disseminated, occurring as sub mm sized specks, rarely up to several mm sized aggregates or granoblasts, which are typically located on
the seams or in the centre of the altered amphiboles. Very rarely highly pyrite bearing veinlets @ variable orientation to CA (preferred orientation @ 40o to
CA), which are rarely > 1 mm. Pyrite is estimated to amount to < 3 %. Very highly chlorite bearing, up to several mm wide, variably orientated veinlets and
stringers amount to > 3 %.  Accessory greenish - light beige brown quartz veins. Lower contact is gradational ~ 3 m.

30.50, 80.20
Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: Light green grey - dark green grey, extrusive(?) rock with a porphyritic texture: Distinct, ~ 3 to 8 mm sized, sub round to round,
rarely angular (rectangular, feldspar resembling shape), bright white quartz eyes in a variably light green grey to dark green grey, considerably softer,
aphanitic matrix. At 63.6 m irregular jasper specks. The dark green colour of the matrix is assumed to be the result of chlorite and the light green colour is
presumably the result of sericite. Dark green, sub round to angular, several mm to several cm sized patches within lighter coloured subsections are
preliminary interpreted as pseudo fragments, for example at 57.7 m. The interval is carbonate bearing throughout: Carbonate finely disseminated within the
matrix and enriched within white, variably orientated, sub mm - > 5 mm wide (rarely ~ cm wide) veinlets stringer and veins. The stringers and veinlets are
often kinked, pinching, irregular. The carbonate bearing veins, veinlets, stringers are estimated to amount to > 3 %. Locally the carbonate bearing veins have
dark green, chloritic seams (zoned). The interval also displays dark green - dark grey appearing, variably orientated, chlorite bearing stringers.
Up to several mm wide, variably orientated, pale green, waxy and partially patchy, presumably highly sericite bearing veins/ veinlets are few and far apart

(for example at 73.55 m) but sericite content overall is estimated to be >> 10 % as a result of pervasive and in sections extensive sericite alteration (light
green colour). Interval contains finely disseminated to speckled pyrite (specks up to several mm size) throughout, in average amounting to an estimated ~ 2
%, locally and in sections (for example from ~ 71 to 76? m) amounting to > 4 % and very rarely (for example at 76.8 m) as partially patchy stringer and

identified in a dark green grey (chlorititic?) and light green grey (sericitic?) matrix. The lapilli appear to be lithic, are very hard and resemble a rhyolite.
Sericite and chlorite occur within the matrix as patchy, irregular or swirly - wispy, partially veinlet resembling enrichments, which add to the mottled, irregular
appearance of the interval.  At 87.3 m prominent tectonic breccia textures with angular to irregular shaped, mm up to several cm sized fragments of host
rock embedded in white, carbonate bearing vein mineralisation.
Lower contact is distinct and gradational over few cm, no plane.

100.50, 114.70
Rhyolite Debris Flow: Very heterogeneous interval, with highly siliceous, pale pinkish cream coloured sections, up to ~ m size - rhyolite fragments. Polylithic,
smaller fragments (lapilli to bomb sized) are abundant throughout the interval in a dark brown grey - dark green grey, chloritized matrix. The fragments have
not well defined blurry margins, and are variably intensly broken and nerved with dark green, highly chlorite bearing veinlets and stringers; locally this
interval grades into a rhyolite flow breccia. The majority of the dark brown to dark green grey, ashy sections still bear up to 50% of lapilli sized fragments,
predominantly light coloured and variably intensly brecciated, resulting in an overall very intensively mottled to blotchy to spotted appearance to the interval.
Light green, soft patches of assumed to be sericite (similar to sericite alteration described at  80.2 - 82.7 m), particularly within ash rich sections and patches
and to the mottled appearance.  Within ~ 5 m of lower contact, there is a significant amount (estimated > 30 %) of patches with colours and textures, which
have been assumed to be diorite before. The patches appear to have both sharp and not well defined margins. As a result of broken core within this
subsection it is impossible to determine, whether these patches are dikes or fragments. At 114.3 - 114.5 a (pseudo?) fragmental texture, which is very
reminiscent of 90.2 - 90.4 m, with a razor sharp lower contact @ 50° to CA. This interval with very minor (<< 2 %), mostly disseminated pyrite specks. There
is a faint trend, with pyrite occurring preferably within chloritic veinlets and stringers within the larger felsic fragments. The mostly sub mm sized, rarely
several mm sized specks rarely grade into faintly developed clouds. Ash rich sections bear minor disseminated carbonate, locally grading into whitish
irregular, carbonate bearing, variably orientated veinlets and stringers, rarely > mm width.
Lower contact is sharp, @ 80° to CA, with lack of larger intermediate and/or felsic fragments.

114.70, 143.30
Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: Heterogeneous interval, with highly siliceous, pale pinkish cream coloured sections, up to ~ m size - boulder sized rhyolite
fragments. Polylithic, smaller fragments (lapilli to bomb sized) are abundant throughout the entire interval and are embedded in a dark brown grey - dark
green grey, chloritized matrix. The fragments have not well defined, blurry margins, and are nerved with dark green, highly chlorite bearing veinlets and
stringers - brecciated; locally this interval grades into a rhyolite flow breccia. The majority of the dark brown to dark green grey, ashy sections still bear up to
50% of lapilli sized fragments, predominantly light coloured and variably intensly brecciated, resulting in an overall very intensively mottled to blotchy to
spotted appearance to the interval. Light green, soft patches of assumed to be sericite (similar to sericite alteration described at  80.2 - 82.7 m), particularly

From here downwards, the strong alteration fades out into a dm wide section, which is similar to above described lithology and then grades
into a 2 dm wide subsection with a very prominent fragmental texture: Sub mm - several cm sized, sub round to lenticular, dark grey
fragments (which are very similar to above described ash) are embedded in a very fine grained, light grey - locally yellowish matrix and
aligned to a foliation @ ~ 30o to CA. This subsection may be interpreted as a muddy interbed with lapilli sized fragments(?) or an alteration
related pattern(?).

Rhyolite Ash Tuff: Dark brown to dark brown grey, very fine grained, dense, massive, +/-  featureless ashy interbed. Few, light grey, carbonate bearing
stringers and wisps. Few ghostly outlined and only slightly lighter coloured lapilli, up to > 5 mm size.  Speckled, wispy pyrite (mostly sub mm sized, rarely up
to several mm) amounts to ~ 2 - 3 %.  Lower contact is sharp and distinct, @ 60° to CA (bedding).  In places where rock is less altered can see 3-4% very
fine-grained dark green mafic phenocrysts << 1 mm disseminated throughout.  These are altered to chlorite and sometimes contain pyrite. From 132.8 to
150.5 the mafic phenocrysts are much larger (to 3 mm) and appear to be biotite.

144.10, 152.40
Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: Cream to light green grey and dark green grey to dark brown grey, spotted to mottled rhyolitic lapilli ash tuff with a variable to very
prominent fragmental texture (in sections up to > m width) grading into medium grained, dense sections, up to > m width. The medium grained dense
sections are reminiscent of intervals, which have been logged as diorite before and the fragmental sections are very reminiscent of 141.3 - 144.05m, with
locally better developed fragmental textures. The transitions from the denser, medium grained sections and the fragmental sections suggest this interval to
be a sequence of rhyolite lapilli ash tuffs.  At 146.4 - 146.5 have ~ dm wide, ashy interbeds supporting the interpretation of this interval being a pyroclastic
(upper contact of ashy interbed @ steep angle to CA, lower contact of ashy interbed @ ~ 60° to CA).  Interval bears minor disseminated carbonate and
minor carbonate bearing hairline veinlets.  Locally and particularly at 145.3 m have up to ~ cm wide, irregular, swirly to planar, light grey to whitish, highly
carbonate bearing veinlets and veins with chloritic halos.  Based on the colour the interval is assumed to contain chlorite throughout.  Abundance of
irregular, light green sericitic patches is decreasing in comparison to overlying intervals. Disseminated to speckled pyrite is similar in abundance and
distribution to overlying intervals (~ 3%).

Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: Intensively broken core with a variable dark green grey to pale green grey, variably mottled to blotchy to spotted appearance.
Difficult to identify rock type due to broken nature of core. The observed textures are reminiscent to underlying intervals and textures, which were interpreted
as rhyolitic volcaniclastics in other holes (in particular GE05-01). Weathered bed rock and/ or talus? At 8.8 m is highly siliceous , ~ 2 dm sized, dirty olive
green grey, flow brecciated appearing, presumably rhyolitic? fragment?, suggesting a Rhyolite Lapill-Ash tuff.

9.10, 16.00
Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: This interval broken out based on alteration textures, which +/- obliterate primary textures. Locally presumably primary colours and
textures can be observed, which are reminiscent to rhyolite lapilli ash tuffs (up to several mm sized, sub round to round, rarely angular to irregular, light
coloured, hard lapilli? in a dark green grey, fine grained matrix).  However, the majority of primary textures is obliterated by light olive green grey, swirly to
irregular patchy, very soft and somewhat dull appearing, possibly sericite bearing(?) clay mineral bearing(?) patches. The dark coloured patches (textures
described above), which presumably escaped the light green alteration are also soft (except the siliceous lapilli, which are embedded), but significantly
harder, than the light green patches.  From 9.1 - 9.5 m, few re-healed fracture planes with a rusty orange coating and rusty orange halo, up to ~ cm wide; no
fizz with HCL. Darker coloured patches are highly chloritic. Locally finely disseminated, accessory pyrite.
Lower contact is sharp and marked by broken core, no plane.

16.00, 26.40
Rhyolite Debris Flow: Dirty cream to light olive green grey - dark green grey, blotchy rhyolite debris flow. Core is +/- intensively broken, which makes it
somewhat difficult to observe lithology, but locally up to several dm sized , dense, generally very fine grained, light green - slightly pinkish cream,
presumably rhyolitic fragments with variably well defined margins can be observed. No sorting.  The bomb to boulder sized fragments constitute the majority
of this interval, amounting to > 50 % with inter spaces filled with dark green grey, chloritic, presumably ashy material, which contains abundant lapilli sized
and presumably rhyolitic fragments (reminiscent in colour and texture to bomb to and boulder sized fragments. Generally the felsic fragments are dense and
featureless, locally they display dark green to black, +/- rectangular, +/- elongated, up to several mm sized outlines, presumably chloritized feldspar. Part of
the larger, felsic fragments are nerved with dark green, highly chlorite bearing and locally carbonate bearing (rarely also rusty orange iron bearing carbonate)
wispy hairline veinlets and stringers, which frequently do not crosscut the margins of the fragments, which may indicate a certain degree of flow brecciation.
However, partially not well defined fragment margins (which indicate flow brecciation themselves) and fracturing of core make it difficult to confirm this trend.
The patchy softness of the material, frequently associated with light greenish tint suggests a significant sericite(?) content. Locally finely disseminated
speckled pyrite and locally displayed pyrite bearing hairline veinlets amount to accessory pyrite.
Lower contact is gradational over ~ 1 m, no plane.

26.40, 60.50
Rhyolite Laplli Tuff: Dark green grey to light olive green grey, spotted to mottled, with up to ~ dm sized, rarely up to several dm sized, cream to dirty light
green grey, predominantly not well defined (blurry margins), rarely well defined (for example at 38.9 m), presumably rhyolitic fragments in a dark green grey,
presumably highly chloritic matrix, which contains abundant (>25 %) predominantly sub rounded to rounded, whitish lapilli (crystal lapilli?), also of rhyolitic
composition(?).  The larger fragments within this interval are less abundant than within the overlying interval and amount to an estimated 25 %?  The light
coloured, presumably rhyolitic patches and fragments very frequently display +/- rectangular, black phenocrysts, presumably chloritized feldspar. With the
white spots (lapilli within the matrix) in the black patches and the black spots (chloritized feldspar in flow brecciated(?) rhyolite fragments(?)) in this interval
which intensify the mottled and spotted appearance. Because of the poorly defined margins of the larger fragments this interval is tentatively logged as
rhyolite flow breccia. The interval displays few magnetic patches within matrix in rich, dark coloured patches.  Based on softness and colour the matrix is
assumed to contain abundant chlorite.  Irregular, light green and soft patches are assumed to be the result of sericite(?) and chlorite(?). Locally up to > mm
wide, green, highly chloritic (sericitic?), variably orientated veinlets. Minor disseminated carbonate.  Disseminated tospeckled pyrite < 2 %.  Locally a very
faintly developed foliation @ ~ 60° to CA. No sorting.
Lower contact is gradational over several m, +/- arbitrarily chosen, based on decreasing amount of (flow brecciated) bomb and boulder sized fragments. No
plane.

Rhyolite Lapilli-Ash Tuff: Cream to light green grey and dark green grey to dark brown grey spotted to mottled rhyolite lapilli ash tuff, locally with a faint to +/-
discrete fragmental texture (70.7 m), but predominantly medium grained and dense. Similr to GE05-01 from 144.05 - 152.4 m and 141.3 - 144.05m and
textures that were partially assumed to be of dioritic nature within the upper intervals of GE05-01.  Also this interval is very similar to the overlying interval,
with the exception of bomb and boulder sized fragments that are rare to entirely lacking.
Bottom 6 m is very distinct, dark brown, very fine grained interbed(?) vein(?) with angular to sub round, up to several mm sized, whitish, siliceous (quartz)
inclusions @ 65° to CA, there is a textural change within up to several dm wide sections: Within a light green grey to dirty cream grey groundmass
embedded are sub round to irregular, mostly several mm sized black spots amount to > 10 % and are predominantly quite hard (polylith fragments(?),
alteration pattern indicating chloritization and silicification(?). Also within this subsection an increase of patchy, sericite and chlorite bearing veinlets,
associated with a somewhat increased pyrite content and a yellowish speckled mineral resembling leucoxene (sericite?). At 76.2 a 2 dm sized clear cut
rhyolite fragment with minor fault gauge and minor slickenslides near upper contact plane @ 50° to CA.
light green sericite enrichments are scattered throughout and amount to an estimated > 5 %, generally harder and more siliceous(?) than overlying intervals
and significant amount of chlorite. Only very minor carbonate, partially disseminated, partially within chlorite bearing(?) hairline veinlets. Disseminated to
speckled pyrite and pyrite within chlorite bearing veinlets is very rare, amounting accessory.
Lower contact is marked by bleaching downwards to very light green grey and increasingly broken core.

Fault: Intensly broken core with silty to fine gravely, partially ductile, light olive green grey to light grey, mostly < dm wide, gauged zones.
Locally the gauge is still in place but crumbles easily when picked up. Majority of primary textures are obliterated by bleaching to a dirty
cream grey to olive green grey discolouration. Very soft and highly chlorite bearing.  Locally a very discrete, green spotted appearance.
Locally up to several mm wide, variably orientated, green chlorite veinlets.  Fracture planes are variably orientated, partially associated with
slickenslides, but the direction of 40° to CA appears to be predominant.  Locally up to a several cm wide, dark grey, highly siliceous,
carbonate bearing and presumably minor albite bearing veins.  Dark colour is possibly the result of disseminated sulphides(?).
Lower contact marked by decreasingly broken core associated with gradual fading out of bleached discolouration. No plane.

83.80, 116.20
Rhyolite Debris Flow: This interval generally very reminiscent to 60.5 - 76.5m, with whitish, sub round to round to irregular shaped, up to several mm sized
(crystal?) lapilli in a dark green grey, presumably highly chloritic, fine grained matrix. Locally a faintly to +/- obvious developed fragmental texture and up to >
3 m long sections of a dense, diorite resembling texture as described before. A very distinct feature of this interval is a ~ dm up to ~ 7 dm sized clear cut
fragments of fine grained, aphanitic, dense, cream to grey to beige grey rhyolite, partially associated with slickenslides along their contact planes @ ~ 45° to
CA. Sections bearing patchy sericite as described before. Interval contains abundant chlorite, shown by green colour of the ashy matrix and also as variably
orientated, +/- irregular, up to > mm wide veinlets (chlorite bearing veinlets/ hairline stringers occur within the felsic fragments/ patches as well, but are
considerably finer). Carbonate occurs disseminated and in the form of light coloured mineralisation within variably orientated hairline wisps, stringers and
veinlets with a predominant orientation of 40° to CA.  At 98.8 m have a ~ 4 cm wide, bright white, bright white carbonate and +/- quartz(?) bearing vein @
40° to CA with up to several cm sized, angular to sub round inclusions of host rock. The amount of carbonate within this interval appears to be somewhat
higher than within the overlying intervals. The amount of pyrite (disseminated to speckled to rarely as hairline veinlet) appears to be somewhat increased as
well but still estimated to be < 2 %.

116.20, 123.10
Plagioclase Porphyry Dyke: Light olive green grey feldspar porphyry intrusion (dike or sill?), with up to > 3 mm sized, white, subhedral to euhedral feldspar
phenocrysts in an aphanitic light green grey matrix. The majority of the interval also displays partially elongated, dark green to black, sub mm up to several
mm sized spots, which shape is partially reminiscent to feldspar phenocrysts. They are interpreted to be chloritized feldspar. Quartz eyes are very few and
far apart and not certainly identified.  From 117.3 - 120.4m intensively fractured core, with a prominently preferred orientation of fracture planes sub parallel
to CA.  Fracture planes frequently display a thin +/- chlorite, +/- iron oxide bearing coating.  Few, variably orientated (preferably @ 20° - 40° to CA) highly
pyrite bearing hairline veinlets.

104.90, 107.80
Fault: This fault zone is reminiscent to the fault zone described at 76.5 - 83.8 m, with up to ~ dm sized, clayey ductile to fine gravely gauged
zones within a bleached/ light green grey discoloured rock. The material is highly chlorite bearing and fault related alteration obliterates
primary textures to a large extend. However, up to several dm sized, cream grey, dense, aphanitic rhyolite fragments can be identified,
suggesting similar/ same protolith as overlying interval. Fracture planes with slickensides and fracture planes constituting the margins of
gauged zones @ ~ 45° to CA.
Lower contact marked by decreasingly broken core and decreasingly bleached/ discoloured appearance, no plane.

Very altered porphyritic rock. @ 169.67m-169.93m the rock is severly altered forming chalky, calcite rich, poorly endurated rock. From
169.93m-170.22m the alteration is less pervasive, the rock is more competent but the matrix is severly bleached. Minor veinlets and fracture
mineralization of anhedral pyrrhotite +/- and unknown mineral (=<1% over interval).  45% mostly calcite veins.  Minor sopradic sulphides by
veinlets and fractures as very small masses.

170.84, 178.55
5-15% PY, Trace CPY in veinlets, along fxs, and as semi-massive patches within altered matrix..  Last 18cm's is altered, matrix is bleached.

179.71, 181.59
Abundant chaotic stringers - 30%, mostly quartz.   Rock appears to have formerly been brecciated (perhaps during silicification of veins?).
Nice mineralization from 179.83m-180.14m-- mostly present as semi-massive patches of pyrrhotite in matrix but also as veinlets along micro-
fractures. 10% pyrite, 2% CPY and unknown mineral.  Some sporadic mineralization elsewhere within the core.

184.93, 185.03

Overburden

2.70, 4.50
Massive Rhyolite: Intensively broken core: weathered bed rock. Fracture planes @ variable orientation to CA, predominantly sub parallel and @ steep angle
(65° to > 80°) to CA.  Lithology similar and/or the same as underlying interval; no detailed description because of broken core.  Lower contact gradational, +/-
arbitrarily chosen with decreasingly broken core.

4.50, 25.65
Massive Rhyolite: Cream - very light olive green grey - pale beige and partially strongly rusty stained (halos enveloping veinlets and healed fractures),
predominantly aphanitic to very fine grained, very hard rhyolite. Distinct quartz eyes, up to several mm size, can be identified, amounting to << 1%. Slightly
chlorite and/or epidote bearing suggested by a weakly developed) greenish tint. Very rarely anhedral to euhedral feldspar phenocrysts, up to several mm
size (eg 7.9 m). Variably intensely speckled with light green - black appearing mineral aggregates from sub mm to ~ 3 mm size (rarely), which amount to 0 <
3 %, beleived to be chloritized feldspar.  The interval is intensively nerved with variably orientated, partially re-healed fracture planes, creating a 3
dimensional network with mesh from < cm scale to rarely ~ dm scale, resulting in a shattered appearance. The fractures are partially re-healed, forming
mostly sub mm wide, very rarely up to 3 mm wide, +/- vuggy veinlets. Because of the small size the vein mineralization is difficult to identify, but
mineralization appears to be composed of quartz, chlorite and iron oxides, epidote(?), clay minerals (illite ?). Open fractures often have an intensively rusty
red - black coating. Frequently the veinlets are enveloped with mm to > cm wide rusty coloured halo, sometimes grading into +/- pervasive rusty
discolouration, for example at 16 - 16.8 m. At 18.4 m dark coloured, unknown mineral aggregates, presumably as part of the vein mineralization, ~ cm sized.
Possibly these aggregates are composed of sulphides? Minor pyrite mineralization (~ 2 mm sized crystal) can be detected in nearby, ~ 4 mm wide, dense,
light grey quartz vein. At 23.6 m there is ~ cm wide chlorite(?) bearing quartz(?) vein, which has dark grey - black, up to several cm sized patches, which are
assumed to be finely disseminated sulphides. Lower contact: Marked by increasingly broken core, no plane.

25.65, 37.30
Rhyolite Breccia: ~ 50 % of this interval consists off intensely broken core. The lithology of these sections appears to be similar/ possibly the same as in
overlying interval. Larger, non broken rhyolite pieces with a shattered appearance, caused by a very fine meshed (several mm scale), sub mm wide veinlets.
The less intensely broken sections display predominantly angular - sub round - rarely rounded, mm to ~ dm sized rhyolite fragments (as described above),
which are cemented together by a considerably softer, very fine grained, rarely beige and predominantly rusty red (iron oxide bearing) matrix. The material is
variably clast supported or matrix supported. Up to > dm sized patches with a highly porous appearance as a result of inter spaces between breccia
fragments not entirely filled with matrix/ cement (from now on referred to as incomplete cementation). The fracture planes of this interval with rusty red (Fe-
oxides- or hydroxides) or yellow - greenish (chlorite?, jarosite?, limonite?) coating. Lower contact: Sharp, marked by significantly less broken and shattered
core, lack of brecciation, no plane.

37.30, 39.60
Massive Rhyolite: Rhyolite, similar/ same as described at 4.5 - 25.65. Lower contact gradational, marked by increasingly shattered appearance as described
above and brecciation, partially incompletely cemented as described above.

39.60, 43.30
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Near upper contact and the first ~ 0.8 m downwards from upper contact, this interval very similar to 25.65 - 37.3, with shattered
and brecciated rhyolite (brecciated sections are partially incompletely cemented) but with quartz-tennantite vein material cementing breccia fragments. From
40.35 m downwards there are significant lithological changes, which are believed to be fault related and therefore described as nested intervals.
From 40.35 - 41.5 m - Light olive green grey - beige rhyolite, greenish sections with bleached appearance +/- elongated cavities as a result of not completely
mineralised veinlets. Cavities with a light green coating (chl ?), epidote(?) or more likely jarosite(?). Interval is shattered as a result of a very fine meshed (<
cm scale) veinlet network (veinlets mostly sub mm wide, rarely up to ~ 4 mm). Variable orientationof veinlets. Mineralization of fractures is not always
complete, resulting in veinlets appearing partially as open cracks or elongated cavities. The vein mineralization is mostly quartz, possibly also chlorite? or
epidote?. There are few, several cm sized patches with matrix supported tectonic breccia. Fragments from ~ mm - ~ cm size. Lower contact: Sharp, distinct,
based on colour change towards grey.
From 41.5 - 43.3 m - Mauve - purple - dark grey silica flooded breccia, slightly translucent, increasingly darker coloured downwards. The textures is very
similar to 40.35 - 41.5, however the colours are very different. The purple - dark grey colour of the silica is possibly the result of finely dissem sulphides.
Veinlets vary from blue - dark grey - dark green. Veinlet mineralization < 3 % pyrite and arsenopyrite. The interval is flooded with silica, or that silica at least
was remobilised after solidification. Presumably the sulphides were introduced to the material as part of the same event. Lower contact very distinct and
sharp, @ 15° to CA.

43.30, 48.10
Rhyolite Breccia: Brecciated rhyolite as in 25.65 to 37.3 m.  Slight variation in interval as indicated below.
From 43.3 - 44.2 m - Tectonic breccia, with variably coloured  (cream, light olive green grey, dark grey, mauve - purple),  mm - several cm sized, variably
angular - rarely sub round - very rarely rounded, variably intense silicified rhyolite fragments in a light green grey - beige , very hard, very fine - fine grained
matrix. Matrix supported near upper contact, grading into increasingly fragment supported near lower contact. Cementation decreases from 100 % near
upper contact to 25% pore space near lower contact. Cavities are coated with a light green - light coloured, fine granular botryoidal mineral (clay mineral?).
Lower contact sharp @ 30 ° to CA.
From 44.2 - 45.75 m - Patches and small sections (up to > dm size) in sharp contact with similar sized patches and sections of rhyolite as described at 4.5 -
25.65. ~ 20 cm wide brecciated and incompletely cemented breccia zone (as described at 25.65 - 37.3 near lower contact. Lower contact sharp @ 30° to
CA.
From 45.75 - 47.95 - Interval with a somewhat uncertain origin: Light coloured, greenish grey - beige grey, mm - several cm sized, predominantly rounded
rhyolite fragments in a brown grey, locally dark grey matrix (grey patches with minor pyrite- and other sulphide specks); generally matrix supported. Overall
this interval is relatively dense and massive, only few veinlets/ fractures  (partially to incompletely mineralised as described before). Few rusty red tinted
patches and faintly developed rusty red halos enveloping part of the veinlets. Several cm wide, highly porous (as a result of incomplete mineralization)
brecciated sections with mm up to ~ cm sized, angular rhyolite fragments (fragment supported with cement almost entirely lacking) is orientated @ 20° to CA
and located ~ 20 cm upwards from lower contact. Lower contact indistinct, sharp, presumably @ ~ 65° to CA.

48.10, 51.25
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Cloudy white to translucent grey quartz vein filling brecciated rhyolite fragments. Locally sub mm sized, occasional finely
disseminated sulphides. The grey colour is assumed to be the result of disseminated arsenopyrite. Sulphide bearing veins and veinlets from sub mm to > ~ 2
cm width. The veins are mostly dense, rarely vuggy, locally sheeted and are estimated to ~ 3 - 5 %, with density down hole. The vein mineralization is
primarily composed of quartz with variable amounts of mostly disseminated (only locally up to ~ cm sized aggregates), dark grey arsenopyrite with minor
pyrite and minor amounts of chlorite. Generally the veins are variably orientated, but the prominently preferred orientation is @ ~ 30° to CA and parallel to
previously described cracks and mostly sub mm wide veinlets, which are +/- enveloped by rusty red halos. A portion of the veins and veinlets displays the
same rusty coloured halos.
From 49.0 to 51.25 m is very similar to 41.5 - 43.3 with a mauve - purple - grey colour and translucent appearance as a result silica flooding (remobilisation).
The colour of this sub section is less dark and it displays less of the highly irregular blue - dark grey - green patches and stringers. Short sections of several
cm length, which are vuggy to highly vuggy and associated with a locally very high (> 50 %?) sulphide content. Some minor pyrite can be identified, but the
majority of the material is dark grey, with grey streak, presumably tennantite. The lower contact is lost in broken core, but the very high silica content and the
lack of volcanic textures possibly suggests this sub section to be a sulphide bearing quartz vein. Upper contact is sharp, @ ~ 35° to CA, associated with a
greyish halo extending for ~ 2 dm into the overlying unit. Lower contact is associated with sheeted veins and veinlets of mm up to ~ cm width @ ~ 30° to CA.
Both, upper and lower contact are associated with epidote? coating and very light coloured clay(?) minerals on fracture planes.

51.25, 64.17
Quartz-Arsenopyrite sheeted Vein in Rhyolite: Similar to the lithology of the rest of this interval; but with a somewhat more beige colour and a significantly
higher degree of veining: +/- sheeted quartz veins, predominantly with a low sulphide content, predominantly @ 30° to CA, amount to an estimated 25 % at
the top decreasing to 3 to 4 % at the bottom of the interval. At 53.95 m a ~ 3 cm wide sulphide +/- quartz vein (tennantite content estimated to be > 75 % of
the vein) @ ~ 35° to CA.  Down to 61.9 m estimate tennantite content to be 7%. From there down estimate < 2%.

From 61.9 - 64.17 m - Some textural changes within the rhyolite within this sub section, presumably as a result of alteration: The green and black coloured
spots fade out until they are entirely lacking. The colour changes towards cream grey - light grey; material with a somewhat waxy appearance. The rock
bears a cream - yellow white, dull mineral, which is variably finely disseminated to dusty speckled to mottled (dots and small, ~ cm sized, rounded patches).
Spots and speckles with a very faintly developed alignment @ 40 - 60° to CA. The last ~ 10 cm of the drill core are very intensively broken (majority of core
pieces is ~ cm sized), possibly indicating a fault?
Upper contact of this subsection gradational over ~ 1 m.

Overburden: Casing

0.50, 1.80
Massive Rhyolite: Intensively broken core: weathered bed rock. Fracture planes @ variable orientation to CA, predominantly sub parallel, @ steep angle and
@ 50 - 60° to CA. Lithology similar/ same as underlying interval; no detailed description because of broken core. Lower contact: Gradational, +/- arbitrarily
chosen with +/- less broken core.

1.80, 40.30
Massive Rhyolite: Cream - very light olive green grey - pale beige and partially strongly rusty stained (halos enveloping veinlets and healed fractures),
predominantly aphanitic - fine grained, very hard rhyolite. Same as the rhyolite described in TAN05-01. < 1% Quartz eyes to several mm. Minor chlorite and/
or epidote indicated by a locally faintly developed greenish colour. Rare anhedral feldspar phenocrysts. Variably to 2 % light green to black, sub mm to rarely
> mm mineral aggregates in an aphanitic, light coloured ground mass. Intensely broken core interval as a result of dense meshed (cm to ~ dm scale),
variably orientated, partially re-healed fracture planes, which are frequently enveloped by rusty coloured halos up to several cm width. Some of the veinlets
are re-healed to form sub mm to several mm wide veinlets. Veinlet mineralisation assumed to be +/- quartz (+/- vuggy), iron oxides, +/- chlorite?, +/- a finely
disseminated, dark grey mineral (arsenopyrite?), +/- a hard(?) pistachio green mineral (epidote?) and a downwards increasingly abundant yellow green -
whitish, very soft mineral coating on fracture planes, - clay mineral and/ or a mixture of clay minerals and chlorite?. Locally the veinlets display clearly
identifiable mostly anhedral to subhedral, ~ mm sized sulphide specks with a metallic luster (presumably pyrite). At ~ 18.6 m to ~ 29.3 m the veinlets are
slightly wider and grade into partially zoned, partially vuggy, sulphide bearing (py, aspy) quartz veins of up to several cm width, for example at 19.9 m, 20.8
m, 21.2 m and 19.6 m. The sulphide content in the irregular veins is up to 30%. Generally the vein mineralisation appears to consist of the same minerals as
the veinlets described above, but quartz and sulphide content appear to be higher, chlorite and clay minerals and others appear to be less abundant. From
18.6 - 21.3 m the sulphide bearing veins are estimated to amount to > 5 %. Vein material is estimated to amount to < 2 % down to ~ 40 m.

40.30, 41.60
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Variably yellow green grey - purple grey - dark grey (increasingly darker coloured near and within the centre of the interval and
increasingly lighter coloured near upper and lower contact) with purple grey, somewhat translucent patches and partially highly irregular, pinching and
elongated, purple grey, translucent outlines (veins?, veinlets?, sheeted veins?, stockwork resembling). The translucent appearance of the purple grey parts
of the rock is assumed to be the result of quartz flooding and/or quartz veining. The interval is highly siliceous and purple grey coloured (presumably as a
result of disseminated tennantite), partially vuggy - porous (pores from sub mm to > cm sized) and strongly resembles quartz vein mineralisation. This sub
section displays variably orientated (sub parallel to ~ 30° to CA), patchy - irregular - tabular, mm - cm wide/ sized patches and bands of a distinct, blue green

mineral, which is frequently but not exclusively associated with vuggy to porous textures. This mineral is preliminary and tentatively interpreted as scorodite.
From 41.4 - 41.6 m have a highly porous and highly sulphide bearing  (+/- massive sulphide), irregular, sub cm to > cm wide, fine to medium grained
sulphide band, embedded within the quartz.

41.60, 43.60
Quartz-Arsenopyrite sheeted Vein in Rhyolite: 40% sheeted quartz-tennantite veins cutting through rhyolite.  Veins are purple grey, rhyolite is light green
grey mottled to patchy appearance, with the greenish parts of the rock interpreted to be altered  (fine grained, featureless and somewhat softer than
unaltered rhyolite), nerved by irregular, purple grey, variably orientated (frequently oblique angle to CA) tennantite bearing quartz veins.  Overall contains up
to 10% tennantite.
From 41.6 m downwards the vugs decrease from an estimated ~ 8 % to ~ < 3 %.

43.60, 45.80
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Quartz tennantite vein cutting brecciated rhyolite.  Contacts are not sharp and marked by abundant, angular rhyolite fragments.
Also numerous angular fragments of beige-grey to yellow-green rhyolite in the quartz vein.  Rhyolite is variably altered to soft – clay altered (yellow-green)
and to intensely silicified (glassy and grey). Quartz vein varies from cloudy white to translucent grey and contains up to 35% tennantite.  At 44.2 m have 10
cm of massive dark grey coarsely crystalline (but shattered crystals) tennantite, at 44.8 m have a 35 cm wide section of fairly massive tennantite. At 44.8 m
have a number of grey quartz veinlets cutting through massive tennantite – indicating a later quartz veining event. The lower contact of the interval is
gradational and grades into sheet quartz veins in rhyolite. The highly sulphide bearing sections/ patches predominantly with an orientation of ~ 30° to CA.

45.80, 48.10
Quartz-Arsenopyrite sheeted Vein in Rhyolite: Sheeted quartz veins in rhyolite with 20% quartz veining.  Quartz is translucent light grey coloured.  In places
it is slightly darker from very fine-grained sulphides, believed to be tennantite.  Estimate tennantite content to be 3 to 5%.
The sulphide content decreases down hole. The quartz content within these veins increases, but the veins become smaller, grade into veinlets and are
decreasingly abundant, resulting in overall decreasing quartz content. Quartz veins @ oblique angle to CA. Upper contact is sharp and fairly distinct, @ 40°
to CA. Lower contact is based on colour change of rhyolite from light green to light grey, cream grey, beige grey. It is irregular, and at  15° to CA. The
rhyolite in this interval is clay altered and yellow-green-grey coloured.  Rhyolite is much less clay altered away from sheeted veins.

48.10, 60.03
Massive Rhyolite: From ~ 48 m downwards the quartz vein and tennantite content decreases significantly and are even lacking throughout portions of the
lower part of the interval. Only scattered specks (accessory amounts) of tennantite (or the grey mineral, which is believed to be tennantite) can be detected.
Sulphide bearing veins are estimated to amount to << 1 % from 48 – 60.03 m. Mineralized veinlets and veins of several mm widths or more are rare in
comparison to the section up hole from 40.27 - 48.1 m. However fractures and healed fractures, resulting in sub mm to ~ mm wide veinlets are equally
common and very reminiscent to the veinlets described within the interval above and result in a shattered appearance and/ or broken core.

60.03, 76.30
Rhyolite Breccia: Sections of intensively broken core (partially gravely) alternating with sections of relatively undisturbed rhyolite as described above and
sections with a shattered appearance as a result of very fine meshed (partially < cm scale)  healed fracture planes and small (up to dm sized) gouge
sections (slightly silty, sandy - fine gravely fault gouge)]. Shattered  appearance and gouge are often closely associated, for example at 67.8 m and 69.7 m.
Locally the gauged sections are preserved in core as angular, ~ mm to cm sized rhyolite fragments in a rusty red - orange whitish (iron oxides and clay
minerals?) or light green grey - pale grey (chlorite?, clay minerals?) fine grained, very soft matrix. Matrix supported. For example at 67. 8 m; 69.7 m and 76.3
m (lower contact). Gouged zones oriented @ 40° - 50° to CA. Upper contact is sharp, chosen where gouge becomes apparent and broken core. Lower
contact is sharp, with gouge apparent and disappearing downwards, oriented @ 40° to CA.

76.30, 121.90
Massive Rhyolite: Rhyolite becomes more massive and homogeneous, although still quite fractured, with fractures approximately every 5 to 7 cm.  Where
fractured there is abundant orange-beige iron oxide staining and limonite on fracture surfaces.  Rare to <<1% quartz-arsenopyrite veining. From 98.45 m
downwards, colour change to dirty green brown grey and dirty orange brown grey from 103.6 m- 109.4 m, also core is shattered as a result of mostly sub
mm wide, rarely up to ~ 2 mm wide, partially irregular, partially tabular, variably orientated veinlets. The veinlets are whitish - predominantly dark green grey,
rarely orange within the greenish brown section and predominantly orange within the pinkish orange coloured section. Spacing of the veinlets varies from
sub cm scale - rarely > dm scale; veinlets are estimated to amount to < 3 %. Mineral content is difficult to determine, because of the small size, but there
appears to be some quartz (white). The darker coloured vein mineralisation seems to be quite soft (chlorite?). The orange colour is assumed to be the

caused by iron oxides and clay minerals, probably a mix thereof. Every several m  (estimated at an average spacing of 3 m) there are ~ cm to ~ dm wide ,
brecciated and re-cemented zones (breccia veins), with angular to sub round, mm to several mm sized, very rarely up to several cm sized fragments in a
greenish grey - rusty orange grey, variably soft (clay minerals and iron oxide) - predominantly hard (quartz) matrix. Breccia veins variably clast supported or
matrix supported. Breccia veins indicate faulting. From 113.3 m the core becomes lighter grey with 7% dark green to black disseminated mafic minerals to 1
mm.  They appeared to be chloritized and often have a small spec of pyrite in them. The rock becomes much more siliceous with traces of very fine-grained
pyrite. Quartz-sulphide veinlet concentration dramatically drops off towards the end of the hole.  Generally they only occur as microscopic fractured fillings.
Fractures also filled with dark green chlorite (?).

Massive Rhyolite: Casing

0.50, 24.60
Massive Rhyolite: Fine-grained, varies form orange-beige to light grey-beige, occasionally with 5% dark green to black fine-grained disseminated mafic
minerals to 0.5 mm. Top 10.5 m is quite fractured and stained orange due to weathering. Fractures have a deep red to black, wafer thin, iron oxide coating.
Some fractures healed by iron oxide. Fractures generally at 65o to core axis. < 1% of fractures have grey quartz vein filling, generally vuggy at the top of the
hole – believed to be caused by weathering out of sulphides (estimate 5% of material weathered out). Overall the unit contains < 1% very fine-grained
disseminated sulphide (pyrite?). From 10.5 m to 12.0 m the unit is less weathered, light grey and massive with lesser mafic minerals and is very hard and
siliceous. From 12.0 to 18.0 m the rhyolite is becomes more orange-beige, although not as intense as in the top of the hole.  Coloration is due to iron oxide
on fractures and staining along the margins of fractures.  In areas of grey rhyolite the rhyolite contains approximately 8% pervasive clay altered minerals
disseminated throughout.  The clay is light grey to green and appears to be after mafic minerals. Fracturing of core id fairly rhythmic at approximately 1 per 8
cm. At 18.0 m have a 0.5 cm wide quartz-arsenopyrite vein oriented at 10o to core axis (i.e. Running along the core). Below that see the occasional hairline
veinlets with dark grey sulphide in them.

24.60, 26.20
Rhyolite Breccia: Variably brecciated zone, gradational contact at the top and bottom. Angular to sub-rounded fragments, well healed with a limonitic clay
and rare grey quartz. < 1% very fine grained to aphanitic sulphide in the breccia matrix and quartz. Mottled orange-beige and beige-grey color. Abundant
limonite on fractures and in breccia matrix.

26.20, 35.80
Massive Rhyolite: As described in 0.5 to 24.6 m. Variable light grey-beige to orange-beige, with mottled orange coloration prominent along fractures.
Fractures generally coated with limonite or well healed with limonite cement and occurring 1 per 8 cm.  Fractures generally at 65o to core axis. Occasional
grey section of rhyolite exhibits relic quartz eyes to 1-2 mm.  Quartz eyes are weathered, fractured and cloudy grey. Interval contains <1% quartz-
arsenopyrite veins up to 2 mm wide. From 35.0 to 35.8 m unit is slightly brecciated and healed with limonitic clay. Lower contact with quartz vein is
gradational and marked where vein density noticeably increases. Veins oriented at 25o to core axis.

35.80, 37.50
Quartz-Arsenopyrite sheeted Vein in Rhyolite: Gradational upper contact of quartz vein. 50% grey quartz-arsenopyrite veins and 50% brecciated, bleached,
silicified rhyolite fragments. Veins are up to 2 cm wide and occur 1 per 2 to 4 cm. Rhyolite fragments are angular with <1mm quartz-filled micro-fractures.
Quartz vein material contains variable amounts of pyrite and arsenopyrite (?). Overall interval contains ~7% arsenopyrite. In the middle of the interval the
rhyolite is moderately silicified and certain minerals in the rhyolite have been altered to clay.  It has the appearance of a hard, grey silica-rich rock with about
15% soft white-green clayey spots generally <1 mm. In the bottom 0.4 m the rhyolite is intensely clay altered and the interval is light grey-green color.  Color
may be due to a white-green clay mineral, or mixed clay and chlorite (?)+/- epidote (?).

Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Approximately 40% dark grey arsenopyrite and 60% quartz. Quartz varies from cloudy white to grey at the top of the interval to
translucent grey towards the bottom of the interval. Arsenopyrite is massive from 37.7 to 37.85 m, 38.1 to 38.84 m and 39.25 to 39.62 m. From 38.8 to 39.25
the sulphide and quartz is slightly brecciated with a light white-green and white clay matrix green color may be due to scorodite. Sulphide is variable from
fairly crystalline to fine granular masses. From 39.4 to 39.6 m it is quite fractured could be ground up from drilling, but overall the interval is fairly competent
with good recovery. Sulphide content drops off dramatically from 39.6 m to 41.0 m. In this section have variable light to medium grey translucent quartz with
slightly mottled appearance grey coloration believed to be due to aphanitic sulphides in quartz.  This interval has wispy 1 to 2 mm sulphide stringers with 2-
3% sulphides overall. Quartz is quite competent and has micro-fractures filled with a light white-green clayey mineral and medium green mineral (chlorite?).
Bottom contact is fairly sharp and distinct at 40o to core axis.

41.00, 46.10
Massive Rhyolite: Top 1 m is slightly fractured and beige-orange colored with 2% grey quartz veinlets to 1 mm wide. Veinlets are at 20 deg to core axis with
<< 1% very fine-grained sulphides. From there down the core becomes light to medium grey with 5% dark green to black, fine-grained, disseminated mafic
phenocrysts to 1 mm.  Many of the phenocrysts are altered to chlorite and often have a spec of pyrite in the altered core of the phenocrysts. Interval has the
occasional pyrite-chlorite stringer veinlet or fracture filling, overall <1% pyrite. Along the margins of fractures have a 0.5 cm rim of washy-looking white-green
alteration that may be chlorite. The occasional fracture has an intense iron oxide (limonite) coating. Fracture density is 1 per 15 cm with slightly more
towards the bottom contact with the breccia. Fractures at 30o to the core axis. Towards the bottom contact core becomes more beige colored with orange
fracture margins and red fracture coatings.

46.10, 46.60
Rhyolite Breccia: Bleached, brecciated rhyolite. Beige-orange, angular clasts of rhyolite with an orange limonitic clay cement. Angular fragments to 2 cm.
Interval is similar to interval from 24.6 m to 26.2 m. At the bottom 5 cm have medium grey quartz vein with 5% arsenopyrite as very fine-grained grey
sulphide mass. Overall interval contains 1% sulphide minerals. The vein marks the lower contact and is at 40o to the core axis.

46.40, 65.90
Massive Rhyolite: As in interval from 41.0 to 46.1 m. Top 1 m grades from beige-orange into light grey. Moderately fractured with 1 fracture per 10 to 15 cm.
Fractures are coated with deep red limonite and generally rimmed with an orange iron oxide alteration rim for 1 mm to 2-3 cm around fracture. Where the
rhyolite is not altered it contains 2 to 5% dark green to black mafic phenocrysts which are < 1mm and are altered to chlorite and pyrite. Overall, interval
contains <1% disseminated pyrite and up to 1% fracture controlled pyrite. Occasional grey quartz vein/veinlet to 3 mm wide containing 2 to 20%
arsenopyrite. Overall interval contains 1% arsenopyrite, 1 to 2%  quartz veinlets. This interval occasionally becomes slightly brecciated, such as from 51.3 to
51.4 m, 56.8 to 57.1 m, 58.1 to 58.25 m and 58.6 to 59.1 m. At 59.0 m have 1 cm wide of clayey gouge (fault?). Also slightly brecciated and vuggy from 63.5
to 67.6 m with rock variably, but slightly silicified with irregular 1 cm wide quartz-arsenopyrite vein at 66.1 m.

65.90, 79.30
Quartz-Arsenopyrite sheeted Vein in Rhyolite: 18% irregular, contorted to sheeted quartz-arsenopyrite veins in partially clay altered, partially (patchy)
pervasively silica flooded rhyolite. Quartz veins are cloudy white to translucent grey with as much as 50% arsenopyrite in the vein, however overall
tennantite content is estimated to be 7-8%. Traces of chalcopyrite observed in the arsenopyrite at 71.7 m and as spots in the rhyolite at 76.0 m. Also have
some pyrite in quartz-arsenopyrite veins at 71.4, 75.2, 75.8 and 76.3 m.  Overall only trace amounts of chalcopyrite and up to 1% pyrite. Rhyolite is weak to
moderately altered with 10 to 15% white clayey-sericite spots, pervasive, light green colour alteration of matrix (chlorite?), patchy silica flooding and in places
up to 5% dark green chlorite(?) spots to 0.8 cm round (such as from 74.7 to 76.6 m). Upper contact is somewhat gradational with fractured breccia and
limonite stained rhyolite. Lower contact is also gradational and marked by a decreasing density of quartz veins to <2% and generally < 0.5 cm wide.

79.30, 109.60
Massive Rhyolite: Upper contact is gradational and marked by 0.5 m of beige-grey rhyolite, which grades into fairly massive interval of light to medium grey
rhyolite with 1-2% fine-grained mafic phenocrysts and very fine-grained pyrite and < 1% quartz-sulphide veinlets. Interval is moderately fractured with 1 per
15 cm, with slight bleaching along fracture margins for up to 1 cm from fracture.  They are at many different orientations, from 25 to 40o to the core axis.

The bleaching and different orientations gives the core almost a stockwork appearance. The fractures are filled with quartz and a very aphanitic, ground up
grey clay, which appears to be sulphide bearing (arsenopyrite ?).  These quartz-clayey sulphide fillings are wafer thin. There is a noticeable decrease in iron
oxide on fractures at this depth. Occasional fracture has fine grained, crystalline pyrite on it. Overall the interval contains 1 to 2% very fine-grained pyrite and
fracture-filling sulphides. The mafic phenocrysts are generally altered to chlorite. The interval is quite siliceous and appears to be weakly to moderately
pervasively silicified has the appearance of silica flooding. Contains 1 to 3% pink potassium feldspar phenocrysts to 4 mm.  They are fairly angular. No
quartz eyes observed. The lower contact with the vein is somewhat irregular and at roughly 25o to the core axis.

109.60, 110.30
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Quite fractured, somewhat groundup from drilling, but also brecciated and cemented with quartz and very fine-grained to aphanitic
dark grey sulphide believed to be arsenopyrite, and possibly some pyrite. Quartz is medium grey and cloudy with slight crackle breccia filled with very fine-
grained sulphide.  Also have a number of bands of massive asenopyrite to 1 to 1.5 cm wide. Overall interval contains 50% quartz, 35% arsenopyrite (or grey
sulphide) and 15% rhyolite fragments. Brecciated fragments are rhyolite, quartz and arsenopyrite.  Rhyolite clasts are altered to slightly by sericite and clay
and are a light grey-green color. Moderate amount of orange iron oxide staining on fracture surfaces and in brecciated sections. Lower contact is not smooth
and at 25o to the core axis.

110.30, 173.40
Massive Rhyolite: Similar to interval from 79.3 to 109.6 m. Light to medium grey-green, fairly homogeneous, but approximately 1 fracture per 10 cm
throughout. Fractures are marked with a slight white-grey bleaching along margins with minor silicification and occasionally contain pyrite smears or very
fine-grained pyrite crystals, sometimes have wafer thin dark grey sulphide bearing clayey gouge and some with chlorite smeared on fractures. Occasional
patches that are lighter grey and indicate patchy silicification. Where less altered can see 3-4% vfg dark green mafic phenocrysts << 1 mm disseminated
throughout - altered to chlorite and sometimes contain pyrite.

The drillers had a mis-latch and only recovered 20 cm of core from a 1.5 m run.  The core is ground up and gravely sized.  Immediately below
this is a 10 cm wide quartz-arsenopyrite vein.  It is possible that more of the quartz-arsenopyrite vein was lost due to the mis-latch as there
are a few gravely pieces with quartz and arsenopyrite on them. Apart from this vein there are very little to no quartz-arsenopyrite veins in this
interval only minor sulphide along fractures. Overall this interval contains <0.5% quartz-arsenopyrite veins.

From here down, the feldspars are much less altered and there are ~5 to 8% crystals to 0.5 cm long.  This section of the core appears to be
much less altered with less pervasive silica and sericite alteration and less of a light grey wash to the core. Fracture surfaces become much
drier towards the bottom of this interval, contain less pyrite, less grey clayey sulphide, less quartz and only minor chlorite smears. In general
the rock appears to be much fresher and less altered downwards.

3.05m- 7.77m: Pinkish gray rhyolite w/ <10% mafics (mostly bio) clots that are <1mm in size on average. Irregular fracturing w/ rusty orange-red iron oxide
coatings. Small Apy + Sco veins <1cm in thickness are present @ 4.90m, 6.16m, and 6.36m.  Silicification more prominent near these alt. zones. From 7.77
to 8.62 have more mafic clots present within the rhyolite, oxide coatings are common, vuggy patches within. From 8.62 to 11.10 have less mafic clots, still
heavily oxidised and a few small ASPY veinlets. From 11.10 to 13.00 is heavily fractured, more silicicfied, numerous ASPY veinlets dipping 45 deg tca, up to
1cm thick and occasionally w scorodite. From 13.00 to 15.85 is much more oxidized leaving a rusty orange coloration with minor disseminated ASPY. From
15.85 to 16.66 is less oxidized, more silicicfied, vugggy along fractures with small qtz stringers run perpendicular to fractures.

16.66, 19.51
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Upper contact is gradational, becoming more silicified. ASPY and scorodite present as veinlets and disseminated thoughout. At
17.41-18.68m have veins of qtz (sometimes host rock is present as 'enclaves' floating w / in the quartz. From 17.44-17.65m is vuggy texture with ASPY
altered to scorodite. From 18.40-18.63m similar vuggy texture, but less predominant than above zone with quartz and clay alt. From19.30-19.51m ahve
vugs, ASPY, scorodite, quartz.

19.51, 22.18
Rhyolite Breccia: Rock is much less silicified (few veins) but much more oxidized and weathered creating a very vuggy texture.  Few mafic clots evident.
Offset in the veinlets illustrates some movement. Fractures are consistent and are present in 2 main orientations nearly perpendicular to eachother: 315 and
45.  10% quartz veins. From 21.30 to 21.58 rock is more competent, less brecciated and more silicified with a 7 cm Qtz-ASPY vein at 21.33m.

22.18, 35.82
RHYOLITE: As above, massive rhyolite. Lower contact is rather abrupt, vugs become absent in the rhyolite -- some fractures have weathered out to leave
vugs but it is much less common. Gray rhyolite w/ mafic clots ? 10%, rocks stays fairly competant w/ a high RQD until ~24.17m. From 24.17m to 24.45m the
rock is heavily fractured with vugs present and clay alteration throughout.  ASPY and PY, 22% of small vein, 22.90-22.97m. At 24.61m a small (<1cm thick X
3cm long) veinlet in aspy + scorodite is present.

35.82, 36.93
Rhyolite Breccia: Heavily fractured and oxidized due to brecciation. 1 piece is 23cm long. Interval is heavily re-silicified. No apparent sulfides within this
interval. Host rock appears to be fine grained rhyolite.  Trace hematite (An).

clots, qtz veins running throughout.�From 38.95m - 39.37m is whitish pink rhyolite with 10% mafics, competent rock, no sulfides noted, oxidized
cracks/fractures.

39.37, 40.45
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: With Scorodite. Rock gradually becomes more qtz rich over top 10cm (to form the contact). At 39.70m disseminated Aspy is
common, scorodite is present in veinlets as well as masses in the country rock.  66% qtz veins over interval, 5% ASPY 5%, 10% Scorodite.

40.45, 48.06
Rhyolite Breccia: Top contact is heavily fractured forming small fragments of rock-- this grades into more competant rock until 44.51m. The rock becomes
fragmented again until 47.26m. From 40.45m - 44.51m the rock is rusty with fractures. From 41.29m - 44.51m up to 4% of the rock is chalky white.  <4%
disseminated and veinlet Aspy. Aspy vein at 46.24m. Bottom of interval is beige-gray, competent, with < 3% mafics, oxidized (iron-oxide coated) fractures
and traces of subhedral, disseminated Aspy .

48.06, 69.80
RHYOLITE: Upper contact is gradational with a transition to compentent, weakly fractured (to not fractured at all) rock to highly fractured rock. These
intermittent fractured zones are poorly mineralized as opposed to the competent rock which is frequently mineralized with Aspy + Pyr ± Sco ± Chalco as both
veinlets and disseminations. Pyrite is present as euhedral cubes when dissem.  Silicification around mineralized veins. At 49.70 - 52.09m - veinlets with
ASPY and PY, 2-3%

69.80, 70.96
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Not heavily silicified - fine-grained rhyolite host is still evident. Small massive qtz veins and qtz stringers with disseminated Aspy.
Host rock alteration appears to have formed sericite near qtz veins/stringers.  25% pyrite, 5% Aspy.

70.96, 83.08
Rhyolite: Beige cream rusty rhyolite, <4% mafics. Similar to 60.48m - 65.28m. Rock is heavily altered from 71.24m to 71.76 m, heavily fractured and
oxidized. Mafics appear altered. One very small pyrite veinlet.

Highly oxidized zone-- bright rusty orange in color, much fewer mafics, more silicified, qtz eyes recognized w/in. Consistent fracturing forming
pieces of rock 7cm in length (rhythmic fracturing).

60.35, 60.48
highly oxidized, gray, >10% mafics with less frequent oxidized fractures. Rock is more silicified and is prominently and consistently fractured
@ 87 degrees to core axis. Throughout this interval the rock contains veinlets of Aspy and Py.  Surrounding these veins is an increase in
silicification. Feldspathic grains up to 0.6cm in size are present but difficult to distinguish. The qtz + Py + Aspy veinlets are 3% of the core but
they are v. common throughout the rock.

Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Beautiful 4.5m+. Severely altered heavily silicified and minerlized rock with very large sections of massive Aspy throughout the
whole section, with massive Py from 84.95m to 85.13m. Massive Bull Qtz from 83.24 to 84.05m and 84.81m-84.74m. The latter is heavily mineralized.
Scorodite along fractures and veins. Sections of the core are vuggy (when vuggy have scoro &/or Aspy).

89.19, 103.96
Rhyolite: Ranges from gray to rusty beige to darker brown. Has <<<mafics, is > competent, and > silicified. At 101.22m - 102.63m have a dark gray brown,
very hard/competant rock with 0.1% veins.  Trace disseminated Aspy and  Py near upper vein.

103.96, 104.40
Rhyolite Breccia: Brecciated fine grained pink rhyolite with very few mafics, chalky ± sericite and perhaps minor scorodite. Abrupt upper contact and
gradational lower contact.  Possible Scorodite.  Clay and sericite alt.

104.40, 110.19
Rhyolite: Heavily to moderatly fractured wwith rusty fractures, silicified with euhedral qtz vug fillings at 30degree to core axis. Minor mineralizations stringers
with Aspy, Py and scoro along fractures.  especially at 106.79-107.75m.

110.19, 111.18
Quartz-Arsenopyrite Vein: Poorly mineralized - too altered to green-yellow rock with qtz stringers and pink patches. Similar to interval from 82.56-82.78 m
but <<< mineralized.  Clay and sericite alteration.

111.18, 113.42
Rhyolite: Very few mafics, competent rock, silicified, minor Aspy ± Py stringers, minor Apy disseminations.  From 112.06 - 113.42 m hase >> mafics (<10%),
is silicified and rusty along fractures. <1% veins.  Minor mineralization, disseminated and vein Aspy and vein Py.
