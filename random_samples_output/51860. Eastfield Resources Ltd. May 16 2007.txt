SUMMARY 
 
Lysander Minerals Corporation owns the Lorraine-Jajay property, located approximately 280 
kilometres northwest of Prince George, BC. The property is accessed by paved and all-weather 
gravel roads from Prince George, through the town of Mackenzie and along the main haul road 
to the Kemess Mine. Hydro electric power is available to within 40 kilometres of the property 
as is access to the B.C. rail line along Takla Lake. 
 
The large claim block comprises 119 mineral claims (30,658.76 hectares) and lies within the 
Omineca Mining Division. 
 
Eastfield Resources Ltd., by way of an option agreement dated October 17, 2000, has the right 
to earn up to a 75% interest in the property from Lysander Minerals Corporation by completing 
$4,000,000 in exploration and making $550,000 in payments before December 2007 to earn a 
65% interest and the final 10% by completing a positive feasibility study. The 
Eastfield/Lysander option agreement was suspended in early 2005 and was replaced with an 
agreement where Eastfield and Lysander would each carry a 50% interest in the property for the 
duration of an option to Teck Cominco Limited. Teck Cominco has an option to earn an initial 
51% interest in the property be spending $9,000,000 on exploration, with minimum budgets of 
$1,500,000 per year. Teck Cominco may earn an additional 9% interest by funding and 
completing a feasibility study. Should Teck Cominco decide to put the property into 
production, it may earn a further 5% by arranging the financing requirements for Eastfield and 
Lysander. Kennecott Canada Exploration Inc. holds a 2% royalty interest (reducible to 1%) on 
the Lorraine and Dorothy-Elizabeth claims. 
 
In January, 2006, Teck Cominco Limited ("TCL") signed an option agreement with L. B. 
Warren and W. G. Luck which allows TCL to earn a 100% interest in the Jan-Tam-Misty 
("JTM") property by making total cash payments to the vendors of $525,000 and completing 
$2,000,000 in exploration expenditures by December 31, 2011.  The vendors will retain a 3% 
Net Smelter Returns Royalty (NSR) which may be reduced to 1% by TCL electing to pay the 
vendors $2,000,000. After the earn-in, TCL will pay an advanced royalty of $50,000 per year to 
a maximum total of $500,000, which advanced royalty shall be recoverable by TCL from future 
royalty payments, or the buy-down of the NSR. TCL subsequently offered this property for 
inclusion into the Eastfield/ Lysander Option Agreement on the Lorraine-Jajay property under 
the terms of the Area of Influence clause. The JTM property option was accepted and now 
forms a part of the Lorraine-Jajay property for the duration of the option agreements. 
 
The Lorraine-Jajay-JTM property is host to alkalic porphyry copper-gold-silver deposits similar 
to the Galore Creek, Mt. Polley, Afton and Copper Mountain deposits, all of which occur 
within  alkalic intrusive complexes of the Triassic-Jurassic aged Quesnel-Stikine Terrane.  
Mineralization is spatially related to potassic-altered Phase 2 syenite intrusions of the Duckling 
Creek Syenite Complex and an ensuing potassium rich mineralizing event.  
 
Work on the Lorraine-Jajay-JTM property, which include valid titles located as early as 1931, 
has included 182 diamond drill holes and 22 percussion holes, for a total of 204 drill holes 
totaling 31,080.84 metres. This drilling is summarized as follows: prior to the year 2000, 133

holes were completed totaling 16,458.71 metres; from 2000 to 2005 Eastfield oversaw the 
drilling of 64 drill holes for 12,016.13 metres.  
 
The 2006 exploration program on the combined Lorraine-Jajay and JTM properties comprised 
37.5 kilometres of IP geophysical surveying on three grids, 17 diamond drill holes totaling 
5,675.8 metres in the Misty, Slide and Lorraine (2,606 metres) areas, an airborne geophysical 
(magnetics and radiometrics) survey over the extent of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex 
underlying the property, detailed geological mapping in the Misty, Slide, Boundary and 
Lorraine areas, soil geochemical sampling on the southern slope of All Alone Dome and talus 
fine sampling west of the Rhonda area. A new camp was constructed at the headwaters of 
Duckling Creek, at a lower elevation than the previous camp, to facilitate an earlier start to the 
season and a later demobilization. 
 
This most recent work improved the understanding of the lithological structural,  alteration and 
mineralizing systems associated with the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex,  expanded known 
areas of mineralization in and around the Lorraine area, resulted in the discovery of new zones 
of significant mineralization in the Slide area, and produced several mineralized intercepts over 
a large area in the Misty area. 
 
The authors conclude that the exploration carried out to date has advanced the project and 
continues to show the potential for further discoveries and therefore warrants further 
exploration on the many targets explored in 2006 and prior years.  The authors have 
recommended a $3 million exploration program to further test the property but must clarify that 
under the terms of the agreements covering the property, Teck Cominco Limited has full 
control over the direction and amount of exploration expenditures and the outline of future 
exploration and may not follow the authors suggestions or recommendations.

completing a feasibility study. Should Teck Cominco decide to put the property into 
production, it may earn a further 5% by arranging the financing requirements for Eastfield and 
Lysander. Kennecott Canada Exploration Inc. holds a 2% royalty interest (reducible to 1% by 
payment to Kennecott of $1,000,000) on the Lorraine and Dorothy-Elizabeth claims. 
 
In January, 2006, Teck Cominco Limited ("TCL") signed an option agreement with L. B. 
Warren and W. G. Grant which allows TCL to earn a 100% interest in the Jan-Tam/Misty 
property ("JTM") by making total cash payments to the vendors of $525,000 and completing 
$2,000,000 in exploration expenditures by December 31, 2011.  The vendors will retain a 3% 
Net Smelter Returns Royalty (NSR) which may be reduced to 1% by TCL electing to pay the 
vendors $2,000,000. After the earn-in, TCL will pay an advanced royalty of $50,000 per year to 
a maximum total of $500,000, which advanced royalty shall be recoverable by TCL from future 
royalty payments, or the buy-down of the NSR. TCL subsequently offered this property for 
inclusion into the Eastfield/ Lysander Option Agreement on the Lorraine-Jajay property under 
the terms of the Area of Influence clause. The Tam/Misty property option was accepted and 
now forms a part of the Lorraine-Jajay property for the duration of the option agreements. 
 
Mineral claims in British Columbia may be kept in good standing by incurring exploration 
expenses or by paying cash in lieu.  Four dollars per hectare per year of exploration work must 
be applied prior to the first, second and third anniversaries followed by an eight dollar per 
hectare per year requirement thereafter.  Exploration work normally requires that the company 
submit a Notice of Work and Reclamation at least 30 days before work is planned to begin.  
Eastfield submits such a request annually.  The author is not aware of any extraordinary 
environmental liabilities that may be associated with land comprising the property.

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Lorraine-Jajay property is located in the Omineca Mountains near the headwaters of 
Duckling Creek.  This location is approximately 280 kilometres northwest of Prince George, 
British Columbia.  Road access to the Lorraine claims, which form the heart of the Lorraine-
Jajay property, is either via Fort St. James and Germansen Landing using a bush road off the 
Omineca Mining Road, or along the Kemess Access Corridor from MacKenzie to logging haul 
roads along the Osilinka River and HaHa Creek to the west side of the property, where a 9.5 
kilometre trail was upgraded in 2004 to give access to the main Lorraine camp.  Recent logging 
activity in the area has pushed industrial logging roads to within a few kilometres of the 
property from the southeast (via Germansen Landing), from the southwest (via rail loading 
facilities at Takla Lake) and from the north (via MacKenzie and the Kemess Access Corridor).  
One of the newly constructed roads approaches the property from the southwest using a new 
bridge on the Omineca River. It provides access to the BC Rail line at Lovell Cove on Takla 
Lake where logs are shipped to Prince George. This road and bridge will be an important 
component to the necessary infrastructure if and when a mine is constructed on the property.  A 
second road accesses the extreme southeastern region of the property using a new logging road 
branching from the Omineca Mining Road. This road extends to within a few hundred metres 
of the east bank of Duckling creek and has been used for access to the MacKenzie Target area.  
The property is located in a section of the interior which is truncated to the north and south by 
the broad, subdued river valleys of the Osilinka and Omineca Rivers, respectively. 
 
Elevations on the property range from approximately 1,000 metres (3,200 feet) on Duckling 
Creek to around 2,100 metres (6,900 feet) on the highest ridge tops.  Pleistocene glaciation has 
incised a number of north and east-facing cirques, which interrupt the general north-south 
lineation of the topography.  Cirque floors are generally found at 1,550 to 1,600 metres (5,000 
to 5,200 feet) elevation. 
 
Talus development is extensive on the northern and eastern slopes, while the southern and 
westerly slopes are commonly vegetated.  Glacial till and fluvioglacial outwash blanket the 
valley bottoms, limiting most outcrop exposures to streambeds below tree line.  A thick growth 
of mature spruce, pine and balsam covers much of the lower elevation areas extending up to 
tree line at approximately 1,650 metres (5,400 feet) elevation. 
 
The climate of this region of BC is typically cool and moderate with warm moist summers and 
cold winters. The lower elevation regions of the claims are snow free from the end of April 
until the beginning of November. In the highest elevation regions of the claims, winter snow 
may linger until the end of June and occur again any time after the middle of September. Total 
snowfall is not excessive.

HISTORY 
 
The following historical review has been excerpted from a report prepared by J. W. Morton, 
P.Geo., dated January 1, 2004, and updated by G. L. Garratt, P. Geo.  in 2004 and 2005 and 
again in this report.  The historical review was drawn from over fifty private and public 
company reports which have been reviewed by the author.  Field verification has shown that the 
historical work is reasonably verifiable with the exception of some local inaccuracies in site 
locations.  Some sample sites have been found to be as much as 100 metres from their 
originally plotted locations, though this is not inconsistent with historical work that preceded 
modern location technology such as GPS and more accurate topographic mapping.  The 
historical work was completed by junior and senior exploration and mining companies and is 
generally believed to be reliable and not misleading. 
 
In the early 1900's, prospectors noted the malachite-stained bluffs of Lorraine Mountain, but it 
was not until 1931 that the property was first staked.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting 
Company Limited (later named Cominco) acquired the Lorraine property in 1943 and held it 
until 1947.  
 
Kennex (a subsidiary of the Kennecott Corporation) acquired the Lorraine property in late 1947 
and, in 1948, under the name of Northwestern Explorations Limited, completed mapping and 
surface sampling programs on the property.  In 1949, five widely-spaced AX diamond drill-
holes were completed on the Lorraine claims in the vicinity of the copper stained cliffs later 
known as the Main zone.  Results from this drilling were mixed. 
 
Regional prospecting, undertaken during the 1948 program, located copper-mineralized float on 
the East Side of Duckling Creek (approximately 8 kilometres distant) in what soon became the 
Dorothy and Elizabeth showings.  Several boulders, described as being up to 4 cubic feet in 
volume and consisting of approximately 90% sulphide, were discovered on the Elizabeth 
claims. These boulders returned assays varying from 24.2% to 31.3% copper. In 1949, 
Northwestern followed-up this prospecting with a program of mapping, line-cutting, hand 
trenching and diamond-drilling.  Four AX diamond-drill holes, totalling 442 metres, were 
drilled at the Dorothy showing.  The best intersection from this program assayed 0.48% copper 
over 109 metres (357 feet).  
 
Limited exploration was carried out in the area during the 1950's and early 1960's.  In 1951, H. 
V. Warren and D. A. Barr carried out a biogeochemical survey in the Dorothy-Elizabeth area.  
In the early 1960's Kennco Explorations (Western) Limited carried out a program of mapping, 
silt and soil sampling, and geophysical (IP and magnetometer) surveys in the area, and in 1963, 
they drilled 2 AX diamond-drill holes (DDH DY-1, 2).  Sufficient assessment work was 
generated by this work to hold the Dorothy 2-post claims until 1972, after which cash in lieu of 
work was paid to hold the property. 
 
The Lorraine property then lay dormant until it was joint ventured with Granby Mining 
Company Limited in 1970.  During the period 1970-73, Granby enlarged the property and 
carried out a major exploration program of geological mapping, rock and soil sampling, 
trenching and drilling.  A total of 3,992 metres of diamond drilling and 2,470 metres of

percussion drilling were completed on the Main Zone.  By 1973, the Main zone had been sub-
divided into two zones and a preliminary estimate of reserves calculated.  At a cut off grade of 
0.4% copper, the Lower Main zone contained a pre NI 43-101 compliant inferred historical 
estimate of 5,500,000 tons grading 0.6% copper and 0.1 grams per tonne gold, and the Upper 
Main Zone an inferred 4,500,000 tons grading 0.75% copper and 0.34 grams per tonne gold.  
(Lorraine, CIM, Spec. Vol. 15, Porphyry Deposits of the Canadian Cordillera, Wilkinson, W.J., 
Stevenson, R.W. and Garnett, J.A., 1976.).  A large area surrounding the Granby-Kennecott 
holdings was acquired or staked by a large group of junior and senior resource companies.  
Additionally in the early 1970's senior mining companies including Noranda, Cominco, 
Falconbridge and Amoco Canada conducting exploration peripheral to the Kennecott holdings 
on the site of the present Lorraine-Jajay claims.  
 
The Lorraine properties were inactive during the later years of the 1970's and through most of 
the 1980's.  In 1989, Kennecott Canada Inc. began a reassessment of the gold-copper potential 
of the Lorraine and Dorothy properties.  The property was expanded, and an initial orientation 
program was contracted to C.E.C. Engineering Ltd. in 1990.  This included road rehabilitation, 
establishing grids, geological mapping, soil sampling, and geophysical (IP and magnetometer) 
surveys.   
 
In 1991, Kennecott resumed management of the property and embarked on a twelve-hole (2,392 
metres) diamond-drill program in the Lorraine area, with nine holes drilled in the Lorraine 
Extension (later called the Bishop) Zone. Two holes were also drilled in the Weber Zone and 
one hole drilled in the North Cirque Zone.  Detailed geological mapping and petrographic 
studies were begun during this program.  The exploration program also extended to the Dorothy 
/ Elizabeth areas.  Work consisted of road construction (from the Dorothy Duckling Creek 
access road to the Elizabeth Breccia area), test pitting, rock sampling, IP surveys and the 
diamond drilling of 6 NQ holes for a total of 961.6 metres.   The first three holes were drilled at 
the Dorothy showing in the vicinity of Northwestern's 1949 drill-holes and the remaining three 
holes were drilled along the Dorothy Duckling Creek road south of Dorel Creek.  The most 
significant intersection was in hole D91-1 which averaged 0.34% copper and 0.12 grams per 
tonne gold over 121 metres.   
 
In 1993, Kennecott drilled another 2 holes (the 3rd hole was lost in overburden) on the Lorraine 
claims, and completed detailed rock chip sampling of the Main and Extension (Bishop) zones. 
 
In 1990, BP Resources Canada optioned several claims surrounding the Lorraine claims. This 
option was negotiated following the discovery of platinum and palladium mineralized float  by  
prospector Richard Haslinger in 1990. In 1991, BP located the source of the mineralization in a 
breccia outcropping on a cliff face.  In 1991, BP completed geochemical, induced polarization 
and minor diamond drilling southeast of the Bishop Zone and what is now referred to as the 
TooGood Target, as well as completing a detailed airborne geophysical survey.  An expanded 
program was proposed for 1992 but was not completed owing to the decision of BP's parent oil 
company to wind down BP Resources Canada. 
 
In 1994, Lysander Gold Corporation (now Lysander Minerals Corporation) optioned the 
Lorraine property from Kennecott and carried out a 10-hole diamond-drill program (1,221.4 
metres), which was focused on the western part of the Upper Main (3 holes) and Bishop (7

holes) zones.  The success of this program led to the optioning of the adjacent Boot-Steele 
claims to protect a possible southeastern extension of the Bishop zone.   
 
Lysander continued drilling in 1995 with a 26-hole, 3,843.53 metre program.  A total of 23 
holes (2,903 metres) were drilled on the Upper Main Zone with the known mineralization being 
extended to deeper levels than earlier work had suggested.  Two holes were drilled in the 
Bishop zone in 1995 with both failing to intersect significant mineralization, suggesting that 
faulting may be disrupting continuity. A single "wildcat" hole drilled on Jeno Ridge (above the 
"BM" Breccia, the above named platinum-palladium occurrence) also failed to intersect 
significant mineralization. This program also successfully established the existence of a 
potential oxide copper resource in the weathered talus apron below the Upper Main Zone. 
 
In 1996, Lysander optioned the Dorothy and Steelhead properties and staked the Pal claims.  
Initial work in 1996 on the expanded Lorraine-Jajay property included a geochemical program 
of sampling soils, talus fines, seepage sediments and rocks over the western third of the 
expanded property.  A 10-hole diamond-drill program in 1996, in the Lorraine area, probed 
extensions of the Upper Main Zone and reestablished extensions to mineralization in the 
Bishop zone.  Significant intersections included hole 96-44 which cut 32.2 metres (106 feet) of 
1.49% copper in the Bishop Zone. 
 
Lysander continued drilling in 1997 with an 8-hole (1,146.3 metres) program.  4 holes were 
drilled in the Dorothy showing, 3 holes in the Bishop zone and 1 hole in the Ato area (Bobinette 
claim).  In the Bishop zone, hole 97-47 intersected 64 metres of 0.58 % copper and 0.24 grams 
per tonne gold.  The geochemical (talus fines and seepage sampling) program was continued in 
1997, and a limited amount of follow-up sampling was carried out.  Numerous copper and gold 
anomalies were identified in both of the 1996 and 1997 geochemical surveys. Subsequent 
reanalysis of some of these samples resulted in the identification of several PGE anomalies. 
 
 
In 1998, G.R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng. computed a then-current resource for Lysander Gold 
Corporation (now Lysander Minerals Corporation) using all available drill data current to the 
end of 1996. Mr. Peatfield's methodology consisted of constructing a series of 10 meter spaced 
level plans to calculate a new resource for the Upper Main and Bishop Zones.  The smaller 
Lower Main Zone, with a published resource originating from earlier Granby Mining and 
Kennco work, was added to his new calculations.  Mr. Peatfield's categories for the resource 
(measured, indicated and inferred) conform to definitions currently required and are relevant in 
the opinion of the authors.  The summary of resources published in the 1997 Annual Report for 
Lysander Gold Corporation follows:

Peatfield noted in his 1998 report that the three zones in his resource estimates are open for 
expansion (in at least one direction). Peatfield's 1998 calculation predates National Policy 43-
101 implementation,and is therefore is a "historical estimate" and due to new information 

provided by subsequent exploration has been determined by the authors as no longer 

complying with the Instrument and should  not be relied upon. 

 
In 1999, Lysander completed three fly-camp scale reconnaissance-prospecting surveys of three 
of the more obvious targets originating from the geochemical reconnaissance completed in 
1996 and 1997. The most significant result of this work was the identification of "Lorraine 
style" mineralization in an alpine drainage 1,000 metres south of the Bishop Zone. Evaluation 
here led to the discovery of several new outcrops containing significant copper and gold 
mineralization in potassic altered syenite and syenite-magnetite breccia.  

 
Eastfield Resources Ltd. optioned the Lorraine-Jajay property from Lysander Minerals 
Corporation in October, 2000.  Shortly thereafter Eastfield initiated a program in the 
southeastern region of the claim block (the Mackenzie Zone).  The program which ran until 
early November 2000 entailed drilling 5 short holes totalling 378 metres and completing a 91 
sample soil survey. While the drilling was unsuccessful, the soil survey outlined a new copper-
gold anomaly.  
 
In 2001, Eastfield initiated exploration at the Lorraine area of the property. The program, which 
commenced in June, ran until the middle of October and entailed 2,508 metres of diamond 
drilling in 13 holes, 16.5 kilometres of induced polarization and magnetometer survey and the 
reconstruction of Upper Camp. Hole 2001-58 confirmed an open direction to mineralization on 
the southeastern boundary of the Bishop Zone while hole 2001-60 confirmed an open direction 
to mineralization on the southern boundary of the Lower Main Zone. Holes 2001-58 and 2001-
60 are approximately 1,400 metres distant from each other. 
 
In 2002 Eastfield completed 7 diamond drill holes totalling 1,106 metres, repaired the access 
road to the camp and completed 12 kilometres of induced polarization surveying.  New drill 
targets were defined for the All Alone Dome and Weber Basin areas.  Also in 2002 Eastfield 
entered into a Geoscience partnership with the BC Geological Survey Branch which resulted in 
the publication of Open File 2003-4 on July 23, 2003 (Nixon, G.T. and Peatfield, G.R., 2003). 
Eastfield also purchased the Steelhead claims.

In June 2003, during a property tour a new area of copper mineralization on the north side of 
the Steelhead area of interest was discovered.  A second mineralized showing (mineralized 
talus) was discovered 500 metres to the west of the June discovery in mid September.  
 
The 2004 exploration program included the drilling of 24 diamond drill holes in the Lorraine 
area, 28.9 line-kilometres of pole-dipole Induced Polarization and magnetic geophysical 
surveys in the Lorraine and MacKenzie areas, 14.31 line-kilometers of soil sampling in the 
Mackenzie area, geological mapping at 1:2500 scale in the Lorraine area, reconnaissance 
prospecting and mapping in the Steelhead, Dorothy, Rhonda and Nupal (northeast corner of the 
property, north of Rhonda) areas, approximately 9.5 kilometres of road rehabilitation and the 
construction of 2.5 kilometres of ATV trails.  At the Lorraine Main Zone the program was 
successful in expanding the area of related mineralization by a kilometer to the south and west 
indicating potential for related mineralization two kilometers west of Ekland Ridge.  Several 
significant soil geochemical anomalies were outlined in the MacKenzie area and subsequent 
geophysical surveying partially outlined a large anomaly. 
 
The 2005 exploration program, funded by Teck Cominco Limited, and carried out by Eastfield, 
included: the drilling of 17 diamond drill holes totaling 3,704 metres; 40.3 line-kilometres of 
pole-dipole Induced Polarization and magnetic geophysical surveys in the Lorraine, 
MacKenzie, North Dome, Steelhead and Rhonda areas; grid soil sampling totaling 588 samples 
at 50 metre spacing in the Mackenzie and TooGood areas; the collection of 390 talus/soil 
samples taken at 100 metre spacing along topographic contours in the south-central part of the 
property; geological mapping at 1:5000 scale in the Lorraine and Dorothy-Rhonda areas; and 
reconnaissance prospecting and mapping in the Steelhead, MacKenzie and Nupal areas.  The 
results of this program are reported herein.  
 
Four areas were drill tested during the 2005 program: at the MacKenzie Target several 
geophysical anomalies were drilled at broad spacing and indicated an area of increased potassic 
alteration; three holes were drilled on the Rhonda Target to test a broad zone of mineralization 
and alteration associated with a 450 metre wide IP chargeability anomaly and these holes all 
intersected significant copper mineralization indicating a large system; several broadly spaced 
holes tested the TooGood geophysical anomaly and indicated a large potassic alteration system 
associated with late stage syenitic intrusions; two holes were drilled in the Lorraine Main and 
Weber Zones area resulting in a confirmation of the significant westward extension of the zones 
indicated by drill hole 04-82. Geochemical reconnaissance sampling resulted in the discovery of 
a large area of anomalous copper geochemistry west of the Rhonda Target; this area had seen 
little to no previous exploration. 
 
The 2006 exploration program on the combined Lorraine-Jajay and Tam/Misty properties 
comprised 37.5 kilometres of IP geophysical surveying on three grids, 17 diamond drill holes 
totaling 5,675.8 metres in the Misty, Slide and Lorraine areas, an airborne geophysical survey 
over the extent of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex, detailed geological mapping in the 
Misty, Slide, Boundary and Lorraine areas, soil geochemical sampling on the southern slope of 
All Alone Dome and talus fine sampling west of the Rhonda area. The results of this most 
recent work continued to expand known areas of mineralization in the Lorraine area, discovered 
a new zone of significant mineralization in the Slide area, intersected several significant

mineralized intercepts over a large area in the Misty area and improved the understanding of the 
alteration and mineralizing systems. 
 

Jam/Tam/Misty (JTM) Property: 
 
The following historical summary of the JTM property was taken from a summary written by 
Paul Baxter, P. Geo., of Teck Cominco Limited, and the authors accept the validity of this 
summary and incorporate it into this report.  
 
The area that is now the JTM property was originally staked in the late 1940's following the 
discovery of the Lorraine Cu-Au mineralization but the property was comprised of several 
smaller properties under different ownership.  It was not until 2005 that the property came into 
its present outline under one owner. 
 
The Misty area was first staked in 1948 for Kennco Exploration Ltd but no significant work 
occurred till the 1970's.  From 1970-1973 El Paso Mining and Milling Ltd.  carried out an 
extensive program of mapping, soil sampling, IP and magnetic geophysical surveys, trenching, 
diamond drilling (9 holes, 1517m) and rotary percussion drilling (8 holes, 488m).  El Paso 
outlined a mineralized zone 500m long, averaging 11m wide that extends to a depth of at least 
170m.  Mineralization comprises disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite, with veinlets of 
chalcopyrite and pyrite common along the contact margins of crosscutting syenite dikes and 
orthoclase veins.  Mineralization is hosted within a northwest trending, chloritized, k-feldspar 
altered, hornblende-biotite gneiss.  El Paso calculated  a resource of 3 million tonnes grading 
0.6 per cent copper (Pilcher et al, 1976). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 
implementation, and is therefore is a "historical estimate" and due to new information 

provided by subsequent exploration has been determined by the authors as no longer 

complying with the Instrument and should  not be relied upon.  The Property was allowed to 
lapse and was restaked in 1989.  In 1989 and 1990, Aranlee Resources carried out programs of 
geological mapping, rock, soil and stream sediment sampling.  Since 1995, the Misty area has 
been restaked several times by L. Warren.  No significant exploration programs have occurred 
since Aranlees's 1990 work. 
 
Mineralization in the Boundary area was first discovered in the late 40's by Kennco 
Explorations but not until the early 70's was any extensive work conducted.  From 1969 – 
1975, Union Miniere Explorations and Mining Corporation Limited (UMEX) conducted 
programs of geological mapping, soil and rock sampling, IP and magnetic geophysical surveys, 
trenching and diamond drilling (25 holes, 3629m) on the Boundary, Midway, Cirque and Fault 
targets.  This work resulted in the definition of inferred (possible) reserves for the Boundary 
deposit of 7.2 million tonnes grading 0.55 percent copper and 4.11 grams per tonne silver 
(Dyson, 1974). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is 
therefore is a "historical estimate" and due to new information provided by subsequent 

exploration has been determined by the authors as no longer complying with the Instrument 

and should  not be relied upon.  The best drill hole from the Boundary deposit is 0.68% Cu 
over 179.8m in hole 74-6 from 3.7-183.5m including 1.59% Cu over 39.6m from 3.7-43.3m.  
Copper mineralization occurs both as fine-grained disseminations and as fracture fillings within 
fine grained foliated and massive potassium altered syenites.

While developing the Boundary prospect, UMEX also carried out exploration programs in the 
Slide area documenting mineralization in outcrop in 1973.  From 1973 to 1975 UMEX 
conducted geological mapping, soil geochemical surveys, IP geophysical surveys and drilled 
three diamond drill holes totaling 326.2m.   The best results from this work was 0.43% Cu over 
10ft in hole T-17.   
 
In 1990 and 1991, Major General Resources Ltd. now Commander Resources Ltd, and Varitech 
Resources Ltd. carried out programs of mapping, rock and soil sampling, IP and magnetic 
geophysical surveys over the Boundary, Midway and Slide showings but did not drill test any 
targets.   A 10m random chip sample from the 1970's Slide hand trench returned 1.27% Cu 
from malachite stained fine grained potassium altered gneissic monzonite or greenschist.   No 
significant exploration programs have occurred at Boundary or Slide since 1991. 
 
 

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The Lorraine-Jajay property occurs within a large composite intrusive complex, the Hogem 
Batholith, which is located within a northwest-southeast trending Mesozoic remnant of a west 
facing volcanic arc termed Quesnel Terrane and part of the larger Quesnel-Stikine Terrane. The 
tectostratigraphic setting of the Quesnel Terrane has also been referred to as the Takla-Nicola-
Stuhini Volcanic Arc.  
 
The Quesnel and Stikine Terranes are a Triassic to Jurassic aged obducted island arc 
assemblage that forms an approximately 1200 kilometre long belt of most commonly calc 
alkalic with lessor alkalic volcanic rocks and associated sediments and related intrusive bodies 
that parallels the northwesterly trend of the Canadian Cordillera. The belt extends from the 
B.C.-Washington State border in the south, to the Yukon border in the north. The Quesnel 
Terrane is fault bound on the west and east, abutting older terranes.  To the east are lithologies 
assigned to ancestral North America and less commonly smaller remnants of older island arc 
assemblages. To the west are mostly lithologies of oceanic provenance assigned to the Cache 
Creek Oceanic Terrane in the South and east facing Stikine Terrane in the north.  
 
The Quesnel Terrane hosts several calc-alkalic porphyry copper-molybdenum+/-silver+/-gold 
and alkalic porphyry copper-gold-silver+/-molybdenum+/-Palladium+/-Platinum. deposits 
throughout its length.  Examples of alkalic past and present producing mines include Copper 
Mountain (Ingerbelle), Afton and Mt. Polley, as well as a number of deposits that have reached 
advanced stages of exploration such as Galore Creek.  Deposits in the region that are likely also 
related, but are more of a calc-alkaline character are represented by the Red-Chris deposit, the 
Kemess Mine deposits and the Mt. Milligan deposit which is presently undergoing a feasibility 
study by Terrane Metals Corp., who are completing the study begun by Placer Dome. 
 
The Lorraine-Jajay property lies in the northern portion of the Quesnel Terrane and exhibits 
many characteristics similar to the Mt. Polley and Galore Creek deposits. Mineralization at 
these deposits is generally disseminated, pyrite deficient, is associated with magnetite and has 
narrow peripheral alteration halos flanking strong potassium alteration cores.

Authors' Note: The following sections, titled Regional Geology and Property Geology, have 

been taken from an in-house report by Graeme Evans, P. Geo., Teck Cominco Limited. 

 

REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Lorraine property is located at the northwest margin of the Hogem Batholith and is well   
summarized by Garnett as follows: …"the Hogem batholith, which is the largest intrusive body 
within the Swannell Ranges, a subdivision of the Omineca Mountains. The batholith is a 

Mesozoic intrusion located within the island arc environment of the Quesnel Trough.  To the 

west, older, uplifted Cache Creek Group rocks are separated from this belt by the Pinchi fault 

zone.  To the east, the Manson fault zone separates this volcanic belt from the older, uplifted 

Wolverine Complex.  The current structural setting of the Hogem batholith and the intruded 

Takla Group volcanic rocks is therefore best explained by vertical tectonics associated with 

graben development. Detailed mapping in the southern section of the Hogem has documented a 

complex intrusive history spanning a much larger time interval than previously thought. It is a 

composite intrusion, containing three, and probably four, partial plutons with distinctive 

petrographic and chemical compositions. 

 

Geochronologically, emplacement can be separated into three distinct phases.  Phase I, 

chemically divided into the Hogem basic suite and the Hogem granodiorite, yields K/Ar dates 

within the limits 176 Ma to 212 Ma, and volumetrically represents the main intrusive event. 

 The Phase II Duckling Creek and Chuchi syenite bodies yield K/Ar dates within the limits 162 

Ma to 182 Ma and, although there is some age overlap with Phase I, are interpreted as 

distinctly younger on the basis of field observations.  Phase Ill granite yields K/Ar dates within 

the limits 108 Ma to 126 Ma, and occurs as relatively small isolated bodies at four localities 

within the southern Hogem batholith." 

 
Recent work has improved the knowledge base of the batholith due to attempts at 
reconstructing some of the primary structural and chemical features. The oldest Hogem phase 1 
consists of several plutons (i.e. Thane, Detni ) of a calc-alkaline to sub-alkaline affinity. These 
are not known to host significant mineralization. The Duckling Creek suite is a generally NW 
trending multi-phased complex of an alkaline affinity. This complex is the largest alkaline 
intrusive complex in B.C. This intrusive complex is likely related to subduction related 
shoshonitic magma series volcanic rocks of the Nicola-Takla Group portion of the Quesnel 
Terrane. The Duckling Creek suite contains most of the Cu-Au mineralization in the batholith. 
The early to mid Cretaceous Meslinka and Oslinka granodiorite intrusions crosscut the earlier 
intrusive sequence in a discordant orientation which further complicates unraveling of the 
Hogem Batholith.

The Lorraine-Jajay-Jan-Tam-Misty property covers the central and southern end of the 
northwest-trending Duckling Creek Syenite Complex, an alkalic intrusive complex within the 
Triassic-Cretaceous Hogem batholith.  The Hogem batholith, including the Duckling Creek 
syenite complex, intrudes Takla Group volcanic rocks along the eastern and southeastern sides 
of the property. Multiple phases of Hogem batholith intrusions extend into the Takla Group 
volcanic rocks as dykes with consistent northwest and northeast control.  Along the 
southeastern side of the property the Duckling Creek complex extends into the Takla Group 
volcanic rocks (i.e. Mackenzie area).  Within the Hogem batholith, the Duckling Creek syenite 
complex displays a strong regional northwest trend with conjugate northeast intrusive trends 
locally dominant.  Early intrusive phases of the Duckling show both NW and NE control, while 
later phases generally occur with a NE-trend only.  
 
The Duckling Creek syenite complex intrudes older diorite and monzonite of the Hogem 
batholith and comprises an intrusive suite ranging from pyroxenite to leucosyenite. Oldest rocks 
include a suite of pyroxenitic rocks ranging from true clinopyroxenite and feldspathic 
pyroxenite with up to 40% primary feldspar, to a K-feldspar megacrystic unit with 5 to 95% 1-5 
cm long K-feldspar megacrysts in a pyroxenitic matrix.  Pyroxenite is intruded locally by a 
dioritic phase with associated Moly mineralization.  Leucocratic K-feldspar megacrystic 
porphyry and monzonite with close spatial and timing relationships, intrude the pyroxenite and 
diorite. Potassic alteration associated with the K-spar megacrystic porphyry and monzonite 
phase is locally pervasive and contains significant copper mineralization, for example at the 
Lorraine Main Zone.  Late leucosyenite, feldspar-hornblende porphyry, and K-feldspar 
pegmatitic dykes cross cut all earlier phases and locally contain minor copper mineralization.   
 
The dominant northwest intrusive trend to the Duckling Creek syenite complex is cut by faults 
with two dominant orientations – northeast and northwest.  Both northwest and northeast 
trending faults appear to post-date all intrusive phases, cut each other and are likely reactivated 
earlier faults.  However, the youngest and most regionally continuous brittle structures on the 
property are northeast-trending, southeast-dipping faults that step and shuffle the northwest-
trending Duckling Creek complex.  A series of these laterally continuous structures show a 
curve from northeast to north, for example along the Duckling Creek valley.  Mapping shows 
there to be relatively little lateral displacement and dominantly vertical displacement, normal or 
reverse, along these major structures. The Duckling Creek Complex can be consistently 
followed along the northwest corridor although exposed to different structural levels in 
different fault blocks.

Figure 4.  Duckling Ck Intrusive Relationships 

Schematic diagram showing intrusive relationships within the Duckling Creek syenite complex. 

 
The Jan-Tam-Misty property covers the central section of the northwest-trending Duckling 
Creek syenite complex, an alkalic intrusive complex within the Triassic-Cretaceous Hogem 
batholith (Figure 3).  The property spans the entire width of the Duckling Creek complex, 
including both the faulted northeastern and southwestern margins (Figure 5).  Deformation and 
alteration are concentrated along the margins of the complex in the Misty and Boundary areas.  
Alteration and mineralization are mostly limited to the Duckling Creek complex rocks with 
minor alteration and veining in the Hogem granodiorite and monzonites outside of the corridor 
across faulted intrusive contacts. 
 
Alteration on the Jan-Tam-Misty Property is concentrated along the margins of the Duckling 
Creek complex in the Misty, Slide and Boundary areas.  In the northern Boundary area, 
alteration ranges from early stage coarse to sugary grey K-feldspar+ biotite+magnetite+/-
cpy+bornite, to later stage pink K-feldspar alteration phases with strong white mica (sericite)+/-
pyrite.   Along the southern margin of the complex, in the Misty area, deformation is much 
stronger and grey K-feldspar+biotite+magnetite+/-cpy+/-bornite altered rocks are strongly 
foliated with a later, overprinting K-feldspar+/-white mica(sericite) alteration phases.  Pods of 
alteration and mineralization within the Duckling Corridor on the property occur at the West 
and Cirque showings.  They are interpreted to be relict pods of early stage alteration and 
mineralization overprinted and destroyed by later pink K-feldspar alteration stages. 
 
The dominant northwest intrusive trend to the Duckling Creek syenite complex is cut by both 
northeast and northwest faults.  There is strong northwest fault control and foliation in the rocks 
along the margins of the complex, particularly in the Misty area.  Geological relationships in the 
Misty area show syn-intrusion semi-ductile deformation of a border phase syenite with later 
syenite dykes and intrusions and young brittle NW and NE faults. Faults across the property in 
both NW and NE orientations appear to post-date all intrusive phases, cut each other and are 
likely reactivated earlier faults.  However, the youngest, and most regionally continuous brittle

structures on the property are northeast-trending, high-angle faults that locally step and shuffle 
the northwest-trending Duckling Creek complex rocks.

DEPOSIT TYPE  

 
C. Deyell (May, 2004) adequately describes the mineral deposit type that occurs at the 
Lorraine/Jajay property, with particular reference to the Lorraine deposit. "Cu-Au porphyry 
deposits associated with alkaline igneous rocks are characterized by distinctive alteration 

zones that include sodic and calc-potassic mineral assemblages.  These deposits only occur in a 

few mineral provinces worldwide and some of the best-known examples are from British 

Columbia (e.g., Galore Creek, Mt. Polley, Afton/Ajax, Copper Mountain).  The Lachlan Fold 

Belt of New South Wales, Australia is the second largest alkalic porphyry district (e.g., Cadia, 

Goonumgla) and other isolated alkalic systems are known from the Philippines (Dinkidi), 

Greece (Skouries), Colorado (Allard Stock) and Mongolia (Oyu Tolgoi)." 

 
"Alkalic porphyry deposits are of economic significance and represent some of the world's 

highest-grade porphyry gold resources (e.g., Ridgeway: 53 Mt @ 2.5 g/t Au, 0.77% Cu or 4.26 

M oz Au; Cadia Far East: 290 Mt @ 0.98 g/t Au, 0.36% Cu or 9.13 M oz Au).  In B.C., the 

large alkalic porphyry systems at Copper Mountain, Mount Milligan, and Galore Creek have a 

combined resource of over 900 Mt (Lang et al, 1995), and new exploration at Afton and 

Lorraine may significantly add to this resource." 

 
All known alkalic copper-gold porphyry deposits in British Columbia occur within the Quesnel 
and related Stikine Terranes which forms a 1200-kilometre-long belt of volcanic and 
sedimentary rocks that lies centrally in the province and extends from the U.S. to nearly the 
Yukon border. These deposits are generally characterized by large magnetic and potassium 
alteration signatures with relatively high concentrations of copper and gold with accessory 
silver, molybdenum, palladium and platinum.  Most alkalic porphyry districts are characterized 
by multiple deposits and display strong structural controls. Several deposits usually occur 
within an area of a few kilometres and may range in size from 10 to 300 million tonnes.

MINERALIZATION 
 

• The following section on the Lorraine area, All Alone Dome, Jan, Tam, Misty, Boundary 
and Steelehead zones is excerpted from Baxter's 2006 reports on the Lorraine and Jan-Tam 
Misty Properties.  Excerpts are in Italics. For the  plan showing the location of the 
mineralized zones please refer to Figure 18. 

 
"There are several centres of strong to intense alteration and mineralization on the Lorraine 
Property within rocks of the Duckling Creek Complex, surrounded by areas of moderate to 

weak alteration.  The Lorraine Main Zone represents the most well-exposed and well known 

centre; the TooGood area shows significant alteration in drill core and strong IP and magnetic 

responses indicate a large alteration and potentially mineralized centre; and the Dorothy area 

has turned up significant bornite in drilling and the few outcrops available show strong 

potassic and possibly sodic alteration.  Alteration and mineralization related to the Duckling 

Creek Complex occurs in rocks peripheral to the Complex as well, in the earlier phases of the 

Hogem Batholith and Takla volcanic rocks, this alteration is described briefly below. 

 

The Lorraine Main Zone is the most well-exposed area with significant alteration and 

mineralization on the property. Mapping of lithological and alteration relationships in the 

Main Zone area in 2006 has increased the understanding of the alteration and mineralization 

styles, specifically in that area.  The sequence is presented below as an example and guide to 

alteration from other parts of the property as well, although it should be used with caution 

from one area to another with awareness of local variations. 

 

The following alteration sequence is broken out into 5 alteration stages (Figure 5).  These 

stages are only broadly defined and grouped into assemblages; each stage may include several 

alteration pulses and assemblages with slight variations that are grouped to show rough 

temporal associations.  The stages are meant to outline a progression from: early regional 

biotite � grey ksp+bio+mag+alb+Cu � later generations of pink K-feldspar alteration +/- 

Cu.  Copper mineralization appears in several stages, no single copper mineralizing event has 

been recognized; however, the stage 2 alteration shows a consistent, high copper content.

Alteration on the Jan-Tam-Misty property is focused along or near the margins of the Duckling 

Creek complex.  Alteration is dominantly Potassic, with various styles and overprinting 

assemblages. 

 

In the Misty area, alteration and associated mineralization is focused along the deformation 

zone.  Weak to strongly foliated grey K-feldspar (microcline)-dominant mineralization+/- 

biotite is coarse grained to sugary with pods of strong, disseminated cpy+bornite 

mineralization.  Later stage pink K-feldspar alteration phases overprint the well foliated, 

deformed, early alteration and mineralization stages.  In the boundary area, alteration follows 

the same sequence with early grey K-feldspar-dominant +/- copper mineralization, followed by 

later pink K-feldspar +/- white mica alteration.  In the Boundary area, the later pink K-

feldspar + white mica + pyrite alteration is widespread and locally destructively overprints the 

earlier mineralized stages.

Detailed mapping, generally at a 1:1000 and 1:2500 scales, was undertaken by Teck Cominco 

Limited in several key areas on the Lorraine/JMT property during 2006. The  following 

summaries of this work is excerpted from Baxter et al (2006). 

 

Lorraine Main 

 

The Lorraine Main area is described here in a single section as the detailed geology from 

several zones within the Main area have contributed to overall understanding of this part of the 

system.  It is bound to the north by the cryptic northern margin of the Duckling Creek Complex.  

Cliffy hills and glacially-scoured bowls have excellent outcrop exposure and were the focus of 

detailed lithological and alteration mapping in 2006. The Lorraine Main area includes 

previously named zones: (Upper) Main Zone, Lower Main Zone, Ekland Ridge, Weber Bowl, 

Copper Bowl, Copper Peak, Copper Ridge, Page Bowl, Bishop Bowl, and North Cirque.  Ekland 

Ridge and Copper Ridge are described in more detailed sections below.  

 

Figure 9 

 
 

…"The Lorraine Main area is unique within the Lorraine Property due to the presence of the 

early pyroxenite stage of intrusion.  Feldspathic pyroxenites locally with K-feldspar megacrystic 

domains and subrounded pseudoleucite are intruded by dominantly leucocratic K-feldspar 

megacrystic porphyry and monzonite dykes.  The South Stock, which underlies the southern end 

of Jeno Ridge, is underlain by massive K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry from which northwest-

trending dykes and sills intrude the pyroxenite to the north in the Page Bowl and Bishop areas.

Northwest-trending dykes and sills of monzonite intrude pyroxenite farther north on Ekland 

Ridge, in the Main and Lower Main Zone areas, south of Lorraine Peak and in North Cirque.  

Northeast-trending leucosyenite dykes and local K-feldspar pegmatitic dykes are prevalent and 

relatively continuous from Ekland Ridge across Weber Bowl and up over Lorraine Peak into 

North Cirque.  Late feldspar porphyry and feldspar hornblende porphyry dykes trend NW across 

the north side of Lorraine peak and cut across all earlier phases and alteration.  

 

A wide alteration halo of weak to moderate selective-pervasive biotite extends around the 

Lorraine Main area.  Biotite alteration increases into the centre of the area as moderate to 

intense, completely pervasive biotite alteration in pyroxenites.  K-feldspar-dominant alteration 

overprints the biotite phase and where most intense completely replaces pyroxenite and the 

dykes phases to be indistinguishable protoliths.  K-feldspar alteration includes grey-K-

feldspar+diopside+biotite+magnetite+/-albite+/-chalcopyrite and bornite.  Multiple phases of 

K-spar alteration of varying intensity have distinctly different textures including a medium to 

coarse grained phase with local copper mineralization, a fine grained sugary phase with strong 

copper association.  Later phases of pink K-feldspar alteration pervasively wash earlier phases 

as well as introducing new K-feldspar as medium to coarse grained to pegmatitic veins and 

pods.   

 

Moderate to intense K-feldspar alteration and copper mineralization in the Lorraine Main area 

consistently occurs as moderately SW-dipping stacked alteration sheets (Figure 8).  The sheets 

are defined by sharp to diffuse K-feldspar alteration boundaries in pyroxenite and are internally 

variable in alteration intensity and style, commonly with several different overprinting phases of 

alteration.  At Copper Peak the alteration boundaries roughly follow primary layering in 

pyroxenite and mimic the orientation of K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes.   

 

The SW sides of Lorraine Peak (Main Zone area) and Copper Peak are dip slope surfaces of 

alteration sheets and expose broad areas of surface copper mineralization.  Mapping supports 

the extension of the Lower Main – Main Zone mineralized alteration panel further southeast to 

partly sky-out over Weber Ridge, then intersect the north side of Copper Peak.  Drilling to date 

in these areas has intersected zones of high-grade copper but without significant depth extent, 

supporting the sheet model for alteration and mineralization.  The Bishop Zone, also known for 

its high-grade copper intersections is interpreted to extend in a SW-dipping alteration panel 

underneath Copper Ridge.  A single drill hole in 2006 tested this model and did intersect an 

alteration zone at the projected depth. 

 

Faults cut and shuffle the alteration panels making it difficult to regionally follow a single panel 

and correlate well mineralized sheets along strike; caution must be used on interpreting the 

extension and offset of a single sheet as there is no way to distinguish one sheet from another 

and various smaller lenses of alteration occur locally.

Figure 10. Lorraine Main Area, Interpretive Photo 
Annotated photo of the Lorraine Main area with a view south from Lorraine Peak showing southwest-dipping K-

feldspar-dominant alteration panels; purple where moderate to strong alteration, red where intense alteration with 

strong copper mineralization.   

 

Alteration is genetically linked to the K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry stock to the south of the 

Lorraine Main area, the South Stock.  Northwest-trending, southwest-dipping dykes of K-

feldspar megacrystic porphyry extend from the South Stock into pyroxenite on Copper Ridge.  

The porphyry dykes contain disseminated blebs of chalcopyrite and magnetite, they are variably 

K-feldspar altered internally, but intrude strongly altered pyroxenite.  Alteration boundaries 

follow the same orientation as the porphyry dykes.  Scattered dykes and sills of porphyry occur 

farther northwest in Bishop Bowl and in North Cirque; monzonite dykes and sills are 

volumetrically more abundant.  Monzonite is interpreted to be the lateral equivalent of the 

porphyry dykes emanating from the South Stock.  Alteration also overprints monzonite-

pyroxenite contacts.  The strongest and most copper-rich mineralization in the Lorraine Main 

area occurs in the zone of monzonite dykes and sills along the northwest-extension of the South 

Stock intrusions. The K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry is modeled as the heat and copper source 

for the alteration in the Main Zone area. 

 

 

Copper Ridge (Lorraine Main area) 

 

Copper Ridge extends east from Copper Peak with a view south over Page Bowl and northeast 

over Bishop Bowl.  The area was mapped in detail as it has excellent outcrop exposure and 

numerous copper showings along the ridge crest and down both flanks towards Bishop Bowl 

and Page Bowl. (Figure 7). 

 

Copper Ridge is underlain by pyroxenite and minor melasyenite intruded by SW-dipping 

leucocratic K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes and sills, all of which are cut by NE-

trending, sub-vertical quartz-bearing leucosyenite dykes.  Pyroxenite locally displays strong 

primary layering defined by grained size variation and local megacrystic K-feldspar (primary 

within pyroxenite).  Patches of melasyenite display trachytic texture with K-feldspar mineral 

alignment sub-parallel to the SW-dipping primary pyroxenite layering.  K-feldspar megacrystic 

porphyry dykes are inferred to intrude along primary layering within pyroxenite.   

 

Alteration ranges from strong to intense biotite alteration in pyroxenites to overprinting weak to 

intense K-feldspar alteration in both pyroxenite and K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes.

overprinted by a weak to intense pink K-feldspar phase as a pervasive wash and locally as pods 

of medium to coarse grained recrystallized K-feldspar and K-feldspar pegmatite.  Alteration 

sheets are also SW-dipping and mimic the orientation of primary layering and porphyry sills.  

Veins of grey and pink K-feldspar+diopside+biotite+magnetite also dip between 30 and 50 

degrees to the SW.  There is a strong spatial correlation between strong to intense alteration 

and the porphyry dykes. 

 

Copper mineralization occurs in several styles on Copper Ridge: 1) as 1-3 mm clots with 

magnetite within weakly K-feldspar altered porphyry dykes and sills, 2) as fine grained 

disseminated chalcopyrite+bornite+magnetite with sugary grey K-feldspar alteration, 3) as 

chalcopyrite in veins of grey K-feldspar+diopside+biotite+/-albite, as chalcopyrite in quartz 

veins associated with leucosyenite dykes. 

 

Ekland Ridge (Lorraine Main area) 

 

Eckland ridge is 1 kilometer due south of Lorraine.  Baxter 2006 continues;  "Ekland Ridge has 
some of the most spectacular copper mineralization in the Lorraine Main area, along is 

southwestern flank.  The NW-trending ridge parallels the Lorraine ridge to the north and shows 

similar styles of alteration and mineralization.  Several holes were drilled on Ekland Ridge in 

2004 with some high-grade intersections of copper mineralization cut off by faults.  The ridge 

has very good outcrop exposure and was an area for detailed lithology and alteration mapping 

in 2006 to study and record alteration-mineralization relationships. 

 

Ekland Ridge is underlain by variably altered pyroxenite with monzonite and minor leucocratic 

K-feldspar megacrystic porphyry dykes and sills.  Monzonite dykes have moderate to steeply 

SW-dipping contacts.  NE-trending sub-vertical leucosyenite dykes and pink K-feldspar 

pegmatite dykes, some of the best-exposed on the property, cut across all earlier phases. At least 

2 generations of NE-trending high angle, low displacement faults cut across Ekland Ridge.   

 

Alteration on Ekland Ridge includes moderate to strong biotite alteration of pyroxenite and 

weak to intense K-feldspar alteration of pyroxenite, monzonite, and K-feldspar megacrystic 

porphyry.  K-feldspar alteration outlines a moderately (40°-60°) SW-dipping sheet with sharp 

and locally diffuse alteration boundaries.  The alteration sheet is cut off by a NE fault along the 

upper (southeastern) end of the ridge, but appears to pinch out at this end; the sheet extends to 

the north off the ridge, under cover.  Albite+/-epidote+/-garnet alteration as well as increased 

magnetite+diopside+/-albite veining increase towards the core of the alteration sheet.  

 

Mineralization on Ekland Ridge occurs predominantly in intense, fine-grained grey K-

feldspar+/-biotite alteration as fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite.   

 

 

All Alone Dome 

 

All Alone Dome"… 1 kilometer west-northwest of Lorraine …"is along strike from the 
southwest-dipping alteration panels through the Lorraine Main area.  The dome has limited 

ridge-crest outcrop and talus along the upper flanks, lower flanks are tree covered with very 

limited outcrop. .

33 

 

Variably altered pyroxenite underlies All Alone Dome, cut by northwest, east and northeast 

high-angle faults.  Northeast-trending leucosyenite dykes cut pyroxenite.   

 

Alteration sequence on All Alone Dome follows the sequence defined in the Lorraine Main area.  

Early biotite alteration of pyroxenite is overprinted by grey and pink K-feldspar+diopside+/-

albite+/-magnetite alteration.  Alteration is weak to strong along the ridge crest, and strong, 

pervasive K-feldspar alteration is found in talus down the west flank.  Pink ksp veins are locally 

common. Known mineralization along the ridge crest is limited to local disseminated pyrite." 
 
The Dome is flanked on its south and east sides by moderate to strong copper and weak gold in 
soil anomalies.  The bedrock source of these anomalies are unknown but Baxter suggests that 
they may represent indications of extensions of the Lower Main zone of Lorraine. Lindinger 
suggests that these anomalies may in part have originated from glacially derived debris from the 
Lorraine ridge and North Cirque areas. 
 

 

West Rhonda 

 

The West Rhonda area is located on the east side of the Lorraine Property and is centered about 
2 kilometers northwest of the Rhonda target and includes the Fox MINFILE occurrence. 
 

The area is underlain by Hogem monzonite and fine to medium grained diorite, also interpreted 

to belong to the oldest Phase 1 Hogem rocks.  Coarse grained diorite and gabbro that is 

correlated with an early Duckling phase occur in a northeast(?)-trending domain with grain 

size-gradational contacts into Hogem diorite and monzonite.  Sub 2 metre-wide, steeply dipping 

east-northeast-trending feldspar-hornblende porphyry and leucosyenite dykes cut the coarse 

grained diorite.  Multiple generations of NW and NE-trending faults cut all intrusive phases, 

late NE faults are regionally consistent and cut NW faults. 

 

Alteration is limited to weak to moderate potassic alteration, commonly biotite alteration of 

mafic minerals and patchy pink K-feldspar flooding.  Pink veins of K-feldspar 1mm to 2 cm wide 

are common.  At the margins of the coarse grained Duckling diorite, the Hogem monzonite is 

moderate to strongly K-feldspar flooded.  

 

Mineralization at the Fox showing occurs as weak to moderate chalcopyrite disseminations in 

the medium grained diorite.  High Cu samples in talus were collected at the base of the cliffs 

below the showing area. 

 

Steelehead 

 

The Steelehead area lies 5 kilometers North of Lorraine and …" is predominantly underlain by 
Hogem monzonite and fine to medium grained Hogem diorite.  The ridge immediately south of 

Steele creek is underlain by leucocratic megacrystic K-feldspar porphyry with variable 

megacryst content; contacts of the megacrystic body are inferred to be NE-trending.  Dykes of 

pink fine to medium grained syenite, leucosyenite, as well as feldspar and feldspar-hornblende 

porphyry dykes trend northeast across the area.

Alteration within the Hogem rocks outside of the megacrystic body is limited to potassic 

alteration around syenitic dykes.  Regional weak greenschist facies alteration has altered mafics 

in the Hogem rocks to chlorite, this is overprinted by local secondary biotite.  Pink K-feldspar 

alteration occurs along syenite dyke intrusions and as local grey and pink K-feldspar veins.  

Along the western margin of the megacrystic body K-feldspar alteration is fine grained and 

sugary.  Within the megacrystic body, pervasive grey to pink K-feldspar alteration is locally 

moderate to strong with increased pink –feldspar veins and pink K-feldspar+quartz veins. 

 

The Steelehead area boasts some of the most widespread copper anomalies in soils, along the 

northern side of the area in talus samples, and in the overburden-covered basin at the 

headwaters of Steele Creek.  Chalcopyrite+pyrite is found in high-grade veins associated with 

syenite dykes and alteration, particularly well exposed in north-facing cirque walls in the north 

part of the area.  Disseminated chalcopyrite is found in fine grained sugary K-feldspar 

alteration along the margin of the megacrystic porphyry body.  The high copper values in soils 

in the headwaters basin are interpreted to be derived from copper mineralization associated 

with the megacrystic body.  

 

Misty 

 

The Misty area lies along the southern margin of the Duckling Creek syenite complex in the 

southern half of the Jan-Tam-Misty claim block.  The northwest-elongate area has high cirque 

walls on the southwest side with cliffs that overlook a northwest-trending fault marked by a lake 

and rusty notches in the ridgeline.  Very strongly altered and foliated rocks with strong 

chalcopyrite+bornite+/-chalcocite mineralization occur in outcrop in the cliffs and talus 

immediately south of the lake, as well as in the cliffs along strike to the northwest and along the 

ridge to the southeast. 

 

Duckling Creek rocks occur on both sides of the major fault that marks the Misty trend.  To the 

north of the fault are K-feldspar megacrystic rocks: leucocratic, monzonitic megacrystic 

porphyry (Dcz) immediately north of the fault in the area of the lake, with more widespread 

mafic K-feldspar megacrystic unit (Dcm) to the east and north.  To the south of the fault are 

strongly foliated, potassic and calc-potassic altered rocks of uncertain protolith cut by dykes of 

weak to moderately altered megacrystic porphyry, both mafic matrix megacrystic unit (Dcm) 

and leucocratic porphyry (Dcz).  Westward, alteration and foliation in the rocks decreases and 

the protolith is a fine to medium grained grey syenite with <50% mafics (amphibole and biotite).  

This bounding unit, a mafic-rich syenite, has similar mineral composition to the mafic 

megacrystic unit and is inferred to be a fine grained border phase of the same unit.  The contact 

with Hogem granodiorite with the medium grained mafic-rich syenite farther to the east-

southeast is a sharp intrusive contact, seen in outcrop along the cliffs at the northern end of the 

Misty trend. 

 

The Misty area is unique in its strongly foliated, altered rocks immediately south of the fault.  

Finely banded, well foliated rock is mineralogically segregated into 1mm to 1cm bands of 

alternating amphibole+biotite+garnet domains and fine grained microcline domains, there is 

little to no albite present.  Apatite, sphene, and epidote grains also occur within or adjacent to

the mafic domains (McLeod, 2006).  Fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite occur 

locally within this fine grained, sugary rock.   

The protolith of these strongly altered and foliated rocks has been debated; however there is 

strong evidence for correlation with the Duckling mafic megacrystic unit: the gradational 

deformation boundary on the west side of the zone into medium grained mafic syenite rock as 

well as zones of relatively weak deformation within the zone preserving relict K-feldspar 

megacrysts. 

 

The megacrystic dykes that cut the well foliated, altered rock are themselves variably deformed.  

The dykes are well foliated internally, to rigid and boudinaged, to relatively undeformed, 

recognizable mafic K-feldspar megacrystic unit.  The dykes are weakly to strongly K-feldspar 

altered.  Early grey K-feldspar alteration is overprinted by pervasive to patchy, coarse pink K-

feldspar alteration and veins. There are several cross-cutting vein generations that range in 

colour (white to pink) and are dominantly K-feldspar with variable amounts of albite(?). All 

veins cut the older alteration and foliation of the wall rock.  

 

The early finely banded foliation in the strongly altered and mineralized rocks trends 

consistently northwest.  Fabrics associated with this deformation are ductile to brittle.  The 

fabric is cut off by the main bounding west-northwest trending fault, a reactivated brittle 

structure.   

 

The Misty zone is interpreted to be a deformation zone along the boundary between a chilled 

border phase and the "mafic" K-feldspar megacrystic unit.  The Misty deformation zone was 

active as a brittle-ductile shear zone during intrusion of at least the later Duckling intrusive 

phases. Deformation fabrics suggest synchronous deformation and dyke intrusion, supported by 

the variable states of internal dyke foliation and folded dykes.  Alteration was also progressive 

over the evolution of the deformation zone, from early fine grained, mineralogically segregated 

alteration in the wall rock, to later pink K-feldspar and veining that cuts the early deformation 

fabric.   

 

Mineralization in the Misty area is commonly fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and 

bornite, up to 40% volume locally.  Grain size is very fine and mineralization is sometimes 

difficult to see in poor light.  The fine grained, sugary grey K-feldspar alteration is the most 

receptive common host to mineralization as northwest-elongate pods parallel to the early 

foliation.  Mineralization occurs locally along the margins of K-feldspar porphyry dykes.  There 

is generally very little copper mineralization in the later pink K-feldspar alteration phases.

Boundary Area 

 

The Boundary and Midway showings occur near the northern margin of the Duckling Creek 

Complex in what is collectively called the Boundary area. The area is poorly exposed and is 

mostly below tree line.  A natural clearing at the Boundary showing exposes float boasting some 

of the best mineralization yet found in the area, otherwise rock on surface is scarce.  Hills rise 

up to the south of the Boundary and Midway showings, with outcrop along the side of the ridge.   

 

The Boundary area includes the margin of the Duckling Creek syenite complex where Hogem 

medium grained monzonite is in inferred fault contact with strongly altered Duckling Creek 

rocks (Figure 29).  On the ridge to the south of the Boundary and Midway showings strongly K-

feldspar+white mica altered rocks have an inferred primary syenite protolith (Ds).  The faulted 

margin is also marked by large (<2m) wide quartz veins in Duckling Creek rocks.  Down into 

the trees to the north, in the immediate Midway and Boundary showing areas, rock from old 

diamond drill core shows strong alteration of an uncertain protolith. 

 

Alteration along the ridge to the south of the immediate showings is slightly different than the 

alteration seen in old core.  Along the ridge, Duckling rocks immediately adjacent to the fault 

are strongly K-feldspar + white mica altered comprised of 100% Pink-orange K-

feldspar+interstitial white mica.  In core, the alteration is strong grey K-feldspar, including fine 

grained sugary alteration with strong disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization,

overprinted by late pink K-feldspar alteration phases, with an uncertain protolith.  It appears 

that the strong, sugary grey K-feldspar alteration with mineralization is cut off by the bounding 

northwest fault, or is overprinted by the later stage K-feldspar+white mica alteration.

West Showing 

 

The West showing lies immediately west of the southern end of the Boundary area, described 

above.  The showing occurs on a steep west-facing ridge flank that falls off into the Haha Creek 

Valley to the north.   

 

The area is underlain by the orange syenite unit, with northwest-trending, steeply-dipping pods 

and slivers of relict mafic megacrystic unit (Dcm).  The mafic megacrystic domains are variably 

K-feldspar altered, and contacts with the orange syenite are diffuse and strongly altered.  The 

orange syenite is itself strongly K-feldspar+white mica altered and what has locally been 

mapped as intrusive, may be strongly altered mafic megacrystic unit with the protolith altered 

beyond recognition.  Northeast faults cut the area with approximately 100 to 200 metre spacing, 

but generally have less than 10 metres of lateral displacement. 

 

The West showing occurs within a northwest-trending mafic megacrystic domain approximately 

200 metres long.  The megacrystic body is locally strongly altered to fine grained grey K-

feldspar+biotite+disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite with <10cm biotite veins and <2cm 

wide chalcopyrite and bornite veins.  Later stages of alteration include patches of pink K-

feldspar flooding and veining.   

 

Copper mineralization in outcrop and in float was found for 250 metres across the slope 

including the showing.  Chalcopyrite and bornite are finely disseminated in fine grained sugary 

alteration, and also occur in <2cm veins locally.  At the West showing massive chalcopyrite and

bornite occur with increased biotite and mineralized veining; there is a strong spatial 

correlation between biotite veining and mineralization.  Some biotite veins show conjugate 

northwest and northeast control, the strong mineralization in the immediate area may 

concentrate at a structural intersection.   

 

There is no other mineralization in the cliffs immediately along strike to the south. Outcrop is 

limited to the north under tree cover, however the presence of a north-northeast trending fault 

suggest that the zone of altered and mineralized relict mafic lenses is cut off or is offset into the 

valley under cover if it continues to the north. 

 

                                                                                                   

Cirque Showing 

 

The Cirque showing occurs to the west, along the ridge, from the West showing.  Outcrop occurs 

along the lip of a north-facing bowl; the Cirque showing is at the top of the bowl. 

 

The area is underlain by the orange syenite unit, weakly to strongly altered.  One to two metre-

wide dykes of fine grained leucosyenite trend steeply northeast across the top of the bowl. 

 

At the Cirque showing the alteration changes to fine grained grey K-feldspar+biotite alteration, 

locally with disseminated chalcopyrite.  Veins of biotite+/-albite+chalcopyrite and malachite 

are concordant with the alteration.  A pink K-feldspar wash and patchy pink K-feldspar+white 

mica alteration overprints the grey K-feldspar phase.  The grey K-feldspar+biotite alteration 

zone is <15 metres side and trends northwest.  Copper mineralization is limited to <1 metre 

lenses and pods and biotite veins. 

 

The Grey K-feldspar+biotite alteration is interpreted to be an early stage alteration, 

overprinted and engulfed by the orange syenite intrusion and associated pink K-feldspar+white 

mica+/-pyrite alteration.  At Cirque, the mineralized lens may be a relict altered mafic 

megacrystic pod, similar to the occurrences in West showing area. 

 

 

Slide 

 

The Slide area lies near the northeastern margin of the Duckling Creek Complex, on the north 

side of Haha Creek.   

 

The Slide area is underlain predominantly by a mafic K-feldspar megacrystic phase of the 

Duckling Creek Complex separated from Hogem monzonite and quartz monzonite to the 

northwest across a series of steep northwest-trending faults.  Along the bounding fault, on the 

eastern side of the area, an orange K-feldspar syenite phase intrudes both the K-feldspar 

megacrystic unit as well as Hogem monzonite on either side of the faulted boundary.  There are 

also hints of Takla volcanic rocks in the area of the Slide showings.  Rocks here are intensely 

altered and bounded by the K-feldspar megacrystic unit, but show relict volcanic breccia 

textures, possibly rafts of strongly altered Takla volcanic rocks within the Duckling Intrusive 

Complex.

Alteration is most intense in the immediate area of the Slide trenches with fine grained, sugary 

K-feldspar+biotite+magnetite+chalcopyrite with veins of biotite and K-feldspar to 1 cm wide.  

Later stage pink K-feldspar+/-white mica washes over the earlier alteration and also cuts 

across the early foliation in veins. Northwest-trending alteration boundaries are relatively sharp 

over 2-3 metres from weakly K-feldspar+biotite altered rock to intense, sugary grey K-feldspar 

altered rock.  There is a garnet halo to the intense alteration, prismatic, dark brown garnet 

occurs within approximately 20 metres of the alteration boundary. 

 

Alteration is more regionally manifested in the Slide area as K-feldspar and quartz veins 

overprinting selective-pervasive biotite alteration.  Towards the faulted boundary with the 

Hogem rocks, associated with the orange syenite unit, strong pink K-feldspar+white mica 

alteration is dominant. 

 

Mineralization at Slide is almost exclusively limited to the intensely altered northwest-trending 

domains in the area of the slide trenches.  Fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite 

occur within a fine grained sugary K-feldspar+biotite rock.  Chalcocite and a distinctive pale 

blue azurite occur on fractures.  Quartz veins containing blebby chalcopyrite occur in to the 

west of the peak at the top of the Slide showing area.  The veins are 1-2 cm wide and contain 

mineralization only locally."

EXPLORATION 
 
Work on the Lorraine-Jajay property, which include valid titles located as early as 1931, has 
included 182 diamond drill holes and 22 percussion holes, for a total of 204 drill holes totaling 
31,080.84 metres. This drilling is summarized as follows: prior to the year 2000, 133 holes 
were completed totaling 16,458.71 metres; from 2000 to 2005 Eastfield oversaw the drilling of 
64 drill holes for 12,016.13 metres; in 2006 Teck Cominco drilled seven holes totaling 2,606.0 
metres in the Lorraine area. 
 
Also completed were numerous soil, rock trenching airborne and ground geophysical programs.  
For additional details on past exploration program please refer to prior reports including the 
report titled  "Summary Report on the Lorraine-Jajay Property" dated May 17, 2006, which is 
filed on www.sedar.com. 
 
The 2006 exploration program on the combined Lorraine-Jajay and Jan/Tam/Misty properties 
comprised 37.5 kilometres of IP geophysical surveying on three grids, 17 diamond drill holes 
totaling 5,675.8 metres in the Misty, Slide and Lorraine areas, an airborne geophysical survey 
over the extent of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex, detailed geological mapping in the 
Misty, Slide, Boundary and Lorraine areas, soil geochemical sampling on the southern slope of 
All Alone Dome and talus fine sampling west of the Rhonda area. The results of this most 
recent work continued to expand known areas of mineralization in the Lorraine area, discovered 
a new zone of significant mineralization in the Slide area, intersected several significant 
mineralized intercepts over a large area in the Misty area and improved the understanding of the 
alteration and mineralizing systems. 
 
A total of 37.5 line kilometres of Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical surveying was 
completed on three grids: Misty (17.0 kilometres); Slide (7.75 kilometres) and Tam (12.75) 
kilometres. The geophysical surveys were completed by Scott Geophysics Ltd., of Vancouver, 
B.C.  The Induced Polarization survey utilized a pole dipole array at an "a" spacing of 50 
metres and "n" separations of 1 to 5. The results of these surveys are summarized as follows: 
 

Misty: 
 
Two IP chargeability anomalies were outlined on the Misty grid.  A 2.8 kilometre long by 50 to 
150 metre wide anomaly, open to the northwest, has known mineral occurrences within it. Five 
widely spaced drill holes, up to 700 metres apart, were completed as a first test of this anomaly.  
 
A second anomaly, on strike and to the southeast of the first anomaly, is 400 metres long and 
remains open to the southeast with widths of 200 metres.  One drill hole has been completed to 
test this anomaly.

Slide: 
 
Three IP chargeability anomalies were outlined on the Slide grid. In the northwest part of the 
grid an anomaly measures approximately 400 metres long and 150 to 200 metres wide; In the 
centre of the grid the second anomaly is a minimum of 200 metres long by 150 metres wide and 
two copper occurrences are exposed on its western flank.  At the southern end of the grid a third 
anomaly was outlined by an earlier survey and is 500 metres long by 75-125 metres wide and 
open to the southeast. Geological mapping indicates that this southern anomaly may be a 
faulted extension of the central anomaly. Four drill holes on the Slide anomalies have been 
completed.

Boundary: 
 
A single geophysical line across the Boundary prospect defined a strong IP chargeability 
anomaly coincident with the known mineralization and although this anomaly weakens on the 
adjacent lines the target appears to extend for several hundred metres in both directions.

An airborne geophysical survey was flown by Fugro Airborne Surveys in early August, 2006, 
and covered an area of approximately 15 kilometres by 30 kilometres with line spacing at 100 
metres. The survey was designed to cover the known extent of the Duckling Creek Syenite 
Complex within the property boundaries. 
 
Figure 15 shows the results of the magnetic survey as well as the location of all previous drill 
holes, especially showing the location of the 2006 drilling. The image has been blended, on the 
northeastern side, with pre-existing airborne magnetic data. 
 
The magnetic image will be a significant aid to interpreting the geology and controls on 
mineralization on the property. It is clearly evident that strong northwesterly trends in the 
magnetic highs (red to purple colors) parallel the trends of the major mineralized zones in the 
western portion of the property. In more detail it is also apparent that a geological/magnetic 
connection can be interpreted between mineralized zones such as the Misty and 2Good zones. 
Similarly the Bishop-Main-All Alone Dome-Boundary and Slide Zones form a linear trend of 
magnetic highs. The Ekland Zone appears to lie along a separate magnetic trend that extends for 
some distance northwesterly which may offer new exploration potential. Several linear 
magnetic highs with no previous reference to mineralized zones may offer excellent exploration 
targets and will be followed up with geologic mapping to determine their potential.

In 2005 a talus/soil sampling program was carried out to test areas where historical exploration 
data was lacking.  An area of approximately 3.5 x 2.5 kilometres to the south of the Dorothy 
target, and an area of 5.5 x 2.5 kilometres west of the Rhonda target were chosen.  The samples 
(totaling 390) were collected at 100 metre spacing along traverses that followed the topographic 
contour at the base of talus slopes.  The talus/soil sampling program led to outlining an area of 
approximately 2 x 2 kilometres of anomalous copper geochemistry in the northern area, west 
and north of the Rhonda target, as defined by samples exceeding a threshold value of 200 ppm 
copper.  The range of values in these samples was from 29 ppm to 2092 ppm copper.  This area

has seen little previous exploration and preliminary prospecting has indicated that this is a very 
prospective target area with chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization occurring in several places. 
 
A further 33 samples were obtained in 2006 to fill in a gap in the 2005 sampling and served to 
extend the anomalous area to the southwest. This large area of anomalous copper will require 
careful evaluation in future programs. 
 
A geochemical soil sampling grid was completed over a 1.5 by 1.0 kilometre area northwest of 
the Main Zone, on the southern slopes of All Alone Dome. Two strong copper anomalies are 
defined by a 200 ppm Cu threshold contour (values range up to 10,380 ppm Cu): (1) on the 
eastern side of the grid an anomaly extends the full one kilometre length of the grid, is up to 
500 metres wide and is open to the east, south and north; and (2) a second anomaly occurs on 
the western portion of the grid and is outlined over an area 600 to 800 metres long and 50 to 
200 metres wide. The eastern anomaly is coincident with a moderate chargeability IP anomaly 
that was outlined in a 2004 survey. No drilling has been undertaken in this area, and it is 
interpreted to represent a probable significant northwest extension of the Main Zone.

DRILLING 
 
The first diamond drilling on the Lorraine claims occurred in 1949 and since that time most 
drilling has been on the core Lorraine claims. Work on the Lorraine-Jajay property, which 
include valid titles located as early as 1931, has included 182 diamond drill holes and 22 
percussion holes, for a total of 204 drill holes totaling 31,080.84 metres. This drilling is 
summarized as follows: prior to the year 2000, 133 holes were completed totaling 16,458.71 
metres; from 2000 to 2005 Eastfield oversaw the drilling of 64 drill holes for 12,016.13 metres. 
Twenty diamond drill holes have been completed on the Dorothy claims and approximately the 
same number in several scattered locations throughout the remainder of the property.  Most 
holes drilled after 1972 have their replicated splits stored at three core storage facilities on the 
property.  The results of significant mineralized intercepts from previous drilling, and their hole 
locations are listed in Appendices 3 and 4 respectively. 
 
2006 Drilling 
 
Seventeen core holes totaling 5,675.8 metres were completed in 2006 by Britton Brothers 
Diamond Drilling of Smithers, B.C.  Ten of these holes were completed on the Misty and Slide 
targets and the rest were broadly spaced on targets around the core Lorraine Zone.  The drill 
hole collars were located by GPS and down hole surveys were taken using acid testing.  Due to 
the preliminary nature of these drill holes this level of accuracy was considered adequate by 
Teck-Cominco management.  All holes were sampled in their entirety.  
 

Misty Drilling: 
 
Six widely spaced holes were drilled along the previously untested 3.5 kilometre long IP 
geophysical anomaly that outlines the Misty target. The first five holes tested the northern end 
of the target and were spaced over approximately 1.8 kilometres.  The sixth hole was drilled 1.7 
kilometres to the southeast on the southeastern end of this open-ended geophysical target. 
 
Four of these holes intersected copper mineralization with grades ranging from 0.11% to 0.68% 
copper over intervals of 3.0 to 27.3 metres. The most significant intercepts were: 105.1 metres 
grading 0.13% copper in hole JTM-06-2 (including 27.3 metres grading 0.21% copper); 29.2 
metres grading 0.11% copper in hole JTM-06-4; and 15.0 metres grading 0.11% copper in hole 
JTM-06-5. 
 
The Misty zone is now known to host mineralization over a strike length of 3.5 kilometres and 
requires further drilling to further define these preliminary results.  
 

Slide Drilling: 
 
A 1.5 kilometre long, open-ended IP geophysical anomaly at the Slide target was tested by four 
holes, three at the northern end and one a kilometre to the south. Drill holes JTM-06-7 and 10, 
spaced one kilometre apart, intersected strong mineralization representing the first drill 
intercepts of copper mineralization in this area where only one copper occurrence in a trench 
was known. These holes represent a significant northwesterly extension of the Lorraine mineral 
system. The results of these holes are as follows:

The mineralization at the Slide is also spatially associated with pyroxenite and hosts alteration 
very similar to the Lorraine area.  The orientation of the mineralization is unknown but the 
stratigraphy is interpreted to be steeply east dipping.

Seven holes were completed at various sites in the Lorraine area. Two holes (L06-107, 108), 
located approximately 100 to 200 metres southwest of the Main/Weber Zone, tested adjacent 
structural blocks. Hole L-06-107 intersected 21.8 metres grading 0.15% copper in strongly 
altered intrusive rocks resembling Main Zone style mineralization. This step-out indicates 
favourable potential to expand the mineral zones in this region. 
 
Three holes (L06-109, 110, 111) were drilled in the south Lorraine ridge, Copper Peak, and 
Bishop Bowl areas, southeast of the Main Zone, all intersected copper mineralization and 
indicate the potential for the discovery of new zones in these areas. The best intercept was at 
Copper Peak where hole L-06-111 returned 15.2 metres grading 0.41% copper. This hole lies 
300 metres west of the well-mineralized Bishop Zone and 250 metres east of previously 
reported drill hole 04-89 which intersected 20.69 metres grading 0.77% copper and 0.14 g/t 
gold.  These drill holes indicate the potential for mineralization over a large previously untested 
area that will require future drill testing. 
 

Bishop Bowl Area Drilling: 
 
One hole (L06-113) was completed in the Bishop Bowl area, approximately 180 metres 
northwest of the northern most Bishop Zone drill hole and 300 metres southeast of the southern

most Main Zone drill hole. Hole L-06-113 intersected 27.8 metres (starting at 15.2 metres) 
grading 0.21% copper.  A second intercept in this hole returned 39.7 metres grading 0.11% 
copper (starting at 243.8 metres).  These mineralized zones are very significant and indicate the 
potential for continuity between the Main and Bishop Zones.  
 
Eckland Area drilling 
 
One hole (L06-112) was drill south of Ekland Ridge 300 meters downdip of the good surface 
mineralization.  The hole intersected two areas of strong K-feldspar alteration with fine 
disseminated pyrite.  There were no significant zones of copper mineralization which raises the 
question of whether the drill hole truly tested the downdip extension of surface mineralization 
or has the surface copper mineralization decreased within the 300 dip or has unmapped faulting 
caused additional shuffling of the surface mineralization. The well mineralized zones on Ekland 
Ridge remain poorly tested and understood.  Additional work is warranted on Ekland Ridge to 
unravel the structure and orientation, grade and continuity of the mineralization. 
 
 

SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
For past exploration programs please refer to prior reports including the report titled  "Summary 
Report on the Lorraine-Jajay Property" dated May 17, 2006, which is filed on www.sedar.com. 
 
2006 Sampling Procedures. 
 
Sampling was completed by employees of Mincord Exploration Consultants Ltd. under the 
guidance and direction of Teck Cominco project management. A review of these procedures 
has determined that they meet the quality control and assurance standards. 
 
Drill core is placed in numbered core boxes at the drill site by the driller's helper whenever the 
core tube is pulled up and it contains core.  A wooden run block marks the bottom end of the 
core recovered in the box each time the tube is pulled.  The driller keeps track of the 
footage/depth by counting the number of ten-foot rods in the hole. The "zero" point, usually the 
top of the casing or the surface of the drill-deck is discussed and agreed upon by the driller and 
the geologist prior to the first hole being drilled.  Diamond drill core is usually transported daily 
by helicopter, all terrain vehicle, or pickup truck from the drill to the core storage and sampling 
facility located on the property. 
 
Here the core is laid out, metric conversion of the run-blocks footages is carried out and the 
core boxes are labeled with a weather-proof metal tag.  The laid-out core is examined by the 
project geologist who does a preliminary evaluation of the hole's potential, identifies the main 
rock types, marks the main contacts and mineralization zones.  A technician measures core 
recovery between wooden blocks and records these on a recovery sheet.  Any mistakes made by 
the driller in marking the boxes or run blocks are usually caught by the next stage.  Core 
photographs or digital images are taken three boxes at a time.  The core is then moved to the 
core logging shack where the geologist uses a computer Access based logging system to record 
the geology.  The geologist also enters the sample intervals, generally 1 to 3 metres depending 
on variations in rock types or the intensity and character of the mineralization.

54 

 
The core is then moved to the next shack to be split using a mechanical core splitter with half 
the sample bagged and the other half left in the core boxes for record purposes  to be stacked on 
site.  The core splitters fill in of triple tags books of pre-printed sample numbers using the 
intervals entered and marked by the geologist.  The splitter and his helper note the interval in 
the tag book and place each sample in a heavy-duty poly sample bag also inserting a uniquely 
numbered tear-off section from the assay book.  A corresponding number is stapled into the 
core box at the bottom of the proper sample interval.  No other number or mark is made on the 
core or sample bags and from that point on no person handling the core when it is shipped, 
received at the analytical laboratory can determine what hole or even what property the core is 
from.  The poly sample bags are closed and sealed with a cinch strap and bundled in groups of 5 
or 6 (weighing 20 to 30 kilograms) into an opaque rice-sack which is also sealed.  During the 
core splitting there are normally several people present, and none of the core-splitters wear 
jewelry.  No other sample preparation is carried out on the property. 

 
 

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
For past exploration programs please refer to prior reports including the report titled  "Summary 
Report on the Lorraine-Jajay Property" dated May 17, 2006, which is filed on www.sedar.com. 

 
2006 Program 

To trace samples quickly, each drill hole was allotted a 1-2-3 shipment number with A-B-C 
suffixes for drill holes shipped over several weeks.  Each week, samples were shipped in rice 
bags duly marked with the shipment number.  The samples went by truck to Fort St. James by 
bonded carrier where they were either trucked to Global Discovery Labs in Vancouver directly, 
or trucked to Prince George and then sent to Vancouver via Greyhound Courier, depending on 
the shipper's schedule.  A sample list accompanied each shipment and Acme sent confirmations 
of shipments received.  Assay certificates also referred to that shipment number. 
 
 

Analytical Controls. 
 
The following discussion of the analytical controls used for the 2006 program was provided by 
Paul Baxter, P.Geo., Project Manager for Teck Cominco Limited. As part of the QA/QC 
program for the Lorraine – JTM drilling, a program of standard insertion and duplicate 
sampling was undertaken.  Three copper – gold standards were obtained from CDN Resource 
Laboratories Ltd and were routinely inserted into the sample stream from the field.  Appendix 1 
contains the data sheets for the three standards used and Table 4 summarizes the recommended 
value and the "Between Lab" two standard deviation values.

During the 2006 drill program, every 11

th
 sample was a control sample such that sample 11 was 

standard 1, sample 22 was standard 2, sample 33 was standard 3, sample 44 was a duplicate and 
sample 55 would rotate back to standard 1.  The duplicate sample referred to here would be the 
second half of the core from the core sample immediately preceding the duplicate sample 
number.  
 
For the 2006 drill program, the analytical lab was changed to Global Discovery Labs (GDL) of 
Vancouver, BC.  The standard analytical package used on all samples was a multi-element ICP 
package and a trace level gold geochemical package.  For the 2006 drill program, any sample 
that returned an initial ICP copper value >2000ppm was flagged for re-analysis by assay 
methods for % copper.  Similar for gold, any initial geochemical gold result >200ppb Au was 
re-analyzed by fire assay for g/t Au.  The analytical procedures used by Global Discovery Labs 
are attached in Appendix 2.   
 
In addition to the standards and duplicates inserted in the field, Global Discovery Labs internal 
QA/QC program includes insertion of standards and repeat analysis.  For fire assay, every batch 
of 48 samples includes 7 repeats and 1 standard, for multi-element ICP every batch of 30 
samples includes 3 repeats and 1 standard and gold geochem includes 3 repeats and 2 standards 
in every 25 samples.  The standards used by Global Discovery Labs are listed in Table 2.

Field Analytical Standards 
 
In total, 129 standards were inserted into the drilling sample stream in the field. 
 
Copper Standard 
 
Figures 1, 3 and 5 show the three copper standard ICP results relative to the recommended 
value +/- two standard deviations.  The multi-element ICP results are generally within the 
accepted range of results but there is significant scatter of points and visually a large proportion 
of points fall below the recommended value.  The ICP results show a better accuracy for 
standard CGS-7 which is the higher copper grade standard. 
 
As all standards are greater than the 2000ppm copper threshold used to trigger a re-analysis, all 
standards would have also been analyzed by Assay techniques.  The assay quality copper results 
fall within the accepted ranges for the three standards and show a much tighter scatter around 
the recommended value relative to the original ICP results with CGS-7 (the higher grade 
standard) showing the tightest clustering of points (Figures 2, 4 and 6.)   
 
Gold Standard 
 
Figures 7, 9 and 11 show the geochemical gold results of the three standards used relative to the 
recommended value +/- two standard deviations.  Geochemical results for all three standards 
show poor accuracy with most samples under estimating gold and very few samples falling 
within the accepted values.  Again these samples have also undergone analysis by fire assay 
techniques with 94% of assay results falling within acceptable result limits (Figure 8, 10 and 
12).   
 
 
Assay vs Geochemical Analytical Techniques. 
 
As ICP copper results >2000ppm and gold geochemical results > 200ppb have been re-analyzed 
by assay techniques, a comparison of geochem vs assay results was undertaken.  For copper, it

57 

was found that assay quality results were on average only 4.0% higher than the original ICP 
result.  A further breakdown showed that the difference between ICP and assay copper results 
was much closer (only 2.6% difference) for original ICP results in the 5500 – 8600ppm range 
and slightly higher (4.8% difference) for original ICP results >8500ppm and 4.4% higher for 
original ICP results of 3000 – 5500ppm. 
 
The difference between gold geochem vs fire assay technique was much more dramatic with an 
average increase in gold values of 28% from geochemical to fire assay techniques.  No pattern 
could be recognized for what ranges of original gold geochem values would give the largest or 
smallest increase when re-analyzed by assay techniques. 
 

Lab Analytical Standards 
 
Figure 13 shows the copper ppm results for the in house ICP analytical standard "DA".  All 
results are less than the accepted value with 71% of the samples within the accepted value less 
10% range and the remaining 29% of samples within the accepted value less 20% range. Figure 
14 shows the gold ppb values for standard B200 used for the trace gold geochem analysis.  One 
third of the results plot above the accepted value + 20% range.  The few GDL's standards used 
for assay quality copper and gold results show very good comparisons to the accepted values. 
 
 

Repeat analysis 
 
Global Discovery Labs also re-analyzes several pulps per batch of samples as described earlier.  
There is excellent correlation between original and repeat analysis for ppm Cu (R

2
=0.998), % 

Cu (R
2
=0.9998) and g/t Au (R

2
=0.998).  The trace level gold results were only slightly lower 

with R
2
 of 0.951 which compares well to the 2004 results of 0.93 and much better than the 

2005 results of 0.61. 
 

Field and Lab Duplicates. 
 
39 duplicate samples were inserted in the field.  The copper results for these duplicates are 
shown in figure 15 showing a fairly good correlation (R

2
 = 0.993) between the two samples.  

No comparison is available for the trace level gold as all but three of the samples and their 
duplicates returned gold values of <10ppb.   
Global discovery labs also creates duplicate samples from the coarse rejects.  In total, 25 lab 
duplicates were created and the results for copper ppm are shown in figure 16.  There is 
excellent correlation of the original sample value to the lab duplicate value (R

2
=0.9989). Again 

there is no gold comparison as most samples had gold grades of <10 ppb Au. 
 

Comments 
 
For the 2006 drill program, within mineralized sections where all samples have undergone an 
assay analysis for copper and gold, the results can be considered accurate.  Where the average 
copper grade of a mineralized section is based on a mix of ICP and assay values the data 
suggests a possibility of only slightly higher copper grades for those samples analyzed by ICP 
techniques.  This may yield only a slightly higher copper average to the overall intersection.

With respect to the 2006 gold results, average gold grades given for several drill hole 
intersections combines both geochem and assay gold results.  As gold results can significantly 
increase by assay techniques, it is recommended that those drill hole intersection averages that 
include samples with geochem gold results be re-analyzed by assay techniques to give a more 
accurate gold average for those zones.  
 
For the 2007 program, it is recommended that all samples used to calculate an average grade of 
a mineralized intersection be analyzed by assay techniques for %Cu and g/t Au.  The new 
intersections in the Slide area have returned quite high silver values and it is recommended that 
a silver standard be inserted in 2007.  Intersections returning high ICP silver results should also 
be re-analyzed for silver by assay techniques.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
Misty 
 
On the Misty target El Paso Mining and Milling Ltd. outlined, by trenching, diamond and 
percussion drilling a mineralized zone 500 m long, averaging 11m wide that extends to a depth 
of at least 170m.  Mineralization comprises disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite, with 
veinlets of chalcopyrite and pyrite common along the contact margins of crosscutting syenite 
dikes and orthoclase veins.  Mineralization is reportedly hosted within a 1200 meter long 
northwest trending southwest dipping, chloritized, k-feldspar altered, hornblende-biotite gneiss.  
El Paso calculated a "reserve" of 3 million tonnes grading 0.6 per cent copper (Pilcher et al, 
1976). This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore is a 
"historical estimate" and should not be relied upon.   
 
Slide 
 
Union Miniere Explorations and Mining Corporation Limited (UMEX) completed trenching 
and diamond drilling (25 holes, 3629m) on the Boundary, Midway, Cirque and Fault targets.  
The best drill hole from the Boundary deposit is 0.68% Cu over 179.8m in hole 74-6 from 3.7-
183.5m including 1.59% Cu over 39.6m from 3.7-43.3m.  Copper mineralization occurs both as 
fine-grained disseminations and as fracture fillings within fine grained foliated and massive 
potassium altered syenites.  Umex calculated a "reserve" for the Boundary deposit of 7.2 
million tonnes grading 0.55 percent copper and 4.11 grams per tonne silver (Dyson, 1974).  
This calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore is a 
"historical estimate" and should not be relied upon.  New mapping information by Teck-
Cominco suggests this estimate may be too large.  
 
Lorraine 
 
Dr. G. R. Peatfield, in 1996, calculated the following resource for the Lorraine target.

Peatfield's 1996 calculation predates National Policy 43-101 implementation, and is therefore a 
"historical estimate", and due to the new information provided by subsequent exploration has 
been determined by the authors as no longer complying with the Instrument and should not be

relied upon.  Although new information described in subsequent reports and disclosures, 
including this report has improved delineation and enlarged the volume of mineralized rock 
used in Peatfield's resource estimate, the authors have not completed sufficient work to classify 
the historical estimate with the incorporated new information as current mineral resources or 
reserves.  
 

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
The authors are not aware of any other relevant data or information pertaining to the property 
that has not been reviewed or included in this report. 
 

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Lorraine-Jajay and Jan-Tam-Misty property is underlain by the alkalic Ducking Creek 
Syenite complex, that and hosts many alkalic copper-gold-silver+/-PGE deposits.   The deposits 
and mineral occurrences associated with the complex occur with the late phase syenite 
differentiates and host dominantly disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite copper mineralization.  
Anomalous levels of silver, gold and occasionally palladium occur with the copper 
mineralization.  This is characteristic of these deposit types in British Columbia.  Also 
characteristic is the multiple occurrence of several individual mineral deposits, as has been well 
documented at the Galore Creek, Mt. Polley, Afton and Copper Mountain districts of the 
Quesnel-Stikine Terrane , all of which are analogous to the Lorraine-Jajay system.  
 
The alteration systems associated with mineralization in the Lorraine, Elizabeth-Dorothy, 
Rhonda and West Rhonda, Misty, Slide, Boundary, Steelehead, All Alone Dome and 
Mackenzie  areas has been outlined by mapping to extend up to 6 kilometres by 15 kilometres.  
Each area hosts several known mineral occurrences defined by various level of exploration.  
The best copper and gold mineralization as currently known occurs a disseminations with 
biotite and is most commonly associated with texturally destructive extreme potassic alteration 
(resulting in a rock of syenitic composition) associated with "Phase 2" syenitic intrusions and 
spatially associated within and adjacent to large, generally northwest striking, southwest 
dipping masses of "Phase 1" pyroxenitic intrusions of the Duckling Creek Syenite Complex.   
Other significant styles of mineralization include magnetite gold and high grade copper +/- 
PGE veins within shears.  The protoliths were a variety of pre-existing intrusions ranging from 
monzonite, to diorite, to pyroxenite.  Significant copper occurrences are most often, but not 
always, associated with weak to moderate IP chargeability anomalies, while strong IP 
anomalies generally reflect dominantly pyrite occurrence. 
 
The Lorraine-All Alone Dome area appears to be the largest known alteration/mineralizing 
system of this type in British Columbia.  This northwesterly trending system is well expressed 
as a regional magnetic high anomaly. 
 
Drilling on the Slide target confirmed the presence of significant copper mineralization in two 
holes occurring one kilometre apart.  These new zones lie along strike from the Boundary 
deposit and further to the southeast, the All Alone Dome and Lorraine targets.

The Misty drilling showed that this area forms a large target, in excess of 3 kilometres length, 
that requires further drill testing.  The Misty Zone containing the historic resource requires 
additional work especially deeper drilling to determine its true economic potential.  Exploration 
to the southeast to determine the potential for connecting to the TooGood zone is also required. 
 
The copper in soil geochemical anomalies outlined on the southern flank of All Alone Dome 
(AAD) down hill of numerous copper bearing showings and combined with previous work, 
trenching and rock sampling  and IP anomalies may indicate a  northwestern extension of the 
Lower Main Zone.  This will require further IP geophysical surveying, drill testing and possibly 
trenching to better define the target. 
 
The Lorraine system, including the Lower and Upper Main Zones, Bishop Zone, Page Zone and 
Copper Peak area, has been shown by drilling and mapping in 2006 to have a greater potential 
for continuity and extent and will require further drilling to determine its true potential.  Large 
overburden covered areas within this target remain to be tested. 
 
The Ekland Ridge target received only one drill hole in 2006 and this was placed some 300 
metres southwest of exposed mineral showings.  Alteration and occurrences of mineralized 
float indicate that an overburden covered area of 1.5 kilometres in length remains to be tested.  
Interestingly, the showings on Ekland ridge appear to consistently report above average gold 
grades associated with strongly mineralized copper occurrences. 
 
Mineralization in the Rhonda area is associated with a linear, northeast trending diorite 
intrusion and flanking dykes that have intruded Takla volcanic rocks.  This system appears to 
cover an area of at least 500 metres by 1.5 kilometres and is characterized by potassium 
feldspar flooding and hosts copper mineralized magnetite veins. 
 
Regional geochemical exploration at the West Rhonda target has identified a large area of 
anomalous copper in soils that will require follow-up in future programs.  
 
The Dorothy area exhibits a number of geologic features comparable to both the Lorraine and 
Rhonda areas, but has poor rock exposure and has not seen extensive detailed exploration.  It is 
apparent that northeast trending mineralizing systems likely occur in this area but have not been 
recognized or explored.  Further geological work is required to further define targets in this 
very prospective area. 
 
The 2006 exploration program was designed to improve geological information in key target 
areas and fill in at reconnaissance levels where little or no data existed.  The program was very 
successful in improving the understanding about the mineralizing systems in various parts of 
the property and in extending several known mineralized zones at the Lorraine, Bishop, Misty 
and Slide areas.  Greater understanding of the relationships between intrusive phases, alteration 
and mineralization gained in this program will aid future exploration in focusing on key 
identifiers to mineralizing systems on the property.  The project certainly met its objectives and 
increased the potential for the discovery of mineralization in several areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The authors have outlined an exploration program to further assess the exploration potential of 
the Jajay-Lorraine/JMT properties. While the authors have recommended the program outlined 
below based on information from all available sources including Teck Cominco's 2006 reports, 
the actual exploration programs and strategies will be designed and implemented by Teck 
Cominco Limited personel under the rights of the Option Agreements. While some of the 
recommendations described below may be implemented, there is no certainty or requirement 
that Teck Cominco Limited will indeed implement any of these recommendations. Similarly, 
Teck Cominco Limited is not bound by the budget presented below and will define its own 
budget and make expenditures at its own discretion.  Neither the authors nor Eastfield or 
Lysander have any control over the design and implementation of the exploration programs to 
be considered by Teck Cominco Limited. 
 

Objectives: 
 
The 2007 exploration program is designed to: 

• Expand the known mineralized zones at the Lorraine deposits by step-out drilling. 

• Further define exploration targets surrounding the Lorraine deposits and drill test 
priority targets, including the AAD and Ekland Ridge areas. 

• Expand the known mineralized zones at the Misty in particular the higher grade Misty 
Zone, and Slide-Boundary targets by drilling. 

• Expand the economic potential of the Rhonda, West Rhonda,  and Dorothy targets with 
surface exploration to develop drill targets. 

• Continue the process of evaluating several priority target areas around the property to 
locate sites warranting detailed exploration. 

 
2007 Exploration Program Proposal and Summary: 
 
The 2007 exploration program will develop in stages, with the field season activity being guided 
by access availability based on the timing of spring break-up and upper elevation snow melt.  An 
attempt has been made to plan work in a staged fashion such that maximum use of the summer 
season can be achieved.  
 
Similar to the 2006 program, some IP geophysical surveying should be completed, particularly in 
the AAD area. Drilling should be expanded in the next program to allow reasonable evaluation of 
several targets. Detailed geologic mapping has been largely completed in the main areas but some 
fill-in and extension should be completed.  
 

2007 Exploration Program: Budget Estimate 
 
The preliminary budget estimate given below is derived from reviewing the 2006 expenditure 
statements and applying those costs to the proposed program.  Contractor and supplier costs for 
2007 are not known, and some escalation is expected over 2006 costs.  Certain aspects of the 
program have not been costed or tendered for contractor bids and may be in error. This preliminary 
budget estimate will require further research to refine, particularly with respect to infrastructure, 
materials and contractor costs.

ICP  DIGESTION (Aqua Regia) 
 

 
 
 

Analytical Preparation/Method 
 

A 0.5 gram rock sample pulp is digested in aqua regia on a sand bath at 95
O
 C for 

3 hours, shaking every 20 – 30 minutes.  Sample is diluted and mixed on a vortex.  
The sample is then analyzed on the I.C.P. to produce a 28 multi-element package 
which includes: Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Ni, Fe, Mo, Cr. Bi, Sb, V, Sn, W, 
Sr, Y, La, Mn, Mg, Ti, Al, Ca, Na,  K and P. 

 
 
 

Quality Control 
 

Every 40 samples prepared includes 3 sample repeats, 1 in-house standard and/or 
commercial standard.

Gold Fire Assay - Lead Collection 
(A.A. or Gravimetric Finish) 

 
 

Analytical Preparation/Method 
 

1. 30 grams of sample is homogenized and weighed into a crucible and 
combined with a flux. 

 
2. The sample and flux are homogenized and silver is added as a collector. 

 

3. The crucibles are placed into a 2000
o
F furnace and are fused for 1hr. 

 
4. After fusing, they are poured into a mold to allow separation of the lead 

button from the slag. 
 
5. They are pounded to remove the slag and then placed into cupels in 

another furnace pre-heated to 1600
o
F. They remain there until all the lead 

is oxidized. 
 
6. The cupels are removed from the furnace and cooled. The remaining bead 

of silver and precious metals is removed and analysed. 
 
7. If the expected values are low, the bead is digested in acid and read on an 

AA. (lab method Au(4)). If the expected values are high, the sample is 
parted with dilute nitric acid and the remaining gold is weighed (lab 
method Au(2)). 

 

Quality Control 
    

Every 48 samples prepared include 7 sample repeats and 1 in-house and/or 
commercial standard
