1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Preamble 

In March of 2010, Cameco prepared and filed a technical report for the Cigar 
Lake project (2010 Technical Report), based on scientific and technical 
information available at that time.  Since the 2010 Technical Report, there have 
been further advancements and changes in the Cigar Lake project.   

This technical report is based on the scientific and technical information and field 
experience gained since the 2010 Technical Report.  It includes an update of the 
actions Cameco took following the 2010 Technical Report to realize opportunities 
identified at that time to progress towards production.  Some of the key highlights 
include:  

• The Cigar Lake project is on track to move from development to production 
and Cameco plans to begin commissioning in ore in mid-2013, with the first 
pounds to be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 
2013.  Cameco expects to ramp up to the full production rate by the end of 
2017.  Full annual production of 18 million pounds is expected to be achieved 
in 2018.  See Section 16.3 for more details. 

• There is a change to the production profile, with slightly lower production 
expected in the first years of the project offset by higher production in the 
later years.  Cameco expects its share of production in 2013 to be about 0.3 
million pounds.  This compares to Cameco's previous estimate of one million 
pounds.  This and other revisions to Cameco's production schedule represent 
an 8.7% decrease in Cameco's production forecast through 2016 and are as 
a result of the extended period required for remediation, a better 
understanding of the geology and lower grades in initial production panels.  
See Sections 16.3.5 and 16.3.6 for more details. 

• The economic analysis results in an estimated pre-tax net present value 
(NPV) at a discount rate of 8% to Cameco, for net cash flows as of 
January 1, 2012 of $1.4 billion for its share of Mineral Reserves.  The pre-tax 
internal rate of return (IRR), also calculated from January 1, 2012, is 
estimated to be 32.8%.  See Section 22.1 for more details. 

• There is a decrease in the estimated average cash operating costs per 
pound - from $23.14/lb in 2010 to $18.57/lb.  The reduction in the estimated 
operating costs is primarily due to the agreement to mill all Cigar Lake 
Mineral Reserves at the McClean Lake mill.  See Section 21.3 for more 
details. 

• Cameco's share of the aggregate capital cost estimate has increased by 
$192 million - from $911.7 million in 2010 to $1.1 billion.  The estimate 
includes historical costs since 2004 as well as costs going forward from 
January 1, 2012.  The increase is primarily as a result of the implementation 
of the surface freeze strategy, general cost escalation, costs to upgrade and

expand the McClean Lake mill and improvements to the mine plan.  See 
Section 21.2 for more details. 

• Cameco's share of the remaining capital and other costs to complete the 
Cigar Lake project is estimated to be $483.6 million, including $428.9 million 
of capital costs and $54.7 million of standby costs.  See Section 21.2 for 
more details. 

• Cameco received regulatory approval of the revised Cigar Lake mine plan.  
See Section 20.3 for more details. 

• Cameco completed an updated Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource 
estimate.  Cameco's share of the Mineral Reserves went from 104.7 million 
pounds in 2010 to 108.4 million pounds in 2011, due to a 4% decrease in 
tonnes of diluted ore and a 8% increase in average grades.  Cameco's 
review of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve classification based on 
recent drilling resulted in an upgrade of Probable to Proven Mineral Reserves 
in terms of total contained pounds U3O8 (53% Proven / 47% Probable in 2011 
as compared to 35% Proven / 65% Probable in 2010).  See Sections 14 and 
15 for more details. 

• Cameco completed the underground remediation plan and work is 
proceeding on all pre-inflow activities for both underground development and 
construction.  See Section 16.2 for more details. 

• Cameco increased its water management system capabilities including 
underground pumping capacities.  See Section 16.2.9 for more details.  
Cameco completed the associated environmental assessment process and 
started work on the Seru Bay project, which involves infrastructure to allow 
the release of treated water directly to Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake.  See 
Sections 20.2 and 20.4 for more details. 

• Cameco implemented both a comprehensive jet boring system (JBS) 
commissioning program as well as an operational implementation plan.  The 
JBS commissioning program is targeted at assuring an effective startup and 
on-going operations.  The operational implementation plan is focused on 
assuring that all of the key components necessary for startup are in place in 
order to assure a successful rampup and long-term sustainable operations.  
See Sections 16.3.5, 16.3.6 and 24.5, respectively, for more details. 

• Cameco established the freeze wall for Shaft No. 2, activated the freeze 
system and resumed the sinking of Shaft No. 2, which resulted in the 
breakthrough to the 480 m level in early 2012.  See Section 16.2.2 for more 
details. 

• As of December 31, 2011, Cameco completed, as part of a surface freeze 
strategy, 41 freezeholes totalling 21,053 m and commenced freezing of the 
orebody and surrounding ground.  See Sections 10.1 and 16.2.6 for more 
details.

• In 2010 and 2011, Cameco completed, as part of a Phase 1 surface drilling 
program, 58 delineation and geotechnical drillholes, for a total of 24,739 m.  
See Section 10.1 for more details.   

1.2 Introduction 

Cigar Lake is the world's second largest known high-grade uranium deposit and 
is located in northern Saskatchewan.  McArthur River, which is also majority 
owned and operated by Cameco, is the largest known high-grade uranium 
deposit.  The uranium grades of Cigar Lake's Mineral Reserves are over 100 
times the world average for uranium deposits.  Cigar Lake is owned by Cigar 
Lake joint venture partners:  

• Cameco (50.025%); 

• AREVA Resources Canada Inc. (AREVA) (37.1%); 

• Idemitsu Canada Resources Ltd. (Idemitsu) (7.875%); and  

• TEPCO Resources Inc. (TEPCO) (5.0%).   

Cameco has proven expertise in operating uranium mines and mills in 
Saskatchewan and has been the operator of Cigar Lake since January 2002.  

In December 2004, the Cigar Lake Joint Venture (CLJV) decided to proceed with 
development of the Cigar Lake mine and received a construction licence from the 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) that same month.  Construction 
began on January 1, 2005.  Development has been delayed due to two water 
inflow incidents that occurred in April and October 2006 and an additional water 
inflow incident in August 2008. 

In October 2009, Cameco successfully sealed the August 2008 inflow and the 
underground workings were dewatered in February 2010.  Safe access to the 
480 m level, the main working level of the mine, was established and later to the 
500 m level and work to inspect, assess and secure the underground 
development was completed.  The restoration of underground mine systems and 
infrastructure in preparation for resumed construction activities was completed in 
2011. 

Development of the Cigar Lake mine is expected to be complete in 2013.  
Cameco plans to begin commissioning in ore in mid-2013, with the first pounds to 
be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 2013.  The mine 
and facilities have been designed to produce product for sale at a rate of 
approximately 18 million pounds U3O8 per year when the mine reaches full 
production. 

Based on the confidence in its updated mine design and mining plan, successful 
mine remediation and construction performance (both underground and surface)

contiguous.  The Cigar Lake deposit is located in the area subject to the Mineral 
Lease, totalling 308 ha.  The right to mine this uranium deposit was acquired 
under this Mineral Lease.  The current Mineral Lease expires December 1, 2021 
with the right to renew for successive ten-year terms absent a default by 
Cameco.  

Surrounding the Cigar Lake deposit there are the 25 Mineral Claims, totalling 
92,740 ha.  A mineral claim grants the holder the right to explore for minerals 
within the claim lands and the right to apply for a mineral lease. 

The surface facilities and mine shafts for the Cigar Lake project are located on 
lands owned by the Province of Saskatchewan.  Cameco acquired the right to 
use and occupy the lands under a surface lease agreement with the Province.  
The most recent surface lease was signed to take effect in July 2011.  The term 
of this surface lease expires in May 2044.  The surface lease area has been 
increased for Cameco to implement its plans to discharge treated effluent directly 
to Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake.  In addition, the area covering the Cigar Lake 
airstrip was amalgamated into this surface lease.  The Cigar Lake surface lease 
covers a total area of 1,042 ha of Crown land. 

1.4 Location and Site Description 

The Cigar Lake mine site is located near Waterbury Lake, approximately 660 km 
north of Saskatoon.  The McClean Lake JEB mill is located 69 km northeast of 
the mine site by road. 

Access to the property is by an all-weather road and by air.  All supplies to the 
site are transported by truck year round.  Site activities are carried out throughout 
the year.

The topography and the environment are typical of the taiga forested lands 
common to the Athabasca Basin area of northern Saskatchewan.  The area is 
covered with 30 to 50 m of overburden.  The surface facilities are at an elevation 
of approximately 490 masl. 

The site is connected to the provincial electricity grid with a 138kV overhead 
power line.  There are standby generators in case of grid power interruption. 

Personnel are recruited on a preferential basis: initially from the communities of 
northern Saskatchewan, followed by the province of Saskatchewan and then 
outside to other provinces.  The development and construction work is tendered 
to a number of contractors. 

1.5 Geology and Mineralization 

The Cigar Lake deposit is located 40 km inside the margin of the eastern part of 
the Athabasca Basin.  It is an unconformity related uranium deposit and occurs at 
the unconformity contact between rock of the Athabasca Group and underlying 
lower Proterozoic Wollaston Group metasedimentary rocks, an analogous setting 
to the Key Lake, McClean Lake, Collins Bay and McArthur River deposits.  Cigar 
Lake shares many geological similarities with these deposits, including general 
structural setting, mineralogy, geochemistry, host rock association and the age of 
the mineralization. 

The Cigar Lake deposit is distinguished from other similar deposits by its size, its 
high grade, the intensity of its alteration process, and the high degree of 
associated hydrothermal clay alteration.  The Cigar Lake deposit is similar to the 
McArthur River deposit in that the sandstone overlies the basement rock and 
contains large volumes of water at significant pressure.  However, unlike 
McArthur River, this deposit is flat lying. 

The Cigar Lake deposit is approximately 1,950 m long, 20 to 100 m wide, and 
ranges up to 13.5 m thick, with an average thickness of about 5.4 m.  It occurs at 
depths ranging between 410 and 450 m below the surface. 

Three distinct styles of mineralization occur within the Cigar Lake deposit: high 
grade mineralization at the unconformity ("unconformity" mineralization) which 
includes the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; fracture controlled, vein-
like mineralization higher up in the sandstone ("perched" mineralization); and 
fracture controlled, vein-like mineralization in the basement rock mass. 

The body of high grade mineralization located at the unconformity contains the 
bulk of the total uranium metal in the deposit and currently represents the only 
economically viable style of mineralization, considering the selected mining 
method and ground conditions.  It is characterized by the occurrence of massive 
clays and high-grade uranium concentrations.

The unconformity mineralization consists primarily of three dominant rock and 
mineral facies occurring in varying proportions.  These are quartz, clay (primarily 
chlorite with lesser illite) and metallic minerals (oxides, arsenides, sulphides).  In 
the two higher grade eastern pods (Phase 1), the ore consists of approximately 
50% clay matrix, 20% quartz and 30% metallic minerals, visually estimated by 
volume.  In this area, the unconformity mineralization is overlain by a weakly 
mineralized contiguous clay cap one to five metres thick.  In the lower grade 
western lens (Phase 2), the proportion changes to approximately 20% clay, 60% 
quartz and 20% metallic minerals. 

1.6 Exploration of Cigar Lake Deposit 

The Cigar Lake uranium deposit was discovered in 1981 on lands now covered 
by ML-5521 by a regional program of diamond drill testing of geophysical 
anomalies located by airborne and ground geophysical surveys.  The deposit 
was subsequently delineated by a major surface drilling program from 1982 to 
1986, followed by several small campaigns of drilling for geotechnical and infill 
holes to 2002 when the last surface hole prior to 2007 was drilled.  An additional 
186 holes were drilled from 2007 through 2011 for various geotechnical, 
geophysical, delineation and freezing programs. 

In total, 178,255 m of diamond drilling has been completed in 406 surface holes 
to delineate the deposit.  Of the 406 surface drillholes and wedged intersections 
drilled, 215 have been drilled within the geologically interpreted deposit limits.  
Note that a total of 66 of the 215 holes drilled within the deposit limits were not 
included in the current version of the Mineral Resource model.  These excluded 
holes are from the Phase 2 delineation and Phase 1 surface freeze programs, 
where drilling is ongoing.  The other 191 holes were drilled primarily for purposes 
of exploration and geotechnical assessment. 

In addition to the surface holes, diamond drilling has been done from 
underground access locations primarily to ascertain rock mass characteristics in 
advance of development and mining, both in mineralized and waste rock.  In the 
period from 1989 to 2011, 222 underground diamond drillholes totalling 19,561 m 
were drilled.  Ten of these underground holes have intersected the deposit. 

A total of 347 freeze and temperature monitoring holes have been drilled from 
underground workings to the end of 2006, of which approximately 182 have been 
gamma surveyed.  The latter freezeholes were drilled by percussion methods so 
no core was available for assays.  Conversion coefficients were developed in 
2011 to convert radiometric probe results to e%U3O8 grades for the Cigar Lake 
deposit.  This correlation was derived using the assay and downhole radiometric 
probe data from the 2010-2011 surface delineation drill program.  This has 
allowed the 182 underground freezeholes, with only probing results available, to 
be incorporated into the database for geological interpretation of which 160 were 
sufficiently mineralized to be included in the Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve model.

1.7 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

The known mineralization at Cigar Lake is divided into two areas at mine easting 
10405: the eastern area is denoted as Phase 1 and the western area is denoted 
as Phase 2.  Delineation drilling of the deposit has been concentrated on 
Phase 1.  The 2010-2011 surface delineation drill program successfully extended 
Phase 1 mineralization onto the Phase 2 side of the project.  These additional 
Mineral Resources and Reserves are identified as Phase 2*, but have been 
estimated in precisely the same method as the Phase 1 Mineral Resources and 
Reserves.  All of the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves are within 
Phase 1/Phase 2*.  Phase 1/Phase 2* also include minor amounts of Measured, 
Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources.  Phase 2 has had less drilling and all 
resources in this area are in the Inferred Mineral Resource category.  The known 
mineralization in Phase 1/Phase 2* is generally thicker and higher grade than 
that in Phase 2. 

The Phase 1/Phase 2* Mineral Resource and Reserve estimate is based on 310 
mineralized drillholes that defined the deposit of which 140 are from surface and 
170 are from underground.  The surface drillholes intersected the deposit at a 
nominal grid spacing of 25-50 m east-west by 20-25 m north-south.  The Phase 2 
Mineral Resource estimate is based on 53 drillholes, of which 19 intersected the 
mineralization, from surface at a nominal drillhole grid spacing of 200 m east-
west by 20 m north-south.  

A summary of the Mineral Resources in the Cigar Lake deposit with an effective 
date of December 31, 2011 is shown in Table 1-1.  Alain G. Mainville, P.Geo., of 
Cameco, is the qualified person within the meaning of National Instrument 
43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) for the purpose 
of the Mineral Resource estimates.

 (8) Mineral Reserves were estimated based on the use of the jet boring mining method combined 

with bulk freezing of the orebody.  Jet boring produces an ore slurry with initial processing 
consisting of crushing and grinding underground, leaching and yellowcake production at the 
McClean Lake JEB mill.  Mining rate assumed to vary between 100 and 140 t/d and a full mill 
production rate of approximately 18 million pounds U3O8 per year. 

 (9) Mineral Reserves were estimated using a 3-dimensional block model. 
 (10) An average uranium price of US$ 61/lb U3O8 with a US$1.00 = Cdn$1.10 fixed exchange rate 

was used to estimate the Mineral Reserves. 
 (11) No known metallurgical, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, political, 

marketing or other issues are expected to materially affect the above estimate of Mineral 
Reserves. 

The updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates (December 31, 
2011) reflect changes mainly due to: 

• Re-interpretation of the mineralized envelopes of the Phase 1 area based on 
the results available at the time of the estimate from the 2010-2011 surface 
delineation drillhole program (49 new surface drillholes) including 3 drillholes 
that extended the Phase 1 mineralization into the Phase 2 area described as 
Phase 2* Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; 

• Incorporation of data for 182 historic underground freezeholes proximal to the 
rampup area that were recently updated with converted radiometric data;

• Revised mine layout and dilution assumptions; 

• Removal of sump underflow material from the Mineral Reserves; 

• Reclassification of the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; 

• Updated operating cost estimates; and 

• Metal price and exchange rate assumptions. 

Phase 2 Mineral Resources have not been re-evaluated and show no change 
compared to the 2010 Technical Report.  They are in the Inferred category.  A 
surface drill program is in-progress to delineate the western portion of Phase 2 
and the Mineral Resource model will be updated in 2012 upon completion of the 
program. 

Following up on the recommendation from the 2010 Technical Report, the 
opportunity to eliminate the sump underflow material from the Mineral Reserves 
was assessed and changes were made to the mine design to remove this 
material from the mine without having to blend it with ore.  The operating costs 
and capital expenditures have been adjusted to accommodate this change in 
process.  In total, nearly 42,000 tonnes of material at 0% grade has been 
removed and has contributed to the overall grade increase of the Mineral 
Reserves estimate. 

1.8 Mining 

The jet boring mining system (JBS), a non-entry mining method, has been 
selected to mine the Cigar Lake deposit because of the challenges associated 
with mining the deposit including control of groundwater, weak rock formations, 
radiation protection, water inflow and relatively thin flat lying mineralization.  This 
was selected after many years of exploration and test mining activities following 
the discovery of the deposit in 1981. 

The JBS mining method consists of cutting cavities out of frozen ore, 
approximately 4.5 m in diameter, with a high pressure water jet producing 
approximately 230 t of ore for a typical 6.0 m ore thickness.   

This method is new to the uranium mining industry and was developed and 
adapted specifically for the Cigar Lake deposit.  One of the primary features of 
JBS mining is its non-entry approach, whereby personnel are not directly 
exposed to the orebody since all mining will be conducted from headings located 
in basement rock below it.  The levels of radiation exposure to workers is kept 
low and below regulatory limits through the application of non-entry mining 
methods, the containment of the ore cuttings within cuttings collection systems, 
and via the application of ground freezing.  Experience with non-entry mining of 
high grade uranium ore at Cameco's McArthur River mine has demonstrated the 
effectiveness of a non-entry mining approach to manage radiation exposures. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 11 of 188 

Underground in-situ mining tests in 1992, comparing the JBS mining method to 
other methods, proved the potential of the method and provided the basis for the 
design and construction of a prototype jet boring system.  A further series of in-
situ mining field tests were then conducted in 1999 and 2000 and demonstrated 
the ability of the JBS to perform all production procedures in a timely and 
effective manner.  Overall, the test mining programs were considered successful 
with the initial objectives achieved.  An estimated total of 767 t of mineralized 
material grading on average 17.4% U3O8 was mined during the various mining 
tests.  Although Cameco has successfully demonstrated the JBS mining method 
in trials, this method has not been proven at full production.  As Cameco ramps 
up production, there may be some technical challenges, which could affect 
Cameco's production plans. 

Mine development for construction and operation uses two basic approaches: 
drill and blast with conventional ground support and the mine development 
system (MDS).  Use of a roadheader excavator is under evaluation for those 
areas of weak ground away from the orebody. 

The MDS consists of a 5.1 m diameter full-face tunnel boring machine and the 
installation of a pre-cast concrete tunnel lining for ground support.  One of the 
key features of the MDS is that it provides continuous temporary ground support 
during excavation and almost immediate installation of permanent ground 
support after excavation.  This feature is critical for development in areas of poor 
ground conditions where there is minimal stand-up time. 

With the exception of the MDS headings, the infrastructure excavations and the 
access drifts are being developed using conventional drill and blast mining 
methods.  Geotechnical drilling and analysis of ground conditions is completed 
prior to confirming permanent infrastructure locations.   

Cameco plans its mine development to take place away from known groundwater 
sources whenever possible.  In addition, Cameco assesses all planned mine 
development for relative risk and applies extensive additional technical and 
operating controls for all higher risk development. 

In 2011, Cameco identified some spalling and cracking of the tunnel segments in 
a short section of one of the crosscuts that was excavated in 1999.  Cameco has 
taken steps to halt the deterioration and has reinforced the affected area.  
Cameco has retained two geotechnical consultants to provide advice on the need 
for any possible further tunnel reinforcement.  Based on the recommendations of 
these consultants, some minor revisions may be required to modify the life-of-
mine plan or segment design to ensure that the portion of the Mineral Reserves 
to be mined from this tunnel section are not negatively impacted, and that similar 
conditions will not arise elsewhere. 

The main access to the mine is via Shaft No. 1, a 4.9 m diameter circular, 
concrete lined shaft which extends to a depth of 500 m and provides direct 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 12 of 188 

access to the working level on the 480 m level.  The level number is the 
approximate depth of that level below surface in metres.  Shaft No. 2 is a 6.1 m 
diameter circular, lined shaft which, as of early January 2012, had been sunk to a 
depth of 480 m with an ultimate planned depth of 500 m.  This shaft is located 90 
m south of Shaft No. 1 and provides access to the 480 m level.  Shaft No. 1 will 
be used as the main access and services shaft, and as a route for delivery of 
fresh ventilation underground.  Shaft No. 2 will be divided into two compartments 
by a central airtight partition: one compartment will serve as the main path for 
exhaust air from the mine; the second compartment will be used to downcast 
additional fresh ventilation air as well as provide secondary egress and a number 
of additional services.  The primary ventilation system has been designed to 
supply a volume of up to 240 m3/s of fresh air to the mine. 

There are two main levels in the mine: the 480 and 500 m levels.  Both levels are 
located in the basement rocks below the unconformity.  Mining will be conducted 
from the 480 m level, which is located about 25 m below the ore zone.  The main 
underground processing and infrastructure facilities are also located on this level. 
The 500 m level is accessed via a ramp from the 480 m level.  The 500 m level 
provides for the main ventilation exhaust drift for the mine, the mine dewatering 
sump and additional processing facilities.  Construction of these facilities is in 
progress. 

Cameco plans to bulk freeze the ore zone and the surrounding ground prior to 
the commencement of mining in a given area.  To accomplish this, Cameco 
plans to use a hybrid freezing strategy.  Cameco will use surface freezing to 
support the rampup period and underground freezing for the longer-term 
development of the mine.  This system freezes the deposit and underlying 
basement rock to between minus 10 oC and 20 oC in one to three years. 

Freezing the ore zone and the surrounding ground in the area to be mined is key 
to the success of mining the deposit.  This will result in several enhancements to 
the mining conditions.  These enhancements include: (1) increasing the stability 
of the area being mined; (2) minimizing the risk of water inflows into the mine 
from the water bearing rock above the unconformity; and (3) reducing the 
radiation resulting from radon dissolved in the water. 

Based on the results of the surface freeze test program completed in 2010, 
Cameco began to implement an innovative surface freeze strategy which 
involves freezing the orebody from the surface.  The expected benefits to the 
project by implementing this strategy include: 

• reducing the risk to the construction schedule in two ways: 

(1) the surface freeze process can start before developing the 
underground tunnels; and 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 13 of 188 

(2) the construction activities underground are simplified by moving 
some of the related freezing activities and infrastructure to 
surface; and 

• contributing positively to the overall project economics.  

To the end of 2011, 41 surface freezeholes had been completed for this purpose.  
A packer will be installed at a depth of approximately 400 m in each surface hole 
designated for freezing to isolate the bottom portion of each hole.  Freezeholes 
are then hooked up to the existing freeze plant and calcium chloride brine, at a 
temperature of minus 40 °C, is circulated in the bottom portion of each 
freezehole.  Selected surface holes will be outfitted with a string of thermistors to 
monitor the progress of freezing. 

For underground freezing, the first step in freezing is to drill near-vertical 
freezeholes from the 480 m freeze level up through the orebody.  Calcium 
chloride brine at minus 40 °C is delivered underground through pipes installed in 
Shaft No. 1 from a surface refrigeration plant.  This brine is received by heat 
exchangers underground which in turn cools the brine fed to the freeze pipes 
installed in the freezeholes. 

The required mine production of 100 to 140 t/d of ore can be produced by jetting 
with two JBS mining units.  The mine equipment fleet will be comprised of four 
JBS units and other equipment for mine development, drilling and other services.  
Ore mined by the JBS will mix with the cuttings water to form a slurry, which will 
be pumped through pipes directly from the JBS to the run-of-mine (ROM) ore 
receiving facility.  From the ore receiving facility, the ore will be recovered and 
fed to an underground crushing and grinding circuit.  The ground ore slurry is 
stored to be pumped to surface by a slurry pump through a pipeline to be 
installed in Shaft No. 2.  At surface, the ore is stored, blended and partially 
dewatered for shipment in slurry form to the McClean Lake JEB mill for 
processing. 

All mining with the JBS will be done from the 480 m production level, located in 
the basement rock below the ore zone.  Following mining, each cavity will be 
backfilled with concrete.  Cameco has agreed to purchase three additional JBS 
units and is procuring additional equipment for the jet boring mining system in 
2012. 

A mine water handling strategy has been developed that includes increasing the 
mine's water-handling capabilities for future routine and potential non-routine 
inflows above the existing capability previously assessed by Cameco in its 2004 
environmental assessment.  In addition to treating all routine water inflows 
(seepage and process water) prior to releasing to the environment, water from 
any non-routine inflow will also be treated prior to releasing to the environment 
until such time as the inflow can be mitigated at the source.

As of early 2012, Cameco has increased its installed mine dewatering capacity to 
2,500 m3/h.  Mine water treatment capacity has been increased to 2,550 m3/h 
and an environmental permit to discharge routine and non-routine treated water 
to Seru Bay is in process.  As a result, Cameco believes it has pumping capacity 
of at least one and a half times the estimated maximum inflow.  See 
Sections 1.10, 16.2.9 and 20.4 for more details.  

The mine water treatment plant (WTP) has a capacity to treat and release mine 
effluent at a rate of 550 m3/h.  In the case of a mine water inflow exceeding this 
amount, a contingency water treatment system will be activated.  This system is 
comprised of a 90,000 m3 holding pond for water clarification and a 10,000 m3 
pond for surge capacity and two reagent addition buildings with capacities of 
1,000 m3/h each.  The WTP currently releases treated mine effluent into the Aline 
Creek system, and will change over to discharging into Seru Bay once the 
facilities are constructed and a licence to operate the facility has been obtained. 

As a result, Cameco believes it has sufficient pumping, water treatment and 
surface storage capacity to handle the estimated maximum inflow. 

In 2011, in connection with a regulatory requirement, Cameco retained an 
independent engineering consultant to perform a technical review of the Cigar 
Lake mine design.  The consultant found no significant exclusions or deficiencies 
in the material reviewed that would have negative impacts on the ground stability 
of the excavations or lead to an uncontrolled water inflow into the Cigar Lake 
mine.   

A number of recommendations and suggestions for follow-up were included in 
the report provided by the consultant in the areas of geological interpretation, 
hydrogeological modelling, ground freezing, geotechnical data interpretation and 
ground stability assessment.  Cameco has accepted the consultant's 
recommendations and has an action plan in place to address them in a timely 
manner. 

1.9 Processing 

Cigar Lake ore will be processed at two locations.  Size reduction will be 
conducted underground at Cigar Lake, and leaching, purification and final 
yellowcake production and packaging will occur at McClean Lake JEB mill.  The 
ore will be trucked in slurry form from Cigar Lake to the McClean Lake JEB mill in 
purpose-built containers identical to those used successfully to transport 
McArthur River ore slurry to the Key Lake mill. 

The McClean Lake JEB mill is owned by the McClean Lake joint venture (MLJV) 
and operated by AREVA.  The MLJV partners are:  

• AREVA  (70%); 

• Denison Mines Inc. (22.5%); and  



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 15 of 188 

• Ourd (Canada) Co., Ltd. (7.5%).   

The milling arrangements are subject to the terms and conditions of a toll milling 
agreement made effective January 1, 2002 between the CLJV and the MLJV 
(JEB Toll Milling Agreement).  The CLJV partners, including Cameco, signed a 
binding memorandum of agreement effective November 30, 2011 (Memorandum 
of Agreement) with the MLJV to amend the milling arrangements, which will 
provide for all of the Cigar Lake ore to be milled at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  
The JEB Toll Milling Agreement will be amended to give effect to the new milling 
arrangement.  The new toll milling arrangement is expected to result in a 
significant reduction in the operating costs of the Cigar Lake project. 

With the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement, the McClean Lake JEB mill 
is being expanded to process and package all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral 
Reserves.  Currently, the McClean Lake JEB mill has a production capacity of 12 
Mlbs U3O8 per year.  In order to process all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral 
Reserves and other ores at McClean Lake, the total production capacity at the 
McClean Lake JEB mill will be increased to 22 Mlbs U3O8 per year.  Construction 
of the expanded facility is scheduled to begin in 2012 and be completed in 2015.  
Mill operation will continue during the construction stages in order to meet the 
Cigar Lake production schedule. 

The total estimated annual production will be approximately 18 million pounds of  
U3O8 per year when the mine is in full production and the MLJV has agreed to 
dedicate the necessary mill capacity at the McClean Lake JEB mill for this 
production.  

During processing at McClean Lake JEB mill, ore tailings will be generated.  The 
residue will be treated in the upgraded McClean Lake mill tailings neutralisation 
area.  Neutralised tailings will be pumped to the existing JEB tailings 
management facility (TMF).  Subject to a capped contribution from the CLJV of 
$4.6 million, the MLJV will be responsible for all capital costs required to optimize 
the TMF to ensure that the TMF can receive and accommodate tailings from 
processing all of the current Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  This optimization 
work is expected to be completed in 2013.  The MLJV is responsible for all costs 
of decommissioning the McClean Lake JEB mill.  See Sections 20.3 and 20.5 for 
a discussion of the TMF and licensing of the TMF and Section 19.2.1 for a 
discussion of the JEB Toll Milling Agreement and the Memorandum of 
Agreement. 

1.10 Environmental Assessment and Licensing 

The Cigar Lake project has regulatory obligations to both the federal and 
provincial governments.  Classified as a nuclear facility, primary regulatory 
authority resides with the federal government and its agency, the CNSC.  The 
main regulatory agencies that issue permits / approvals and inspect the Cigar 
Lake project are: the CNSC (federal), Fisheries and Oceans Canada (federal), 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 16 of 188 

Environment Canada (federal), Transport Canada (federal), Saskatchewan 
Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety (provincial), and 
Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (provincial).  

One of the initial steps in the regulatory process was to assess the project under 
the federal and provincial environmental assessment (EA) processes. 

In 1995, the Cigar Lake project, Environmental Impact Statement (the "1995 
EIS") was submitted to the Joint Federal-Provincial review panel on Uranium 
Mining Developments in Northern Saskatchewan (the "Panel").  In 1997, the 
Panel recommended that pending identification of a suitable waste rock disposal 
location, the project should proceed.  The Canadian and Saskatchewan 
governments both accepted the Panel's recommendation and in 1998 both 
government bodies approved the project in principle.  

In January 2003, the CNSC informed Cameco that due to a perceived 
uncertainty regarding the use of the transitional provisions of Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), the CNSC would require a new 
environmental assessment of the Cigar Lake mine portion of the project to 
support construction and operating licence decisions.  

In February 2004, Cameco submitted an environmental assessment study report 
(2004 EASR) for the Cigar Lake mine portion of the project under CEAA to meet 
the above requirement.  The 2004 EASR assessed the potential effects from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Cigar Lake mine.  The 2004 
EASR did not reassess the transportation of the ore to the McClean Lake JEB 
mill; milling of the ore; or the management of tailings.  The 2004 EASR was 
accepted by the CNSC as meeting the requirements of CEAA and therefore the 
licensing/permitting processes for the Cigar Lake project could proceed. 

In 2004, Cameco applied for a licence to construct the Cigar Lake mine site in 
two parts: 

(1) construction of the Shaft No. 2 surface complex and the freeze plant; and 

(2) construction of all other mining and support facilities at the Cigar Lake 
mine site. 

In July 2004, the CNSC approved the construction of the Shaft No. 2 surface 
complex and the freeze plant and issued the construction licence in December 
2004.  In December 2007, the CNSC amended the construction licence to extend 
its term for two years from January 1, 2008 until December 31, 2009, so that 
actions resulting from the 2006 inflow event could be addressed, and mine 
remediation could proceed.  The licence was subsequently amended again in 
June 2008 to enable Cameco to proceed with certain activities associated with 
mine dewatering, mine entry, and securing/assessing the underground workings.  
In August 2008, during dewatering, a new water inflow source developed, leading 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 17 of 188 

to the decision to suspend dewatering to ensure the cause of the inflow was 
understood and that appropriate measures to mitigate the inflow could be taken. 

In 2009, after sealing the new inflow source, Cameco re-initiated dewatering of 
the main shaft.  In addition, the CNSC licence was extended to December 31, 
2013 allowing for completion of the mine construction project.  Additional 
regulatory approvals for certain licence activities, such as the mine plan and 
establishment of Shaft No. 2 as a second means of egress, were obtained in 
2011 and early January 2012, respectively, allowing for remediation and 
resumption of pre-flood underground construction and development. 

As a result of the October 2006 and August 2008 water inflow incidents, Cameco 
reviewed the emergency mine dewatering strategy.  It was determined that one 
of the safest ways to mitigate the impact of potential future mine inflows is to 
increase the mine's dewatering capacity.  Doing so requires an enhancement to 
the mine's ability to treat and release treated effluent to the environment.  
Cameco therefore re-evaluated options to address potential mine effluent 
discharge restrictions in the event of any future inflow scenarios.  Specifically the 
risk of erosion in the Aline Creek system was evaluated.  Consequently, Cameco 
applied to federal and provincial regulatory authorities to move the discharge 
point directly into Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake.  This is where the Aline Creek 
system currently enters Waterbury Lake.  This application triggered under CEAA 
a screening level environmental assessment, which was accepted in 2011 after 
which approval to proceed with construction was received.  Interim approvals and 
measures are in place to support increased environmental discharges of up to 
1,100 m3/h to the Aline Creek system if the need were to arise prior to receiving 
approval for the Seru Bay discharge point being operational.  As well, under the 
provincial operating approval, specific approvals to construct and/or operate 
relevant components of the surface infrastructure will be required. 

An amendment to the McClean Lake JEB mill's Licence to Operate is still 
required in order to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill.  No issues surrounding this licence amendment approval are 
anticipated.  AREVA has received regulatory approval to proceed with the work 
for optimization of the TMF necessary to receive all of the tailings from 
processing all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves.  This work is anticipated 
to be completed in 2013. 

Concurrent with the mine construction, which is being completed under a 
construction licence that expires at the end of 2013, an operating licence 
application will be prepared for submission to the CNSC.  Any construction 
activities that might remain would be covered by the new operating licence. 

1.11 Cigar Lake Water Inflow Incidents and Remediation 

Over the period, 2006 through 2008, the project suffered several setbacks as a 
result of three water inflow incidents. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 18 of 188 

The first occurred in April of 2006 resulting in the flooding of the then partially 
completed Shaft No. 2.  The two subsequent incidents involved inflows in the 
mine workings connected to Shaft No. 1 and resulted in flooding of the mine 
workings completed to that point in time. 

Cameco developed and successfully executed recovery and remediation plans 
for both the Shaft No. 2 inflow and the 2 inflows experienced in Shaft No. 1 
workings.  This culminated in the resumption of sinking of Shaft No. 2 in the first 
half of 2011, the successful break through to the 480 m level of the main mine 
workings in early 2012 and the commencement and completion of underground 
remediation and restoration of the Shaft No. 1 workings in 2010 and 2011. 

The detailed phased remediation plan and its associated activities were 
described in the 2007 Technical Report and updated in the 2010 Technical 
Report. 

Through 2010 and 2011, Cameco developed a comprehensive plan and 
successfully proceeded with remediation to restore the underground workings at 
Cigar Lake.  This involved inspecting the mine and completing any additional 
remedial work to protect it from an inflow or significant ground failure (for 
example, determining if additional reinforcement was required in higher risk 
areas).  The work to secure the mine was completed in 2011. 

With successful re-entry to main mine working achieved in early 2010 a 
comprehensive underground rehabilitation program was implemented through 
the period since the 2010 Technical Report.  The program involved rehabilitating 
the remaining lower risk areas of the mine (including the 480 and 500 m levels) 
and re-establishing the full mine ventilation circuit.  Some of the specific tasks 
included: 

• re-establishing the permanent refuge stations and communications; 

• installation of the emergency backup pumping capacity; 

• re-establishing the orebody freezing program; 

• commencing the Shaft No. 2 freezing program; 

• preparing areas to resume construction/development activities; and 

• replacing electrical components and equipment damaged due to flooding. 

As part of securing the mine and underground rehabilitation program, detailed 
assessments of the underground conditions were completed which provided 
further input to the overall Cigar Lake design and strategy, allowing the mine plan 
to be further optimized. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 19 of 188 

With the mine fully secured, the underground rehabilitation program complete 
and regulatory requirements met, Cameco resumed underground construction 
activities in 2011 that had been interrupted by the October 2006 water inflow. 

Cameco completed the dewatering of Shaft No. 2 in April 2009 and remediation 
was completed in May 2009.  The freezing infrastructure to support the 
completion of shaft sinking was completed in early 2011 and the freeze system 
activated.  Shaft sinking resumed in the first half of 2011 and by early 2012, 
Cameco had achieved breakthrough to the 480 m level and sinking to completion 
(the 500 m level) continues.  The breakthrough to the 480 m level provided for a 
second means of egress for the mine and for future increases in ventilation. 

In 2011, a hydrostatic liner was installed in the shaft from the 368 m depth to the 
480 m level, where it will transition back to a non-hydrostatic liner.  

Cameco plans to complete Shaft No. 2 by the second quarter of 2013, taking the 
following steps: 

• sinking the shaft from the current shaft bottom depth of 480 m to its final 
depth of 500 m – to be completed in 2012;  

• establishing a shaft station at the 480 m level; 

• installing shaft furnishings including construction of a concrete ventilation 
partition, installation of electrical cable, water services, ore slurry pipes and 
permanent service cage facilities; and  

• commissioning of the shaft systems. 

1.12 Current Status of Development 

Underground development required for the start of production is estimated to be 
70% complete, based on required infrastructure changes identified in the 
updated mine plan.  Partially completed facilities include Shaft No. 2, 
underground development and freezehole drilling.  Remaining underground work 
to be completed includes Shaft No. 2, brine system freezing infrastructure and 
ore freezing program, underground ore extraction system, ore processing circuit 
including changes due to the new mine plan, and mine development.  

A substantial number of surface facilities have been completed.  Surface 
construction is 56% complete at Cigar Lake.  The remaining important surface 
construction includes: 

• new administration/services building; 

• Seru Bay pipeline; 

• completion of the surface ore process facilities and the new propane tank 
farm; and 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

• expansion of the 138 kV electrical substation and permanent employee 
residence. 

The McClean Lake JEB mill is being expanded to process and package all of 
Cigar Lake ore.  Construction of the expanded facility is scheduled to begin in 
2012 and be completed in 2015.  Mill operation will continue during the 
construction stages in order to meet the Cigar Lake production schedule. 

1.13 Production Plan 

The mine life based on current Mineral Reserves will be approximately 15 years 
with an estimated full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8 recovered 
from the mill.  Cigar Lake will produce less than the full annual production in the 
early and late years of the planned mine life. 

The following is a general summary of the Cigar Lake production schedule based 
on current Mineral Reserves: 

• Total mill production of 213.5 million pounds U3O8, based on an overall 
milling recovery of 98.5%. 

• Total mine production of 537 thousand t of ore. 

• Average mill feed grade of 18.3% U3O8. 

• Mine operating life of approximately 15 years. 

• Commissioning in ore is planned to begin in mid-2013, with the first pounds 
to be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

• Mining rate is variable to achieve a constant production level of U3O8.  The 
average mine production varies annually from 100 to 140 t/d during peak 
production depending on the grade of ore being mined. 

• Cameco expects to ramp up to the full production rate by the end of 2017.  
Full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8 is expected to be 
achieved in 2018. 

The mine and mill production schedules for the Cigar Lake project are shown in 
Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively. 

The Cigar Lake production schedule relies upon the ground being sufficiently 
frozen prior to the start of JBS mining.  As part of the mining plan, the orebody 
has been divided into production panels, with one JBS unit operating in any 
panel.  At least four production panels need to be frozen at any point in time to 
achieve the full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8.

1.14 Economic Analysis 

The economic analysis is based on Cameco's share (50.025%) of the Mineral 
Reserves for the Cigar Lake project.  The financial projections do not contain any 
estimates relating to the potential mining and milling of Mineral Resources.  Only 
Mineral Reserves have demonstrated economic viability.  Accordingly, 
expenditures required to bring any of the Mineral Resources into production or to 
identify additional Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, have not been 
included.

The remaining capital costs, as of December 31, 2011, for the Cigar Lake project 
are estimated to be $857.3 million, including $701.4 million to complete 
underground development, underground construction and surface construction at 
Cigar Lake and $155.9 million to complete the mill modifications at McClean 
Lake.  Standby costs at the McClean Lake JEB mill are expected to be $106.6 
million, for a total remaining cost of $963.9 million for the Cigar Lake project.  The 
sustaining capital expenditures are projected to be $377.0 million that the CLJV 
will be required to fund throughout the operating life of the Cigar Lake mine.  The 
cost estimates in this paragraph are on a 100% basis. 

Cameco's share of the remaining capital and other costs to complete the Cigar 
Lake project are $483.6 million, including $428.9 million of capital cost and $54.7 
million of standby costs.  Including the $675.3 million spent by Cameco on 
construction costs and mill modification costs prior to December 31, 2011, 
Cameco's share of the aggregate capital cost is now estimated to be $1.1 billion 
($192 million over the 2010 Technical Report).  In addition, Cameco's share of 
the projected sustaining capital expenditures is $188.6 million.  

Under the terms of the JEB Toll Milling Agreement, the CLJV partners are 
responsible for the payment of standby costs to the MLJV under certain 
conditions.  AREVA shut down the McClean Lake JEB mill in July 2010, at which 
time, the CLJV began paying the standby costs.  These costs are expected to 
continue until production startup in 2013.  The total expected cost of standby 
costs to be paid by the CLJV partners is $174.6 million.  Cameco's share is  
$89.6 million, which will be expensed as incurred. 

Cameco's share of the aggregate remediation cost at Cigar Lake which was 
spent and expensed beginning in 2006 is estimated to be $86.4 million.  Cameco 
has expensed its share of the remediation costs as they  were incurred.  More 
specifically, the costs that were expensed related to contractor costs that were 
directly engaged in, or provided support to, the remediation efforts, and any 
cancellation or retention costs that were required as a result of the water inflow.  
As of December 31, 2011, remediation activities are complete. 

The CLJV's aggregate capital cost for Cigar Lake construction, including 
construction costs prior to December 31, 2011 of $1.3 billion, is estimated to be 
approximately $2.2 billion.  Total remediation costs for the CLJV are in addition to 
the capital cost and are estimated at $182.2 million.  Standby costs will add an 
additional $174.6 million to the total costs.  The combined capital and other costs 
for the Cigar Lake project are now estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion for 
the CLJV.  The cost estimates in this paragraph are on a 100% basis. 

Average operating costs over the mine life, excluding royalties, are estimated to 
average $18.57/lb U3O8 over the life of the Cigar Lake project.  The 2010 
Technical Report showed expected average operating costs of $23.14/lb U3O8 
over the life of the Cigar Lake project.  The decrease in operating costs is 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

primarily due to the agreement to mill all of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves at 
the McClean Lake JEB mill. 

The economic analysis results in an estimated pre-tax NPV (at a discount rate of 
8%) to Cameco, for net cash flows as at January 1, 2012 forward, of $1.4 billion 
for its share of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  The pre-tax IRR, also 
calculated from January 1, 2012, is estimated to be 32.8%. 

Payback for the Cigar Lake project can be considered on many different factors: 

• Payback for Cameco, excluding all 2011 and prior costs as sunk costs, would 
be achieved during 2017 on an undiscounted, pre-tax basis. 

• If the $1.6 billion, including remediation costs, spent on Cigar Lake 
construction prior to 2012, (Cameco share equal to $796 million) were 
included in the calculation, Cameco would achieve payback during 2019 on 
an undiscounted, pre-tax basis. 

1.15 Project Risks 

Cigar Lake is a challenging deposit to develop and mine.  These challenges 
include control of ground water, weak rock formations, radiation protection, water 
inflow, mining method uncertainty, relatively thin flat lying mineralization and 
other mining-related challenges.  The sandstone overlying the basement rock 
contains large volumes of water at significant pressure.  Cameco is undertaking a 
number of initiatives to mitigate the project risks associated with mining the Cigar 
Lake deposit and to mine the deposit in a safe and economic manner including, 
but not limited to, using the jet boring mining method, freezing of the orebody and 
the surrounding ground, lowering the production horizon and increasing mine 
dewatering capacity.  Cameco applies its operational experiences and the 
lessons it has learned about water inflows at McArthur River and Cigar Lake to 
reduce risk. 

Specific project risks are described in more detail in Section 24.6.  The 
construction schedule, the plan to begin commissioning of ore in mid-2013, with 
first pounds to be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 
2013 and cost estimates assume that project risks will be able to be successfully 
mitigated.  Cameco believes that this will occur. 

1.16 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The Cigar Lake project outlined in this report represents significant economic 
sources of feed material for the McClean Lake JEB mill.  With an estimated 
operating mine life of 15 years, Cigar Lake is expected to produce an estimated 
213 million pounds of U3O8.  At the forecast average realized uranium price over 
this 15 year period, it is estimated that Cameco will receive substantial positive 
net cash flows from its share of Cigar Lake production.

The economic analysis results in an estimated pre-tax NPV (at a discount rate of 
8%) to Cameco, for net cash flows January 1, 2012 forward, of $1.4 billion for its 
share of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  The pre-tax IRR, also calculated from 
January 1, 2012, is estimated to be 32.8%.  A sensitivity analysis of the Cigar 
Lake project economics demonstrates that the project generates positive cash 
flows in various scenarios, including assumptions of higher costs, lower 
revenues, or lower ore grades. 

The aggregate capital and other cost for construction spent by the CLJV, 
including costs prior to December 31, 2011 of $1.6 billion, is estimated to be 
approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $523.9 million over the cost estimate 
disclosed in the 2010 Technical Report.  The cost increase is primarily the result 
of the implementation of the surface freeze strategy, general cost escalation, cost 
to upgrade and expand the McClean Lake mill and improvements to the mine 
plan.  Despite these increases to the project cost, the economics for the project 
remain positive. 

Cameco's share of the remaining capital and other costs to complete the Cigar 
Lake project is $483.6 million, including $428.9 million of capital costs and 
$54.7 million of standby costs.  Including the $675.3 million spent by Cameco on 
construction costs and mill modification costs prior to December 31, 2011, 
Cameco's share of the aggregate capital cost is now estimated to be $1.1 billion 
($192 million over the 2010 Technical Report).  In addition, Cameco's share of 
the projected sustaining capital expenditures is $188.6 million.  

The Cigar Lake project shows relatively low sensitivity to changes in its operating 
or capital cost projections.  The relative sensitivity to changes in uranium price 
and ore grade realized is significantly higher due in part to the relatively high-
grade nature of the deposit and the price estimates being used, which are a 
reflection of the current U3O8 market environment.  

Based on its confidence in the updated mine design and mining plan, successful 
mine remediation and construction performance (both underground and surface) 
to date and a positive economic analysis, Cameco plans to continue to proceed 
through construction to production, as described in this technical report. 

The development and construction of the project has been interrupted by two 
major water inflow incidents in 2006 and one major water inflow in 2008 that 
resulted in the flooding of the partially completed Shaft No. 2 and the 
underground workings.  These incidents stopped all underground excavation and 
construction activities.  Despite these setbacks, Cameco moved forward and 
developed and successfully implemented a remediation plan to allow the 
resumption of pre-inflow activities at the mine.  Work is proceeding across all 
fronts to begin commissioning in ore in mid-2013. 

Cameco revised its mine plan building on the lessons learned through the 
successful inflow remediation, geotechnical, geological, hydrogeological

assessments, experience gained from the inspection of the underground 
workings after successful mine re-entry and learnings from other Cameco 
operations.  These changes to the mine plan include expanded ground freezing, 
the introduction of both surface and underground freezing in a hybrid approach 
and the backfilling of the 420 m level and the 465 m level, amongst many 
improvements in design and strategy.  The installed pumping capacity has been 
expanded, and expansions in water treatment and surface storage capacity 
provide for an enhanced water management system.  In addition, Cameco has 
implemented enhanced procedural controls and technical risk assessments for 
mine development and demonstrated their successful application in the 
underground development completed to date.  These and other actions are 
expected to reduce the risk of any future inflows.  Cameco is also employing a 
strategy of bulk freezing the ore zone prior to the commencement of production 
mining in a given area.   

The revised mine plan, the successfully implemented remediation program and 
the comprehensive construction and operational startup plans are anticipated to 
maintain the original objectives of the Cigar Lake project, to achieve:  

• a positive economic outcome; 

• a planned annual production rate of approximately 18 million pounds of 
U3O8; and 

• over 200 million pounds of production.   

Many aspects of the Cigar Lake project are based on the designs that have been 
proven and are being successfully used at the McArthur River mine.  One of the 
challenges of mining the Cigar Lake deposit is radiation control due to its high 
grade.  Cameco has been producing ore with similar high grades from the 
McArthur River mine since 1999.  The experience from McArthur River has been 
used extensively in the design of the Cigar Lake project.  These designs include 
remote mining for radiation protection, freezing for control of radon gas and water 
inflows, underground grinding of the ore and hydraulic hoisting to surface.  The 
incorporation at Cigar Lake of these designs and practices proven to be 
successful at the McArthur River mine significantly reduces the risk in numerous 
aspects of the Cigar Lake project. 

Cameco successfully tested and has implemented an innovative surface freeze 
strategy to further assure successful startup and production.  Cameco intends on 
using this approach to the freezing of  initial ore mining panels. 

In connection with a regulatory requirement, Cameco retained an independent 
engineering consultant to perform a technical review of the Cigar Lake mine 
design.  A number of recommendations and suggestions for follow-up were 
included in the report provided by the consultants in the areas of geological 
interpretation, hydrogeological modelling, ground freezing, geotechnical data 
interpretation and ground stability assessment. Cameco has implemented an

action plan to address such recommendations and suggestions in a timely 
manner. 

The JBS mining method is new to the uranium mining industry and was 
developed and adapted specifically for the Cigar Lake deposit.  The jet boring 
mining method planned for Cigar Lake has been successfully tested with 
prototype equipment and the mining plan has been engineered to suit this 
method.  Although Cameco has successfully demonstrated the JBS mining 
method in trials, this method has not been proven at full production.  Test mining 
trials have been completed on a limited number of cavities that may not be 
representative of the deposit as a whole.  As Cameco ramps up production, there 
may be some technical challenges, which could affect Cameco's production 
plans, including, but not limited to variable or unanticipated ground conditions, 
ground movement and cave ins, water inflows and variable dilution, recovery 
values and mining productivity.  Even though enhancements have been made to 
the design of the JBS unit, there is a risk that the rampup to full production rate 
may not be achieved on a sustained and consistent basis.   

Despite the risks associated with this new mining method, Cameco continues to 
believe that the choice of the JBS mining method is prudent and practical.  
Cameco is confident that it will be able to solve challenges that may arise, but a 
failure to do so would have a significant impact on Cameco's business.  Cameco 
has in place a comprehensive operational implementation program including an 
intensive focus on the implementation of the JBS mining system.  This includes 
the training of personnel prior to startup of operations, surface and underground 
testing, and reliability planning and implementation to assure as effective and 
efficient a startup as possible.  

Cameco is ensuring that systems, tools and personnel resources are enhanced 
and assessed for sufficiency, on a periodic basis, to assure the successful 
delivery of the project from engineering through field execution.  Cameco 
continues to seek opportunities to integrate learnings from the project and its 
other operating divisions to assure a successful project. 

Cameco plans to continue to systematically collect density samples from current 
and future core drilling programs to add samples to the current density database.  
The additional samples will be used to further improve the density estimation 
formulas for Mineral Resource estimation. 

Metallurgical test work has been used to design the McClean Lake JEB mill 
circuits relevant to Cigar Lake ore and associated modifications.  Samples used 
for metallurgical test work may not be representative of the deposit as a whole.  It 
is recommended that an ongoing sampling and metallurgical test work campaign 
be implemented to verify the consistency of recoveries at the McClean Lake JEB 
mill and to address the potential impacts of ore variability on the mill design and 
operation.

A drill program was proposed and initiated in 2011 for the western portion of the 
Phase 2 area with the goal of confirming the quantity of Mineral Resources as 
well as the potential to upgrade the category of such Mineral Resources.  
Following the completion of the current surface drill program (early-2012), 
Cameco plans to create a 3-dimensional block model for the Phase 2 area that 
will incorporate the latest geological interpretation and up-to-date structural 
information.  This model will be used to update the Mineral Resource estimate 
and provide a basis for a scoping study to assess possible development options. 

Additional drilling from surface or underground will be required to upgrade the 
Phase 1 Inferred Resources.  No surface delineation drilling over Phase 1 is 
planned at this time.  Inferred Mineral Resources have a great amount of 
uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or 
economically.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred Mineral 
Resources at Cigar Lake will ever be upgraded to a higher category. 

In order to execute the Cigar Lake project plans while mitigating risks, the 
proposed expenditures set out in Tables 21-1, 21-2 and 21-3 of this report are 
necessary and endorsed by the authors of this technical report.  

The authors of this technical report concur with, and recommend that Cameco 
proceed with, the foregoing plans.

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

The mineral property consists of one mineral lease ML-5521 (Mineral Lease or 
ML-5521) and 25 mineral claims Nos. S-106540 to 106564 inclusive (Mineral 
Claims), totalling 93,048 ha.  The Mineral Lease and Mineral Claims are 
contiguous. 

The Cigar Lake deposit is located in the area subject to the Mineral Lease, 
totalling 308 ha.  The right to mine this uranium deposit was acquired by Cameco 
under this Mineral Lease, as renewed, effective December 1, 2001 from the 
Province of Saskatchewan.  This Mineral Lease is granted by the Province of 
Saskatchewan under The Crown Minerals Act (Saskatchewan).  Under the 
Mineral Disposition Regulations, 1986 (Saskatchewan), issued under this act, the 
term of ML-5521 is for 10 years and expires on December 1, 2021, subject to a 
right to renew for successive ten-year terms absent a default by Cameco.  The 
Province of Saskatchewan may only terminate ML-5521 if Cameco breaches a 
provision of the lease or fails to satisfy any of its obligations under The Crown 
Minerals Act (Saskatchewan) or associated regulations, or in the event that any 
prescribed environmental concerns arise.   

Surrounding the Cigar Lake deposit, there are 25 Mineral Claims which were also 
granted by the Province of Saskatchewan under The Crown Minerals Act 
(Saskatchewan) totalling 92,740 ha.  These Mineral Claims grant the holder the 
right to explore for minerals within the claim lands.  A holder of a mineral claim in 
good standing has the right to convert the mineral claim into a mineral lease.  
Surface exploration work of a mineral claim requires additional government 
approval. 

There is an annual requirement of $2.3M either in work or cash to retain title to 
ML-5521 and the 25 Mineral Claims.  Based on previous work submitted and 
approved by the Province of Saskatchewan, title is secured until 2023. 

Under the Cigar Lake Joint Venture Agreement and related agreements, made 
effective January 1, 2002, the Mineral Lease and the 25 Mineral Claims noted 
above were divided into the Cigar Lake lands, consisting of ML-5521 and claim 
S-106558, and the Waterbury Lake lands, consisting of the remaining 24 claims.  
AREVA is the operator of the Waterbury Lake lands and is also contract 
exploration operator of the Cigar Lake lands other than the area on ML-5521 
from which the Mineral Reserves are to be mined.  Cameco has proven expertise 
in operating uranium mines and mills in Saskatchewan and has been the mine 
operator for the Cigar Lake lands with respect to ML-5521 since 2002. 

Figure 4-2 shows the Cigar Lake Mineral Lease and Mineral Claims as currently 
registered with the Province of Saskatchewan.

4.3 Surface Tenure 

The surface facilities and mine shafts for the Cigar Lake project are located on 
lands owned by the Province of Saskatchewan.  Cameco acquired the right to 
use and occupy these lands for the purpose of developing the Cigar Lake deposit 
under a surface lease agreement with the Province of Saskatchewan.  The most 
recent surface lease was signed to be effective in July 2011.  The term of this 
surface lease expires May 31, 2044.  The surface lease area has been increased 
for Cameco to implement its plans to discharge treated effluent directly to Seru 
Bay of Waterbury Lake.  In addition, the area covering the Cigar Lake airstrip 
was amalgamated into this surface lease.  The Cigar Lake surface lease covers 
a total area of 1,042 ha of Crown land.  It covers a portion of ML-5521 along with 
claims S-106555 to 106560, inclusive, and S-106562. 

The Province of Saskatchewan uses surface leases as a mechanism to achieve 
certain environmental protection and socio-economic objectives.  As a result, the 
Cigar Lake surface lease contains certain undertakings from the CLJV in that 
regard, including annual reporting on the status of the environment, land 
development and progress made on northern Saskatchewan employment and 
business development.  

Figure 4-3 shows the Cigar Lake general site arrangement with the outline of the 
surface lease.  

In 2011, annual rent was $164,366 for the Cigar Lake surface lease.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The property is accessible by an all-weather road and by air.  Supplies are 
transported by truck and can be shipped from anywhere in North America 
through Cameco's transit warehouse in Saskatoon.  Trucks travel north from 
Saskatoon, on a paved provincial road through Prince Albert and La Ronge and 
further north along the gravel surfaced Provincial Road 905, and finally to the 
mine site via a 52 km long, two lane gravel road.  The latter section was 
upgraded by Cameco, during the summer of 2006 and is accessible to the public 
from the intersection with Provincial Road 905 to the access gate near the Cigar 
Lake airstrip situated approximately six km from the mine site.  Figure 5-1 shows 
the regional location of the Cigar Lake site and local roads. 

An unpaved airstrip is located east of the mine site, allowing flights to the Cigar 
Lake property.

5.2 Climate 

The climate is typical of the continental sub-arctic region of northern 
Saskatchewan.  Summers are short and rather cool, even though daily 
temperatures can reach above 30 °C on occasion.  Mean daily maximum 
temperatures of the warmest months are around 20 °C and only three months on 
average have mean daily temperature of 10 °C or more.  The winters are cold 
and dry with mean daily temperature for the coldest month below minus 20 °C.  
Winter daily temperatures can reach below minus 40 °C on occasion. 

Freezing of surrounding lakes, in most years, begins in November and breakup 
occurs around the middle of May.  The average frost-free period is approximately 
90 days. 

Average annual total precipitation for the region is approximately 450 mm, of 
which 70% falls as rain, more than half occurring from June to September.  Snow 
may occur in all months but rarely falls in July or August.  The prevailing annual 
wind direction is from the west with a mean speed of 12 km/h. 

Site operations are carried out year round despite cold winter conditions.  The 
fresh air necessary to ventilate the underground working areas is heated during 
winter months using propane-fired burners. 

5.3 Physiography 

The topography and vegetation at the Cigar Lake property are typical of the taiga 
forested land common to the Athabasca Basin area of northern Saskatchewan.  
The area is covered with between 30 to 50 m of overburden.  The terrain is 
gently rolling and characterized by forested sand and dunes.  Vegetation is 
dominated by black spruce and jack pine.  Occasional small stands of white 
birches may occur in more productive and well-drained areas.  Lowlands are 
generally well drained, but also can contain some muskeg and poorly drained 
bog areas with vegetation varying from wet open non-treed vistas to variable 
density stands of primarily black spruces as well as tamaracks depending on 
moisture and soil conditions.  Productive lichen growth is common to this boreal 
landscape mostly associated with mature coniferous stands and treed bogs.   

The mine site elevation is approximately 490 masl and Waterbury Lake is 
approximately 455 masl.  The body of water known as Cigar Lake which, in part, 
overlays the deposit, is approximately 464 masl. 

5.4 Local Resources 

The closest inhabited site is Points North Landing, 56 km northeast by road from 
the Cigar Lake mine site, close to where the site access road connects to 
Provincial Road 905.  The community of Wollaston Lake is approximately 80 km 
by air east of the Cigar Lake site.  The Cigar Lake site is in close proximity to two 
other uranium/milling operations: AREVA's McClean Lake operation is 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 41 of 188 

approximately 69 km northeast by road and Cameco's Rabbit Lake operation is 
approximately 87 km east by road.  

Athabasca Basin community resident employees and contractors fly from various 
pick-up points in smaller airplanes to the mine site.  Southern resident employees 
and contractors fly to site from Saskatoon with stop-over pick-up points in Prince 
Albert and La Ronge.  The number of weekly flights varies with the size of the 
workforce.  Most company employees are on a week-in and week-off schedule.  
Contractor employees are generally on a longer work schedule. 

Personnel are recruited on a preferential basis: initially from the communities of 
northern Saskatchewan, followed by the province of Saskatchewan, and then 
outside the province. 

Site activities, such as development and construction work, are tendered to a 
number of contractors which have the ability to hire qualified personnel from the 
major mining regions across Saskatchewan and Canada. 

The Cigar Lake site is linked by road and by air to the rest of the province of 
Saskatchewan facilitating easy access to any population centre for purchasing of 
goods at competitive prices.  Saskatoon is a major population centre some 660 
km south of the Cigar Lake deposit with highway and air links to the rest of North 
America. 

5.5 Mine and Infrastructure 

The Cigar Lake site has sufficient surface rights to meet its future mining 
operation needs based on the current Mineral Reserves and to accommodate the 
necessary site facilities and infrastructure including personnel accommodation, 
access to water, airport, site roads and other necessary buildings and 
infrastructure.  

Site facilities at the end of construction will include: 

• 1,600 m long gravel airstrip and terminal; 

• permanent residence and recreation complex; 

• construction camp;  

• administration building (including maintenance and warehouse facilities); 

• water supply, treatment and distribution facilities; 

• water treatment plant, freeze plant and concrete batch plant; 

• Shaft No. 1 and Shaft No. 2 headframes and hoisthouses; 

• site roads; 

• electrical substations and powerhouse (including backup generators); 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 42 of 188 

• ore load-out facility; 

• fuel and propane supply, storage and distribution facilities; 

• miscellaneous infrastructure. 

All current Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources are contained within Mineral 
Lease ML-5521.  Underground workings are confined to a small portion of the 
area of the Mineral Lease. 

The known mineralization at Cigar Lake has been divided into two areas: the 
eastern area denoted Phase 1; and the western area denoted Phase 2.  The 
body of water known as Cigar Lake overlies part of the Phase 2 mineralization.  
The Cigar Lake mine site has access to sufficient water from nearby Waterbury 
Lake for all planned industrial and residential activities.  The site is connected to 
the provincial electricity grid with a 138-kV overhead power line.  There are 
standby generators in case of power outages. 

No tailings will be stored at the Cigar Lake site since all ore mined will be 
transported to AREVA's McClean Lake JEB mill for processing.  All ore mined 
will be transported to the McClean Lake JEB mill for processing into yellowcake.  
The processing facility at the McClean Lake site is discussed in Section 17.  The 
tailings management facility at the McClean Lake site is discussed in 
Sections 19.21 and 20.5.  

A total of 53 t of high grade mineralization from the test mining is stored on the 
surface storage pad. 

Waste rock piles from the excavation of the two shafts and all underground 
development are confined to a small footprint within the surface lease.  The 
waste piles have been segregated into four separate areas: two clean waste 
piles, one mineralized waste pile (>0.03% U3O8); and one potentially acid 
generating waste pile.  The latter two stockpiles are contained on lined pads; 
however, no mineralized waste has been identified in development to date.  
Waste rock management is further discussed in Section 20.6. 

A site plan of the existing and planned surface facilities is shown in Figure 5-2.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Ownership 

There have been numerous changes in ownership of participating interests in the 
joint venture that governs Cigar Lake. 

The original joint venture was established in 1976 between Canadian Kelvin 
Resources Ltd. and Asamera to explore the Keefe Lake area.  Asamera was the 
operator of the joint venture.  In 1977, Saskatchewan Mining Development 
Corporation (SMDC) acquired a 50% interest in the joint venture. 

Around 1979, the Keefe Lake joint venture proceeded to divide the Keefe Lake 
area into three separate project areas of Dawn Lake, McArthur River and 
Waterbury Lake (which includes a portion of the lands now known as Cigar 
Lake). 

In 1980, a joint venture agreement was entered into to govern exploration of the 
Waterbury Lake area and at that time SERU, the predecessor company to 
Cogema Canada Ltd. (Cogema), became the operator of the joint venture.   

Effective January 1, 1985, the Waterbury Lake Joint Venture Agreement was 
terminated and replaced by a new joint venture agreement.  Under the new joint 
venture agreement, the joint venture divided the Waterbury Lake area into the 
Waterbury Lake lands and the Cigar Lake lands.  Cogema was appointed 
operator of the Waterbury Lake lands and Cigar Lake Mining Corporation 
(CLMC) was appointed the operator of the Cigar Lake lands.  The participating 
interests in the joint venture at the time were SMDC (50.75%), Cogema 
(32.625%), Idemitsu (12.875%) and Corona Grande Exploration Corporation 
(3.75%). 

In 1988, Eldorado Resources Limited and SMDC merged to form Cameco. 

Effective January 1, 2002, the Cigar Lake reorganization took place and the joint 
venture owners, Cameco (50.025%), AREVA (37.1%), Idemitsu (7.875%), and 
TEPCO (5%) entered into a new joint venture agreement to give effect to the 
reorganization and to govern further exploration, development and production 
from the Waterbury Lake lands and the Cigar Lake lands.  This new joint venture 
was called the Cigar Lake Joint Venture (CLJV).  AREVA was appointed the 
Waterbury Lake lands operator (which includes claims No. S-106540 to 106557 
and 106559 to 106564).  

As part of the 2002 Cigar Lake reorganization, the CLJV entered into the Mine 
Operating Agreement with Cameco to engage Cameco as mine operator to 
operate the Cigar Lake mine property (which property includes ML–5521, the 
Cigar Lake surface lease and the mine).   



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 45 of 188 

As a part of the 2002 Cigar Lake reorganization, the CLJV entered into the 2001 
Contract Exploration Agreement to engage AREVA as contract exploration 
operator to operate the Cigar Lake Exploration property (Claim No. 106558 as 
well as the area of ML-5521 from which Mineral Reserves are not mined). 

6.2 Exploration and Development History 

Between 1976 and 1979, Asamera, as operator of the Keefe Lake Joint venture, 
conducted exploration work on the mineral property.  This activity included lake 
sediment and water geochemistry, airborne magnetic and Input (Questor) 
surveys, airborne radiometric and VLF (Geoterrex) surveys, gravimetric (Kenting) 
and seismic surveys. 

After the division of the Keefe Lake area into three separate projects, Cogema, 
as operator of the Waterbury joint venture project, revisited all field survey results 
and conducted a series of complementary exploration work on lake bottom 
sediment geochemistry and airborne high resolution magnetic (Geoterrex) 
surveys.  Regional geology photo-interpretation as well as outcrop and 
overburden mapping and sampling activities were systematically conducted 
across the mineral property.  Ground geophysical surveys allowed depth and 
conductivity evaluation of geological formations using electromagnetic frequency 
(Geoprobe EMR-16) and time (Crone DEEPEM) methods.  During 1980, this 
detailed DEEPEM work activity was intensified, targeting several Waterbury Lake 
zones with conductor structures previously identified.  These electromagnetic 
conductors were systematically drilled during the winter months of 1980-81.  On 
May 9, 1981, the drilling crew brought to surface high-grade mineralized core 
from hole WQS2-015, which was the last hole planned to be drilled for the winter 
program. 

Definition drilling programs were conducted throughout the 1980's.  To date, the 
deposit and its surroundings have been defined by 406 drillholes and more than 
178,000 m of core drilling from surface.  

A test mine proposal to assess conditions and to field test new mining methods 
was approved on October 21, 1987.  Test mining, including the sinking of Shaft 
No. 1 to a depth of 500 m and lateral development on 420, 465 and 480 m levels, 
was performed between that approval time and December 1992.  

In September 1992, Government Environmental Review Panel guidelines were 
issued for the Cigar Lake project by the Joint Federal-Provincial Panel on 
Uranium Mining Developments in Northern Saskatchewan.  Later the same year, 
consulting firms were hired to perform engineering studies and, at the same time, 
metallurgical and environmental testing programs were launched. 

In 1993, mine site activities were placed on a care and maintenance basis and 
initial engineering studies for development and operation of the property based 
on the jet boring mining method were started.  These and other engineering

studies were completed between 1993 and 1996.  Several additions and 
improvements to site infrastructure were also performed. 

In 1997, detailed engineering studies were undertaken for the purpose of 
developing a feasibility study of the mining project.  In addition, testing of a 
specially designed tunnel boring machine with capability to install a high strength 
concrete liner (or mine development system) was conducted.  In conjunction with 
this work, significant mine development was also carried out.  

Environmental review commenced in January 1996 and was completed at the 
end of 1997.  Early in 1998, the federal/provincial Joint Environment Review 
Panel issued recommendations to the federal and provincial governments and 
the CLJV that the project proceed to the next stage of licensing.  In April 1998, 
both governments responded favourably to the Joint Environment Review Panel 
recommendations. 

During 1999, the specially designed jetting tools for the jet boring machine were 
successfully tested within a three-metre diameter culvert lined raise filled with 
simulated ore. 

In 2000, activities at the mine site were focused on the testing of several tools 
and systems forming the basis of the future mining method.  The jet boring 
system was successfully tested in waste and frozen ore.  In addition, the 
following tests were conducted successfully:  

• Ore recovery from an underground slurry storage sump using a dredging 
clam bucket system; and 

• Mining cavity and casing hole surveying system. 

Further discussion of the test mining activities is provided in Section 16.1.3. 

Early in December of 2000, the mine site was again placed on a care and 
maintenance basis. 

A feasibility study was completed in May 2001, targeting peak annual production 
of 18 million pounds U3O8 during Phase 1 of the Cigar Lake project.  

In December 2004, the CLJV approved development of Cigar Lake and 
construction of the project began in January 2005.  The Cigar Lake project has 
been in the construction phase since that time.  The current status of the 
development and construction of the Cigar Lake project is discussed in 
Section 21.1.

6.4 Historical Production - Test Mining 

Historical mine production from the Cigar Lake deposit results from test mining in 
ore conducted during three separate test mining programs and comprising five 
separate mining tests as follows: 

• Boxhole boring of two cavities in 1991 

• Jet boring tests No. 1, 2 and 3 in 1992 

• Jet boring industrial tests in 2000 - 4 cavities in waste and 4 cavities in ore 

Production from the tests is estimated to be approximately 767 tonnes of 
mineralized material at an average grade of 17.4% U3O8 and containing 
approximately 295,000 lbs U3O8 as shown in Table 6-1.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Cigar Lake uranium deposit is located approximately 40 km within the 
eastern part of the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Like 
other major uranium deposits of the basin, it is located at the unconformity 
contact separating Helikian sandstones of the Athabasca Group from Aphebian 
metasedimentary gneisses and plutonic rocks of the Wollaston Domain.  The 
Manitou Falls Formation, within the Athabasca Group, was deposited in an intra-
continental sedimentary basin that was filled by fluviatile terrestrial quartz 
sandstones and conglomerates.  The Athabasca Group appears undeformed and 
its actual maximum preserved thickness is about 1,500 m.  On the eastern side 
of the basin, the sandstone units of the Manitou Falls Formation, and the 
metasedimentary gneisses that unconformably lie immediately beneath them, 
host most of the uranium mineralization.  Overburden in the project area ranges 
from none, expressed by occasional outcrops, up to a thickness of 50 m.  

The Lower Pelitic unit of the Wollaston Group, which lies directly on the Archean 
granite basement, is considered to be the most favourable unit for uranium 
mineralization.  During the Hudsonian orogeny (1800-1900 Ma), the group 
underwent polyphase deformation and upper amphibolite facies metamorphism, 
with local greenschist facies retrograde metamorphism.  The Hudsonian orogeny 
was followed by a long period of erosion and weathering and the development of 
a paleoweathering profile that is preserved beneath the unconformity. 

7.2 Local Geology 

At Cigar Lake, the Manitou Falls Formation is 250-500 m thick and corresponds 
to units MFd, MFc, MFb and MFa.  The conglomerate MFb unit hosts the Cigar 
Lake deposit as the basal conglomerate MFa is absent at the deposit, wedging 
out against an east/west, 20 m high, basement ridge, on top of which the deposit 
is located. 

Two major lithostructural domains are present in the metamorphic basement of 
the property.  These are as follows: 

• a southern area composed mainly of pelitic metasedimentary gneisses 
(Wollaston Domain), 

• a northern area with large lensoid granitic domes (Mudjatik Domain).  

These lithostructural domains are shown in Figure 7-1.

page 50 of 188 

The Cigar Lake east trending pelitic unit, which is immediately beneath the 
deposit, is located in the transitional zone between the two domains.  The 
metamorphic basement rocks in this unit consist mainly of graphitic metapelitic 
gneisses and calc-silicate gneisses, which are inferred to be part of the Lower 
Pelitic unit.  Graphite and pyrite-rich "augen gneisses", an unusual facies within 
the graphitic metapelitic gneisses, occur primarily below the Cigar Lake deposit. 

The mineralogy and geochemistry of the graphitic metapelitic gneisses suggest 
that they were originally carbonaceous shales.  The abundance of magnesium in 
the intercalated carbonate layers indicates an evaporitic origin. 

The structural framework in the Cigar Lake mine area is dominated by large 
northeast trending lineaments and wide east trending mylonitic corridors.  The 
unconformable contact between these mylonites, which contain the augen 
gneisses, and the overlying Athabasca sandstones, are considered to be the 
most favourable features for the concentration of uranium mineralization, 
specifically where graphitic basement fault zones were locally reactivated as 
brittle faults after sandstone deposition. 

The regional basement geology surrounding the Cigar Lake deposit is shown in 
Figure 7-2.

7.3 Property Geology 

The Cigar Lake uranium deposit, which has no direct surface expression, is 
located at the unconformity between the Lower Proterozoic (Aphebian) Wollaston 
Group metasediments and the Middle Proterozoic (Helikian) Athabasca 
sandstone, at a depth between 410 and 450 m below surface.  It has the shape 
of a flat-lying lens approximately 1,950 m in length, 20 to 100 m in width and 
ranges up to 13.5 m thick, with an average thickness of about 5.4 m.  It shows 
remarkable longitudinal and lateral geological continuity.  Its crescent shaped 
cross sectional outline closely reflects the topography of the unconformity. 

The deposit and host rocks consist of three principal geological and geotechnical 
elements: 

• the deposit itself;  

• the overlying sandstone; and 

• the underlying metamorphic basement rocks. 

Faulting and strong hydrothermal alteration have produced the geotechnical 
conditions that exist today to challenge the extraction of the deposit. 

The Cigar Lake deposit is controlled by an east-west trending structure 
developed within the graphitic metapelites of the Wollaston Group.  It is 
surrounded by a strong alteration halo affecting both sandstone and basement 
rocks, characterized by extensive development of Mg-Al rich clay minerals (illite-
chlorite).  This alteration halo in the sandstone is centred on the deposit and 
reaches up to 300 m in width and height.  In the basement rocks, this zone 
extends in the range of 200 m in width and as much as 100 m in depth below the 
deposit.  The mineralization is hosted principally by the Athabasca sandstone 
and consists mainly of pitchblende and nickel and cobalt arsenides. 

Figure 7-3 shows a schematic geological cross-section of the Cigar Lake deposit 
that illustrates the shape of the deposit and the alteration halo in the sandstone 
and the basement rocks.

7.4 Mineralization 

Three distinct styles of mineralization occur within the Cigar Lake deposit, as 
shown schematically in Figure 7-3.  These are as follows: 

• high grade mineralization at the unconformity ("unconformity" mineralization), 
which includes all of the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; 

• fracture controlled, vein-like mineralization higher up in the sandstone 
("perched" mineralization); and 

• fracture controlled, vein-like mineralization in the basement rock mass. 

The body of high grade mineralization located at the unconformity contains the 
bulk of the total uranium metal in the deposit and represents the only 
economically viable style of mineralization considering the selected mining 
method and ground conditions.  It is characterized by the occurrence of massive 
clays and very high-grade uranium concentrations. 

The unconformity mineralization consists primarily of three dominant rock and 
mineral facies occurring in varying proportions.  These are quartz, clay (primarily 
chlorite with lesser illite) and metallic minerals (oxides, arsenides, sulphides).  In 
the two higher grade eastern pods (Phase 1), the ore consists of approximately 
50% clay matrix, 20% quartz and 30% metallic minerals, visually estimated by 
volume.  In this area, the unconformity mineralization is overlain by a very weakly 
mineralized contiguous clay cap one to five metres thick.  In the lower grade 
western lens (Phase 2), the proportion changes to approximately 20% clay, 60% 
quartz and 20% metallic minerals. 

While pre-mineralization and post-mineralization faulting played major roles in 
creating preferential pathways for uranium bearing groundwater and to some 
extent in re-mobilizing uranium, the internal distribution of uranium within the 
unconformity mineralization has likely been controlled primarily by geochemical 
processes.  This is reflected in the good continuity and homogeneity of the 
mineralization and its geometry, particularly in the eastern part of the deposit.  A 
very sharp demarcation exists between well mineralized and weakly mineralized 
rocks, both at the upper and particularly at the lower surface of the deposit. 

Uranium oxide in the form of uraninite and pitchblende occurs in both a sooty 
form and as botryoidal, metallic masses.  It occurs as disseminated grains in 
aggregates ranging in size from millimetres to decimetres, and as massive 
metallic lenses up to a few metres thick floating in a matrix of sandstone and 
clay.  Coffinite (uranium silicate) is estimated to form less than 3% of the total 
uranium mineralization.  The mineralized rock is variably green, red and/or black 
in colour. 

Uranium grades of the unconformity mineralization range up to 82% U3O8 for a 
0.5 m interval from a single drillhole intersection within the mining area.  



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 55 of 188 

Geochemically, the deposit contains quantities of the elements Ni, Cu, Co, Pb, 
Zn, Mo and As, but in non-economic concentrations.  Higher concentrations of 
these elements are associated with massive pitchblende or massive sections of 
arseno-sulphides. 

The U-235 isotope ratio has been determined to be the naturally occurring value 
of 0.71%.  Uranium decay series measurements show that, in general, 
equilibrium exists within the unconformity mineralization and bulk dissolution of 
uranium is not occurring.  Primary age of the unconformity mineralization has 
been estimated at 1.3 billion years. 

The deposit has been subjected to faulting subsequent to its formation which has 
contributed to the formation of vein-type mineralization that has been termed 
"perched" and basement mineralization.  These mineralized bodies form 
volumetrically a very small part of the total mineralized rock and are of no 
economic significance at this time.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Cigar Lake is the world's second largest known high-grade uranium deposit.  
McArthur River, which is also majority owned and operated by Cameco is the 
largest known high-grade uranium deposit.  The uranium grades of Cigar Lake's 
Mineral Reserves are over 100 times the world average for uranium deposits. 

Cigar Lake is an unconformity related uranium deposit.  Deposits of this type are 
believed to have formed through an oxidation-reduction reaction at a contact 
where oxygenated fluids meet with reducing fluids.  The unconformity provided 
that contact.  The Cigar Lake deposit occurs at the unconformity contact between 
rock of the Athabasca Group and underlying lower Proterozoic Wollaston Group 
metasedimentary rocks, an analogous setting to the Key Lake, McClean Lake, 
Collins Bay and McArthur River deposits.  It shares many similarities with these 
deposits, including general structural setting, mineralogy, geochemistry, host 
rock association and the age of the mineralization. 

Although the Cigar Lake deposit shows many similarities with other deposits of 
the Athabasca region, it is distinguished from them by its size, the intensity of its 
alteration process, the high degree of associated hydrothermal clay alteration 
and the presence of massive, extremely rich, high grade uranium mineralization. 

The Cigar Lake deposit is similar to the McArthur River deposit in that the 
sandstone overlies the basement rocks and contains large volumes of water at 
significant pressure.  However, unlike McArthur River, this deposit is flat lying.

9 EXPLORATION 

The Cigar Lake deposit is located within ML-5521, which is surrounded by the 
25 Mineral Claims.  AREVA is responsible for all exploration activity on these 25 
Mineral Claims, as per the CLJV joint venture agreements.  The following two 
Sections (9.1 and 9.2) are a synopsis of exploration activities on the 25 Mineral 
Claims.  For the purpose of the discussion in Sections 9.1 and 9.2, the 25 
Mineral Claims are called the Waterbury Lake lands.  Section 9.3 is a summary 
discussion of geophysical programs that have been conducted by Cameco on 
behalf of the CLJV within ML-5521 since the October 2006 water inflow. 

Drilling activity within ML-5521 is described in Section 10. 

9.1 Asamera 1976 – 1979 

The current Waterbury Lake lands were initially staked by Asamera with the first 
three claim blocks staked in 1975 and a fourth in 1976 and an exploration permit 
created in 1977. 

As operator of the Keefe Lake joint venture, Asamera conducted various field 
investigations from 1976 to 1979.  The majority of Asamera's field investigations 
involved airborne and ground geophysical programs, followed by lake sediment 
and water sampling programs.  Three diamond drillholes were completed during 
the 1978 campaign, but none intersected the unconformity.  One drillhole was 
completed during the 1979 campaign, near the southern border of the property 
(Jigger Lake area). 

A list of Asamera's activities is shown in Table 9-1.

In March of 1980, SERU took over as operator of the Waterbury Lake project.  
During the years 1980 to 1986, SERU (which became Cogema Canada Ltd. in 
1984, and subsequently AREVA in 2006) completed various airborne and ground

geophysical programs, lake sediment and water sampling programs and 
substantial diamond drilling. 

Initial exploration activities by SERU were conducted in the southern region of 
the Waterbury Lake lands near Jigger Lake.  Thirteen exploration drillholes 
(totalling 5,208 m) were completed prior to the discovery hole during the first 
drilling campaign in 1981, eight of which were drilled on the Q17 grid (Jigger 
Lake).  The last drillhole (WQS2-015) completed to a depth of 563 m in 1981 was 
located on the QS-2 grid south of Cigar Lake and was the discovery hole for the 
Cigar Lake uranium deposit.  Exploration activity concentrated on deposit 
delineation over the next few years, as outlined in Section 10. 

All exploration activities ceased after the 1986 field season for a period of 
12 years until work on the Waterbury Lands recommenced in 1999.  After initially 
focussing upon data compilation and a review of all work conducted to date, new 
exploration has focussed upon developing further understanding of the Cigar 
trend, and developing knowledge of the large, unexplored parts of the project.  
Concurrent with this new work, a program of reboxing, relogging and sampling of 
historical exploration drillholes was undertaken to develop a further 
understanding of the Cigar Lake mineralization, alteration processes and 
structural setting to aid with near-mine and greenfields exploration on the project. 

Since the inception of exploration activities to the end of 2011, a total of 
134 exploration diamond drillholes (totalling 66,987 m) and an additional 38 
shallow drillholes (totalling 2,140 m) had been completed outside of ML-5521 by 
AREVA (or their predecessors) on the Waterbury Lake lands.  Since the 
recommencement of exploration in 1999, 78 drillholes for 40,415 m have been 
completed. 

Exploration drilling in 2006 confirmed the existence of unconformity style 
mineralization outside ML-5521 approximately 650 m east of Phase 1 
mineralization.  Further exploration has been conducted in this area since 2006 
and has delineated a mineralized zone approximately 210 m in strike length and 
30 m in across-strike width.  Additional follow-up drilling is planned for this area in 
2012. 

The data from the exploration program on the 25 Mineral Claims is not part of the 
database used for the estimate of the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
at Cigar Lake.  A figure displaying the location of all current exploration work 
areas outside ML-5521 is included as Figure 9-1.  A list of all work completed 
outside ML-5521 between 1980 and 2011 is included as Table 9-2.

9.3 Cameco 2007 - Present 

After the 2006 inflow events, it was recognized that more detailed geophysical 
information in the immediate deposit area was required.  The initial focus was to 
gain an understanding of the structure associated with the Shaft No. 2 inflow 
event.  Ground surveys including gravity, TITAN (DC/IP resistivity and 
magnetotelluric survey), and VLF electromagnetic surveys were conducted in the 
summer of 2007 over a portion of the Phase 1 area of the deposit. 

In the fall of 2007, a supplementary geophysical program was conducted over a 
portion of the Phase 1 area of the deposit to identify major structures within the 
sandstone column.  The survey was conducted in six boreholes to produce three 
Vertical Seismic Profiles (VSP) and six single-hole side-scan seismic surveys 
around the mine site to meet these objectives.  Both of these survey designs are 
best for optimally imaging vertical to sub-vertical structures at various scales 
based on their input frequencies. 

The application of the knowledge gained of structures and fault zones, identified 
through the correlation of all the geophysical datasets – particularly seismic – 
with geological mapping and engineering parameters has allowed for better mine 
planning and mitigation of potential risk.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Surface Drilling 

The Cigar Lake uranium deposit was discovered in 1981 by a regional program 
of diamond drill testing of geophysical anomalies (electromagnetic conductors) 
located by airborne and ground geophysical surveys, when drillhole number 
WQS2-015 was drilled.  The deposit was subsequently delineated by surface 
drilling during the period 1982 to 1986 and followed by several small campaigns 
of drilling for geotechnical and infill holes to 2007.  An additional 186 holes were 
drilled from 2007 through 2011 for various geotechnical, geophysical, delineation

Phase 1 surface drilling program, 58 delineation and geotechnical drillholes for a 
total of 24,739 m. 

Of the 406 surface drillholes and wedged intersections drilled, 215 have been 
drilled within the geologically interpreted deposit limits.  Note that a total of 66 of 
the 215 holes drilled within the deposit limits were not included in the current 
version of the Mineral Resource and Reserve model.  These excluded holes are 
from the Phase 2 delineation and Phase 1 surface freeze programs, where 
drilling is ongoing.  The other 191 holes were drilled for purposes of exploration 
and geotechnical assessment, including investigation of ground conditions in 
areas of proposed mining development and sampling for determination of 
material properties.  Seven of the 191 holes were drilled to test ground conditions 
in areas of proposed shafts. 

The locations of the drillholes in the Phase 2 and Phase 1 areas are shown in 
Figure 10-1 and Figure 10-2, respectively, except for the underground 
freezeholes. 

The higher grade, eastern part of the deposit (Phase 1 area) was discovered in 
1983.  Drilling in the eastern part of the deposit was initially done at a nominal 
drillhole grid spacing of 50 m east-west by 20 m north-south.  A surface drill 
program was conducted in 2010-2011 to tighten up the spacing in areas with 
gaps in coverage.  Drillholes in the Phase 1 portion of the mineralization consist 
of 171 holes that intersected ore grade unconformity style mineralization, 
23 holes that intersected only low grade mineralized rock or fracture controlled 
mineralization, and 121 holes intersected no mineralization.  The Phase 1 totals 
also include 41 mineralized surface freezeholes drilled in 2011.  These holes 
have not yet been incorporated into the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
model as the 41 completed holes represent a small portion of the Phase 1 area 
of the deposit and the majority of surface freezeholes remain to be drilled. 

The western part of the deposit (Phase 2 area) has been outlined by 91 holes in 
total, of which 44 holes intersected unconformity style mineralization, 18 holes 
intersected low grade or fracture controlled mineralization, and 29 holes 
intersected only weak mineralization or were barren.  The totals include 30 holes 
drilled in 2011 as part of a surface delineation program for the Phase 2 area. 

The 30 holes from the 2011 drilling program have not yet been incorporated into 
the Mineral Resource model as that drilling is ongoing and assay results are 
pending.  Preliminary results from the program are shown in Table 10-2.  The 
mineralized zones of drillhole 378 were not probed (assay results are pending) 
as a result of difficulties experienced during drilling.

The orientation and shape of the deposit was recognized at an early stage of the 
exploration drilling.  It was soon learned that the bulk of the mineralization was of 
high grade and positioned at and sub parallel to the unconformity, although vein 
like bodies of mineralized rock were also present.  Subsequently, almost all 
drilling was completed using vertical drillholes rather than inclined drillholes 
because it was recognized that vertical intersections were essentially normal to 
the dominant orientation of the deposit.  These intersections therefore represent 
the true thickness of the flat lying deposit. 

Well established drilling industry techniques were used in the drilling programs, 
including wireline core drilling.  Core recovery was generally very good; in some 
areas where ground conditions dictated, triple tube drilling to maximize core 
recovery was done.  Wedging techniques were used in some areas to obtain 
step out intersections without the expense of collaring additional holes.  A total of 
70 wedged holes have been completed.

All pre-2007 holes were surveyed for direction using single shot or multi-shot 
surveying tools.  Holes drilled since January 2007 have been surveyed either 
with a gyroscope or a Reflex tool. 

The more recent surface drillholes (since 1988) have been grouted in their 
entirety.  Holes drilled prior to 1988 were plugged in the range 250 to 350 m 
depth by mechanical plugs and/or cement plugs up to 10 m thick.  

In almost all cases, gamma surveys have been conducted through the 
mineralization in these holes.  For further discussion see Section 11.8. 

The collar locations of drillholes within the area of the surface infrastructure 
footprint have been surveyed by Cameco and their locations confirmed.

10.2 Underground Drilling  

Diamond core drilling from underground locations has been done primarily to 
ascertain rock mass characteristics in advance of development and mining, both 
in mineralized and waste rock.  In the period from 1989 to 2011, 222 
underground diamond drillholes totalling 19,561 m were drilled.  No underground 
drilling was conducted during the period 2007-2009, due to the flooding of the 
underground workings.  Ten of the holes drilled from underground intersected the 
deposit.  Pre-2001, most of the underground holes have been surveyed for 
deviation using single shot or multi-shot surveying tools.  The 133 holes drilled 
since 2001 have used a Reflex tool for hole orientation. 

Freezeholes, not included in the above totals, have been drilled into the deposit 
for the purposes of freezing the ground prior to mining.  A total of 83 holes at a 
spacing of 1.0-1.5 m were drilled in two phases of drilling in 1991 and again in 
1999.  Generally, these holes were rotary drilled holes from which no core was 
recovered, however, in a limited number of cases, core was recovered and 
sampled and, in almost all cases, gamma surveys of the holes were done 
through the deposit.  Freezehole drilling started up again in late 2004 with the 
start of the construction phase of development.  During this phase, a total of 347 
freeze and temperature monitoring holes were drilled, of which 182 have been 
gamma surveyed to estimate uranium content.  The latter freezeholes were all 
drilled by percussion methods so no core was available for assays.  The gamma 
surveys show the ore to generally conform with the projected ore outline.  A gyro 
tool was used for directional surveying in the 2004-2006 phase of freezehole 
drilling.  No underground freezeholes or temperature drillholes were completed 
from 2007 to 2011. 

The locations of the underground and surface drillholes in Phase 1 are shown in 
Figure 10-2, except for the underground freezeholes.

10.3 Comparison of Exploration and Underground Freezehole Drill Results 

The geological characteristics of the deposit evaluated during test mining were its 
location, grade and continuity.  Core and rotary drilling into the test mine area, 
both from surface and from underground, and core sampling and gamma flux 
geophysical surveys within the drillholes, confirmed the location of the deposit 
and the grades and thickness of the high grade unconformity mineralization.  
These drillholes included freezeholes that were at a close spacing of 1.0 to 1.5 m 
apart.  Throughout the test mine area, geological characteristics of the deposit 
were observed to conform within acceptable variability to those indicated by 
exploration and delineation surface drillholes spaced at 10 to 20 m along the 
fences and drilled prior to test mining. 

Conversion coefficients were developed in 2011 to convert radiometric probe 
results to e%U3O8 grades for the Cigar Lake deposit.  This correlation was 
derived using the assay and downhole radiometric probe data from the 2010-
2011 surface delineation drill program.  This has allowed the 182 underground 
freezeholes, with only probing results available, to be incorporated into the 
database for geological interpretation of which 160 were sufficiently mineralized 
to be included in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve model.  Although 
the underground freezeholes were probed under slightly different drillhole 
conditions, the estimated equivalent grades are considered representative of the 
in-situ uranium content. 

10.4 Drilling, Sampling and Recovery Factors that Could Materially Affect the 
Accuracy of the Results  

There are no known drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially 
affect the accuracy of the drill results.  For a further discussion of sampling and 
recovery factors, see Section 11.

11 SAMPLING, PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sample Density and Sampling Methods 

Drilling in the eastern part of the deposit, an area 700 m long by 150 m wide, 
labelled Phase 1, has been done at a nominal drillhole fence spacing of 25-50 m 
(east-west), with holes at 20-25 m (north-south) spacing on the fences. 

The western part of the deposit (Phase 2 area), an area 1200 m long by 100 m 
wide, was historically drilled at a nominal drillhole fence spacing of 200 m, with 
holes at 20 m spacing on the fences.  An additional 30 infill drillholes were 
completed in 2011 for select areas of the Phase 2 area, locally reducing the 
drillhole spacing down to a 15 m x 15 m pattern.  Geological, geotechnical and 
hydrological information was collected and will be assessed.  Completion of the 
current drill program on the Phase 2 area is planned for early-2012. 

Across the deposit, all surface holes were core drilled and gamma probed when 
possible.  In-hole gamma surveys and hand held scintillometer surveys were 
used to guide sampling of core for assay purposes.  After recognition of the 
significance of the deposit and its geometry, in 1982, sampling of core was 
thereafter primarily concerned with ensuring that all core within the mineralized 
zone containing at least 0.10% U3O8 was sampled and assayed.  An automess 
gamma detector was used to determine the outer limits of sampling. 

In the early stages of exploration drilling, sampling of mineralized intervals was 
done on a geological basis, whereby sample limits were determined based on 
geological differences in the character of the mineralization.  Samples were of 
various lengths, up to 50 cm.  Beginning in 1983, sampling intervals for core from 
the deposit have been fixed at the property standard 50 cm.  Subsequently, all 
sample results have been mathematically normalized to the standard interval of 
50 cm for Mineral Resource estimation purposes. 

On each of the upper and lower contacts of the mineralized zone, one additional 
50 cm sample was taken to ensure that the zone was fully sampled at the 0.10% 
U3O8 cut-off. 

Except for some of the earliest sampling, in 1981 and 1982, the entire core from 
each sample interval was taken for assay.  There were two reasons for doing 
this: 

• to reduce the variability inherent in sampling, given the high-grade nature and 
variability of the grades of the mineralization; and 

• to minimize human exposure to gamma radiation and radon gas during the 
sampling process. 

In total, more than 5,400 samples have been assayed from all the surface and 
underground holes drilled to define and delineate the deposit.

Sampling of drill core and gamma probing of underground drillholes was 
undertaken to the same standards as done for surface holes, for holes drilled into 
the deposit.  However, as discussed in Section 10.2, most of the holes drilled into 
the deposit from underground were rotary holes for ground freezing, from which 
no core was recovered.  In these holes, reliance has been placed on radiometric 
probing results for equivalent grade determinations used in the current Mineral 
Resource and Reserve model. 

Sampling was done only after all other geological logging, including photography 
of the core, was done.  Sampling was done in a separate room (laboratory) 
attached to the core shack, in order to maintain cleanliness in the laboratory area 
and to reduce radiation levels in the core logging area. 

The typical sample collection process included the following procedures: 

• Marking the sample intervals on the core boxes, at the standardized 50 cm 
sample length, by the geologist. 

• Collection of the samples in plastic bags, taking the entire core. 

• Documentation of the sample location, including assigning a sample number, 
and description of the sample, including radiometric values from a hand held 
device. 

• Bagging and sealing, with sample tags inside bags and sample numbers on 
the bags. 

• Placement of samples in steel drums for shipping. 

11.2 Core Recovery 

Reliance for grade determinations in mineralized rock has been placed primarily 
on chemical assays of drill core.  Core recovery through the ore zone has 
generally been very good.  Where necessary, uranium grade determinations 
have been supplemented by down-hole radiometric probing. 

For Mineral Resource and Reserve estimation purposes, where core recovery 
was between 75 and 100%, the assayed value was deemed to be representative 
of the whole interval.  If the core recovery was below 75%, the sample was 
replaced by length weighted probing values.  These replacement values account 
for a small portion of the overall sample database as only 159 samples were 
identified with recoveries less than 75% out of a total of 3,271 assayed samples 
for Phase 1 mineralization. 

From about 1983 onward, all drilling and sampling procedures have been 
standardized and documented.  This has imparted a high degree of confidence in 
the accuracy and reliability of results of all phases of the work.

11.3 Sample Quality and Representativeness 

Of the 406 surface holes drilled, 295 were cored with NQ size rods, 59 with HQ 
size rods, 49 with PQ size rods, and 3 with BQ size rods.  The majority of 
samples were whole core assayed, with the exception of some intersections that 
were cut with a rock saw and sealed under plexiglass for display purposes.  
Some of this core remains available for viewing at the site in a gated compound.  
The practice of sampling the entire core reduces the sample bias inherent when 
splitting core. 

Chemical assay results were systemically checked against radiometric results to 
ensure their accuracy.  Sample pulps and reject materials are retained and 
systematically catalogued.  Check assays were done on an as required basis. 

11.4 Sample Composites with Values and Estimated True Widths 

In total, more than 5,400 samples exist in the deposit database from 278 
drillholes, both from underground and surface.  Of these 278 drillholes with 
geochemical results, 140 (130 surface and 10 underground drillholes) were used 
in the estimation of Phase 1 and 19 (all surface drillholes) were used in the 
estimation of Phase 2.  In addition to these holes, 170 holes with only probing 
results available (10 surface delineation drillholes and 160 underground 
freezeholes) were also used in the estimation of Phase 1. 

For Phase 1, mineralized intervals were calculated by taking the weighted 
average for the mineralized intercept in each drillhole using a 1.0% U3O8 cut-off 
grade.  Surface drillholes are generally vertical and, as a result, their down hole 
intercepts represent the approximate true thickness of the zone since the 
mineralization is flat lying.  The greatest true width among the drillhole intercepts 
is 13.5 m, and the lowest, 0.4 m with an average true width of approximately 
5.4 m. 

The highest and lowest assay values among the samples are respectively 82.9% 
U3O8 and 0.0% U3O8.  The highest and lowest density values among the samples 
are, respectively, 8.44 g/cm3 and 1.27 g/cm3. 

The highest and lowest grades of the drillhole intercepts used in the Mineral 
Resource estimate are respectively 53.2% U3O8 and 0.0% U3O8.  The highest 
and lowest density values among the intercepts are respectively 4.69 g/cm3 and 
1.76 g/cm3. 

A histogram displaying the frequency distribution of the grades for all 1 m 
composites used in the estimation of Phase 1 is shown in Figure 11-1.

11.5 Sample Preparation by Cameco Employees  

None of the samples that were sent to testing laboratories prior to January 1, 
2002 were prepared by an employee, officer, or director of Cameco, however, 
limited assaying was carried out at Cameco's Rabbit Lake mill laboratory as 
discussed in Section 11.7.  All samples for Cigar Lake prior to this date were 
prepared by employees of AREVA or its predecessor companies or CLMC.  This 
would include all samples used in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates.  The vast majority of mineralized samples were whole core assayed to 
avoid any sample bias from splitting the core.  A discussion of the practice of 
whole core assaying is included in Section 11.1. 

From 2009 to 2011, various surface delineation holes were drilled through 
Phase 1 mineralization.  All mineralized intercepts were whole core sampled by 
Cigar Lake project personnel. 

Since January 2009, the qualified person of this section has been involved with 
providing support and guidance for sampling of mineralization.

11.6 Sample Preparation  

The majority of samples that were used for the Mineral Resource estimate were 
prepared and analysed by Loring Laboratories Ltd. (Loring), which is located in 
Calgary, Alberta. 

Sample preparation at Loring consisted of drying the sample if necessary, 
followed by primary (jaw) and secondary (cone) crush, homogenization, and 
cutting the sample using a "Jones type riffle" down to 25-300 g portions for pulp 
preparation.  The material was then pulverized in a "TM vibratory pulverizer" to 
maintain a 95% passing 150 mesh sieve.  Samples were then rolled 100 times 
on a rolling mat to ensure total homogeneity and placed in a numbered sample 
bag ready for analysis.  Any particulates created from sample preparation were 
carefully swept up from all areas and placed in a separate container for return to 
the property site along with all pulps and reject material after the sample had 
been analyzed. 

Sampling since 2002 has been conducted by Saskatchewan Research Council 
Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC), which is located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 

Sample preparation for U3O8 analysis at SRC involves jaw crushing to 60% @ 
-2 mm and splitting out a 100-200 g sub-sample using a riffler.  The sub-sample 
is pulverized to 90% @ -106 microns using a puck and ring grinding mill.  The 
pulp is then transferred to a labelled plastic snap top vial. 

11.7 Assaying 

Assaying of drill core for uranium has been performed at four different 
commercial laboratories and Cameco's Rabbit Lake laboratory in the period from 
1981 to 2011. 

As referenced in Section 11.6, Loring did all the assaying for uranium between 
1983 to 1994, and represents the majority of samples that were used for the 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate.  They were not certified by any 
standards association at that time. 

Cameco's Rabbit Lake mill laboratory has carried out limited assaying since 1994 
and SRC was used after 2001.  The Rabbit Lake laboratory was not formally 
certified at that time, however, between July 1994 and July 1997, there were 
inter-laboratory tests on uranium determination (Rabbit Lake, Key Lake, Cluff 
Lake, Rio Algom, and SRC laboratories participated).  Different analytical 
methods were used in the comparison studies.  The results from the Rabbit Lake 
laboratory were within the accepted limits.  The Rabbit Lake laboratory was 
accredited to International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 on July 28, 2006 by the 
Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories (CAEAL). 

Records indicate that SERU deemed that the assay results from two commercial 
laboratories, from drilling done in 1982, were not calibrated properly.  As a result, 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 75 of 188 

the assay results from this period were adjusted in 1983 based upon a 
systematic comparison of laboratory results and cross checks.  These adjusted 
grades applied to only 4 holes (38, 39, 39A, 40) out of 93 holes included in the 
Phase 1 Mineral Resource estimate.  Nineteen of the 23 holes affected were 
from the Phase 2 portion of the mineralization.  These holes have not been re-
assayed and are included in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates. 

Assaying by Loring was done by both the fluorimetric method and the volumetric 
method (volumetric ferrous iron reduction in phosphoric acid).  All samples 
assaying greater than 5% U3O8 as determined by fluorimetry were re-assayed 
using the volumetric method.  Chemical standards were systematically assayed 
on a regular basis to ensure the accuracy of the assaying procedure.  Senior 
staff of the operator at the time (CLMC) visited Loring on a regular basis to view 
and discuss laboratory procedures with the Loring senior staff. 

Assaying at the Rabbit Lake mill was done by the fluorimetric method for low 
grade samples, and by a combination of titration and x ray fluorescence for high 
grade samples, collected for metallurgical purposes in 1998. 

Assaying by SRC involved digesting an aliquot of pulp in a 100 ml volumetric 
flask in concentrated 3:1 HCI:HNO3, on a hot plate for approximately one hour.  
The lost volume is then made up using deionized water prior to analysis by ICP-
OES.  Instruments used in the analysis are calibrated using certified commercial 
solutions.  This method is ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited by the Standards 
Council of Canada. 

Chemical assay results were systematically checked against radiometric results 
to ensure their accuracy.  Sample pulps and reject materials are retained and 
systematically catalogued.  Check assays were done on an as required basis. 

11.8 Radiometric Surveying 

The majority of the holes were surveyed for total gamma flux by in hole probing.  
In 1982 and to the end of the winter program in 1983, the surveying was done 
with a Century Geophysics probe model 9067 using a scintillometer for detection 
of gamma rays.  This type of detector is efficient at relatively low flux rates but 
inefficient and inaccurate at high flux rates.  Beginning in the summer of 1983, 
high flux probes using Geiger Müller tubes and manufactured by Cogema in  
France, Models ST22 2T and ST22 2T FC were used.  

The usefulness of the high-flux tool lies in its ability to measure accurately the 
high gamma flux emanating from high-grade uranium mineralization without 
becoming saturated, and therefore unreliable.  The ST22 2T probe uses two ZP 
1200 Geiger  Müller tubes whereas the ST22 2T FC probe uses two ZP 1320 
tubes, which count at a rate of approximately one half that of the ZP 1200 tubes.  
The ZP-1320 tubes are therefore able to evaluate much higher grade uranium 
mineralization which would saturate the ZP-1200 tubes.

Total gamma flux measurements were collected at 10 cm intervals during 
probing. 

Prior to each survey, the probe was checked by means of a gamma source to 
confirm operation.  The Geiger Müller tubes in the probes were replaced on 
approximately an annual basis. 

For the purpose of Mineral Resource estimation, chemical assay determinations 
of uranium grade were used.  In areas of lost core or missing samples, reliance 
was placed on radiometric grade determined from the gamma probing. 

Correlation and calibration of gamma probing results with chemical assays 
showed a very good correlation, indicating that secular equilibrium exists within 
the deposit.  This also established the usefulness of gamma probing results as a 
reliable estimator of uranium grades. 

During the delineation drilling period until 1990, drillhole No. 115 was maintained 
in an open, cased and accessible state for use as a calibration hole.  On a 
regular basis, gamma probes were run in this calibration hole to confirm the 
physical stability and reliability of the probes, or to calibrate new probes 
introduced to the exploration program. 

11.9 Density Determinations 

The determination of densities at Cigar Lake has been documented by AREVA in 
Demange, 1985 and is described below.  Actual laboratory determinations were 
done for many of the original intersections during the period 1982-84.  From this 
group, a set of 146 samples were identified where the density measurement was 
deemed to be of superior quality.  These samples were then used to produce 
three estimators of density as follows: 

• as a function of the grades of uranium, nickel, cobalt, and aluminum; 

• as a function of uranium, nickel and cobalt for holes where aluminum was not 
analysed; and 

• as a function of uranium. 

The formulas have subsequently been applied in holes where radiometric grades 
were used for assay determination, and where densities were not directly 
measured. 

During 2009, 20 density samples were collected from an 8-hole surface drilling 
program and incorporated in the database.  The validity of the 1985 density 
estimation formulas was confirmed as part of a third-party review. 

Density sampling has continued through the 2010-2011 surface drillhole program 
and the density estimation formula will continue to be reviewed periodically as 
more results become available.

11.10 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) 

From 1983-1994, assaying was done by Loring.  For uranium assays up to 5% 
U3O8, twelve standards and two blanks were run with every sample batch 
(certified standards were used).  For uranium assays over 5% U3O8, a minimum 
of four standards were analyzed with each run. 

Quality control for the more recent assaying at SRC includes the preparation and 
analysis of standards, duplicates and blanks.  Standards used are BL2a, BL-3, 
BL-4a and BL-5, all from CANMET, and an in-house sample, UHU-1.  A standard 
is prepared and analyzed for each batch of samples and one out of every 40 
samples is analyzed in duplicate.  All quality control results must be within 
specified limits otherwise corrective action is taken. 

To validate the core depths, the in-hole gamma survey results were compared to 
hand-held scintillometer surveys on core. 

The QA-QC procedures that were used were typical for the time period of the 
analyses.  The qualified person for this section has reviewed the data and is of 
the opinion that the data are of adequate quality to be used for Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserve estimation purposes. 

11.11 Adequacy of Sample Preparation, Assaying, QA/QC, and Security 

The qualified person for this section is not aware of the historic security 
measures in place at the time of the deposit delineation.  However, the current 
core logging area is the same facility as was used during the delineation drilling.  
It is well removed from the mine site and a locked gate bars road access to 
anyone not authorized. 

All samples were collected and prepared under the close supervision of a 
qualified geoscientist in a restricted core processing facility. The core samples 
were collected and transferred from the core boxes to high strength plastic 
sample bags then sealed.  The sealed bags were then placed in steel drums and 
shipped under the Transport of Dangerous Goods regulations through the 
Cameco warehouse facilities at Cigar Lake directly to the laboratory. 

The qualified person for this section is satisfied with all aspects of sample 
preparation and assaying.  The sampling records are meticulously documented 
and samples were whole core assayed to reduce bias, although some ore 
intersections were sawn in half for display purposes.  The assaying was done to 
a high standard and the QA/QC procedures employed by the laboratories were 
adequate. 

The qualified person believes that the sample security was maintained 
throughout the process.  Furthermore, the continuity and high grade nature of the 
ore zone has been confirmed from radiometric probing of closely spaced 
underground freezeholes and recent surface drilling results.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

The original database, which forms part of the database used for the current 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, was compiled by previous 
operators.  Many of the original signed assay certificates are available and have 
been reviewed by Cameco geologists.  A total of 1,286 assays, representing 29% 
of the surface and underground drillhole results, were checked to confirm data 
integrity.  One error (0.07 percent of the total reviewed) was found resulting from 
conversion from the % U3O8 value to the % U value. 

Additional QA/QC measures taken on the data collected at Cigar Lake include: 

• Surveyed drillhole collar coordinates and down hole deviations were entered 
into the database and visually validated and compared to the planned 
location of the holes. 

• Using the Maptek Vulcan software package, a validation query was 
developed that checks for data entry errors such as overlapping intervals and 
out of range values. 

• Downhole radiometric probing results were compared with radioactivity 
measurements made on the core and drilling depth measurements. 

• Uranium grades based on radiometric probing were validated with sample 
assay results once available. 

A discussion of the quality assurance and quality control measures undertaken, 
relating to assay and radiometric results, is included in Sections 11.7, 11.8, 11.10 
and 11.11.  

The qualified person for this section is satisfied with the quality of the data and 
considers it valid for use in the estimation of the Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Cigar Lake Processing Metallurgical Test Work 

The design for processing ore at Cigar Lake has been largely based on the 
experience gained at McArthur River, including modifications and improvements 
incorporated since this operation was commissioned in early 2000.  The primary 
difference between the two sites is that mining at McArthur River is carried out 
using dry methods, while mining will be done wet at Cigar Lake.  As a result, 
coarse low density slurry will be pumped at Cigar Lake from the discharge of the 
mining machines to the underground ore storage facilities.  Several pump and 
pipeline testing programs were conducted between 1996 and 1999 utilizing 
simulated Cigar Lake ore at SRC's Pipeline Research Center to establish design 
criteria for this system.  The key findings from these test programs included the 
determination of minimum slurry velocities and practical pump box designs.  In 
2011, further pumping tests were done at the SRC Pipeline Research Centre to 
ensure that large, heavy particles can be transported by pipe line.  The new mine 
plan calls for ore slurry to be pumped from the 480 m level to the top of the ore 
storage (a vertical distance of approximately 14 m).  In the tests, different sizes, 
shapes and densities of particles were pumped in pipes that were sloped 
between 0 to 90 degrees.  A report of these tests has been prepared by SRC. 

In addition, wet crushing test work on simulated Cigar Lake ore was carried out in 
1998 by Cron Metallurgical Engineering Ltd. on a prototype of a reduced size 
version of a Nordberg water flush cone crusher.  Capacities exceeding 40 t/h 
were achieved on a maximum 75 mm feed to produce a product suitable for 
grinding in a ball mill. 

In 2011, test work was performed at RMD Engineering on a dewatering/sizing 
system and a rock breaker to address the handling of a small stream of coarse 
materials produced by JBS units.  The sizing system has been designed such 
that only ore greater than 50 mm will be fed to rock breaker.  The rock breaker 
will ensure oversize ore will be reduced in size to less than 50 mm prior to 
pumping to ROM storage.  Simulated Cigar Lake ore was utilized for these 
programs since the test facilities (located in Saskatoon) are not licensed to 
receive radioactive materials.  In the case of the water flush cone crusher tests, 
the feed was prepared to a target size range utilizing a mixture of clay and 
coarse rock in gravel and high compressive strength cement.  For the 1996 to 
1999 SRC test work, slurries in the 1 to 4 wt% solids range were produced using 
solids consisting of clay, selected size fractions of rock, and various sizes and 
shapes of steel pieces.  The 2011 SRC test work utilized a range of densities, 
shapes and sizes of metal pieces. 

13.2 McClean Lake Processing Metallurgical Test Work 

Extensive metallurgical test work was performed on core samples of Cigar Lake 
ore over a 7 year period from 1992 to 1999.  This work has been used to design 
the McClean Lake JEB mill circuits relevant to Cigar Lake ore and associated 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 80 of 188 

modifications.  Samples used for metallurgical test work may not be 
representative of the deposit as a whole.  Additional sampling and metallurgical 
test work will be required to verify the consistency of recoveries at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill and to address the potential impacts of ore variability on the mill 
design and operation.  This particularly applies to solids/liquids separation 
performance due to the nature of the solids characteristics upon completion of 
leaching. 

The 1992-1999 work was performed in France at AREVA's (formerly Cogema) 
SEPA test center.  The results of this test work have provided the core process 
criteria for the design of the additions and modifications required at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill for processing Cigar Lake ore.  Variability in the ore feed and its 
potential effects on the process design and operation need to be established. In 
order to achieve this, metallurgical test work should be performed on 
representative samples of past and ongoing drillhole samples. 

Based on the test results, an overall uranium recovery of 98.5% has been 
assumed. Anticipated losses are distributed as follows: 

• Leach Residue Loss: 0.5%. 

• Counter Current Decantation Soluble Loss: 0.7%. 

• Solvent Extraction Loss: 0.3%. 

This recovery is similar to that achieved at Cameco's other Saskatchewan 
operations.  For reference, historically the Key Lake mill treating McArthur River 
mine ore achieves an overall recovery of approximately 98.7% and the Rabbit 
Lake mill treating Eagle Point mine ore achieves a recovery of approximately 
97.0%.  The lower recovery at the Rabbit Lake mill is due to the lower feed grade 
from the mine to the mill as compared to the McArthur River ore feeding the Key 
Lake mill. 

For a further discussion of processing for the Cigar Lake project see Section 17 
of this Technical Report.  A high level operation flow sheet of the project ore 
processing activities is shown in Figure 17-1.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

A Mineral Resource model of the Phase 1/Phase 2* (collectively, referred to as 
Phase 1 in this Section) unconformity mineralization was created in 2011 using 
the latest drilling results and a re-interpretation of the mineralized envelopes.  
Methodologies, assumptions and parameters used to create the 2011 Mineral 
Resource model are described in this section. 

The Phase 2 Mineral Resource model remains unchanged from the 2010 
Technical Report. 

14.1 Definitions 

The Cigar Lake Mineral Resource estimates have been updated and reviewed by 
Cameco.  Peer reviews have been conducted internally as well as externally by 
Cameco's CLJV partner AREVA.  No independent verification of the current 
Mineral Resource estimate has been performed. 

The Phase 1 Mineral Resources do not include allowances for dilution and 
mining recovery.  The Phase 2 Mineral Resources include an allowance for 
dilution, as described below, but do not include allowances for mining recovery. 

The classification of Mineral Resources and their subcategories conform to the 
definitions adopted by CIM Council on November 27, 2010, which are 
incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.  Cameco reports Mineral Reserves and 
Mineral Resources separately.  The amount of reported Mineral Resources does 
not include those amounts identified as Mineral Reserves.  Mineral Resources, 
which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

14.2 Key Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 

As illustrated in Figure 14-1, the known mineralization at Cigar Lake has been 
divided into two areas (defined by the JEB Toll Milling Agreement).  The Phase 1 
area extends from grid easting 10405E to grid easting 11035E. The Phase 2 
area covers the western region between grid easting 9120E to 10405E.  The 
2010-2011 surface delineation program successfully extended Phase 1 
mineralization onto the Phase 2 side of the project.  These additional Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves are identified as Phase 2* but have been 
estimated in precisely the same method as the Phase 1 Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves.

Uranium grades at Cigar Lake are extremely variable and range from hundreds of 
ppm to more than 80% U3O8 over a standard sample width.  Grades were 
obtained from assaying drill core and checked against down-hole radiometric 
results. In areas of lost core or missing samples, reliance was placed on 
radiometric grades determined from probing.  This version of the geological 
model also incorporates the grades of the underground freezeholes since the 
conversion of radiometric measurements to equivalent uranium grade has now 
been calculated for Cigar Lake type mineralization using recent chemical assays. 

Where density was not directly measured for each sample, a correlation between 
uranium grade and density was applied (described in Section 11.9).  The density 
of the samples varies widely, from about 1.3 g/cm3 to more than 8 g/cm3, due to 
the intensity of the alteration and the variable presence of the heavy minerals 
pitchblende, cobaltite, niccolite and others.  

Geological Modelling 

Phase 1 

For Phase 1, a 3-dimensional model was created from the geological 
interpretation of mineralized domains using lithological, structural and uranium 
grade information.  The interpretation was done on 12.5 m spaced vertical cross-
sections and validated on plan views.  Two stages of domaining were used to 
subdivide the wire frame model.  The first stage divided the deposit into three 
pods: a high grade eastern pod; a high grade western pod; and a low grade 
central pod.  These three pods are similar to historic models where it was 
recognized that there are significant grade variations along the strike of the 
deposit and these boundaries will constrain the influence of the high grade 
mineralization during the grade estimation process.  The second stage of 
domaining subdivided the eastern and western pods into three parts each (as 
shown in Figure 14-2) that were based on geological constraints and grade 
continuity across strike.  The central domains are considerably higher grade and 
tend to show better grade continuity while the north and south (flank) domains 
have greater grade variability and have isolated pockets of weak (below the 1.0% 
cut-off) mineralization.  The grade and apparent continuity of the uranium 
mineralization is highest between approximately sections 10730E and 11010E. 

One metre mineralized drillhole composites were calculated within the wire frame 
models.  No additional dilution from above or below the deposit was included in 
the composites.  The cut-off grade used for defining the limits of the 
mineralization of the model is 1.0% U3O8 (minimum 1 m thick) vertically and 0.1% 
U3O8 horizontally.  Composites of the mineralized intersections from surface and 
underground diamond drillholes and underground freezeholes form the database 
for this assessment.

NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 84 of 188 

Phase 2 

For Phase 2, the 2-dimensional model is based on composites that incorporate 
an assumed minimum mineralization thickness of 2.5 m, a cut-off grade on the 
composites of 1.2% U3O8, and 0.5 m of external dilution at both the upper and 
lower limits of the ore intercept at zero grade.  The horizontal limits of the 
deposit, interpreted at cut-offs of 3.0 m%U3O8 for grade x thickness ("GT") and 
1.2% U3O8, were projected on a plan view. 

Following completion of the current surface drill program (early-2012), Cameco 
plans to create a 3-dimensional block model for the Phase 2 area that will 
incorporate the latest geological interpretation and up-to-date structural model.  
The current Phase 2 Mineral Resource estimate is based on the existing 
2-dimensional model.

Block Modelling 

Phase 1 

A 3-dimensional model of Phase 1, based on the latest drillhole data, was 
created in 2011 using the Maptek Vulcan (Version 8.0) mining software.  The 
Phase 1 area was defined by 369 drillholes (177 from surface and 192 from 
underground) of which 310 are mineralized (140 from surface and 170 from 
underground). 

Variograms of the grade distributions were calculated within each domain, within 
each pod and using a high grade cut-off.  Overall, the variograms were similar to 
historic results.  However, the variography that focused on the high grades 
specifically (values >10% U3O8), indicated the need to limit their influence to 
approximately half the distance of the main search.  Estimates of the D (density) 
and DG (density x grade) variables were obtained through using the ordinary 
kriging method for blocks of 4 m east-west x 4 m north-south x 1 m vertical with 
sub-blocks of 4 m x 1 m x 1 m, respectively.  The block size is representative of 
the mining selectivity that will be achieved with the planned JBS cavity size. The 
estimated grade of each block was obtained by dividing DG by D. 

Block models were validated using various estimation methods and multiple runs 
using different search parameters.  The final model used a three stage estimation 
procedure with variable search box dimensions for each 3-dimensional wire 
frame.  The three stage/search approach allowed the grade estimates of the 
blocks proximal to the drillholes to better mimic the composite grades of those 
holes before running the main search.  For the central domains, the first search 
estimates blocks close to the drillholes using all grade values, the second search 
uses only grades between 0 and 10% U3O8 with a slightly expanded search to 
better represent the areas of low to moderate grade and the third search is the 
main block estimation search.  For the flank domains: the first search estimates 
blocks close to the drillholes using values below 1% U3O8 to better represent the 
isolated zones below cut-off grade within the domains; the second search is the 
main block estimation search; and the third search estimates any remaining 
blocks.  The main search distance used is 55 m east-west, 20 m north-south, and 
7 m vertical while limiting the high grade values (>10% U3O8 within the flank 
domains and >60% U3O8 within the core domains) to an influence of 22 m by 
10 m by 4 m.  Only composites within each domain were used to estimate their 
respective domains.  A summary of the 2011 search parameters compared with 
the previous parameters is shown in Table 14-1.  This procedure honours the 
influence of both the low-grade and high-grade composites and reflects the grade 
variability of the deposit.  The Phase 1 Mineral Resources do not include dilution 
or allowance for mining loss.

Phase 2 

For Phase 2, results of a 2-dimensional modelling approach are reported.  It was 
performed using the 1994 version of the SERMINE geological and geostatistical 
software package developed by AREVA.  The Phase 2 area was defined by 19 
mineralized drillholes.  As discussed above, Cameco plans to create a 
3-dimensional block model following completion of the current drilling program. 

The variable 'grade x thickness x density' (GTD) represents the metal content on 
a "per unit area" basis.  Two additional variables were estimated.  They are: 
'thickness x density' (TD), representing a tonnage per square metre, and the 
'thickness of mineralization' (T).  The estimated grade for each block was 
obtained by dividing GTD by TD. 

Variograms of the three variables GTD, TD and T were calculated.  No 
anisotropy was modelled in the plane of the mineralization.  All three variograms 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 88 of 188 

show similarities in their ranges of continuity.  Comparing all three variables, the 
variogram on GTD indicates the best continuity over distances of 20 m.  In 
SERMINE, the search distances are a function of the block size.  Given the 
drilling spacing at Phase 2, the block size was set to 40 m by 10 m.  The search 
distances for Phase 2 were 100 m by 25 m.  Ordinary kriging was used for 
interpolation within the interpreted outlines of mineralization.  In the Phase 2 
area, only blocks with an estimated grade at or above a cut-off grade of 5.9% 
U3O8 were retained as part of the Mineral Resources.  This cut-off grade was 
established in 2000 at 5% U. It has not been reviewed since then because a 
lower cut-off is unlikely to materially affect the amount of Inferred Resources for 
Phase 2. As mentioned previously, Cameco is planning to update the Phase 2 
Mineral Resource model in 2012 and the cut-off grade will be reviewed at that 
time. No limit on the grade-thickness was used.  The resulting grade estimations 
for the Phase 2 block model are shown in Figure 14-3.

14.3 Mineral Resource Classification 

The criteria for classification of the Mineral Resources are the levels of 
confidence on the geological interpretation and continuity of the uranium grade 
between sample locations, the estimation confidence and the drilling density.  
The criteria in general for each Mineral Resource confidence level are as follows: 

Measured Resources:  Detailed drillhole spacing (<25 m on average between 
drillholes along strike) supplemented by underground freezehole drilling (with 
assay or probing results) and have demonstrated both geological and grade 
continuity between drillholes (ie. no significant geological questions remain that 
could greatly alter the current interpretation). 

Indicated Resources:  Good drillhole spacing (25-50 m on average between 
drillholes along strike) supplemented by good geological continuity (ie. some 
geological questions remain that could alter the current interpretation but to a 
lesser degree) and moderate grade variability between drillhole intercepts. 

Inferred Resources:  Sparse drillhole spacing (>50 m on average between 
drillholes along strike) with poor geological continuity (ie. significant geological 
questions remain that could lead to large changes in the current interpretation) 
and a high degree of grade variability between drillhole intercepts. 

Phase 1 Area 

The distribution of Mineral Resource categories, before the application of 
modifying factors for conversion to Mineral Reserves, is shown in Figure 14-4. 

The latest 3-dimensional modeling indicated that there has been an increase in 
the confidence of the resource in many areas which is reflected by the increase 
in proportion of Measured to Indicated Resources with regards to the previous 
model.  However, uncertainties still remain in some areas in regards to the shape 
of the mineralized envelope and the continuity of the uranium grade. 

Phase 2 Area 

There is no change in the Mineral Resource estimate or classification for the 
Phase 2 area.  In the Phase 2 area, only blocks with an estimated grade at or 
above a cut-off grade of 5.9% U3O8 were retained as part of the resources.  No 
limit on the grade-thickness was used.  On the basis of assumed grade and 
thickness continuity between the widely spaced drillholes (200 m by 20 m) 
supported by observations in the more densely drilled Phase 1, the estimated 
blocks of Phase 2 were classified as Inferred Mineral Resources.

The updated 2011 Mineral Resource estimate reflects the changes mainly due to: 

• An additional 49 surface delineation drillholes in portions of the Phase 1 area 
including 3 drillholes that extended the Phase 1 mineralization into the 
Phase 2 area described as Phase 2* Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves; 

• Incorporation of data for 182 historic underground freeze drillholes proximal 
to the rampup area that were recently updated with converted radiometric 
data; 

• Re-interpretation of the mineralized envelopes of the Phase 1 area; and 

• Reclassification of the Mineral Resources. 

The Mineral Resource classification is based on the criteria laid out in 
Section 14.2.  A summary of the changes in Mineral Resources is shown in

14.4 Discussion on Factors Potentially Affecting the Mineral Resource Estimate 

Materially 

In the Phase 2 area, where there is sparse drilling density, weaker geological 
continuity, and a high degree of uranium grade variability, drilling to date is not 
sufficient to represent this part of the deposit well enough to permit the 
classification of Indicated or Measured Mineral Resources.  Current drilling in the 
Phase 2 area has potential to result in a significant increase or decrease of the 
Phase 2 Mineral Resources given the drillhole spacing and the ranges of 
influence applied during the last estimate. 

The Cigar Lake drillhole database is considered to be very reliable.  Any potential 
errors which may be present are not expected to cause any significant changes 
to the Mineral Resource model. 

As is the case for most mining projects, the extent to which the estimate of 
Mineral Resources may be affected by metallurgical, environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, political, marketing or other issues could 
vary from major gains to total losses.  There are no known issues to the author of 
this section expected to materially affect the Mineral Resource estimate.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Definitions 

The Cigar Lake Mineral Reserve estimate has been updated and reviewed by 
Cameco.  Internal peer reviews have been conducted.  No independent 
verification of the current Mineral Reserve estimate was performed. 

The Mineral Reserves include allowances for dilution and mining recovery.  
Stated Mineral Reserves are derived from estimated quantities of mineralized 
material recoverable by a tested mining method.  Mineral Reserves include 
material in place and stored on surface and underground.  Only Mineral 
Reserves have demonstrated economic viability. 

The classification of Mineral Reserves and the subcategories of each conform to 
the definitions adopted by CIM Council on November 27, 2010, which are 
incorporated by reference in NI 43-101. 

15.2 Key Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 

Mineral Reserves are based upon estimated quantities of uranium recoverable 
by the jet boring mining method combined with bulk freezing of the orebody.  Jet 
boring produces an ore slurry with initial processing consisting of crushing and 
grinding underground at Cigar Lake followed by leaching and yellowcake 
production at the McClean Lake JEB mill. 

The cut-off grade used to define the Mineral Reserve is based on the incremental 
cost of mining and mill processing to produce U3O8.  Incremental mining cost was 
chosen over the full mining cost to define cut-off grade and was considered valid 
based on the following parameters: 

• The lateral (E-W) extent of the mining zone was based on ensuring that the 
total costs to develop, freeze, mine and process the mineral were covered by 
the value of the uranium in that particular production panel. 

• All remaining underground mining costs and all surface costs were 
considered as fixed, meaning that the same costs would be incurred 
regardless of production rate. 

The incremental costs include jet boring costs, backfilling, underground crushing 
and grinding, ore slurry hoisting, trucking costs from Cigar Lake to the McClean 
Lake JEB mill and the cost of processing the ore slurry to final U3O8 (yellowcake). 

A summary of economic factors used to derive the cut-off grade is shown in 
Table 15-1.

Table 15-1: Cut-off Grade Parameters 

Uranium Price US$61/lb 
Exchange Rate US$1.00 = Cdn$1.10 
Mining Dilution Variable for each cavity, based on 0.5 m of 

dilution material above and below the planned 
cavity, plus approximately 11% 

Mine Recovery 90% 
Process Recovery 98.5% 

 

The value of the ore for the purposes of calculating cut-off grade represents the 
value from uranium only.  Trace metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt and 
molybdenum are considered to have no economic value. 

Based on the above factors, the calculated cut-off grade used to define the 
Mineral Reserves has been estimated at 2.0% U3O8 and has a minimum 
mineralization thickness of 1.5 m.  These parameters are applied to the Mineral 
Resource block model after estimating the diluted grade of the JBS cavity. 

The diluted JBS cavity grades were estimated with an allowance of 0.5 m of 
dilution material above and below the planned cavity, plus approximately 11% 
external dilution at 0% U3O8. Mineral Reserves have been estimated based on 
90% mining recovery. Dilution from JBS pilot holes, freeze drilling cuttings and 
concrete backfill are included as part of the 11% external dilution.  Figure 15-1 
shows the grade distribution of the JBS cavities for the Phase 1/Phase 2* portion 
of the deposit before application of the cut-off grade and minimum thickness. 

Mining rates are assumed to vary between 100 and 140 tonnes per day and a full 
mill production rate of approximately 18 million pounds of saleable U3O8 per year 
based on 98.5% mill recovery. 

An average price of US$61.00/lb U3O8 was used to estimate the Mineral 
Reserves.  The economic analysis confirms the production schedule has a 
positive cash flow over the life of the project. 

In Cameco's Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve table included in its annual 
information form for the year ended December 31, 2011 and annual 
management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2011, a 
uranium price of US$58/lb with a fixed exchange rate of US$1.00 = Cdn$1.02 
was used to estimate Mineral Reserves for each of Cameco's properties other 
than Cigar Lake.  A sensitivity study of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves has 
shown that using an uranium price of US$58/lb with a US$1.00 = Cdn$1.02 fixed 
exchange rate, instead of US$61/lb U3O8 with a US$1.00 = Cdn$1.10 fixed 
exchange rate as in this technical report, changes the estimated total pounds by 
an insignificant amount.

15.3 Mineral Reserves Estimation and Classification 

In order to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves, a viable mine layout 
and realistic allowances for recovery and dilution must be applied.  The mining 
cavity size and production criteria are listed in Section 16.3.3 and the mine layout 
is described in Sections 16.2.1, 16.2.2 and 16.2.4.  The current mining project 
has been designed to extract the Mineral Reserves in Phase 1 and an  
immediately adjacent portion described as Phase 2*.  Mineral Resources in the 
remainder of Phase 2 are in the Inferred Mineral Resource category.  Further 
drilling and mining studies are needed before these Mineral Resources can be 
better evaluated. 

The Mineral Reserves classification follows CIM definitions where economically 
mineable Measured and Indicated Resources can be converted to Proven and 
Probable Reserves, but Inferred Resources cannot be reported as Mineral 
Reserves.  The Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves are defined by applying factors for 
mining recovery, dilution and minimum mineral thickness to the Indicated and 
Measured Resources.  Mill recovery of 98.5% has been applied in the economic 
model.  Mineral Reserve classification also uses a mining confidence factor, in 
addition to resource classification, to define Proven and Probable Mineral 
Reserves. 

Mining recovery is estimated at 90% for both tonnes of ore and metal. 

Hanging wall and footwall dilution, estimated at 0.5 m each, have been included 
in the dilution estimate along with backfill dilution.  The rock cuttings from the jet 
boring casing holes will be directed to the ore stream rather than segregated as 
waste rock and will therefore also dilute the ore.  Further, dilution from 
underground freezehole drilling cuttings has been estimated and added to the 
Mineral Reserves.  This material, which will be directed into the ore stream, is 
assumed to have zero grade. 

Following up on the recommendation from the 2010 Technical Report, the 
opportunity to eliminate the sump underflow material from the Mineral Reserves 
was assessed and changes were made to the mine design to remove this 
material from the mine without having to blend it with the ore.  The operating 
costs and capital expenditures have been adjusted to accommodate this change 
in process. In total, nearly 42,000 tonnes of material at 0% grade has been 
removed and has contributed to the overall grade increase of the Mineral 
Reserves estimate. 

The Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves estimates, with an effective date of 
December 31, 2011, are presented in Table 15-2.  The mine plan for the project 
includes only the Mineral Reserves contained in Phase 1 and an immediately 
adjacent portion of Phase 2 described as Phase 2*.  Alain G. Mainville, P.Geo.,

The updated 2011 Mineral Reserve estimates reflect the changes mainly due to: 

• Additional diamond drilling into portions of the Phase 1 area (including Phase 
2*) and the addition of underground freezehole radiometric data; 

• Re-interpretation of the mineralized envelopes of the Phase 1 area; 

• Revised mine layout and dilution assumptions; 

• Removal of sump underflow material from the Mineral Reserves; 

• Reclassification of the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; 

• Updated mine operating cost estimates; and 

• Metal price and exchange rate assumptions. 

Compared to previous Mineral Reserves disclosed by Cameco, as of 
December 31, 2010, the 2011 Mineral Reserves increased from 209.3 million 
pounds to 216.7 million pounds.  The review of the Mineral Resource and 
Reserve classification resulted in an upgrade in classification from Probable to 
Proven Mineral Reserves in terms of total contained pounds U3O8 (53% 
Proven/47% Probable in 2011 as compared to 35% Proven/65% Probable in 
2010).  The classification is based on drillhole spacing, geological and grade 
continuity, estimation confidence and the anticipated ability to successfully 
recover all of the ore.  A summary of the changes in Mineral Reserves is shown 
in Table 15-3.

Compared to previous estimate of Mineral Reserves disclosed by Cameco, as of 
December 31, 2010, the Mineral Reserves saw a decrease in tonnage of 4%, an 
increase in average grade of 8% and an increase of the estimated contained 
pounds by 4%. 

15.4 Discussion on Factors Potentially Affecting the Mineral Reserves Estimate 
Materially 

As is the case for most mining projects, the extent to which the estimate of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves may be affected by metallurgical, 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, political, 
marketing or other issues could vary from major gains to total losses of Mineral 
Reserves.  None of these issues that are known to the authors of this section, 
however, are expected to materially affect the Mineral Reserves estimate 

The Cigar Lake drillhole database is considered to be very reliable.  The largest 
area of uncertainty with the Mineral Reserve estimate is associated with mining 
and relate to the jet boring mining method, which has not previously been used 
on a large production scale basis.  Values for factors such as recovery and 
dilution are unproven on a production basis at this time, although they are 
considered reasonable assumptions based upon test mine experience and the 
experience of the technical staff involved.  Similarly, mining and production costs, 
which directly impact cut off grades, are undetermined on a production basis at 
this time.  Nevertheless, it is considered that reasonable assumptions have been 
made in these areas. 

The jet boring mining method and the overall mining and freezing plans for the 
Cigar Lake project have been developed specifically to mitigate the mining 
challenges, such as the low strength of the rock formation, the groundwater and 
the high level radiation, and to mine the deposit in a safe and economic manner.  
Unexpected geological or hydrological conditions or adverse mining conditions 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

could lead to losses of Mineral Reserves.  None of these issues that are known 
to the authors of this section, however, are expected to materially affect the 
Mineral Reserves estimate, but they could delay production and increase costs. 

Over the years, Cameco and AREVA have developed expert knowledge and 
experience with the metallurgical treatment of uranium mineralization.  
Metallurgical test work has been completed on samples which may not be 
representative of the deposit as a whole.  Additional sampling and metallurgical 
test work will be required to verify the consistency of recoveries at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill and to address the potential impacts of ore variability on the mill 
design and operation.  None of these issues that are known to the authors of this 
section, however, are expected to materially affect the Mineral Reserves 
estimate

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Design Parameters 

This section describes the technical aspects of the planned underground mine, 
including geotechnical and hydrogeological parameters, test mining activities, 
selection of mining method, mine design, mine development requirements, mine 
production, backfilling and mine equipment requirements. 

16.1.1 Geotechnical Characteristics of the Deposit 

Two of the primary geotechnical challenges in constructing the mine are control 
of groundwater and ground support in areas of weak rock.  These challenges 
occur in proximity to areas of massive mineralization in the overlaying saturated 
alteration zone, and within fracture zones in the sandstone and basement. 

On the basis of the drilling and development during test mining and rock 
mechanics studies, eight geotechnically distinct zones have been identified at the 
orebody and mining elevations, the most challenging of which include the 
massive clay formation that hosts the ore, the extremely clay altered and 
fractured rock mass overlying the deposit, and the strongly altered rock mass 
that underlies the deposit.  These zones are summarized in Table 16-1. 

Table 16-1: Rock Geotechnical Classification 

Geotechnical 
Zone 

Name Rock Quality Rock Mass Classification 
MRMR(1) System 

I Sandstone – 
unaltered 

Good to excellent 60-70 

II Sandstone - altered Poor to extremely poor <30 
III Ore zone & Clay Cap Fair to poor Not determined 
IV Regolith Fair to good <40 
V Biotite Metapelite Good to excellent 41-70 
VI Meta-Arkose Fair to very good 65-70 
VII Graphitic Metapelite 

– Altered 
Extremely poor to good 5-50 

VIII Graphitic Metapelite 
– weakly altered 

Fair to good About 50 

Note: (1) MRMR – Modified Rock Mass Rating 

Geotechnical Zones I and II are found in the sandstone and lie above the 
deposit.  Zone III is the ore deposit itself.  Zones IV to VIII are all basement rocks 
and represent a large range of rock quality from Zone V "good to excellent" to 
"extremely poor to good" in Zone VII.  The majority of future mine development 
will occur directly below the orebody in geotechnical Zone VII, where rock

strength is in part very weak, varying considerably over distances as short as one 
metre.  Within the basement rocks as a whole, ground conditions generally 
deteriorate and the degree of ground support required increases with increasing 
proximity to the mineralization and to the unconformity, in both the vertical and 
horizontal directions.  Localized zones of poor ground can be encountered in the 
basement rocks away from the ore zone, and are generally associated with fault 
structures extending into the basement from the overlying sandstone.  The ore is 
classified as Geotechnical Zone III and for which the overall rock mass strength 
is highly variable, ranging from very strong (massive pitchblende) to very weak in 
some clay facies, which are subject to squeezing and creep. 

A typical section of the deposit and surrounding rocks showing the geotechnical 
classification of the various mining areas is shown in Figure 16-1.

The geotechnical model largely formed the basis of the mine plan including 
ground support guidelines, excavation methods and parameters, and freezing 
strategy.  The model, ground excavation methods and ground support guidelines 
have been refined based on the earlier mining experience at Cigar Lake.  The 
geotechnical model and mine plan was prepared with the assistance of a number 
of Canadian and international specialist geotechnical consultants through 
detailed investigations and analysis. 

16.1.2 Hydrogeology 

The deposit and sandstone are highly fractured.  Post-mineralization fracturing is 
the dominant control of hydraulic conductivity and where it transects the 
otherwise impervious claystone core of the deposit, fracturing acts as conduits 
for water, sand and soft clay.  The basement rocks are much tighter, with very 
minimal groundwater flow, although there are localized areas of poor ground 
conditions that are susceptible to higher rates. 

Hydrogeological studies were completed by a consultant in conjunction with the 
geotechnical work.  Generally, the geotechnical zone classification can be used 
to classify the hydrogeological properties.  A 3-dimensional groundwater flow 
model was constructed based on the geological model developed from the data 
collected from geotechnical work and supplemented with structural information 
from geophysical data. 

The most permeable zone occurs in the sandstones with Geotechnical Zone II 
being higher than that of Zone I.  Within the basement rock masses the hydraulic 
conductivity is entirely fracture controlled and two to three orders of magnitude 
below that of sandstone, typically due to the tightness of the fracturing and the 
clay and chlorite alteration of the fracture surface, particularly in Zone VII. 

As can be seen in Figure 16-1, Zone II lies directly on top of the unconformity in 
the areas surrounding the deposit.  The primary risk associated with this 
geometry is the potential for high and uncontrolled groundwater inflow into the 
underground workings arising from mining activities, particularly: 

• falls of ground that make connection with the overlying water bearing zones; 

• holes drilled from the basement rocks that connect with the water bearing 
zones; and 

• intersections of faults or areas of weak (highly permeable) ground connecting 
to the water bearing zones. 

Three water inflows including the October 2006 inflow on the 465 m level, and 
the August 2008 inflow on the 420 m level, which resulted in the flooding of the 
mine, resulted in a re-evaluation and revision of the mine design and practices to 
minimize water inflow risk.  The mine water management system is described in 
Section 16.2.9.

16.1.3 Test Mining Activities 

Due to the complex geotechnical nature of the orebody and host rocks, test 
mining at Cigar Lake focused on an evaluation of mining and development 
methods and procedures, and to a much lesser extent on an evaluation of the 
geological characteristics of the orebody (e.g. grade and continuity of 
mineralization).  Emphasis during test mining in ore was placed on the 
geomechanical and hydrogeological nature of the orebody with respect to 
developing a cost effective, efficient and safe method for mining of the ore.  The 
test mining objectives included groundwater control, reduction of radiation and 
radon exposure, evaluation of ground stability and determining the potential ore 
recovery. 

Underground in-situ mining tests in 1992 comparing the JBS mining method to 
other methods proved the potential of the method and provided the basis for the 
design and construction of a prototype jet boring system.  A further series of in-
situ mining field tests were then conducted in 1999 and 2000 and demonstrated 
the ability of the jet boring system to perform all production procedures in a timely 
and effective manner.  Overall, the test mining programs were considered 
successful with the initial objectives achieved.  An estimated total of 767 t of 
mineralized material grading on average 17.4% U3O8 was mined during the 
various mining tests. 

In 1997, detailed engineering studies were undertaken for the purpose of 
developing a full feasibility study of the mining project.  In addition, testing of a 
specially designed tunnel boring machine with the ability to install a reinforced 
concrete liner began.  The mine development system (MDS) was tested and 
used successfully to develop two tunnels below the orebody. 

The other major thrust of the test mining activities was the development and 
testing of two different non-entry mining methods: boxhole boring and jet boring. 

The boxhole boring and the jet boring mining methods were both successfully 
field tested at Cigar Lake during the initial test mining program.  Both methods 
were able to utilize a non-entry approach, as mining was conducted from 
headings located below the orebody.  The ore was collected at the bottom of the 
access drillholes and contained within a cuttings collection system.  Ground 
freezing stabilized the water saturated weak rock mass in which the orebody 
occurs and effectively prevented any possible inrush of ground water.  Through 
the application of non-entry mining methods, the containment of the ore cuttings 
within cuttings collection systems, and the application of ground freezing, the 
levels of radiation exposure to workers were acceptable and below regulatory 
limits.  Experience with non-entry raisebore mining of high grade uranium ore at 
Cameco's McArthur River mine has demonstrated the effectiveness of this 
mining approach to manage radiation exposures.

Boxhole Boring 

The boxhole boring test consisted of the vertical boring of two 1.5 m diameter 
holes into the ore.  The dry material was allowed to fall through an enclosed 
chute arrangement into a specialized car.  The material collected from the test 
was remotely transported to the shaft and removed to surface for storage.  
Approximately 53 t of ore with a grade of 17% U3O8 were mined with the boxhole 
boring mining method. 

A small test of an expandable reamer assembly, as part of the modified boxhole 
boring system, was tested in waste.  The access drillhole was 1.5 m diameter 
and the cavity created after deployment of the expandable reaming arm was 
2.7 m diameter. 

Jet Boring 

The jet boring method utilizes a high energy water jet which rotates and oscillates 
within a remote cavity to mine the ore.  This mining method was tested and 
refined at the Cigar Lake site in 1992, 1999 and 2000. 

In 1992, initial tests consisted of three trials and demonstrated the potential of the 
method and its numerous benefits and provided the basis for the design and 
construction of a prototype jet boring system.  Cavities approaching two metres 
in diameter were excavated in frozen ore even with the rudimentary, low powered 
system available at the time.  Considerable engineering and laboratory/shop 
testing in the following years led to the development of a jet boring system 
consisting of high pressure pumps/piping, jet borer, jetting tools and slurry circuit. 

In 1999, the Jet Boring Tools test involved the testing of a high pressure pumping 
system and engineered jetting tools in simulated ore in a culvert lined raise.  The 
tools tested included nozzle sub, blade screen, and dual wall jetting pipes, 
swivel, fibreglass casing and preventor.  The most significant results of these 
tests were the ability to excavate a cavity three meters in diameter (limited by the 
size of the culvert), the ability of the jet to mine 250 MPa material, the 
achievement of the predicted, average productivity rate of 7 to 10 t/h, and the 
ability of material to flow out of the cavity and through the preventor without 
plugging. 

In 2000, a "Waste Test" was undertaken in a culvert lined raise and involved the 
testing of the jet borer drill car, cavity survey system and improved jet string 
tools.  The tests demonstrated the ability of the jet borer drill car and controls to 
perform the jetting functions, the survivability of the cavity survey system and the 
improved performance of the jet string tools.  

Also in 2000, the Jet Boring Systems (JBS) test involved the mining of cavities in 
frozen waste and ore using the complete prototype JBS and slurry circuit.  The 
JBS, consisting of a drill car, two rod/casing cars, shuttle car and a slurry car, 
was set up in a culvert lined crosscut approximately 20 m below the ore.  The

slurry circuit tested included a slurry line from the slurry car to a cuttings storage 
sump and a recycle water line from the sump back to the slurry car.  Four cavities 
were mined in waste rock below the ore and resulted in improvements to the 
jetting tools and procedures.  Four cavities were also successfully mined in ore 
as shown in Figure 16-2. 

In addition in 2000, the following tests were conducted successfully: 

• Ore recovery from an underground slurry storage sump using a dredging 
clam bucket system, 

• Mining cavity and casing hole surveying system, and 

• Concrete cavity backfilling

Jet Boring System Test Results 

The JBS test demonstrated the ability of the entire jet boring system to perform 
all production procedures in a timely and effective manner.  Approximately 600 t 
of ore was mined in four cavities during the 2000 test.  A table showing the 
details of the ore mined in each cavity is included in Section 6.4.  The results of 
the test were: 

• The ability to excavate roughly circular cavities with an average diameter of 
more than four metres, without attempting any optimization. 

• The achievement of an average productivity rate of 7 to 10 t/h while jetting. 

• Cycle times were determined to be approximately 152 hours for the four test 
cavities mined in ore.  This factor has since been revised to 160 hours 
reflecting changes to the mining horizon and other process changes. 

• The ability of the ore to flow from the cavity, through the preventor and slurry 
car, and pumping of the ore slurry down the pipeline to the storage facility. 

• The ability to use 40 MPa concrete as backfill and its ability to withstand 
jetting from an adjacent cavity. 

• The reliability of all equipment meeting or exceeding expectations. 

Following the completion of the test mining programs, the jet boring method was 
selected over boxhole boring as the safest and most viable economic method of 
mining in the Phase 1 area of the orebody.  Overall, the test mining programs 
were considered successful with the initial objectives achieved.  An estimated 
total of 767 t of mineralized material grading on average 17.4% U3O8 was mined 
during the various mining tests. 

Although Cameco has successfully demonstrated the JBS mining method in 
trials, this method has not been proven at full production.  Test mining trials have 
been completed on a limited number of cavities that may not be representative of 
the deposit as a whole.  As Cameco ramps up production, there may be some 
technical challenges, which could affect Cameco's production plans, including, 
but not limited to variable or unanticipated ground conditions, ground movement 
and cave ins, water inflows and variable dilution, recovery values and mining 
productivity. 

16.2 Mine Design 

16.2.1 Overview 

Underground facilities and services required for the mine during operations will 
generally include: 

• two service shafts for mine access and ventilation; 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 110 of 188 

• access drifts and MDS crosscuts; 

• ground freezing infrastructure and equipment; 

• ore processing facilities; and 

• support facilities including maintenance shop, electrical substations, sumps, 
pump stations and storage areas. 

The orebody will be mined using a series of crosscuts and access drifts on the 
480 m level.  A strategy of bulk freezing the orebody has been adopted to 
minimize the risk of large water inflows, control radiation resulting from radon 
being released from flowing water, and increase the strength of the rock to be 
mined.  Freezing will initially be undertaken from both the 480 m level and from 
surface.  Once the ground for the initial production panels are frozen from 
surface, continued ground freezing activities are planned to be conducted from 
underground.  All production mining is planned to occur from the 480 m level 
using the jet boring mining method. 

Mined ore from the jet bore units will be pumped to the ROM ore receiving facility 
on the 480 m level.  From there, the ore is put through an underground crushing, 
grinding and clarification circuit before being pumped to surface through one of 
two ore slurry pipe lines to be installed in Shaft No. 2.  More details about the ore 
processing can be found in Section 17. 

Figure 16-3 provides a 3-dimensional view of the existing and planned 
development for the Cigar Lake mine.  The layout is a function of the jet boring 
method and the need to freeze the orebody due to ground conditions and 
groundwater and radon control issues.  The layout is also a function of overall 
ventilation, radiation protection and support services requirements. 

The following subsections describe in more detail the infrastructure and 
development activities planned as part of the project completion.

16.2.2 Mine Access  

Shaft No. 1 currently provides access to the underground mine workings and will 
serve as the main service and access shaft during construction and production 
and as a route for delivery of fresh air underground.  It extends from surface to a 
depth of 500 m and provides direct access to the 480 m level.  The level number 
is the approximate depth of that level below surface in meters. Shaft No. 1 is 
circular, concrete lined with a hydrostatic liner, and has an internal diameter of 
4.9 m.  A drift connecting the shaft bottom and 500 m level facilitates 
maintenance and removal of spillage from waste rock hoisting. 

Shaft No. 2 is located approximately 90 m south of Shaft No. 1 and will be 
completed to a planned depth of 500 m.  It is a circular shaft with an internal 
finished diameter of 6.1 m.  The shaft has a non-hydrostatic concrete liner to a 
depth of approximately 368 m and will have a non-hydrostatic liner between the 
480 m and 500 m levels.  The remainder of the shaft between the 368 m depth 
and the 480 m level is being constructed with a hydrostatic liner comprised of 
cast-iron tubbing, which has been successfully used in other mines including 
Saskatchewan's potash mines.  As of early January 2012, Shaft No. 2 has been 
completed to a depth of 480 m.  Sinking to the 500 m depth, followed by shaft 
furnishing, remains to be completed. 

Shaft No. 2 will provide access for personnel and materials to 480 m level.  Shaft 
services will include ore slurry pipes, concrete slick lines, power cables and a 
communication cable.  To supplement underground fresh air requirements and 
permit removal of mine exhaust air, Shaft No. 2 will be constructed with a central 
airtight partition which will divide the shaft into two independent compartments.  
One compartment will serve as the main path for exhaust air from the mine; and 
the second will be used to downcast additional fresh air as well as house the 
service cage to be used for secondary egress.  Commissioning of the Shaft No. 2 
ventilation system is planned to be completed in support of production. 

16.2.3 Mine Development 

There are two main levels in the mine: the 480 and 500 m levels.  Both levels are 
located in the basement rocks below the unconformity.  The 420 m level, located 
in the sandstone above the basement rock, no longer has a use in the updated 
mine plan and has been backfilled to reduce the likelihood of another inflow 
event similar to that of August, 2008.  The 465 m level is also no longer required 
as part of the mine plan, and has been backfilled to reduce the likelihood of 
further ground failure or inflow on that horizon. 

The 480 m level provides access to the production area below the orebody, and 
is typically more than 25 m below the ore zone.  Mine development to the south 
of Shaft No. 1 provides access to Shaft No. 2, the ore recovery and reclaim water 
facilities, the clarifier and the clarifier underflow pachuca.  The main underground 
processing and infrastructure facilities are located on this level.  These facilities 
will consist of the heat exchanger room, high pressure pump room, warehouse, 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

page 113 of 188 

backfill loading station, laboratory, electrical rooms and maintenance shops.  In 
addition, the main mine dewatering pump station and associated electrical 
facilities have been constructed on this level.  The main brine pipeline to the 
underground is planned to be extended in Shaft No. 1 to the 480 m level.  The 
brine mains are currently routed through the backfilled area of the 420 m level, 
and are operating effectively. 

In the production area of the 480 m level, access drifts will be extended on the 
north and south sides of the orebody.  Additional MDS tunnels will be developed 
on 16 m centres in a north-south orientation to facilitate JBS production and 
underground freeze drilling.  Various storage facilities for mine production 
equipment will also be excavated off the north access drift. 

The 500 m level is accessed via a ramp from the 480 m level.  Planned facilities 
on the 500 m level include the recycled water tank, ball mill, base of the clarifier 
underflow (U/F) pachuca and the ore slurry hoisting pump.  Excavation has been 
completed for these facilities, and construction of these facilities has been 
initiated.  A heading has been excavated from the 500 m level Shaft No. 1 
access drift to the new main mine sump, providing for expanded sump capacity 
and ease of operation and maintenance of the mine dewatering system.  The 
main ventilation exhaust drift for the mine is located on this level, and 
development of this drift is in progress. 

16.2.4 Development Requirement During Construction and Operation 

Excavations still required to be completed prior to start of production include:  

• 480 high pressure pump room; 

• 480 m level shops; 

• 480 m level ventilation and piping services drift; 

• north and south access drift extensions on the 480 m level; 

• two additional MDS crosscuts on the 480 m level; 

• various storage and service areas on the 480 m level; 

• 500 m level exhaust ventilation drifts; and 

• exhaust ventilation raises between the 480 and 500 m levels. 

In total, more than 13,000 m of lateral and vertical excavation (excluding the 
Shaft No. 2) is planned to be developed over the life of the mine.  As of 
December 31, 2011, approximately 3,900 m of development has been 
completed, leaving an additional 1,600 m required prior to initial production.  
Additional development requirements have been identified in the updated mine 
design, and they are included in these quantities.  The majority of the excavation 
work will be sited on the 480 and 500 m levels, which together represent the 
main operating area of the mine.

16.2.5 Excavation and Ground Support Methods 

Mine development for construction and operation uses two basic development 
approaches: drill and blast with conventional ground support, and the Mine 
Development System (MDS), a 5.1 m diameter full face tunnel boring machine, 
which installs a precast concrete tunnel lining for ground support.  Use of a 
roadheader excavator is under evaluation for those areas of weak ground away 
from the orebody.  

With the exception of the MDS headings, the infrastructure excavations and the 
access drifts are being developed using conventional drill and blast mining 
methods.  Geotechnical drilling and analysis of ground conditions is completed 
prior to confirming permanent infrastructure locations. 

Cameco plans its mine development to take place away from known groundwater 
sources whenever possible.  In addition, Cameco assesses all planned mine 
development for relative risk and applies extensive additional technical and 
operating controls for all higher risk development. 

Conventional Drill and Blast Development 

A drill and blast method, utilizing full face advance, is being applied in the 
competent ground, primarily for access drifts surrounding the orebody and for 
infrastructure excavations.  Grouted rebar and shotcrete are used as the primary 
support system.  Wire mesh and straps are used locally, as required.  Rockbolt 
spacing and shotcrete thickness vary with localized ground conditions.  Spiling 
installed ahead of the excavation is used locally in poor ground.  Cable bolts, 
typically 5 m in length, are also being installed in the back of large excavations, 
such as the clarifier and ball mill room, as well as at most intersections.  Modified 
excavation techniques or additional ground support, such as steel arches, will be 
applied in areas of poor ground conditions in the access drifts. 

Mine Development System (MDS) 

One of the features of the MDS is that it provides continuous temporary ground 
support during excavation and almost immediate installation of permanent 
ground support after excavation.  This feature is critical for development in areas 
of poor ground conditions underneath the orebody where there is minimal stand-
up time. 

The MDS excavates a 5.1 m diameter heading with a finished inside diameter of 
4.25 m.  The annular space between the liner and rock mass is filled with grout.  
Six concrete segments are required for each metre of crosscut advance.  During 
the test mining period, two crosscuts were completed on the 480 m level and one 
crosscut was partially completed on the 465 m level using the MDS.  Since that 
time two additional crosscuts have been excavated on the 480 m level. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
page 115 of 188 

In 2011, Cameco identified some spalling and cracking of the tunnel segments in 
a short section of one of the crosscuts that was excavated in 1999.  Cameco has 
taken steps to halt the deterioration and has reinforced the affected area.  
Cameco retained two geotechnical consultants to provide advice on the need for 
any possible further tunnel reinforcement.  Based on the recommendations of 
these consultants, some minor revisions may be required to modify the life-of-
mine plan or segment design to ensure that the portion of the Mineral Reserves 
to be mined from this tunnel section are not negatively impacted, and that similar 
conditions will not arise elsewhere.  At this time, there is no impact from this 
tunnel deterioration anticipated on the initial production, however, Cameco does 
need to take some action to ensure the production rampup schedule is 
maintained.  The consultants' reports are expected to be completed early in 
2012. 

A unique feature of the MDS for Cigar Lake is the performance requirement for 
the tunnel liner segments.  These segments are constructed using a very high 
strength concrete, currently greater than 100 MPa.  To date, Cameco has used 
western Canadian commercial suppliers of pre-cast concrete to supply the 
segments.  Cameco has most of the segments in inventory required for the two 
tunnels to be excavated during construction.  Procurement of the remaining 
segments will be done through a western Canadian suppler.  No delays are 
expected to the project schedule.  For ongoing procurement of tunnel segments 
during mine operation, Cameco intends to enter into a commercial agreement 
with a northern Saskatchewan supplier. 

16.2.6 Ground Freezing 

Test mining experience and modelling studies have demonstrated the 
advantages of ground freezing over other potential ground conditioning methods. 
These advantages include stabilizing and strengthening the weak ore and the 
surrounding ground, minimization of ground water inflows while mining, and 
attenuation of radon release.  The ground to be frozen includes the ore body, the 
weak, water bearing sandstone above the ore, as well as a zone extending both 
laterally away from the orebody and beneath it. 

The freezing strategy is to bulk freeze the ore zone and the surrounding area, as 
noted above, prior to start of mining in a given area.  Temperature holes installed 
in the area to be frozen are used to determine when the ground has reached its 
required temperature.  Where required, the ground above the MDS tunnels may 
be frozen prior to MDS development as there is a potential risk of inflow from 
historical unsecured surface diamond drillholes.  Localized ground freezing may 
also be used to allow development of access drifts to take place in areas of weak 
ground away from the orebody.   

Cameco plans to use a hybrid freezing approach in the early part of the mine life.  
It plans to use surface freezing to freeze the ground for the initial four to five 
production panels, and then transition to lower-cost underground freezing for the 
remainder of the planned mine life.

Freeze System 

The ground freezing system consists of an ammonia refrigeration plant on 
surface used for both the surface and underground freeze systems, a surface 
and underground brine distribution piping system and in-situ freeze pipes.  The 
freeze plant has a capacity of approximately 900 tons refrigerant.  For the 
underground freeze system, calcium chloride brine at approximately minus 40 °C 
is circulated underground through 300 mm diameter insulated pipes installed in 
Shaft No. 1. The brine is received by heat exchangers underground which in turn 
cools the brine circulated through the freeze pipes installed in the freezeholes.  
This system freezes the deposit and surrounding rock to between minus 10 °C 
and 20 °C in one to three years, depending on freeze pipe geometry and ground 
properties such as water content, thermal conductivity, etc.  The underground 
freeze system is currently operating. 

For the surface freeze system, the calcium chloride brine is circulated to the 
collars of the freezeholes from the freeze plant via insulated pipes in an overhead 
pipe rack.  As of December 31, 2011, 41 of a planned 250 holes have been 
drilled, and outfitting of the holes with brine circulation tubes was in progress.  
Installation of the surface brine distribution piping is substantially complete.  
Ground freezing in some of these new holes was initiated in late December 2011. 

Freezing From Underground 

Orebody ground freezing activities are conducted from beneath the ore zone on 
the 480 m level in tunnels typically referred to as freeze cross-cuts.  Ground 
freezing is accomplished by drilling holes from the freeze cross-cuts to a 
minimum of 15 m above the ore zone using specially designed drills, although 
the holes drilled prior to the 2006 mine flood were only drilled to approximately 10 
m above the ore zone.  Holes are generally drilled on a 2 m by 11 m pattern, 
although tighter spacing can be used to help reduced the time required to freeze 
the ground.  The freeze cross-cuts are planned to be nominally spaced 48 m 
apart, although optimization and operating experience over the life of the mine 
may drive changes to this proposed design.  The typical JBS and freezehole 
arrangement is shown in Figure 16- 4. 

Prior to drilling each hole, a standpipe or casing is installed in the hole collar to 
support the preventor system.  The preventor system is installed to secure the 
hole in the event that water is intersected while drilling.  The rods used to drill the 
hole are left in place and become used as the freeze pipes.  This configuration is 
the same as that used successfully at Cigar Lake prior to the mine flooding in 
2006, and is similar to the system in use at the McArthur River mine to conduct 
ground freezing. 

Temperature monitoring holes are also drilled from the underground freeze 
cross-cuts approximately every 6 to 12 m, to measure ground temperatures and 
indicate the progress of freezing.

Freezing From Surface 

Based on the results of the surface freeze test program completed at Cigar Lake 
in 2010, Cameco began to implement ground freezing from surface for a portion 
of the overall project.  Approximately 250 freeze and temperature holes will be 
drilled for the purpose of freezing the first four production panels.  The expected 
benefits to the project by implementing this strategy include: 

• reducing the risk to the construction schedule in two ways: 

(1) the surface freeze process can start before developing the 
underground tunnels; and 

(2) the construction activities underground are simplified by moving 
some of the related freezing activities and infrastructure to 
surface; and 

• contributing positively to the overall project economics. 

Freeze and temperature holes will be drilled initially on a 5 m x 5 m pattern, 
expanding to possibly 6 m x 6 m for production panels #3 and #4.  Drilling is 
currently in progress using diamond drills, although other drill rigs may be used in 
an attempt to improve drilling costs and productivities.  Holes are being drilled to 
a depth of 465 m, which is approximately 15 m below the bottom of the ore zone.  
A freeze isolation packer will be installed at a depth of approximately 400 m, to 
allow ground freezing to take place only in the bottom portion of the hole.

16.2.7 Ventilation 

The mine ventilation system has been designed to supply fresh air to the working 
areas, remove contaminated air from the mine and to reduce the potential for 
radon gas build-up. 

The primary ventilation system has been designed to supply a volume of up to 
240 m3/s of fresh air to the mine.  The primary ventilation fans have already been 
installed, and are comprised of three 800 HP fans on surface at Shaft No. 2.  
These fans will draw contaminated mine air up through the exhaust compartment 
in that shaft.  The second compartment in Shaft No. 2 will intake fresh air to the 
mine and for this service three 200 HP fans and a mine air heater have been 
installed.  Shaft No. 1 will be another fresh air intake to the mine and is equipped 
with a mine air heater and two associated 60 HP fans.  As part of a planned 
upgrade prior to start of production, two new mine air heaters and two new 200 
HP intake fans will replace the existing heaters and intake fans. 

The mine air heaters will be used during the winter months to heat the ventilating 
air to approximately plus 5 °C.  The heaters are direct fired propane heaters 
installed at the ventilation intake locations at both Shaft No. 1 and Shaft No. 2.  

The auxiliary ventilation system will draw airflow from the primary circuit and, 
through the use of fans and vent ducting, will provide appropriate ventilation to 
the production and development headings and other work areas and facilities. 

Local extraction systems to remove potentially contaminated air will be 
established at a number of locations as part of the secondary ventilation system.  
Once captured inside a duct, the radon contaminated air will be discharged 
directly into a dedicated exhaust drift or raise or ducted directly into Shaft No. 2 
and subsequently discharged to surface. 

The designed mine ventilation volume of 240 m3/s is anticipated to provide 
sufficient airflow through the mine for use of diesel equipment and radiation 
protection at a sustained production rate of approximately 18 million pounds per 
year U3O8.  Should this volume of air prove inadequate for radiation protection at 
the designed production rate, the rate of production would be negatively 
impacted without additional capital expenditure to increase the ventilation 
throughput. 

16.2.8 Mining Equipment 

The mining equipment list reflects the planned mining equipment requirements 
for mine operation and production.  All of the mine equipment for mine operation 
is expected to be owned by Cameco with the possible exception being the freeze 
drills.  Contractor's mining equipment will augment the Cameco fleet during mine 
development and construction and the capital and operating cost estimates 
reflect this.

Production related mining equipment will be comprised of four JBS units 
supported with two concrete pumps for backfilling purposes.  Ongoing mine 
development will be completed using conventional drilling and blasting 
equipment for access drifts, and a tunnel boring machine (MDS) for tunnels 
beneath the ore zone.  Cameco is considering purchasing a roadheader unit for 
access drift development in poor ground conditions; the costs to purchase and 
operate the machine are reflected in the life-of-mine operating cost estimate. 

During mine operation, all freeze drilling is planned to be done from underground.  
A fleet of up to six freeze drills will be required to ensure freeze drilling and 
ground freezing is completed sufficiently ahead of planned mining activities. 

Other mining equipment, such as scissor lifts and utility vehicles, will be used to 
support the mine development and production activities. 

Table 16-2 shows a list of the key underground mining equipment that is planned 
to be used for development and production.

16.2.9 Mine Water Management 

A mine water handling strategy has been developed that includes increasing the 
mine's water-handling capabilities for future routine and potential non-routine 
inflows above the existing capability previously assessed by Cameco (2004) in 
the Cigar Lake Project Environmental Assessment Study Report (EASR).  In 
addition to treating all routine water inflows (seepage and process water) prior to 
releasing to the environment, water from any non-routine inflow will also be 
treated prior to releasing to the environment until such time as the inflow can be 
mitigated at the source.  Cameco submitted a screening level environmental 
assessment to discharge all treated effluent (except sewage) through two 
pipelines directly to a single location in Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake, and a 
positive decision was received in 2011.  Construction of the facility is in progress, 
and is scheduled for completion in mid-2012.  Permission to operate the facility is 
still required, but cannot be obtained until construction is complete and the facility 
has been fully commissioned.  An environmental monitoring program will be in 
place prior to operating the facility. 

In order to be able to respond quickly and efficiently to any potential future mine 
inflow, staff at Cigar Lake have prepared a comprehensive document containing 
a number of water inflow planning scenarios.  The document contains information 
on equipment, material and personnel required to deal with various inflow 
scenarios, as well as suggested sequences of activities to deal with different 
inflow scenarios in different locations of the mine. 

Bulkhead doors are no longer part of the mine inflow management strategy at 
Cigar Lake. 

Hydrogeological Model 

Hydrogeological flow modeling of the Cigar Lake deposit area was commissioned 
after the initial flooding of the mine in October 2006, when it was recognized that 
a better understanding of the complex hydrogeology was required for managing 
non-routine inflows.  It was completed by an independent consultant in 2008.  
Further updates were made to the model in 2010 based on revisions to the 
geological model and piezometer readings from the August 2008 inflow, which 
were used to calibrate the model. 

In the case of a non-routine inflow, the hydrogeological flow model predicted an 
instantaneous inflow rate of up to 1,250 m3/h, falling to a sustained rate of 
700 m3/h after approximately three days.  Natural water seepage into the mine 
workings is expected to be approximately 30-35 m3/h over the life of the mine. 

Mine Dewatering & Treatment System 

The mine dewatering system has been designed and constructed to handle both 
routine and non-routine inflows.  In early 2012, Cameco had increased its 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 122 of 188 

 

installed mine dewatering capacity to 2,500 m3/h.  Mine water treatment capacity 
has been increased to 2,550 m3/h and an environmental permit to discharge 
routine and non-routine treated water to Seru Bay is in process (see above).  As 
a result, Cameco believes it has pumping capacity to meet its standard for the 
project of one and a half times the estimated maximum inflow. 

The mine dewatering system is comprised of three main pumping systems.  The 
primary system has a designed capacity of 700 m3/h, and will handle the daily 
routine dewatering requirements.  It will also be used in the event of a non-
routine inflow.  The contingency mine dewatering system will have installed 
pumping capacity of 800 m3/h provided by high speed multistage centrifugal 
pumps located in a new pump room on the 480 m level.  This system is currently 
installed in a temporary pump room, and will be relocated once construction and 
electrical installation is complete in the permanent facility.  The third system is 
comprised of four borehole pumps, installed and controlled from surface, and has 
a designed pumping capacity of 1000 m3/h.  All three pumping systems draw 
water from central collection sumps on the 500 m level, the lowest working level 
in the mine.  All of the systems are routinely tested to ensure they are operating 
within their required capacities. 

The mine water treatment plant (WTP) has a capacity to treat and release mine 
effluent at a rate of 550 m3/h.  In the case of a mine water inflow exceeding this 
amount, a contingency water treatment system will be activated.  This system is 
comprised of a 90,000 m3 holding pond for water clarification and a 10,000 m3 
pond for surge capacity and two reagent addition buildings with capacities of 
1,000 m3/h each.  The WTP currently releases treated mine effluent into the Aline 
Creek system, and will change over to discharging into Seru Bay once the above 
described facilities are constructed and a licence to operate the facility has been 
obtained. 

As a result, Cameco believes it has sufficient pumping, water treatment and 
surface storage capacity to handle the estimated maximum inflow. 

16.2.10 Independent Review of Mine Design 

In 2011, in connection with a regulatory requirement, Cameco retained an 
independent engineering consultant to perform a technical review of the Cigar 
Lake mine design.  The scope of the assessment was to review the geological, 
geotechnical and hydrogeological characteristics of the deposit and to evaluate 
whether the characteristics have been appropriately incorporated into the mine 
design.  Particular focus was spent on the mine layout, ground excavation and 
support plan, ground freezing approach and the mine dewatering capacity.  The 
review also encompassed the procedural controls Cameco has put in place to 
manage the risks in each of these areas. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

Page 123 of 188 

 

The consultant found no significant exclusions or deficiencies in the material 
reviewed that would have negative impacts on the ground stability of the 
excavations or lead to an uncontrolled water inflow into the Cigar Lake mine.   

A number of recommendations and suggestions for follow-up were included in 
the report provided by the consultant in the areas of geological interpretation, 
hydrogeological modelling, ground freezing, geotechnical data interpretation and 
ground stability assessment. Cameco has accepted the consultant's 
recommendations and has an action plan in place to address them in a timely 
manner. 

16.3 Mine Production 

16.3.1 Mining Method Selection 

The JBS mining method is new to the uranium mining industry and was 
developed and adapted specifically for the Cigar Lake deposit.  Selection and 
optimization of a mining method capable of extracting the ore efficiently and 
economically required addressing several geotechnical and hydrogeological 
challenges such as: 

• The low strength of the rock formations encompassing and underlying the 
orebody and necessary ground support required to stabilize these formations. 

• The presence of large volumes of groundwater expected to be encountered 
while mining the ore or drilling in the overlying sandstone rock formation 
(including for freezehole drilling) and the potential for a water inflow. 

• The high level of radiation build-up from the ore and the associated radon 
gas from the water in contact with the ore, necessitating containment and 
isolation to provide adequate protection to the workers. 

The JBS mining method and overall mining plan for the Cigar Lake project have 
been developed specifically to mitigate these challenges and mine the deposit in 
a safe and economic manner. 

A description of the test mining activities undertaken to develop the JBS mining 
method can be found in Section 16.1.3. 

16.3.2 Jet Boring Mining Method 

Jet boring mining will consist of cutting the ore with a high pressure water jet 
using the JBS.  The JBS mining units will cut cavities of approximately 4.5 m 
diameter in the previously frozen ore from each set-up, producing approximately 
230 t of ore for a typical 6 m ore thickness.  All mining with the JBS will be done 
from the 480 m production level, located in the basement rock below the ore 
zone.  Following mining, each cavity will be backfilled with concrete. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 124 of 188 

 

The features of jet boring as a mining method at Cigar Lake are: 

• The method is a non-entry mining method as personnel do not enter into the 
ore zone, and an operator located some distance away from the jet borer can 
control the equipment remotely.  These are two essential requirements for 
radiation control during mining of the high grade deposit. 

• The cutting of ore with high pressure water produces a slurry which can be 
pumped in pipelines.  This provides the complete containment necessary for 
minimizing radiation exposure to workers while utilizing a relatively simple 
and cost effective method for pumping the slurry away from the mining area. 

• The generation of airborne dust can be eliminated since the cutting and 
material transport are both wet and contained processes.  This is a significant 
advantage for radiation control of the mining of high grade uranium ore. 

• The incorporation of a drill string inflatable packer within the jet boring system 
provides a final point of control for managing a potential inrush of water 
associated with mining. 

• Water jets provide the opportunity to excavate ore next to a backfilled cavity 
without incurring significant dilution from concrete with careful control, 
through in-hole cavity monitoring.  The water jets can also mine around 
freeze pipes without causing damage to them. 

• Jet boring incorporates a fan pattern for drilling the jet bore holes from the 
production crosscuts, resulting in a design with a reasonable spacing of these 
headings considering geotechnical stability and economics. 

The jet boring mining method is illustrated in Figure 16-5.

16.3.3 Backfill System 

The JBS cavity backfill system and the concrete mix design were tested during 
the test mining phase (see Section 16.1.3).  The concrete mix is designed to 
achieve high early strength in frozen ground.  During the JBS test mining phase, 
it was demonstrated that the concrete backfill remained intact while jetting an 
adjacent cavity, with little measureable dilution from the concrete.  A few 
modifications have been made to the design since that time, but no further field 
trials have been conducted. 

Concrete will be prepared on surface in a concrete batch plant.  The concrete will 
be delivered underground through a concrete slickline to a receiving station.  The 
concrete will be transported from the receiving station to the production crosscut 
in either a truck or will be pumped directly from the receiving station to a re-mix 
station before being pumped to the production crosscut.  From there, it will be 
pumped directly into each mined-out JBS cavity using a conventional concrete 
pump.  Every JBS cavity will be filled with concrete backfill to enhance ground 
stability and prevent orebody erosion while mining an adjacent cavity. 

A concrete batch plant and one slickline in Shaft No. 1 are currently in place.  
Two additional slicklines are planned to be installed in Shaft No. 2.  Following 
production startup, Cameco plans to construct a second batch plant, drill two new 
borehole slicklines from surface and construct a new underground receiving 
station.  Costs for these activities are included in the project capital and operating 
cost estimates. 

16.3.4 Mine Production Criteria and Assumptions 

The design criteria and scheduling assumptions for jet boring during production 
were developed from the results of the test mining and are summarized as 
follows:  

• Average cavity size of 4.5 m diameter and 6 m height resulting in 
approximately 230 t of ore in place for an average cavity. 

• 160 hour average cycle time per cavity, plus a backfilling allowance. 

• Four jet boring machines required to produce 18 Mlbs/yr of U3O8. 

• Two jet boring machines will be required to mine at a given time.  Due to 
limitations on high-pressure water availability, no more than two units will be 
able to jet at any one time. 

• The third and fourth jet boring units will be either moving, setting up, 
undergoing maintenance, or waiting for high-pressure water for jetting.

16.3.5 Production Schedule 

The mine life based on current Mineral Reserves will be approximately 15 years 
with an estimated full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8 recovered 
from the mill.  Cigar Lake will produce less than the full annual production in the 
early and late years of the planned mine life. 

The following is a general summary of the Cigar Lake production schedule based 
on current Mineral Reserves: 

• Total mill production of 213.5 million pounds U3O8, based upon an overall 
milling recovery of 98.5%. 

• Total mine production of 537 thousand t ore. 

• Average mill feed grade of 18.3% U3O8. 

• Mine operating life of approximately 15 years. 

• Commissioning in ore is planned to begin in mid-2013, with the first pounds 
to be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

• Mining rate is variable to produce at a constant production level of U3O8.  The 
average mine production varies annually from 100 to 140 t/d during peak 
production depending on the grade of ore being mined. 

• Cameco expects to ramp up to the full production rate by the end of 2017.  
Full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8 is expected to be 
achieved in 2018. 

The mine and mill production schedules for the Cigar Lake project are shown in 
Table 16-3 and Figures 16-6 and 16-7, respectively. 

The Cigar Lake production schedule relies upon the ground being sufficiently 
frozen prior to the start of JBS mining.  As part of the mining plan, the orebody 
has been divided into production panels, with one JBS unit operating in any 
panel.  At least four production panels need to be frozen at any point in time to 
achieve the full annual production of 18 million pounds of U3O8. 

There is a change from the 2010 Technical Report to the production profile, with 
slightly lower production expected in the first years of the project offset by higher 
production in the later years.  Cameco expects its share of production in 2013 to 
be about 0.3 million pounds.  This compares to Cameco's previous estimate of 
one million pounds.  This and other revisions to Cameco's production schedule 
represent an 8.7% decrease in Cameco's production forecast through 2016 and 
are as a result of the extended period required for remediation, a better 
understanding of the geology and lower grades in initial production panels.  See 
Section 16.3.6 for more details.

Jet Boring System (JBS) Commissioning and Production Rampup 

To address the inherent risk of a new mining method, Cameco implemented a 
comprehensive testing, commissioning and startup plan specific to the JBS.  This 
plan includes surface and underground testing of the JBS unit, training of 
personnel on the unit in a non-production scenario, conducting reliability 
engineering studies, and implementing the findings of these studies into both the 
training of personnel and modification of the JBS system to assure as effective 
and efficient a startup as possible.  The implementation plan for the mechanical 
commissioning of the entire system has been prepared and work is progressing.  
Plans for integration of the various teams, namely geology, engineering and mine 
operations, is in progress.  Recruitment for some key positions has already taken 
place.  A simulator is planned to be built to facilitate training on the JBS unit. 

As part of the overall commissioning plan, a number of progressive steps have 
been developed to ready the JBS unit and production facilities for ore production.  
Through part of 2011, the JBS unit was assembled in a machine shop in 
Saskatoon.  Testing and modification of various mechanical and electrical 
systems was completed.  Starting early in 2012, the JBS unit will be assembled 
underground and installed in an existing production tunnel.  Drilling of as many 
as ten test pilot holes is planned in waste rock to test the primary drilling systems 
of the unit and to start hands-on training with the operators and maintenance 
personnel.  As many as ten test cavities will then be mined in waste rock to test 
many of the jetting systems, such as portions of the high pressure pumping 
system, jetting nozzle, cavity survey tools and backfill system, as well as facilitate 
further training.  A further four cavities are planned to be test-mined in waste rock 
to facilitate commissioning of the JBS systems as well as the underground 
processing facilities.  Full commissioning of the entire system will take place with 
ore following successful completion of the above mentioned plan as well as any 
required regulatory approvals. 

The production rampup schedule is based on starting production with one JBS 
unit, then bringing additional units on-line in approximately nine month intervals.  
Purchase, assembly and commissioning of the three remaining JBS units is 
planned to take place with enough lead time to meet this schedule.  Cameco has 
chosen to single source the manufacturing and supply of the three remaining 
JBS units to a European based, global mining and tunnelling, equipment 
supplier.  The supplier and Cameco having been working closely through the 
past two decades of research, development and testing of the JBS mining 
method and associated equipment and process.  Changes to equipment design 
and configuration and any other lessons learned from start up of earlier units will 
be incorporated where possible on subsequent units.  Productivity rampup 
factors have been applied to the overall production schedule to reflect faster 
integration and training from JBS units one through four.

16.3.6 Mine Production Rampup Comparison – 2010 Technical Report to 
Current Plan 

Cameco is reporting a 4% decrease in tonnage and an 8% increase in the grade 
of the Mineral Reserves as compared to the December 31, 2010 estimate.  
These changes are described in Section 15.3 and are comprised of two main 
components:  changes to the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve model and 
removal of dilution from the mill feed. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 131 of 188 

Delineation drilling of the Phase 1 area in 2010 and 2011, plus the incorporation 
of freezehole radiometric data, has contributed to changes in the geological 
interpretation, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates and 
classification.  One area that saw a grade decrease is the area planned for 
mining during the rampup period.  This area showed an overall grade decrease 
of approximately 2% U3O8.  This decrease in grade in the initial production 
panels has contributed to the slower production rampup. 

Cameco has also revised the mine plan to remove dilution, primarily sump 
underflow material, from the mill feed.  Removal of this nearly 42,000 tonnes, 
grading 0% U3O8, has contributed to the grade increase of the Mineral Reserves 
estimated in this technical report, as compared to the Mineral Reserves 
estimated in the 2010 Technical Report.  This 42,000 tonnes was allocated as 
approximately 3,000 tonnes per year in the production schedule. 

Table 16-4 shows a comparison between the 2010 Technical Report and this 
technical report of the first five years of planned production to illustrate the 
impacts of the changes to the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve model and 
removal of dilution from the mill feed. In the current production plan, cumulative 
production to the end of 2017 is approximately 117,000 tonnes grading 18.7% 
U3O8.  After removing approximately 3,000 tonnes per year from the production 
schedule shown in the 2010 Technical Report, cumulative production to the end 
of 2017 would have been 116,800 tonnes grading 20.7%.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Overview 

Cigar Lake ore will be processed at two locations.  Size reduction will be 
conducted underground at Cigar Lake and leaching, purification and final 
yellowcake production and packaging will occur at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  
The ore will be trucked in slurry form from Cigar Lake to the McClean Lake JEB 
mill in purpose-built containers identical to those used successfully to transport 
McArthur River ore slurry to the Key Lake mill.  Where possible, design of the 
processing facilities for Cigar Lake ore has been modeled on those successfully 
operating at McArthur River and Key Lake. 

17.2 Cigar Lake Flowsheet 

Mined ore and drill cuttings will be piped into local pump boxes as a slurry for 
transfer to run of mine ore storage sumps.  Partially dewatered ore will be 
reclaimed from the sumps by an overhead crane mounted clamshell and fed by a 
screw feeder through a water flush cone crusher.  Crusher discharge will report 
mostly to a ball mill operating in closed circuit with classification cyclones.  
Grinding circuit product will be dewatered and then report to an underground ore 
slurry storage pachuca tank.  From there, the ore slurry will be pumped by 
positive displacement pumps through slurry pipelines up Shaft No. 2 to ore 
storage pachucas located on the surface.  Thickened ore slurry will be loaded 
into 5 m3 containers (four containers per truck) for shipment by road to the 
McClean Lake JEB mill. 

As much as reasonably possible, untreated water will be recirculated in the 
underground process.  Excess water will be pumped to surface and treated in a 
conventional two stage water treatment plant.  Treated water will be recycled in 
the mining and processing circuits where required.  The excess treated water will 
be released to the environment via a monitoring pond system similar to that used 
successfully at other facilities such as McArthur River and Key Lake.  
Precipitated solids from the water treatment process will be dewatered and 
stored on-site for future disposal underground. 

Construction of the water treatment plant is complete while construction on the 
surface processing facilities is well under way.  Engineering design for the 
underground processing facilities is being revised in accordance with the 2010 
mine plan and dewatering systems.  The construction of the underground portion 
of the process equipment has commenced in accordance with the overall project 
plan. 

A high level operation flow sheet of the project ore processing activities is shown 
in Figure 17-1.

17.3 Processing at McClean Lake 

With the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement, which amended the JEB Toll 
Milling Agreement, the McClean Lake JEB mill is being expanded to process and 
package all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves.  Currently, the McClean 
Lake JEB mill has a production capacity of 12 Mlbs U3O8 per year.  In order to 
process all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves and other ores at McClean 
Lake, the total production capacity at the McClean Lake JEB mill will be 
increased to 22 Mlbs U3O8 per year.  Construction of the expanded facility is 
scheduled to begin in 2012 and be completed in 2015.  Mill operation will 
continue during the construction stages in order to meet the Cigar Lake 
production schedule. 

All of the 18 million pounds of U3O8 annual output from Cigar Lake will be 
converted to yellowcake at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  For further discussion of 
the McClean Lake JEB mill and the JEB Toll Milling Agreement, see Sections 18 
and 19.2.1, respectively. 

17.4 McClean Lake JEB Mill Flowsheet  

Finely ground ore averaging 18.3% U3O8 will be trucked from Cigar Lake by B-
trains carrying four 5 m3 slurry containers (3.9 t solids capacity each) to a new 
receiving facility located at McClean Lake.  Slurry receiving at McClean Lake has 
been modeled on the Key Lake ore slurry receiving facility with enhancements.  
The slurry will be off-loaded by vacuum, thickened and pumped to storage 
pachuca tanks. 

The existing two stage near atmospheric pressure leach circuit will be 
reconfigured to two parallel low pressure circuits to allow ore to be leached 
separately from other ore feeds to McClean Lake.  Leach cooling and hydrogen 
gas concentration control have been added to deal with the exothermic reaction 
and potential for hydrogen evolution from leaching the high grade ore.  An 
oxygen plant was constructed to provide the leach oxidizing agent.  The existing 
hydrogen peroxide system will be available as an alternative.  The leached 
solution will be fed to the existing primary thickener.  The overflow will report 
directly to the clarification area, and the underflow will be washed with the leach 
residues from other McClean Lake ores in the Counter Current Decantation 
(CCD) circuit.  Additional wash capacity is available in the new Counter Current 
Cyclone (CCC) circuit, and can be implemented if required.  Additional 
clarification and storage capacity will be provided for pregnant leach solution.  
The washed and clarified uranium solution will be fed to two parallel Solvent 
Extraction (SX) plants.  The existing 10 Mlbs U3O8/year circuit capacity will be 
supplemented by a new 17 Mlbs U3O8/year SX circuit to provide a total capacity 
of 27 Mlbs U3O8/yr.  The pregnant strip solution from the SX circuit will be fed to 
two parallel molybdenum removal carbon column circuits comprised of two new 
columns in addition to the existing six.  Additional capacity will be installed in the 
precipitation circuit to increase retention times and improve barren strip 
clarification.  A new centrifuge will provide yellowcake dewatering requirements

with the existing centrifuge providing additional capacity if required.  Existing 
calciner and packaging facilities will be used to provide the packaged, calcined 
product. 

The construction of the new and modified facilities required at McClean Lake for 
processing of all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves are yet to be 
completed.  Further to the changes mentioned above, a third ammonia reagent 
supply tank will be added for solvent extraction and precipitation.  An additional 
ammonium sulphate crystallization plant similar in size to the existing plant will be 
installed as well.  The existing acid plant will be expanded to deal with the 
increased demand.  A new tailings neutralisation circuit will be constructed to 
provide the retention times required. 

Extra storage capacity and on-site production for ferric sulphate solution reagent 
have been added.  In addition, the mixing and storage capacity for mixed barium 
chloride solution reagent has been enlarged. 

Cameco believes that the McClean Lake JEB mill will have access to sufficient 
water, power and process supplies necessary to process all of Cigar Lake's 
current Mineral Reserves.  For further discussion of the McClean Lake JEB mill 
infrastructure, see Section 18.  

17.5 Mill Recovery 

Based on the test results, an overall uranium process mill recovery of 98.5% has 
been used.  The processing of ore is described further in Section 13 and details 
of the anticipated process losses are listed in Section 13.2. 

This recovery is similar to that achieved at Cameco's other Saskatchewan 
operations.  For reference, historically the Key Lake mill treating McArthur River 
mine ore achieves a recovery of approximately 98.7% and the Rabbit Lake mill 
treating Eagle Point mine ore achieves a recovery of approximately 97.0%.  The 
lower recovery at the Rabbit Lake mill is due to the lower feed grade from the 
mine to the mill as compared to the McArthur River ore feeding the Key Lake mill.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

Test mining development was conducted from 1987 to 1993, including the 
sinking of Shaft No. 1 and development on the 420, 480 and 465 m levels.  Some 
surface infrastructure was also constructed during the test-mining phase 
including a 550 m3/h water treatment plant.  Pre-construction activities were 
started at the Cigar Lake site in 2002.  Full construction activities on the Cigar 
Lake site began in January 2005 following approval of the project by the CLJV 
partners in December of 2004.  Just prior to the mine inflow of October 23, 2006, 
the capital construction project was approximately 60% complete (under the 
previous mine plan). 

As of December 31, 2011, underground development required for the start of 
production is estimated at 70% complete, based on required infrastructure 
changes identified in the updated mine plan.  Surface construction is estimated to

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Markets 

19.1.1 Overview 

Nuclear plants around the world use uranium to generate electricity.  The 
following is an overview of the uranium market.  

Uranium Demand 

The demand for U3O8 is directly linked to the level of electricity generated by 
nuclear power plants.  World uranium consumption has increased from 
approximately 75 million pounds U3O8 in 1980 to about 165 million pounds U3O8 
in 2011. 

Uranium Supply 

Uranium supply sources include primary mine production and secondary sources 
such as excess inventories, uranium made available from defence stockpiles and 
the decommissioning of nuclear weapons, re-enriched depleted uranium tails, 
and used reactor fuel that has been reprocessed. 

Mine Production 

The uranium production industry is international in scope with a small number of 
companies operating in relatively few countries.  In 2011, world mine production 
was estimated at 143 million pounds U3O8. 

In 2011, an estimated 61% of world mine production was marketed by five 
producers and 79% of estimated world production was sourced from five 
countries.  The 2011 estimated world production is shown in Table 19-1.

Uranium Markets and Prices 

Uranium is not traded in meaningful quantities on a commodity exchange.  
Utilities buy the majority of their uranium products under long-term contracts with 
suppliers and meet the rest of their needs on the spot market.  

Cameco sells uranium to nuclear utilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Finland, 
France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United 
States.  

In 2011, 37% of Cameco's U3O8 sales were to five customers. 

Cameco currently has commitments to supply more than 290 million pounds of 
U3O8 under long-term contracts with 54 customers worldwide.  Cameco's five 
largest customers account for 47% of these commitments, and 38% of Cameco's 
committed sales volume is attributed to purchasers in the Americas (United 
States, Canada and Latin America), 36% in Asia and 26% in Europe. 

Uranium Spot Market 

The industry average spot price (TradeTech and UxC) on December 31, 2011 
was US$51.88 per pound U3O8, down 17% from US$62.25 per pound U3O8 at 
the end of 2010. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

Long-Term Uranium Market 

The industry average long-term price (TradeTech and UxC) on December 31, 
2011 was US$62.00 per pound U3O8, down 6% from US$66.00 per pound U3O8 
on December 31, 2010.  

19.1.2 Cameco Market Studies and Analyses 

Cameco prepares a uranium supply and demand forecast which reflects its view 
of supply from all known sources as well as demand from all of the existing and 
planned reactors in the world. Cameco maintains detailed models tracking 
supplies by source – production as well as secondary supplies – and demand by 
reactor. In the preparation of this forecast, Cameco reviews detailed supply and 
demand models published by industry, such as the World Nuclear Association, 
tracks public announcements about supplies and reactors, then applies its own 
expertise and develops a forecast. 

The qualified persons for Sections 14, 15, 21 and 22 have reviewed the studies 
and analyses underlying Cameco's uranium and supply demand forecast and 
confirm that the results of these studies and analyses support the assumptions 
used for the portions of the technical report such qualified persons are 
responsible for. 

19.2 Material Contracts for Property Development 

There are no contracts material to Cameco that are required for development of 
Cigar Lake other than: 

• the JEB Toll Milling Agreement described in Section 19.2.1. 

• the agreement to manufacture and supply the JBS units described in 
Section 19.2.2. 

Section 19.2.3 below contains a description of Cameco's uranium sales contract 
portfolio, including the base-load contracts that were put in place to support the 
development of Cigar Lake after the development decision was made by the 
CLJV. 

19.2.1 JEB Toll Milling Agreement 

Cigar Lake ore will be processed at the JEB mill located at AREVA's McClean 
Lake operations, 70 km to the northeast.  The MLJV owns the McClean Lake 
operation, including the JEB mill, and AREVA is the operator of the MLJV.  The 
milling arrangements are subject to the terms and conditions of the JEB Toll 
Milling Agreement described below. 

The JEB Toll Milling Agreement between the CLJV (including Cameco) and the 
MLJV, made effective January 1, 2002, as amended by a Memorandum of 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 142 of 188 

Agreement, made effective November 30, 2011, sets out the terms and 
conditions by which the MLJV will process Cigar Lake ore delivered to the 
McClean Lake JEB mill into uranium concentrates. 

The Memorandum of Agreement: 

(a) terminates the Rabbit Lake Toll Milling Agreement; 

(b) provides that all Phase 1 Cigar Lake ore will be processed at the JEB mill 
and the MLJV will dedicate the necessary mill capacity to process 18 
million pounds per annum;   

(c) provides that the CLJV will be responsible to pay for the additional capital 
costs to modify the JEB mill to process Phase 1 ore excluding the capital 
costs associated with JEB tailings management facility;  

(d) subject to a capped capital contribution from the CLJV of $4.6 million 
provides that the MLJV will be responsible for all capital costs required to 
ensure that the JEB tailings management facility can receive and 
accommodate tailings from processing all of the Phase 1 ore; 

(e) contemplates that if an expansion of the JEB tailings management facility 
is required in order for other ores to be processed at the McClean Lake 
JEB mill, the CLJV may be required to pay a portion of the capital costs 
for such expansion; and  

(f) contemplates that the JEB Toll Milling Agreement will be amended to give 
effect to the new milling arrangement.  

For the toll milling and related services, the CLJV pays the MLJV toll milling 
charges comprising the CLJV's share of JEB mill expenses and a toll milling fee. 

The Memorandum of Agreement requires the MLJV to modify and expand the 
JEB mill to process all of the current Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  Construction 
of the expanded facility is scheduled to begin in 2012 and be completed in 2015.  
See Sections 17.3 and 18 for discussion on McClean JEB mill modifications and 
expansion.  Work relating to the optimization of the tailings management facility 
to accommodate all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves is planned to 
proceed in 2012 with completion anticipated in 2013.  See Sections 20.5 for 
discussion on the optimization of the McClean JEB mill tailings facility. 

In certain circumstances, the CLJV pays the MLJV standby costs.  With the JEB 
mill being placed in care and maintenance mode in July 2010, Cameco expects 
that the CLJV will be required to pay standby costs until production starts in 
2013.  The total expected standby costs to be paid by the CLJV is $174.6 million, 
including $68.0 million spent as of December 31, 2011.  Cameco's share of total 
standby costs is $89.6 million, which we will be expensed as incurred.  The costs 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 143 of 188 

estimates and economic modeling (Sections 21 and 22) in this technical report 
assume these costs are payable until production starts up in 2013. 

The CLJV partners are parties to a November 2011 cost confirmation and 
sharing agreement whereby Cameco and AREVA are responsible to fund capital 
costs of the initial modifications of the McClean Lake JEB mill in excess of a cap 
of $74.5 million negotiated by the CLJV partners at their proportionate share.  
The cap relating to the McClean Lake JEB mill modifications has been met.  
Cameco's share of the total initial mill modifications to the McClean Lake JEB mill 
is $44.6 million. 

The MLJV is responsible for all costs of decommissioning the JEB mill. 

Cameco believes the terms and conditions of JEB Toll Milling Agreement and 
Memorandum of Agreement are within industry norms. 

19.2.2 Agreement to Manufacture and Supply JBS Units  

Cameco has chosen to single source the manufacturing and supply of the three 
additional JBS units to a European based, global mining and tunnelling, 
equipment supplier.  The supplier has been working closely with Cameco through 
the past two decades of research, development and testing of the JBS mining 
method and associated equipment and process.  Cameco believes the terms and 
conditions of its 2011 agreement with this European equipment supplier are 
within industry norms. 

19.2.3 Uranium Sales Contracts 

Uranium Sales Contracts Portfolio 

Cameco has a long-term uranium sales contract portfolio where it commits to 
supply uranium to its customers.  This uranium is projected to come from 
Cameco's operating mines and mines under development, including Cigar Lake, 
and from Cameco's spot and long-term uranium purchase contracts.  The 
commercial terms under these contracts are confidential. 

Cameco has also entered into a number of long-term contracts for sale of Cigar 
Lake production (base-load contracts).  These base-load contracts were put in 
place to support the development of Cigar Lake after the development decision 
was made. 

A majority of Cameco's long-term uranium sales contracts contain supply 
interruption provisions which allow Cameco to reduce, defer or terminate 
deliveries in the event of any shortfall in planned production or deliveries of 
purchases under Cameco's agreement to purchase highly enriched uranium from 
JSC Techsnabexport.  Since the Cigar Lake water inflows, Cameco has been in 
discussions with its customers to address the production delay at the mine and 
its effects on uranium deliveries.  For Cigar Lake base-load contracts that had 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 144 of 188 

scheduled deliveries in 2007 through 2012, these volumes are either being 
deferred to the end of the various contracts or cancelled.  For deliveries beyond 
2012, Cameco has held discussions with customers resulting in the remaining 
volumes being deferred.  For the remainder of the contracts with supply 
interruption language provisions that have deliveries scheduled through 2012, 
Cameco has deferred a portion of the 2012 deliveries for five years. 

Impact of Uranium Sales Contracts on Cigar Lake Economic Analysis 

Uranium contract terms generally reflect market conditions when the contracts 
are negotiated.  After a contract is accepted, deliveries under a long-term 
contract do not begin for several years.  In the case of the Cigar Lake base-load 
contracts, the time period will be longer as these contracts were negotiated in 
2004 and 2005 and the first deliveries will not take place until after the 
commencement of production, which is now planned for 2013.  Cameco believes 
the terms of its long-term uranium sales contracts, including the Cigar Lake base-
load contracts, generally reflect industry norms.  

As a result of Cameco's contracting strategy and the increase in the uranium 
price over the past few years, Cameco's average realized price for uranium sales 
in 2011 was US$49.17/lb U3O8.  The industry average spot price (Trade Tech 
and UxC) during 2011 was US$56.36/lb U3O8.  The industry average long-term 
uranium price (Trade Tech and UxC) during 2011 was US$66.79/lb U3O8. 

Uranium Price Assumptions 

A spot price projection of US$59.00/lb U3O8 in 2012 increasing to US$65.00/lb 
U3O8 in 2016 onwards has been incorporated into the realized price projection for 
the purpose of the economic analysis.  The current price projection is consistent 
with various independent forecasts of supply and demand fundamentals.  To the 
extent the independent forecasts did not extend their projections to cover the 
entire expected mine life of Cigar Lake, the projections have been extrapolated 
forward to the end of the anticipated mine life.   

Cameco has historically sold U3O8 under long-term contracts with its customers, 
at prices that reflect the market conditions at the time the contract is accepted.  
Cameco has committed a significant quantity of its future production and 
purchased material to be delivered through its existing portfolio of long-term 
sales contracts.  The remaining future production will be sold under yet to be 
negotiated arrangements.  For purposes of the economic analysis, Cameco's 
portion of Cigar Lake production is assumed to be sold into a mix of committed 
volumes and uncommitted volumes in the same proportion that Cameco expects 
to sell based on its current level of committed sales relative to its total sales 
targets. 

Table 19-2 outlines the projected average realized prices, taking into account 
Cameco's current level of sales commitments and the independent spot price

projections.  The price projections are stated in constant 2012 dollars.  The 
economic analysis assumes an average realized price of $68.62/lb U3O8. 

In preparing the cash flow analysis included in Section 22 of this report, the 
impact of Cameco's forward uranium sales strategy has been taken into account.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 

20.1 Regulatory Framework 

The Cigar Lake project has regulatory obligations to both the federal and 
provincial governments.  Being a nuclear facility, primary regulatory authority 
resides with the federal government and its agency, the CNSC.  Provincial 
regulatory authority is generally described in the surface lease between the 
Province of Saskatchewan and the CLJV.  In many cases, there is coordination 
amongst the federal and provincial regulatory agencies, but each agency retains 
responsibility for administering its own regulations, approvals, licences and 
permits where required.  The main regulatory agencies that issue permits / 
approvals and inspect the Cigar Lake project are: the CNSC (federal), Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada (federal), Environment Canada (federal), Transport Canada 
(federal), Saskatchewan Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety 
(provincial), and Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (provincial).   

One of the initial steps in the regulatory process was to assess the project under 
the federal and provincial environmental assessment ("EA") processes.  

20.2 Environmental Assessment 

The Cigar Lake project that has been assessed for regulatory approval purposes, 
includes the Cigar Lake mine and associated mine site infrastructure, the 
processing of the recovered ore at the McClean Lake JEB mill, and the road 
infrastructure that connects Cigar Lake to the existing road network.  Potential 
effects from the Cigar Lake project have been evaluated as part of several 
environmental assessments going back to 1987.  All aspects of the Cigar Lake 
project have undergone the required EA and regulatory approval, to allow for the 
current licensing of the Cigar Lake mine.  In 2008, Cameco completed an 
environmental assessment process which included consideration of the 
processing of a portion of Cigar Lake uranium concentrate at the Rabbit Lake 
mill.  However, for commercial reasons Cameco has recently announced that the 
CLJV have agreed to process all Cigar Lake ore at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  
A brief summary of these assessments and approvals follows. 

In 1995, the Cigar Lake project, Environmental Impact Statement (1995 EIS) was 
submitted to the Joint Federal-Provincial review panel on Uranium Mining 
Developments in Northern Saskatchewan (the "Panel").  The 1995 EIS evaluated 
the operation of a high-grade uranium mine at Cigar Lake, producing ore over a 
40-year period, with ore being transported by truck to the nearby McClean Lake 
uranium mill for processing.  In 1997, the Panel recommended that pending 
identification of a suitable waste rock disposal location, the project should 
proceed.  The Canadian and Saskatchewan governments both accepted the 
Panel's recommendation and in 1998 both government bodies approved the 
project in principle.  



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 148 of 188 

A 1999 review of the waste rock disposal options concluded that the Sue C pit at 
McClean Lake operation was the best waste rock disposal option.  The Disposal 
of Cigar Lake Waste Rock Environmental Impact Statement (2001 EIS) was 
submitted in August 2001, under the harmonized federal-provincial 
environmental assessment process.  This 2001 EIS also assessed the future 
construction of a permanent access road to Cigar Lake site and the future 
transportation of waste rock over that access road.  In August 2003, the CNSC 
concluded that the 2001 EIS and associated documents met the requirements of 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) and that the 
licensing/permitting processes for the Sue C pit as a waste rock disposal site and 
construction of the permanent access road could proceed (Cameco EASR, 
2004).  

In January 2003, the CNSC informed Cameco that due to a perceived 
uncertainty regarding the use of the transitional provisions of CEAA, the CNSC 
would require a new environmental assessment of the Cigar Lake mine portion of 
the project to support construction and operation licence decisions.  However, 
Saskatchewan Environment (now referred to as the Saskatchewan Ministry of 
Environment) indicated that the assessment requirements under the 
Saskatchewan Environmental Assessment Act had been fully met by the 1995 
EIS and 2001 EIS submission and approval processes.   

In February 2004, Cameco submitted an environmental assessment study report 
(2004 EASR) for the Cigar Lake mine portion of the project under CEAA to meet 
the above requirement.  In the 2004 EASR, the CNSC was identified as the sole 
"Responsible Authority".  The 2004 EASR assessed the potential effects from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Cigar Lake mine.  The 2004 
EASR did not reassess the transportation of the ore to the McClean Lake JEB 
mill, milling of the ore, or the management of tailings.  The 2004 EASR was 
accepted by the CNSC as meeting the requirements of CEAA and therefore the 
licensing/permitting processes for the Cigar Lake project could proceed.  

AREVA is the operator of the McClean Lake JEB mill on behalf of the MLJV.  The 
processing of all the ore slurry from the Cigar Lake mine will be at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill.  This was assessed and approved as part of the 1995 EIS.  An 
amendment to the McClean Lake JEB mill's Licence to Operate is still required in 
order to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  
No issues surrounding this licence amendment approval are anticipated. 

The McClean Lake JEB tailings management facility (TMF) is designed to reduce 
environmental effects through operations to post-decommissioning; when a full 
soil cover will be in place.  This is achieved through the application of operational 
and mitigation controls that provide for the careful subaqueous placement of 
thickened engineered tails into a hydrodynamically contained TMF.  As the 
facility has been designed, environmentally assessed and licensed on the 
primary basis of receiving Cigar Lake ore, no material changes, if any, are 
anticipated to be required to AREVA's licence and/or provincial operating

NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 149 of 188 

approvals when in receipt of Cigar Lake ore.  AREVA has received regulatory 
approval to proceed with the work for optimization of the TMF necessary to 
receive all of the tailings from processing all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral 
Reserves.  This work is anticipated to be completed in 2013. 

In December 2008, Cameco submitted to the CNSC a project description for 
implementing measures intended to better manage the increased quantities of 
water inflow that could potentially be experienced during the construction and 
operation of the Cigar Lake project.  Specifically, this project will involve 
establishing infrastructure to allow for the discharge of treated water directly to 
Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake.  A positive decision on this screening level 
environmental assessment was received in 2011 and construction of the 
infrastructure is expected to be completed in 2012.

As previously discussed, the regulatory framework for the normal construction 
and operation of any mine site is subject to an ongoing process during which 
permits, licences and approvals are requested, reported on, amended, expire 
and are renewed.  

Based on the acceptance by the CNSC of the 2004 EASR, Cameco, in 2004, 
applied for a licence to construct the Cigar Lake mine site in two parts: 

(1) construction of the Shaft No. 2 surface complex and the freeze plant; and 

(2) construction of all other mining and support facilities at the Cigar Lake mine 
site.  

In July 2004, the CNSC approved the construction of the Shaft No. 2 surface 
complex and the freeze plant.  The CNSC issued the construction licence in 
December 2004 for a three-year term expiring in December 2007.  As a result of 
the October 2006 water inflow, the construction licence was amended in 
December 2007 to extend its term from December 31, 2007 until December 31, 
2009, so actions resulting from the 2006 inflow event could be addressed and 
mine remediation could proceed.  The licence was subsequently amended in 
June 2008 to enable Cameco to proceed with a limited scope of work including 
mine dewatering, shaft remediation and mine entry to secure/assess the 
underground workings.  In August 2008, during dewatering, a new water inflow 
source developed, leading to the decision to suspend dewatering to ensure it 
was understood and that appropriate measures to mitigate the inflow could be 
taken.  

In 2009, after plugging the new source, again from the surface, Cameco re-
initiated dewatering of the main shaft.  In addition, the CNSC licence was again 
extended to December 31, 2013 allowing for completion of the mine construction 
project, including completion of remediation, Shaft No. 2 and surface 
construction.  Additional regulatory approvals for certain licence activities, such

as the mine plan and establishment of Shaft No. 2 as a second means of egress, 
were obtained in 2011 and early January 2012, respectively, allowing for the 
complete remediation and resumption of pre-flood underground construction and 
development. 

With the 2011 acceptance of the Cigar Lake Water Inflow Management Project 
screening level environmental assessment, that allows for the direct discharge of 
treated mine water effluent to Seru Bay, approval was received to begin 
construction.  Completion and subsequent operating approvals from CNSC and 
the Province are expected in 2012.  As well, under the provincial operating 
approval, specific approvals to construct and/or operate relevant components of 
the surface infrastructure will be required. 

An amendment to the McClean Lake JEB mill's Licence to Operate is still 
required in order to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill.  No issues surrounding this licence amendment approval are 
anticipated.  AREVA has received regulatory approval to proceed with the work 
for optimization of the TMF necessary to receive all of the tailings from 
processing all of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves.  This work is anticipated 
to be completed in 2013. 

Concurrent with mine construction, which is being completed under a 
construction licence that expires at the end of 2013, an operating licence 
application will be prepared for submission to the CNSC.  The operating licence 
process is expected to consist of two formal hearings per the CNSC process.  To 
facilitate a smooth transition to operations state, the process will be initiated while 
construction of the facilities is being completed.  Any construction activities that 
might remain would be covered by the new operating licence. 

The surface facilities and mine shafts for the Cigar Lake project are located on 
lands owned by the Province of Saskatchewan.  Cameco acquired the right to 
use and occupy the lands under a surface lease agreement with the Province.  In 
2011, with the signing of the most recent surface lease agreement, the area of 
the surface lease was increased to provide for the area necessary for the 
discharge of treated effluent to Seru Bay at Waterbury Lake.  The Cigar Lake 
surface lease covers a total area of 1,042 ha of Crown land around the Cigar 
Lake site and stipulates various provisions and conditions for the use of this land.  
Cameco is compliant with the terms and provisions in the surface lease 
agreement.   

20.4 Water Treatment and Effluent Discharge 

The water treatment/effluent discharge system employed at the Cigar Lake mine 
site has been designed based both on the results of metallurgical test work 
programs and Cameco's experience at other facilities.  The design is intended for 
both typical and emergency water treatment and effluent discharge scenarios.  
The current system, as described below, is approved and licensed by the CNSC 
and Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (SMOE). 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Retained surface water and recovered groundwater from the mine are pumped to 
the water treatment plant (WTP).  The WTP uses a two-stage treatment process.  
Both stages involve chemical addition, precipitation and filtration.  

Under normal operating conditions, treated water from the WTP is designed to be 
discharged to the environment on a batch discharge basis.  As per the design, 
treated water from the WTP is discharged to one of four lined ponds.  The water 
in these ponds is tested prior to release to the environment.  All water that fails to 
meet licence/operating approval requirements is returned to the WTP for re-
treatment.  Two ponds are included in the WTP design to allow for the safe 
storage of excess water.  Through the construction period of the project, where 
mine water volumes and contaminant loadings are low, to help improve the 
management of potential ice build-up in the ponds, approvals are in place to 
allow for continuous discharge during winter months. 

The WTP is designed to be able to treat water up to 550 m3/h; however, normal 
operating conditions are expected to average up to 135 m3/h.  The treatment is 
complimented with additional surface storage capacity of approximately 
100,000 m3.  In addition, to ensure all water is treated prior to discharge, 
contingency treatment capacity can be activated to match the planned pumping 
capacity of the mine. 

As a result of the October 2006 and August 2008 water inflow incidents, Cameco 
reviewed the emergency mine dewatering strategy.  It was determined that one 
of the safest ways to mitigate the impact of potential future mine inflows is to 
increase the mine's dewatering capacity.  Doing so requires an enhancement to 
the mine's ability to treat and release treated effluent to the environment.  
Cameco therefore re-evaluated options to address potential mine effluent 
discharge restrictions in the event of any future inflow scenarios.  Specifically, the 
risk of erosion in the Aline Creek system was evaluated.  In December 2008, an 
application was made to move the discharge point and to discharge treated 
effluent directly to Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake.  This is where the Aline Creek 
system currently enters Waterbury Lake.  This application triggered under CEAA 
a joint federal/provincial screening level environmental assessment, which was 
accepted in 2011, after which approval to proceed with construction was 
received.  Interim approvals and measures are in place to support increased 
environmental discharges of up to 1,100 m3/h to the Aline Creek system if the 
need were to arise prior to the Seru Bay discharge point being operational.  

Cameco believes that it has sufficient capacity to handle an estimated maximum 
inflow and, as noted in this report, has installed additional capacity to assure the 
long-term success for the project.  

For a further discussion on the mine water management, see Section 16.2.9. 

In respect of the McClean Lake JEB mill, all water must be treated before it is 
released to the environment.  All water that fails to meet licensing/operating 
approval requirements is returned to the water treatment plant for re-treatment.

20.5 Ore Processing and Tailings 

The McClean Lake JEB mill will process the Cigar Lake ore slurry in a dedicated 
leach circuit separate from other ores that may be concurrently processed in the 
McClean Lake JEB mill.  The combined residue from both ores will be treated in 
the upgraded McClean Lake mill tailings neutralisation area.  Neutralised tailings 
will be pumped to the existing TMF (See Sections 17.2 and 17.4).  Work relating 
to the optimization of the TMF to accommodate tailings from the processing of all 
of Cigar Lake's current Mineral Reserves is planned to proceed in 2012 and be 
completed by 2013. 

During the processing of Cigar Lake ore, ore tailings will be generated at the 
McClean Lake JEB mill.  The JEB Toll Milling Agreement manages the financial 
liabilities associated with these tailings.  For discussion of the JEB Toll Milling 
Agreement, refer to Section 19.2.1. 

20.6 Waste Rock 

Waste rock generated at the Cigar Lake mine site is currently stored on-site in 
one of four waste rock piles, depending on the nature of the waste rock.  The first 
two of these are the clean waste stockpiles, which will remain at the mine site.  
The third is mineralized waste (>0.03% U3O8), contained on a lined pad, which is 
planned to be disposed of underground at the Cigar Lake mine.  No mineralized 
waste has been identified in the development to date.  The fourth is potentially 
acid generating waste rock which will be temporarily stored at site on a lined pad 
and will be eventually transported to the Sue C pit at the McClean Lake facility for 
permanent disposal.  The costs of the eventual disposal of Cigar Lake's 
potentially acid generating waste rock in Sue C pit, as described in the Waste 
Rock EIS noted above, is covered by the Potentially Reactive Waste Rock 
Disposal Agreement between the MLJV and CLJV dated January 1, 2002.  The 
cost of this disposal is included in the Cigar Lake mine operating cost estimate. 

20.7 Reclamation / Remediation 

The Cigar Lake project Preliminary Decommissioning Plan (PDP) was initially 
completed in May 2002 and was most recently revised as part of the licensing 
that occurred in 2008.  This preliminary decommissioning plan considers the 
environmental liabilities up to the end of the construction of the facility.  This PDP 
was approved by both federal and provincial regulatory agencies and is 
supported by a financial assurance based on a preliminary decommissioning cost 
estimate (PDCE) of $27.7 million.  The financial assurance is posted with 
Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment.  

As part of the operating licence application, Cameco will need to review the PDP 
and account for changes to the reclamation and remediation liabilities associated 
with the management of the ore and any associated wastes.  The PDCE will also 
be reviewed and if required revised to reflect any changes in the PDP.  The Cigar 
Lake PDP discusses the approach to addressing the liabilities that are

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 153 of 188 

associated with mining.  The future liabilities will be addressed in subsequent 
revisions to the Cigar Lake PDP. 

The reclamation and remediation activities associated with the Cigar Lake project 
waste rock and/or tailings disposal at the McClean Lake facility are covered by 
the PDP and PDCE prepared for these facilities.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 

21.1 Project Construction Status – December 31, 2011 

Pre-construction activities were started at Cigar Lake in 2002 with full 
construction activities commencing in January 2005.  The 2006 and 2008 water 
inflows resulted in a suspension of construction activities.  With the mine fully 
secured, the underground rehabilitation program complete and regulatory 
requirements met, Cameco has resumed underground construction activities.  
Underground development required for the start of production is estimated at 
70% complete, based on required infrastructure changes identified in the 
updated mine plan.  Surface construction is estimated to be 56% complete.  The 
infrastructure completed to date is described in Section 18. 

The historical costs reflect costs since 2004, including remediation costs to date 
as well as the completed facilities to date.  Historical costs and current 
commitments also include costs for partially completed facilities, including Shaft 
No. 2 and underground development and freezehole drilling.  

The cost estimate to complete underground development and surface facilities at 
the Cigar Lake site for the years 2012 and 2013 will consist of: 

• Mine development and freezehole drilling which include the costs to complete 
the underground development and freezehole drilling as well as the surface 
freezehole drilling;  

• Site services, which include the support costs for site administration, licences 
and taxes, commuting and camp operating costs, electricity and fuel costs, 
warehousing, as well as engineering and construction management;  

• Updated mine plan scope additions which include expanded sumps, new 
high pressure pump room, underground shop facilities, electrical rooms; 

• Completion of the Shaft No. 2, which includes the costs to excavate, install a 
hydrostatic liner, and furnish the shaft; 

• Completion of the underground mine infrastructure capital, which includes the 
brine system freezing infrastructure, the underground ore extraction system 
(jet boring), the ore processing circuit, and water handling; and 

• Completion of the remaining surface facilities, which includes the new 
administration/services building, the installation of the surface ore process 
facilities, new propane tank farm and the permanent employee residence 
expansion.

The McClean Lake JEB mill was modified from 2005 to 2007 in order to receive 
and process the Cigar Lake ore.  As a result of the new toll mining arrangement, 
the McClean Lake JEB mill will need to be expanded to process all of the current 
Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  The McClean Lake infrastructure to be completed 
is described in Section 18 and the JEB Toll Mining Agreement is described in 
Section 19.2.1. 

21.2 Capital and Other Costs 

In 2010, Cameco released the 2010 Technical Report showing expected capital 
and remediation costs to the end of construction of approximately $2.0 billion.  
Since that time, the total project cost has escalated to approximately $2.6 billion 
due to a number of factors. The majority of the cost increase is the result of 
increased costs at the Cigar Lake mine site construction for surface freeze 
implementation, general cost escalation and costs to upgrade and expand the 
McClean Lake JEB mill.  The cost estimates in this paragraph are on a 100% 
basis. 

The remaining capital cost estimate as of December 31, 2011 for the Cigar Lake 
project is summarized in Table 21-1.  The majority of the expenditures in the 
mine, plant and mill are for development, construction and equipment in order to 
achieve the required production.  The capital and other cost projections are 
stated in constant 2012 dollars.

As shown in Table 21-1 the remaining capital costs, as of December 31, 2011, 
for the Cigar Lake Project are estimated to be $857.3 million, including $701.4 
million to complete underground development, underground construction and 
surface construction at Cigar Lake and $155.9 million to complete the mill 
modifications at McClean Lake. Mill modifications at Rabbit Lake are no longer 
required due to the Memorandum of Agreement.  Standby costs at the McCLean 
Lake JEB mill are expected to be $106.6 million, for a total remaining cost of 
$963.9 million for the Cigar Lake project. Table 21-1 also includes projected 
sustaining capital expenditures of $377.0 million that the CLJV will be required to 
fund throughout the operating life of the Cigar Lake mine.  The cost estimates in 
this paragraph are on a 100% basis. 

Cameco's share of the remaining capital and other costs to complete the Cigar 
Lake project is $483.6 million, including $428.9 million of capital costs and $54.7 
million of standby costs.  Including the $675.3 million spent by Cameco on 
construction costs and mill modification costs prior to December 31, 2011, 
Cameco's share of the aggregate capital cost is now estimated to be $1.1 billion 
($192 million over the 2010 Technical Report).  In addition, Cameco's share of 
the projected sustaining capital expenditures is $188.6 million.  

Under the terms of the JEB Toll Milling Agreement, the CLJV partners are 
responsible for the payment of standby costs to the MLJV under certain 
conditions.  AREVA shut down the McClean Lake JEB mill in July 2010, at which 
time, the CLJV began paying the standby costs.  These costs are expected to 
continue until production start up in 2013.  The total expected cost of standby 
costs to be paid by the CLJV partners is $174.6 million.  Cameco's share is  
$89.6 million, which will be expensed as incurred. 

Cameco's share of the aggregate remediation cost at Cigar Lake which was 
spent and expensed beginning in 2006 is estimated to be $86.4 million.  Cameco 
has expensed its share of the remediation costs as they  were incurred.  More 
specifically, the costs that were expensed related to contractor costs that were 
directly engaged in, or provided support to, the remediation efforts, and any 
cancellation or retention costs that were required as a result of the water inflow.  
As of December 31, 2011, remediation activities are complete. 

CLJV's aggregate capital cost for Cigar Lake construction, including construction 
costs prior to December 31, 2011 of $1.3 billion, is estimated to be approximately 
$2.2 billion. Total remediation costs for the CLJV are in addition to the capital 
cost and are $182.2 million.  Standby costs will add an additional $174.6 million 
to the total costs. The combined capital and other costs for the Cigar Lake project 
are now estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion for the CLJV. The cost 
estimates in this paragraph are on a 100% basis. 

The major components of the revised cost estimates, including Cameco's share, 
are detailed in Table 21-2.

Note : Cameco is responsible for a 50% share of certain JEB Mill modifications in excess of the negotiated cap 
and for standby costs above 80% of fixed costs.   

Rabbit Lake mill modifications were made during the period 2004-2009 to 
prepare the mill to accept Cigar Lake ore.  Under the new Memorandum of 
Agreement, the Rabbit Lake Toll Milling Agreement has been terminated, and 
100% of Cigar Lake ores are committed to the JEB mill.  No further costs will be 
incurred at Rabbit Lake. 

Under the terms of a November 2011 cost confirmation and sharing agreement 
between the CLJV partners described in Section 19.2.1, Cameco and AREVA 
are responsible to fund capital costs of the initial modifications of the McClean 
Lake JEB mill in excess of a cap of $74.5 million negotiated by the CLJV partners 
at their proportionate share.  The cap relating to the McClean Lake JEB mill 
modifications has been met.  Cameco has funded its proportionate share of the 
costs. These costs have been included in the economic analysis.  

21.3 Operating Cost Estimates 

Estimated operating expenditures for the underground mining operation and for 
toll milling charges and fees are presented in Table 21-3. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 159 of 188 

Operating costs consist of annual expenditures at Cigar Lake, after the 
commencement of production in 2013, to mine the ore, treat the ore 
underground, including crushing, grinding and density control, followed by 
pumping the resulting slurry to surface for transportation to McClean Lake. 

Operating costs at McClean Lake consist of the cost of leaching 100% of the 
Cigar Lake ore slurry into uranium solution and further processing into 
yellowcake.   

To the extent that the McClean Lake JEB mill is co-processing ore from other 
mine sites, the toll milling agreement has provisions addressing the sharing of 
operating costs with the CLJV. 

Operating costs for the Cigar Lake project, as a whole, are expected to average 
approximately $18.57/lb U3O8 over the life of the Cigar Lake project.  The 2010 
Technical Report showed expected operating costs to average $23.14/lb U3O8 
over the life of the Cigar Lake project.  The decrease in  operating costs is 
primarily due to the agreement to mill all of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves at 
the McClean Lake JEB mill.  The operating cost projections are stated in 
constant 2012 dollars and assume the throughput outlined in the production 
schedule in Section 16.3.5. 

Cameco plans to begin commissioning in ore in mid-2013, with the first pounds to 
be packaged at the McClean Lake mill in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Costs 
incurred during the commissioning phase will be capitalized as pre-operating 
costs until commercial production is achieved.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Economic Analysis 

The following economic analysis as shown in Table 22-1 for the Cigar Lake 
project is based on the current mine plan which contemplates the mining and 
milling of all of the current Mineral Reserves.  The analysis does not contain any 
estimates involving the potential mining and milling of Mineral Resources.  
Expenditures required to bring any of the Mineral Resources into production or to 
identify additional Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, have not been 
included. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves have no 
demonstrated economic viability. 

The analysis provided is from the point of view of Cameco, which owns 50.025% 
of the CLJV, and incorporates Cameco's projected sales revenue from its 
proportionate share of the related production, less its share of the related 
operating and capital costs of the CLJV, as well as all royalties and resource 
surcharges that will be payable on the sale of the concentrates.

Page 163 of 188 

The economic analysis results in an estimated pre-tax NPV (at a discount rate of 
8%) to Cameco, for net cash flows from January 1, 2012 forward, of $1.4 billion 
for its share of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves. The pre-tax IRR, also 
calculated from January 1, 2012, is estimated to be 32.8%. 

22.2 Sensitivities 

The graph in Figure 22-1 illustrates the project's sensitivity to changes in uranium 
grade, capital cost, operating cost, and uranium prices (including the mitigating 
effects of Cameco's level of committed sales through its sales contract portfolio). 
The graph illustrates the variability around the base case pre-tax net present 
value of $1.4 billion using sensitivities of plus and minus 10% on all variables. 
For uranium price, the high and low cases represent a plus or minus 10% 
deviation from the average spot price projections incorporated in the base case 
realized prices as shown in Table 19.2. 

Figure 22-1: Cigar Lake Project Sensitivity Analysis 

 

The Cigar Lake project shows relatively low sensitivity to changes in its operating 
or capital cost projections.  The relative sensitivity to changes in uranium price 
and ore grade realized is significantly higher due in part to the relatively high-
grade nature of the deposit and the price estimates being used, which are a 
reflection of the current U3O8 market environment.

22.3 Payback 

Payback for the Cigar Lake project can be considered on many different factors. 

Payback for Cameco, excluding all 2011 and prior costs as sunk costs, would be 
achieved during 2017 on an undiscounted, pre-tax basis. 

If the $1.6 billion, including remediation costs, spent on Cigar Lake construction 
prior to 2012, (Cameco share equal to $796 million) were included in the 
calculation, Cameco would achieve payback during 2019 on an undiscounted, 
pre-tax basis.   

22.4 Mine Life 

The Cigar Lake project is based on the current Mineral Reserves that will 
produce 213.5 million mill recovered pounds of U3O8.  The expected life of 
current estimated Mineral Reserves is approximately 15 years of sustained 
production based on the planned annual production of approximately 18 million 
pounds of U3O8.  Cigar Lake will produce less than the full annual production in 
the early and late years of the Mineral Reserve life. 

If the Mineral Resources are upgraded and then converted to Mineral Reserves 
through a positive feasibility study, this could extend the mine life.  It cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of the Inferred Mineral Resources at Cigar Lake will 
ever be upgraded to a higher category.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral 
Reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. 

22.5 Taxes 

The Cigar Lake project operates as an unincorporated joint venture and is 
therefore not subject to direct income taxation at the joint venture level.  Cameco, 
as the mine operator, operates the mine on behalf of the CLJV and distributes 
the resulting U3O8 production to the CLJV partners in proportion to their joint 
venture interests.  

Cameco is subject to federal and provincial (Saskatchewan and Ontario) income 
tax in Canada.  Royalties are fully deductible for income tax purposes.  For 
Ontario tax purposes, an additional tax is charged (at normal Ontario corporate 
tax rates) if the royalty deduction exceeds a notional Ontario resource allowance.   

Cameco is no longer subject to capital taxes on paid-up capital (as defined for 
capital tax purposes in the relevant provincial legislation) in respect of its 
Canadian operations.  These taxes have been eliminated.  As a resource 
corporation in Saskatchewan, Cameco pays a corporate resource surcharge of 
3.0% of the value of resource sales.  Table 22-2 below sets out the expected 
royalties and annual resource surcharge that will be incurred by Cameco on its 
share of production from Cigar Lake.  The projected royalties and annual 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 165 of 188 

resource surcharge are based on the realized prices set out in Table 19-2 and 
are quoted in constant 2012 dollars.  

For the purposes of the economic analysis, the projected impact of income taxes 
has been excluded due to the nature of the required calculations.  Taxable 
income for Cameco is comprised of results from several discrete operations, 
which are combined to determine Cameco's taxable income and its related tax 
liabilities.  It is not practical to allocate a resulting income tax cost to Cameco's 
portion of Cigar Lake, as Cameco's tax expense is a function of several 
variables, most of which are independent of the investment in Cigar Lake.  
However, the projected future impact of the Saskatchewan corporate resource 
surcharge is included in the economic analysis.  

22.6 Royalties 

Cameco pays royalties to the Province of Saskatchewan on the sale of uranium 
extracted from ore bodies within the province under the terms of Part III of the 
Crown Mineral Royalty Schedule, 1986 (Saskatchewan) (the "Schedule"), as 
amended.  The Schedule provides for the calculation and payment of both a 
basic royalty and a tiered royalty.  The basic royalty is equal to 5% of gross sales 
of uranium and is reduced by the Saskatchewan resource credit, which is equal 
to 1% of the gross sales of uranium.   

The tiered royalty is an additional levy on the gross sales of uranium, which 
applies only when the sales price of uranium exceeds levels prescribed by the 
Schedule.  Uranium sales subject to the tiered royalty are first reduced by capital 
allowances, as permitted by the Schedule, for new mine or mill construction and 
certain mill expansion.  Additions of capital allowances for new mines and mills 
are determined using amounts prescribed by the Schedule based on the design 
capacity of the new facility, and not on the actual construction costs.  The 
aggregate of the allowances, less any allowance deductions, determines the 
balance in the capital recovery bank (CRB).  When the allowable annual 
deduction from the CRB is fully maximized or the CRB is reduced to zero, tiered 
royalties become payable.  Both the sales prices at which the tiered royalties 
become payable and the CRB, as defined in the Schedule, are adjusted annually 
to reflect changes in the Canadian gross domestic product. 

The tiered royalty is calculated on the positive difference between the sales price 
per pound of U3O8 and the prescribed prices according to the following: 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 166 of 188 

Tiered  Canadian dollar ($/lb U3O8) 
Royalty rate      Sales price in excess of: 

6% $18.05 

Plus 4% $27.07 

Plus 5% $36.09 
 

The above sales prices are applicable to 2011 and are in Canadian dollars.  For 
example, if the sales price realized by Cameco was $40 per pound in Canadian 
dollars, the tiered royalty payable would be calculated as follows (assuming all 
capital allowances have been reduced to zero): 

[6% x ($40.00 – $18.05) x pounds sold] + [4% x ($40.00 – 
$27.07) x pounds sold] + [5% x ($40.00 - $36.09) x pounds sold]  

= $2.03 per pound sold 

In 2007, Cameco's CRB was fully claimed and therefore Cameco was subject to 
tiered royalties starting in that year.  Cameco will be eligible for additional capital 
allowances, as permitted by the Schedule, once Cigar Lake commences 
production.  As a result, Cameco expects that the payment of tiered royalties 
relating to Cigar Lake will not be required until 2015.   

Table 22-2 below sets out the expected royalties and annual resource surcharge 
that will be incurred by Cameco on its share of production from Cigar Lake.  The 
projected royalties and annual resource surcharges are based on the realized 
prices set out in Table 19-2 and are quoted in constant 2012 dollars.   

The economic analysis for tiered royalties has been done on an incremental 
basis, and assumes that the capital bank additions to the CRB would only be 
used to offset the tiered royalties otherwise payable on Cameco's share of Cigar 
Lake production.  In reality, the CRB will be available to shelter tiered royalties 
payable on all of Cameco's Canadian production centers, including Cigar Lake.  
As a result, the CRB will be exhausted in an accelerated fashion by the use of 
higher deductions in 2013 and 2014 to offset tiered royalties payable by Cameco 
from all of its Canadian production centers.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Cigar Lake Water Inflow Incidents 

Over the period, 2006 through 2008, the project suffered several setbacks as a 
result of three water inflow incidents. 

The first occurred in April of 2006 resulting in the flooding of the then partially 
completed Shaft No. 2.  The two subsequent incidents involved inflows in the 
mine workings connected to Shaft No. 1 and resulted in flooding of the mine 
workings completed to that point in time.   

Cameco developed and successfully executed recovery and remediation plans 
for both the Shaft No. 2 inflow and the 2 inflows experienced in Shaft No. 1 
workings.  This culminated in the resumption of sinking of Shaft No. 2 in the first 
half of 2011 and the successful break through to the 480 m level of the main 
mine workings in early 2012 and the commencement and completion of 
underground remediation and restoration of the Shaft No. 1 workings in 2010 and 
2011. 

The detailed phased remediation plan and its associated activities were 
described in the 2007 Technical Report and updated in the 2010 Technical 
Report. 

24.2 Mine Inflow Remediation and Construction 

Through 2010 and 2011, Cameco developed a comprehensive plan and 
successfully proceeded with remediation to restore the underground workings at 
Cigar Lake.  The key aspects of that plan are described below. 

Securing the Mine 

This involved inspecting the mine and completing any additional remedial work to 
protect it from an inflow or significant ground failure (for example, determining if 
additional reinforcement was required in higher risk areas).  The work to secure 
the mine was  completed in 2011. 

Underground Rehabilitation Program 

With successful re-entry to the main mine workings achieved in early 2010, a 
comprehensive underground rehabilitation program was implemented through 
the period since the 2010 Technical Report.  The program of work involved 
rehabilitating the remaining lower risk areas of the mine (including the 480 and 
500 m levels) and re-establishing the full mine ventilation circuit.  Some of the 
specific tasks included: 

• re-establishing the permanent refuge stations and communications;

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012

• installation of the emergency backup pumping capacity; 

• re-establishing the orebody freezing program; 

• commencing the Shaft No. 2 freezing program; 

• preparing areas to resume construction/development activities; and 

• replacing electrical components and equipment damaged due to flooding. 

As part of securing the mine and underground rehabilitation program, detailed 
assessments of the underground conditions were completed which provided 
further input to the overall Cigar Lake design and strategy, allowing the mine plan 
to be further optimized. 

Resumption of Construction Activities – Pre-Inflow 

With the mine fully secured, the underground rehabilitation program complete 
and regulatory requirements met, Cameco resumed underground construction 
activities in 2011 that had been interrupted by the October 2006 water inflow. 

24.3 Shaft No. 2 Inflow Remediation and Construction 

Cameco completed the dewatering of Shaft No. 2 in April 2009 and remediation 
was completed in May 2009.  The freezing infrastructure to support the 
completion of shaft sinking was completed in early 2011 and the freeze system 
activated.  Shaft sinking resumed in the first half of 2011 and by early 2012, 
Cameco had achieved breakthrough to the 480 m level and sinking to completion 
(the 500 m level) continues. The breakthrough to the 480 m level provided for a 
second means of egress for the mine and for future increases in ventilation. 

In 2011, a hydrostatic liner was installed in the shaft from the 368 m depth to the 
480 m level, where it will transition back to a non-hydrostatic liner.  

Cameco plans to complete Shaft No. 2 by the second quarter of 2013, taking the 
following steps: 

• sinking the shaft from the current shaft bottom depth of 480 m to its final 
depth of 500 m – to be completed in 2012;  

• establishing a shaft station at the 480 m level; 

• installing shaft furnishings including construction of a concrete ventilation 
partition, installation of electrical cable, water services, ore slurry pipes and 
permanent service cage facilities; and  

• commissioning of the shaft systems.

24.4 Implications and Learning 

Throughout the entire water inflow remediation and rehabilitation, that 
successfully addressed all three incidents, Cameco identified and incorporated 
the lessons learned into all facets of the project.  This was specifically done to 
ensure the implications not only to short-term project design, construction and 
startup were understood and addressed, but also to ensure that any lessons 
which are necessary to ensure the long-term success of operations were 
identified, where possible, and incorporated.  These lessons included changes to 
the water management strategy, mine design, operational procedures and work 
management, project and operational leadership.  

24.5 Preparation for Operations 

In parallel to the extensive project work in place to design, construct and 
commission the Cigar Lake project, the preparation for operational startup, 
production rampup and long-term sustainable operations is fully underway.  The 
key operations team is in place at Cigar Lake and working diligently to refine and 
execute the operations implementation plan. The team is made up of 
experienced Cameco personnel many of whom have worked at the Cigar Lake 
project and supported the successful remediation and rehabilitation of the mine.  
The team has also been strengthened by Cameco through the addition of both 
technical and operational personnel sourced from other areas of the mining and 
resource industry. 

The operational implementation plan is a comprehensive plan, led by Cameco's 
Cigar Lake General Manager.  It spans all aspects of the operation necessary to 
be in place from management systems, organization, resourcing and training of 
personnel, equipment operation and reliability systems, production planning and 
logistics management through to budget management. 

A key component of the operational implementation plan is to assure the 
successful implementation of the jet boring system. 

24.6 Project Risks 

Cigar Lake is a challenging deposit to develop and mine.  These challenges 
include control of ground water, weak rock formations, radiation protection, water 
inflow, mining method uncertainty, relatively thin flat lying mineralization and 
other mining-related challenges.  The sandstone overlying the basement rock 
contains large volumes of water at significant pressure.  Cameco is undertaking a 
number of initiatives to mitigate the project risks associated with mining the Cigar 
Lake deposit and to mine the deposit in a safe and economic manner including, 
but not limited to using the jet boring mining method, freezing of the orebody and 
surrounding ground, lowering the production horizon and increasing mine 
dewatering capacity.  Cameco applies its operational experience and the lessons 
it has learned about water inflows at McArthur River and Cigar Lake to reduce 
risk. 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 172 of 188 

Freezing the orebody and the surrounding ground is expected to result in several 
enhancements to the ground conditions, including: (1) minimizing the risk of 
water inflows from saturated rock above the unconformity; (2) reducing radiation 
exposure from radon dissolved in the ground water; and (3) increasing rock 
stability.  However, freezing will only reduce, not eliminate, these challenges. 

A significant risk to development and production is from water inflows.  Despite 
the significant mitigation Cameco has put in place, including the incorporation of 
the learnings from the three inflows, there remains a possibility of a water inflow 
during the drilling of holes to freeze the ground, mine development and JBS 
mining.  The consequences of another water inflow will depend upon the 
magnitude, location and timing of any such event, but could include a significant 
delay in Cigar Lake's development or production, a material increase in costs, a 
loss of Mineral Reserves or require Cameco to give notice to many of its 
customers that it is declaring an interruption in planned uranium supply.  Such 
consequences could have a material adverse impact on Cameco.  Water inflows 
are generally not insurable. 

Cigar Lake's construction and production schedules are based upon certain 
assumptions including assumptions about the condition of the underground 
infrastructure at the mine.  At the time of issuance of the 2010 Technical Report, 
re-entry to the 480 m levels had been established; however, the assessment of 
its condition was not completed until after the mine was secure.  Cameco 
successfully secured the mine in 2010 and 2011 and conducted a thorough 
assessment of the underground conditions.  The results were used to update the 
project plan and the evolution of the mine plan.  Overall the conditions were 
found to be generally as expected.  

The recovery of the flooded mine after the second mine inflow (2008) and the 
assessment of the 420 m level with respect to geotechnical and hydrostatic 
conditions, and associated risk, led Cameco to conclude that this level should be 
eliminated from any future mine plan.  Actions to seal the level and backfill the 
420 m level workings were put in place and successfully completed. 

The assessment of the 465 m level with respect to geotechnical and hydrostatic 
conditions, and associated risk, led Cameco to conclude that any re-entry to the 
465 m level, a level already eliminated from any future mine plan, was not 
appropriate from a risk perspective and actions to seal the level and backfill the 
465 m level workings were immediately put in place and successfully completed.  
As development takes place on the 480 and 500 m levels, it is expected that 
localized areas of poor ground conditions may potentially be encountered which 
require modifications to the mine plan and project development schedules. 

Cameco has noted a risk associated with the spalling and cracking of the tunnel 
segments in a short section of one of the crosscuts that were excavated in 1999. 
Cameco has taken steps to halt the deterioration and reinforced the affected 
area.  Cameco notes that dispositioning of its third party geotechnical 
consultants' recommendations may result in the need to make minor revisions to 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 173 of 188 

modify the life-of-mine plan or segment design to ensure the portion of Mineral 
Reserves to be mined in this tunnel section are not negatively impacted. 

The JBS mining method is new to the uranium mining industry and was 
developed and adapted specifically for the Cigar Lake deposit.  Although 
Cameco has successfully demonstrated the JBS mining method in trials, this 
method has not been proven at full production.  Test mining trials have been 
completed on a limited number of cavities that may not be representative of the 
deposit as a whole.  As Cameco ramps up production, there may be some 
technical challenges, which could affect Cameco's production plans, including, 
but not limited to variable or unanticipated ground conditions, ground movement 
and cave ins, water inflows and variable dilution, recovery values and mining 
productivity.  Even though enhancements have been made to the design of the 
JBS unit, there is a risk that the Cigar Lake project rampup to an annual 
production rate of approximately 18 million pounds U3O8 may take longer than 
planned.  In addition, there is a risk that the Cigar Lake project may not be able 
to achieve the annual planned production rate of approximately 18 million pounds 
U3O8 on a sustained and consistent basis.   

Despite the risks associated with this new mining method, Cameco continues to 
believe that the choice of the JBS mining method is prudent and practical.  
Cameco is confident that it will be able to solve challenges that may arise, but a 
failure to do so would have a significant impact on Cameco's business.  A 
comprehensive JBS testing, pre-commissioning, commissioning and startup plan 
has been implemented to assure successful startup and ongoing operations. 

The Cigar Lake mine plan requires four JBS units.  Cameco currently has one 
unit and in 2011 agreed to purchase three additional units.  Cameco has chosen 
to single source the manufacturing and supply of the JBS units to a European 
based, global mining and tunnelling, equipment supplier.  The supplier has been 
working closely with Cameco through the past two decades of research, 
development and testing of the JBS mining method and associated equipment 
and process.  There is a risk that rampup to full production at Cigar Lake may 
take longer than planned if the manufacture or delivery of these three additional 
JBS units does not take place as scheduled.  As part of Cameco's startup plan 
noted above, Cameco is working with its supplier to assure timely delivery of 
these units. 

The designed mine ventilation volume of 240 m3/s is anticipated to provide 
sufficient airflow through the mine for use of diesel equipment and radiation 
protection at a sustained production rate of approximately 18 million pounds 
U3O8 per year.  Should this volume of air prove inadequate for radiation 
protection at the designed production rate, the rate of production would be 
negatively impacted without additional capital expenditure to increase the 
ventilation throughput. 

Metallurgical test work has been used to design the McClean Lake JEB mill 
circuits relevant to Cigar Lake ore and associated modifications.  Samples used 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 174 of 188 

for metallurgical test work may not be representative of the deposit as a whole.  It 
has been recommended that an ongoing sampling and metallurgical test work 
campaign be implemented to verify the consistency of recoveries at the McClean 
Lake JEB mill and to address the potential impacts of ore variability on the mill 
design and operation.  If the test results show significant variation from the mill 
design criteria, this could impact operating costs and mill throughput. 

Under the Memorandum of Agreement, the MLJV is required to further modify 
and expand the McClean Lake JEB mill to process and package all of Cigar 
Lake's current Mineral Reserves and the CLJV has agreed to pay for the capital 
costs to do so.  Construction of the expanded facility is scheduled to begin in 
2012 and be completed in 2015.  Failure to complete construction of the 
expanded facility as planned could impact planned production. 

Section 21 of this report contains estimates of capital and other costs, including 
the capital costs associated with the modification and expansion of the McClean 
Lake JEB mill.  Actual costs may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons and 
there can be no assurance that cost estimates included in this report will be 
achieved. 

Construction and production schedules could be impacted by regulatory 
approvals.  Cameco has received from the CNSC a construction licence, which 
expires December 31, 2013, allowing for completion of the mine remediation 
plan, Shaft No. 2 and surface and underground construction.  As a condition of 
the licence, certain activities require regulatory approval.  Concurrent with the 
completion of the mine construction, an operating licence application will be 
prepared for submission to the CNSC.  An amendment to the McClean Lake JEB 
mill's Licence to Operate is still required in order to process ore from Cigar Lake 
at the McClean Lake JEB mill.  Delay in receiving regulatory approvals could 
impact the planned commencement of production in 2013.  To date there have 
been no regulatory delays; however, the transition from construction to 
operations entails a series of regulatory approvals, including the intricacies of 
testing, commissioning and start up. 

Working with the regulatory authorities to receive approvals for the actual 
execution of the work, including any changes related to the implementation of the 
revised mine plan, e.g. process infrastructure changes, may impact the 
production schedule and cost estimates. 

The completion of engineering and construction and the startup of production at 
the Cigar Lake mine and the re-start of the McClean Lake JEB mill, is taking 
place in an environment of significant competition for resources.  For example, in 
Western Canada, the northern development of Alberta oil sands combined with 
the growth in multiple aspects of Saskatchewan's economy, e.g. potash, have 
increased the risk of a shortage of personnel.  People are core to Cameco's 
business.  A shortage of personnel or an inability to acquire key construction and 
operational resources could result in delays to the construction schedule and the 
ability to successfully ramp up production.

The acceleration in the western Canadian economy can also introduce the risk of 
price increases for contractor and materials/supplies.  An increase in prices for 
contractor and materials/suppliers could cause capital cost estimates to vary 
from those capital estimates referenced in Section 21 of this report.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Cigar Lake project outlined in this report represents a significant economic 
source of feed material for the McClean Lake JEB mill.  With an estimated 
operating mine life of 15 years, Cigar Lake is expected to produce an estimated 
213 million pounds of U3O8.  At the forecast average realized uranium price over 
this 15 year period, it is estimated that Cameco will receive substantial positive 
net cash flows from its share of Cigar Lake production. 

The economic analysis results in an estimated pre-tax NPV (at a discount rate of 
8%) to Cameco, for net cash flows January 1, 2012 forward, of $1.4 billion for its 
share of the Cigar Lake Mineral Reserves.  The pre-tax IRR, also calculated from 
January 1, 2012, is estimated to be 32.8%.  A sensitivity analysis of the Cigar 
Lake project economics demonstrates that the project generates positive cash 
flows in various scenarios, including assumptions of higher costs, lower 
revenues, or lower ore grades.   

The aggregate capital and other costs for construction spent by the CLJV, 
including costs prior to December 31, 2011 of $1.6 billion, is estimated to be 
approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $523.9 million over the cost estimate 
disclosed in the 2010 Technical Report.  The cost increase is primarily the result 
of the implementation of the surface freeze strategy, general cost escalation, cost 
to upgrade and expand the McClean Lake mill and improvements to the mine 
plan.  Despite these increases to the project cost, the economics for the project 
remains positive. 

Cameco's share of the remaining capital and other costs to complete the Cigar 
Lake project is $483.6 million, including $428.9 million of capital costs and $54.7 
million of standby costs.  Including the $675.3 million spent by Cameco on 
construction costs and mill modification costs prior to December 31, 2011, 
Cameco's share of the aggregate capital cost is now estimated to be $1.1 billion 
($192 million over the 2010 Technical Report).  In addition, Cameco's share of 
the projected sustaining capital expenditures is $188.6 million.  

The Cigar Lake project shows relatively low sensitivity to changes in its operating 
or capital cost projections.  The relative sensitivity to changes in uranium price 
and ore grade realized is significantly higher due in part to the relatively high-
grade nature of the deposit and the price estimates being used, which are a 
reflection of the current U3O8 market environment.  

The development and construction of the project has been interrupted by two 
major water inflow incidents in 2006 and one major water inflow in 2008 that 
resulted in the flooding of the partially completed Shaft No. 2 and the 
underground workings.  These incidents stopped all underground excavation and 
construction activities.  Despite these setbacks, Cameco moved forward and 
developed and successfully implemented a remediation plan to allow the 
resumption of pre-inflow activities at the mine.  Work is proceeding across all 
fronts to begin commissioning in ore in mid-2013.

Cameco revised its mine plan building on the lessons learned through the 
successful inflow remediation, geotechnical, geological, hydrogeological 
assessments, experience gained from the inspection of the underground 
workings after successful mine re-entry and learnings from other Cameco 
operations.  These revisions to the mine plan include expanded ground freezing, 
the introduction of both surface and underground freezing in a hybrid approach 
and the backfilling of the 420 m level and the 465 m level, amongst many 
improvements in design and strategy.  The installed pumping capacity has been 
expanded, and expansions in water treatment and surface storage capacity 
provide for an enhanced water management system.  In addition, Cameco has 
implemented enhanced procedural controls and technical risk assessments for 
mine development and demonstrated their successful application in the 
underground development completed to date.  These and other actions are 
expected to reduce the risk of any future inflows.  Cameco is also employing a 
strategy of bulk freezing the ore zone prior to the commencement of production 
mining in a given area.   

The revised mine plan, successfully implemented remediation program and the 
comprehensive construction and operational startup plans are anticipated to 
maintain the original objectives of the Cigar Lake project, to achieve:  

• a positive economic outcome; 

• a planned annual production of approximately 18 million pounds of U3O8; and 

• over 200 million pounds of production. 

There are a number of risks and challenges associated with developing and 
mining Cigar Lake, which are discussed in Section 24.6.  The construction 
schedule, the planned commencement of production in 2013, and the cost 
estimates assume that Cameco will be able to successfully mitigate project risk.  
Cameco believes it will be able to do so. 

Many aspects of the Cigar Lake project are based on the designs that have been 
proven and are being successfully used at the McArthur River mine.  One of the 
challenges of mining the Cigar Lake deposit is radiation control due to its high 
grade.  Cameco has been producing ore with similar high grades from the 
McArthur River mine since 1999.  The experience from McArthur River has been 
used extensively in the design of the Cigar Lake project.  These designs include 
remote mining for radiation protection, ground freezing for control of radon gas 
and water inflows, underground grinding of the ore and hydraulic hoisting to 
surface.  The incorporation at Cigar Lake of these designs and practices proven 
to be successful at the McArthur River mine significantly reduces the risk in 
numerous aspects of the Cigar Lake project. 

The JBS mining method is new to the uranium mining industry and was 
developed and adapted specifically for the Cigar Lake deposit.  The JBS mining 
method planned for Cigar Lake has been successfully tested with prototype 



 
CIGAR LAKE PROJECT 
NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

February 24, 2012 
Page 180 of 188 

equipment and the mining plan has been engineered to suit this method.  
Because of the high grade of the ore the actual ore tonnage requirements to be 
mined per day to meet the U3O8 production requirement are modest, ranging 
between 100 and 140 t/d at full production of approximately 18 million pounds of 
U3O8 per year.  In general, the projections for jet boring productivity are 
considered to be realistic.   

Although Cameco has successfully demonstrated the JBS mining method in 
trials, this method has not been proven at full production.  Test mining trials have 
been completed on a limited number of cavities that may not be representative of 
the deposit as a whole.  As Cameco ramps up production, there may be some 
technical challenges, which could affect Cameco's production plans, including, 
but not limited to, variable or unanticipated ground conditions, ground movement 
and cave ins, water inflows and variable dilution, recovery values and mining 
productivity.  Even though enhancements have been made to the design of the 
JBS unit, there is a risk that the ramp up to the full production rate may not be 
achieved on a sustained and consistent basis.   

Despite the risks associated with this new mining method, Cameco continues to 
believe that the choice of the JBS mining method is prudent and practical.  
Cameco is confident that it will be able to solve challenges that may arise, but a 
failure to do so would have a significant impact on Cameco's business.  Cameco 
has implemented a comprehensive JBS testing, pre-commissioning, 
commissioning and startup plan to assure successful startup and on-going 
operations.  

Metallurgical test work has been used to design the McClean Lake JEB mill 
circuits relevant to Cigar Lake ore and associated modifications.  Samples used 
for metallurgical test work may not be representative of the deposit as a whole.  
Additional sampling and metallurgical test work will be required to verify the 
consistency of recoveries at the McClean Lake JEB mill and to address the 
potential impacts of ore variability on the mill design and operation. 

Approximately half of the drilling results used to define the Cigar Lake deposit 
were completed between 1981 and 1998 by SERU, a predecessor of AREVA, 
and CLMC prior to Cameco becoming operator in January 2002.  Cameco has 
included this information in the drillhole data base that was used as the basis of 
the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.  Cameco has performed a 
summary audit of the data received from CLMC, is satisfied with the quality of the 
data and considers it valid for use in the estimation of the Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves along with the drilling results that Cameco has collected since 
2002. 

Substantial quantities of underground drilling through the deposit have been 
completed for geotechnical and freezehole drilling.  The core from the 
geotechnical holes has been logged, assayed, and results have been 
incorporated into the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.  Most 
freezeholes are percussion holes so no core is available from them, however,

they are probed using in-hole loggers for radiometric grade data.  This data is a 
valuable source of information and has become part of the resource data base. 

The Cigar Lake deposit contains an estimated Inferred Mineral Resource of 
124.4 million pounds of U3O8 with an estimated grade of 12.6% U3O8.  This 
represents significant exploration potential and, if these Inferred Mineral 
Resources could be upgraded to Mineral Reserves, it is possible they could be 
mined from the existing and future shafts and supporting facilities of the Cigar 
Lake site.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred Mineral 
Resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category.  Mineral Resources that

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on its confidence in its updated mine design and mining plan, successful 
mine remediation and construction performance (both underground and surface) 
to date and a positive economic analysis, Cameco plans to continue to proceed 
through construction to production as described in this technical report.  

Cameco has continued to assess lessons learned and sought opportunities to 
improve the project in many areas including design, engineering, and 
construction and operational  strategy. In addition, Cameco has implemented 
enhanced procedural controls and technical risk assessments for mine 
development.  Cameco is focused on the assurance of success of its project and 
operational execution. 

Cameco successfully completed and received approval for the environmental 
assessment to discharge all treated effluent (except sewage) through two 
pipelines directly to a single location in Seru Bay of Waterbury Lake and is 
currently completing the construction and commissioning of this system. 

Cameco successfully tested and has implemented an innovative surface freeze 
strategy to further assure successful startup and production.  Cameco intends on 
using this approach for the freezing of  initial ore mining panels. 

Cameco has in place a comprehensive operational implementation program 
which focuses on the implementation of the JBS mining system. This includes 
the training of personnel prior to start up of operations, surface and underground 
testing, and reliability planning and implementation to assure as effective and 
efficient a startup, as possible.  

Cameco is ensuring that systems, tools and personnel resources are enhanced 
and assessed for sufficiency, on a periodic basis, to assure the successful 
delivery of the project from engineering through field execution.  Cameco 
continues to seek opportunities to integrate learnings from the project and its 
other operating divisions to assure a successful project. 

In connection with a regulatory requirement, Cameco retained an independent 
engineering consultant to perform a technical review of the Cigar Lake mine 
design.  A number of recommendations and suggestions for follow-up were 
included in the report provided by the consultants in the areas of geological 
interpretation, hydrogeological modelling, ground freezing, geotechnical data 
interpretation and ground stability assessment. Cameco has implemented an 
action plan to address such recommendations and suggestions in a timely 
manner. 

Cameco plans to continue to systematically collect density samples from current 
and future core drilling programs to add samples to the current density database. 
The additional samples will be used to further improve the density estimation 
formulas for Mineral Resource estimation.

A drill program was proposed and initiated in 2011 for the western portion of the 
Phase 2 area with the goal of confirming the quantity of Mineral Resources as 
well as the potential to upgrade the category of such Mineral Resources.  
Following the completion of the current drill program (early-2012), Cameco plans 
to create a 3-dimensional block model for the Phase 2 area that will incorporate 
the latest geological interpretation and up-to-date structural information.  This 
model will be used to update the Mineral Resource estimate and provide a basis 
for a scoping study to assess possible development options. 

Additional drilling from surface or underground will be required to upgrade the 
Phase 1 Inferred Resources.  No surface delineation drilling over Phase 1 is 
planned at this time.  Inferred Mineral Resources have a great amount of 
uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or 
economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred Mineral 
Resources at Cigar Lake will ever be upgraded to a higher category. 

Metallurgical test work has been used to design the McClean Lake JEB mill 
circuits relevant to Cigar Lake ore and associated modifications.  Samples used 
for metallurgical test work may not be representative of the deposit as a whole.  It 
is recommended that an ongoing sampling and metallurgical test work campaign 
be implemented to verify the consistency of recoveries at the McClean Lake JEB 
mill and to address the potential impacts of ore variability on the mill design and 
operation. 

In order to execute the Cigar Lake project plans while mitigating risks, the 
proposed expenditures set out in Tables 21-1, 21-2 and 21-3 of this report are 
necessary and endorsed by the authors of this technical report.  

The authors of this technical report concur with, and recommend that Cameco 
proceed with, the foregoing plans and actions.
