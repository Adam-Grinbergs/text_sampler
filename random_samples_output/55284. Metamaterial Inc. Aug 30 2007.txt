1.0 Summary 
 
Continental Precious Minerals Inc. ("Continental" or "Corporation") owns a 100% interest in eighteen 
MMS (multi metal sediment) exploration licences subject to a 5% net profits interest in favour of 
Geoforum Scandinavia AB. 
 
The Viken MMS Licence covering 677 hectares is one of 18 MMS licences covering 9,829 hectares 
located approximately 25 km southwest of the town of Östersund in the central part of Sweden, 
approximately 650 km north-northwest of Stockholm. Transportation systems are well developed in 
the area with daily air service, as well as rail and truck freight services. Electrical power and modern 
communications are readily available in the area. Access to the Viken MMS Licence is via paved and 
secondary roads. 
 
Exploration licences are granted for an initial three-year term and are subject to annual rentals and 
work commitments, and are renewable for additional terms. All of the MMS licences held by 
Continental are in good standing.  
 
The Viken MMS Licence is underlain by Middle and Upper Cambrian age, black shales interlayered 
with subordinate quartzites, limestones and 'stinkstones' (bituminous limestone) known as the Alum 
Shale. This assemblage is overlain in parts of the licence area by Ordovician limestones. The Alum 
Shale occurs as both autochthonous (in situ) and allochthonous (fault detached) blocks, the latter 
having greater potential for economic mineralization due to imbrication of mineralized blocks. The 
allochthonous blocks can be subdivided into Middle Cambrian and Upper Cambrian, with the higher 
grades of mineralization occurring in the Upper Cambrian blocks. The Alum Shale is unique because 
of an enrichment of uranium, vanadium, molybdenum and nickel significantly greater than average 
bituminous shale. The Alum Shale has been subjected to metamorphic temperatures of 200-300°C, 
converting black shale into semi-anthracitic to anthracitic grade "coal".  
 
The focus of exploration is to define a very large tonnage low grade multi-element deposit suitable to 
open pit exploitation. Shallow drilling (to approximately 200 metres) is utilized to define areas of Alum 
Shale that are near surface and not associated with a potentially large waste rock stripping ratio. To 
the end of July 2007 28 diamond drill holes (5,356.65 metres) drilled by the Corporation have tested a 
portion of the Viken MMS Licence.  
 
Geological interpretation of drill results indicates a 1,000 metre wide zone traversing the Viken MMS 
Licence that is associated with minimal overburden and capping limestone and could potentially be 
suitable for the development of an open pit mine. Additional diamond drilling is required to further test 
geological and grade continuity along this zone. The authors estimate the inferred resource at the 
Viken MMS Licence to be 685,242,000 tons grading 0.34 pounds per ton U3O8, 5.83 pounds per ton 
V2O5, 0.73 pounds per ton MoO3, and 0.61 pounds per ton Ni. Contained within the 685,242,000 ton 
inferred resource is 232,982,280 pounds of U3O8, 3,994,960,860 pounds of V2O5, 500,226,660 
pounds of MoO3, and 417,997,620 pounds of nickel. 
 
A proposed work program featuring 17,000 metres of diamond drilling and related activities is 
recommended. A budget of $C 3,600,000 is recommended to support this exploration work.  
 
Based on the results from diamond drilling programs in 2006 and early 2007 conducted by 
Continental the proposed program and associated budget is warranted, and will further expand the 
economic potential of the Viken MMS Licence to host a large shallow economic multi metal deposit.

2.0 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
 
At the request of Mr. Edward Godin, President of Continental, G.A. Harron & Associates Inc. 
("GAHA") and P&E Mining Consultants Inc. ("P&E") has been contracted to prepare a Technical 
Report on the Viken MMS Licence, Jamtland, Norbotten, Kingdom of Sweden, as of August 28, 2007. 
GAHA was also requested to qualify the proposed exploration programs and budgets for the on-going 
exploration of the property. The Viken MMS Licence is considered to be advanced stage exploration, 
as grid drilling continues in order to define a deposit suitable for open pit exploitation. 
 
Continental is a reporting issuer listed on the TSX. The address of the Corporation is 360 Bay Street, 
Suite 500, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2V6. It is understood that this report will be used to 
provide disclosure of an updated inferred resource on the Viken MMS Licence.  
 
This technical report is to conform to National Instrument 43-101 standards. Terms of engagement 
are in a letter from GAHA to Continental dated March 20, 2007 and a letter from P&E dated August 1, 
2007. FHB Consulting Services Inc. ("FHB") was engaged by P&E to assist in the updated resource 
estimation.  
 
Prior to this assignment GAHA has provided technical services to the Corporation, in the form of 
reviewed press releases on this and other properties, whereas P&E and FHB have not previously 
provided services to the Corporation. 
 
GAHA is familiar with the general area through a site visit to project area on March 26 and 27, 2007. 
The location of the property was observed, diamond drill core was examined and sampling protocols 
were reviewed. Two one-quarter split mineralized core sample was collected for analysis to verify the 
presence of uranium in core samples. Access, terrain characteristics, surficial geology and 
exploration logistics were noted at this time.  
 
The MMS licences (as a group) are material to the Corporation, representing one of its main resource 
assets. This report focuses on the exploration of the Viken MMS Licence, located in Bergs Commune, 
Jämtland County. 
 
The information herein is derived from a review of documents listed in the Section 21.0, information 
provided by the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden ("MIS"), and the Swedish Geological Survey ("SGU") 
and private files maintained by Continental.  
 
There were no limitations put on the authors in preparation of this report with respect to technical 
information. 
 
This report contains details of the land tenure, a summary of previous exploration and development 
work, a compilation and synthesis of geology, and assay data, and recommendations for further 
exploration and development of the property. 
 
Cost data used to create the proposed budget to support the proposed work programs is based on 
Continental's experience over the past 12 months. References to dollars in the report are to the 
Canadian currency, unless otherwise indicated. 
 
Metric units of measure are used in this report, except references to metal concentrations, to reflect 
the fact that uranium, vanadium and molybdenum oxides are traditionally traded in Imperial units. 
 
The following list shows the meaning of the abbreviations for technical terms used throughout the text 
of this report.

3.0 Reliance on Other Experts 
 
The historical work reported in this technical report is taken from reports published by the SGU that 
document the extensive exploration and development activities completed by this organization in the 
1970s and 1980s. The authors have no reason to believe that the information is false or purposefully 
misleading, and the authors have relied on the accuracy and integrity of the work performed by the 
SGU. The author also relies on the truth and accuracy of the data presented in the sources listed in 
the Reference section of this report. 
 
Information as to title of licences has been sourced from the MIS, and is believed to be accurate. The 
authors have also relied upon a summary of licence status prepared by the Corporation's legal 
counsel.  
 

4.0 Property Descriptions and Locations 
 
The subject property is located in the central part of Sweden, approximately 500 km south of the 
Arctic Circle, and approximately 650 km north-northwest of Stockholm (Figure 1). 
 
Continental entered into a purchase agreement with Geoforum Scandinavia AB ("Geoforum") on 
March 21, 2005 for the acquisition of certain of the 18 MMS licences and 11 HRU licences. Terms of 
the agreement include $ 40,000 cash, and 300,000 common shares and a 5% net profits interest. The

balance of the 18 MMS licences were issued directly from the MIS. The HRU licences are not further 
discussed in this report and have been previously reported on (Phillips, A.H. ,2005).  
 
The focus of this report is the Viken MMS Licence, one of the 18 MMS licences located approximately 
25 km southwest of the town of Östersund in Bergs Commune, Jämtland County. Details of the Viken 
MMS Licence, and neighbouring licences are provided in Table 1.

Totals         18   9,828.79 195,200  

 
Eleven of the licences are contiguous and seven licences are isolated by narrow strips of land being 
used for such activities as agricultural, residential or recreational purposes, and public utilities (Figure 
2).  
 
In aggregate the 18 licences cover 9,828.79 ha and the Viken MMS Licence covers 667 ha. The 
licences are not required to be officially surveyed as their corners are referenced to Swedish RT90 
survey co-ordinates registered with the MIS.  
 
All MMS exploration licences were acquired in accordance with the Minerals Act (1991:45) in 2005, 
and are valid for a three year term. Areas excluded from licence applications include lands occupied 
by private dwellings, state infrastructure, industrial plants, town sites, public buildings, cemeteries, 
military installations, historical sites and national parks or protected areas. A part of the application 
process requires that all the property owners in the licence area be notified that an exploration licence 
has been granted.  
 
The Minerals Act (1991:45) governs the ownership and exploitation of mineral substances on private 
and public land. Mineral substances (concession minerals) are divided into three categories. The first 
category includes metallic substances (arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cesium, chromium, cobalt, 
copper, gold, iridium, iron ore, lanthanum and lanthanide series, lead, lithium, manganese, mercury, 
molybdenum, nickel, niobium, osmium palladium, platinum, rhodium, rubidium, ruthenium, scandium, 
silver strontium, tantalum, thorium, tin, titanium, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, yttrium, zinc, and 
zirconium); the second includes industrial minerals (alum shale, andalusite, apatite, barite, brucite, 
refractory and clinkering clay, coal, fluorspar, graphite, kyanite, magnesite, nepheline syenite, pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, salt and other similar salt deposits, sillimanite and wollastonite); and the third category 
includes oil, gaseous hydrocarbons and diamonds. Other minerals not captioned above belong to the 
landowner.

There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of licences. Exploration and exploitation licences are 
transferable subject to review by the MIS. An exploration licence is granted for a specific area where 
there is some likelihood of a successful discovery of a concession mineral being made. A licence may 
be withheld if it is obvious that the applicant has not the possibility or intention to conduct appropriate 
exploration or has earlier shown unsuitability to conduct exploration work.  
 
An exploration licence is valid for a period of three years from the date of issue and can be extended 
by another period of up to a maximum of three years provided that acceptable exploration work has 
been carried out on the licence. An extension may also be granted if the licence holder has valid 
reasons for non-performance of work but indicates that exploration will be conducted during the 
extension of time. In exceptional circumstances the licence may be extended for another maximum of 
four years, and in extreme cases the licence may be extended by another maximum of five years. 
Fees attached to the acquisition and maintenance of an exploration licence include an application fee 
of SEK 500 per application and an exploration fee of SEK 20 per hectare for the first three year 
period. Fees for the period four to six years are SEK 21 annually per hectare. Higher negotiated fees 
are attached to time periods beyond six years. All fees are paid in advance subject to partial 
reimbursement if necessary.  
 
Prior to commencing exploration activities the licence holder is required to file a work plan detailing 
proposed activities, timetable, and an assessment of the impact on private rights and public interests. 
The work plan needs to be communicated to all landowners and other interested parties. The work 
plan can be executed if no objections are raised. Failing initial approval, mediation between the 
licence holder and the objecting party is undertaken, and failing mutual agreement the MIS can set up 
conditions for the work plan to proceed. Guaranteed security deposits are also required to cover 
possible damage and encroachment from exploration work.  
 
As of the date of this report there are no objections filed against the work plans relating to the Viken 
MMS Licence.  
 
Continental's management has provided a compilation on legal title of the 18 MMS licences. 
Inspection of these documents indicates that all of the licences are in good standing until at least May 
9, 2008. 
 
No environmental or planning permits are required for geological mapping and manual geochemical 
surveying. Permits are required from the district authorities for systematic till sampling, mechanical 
trenching and drilling programs. Geoforum is in possession of a diamond drilling permit for the Viken 
MMS Licence. 
 
When an exploration licence is terminated without the granting of an exploitation licence, the explorer 
is required to submit a report detailing the work performed. 
 
Continental's management warrants that the Corporation has not received from any government 
authority any notice of, or communication relating to, any actual or alleged breach of any 
environmental laws, regulations, policies or permits. In November 2005 Continental established an 
environmental policy intended to ensure that only the highest standards of environmental practices 
would be used on the licences. Continental has engaged Sweco and MRM Konsult AB, prominent, 
independent, Swedish environmental firms to assist the Corporation in implementing the policy.  
 
An application fee of SEK 6,000 is charged for each exploitation licence. Exploitation licences are 
granted for a period of 25 years unless the applicant requests a shorter period of time. Licences are 
automatically extended for 10 year terms if exploitation is in progress. Mining royalties in the amount 
of 0.15% of gross value of concession minerals are due to the landowners within the concession area 
and 0.05% is due the State.

However the decision to issue an exploitation licence is dependent upon the proponent obtaining 
approval of the host commune. In addition to an exploitation licence, permits under the Swedish 
Environmental Code (1998:808), the Swedish Nuclear Activities Act are required.  
 

5.0 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, 
Physiography 
 
The Viken MMS Licence is accessible by a combination of paved and secondary roads in a general 
southwest direction from Östersund (Figure 2). The distance by road from Östersund is approximately 
40 kilometres. The topography of the area is dominated by rounded hills and broad valleys at 
elevations in the range of 313 to 370 m. Moderate temperatures in the summer months followed by 
sub-zero temperatures in the winter months are the norm. Most exploration activities can be 
conducted year-round. Mixed coniferous and deciduous forests exist between open pasture lands. 
Mixed farming and small scale forestry operations constitute the main land use.  
 
Transportation systems are well developed in the area with daily air service, as well as rail and truck 
freight services. Electrical power and modern communications are readily available in the area. The 
major mining centres in the region are Kiruna, approximately 750 km to the northeast and Falun, 
approximately 400 km to the south, both of which are sources of mine related services. 
 
The Viken MMS Licence has the sufficiency of surface area for future exploration or mining 
operations including potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pads 
areas and potential processing plant sites. 
 

6.0 History 
 
Mining of the Alum Shale started in 1637 at Andrarum in Skåne for the recovery of alum (potassium 
aluminum sulphate) used mainly for the preservation of hides and in the textile industry for the fixation 
of colours. The presence and potential usage of the kerogen component of the Alum Shale was 
recognized in the eighteen hundreds and various attempts were made to extract and refine the 
hydrocarbons using conventional retorting methods. Oil was recovered from deposits at Kinnekulle, 
Närke and Östergötland during World War II, largely for military purposes. However, with the renewed 
import of conventional oil after the war, the extraction plants ceased to be economically viable and 
production dwindled and finally ceased in 1966. The identification of high concentrations of uranium in 
kolm lenses (very high organic content rock) dates back to 1893. Mining proved unsuccessful due to 
the erratic distribution of the kolm lenses. 
 
After World War II systematic exploration for uranium by the SGU on behalf of the Swedish Oil Shale 
Company, and later by the Atomic Energy Company ("Atomenergi AB") focused in the Västergötland 
and Närke areas. A bed of Alum Shale 3.5 m thick containing about 300 ppm U identified over a large 
area led to the establishment of a uranium extraction and research facility at Ranstad, with a nominal 
capacity of 120 tonnes of uranium per year. The plant operated from 1965-1969 at approximately half 
capacity due to the lower market price for uranium and lagging domestic demand. The recovery 
process consisted of milling the shale, removal of carbonate rock and acid leaching. Recoveries of 
approximately 67% were subsequently increased to approximately 80% prior to closing.  
 
The presence of unusually high concentrations of vanadium in the Alum Shale in the Skåne area was 
noted in 1940 and lead to various attempts to extract the element. The extraction technique involved 
roasting followed by sulphuric acid leaching. Small amounts of vanadium pentoxide and alum were 
produced during World War II.

Prior to changes in the Minerals Act in 1992-93, most exploration work in Sweden was carried out by 
state controlled exploration companies, namely SGU, Sweden Bureau of Mines ("NSG"), Sverges 
Geologiska AB ("SGAB") and Luosavaara-Kirunavaara Aktiebolag ("LKAB"). In general the state 
controlled companies had separate geographical areas and metals of interest, and foreign companies 
were discouraged by the mandatory 50% State interest in all projects. 
 
The Swedish State, in the form of AB Atomenergi (Anon, 1990), carried out exploration for uranium in 
the Alum Shale from the 1950's to 1967, after which the SGU took over uranium exploration. The 
SGU carried out work under contract for LKAB, in the Alum Shale in 1977-78.This resulted in the 
drilling of holes Myrvicken 78-004 and 78-005 on the Viken MMS Licence, and a total of 17 holes in 
the vicinity of the 18 MMS licences. Assay values returned from Myrviken 78-005 cores record 0.41 
lbs per ton U3O8, 5.36 lbs per ton V2O5, 0.91 lbs per ton MoO3 and 0.08 lbs per ton Ni, over 182 m 
(true thickness). The thickness of the intercept is one of the largest recorded in the Alum Shale and 
coupled with the metal concentrations indicated a target area for additional exploration. 
 
The Swedish Government commenced a five year exploration and evaluation self-sufficiency program 
for uranium in 1977 financed by the Svensk Kärnbränsleförsorjning AB (Sweden Nuclear Fuel Supply 
Company ("SKBF")). The Swedish Government stopped its uranium exploration program in 1981 
following an adverse referendum on nuclear power, though SKBF continued work on selected targets 
until 1985, using SGAB as the operator until 1982. There has been no state supported uranium 
exploration in Sweden since 1985 (Anon., 2002). 
 

7.0 Geological Setting 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 
Archean age crystalline rocks of the Fennoscandian Shield have been age dated at between 2.8 and 
2.6 Ga and outcrop in northernmost Sweden. Paleoproterozoic age crystalline rocks, dated at 
between 2.0 and 1.65 Ga overlie the Archean rocks and outcrop in the northern, western and 
southern parts of Sweden. Deformation and metamorphism accompanying the Svecokarelian 
orogeny affect both the Archean and Proterozoic age basement rocks. Rocks affected by late 
Svecokarelian deformation after 1850 Ma; exhibit NNE-trending folds with crenulation cleavage 
overprinted on older structures. Svecokarelian deformation is also associated with NW trending 
ductile transcurrent shear zones that deform earlier folds into gentle S and Z shapes.  
 
During the Neoproterozoic ( > 570 Ma) rift basins preserved on the Baltic side of the Iapetus Ocean 
were filled with coarse clastic rocks prior to the establishment of a passive plate margin in Cambrian 
times. The passive margin was characterized by shallow marine sandstones and with later 
bituminous Alum Shale deposited in a stable epicontinental sea. Final closure of the Iapetus Ocean 
during the Silurian resulted in easterly directed thrusting of continental basinal rocks (allochthonous) 
ranging in age from Precambrian to Silurian age onto the Baltic Shield area covering autochthonous 
Alum Shale and older lithologies (Figure 3). The Viken area is situated within allocthonous Middle and 
Upper Cambrian, and Ordovician rocks in the foreland of the Caledonide Mountains. 
 
On a regional scale lithofacies development in Cambrian age rocks is similar throughout northern, 
central and southern Sweden. Lower Cambrian sandstones underlie phosphorite-bearing 
conglomerates, which in turn are overlain by Middle Cambrian age grey-green siltstones. Upper 
Middle, Upper Cambrian and lower Ordovician Alum Shale overlie this sedimentary rock sequence.

7.2 Property Geology 
 
The Viken MMS Licence stratigraphy consists of upper Middle and Upper Cambrian age black shales 
interlayered with subordinate quartzites, limestones and 'stinkstones' (bituminous limestone). This 
assemblage is overlain in parts of the licence area by Ordovician limestones (Figure 4). The black 
shales are generally underlain by Proterozoic granites and gneisses thrust eastward over Archean 
granitic basement rocks. The shales occur as both autochthonous (in situ) and allochthonous (fault 
detached) blocks, the latter having greater potential for economic mineralization due to imbrication of 
mineralized blocks (Figure 5). The thickness of the Upper Cambrian black shale stratigraphy hosting 
the syngenetic deposits has been tectonically thickened from a general 20-30 m by Silurian thrusting 
and folding to approximately 180 m near the village of Myrviken. The allochthonous blocks can be 
subdivided into those belonging to the Middle Cambrian and Upper Cambrian, with the higher grades 
of mineralization occurring in the Upper Cambrian blocks. Structurally the Viken MMS Licence is 
situated on the eastern flank of a major north-northwest trending anticline, which is manifested by a 
broad ridge trending in the same direction. The Alum Shale exhibits a strong penetrative foliation and 
has been subjected to metamorphic temperatures of 200-300°C, converting black shale into semi-
anthracitic to anthracitic grade "coal".

8.0 Deposit Type 
 
Black shales comprise a widely distributed unique rock suite, particularly in pre-Jurassic time. Many 
black shales are enriched in various metals and hydrocarbons (Swanson, 1961, Vine and Tourtelot, 
1970, Grauch and Leventhal 1989). The metals suite includes Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Ag, Zn, Co, Mo, Re, V, 
U, Se, Sn, Bi, Au, Pt, Pd, etc.) with a variable proportion of kerogen and sulphidic components. 
Nearly all black shales contain distinctive fossils (Bulman, 1955), lack signs of bioturbation and are 
characteristically thinly laminated. Most black shales accumulated in oxygen-poor to anoxic 
environments (Pettijohn, 1949). The mineralogical composition of the black shale sediment records 
the provenance of the rock. The abundance of quartz, feldspars and clay minerals records a granitic 
source area (Snäll, 1988). The suites of metals contained in black shale are also related to the 
chemical composition and weathering history of the source area. Concentrations of elements such as 
U, V, Mo reflect a granitic source area, such as the Baltic craton. Metals liberated during weathering 
of the source terrain are transported as oxidized species in surface and ground water into anoxic 
environments. Reducing conditions cause the metals to chelate with organic matter or, in the case of 
uranium, precipitate as uraninite. 
 
The rate of sedimentation probably exercised an important control on the concentration of some trace 
elements. In the Ranstad area there exists an inverse relationship of uranium content and shale 
thickness in the Upper Cambrian facies (Andersson et al, 1985). The organic carbon content of the 
Alum Shale generally shows a sympathetic relationship with the concentrations of uranium, 
vanadium, molybdenum and nickel, indicating that organic carbon sequesters some of the metals as 
organo-metallic complexes.  
 
Metal contents of all species present in black shale are rather uniform over large distances, reflecting 
the large and rather uniform composition of the source areas. Vertical variations in metal species 
within the shale reflects the opening and closing of the Iapetus Ocean with a concomitant change in 
chemical nature of the source areas. 
 
Not all black shales contain the same suite of anomalous metals and / or kerogen contents. Quinby-
Hunt et al, (1989) included analyses of Upper Cambrian black shales from the Alum Shale in Sweden 
and Norway in an update of the compilation by Vine and Tourtelot (1970). This revised compilation of 
metal contents in an "average" black shale is compared to the metal contents of Alum shale in the 
Viken MMS Licence area in the following table.

The comparison data indicate that the Alum Shale in the Jämtland area is enriched in U, V, Mo and 
presumably Ni.  
 
Metalliferous black shales are common throughout the world in Cambrian-Ordovician and Silurian 
marine sedimentary sequences. A noteable example is the "Kupferschiefer", a lithological formation 
that extends over 600,000 km² from England to Poland, but of which exploitable Cu reserves 
represent only 0.2% of the total area, notably at the southern edge of the Zechstein Basin. To date, 
more than two million tons of copper have been produced from this geological formation along with 
minor amounts of noble and rare metals. 
 
Black shales, other than the Alum Shale that have received considerable attention in the past as 
possible hydrocarbon sources include the Mancos Shale formation in Colorado / Utah (Green River 
Basin) U.S.A.  
 
Another example of a metal-rich black shale is the Ogcheon Fold Belt in South Korea (Chi and Yun, 
2006). Several low-grade uranium deposits near Geosan, Boeun and Geumsan, with a maximum 
content of 300-400 ppm U3O8 were discovered by drilling. Uranium-bearing black shale consists of 
quartz, micas, graphite, calcite dolomite, muscovite, vanadium-bearing mica, chlorite barite, barium-
rich feldspars, apatite, iron oxides, sulphides and uranium minerals. In these deposits the uranium 
occurs dominantly as secondary minerals (autunite, meta-autunite, torbernite, francevillite in the form 
of scattered grains and thin films along fractures in "coaly" beds. Primary uraninite is rare and occurs 
as very fine grained disseminations and associated with organic materials.  
 
Black shale deposits are stratigraphic formations covering very large areas, and are not necessarily 
exposed at ground surface. However those located at or near the present day ground surface are 
preferred as they are associated with more favourable exploitation costs. Therefore shallow diamond 
drilling is the most effective method of exploration used in conjunction with stratigraphic and structural 
analyses of the host geology.

9.0 Mineralization 
 
Mineralization discovered by Continental on the Viken MMS Licence leads on from the historical work 
of the SGU in the late 1970s and the analytical results from diamond drill hole Myrviken 78-005 
located on the licence.  
 
Mineralization of potential economic significance is hosted in Middle and Upper Cambrian black shale 
(Alum Shale). The Alum Shale is present as nappe slices thrust east-northeastward and stacked into 
a thick sequence. Upper Cambrian strata are more enriched in uranium and vanadium than the 
Middle Cambrian age strata (Andersson et al, 1985). Moreover, higher uranium contents are 
associated with organic carbon contents greater than about 10 percent. The high organic content 
facies of Alum Shale has a shiny to lustrous black colour resembling anthracite riddled with millimetre 
to centimetre thick calcite and pyrite veinlets.  
 
The size and spatial distribution of the Middle and Upper Cambrian nappe slices is currently 
unknown, but appears to influence the reported metal values and the spatial distribution of 
outcropping Alum Shale.  
 
Diamond drill information to date suggests that a north-northwest-trending zone approximately 1,000 
m wide that traverses the entire Viken MMS Licence (approximately 3 km) is underlain by Alum Shale 
exposed at surface. Peripheral to and bounding this zone is a relatively thin layer of limestone 
capping the Alum Shale. Based on regional geology Alum Shale (either outcropping or covered with a 
thin limestone cap) continues both north and south of the Viken MMS Licence over a strike length of 
approximately 20 kms. The width of the outcropping Alum Shale along the 20 km strike length is 
currently unknown. 
 
Visual examination of drill core does not reveal the mode of occurrence of the mineral species 
associated with the analytical results. This is a reflection of the extremely fine grained nature of the 
mineralization. Scanning electron microscopy investigations will be required to ascertain the 
mineralogy of the metallic components. 
 
Uranium values are predominantly associated with sub-micron-scale uraninite (UO2) crystals. This 
syngenetic mineralization is the result of precipitation of uranium from aqueous uranium complexes 
entering the chemically reducing environment of the Alum Shale. Some uranium is reported to be 
present as organo-metal complexes (Andersson et al, 1985).  
 
Vanadium has geochemical characteristics similar to uranium suggesting that oxidized aqueous 
species precipitate in the chemically reducing environment, and also form discrete sub-micron-scale 
minerals. Some vanadium may be present in the clay mineral component of the shale and as organo-
metallic species.  
 
Molybdenum values also exhibit a sympathetic relationship with both uranium and vanadium values 
indicating that most of the molybdenum present is associated with precipitation of aqueous species in 
a chemically reducing environment, present in the lattice of clay minerals, and as organo-metallic 
complexes.  
 
Ni values also mimic the abundances of uranium, vanadium and molybdenum values, suggesting 
similar modes of occurrence.  
 
Figure 6 (as an example) illustrates the relationship between uranium, vanadium, molybdenum and 
nickel values in samples of Upper Cambrian Alum Shale in drill hole Myr 06-003. This correlation is a 
common feature in all the analytical data derived from the drilling program.

10.0 Exploration 
 
Continental has elected to proceed with a diamond drilling program rather than undertaking other 
exploration activities. The mineralization in the Alum Shale is well documented and the selection of 
licence areas and subsequent drill targets is predicated on historical analytical results. For example 
the Viken MMS Licence was acquired and the drilling target was selected on the basis of historical 
data derived from SGU diamond drill hole Myrviken78-005, which indicated an exceptionally thick 
sequence of Alum Shale containing up to 180 ppm uranium and 1,560 ppm vanadium (SGU BRAP 
82502, 1982).  
 

11.0 Drilling 
 
Drilling on the Viken MMS Licence commenced in August 2006 and 11 holes (Myr 06-001 to 011) for 
a total of 1,939.76 m were completed by year end. Drilling resumed in February 2007 with two drill 
rigs and as of the date of this report 17 additional diamond drill holes (Myr 07-series), were 
completed, for a total of 3,416.89 m. The combined total metres drilled is 5,356.65 m. All drill collars 
are sited using GPS instruments and capped casing are left in place pending final collar surveying. All 
diamond drill holes are vertical holes, yielding true thickness intercepts. Drill hole trajectory surveys 
have not been not been undertaken due to the short length of the holes and the friable nature of the 
Alum Shale.  
 
The 2006 diamond drilling was contracted to Taiga Exploration Drilling AB of Malå, and the 2007 
drilling is contracted to T.G.B. Borrteknik AB of Gråbo and Ludvika Borrteknik HB of Ludvika. All three 
drill contractors use Atlas Copco track mounted drills recovering BQ size core. 
 
A summary of diamond drill hole locations and statistics is given in Table 3, with the drill collar 
locations illustrated in Figure 7.

Drill holes Myr 06-001 and 002 were drilled close to each other (2 m) and approximately 30 m south 
of Myrviken 78-005 in order to verify the results of the previous drilling by the SGU in 1978 and to 
acquire sufficient mineralized material to conduct other analytical tests. Since the lithologies in Myr 
06-001 and Myr 06-002 are almost identical, only the analytical data from Myr 06-002 are further 
discussed.  
 
Drill holes Myr 06-001 and 002 reported a true thickness of 153.1 m of Alum Shale whereas Myrviken 
78-005 (approximately 30 m distant) reported a true thickness of 193. 5 m. The analytical results for 
selected oxides and nickel in both drill cores are very similar, as presented in Table 4.

The increases in the content of organic carbon and vanadium oxide are probably due to improved 
analytical techniques (since 1978). The close correlation of the analytical values from the two holes 
indicates that the SGU data is credible and can be integrated into the Viken MMS project data base. 
 
The initial drill pattern was designed to drill test the Alum Shale at various distances of about 50 to 
150 m distant from drill hole Myrviken 78-005. This was accomplished with drill holes Myr 06-002, 003 
and 005. The next series of diamond drill holes, Myr 06-006, 007, tested the Alum shale at a distance 
of 200 m from Myrviken 78-005. Step out holes Myr 06-008 and 009 were sited 250 m away from 
Myrviken 78-005, and drill holes Myr 06- 010 and 011 were sited 300 m distant from Myrviken 78-005.  
 
Satisfied with the geological and grade continuity results from the 2006 drilling Continental 
commenced grid drilling at 400 m centres with reference to grid base line oriented at 345°, which is 
essentially the strike direction of the exposed (or thinly covered) Alum Shale nappes. Diamond drill 
holes Myr 07-001 were sited on this grid approximately 1.1 km west of Myrviken 78-005, and drill 
holes Myr 07-017 and 020 were sited on the grid approximately 800 m south of Mryviken 78-005.

Drill hole Myr 06-003 sited approximately 50 m north of Myrviken 78-005 encountered 29.4 m of light 
to medium grey limestone beneath 4.6 m of overburden, followed by 178.1 m of black fissile Alum 
Shale. Pyrite aggregates measuring a few mm to 10 cm with limestone interlayers measuring cm to 
0.9 m and thin calcite veins are common in the core. The base of the Alum Shale is placed where 
massive medium grey mudstone becomes the dominant lithology. Values of 0.41 lbs/ton U3O8, 6.25 
lbs/ton V2O5, 0.86 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.57 lbs/ton Ni over 142 m are present at this location. 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-004 sited approximately 125 m southeast of Myrviken 78-005 drilled through 93.51 
m of Alum Shale containing 0.02 to 0.2 m interlayers of pyrite and limestone, followed by 55.7 m of 
fossiliferous limestone and another 61.1 m of Alum Shale. Analysis of this core returned values of 
0.45 lbs/ton U3O8, 6.8 lbs/ton V2O5, 1.0 lbs/ton MoO3, and 0.61 lbs/ton Ni in the upper intercept (87.7 
m) and values of 0.30 lbs/ton U3O8, 5.0 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.93 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.54 lbs/ton Ni in the 
lower intercept (48 m). 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-005 sited approximately 150 m southwest of Myrviken 78-005 drilled through 193.70 
m of Alum Shale containing 0.02 to 0.3 m thick interlayers of pyrite and limestone. Most of the core 
exhibits a high degree of fissility. Analysis of the core returned values of 0.32 lbs/ton U3O8, 7.86 
lbs/ton V2O5, 0.73 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.55 lbs/ton Ni over 168.9 m. 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-006, 100 m west of Myrviken 78-005 was drilled to a depth of 206 m encountered 
192.8 m of Alum Shale and returned an average of 0.30 lbs/ton U3O8, 6.76 lbs /ton V2O5, 0.67 lbs/ton 
MoO3 and 0.67 lbs/ton Ni. The lower U3O8, MoO3 and higher V2O5 contents may be explained by the 
presence of a nappe block different than that encountered in Myr 06-005 and 003.  
 
Drill hole Myr 06-007 located approximately 200 m east of Myrviken 78-005 encountered 8.3 m of 
Alum Shale followed by predominantly limestone to a depth of 101.80 m, where the hole was 
terminated. Geological interpretation suggests that Alum Shale probably occurs at deeper levels. 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-008 located approximately 250 m south of Myrviken 78-005 and drilled to a depth of 
204 m encountered a true thickness of 188 m of Alum Shale containing thin interlayers of pyrite and 
limestone. Analysis of the core returned values of 0.46 lbs/ton U3O8, 5.20 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.95 lbs/ton 
MoO3 and 0.84 lbs/ton Ni, comparable with other drill holes in the area.  
 
Drill hole Myr 06-009 located approximately 250 m north of Myrviken 78-005 encountered limestone 
and was terminated at a depth of 97.80 m. 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-010 sited approximately 300 m southeast of Myrviken 78-005 collared and 
terminated in limestone at a depth of 47. 8 m. A 3.4 m interval of black shale, possibly Alum Shale, 
was not sampled, due to the preponderance of limestone.  
 
Drill hole Myr 06-011 located approximately 350 m southwest of Myrviken 78-005, and drilled to a 
depth of 197 m intersected 184 m of Alum Shale containing thin interlayers (0.02 to 0.2 m) of pyrite 
and limestone. Analysis of the core returned values of 0.39 lbs/ton U3O8, 6.66 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.89 
lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.78 lbs/ton Ni. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-001 is located approximately 1.4 km west-northwest of Mryviken 78-005 and is 
positioned on the 400 m spacing drill grid. The hole was drilled to a depth of 191.2 m and

encountered mixed Alum Shale and limestone to a depth of 56.5 m, followed by 102.0 m of Alum 
Shale. Analysis of the core returned values of 0.32 lbs/ton U3O8, 4.96 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.57 lbs/ton MoO3 
and 0.40 lbs/ton Ni. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-002 is located approximately 1.2 km west of Myrviken 78-005 and 400 m south of 
Myr 07-001. This hole is also sited on the 400 m spacing drill grid and was drilled to a depth of 199.5 
m. Rock types encountered in the hole are predominantly grey shale, limestone and quartzite, with 
three thin layers (6.7, 5.0 and 6.5 m) of Alum Shale. Geological interpretation suggests that this drill 
location is in the sedimentary rocks overlying the Alum Shale. Analytical data for core samples from 
this hole are not available.  
 
Drill hole Myr 07-003 is located approximately 1.1 km west-southwest of Myrviken 78-005 and is sited 
on the 400 m spacing drill grid. This hole was drilled to a depth of 206.96 m. A mixed assemblage of 
limestone, grey shale and black shale extending to a depth of 158 m overlie another mixed 
assemblage of grey and black shales. Analysis of the core indicates metal contents of no economic 
significance. However, the lowermost 8.4 m of core returned values of 0.38 lbs/ton U3O8, 4.71 lbs/ton 
V2O5, 0.73 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.41 lbs/ton Ni, suggesting that the drill hole has not penetrated the 
entire Alum Shale sequence. 
 
Drill holes Myr 07-001, 07-002 and 07-003, located in the western part of the MMS Viken Licence, 
appear to delimit the western margin of Alum Shale outcroppings. Drill holes Myr 07-002 and 003 
both encountered limestone overlying Alum Shale. While Alum Shale is known to continue westward 
it is present at depths below 200 m and therefore would probably not be of interest for open pit 
exploitation.  
 
Drill hole Myr 07-011 is located approximately 500 m west of Myrviken 78-005, on the 400 m grid and 
drilled to a depth of 196.3 metres. An upper layer of Alum Shale returned values of 0.37 lbs/ton U3O8, 
6.0 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.75 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.65 lbs/ton Ni, and a lower layer returned values of of 0.29 
lbs/ton U3O8, 5.4 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.72 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.65 lbs/ton Ni. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-012 is located approximately 800 m west of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 78-005 in 
the central part of the Viken Licence and was drilled to a depth of 199.7 m. Black shale occurs in 
three separate zones between 48-56 m, 109-122 m and 154-179 m for a total of 65 metres. The U3O8 
contents of 0.37-0.39 lbs/ton are consistent with what is expected in the area. The V2O5 is somewhat 
low in the range of 3.2 -5.0 lbs/ton. The MoO3contents of 0.66-0.97 lbs/ton are somewhat erratic while 
the values for Ni (0.69-0.71 lbs/ton) is consistent for the area. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-013 is located approximately 350 meters north of Myr 07-012 in the central part of 
the Viken Licence and was drilled to a depth of 194.3 m. The black shale occurs in a single horizon 
from 7-190 m for a thickness of 183 m. All metal contents are comparable with results from the 
nearby Myr 07-012 drill hole. The U3O8 content of 0.34 lbs/ton is consistent with what is expected in 
the area. The V2O5 is consistent at 5.7 lbs/ton. The MoO3 0.76 lbs/ton is also consistent and the Ni 
0.66 lbs/ton is as expected. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-014 is located on the 400 m grid approximately 800 m NNW of the SGU drill hole 
Myrviken 78-005 and represents the most northerly hole drilled to date. The black shale occurs in a 
single horizon from 3-190 m for a 187 m thick unit. All metal contents are consistent with values in 
neighbouring drill holes Myr 07-013 and Myr 07-023. A U3O8 content of 0.36 lbs/ton, a V2O5 content of 
5.3 lbs/ton, and a MoO3 content of 0.83 lbs/ton and Ni content of 0.59 lbs/ton were recorded in this 
hole. This drill hole needs to be extended since the hole was stopped prematurely in black shale and 
a greater thickness of mineralised rock is possible. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-015 is located approximately 400 m northwest of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 78-005 
and is on the 400 m grid. This is an infill hole between Myr 06-002 and Myr 07-013.The black shale 
occurs in two zones 6-162 m and 178-192 m. The uppermost zone of 156 meters thick is the most 
important, showing a U3O8 content of 0.32 lbs/ton, a V2O5 content of 5.6 lbs/ton, a MoO3 content of 



Continental, Viken MSS

0.73 lbs/ton and a Ni content of 0.68 lbs/ton. The lower Alum Shale unit is 14.5 m thick and contains 
slightly lower values of 0.32 lbs/ton U3O8, 3.4 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.6 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.54 lbs/ton Ni. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-016 is located in the south central part of the Viken Licence area. The black shale 
occurs in two zones between 40-72 m and 157-203 metres. Metal contents in the upper horizon were 
found to be 0.05 lbs/ton U3O8, 1.0 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.16 lbs/ton MoO3, and 0.15 lbs/ton Ni. In the lower 
horizon metal contents of 0.35 lbs/ton U3O8, 4.1 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.08 lbs/ton MoO3, and 0.65 lbs/ton Ni 
are recorded. This drill hole needs to be extended since the hole was stopped prematurely in black 
shale and a greater thickness of mineralised rock is possible 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-017 located approximately 1,100 m southwest of Myrviken 78-005 intersected 59.8 
m of Alum Shale in the interval 153 to 212.8 m, below a capping of mixed black shale, grey shale and 
limestone. Analytical results indicate metal contents of 0.29 lbs/ton U3O8, 3.8 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.61 
lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.63 lbs/ton Ni. In Myr 07-017 uranium and vanadium values are low between 70 to 
90 m, and are appreciably higher in the 164 to 196 m section. This section of low uranium and 
vanadium values appears to be related to the presence of a thrusted sheet of Middle Cambrian Alum 
Shale, which typically contains lower values.  
 
Drill hole Myr 07-018 is possibly located off the MMS Viken Licence and was designed to test for the 
southern extension of the deposit. This drill site occurs close to the southern border of the license and 
the black shale occurs between 158-194 m depth. The U3O8 content of 0.31 lbs/ton is lower than what 
is expected in the area as is the V2O5 content of 3.3 lbs/ton. The MoO3 content of 0.74 lbs/ton and the 
Ni content of 0.51 lbs/ton is consistent with metal values recorded in holes located farther north.  
 
Diamond drill hole Myr 07-020 is located approximately 950 m south of Myrviken 78-005 and 400 m 
east of Myr 07-017 and was drilled to a depth of 224.17 m. The hole collared in Alum Shale and 
encountered grey shale at a depth of 219.25 m. Analytical data indicate metal contents of 0.35 lbs/ton 
U3O8, 7.15 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.71 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.50 lbs/ton Ni over a true thickness of 212.8 m. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-021 is located approximately 550 m southwest of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 78-005 
in the southeast quadrant of the licence. The Alum Shale outcrops at this drill site and is covered with 
a 6 m thick mantle of till. Mineralization was sampled between 6-173 m (167 m thick) and contains 
average amounts of metals. The concentrations are 0.42 lbs/ton U3O8, 6.4 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.93 lbs/ton 
MoO3, and 0.82 lbs/ton Ni. This hole can be viewed as an infill hole between Myrviken 78-005 and 
Myr 07-20 and displaying a significant thickness and better than average grade.  
 
Drill hole Myr 07-022 is located approximately 400 m west-southwest of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 
78-005 and is on the 400 m grid. The mineralized black shale is covered with a thin mantle of till and 
is continuous over 190 m between 5-195 m. The U3O8 content of 0.36 lbs/ton, 5.1 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.71 
lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.65 lbs/ton Ni are similar to adjacent drill holes. 
 
Drill hole Myr 06-023 is approximately 800 m north of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 78-005 and is on 
the 400 m grid. Similar to Myr 07-014 this hole tests the northern continuation of the mineralization. 
Values of 0.34 lbs/ton U3O8, 3.2 lbs/ton V2O5, 0.73 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.64 lbs/ton Ni are recorded in 
this drill hole. The results also indicate that the mineralization is open to the north.  
 
Drill hole Myr 07-024 is located approximately 400 m south of the SGU drill hole Myrviken 78-005 and 
is located on the 400 m grid. The mineralized black shale starts at 10 m and continues to 211 m, 
which is one of the thickest drilled in the black shale horizon. Analysis indicate a U3O8 content of 0.42 
lbs/ton, a V2O5 content of 6.6 lbs/ton, a MoO3 content of 0.94 lbs/ton and a Ni content of 0.83 lbs/ton. 
 
Drill hole Myr 07-025 is located in the southeastern part of the MMS Viken Licence and was drilled to 
a depth of 206.75 m. The upper mineralised Alum shale occurs between 115-154 m, and again 
between 180-199 m separated by a large wedge of limestone. The U3O8 content of 0.38 lbs/ton 
typical of the area as is the V2O5 content of 5.0 lbs/ton. The MoO3 content of 0.91 lbs/ton is higher 
than usual and the Ni content of 0.77 lbs/ton is normal.

An interpretation of the drill results indicates that the most metaliferous and thickest portion of the 
outcropping Alum Shale trends north-northwest along strike from Myrviken 78-005. In the vicinity of 
holes Myr 07-001, 002 and 003 the Alum Shale was encountered at depths exceeding 50 m 
suggesting the possibility that the probable edge of open pit extractable Alum Shale has been 
delineated in this area.  
 

12.0 Sampling Method and Approach 
 
All core logging and core splitting was completed in a single secure core handling facility. Initially the 
core from the 2006 drill holes was logged and sampled by Geoforum personnel while splitting was 
contracted to Taiga Exploration Drilling AB. However the majority of the 2006 core was logged 
sampled and sawn by Geoforum personnel. All of the 2007 drill cores were processed by Geoforum 
personnel. 
 
The distance between the depth markers added by the drill personnel was measured to check for 
misplaced markers and for lost core. All logging information was recorded directly onto paper logging 
forms. Core intervals identified for sampling were marked with wax crayons, with sample tags placed 
at the start of a sample interval. 
 
The sample length was generally two metres, and individual samples were not allowed to cross 
lithologic contacts or abrupt changes in mineralization. Core was quarter split using a diamond saw. 
Where possible, contiguous sample tag series were used for core logging. Sample intervals were 
recorded on sample tag books, marked on core boxes and later recorded in computerized drill logs. 
 
The author is not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability of 
the core samples. Examination of drill logs does not indicate any significant sections of lost core or 
reduced core recovery, except in weathered surface bedrock.  
 
The invisible nature of the potentially economic mineralization necessitates the sampling of the entire 
Alum Shale intercept. The relatively wide variation in the distribution of the metal concentrations 
within the Alum Shale occurs over 10s of metres, and the use of 2 m samples is appropriate and 
ensures that representative mineralization is being sampled and reflected in the analytical results. 
 

13.0 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 
Sample preparation by Geoforum personnel prior to dispatch consisted of placing quarter split core 
samples in plastic sample bags, recording sample numbers, sealing the shipping bags and noting 
shipment particulars.  
 
Security of samples was maintained by using a secure core handling facility located on fenced private 
land. Samples awaiting dispatch to the assay laboratory were stored in this secured building and 
accessible only to authorized persons. Individual samples were placed in shipping bags, which in turn 
were sealed with plastic tie straps and the shipping bags remained sealed until they were open by 
assay laboratory personnel.  
 
Analyses of the samples were performed at two laboratories: ALS Analytica AB in Luleå, Sweden and 
ALS Chemex in Öjebyn Sweden. Both laboratories have ISO 9001: 2000 accreditation. Sample 
management at both laboratories employs bar coding to track samples and thereby maintain the 
integrity of the samples.

Analytica AB sample preparation procedures include crushing the entire sample to 70% passing a 9 
mesh screen followed by splitting of an approximately 250 gm sample for pulverization to 85% 
passing a 200 mesh screen. Crushing and pulverization apparatus are cleaned between each sample 
with a quartz sand wash. A 5 gm sample is split from the pulverized sub sample and digested in a 
four acid solution to accomplish a "near total" dissolution. Twelve major oxides and seventeen trace 
elements were determined by a combination of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) techniques. 
Carbon (total), sulphur and "Loss on Ignition" were determined with a Leco Furnace. Carbonate 
carbon was determined by coulometer. Pulps and rejects are stored in accordance with client 
requests. 
 
ALS Chemex procedures include crushing of the entire sample to 70% passing a 2 mm screen 
followed by splitting off a 200 to 250 gm sub sample for pulverization to 80% passing a 75 micron 
screen. A four acid digestion of an approximate 5 gm sub sample provided a "near total" dissolution of 
the sample. Determination of 48 elements including twelve major oxide elements and sulphur was 
accomplished by ICP-MS techniques, with carbon (total), carbon (organic) determined by using a 
Leco Furnace. Determination of carbonate carbon was by a coulometer. Pulps and rejects are stored 
in accordance with client requests. 
 
Blank and standard samples of Alum Shale are not available for insertion into sample batches. 
Continental relies on the internal standards employed in the laboratories to monitor analytical 
precision. Consequently the accuracy and precision of the analytical values cannot be examined in 
detail. 
 
GAHA is of the opinion that the core has been adequately sampled and that the sample preparation 
follows exploration best practices. GAHA is also of the opinion that security of the samples is 
uncompromised.  
 

14.0 Data Verification 
 
One author (GAHA) collected two samples of Alum Shale for due diligence purposes. The samples 
were submitted by the author to ALS Chemex in Öjebyn via postal service. A comparison with 
analytical results from previously submitted drill core samples is presented in the following table.  
 
Table 6 Comparisons of Analytical Results

Myr 07-020, 208-210 m 109 774 159 153 
Variance (%) 0.9 19.4 14.0 44.6 
 
The variances in results for uranium are within acceptable limits, whereas the variance associated 
with the other three elements shows a wide divergence of accuracy. The variance associated with 
the two samples in this test of accuracy may not be representative of the whole analytical database. 
However the results suggest that the accuracy of analytical results associated with V, Mo and Ni 
need to be quantified.  
 
The thirteen duplicate pair sample results used to construct Figure 8 indicate a variance of 3.6% for 
uranium analyses. This result supports uranium variance reported in Table 6, but does not consider 
variance associated with the other elements.

For QA/QC purposes, every 25th sample was sent to a second laboratory for uranium re-analysis. 
Analyses were performed by ALS Chemex in Öjebyn and ALS Analytica in Luleå, Sweden. The 
correlation between the thirteen original and second uranium analysis is 96.8%, indicating no 
significant analytical problems for uranium requiring corrective actions (Figure 8).  
 
A major component of the data verification program on the Viken MMS Licence consisted of drilling 
hole Myr 06-002, 30 metres south of historical drill hole Myrviken 78-005 and analyzing the core. The 
results show excellent correlation for both spatial distribution (Figure 9) and values for uranium (Table 
4) indicating that the historical uranium data can be relied upon.  

Inter-laboratory accuracy was also explored because two laboratories were used to generate 
analytical results. A total of 128 samples were analyzed at each laboratory. The resultant data 
indicates no significant bias exists for U3O8 and V2O5 values. A significant bias exists however for 
MoO3 (10.5%) and Ni values (45.2%). Accordingly, approximately 20% of the data for MoO3 and Ni 
sent to one laboratory may need to be re-analysed prior to a preliminary feasibility study.

analytical certificates data with the composite data for all drill holes used for the inferred resource 
estimation. 
 
GAHA has no reason to believe that the data as presented for uranium is not an accurate 
representation of facts at this stage of exploration on the MMS licences. However the accuracy and 
precision for other metallic elements remains to be examined and documented. 
 

15.0 Adjacent Properties 
 
There are no adjacent properties near or adjacent to the Viken MMS Licence. 
 

16.0 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
Continental has commenced mineral processing and metallurgical tests which are to continue for a 
year to determine the appropriate mineral dressing techniques to recover the uranium, vanadium, 
molybdenum or nickel mineralization in material from the Viken MMS Licence.  
 
Historical research on metallurgical characteristics of the Alum Shale appears in summary form in 
Andersson (1985). The research was undertake by the National Bureau of Mines for the SGU, which 
indicates that approximately 89-93% of the uranium, 15-17% of the molybdenum, 60-70% of the 
vanadium and approximately 66% of the nickel can be recovered using conventional leaching 
techniques. Details of this research conducted at the Ranstad facility are not available for perusal by 
the authors. 
 

17.0 Mineral Resource Estimate 

17.1 Introduction 
 
Mineral resource estimation described in this technical report for the Viken project follows the 
guidelines set forth in NI 43-101. The modeling and estimation of resources were done by Mr. F.H 
Brown, a qualified person with respect to mineral resource estimation as defined by NI 43-101. 
 
Information and data were supplied by the Corporation. F.H Brown has not independently verified this 
data. The statement and opinions expressed in this report are given in good faith and in the belief that 
such statements and opinions are not false or misleading at the date of this report. A draft copy of this 
report has been reviewed for factual errors by the Corporation and this report has been based on 
Continental Precious Minerals' historical and current knowledge of the property. Additional data and 
exploration results may subsequently affect some calculations, conclusions and recommendations 
going forward.

17.2 Database 
 
Data were supplied in the form of a Gemcom Access database containing a total of twenty-eight drill 
holes (Table 5) and (Figure 10) and SGU hole Myrviken 78-005. A local topographic model of 
unknown resolution covering the project area was also supplied, as well as property boundary 
coordinates. 
 
Database fields include collar easting, northing and elevation coordinates, lithological information, 
and uranium (U), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) assay data. All assay 
data were provided in parts-per-million (ppm). One drill hole (Myr78-005) did not have Ni or Zn assay 
data. 
 
Spacing between drill holes varies between ~6m and ~460m. Collar coordinates were surveyed by 
the Corporation using a hand-held GPS unit, with the elevation corrected to local topographic 
information of unknown resolution. 
 
Interval data were validated in Gemcom, and no discrepancies were noted. 
 

17.3 Lithological Model 
 
A three-dimensional geological model was constructed based on six lithological units defined by the 
supplied lithological logs (Table 7). Lithological units were delineated on east-west cross-sections 
spaced every twenty-five meters across the project property. Polygonal nodes were snapped directly 
to lithological contacts in order to generate a true three-dimensional representation of the deposit 
geology (Figure 11). Wireframe models and surfaces representing the topography, overburden, 
limestone, Grey Shale and Central Alum Shale unit were then constructed (Figure 12). The principle 
mineralization is constrained to the Central Alum Shale, although mineralized lenses were also 
observed in the Mixed Shale units. Resource estimation was therefore confined to the Central Alum 
Shale unit.

17.4 Composting 
 
The average assay sample length within the Central Alum Shale unit is 2.02m, with 93% of the 
assays having a sample length of 2.0m. Assays were therefore composited to 2.0m length-weighted 
intervals within the Central Alum Shale unit in order to achieve a uniform sample support. 
 

17.5 Summary Statistics 
 
Five grade-elements were defined for the Viken resource: uranium (U), vanadium (V), molybdenum 
(Mo), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). Summary statistics were examined for the Central Alum Shale naïve 
assay data set (Table 8) and for the Central Alum Shale two-meter composite data set (Table 9) for 
each grade-element. A comparison of the naïve means and composite means demonstrates that no 
bias has occurred due to the compositing process. 
 
Histograms of the Central Alum Shale composite data sets indicate the presence of mixed 
populations, suggesting that additional resource delineation will be required to increase the 
confidence of the resource estimate (Figure 9). 
 
Correlations between metal grades were examined for the Central Alum Shale assay data set. Mo, Ni 
and U displayed a strong correlation, with V displaying a moderate correlation with all elements. No 
correlation between Zn and Mo, Zn and Ni or Zn and U is apparent (Table 10).

17.6 Grade Capping 
 
Extreme values were identified for each grade-element within all domains from the examination of 
inflection points in Mean & CV plots generated from composite data within the Central Alum Shale 
unit (Figure 14). The values derived from the Mean & CV plots were then used as thresholds on 
composite data in order to reduce the impact of high-grade outlier values during block interpolation. 
During estimation composite grades were capped to the values given in Table 11. 
 
Table 11. Capping Levels for the Central Alum Shale. 
 

Grade-Element Capping Level 
Mo 350 ppm 
Ni 450 ppm 
U 220 ppm 
V 2750 ppm 
Zn 600 ppm 

 

17.7 Grade Continuity 
 
Snowden Supervisor version 7.10 was used for continuity analysis. Variogram fans and experimental 
semivariograms derived from composite data within the Central Alum Shale unit were examined for 
each individual grade-element (Figure 15). Although the current drill hole spacing is too sparse to 
allow accurate modeling of medium and long range structures, the low CV of the sample populations 
and the semivariograms demonstrate potential grade continuity across the deposit and suggest that 
drilling on a 100m x 100m grid would be sufficient to raise the overall confidence level of the estimate.

17.8 Bulk Density 
 
No density information was available for resource estimation. Harron (2007) references a density 
value attributed to the Swedish Geological Survey of 2.51 t/m3 for the Alum Shale. For estimation 
purposes a density of 2.51 t/m3 was assumed for all lithological units, and 1.9 t/m3 for overburden. 
 

17.9 Resource Modeling 
 
Three-dimensional modeling methods and parameters were used in accordance with principles 
meeting Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum recommended guidelines (CIM 
2005). Gemcom version 4.11 software was used for establishing the block model and subsequent 
grade estimation. Block model limits as defined for resource modeling purposes are given in Table 
12. 
 
Table 12. Block Model Setup 
 

 Origin Block Size Number of Blocks 
Easting 1426600 25m 76 
Northing 6988700 25m 88 
Elevation 400 10m 30 

 
Each grade-element was estimated separately for blocks within the defined block model limits for the 
Central Alum Shale. A sixth NSR grade-element was then calculated based on the U, V, Mo and Ni 
block values using the parameters given in Table 13. Commodity prices are based on conservative 
long-term forecasts, and theoretical recovery percentages were taken from Andersson et. al. (1985).

Price USD 55.00/lb USD 12.00/lb USD 55.00/lb USD 5.00/lb 
Recovery 15% 66% 90% 65% 
 
Block grades were estimated with a single pass Inverse Distance Cubed (ID3) calculation. A 
minimum of two samples and a maximum of twelve samples were used, collected within a spherical 
search volume with a radius of 500m. Composite grade values were capped prior to estimation 
according to the capping values given in Section 17.6. 
 

17.10 Resource Classification 
Global mineral resources were classified in accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM 2005). A reasonable continuity of grade across the 
Central Alum Shale is demonstrated by the drill holes; however, due to the complex geological model, 
limited number of drill holes, and lack of density and collar survey information, the resource has been 
classified as Inferred in its entirety. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative 
geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 
categorized as mineral reserves. CIM 2005 defines an Inferred resource as:- 
 
An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.

17.11 Resource Estimate 
 
A previous resource estimate for the Viken property was published in Harron 2007, based on a 100

Note: the above mineral resource estimate was prepared under the supervision of a Qualified 
Person as defined by NI43-101. FH Brown has not independently verified the mineral resource 
estimate, and makes no assurances as to the validity or economic viability of any of the stated 
mineral resources, in whole or in part. 
 

For this updated resource estimate, resources were defined as those blocks falling within a Whittle™ 
optimized pit derived from the economic parameters listed in Table 15. Mining and processing costs 
were based on order-of-magnitude estimates of costs from similar open-pit mining operations. The 
optimized pit was further constrained to remain within the Viken property boundaries (Figure 16). A 
break-even cutoff grade of USD 7.50 was selected for resource reporting based on the listed costs. 
Grades for U, V and Mo were then converted to standardized oxide units for reporting purposes. The 
updated global resource estimate is listed in Table 15.

18.0 Other Relevant Data and Information 
 
There is to the authors' knowledge no additional data or information, of either a positive or negative 
aspect, that would change the data presented or the contained recommended program. 
 

19.0 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
The Viken MMS Licence is located in an area with well-developed infrastructure and a moderate 
climate which will minimize future development costs. 
 
Caledonide tectonic events dominated by north-northwest trending folds and east-northeast directed 
thrusting resulted in imbrication of Alum Shale nappe slices into a thick section (approximately 180-
200 m) of metaliferous strata. Erosion and glaciation have removed some of the cover rock resulting 
in both Alum Shale exposed at surface, or covered with a thin layer of lower Ordovician limestone 
over a strike length of approximately 3 km on the Viken MMS Licence. This suggests the potential to 
exploit the deposit by open pit mining methods. Regional geological considerations suggest a 
potential to define other near surface Alum Shale deposits north and south of the Viken MSS Licence 
over a distance of approximately 20 km. 
 
Initial drilling focused on step out drilling near historical diamond drill hole Myrviken 78-005 in order to 
test the continuity, thickness and grade of the Alum Shale. Interest in this area was generated by the 
presence of 181 m of tectonically thickened Alum Shale containing potentially economic uranium, 
vanadium, molybdenum and nickel values. Results indicate both geological and analytical continuity 
over distances of up to 300 m. Current drilling on a 400 m grid, commencing with diamond drill hole 
Myr-07-001, has a focus on delineating the extent of Alum Shale that is both outcropping and metal-
rich.  
 
Diamond drill information to date suggests that a north-northwest-trending zone approximately 1,000 
m wide traverses the entire Viken MMS Licence (approximately 3 km) is underlain by Alum Shale 
exposed at surface. Peripheral to this zone a relatively thin layer of Ordovician limestone caps the 
Alum Shale. Based on regional geology the Alum Shale (with a thin limestone cap or exposed at 
surface) continues both north and south of the Viken MMS Licence over a strike length of 
approximately 20 kms.  
 
Areas of uncertainty revolve around the adequacy of the data base and the accuracy of analyses 
related to vanadium, molybdenum and nickel concentrations. Drill collar locations are defined by hand 
held GPS readings information, leading to horizontal errors of approximately 6 m. Similarly drill hole 
trajectories have not been surveyed, consequently drill core samples may be displaced by a few 
metres from their intended locations.  
 
A test of the analytical accuracy of results for uranium, vanadium, molybdenum and nickel indicate 
that the results for uranium are both accurate and precise. However, wide variations in accuracy 
(Table 6) are associated with the other three metals, indicating that further investigations of the 
variances are required, and corrective measures to mitigate the uncertainty is necessary. 
 
An examination of the analytical data from individual drill holes shows a noticeable variation of metal 
contents over distances of 25 to 100 m (Table 5). This variability is probably due to the distribution of 
upper Cambrian and Middle Cambrian nappe slices being sampled. The dimensions of these nappes 
with differing metal contents are currently unknown.  
 
Currently available analytical results from 28 diamond drill holes plus SGU hole Myrviken 78-005 
indicate an inferred resource of 685 million tons of Alum Shale grading 0.34 lbs/ton U3O8, 5.83 lbs/ton

 45

V2O5, 0.73 lbs/ton MoO3 and 0.61 lbs/ton Ni in an area representing approximately 40% of the surface 
area of the Viken MMS Licence. This suggests that additional drilling both north and south of the 
presently defined resource could enhance the volume of the resource.  
 

20.0 Recommendations 
 
GAHA is of the opinion that the character of the property is of sufficient merit to justify the 
proposed program as outlined below. The property is in an advanced stage of development 
and results to date suggest a significant exploration potential remains to be identified. 
 
A proposed program consisting of 17,000 m of diamond drilling supported by a $ 3,600,000 budget is 
recommended to further delineate the mineralization on the Viken MMS Licence.  
 
It is recommended that the grid drilling, at 100 m centers replace the existing 400 m grid drilling in 
order to refine the dimensions and grade of Alum Shale that may be potentially exploited by open pit 
mining techniques. 
 
It is also recommended that a method be devised to distinguish upper from middle Cambrian Alum 
Shale, as there is historical data indicating that the upper Cambrian age Alum Shale is more enriched 
in metals than the middle Cambrian Alum Shale. 
 
It is further recommended that an environmental baseline study be initiated to characterize the 
existing features of the air, water and soil both on the Viken MMS Licence and in the surrounding 
area. 
 
Enhancements to the database include recommendations that up to 10% of the original analytical 
data for metals other than uranium be re-analyzed in order to examine the accuracy of the current 
database. The analytical data pertaining to the uranium content appears to be robust in terms of 
accuracy and precision. 
 
To provide integrity to the database a comprehensive QA/QC program should be implemented, 
including an appraisal of the analytical techniques used to date. This may involve the creation of a 
standard sample of Alum Shale prepared from rock sourced from the property.  
 
The spatial parameters associated with sample locations needs to be further constrained by both  
 
Accurate surveying of drill hole collars and trajectories of the drill holes is recommended in order to 
provide additional accuracy of future resource / reserve estimations.
