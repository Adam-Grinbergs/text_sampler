Sirocco Mining Inc                           Aguas Blancas Property Technical Report 
 

 

 

                                                                                         6                                                                            19 December 2013 

  

1 SUMMARY  

 
1.1 Introduction and Overview 
 
This updated Technical Report on the Aguas Blancas Property ("Aguas Blancas"), located in the II Region in 
northern Chile, was prepared by Sirocco Mining Inc following the announcement made in November 2013 to 
delay the commissioning of the SAG mill in the Agitated Leach Plant and to only operate heap leach pads. This 
will reduce annual production to approximately 1,000t of iodine in 2014.  

This work was completed by Kevin Ross, Chief Operating Officer of Sirocco, a qualified mining engineer and 
Hugh Stuart, Vice President of Exploration of Sirocco and a qualified geologist. Adam Wheeler, an independent 
qualified mining engineer, has continued to provide the resource and reserve estimate for the Aguas Blancas 
Property.   

A site visit in connection with this work was completed by Kevin Ross between 12th and 15th November 2013 
by Hugh Stuart between 17th June and 24th June 2013 and by Adam Wheeler from 15th to 19th October, 2012.  
Estimates in this report relate to 31st December, 2012. 

The scope of work entailed review of all pertinent geological and mining data, allowing the preparation of an 
updated mineral resource and reserve estimate  and to update the operational aspects of the Aguas Blancas 
Mine. 

1.2 Ownership 
 
Aguas Blancas mining property comprises 35 "estacas salitreras" covering 7,478 ha and 247 registered mining 
concessions, covering 45,627 ha. The estacas salitreras are irregularly shaped concessions granted before 1907. 
In addition there are 6 exploitation concessions covering 906 ha in the application process, and 49 exploration 
concessions covering 13,900 ha. There are 11 disputed mining concessions covering 950 ha, which are being 
reviewed by the courts for resolution. The Aguas Blancas iodine deposit is located near the centre of the 
Property. 

The Property is legally registered in the name of Atacama Minerals Chile S.C.M. ("AMC"), and is free of 
mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions, injunctions and litigation. The mining patents are paid and up to date.  

AMC has 14 boreholes located in two aquifers (Rosario and Aguas Blancas) covering 320km2 and is permitted 
to extract 165.7 l/s. AMC leases an additional eight bores from Universidad de Atacama and Xstrata, which are 
permitted to extract 40.0 l/s. The current extraction rates are 53 l/s from Rosario and 44 l/s from Aguas Blancas 
aquifers. 

AMC is the titleholder of three easements for the use of surface lands required for the adequate development, 
operation and exploitation of the Aguas Blancas project.  The surface rights include 5,566 ha in the plant and 
mining areas, as well as a 70 km x 25 m easement for water pipeline, a 1,260 m x 36 m easement for an airport 
and a 26.5 km x 15m easement for a power line. An application to expand the operational area is currently being 
developed. 

In 1997, Atacama prepared and presented an Environmental Impact Study for the Aguas Blancas project to the 
Regional Commission of the Environment (COREMA), which issued the Exempt Resolution Nr.012 of August 
7, 1997 in favour of Atacama. Atacama subsequently submitted various applications for amendments ("DIA") to 
their existing environmental permit ("EIA") to COREMA. The first was submitted on June 20th, 2000, which 
was approved through Exempt Resolution Nr. 151 of August 28, 2000. The second was presented on October 
12th, 2006, and was approved through Exempt Resolution Nº 054/2007 of February 19th 2007. Finally, the third 
DIA was filed on August 27, 2007, which was approved through Exempt Resolution Nº 014/2008 of January 9, 
2008. 

AMC submitted a DIA for a new power line to access the CDEC-SING grid. This DIA was approved through 
Exempt Resolution No. 0308/2007 on September 28th, 2007.  

No towns or populated areas fall within the boundaries of the Property. In general the local communities in 
northern Chile have a favourable attitude towards mining.

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 
 
The property is located 95km south-east of Antofagasta, Chile, on the western side of Atacama Desert, at an 
elevation between 970 and 1,230 masl.  The deposit occurs on the upper slopes of large alluvial fans and 
consists of primarily of hard salt-cemented beds, typically up to 3m thick, referred to locally as caliche.  These 
caliche beds were formed as distinct layers after the deposition of the host alluvial fan sediments, and through 
the leaching of windblown salts by infrequent rainwater, deliquescence and reworking to re-accumulate in 
enriched zones. 
   
The caliche deposits belonging to Atacama cover 67,911 Ha, extending approximately 23km in length (NW-SE) 
and 4km wide (SW-NE), occupying mostly flat areas and some hill slopes.  They are commonly overlain by 
0.2m to 1m of weakly consolidated sand and gravel, known locally as chusca, which is stripped prior to mining 
of the caliche. 
 
Atacama's deposit also includes large areas which were previously worked, known locally as Antiguos.  These 
areas were worked by hand in the 1900s for nitrates, but which still contain significant iodine, both in the 
material which was previously worked, as well as in virgin caliche material lying underneath. 
 
1.4 Database and Resource Estimation 
 
The principal means of exploration of the deposit in recent times has been by reverse circulation drilling.  
Various drilling campaigns have been completed by different companies according to their ownership of the 
property.     
 
 The current database also includes data from 18,716 drill holes for 64,801m, which were drilled by Atacama 
between 2005 and the end of 2012.   
 
Additional work completed by Atacama or by their consultants includes a hydrogeological study, an 
environmental study (EIA), reserve estimation updates, basic engineering reviews and feasibility studies. 
 
The current mineral resource estimate was prepared by Adam Wheeler using industry standard methodologies, 
conforming to the requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101.  The geological modelling work and 
corresponding resource estimation was carried out using Datamine software. 
 
The updated resource model contains estimated grades of in-situ iodine (I2), nitrate (NO3) and sulphate (SO4).  
As well as the principal 'Virgin' area, which has been the main source of caliche for recent production, the 
reworked 'Antiguos' area has also been modelled, along with other outlying caliche areas. 
 
For each of these zones, the same modelling methodology was applied.  Drill hole composites were created for 
intersections which in general cover intersections containing above 200ppm I2.  For each composite, 
accumulations were calculated of grade x thickness.  These accumulation values were subsequently interpolated 
into the block model, along with caliche thickness, and the final grades of iodine were determined for each 
block.  The resource estimation was based on a 200ppm I2 cut-off grade. 
 
Updated property boundaries were applied to the model and the limit of mining as at 31st December 2012.  
Density measurements which have been derived from mine reconciliation studies have been applied. 
 
It should also be noted that the deposit has not been totally drilled off.  Additional exploration drilling may add 
to the geologic resource and subsequent reserves.   
 
1.5 Mine and Plant Operation 
 
The general process consists of: 

• Surface mining by continuous miner of caliche ores 
• Processing by Heap Leach or Agitated Leach Plant (ALP) to produce iodate rich brines 
• Chemical concentration of brines 
• Electrochemical reduction 
• Crystallisation – fusion to produce iodine prills

1.5.1 Mining Operations 
 
Stripping of the overburden (approximately 0.5m thick) is carried out using a bulldozer, and accumulated at the 
sides of the mining block. The continuous miner takes a 0.4m cut of the caliche. Material which is destined for 
the ALP is screened to provide -6mm fines and +6mm coarse material. The material is loaded using front end 
loaders into 60t trucks, which haul the material to the heap leach pads (coarse) or the ALP (fines).  

1.5.2 Processing Operations  
 
The three most significant components of the caliche are iodine, sodium sulphate and sodium nitrate. These salts 
are soluble in water at ambient temperature.  In the heap leaching process the iodine recovery is estimated as 
being 60% and in the ALP as 88%. The iodine plant recovery is estimated at 91%, producing an overall iodine 
recovery of 55% for heaps and 80% for ALP.  

The heap leach pads are built on an impermeable geo-membrane, covering an area between 25,000 to 30,000m2, 
with heights averaging 10m containing approximately 450,000t. Drainage pipes are laid on the membrane and 
covered by the mined ore. The heaps are irrigated initially with bore water and at the end of the heap life with a 
mixture of bore water and feble (a residual solution from the chemical plant) at a rate of approximately 1.75 
l/m2/hr.  

The ALP has been placed on care and maintenance and is scheduled to restart in mid 2015. The ALP comprises 
a slurry plant and screen to produce -3.5mm, with the oversize being returned to the heap leach pads. The -
3.5mm material is leached in 4 leach tanks and the brine clarified through 4 thickeners operating as a 
countercurrent circuit. The throughput of the slurry plant is limited to approximately 150 tonnes per hour. A 
SAG mill is due to be installed which will enable processing of the full size range of mined product to produce -
1mm feed for the leach section. The throughput of the leach section is designed to be 400 tonnes per hour. An 
Improheat heater enables the temperature of the brine to be raised to assist in dissolution of the salts. 

1.5.3 Chemical Plant 
 
The brine solution from the heaps and ALP is accumulated in lined ponds for feed to the iodine recovery plant. 
The brine is mixed with SO2 to reduce the iodate in solution to iodine gas in the "acid" leg of the Blow-Out 
Tower. The iodine gas is blown over to the "caustic" tower where it is adsorbed in NaOH solution. The solution 
is concentrated by recirculation until reaching a concentration of 80g/l of iodine.  

The concentrated caustic solution is pumped to a crystallizer in the Fusion Plant. Iodine crystallization is an 
exothermic chemical reaction from the interaction of sulphuric acid with the concentrated solution of iodine 
(which is contained in a caustic solution). The crystallized iodine is heated to 114°C where the iodine changes 
from a solid to a liquid state during the 12 hours of melt. The molten iodine is dripped through a water-cooled 
column, producing prills of an average size of 2mm to 3mm. 

The solid iodine is fed to a rotary dryer, where a vacuum line recovers the sublimated iodine for re-processing. 
The dryer discharge is sent to a storage silo, from which the material is screened and packed as prills in 25 or 
50kg containers for shipment by 20' containers to the customers. 

1.6 Conclusions  
 
The evaluation work was carried out and prepared in compliance with NI43-101, as well as according to the 
guidelines of the Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.  The updated resource 
estimation of all modelled zones, for iodine resources, is shown in Table 1-1. The resource incorporates all of 
the available drill hole data, for a cut-off grade of 200ppm I2 as of 31

st December 2012. No mining factors, such 
as dilution or mining recovery have been applied to these resource figures, but they are based on a minimum 
thickness of 0.5m.

enabled updated mining factors to be calculated, which were then applied in subsequent reserve calculations.  
The reserves were derived by blocking out those areas of measured and indicated resources at a cut-off of 
250ppm I2.  This breakeven cut-off was derived from budgeted cost levels for 2013, for both heap leach and 
agitated leach processing operations.

 An additional 40Mt of Inferred material at economic grades is also modelled 
In the authors' opinion, given that the Aguas Blancas mine has been operating since 2001 and that the operating 
factors are well established, the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate are well supported. 
 
The authors recommend: 

• Continuation of conversion of inferred resources is completed to enable determination of the full life of 
mine. A budget of US$ 5.2m has been included in the current Life of Mine plan. 

• Investigations are continued to determine the viability of nitrate production.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 
4.1 Property Ownership 
 
Chile's mining policy is based on legal provisions that were enacted as part of the 1980 constitution. These were 
established to stimulate the development of mining and to guarantee the property rights of both local and foreign 
investors. The Chilean state owns all mineral resources, but exploration and exploitation of these resources by 
private parties is permitted through mining concessions, which are granted by the courts. The concessions have 
both rights and obligations, as defined by the Mining Code enacted in 1983. Concessions can be freely 
mortgaged or transferred, and the holder has full ownership rights and is entitled to obtain the rights of way for 
exploration and exploitation. In addition, the concession holder has the right to defend their ownership against 
state and third parties. A concession is obtained by a claim application and includes all minerals that may exist 
within its area. 

AMC is the titleholder of three easements for the use of surface lands that were constituted in accordance with 
the provisions of the Chilean Mining Code, comprising the lands required for the adequate development, 
operation and exploitation of the Aguas Blancas mine.  The surface rights include 5,566 ha in the plant and 
mining areas, as well as a 70 km x 25 m strip for water pipeline, a 1.26 km x 36 m strip for an airport and a 26.5 
km x 15m strip for power lines. 

4.2 Property Location 
 
Aguas Blancas is located approximately 1,600 km north of Santiago, Chile, and 75 km southeast of the port city 
of Antofagasta (Figure 4-1). The Property lies within the Antofagasta Province, II Region, at a latitude of 
approximately 24°8'S and longitude 69°53'W.The elevation at the Property varies between 970 and 1,230 masl.

4.5 Environmental and Socio-Economic Issues 
 
Chile's primary Environmental Law Nº 19.300 regulates environmental activities covering environment, air and 
water quality and emission standards. The law was amended in 2010 by Law 20.417, creating a new statutory 
framework.  

Law N° 19.300 requires an Environmental Impact Assessment System (EIAS) prior to the execution or 
modification of a public or private project or activity and is complemented by Decree 40/2013 ("Decree"), 
which provides the new regulatory framework applicable to the EIAS.  

Under the Chilean environmental regulation depending on the extension or magnitude of the environmental 
impact, there are two types of environmental reviews:  

• Environmental Impact Assessment (Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental, "EIA").   
• Environmental Impact Statement (Declaración de Impacto Ambiental, "DIA") 

 
Exploration for minerals is exempted from the filing of either a DIA or an EIA.  
 
An EIA is required when the proposed activities has an impact greater than the criteria defined by law and 
regulation. The EIA report includes a detailed description of the upcoming exploration program or study, a 
program for compliance with the environmental legislation, a baseline study, a detailed description of the 
possible impacts and an assessment of how they would be mitigated, a plan for compensation (if required), 
details of a follow-up program, a description of the EIA presentation, and an appendix with all of the supporting 
documentation.  

A DIA is prepared in cases when the proposed activities have a low environmental impact according to the 
criteria defined by law and regulation. The DIA includes a statement from the applicant declaring that the 
project will comply with the current environmental legislation, a detailed description of the type of planned

                                                                                         17                                                                            19 December 2013 

  

activities, including any voluntary environmental commitments that might be completed during the project, and 
an indication of the sectoral environmental permits applicable.  

Once an application is made, the Commission or the Executive Director of the Servicio de Evaluación de 
Impacto Ambiental ("SEA"), depending on the case, will take a maximum of 120 days to conclude the review. 
The evaluation process considers the opinion of various government agencies and the public.  

Law 20.417 as revised in 2010, requires citizen participation and indigenous consultation as described in ILO 
Convention 169, where any person can present observations to the EIA in the first 60 days of the 120 day legal 
term. If explanations, rectifications or extensions are suggested by the Commission, citizens have an additional 
30 day period to present observations, in which case the legal term will be suspended. The indigenous 
participation requires the incorporation of exclusive participation aspects for indigenous people to ensure the 
cultural pertinence of their participation. 

If the activity or project complies with all the environmental requirements, SEA grants the environmental 
authorization (RCA), which means that the project or activity is authorized to be executed and acquire all 
necessary permits required to conduct the mining operation. The project has to be initiate within five years of 
the granting of the RCA. 

4.6 Other Factors and Risks 
 
By public deed dated March 14, 2002, AMC acquired from Inversiones Vasa Limitada the totality of the rights 
in a royalty that encumbered the Properties. As a consequence of this purchase, the aforementioned royalty was

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE, PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1 Accessibility 

  
The Property is located in the intermediary depression of the Chilean Atacama Desert. Access to the mine is via 
55km of paved and 36km of unpaved road from the northern Chilean port city of Antofagasta (estimated 
population 300,000).  Antofagasta is currently serviced from Santiago by regular daily domestic flights.  

5.2 Climate 
 
The normal desert climate is characterized by a very low relative humidity, virtual lack of precipitation, 
practically no oceanic influence and clear skies during the whole year. The average annual precipitation does not 
exceed 10 mm.  

The Atacama Desert has an average air temperature of 16.5°C. Typical maximum air temperature is 40°C, and 
minimum temperature of 5°C. Freezing temperatures are rare, but large temperature differences between day 
and night are common.  

5.3 Physiography 
 
The Property is a relatively flat area, located at the upper slopes of large alluvial fans on the western side of the 
Atacama Desert. Elevations on the Property range from 970 to 1,230 masl. No permanent water flows exist in 
the area, and only isolated, small dry ravines or quebradas are found near the surrounding hills. 

Due to the extreme aridity, there is practically no natural vegetation or fauna in the area. 

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
AMC maintains a permanent mining camp at the Property, at an elevation of 1,000 masl, with office and living 
accommodation, workshops and communications.   

Antofagasta is the only permanent settlement located in the relative proximity to the mine. The city provides the 
basic goods, services and accommodations, as well as labour and technical requirements for the mine.  

Power supply is from the national grid. Water is pumped from two aquifers, Rosario and Aguas Blancas, which 
determines the mining and processing rates. There is sufficient area for heap leach pads and tailings storage 
facilities for the projected life of the mine. 

5.5 Surface rights 
 
The Company holds sufficient surface and water rights for the operation of the project and the requirements of 
project infrastructure including power, water and personnel.

6 HISTORY 

 
6.1 Project History 
 
The Cantón Aguas Blancas was discovered by José Santos Ossa as early as 1860, while exploring for silver 
veins in the desert east of Antofagasta. The cantón became one of the main Chilean nitrate producers from the 
late nineteenth century until the First World War.  

The Cantón Aguas Blancas was mined by many well established oficinas, which were connected to the local 
railroad system, established in 1903 from Aguas Blancas to Caleta Coloso, with three main stations in the area 
(Aguas Blancas, Agua Buena and Lacalle). In 1923, all the local caliche railroads were linked by the Chilean 
government into a continuous system from Diego de Almagro, in the south, to Iquique, in the north.  

The caliche mining in the Cantón Aguas Blancas had ceased by 1950. 

AMAX acquired control of the deposit in 1988 and conducted an extensive drilling, trenching, sampling and 
testing program. A feasibility study was prepared by Bateman in 1989. In 1992 AMAX dropped the venture, 
after a corporate decision to move out of the fertilizer and inorganic chemical industry.  

Minera Teslin Ltda. ("Teslin"), owned by the Canadian corporations Teslin Químicas de Chile Inc. and 
Atacama Minerals Chile Ltd., acquired control of the Petronila holdings in March 1993 and conducted 
additional drilling and test work. A reserve estimate was concluded in 1994. 

Several studies were conducted for Teslin between 1997 and 1999, to assess the influence of geologic factors on 
the iodine-sulphate resources, to estimate the resources and reserves over virgin and repasos areas, to evaluate 
the mining method and to update the geologic model and mine schedule. A due diligence review was conducted 
in 1998.  

In 2000, Atacama Minerals Company Ltd. sold 50% of the Aguas Blancas Property to ACF Minera S.A. 
("ACF"), who built and operated a heap leach and iodine recovery circuit through to May 2005. In April 2005, 
Atacama Minerals Chile Ltd. agreed to purchase from ACF its 50% participation, which gave Atacama Minerals 
Chile Ltd. full ownership of the Aguas Blancas operation. The purchase was completed on May, 3rd 2005.  

In January 2012 Atacama Minerals Corp. changed its name to Sirocco Mining Inc. 

6.1.1 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
A number of resource and reserve estimates made by AMAX between 1988 and 1992 based on the initial drill 
programme by AMAX. Resource estimates were undertaken by Teslin in 1997 and 1999 as part of an overall 
project evaluation. In 1998, a feasibility report study was prepared using the 1997 resource estimate of 73 Mt at 
310 ppm of Iodine. A subsequent resource estimate was completed in 1999.  

In 2005 AMEC, on behalf of Atacama completed a twin RC drilling programme to validate previous drilling 
results obtained by AMAX and conducted a resource estimate on behalf of Atacama. 
 
Since December 2005 resources have been compiled by the current author. It should be noted that resource 
estimates after 2007 use only drilling data obtained by Atacama (May 2005 onwards). 
 
Table 6-1 shows a summary of historical resource estimates. It should be noted that the estimates prior to 2005 
do not meet the criteria of NI 43-101 and are reported for historical purposes only.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
Paleozoic basement and Meso-Cenozoic cover are exposed in the Cantón Aguas Blancas region (figure 7.1). 
The Paleozoic basement includes metasedimentary rocks in the Coastal Range and sedimentary to volcanic 
sequences, associated with coeval late Paleozoic intrusive complexes, in the eastern Cordillera Domeyko. The 
overlying Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover is represented by volcano-sedimentary, marine and volcanic sequences, 
intruded by a heterogeneous suite of plutonic bodies varying in size from huge composite batholiths in the 
Coastal Range to discrete, small-sized stocks in the Central Depression and the Cordillera Domeyko. 

The nitrate and iodine deposits occur mostly along the eastern side of the Coastal Range from Zapiga in the 
north to Taltal in the south, a distance of 700 km. Commercial deposits in the Tarapaca and northern 
Antofagasta Provinces were confined to the Coastal Range, whereas to the south they spread out more widely 
into the Central Valley and lower slopes of the Cordillera Domeyko. Many deposits occur along the margins of 
salars and ancient playas.

(After AMEC 2005) 

 
7.2 Property Geology and Mineralisation 
Historic nitrate mining and the current iodine resources in the Aguas Blancas area occur on the slopes of large 
Miocene to Pleistocene age alluvial fans where saline minerals act as cement to sediments in unconsolidated 
alluvium. 

The iodine-bearing caliche at Aguas Blancas (figure 7.2) extend for over 23 km (NW-SE) and are up to 4km in 
width (SW-NE), occupying flat to gently undulating areas and the mid to lower hill slopes on the margins of a 
large pampa.

                                                                                         22                                                                            19 December 2013 

  

The caliche occurs in thicknesses up to 6m and is overlain by 0.2 to 1m of barren, weakly consolidated sand and 
gravel (chusca), which is commonly stripped prior to mining. In general the caliche is underlain by gravels or 
clays. 

The caliche contains varying quantities of rock fragments in the form of sub-rounded to angular clasts up to 
10cm in diameter. In places they clearly represent alluvial channels but in general their distribution within the 
deposit is irregular. 

During the 2012 drill programme the geology and characteristics of the caliche were studied in more detail. The 
following lithology types were distinguished and also used in the logging of RC drill chips.

From mapping work conducted in 2012 across the mined areas of the project and as can be seen in figure 7 -2 
below (See table 7.1 for key), the geology of the caliche is complex and highly variable. The type of caliche, the 
quantities of clay, rock fragments and sulphates, as well as contained iodine can vary over short distances.

XRD analysis carried out at the Universidad Catolica del Norte in 2012 on a variety of samples from the mining 
area (table 7-3) show both the large variety and variable distribution of minerals identified within the caliche. 

Iodine is thought to occur in solid solution in nitrate double-salts, glauberite, halite, and potassium salts and as 
calcium iodate minerals lautarite, bruggenite, and dietzeite. The mineralogical composition of a caliche sample 
from Aguas Blancas shows that three salts (halite, glauberite and nitratina) represent 60% of the sample 
composition. 

Iodine, usually above 150 ppm, has higher concentrations on the southeastern half of the deposit, where the 
block model shows large zones with iodine grades above 500 ppm, exceeding 1,000 ppm in some areas. For 
most of the area, the nitrate grades range between 1% and 5%, although grades above 10% are not infrequent 
along the NW-SE axis of the deposit. Sodium sulfate has a conspicuous distribution, being present only in the 
eastern half of the deposit with grades ranging from 20% to 40% Na2SO4, and rarely exceeding these values. 
The depth of the caliche layer in Aguas Blancas ranges from 0.5 m to 5 m.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The iodine-rich caliche deposits have been classified by Williams-Stroud (1991) as Deposit Model 35b.12 
(Descriptive Model of Iodine-bearing Nitrate).  

Very particular conditions allowed the formation of the caliche deposits in the Atacama Desert. Such deposits 
have been poorly studied, as compared with more ubiquitous deposit types. Soil development in the Atacama is 
almost unique on earth, because it is one of the few places where soils primarily contain large concentrations of 
nitrates, as well as significant concentrations of perchlorate, iodate, and phosphate salts. Only in the Antarctic 
have relatively similar soils been identified. The presence of the corresponding anions is mainly derived from 
photochemical reactions in the atmosphere, and their accumulation in the Atacama is the result of the nearby 
presence of a major volcanic chain, the extreme aridity and the stability of landscape surfaces. 

Currently there is little agreement regarding the timing for the initiation of hyperarid climatic conditions in the 
Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Some argue that the Atacama became the current hyperarid desert around 15 
million years ago, and that this desiccation is the result of Andean uplift to high elevations. However, others 
argue that the onset of hyperaridity in the Atacama commenced around 4 million years ago and is related to 
global climate cooling and not to Andean uplift. 

The Chilean nitrate beds were formed due to the deposition of nitrates and other saline constituents in salars and 
ephemeral lakes in the present Atacama Desert. Windblown salts from these playa-type deposits were deposited 
in a belt along the western side of the Atacama Desert depression over the past 10 to 15 million years. Some 
iodine and saline constituents were also deposited from ocean fogs and rainfall from the west. 

In spite of the fact that the average annual rainfall is nominally less than 1 mm, with as much as 20 years 
between rain showers, the dominant land-forms of the Atacama Desert resulted from water erosion. Infrequent 
rainwater leaching and shallow deposition in the alluvial fan sediments built up shallow concentrations of saline 
minerals. Recurrent deliquescence and leaching has continued to redistribute the iodine and saline minerals 
deeper and/or downslope with time. However, economic concentrations of iodine and nitrate minerals are 
probably restricted to areas that are either (1) capped with an impermeable layer or (2) raised and well-drained, 
so that there are little or no descending fluids to dissolve and disperse them. This could explain the lateral 
limitation of the commercial-grade iodine and saline mineralization. 

With a surficial deposit such as the caliche, the exploration model is relatively straight forward, efficiently 
utilising shallow grid RC drilling to test the caliche profile within the project area using a wide initial spacing 
and then focussing down to more detailed grids for resource definition.

9 EXPLORATION 

 
The bulk of the exploration work carried out in the Aguas Blancas area has been conducted by Atacama 
Minerals since 2005. The main form of exploration has been shallow reverse circulation (RC) drilling.

Few records remain for the period prior to 2005 and drill data relating to this period is not included in the 
current Aguas Blancas database.  

Although several phases of trenching have been carried out prior to 2005 records are also poor and this data has 
now also been removed from the current database. Some trenches known as calicatas were used to evaluate 
areas where historical mining had been undertaken but this data was superseded by later drilling and is not now 
used. 

The bulk of the caliche is covered by up to a metre of soft, unconsolidated material (chusca) making surface 
sampling of the caliche impractical. Given that drilling is shallow and cost efficient, no other forms of 
exploration sampling have been utilised at Aguas Blancas. 

9.1 Topography 
 
In addition to the detailed survey of exploration drill collars by differential GPS (DGPS) Atacama 
commissioned Pacific Geomatics Ltd (British Columbia, Canada) in February 2012 to produce a digital 
elevation model (DEM) over an area of 1,814km2 using stereo Worldview imagery. The resulting data, 
controlled by known survey points, provided accurate 1m contours over the entire project area.

RC drilling is based on an orthogonal grid system and varies from reconnaissance drilling at a spacing of 400m 
x 400m to final infill drilling prior to mining using a 50m x 50m spacing. The average depth of an RC hole is 
3.55m with a maximum depth of 8.5m.

10.1 Reverse Circulation Drilling 
 
RC drilling for the period from 2005 to early 2012 (45,084m) was carried out in-house by a small trailer 
mounted rig using a separate truck mounted compressor as shown in figure10.2. 

Figure 10-2: RC rig used for all drilling from 2005 to early 2012 
 

 
Source: AMC 

 
Ingenieria y Servicios Mineros (Ismin) mobilised a SCHRAMM T450 rig with on board compressor 
(850cfm/350psi) to Aguas Blancas in late May 2012 which completed 19,717m by year end (figure 10.3). 

For all drilling a Senior geological technician or Company geologist is on site at all times and is responsible for 
all aspects of the drilling.  

Drill holes are and collar coordinates marked out in the field using a DGPS with 1m tall wooden posts painted 
and flagged with location and hole number. At this time any access work required is also carried out using a 
grader (Figure 10.4).

Prior to drilling the geologist checks the post location against a map of planned holes and writes on a control 
collar sheet along with the coordinates taken by a hand held GPS (Trimble Juno 3B). 

All drilling completed is vertical and the angle of the rig mast is checked by the geologist prior to drilling.  

10.2 Drill Hole Surveying 
 
All drill collars are surveyed by DGPS after drilling is complete. Due to the short depth of the holes no down 
hole survey is required.

10.3 Sampling method 

Samples are collected in 0.5m intervals from the base of the cyclone in a large new plastic bag which is pre-
numbered with hole and interval, secured to the base of the cyclone. Frequently little or no sample is collected in 
the first 0.5 to 1.0m representing the unconsolidated chusca. 

The geologist takes a hand sample from each bag, and logs the sample based on geology, pebble content and 
type, sample colour, sample salinity, recording the information on a paper drill log sheet.  
 
The sample number is assigned from the sample tag books and checked against the sample control sheet. Two 
sample tags are placed in the bag and the drill hole and interval written in the tag book for future reference. The 
bags are then sealed and transported to Company's sample preparation facility for splitting. 
 
The QAQC sample control sheet is filled in with the sample number. The sheet also indicates when standards, 
blanks and duplicates should be inserted 
 
For drilling prior to 2012, samples were geologically logged based on the code system detailed in table 11.1.  
The 2012 drill programme utilised a more detailed code system for the caliche.

Prior 2012  
lithology code 

Post 2012  
lithology code 

Description   

AR ARCI 
Clay layer normally brown to dark brown and has no salinity, can have 
iodine grades but generally low, when compressed in the hand forms 
compact "balls" 

CAL CALC 
Caliche with clay, low to high salinity, normally beige is a "heavy 
ultrafine powder", grades run from no to high grades, when compassed in 
the hands behaves as a fluid. 

CAL CALH 
Caliche Hard, similar with CALC but it's possible to find caliche 
fragments, run normally good grades and have medium to high salinity. 

CAL CALS 
Caliche sulphate, white clay powder, sulphate rich, with low salinity, 
differs from sulphate unit on texture and clay content and salinity. It has 
normally a "pepper" taste. 

CHU/PAN CHUS 
Chusca, upper layer is formed by sand, clay and some rock fragments, is 
fine, light (flows with the wind) and has no salinity. Occasional hard 
panqueque crust within. 

GRA GRAV 
Grava, is normally the bottom layer together with RIPI (ripios). It is 
formed by angular rock fragments with more or less sand and clay 
content, sometimes appear between other units, can have salinity. 

RIPI RIPI 
Ripios, is a basal unit composed by clay and sand with rounded rocks 
(river rocks). Sometimes difficult to differentiate from grava because the 
size of the fragments available from RC drilling. 

SULF SULP 
Sulphate unit, "fibre" white powder very characteristic, no grades 
associated. 

 
 
10.3.1 Drill Sample Quality 
 
All RC drilling was conducted in dry conditions and water was only encountered in one area where drilling was 
curtailed. No wet RC samples were collected. The recovery is calculated based on a 5.25" hole diameter and 
densities as detailed in section11.1.4 below.   

RC samples collected prior to early 2012 were not weighed. All samples after this date were weighed at the 
sample preparation facility and the information entered into the drill database. 

For the 2012 drilling where weights have been recorded, recovery averaged approximately 65%. Recovery in 
the upper 1m of the holes, which includes the poorly consolidated chusca averaged 38% for 0.5-1.0m and 47% 
for 0.5-1.0m. Below this and representing the main caliche horizon RC recoveries averages 71%. Given the 
nature of the caliche this is considered acceptable.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

All samples collected from drilling at Aguas Blancas, were subject to quality control procedures that ensured 
industry best practice was utilised for the handling, sampling, transport, analysis, storage and documentation of 
sample materials and their analytical results.  
 
All samples from drilling prior to 2012 were prepared and assayed at the Company's on site laboratory. Samples 
from drilling in 2012 were prepared and analysed at the SGS laboratory in Antofagasta in Chile. The Atacama 
Minerals site laboratory is certified to ISO 9000. 
 
SGS is a global independent provider of assaying and analytical testing services for the mining and mineral 
exploration industry with consistent quality standards implemented across all regions. The SGS laboratory is 
certified to ISO 9000, ISO 14000 and ISO 18000.  The laboratory participates in group-wide round robin assay 
work to ensure internal quality performance. 
 
11.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis Methodology 
 
Samples are transported from the rig to the sample preparation facility at the mine by company personnel and 
the control sheet is delivered to the responsible person. Samples are laid out in sequence and checked, figure 
11.1. 
 
All tag books and sample control sheets are filed in a safe place for future reference.

11.1.1 Samples from drilling 2005-2011 
 
All samples were prepared and analysed using the following procedure: 

 
• No sample weights were recorded for drilling prior to 2012. 
• The sample was passed through a jaw crusher, to reduce it to less than ¼". 
• The crushed sample was then homogenised and quartered, using a riffle splitter.  
•  ¾ of the original sample was rejected, leaving approximately 500g, which is then dried. 
• The sample was then passed through a roll crusher, sized at 2mm.  A sizing check is made to ensure 90% is 

passing #10 mesh (2mm). 



Sirocco Mining Inc                           Aguas Blancas Property Technical Report 
 

 

 

                                                                                         34                                                                            19 December 2013 

  

• The sample was then ground in a ring mill, and a sizing check made to ensure 95% passes through a #100 
mesh (150um) screen.  Any oversize was reground, until at least 95% passed through the screen. 

• This final ground sample was then quartered, yielding potentially 4 samples (of approximately 150g each).  
One was sent for analysis.  One is also retained as a record sample by Atacama.   

• The other 2 samples were periodically used for check sampling purposes (this is done for all samples 
within 1 out of 20 drill holes).  One check sample was sent for external analysis (University of 
Antofagasta), and the other was submitted to the Atacama laboratory with a different sample number.  

• From July 2005, samples were prepared and subsequently analysed on site. Sulphates and nitrates were 
similarly analysed in the on-site laboratory, using volumetric techniques, since November 2005.  From 
April 2006, sulphates were analysed using ICP equipment, and nitrates using Molecular Absorption (MA) 
Equipment. 

• Iodine: 10g sample, leached with hot water and then filtered.  Acid and chlorine added to the filtered 
solution.  Heat applied on heating plate, then cooled.  Starch added and then titration with sodium 
thiosulphate. 

• Sulphates: 5g sample, leached with hot water, filtered.  2ml fraction taken, 1ml of acid added 1ml of 
standard Yttrium, before taking ICP reading. 

• Nitrates: 5g sample, leached with hot water and filtered to 250ml. Solution out into quartz cell and then 
reading taken with MA instrument. 

 
 
11.1.2 Samples from drilling in 2012 (iodine only) 
 
All samples were prepared and analysed using the following procedure: 
• Samples are weighed prior to splitting. This data is recorded and added to the database.  
• Samples are spilt using a 50:50 riffle splitter with a 0.5" aperture to produce a 3-5kg sample for 

submission.  
• Field duplicate samples are taken at this time by taking a second split. 
• Standard and blank samples are added to the sample stream at this point with pre-assigned sample numbers 

from the sample control sheet. 
• Samples are then laid out and checked before being packed in to crates (200 samples per crate) for 

transport to SGS in sealed crates.. 
• On receipt by the lab samples are checked again and then packed in trays. Each tray is identified and is put 

in an oven to dry for 4 hours in a temperature of 60 – 70°C.  
• Samples are then crushed first to 0.5" and then to 10mesh in 2 stages before being split in a rotary splitter 

where approximately 1kg is separated to be pulverized.  
• After every thirty samples the system is cleaned with sterile quartz and a sizing test is carried out  
• The 1kg sample is pulveriser in an LM-2 ring mill to produce a final sample passing 95% -100#.  
• Two samples of 250g are taken, one for immediate analysis and a second for reference. 
• Iodine: 10g sample, leached in 300ml of deionized water. Hypochlorite of Sodium 10% and Sulphuric acid 

10% added, heat applied on heating plate and then cooled. 
• Until sample 518,333 the acid attack used water of Brome and sulphuric acid, however this was modified 

after this point to fall into line with AM protocols.  
• Iodine is measured by titration with sodium thiosulphate 
• Sulphate and nitrate analysis has continued to be carried out at the site laboratory. 
 
11.2 Sample Submission Procedures 
When samples are dispatched to the laboratory, a completed sample submission form accompanies the samples. 
The submission form details the sample number sequences and also instructs the laboratory on the elements 
required for analysis and the analytical methods to be used. After analysis the assay results are received 
electronically by e-mail or by hard copy from the assay laboratory.  For all batches the sample numbers were 
checked against the sample numbers on the sample submission forms to verify that all the submitted samples 
were analysed by the methods requested for the elements required.

11.3 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
 
11.3.1 2005 to 2011 Drill Program 
 
Pulverised samples were periodically used for check sampling purposes for one in every twenty drill holes.  One 
check sample was sent for external analysis (Cesmec Laboratory or Verilabs) and the other was submitted to the 
Atacama laboratory with a different sample number (table 11.1).  
HARD plots for all sets of duplicate samples are shown in figures 11.2 to 11.7. 
 
Quality assurance steps also included compilation of a QA/QC report every 3 months, collating all the relevant 
data for this time period and routine sizing checks in the sample preparation facility. No standard reference 
material or blank samples were submitted during this period.

11.3.2 2012 Drill Program 
 
During the 2012 drilling a standard was included every 40 samples, a blank every 50 samples and a duplicate 
every 25 samples. All QAQC samples were inserted sequentially into the sample stream.  

Blanks: Blanks samples were produced at the mine site taken from river channels and clay areas known to be 
sterile. The material is mixed thoroughly and 3 to 5 kg placed in sample bags for use. To test the grade value for 
each blank, five samples were collected from the homogenized blank pile and analysed at the site laboratory.  

Standards: As no certified reference material is available for iodine assaying, standards are prepared in house 
from material taken from the mining area and were not pulverised. The material (up to 2") is mixed thoroughly 
and 3 to 5 kg placed in sample bags for use. Various standards have been used and are numbered (STD-1, STD-
2, STD-3 etc.). To test the grade value for each standard, five samples were collected from each homogenized 
standard pile and analysed at the site lab.  

Duplicates: The duplicate samples are produced during splitting from the original sample and inserted 
sequentially into the sample stream.

Figure 11-17: Standard 10 
 

 

Given the nature of the material used as standards (course run of mine material as opposed to crushed/pulverised 
material) the degree of variability shown by the standard assays is understandable. Several comments can be 
made: 

1. There is evidence of mixing of standard samples inserted. 

2. The grade of the standards utilised is biased towards the lower grade ranges with 6 of the 10 samples 
below the resource cut off of 200ppm. 

3. In general most of the standards analysed have under-reported. 

4. The analysis of the in house standards has also demonstrated that iodine can be irregularly distributed 
in the sample and as a result the procedures where changed at the end of 2012 to the use of standards 
made up from well homogenised pulverised material.  

Duplicates 

1,092 duplicate samples were produced and analysed. The chart below in Figure 11.18 shows the HARD (half 
absolute relative difference) values for the 2012 data set.  For 90% of the data set, the relative difference is 36%.   

Blanks 

603 blank samples were inserted into the sample sequence and are shown in Figure 11.19. In general the blank 
samples performed reasonably with +/- 10% of samples falling outside acceptable limits, some of which were 
mix ups with standard samples. However, as the blank material was obtained from the area of the mine site and 
may be weakly mineralised in places, it is recommended that a more effective source of blank material is located 
away from the mine site.

11.4 Summary 
Whilst on the whole reasonable there are a number of issues that require attention and a number of 
recommendations are made: 

1. The selection of blank material has been poor and a better source of blanks should be found. 
2. Standards produced have shown considerable variation. Some of this may be due to error in insertion of 

standards but a greater part is thought to be a result of the variability in iodine grades within the 
material, especially prior to pulverisation. A more effective standard needs to be developed from 
pulverised material. 

3. Duplicate data is reasonable, likely reflecting the variability seen in other QAQC sampling. 
4. More control is required of the sampling process and particularly the insertion of QAQC samples into 

the sample stream. 
 

Authors Statement 
 
On several occasions between 2005 and the end of 2012 (the most recent being October 15th – 19th, 2012) the 
author visited the Aguas Blancas site and witnessed all aspects of the collection, preparation and dispatch of 
samples carried out by the Company's personnel. The sample collection, preparation, analytical techniques, 
security and QAQC protocols implemented by the Company are consistent with standard industry practice and 
are suitable for the reporting of exploration results and inclusion in the mineral resource estimate undertaken.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

 
Historically the project data was held in a series of Excel spreadsheets. In early 2013 the Company integrated 
the Aguas Blancas drill database into a bespoke CAE Systems GDMS® database and all drill data is now held 
and managed within this database. 
 
As part of this transfer all drilling for the period from April 2005 to April 2012 was re-compiled and validated 
from the original sample tag books, log sheets and site laboratory sample preparation and analytical records. All 
data that could not be completely verified during this process was discarded. 
 
Original Database files were provided with 96,218 records in the assays file and 14,604 records in the collar file.  
Following correction and validation, these files have been reduced to 93,780 records (-2,438) and 14,221 
records (-383) respectively.  This reduction in records is due to the removal of erroneous and duplicated records. 
Following the re-merger of assay data to the sample file the I2 record statistics are tabulated in Table 12-1: 
 

Table 12-1: Database Validation Records 
 

Item Original I2 Records Updated (Merged) I2 Records 

Blank or '0' Records *1 8,263 0 

"ND" Records *2 0 8,033 

"#N/A" Records *3 0 2,076 

Total Records with no Assay Result: 8,263 *4 10,109 

Total Records with Assay Results: 85,517 83,671 

   

Records below detection limit 16,976 16,644 

 
      Note: 

1. Records containing either nothing, or a '0'; these values were misleading as they could either indicate no grade, 
that they were not assayed or that the assay result had been lost.  These records were fixed during the merger of 
assay results from the lab certificates. 

2. 'ND' indicates that there is No Data for these records.  This means that the samples exist on Lab Certificates but 
that no assay result exists for them, instead a description of the assay failure is listed on the certificate. 

3. '#N/A' are where assay results were not found during the merge.  Assay certificates either do not exist for these 
records or were not found during the validation process.   

4. Of this total, 163 results have now been found and merged, 7,888 have been proven as 'ND' and therefore 
renamed and 238 consist of #N/A. 

 
Data relating to drilling completed from April 2012 to the end of the 2012 was also entered into the GDMS 
database. Since that time all logging and sampling information relating to the drilling is  entered into Micromine 
Field Marshall software where it is first verified before transfer, further validation and upload to the project 
database where assays are merged electronically. 
 
 
Author's statement 
 
The authors have during visits to site and in subsequent discussions with Company personnel independently 
verified the drilling and assay data which has been used in the mineral resource estimate, which includes a 
review of report on the re-compilation and validation of the 2005-2011 drill database provided (2012 Drilling 
Report Final, Atacama Minerals 2013). In the authors' opinion, the procedures used by the Company to compile 
and verify the drill database are of a high standard and represent industry best practice.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 
The three most significant components of the caliche are iodine, sodium sulphate and sodium nitrate, which are 
soluble in water at ambient temperature. 
 
13.1 Historic Processing 
 
Production commenced in January 2001, with first iodine production in April 2001. Mining consisted of drill 
and blast operations to provide broken ore (<24") which was leached in pads to provide an iodate rich brine. All 
production arose form Heap Leach processing until the ALP was brought into commercial production in early 
2012. 
 
13.2 Metallurgical Testwork 
Extensive testwork and process development studies have been completed for Aguas Blancas, by Hazen 
Research (1995-97), Bateman/Parsons (1998) and Kvaerner Metals (1998).  Recommendations from these 
studies suggested the agitation leach process.   
 
In March 2006, a pilot scale agitation leach plant was commissioned.  The caliche feed was sent to a mobile 
crushing and screening plant, to reduce all feed to -1 inch, and then trucked to the pilot plant, where after initial 
ball milling the caliche was processed in a counter current decantation and agitated leach circuit.  The feed rate 
was 6-7 tonnes/hour.  The pilot plant demonstrated that iodine recoveries of 92% were possible by the agitated 
leach process.   
 
13.3 Current Processing 
The current process route consists of: 

• Surface mining by continuous miner of caliche ores 
• Production of iodate brines through Heap leaching or Agitated Leach Plant ("ALP") 
• Electrochemical reduction 
• Crystallisation – fusion to produce iodine prills 

 
13.3.1 Mining Operations 
Stripping of the overburden (approximately 0.5m thick) is carried out using a bulldozer, and accumulated at the 
sides of the mining block. The continuous miner takes 0.4m cut of the caliche. Material which is destined for the 
agitated leach plant ("ALP") is screened to provide -6mm fines and +6mm coarse material. The material is then 
loaded using front end loaders into 60t trucks, which haul the material to the leach pads (coarse) or the ALP 
slurry plant (fines).  

13.3.2 Processing Operations  
Prior to 2012 all caliche was processed by heap leaching. In 2012 the ALP was commissioned and since that 
time both Heap leach and ALP processing were carried out until December 2013 when the ALP slurry plant was 
placed on care and maintenance. 

The heap leach pads are lined with an impermeable geo-membrane, covering an area between 25,000 to 
30,000m2, with heights averaging 10m containing approximately 450,000t. Drainage pipes are laid on the 
membrane and covered by the mined ore. The heaps are irrigated initially with bore water and at the end of the 
heap life with a mixture of bore water and feble (a residual solution from the chemical plant) at a rate of 
approximately 1.75 l/m2/hr.  

The ALP comprises a slurry plant with a screen to produce -3.5mm product, with the oversize being returned to 
the heap leach pads. The throughput of the slurry plant is limited to approximately 150 tonnes per hour. A SAG 
mill is due to be installed which will enable processing of the full size range of mined product to produce -1mm 
feed for the leach section.  

The leach section comprises four tanks with agitators and four thickeners operating in a counter current circuit. 
An Improheat heater enables the temperature of the brine to be raised to assist in dissolution of the salts. 

13.3.3 Chemical Plant 
The brine solution from the heaps and ALP is accumulated in lined ponds as feed to chemical plant. A portion of 
the brine is mixed with SO2 which is then mixed with the balance of the brine to reduce the iodate in solution to

iodine gas in the "acid" leg of the Blow-Out Tower. The iodine gas is blown over to the "caustic" tower where it 
is adsorbed in NaOH solution. The solution is concentrated by recirculation until reaching a concentration of 
80g/l of iodine.  

The concentrated caustic solution is pumped to a crystallizer in the Fusion Plant. Iodine crystallization is an 
exothermic chemical reaction from the interaction of sulphuric acid with the concentrated solution of iodine 
(which is contained in a caustic solution). The crystallized iodine is heated to 114°C where the iodine changes 
from a solid to a liquid state during the 12 hours of melt. The molten iodine is dripped through a water-cooled 
column, producing prills of an average size of 3mm. 

The solid iodine is fed to a rotary dryer, where a vacuum line recovers the sublimated iodine for re-processing. 
The dryer discharge is sent to a storage silo, from which the material is screened and packed as prills in 25 or 
50kg containers for shipment by 20' containers to the customers. 

The present installed capacity of the recovery plant is approximately 2,200 tonnes per year of saleable iodine.  
 
13.3.4 Nitrate Pilot Plant 
AMC has completed a pre-feasibility study to recover sulphate and nitrates from the feble originating from the 
chemical plant. The study concluded that production of sulphate and nitrate was feasible. AMC initiated a pilot 
plant trial in 2013 to validate the parameters for potassium nitrate production for inclusion in a Feasibility 
Study.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 

14.1 Material/Area Coding 
 
In previous years, old mined areas had been described as 'Repasos'.  Following inspection by Atacama 
geologists and examination of satellite photos, a more detailed system of classification has now been 
applied to the Antiguos areas. The different types of historically worked potentially mineralized areas, 
are summarised below in table 14.1 and shown in figure 14-1.

14.2 Sample Processing 
A summary of the updated sample database available is shown in Table 14-2.  Although there have been 
various trenching campaigns in the past, this trench data was often not reliable for as a full intersection of 
the caliche, and has now been superseded by more recent drilling data.

The modelling methodology applied, and in particular the compositing method, is summarised below: 

1. In those drill holes with a defined chusca depth, this depth was used to define the top of the caliche 
layer.  For all other holes, the chusca depth was found testing for the location of the first +200ppm I2 
sample.  If no such sample occurred, a chusca depth of 0.5m was assumed. 
 

2. For holes with samples above 200ppm, composites were defined from beneath the chusca down to the 
deepest +200pm I2 sample, limited to a maximum depth of 3m.  If the resultant composite was greater 
than 2m, but less than 150ppm I2, then the first 1m was retested against a cut-off grade of 100ppm, in 
order to quality as a caliche intersection.  

 
3. For holes with no samples above 200ppm, the first 1m was retested against a cut-off grade of 100ppm, 

in order to quality as a caliche intersection. 
 

4. After these steps, all holes were converted into some form of composite, flagged as being either caliche 
intersections or not.  For each caliche composite, accumulations were calculated from iodine grade x 
thickness.  It was these accumulation values which were subsequently interpolated into the block 
model. 

 
5. In the block model, the final iodine grades were determined by back-dividing the accumulation values 

by the modelled caliche thickness.  NO3 and SO4 grades, along with other element values, were 
interpolated directly. 

 
A flow sheet of the compositing method is depicted in Figure 14-2.

14.3 Density Measurements 
 
Current density estimates principally stem from reconciliation analyses made during 2012, related to the 
mining of approximately 3mt of caliche ore.  The weights stemmed from weighed truck loads and volumes 
from surveys of individual cuts made by the continuous miners.  The average densities resulting from this 
are summarised in Table 14-5.  They were also supported by measurements of cut samples taken from cut 
caliche faces at the edges of mined blocks.  These depth-related density variations were applied during the 
current resource estimation.

14.4 Modelling Methodology 
 
This mineral resource estimation was completed using a block modelling approach, with the application of 
Datamine software.  The general methodology applied is described in Figure 14.3 below. 

Figure 14-3: Modelling Methodology 

 
 
 
In the generation of the volumetric block model, 25m x 25m blocks were used throughout.  Initially a fixed 
block height of 20m was applied, but blocks subsequently assigned the estimated depth of caliche. The 
various steps completed during generation of volumetric block model are summarised below: 

- Limiting of blocks to Atacama property boundaries, as of end December 2012. 
- Stripping of blocks from non-Atacama properties. 
- Identification of those blocks which had been partially mined at the end of 2012. 
- Stripping of completely mined blocks, as of end December 2012. 
- Exclusion of any blocks within 10m of mined trenches in old antiguos areas. 

 
Because the composite data represented complete caliche intersections of quite different thicknesses, 
subsequent iodine grade interpolation was based on grade accumulations.  The interpolated accumulation 
values were then used with the modelled thickness values to back-calculate grade iodine values in the final 
2D block model.  In general the caliche being modelled was not extrapolated more than 50m beyond the 
limit of any exploration drilling. 

14.5 Geostatistics and Grade Interpolation 
 
Log probability plots of accumulated composited grade are shown in Appendix B.  Two perpendicular rows 
of closely spaced (10m) were drilled, to assist with variogram generation at spacings less than the general 
50m grid used for short-term planning holes.  

Variograms were generated for the iodine accumulation values within each zone.  From these, model 
variograms were developed, again shown in Appendix A, with the model variogram parameters shown in 
Figure 14-6..  For iodine accumulations, ranges of approximately 150-200m north-south were found, with 
approximately 100m west-east. 



 

53                                                                 19 December 2013 

As well as I2 accumulations, NO3 and SO4 grades were handled in a similar way.  However, for these fields, 
variograms of the direct grade values were determined.

Owing to the different variogram characteristics and sample coverage, different resource classification areas 
were demarcated between iodine resources, and those associated with nitrate and sulphate resources. For the 
measured iodine resource classification, a drilling grid size of approximately 50m was selected, as this 
generally represented 2/3 of the total variability (sill) for accumulation variograms.  The grid size of 100m 
was selected for the indicated resource classification, as this was generally near to or less than the observed 
variogram range.   

The resource classification criteria applied are summarised in Table 14-8, and the resultant resource classes 
set into the block model are displayed in figure 14.4 for iodine resources in figure 14.5 for NO3 and SO4 
resources.

14.6 Model Validation 
 
14.6.1 Overview 
 
A number of steps were completed in connection with model validation, which included: 

• Visual comparison of interpolated and drill hole composite grades from printed plans.  
• Global comparison of kriged grades with composite data and nearest neighbour statistics. 
• Local comparison of kriged and nearest grades, on a series of parallel slices. 
• Comparison with historical estimates. 
• Reconciliation with production data. 

 
14.6.2 Plans of Grades and Weightings 
 
The I2 grades determined in the measured and indicated parts of the resource block model, for an unmined 
area in the central west part of the deposit, is shown in figure 14.11.  This figure also shows the average 
composite grades in the same areas.  In general the patterns of grade variation in the composites were 
clearly reflected in the corresponding block model grades. 
 
14.6.3 Global Comparison of Grades 
 
A comparison was made of the average model grades with the corresponding average grades from the 
composites sets.  These comparative figures are summarised in table 14.10.  The average grade values 
compare favourably.  In addition to this, alternative block model grades, derived by nearest neighbour 
interpolation and inverse-distance weighting, were also calculated.  These values are also shown in the same 
table, and compare favourably.

14.6.4 Local Comparison of Grades 
 
Average model grades within 500m grid squares were calculated, stemming from both block model as well as 
composite grades.  For iodine grades, these results are summarised in Figure 14-12.  The grid blocks used 
pertain to measured and indicated resources only.  In general the grades compare favourably.

14.6.5 Comparison with Historical Estimates 
 
Previous resource estimates have been compiled from PAH (1997 and 1999), AMEC (May 2005), and 
Wheeler from 2005 till the present time, as summarised in table 14-9.  This also includes the results of the 
updated resource estimate in the current study.  The total tonnages of all resource levels, including the inferred 
parts, have been added together for comparative purposes only, and are not of use for NI 43-101 reporting 
purposes in terms of total resources.   
 
These results show variation in quantities and grades.  This is due to: 
 
- Different applied cut-offs.  The only figures available from PAH have effectively a zero cut-off. 
- Different compositing methods.  The PAH estimate used fixed length composites – hence the much 

higher tonnages and lower grades.  The AMEC estimate made a sort of pseudo-three-dimensional model, 
interpolating directly from the 0.5m length original samples. 

- Evolution of mining methods from drill-and-blast to continuous miner. 
- Revision of density measurements. 
- Refinement of compositing methods as more and better reconciliation data has become available. 

 
The results from the different estimates are similar when the total quantity of contained iodine is considered.  
 
The resource figures from the current study demonstrate a major increase in overall resources, due to the 
additional exploration drilling that has now been completed.  They also display an elevation of resource 
levels, particularly for the northern and central areas.

14.6.6 Reconciliation 
 
For mining operations during 2012, data from 61 primary mining blocks were analysed, covering covered 
approximately 3Mt of caliche production.   Results were obtained for production results and evaluation of the 
same mining block outlines with the current resource block model.  An overall summary of these results is 
shown in Figure 14-10.

The mineral resource estimate is unlikely to be materially affected by other relevant factors. Necessary 
operating and environmental permits are in place. The mineral concessions which are subject to dispute host a 
minor component of the mineral resource estimate.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

15.1 Mining Costs 

The mining costs involve the removal of the immediate layer of 'chusca' by bulldozer, followed by mining of 
the underlying caliche in layers of 0.4m,include delivery of material to the ALP ROM pad or heap leach pad. 
The costs used for current long term planning purposes in this study are based on the average 2013 budget 
costs, based on owner-operated mining and both heap leach and ALP processing.  A summary of these mining 
costs is shown in Table 15-1:  
 
The Antiguos production, which is likely to consist of large blocks of caliche will be broken down with an 
impact hammer and processed on heap leach pads.

15.2 Processing Costs 
 
For block value calculation purposes, mining costs incurred up to the point of entry into the process have been 
broken down per tonne of ore. Process costs have been determined per kg of iodine product.  The processing-
related costs have been derived from budget 2013 figures, and are summarised in Table 15-2.  As the overall 
operation is limited by the amount of iodine production (approximately 2,250t/year from the blow-out 
towers), other fixed costs, such as indirect labour and office expenses, are costed per unit of iodine product.

15.3 Reserve Parameters 
 
Mining factors in the current reserve estimation study are summarised below in Table 15-3. 
 

Table 15-3: Mining Factors 
 

Dilution 0%

Dilutant grade, I2 ppm 65

Mining recovery 95%  
 
These figures are derived from 2012 reconciliation results, after comparison with the current resource model 
for equivalent mined-out areas.  The resource model has dilution built into it, as part of the caliche 
compositing process.  During reserve calculation, some resource blocks were also excluded due to the 
following reasons: 
 



 

67                                                                 19 December 2013 

• In areas where the topography is too steep to allow extraction with a continuous miner.  Area perimeters 
have been defined to exclude ore from these steep regions. 

• Where 25m x 25m resource blocks are completely isolated i.e. these areas do not have sufficient tonnage 
to warrant their own independent access and extraction. 

 
The LOMP figures are derived from current operating cost levels, and are based on an owner-operated mining 
fleet, with mining of the caliche by use of continuous miners. Following the economic calculations derived in 
Section 16, the breakeven cut-off grade is shown below in  
 
Table 15-4.

At the moment plans to produce nitrate salts are not incorporated into the current reserve calculations.  The 
current reserves are associated with an iodine product only. 
 
Because of the similar levels of breakeven cut-off grade for ALP and HL material, it was decided to use a 
consistent cut-off of 250ppm I2, for reserve estimation purposes. 

 
15.4 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
 
Based on the calculated cut-off grade and applied mining factors, the blocks which can be mined profitably 
were flagged as ore.  The profitable regions blocked out in the measured and indicated resource areas, 
constitute the mining reserves.  The resultant reserve estimate is shown below in Table 15-5.  These reserves 
are depicted in

16 MINING METHOD 

16.1 Mining Operations 
 

Prior to 2006, the caliche was mined by drill and blasting operations. Since February 2006 the caliche has 
been mined by a continuous miner (figure 16.1).  The principal difference is in the size of the product, with 
the continuous miner mostly producing less than 6 inch material.  The current mining plan is to use the 
continuous miner for all virgin-type caliche material.   

For a new mining block, which typically has a minimum width of 50m and is between 100 and 300m in 
length, stripping of the loose chusca material (approximately 0.5m thick) is first carried out using a bulldozer, 
and accumulated at the sides of the block.   

The continuous miner mines the caliche material in 0.4m lifts. This material is trucked to heap leach pads, 
generally within 1km of the current mining areas. When the ALP is operational the ALP feed is screened 
using mobile screens prior to trucking fines (<6mm) to the ALP slurry plant and the coarse (>6mm) to the 
ALP fine ore stockpile for SAG milling. 

The mined material is loaded using Komatsu front end loaders into Komatsu 65t trucks (Figure 16-2).  These 
currently haul the mined material to the leach pads (figures 16.3 and 16.4) or ALP for processing.     

The total number of cuts required in any block depends on the local thickness of the caliche.  As the base of 
the caliche is approached, the bulldozer is used to rip lines at 15m spacing down the length of the cut which 
material is then sampled to determine the final depth of cut. 

Current mine life is 15 years.

16.2 Geotechnical Studies 
 
There are no geotechnical studies available concerning the mining operations at Atacama.  Owing to the very 
shallow cuts which are made in order to extract the caliche, typically 2-3m, no geotechnical problems are 
anticipated. 
 
16.3 Hydrogeology 
 
The project is located in one of the driest deserts in the world, with average annual rainfall below 10 mm per 
year and very high evaporation rates. The potential for groundwater recharge from precipitation is, therefore, 
very low, but some recharge takes place due to deep percolation of groundwater from higher altitudes. 



 

74                                                                 19 December 2013 

17 PROCESS RECOVERY 

 
17.1 Heap Leach 
The heap leach pads are lined with an impermeable geo-membrane, covering an area between 25,000 to 
30,000m2, with heights averaging 10m containing approximately 350,000t. Drainage pipes are laid on the 
membrane and covered by the mined ore. The heaps are irrigated with a mixture of water or a mixture of 
water with feble (a residual solution from the chemical plant) at a rate of approximately 1.75 l/m2/hr. 
Recoveries are determined through measurement of brine flows from the pad and brine concentration over the 
life of the pad operation (up to 15 months). Irrigation is stopped the as soon as the brine concentration falls 
below 0.2g/l or the irrigation volume reaches 0.8m3/t of material placed. Typical recoveries range from 60% 
to 65%. 

17.2 ALP 
Prior to 2012 all iodine was produced from heap leach processing. In 2012 the ALP was commissioned 
whereby production was produced from both heap leach and ALP processing. The company will process the 
mined caliche by both heap leach and ALP. 

The ALP comprises a slurry plant with a screen to produce -3.5mm product, with the oversize being returned 
to the heap leach pads. The throughput of the slurry plant is limited to approximately 150 tonnes per hour. A 
SAG mill is due to be installed which enable processing of all continuous mined product to produce -1mm 
feed for the leach section.  

The maximum throughput of the leach section is 400 tonnes per hour. The leach sections comprises 4 stage 
agitated tank leaching and counter-current decantation with associated pregnant brine handling and 
distribution, sediment discharge and containment, reclaim water system, reagent and utilities systems and 
plant wide control systems and control room. Brine concentrations range from 0.25 to 0.30 g/l with recoveries 
ranging from 87.5% to 91%. 

In December 2013 the ALP slurry plant was placed on care and maintenance and is scheduled to restart in 
mid-2015. 
 
The ALP flow sheet is shown in Figure 17-1 and Leach Section layout in Figure 17-2.

17.3 Chemical Plant 

The brine solution from the heaps and the ALP plant is accumulated in lined ponds for feed to the iodine 
recovery plant.  
 
Iodine is produced by chemical reduction. The iodide solution is prepared in the Absorption Tower, where the 
iodate contained in an additional stream of brine solution is reduced to iodide with sulphur dioxide (SO2). The 
caustic solution is concentrated by recirculation until reaching a content close to 80g/l of iodine. The residual 
solution from the blow-out towers is either neutralised for use in the ALP or used in the final stage of heap 
leaching, with the balance sent to the solar evaporation ponds. 
 
The concentrated solution from the Absorption Towers is sent to an agitated reactor, where it is mixed with 
sulphuric acid, to enable crystallization. The crystallized iodine slurry is sent to a reactor, where it is melted at 
an approximate temperature of 135ºC and separated from the aqueous phase. Prilling then takes place by 
dripping the molten iodine into a water-cooled column, producing prills of an average size of 2 - 3mm. 
 
The solid iodine is fed to a rotary dryer, where a vacuum line recovers the sublimated iodine, sending it to be 
dissolved in NaOH solution which is reprocessed in the Concentration Reduction stage. The dryer discharge is 
sent to a storage silo, from which the material is screened into three different products: oversize and fines, 
which are reprocessed; and the intermediate sizes +1mm -4mm which is sold. 
 
The overall chemical plant recovery is 91%. The present installed capacity of the chemical plant is 
approximately 2,250 tonnes per year of saleable iodine. 
 
The Chemical Plant flow sheet is shown in Figure 17-3.

18 PROJECT INFRASTUCTURE 

 
18.1 Mine Site 
 
The Aguas Blancas Mine has been in operation for 11 years and project infrastructure is well established. 
 
The project is linked by good quality roads to the nearby port city of Antofagasta, is supplied by grid power 
and is serviced by all the necessary mine infrastructure required for the efficient operation of mining and 
processing including office, workshops, lay down areas and water pipelines. The layout of the main areas of 
the project infrastructure are shown in Figure 18-1.

18.2 Waste and Tailings Disposal 
 
No waste is produced during the mining process other than the surficial chusca which is backfilled into 
completed cuts.  
 
Tailings from the ALP are deposited in the Tailings Storage Facility. Return water is collected for use in the 
ALP. 
 
Feble (acidic waste water from the chemical plant) is either neutralised for use in ALP, used in final stage of 
heap leaching or evaporated in the solar ponds.

19 MARKETS AND CONTRACTS 

 
19.1 Market 
 
The recent Chilean iodine export price is summarised in Table 19-1. 
 

Table 19-1: Chilean Iodine Export Prices 
 

2009 2010 2011 2012 

Chile Export Price 26.92 26.21 41.21 52.52 
 
Chilean exported 17,000 tonnes in 2012, of which AMC exported 7%.  

World consumption is estimated at 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes per annum. World consumption is set to grow at 3 
to 5% pa. Iodine has several main uses, predominantly in the x-ray and pharmaceutical markets, which consume 
~1/3 of consumed iodine. Market growth is tied closely to household income growth linked to x-ray media and 
LCD consumption. 

The authors have reviewed this data and the iodine pricing being used by in the current analysis $45 is 
acceptable. 

 
19.2 Contracts  
 
The Company does not have a power contract as it purchases power in the spot market. The company purchases 
major consumables such as fuel, acid and lime under annual contracts. The authors have reviewed the 
information on current contracts, the terms of within industry norms.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND PERMITTING 

20.1 Environment Studies and Permits 

In 1997, Atacama prepared and presented an Environmental Impact Study for the Aguas Blancas project to the 
Regional Commission of the Environment (COREMA), which issued the Exempt Resolution Nr. 012 of August 
7, 1997 in favour of Atacama (PAH, 1997b). 

The main points of Atacama's EIA study are summarized below (excerpts from Bateman/Parsons, 1998): 

The area lacks the basic conditions for the existence of wildlife. The existing vegetation is associated with a few 
wells and almost all of it has been planted. Some animals were observed, all of them associated with the wells. 
There are no surface watercourses. The hydrologic potential of the Aguas Blancas sector lies basically on the 
exploitation of groundwater resources. Existing water rights for the area amount to a total 130 l/s.  

Background data indicate that the sector's water recharging rate ranges between 17 l/s and 180 l/s. Air quality in 
the project service area, expressed in terms of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide (S02) concentration levels, 
is considered as good. Concentration levels of both parameters lie under the regulated limits. 

The ruins of eight former nitrate works rest in the outskirts of the facilities. None of the former works has been 
saved from looters and all wooden remains have been removed. A pre-Hispanic geoglyph was identified close to 
the former San Martín nitrate oficina, 8 km away from the plant. 

Main adverse effects on the environment could show in the groundwater resource, in which case the alternative 
is the recharging theory, and on road infrastructure and vehicle traffic, in which case the transportation 
alternative would be truck haulage. Less important, due to its distance from inhabited places, are the impacts on 
air quality and noise levels. 

No impacts are foreseen on the biological components or the cultural sites. As to the latter, the project should 
prepare an Environmental Management Plan to protect them. The Aguas Blancas project benefits the socio-
economic component, especially in the region's employment and income levels. Indeed, 275 new jobs would be 
generated, implying an economic input of at least US$3 M/year. Regional labour will be preferred to strengthen 
these effects. 

Each impact identified for the Aguas Blancas project is associated with remedial measures that ensure the 
fulfillment of the environmental legislation in force. Similarly, the project considers a number of actions 
intended to prevent and control environmental risks. 

The project considers an air, groundwater and noise component monitoring program. PM10 concentration levels 
in air, piezometric levels and water quality will be measured, and sound pressure levels will be recorded. 
Reports with the monitoring data shall be forwarded to Region II's COREMA. 

Atacama submitted an application for an amendment (DIA) to their existing environmental permit (EIA) to the 
Chilean Authorities (CONAMA) on October 12th, 2006.  The main items in this application are: 

• An increase in iodine production from 1,000 tonnes per year to 1,500 tonnes per year. 
• Sulphate production from 150,000 tonnes per year to 300,000 tonnes per year. 
• Nitrate production from 70,000 tonnes per year to 115,000 tonnes per year. 
• Use of water from 70 litres per second to 134 litres per second. 
• Expansion of pond area from 1.24 million square metres to 2.74 million square metres. 
• The use of electrical generator equipment using #5 fuel oil. 

 
Region II COREMA approved this DIA through Resolución Exenta Nº 054/2007 on February 19th, 2007. 

Atacama also submitted a DIA for a new power system to bring CDEC-SING power to the site.  This DIA was 
approved through Resolución Extenta No. 0308/007 on September 28th, 2007 

AMC are in possession of all necessary permits for the operation of the mine and processing facility.

20.2 Community Relations 

No towns or populated areas fall within the boundaries of the Property and there are therefore no potential social 
or community related requirements required as part of the ongoing operations. No agreements or negotiations 
have therefore been required for the operation of the project. In general the local communities in northern Chile 
have a favorable attitude towards mining. 

20.3 Mine Closure 

Atacama has prepared a reclamation plan, to be put in place at the end of the operation, and consisting of the 
following steps (excerpts from Bateman/Parsons, 1998): 

• Buildings and structures above grade will be removed from the area. Concrete slabs and foundations at 
and below grade throughout the plant site area will be covered with 0.5 m of adjacent borrow waste. 

• Earth piles of mine waste will be left untouched. Mine roads will be left untouched. 

• The tailings pond and pile, the ponds, both lined and unlined, will be left untouched with the contained 
residue in place. Covers will be removed and commercially disposed. 

• Water wells will be capped. Pumps and connecting pipe spools will be removed. Concrete foundations 
and surface pipelines will be buried in place with 0.5 m adjacent borrow fill or removed, at the 
company's choice. 

• Electrical distribution system will be taken down, the poles and copper cable removed from the site and 
commercially disposed. Trash landfills will be smoothed and buried with 0.5 m of adjacent borrow fill. 

• Access roads will be untouched. In-plant roads will also be left untouched. 

No bonds have been posted.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

The company announced the closure of the ALP slurry plant and deferral of the completion of the SAG mill in 
the ALP in December 2013 due to a softening of the iodine market price. In 2014 only heap leach processing 
will be carried out. The Company envisages that the mill installation will be completed by mid-2015. 
 
The mine schedule is based on the end 2012 reserves and economic inferred resources and incorporates heap 
leach and ALP processing from 2015. Inferred resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
 
As the Aguas Blancas Mine has been in operation for a number of years operating costs and capital 
requirements are based on detailed annual budgets. 
 
21.1 Operating Cost Estimates 
 
The current estimate of operating costs over the planned depletion of reserves, is approximately $60M per year 
(following completion of SAG mill installation).

22.3 Taxes and Royalties   

AMC is subject to the fiscal regime in Chile. In Chile, taxable profits are currently subject to tax at a rate of 
20%. Ultimate future profit distributions by AMC to its Canadian parent company by way of dividends would 
increase the combined rate of tax on Chilean income to 35%. 
 
The government of Chile has established a specific tax on mining companies whereby AMC would be subject to 
a progressive tax on profit margins if it has annual sales of value equivalent to 12,000 metric tonnes of fine 
copper. To date, AMC has not exceeded this threshold. In case of mining operators whose sales exceed the 
equivalent of 12,000 tonnes of fine copper but do not surpass the equivalent of 50,000 tonnes of fine copper, the 
specific tax is applied progressively with rates of 0.5% to 4.5%. 
 

22.4 Sensitivity Analysis 

The primary cost groups which may impact the project valuation are iodine price, operating costs and capital 
costs. The sensitivity of the is shown in Table 
 

Table 22-3: NPV Sensitivity  
 

 Sensitivity NPV10% 

Base Case  $156m 

Iodine Price  +/- $1/kg +/- $14m 

Operating Cost +/- 2.5% +/- $10m

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

There are no other iodine or caliche producers in the vicinity of the Aguas Blancas project.  Several properties 
belonging to SQM are located within the group of concessions within the Aguas Blancas project area, but these 
have been excluded from resource and reserve calculations.  The limits of these properties are also shown in 
Figure 23.1. There are no historical resource estimates for these properties.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  

 
The evaluation work was carried out and prepared in compliance with NI43-101 and the guidelines of the 
Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. 
 
The updated resource estimations of all modelled zones are shown below in Table 25-1:, incorporating all of 
the available drill hole data and revised density measurements, for a cut-off grade of 200ppm I2.  No mining 
factors have been applied to the resource figures, but they are based on minimum thickness of 0.5m.

Owing to different sample coverage and geostatistical characteristics, NO3 and SO4 resources are reported 
separately, as shown in Table 25-2.

Reconciliation data was collected for production from the continuous miners in use from 2009 to 2012.  This 
enabled updated mining factors to be calculated, which were then applied in subsequent reserve calculations.  
The reserves were derived by blocking out those areas of measured and indicated resources at a cut-off of 
250ppm I2.  This breakeven cut-off was derived from budgeted cost levels for 2013, for both heap leach and 
agitated leach processing operations.

N.B. Reserves blocked out on a cut-off of 250ppm I2.   
        This cut-off was derived from parameters which included: 

• Iodine price $36/kg  
• Exchange Rate CHP to US$ 500 
• Owner mining, HL & ALP processing 

        
 Mining Factors applied: 
• 0% dilution, 95% mining recovery 
• Maximum caliche thickness 3m 

       
 An additional 40Mt of Inferred material at economic grades is also modelled 

 
 
In the authors' opinion, given that the Aguas Blancas mine has been operating since 2001 and that the operating factors 
are well established, the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate are well supported.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

The Aguas Blancas mine has been operating for over 10 years and operating factors are well established.  
 
The authors recommend: 

• the continued conversion of inferred resources is completed to enable determination of the full life of 
mine. A budget of US$ 5.2m has been included in the current Life of Mine plan. 

• Investigations are continued to determine the viability of nitrate production.
