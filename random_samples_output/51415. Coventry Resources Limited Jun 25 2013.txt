1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Summary Property Description and Ownership 

This technical report documents the mineral resource estimate for the Dogpaw Gold Deposit.  

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit forms part of the West Cedartree Gold Project and is located 
approximately 80 km to the southeast of Kenora and 80 km north-northwest of Fort Frances in the 
southern part of north-western Ontario, Canada. The West Cedartree Gold Project, together with 
the adjacent Cameron Gold Project, forms part of the larger Cameron Gold Camp Project. The 
nearest population centres to the Cameron Gold Deposit are the small towns of Sioux Narrows and 
Nestor Falls, located 15 km and 20 km away, respectively. 

The West Cedartree Gold Project consists of a total of 9 unpatented claims, 12 patented claims 
and one mining licence of occupation (MLO) plus two mining leases. All of the claims are located 
within un-surveyed crown lands situated within the Dogpaw Lake area. The Dogpaw Gold Deposit 
itself is located within patented claims K9991 and K9992. 

The total area of the property is approximately 16.5 km² or 1,650 hectares. 

Coventry holds a 100% interest in the West Cedartree Gold Project subject to certain underlying 
royalties and payment obligations in respect to eight separate agreements that comprise the 
property, as well as a minor royalty for three claims only to the previous owner Houston Lake 
Mining Inc. (HLM). 

1.2 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 

The West Cedartree Gold Project is accessible by public sealed and well-maintained unsealed 
roads and by float plane. In the vicinity (within 100 kilometres) are major national rail lines and 
regional commercial airports. 

The climate of the region is moderate continental with temperatures ranging between 35oC in 
summer to minus 40oC in winter. Total annual rainfall averages 55 centimetres, with the heaviest 
rains occurring between June and August when about half of the average falls. Snowfall averages 
about 200 centimetres per year and frost penetration can be as deep as two metres. 

There are numerous towns and villages within two hours driving distance of the project, the largest 
being Kenora and Fort Frances, both of which support forest industry activities. Winnipeg in 
Manitoba (population 635,000) is the closest large urban centre, being about 4.5 hours by road 
from the project. 

Commercial power is located within 30 kilometres of the site from a 115 kV power line adjacent to 
Highway 71.

The physiography is typical of the Canadian Precambrian Shield upland in northern Ontario. 
Topographic relief is relatively low (maximum of 35 metres) and is characterised by glacial features 
such as moraines and eskers, with subordinate outcrop occurring as topographic highs. Steep drop 
offs in areas of outcrop usually denote the presence of fault structures.  

Vegetation in the project area consists of mixed boreal forest with subordinate low-lying areas 
covered by cedar swamp and bog. Minor plantation timber stands are also present. The project 
area has been extensively logged over a significant time period, with much of the area comprising 
regrowth forest. 

1.3 History 

The gold occurrence that constitutes the Dogpaw Gold Deposit was first located by a prospector 
called Dalby in about 1900. 

Commercial exploration at the West Cedartree Gold Project commenced in 1944 and has been 
conducted intermittently until the present day. Several significant exploration programs have been 
directed at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit by Noranda, Consolidated Golden Arrow, Nuinsco Resources 
prior to the involvement of Houston Lake Mining Inc in 1997. 

In January 1996, a 500 ton bulk sample was trucked to Fort Frances and then shipped by rail to 
Noranda Horne smelter in Quebec. The grade average was 0.21 oz/ton gold due to a 30% dilution. 

Between 1997 and 2008 Houston Lake completed an additional 102 diamond drillholes (11,811.9 
metres). Data from the majority of these drillholes were utilised in the mineral resource estimate 
that is the subject of this technical report. 

1.4 Geology 

The West Cedartree Gold Project is located at the western end of the Late Archaean Savant Lake-
Crow Lake Belt in the Western Wabigoon Subprovince of the Superior Province in north-western 
Ontario. The Savant Lake-Crow Lake Belt comprises a number of individual greenstone belts that 
are most commonly separated by large-scale faults and shear zones, including the Kakagi Lake 
and Rowan Lake Greenstone Belts. 

The West Cedartree Gold Project region is dominated by the crustal-scale, southeast-striking and 
northwest-dipping Cameron-Pipestone Fault which extends over a strike length of greater than 
one-hundred kilometres. The Kakagi Lake Greenstone Belt, which hosts the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, 
comprises a supracrustal sequence that is situated to the southwest of the Cameron-Pipestone 
Fault, whilst the south-facing Rowan Lake Greenstone Belt, which hosts the Cameron Gold 
Deposit, is located immediately northeast of this structure. 

The geology of the Kakagi Lake Greenstone Belt is dominated by the Emm Bay-Peninsula Bay 
Syncline located to the south of the project area. Two geological sequences are exposed within the 
Emm Bay-Peninsula Bay Syncline, the newly-named Wapus Lake Volcanics and the Kakagi Lake 
Volcanics. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT 

 

 
 

Page 11 

 

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

The Wapus Lake Volcanics comprises subaqueous ultramafic to mafic, komatiitic-tholeiitic volcanic 
rocks and minor interflow sedimentary rocks. This unit is overlain with apparent conformity by the 
Kakagi Lake Volacnics, consisting of intermediate to felsic tholeiitic to calc-alkaline volcaniclastic 
rocks. 

The Kakagi Lake Volcanics are intruded by a series of large, syn- to post-volcanic, mafic-ultramafic 
sills and dykes known as the Kakagi Sills which have been folded within the Emm Bay Syncline. 
The folded sequence has been also intruded by a number of felsic to alkaline bodies, the largest of 
which is the Stephens Lake Stock located to the southeast of the West Cedartree Project area. 

The Dogpaw Lake Property lies along the northern edge and just west of the widest part of a 
sequence of pyroclastic rocks. Across the central part of the property, the pyroclastic sequence has 
been intruded by a 1,200 metre wide mass of gabbro-diorite which trends northeast across the 
claims and noses out in the extreme north-eastern corner of the property. The gabbro is the host to 
the bulk of the mineralisation. 

1.5 Mineralization and Deposit Types 

The mineralization occurring at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit comprises pyrite-silica, largely as 
replacements and breccia within both gabbro and mafic volcanic host rocks. The mineralization 
varies in thickness considerably, particularly over narrow intervals, ranging from 30 cm to more 
than five metres, with an average width of two to three metres. Significant pyrite is especially 
associated with high-grade zones, with ounce plus results commonly associated with pyrite in the 
range of 10%. Minor chalcopyrite is also recorded as associated with pyrite and visible gold is 
common, especially in mineralized material of very high grade. 

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit is a greenstone-hosted gold deposits and whilst it can generally be 
considered to be a part of the orogenic family of gold deposits, they bear many atypical 
characteristics that are commonly identified in the largest gold deposits of this style.  

1.6 Sampling Method and Analysis 

Information concerning field and laboratory techniques adopted prior to Coventry's involvement 
with the West Cedartree Gold Project is limited. All drilling completed at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit 
was diamond core and it was selectively sampled based on mineral content and halved either 
using manual techniques or a masonry saw. The samples were dispatched to a commercial 
laboratory and assayed for gold content using fire assay techniques. 

As part of the data verification for the mineral resource estimate presented within this technical 
report, Coventry undertook a significant resampling program of historic drillholes completed at the 
Dogpaw Gold Deposit. Coventry utilized its standard procedures that the Company developed at 
the nearby Cameron Gold Project.

For the Cameron Gold Project, Coventry has instigated documentation of all stages of field data 
collection, logging and sampling methods. Core is collected, geologically-logged, sample intervals 
marked then halved using core saws. QA/QC samples and ¼ core duplicates are included in the 
sample stream prior to leaving site in secure road transport. Coventry employs an accredited 
laboratory to prepare and analyze all samples with fire assay techniques.  

DataGeo has found that Coventry's field procedures, sample preparation and assay methods 
comply with industry standards for the assessment of this style of mineralization. 

1.7 Data Verification 

In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Mr Peter Ball visited the West Cedartree Gold Project on 
July 21 and 22, 2012. DataGeo was given full access to all relevant project data for both the West 
Cedartree Gold Project. 

The drillhole information has historically been located on various grid systems. This information has 
been consolidated onto the NAD83 datum, Zone 15 projection. For the purpose of mineral 
resource assessment of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, a local grid was established with a new north 
along the strike of the mineralization. Field inspection of the drillhole collars and orientation 
according to collar casing indicated that the data was correctly recorded on the national datum and 
correctly transformed to the local grid. Coventry accumulates and stores the drillhole information in 
an Access database managed in-house within its Toronto office.  

For the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, prior to Coventry's involvement little is known about the data 
collection procedures and sample validation. As such, no QA/QC information could be associated 
with the sample analysis. To verify the historic assay data, a significant re-sample and assay 
program was undertaken by Coventry which equated to about 25% of the data that defines the 
mineralization.  

The spatial representation of the re-samples within the program combined with the number of re-
samples taken within the mineralisation interpretation (>25% of total number of samples) provides 
sufficient evidence in the top-cut average results obtained to confirm that the assays within the data 
set to be utilised for mineral resource estimate are representative of the gold content of the 
Deposit. 

DataGeo believes that the results achieved by the re-sample program support the original assay 
results as being representative. 

1.8 Mineral Resource Estimates 

The mineral resource estimate for the Dogpaw Gold Deposit presented in this Technical Report 
was based on data provided by Coventry initially during January 2013, with the final data provided 
in March 2013.  

The drillhole data set utilized consisted of 93 diamond drillholes with a combined length of 10,475 
m, of mostly NQ-size. All holes were drilled from surface.

Mineralization was interpreted on sections which varied between 12.5 m and 25 m apart along the 
strike of the deposit on a local grid. The sectional interpretation was constructed from a 
combination of lithological information and gold assay information, nominally utilizing a 0.5 g/t cut-
off for mineralization. 

The interpretation is consistent with the geological and mineralization conditions of the deposit.  

Solid models were generated from the sectional interpretation. In total, ten mineralized zones were 
modelled. As no topographic information had been supplied the vertical position of the current 
surface was generated from the surveyed collars of the drillholes with some additional random 
points added to ensure coverage of the likely area to be modelled. The elevation of these random 
points was assigned from the neighbouring drillhole collars.  A small excavation that was the site of 
a bulk sample extracted in 1996 was taken into consideration with regards to the topography. 

As numerous generations of drilling data were utilised for the resource, the sample length used 
varied considerably across differing programs. On review of samples within the mineralization 
however, it was found that the dominant sample lengths are in a range of 0.9 to 1.1 m in length and 
as such 1.0 m was selected for the downhole composite length. 

The mineralization was composited downhole, with all composites <0.8 m in length excluded. The 
statistics were reviewed and as expected showed distorted grade populations, positively skewed. 
Thus some method of normalisation was required to reduce the influence of the higher-grade 
results which did not fit a normal population distribution. 

Grade continuity was assessed for the largest zones using semi-variograms with the results 
inconclusive. The nugget effect appeared to account of 75% of the total sample population 
variance and ranges in the direction of strike were approximately 30 m. There was evidence of a 
steep dip to the north but overall the result was very poor. 

It was determined that for zones with sufficient composite information  that inverse distance to the 
power of 3 (to reflect the very high local grade variance) would be used to estimate grade into a 
block model with parent cells of dimensions 10 mE x 2 mN x 10 mRL (relative to the local grid). The 
input data was top-cut where appropriate and the search influence of the composites that had been 
top-cut was restricted. 

For zones where insufficient composite information was available, grade was assigned as the 
average grade of the input data top-cut if appropriate.. Specific gravity data was modelled and 
applied to the same block model and the model was validated by comparing it to the input data in 
total and spatially. 

The mineral resource estimate was classified according to confidence in the mineralization model, 
the data density and confidence in the supporting data. For open pit mining the economic viability is 
at this stage unknown and thus only mineral resource remaining within 150m (above 210m RL) of 
the surface should be considered and this reported at a 0.5g/t cut-offs in Table 1.8.1.

*Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to

1.9 Conclusions and Recommendation 

The mineral resource estimate is robust in a global sense and of sufficient confidence to be 
suitable for the assessment of open cut mining statistics at the reporting cut-off stated in this report.   

The mineral resource risk at the reporting cut-off can be considered low given the demonstrated 
confidence in the interpretation, the volume and hence tonnage within the constraints, the grade 
estimation result is based on appropriate parameters and the reporting criteria which reflects 
today's metal prices and the likely processing characteristics of the mineralization. 

The mineral resource estimate as presented is accurate to the limits of the input information and 
interpretation utilised and whilst globally representative of metal content will not provide reliable 
tonnage and grade prediction if the reporting cut-off is raised significantly above the mineralization 
interpretation boundary. As such, if significantly higher mining grades are to be targeted the 
estimation strategy should be reviewed with particular emphasis placed on the higher grade 
components of the deposit. 

It is recommended that additional information related to the spatial positioning, given the lack of 
down survey information on the existing drilling, be obtained (confirmation drilling near current 
holes) to aid and confirm modelling. This is not expected to impact the global estimate but 
would/may improve local responses and thus aid any future mine planning.   

It is also recommended that the surface topography survey that was unavailable at the time of the 
mineral resource estimate be used to better define the resource limiting surface. 

Should the Dogpaw Deposit be progressed towards mining it is recommended that additional 
exploration work be conducted to better understand the dislocation in the strike orientation this 
would improve mineral resource confidence.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit forms part of the West Cedartree Gold Project and is located 
approximately 80 km to the southeast of Kenora and 80 km north-northwest of Fort Frances in the 
southern part of north-western Ontario, Canada (Figure 4.1.1). The West Cedartree Gold Project, 
together with the adjacent Cameron Gold Project, forms part of the larger Cameron Gold Camp 
Project. The nearest population centres to the Cameron Gold Deposit are the small towns of Sioux 
Narrows and Nestor Falls, located 15 km and 20 km away, respectively. 

Figure 4.1.1 Location Plan of the West Cedartree Gold Project and the nearby Cameron 
Gold Project, together constituting the Cameron Gold Camp Project. Source – Coventry. 

 

The West Cedartree Gold Project is located within NTS area 52F05, with the historic former pit at 
the Dogpaw Gold Deposit itself centred on 436450E, 5464900N (NAD 83 Datum, Zone 15) and 
comprises a total area of 16.5 km² or 1,650 hectares. 

4.2 Property Ownership and Agreements 

The West Cedartree Gold Project, which contains the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, consists of a total of 9 
unpatented claims, 12 patented claims and one mining licence of occupation (MLO) plus two 
mining leases. All of the claims are located within un-surveyed crown lands situated within the 
Dogpaw Lake area. The Dogpaw Gold Deposit itself is located within patented claims K9991 and 
K9992. 

The total area of the property is approximately 16.5 km² or 1,650 hectares.

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

Coventry holds a 100% interest in the West Cedartree Gold Project subject to certain underlying 
royalties and payment obligations in respect to eight separate agreements that comprise the 
property, as well as a minor royalty for three claims only to Houston Lake Mining Inc. (Houston, 
HLM). 

As far as DataGeo is aware all claims and licenses are in good standing at the time of compiling 
the mineral resource estimate. 

Following a binding letter of intent that was entered into on 14 June 2012 to purchase a 100% 
interest in the mineral and surface rights of the West Cedartree Gold Project from HLM, a sale and 
purchase agreement between Houston Lake and Cameron Gold Operations Limited was executed 
on 7 January 2013 and the acquisition was completed on 11 January 2013. 

The consideration of the purchase was $600,000 cash and 1,935,010 fully-paid ordinary shares of 
Coventry Resources Inc and 2.5% NSR royalty covering three unpatented mineral claims 
(K3000802-K3000804).

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

A summary of all claim information that comprises the West Cedartree Gold Project, including 
expiration dates, is listed within Appendix A. 

4.3 Summary of Royalties and Other Obligations 

Royalties are applicable to all of the eight separate option and/or purchase agreements that 
comprise the individual properties of the West Cedartree Gold Project. As the Dogpaw Gold 
Deposit which is the subject of this report is wholly contained to the lands comprising the option 
agreement with Golden CAML Mines Limited, detailed discussion of the royalty obligations will be 
restricted to this property. A summary of all royalties pertaining to the West Cedartree Gold Project 
is listed on a per claim basis within Appendix A. 

For the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, in the event of commercial production, a 2.5% Net Smelter Return 
(NSR) Royalty is payable to Golden CAML Mines Limited. The Company has an option to purchase 
up to 1.5% of the NSR Royalty for $500,000 per 0.5%. 

4.4 Required Permits and Environmental Considerations 

The Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) has introduced a new regulation for 
exploration permits applying to early activities being undertaken on mining claims, mining leases 
and licenses of occupation. To undertake moderate impact exploration permit activities (early 
exploration) proponents must apply for an exploration permit which will be mandatory after 1st April 
2013. As the Dogpaw Gold Deposit is located on patented claims, no exploration permits are 
required for further exploration. 

There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the project, however the former site of 
a bulk sample and a shallow shaft will require rehabilitation in the future. There are no known risks 
or other significant factors that may affect the access, title, right or ability for Coventry to perform 
work at the project. 

Coventry will however be required to establish baseline environmental, archaeological and 
ethnographic information in order to develop a mining operation at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES,  
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit is located in unsurveyed Crown lands in the southern part of western 
Ontario (Figures 4.1 and 4.2), about 113 kilometres by road (Highway 17 / Highway 71 / Cameron 
Lake Road) south of Kenora, and 158 kilometres by road (Highway 11 / Highway 71 / Cameron 
Lake Road) north of Fort Frances. As the aforementioned highways are sealed, and Cameron Lake 
Road is a well-maintained gravel road, year-round, all-weather access to the project is available.  

Travel along the access road is restricted to holders of permits issued by the Ministry of Natural 
Resources (MNR) in Kenora. According to the MNR regulations governing access, the road cannot 
be used to gain access for the purpose of hunting or fishing, nor may fishing equipment be 
transported along this road. It is permit requirement to use two-way radios when travelling along 
the road as there can be additional traffic associated with logging activities conducted regularly in 
the surrounding area. 

The nearest airports that provided regular commercial flights are located in Kenora, Winnipeg and 
Fort Frances. Coventry usually facilitates staff movements to other Canadian and international 
destinations through Winnipeg and Kenora airports. 

Rail lines forming part of the Canadian National Railway pass through both Kenora and Fort 
Frances. 

Within the project area, numerous logging and ATV trails provide access on land, whilst other parts 
can be accessed by boat, or in winter, by ice road. 

5.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The towns and villages that are within immediate driving distance of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit are: 

• Sioux Narrows – population 300 – 23 kilometres. 

• Nestor Falls – population 300 – 43 kilometres. 

• Kenora – population 15,500 – 113 kilometres. 

• Fort Frances – population 9,000 – 158 kilometres. 

Both Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows are primarily hunting and fishing centres. Fort Frances and 
Kenora have in the past hosted significant infrastructure for the forest industry, however industry 
downturns have severely impacted employment and opportunities in these centres. The nearest 
large population centre proximal to the project is Winnipeg in Manitoba (population 635,000), which 
is about 4.5 hours by road away.

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

The Company currently maintains an all-weather camp at the nearby Cameron Gold Project with a 
capacity of thirty-one people which is used to support operations within the West Cedartree Gold 
Project and facilitates year-round operations to be conducted. Power to the camp is provided by 
diesel generators. Within the West Cedartree Gold Project, a small core processing facility also 
powered by on-site diesel-powered generators is located at kilometre 9 on the Cameron Lake 
Road. 

A 115 kV power line adjacent to Highway 71 is located within thirty kilometres of the Cameron Gold 
Deposit. Hydroelectricity is produced at a number of locations north of Kenora and elsewhere and a 
coal-fired power station is located to the east of Fort Frances. Numerous lakes in the area provide 
a plentiful supply of water.  

The West Cedartree Gold Project area provides sufficient lands for any infrastructure associated 
with a potential mining operation, including suitable locations for waste disposal areas. A 
processing plant site and associated tailings storage facilities are likely to be located at the 
Cameron Gold Deposit, 10km to the east. 

Coventry will be able to source mining personal from the main nearby population centres of Kenora 
and Fort Frances, with specialist services and personal also likely to be derived from Red Lake and 
Winnipeg.  

5.3 Climate 

The climate of the region is typical of north-western Ontario in being continental, but it is somewhat 
moderated by the large number of freshwater lakes in the vicinity. Temperatures range from thirty-
five degrees Celsius in summer to minus forty degrees Celsius in winter. January temperatures 
average about minus sixteen degrees Celsius and July about nineteen degrees Celsius. Total 
yearly precipitation is about fifty-five centimetres, with the heaviest rains occurring between June 
and August where about half of the annual average falls. Snowfall averages about 200 centimetres 
per year and frost penetration can be as deep as two metres. 

Exploration activities can be conducted all-year round at the project, with the best access afforded 
during winter. 

5.4 Physiography, Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The physiography of the West Cedartree Gold Project is typical of that of the Canadian 
Precambrian Shield upland in northern Ontario. Topographic relief is relatively low (maximum of 
35 metres) and is characterized by glacial features such as moraines and eskers, with subordinate 
outcrop occurring as topographic highs. Steep drop offs in areas of outcrop usually denote the 
presence of fault structures. The average elevation above sea level for the area is 350 m. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

Outcrop density is variable and ranges from none in areas of thick glacial till to up to 30% in some 
areas. The greatest density of outcrop occurs along the shoreline of the numerous lakes and 
islands in the region. Larger areas of exposure can generally be correlated by lithology, with 
dolerite commonly forming extensive linear ridges that have been most resistant to the effects of 
glaciation. Outcrop is ubiquitously fresh from surface, except in areas dominated by alteration 
minerals (especially carbonate) and sulphides, where shallow oxidation is present. 

Vegetation within the project area comprises mixed boreal forest with subordinate low-lying areas 
covered by cedar swamp and bog. Minor plantation timber stands are also present. The project 
area has been extensively logged over a significant time period, with much of the area comprising 
re-growth forest. 

Lakes account for about 40% of the project area, with most ranging between 10 m and 30 m in 
depth. A thick layer of organic mud and ooze generally overlies glacial till in lakes. This recent 
sediment layer can range in thickness from a few centimetres to more than 10 metres.

6.0 HISTORY 

Exploration at the West Cedartree Gold Project commenced in 1945 and has been conducted 
intermittently until the present day.  

Prior to 1945, the area had received little exploration. Lengyel (1998) and Rees and Campbell 
(1999) reported that Lawson briefly explored the Cedartree-Flint Lake part of the Rainy River 
region in the early 1880's for the Geological Survey of Canada, later to be followed by McInnes 
(1902). The OGS undertook geological mapping in the area in the early 1930s (Burwash, 1933). 
The area was mapped again by the OGS as part of a regional mapping program in the 1970s 
(Davies and Morin, 1976), with this work being recompiled by Johns (2007). In 1979, the 
exploration that had been completed to that time was compiled by Rivett and MacTavish (1980). 

Some of the data of this historical review is based on assessment files on work submitted by 
previous explorers on the property that are archived in the Ministry of Northern Development and 
Mines (MNDM) office in Kenora. This data is available online through the Assessment File 
Reporting Imaging (AFRI) system (http://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/). Unfortunately a 
significant proportion of the reporting of work completed at the Dogpaw Property has been 
fragmentary and hence is not readily available. 

The following section is largely taken and modified from the reports by Holbrooke (1961), Archibald 
(1989) and Dufresne (1997). 

Gold was originally discovered at what is now known No 1 zone at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit by a 
prospector named Dalby in about 1900. After Dalby's initial work, the claims were allowed to lapse. 
In 1943, Jack Kent and Roy Martin, prospecting for Noranda Mines, rediscovered the No. 1 zone 
and staked the present claim group. In 1944, the claims were prospected and several other gold 
occurrences were found.  

In the same years, Noranda drilled 82 holes totalling 2,769 metres and calculated a mineral 
resource estimate prior to the introduction of NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects, where the No. 1, 1A and 2 vein systems are estimated to contain 59,520 short tons with a 
grade of 0.45 oz/ton gold (Holbrooke (1961) and Archibald (1989).  

It must be noted that this historical estimate has no known source or data and that it must not be 
considered reliable given the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the 
historical estimate are not known. As the data used to estimate the historical resource has largely 
been lost, this information cannot be used to upgrade or verify the historical resource, in particular 
as recent data is available. It must also be stated that the author or any other qualified person has 
undertaken insufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources and that 
the issue is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources. 

The work completed by Noranda enabled the claims to be patented and these were held until 1960 
when they were sold to Consolidated Golden Arrow. The property was further prospected and 
redrilled by Golden Arrow in 1960 and 1961 with 32 holes totalling 2,679 metres being completed 
(Holbrooke, 1961).

In 1974, Noranda mapped the property and conducted a magnetometer survey. The property was 
optioned by Nuinsco in December 1987. In 1988, Nuinsco's exploration program included 19 
diamond drillholes totalling 2,332 metres and stripping on Zone No. 1 and 2. A mineral resource 
inventory of 18,229 short tons grading 0.26 oz/ton gold to a depth of 45.7 metres (150 feet) was 
calculated by Nuinsco on the No. 1 and 2 veins, to evaluate the possibility to extract the ore by 
open pit (Archibald, 1989). 

It must be noted that this historical estimate has no known source or data and that it must not be 
considered reliable given the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the 
historical estimate are not known. As the data used to estimate the historical resource has largely 
been lost, this information cannot be used to upgrade or verify the historical resource, in particular 
as recent data is available. It must also be stated that the author or any other qualified person has 
undertaken insufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources and that 
the issue is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources. 

In November 1995, Larchex Mining Exploration Inc. built an all-weather road to the vein No. 1 and 
2 site, and completed stripping and mapping of the vein system. In January 1996, a 500 ton bulk 
sample was trucked to Fort Frances and then shipped by rail to Noranda Horne smelter. The grade 
average was 0.21 oz/ton gold due to a 30% dilution. 

In 1996-1997, Houston Lake optioned the Dogpaw Lake Property from Canadian Arrow Mines 
(formerly Consolidated Golden Arrow) and has completed a number of exploration programs on the 
property up to 2008. 

Between 1997 and 2008 Houston Lake completed an additional 102 diamond drillholes (11,811.9 
metres). Data from the majority of these drillholes were utilised in the mineral resource estimate 
that is the subject of this technical report. Collar locations for these drillholes and significant assays 
recorded are contained within Appendices B and C, respectively. 

As part of broader exploration at the West Cedartree Gold Project up to 2011, Houston Lake also 
conducted extensive mechanical stripping and channel sampling at Dogpaw as well as at six other 
vein sets that are known on the property as well as extensive induced polarisation (IP) geophysical 
surveying. 

6.1 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 

There are no previous mineral resource estimates that comply with that of NI 43-101 Standards of 
Disclosure of Mineral Resource Projects  

Prior to the introduction of NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Resource Projects, two 
mineral resource estimates had been calculated for the Dogpaw Gold Deposit. The fragmented 
nature of the historic data available means that not all of the previous estimates have preserved 
documentation. As the previous mineral resource estimates were not prepared under NI 43-101 
standards, these non-compliant estimates cannot be relied upon to conform to current standards 
and definitions.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

Considerable work has been completed previously on the geology and mineralization of the 
Cameron Gold Camp Project and the surrounding region, however most detailed work is restricted 
to the Cameron Gold Project. Very little work has been conducted at the West Cedartree Gold 
Project, and regionally, the district has had little in the way of modern tectonostratigraphic 
evaluation to define the gross sequences and structural architecture with individual geological 
terranes. The following discussion is largely drawn from a number of published sources, 
predominantly workers within the OGS.  

A large body of research was conducted by David Melling, who completed an MSc thesis on the 
nearby Cameron Gold Deposit (Melling, 1986), as well as authoring and co-authoring a number of 
peer-reviewed papers (Melling, 1989; Melling and Watkinson, 1986; Melling et al., 1985; 1987; 
1988 and 1989). This remains the most comprehensive available documentation on the regional 
and local geology of the area. 

All of the lithologies discussed below have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. For brevity, 
the prefix 'meta' has been omitted. 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The West Cedartree Gold Project is located at the western end of the Late Archaean Savant Lake-
Crow Lake Belt (Trowell et al., 1980) in the Western Wabigoon Subprovince of the Superior 
Province in north-western Ontario (Figure 7.1.1), showing the various sub-provinces that comprise 
this Archaean Shield, adapted from figure in http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/mines/quebec-
mines/2004-10/superior.asp. The Wabigoon Subprovince is a 900 kilometre long, east-west 
trending, composite volcanic and plutonic terrane comprising distinct eastern and western domains 
separated by rocks of Mesoarchaean age (Percival et al., 2006). Rocks of the Western Wabigoon 
Subprovince separate gneissic terranes of the Quetico Subprovince to the south, and greenstones 
of the English River Subprovince to the north (Buck, 1988).

Coventry. 

 

The Western Wabigoon Subprovince is dominated by mafic volcanic rocks that mostly range in 
composition from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline, with large tonalitic plutonic intrusions (Percival et al., 
2006; Blackburn et al., 1991). The volcanic rocks were largely deposited between about 2.74 and 
2.72 Ga and are interpreted to represent oceanic crust (tholeiites) and volcanic arcs (calc-alkaline 
rocks), and are overlain by volcano-sedimentary sequences deposited at about 2.71 to 2.70 Ga 
(Percival et al., 2006; Corfu and Davis, 1992). These rocks are locally overlain uncomfortably by 
coarse clastic sedimentary rocks however these do not have a widespread distribution, most likely 
due to erosion. 

Supracrustal lithologies have been intruded by a wide range of plutonic rocks including synvolcanic 
batholiths (tonalite-diorite-gabbro) at about 2.735 to 2.72 Ga, younger granodiorite batholiths and 
plutons at about 2.710 Ga, sanukitoidmonzodiorite at about 2.698 to 2.690 Ga, and plutons and 
batholiths of monzogranite (2.690-2.660 Ga) as documented by a number of researchers in 
Percival et al. (2006). 

7.2 Local Geology 

The Savant Lake-Crow Lake Belt comprises a number of individual greenstone belts that are most 
commonly separated by large-scale faults and shear zones, including the Kakagi Lake and Rowan 
Lake Greenstone Belts (see Figure 7.2.1, illustrating the broad lithological distribution of 
supracrustal lithologies. Adapted from Blackburn et al. (1985)).

The area of the West Cedartree Gold Project is dominated by the crustal-scale, southeast-striking 
and northwest-dipping Cameron-Pipestone Fault (Figure 7.2.1) which extends over a strike length 
of greater than one-hundred kilometres.  

The Kakagi Lake Greenstone Belt (GSB), which hosts the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, within the West 
Cedartree Gold Project comprises a topographically-high, north- to east-facing supracrustal 
sequence that is situated to the southwest of the Cameron-Pipestone Fault, whilst the south-facing 
Rowan Lake GSB, which hosts the Cameron Gold Deposit within the Cameron Gold Project, is 
located immediately northeast of this structure. 

The geology of the Kakagi Lake GSB is dominated by the ENE-WSW trending Emm Bay Syncline, 
the axis to which is located to the south of the West Cedartree Gold Project  This large-scale fold 
structure plunges gently to the east-northeast and is terminated to the east by the crustal-scale 
Cameron-Pipestone Fault. 

Previous workers have defined the stratigraphy of the Kakagi Lake GSB as comprising two 
sequences, the lower sequence, the Rowan Group, dominated by submarine ultramafic to mafic, 
komatiitic-tholeiitic volcanic rocks and minor interflow sedimentary rocks, and an upper sequence, 
Kakagi Lake Group, consisting of intermediate to felsic tholeiitic to calc-alkaline volcaniclastic rocks 
(Lengyel, 1998). In this report, it is contended that this assumption of the Rowan Group being 
stratigraphically-below the Kakagi Lake Volcanics is incorrect given the crustal-scale Cameron-
Pipestone Fault cuts across these units.

The author does not dispute the makeup of the stratigraphic sequence, but rather the Rowan 
Group name. Hence in this report, this lower sequence is termed the Wapus Lake Volcanics, whilst 
the upper sequence remains the Kakagi Lake Volcanics.  

The Kakagi Lake Volcanics are intruded by a series of syn- to post-volcanic, mafic-ultramafic sills 
and dykes known as the Kakagi Sills which have been folded within the Emm Bay Syncline. The 
folded sequence has been also intruded by a number of felsic to alkaline bodies, the largest of 
which is the Stephens Lake Stock located to the southeast of the West Cedartree Project Area.

7.3 Property Geology 

The geology of the West Cedartree Gold Project is poorly defined due to the previous fragmented 
ownership which did not facilitate the compilation of the geology at a local scale across property 
boundaries. The below discussion is largely taken from Dufresne (1997). 

Intermediate to mafic volcanic and pyroclastic rocks dominates the supracrustal rocks at the 
Dogpaw Lake Property This sequence has been have been intruded by several irregular bodies of 
basic rocks that vary in composition from dioritic to gabbroic and by later, irregular masses of 
granite and granodiorite with numerous associated dykes and small bodies of feldspar and quartz 
porphyry. 

Pyroclastic rocks consist predominantly of unstratified agglomerates with some ash deposits and 
coarser fragmentals. The agglomerates are massive rocks composed of numerous irregular, large, 
oval or dumbbell-shaped bombs and fragments of pale rhyolite in a fine grained, slightly darker,

matrix of rhyolitic material. The fragments vary in size from an inch or so across to over two feet 
and usually form about 7% of the rock.  Bombs of dark chloritic material are common in some parts 
of the agglomerate mass.  The ash deposits are grey to buff coloured tuffs and carry small rounded 
grains of quartz.  They are fine to medium in grain size with no conspicuous bedding and appear to 
be composed of numerous small, rhyolite fragments in a matrix of the same material. 

Mafic volcanic rocks underlie the pyroclastic rocks occupying a large, east plunging syncline, 
whose axis strikes east-northeast, across the area about 8 km south of the Dogpaw Lake property.   

The mafic intrusive rocks are variable in composition and texture, and changing from the 
commonly-occurring, brownish, coarse-grained gabbro to a dark green, medium-grained diorite and 
occasionally ultramafic phases approaching peridotite in composition.  Leucocratic phases are 
common, especially near the contacts of large intrusive bodies. Where the lithology is sheared, the 
rock becomes finer grained and difficult to distinguish from the coarser phases of the andesitic 
flows.  The mafic intrusive rocks also intrude the pyroclastic unit and occur as large, irregular, sill-
like bodies, ranging in strike from a few hundred metres to several kilometres.   

The Dogpaw Lake Property lies along the northern edge and just west of the widest part of the 
sequence of pyroclastic rocks. Across the central part of the property, the pyroclastic sequence has 
been intruded by a 1,200 metre wide mass of gabbro-diorite which trends northeast across the 
claims and noses out in the extreme north-eastern corner of the property.  The extent of the 
intrusive south of the property is unknown but it has been traced for at least 1.6 km in that direction. 

Felsic intrusive bodies such as the Stephen Lake Stock intrude the above sequence and are 
dominantly hornblende-biotite granodiorite in composition. These lithologies are normally red in 
colour, medium-grained, and occur as oval shaped masses up to 10km long to 3 km wide.   

Feldspar porphyry dykes are common in many parts of the area  These rocks are usually medium-
grained with sharp 1 to 5 mm light feldspar phenocrysts in a fine quartz rich groundmass. The 
dykes very in width from about two metres to over 30 metres and some can be traced along their 
strike for 760m. The youngest rocks in the area appear to comprise consist of a few, north-west 
trending dykes of younger gabbro or diabase. The dykes are from 15 to 60m wide and several can 
be traced for over 5km.  They are very similar in appearance to the gabbro phase of the mafic 
intrusive rocks. 

7.3.1 Structural Geology 

Little research has taken place regarding the structural history of the Savant Lake-Crow Lake Belt, 
with the work of Buck (1988) mostly confined to the Cameron-Pipestone Fault.  However, despite 
the lack of regional studies, at least two regional deformational events are recognized to have 
affected the rocks within the Cameron Gold Project. The first deformation event (D1) is most likely 
manifest by bedding-parallel fabrics (S1) and rare, tight to isoclinal folds (F1) that have been 
subsequently refolded (Figure 7.3.2). Evidence for this event is poorly preserved and is only 
sporadically observed in metre-scale outcrops where sedimentary lithologies are exposed. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

The second regional deformational event (D2) dominates the map pattern of the region and is 
directly associated with most of the large-scale structural features evident across the region. The 
D2 event comprised NNW-SSE directed shortening resulting in the formation of large open to tight 
folds (F2) with mostly upright fold axes that commonly plunge towards the WSW. The Shingwak 
Lake Anticline and Kakagi Lake Syncline which occur to the east and to the west of the Cameron-
Pipestone Fault respectively, are the most prominent examples of structures resulting from this 
event. 

As the Cameron-Pipestone Fault (CPF) cuts these two folds, the event associated with this crustal-
scale shear zone is most likely temporally later and possibly associated with a third deformational 
event (D3), or possibly reactivated by D3. The CPF comprises a northwest-southeast-trending, 
steeply northeast-dipping zone of highly-sheared and foliated lithologies that extend over a width of 
up to 3,000 metres and a strike of greater than 100 km (Buck, 1988; Melling, 1986).  The PCF is 
interpreted to occur in the south-western parts of Cameron Gold Project, however no exposures 
within this area outcrop due to extensive swamp and till cover. Buck (1988) reports that the CPF 
comprises chlorite schist where the deformation zone cuts mafic rocks and sericite (-quartz) schist 
where the CPF cuts felsic lithologies, and that due to intense shearing and alteration, compositional 
layering is developed parallel to foliation. 

Within the West Cedartree Gold Project, all lithologies, except the late mafic intrusive, are 
overprinted by deformation, mostly in the form of shearing. A number of smaller, subsidiary shear 
and fracture zones are known in the area and it is apparently in these minor structures that the 
numerous occurrences of gold are found. 

At the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, the most prominent structure is the northwest-trending Dalby Shear 
Zone (DSZ), which extends over a strike of about 1 km and dips steeply to the northeast. The DSZ 
is comprised of at least two parallel structures, between 30 m and 60 m apart. The west structure 
truncated the Number One zone and displaces it about three to 20 metres in a dextral sense 
(Archibald, 1989). The DSZ appears to be unmineralized. 

Significant local shearing is observed along contacts between different lithologies such as the 
gabbro sills and the younger mafic volcanic rocks. 

A typical cross-section through the Dogpaw Gold Deposit is contained within Figure 7.3.1.

7.3.2 Regolith and Glacial Geomorphology 

Like much of the Canadian Shield, the West Cedartree Gold Project is mantled by unconsolidated 
glacial overburden. Glacial cover at the project was deposited during the Late Wisconsin glaciation 
by the Labradorean sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Minning et al, 1994).  

Glacial sediments are dominated by meltout till (supraglacial till) comprising unsorted and poorly-
stratified sandy conglomerate, with clasts dominated by granitoid and gneiss that range from 
cobble to boulder in size. These sediments overlie more restricted basal till (subglacial till), which 
contains angular cobble-sized clasts of mostly supracrustal lithologies in a clay-loam matrix. 
Glacier transport as recorded by striae is towards 190° (±10°). 

The thickness of glacial overburden over the Dogpaw Gold Deposit is relatively thin and usually in 
the order of 1-3m.

7.4 Mineralization 

Little to no detailed studies has been completed on the mineralization at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit. 
The following is a brief outline of the mineralization and associated alteration that forms the 
Dogpaw Gold Deposit 

Mineralization Style 

The mineralization occurring at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit comprises pyrite-silica, largely as 
replacements and breccia within both gabbro and mafic volcanic host rocks (Figure 7.4.1). The 
mineralization varies in thickness considerably, particularly over narrow intervals, ranging from 30 
cm to more than five metres, with an average width of two to three metres. Significant pyrite is 
especially associated with high-grade zones, with ounce plus results commonly associated with 
pyrite in the range of 10%. Minor chalcopyrite is also recorded as associated with pyrite and visible 
gold is common, especially in mineralized material of very high grade. 

Alteration 

Like the above section relating to mineralization, the alteration associated with the Dogpaw Gold 
Deposit has undergone limited documentation. The alteration associated with mineralization 
dominantly comprises carbonate, albite and silica in the immediate selvages bounding sulphidic 
zones extending over several centimetres to a few metres wide, with strong chlorite alteration and 
minor pyrite and pyrrhotite in a more distal position (Figure 7.4.1). Work by Dufresne (1997) 
indicates the chloritic alteration halo is commonly mineralized, where in previous work it was not 
sampled and analysed.

Gold Deposit highlighting the sulphidic breccia style of mineralization and adjacent

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Introduction 

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit forms part of the clan of gold mineral systems occurring in greenstones 
(Figure 8.1.1, showing schematic cross-section of the key geologic elements of the main gold 
systems and their crustal levels of emplacement. Note logarithmic depth scale. From Robert et al 
(2007) as modified from Paulsen et al (2000) and Robert (2004). Source – Coventry) that have 
traditionally been classified as orogenic, whereby a clan is a family of deposits that are either 
formed by related processes or that are distinct products of large-scale hydrothermal processes 
(Robert et al. 2007). Greenstone-hosted gold deposits are the most important of the clan with some 
nineteen deposits with greater than 10 Moz contained gold identified and with almost 400 Moz of 
total endowment worldwide. 

Figure 8.1.1 Schematic cross-section showing the key geologic elements of the main 
gold systems and their crustal levels of emplacement. Note logarithmic depth scale. From 
Robert et al (2007) as modified from Paulsen et al (2000) and Robert (2004). Source – 
Coventry. 

 

 
Originally, the orogenic model applied strictly to syn-tectonic vein-type deposits formed at mid-
crustal levels in compressional or transtensional tectonic settings, however over time the term has 
been progressively broadened to include deposits that are post-orogenic relative to processes at 
their crustal depth of formation (Robert et al, 2007). Ambiguities in the classification of greenstone-
hosted gold deposits has given rise to varying interpretations that a number of different types and 
ages of deposits exist (Robert et al, 2005) or that all deposits are based on a single, all-
encompassing orogenic model with a few atypical gold-base metal deposits (Groves et al, 2003). 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

Orogenic greenstone mineralization as described above typically comprises quartz-carbonate veins 
that are commonly laminated in reverse shear zones and as shallowly-dipping extensional veins. 
The veins are associated with sericite-carbonate-pyrite alteration and are primarily late, 
overprinting all lithologies. Quartz is the dominant gangue mineral followed by carbonate and 
generally less than 5% sulphide, commonly in the form of pyrite. Tourmaline, scheelite and 
tellurium are common minor minerals, whilst silver, arsenic and tungsten are commonly prevalent. 

Robert et al (2005, 2007) highlighted that prolific greenstone belts can contain gold-only and gold-
base metal deposits that do not conform to the typical orogenic model, such as Red Lake, Hemlo, 
Malartic, Doyon, Fimiston, Wallaby, Kanowna Belle and Boddington, in the Horne and La Ronde 
gold-rich VMS deposits (Dubé and Gosselin, 2006). Although atypical deposits display similar 
regional-scale controls and commonly occur in the same camps as typical orogenic deposits, they 
differ in styles of mineralization, metal association, interpreted crustal levels of emplacement and 
relative age (Robert et al, 2005, 2007).  

Mineralization from atypical greenstone deposits range from disseminated-stockwork zones at 
Wallaby and Kanowna Belle to crustiform-textured veins with associated sulphidic wallrock 
replacements and quartz breccia veins at Red Lake and Fimiston, to less common sulphide-rich 
veins (Robert et al, 2005, 2007). These atypical deposits also show a close spatial association with 
high-level porphyry stocks and dykes (Robert et al, 2005, 2007). 

These atypical deposits comprise low quartz, but often high-silica systems, with pyrite being the 
dominant sulphide, often in conjunction with tellurides, molybdenite, magnetite, haematite and 
sulphates. Gold may often also be associated with silver, telluride, vanadium, barium, 
molybdenum, arsenic, antimony and mercury. Alteration comprises sericite-albite-carbonate-pyrite 
and potassium feldspar-carbonate-pyrite. 

Atypical greenstone deposits are also characterised as having been formed relatively early in the 
development of the greenstone belts, prior to the folding of their host units during the main part of 
shortening of their host belts, and are commonly overprinted by orogenic veins (Robert et al, 2005, 
2007). These deposits share many of the characteristics and origins of the alkalic, porphyry-style 
deposits of the oxidised intrusion-related clan.  

The bulk of the mineralization comprising the Dogpaw Gold Deposit can be regarded as being part 
of the atypical greenstone family, with the mineralization style being dominated by sulphidic veins 
and disseminated sulphide replacement. It is apparent that the mineralization at the Dogpaw Gold 
Deposit is silica-rich, but quartz-poor, and that the alteration assemblage is dominated by silica-
carbonate-pyrite which are other characteristics of deposits of the atypical classification. 

The lack of detailed work completed on the mineralisation and associated alteration at the Dogpaw 
Gold Deposit precludes further comparisons regarding the mineralization type.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Introduction 

For the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, work conducted by Coventry during the due diligence period has 
been restricted to desktop studies and the reclogging and resampling of key drillholes within the 
mineralized zone. 

The main work completed has been the implementation of Coventry's modern and rigid QA/QC 
sampling program which was undertaken in conjunction with the relogging and resampling  of a  
suite of historic drillholes drilled through the mineralization and previously sampled, . This work is 
documented in Section 11.3. 

In addition to the Dogpaw Gold Deposit, a number of other gold deposits, prospects and 
occurrences are located within the West Cedartree Gold Project, including the Dubenski and Angel 
Hill Gold Deposits and the Robertson and McLennan Prospects. National Instrument 43-101 
compliant mineral resource estimates were calculated for the Dubenski Gold Deposit in 2013 (Ball 
et al., 2013 and for the Angel Hill Gold Deposit in October, 2005 (Cutting and Anthony, 2005). 
Numerous other gold occurrences are known within the Project area (Figure 9.1).

Gold Camp Project. Source – Coventry. 

 

A brief review of the Dubenski and Angel Hill Gold Deposits and the Robertson and McLennan 
Prospects is included below.

9.1.1 Dubenski Gold Deposit 

The Dubenski Gold Deposit is located 2.2 km to the east-southeast of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit. 
The mineralization at the Dubenski Gold Deposit is hosted by felsic to intermediate 'tuff' and lapilli 
tuff or sericite schist, and is is hosted by a sub-vertical shear zone over a strike of 400m that is up 
to 20m wide and has been delineated to a vertical depth of more than 150m. The mineralisation is 
open in all directions. 

Gold is associated with fine-grained pyrite and free gold associated with carbonate, sericite, silica 
and locally, fuchsite alteration, with higher-grade zones corresponding with strong silicification. 
Although gold is strongly associated with pyrite and silica, not all pyrite carries gold and not all 
silicified zones are auriferous. Visible gold is common throughout the deposit and occurs along 
foliation planes and, less commonly, as disseminations. 

The Dubenski mineralisation was first discovered in the 1930s, with a 27m deep exploration shaft 
constructed in 1946, which was further deepened to 40m in 1950. Exploration has subsequently 
been undertaken intermittently, with the majority of previous work being completed in the late 
1990s and more recently by Houston Lake Mining Inc. 

In January 2013, Coventry released a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate (Ball et al., 
2013) which is contained within Table 9.1.1.

*Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to 

reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. 

9.1.2 Angel Hill Gold Deposit 

The Angel Hill Gold Deposit is located 1.1 km to the southwest of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit (Figure 
9.1.1). The mineralization at Angel Hill is contained within a shear zone at the contact of differential 
units within a gabbro sill. It comprises silica, carbonate and sericite alteration that ranges from 1-11 
m wide over a strike of 130 m and to a vertical depth of 75 m. Visible gold is common in 
discontinuous quartz veins. The mineralisation is also associated with pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena 
and molybdenite. The mineralization is open along strike to the south and at depth. 

On 20 October 2005, HLM announced a NI 43-101 compliant resource for the Angel Hill Gold 
Deposit (Cutting and Anthony, 2005) which is contained within Table 9.1.2 

In May 2006 HLM extracted a 1,041 tonne bulk sample that yielded a total of 190 ounces of gold at 
an average grade of 5.67 g/t gold after processing at a third party mill.

9.1.3 Robertson Prospect 

The Robertson Prospect is located 2.3 km south-southwest of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit (Figure 
9.1.1) and comprises a northeast-southwest trending mineralised shear zone within gabbro that 
has been delineated over a strike length of 200m to a vertical depth of 120m. The mineralisation 
comprises disseminated pyrite associated with silica-albite-carbonate alteration.  

The Robertson Prospect was identified by HLM from reconnaissance rock chip sampling that 
recorded anomalous results. This was followed up by some three mechanical stripping and channel 
sampling programs that recorded further positive results, albeit over narrow sample intervals.  

In 2010 and 2011, a total of 15 diamond drillholes for 1,980 metres were completed, with seven of 
the holes recording economic intercepts, including:  

• 20.5m @ 2.17 g/t Au from 62.0m, including 5.6m @ 4.08 g/t Au from 74m (R-10-05)  

• 11.9m @ 3.10 g/t Au from 149.1m (R-11-15)  

• 16.7m @ 2.00 g/t Au from 19.8m (R-10-01)  

• 12.7m @ 1.73 g/t Au from 122.3m (R-11-15)  

• 17.3m @ 1.22 g/t Au from 2.3m (R-10-02)  

• 4.5m @ 2.10 g/t Au from 20.0m (R-11-13)  

The drilling conducted has resulted in the delineation of a coherent zone of mineralisation that 
hangs together well from section to section over a strike of 180m, striking NE-SW and dipping 
steeply (70-80°) to the SE. The plunge to the system appears to be to the NE. The main part of the 
mineralisation intercepted appears to comprise a single lode that bifurcates into two lodes at depth. 
The main mineralised zone remains open along strike to the NE and at depth. 

Encouraging, about 150m directly along strike to the NE of the main area of drilling at Robertson is 
a cluster of anomalous rock chip samples, ranging from 0.161 g/t Au to 7.59 g/t Au recorded from a 
40m x 40m area. If as interpreted, these rocks represent the extension of the main mineralised 
zone at Robertson, then the strike length of the prospect is greater than 320m.  

9.1.4 McLennan Prospect 

The McLennan Prospect is located 1.4 km southwest of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit (Figure 9.1.1) 
and is a historic gold occurrence that has been known from at least the 1940's. The mineralisation 
at McLennan comprises silica-pyrite breccia which is located sub-parallel to a relatively thin shear 
zone within mafic volcanic rocks in two apparent zones, about 2-5m thick and which may extend 
over a strike of about 450m.

In 1944, Sylvanite Gold Mines completed trenching and shallow diamond drilling over a 350m strike 
length recording results up to 5.5m @ 7.2 g/t Au in trenches and 1.0m @ 18.37 g/t Au in drilling. In 
1985 Falconbridge Limited completed an additional drilling program which largely repeated the 
Sylvanite results. 

HLM completed sporadic work at McLennan between 2004-2008 and later in 2011, which variably 
set about testing the mineralisation with diamond drilling following the completion of a project-wide 
IP survey. Specifically, HLM targeted IP chargeability anomalies it interpreted being the 
geophysical signature of the mineralisation, rather than interpreted extensions of the known 
trenches. This work recorded variable results, with four holes that were completed underneath the 
main trenches (Trench 1 and 2) returning the following results:  

• 9.0m @ 4.04 g/t Au from 26.0m ( WC-06-35)  

• 5.8m @ 5.80 g/t Au from 24.0m (WC-04-27)  

• 7.7m @ 2.24 g/t Au from 53.0m (WC-06-36)  

It is interpreted that this thicker, higher grade zone extends to the SW over a strike of about 80m 
and has not been tested by previous explorers. Also, the depth extents below the known intercepts 
have also yet to be followed up. Falconbridge recommended additional drilling to target the thicker 
portion of the high-grade shoot that is interpreted to plunge towards the southwest.  

DataGeo has been unable to verify the information for the Angel Hill Gold Deposit and the 
Roberston and McLennan Prospects. The information for the West Cedartree Gold Project is not 
necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property that is the subject of the technical report.

Coventry itself has not conducted any drilling on this Deposit thus all data is historical in nature and 
provided to Coventry when the West Cedartree project was purchased.  

The programs between 1944 and 1988 as listed in Table 10.1.1 are poorly documented 
(summarised in Dufresne 1997) and no core is retained relating to these holes. Whilst surface 
evidence of these drilling programs is in some places noted there is insufficient evidence/data to 
validate any of the drilling. 

Since 1997 102 drillholes (all diamond cored) totalling 11,812 metres have been completed within 
the general location of the Dogpaw Deposit in the three most recent drilling campaigns listed in 
Table 10.1.1. All of this drilling has been completed from surface. 

The great majority of this later drilling was able to be verified in position with hole collars re-
surveyed by Coventry using Trimble R3 GPS survey equipment coupled with a known local base 
station control. The recording of collar orientations and dip was made at the same time based on 
measurements taken from the casing if available.  

An extensive core farm is located on site and has been reviewed by the author. 

DataGeo considers that the majority of the drilling information from these three programs would be 
suitable in terms of confidence in spatial positioning to be utilised in the mineral resource estimate 
for the deposit.

• 1997 – test for near surface mineralisation in locations along strike from an existing pit and 
defined by previous drilling. Drilling to mostly 100m depth on 20 to 30m spaced sections 
with holes 20 to 40m apart of section; two (2) deeper holes to test for depth extension 
beneath old pit - to depth of 200m below surface 

• 2007 – infill drilling in areas using surface stripped locations as a guide on four sections 
between 20 and 25m apart with holes between 10 and 40m on section; Plus deeper drilling 
to test continuity of and test for extension to  mineralisation at 150m to 200m depth below 
surface.  

• 2008 – infill drilling on 20 to 25m spaced sections to mostly a depth of 80 to 120m below 
surface. On sections holes between 5 and 30m apart. Drilling concentrated in western and 
in the central parts of the deposit 

Drillhole collar information and significant intercepts recorded in drilling are contained within 
Appendices A and B. 

10.2 Drilling and Logging Procedures 

From the information provided/available there is no documentation on the method of drilling, 
sample collection, site sample preparation and logging. The information below comes from 
summary documents or related projects operated by the same company in the same or in a similar 
time period. 

10.2.1 1997 HLM/CAM JV 

The program was drilled by Benoit Diamond Drilling of Val d'Or, Quebec. No other information is 
available. 

10.2.2 2007/2008 HLM 

HLM managed or had managed on their behalf drilling programs at the nearby Dubenski Deposit in 
a similar time frame so it can be assumed that the drilling at Dogpaw was undertaken using similar 
techniques and controls (Ball 2012b). 

HLM's habit was to: - 

• Outsource management to qualified consultants to locate, orientate, log and shutdown 
each hole 

• Use local (to Ontario) diamond drilling contractors 

• Drill NQ size core 

• Downhole survey each hole (using Reflex EZ SHOT® (single shot) instrument or similar) 
with the drill foreman taking dip and azimuth readings approximately every 50 m. – see 
section 2.1.4.2 for discussion 

• the casing was left in the hole and the hole was then labelled with the hole number and 
capped.

• The drill core was placed in wooden core boxes which were labelled on one end, with 
dymo tape recording the drillhole number, box number and core interval contained within 
the box (these have been observed in the core yard). The core was transported to a central 
core yard it was logged and marked by a geologist for sampling 

• Upon completion of the drilling program, licensed Surveyors were usually contracted to 
survey the collar locations. 

The review of the core indicated that intervals sampled were mechanically half cut, either by a 
splitter or with a brick saw.  

10.3 Drilling Pattern and Density  

The drilling density at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit for those holes to be utilised in the mineral 
resource estimate varies along strike between 20m to 30m with occasional drilling more closely 
spaced for the first 100m from surface. Below this depth drilling is not consistently spaced with 
depth with holes being up to 60m apart. On section (down dip) spacing varies from 5m to 40m with 
the drilling density decreasing with depth in this range. The central part of the Deposit is drilled to 
the greatest depth. 

The true thickness of the individual mineralised zones at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit ranges between 
two and up to 10 metres within a shear zone up top 30m wide. 

The length for samples collected from the mineralisation varies between 0.1 – 2.17m with the 
majority at 1m. There are some un-sampled intervals within the mineralisation interpretation. 

In the opinion of the author, the quantity and spacing of the drill data is appropriate for mineral 
resource estimation. The quality of the information is discussed in Sections 11 and 12.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Site Preparation, Transportation and Sample Security 

The documentation of historic field procedures applied by even the most recent explorers at the 
Dogpaw Deposit, including details regarding sample collection, preparation, transportation and 
security, and analytical techniques, is poor to non-existent.  

Based on observation of the core all previous sampling was selective on the basis of the visually 
interpreted presence of mineralization. 

All previous drilling available to be utilised in the mineral resource was diamond core of NQ size. 

From observation drill core was cut using a masonry saw or similar. The inclusion of control 
samples is assumed, and is sometimes referenced in documentation, but details regarding this are 
not documented. 

The only mention of the drilling programs from 1997 onwards is in Dufresne (1997) which stated 
that 41 NQ diamond holes were drilled between Feb 18th and April 19th 1997 by Benoit Diamond 
Drilling of Val D'Or of Quebec. 

A random review of the drill core stored at the project indicated that historically very good core 
recoveries were achieved in these surface drillholes (+95%).  

In light of the lack of historic supporting information concerning the quality of this data, a suitable 
re-sampling program to validate historic results was implemented – see Section 11.3.  

11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

Hardcopy scans of the laboratory certificates of analysis were provided by Coventry which 
indicated that the three analytical programs had been carried out at TSL Laboratories of 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 

TSL conforms to requirements of ISO/IEC Standard 17025 guidelines, is accredited for specific 
tests (including gold gravimetric finish) from the Standards Councils of Canada. In April 2004 i t  
had a 2003 dated ISO 9002 certificate of laboratory proficiency that meets assay requirements 
outlined for NI 43-101 compliance (Source: http://www.tsllabs.com/qa.htm).    

Using the certificates of analysis and the TSL Website the methodology adopted for sample 
preparation and analysis can be assumed to be: - 

11.2.1 Preparation Method 

Whilst not recorded on the Certificates the TSL website describes the "current" preparation method 
as: -

• Samples are crushed in oscillating jaw crushers to 70% passing 10 mesh (1.70mm). 
Samples are riffle split; typically a 250g sub sample is pulverized, the remaining is stored 
as reject. Ring-mill pulverizers grind samples to 95% passing 150 mesh (106 micron). At 
the beginning of each shift and/or the start of a new group, samples are screened to 
ensure correct particle sizes. Crushers, rifflers, and pans are cleaned with compressed air 
between samples. Pulverizing pots and rings are brushed, hand cleaned, and air blown. 
Our pulverizers are capable of grinding up to 1000g. Crushers are capable of crushing as 
fine as 95% passing 10 mesh. 

It can be assumed that the preparation techniques adopted by HLM at least for the 2007 and 2008 
work is very similar to the above given such methodologies were adopted for the Dubenski Deposit 
which was carried out at a similar time. 

11.2.2 Analytical Method -  

All assays adopted fire assay techniques. The Laboratory sheet identifies the method name and 
the website provides the following summary: - 

• Trace level gold analysis begins with a flux mixture of litharge, soda, borax, silica, 
fluorspar with further oxidants or reductants added as required. The relative concentrations 
of the fluxing materials are adjusted to suit the type of sample being analyzed. Crucibles 
are placed into trays of 24 and ~120 grams of flux is added. Twenty samples, two repeats, 
a standard and a blank are weighed into the crucibles, then placed into a tumbler and 
mixed for 10 minutes. When mixed, the samples are removed, inquarted and fused. The 
resultant lead button is then cupelled. After cupellation the Doré bead is dissolved in aqua 
regia and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Gold values >1000 ppb are 
routinely analyzed by FA/Gravimetric 

• Gravimetric gold analysis begins with a flux mixture of litharge, soda, borax, silica, 
fluorspar with further oxidants or reductants added as required. The relative concentrations 
of the fluxing materials are adjusted to suit the type of sample being analyzed. Crucibles 
are placed into trays of 24 and ~120 grams of flux is added. Twenty samples, three repeats 
and a standard are weighed into the crucibles, then placed into a tumbler and mixed for 10 
minutes. When mixed, the samples are removed, inquarted and fused. The resultant lead 
button is then cupelled. After cupellation the subsequent Doré bead is flattened, placed in a 
porcelain cup and parted with a dilute nitric acid solution. The gold obtained is decanted 
with de-ionized water, dried, annealed, and weighed on a microbalance. 

The only potential difference observed is that the threshold for use of gravimetric use was 3000 
ppb for the work done on this project. 

DataGeo considers that based on the assumption that the above methods were applied then such 
methods are appropriate for the style of mineralization being considered.

11.3 Quality Control 

11.3.1 Re-Sample Program 

There is no reporting of included QAQC data from any of the three drilling programs and as such 
Coventry undertook a re-sample program from the existing core in order to validate the gold 
assays. 

Data 

Samples taken from throughout 20 holes spaced along the strike of the Deposit were selected as 
listed in Table 11.3.1.

Program Methodology 

The following methodology (taken from Coventry's Standard operating Procedures)was adopted for 
the sampling of the historical core: - 

• "When resampling historic core begin by taking an inventory of the hole to confirm all 
necessary boxes are present and that the core is either whole core or halved core (do not 
resample quartered core). 

• Once the requested hole has been laid out in the core shack the geotechnical personnel 
can begin meter marking.  

• Meter marking is followed by RQD and box measurements. (Confirm that no additional 
data is required, ex. Magsus) 

• The geologist can then mark the required resamples onto the core, making sure to match 
the resamples with the historic sample tags in the core box. 

• A density/SG measurement will be taken for every resample as well as every lithology. The 
geologist will mark these. 

• Resample tags can be entered – following QAQC procedures (refer to sampling 
guidelines). If the core has previously been sampled (halved) substitute a blank where the 
duplicate should fall." 

• The core is then cut and quartered, bagged and tied with security tags. The geologist then 
puts in the re-sample tags including a standard followed by a blank every 20 samples on 
the odd numbered tags (10, 30, 50, etc.), followed by an additional blank on the even 
numbered tags (00, 20, 40, etc.) for quality control purposes.  

Once complete the samples are transported by road to Activation Laboratories in Dryden, Ontario. 

The sample preparation and analysis method was 1A3 - Au Fire Assay – Gravimetric described 
as follows: - 

• The received samples are compared to the sample dispatch sheets and then dried for a 
minimum of 8 hours. The entire core sample is then crushed to nominal -10 mesh (1.7mm), 
mechanically split (riffle) to obtain a representative sample and this sample is pulverised to 
at least 95% -150 mesh (105 microns). The mills are mild steel thus do not induce Cr or Ni 
contamination. Between samples the mills and the riffle is cleaned using sand.  

• A 30 g sized pulverised sample is mixed with fire assay fluxes (borax, soda ash, silica, 
litharge) and with Ag added as a collector and the mixture is placed in a fire clay crucible, 
the mixture is preheated at 850°C, intermediate 950 °C and finish 1060 °C, the entire 
fusion process should last 60 minutes.  The crucibles are then removed from the assay 
furnace and the molten slag (lighter material) is carefully poured from the crucible into a 
mould, leaving a lead button at the base of the mould.  The lead button is then placed in a 
preheated cupel which absorbs the lead when cupelled at 950°C to recover the Ag (doré 
bead) + Au.

• Au is separated from the Ag in the doré bead by parting with nitric acid. The resulting gold 
flake is annealed using a torch.  The gold flake remaining is weighed gravimetrically on a 
microbalance.  

The analytical detection limits are 0.03g/t to 10000g/t Au.   

It is considered by DataGeo that the method of analysis adopted for the Coventry re-sample 
program is equivalent to that used to generate results for the for the existing samples. 

11.3.2 Results of Program 

Overall  

The re-sample program statistics were: - 

• Total number of re-sample results - 290 

• Number of re-sample results within mineral interpretation - 115 

• Total number of sample intervals (including those not sampled) within mineralisation 
interpretation is 459 (28 of these are either not sampled or have no sample). 

Based on numbers of samples the re-sample rate is 25% (115 samples from 459 intervals including 
those not sampled). 

Based on length of sample which was re-sampled the rate is 22% (86.3m of the 395.3m of drilling 
within the mineralisation including those not sampled). 

The length weighted average grade for all pairs of samples is shown in Table 11.3.2.

A top-cut of 30g/t is chosen to mimic what is likely to be utilised as a statistical upper limit for 
resource assessment. It is not based on an assessment of the data but does limit the influence of 
potential statistical outliers of which there were 7 in total, these are shown in Table 11.3.3.

The assays bolded were subject to the top-cut reported in Table 11.3.3. One "pair" (Hole DP-08-64, 
interval 123.65m to 124.20m) has an extreme variation between the original and re-sample grades 
which is suspicious given the magnitude. This may require investigation.  

The sample pair results within the mineralisation are plotted using scatter plots in Figures 11.3.2 
and 11.3.3.

The correlations shown within the graphs (visually and by the value for the correlation constant 
[R2]) are generally poor. This would be expected given the most likely high local grade variability 
which makes assay repeatability problematic.

The observations from Figures 11.3.4 and 11.3.5 are that the accumulation by intercept does little 
to improve the correlation when compared to the individual samples. However one intercept 
(circled in red in Figure 11.3.5) is significantly displaced from the trend line and if this is removed 
(see Figure 11.3.6) the correlation becomes acceptable.

Figure 11.3.6 Scatter Plot – Mineralisation Comparison – top cut intercepts with outlier 
removed. 

 

The intercept removed comes from DP-08-69 and is 1.2m long consisting of 2 samples. One of 
these samples (original sample #223568; re-sample #1073055) over an interval length of 0.55m 
returned a resample value of 13.7g/t compared to an original sample value of 0.005 (BDL) which 
heavily influenced the intercept result. Given that there were only two samples in the intercept the 
variation experienced is not that unexpected – similar to the individual sample comparison. 

11.3.3 Quality of Re-sample Results 

Coventry included in the re-sample program both certified standards and uncertified blanks 
(assumed barren material) with the samples submitted to the laboratory for quality control 
purposes. In total there were 23 Standards submitted of which one failed a +/-3 Std Dev test and 
one was mis-labeled and when corrected passed the same test. There were 45 blanks submitted 
and all but one returned an assay of "below the detection limit" of the analytical technique. The one 
that failed returned 0.1g/t and whilst this is a statistically significant difference one fail in 45 is 
acceptable.  

Whilst this does not improve supportability of the original results in terms of quality it does provide a 
basis of support for the re-sample results in a standalone sense.  

11.3.4 Conclusions 

The spatial representation of the re-samples within the program combined with the number of re-
samples taken within the mineralisation interpretation (>20% of total number of samples) provides 
sufficient evidence in the top-cut average results obtained to confirm that the assays within the data

set to be utilised for mineral resource estimate are representative of the gold content of the 
Deposit. 

There are risks with the use of re-sample information in a gold deposit particularly a deposit with 
demonstrated nuggetty gold producing a high local variance and hence potentially great variation in 
assay response. This coupled with the reduced sample volume (1/4 core compared to ½ core) can 
potentially produce quite variable results particularly if the gold grade is "high".  

The value of such a large program is that if the average of the re-sample values approaches that of 
the original samples then it provides confidence, in light of no other conflicting data, that the original 
assay results are representative of the mineralisation sampled. DataGeo believes that the results 
achieved by the re-sample program support the original assay results as being representative. 

11.3.5 Other Information 

Upon inspection of the drillhole dataset it was noted that on two occasions pairs of drillholes from 
the different programs appeared to intersect vein v007. Whilst no documentation has been 
provided which relates to the purpose of this drilling the information contained is useful for 
comparative purposes. 

Drillholes DP-97-16 and DP-08-66 are recorded as being in very close proximity; at the intercept 
depth within v007 they are approximately 3m apart. The composites (see section 14.4) within the 
vein are shown in Table 11.3.5.

The results in Table 11.3.5 provide support for the downhole vein width as would be expected 
given the close proximity of the holes. The average grade highlights considerable variability but as 
demonstrated in the re-sample program results such variance is not altogether unexpected. 

Holes DP-97-04 and DP-08-67 are also recorded as being in very close proximity, at the intercept 
depth, being approximately 3 to 5m apart. The composites within the vein are shown in Table 
11.3.6.

In this comparison the reverse to that of the previous pair is observed, i.e. highly variable intercept 
length but very similar grade. 

Given the style of mineralisation the grade variation is not that unexpected however the length of 
intersection difference in the second pair may indicate the influence of the less than optimum 
downhole positioning (see Section 12.1.2).  

Overall this limited comparison is somewhat supportive but does suffer reproducibility problems in 
both downhole length and grade at the local scale

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

The drillhole information collected was managed by the individual companies operating and/or 
managing the project at the time. Coventry reviewed the information as supplied to generate a 
database which was supplied to DataGeo. 

This database was reviewed for content accuracy. 

12.1 Data Location and Reference Grid 

All of the project drillhole information has been referenced to the NAD83, Zone 15 datum. This was 
implemented by re-survey, by Coventry personnel, of positions in the field that can be confidently 
identified and/or transformation using known translations recorded by past companies involved in 
the project. All new field information is acquired on this grid, based on established datum controls 
which were reviewed in the field as part of the site visit. 

The Dogpaw drillhole information and all subsequent information/estimates generated from this 
information is located on the Dogpaw Local Grid. Coventry provided the following information 
related to this grid. 

Origin of Grid; 

• Collar of drillhole DP08-94 

• Local :50000E 100000N 

• UTM NAD83 Z15: 436314.440E  5464818.612N  

• Grid Baseline Azimuth: 64° East of true North 

The conversion from UTM to Local Grid is achieved using the following formulae: - 

Local East = (Coeff A*UTM Easting) + (Coeff B* UTM Northing) + (Coeff C) 

Local North = (Coeff D*UTM Easting) + (Coeff E* UTM Northing) + (Coeff F) 

The Transformation Coefficients above are: - 

• Coefficient A = 0.89879579209082294 

• Coefficient B = 0.43837702018208802 

• Coefficient C = -2737808.4833984375 

• Coefficient D = -0.43837200994312298 

• Coefficient E = 0.89879413647577167 

• Coefficient F = -4620478.884765625 

In addition, as part of the site visit, the author inspected three (3) random drillhole locations on the 
Dogpaw Deposit to take GPS readings. These were later compared with the drillhole location

information recorded in the supplied database. The comparison validated the information within the 
database, allowing for the level of accuracy of the GPS. This is detailed in Ball (2012a). 

The elevation of each drillhole was also referenced against that assigned to survey control and 
found to be acceptable. 

Given the supporting information and the author's review, the information is proven sufficiently 
accurate to be utilised with confidence for mineral resource estimation. 

12.1.1 Geological and Assay Information 

On a previous occasion the author visited Coventry's Toronto office and examined the system 
which had been established for validating, collating and uploading drill data. This was found to be 
adequate for the purpose.  

To further ensure that geological and assay information was stored correctly, it was decided to 
initiate a brief audit of the drillhole information provided in the database by comparing the results in 
the database with assay certificates and geological logging sheets provided.  

This audit/review (Ball 2013) provided no evidence that the database contained any information 
which was not an accurate representation of the field and laboratory data with respect to the assay 
grades and downhole intervals that they are assigned to.  

One concern is the lack of downhole survey information which is summarised as follows: - 

• DP-97 series holes - acid tube readings at various depths 

• DP-07 and 08 series hole - no recordings noted on the logs. 

As such the arbiter of sample downhole location is defined mostly by collar position and 
orientation/dip of the hole at the collar. There is every confidence in the collar position from the re-
survey undertaken and correctly recorded in the database however with a great number of holes 
only having this record there is some doubt as to the down position of samples. In addition there is 
no way of determining orientation drift of any holes. The lack of information particularly with respect 
to the 2007 and 2008 series holes is considered unusual given that the same company (HLM) 
carried single shot orientation control on drilling elsewhere within the West Cedartree Project in 
similar years. 

Whilst the database might not contain all information relating to the Deposit that which describes 
the geological characteristics and the grade is appropriate. There is some uncertainty in the 
downhole position given the lack of downhole survey control however given the relatively short 
length of the holes such discrepancies are not thought to be significant.  

It is the author's opinion that the data comprising the Dogpaw Gold Project is adequate for the 
purposes used in this Technical Report.

13.0 PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

No investigations specifically undertaken for the purpose to determine the metallurgical 
characteristics of the mineralization at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit have been conducted. 

A Report (Dufresne, 1997) indicated that the pit was excavated in January 1996 and a 500 ton bulk 
sample was excavated and trucked to Fort Frances from where it was shipped to Noranda Horne 
smelter. The 500 ton (short?) sample yielded 0.21 oz Au/t (or 6.5g/t Au/t) and this grade is said to 
reflect a 30% dilution factor. A report sheet was uncovered which detailed the results of the first five 
(5) shipments of ore received at the smelter which totaled 436 short tons at the same grade thus 
providing support for the statement from the above report. No other information could be found 
concerning this excavation or treatment.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 

14.1 Introduction 

The author used Surpac and Vulcan software applications for generating mineralization solids, a 
representation of an open pit and a topography surface, and for conducting statistical analysis, 
grade estimation, classification and validation of the mineral resource. 

In the opinion of the author, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable global 
representation of the mineral resource found in the Dogpaw Gold Deposit at the current level of 
sampling. The mineral resource has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 
"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and is reported 
in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101. The effective 
date of the mineral resource estimate is May 2013, thereby utilizing all drilling data up to and 
including this date.  

The following sections describe the resource estimation methodology and summarize the key 
assumptions and parameters used to prepare the mineral resource statement for the Dogpaw Gold 
Project.  

14.2 Data Set 

The datasets used to estimate the Dogpaw Gold Deposit mineral resource were provided to the 
author by Coventry initially in January 2013 with the final data provided in March 2013, these were:  

• "Dogpaw – grid154.mdb" a Microsoft (MS) Access database of drilling information. 

• "orepod.xlsx" – description of the mineralized strings by section. 

• "orepod100.str" – the mineralized strings. 

• "Dogpaw_Pit_Geospatial_Data.zip"  - information related to the excavation, this file 
contained: - 

• Dogpaw_Pit_Bathymetry_Contours.dxf – "depth" contours based on depth survey – these 
were 2D  

• Dogpaw_Pit_Perimeter.dxf – boundary of the excavation, again a 2D strings 

• Dogpaw_Pit_Bathymetry.jpg – image showing pit and contours 

• Surface Stripping and Channel Sampling data – several files  

• "Dogpaw_Lode1_154_transformation sheets-V2.1.xls" – a Grid transformation spread 
sheet 

• "Dogpaw Resample SG.zip" was provided which contained individual spread sheet with the 
specific gravity analysis of core from the holes in the re-sample program (see Section 11)  

14.2.1 Drillhole Data 

The MS Access database was reviewed and validated as described in Section 12.

The information contained within the database for the purpose of grade estimation (i.e. in the 
vicinity of the Deposit) is described in Section 10 and summarized in Table 14.2.1.

The database describes the location of sampled intervals and the gold grade of the samples. 
Additional information regarding the geological conditions (lithology and alteration) combined with 
the gold assay information was utilized as controls to the location of the main mineralized zones.  

The drillhole data utilized is considered fit for the purpose of estimating the mineral resource, given 
the quality (see Sections 11 and 12) and the quantity of data.  

The location data were collected relative to the NAD83, Zone 15 datum. The Dogpaw Gold Deposit 
is located within the following coordinate ranges:- 

• Easting: 438200m to 438700m. 

• Northing: 5464200m to 546440m. 

All of the drillhole sample interval data was acquired in metric measurements with gold assays 
recorded as g/t. 

14.2.2 Mineralization Interpretation 

The geology of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit is described in Section 7 of this report.  

In summary the mineralization within the Deposit occurs in silicified and carbonised veins and/or 
replacement zones which contain up to 10% pyrite. Gold content is locally very variable ranging up 
to +100g/t.  

The mineralisation appears to be fracture controlled and potentially related to movement along the 
Dalby Bay Shear upon which later movement may have produced fracturing in the basic intrusive 
host. These veins are mostly steeply north (local grid) dipping and are generally (by surface 
exposure) quite limited in east west (local grid) strike. The vein set which comprise the current 
interpretation have been traced for nearly 350m and has been drill tested in some parts to 200 m 
below surface. The mineralisation is open to the east (grid) and at depth.

Previous sampling strategies appear to have ensured that on most occasions all prospective 
lithologies are routinely sampled to at least two metres, sometimes up to 10 m past the margin of 
the favourable host(s).  

The mineralization boundaries for the Dogpaw Gold Deposit were interpreted by Coventry's 
resource geologist on cross sections spaced between 12.5 m and 25 m apart over the entire strike 
length of the mineralized zone. The sectional interpretation was constructed from a combination of 
lithological information and gold assay information, nominally utilizing a 0.5 g/t cut-off for 
mineralization. 

Using the above technique for the definition of the mineralization, a total of 10 individual zones 
(veins) were defined within the overall deposit area. 

The interpretation was generated in the Surpac software application, and this information provided 
to DataGeo in the file "orepod100.str". 

In addition a boundary representing the shearing within which the majority of the veins occur was 
interpreted by DataGeo based on the lithological description and the presence of anomalous 
mineralisation. 

14.2.3 Excavation and Stripping data 

A pit on the Dogpaw Deposit was observed during the 2012 site visit to the West Cedartree Project, 
the photograph in Figure 14.2.1 was taken at that time. 

Figure 14.2.1 Dogpaw Gold Deposit – mined pit. 

 
 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

The central part of the photo shows wall rocks to a height of 1m above the water level with the 
mined area under water to a depth of 6 to 7m. The excavation is on what was previously known as 
Zone 1. 

A Report (Dufresne, 1997) indicated that the pit was excavated in January 1996 and a 500 ton bulk 
sample was extracted and trucked to Fort Frances from where it was shipped to Noranda Horne 
smelter. The 500 ton (short?) sample yielded 0.21 oz Au/t (or 6.5g/t Au/t) and this grade is said to 
reflect a 30% dilution factor. A report sheet was discovered which detailed the results of the first 
five (5) shipments of ore received at the smelter which totaled 436 short tons at the same grade 
thus providing support for the statement from the above report. No other information could be found 
concerning this excavation or treatment. 

The stripping data provided represent the margins of the areas cleared to allow surface channel 
sampling (by cutting slots in the exposed bedrock) to be undertaken. 

Both the excavation and stripping data provided was on the UTM grid and without vertical 
reference. This information was converted to Dogpaw Local Grid (see below) after loading using 
the provided transformation. 

14.2.4 Grid Utilised 

The Dogpaw drillhole information and all subsequent information/estimates generated from this 
information is located on the Dogpaw Local Grid – this is defined in Section 12.1.  

14.3 Solid and Surface Modelling 

14.3.1 Mineralization 

The sectional interpretation provided was wireframed using standard functionality within the Vulcan 
modelling package. Ten (10) wireframe models, v001 to v009 and v011 were created representing 
the zones or veins. Only minor modification was made to the strings to aid continuity. The 
wireframes were terminated at ½ section distance past the last section in the interpretation for the 
zone. 

A solid representing the surrounding shear zone was generated using the same methodology. Two 
of the smaller veins (v005 and v009) fall outside this interpretation of the position of the shear. 
These veins could possibly be splays or individual veins from the same source as the larger veins 
within the shear – this however is completely subjective and needs further verification/justification. 
Whilst this may be a geological inconsistency it is unlikely to impact significantly on gross tonnage 
and grade but does impact confidence in the interpretation for these veins. 

The mineralisation is shown in Figures 14.3.1 and 14.3.2 together with the drillhole data set.

The final solids that represent the mineralization were constructed by the author. The author is of the 
opinion that the current exploration information is sufficiently reliable to confidently interpret the 
boundaries of the mineralization and that the assay data is sufficiently reliable to support the 
estimation of mineral resources. The amount of drillhole data available to define the interpretation 
and subsequent grade continuity in different parts of the deposit is reflected in the confidence 
classification for the estimate in the mineral resource model. 

14.3.2 Topography 

As no topographic information had been supplied the vertical position of the current surface was 
generated from the surveyed collars of the drillholes with some additional random points added to 
ensure coverage of the likely area to be modelled. The elevation of these random points was 
assigned from the neighbouring drillhole collars.  

The area over and surrounding the Deposit is generally fairly flat to gently sloping based on field 
inspection. As such the use of the surveyed collars to approximate the topography given the 
absence of a detailed surface does not, in DataGeo's opinion, adversely impact the volume of 
mineralisation. 

14.3.3 Excavation/Pit 

The information described in Section 14.1 relating to the excavation was manipulated as follows to 
generate a 3D representation of the pit: - 

• The perimeter file provided was registered against the surface topography file generated 
from the drillhole collars. 

• Perimeter string elevation varies between 358.2 and 358.8m and as such 358.5m was 
taken as the average elevation at the crest of the pit 

• The surface of the water was assigned an elevation 358m, i.e. from observation the water 
level appears to be 0.5m on average below the crest of the pit 

• The contours provided were assigned elevation with the water surface reference of 358m. 

A surface was generated from the 3d contours and the perimeter stings. 

Figures 14.3.3 and 14.3.4 show the pit and its relative position to the mineralization and 
topography.

14.3.4 Stripped Areas 

The provided boundaries of the stripped areas were compared to the position of the modelled veins 
projected to surface at the average vein dip, the result is shown in Figure 14.3.5. 

Figure 14.3.5 Plan View – Surface information versus vein projection. 

 
 
In Figure 14.3.5 the red polygons are the stripped area boundaries and the green, light blue and 
purple polygons are the surface projected positions of veins v007, v001 and v008 respectively. 

The veins, interpreted from the drillhole information, are in good agreement with the western and 
under pit stripped/mined areas (i.e. veins v008 and v007 in Figure 14.3.5). The position of Vein 
v001 appears to cross the Dalby Bay Shear and occurs slightly north of the minor extension 
clearing on the Dalby Bay Shear which runs approximately E-W. It is most likely that vein v001 has 
minimal surface expression and thus would not have been identified and stripped. 

Overall the vein interpretation appears supportable by the location of the stripping and the potential 
that some veins are sub-cropping.  

The presence of the largest stripped area to the south of the interpreted veins possibly indicates 
that there may be significant upside in this Deposit. 

14.4 Statistics 

14.4.1 Sample Length

The sample length of the samples included within the mineralisation interpretation of the veins was

The results in Figure 14.4.1 highlight that the majority of the samples are between 0.9 and 1.1m 
and on closer inspection of the raw data the samples in this range are mostly 1m in length.  

Given this result a 1m sample length would provide the most representative length for normalising 
the sample population. 

Shear Zone 

A similar exercise was conducted for the samples within the interpretation of the shear surrounding 
the veins; this is shown in Figure 14.4.2.

The distribution of sample lengths appears very similar to that in the veins. 

Again 1m downhole compositing would appear appropriate.

The samples where composited to 1m length downhole with missing (un-sampled) intervals set to

Shear Zone 

The samples were composited to 1m length downhole with missing and un-sampled intervals set to 
0.01g/t Au grade. 

The composites within the Shear Zone with a minimum of 0.8m in length are shown in Table 
14.4.4.

The observation within the "shear" is that the presence of some "higher" grade composites 
(maximum grade in 7.8g/t Au) does significantly distort the grade population as reflected by the 
coefficient of variation. 

14.4.3 Grade Normalisation 

A review of the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/average grade) shown in Tables 14.4 
and 14.5 highlights that some positive skewed populations exist (coefficient > 1).  If separate 
populations exits for the higher-grade then there treatment has to be in such a manner as to not 
allow such high-grades to have an undue influence on the overall grade. There are standard 
techniques applied to deal with this situation which can be at the input data stage and/or the grade 
estimation stage. The options available are:

• Top-cut extreme or outlier input values (values which do not fit the population distribution) 
to statistically reduce variance prior to grade estimation. 

• Restrict the influence of extreme or outlier values in the estimation process by excluding 
them from search ranges above a certain distance (this implies some interpretative 
knowledge of high grade distribution within the overall interpretation). 

• Sub-dividing the interpretation with hard boundaries to constrain separately the extreme 
and immediately associated values (this takes second bullet point above to a physical 
definition of high-grade within the mineralisation). 

• Apply a grade estimation technique which allows for grade assessment by orientation – this 
implies that there is sufficient data to generate continuity models by grade range.  

The most universally adopted approach, depending on the mineralisation style, is to top-cut with 
particular emphasis on reducing the measure of the distribution towards normality. Various 
scenarios are discussed in the next sections. 

Normal Probability Assessment 

Normal probability plots were used to graphically display grade population statistics. 

Veins 

Normal probability plots were generated for the three largest veins and the entire vein population 
and these are shown in Figures 14.4.3 to 14.4.6..

Top Cut Assessment 

Veins 

Grades at the inflection points observed in Section 14.4.3.1 and others based on percentile 
statistics were assessed with top-cuts to determine if the population can be normalised.  The 
various top-cuts applied and the resultant statistics are shown in Table 14.4.5.

The results in Table 14.6 highlight that the application of top-cuts which are indicated by the 
population analysis does not normalise all the grade populations. This is most applicable to the 
largest veins v006, v007 and v008. A potential conclusion from this analysis is that the higher 
grade does not form part of the overall population of the vein. 

With the smaller veins those which required a top-cut (numbers 1 and 11) did respond acceptably. 

Shear 

Top-cutting was trialled at 3g/t for the shear and the results are in Table 14.4.6.

The application of the top-cut at the value taken from the normal probability plot does little to 
normalise the grade population within the shear zone. 

Visual Assessment of High-grade 

The statistical analysis did not provide any support for top-cutting to normalise the grade population 
for all veins thus it was decided to review the position of the high-grades to see if there was 
evidence of clustering or positional control. The drillhole data is shown with "disks" of various sizes

Figure 14.4.8 Perspective View (to NNE local grid) of high-grade intercepts. 

 

In Figure 14.4.8 there is no conclusive evidence of an association of high-grade with level or 
position. The vein interpretation appears as individual steeply dipping veins which are 
discontinuous along strike and thus could represent individual structures. 

The vein interpretation was rotated approximately 20o about the NS axis to align a "plan" vein with 
the down dip direction of the mineralisation, this is shown in Figure 14.4.9 with all of the veins.

The veins are interpreted as generally dipping at approximately 70o to the local grid north with the 
exception of vein v009 which has a much shallower dip of 40o and to slightly west of grid north.   

In Figure 14.4.9 the lack of strike continuity of the veins is obvious as is the lack of mineralisation 
on the two best drilled sections (50000mE and 50025mE). This lack of continuity may be controlled 
by offsetting structures/features. Such an explanation could be supported by the position of 
mineralisation near surface to the north-west and the isolated intercepts to the east.  

In is noted that there are some un-sampled holes (shown as thick black lines) in the vicinity of the 
mineralisation which reduce the strike continuity. This is discussed in Section 25. 

14.4.4 Grade Continuity 

Veins 

Semi-Variograms were generated for the vein composites with the following parameters and data: - 

• 5m lag 

• 20m lag (100m search) 

• 10o offset to search in 10o increments in all directions 

• All veins composites (except vein 9) with length >= 0.2m  

The results were inconclusive with the following observations: - 

• Nugget approximately 75% of the total variance 

• Some evidence of continuity along strike range of 30m with a plunge of 80o to the north 

• Some evidence of continuity NE to SW with a plunge of 50o to NE 

Shear 

The results obtained for the shear zone, using the same parameters as for the veins, were as 
follows: - 

• Greatest Continuity was in the Strike Direction – nugget 45% of total variance; range 20m; 
Plunge(?) 20o to grid east 

• Down Dip Direction – nugget 45% of total variance; range 10 to 15m; Plunge 70o to grid 
north 

Preliminary experimental single spherical semi-variograms with models are shown in Figures 
14.4.10 and 14.4.11.

14.4.5 Interpretation Consistency 

The mineralised system has been initially defined (for the purposes of this mineral resource 
estimate) by the DP-97 series drilling with the more recent programs mostly infilling this original 
program. If the interpretation is supportable it would be expected that the more recent programs 
would support the original program's grade within the limits of expected variance. Table 14.4.7 
reports all composites regardless of length top-cut to 30g/t by drillhole series.

The results in Table 14.4.7 show that within acceptable limits the infill programs support the results 
obtained in previous programs. 

14.5 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology 

The mineral resource estimation techniques applied reflect the varied conditions within the 
individual mineralized zones within the deposit. Two common factors applied across the deposit 
were the use of a block model which accurately reflects the mineralization interpretation, and the 
use of a grade estimation technique which is supported by the statistical and geostatistical 
assessment of the input data. 

The mineral resource was estimated separately for each mineralized zone. In all cases, the block 
model was constructed with blocks sized appropriately relative to the input data, and the sizes of 
these blocks were appropriate for assessing open-cut mining potential. 

14.5.1 Block Model 

A block model was created to cover the mineral zones with the following dimensions. 

• Easting:  438200m to 438700m. 

• Northing:  5464200m to 546440m. 

• Elevation: 80m to 350m. 

Block Sizing 

The selection of an appropriate block size for grade estimation is based on drill grid spacing and 
kriging efficiency. This is adjusted, usually in the selection of a sub-blocking regime, to suit the 
width of the mineralisation. 



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

Drill Data Spacing 

The drilling spacing varies from 20m to 25m along strike in the most densely drilled areas to in 
excess of 30m particularly to the east (see Section 10.3). 

With depth the spacing is consistent to between 80 to 100m from surface with holes between 10 
and 20m apart, with some sections having holes much closer. Below this the spacing is quite 
variable.  

On section the spacing is variable but averages 15 to 20m.  

Block Kriging Efficiency 

The drillhole dataset composited to 1m downhole within the mineralisation was utilised and kriging 
efficiency of various block sizes assessed. 

Kriging efficiency is a measure of how effectively the kriging of the data input performs compared to 
the size of the block being informed and the distribution of the data informing it.  

The variables involved in this assessment are: - 

Block variance - the difference in value between the average value for variance of all samples in 
the block model and the variance of samples within an individual block. Generally the smaller the 
block the higher the variance.  

Block variance = average sample variance - block sample variance  

Kriging variance - is a measure of the distribution of the data around the block being estimated. It 
is only related to the location of the data around the block and the variogram model. Low kriging 
variance values can indicate good distribution of data around the block. High kriging variance 
values can occur when data is clustered, or poorly distributed around the block 

Kriging Efficiency - is the relationship between the two variances above normalised to the block 
variance and calculated by the following formulae: -  

Kriging efficiency = (block variance - kriging variance) / block variance  

The block sizes assessed reflect the strike extent being the dominant length and some physical 
parameters which are described in the next section.  

The kriging efficiency review is graphed in Figure 14.5.1.

Kriging Efficiency

Dogpaw Mineralisation - kriging 
efficiency by block size

 

In Figure 14.5.1 the efficiency curve starts to increase in slope from the 20m block size onwards. 
This position (and hence block size) can be considered statistically to be the smallest block size for 
use for grade estimation relative to the drill data input. 

The 20m block sizes were also reviewed by position relative to actual data (i.e. placement of the 
block) and it was found that there was very little change, by moving the block half a block 
dimension in any orthogonal direction, to the kriging efficiency.  

Mineralisation Dimensions 

The vein interpretation shows greatest continuity and thus length in the strike (approximate grid 
east-west) and down dip (elevation) directions with the narrow dimension being in the north-south 
direction. A review of the veins revealed a width range for between 2m and 10m. This will be a 
limiting factor of block size in this orientation.  

The shear interpretation varies in the north south direction between 10m and 40m. 

Block Size 

A parent block size of 10mE x 2mN x 10mRL was chosen based on the kriging efficiency and the 
fact that some veins are quite narrow in the grid N-S direction. 10m along strike was chosen given 
the changes in orientation of the veins. This is acknowledged as a compromise given all of the 
inputs under consideration.

Sub-blocking to ½ the distance in each direction was chosen to improve volume representation. 

Volume 

The volume within the block model, truncated to the surface defined by the topography, is shown in 
Table 14.5.1.

All Veins 171,523 169,925 -0.93% 

Shear 1,776,020 1,577,500 -11.18% 

 

The results in Table 14.5.1 show an acceptable comparison between the solids and their 
representation with the block model when an allowance for the truncation to the topography is 
made and the fact that the veins are contained within the shear. The smaller zones do not perform 
that well but it is considered immaterial in terms of the overall mineral resource. 

14.5.2 Grade Estimation 

The high local variability and short grade continuity range indicate that the majority of the grade 
variation is taking place at quite close spacing. This is evidenced from the continuity review in 
Section 14.4.4. Given this the options for grade estimation would appear to point to either ordinary 
kriging using a generalised variogram model or inverse distance with a high power (3 or more) to 
place more emphasis on composites close to the point being estimated.  

Veins 

The veins will be estimated individually by inverse distance technique to the power of 3 if they 
contain 10 or more composites of appropriate length. If there are < 10 composites the grade will be 
assigned as the average of the composite grades within the vein.

The estimation was undertaken using following parameters: - 

• Primary search range (in the orientation from Table 14.10) of 20m along strike, 15m down 
dip and 5m across the dip-strike plane, no plunge component was be applied. 

• Discretisation within the parent block of 5 x 2 x 5 

• Grade estimated to the parent block size 

• Minimum of 3 composites and a maximum of 20 composites were used, with top-cuts 
applied as identified to those veins in Table 14.10 

For v007 the influence of composites at the top-cut value was restricted to the primary search 
distance. 

No other grade influence restrictions 

Should not all blocks be estimated then secondary and tertiary search criteria will be applied each 
doubling the search distance in each direction. 

Shear 

The shear zone will be estimated using ordinary kriging based on the variograms described for the 
strike and down-dip in Section 14.4.4. Estimation was carried out in two along strike zones within 
the Shear based on a change in strike orientation at approximately 50150mE as shown in Table 
14.5.3.

14.6 Specific Gravity 

Specific Gravity measurements were taken from the holes within the re-sampled program 
described in Section 11.  The information was supplied in file " Dogpaw Resample SG.zip" and 
came from the 20 holes and totalled 353 intervals, the values obtained are shown in Table 14.6.1.

The method adopted to determine the specific gravity was weight in air and weight in water. 

The results in Table 14.12 when related to the position of the holes (see Figure 11.1) provide 
support for physical homogeneity of the mineralised zone with slightly more variation in the less 
mineralised material (surrounding shear). 

The Specific Gravity was modelled using inverse distance to the power of 2 based on all of the 
information using the following parameters: - 

• Search orientation set to overall deposit  

• Primary search 50m strike, 30m down dip and 15m across dip/strike plane 

• Secondary and tertiary search set to double previous distance 

• Minimum 3 and maximum 10 samples required to inform each block

In Figure 14.7.1 it is obvious that the block estimate is very smoothed compared to the input data. 
This suggests that the grade variation along strike is quite large and that block estimate is only 
representative at the deposit scale.

In Figure 14.7.2 the elevation at which the comparisons have been plotted (vertical axis) have been 
adjusted to separate the results, for v008 it is plotted at elevation plus 100m and for v006 it is 
elevation minus 100m. The results in Figure 14.7.2 are supportive of the block estimate on most 
occasions. The exception is for v008 where values of 6g/t in the composites are much reduced in 
the model (2.6g/t) however there are only 4 composites in this elevation range. 

14.8 Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources were classified according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) by Peter Ball MAusIMM (CP-Geo), Director of DataGeo, 
an appropriate independent qualified person for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101. 

Confidence in the mineral resource is an integral part of the reporting process and generally 
reflects knowledge or information concerning: 

• Geological influences 

• Data quality 

• Grade continuity and the estimation process. 

The geology is relatively well understood at a deposit scale and its influence on mineralisation is 
likewise understood in a global, deposit-wide, sense. The author viewed and reviewed the geology 
and its influence on mineralisation within the project area and has no issue with the interpretation 
method and its appropriateness for this particular deposit for an exploration mineral resource 
estimate. The reason for the dislocation/inflection along strike is not well understood but may be 
associated with the NS trending shearing (see Figure 14.5). In addition the surface stripping and 
sampling is supportive of the projected positions of the majority of the veins. 

Data quality reflects both the confidence in the position of the data and the reliability of the 
analytical information. These aspects will be documented in the final report but hinge on: - 

1. the re-sample program results (more that 20% of the vein mineralised samples had ¼ core 
re-submitted for preparation and assay) which provide acceptable average grade results.  

2. drillhole collar location confidence obtained by re-survey allows DataGeo to form the 
opinion that representative data both in position and grade have been presented for 
estimation purposes. 

During the estimation process, variables relating to the distance to composites, number of 
composites, and number of holes the composites come from were collected. In addition, a global 
estimation assessment was made which incorporated all drilling data by estimating grade into the 
block model without utilizing the mineralisation boundary constraints. This technique provides a 
representation of the data density/spacing which can be "tuned" visually to the other information. 

The economic and other factors relate to selective reporting of that part of the mineral resource 
which may prove viable for future extraction. 

The classification adopted for this deposit statistically relates to the distribution of drill data 
regardless of mineral content and the geological confidence. Given the high nugget effect (approx.

75% of total variance) it is not thought appropriate to report any material classified as Measured 
given the current drill spacing. 

The methodology adopted is as follows: - 

• All blocks with estimated grade given an Inferred classification 

• Block estimated in primary search with the kriging error up to 60% of the maximum for 
these blocks; a minimum for 10 composites used in the estimate and the average distance 
to the composites of not more than 20m (the along strike search condition) assigned 
Indicated Status 

• Block estimated in secondary search with the kriging error up to 50% of the maximum for 
these blocks, a minimum for 15 composites used in the estimate and the average distance 
to the composites of no greater than 20m (the along strike search condition) assigned 
Indicated Status 

Some blocks were re-assigned based on the location as follows: - 

• Indicated reset to Inferred if block positioned < 50020mE or > 50240mE and > 200mRL; 
these considered extrapolation past the last actual or interpreted data. 

• Indicated reset to Inferred if block between 50110mE and 50140mE where the inflection or 
dislocation occurs in the along strike position of Deposit, DataGeo considers that the 
reason for the inflection/dislocation is not well understood and thus reduced confidence in 
the estimate at this location. 

• All block with assigned grade, zones v005 and v011 were set to Inferred. 

A long section of the deposit with blocks colour coded by classification is shown in Figure 14.8.1.

14.9 In-Situ Classified Mineral Resource  

When determining the amount of the mineral resource estimate to report as compliant, 
considerations regarding the value of the commodity, how and how much of the commodity might 
be extracted, and the ability to operate and support the project at its particular location, must be 
considered. In the case of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit the following assumptions have been made: - 

As it occurs at and near-surface, the deposit is likely to be developed with open pit mining. 

• Processing is likely to be at the nearby Cameron Gold Project (when established) with ore 
trucked to this site. 

• It has been assumed that when mining the prevailing gold price will be at or around the 
current market value of approximately US$1700 /oz. 

• The head grade of ore delivered to the process plant is likely to be approximately 2 g/t. 

• Licensing and permits for mining and environmental considerations will be obtained. 

In determining the appropriate head grade, information concerning the processing characteristics of 
mineralised material has been considered. There is no metallurgical test work on the deposit itself 
however the deposit occurs in a similar geological environment to the nearby Cameron and 
Dubenski Deposits which have been the focus of studies indicating that a conventional CIL process 
would recover in excess of 90% of the gold.  



TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE DOGPAW GOLD DEPOSIT

Effective Date 13 May 2013 

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

Thus, the in-pit planned extraction grade can be determined by applying the likely "bulk" mining 
parameters of a 5% mining tonnage loss at the planned grade, with 5% tonnage dilution (at 0.1 g/t 
Au) to the achieve "run of mine" material. Therefore to achieve a 2 g/t head grade, the in situ grade 
would be considered to be a minimum of 2.2 g/t.  

For open pit mining the economic viability is at this stage unknown and thus only mineral resource 
remaining within 150m (above 210mRL) of the surface should be considered and this reported at a 
0.5g/t cut-offs in Table 14.9.1. 

Table 14.9.1 Reportable in-situ Mineral Resource ≥ 0.5 g/t Au to 150m below surface 
depleted for previous mining. 

Cut-off Classification Tonnes Gold g/t Gold Oz 

0.5 g/t Indicated 247,000 3.02 24,000 

  Inferred 64,000 2.27 4,600 

 

Within Table 14.9.1 given the assumptions concerning the viability of mining etc, in the author's 
opinion, it is appropriate to report the mineral resource at a 0.5 g/t Au cut-off to 150m below the 
current interpreted position of the surface. 

The mineral resource may also be affected by subsequent assessment of mining, environmental, 
processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic and other factors.  

There is insufficient information to assess what if any impact these factors would have, but in the 
author's opinion they would not have a material impact on the mineral resource as reported. 

14.9.1 Mineral Resource - Other Considerations 

Open Pit 

As described in Section 14.3.3 the existing pit was modelled as best as possible. A field named 
"mined" was added to the model and this field was coded with a 1 if the model blocks were above 
the pit surface; all other blocks were assigned a "0" for this field. 

The material identified in the mineral resource as being within the Pit is shown in Table 14.9.2 at 
various cut-offs.

Table 14.9.2 Material within the old pit according to the mineral resource model at 
various cut-offs. 

Cut-off Classification Tonnes Gold g/t Gold Oz 

0.0 g/t All 9,513 0.55 169 

0.5 g/t All 3,006 1.68 162 

1.0 g/t All 3,006 1.68 162 

 

In terms of reconciling to the reported information concerning the extraction and processing of 500 
tonnes at an average of 6.5 g/t (Section 14.2.3) recovered this is somewhat difficult to quantify. The 
previous mining equates to 104 oz recovered and if recovery was 90% means a total of 116oz 
were presented to the process. It is assumed that mining would have been selective thus in gross 
terms the mineral resource performs acceptably. 

As the pit is an approximation only based on the assumptions described in Section 14.3.3 it 
provides, in DataGeo's opinion, a relatively defensible position for the area considered as mined 
and thus support for the depleted mineral resource reporting in table 14.14.  

Underground Workings 

There is a shaft on the Deposit to the east of the Dalby Bay Shear and documentation provided 
indicates a 6.6m (20ft) depth but there is no other information available. This shaft possibly  
intersects either vein v002 or v003 however the volume of material contained within this shaft,  
assuming the dimension observed in the field are consistent for the 6.6m depth, is between 25 and 
30m3 and thus, based on current knowledge, in DataGeo's opinion these workings are immaterial 
to the reported resource   

Till 

Within this environment glacial till coverage of the in situ geology is common however DataGeo 
saw no evidence of significant till in the location of the Dogpaw Deposit and thus in DataGeo's 
opinion there is no impact on the reported resource.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

23.1 Introduction 

Two other properties of interest are located adjacent to the Wet Cedartree Gold Project within a 10 
km radius, namely the Cameron Gold Project and the East Cedartree Gold Project – see Figure 
23.1.1.  

Figure 23.1.1 Map of adjacent properties to the Cameron Gold Camp Project - Source – 
Coventry. 

 

23.2 Cameron Gold Project 

The Cameron Gold Project is located 10 km to the west of the West Cedartree Gold project and is 
also held by Coventry (Figure 23.1). The Cameron Gold Deposit was the subject of a NI 43-101 
compliant technical report dated 23 January, 2013 (amended on February 18 2013) of which the 
author was a co-contributor. Readers are referred to this document for full details of the technical 
report as filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).

The Cameron Gold Deposit is associated with, and partially hosted by, the Cameron Lake Shear 
Zone. The Cameron Lake Shear Zone forms part of a number of structures which occur as arcuate 
splays from the Cameron-Pipestone Fault, including the Monte Cristo Shear Zone. The Monte 
Cristo Shear Zone is also associated with a number of gold occurrences, principally the Victor and 
Monte Cristo prospects.  

At the Cameron Gold Deposit, the Cameron Lake Shear Zone is a brittle-ductile structure that 
cross-cuts the local stratigraphy trending northwest-southeast and dips to the northeast at an 
average angle of 65 – 70 degrees. 

The mineralization at the Cameron Gold Deposit is mainly hosted in mafic volcanic rocks within a 
northwest-trending shear zone (Cameron Lake Shear Zone or CLSZ) which dips fairly steeply to 
the northeast. In the southeastern part of the deposit where the greatest amount of gold has been 
delineated, the shear zone forms the contact between the mafic volcanic rocks and 
diabase/dolerite in the footwall.  

The mineralization occurs within quartz breccia veins, associated with intense silica-sericite-
carbonate-pyrite alteration in a series of zones that dip moderately to steeply to the northwest 
within and adjacent to the shear zone. Gold is associated with disseminated pyrite with high 
sulphide concentration generally corresponding with higher grade. Visible gold is very rare. The 
mineralization is open at depth and along strike to the northwest, so potential exists to expand the 
mineral resource at this deposit. 

Modern exploration at the Cameron Gold Project commenced in the 1960s and numerous 
companies have carried out prospecting, line cutting, geological mapping, trenching, soil and 
outcrop sampling and ground magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) geophysical surveys. The first 
drilling was undertaken in July 1960 at what is now the Cameron Gold Deposit. Prior to Coventry 
purchasing the project in 2010, 836 holes comprising in excess of 90 kilometres of diamond 
drillcore were drilled by six companies.  

In 1987, underground development for an extensive sampling program was undertaken. Some 
65,000 m3 of material was excavated and bulk sampling, diamond drilling and rock chip sampling 
was completed. 

The current in-situ mineral resource has not been adjusted for the previous underground 
excavation and is reported at a 1.0 g/t cut-off which reflects a grade likely to provide, in global 
terms, mineral resource suitable for open cut mining. This is shown in Table 23.1.1 below as at 30 
March 2012 at a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t gold.

*Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to 

reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. 

No constraining pit model for estimating the open pit mineral resources was used given the 
resource model is a global one and that the cut-off used (1.0 g/t Au) for defining the mineralisation 
is one that could be reasonably expected as being that grade for open pit extraction. It is also 
viewed that a global model was best suited as any pit constraint and the subsequent parameters 
which define such a pit would ignore the underground potential of the mineralisation. 

23.3 East Cedartree Project 

The East Cedartree Gold Project abuts the West Cedartree Gold Project to the south and 
southeast, and is located about 7 km to the west of the Cameron Gold Deposit and (Figure 23.1). 
The ECGP is held by Metalore Resources Limited (TSX: MET). 

The geology of the East Cedartree Gold Project is dominated by a series of folded gabbroic sills 
intruding mostly mafic volcanic rocks. This sequence is intruded by heterogeneous felsic intrusive 
body, the Stephen Lake Stock. At least three areas of gold mineralisation that have been the 
subject of significant exploration have been identified within the WCGP (Figure 23.1.1), with the 
Main Zone being the most advanced. 

23.3.1 Main Zone Gold Deposit 

Gold mineralization occurring at the Main Zone comprises a disseminated style associated with 
pyrite as well as a series of high-grade silica-pyrite lodes. On 12 March 2012, MET announced a NI 
43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate for the Main Zone (Larouche, 2012) as contained in 
Table 23.2.1.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The mineralization occurring at the Dogpaw Gold Deposit comprises pyrite-silica, largely as 
replacements and breccia within both gabbro and mafic volcanic host rocks. The mineralization 
varies in thickness considerably, particularly over narrow intervals, ranging from 30 cm to more 
than five metres, with an average width of two to three metres. Significant pyrite is especially 
associated with high-grade zones, with ounce plus results commonly associated with pyrite in the 
range of 10%. Minor chalcopyrite is also recorded as associated with pyrite and visible gold is 
common, especially in mineralized material of very high grade. 

The Dogpaw Gold Deposit is a greenstone-hosted gold deposit and whilst it can generally be 
considered to be a part of the orogenic family of gold deposits, they bear many atypical 
characteristics that are commonly identified in the largest gold deposits of this style.  

The estimation of the mineral resource utilized techniques that estimated grades within constrained 
mineralization boundaries and then within a surrounding shear zone. The estimation sufficiently 
reflects the observed grade continuity and also appropriately deals with 'outlier' higher-grades 
(those which do not fit the population statistics) in a manner which reflects the current level of 
knowledge on the spatial position of the higher grades. As such it should be a fair and reasonable 
global estimator. 

With all mineral resource estimations there is risk associated with the utilization of interpretations 
reliant mostly on 'spot' data. This risk is quantified by the classification of the resources based on 
the confidence in the consistency of the underlying data and demonstrated (or not) robustness of 
the interpretation. In the case of the Dogpaw Gold Deposit there is sufficient confidence to allow 
the author to apply the intermediate level of confidence in and around the areas of highest drilling 
density and geological confidence.  

The risks associated with the mineral resource estimate determined for the deposit can be 
considered to include: 

Interpretation – low to medium risk. Geological and mineralization controls have been 
demonstrated from the existing drill data which includes some close-spaced information and 
surface outcrop data. 

Tonnage – low risk, given the use of constraints which conform to the interpretation. 

Grade – low risk in global terms. Any uncertainty related to the high-grade spatial distribution has 
been handled by grade restriction influences, which in the author's opinion, are appropriate and are 
unlikely to produce an overestimate (in global terms) of the average grade.  

Confidence – low to moderate risk. Whilst the resource estimate relies solely on existing drill data 
for which historic QAQC practices, for the most part, have not been documented,  the supportive 
nature of re-sample results, provides sufficiently acceptable levels of confidence in the resource 
estimate, particularly within 150m of surface.    

Reporting – low risk. The cut-off applied suitably reflects the mineralization controls.

As stated, the mineral resource estimate is a global estimate and thus will not be locally reliable. 
Also the methodology adopted will not support higher reporting cut-offs. 

There are no economic criteria built into the resource estimation. The reporting cut-off adopted 
(0.5g/t) was selected simply to reflect current metal prices and the likely metallurgical/processing 
parameters. In the future, studies will be required to evaluate many of the as-yet unaddressed 
economic factors described in Section 14.10. These may impact on the determination of the 
appropriate reporting cut-off, in either a positive or negative manor.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Un-sampled Drillholes 

There are eight (8) drillholes in the dataset which have no assays at all, these are: - 

• DP-97-11, 13, 14, 19, 29, 30 and 35, and DP-08-78. 

Four of these holes are adjacent to or within the mineralisation interpretation with two of these 
holes (DP-97-13 and DP-08-78) intersecting veins 008 and 009 – see Figure 26.1.1. The drilling 
records for the eight holes above should be inspected. For the two holes identified as being within 
the mineralisation interpretation their core (if available) should be sampled at a minimum through 
the position of the mineralisation interpretation.  

Figure 26.1.1 Perspective View (looking WNW from above) Un-sampled Holes in relation 
to mineralisation interpretation. 

 

26.2 Stripping and Confirmation of Veins 

It is possible that Vein v007 may well be sub-cropping in an area not previously stripped. Additional 
stripping is recommended in the projected position of the vein to confirm the vertical continuity of 
the vein. 

26.3 Resource Upside 

The current modelled mineralisation is open along strike to the east and at depth.  

The stripping in the immediate vicinity of the modelled area which has been already conducted 
should be reviewed particularly that to the south to determine if it would support a drilling 
campaign. In the southern area only two holes DP-97-22 (2.3m @ 6.6g/t from 12.1m downhole)

DATAGEO Geological Consultants 

and DP-97-27 (no significant intercepts but the hole orientation is potentially parallel to any vein) 
have not sufficiently tested this area and may offer a source of near surface mineralization. 

26.4 Geological Controls 

The influence of the Dalby Shear Zone should be assessed. If this is a disrupting feature then it 
needs to be quantified. The above mentioned hole DP-97-27 should have passed through the 
Shear (perhaps this is the reason for its orientation?) and thus the core should be reviewed. 

26.5 General 

Now that Coventry has completed the West Cedartree Project acquisition the following 
observations/recommendations are made:  

• Coventry should adopt the same field and management procedures as it does for the 
nearby Cameron Gold Project for all data captured post this date 

• Database management, if retained in-house, should be subject to regular audit by an 
external consultant/contractor. This is recommended, to ensure supportable integrity of the 
data at all times. 

• The data within the database should be expanded to include all relevant information 
contained on the drill logs and the assay information should be loaded from digital originals 
(if possible). Source metadata should be recorded.  

• The higher grades have been treated in a way which reflects the limited knowledge of their 
distribution, with their influence being quite restricted and their value top-cut. This  (if 
possible) needs to be addressed by acquiring more information from the zones of the high-
grade mineralisation.  

• Geological and structural domaining may potentially aid both mineral resource modelling 
and mine planning. Given the acknowledged presence of a shears, in more than one 
orientation, and numerous intrusive bodies, these should be modelled.
