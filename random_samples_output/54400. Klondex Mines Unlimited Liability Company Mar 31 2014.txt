Klondex Mines Ltd. 1-1 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

1 Summary 
On February 11, 2014, Klondex Mines Ltd. ("Klondex" or the "Company") completed the 

acquisition of all of the shares of Newmont Midas Holdings Limited, which indirectly owns the 

Midas mine and mill located in Elko County, Nevada (formerly known as the Ken Snyder Mine 

and Mill) (collectively, "Midas" or the "Midas Property" or the "Project"), from Newmont USA 

Limited, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation ("Newmont") for $83 million, including 

approximately $55 million in cash and approximately $28 million for the replacement of 

Newmont's reclamation surety arrangement, in addition to five million common share purchase 

warrants (the "Midas Acquisition").  

The Midas Property includes the underground mine (the "Midas Mine"), the Merrill Crow 

processing facility, related support infrastructure and mining and milling equipment. The land 

package includes fee lands, patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims.  The Midas 

acquisition includes assignment of Newmont's interest in seven lease agreements for patented 

and unpatented mining claims. The total land package comprises approximately 30,000 acres.  

Klondex has engaged Practical Mining LLC ("PM" or "Practical Mining") to prepare this 

Technical Report on the status of the property and related infrastructure.. 

This document was produced by PM based on site visits by the qualified persons ("QPs"), 

evaluation of extensive information provided by Newmont and by interviewing Newmont's site 

management and technical staff. This document relies heavily on the information supplied by 

Newmont, and it is the opinion of the QPs that this information is accurate. 

1.1 Geology 

The Midas Mine exploits the largest known Au-Ag epithermal deposit along the middle Miocene 

Northern Nevada Rift ("NNR"). Located in the historic mining district of Midas, previously 

known as the Gold Circle district, the Midas Property is located in Elko County in north-central 

Nevada one mile east of the town of Midas, Nevada, about 62 miles from Winnemucca on 

Nevada State Highway 789 from Interstate Highway I-80 or 80 miles driving west then north 

from the town of Battle Mountain. 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 1-2 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

The Midas Mine site is located about 40 miles due north of Battle Mountain. The Midas Property 

is centered on latitude 41° 15' North (N) and longitude 116° 46' West (W). Most of the current 

project activity is located in the southeast corner of Township 39 N Range 46 East (E) Mount 

Diablo Meridian.  

The Midas deposit consists of a complex of steeply dipping, quartz-adularia-calcite-precious 

metal bonanza veins hosted by volcanic rocks and locally contains mineral grades greater than 

(>) 100 ounces per ton (opt) of gold. Gold occurs as electrum and is intimately associated with 

selenide and sulfide minerals. It belongs to a suite of middle Miocene low-sulfidation epithermal 

gold and silver mineralizing systems associated with magmatism and faulting along the NNR 

(Leavitt et al., 2004). The mineralization model at Midas is a shallow, low-sulfidation, vertically-

zoned, epithermal gold-silver system. Rocks in the Midas district consist of middle Miocene ash 

flow tuffs, air-fall tuffs, felsic plugs, volcaniclastic sediments and gabbroic sills and dikes 

located within the NNR. 

1.2 History 

Gold was discovered in the Midas Mining District in the summer of 1907, and by March 1908 

the camp population grew to over 1,500 people. A number of companies operated the mines of 

the district and six or more mills operated at different times during the life of the camp.  (Rott, 

1931) 

Modern exploration of the district began in the late 1980s under the direction of Ken Snyder and 

Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation ("Franco-Nevada Mining"). Construction of the present day 

Midas Mine and Midas Mill began in 1997, with first gold poured in December 1998.  Newmont 

acquired Midas through its acquisition of Normandy Mining Corporation ("Normandy") in 

February 2002. A history of Midas ownership is listed below:

2002-2014 Newmont Newmont acquired Midas through its Normandy acquisition, 
operated property until sale of Midas to Klondex. 

Feb. 2014-present Klondex Klondex purchased Midas from Newmont. 

1.3 Mineral Resources 

Gold and silver mineralization at Midas is hosted in several north-west striking veins. The veins 

are divided into two groups based on dip direction. The main veins dip easterly, and the east 

veins dip to the west. The main veins have produced over 2,000,000 ounces of gold during the 

period 1998 to 2013. Development and initial production from the east veins began in 2013. 

Mineral resources have been estimated for those veins identified by Klondex as having potential 

to support mining activities in the first three years of the project. These include main veins 205 

and 305, and eastern veins 805, 905 and 9052. A summary of the Midas Mine mineral resources 

is listed in Table 1-2.

Notes: 

1. Mineral resources have been calculated at a gold price of $1,250/troy ounce and a silver price of $20.00 
per troy ounce; 

2. Mineral Resources are calculated at a grade thickness cut-off grade of 0.70 Au equivalent opt-feet and a 
diluted Au equivalent cut-off grade of 0.159 opt ; 

3. Sixty-six ounces of silver is equivalent to one ounce of gold; 
4. Mining width is defined as four feet or the vein horizontal width plus one foot, whichever is greater. 
5. Mineral resources include dilution to achieve mining widths and an additional 10% unplanned dilution. 
6. Mineral Resources include allowance for 5% mining losses; 
7. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 

estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-
political, marketing, or other relevant issues; and 

8. The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature 
and there is insufficient exploration to define these inferred mineral resources as an indicated or measured

mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or 
measured mineral resource category. 

 

1.4 Conclusions 

• The Midas Mine is a modern, mechanized narrow vein mine. 

• There is significant undeveloped mineralization and resources remaining in the main 

veins peripheral to past production.  

• Sufficient capital has not been allocated to near mine exploration to replenish reserves 

and resources depleted through mining. There are several exploration targets in the 

immediate area and within the mine's land position. As a result, underground mining 

rates will be less than the mill capacity of 1,200 tons per day (tpd). 

• The conventional Merrill Crow mill facility is an efficient well maintained modern 

mineral processing plant capable of processing 1,200 tpd. The plant is capable of 

operating with a minimum crew compliment resulting in cost reductions when operated at 

capacity. Excess milling capacity will allow the mill to process material from Klondex's 

nearby properties and also from third party toll milling sources. 

• The Midas Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") is nearing design capacity and has 

approximately 930,000 tons of capacity remaining. A significant percentage of the 

remaining capacity is displaced by the excess water volume generated from mine 

dewatering and stored in the TSF. The water management plan should be modified to 

include treatment of mine dewatering to facilitate its use as process make up water and 

reduce the burden on the evaporation system in place on the TSF. This will allow more 

rapid drawdown of the water levels and free up the impoundment volume for tailings 

placement. 

1.5 Recommendations 

The authors recommend that Klondex should pursue the following initiatives. 

1. Resume the near mine exploration program abandoned by Newmont in 2012. 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 1-6 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

2. Continue to test the four district exploration targets identified for additional work in 2011 

and 2012. 

3. Consider whether a second TSF must be designed, permitted and constructed to expand 

the capacity beyond the current 930,000 tons of remaining capacity.  This must be 

completed within the next two to three years in order that operations may continue 

without interruption. 

4. Perform a comprehensive engineering study, evaluating mineralization peripheral to 

abandoned mining areas that may allow an increase in mine production ahead of 

exploration results from recommendation 1.

4 Property Description and Location 
4.1 Property Description 

The property comprising the Midas Project is a high-grade volcanic rock-hosted gold-silver 

deposit in faulted and brecciated basalt related to a Tertiary rift. The deposit is located in Elko 

County about 60 miles from Winnemucca, Nevada in a sage and grass covered hillside of the 

Snowstorm Mountains overlooking Squaw Valley to the south. The mine is one mile from the 

town of Midas and 38 miles from the town of Tuscarora, both of which are small historic mining 

towns with a small number of year round residents. The Midas Mine Property extends a little 

over 30,000 acres. 

The portal to the underground mine is located approximately one half mile west of the mill and 

other site facilities. The portal provides entry to a system of declines and ramps that access the 

gold and silver-bearing veins. Mining levels are developed at vertical intervals of 50 feet to 

access the mineralized vein. The mineralized material is excavated and loaded into underground 

haul trucks, which transport it to a surface transfer stockpile located outside the mine portal. The 

mineralized material is then trucked from the transfer stockpile to the main ore stockpile area 

adjacent to the mill. In the mill, the mineralized material is crushed, processed, and refined to 

extract gold and silver. Molten gold/silver is poured from the refinery furnace into molds, and 

the resulting doré is shipped off-site for refining. 

4.2 Property Location 

The Midas Mine is located in Elko County in north-central Nevada one mile from the town of 

Midas, Nevada, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Winnemucca on Nevada State highway 

789 from Interstate Highway I-80, or 80 miles (128 kilometers) from Battle Mountain driving 

west then north, (Figure 4-1). The closest towns with services are either Winnemucca or Battle 

Mountain on I-80. Access from the closest commercial air service is in Elko. Elko is 

approximately three hours driving time if going through Battle Mountain for 150 miles. There is 

a remote, back roads access to Midas from Elko through Tuscarora via a road which does not 

have winter maintenance. The remote access from Elko to Midas is 90 miles, but the drive time 

would also be about 3 hours due to the unimproved roads.

4.3 Status of Mineral Titles 

Newmont's total land package in the Midas district (including easements, etc.) covers 30,000 

acres (Figure 4-2). This includes fee lands, federal unpatented mining claims, seven mining 

leases, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) right of ways, general agreements, easements and 

surface use agreements. Within the 30,000 acres, there are 1,489 federal unpatented mining 

claims. (Klondex Mines Ltd., 2013) Fee lands comprise approximately 2,417 acres of the land 

package. About 1,311 acres of the fee land include surface and mineral rights, while the other 

1,106 acres include only surface rights. Some of the surface-only fee lands are lots within the 

town of Midas.  Figure 4-2 is an overview of the Midas land package.

The claim locations are based on location of monuments and their dimensions cited to the BLM 

thereof. The authors are not aware of any conflicting surface rights within the Midas land 

package. Other considerations that might affect accessing claim status include grazing rights and 

protected habitats. Grazing rights may exist in the area; however, conflicts with local ranchers 

are not common in this region. Newly established protected habitat for sage grouse has not been 

defined in this area at the time of this Technical Report. There are archaeological considerations 

in the immediate area of Midas; however, all new surface disturbance proposed is reviewed and 

permitted by the BLM prior to construction. Land information regarding claim status and fee 

lands was provided by Newmont, and to the authors' knowledge at the time this document was 

authored, there were no environmental or social factors that would affect land title.

4.5 Location of Mineralization 

The Midas Mine and facilities are located near the southern limits of the land package, primarily 

within sections 22 and 27 of T39N R 46E.   

Klondex has an approved plan of operations with the BLM covering their current mining, 

processing and exploration activities at the site. The permits required to operate the mine and 

mill are listed in section 19.2. The authors are not aware of any environmental liabilities beyond 

normal reclamation and site closure that exist at the Midas Mine.  The existing TSF is nearing 

capacity, and further expansion is limited and carries a relatively high cost compared to 

constructing a new TSF. This will require an amendment to the existing plan of operations and 

may take two or more years to secure.  There are no other regulatory issues known to the authors 

related to the continued operation of the Midas Project.  

The Midas gold mineralization transpires in steeply dipping epithermal veins within Tertiary 

basalt flows and intrusive rocks. The mineralized basalt rocks at Midas are a unique suite of 

mafic-intrusive rocks characteristic of a regional northwest-trending structural zone. The NNR 

system, which is useful in understanding the timing and structural control of the mineralization, 

has been documented in multiple geophysical studies (Ponce, 2008) and (Watt, Glen, John, & 

Ponce, 2007), and is distinguished as a narrow, linear magnetic anomaly 30 miles (50 km) wide 

that extends 190 miles (300 km) south to south east from the Oregon-Nevada border to central 

Nevada. The rift emanates from the McDermitt Caldera in northwest Nevada and is likely related 

to the migrating Yellowstone hot-spot (Zoback, McKee, Blakely, & Thompson, 1994)

5 Accessibility, Climate, Vegetation, 
Physiography, Local Resources, and 
Infrastructure 

5.1 Access to Midas Project 

The Midas Mine can be reached from the town of Winnemucca by driving east on Interstate 

Highway I-80 for fifteen miles to the Golconda Exit Number 194. From Exit 194, turn left onto 

Nevada State Highway 790 ("NV 790") for 0.3 miles, then take the first right onto Nevada State 

Highway 789 ("NV 789") and drive northeast for 43 miles towards the town of Midas. NV 789 

turns into NV 18 / Midas Road at about mile thirty. One quarter mile past the turn-off to the town 

of Midas, continue to follow the Midas Road to a mine direction sign. The entrance to the mine 

site is about two and one half miles past the town of Midas. To reach Midas Mine from Battle 

Mountain, drive west on I-80 for 36.5 miles to reach the Golconda Exit, and then proceed as 

described above. (Figure 5-1) 

The roads leading to the mine are mostly unpaved but maintained by state, county and Midas 

Operation's crews in order to service the ranches and mines in the vicinity. In this part of 

Nevada, it is common for mine staff to commute long distances for work on a daily basis. The 

average commute for Midas staff is one and a half to two hours each way.

5.2 Climate 

The climate at Midas is typical for northern Nevada with hot summers and cold winters. Average 

daily summer temperatures range from 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) to 95°F, and average winter 

temperatures range from 15°F to 40°F. Summer temperature extremes may reach above 100° F 

for short periods, and winter extreme temperatures may drop to below 0° F for short periods. 

Fieldwork, including exploration drilling, is commonly conducted throughout the year in this 

area. Mines in Squaw Valley typically operate all year without experiencing any major weather-

related problems. 

5.3 Vegetation 

Midas vegetation is mainly limited to sagebrush, other species of low vegetation, and some 

grasses. There are no trees at the project. Due to the low amount of rainfall, the vegetation is low 

and sparse. 

5.4 Physiography 

The Midas Mine is in the foothills on the southeast slope of the Snowstorm Mountains on the 

north side of Squaw Valley. The elevation of surface infrastructure lies mostly between 5,400 to 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 5-3 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

5,800 feet. The United States Geological Survey ("USGS") published a base-relief map, which 

covers the project area titled, "Tuscarora 100K Quad' USGS quadrangle". The topographic relief 

is moderate with mature topography consisting mostly of rounded hills with steeper grades along 

more competent strata. 

5.5 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Midas Mine is a well-established facility with extensive underground mine workings and a 

proven process facility with nameplate capacity of 1,200 tpd. Prior to the Midas Acquisition, 

power was supplied from Newmont's Dunphy power plant via NV Energy Corp. ("NV Energy") 

transmission lines and the Osgood substation.  Klondex purchases electrical power from NV 

Energy which is transmitted through the same infrastructure to the mine. 

The towns of Winnemucca and Battle Mountain, about 54 miles southwest and 43 miles south of 

the Project, respectively, are the nearest larger towns and are home to a workforce of mining 

professionals and laborers as well as mine industrial suppliers. These towns are the only 

locations with amenities and services such as motels, fuel, grocery stores and restaurants. 

Newmont supplied its Midas operations through its centralized warehousing rather than 

maintaining an on-site warehouse. Klondex will need to assess the inventory items and stocking 

levels necessary to support the operation and establish a supply chain, which could be 

accomplished relatively easily due to the availability of well-established local suppliers already 

established in the region. 

Maintenance of the main access roads is reliable because the roads are also used by ranchers and 

other mining companies. State road NV 789 serves as access to Newmont's Twin Creeks mine, 

Atna Resources Ltd.'s Pinson Gold Project Mine, and Barrick Gold Corporation's Turquoise 

Ridge Mine along the Getchell Gold Belt. In addition, Waterton Global Mining Company's 

Hollister Mine access road is roughly 8 miles beyond the Midas mine turn-off on NV 18. 

The most accessible rail siding is located near the town of Golconda, a small community of 

about 200 people, the point of departure from the interstate on the best maintained route to 

Midas. Golconda has no services, with the exception of an intermittently operating convenience 

store.

6 History 
6.1 Exploration History 

The Midas Mining District, also known as the Gold Circle district in its earlier years, has a 

historic gold production dating as early as 1907 (Rott, 1931). Modern exploration methods were 

employed in the district casually in the 1970s and 1980s by various companies, and exploration 

began in earnest in the early 80s when Franco-Nevada Mining assembled a land package at the 

urging of Ken Snyder. 

The official discovery of the Ken Snyder Mine occurred in 1994 (renamed the Midas Mine in 

2001). Mine development commenced in 1997, and Franco-Nevada operated and maintained 

ownership until the mine was acquired by Normandy in 2001, followed by the Newmont 

acquisition of Normandy in 2002. Newmont had operated the Midas mine continuously since the 

Normandy acquisition until Newmont sold the mine to Klondex in February 2014.  Klondex is 

currently the operator of the Midas Mine. 

The Midas land package is quite large, extending well beyond the known mineralized extents, 

and exploration has been more or less ongoing, with pauses to focus on mine delineation. In 

2012, Newmont ceased all exploration activity at Midas and began to plan for final depletion and 

closure. 

Exploration techniques employed over the years include soil and rock chip sampling, surface 

mapping, geophysics, and drilling. Thirty eight holes were drilled by Newmont in the 2011 to 

2012 field season to test fourteen targets with follow-up work recommended in four of the areas 

tested.  The follow up work was never completed. 

6.2 Production History 

Midas is a historic mining district, with recorded production beginning in the early 1900s. Most 

accounts attribute about 300,000 oz. of gold and 3 million oz. of silver production to a period 

beginning in 1907 and continuing until 1942 when non-essential mining activity was suspended 

by the War Production Board.  Early production was from high grade veins mined extensively 

underground and locally at surface, sporadically augmented by discoveries of placer deposits.

Since modern mining began in 1998, 2.2 million ounces of gold and 26.9 million ounces of silver 

have been produced by Franco-Nevada Mining, Normandy and Newmont. 

Recent production from the Midas mill is presented in Table 6-1.  Production rates peaked in 

2011 and declined in both succeeding years. Gold grades have also declined indicating the 

approaching depletion of the Main Veins.  Silver grades increased in 2013 also indicating the 

shift in production from the Main Veins to the East Veins.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
7.1 Regional Geology 

The Midas mine is located in the south flank of the Snowstorm Mountain range near the eastern 

margin of the NNR structural domain, hosted in bimodal volcanic rocks. The NNR domain 

contains structures that are associated with regional wide epithermal-type gold veins, such as 

those that occur at Klondex's Fire Creek Exploration Project, Newmont's Mule Canyon Mine 

("Mule Canyon"), and Waterton Global Mining Company, LLC's Hollister Mine, (under the 

name of Rodeo Creek), all of which occur within the NNR structural domain and share similar 

mineralization characteristics (Figure 7-1).

The NNR structural domain is distinguishable on regional scale magnetic maps as a prominent 

north-north west (NNW) trending band of magnetic highs. This distinctive magnetic signature is 

caused by detection of a series of Miocene-age syn-rift volcanic and hypabyssal rocks of dacite 

to basalt in composition. 

The rift is thought to originate at the McDermitt Caldera in northwest Nevada and is related to 

the initial eruption of the Yellowstone hot-spot (Zoback, McKee, Blakely, & Thompson, 1994). 

The NNR is bounded on the west by north-west trending regional lateral faults. Along strike of 

these regional faults are a series of smaller, localized intersecting sub-parallel, northeast-

trending, high-angle normal faults that that form grabens. 

The overall orientation of down-dropped basement blocks within the NNR domain infers a rift-

setting with tensional, pull-apart deformation along predominantly north-northwest fault 

orientations. Basement blocks are down-dropped to the south in the northern portion of the 

domain and down-dropped to the north in the southern portion of the domain. The Midas deposit 

is located near the northern extent of the NNR. At Midas, normal faults occur in both northwest 

and northeast orientations. 

Extension during rifting was in an east-northeast to west-southwest direction. Based on the 

orientations of rift-related dikes and faults in the younger volcanic sequence, extension persisted 

until sometime after 10 million years (Ma) but before 6 Ma. At that point, a change in plate 

motions rotated the extension direction to a northwest-southeast orientation. Along the NNR, this 

change disrupted the rift and formed a series of fault-bounded, east-northeast-oriented grabens. 

These grabens are spectacularly exposed along the Midas trough, at the north end of the 

Shoshone Range (Wallace & John, 1998).

Figure 7-2 Midas Trough in the NNR. 

 
(Modified from Wallace et al., 1998) 

The chemical composition of the volcanic and intrusive rocks varies greatly within the rift zone 

throughout its length. Subsequently, rocks from one mining district often cannot be correlated 

with those from another. Mineralization is contemporaneous with mid-Miocene volcanism. 

Volcanism continued into the late Miocene era frequently capping the mineralization with a thick 

and barren sequence of volcanic rocks.

Gold mineralization at Midas is structurally controlled by normal faults within the NNR. The 

style of structurally controlled mineralization observed at the Midas Mine is typical of rift-hosted 

gold deposits, with epithermal bonanza-style mineralization associated with an intrusive center. 

The significance of regional intrusive centers to mineralization in the NNR is not well 

understood. The nearest intrusive stocks to Midas are Carlin-Trend in age of 30 to 40 Ma, which 

is older than Midas mineralization. Regional mineralization typical of the NNR, which is 

epithermal bonanza-style vertical veining, sometimes occurs where there are intrusive centers, 

but not all of the intrusive centers in the NNR are sources of mineralization. Mafic rocks within 

the NNR may or may not be related to the hydrothermal mineralization. Most of the intrusions 

associated with mineralization at Mule Canyon, where dike contacts are key indicators for 

locating mineralization, are mafic in composition, but not all the mafic intrusive rocks in the 

NNR are mineralized. The majority of the mafic volcanic rocks in the NNR occur between the 

Sheep Creek Range north of Highway I-80 to south of the Shoshone Range at Fire Creek. Mafic 

volcanic rocks are a minor component at Hollister and Fire Creek. The southeastern-most basalt 

flows occur at Buckhorn. Mafic intrusive rocks within the NNR also occur as sheeted dikes as 

far south as the Roberts Mountains. 

The vein and alteration mineralogy observed at Midas, Fire Creek, and Mule Canyon are related 

to the mafic host rocks. Intrusive mafic rocks associated with gold mineralization have been 

intersected by drilling at Midas. Eruptive centers on the western margin of the NNR produced a 

widespread sequence of mostly mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks observed at Midas. NNW 

striking normal faults are the main controlling structures for mineralization at Midas, which are 

observed on a regional scale in the northern part of the NNR. 

7.2 Midas Mine Local Geology 

The Midas deposit is the largest known high-grade Au-Ag vein deposit within the NNR. The 

Midas deposit belongs to a suite of middle Miocene low-sulfidation epithermal gold and silver 

mineralizing systems associated with magmatism and faulting along the rift. Interpretation of 

new 40 Argon (Ar) isotope and 39 Ar isotope dates for volcanic rocks and hydrothermal 

minerals related to gold mineralization and additional isotopic dates throughout the Midas region 

constrain the timing of volcanic, tectonic, and hydrothermal activity. The Midas hydrothermal 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 7-6 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada

system developed following a change from mafic-dominated bimodal volcanism and basin 

formation to felsic volcanism, folding, and faulting at about 15.6 Ma. (Leavitt, Spell, Glodstrand, 

& Arehart, 2004). 

From 15.6 to 15.2 Ma, sediments and tuffs were deposited on a relatively impermeable rhyolite 

flow at Midas. During this period, faulting and tilting of the volcanic edifice created pathways 

for hydrothermal fluids that flowed to the surface forming sinters and hydrothermal breccias. 

Approximately 200 thousand years after the change in volcano-tectonic regime, oblique-slip 

faulting took place along zones of pre-existing weakness, creating dilational zones and additional 

channel ways for mineralizing fluids (Leavitt, Spell, Glodstrand, & Arehart, 2004) 

At 15.4 Ma, high-grade gold and silver veins formed in fault zones throughout the NNR region 

near Midas, depositing at least 4 million ounces (Moz) of gold and 40 Moz of silver regionally. 

The timing of high-grade Au-Ag mineralization is identical to the age of rhyolite intrusions 

whose source magma chamber likely provided the heat necessary to drive the hydrothermal 

system. The age of an unaltered tuff that unconformably overlies opalized sediments establishes 

that tilting of the units and the hydrothermal system had ceased by 15.2 Ma. The temporal and 

spatial coincidence of rhyolite volcanism, faulting, and high-grade mineralization may reflect the 

importance of contributions from deeper fluid reservoirs containing magmatic components or 

highly exchanged meteoric waters (Leavitt, Spell, Glodstrand, & Arehart, 2004). 

Midas formed during a middle Miocene pulse of bimodal basalt-rhyolite magmatism that was 

widespread throughout the northern Great Basin. The Midas deposit is hosted by a deeply eroded 

section of Miocene volcanic rocks along the eastern margin of the NNR. Drilling in the Midas 

area has shown that Miocene tuffs, flows, and volcaniclastic rocks extend to a depth of at least 

1.5 kilometers (km) beneath the present surface. The depth to older Tertiary volcanic rocks as 

well as pre-Tertiary basement beneath Midas is unknown. Ore is confined to steeply dipping, 

banded quartz veins including the Colorado Grande and Gold Crown veins within north-

northwest–striking faults in felsic units. Unaltered rhyolite vitrophyre and ash-flow tuff top the 

hydrothermally altered host rocks. 

Miocene stratigraphy at Midas (Leavitt, Spell, Glodstrand, & Arehart, 2004) from bottom to top 

overlying undivided Paleozoic rocks consists of: 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 7-7 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

TLT - a lower tuff unit, which forms the base of the altered section of Miocene ash-flow tuffs in 

the district; 

Tjb - The June Belle formation, which overlies the lower tuff unit and comprises a rhyolite flow-

dome-tuff complex, 10 to 250 meters (m) thick; 

Tep - The Elko Prince formation, which has both gradational and sharp contacts with the 

underlying June Belle formation. The Elko Prince formation is composed of a variety of ash-

flow tuffs and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and has been divided into three informal 

members; 

Tep 1 - is up to 155 m thick and consists of green-gray poorly welded lithic-crystal ash-flow tuff 

that contains clasts of basalt, welded tuff, banded rhyolite, and pumice; 

Tep2 - is an intermediate member composed of gray carbonaceous lacustrine, volcaniclastic 

sedimentary rocks, is laterally discontinuous and up to 30 m thick; 

Tep3 - the upper member is composed of light-green lapilli tuff that has undergone little to no 

welding; 

Tepu - a fine-grained, white, sanidine-rich air-fall tuff overlies Tep 3 in some areas; and 

Tes - sediments of the Esmeralda formation, 85 to 260 m thick, consist of an alternating 

sequence of tuffaceous and carbonaceous lacustrine sedimentary rocks, pebble conglomerates, 

and fine-grained amygdaloidal tuffs that form five distinct informal members, Tes1 through 5.

(Modified from Goldstrand and Schmidt, 2000, cited in Leavitt et al., 2004.) 

Numerous mafic sills and dikes intrude, and flows are interbedded within, the felsic volcanic and 

volcaniclastic section described above, and are named Tbg. Peperites (a sedimentary rock that 

contains fragments of igneous material and is formed when magma comes into contact with wet 

sediments) grade laterally into a feature described locally as a clastic dike. The clastic dike is

Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

sub-parallel to a north-south–striking fault that contains the Colorado Grande vein. Emplacement 

of the clastic dike apparently was controlled by this fault. 

The structural setting of the Colorado Grande vein was provided in a laterally and vertically 

persistent, north-south to N30°W-striking, steeply northeast dipping normal fault. The Gold 

Crown vein formed in a steeply northeast dipping, N 50° to 60° W-striking fault that splays into 

the footwall of the Colorado Grande vein on the Midas fault. Other fault splays of similar 

orientation in the hanging wall host additional veins (Leavitt et al., 2004). The Midas fault is the 

principal structure in the mine and dips typically exceed 70o to the southwest and northeast. Late 

lateral shear movement in the Midas fault created northwest (NW) dilational openings that have 

been in-filled by the Colorado Grande vein. The Gold Crown, Discovery, and Snow White veins 

to the northwest are all extensional veins, differing in character from the Colorado Grande. 

Figure 7-4 Section through Midas Mine area. 

 

The Colorado Grande and Gold Crown veins formed during multiple episodes of deposition and 

brecciation. Early silica flooding and brecciation of the wall rocks was followed by deposition of 

banded veins, several centimeters to several meters wide, which comprise high-grade ore. Dark 

bands variably enriched in electrum naumannite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, and minor

galena, aguilarite, and marcasite alternate with quartz-, chalcedony-, adularia-, and calcite-rich 

bands (Leavitt et al., 2004). 

The alteration assemblages at Midas show zonation centered on the main veins. Weak propylitic 

alteration occurs at distances greater than 400 m from the veins. Minor veining and partial 

replacement of phenocrysts and groundmass by chlorite, calcite, minor smectite (predominantly 

montmorillonite), and a trace of pyrite characterize this alteration (Leavitt, Spell, Glodstrand, & 

Arehart, 2004). 

In summary, the structural geology of the district as follows; 

• There are three general stress regimes responsible for the fault geometries and 
mineralization in the Midas district: 

o Generally NW-striking normal faults compose an orthorhombic system that is 
consistent with the regional mid-Miocene strain field, not local magma chamber 
inflation or caldera formation. 

o These faults were then re-activated under a transient change in the stress field that 
coincided with gold deposition. Return to normal faulting followed.  

o Data collected to date indicate that the late Owyhee faults comprise a normal fault 
system, rather than a left lateral one. 

• Application of a structural model in the periphery of the district will be hampered by the 
high-level of exposure in the system known to have blind veins. Growth faults at this 
level may display minimal displacement, much of which may be post-mineral.  

Improved mapping of the outlying areas, in concert with Controlled Source Audio Frequency 

Magnetotellurics Testing (CSAMT), will likely become the primary targeting tools outside the 

main district (Postlethwaite, 2011). 

The Midas fault, host to the Colorado Grande vein, is the principal structure in the mine. It 

strikes approximately N15°W and forms a structural high or arch within the district. Closure of 

rock exposures to the south, and general convergence of bedding strike on the west and east sides 

of the arch to the south, indicate a shallow southerly plunge. East side down, apparent normal 

movement, exceeds 1,000 feet based on drill hole information. Left lateral shear movement along 

the Midas fault has created northwest oriented, dilatant openings within the Colorado Grande 

vein that typically host high grade mineralization. Owyhee structures orientated N65°E are post 

to syn-ore deposition, as the Colorado Grande (Midas Fault) is displaced along the Northern and

Southern Owyhee. These Owyhee structures result from the most recent basin and range 

extensional structural regime (Graf, 2013).

8 Deposit Types 
8.1 Alteration and Mineralization 

On a general scale, the hydrothermal system and subsequent mineralization developed at Midas 

is currently interpreted as a low sulfidation, epithermal precious metal vein system as part of a 

larger magmatic system at depth. A model of this type of system shows how loss of volatiles 

from magmas at depth forms large porphyry deposits adjacent to the intrusions (Figure 8-1). If 

structural and / or hydrologic conditions exist, then metal-rich magmatic fluids would migrate 

upward and outward to form a low sulfidation epithermal deposits (Saunders, 2006). That is the 

type of system believed to have deposited Au-Ag at Midas. 

Figure 8-1 Schematic Diagram of Low-Sulfidation Au, Ag Solutions in Relationship with 
Magma at Depth. 

 

Mineralization at Midas appears to be part of a convective system related to emplacement of a 

mineralizing intrusion at depth. In this schematic model, contacts, faults, and fractures likely 

provided conduits for fluids to migrate to the surface and vent as a hydrothermal hot spring 

sinter. As the hydrothermal fluids cooled, siliceous minerals precipitated and formed the cap. 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 8-2 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

Later oxidation of the upper part of this hydrothermal system likely occurred due to convection 

of a localized plume of low acidity (pH) groundwater. This oxidation effect altered the host rocks 

under the silica cap to an assemblage of clays, zeolites, and iron oxides. 

Midas has the attributes of epithermal mineralization including mineralized structural conduits 

that extended to the paleo-surface, locally; there are remnants of a siliceous sinter cap from hot 

spring emanations, multiple alteration styles, an epithermal vein-alteration suite, open space 

vein-fill within actively rupturing fractures with volcanic textures, and bonanza-grade gold-silver 

deposition in a boiling-zone horizon. 

A chronology of magmatic and hydrothermal events leading to mineralization (Leavitt, Spell, 

Glodstrand, & Arehart, 2004) at Midas include: 

The Midas hydrothermal system developed after mafic volcanism waned and during rift-related 

felsic-dominated volcanism. The documentation in published literature of a close spatial 

association of mineralization with felsic volcanism suggests that felsic intrusions provided a heat 

source to drive convection of hydrothermal fluids and possibly provided metals or other 

components. 

Gentle tilting and faulting during the felsic-dominated volcanism provided plumbing for fluid 

flow. Gently dipping flows of the relatively impermeable red rhyolite (Trf) near the paleo-

surface probably formed a cap to the hydrothermal system that was breached locally by normal 

faults. Normal faults facilitated fluid up-flow. 

Shallow lakes were present in the vicinity of Midas during formation of the host rocks. During 

hydrothermal activity, water from the lakes probably recharged the meteoric water-dominated 

system. 

The nearly synchronous deposition of high-grade selenium and Au-Ag–rich veins throughout the 

Midas area suggests that the metals were derived from the same hydrothermal system and that 

common depositional mechanisms were in place. At Midas, the thickest portions of high grade 

veins occur in dilational zones created by oblique-slip motion along a north-northwest to 

northwest-striking fault system. Evidence of coeval faulting and high-grade mineralization 

suggests that seismic events may have triggered movement along pre-existing zones of weakness

related to the margins of the NNR with release of fluids from deeper hydrothermal reservoirs. 

The presence of bladed calcite and adularia in gold-bearing quartz veins are indicative of boiling, 

possibly caused by the decreased pressure along faulted pathways. 

On a more detailed scale, Midas is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold and silver vein deposit with 

Ag:Au ratio increasing to the east of the main veins (current veins 10:1 ratio). The mineralization 

is hosted in the bi-modal volcanic rocks of the Northern Nevada Rift. Gold and silver selenide 

mineralization occurs within open-space filling veins consisting of banded quartz, adularia and 

calcite. Veins in the Midas mine are surrounded by broad envelopes of prophylitic alteration 

consisting of dark green chlorite, calcite, epidote, and pyrite.

Newmont utilized analysis from CSAMT to target district-wide veins at depth. The CSAMT 

surveys helped Newmont define district structures across the Midas District in conjunction with 

surface mapping and analysis of previous drilling data. Resistive anomalies defined distinct 

structures and near surface silicification commonly associate with veining at depth.

A summary of the 2011 to 2012 drilling results is listed below (Graf 2013): 

Midas drill targets were ranked using the following data sets. 

1. Soil and Rock Chip Geochemistry – As, Hg, and Sb anomalies; 
2. Surface mapping – Large mapped fault structure with favorable orientation; 
3. Geophysics – Controlled source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (CSAMT) anomaly 
4. Epithermal model – Does above data suggest veins at depth?

Results of the 2011 to 2012 drilling of fourteen out of sixteen targets are summarized below: 

(Graf, 2013)  

Opal Hill - One core-tail was drilled in the Opal Hill target during 2012 to test a CSAMT 

anomaly and previously drilled high grade reverse-circulation (RC) intercepts. Mapping in this 

area has defined opalization, potential eruption breccias and drill hole geochemical signatures of 

a high-level epithermal system; indicating probable mineralization at depth. It was recommended 

to drill two holes at various depths along this fault to further define the potential for "bonanza" 

grade Au veins at depth. 

Red Scrabble - Two core-tails and one RC hole were drilled in the Red Scrabble area in 2012. 

These holes originally targeted the northwest (NW) striking Hard Scrabble fault, but drilling 

intercepts have led to a new interpretation of the structure. The Red Scrabble fault appears to be 

the northern extension of the Hard Scrabble fault, but offset along the Southern Owyhee Fault. It 

was recommended to drill two more holes into this structure (500 feet above and below Au 

intercept) to determine where bonanza veins could be located in this fault. 

Grant Jackson / Missing Link - Six core-tail holes were drilled in the Grant Jackson-Missing 

Link area in 2012. These holes were drilled to test veins at depth. There is limited drilling on 

these targets below 5,200 ft due to this being the conceptual ore horizon throughout the Midas 

District. This new drill hole data suggests there is still potential for "bonanza" grade veins at 

depth. The Missing Link Vein has limited drilling. This new intercept suggests that the vein 

maybe striking NW, which may make it a southern extension of the Midas Trend Vein. It was 

recommended to drill one hole on each of these veins in 2013, a deep hole on Grant Jackson to 

test depth, and one hole on Missing Link to test strike. 

Hard Scrabble - Three core-tails and one RC hole were drilled in the Hard Scrabble target 

during 2011-2012 to test a CSAMT anomaly and previously drilled high grade intercepts. 

Geology and mineralization suggest this structure horsetails as it moves to the south. There is 

some inconsistency in logged chips from 2002 to present. These chips and core should be re-

logged. It was recommended to drill two holes 200 feet deeper along this fault to the north to 

further define the potential for "bonanza" grade Au veins at depth.

Golden Belle target - Four core-tail holes were drilled in the Golden Belle area in 2011 and 

three core-tail follow-up holes were drilled in 2012. Five holes were previously completed in the 

mid 2000's, intercepting higher grade Ag. These more recent holes were drilled to test for higher 

grade gold at depth. Due to inconsistency in logging of core and chips, a cross section was not 

constructed until geologic units can be determined. It was recommended to re-log RC drill chips 

to provide consistency within this structural zone. If questions still remain on lithologies, a litho-

geochemical study should be completed to determine chemical identities of Midas geologic units 

to aid in district wide RC logging.  

Eastern Star - One core-tail and two RC holes were drilled targeting the Eastern Star fault in 

2011. Mercury (Hg) anomalies in this area suggest the gold/silver system is below the Hg 

anomaly. The holes were drilled to test for "bonanza" grade veins at depth. The deepest hole 

appears to have missed the interpreted structure and one follow-up RC hole was recommended to 

test this structure at depth. 

Red Bluff - One core hole was drilled into the Red Bluff fault in 2011. This hole was drilled 

with an underground U-8 rig due to pad restriction size and shallow angle of the drilled hole. A 

weak fault zone with quartz was encountered 985 feet down hole, which corresponds with the 

west dipping Red Bluff fault. This area has the potential to host Au mineralization, but no 

drilling was recommended in this area. 

Fe Oxide fault - Two RC holes and two core-tails were drilled into the FeOx target during 2011-

2012 to test a CSAMT anomaly and surface mapped fault. The two RC holes were drilled into 

the footwall (FW) of the fault and the two core tails crossed the fault. The fault contact was 

Tep1/Tess, indicating significant offset, however, there was no Au or vein mineralization present 

within the fault. There are weak anomalies of arsenic (As) along the fault. No drilling was 

recommended in the FeOx area. 

Astralagus - One core-tail and one RC hole were drilled into the Astralagus target during 2012 

to test a CSAMT anomaly and surface mapped fault with Test hanging wall (HW) and Tep1 FW. 

This is similar to offset seen to the south in the FeOx area. There was no Au or vein 

mineralization present within the fault. No significant geochemical anomalies were found within 

the drill holes. No drilling was recommended in the Astralagus area.

Mill Hill - One RC hole was drilled into the East Squaw Creek Fault during 2011 to test a 

CSAMT anomaly. This hole had no Au or geochemical anomalies, and no fault structures were 

encountered. No drilling was recommended in the Mill Hill area. 

Homestead Two core-tail holes were drilled in the Homestead area during 2011-2012. These 

holes were drilled about 500' and about 1,500' north of the limit of underground drilling along 

the Homestead Vein. The furthest north underground intercept along the vein assayed 1.0 foot at 

0.119 Au and 47.80 Ag. Both of the holes crossed the modeled structure, however returned no 

significant intercepts. No drilling was recommended on this vein structure until further mining 

occurs development along the East Veins. 

Colorado Norte / Hoodoos - One core-tail and one RC hole were drilled into the Colorado 

Norte/Hoodoo's faults during 2011-2012 encountering a fault structure (repeated section 

suggesting down drop to the west) filled with a mafic dike. There was no Au anomaly, but  

significant anomalies in As, Hg, and stibnite (Sb), suggesting high level mineralization. One hole 

was drilled into the Hoodoos fault structure. This hole had no Au or geochemical anomalies, and 

no fault structures were encountered. It was recommended to drill below the anomalies in the 

Colorado Norte area, but due to the lack of Au encountered it was not considered a priority.  No 

drilling was recommended for the Hoodoos area. 

Eastern Sleeper - One RC hole was drilled into the Eastern Sleeper fault to test a CSAMT 

anomaly. This hole had no Au or geochemical anomalies, and no fault structures were 

encountered. No drilling was recommended in the Eastern Sleeper area. 

Saddle - One RC hole was drilled into the Saddle fault to test a CSAMT anomaly. This hole had 

no Au or geochemical anomalies, and no fault structures were encountered. No drilling was 

recommended in the Saddle area. 

In summary: Fourteen drill targets were tested over the last two years after careful review of 

geologic and geophysical attributes. Four areas have the potential for large Au deposits which 

require follow up drilling. They include: 

1. Opal Hill 
2. Red Scrabble 
3. Grant Jackson/Missing link

4. Hard Scrabble 

Additionally, re-logging of RC chips and core at Golden Belle were recommended to further 

refine that promising target. 

9.3 Klondex's 2014 Drill Plan 

 "The Midas Exploration team has adopted the low-sulfidation epithermal model in Figure 8-1 in 

aiding the discovery of the next large (> 1 million ounces) low-sulfidation vein system within the 

Midas District. This model information, coupled with a geochemical study on the Colorado 

Grande Vein, has increased the understanding of the depth to "bonanza" grade ore along vein 

systems. Two conclusions have been adopted to understand zoning within the mineralization 

systems: 

1. Arsenic is relatively enriched above the ore body. Arsenic values ranging from 0-10 parts 

per million (ppm) indicate a position below the ore body; values ranging from 10-25 ppm 

indicate a position within the ore body; and values ranging from 25 to over 100 ppm 

indicate a position above the ore body. 

2. Base metal enrichment with depth is not recognized. However, Cu is somewhat enriched 

at depth, where values ranging from 150 to 200 ppm occur below the ore body; values 

ranging from 50 to 150 ppm occur within the ore body; and values ranging from 0 to 50 

ppm occur above the ore body.

10 Drilling and Sampling Methodology 
10.1 Drill Core Sampling 

In November 2013, authors of this report visited the Midas site but did not observe any drilling 

or sample recovery. The procedures used have been summarized from interviews with the Midas 

technical staff that have been employed at Midas by both Newmont and Klondex. These 

procedures are as follows: 

1. Handling of the drilled core from the station includes drilling with a Diamec U8 core rig 

(other types of drill rigs have been used in the past). Drillers label core box lids with a 

unique Bore Hole Identification number (BHID, which includes the year), box number, 

and drilled interval. Drillers put the core in with top of drilled sequence leading the run in 

the box and end of drilled interval ending the run in the box. Drillers label the end of the 

run to the nearest one tenth of a foot, and measure and record the recovery in feet on 

wooden blocks, which are put at the end of the drilled interval; 

2. Drillers stack full core boxes on a pallet in numerical order; and 

3. Drillers or geotechnicians either deliver the pallet to surface or take a partial delivery of 

core boxes in the back of their motorized underground personnel vehicle. They leave the 

pallet of core boxes (or individual core boxes on a spare pallet) at the core logging 

facility. 

Collar locations and downhole surveys were conducted by Newmont staff with Newmont 

equipment, and the data uploaded directly into acQuire. 

Channel samples along production drifts were also incorporated into this mineral resource 

estimate. The channel sample locations are stored as "synthetic drill holes" in acQuire in order to 

utilize them spatially with software (northings, eastings, elevations, azimuth, dip, and length). 

The northing, easting, and elevation of the samples were derived from Vulcan after geologists 

digitized the channel sample locations into the digital underground drift asbuilt survey. The 

channel sample locations were not survey points that can be verified by the author, but the 

asbuilts are derived from surveys.

It is not known by the authors what percent of core recovery Newmont experienced at Midas. 

Material from split core, rejects, RC chips, and pulps were stored by Newmont onsite within a 

fenced and protected facility. 

Newmont logged core utilizing electronic tablets and uploaded data directly into acQuire.  

Newmont's logging protocols for core have not been reviewed by the authors. 

10.2 Face Sampling 

Face sampling methodology at Midas by Newmont geologists is typical of narrow vein mining 

operations. The geologists collected material from the face by hand with a rock hammer to chip 

off multiple fragments in the face across the vein and wall rock representing all material from a 

variety of features, such as silicified patches, oxidized breccias, vug-fill, free gold, etc. The 

Newmont geologist collected various features proportionately within a measured zone for one 

sample as follows: 

1. Before sampling and mapping a face, the geologist washed the face with water from a 

hose to expose the vein, structures such as faults, and alteration and to remove 

contaminants from the blast; 

2. Sampling and mapping followed the wash; 

3. Three samples were collected from the face: left wall rock, vein, and right wall rock from 

left to right. The area sampled was from the sill to the extent of reach by hand; 

4. Samples consisted of chips removed by rock hammer into a bag, which was slipped 

inside a bucket; 

NOTE: A geologist pre-labeled the bags on the surface during pre-shift with a bar-coded sticky 

label, which was also stapled on. Additionally, the geologist also labeled the bags with a 

permanent magic marker. 

5. All samples had a three letter prefix followed by a six digit number: KSF000000 = 

channel sample; 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 10-3 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

6. After the sampling procedures were completed, the geologist mapped the face and 

recorded vein widths, sample locations, and structural features in hand-written notes on a 

face sheet; 

7. The geologist marked the vein margins, structures, face heading, and distance with spray 

paint on the wall rock; 

8. The geologist took the bagged samples to the geology office and hand-entered data into a 

central Excel spreadsheet including SampleID, face distance, date, geologist name, 

sample widths, and a geologic description of the sample; 

NOTE: The location of the sample channels are measured from known points along the drift 

alignment and posted on face sheets and plan maps. Location sheets are then scanned. Channel 

locations (faces) are digitized with Vulcan Software. Channel collar eastings, northings, and 

elevations are obtained using Vulcan software. Individual sample widths are obtained from 

mapping at the time of sampling. Channel location coordinates are exported from Vulcan into 

CSV (comma-separated values) formatted collar files. Sample width values are hand entered into 

CSV formatted sample files with assay results pasted from laboratory reports. The channel 

sample files are then imported into Vulcan Software and modeled as synthetic drill holes using 

the eastings, northings, elevation, width, and assay values. 

9. All samples collected within a twelve-hour shift were entered into a sample submittal 

form, which was saved on the company server; 

NOTE: QAQC samples were not inserted in the channel sample stream at Midas. Channel 

sample assays were performed at Newmont's Twin Creeks laboratory rather than an independent 

assay lab.  Twin Creeks analyses production and grade control samples for Newmont's other 

western Nevada mines. The past production history of over 2 million gold ounces from the 

Midas Mine supports the validity of the channel samples and the authors believe that they are 

accurate.   

10. The samples were sent to the assay lab after every twelve-hour shift.

11 Sample Preparation Analysis and Security 
11.1 Core Sample Preparation 

Core sampling procedures related herein have been summarized from interviews with Midas 

geology staff, as follows: 

1. The core boxes were lifted onto a rolling counter to the left of the splitter machine. The 

splitter machine was in front of the geotechnician (geotech). A cloth sample bag in a 

bucket was placed on the floor at the feet of the technician for the prepped sample 

material. 

2. It is not known by the authors how sample bags for split core were labeled. However, 

Newmont utilized a bar coded system at Midas, and the labels may have been bar coded. 

3. The Geotech split the core to approximately 50% of the sample bisecting veins equally. 

4. The left half of the split was returned to the core box, the right was dropped into the 

sample bag. 

NOTE: RC splits were sent to ALS for assaying. 

5. When the single sample interval had been bagged, the full sample bag was tied shut and 

stacked in numeric order on the floor by the door. 

6. The geotech assembled the standards and blanks into corresponding sample bags which 

were labeled according to the cut sheet. It is not known by the authors how the standards 

and blanks at Midas were derived. 

7. When an entire drill hole had been completely split, the bags of sample were stacked 

inside a large, open, plastic bin outside the core facility. The entire bin of samples was 

picked up and delivered to ALS by the lab driver; 

8. QAQC samples were bagged and labeled by geotechs. When the driver from ALS 

arrived, he was given these samples to accompany the samples from the corresponding 

drill hole; 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 11-2 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

9. The reserved halves of core were kept in core boxes and extra RC chips in sample bags 

and were stored on site at Midas. 

10. The geotech notified the geologist when a hole was ready to be sent to ALS. 

11. An electronic sample submittal sheet was generated and given to the truck driver for 

ALS. 

11.2  Channel Sample Preparation 

The following outlines the channel sample preparation methodology. 

1. Channel samples at Midas were bagged on site at the face. 

2. Full bags were brought to the Geology office. 

3. QAQC materials were not inserted into the channel sample dispatch. 

4. Channel samples were delivered to Newmont's Twin Creeks lab every twelve-hour shift. 

11.3 Sample Analysis Protocol 

Sample analysis protocols at Midas were not reviewed by the author for this report. 

11.4 Sample Security Measures 

Not reviewed by the authors for this report. 

 
11.5 Quality Control Measures 

Newmont geologists routinely inserted blind standards and blanks with the drill core samples 

submitted to ALS for assaying.  These standards and blanks were selected from an inventory of 

QA/QC materials maintained by Newmont at their Nevada operations. The authors have 

reviewed the gold assay QA/QC performance only for the drill core submitted to ALS from drill 

holes that penetrated the eastern veins. The silver QA/QC data for the drill core was not 

reviewed, and the gold and silver QA/QC data for the channel samples was also not reviewed by 

the authors.

The performance of standard samples submitted with drill core to ALS is summarized in Table 

11-1 below, and graphical results for individual standards are presented in Figure 11-1 through 

Figure 11-6. All of these results are within acceptable statistical limits with the exception of 

standard GVL.  The value for standard GVL of 0.0049 gold opt is below the detection limit for 

the assay method employed by ALS on the Midas drill core samples, and the discrepancy is 

insignificant.

11.6 Opinion on the Adequacy of the Sampling Methodologies 

Newmont staff at Midas have shown a solid understanding with regard to management of the 

drilled core and associated digital data. The methods of handling the drilled material both 

physically and electronically are acceptable for use in an analysis of the mineral resource, 

however, there exist system improvements that should be implemented in the future as Klondex 

assumes operation of the Project. 

11.6.1 Sampling Protocol Issues 

There are no known issues with sampling protocol by Newmont at Midas. 

11.6.2 Standards and Blanks Performance Issues 

There are no known quality assurances or quality control issues with sampling protocol by 

Newmont at Midas. Klondex should implement a program of inserting standards and blanks in 

the channel sample stream similar to that used by Newmont for drill core.

12 Data Verification 
12.1 Data Validation Procedures 

In March 2014, QP, Michele White, commenced review of Newmont drilling and channel 

sample data and protocols for Midas. This review was performed for verification purposes to 

allow the Newmont datasets to contribute to evaluation of the mineral resource estimate 

provided. This validation addresses assay results from drilled material and channel samples from 

production drifts. 

Midas geologists provided specific datasets for validation derived from the Newmont acQuire 

database for use in resource modeling. The authors analyzed a random population of datasets 

representing 5% of the total samples produced from drilled and channel material used in the 

resource estimate. 

In addition to verifying gold and silver values for sampled material derived from drilling at 

Midas, this validation also reviewed general technical data related to sampling, such as the 

location of the drill hole collars and the downhole survey data per sampled interval. Geologic 

logs were also reviewed to validate the data to be used as part of the geologic modeling for 

shaping and projecting trends of the veins for resource estimates. The only datasets available for 

tracing channel samples to original data were face sheets for reviewing sample interval and 

geology. There were no assay certificates provided to the authors from an outside laboratory to 

validate the channel samples' gold values because the channel samples were processed in-house 

at the Newmont Twin Creeks laboratory and the results uploaded from the assay Laboratory 

Information Management System (LIMS) directly into the Newmont acQuire database system.  

Specific technical dataset audits were compared for direct correlation, record-by-record, between 

the original source data and the March 2014 exported tables from the acQuire database used for 

resource estimation. The scale of detailed examination record-by-record produced a positive data 

validation covering 5% of the data used in the resource estimate that was derived from 

Newmont's acQuire database, which upholds the integrity of the assay values for use in the 

resource estimate.

12.2 Datasets Submitted for Evaluation 

Two datasets and related source files for estimating the resource were reviewed by the authors: 

drilling and channel sampling. Specific details of the sampled material include review of: 

• Collar locations: raw collar survey reports for 22 out of 424 (about 5%) of the drill holes 

used in the resource estimate. (There were no survey records provided for the channel samples.) 

Exported csv files from Newmont's acQuire; 

• Downhole survey: raw downhole survey reports for 22 out of 424 (about 5%) of the drill 

holes used in the resource estimate. Exported csv files from Newmont's acQuire database; 

• Lithology: electronic geological logs for 22 out of 424 (about 5%) of the drill holes used 

in the resource estimate and face sheets with geology for 35 out of 696 (about 5%) of channel 

samples used in the resource estimate. Exported csv files from Newmont's acQuire; 

• Sample intervals: Newmont electronic cut-sheets with SampleID and sample intervals for 

5% of the drill holes used in the resource estimate and face sheets for 5% of the channel samples 

with SampleID and sample intervals used in the resource estimate; and 

• Assays: original ALS PDF assay result certificates for 5% of the drill holes used in the 

resource estimate. Exported csv files from Newmont's acQuire database and from Practical 

Mining's ISIS database. There are no assay certificates for the channel samples. 

Table 12-1 summarizes the numbers and percent of drilling and channel samples reviewed for

12.3 Collar Location Checks 

The authors reviewed 22 of Newmont's collar survey reports provided by Klondex for 5% of the 

drill holes utilized in this resource estimate and found a 100% match between the original reports 

values and the acQuire database for easting, northing, elevation and depth. It is unknown to the 

authors in which datum the original surveys were collected or if the data was subsequently re-

projected in  acQuire. There were no channel sample surveys, but the location of the samples fits 

the surveyed asbuilts in Vulcan without any manipulation of data. 

In summary, the authors observe a positive correlation in a chain of custody from original survey 

reports to acQuire for drill holes and for channel sample locations based on their projection in 

Vulcan to asbuilts. 

12.4 Down hole Survey Checks 

The authors reviewed 2,231 original down hole survey records from International Directional 

Services (IDS) for 22 drill holes against the records in Newmont's acQuire database (five percent 

of the total down hole survey record population used in the resource estimate). There were 2,121 

direct matches and 110 records with discrepancies in the azimuth uniformly off by 10 degrees in 

the drill hole MUC-01889. The azimuth of that hole is not expected to impact the resource 

estimate. In summary, 5% of the down hole surveys in Newmont's acQuire database were 

matched with original down hole survey records, demonstrating reliable data integrity. 

12.5 Lithology Review 

From the 424 drill holes utilized in this resource estimate, 22 (or about 5%) of the geological 

logs were randomly selected and reviewed by the authors. From the 10,217 lithology records for 

drilled material used in the resource estimate, 10,211 lithology records were directly matched to 

logs and 6 of them were non-matches. The non-matches resulted from the inclusion of blank 

values in the acQuire database, whereas the logs had lithology values. In these cases, the lack of 

a lithology code has no bearing on the geologic model utilized as the basis of this resource 

estimate.  

Of the 696 channel samples used in this resource estimate, 35 (about 5%) of the geological 

summaries in original face sheets were reviewed by the authors. There were 107 total geological

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

records reviewed in the selected dataset with only 2 discrepancies, one of which was a lack of 

value in the acQuire database whereas the face sheet noted a formation type, the other had the 

value of GH in the database and GP in the log. The discrepancies do not affect the geological 

model utilized in the March 2014 resource estimate. 

In summary, Newmont's acQuire database shows excellent correlation with the original 

electronic geological logs. 

12.6 Sample ID and Sample Interval Checks 

The drill hole sample records in the Newmont acQuire database exports are sorted by their 

sampling interval and do not include SampleID in the tables. From the 424 drill holes utilized in 

this resource estimate, 22 (or about 5%) of the sample intervals in original cut sheets were 

randomly selected and reviewed by the authors in comparison to the Newmont acQuire database 

exported tables. From the 3,082 records reviewed for drilled material used in the resource 

estimate, 3,079 sample intervals were directly matched to the cut sheets, but 3 records in the 

acQuire database were not included in the cut sheets. The latter are samples at the end of MUC-

02242 and do not adversely affect this resource estimate. The sample intervals correlate well 

between the cut sheets and the acQuire database. 

Of the 696 channel samples used in this resource estimate, 35 (about 5%) of the sample intervals 

and SampleIDs in original face sheets were reviewed by the authors. There were 107 total 

records reviewed in the selected dataset with 100% direct correlation between the face sheet and 

the acQuire database. 

In summary, Newmont's acQuire database shows excellent correlation with the sample intervals 

in the corresponding original cut sheets. 

12.7 Assay Certificate Checks 

The authors compared assay values for samples from 22 drill holes in Newmont's acQuire 

database to the original PDFs of certified assay results from ALS, which is about 5% of the total 

drill holes utilized in this resource estimate. There was one discrepancy in MUC-02181. The 

Newmont acQuire database has a silver value of 156.22 opt Ag for sample interval 527.7 to 

526.5, whereas the assay certificate has 116.5. The gold values match for this sample interval. It 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 12-5 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

is possible that this sample, due to its high grade, was resampled and the later assay certificate is 

the source of the larger silver value. In any case, both values contribute equally to the resource 

estimate, and this discrepancy is not considered an issue by the authors. 

There were no assay certificates provided for the channel samples. This material was processed 

in Newmont's own laboratories, and their LIMS uploaded assay results directly into acQuire 

without generating individual reports. Due to the excellent correlation between drilled sample 

results and the acQuire database, the methodology for uploading data from LIMS to acQuire is 

probably excellent, though a review of Newmont's laboratory results or external audit of their 

lab has not been evaluated by the authors for this report. 

In summary, the Newmont acQuire database demonstrates excellent correlation with the original 

assay certificates for drilled material; but the assays for channel samples are reliant on supposing 

that the Newmont in-house laboratory produces accurate assay results. The upload of Newmont's 

LIMS data to acQuire is probably seamless. 

12.8 Format Conversions 

Gold and silver assay results from ALS are reported to Newmont in both opt and in ppm. 

Newmont directly imported the assay values into acQuire and relied on acQuire to automatically 

adjust the units.  

12.9 Newmont acQuire Database Compared to the ISIS Database 

In March 2014, QP, Michele White analyzed exported tables of data from Newmont's acQuire 

database and copies of original documents specific to supporting a chain of custody and 

validation of data utilized in this resource estimate for Midas. Then, the validated Newmont 

datasets were cross-checked against the ISIS database used for modeling. There was a 100% 

direct correlation between Newmont's acQuire database and the ISIS database used for the 

resource estimate, because acQuire exported tables of data for collar locations, downhole 

surveys, lithology, and assays with sample intervals are ISIS formatted tables, which were then 

directly uploaded into Vulcan for the resource estimate without any data manipulation. 

In summary, all of the ISIS records of data utilized in this resource estimate exactly match the 

source: Newmont's acQuire database.

12.10 Summary of Database Verification 

The ISIS database utilized for the this resource estimate complies with standards prescribed by 

CIM protocol. 

In summary, 5% of each data set (with the exception of channel assays) under review was 

verified against original source data as listed above for accuracy. The authors consider that the 

validation work for this report is at a sufficient level to allow the use of the database in a CIM 

mineral resource estimate. In particular, the accuracy of the assay database has been quantified 

by independent review for 5% of the assay results utilized in the ISIS database by direct 

correlation with scanned assay certificates from accredited laboratories. The author's verification 

of the results indicates there is no significant grade bias in the primary laboratory data.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
The Midas Mill has been in operation since 1998 and has successfully recovered over 2,220,000 

ounces of gold and over 27,300,000 ounces of silver. 

13.1 Midas Mill 

The Midas Mill uses conventional leach technology and Merrill Crowe precipitation, with 

gravity concentration after crushing and grinding. A complete process description is given in 

Section 17. 

13.2 Mineralogy 

As the Midas underground mine has matured, production has shifted from the Main Veins to the 

East Veins. The metallurgy of the East Veins is more complex and has been the focus of 

metallurgical testing in recent years.   

13.2.1 Main Veins 

Main Vein mineralization contains free-milling gold, associated with silver in electrum. Small 

amounts of silver associated minerals also contain recoverable silver values. 

13.2.2 East Veins 

The East Veins have gold values that are diminished compared to the Main Veins. The ratio of 

silver to gold is much higher in the East Veins. Mined silver-to-gold ratios in the East Veins can 

be as high as 50:1 and average approximately 22:1. Though silver occurs in gold related 

electrum, most is in more exotic silver minerals. Other selenide minerals may also be present. 

Primary silver minerals in the Midas East Veins are argentite (Ag2S), naumannite (Ag2Se), and 

aguilerite (Ag4SeS). Processing and recovery of these clay-related minerals have been studied by 

Newmont metallurgists. 

It has been determined that silver selenides are less soluble than electrum and argentite.  

Successful recovery requires a combination of finer grinding, higher levels of cyanide in 

solution, and increased leach retention times.

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

13.3 Testing and Procedures 

Third party metallurgical testing results are not available. Newmont has conducted extensive 

testing, both on-site and at other Newmont laboratories. 

Midas test work focused on the East Vein mineralization. Analysis included iterative leach tests 

varying the following parameters: blend, grind, leach time, cyanide, zinc, and leach catalysts 

such as lead-nitrate. 

Metallurgical test work was completed on multiple requested Midas Eastern Expansion 

composites made up of exploration samples. The composites represented defined areas of 

Charger Hill, Ace, GP, Homestead, and Corral veins. Test parameters were targeted at a 75 to 80 

percent passing a 200 mesh grind, and cyanide additions were monitored and maintained at 5.0 

pounds per ton for the first twenty-four hours of a ninety-six hour residence leach. All percent 

recoveries are based on the back calculated head grades. 

Table 13-1 indicates the type of samples that were used in East Vein test work starting in 2010 

(Newmont Mining Corporation, 2010).

13.4 Toll Milling 

Toll milling of material from third party sources has been processed periodically at the Midas 

Mill since 2008. The focus of ongoing metallurgical testing has been to determine how these

materials typically behave in processing as blended with Midas mineralization. Table 13-2 

summarizes the tonnage of processing toll milling at Midas from 2008 through October 2013.

In summary, careful metallurgical practices during processing of variable ores while maintaining 

gold recovery despite changing silver grades have proven successful at Midas. Controlling the 

reagents in the refinery based on mineralogy have allowed the operation to benefit from the 

higher silver grades in the East Veins.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 
14.1 Introduction 

The general arrangement of the Midas veins that have been included in previous resource 

estimates are shown in Figure 14-1 through Figure 14-3. The veins commonly referred to as the 

Main Veins are the Colorado Grande (105), Gold Crown (205), Gold Crown Hanging Wall 

(305), Snow White (405), Discovery (505) and Happy (1081).  These strike north westerly and 

dip 75 – 80 degrees east. Other veins in the main group but not shown are the Sleeping Beauty 

(605) and the Colorado Sur (705). The East Vein group is comprised of the Homestead (777), 

Charger Hill (805), GP (905) and Ace (9052). These veins also strike north westerly but dip 70 – 

75 degrees west. Nearly all of the previous mining has occurred on the Main Veins with 

development and limited production of the East Veins beginning in 2013.

This resource estimate only includes the 205, 305 805, 905 and 9052 veins. These have been 

identified as the initial source of mine production over the next two to three years while Klondex 

develops long range exploration and mining plans. 

Newmont Midas geologists and QP Swanson updated the geology and resource models for the 

veins included in this resource estimate during the period from October 2012 to November 2013. 

This work serves as the basis for the mineral resource estimate for this Technical Report. 

14.2 Drill Database and Compositing 

The drill database used for this estimate is dated March 25, 2013, and the channel database is 

dated October 23, 2013. Drill holes were not distinguished between reverse circulation (RC) and 

core and are treated equally.  

The geology database includes fields for formation, rock type, silicification quartz and 

naumanite. The formation field is the most used for modelling. 

Newmont geologists reviewed each drill hole and channel sample to determine which intercepts 

belong to each vein. Once this has been determined the vein field in the drill database was 

flagged with a numeric vein designation, along with the prefix "DH" (drill hole), "CH" (channel 

sample), or "ODH" (if a channel sample replaces a drill intercept). 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 14-5

The assay fields used in the estimation are gold fire assay and silver fire assay. Table 14-1 

summarizes the drill and channel assays used in this estimation.

A single drill or channel composite was created for each vein intercept extending the full width 

of the vein. A separate composite database is maintained for each vein, and the composite prefix 

of DH, CH or ODH allows selection of the correct composite during the grade estimation 

process. Table 14-2 provides a summary of the composites used for this mineral resource 

estimate.

14.3 Vein Modeling 

Three dimensional digital models are created of the hanging wall and footwall for each vein.  

These are digitized by snapping to the vein intercept points. The wall surfaces are then merged to 

form a closed model. This model is then used to constrain the grade estimation to only those 

blocks within the vein and grades are not assigned to any blocks outside of the vein model.

For each vein and each set of composites, grade caps were determined for gold and silver. Cap 

grades are shown in Table 14-6 below, and the derivation of the cap grade for the 905 vein is 

illustrated in Figure 14-6.  During the estimation, the value of composites exceeding the grade 

cap are reduced to the cap value to limit the influence of exceptionally high grades.

Gold and silver variograms were calculated for the 205 and 305 veins. The lack of sufficient 

channel sample data for the 805, 905, and 9052 veins prevents the creation of reliable variograms 

for these veins. The ordinary kriging estimation method was used to estimate blocks which are 

influenced by the channel data for the 205 and 305 veins. Blocks outside of this area and all of 

the 805, 905 and 9052 veins are estimated with the inverse distance squared method using only

14.6 Block Modeling 

Each vein block model is rotated along the general strike of the vein with the X axis 

perpendicular to the vein and corresponding to the width of the vein and the Y axis being the 

general strike of the vein. Block dimensions are five by five feet in the Y and Z directions while 

the X dimension is set equal to the vein width. The X dimension or width is accurate to within 

0.2 foot The orientation, origin coordinates and extent of each block model are shown in Table

Each block model uses two triangulations to create the blocks.  A waste triangulation that 

surrounds the vein triangulation by 10 feet is used in addition to the vein triangulation. The result 

is that only three blocks exist in the width or X direction of the block model; a 10 foot waste 

block on the footwall side, then the variable width vein block, and then a 10 foot waste block on

the hanging wall side. The blocks that would exist to the edge of the block model are not created 

to keep the model to a manageable size. All blocks are 5 feet by 5 feet in the Y and Z directions. 

14.7 Grade Estimation and Mineral Resource Classification 

Grade estimation occurred in two passes for each variable.  The first pass only selects composites 

within a restricted search distance while the second pass uses an expanded search. The 205 and 

305 veins were estimated with ordinary kriging using the channel and drill composites with a 60 

feet search radius.  Blocks on the peripheral to the channel composites were estimated using 

inverse distance squared and using only the drill hole composites within the nominated search 

parameters. 

Anisotropic search parameters for gold and silver were set to the general orientation of each vein. 

Distances were selected based on the spacing of composites intercepting the solids and on the 

general orientation and shape of the interpreted solids. However, larger search distances were 

used in pass 2 to ensure that most of the blocks inside the veins were estimated. Table 14-10 and 

Table 14-11 shows the estimation parameters for pass one and pass two, respectively for each 

vein.

Significant parameters used in the gold interpolation include: 

1. Assigning of parent block values to sub-blocks.  Estimates are only calculated at 
the center of each parent block, and those values are assigned to all sub-blocks 
existing within the parent block space. 

2. Only composites with a value >=0 were used. 
3. Composites were selected using anisotropic distances. 
4. Only composites within the veins were used to estimate blocks within the veins, 

composites outside the vein model were ignored. 
5. Grades were capped for each data population for each vein. 
6. A gold value of 0.0001 opt was assigned to the un-estimated vein blocks and the 

waste blocks. 
7. A silver value of 0.001 opt was assigned to the un-estimated vein blocks and the 

waste blocks. 

Mineral resource classifications were assigned to blocks based on the average distance to the 

composites used in the block estimation and on the total number of composites selected for the 

grade estimation.  Measured resources require a minimum of two and maximum of eight 

composites, and the average distance to those composites must be less than 50 feet.  For 

indicated resources, the average distance must be greater than 50 feet and less than 100 feet with 

the same constraints on the number of composites used as in measured resources.  Inferred 

mineral resources are those where the average distance is greater than 100 feet and less than 200 

feet with the same requirements for number of composites as in measured and indicated 

resources.

14.8 Mined Depletion 

Mining depletion was incorporated into the block models using the asbuilt surveys through the 

end of January 2014.  Blocks within the general mining perimeter of each vein were flagged as 

"mined" and excluded from mineral resource estimates.  The depletion limits and average gold 

equivalent block grades for each vein are shown in Figure 14-7 through Figure 14-11. Gold 

equivalent values are calculated at the rate of 66 silver ounces per one gold ounce.  This 

conversion is documented in section 14.10.

14.9 Block Model Validation 

On a global basis, the gold and silver estimation methods compare well with each other and with 

the average grade of the gold composites within the veins.  The composites grade is higher than 

the block estimations as is expected.  The gold results are shown in Table 14-12 and silver results 

are shown in Table 14-13.

14.10 Mineral Resource Statement 

The narrow vein mining methods practiced at the Midas Mine require a minimum stope width of 

four feet. The veins at Midas can vary in thickness from a few inches to over ten feet. Potentially 

economic mineralization must meet standard cut-off grade criteria as well as a grade thickness 

criterion before it is included as a resource. Grade thickness is calculated by multiplying the 

block horizontal width by its equivalent grade. The parameters used in determining the cut-off 

grade and grade thickness cut-off are listed in Table 14-14. Long sections displaying the grade-

thickness values for each vein are shown in Figure 14-19 through Figure 14-23.

Notes: 

1. Mineral resources have been calculated at a gold price of $1,250/troy ounce and a silver price of $20.00 
per troy ounce; 

2. Mineral resources are calculated at a grade thickness cut-off grade of 0.70 Au equivalent opt-feet and a 
diluted Au equivalent cut-off grade of 0.159 opt ; 

3. Sixty-six ounces of silver is equivalent to one ounce of gold; 
4. Mining width is defined as four feet or the vein horizontal width plus one foot, whichever is greater. 
5. Mineral resources include dilution to achieve mining widths and an additional 10% unplanned dilution. 
6. Mineral resources include allowance for 5% mining losses;

7. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 
estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-
political, marketing, or other relevant issues, and; 

8. The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature 
and there is insufficient exploration to define these inferred mineral resources as an indicated or measured 
mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or 
measured mineral resource category. 

 
14.11 Other Resource Constraints 

Midas is located within the prolific gold producing area of north eastern Nevada. This area has a 

long history of mining and a significant percentage of the local population is either directly or 

indirectly engaged in the local mining industry. The local environmental activist groups are not a 

deterrent to mining but rather make constructive contributions to the permitting process. The 

authors are not aware of any environmental, legal, political or socio-economic constraints which 

could impact the resource estimate presented herein. The environmental monitoring and 

reclamation obligations of the Midas Mine and Mill are discussed further in Section 19. 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 15-1 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

15 Mining Methods 
The near mine veins at Midas are divided into three major groups, which are shown graphically 

in Figure 15-1 and listed in Table 15-1. Prior to 2013, all production was from the Main Vein 

group, particularly the Colorado Grande Vein. With mining of the Main Veins nearing 

completion, Newmont began development of the East Veins in 2012 and 2013. These veins are 

projected to be the major source of production for the next two to three years. 

The third group of veins is comprised of the Queen and SR veins located to south of the existing 

workings and across a major fault zone. These veins have not been mined and are defined by 

surface drilling. Development to reach these veins and provide an underground drill platform for 

further delineation was halted in 2012 due to budget constraints. These veins represent a high 

priority near mine target for potential resource additions.

15.1 Primary Mine Development 

Midas is a modern, mechanized, narrow vein underground mine, and employs rubber tired 

haulage equipment to transport mineralized material and waste to the surface. Main haulage 

ramps are excavated 16 feet wide by 17 feet high. Spirals are typically located 1,000 feet apart 

along strike to optimize ore development and are optimally located in the more competent rock 

of the footwall (Figure 15-2). Spiral accesses are 15 feet wide by 15 feet high, with a standard 

radius of 70 feet and standard gradient of plus or minus 12.5%. A typical level access has a 

ventilation/escape raise and access to an ore pass and waste pass. Level crosscuts to the veins are 

located on 50 feet vertical sublevels (Figure 15-3).

Figure 15-3 Typical Heading Design and Actual Rib Detail 

 

Access for the East Veins is from existing development of the Main Veins. Spiral 7 is east of 

Spiral 4 and is accessed from the 4-4550 and the 4-4800 accesses. Spiral 8 is east of Spiral 3 and 

is accessed through the 3-4550 and the 3-4851 accesses. Additional drilling is required to 

determine the economic potential of Spiral 9, and Klondex is planning to complete an 

exploration drift from the 1-5001, which would provide access to Spiral 9 if it is brought into the 

plan. If Spiral 9 is planned, it will also be accessed from the 4720 Haulage (Figure 15-4).

15.2 Ventilation and Secondary Egress 

Fresh air intake to the mine is provided by the Downcast Vent Raise ("DVR") at 690 thousand 

cubic feet per minute (kcfm) and by the portal at 420 kcfm. Three exhaust raises are strategically 

located to complete the ventilation circuit. The ventilation circuit is powered by seven main fans 

located at the surface of the ventilation raises. The main fans total 2,025 connected horse power 

(HP). 

The raise near Spiral 4 is equipped with an escape hoist and capsule to provide emergency egress 

if the main evacuation route is blocked during an emergency. Additionally, there are 15 refuge 

chambers distributed throughout the mine in the event evacuation is not feasible. These refuge 

chambers are equipped with carbon dioxide filters, compressed breathable air tanks, food and 

communication to the surface.  

15.3 Power Distribution and Dewatering 

Electrical power to the mine is provided by a 4,160-volt feeder and stepped down to 480 volts for 

distribution. Step down transformers and circuit protection are provided by 22 load centers 

located throughout the mine. 

Water discharge from the mine currently averages 150 gallons per minute (gpm). Mine water 

requirements average 50 gpm and are provided by treatment and recirculation of discharge. The 

balance of 100 gpm is pumped to the tailings dam for evaporation. 

15.4 Equipment Fleet 

Underground mining equipment and surface support equipment included in the sale are listed in 

Table 15-2 and Table 15-3 respectively.  The reduction in mine production rates, necessitated by 

declining resources, gives rise to an excess of capacity in the mining equipment fleet.  Klondex 

may elect to relocate some of this equipment to their Fire Creek Project rather than have it 

remain idle at Midas.

15.5 Mining Methods 

15.5.1 Sub Level Stoping 

Sublevel stoping is the primary mining method for the five narrow Main Veins at Midas. From 

the portal, there are three major haulages that access these veins through six different spirals. 

Generally, upper and lower sections of the same spiral were connected only through 

ventilation/escape raises. All mineralized material produced is hauled out of the portal in trucks 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 15-8 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

to a temporary stockpile where it is loaded onto a surface haul truck, and delivered to the on-site 

mill. 

Mine development is controlled by geological conditions in the area. For the sublevel stoping 

method, sill development is driven  a minimum seven feet wide by eleven feet high to 

accommodate the size of long hole drills and 2-cubic yard (yd3) loaders. Where the vein 

thickness is wider than six feet, the sill width is increased to capture the entire vein. Sills are 

driven 500 feet north and south from the spiral cross cut. Once sills are developed, stoping 

begins. Stopes are drilled with a long hole drill from the floor of one level to the back of the one 

below, then remote mucked from the bottom level, and finally backfilled from the top level. 

Typically, the mineralized material was divided into blocks of about four levels for development, 

or 200 feet vertically. Stoping begins by creating a cemented backfill barrier pillar at the bottom 

level of the mineralized material block by benching eight feet below the level horizon. The bench 

is then filled with 6% by volume cemented rock fill (CRF). The first stope has a drop raise 

drilled nearest to the mining face. Subsequent holes are blasted one at a time into the free face 

created by the drop raise to a standard panel length of 60 feet. 

Once empty, the stope is filled with dry unconsolidated waste backfill ("GOB") until it reaches 

ten feet above the brow of the bottom cut. Next, a pillar of 2% by volume CRF is placed into the 

stope until it reaches within ten feet of the top cut (the drilling level). Next, the remainder of the 

open stope is filled with GOB. Finally, before the next stope is drilled, the toe of dry GOB is 

removed to reveal a free face that the next stope will be blasted into, eliminating the need to drill 

another drop raise. Rather, a fan pattern is drilled in the initial portion if the stope design to 

initiate extraction, followed by the same one-hole-at-a-time drill pattern for the remainder of the 

panel. The final or intersection panel of every level is filled completely with 6% CRF (Figure 

15-6). 

This sequence continues inward toward the intersection of the spiral access and upward to the 

top of the stope block in an advancing V pattern until all but the top level of the block is mined 

and backfilled. The long hole drill then drills up-holes from the top level upward to within six 

feet of the backfilled bench above. These up-hole stopes are not backfilled, and it is vital to the 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 15-9

mining sequence that the mining block above is completed and backfilled prior to mining the up-

hole stopes on the last level of the stope block. 

Figure 15-6 Sublevel Stoping Mining Sequence. 

 

15.5.2 Shrink Stoping 

Shrinkage stoping costs are 25 – 50% higher than sublevel stoping. Shrinkage stoping requires 

moderately competent wall rock and can adapt quickly to variations in the vein geometry. The 

disadvantage of shrink stoping is that 2/3 of the mineralization mined must remain in the stope 

until it is completely blasted. The advantage is that it requires significantly less waste 

development since a ramp is not required to span the vertical extent of the mineralization. A 

shrinkage stope can extend up to 300 feet along strike in each direction from a central access 

raise. A typical shrinkage stoping arrangement is shown in Figure 15-7. 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 15-10 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

Figure 15-7 Typical shrinkage stope long section (top) and plan (bottom) 

 

Shrinkage stoping is initiated by excavating a parallel waste access drift at the bottom of the 

stope with cross cuts to the vein to serve as draw points. The draw points are spaced at intervals 

of 20 to 25 feet along the full length of the stope. One or two raises are mined and timbered to 

provide access for personnel and materials. Drilling and blasting is carried by breasting down 

from the raise to the stope limits. The volume of mined material will swell up to 50% after 

blasting and it is this fact that makes shrinkage stoping possible. Following the blast, a volume of 

mined material equal to the swell volume will be withdrawn from the draw points immediately 

below the blast leaving the original mined volume in the stope to provide a working surface and 

support the stope walls. Once blasting has reached the upper limit of the stope, the mined 

material remaining can be removed from the draw points leaving the stope empty. The final void 

will be left open. 

15.6 Ground Control and Dilution 

During either waste or ore development, ground control is a major part of the mining sequence. 

The face miners bar down loose rock immediately after a blast and install wire mesh and split-set 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 15-11 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

bolts after every round in every heading. Some of the upper zones contain high clay content and 

low rock mass rating (RMR), which requires installation of Swellex bolts. 

Dilution in the stopes is generally controlled by the drill pattern but is also affected by the 

jointing of the wall rock immediately adjacent to the stope. Figure 15-8 shows an ideal open 

stope with minimal dilution. When jointing and/or weak wall rock is present, the wall of the 

stope breaks into an hourglass shape and increases dilution. 

In areas where poor rock conditions are anticipated, prior to stoping, engineering issues a design 

to install cable bolts into the hanging wall of the stope. In cases of rock instability, the panel 

length is also reduced from 60 feet to 30 feet to increase wall stability and decrease the length of 

time a stope sits open before being back filled. In general, dilution in the long hole stopes is well 

controlled even in weak ground by adjusting drill patterns, installing cable bolts, and reducing 

panel length when necessary.

15.7 Other Narrow Vein Mining Methods 

The East Veins are modeled to be mined more narrowly than the Main Veins and have lower 

gold grades than the Main Veins. Newmont tested alternative mining methods within selected 

areas of the Main Veins that showed similar thicknesses in an effort to reduce dilution while 

holding down overall costs. 

An area in Spiral 2 on the 405 vein was chosen by Newmont to test resue mining.  Resuing 

begins the same way as the previously described sublevel stoping method, with seven feet wide 

by eleven feet high bottom cut developed along the lowest stope level. Next, only the vein 

material is breasted down with as little dilution as possible and mucked out of the bottom cut. 

Finally, the breast-down is widened seven feet by blasting the remaining waste rock into the 

existing bottom cut.  The waste is left as unconsolidated fill. The entire breast-down is then 

supported, and the sequence repeated upward (Figure 15-9).

Another area on the 305 vein between Spirals 4 and 5 was chosen for an Alimak stope.  A raise 

contractor was hired to develop and timber two Alimak raises. This overhand cut-and-fill method 

allows the stope to be mined one cut at a time at a width of about four feet. The ore is slushed to 

one of the two raises, mucked from the bottom, and the completed cut is backfilled from the top 

of the raise with an expanding cellular fill that can be pumped in through a hose. 

Ultimately, Newmont abandoned both of these techniques and designed the East veins as 

sublevel stopes, keeping in the mine plan only the areas that could be profitably mined by 

sublevel stoping methods. 

Currently, waste development is complete for Spiral 7 that accesses the 905 and 9052 veins, and 

stope development has been initiated on multiple levels in Spiral 7. Spiral 8 has top and bottom 

level accesses but minimal ore development. Spiral 8 accesses four East veins: the 905, 9052, 

805 and 1081. 

15.8 Klondex Mine Plan 

The future mining plan at Midas will be a combination of sublevel stopes in some areas and 

shrinkage stopes in others. A steady stream of mined mineralization will likely be coming from 

the long hole stopes in Spiral 7 and upper Spiral 8 while the shrinkage stopes are mined. Klondex 

plans to recover the remaining mineralized material from the Alimak stope that Newmont 

developed and possibly complete the Resue mining where the waste development is already in 

place. In Spiral 7 on the 905 vein (Figure 15-10), the majority of stope development is already in 

place for sublevel stopes. As a result, those stopes fit well in the production schedule for 2014 

through 2015. In Spiral 8, there is minimal waste development remaining, and stope 

development has been initiated for the upper half of the mineralization in that area which is 

favorable for sublevel stoping (Figure 15-11).

Minimal waste development and no ore development occurred from the lower access of Spiral 8. 

This lack of development favors the use of shrinkage stoping techniques on the three veins that

extend to that level. There is also potential to shrink stope the 9052 vein in Spiral 7 (Figure 

15-12) 

Figure 15-12 Spiral 7 Vein 9052 Planned Shrinkage Stoping (Looking East) 

 

Figure 15-13 Alimak Development with Ore in Place (Looking West) 

 

Two more areas exist that Newmont planned to mine by long hole methods. On the 105 and 205 

veins at the top of Spiral 4, sublevels at 36 feet were driven prior to stoping. The ground is weak 

in that area so Klondex could mine those stopes using drift and fill methods with six feet wide by

eight feet high cuts with attack ramps driven in waste and each cut backfilled to maintain 

integrity (Figure 15-14). Also, at the top of Spiral 6 on the 205 vein, there are two levels driven 

on the 205 vein, and Klondex could likely mine those as 30 feet long hole panels (Figure 15-15).

16 Recovery Methods 
The Midas Mill was constructed in 1997 and has a nameplate capacity of 1,200 tpd. The mill 

uses conventional leach technology with Counter Current Decantation followed by Merrill 

Crowe precipitation. Refining of doré is carried out by Johnson Matthey refineries in Salt Lake 

City, Utah. Toll milling has been performed periodically since 2008. 

16.1 Mill Capacity and Process Facility Flow Diagram 

Underground mineralized material is hauled from the Midas underground mine portal to the run 

of mine (ROM) pad where it is either directly loaded to the 60 ton primary crusher ROM bin, or 

placed on short term ROM mineralized material stockpiles. Typical mineralized material 

classifications are: low grade (less than [<] 0.3 ounces per short ton [oz/st]); high grade (0.3-0.5 

oz/st); and high-high grade (> 0.5 oz/st). Underground mineralized material is hand-picked on 

the pad for scrap wire mesh and rock bolts before being fed to the crusher. 

Mineralized material is crushed in two stages through a 30 inch x 40 inch primary jaw crusher 

and 53 inch secondary cone crusher. Both jaw and secondary crusher products are fed to a 6 feet 

x 20 feet Nordberg double deck vibrating screen fitted with 2 inch top deck and one-half inch 

bottom deck screen panels to produce a 95% passing three-eighths inch product. Magnetic 

material is removed from the crusher screen feed by a continuous belt self-cleaning magnet to 

protect the cone crusher from damage. Screen undersize is conveyed to one of two 500-ton fine 

mineralized material bins. 

Crushed and screened material is transported from the fine material bins by individual belt 

feeders into the 10.5 feet x 15 feet rubber lined Nordberg ball mill. The ball mill is charged with 

a blend of 3 inch and 2.5 inch grinding balls to maintain an operating power draw of 800 horse 

power (HP). Mill discharge pulp is pumped to a nest of 4 inch x 10 inch Krebs cyclones (3 duty, 

1 standby) for classification. Cyclone overflow, at 75% passing 200 mesh, reports to the trash 

screen. Cyclone underflow reports to a 2 millimetres (mm) aperture scalping screen, with the 

screen undersize being distributed by 3-way splitter to the ball mill, tower mill, and gravity 

circuit. Lead nitrate solution is added to the ball mill feed chute to enhance gold leach kinetics.

A split of the screened cyclone underflow reports to the 250 HP Vertimill for open circuit 

grinding with the Vertimill discharge overflowing back to the primary ball mill discharge 

hopper. The Vertimill is charged with 1 inch grinding balls. A split of the screened cyclone 

overflow also reports to the 20 inch Knelson concentrator for gravity gold recovery. The Knelson 

operates on a 60 minute cycle providing concentrate for cyanidation in the CS500 Acacia Leach 

Reactor which conducts three 750-1000 kilogram (kg) batch leaches each week. Pregnant 

solution (batch containing 100 oz on average) from the leach reactor reports to the Counter 

Current decantation (CCD) circuit pregnant solution tank.

Cyclone overflow is screened to remove any plastic debris before reporting to a 42 feet diameter 

pre-leach thickener. Thickener underflow at 50% solids is pumped to the leach circuit consisting 

of eight  28 feet x 30 feet air sparged leach tanks, providing a leach residence time of 

approximately 65 hours. The pH in the first leach tank is maintained at 10.4 to 11.0 through the 

addition of hydrated lime, produced from the on-site slaking of pebble lime. Sodium cyanide 

concentration in the second leach tank is maintained at 0.85 grams per liter (gpl). 

The leach circuit discharge is pumped to five 42.5 feet diameter CCD thickeners, where the pulp 

is counter-current washed with barren Merrill Crowe liquor at a wash ratio of approximately 

2.5:1, and CCD thickener underflow at each stage is maintained at 50-56% solids to maximize 

wash efficiency. 

Pregnant CCD solution at a pH of 11.0 and 400 gallons/minute flow rate is fed to one of two disc 

filters operating in duty/standby mode utilizing diatomaceous earth for clarification. The clarified 

pregnant solution is then pumped to a packed bed vacuum de-aeration tower, prior to the addition 

of zinc dust and lead nitrate to precipitate precious metals from solution. The Merrill Crowe 

precipitate solution is then pumped to one of two plate and frame filter presses for sludge 

recovery ahead of smelting on site to produce 8 inch x 30 inch 350 pound silver/gold doré bars. 

Tailings pulp from the last CCD thickener is pumped to the Inco SO2/Air circuit for cyanide 

destruction. Cyanide destruction is performed in a single 20 feet x 20 feet agitated, air sparged 

tank providing approximately one-hour reaction time. Ammonium bi-sulphite and copper 

sulphate catalyst are added to the tank on a ratio control basis to achieve target weak acid 

dissociable (WAD) cyanide levels below 5 ppm. Routine picric acid titrations coupled with 

colorimetric determinations are used by operating personnel to maintain WAD cyanide in the 

INCO cyanide destruction tank discharge pulp at target levels. 

Following cyanide destruction, the plant tailings pulp is discharged to one of two lined tailings 

storage facilities for consolidation and water recovery. Clarified decant pond solution is 

evaporated or returned to the mill process water tank for reuse in the plant.

16.3 Operation and Recoveries 

Midas mineralization performs quite well under direct cyanidation with daily recoveries as high 

as 95.1% for gold and up to 89.8% for silver. The process performance is consistent with gold 

recovery having a standard deviation of less than two percent. Variances in gold recovery are due 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 16-8 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

to the head grade and grind size, and do not appear to be associated with ore type. The standard 

deviation of silver recovery is less than four percent with variance due to head grade, grind size, 

and clay content. Clay enriched mineralization often has higher silver to gold ratios and tend to 

present recovery difficulties. Recoveries occasionally fall outside the expected distribution 

because of plant or operating issues. The current grind is 85 percent passing through 200 mesh. 

The feasibility of producing a finer grind product to improve gold and silver recovery is 

currently under analysis by Klondex. 

16.4 Tailings Capacity 

Newmont has evaluated the potential of a tailings expansion project. Currently, the remaining 

capacity in the Midas Phase 4/5 tailings is estimated to be 930,000 tons. Two alternatives are 

available for increasing tails capacity. The first would raise the existing embankment 

approximately ten feet and add rib rap embankment protection. This option would add 

approximately 400,000 tons capacity and is estimated to cost $5M. This option has the advantage 

of staying inside the existing TSF footprint and can be permitted with a minor modification to 

the existing plan of operation.   

The second option would involve new construction outside the existing TSF footprint. Permit 

modifications would likely take eighteen to twenty-four months to secure. New tailings 

construction could be completed by early 2017. The estimated capital cost for this project 

includes $5M for a new 1 million ton capacity facility, plus $2.4M for permitting, liner, power, 

etc.  

The 2012 performance of the tailings facility included evaporation of over 90M gallons of water 

utilizing 10 evaporator units. The effective run time is ten hours per day during the peak 

evaporation season. 

During 2013, upgrades to the tailings facility included  increasing the number of automated 

evaporators to fifteen, and installing Wonder-ware software that ties the evaporation system with 

weather information including wind speed, temperature and humidity. The improved system can 

operate twenty-four hours for seven days per week.

16.5 Processing Costs 

Midas Mill operating costs for 2012 and January 1 to October 31, 2013 are summarized in Table 

16-2 

Table 16-2 Processing Costs. 
Midas Milling Cash Costs (tonnage basis)       
  
Year 

$/ton Total Tonnage 
Budget  Actual Variance Budget Actual Variance 

2012 $33.12 $35.02 $1.90 373,000 330,000 -43,000 
2013 YTD (Oct) $35.49 $39.05 $3.56 255,600 207,600 -48,000 

The elevated cost per ton for 2013 is likely the result of the inflexibility of fixed costs versus 

diminished throughput. If the total cash costs are divided by the budgeted tonnage, the average 

cash cost per ton would be US$32 per ton, which is more in line with the projected costs. 

16.6 Product 

In 2012, Midas sold 103,000 ounces of gold and 1,475,000 ounces of silver. Through October 

2013, Midas has sold 48,920 ounces of gold and 1,117,000 ounces of silver. Doré is shipped to 

the refinery as 350 lb. bars that average approximately 3.94% gold and 90.1% silver plus minor 

constituents, including less than 4% selenium. 

16.7 Processing Operating Permits 

The Midas Processing Facility is currently operating under three Air Quality Operating Permits 

administered by the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Air Pollution 

Control and one Water Pollution Control Permit administered by the Nevada Department of 

Environmental Protection (NDEP) Bureau of Water pollution Control. The permits are discussed 

in detail in Section 19.

18.3 Project Financing 

On December 4, 2013, the Corporation entered into a stock purchase agreement with its wholly-

owned subsidiary, Klondex Holdings (USA) Inc., and Newmont USA Limited ("Newmont 

USA") to acquire all of the shares of Newmont Midas Holdings Limited (the "Midas 

Acquisition"), which indirectly owns the Midas Project. The Midas Acquisition was completed 

on February 11, 2014. The purchase price of the Midas Acquisition was comprised of (i) 

approximately US$55 million in cash, (ii) the replacement of Newmont surety arrangements with 

Nevada and federal regulatory authorities in the amount of approximately US$28 million, and 

(iii) the issuance by the Corporation to Newmont USA of 5 million warrants to purchase 

Common Shares at an exercise price of $2.15, with a 15-year term, subject to acceleration in 

certain circumstances. 

The Midas Acquisition was financed through the Subscription Receipt Financing (as defined 

below), the 2014 Debt Financing (as hereinafter defined) and the Gold Purchase Arrangement (as 

hereinafter defined). 

On January 9, 2014, the Corporation completed an offering (the "Subscription Receipt 

Financing") of 29,400,000 subscription receipts at a price of $1.45 per subscription receipt on a 

private placement basis, raising aggregate gross proceeds of $42,630,000 (the "SR Proceeds") 

pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement dated December 6, 2013 between the Corporation 

and GMP Securities L.P., MGI Securities Inc., Mackie Research Capital Corporation, M Partners 

Inc., Jones, Gable & Company Limited and PI Financial Corp. (collectively, the "SR Agents"). 

The SR Proceeds, less the SR Agents' expenses and out-of-pocket costs and legal expenses, were 

placed in escrow pending (i) the closing of the Midas Acquisition, and (ii) the receipt by the 

Corporation of the requisite shareholder approval of the Subscription Receipt Financing and the 

2014 Debt Financing (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to the requirements of the Toronto Stock 

Exchange ("TSX"). Upon both of these conditions being satisfied, on February 11, 2014, the net 

proceeds of the Subscription Receipt Financing were paid out of the escrowed funds to the 

Corporation. 

On February 11, 2014, the Corporation entered into a senior secured loan facility agreement (the 

"Facility Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders led by Royal Capital Management Corp., and 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 18-3 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

including K2 and Jones Gable pursuant to which the Corporation issued units consisting of an 

aggregate of $25,000,000 principal amount of notes, issued at a 2.5% discount to par value, and 

3,100,000 warrants ("2014 Lender Warrants") to purchase Common Shares (the "2014 Debt 

Financing"). The 2014 Lender Warrants have an exercise price of $1.95 and will expire on 

February 11, 2017. The notes mature on August 11, 2017. 

On February 11, 2014, the Corporation entered into a gold purchase agreement (the "Gold 

Purchase Agreement") with Franco-Nevada GLW Holdings Corp., a subsidiary of Franco-

Nevada Corporation ("FNC"), pursuant to which the Corporation raised proceeds of 

US$33,763,640 (the "Gold Purchase Arrangement") in consideration for the delivery of an 

aggregate of 38,250 ounces of gold on a monthly basis over a five year period ending on 

December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the Gold Purchase Agreement, the Corporation is 

required to make gold deliveries at the end of each month, with the first delivery due on June 30, 

2014. Gold deliveries will cease when the delivery of 38,250 ounces of gold is completed on 

December 31, 2018. The annualized delivery schedule is shown in Table 18-1. 

Table 18-1 FNC Gold Delivery Schedule 
Year Gold Ounces

2014 6,750
2015 7,500
2016 8,000
2017 8,000
2018 8,000
Total 38,250

 

The Corporation's obligations under each of the 2014 Debt Financing and the Gold Purchase 

Arrangement are secured against all of the assets and property of the Corporation and its 

subsidiaries. The security granted for the performance of the Corporation's obligations under the 

2014 Debt Financing and the Gold Purchase Arrangement rank pari-passu. 

The Facility Agreement contains customary events of default and covenants for a transaction of 

its nature, including limitations on future indebtedness during its term. Early repayment of the 

loan under the Facility Agreement by the Corporation is required under an event of default under 

the Facility Agreement, including in the event that the Corporation has failed to pay within three 

business days of being due any principal or interest totaling $250,000 or more on any 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 18-4 
Technical Report for the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 

indebtedness of the Corporation other than the indebtedness under the Facility Agreement. In 

addition, the Corporation may not incur indebtedness where, on the date of such incurrence, and 

after giving effect thereto and the application of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Adjusted 

EBITDA (as defined in the Facility Agreement) of the Corporation and its subsidiaries divided 

by the sum of the consolidated debt expense (net of consolidated interest income) of the 

Corporation and its subsidiaries would be less than 3.5.  

The Gold Purchase Agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants for a 

transaction of its nature. A default under the Facility Agreement would also constitute a default 

under the Gold Purchase Agreement. As at the date hereof, the Corporation is in compliance with 

all requirements under the Facility Agreement and the Gold Purchase Agreement. 

On February 12, 2014, the Corporation entered into a royalty agreement (the "FC Royalty 

Agreement") with Franco-Nevada U.S. Corporation ("Franco-Nevada US"), a subsidiary of FNC, 

and KGS, pursuant to which Klondex Gold & Siler Mining Company raised proceeds of 

US$1,018,050 from the grant to Franco-Nevada US of a 2.5% NSR royalty on the Fire Creek 

Project. The Corporation also entered into a royalty agreement (the "Midas Royalty Agreement") 

with Franco-Nevada US and Newmont Midas Operations Inc. ("Midas Operations"), now an 

indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, pursuant to which Midas Operations raised 

proceeds of US$218,310 from the grant of a 2.5% NSR royalty to Franco-Nevada US on the 

Midas Mine.

19 Environmental Liabilities, Permits, and 
Social Impact 

The impact of new environmental regulations may cause additional expenses and restrictions. If 

the restrictions adversely affect the scope of exploration and development on the Midas property, 

the potential for production on the property may be affected. 

The Midas Mine is subject to the laws and regulations relating to environmental matters in all 

jurisdictions in which it operates, including provisions relating to property reclamation, 

discharge of hazardous material and other matters. The mine may also be held liable should 

environmental problems be discovered that were caused by former owners and operators of its 

properties and properties in which it has previously had an interest. Mineral exploration and 

mining operations are conducted in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. The 

qualified professionals are not aware of any existing environmental liabilities. 

19.1 Environmental Management Activities 

Ongoing environmental management issues at Midas include regulatory reporting on: 

Water Pollution Control Reports; 
Air Quality, Water Rights, and Reclamation Reports; 
Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Reports; and 
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Reports. 

Additionally, reclamation financial assurances require reporting on: 

Annual Corporate Guarantee Review and Approval; and 
Triennial Reclamation Cost Estimate Update; 

Other environmental management obligations include: 

Permit Renewals/Modifications; 
Reclamation and Final Permanent Closure Plan; 
Cultural Resources Mitigation Actions (Exploration); 
Greater Sage-grouse Mitigation Actions; and 
Regulatory Inspections.

19.1.1 Waste Rock Dump Description and Management 

The waste rock dump at Midas is located downhill and to the south-east of the portal. Primary 

waste rocks lithologies are tuff, rhyolite, and basalt. The current dump design covers eleven 

acres of disturbance on private property. Maximum storage capacity is approximately 1.4 million 

tons. As of November 2013, the dump contains approximately 990,000 tons, according to 

Newmont survey personnel. 

Waste rock at Midas is used as fill in the underground openings. During phases of increased 

development, the dump inventory increases, and when the mine development level is 

normalized, the inventory decreases. 

During waste rock placement, composite samples of felsic and mafic rock lithologies are taken 

on a daily basis. In compliance with the Water Pollution Control Permit, the sample analysis is 

reported on a quarterly basis. The Meteoric Water Mobility Procedure (MWMP) Profile I is 

reported to the Bureau of Water Pollution Control (BWPC), which measures thirty-one 

constituents and properties of the waste related solutions. The potential for the waste rock dump 

to generate acid is also calculated and reported. Lime is added during quarterly monitoring if the 

Acid Neutralization Potential (ANP) to Acid Generation Potential (GNP) ratio is less than 1.0. 

During 2012 and 2013, no constituent's average value taken from the waste rock dump was 

outside of the acceptable profile standard (reported from Quarter 4, 2011 through Quarter 3, 

2013). During the same period, 627,000 tons of felsic and 74,400 tons of mafic rock were placed 

on the dump. The average ANP to AGP readings for that time were a ratio of 2.3. Additionally, 

Monitoring Well-9, in the drainage below the dump, is sampled on the same period and protocol. 

Waste rock is routinely reclaimed from the dump and placed in underground stopes. It is 

anticipated that, during the latter stages of mining, stope fill requirements will allow a much 

higher rate of waste rock re-placement diminishing the volume of the surface dump. 

The Midas Revised Three Year Reclamation Plan was approved by the BMRR in October 2012. 

The plan states on Page 23:

"All of the mine waste rock that is stored on the temporary waste rock facility will be removed 

from this area and backfilled into the decline. Once the rock is removed, the topography in this 

area will approximate the original contour. Reclamation will consist of the placement of 0.5 feet 

of cover and 0.5 feet of growth media and seeding." (US Department of the Interior (DOI) 

Bureau of Land Managment (BLM), 2013) 

Topsoil for the waste rock facility is stored immediately downhill from the Midas mine facility. 

When the reclamation plan is complete, the potential for future waste rock acid drainage will be 

mitigated. 

19.1.2 Tailings Impoundment Description and Management 

Midas Mine's process Tailings Impoundment is located on the west flank of a wide canyon on 

the southern periphery of the active mine site. The tailings coverage entails ninety-five acres of 

disturbance on private property. The embankment has undergone four permitted lifts to expand 

capacity since its original construction. The current lift is known as "Phase 5". The Phase 5 lift 

was designed by the engineering firm, Smith Williams Consultants, Inc., and is permitted with 

Dam Safety Permit J-555 by the Nevada Department of Water Resources. The current 

cumulative capacity of the pond is 3.70 million tons, of which approximately 930,000 tons are 

still available. 

The Tailings Impoundment is a synthetic lined pond with 2:1 slope ratio on the internal walls and 

3:1 slope ratio on the external walls comprised of compacted earth and rock buttress 

construction. The dam has a maximum permitted vertical lift (Phase Six – which has not yet been 

built) of two hundred feet on the external, downslope side. The pond contains approximately 

2,750,000 tons of detoxified cyanide tails ground to 80% passing a 200 mesh screen. Tailings 

placement occurs simultaneously with process water decantation and active evaporation within 

the margins of the pond. 

The cumulative, drained process tailings are subjected to downward migrating water. There is 

potential for this water to escape the lined tailings storage facility. Furthermore, meteoric waters 

in the alluvium outside the pond host potential to leach chemicals from the tailings through the 

outer walls of the tailing dam and then enter the drainage at the toe of the dam. The possible 

occurrences of seepage are monitored by quarterly sampling from 10 monitoring wells, nine of

which are down-gradient of the storage facility and one up-gradient. Results from these samples 

are reported quarterly to BWPC, according to the Water Pollution Control permit and are 

governed by the MWMP Profile I protocol. 

Incidental seepage is not allowed to enter the Waters of the State by federal law. Any seepage 

solutions are captured in an underdrain pond and drainage wells prior to contamination of the 

regional hydrologic system. Fugitive water is pumped back into the tailings impoundment. 

The Midas Reclamation Plan provides for proper reclamation and closure of the Tailings Storage 

Facility. This plan includes a period of Process Fluid Stabilization followed by placement of an 

Evapo-Transpiration (ET) barrier, designed to force meteoric water to evaporate instead of 

infiltrating the pond. Seeding for vegetation follows ET placement. Water quality monitoring 

will continue for a period of five years and be reported on a quarterly basis. 

The Midas Revised Three Year Reclamation Plan was approved by the Bureau of Mining 

Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) in October 2012. When reclamation is completed, the 

potential for future seepage from the tailings storage impoundment will be mitigated. 

19.1.3 Air Emissions Control 

Air emission standards for Midas are defined in the BLM Environmental Assessment titled, 

"Midas Underground Support Facilities, Newmont Mining Corporation", issued in March, 2013. 

These emissions include diesel particulate and dust expelled from underground mining 

operations, fugitive dust from surface operations, road maintenance, crushing activities, and 

mercury emissions from refinery furnaces and mercury retorts. 

Newmont's current Midas operations are regulated by a number of Bureau of Air Pollution 

Control (BAPC) permits. Operations at Midas are permitted under Class II Air Quality Operating 

Permit AP1041-0766.02. A Title V application was submitted in January 2012, and the permit 

approval is currently pending BAPC review. Surface disturbance and fugitive emissions are 

regulated under three Class II Surface Area Disturbance Permits: AP1041-1444.01 (Borrow Pit), 

AP1041-1454.01 (Exploration), and AP1442-2674 (Jakes Creek Gravel Pit). 

Current mercury emissions are less than 5 pounds (lbs.) per year and are thus not regulated. To 

allow for potential increases in mercury emission, as is anticipated in processing custom ores at

Midas, Newmont has obtained a Nevada Mercury Control air permit from the BAPC and is 

currently operating in Phase 1 of this permit. 

The purpose of Phase 1 is to monitor and operate properly under existing mercury controls and to 

implement work practice standards on units without controls in order to minimize emissions until 

the appropriate technologies under the Nevada Maximum Achievable Control Technology 

(NvMACT) standards are determined. Phase 1 permits do not have emissions limits. At the 

existing Midas facility, Newmont is operating under Mercury OPTC: Phase 1, AP1041-2253 for 

a number of units. 

Beginning in 2014, Midas will operate under Phase 2, which specifies limits for emitting units. If 

the constraints in the permits are followed, Midas should not incur any liability with regard to 

Air Emissions. 

19.1.4 Reclamation cost and bonding 

Newmont's Midas budgeted reclamation costs (Table 19-1) and bond calculation (Table 19-3) 

are listed below. Klondex's position as a small operator does not allow them the option of 

corporate guarantee, and they will be required to bond the entire $27.3M total.

Klondex engaged SRK Consulting to review the reclamation bond adequacy, and SRK prepared 

the following estimate for reclamation of the Midas operations.  This estimate was prepared 

using 2013 labor and equipment rates approximating those of a third party contractor, and the 

Standardized Reclamation Cost Estimation tool (SCRE).  The SCRE is used to calculate bond 

obligations for the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Mining Regulation 

and Reclamation (NDEP-BMRR) and the BLM. (Martini 2014)

Technical Report on the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 
 

Air Quality; 

Midas is currently operating under two permits, the Class II operating permit AP1041-0766 and 

the Mercury Operating Permit AP1041-2253. The Class 1A Permit AP1041-2989 is currently a 

"permit to construct." This permit includes the mercury capture and mitigation process hardware 

which has not yet been installed. It is the intention of Newmont and the BAPC, that the Class II 

and Mercury permits will be rolled into the Class 1 Permit upon inspection an approval of the 

mercury circuit. The site will thus operate under only one Air Quality Operating Permit. 

Solid Waste; 

There is no landfill permit. Solid waste is removed from site and disposed of at Newmont's Twin 

Creeks Mine. 

Industrial Artificial Pond (IAP); 

Should ownership of the property be transferred, most of the permits and rights will transfer as 

well. The IAP Permit will be closed, and it must be obtained through a re-application process. 

Jakes Creek; 

The Jakes Creek ROW and SAD permits are held to access and maintain the Jakes Creek area 

and road. This is part of a county road maintenance agreement, mentioned in the following 

section. 

Water Pollution Control Permit (WPCP); 

The current site WPCP expired February 2013. Newmont filed an Application for Renewal more 

than 90 days before expiry in 2012. The permit renewal is under review by NDEP. It is 

permissible to operate under an expired permit, as long as the renewal was filed during the 

renewal application period. 

In conclusion, based on statements submitted to the authors by Newmont, there are currently no 

Noncompliance Orders or Notices of Violation issued relating to the Midas site. This sites status 

of good compliance has not been confirmed by the authors at the State or Federal level. 

19.3 Social Impact 

Midas Mine management incurs responsibility to address these issues: 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 19-10 
Technical Report on the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 
 

Road agreements with Elko County and Humboldt County related to drilling two wells on 

Humboldt County-owned land. The drilling would entail supporting dust suppression on the 

access road (from the "Y" to the mine entrance). The drilling was scheduled for Spring 2013 

(presently awaiting water rights transfer at State of Nevada from Humboldt County to 

Newmont). 

Additionally, Midas provides labor, materials, and equipment for maintenance of State Route 18. 

In 2012, a total of $285,000 was spent on the following areas of road maintenance: 

• Dust suppression; 
• Grading; 
• Routine repairs; 
• Maintenance of signage and cattle guards; 
• Snow removal; 

The Midas Operation also participates in community support of the following organizations: 

• Midas Fire Department: $2,500 for July 4 parade and first responder program; 
• Nevada Bighorns Unlimited: $3,500 for August fundraiser; and 
• Annual community picnic to provide update on mine operations (held in July).

20 Adjacent Properties 
Nearby properties to the Midas Property include the Pinson Gold Project Mine, Turquoise Ridge, 

Hollister Mine, the Fire Creek Project, and Mule Canyon. The authors of this Technical Report 

have not verified this information regarding the adjacent properties described herein. The 

information contained in this section of the Technical Report is not necessarily indicative of the 

mineralization at the Midas Project. 

20.1 Pinson Gold Project Mine 

The Pinson Mine is located near Winnemucca, in Humboldt County, Nevada, along one of the 

premier gold trends in northern Nevada called the Getchell Gold Belt, which is not within the 

NNR. The mine is in the south-central portion of the Getchell Gold Belt southwest of Barrick's 

Turquoise Ridge Mines and Newmont's Twin Creeks Mine. Gold mineralization along this trend 

is characterized as a Carlin-type disseminated gold hosted in Ordovician sedimentary rocks. The 

mineralogy and host rocks are different than the deposits in the NNR, which are epithermal vein 

hosted deposits hosted in mafic basalts. 

The Pinson mine produced 985,000 ounces of gold from 1980 through 1999 by open pit mining 

and has seen over US$100 million in exploration and development spending on the property 

since 1998, (Crowl, 2011). These expenditures include over US$10 million by Pinson Mining 

Company ("PMC"), a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, from 1998 through 2001. In 2004, 

Atna entered into an agreement to earn a 70 percent interest in the Pinson property. A total of 

US$14 million was spent by Atna from 2004 through 2006 to earn its 70 percent interest. In 

2006, PMC exercised a claw-back right and subsequently spent US $ 36 million to earn a 70 

percent interest in the property, with Atna's interest reducing to 30 percent. In August 2011, Atna 

acquired PMC's 70 percent interest in the four square miles of land (2,480 acres) containing all 

areas of past gold production and the area containing the currently estimated mineral resources 

(Crowl, 2011). 

Atna commenced underground mine development in early 2012, and mine ramp-up began in late 

2012 with increasing development and production output through this period. At the end of June 

2013, the mine was placed on care and maintenance status until such time that a revised mine 

plan has been developed and additional financing can be arranged.

Technical Report on the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 
 

20.2 Turquoise Ridge 

The Turquoise Ridge property is also located in the Getchell Gold Belt, about 70 kilometers 

northeast of Winnemucca, Nevada, on the eastern flank of the Osgood Mountains. The 

mineralization is Carlin-type disseminated gold hosted in Ordovician sedimentary rocks, as are 

the Pinson Mine and Twin Creeks Mine. The mines in the Getchell Gold Belt are not within the 

NNR. Barrick is the operator and 75% owner of the mine with Newmont owning the remaining 

25%. 

Turquoise Ridge uses underhand cut-and-fill mining methods, and ore is transported to 

Newmont's Twin Creeks mill for processing. The refractory gold ore is treated by pressure 

oxidation technology, and gold is recovered using conventional carbon-in-leach technology. 

(Infomine 2014) 

20.3 Hollister Mine 

Waterton Global Mining Company's Hollister mine is in Elko County approximately 20 miles 

south east from the Midas Mine. Once considered to be one of the highest grade gold deposits in 

the world, the Hollister gold mine is located in northern Nevada, at the intersection of the Carlin 

Trend and the Northern Nevada Rift. The Carlin trend is one of the world's richest gold mining 

districts and the most prolific gold mining region in North America. 

The Hollister gold mine has been in production since 2008. The mine has had a historic 

production rate of 350 to 400 ore tons per day, producing an average of 80,000 oz of gold per 

year, (source: Business Wire, 2013). 

20.4 Fire Creek 

Fire Creek is located in Lander County in north-central Nevada about 16 miles south of Interstate 

highway I-80. The mineralization at Fire Creek is a shallow, low-sulfidation, vertically-zoned, 

epithermal gold-silver system. The mineralization occurs in two habits: disseminated gold in 

argillically altered tertiary basalt; and as clots, stringers, and visible gold in steeply dipping 

epithermal quartz-calcite veins. The basalt flows and intrusions are sub-horizontal and are cross-

cut by high-angle normal faults forming regional grabens. These structures trend parallel to the 

north-northwest striking NNR. High-grade gold mineralization occurs within veins and is 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 20-3 
Technical Report on the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 
 

disseminated in the basalt near vertical structures within the boiling zone horizon of an 

epithermal system. 

A high-grade bonanza gold horizon occurs at approximately 300 feet to about 600 feet below the 

surface, with mineralization occurring from the surface and open at depth. Vein textures, gangue 

minerals, and alteration at Fire Creek are classic epithermal phenomena. (Odell, 2013). 

20.5 Mule Canyon 

Mule Canyon is located 55 miles south of Midas along the Northern Nevada Rift. Similar to 

Midas, the Mule Canyon gold deposit is a shallow, low-sulfidation, epithermal Au-Ag deposit 

that occurs near the west side of the NNR. As of December 1996, the Mule Canyon deposit 

consisted of six small deposits that contained pre-mining reserves of about 8.2 million tons at an 

average grade of 3.81 gpt, (John, 2003). The mine is a past producer and is currently idled. 

The mineralization at Mule Canyon is an uncommon mafic end member of low-sulfidation Au-

Ag deposits associated with tholeiitic bimodal basalt-rhyolite magmatism, common to rift system 

environments. The mineralized material at Mule Canyon is hosted by a basalt-andesite eruptive 

center that formed between about 16.4 to 15.8 Ma during early mafic eruptions related to 

regionally extensive bimodal magmatism and rifting. Hydrothermal alteration and Au-Ag 

mineralization formed at about 15.6 Ma and were tightly controlled by north-northwest- to north-

striking high-angle fault and breccia zones developed during rifting, emplacement of mafic 

dikes, and eruption of mafic lava flows, (John, 2003).

21 Other Relevant Data and Information 
The Midas Mine and Mill have been in continuous operation since 1998 producing over 

2,000,000 ounces of gold during this period. The authors are not aware of any other relevant data 

and information having bearing on the Midas mineral resource or ongoing exploration and 

mining operations.

22 Interpretations and Conclusions 
22.1 Conclusions 

The Midas mine is a modern, mechanized narrow vein mine.  Sufficient capital has not been 

allocated to near mine exploration to replenish reserves and resources depleted through mining.  

There are several exploration targets in the immediate area and within the mine's land position.  

As a result, underground mining rates will decline resulting in excess milling capacity in the near 

term. 

Significant mineral resources have been identified on the 205 and 305 veins. The remaining 

Main Veins were not evaluated as part of this report and may also contain significant un-mined 

resources. 

The conventional Merrill Crow mill facility is an efficient well maintained modern mineral 

processing plant capable of processing 1,200 tpd.  The plant is capable of operating with a 

minimum crew compliment resulting in cost reductions when operated at capacity.  Expected 

mine production of 300 tpd in the next two to three years will allow mill feed to be supplemented 

from Klondex's nearby properties and third party toll milling. 

The Midas Tailings Facility Storage (TSF) is nearing design capacity and has approximately 

930,000 tons of capacity remaining. A significant percentage of the remaining capacity is 

displaced by the excess water volume generated from mine dewatering and stored in the TSF. 

The current water inventory in the Midas TSF is approximately 150 million gallons. Midas has 

installed 15 evaporator units with an annual evaporating capacity of 100 million gallons.  Mine 

dewatering contributes 25 million gallons annually and precipitation another 8 – 10 million 

gallons. Diverting and treating the mine water from the tailings dam and using it for process 

makeup water will greatly enhance the water management scheme and allow filling the TSF to 

design capacity. 

Newmont has designed the Phase VII expansion to the existing TSF.  This will raise the existing 

dam and add 400,000 tons of capacity.  Due to the height of the existing dam and the need to add 

rip rap for embankment protection, the cost of this expansion is estimated at $5M, or $12.50 / ton 



Klondex Mines Ltd. 22-2 
Technical Report on the Midas Mine and Mill, Elko County, Nevada  
 

Practical Mining LLC March 31, 2014 
 
 

of material processed.  Effective water management and aggressively pursuing an alternative 

tailings location can eliminate the need for the Phase VII expansion. 

Construction of a new TSF would require 18 – 24 months to permit before construction could 

begin in 2016.  This could add 1 million tons of storage at a cost of $7.4M. 

22.2 Project Risks 

Table 22-1 presents the significant risks identified by the Qualified Person that have potential to 

impact the Midas Mine. The probability of any of these risks occurring has not been determined, 

nor has the extent of any impact on the precious metal production.

25 Glossary 
Assay: The chemical analysis of mineral samples to determine the metal content. 

Asbuilt: (plural asbuilts), a field survey, construction drawing, 3D model, or other 
descriptive representation of an engineered design for underground workings. 

Composite: Combining more than one sample result to give an average result over a larger 
distance.   

Concentrate: A metal-rich product resulting from a mineral enrichment process such as gravity 
concentration or flotation, in which most of the desired mineral has been 
separated from the waste material in the ore.   

Crushing: Initial process of reducing material size to render it more amenable for further 
processing. 

Cut-off Grade (CoG): The grade of mineralized rock, which determines as to whether or not it is 
economic to recover its gold content by further concentration.   

Dilution: Waste, which is unavoidably mined with ore.   

Dip: Angle of inclination of a geological feature/rock from the horizontal.   

Fault: The surface of a fracture along which movement has occurred.   

Footwall: The underlying side of a mineralized body or stope.   

Gangue: Non-valuable components of the ore.   

Grade: The measure of concentration of valuable minerals within mineralized rock.   

Hanging wall: The overlying side of a mineralized body or stope.   

Haulage: A horizontal underground excavation which is used to transport mined rock.   

Igneous: Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma.   

Kriging: A weighted, moving average interpolation method in which the set of weights 
assigned to samples minimizes the estimation variance. 

Level: A main underground roadway or passage driven along a level course to afford 
access to stopes or workings and to provide ventilation and a haulage way for the 
removal of broken rock.    

Lithological: Geological description pertaining to different rock types.   

Milling: A general term used to describe the process in which the ore is crushed, ground 
and subjected to physical or chemical treatment to extract the valuable minerals 
in a concentrate or finished product.   

Mineral/Mining Lease:  A lease area for which mineral rights are held.   

Mining Assets: The Material Properties and Significant Exploration Properties.   

Sedimentary: Pertaining to rocks formed by the accumulation of sediments, formed by the 
erosion of other rocks.   

Sill1: A thin, tabular, horizontal to sub-horizontal body of igneous rock formed by the 
injection of magma into planar zones of weakness.   

Sill2: The floor of a mine passage way.

Stope: An underground excavation from which ore has been removed. 

Stratigraphy: The study of stratified rocks in terms of time and space.   

Strike: Direction of line formed by the intersection of strata surfaces with the horizontal 
plane, always perpendicular to the dip direction.   

Sulfide: A sulfur bearing mineral.   

Tailings: Finely ground waste rock from which valuable minerals or metals have been 
extracted.   

Thickening: The process of concentrating solid particles in suspension.   

Total Expenditure: All expenditures including those of an operating and capital nature.   

Variogram: A plot of the variance of paired sample measurements as a function of distance 
and/or direction. 

 
 
Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources have been classified according to the "CIM Standards on Mineral 

Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (2010) which are recognized by NI 43-

101. Accordingly, the mineral resources in this Technical Report have been classified as 

Measured, Indicated or Inferred. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 

material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, 

and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 

quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 

geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 

interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 

or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 

reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 

limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 

as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 

sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support

mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 

detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 

from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely 

enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 

estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 

the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 

pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and 

grade continuity.
