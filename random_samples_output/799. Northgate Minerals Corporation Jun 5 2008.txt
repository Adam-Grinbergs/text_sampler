1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION

In January 2008 Northgate staff prepared an estimate of the Mineral Resources of the

Lower Boundary Zone (LBZ), Upper Boundary Zone (UBZ), Lucky Zone (LKY), Lower

Lucky Zone (LL 1) and the Young-Davidson Zone (YD 1-4 Zones) at the Young-

Davidson Property (YD Property), Ontario. The YD Property is located immediately

west of the village of Matachewan, Ontario, and approximately 95 kms west of the town

of Kirkland Lake.

On November 2, 2005, Young-Davidson Mines, Limited (YDM) became a wholly

owned subsidiary of Northgate and on August 1, 2006, YDM, Northgate Minerals

Corporation, Northgate Resources Limited and Kemess Mines Ltd. were amalgamated as

one company under the name Northgate Minerals Corporation. Northgate owns 100% of

the mineral rights to all of the mineral resource related claims at the Young-Davidson

Mine (YD Mine) and the adjoining Matachewan Consolidated Mines (MCM) Mine

(MCM Mine). Northgate also holds the mineral rights to a large number of claims that

are contiguous with the two mine properties. The contiguous claim block that covers the

YD Mine, the MCM Mine, and the surrounding extensions, is referred to as the YD

Property and the Young-Davidson Project (YD Project).

Northgate began a significant surface drilling program in early 2006 designed to

confirm and expand the underground resources at the YD Mine. The results of this work

formed the basis of a NI 43-101 resource statement dated January 12, 2007. During 2007

Northgate drilled a further 52 drill holes and wedge holes (YD06-28 to YD07-56) up

until December 20, 2007, which is the data cut-off date for the resource estimate

discussed in this report. Northgate has drilled two new holes on the MCM property to

locate mining voids and confirm the results of a cavity monitoring survey. In addition, a

surface drill program is near complete targeting specific areas of the open pit resource,

where there is potential for resource additions. By cut-off date, 34 of 55 holes had

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

received results, and they together with previous drilling will form the dataset for a new

Open Pit resource targeted for completion by mid 2008.

Northgate has retained an independent engineering firm to prepare a preliminary

assessment of the YD Property.

GEOLOGY

The YD Property is situated within the southwestern part of the Abitibi Greenstone

Belt. The Abitibi Greenstone Belt consists of a complex and diverse array of volcanic,

sedimentary, and plutonic rocks typically metamorphosed to greenschist facies grade, but

locally attaining amphibolite facies grade. Volcanic rocks range in composition from

rhyolitic to komatiitic and commonly occur as mafic to felsic volcanic cycles.

Sedimentary rocks consist of both chemical and elastic varieties and occur as both

intravolcanic sequences and as uncomformably overlying sequences. A wide spectrum of

	mafic to felsic, pre-tectonic, syn-tectonic and post-tectonic intrusive rocks is present. All

lithologies are cut by late, generally northeast -trending Proterozoic diabase dikes.

The Abitibi Greenstone Belt rocks have undergone a complex sequence of

deformation events ranging from early fabricless folding and faulting through later

upright folding, faulting and ductile shearing resulting in the development of large,

dominantly east-west trending, crustal-scale structures ("breaks") that form a lozenge-like

pattern. The regional Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault Zone (LLCFZ) cuts across the YD

Property. The LLCFZ has a subvertical dip and generally strikes east-west. The LLCFZ

is characterized by chlorite -talc-carbonate schist and the deformation zone can be

followed for over 120 miles from west of Kirkland Lake to Val d'Or.

There are three important groups of Archean sedimentary rocks in the district. The

oldest are Pontiac Group quartz greywacke and argillite, which occur as thick

assemblages in Quebec, while interbedded within the Larder Lake Group volcanic rocks

are turbiditic siltstones and greywackes of the Porcupine Group. Unconformably

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

overlying is Timiskiming Group conglomerate, turbidite and iron formation with minor

interbedded alkalic volcaniclastic units.

Archean intrusive rocks are numerous in the district but are largely manifested as

small stocks, dikes and plugs of augite syenite, syenite and feldspar porphyry occurring

in close temporal and spatial association with the distribution of Timiskiming Group

sediments. The main syenite mass, which hosts most of the gold mineralization on the

YD Property, measures almost 900m east-west by 300m north-south.

Huronian Proterozoic sedimentary rocks onlap and define the southern limit of the

Abitibi in Ontario. In the project area these rocks are correlative to the Gowganda

Formation tillite. Post-Archean dike rocks include Matachewan Diabase and younger

Nipissing Diabase, which respectively bracket the Huronian unconformity in the project

area.

MINERALIZATION

Essentially all of the historical production at the YD Mine and approximately 60% of

the production from the MCM Mine is from syenite-hosted gold mineralization (Lovell,

1967). Most of the current open pit and underground resources are also related to

syenite-hosted gold. The syenite-hosted gold mineralization consists of a stockwork of

quartz veinlets and narrow quartz veins, rarely greater than a few inches in thickness,

situated within a broader halo of disseminated pyrite and potassic alteration. Visible gold

is common in the narrower, glassy-textured quartz veinlets. In general, gold grades

increase with quartz veinlet abundance, pyrite abundance, and alteration intensity.

Mineralized areas are visually distinctive and are characterized by brick red to pink K-

	

feldspar-rich syenite containing two to three percent disseminated pyrite and several

orientations of quartz extension veinlets and veins. The quartz veins and veinlets

commonly contain accessory carbonate, pyrite, and feldspar.

METALLURGY

Metallurgical tests have been conducted on drill core to obtain design and operating

parameters for a proposed flow sheet that envisioned extraction of gold using a flotation-

cyanidation process. Historical testwork found that the increased costs of power and

capital equipment did not immediately warrant the need to grind beyond 70% passing the

#200 sieve. Leach tests were based on the coarser grind. The optimum residence time of

60 hours at this grind provided an average gold extraction of 91.7%, with an average gold

extraction of 89.9% obtained at the lowest level of cyanide addition tested (1.0lb/ton of

solution) and excluding the additional recovery from the gravity circuit. Testing also

confirmed that a residence time of 48 hours for this same grind provided, on average,

recoveries of 87.8% at minimum cyanide loading and excluding the recovery from the

gravity circuit (Royal Oak, 1997).

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE

Northgate staff has prepared new underground resource estimates for the UBZ, LBZ,

the Lucky Zone, the Lower Lucky Zone and the YD Zone. The current resource estimate

incorporates new interpretations for all of the underground mineralization, including the

UBZ, and is also based on a new interpretation of the diabase dikes. The current resource

	

estimate is based on all of the historical drill holes and on recent (2007) surface drill

holes up to hole YD07-56.

All of the open pit resources represent additional current resources that were

estimated by Micon in 2004. Northgate plans to update the open pit resource estimates in

the near future as part of the work leading up to a feasibility study. There are currently

no Mineral Reserves at the YD Project.

Northgate built a block model, constrained by 3D mineralization and barren diabase

wireframes, to estimate the resources. Northgate used a US$600/oz (C$630/oz) gold

price, a 90% gold recovery, and a C$38/tonne underground operating cost to estimate a

breakeven cut-off of approximately 2.3g/tonne Au. A minimum true thickness of

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

approximately 3 metres and an incremental cut-off grade of approximately 1.7g/tonne Au

were used to define the resource mineralization intersections. The 1.7g/tonne Au

breakeven cut-off grade was used to constrain the resource wireframes. Some exceptions

were made in order to preserve internal zone continuity.

The Indicated Mineral Resources of the UBZ, LBZ, Lucky Zone, Lower Lucky Zone

and YD Zones total 11.9 million tonnes at an average cut grade of 3.70g/tonne gold and

contain 1.42 million ounces of gold. The Inferred Mineral Resources total 4.2 million

tonnes at an average cut grade of 3.24g/tonne gold and contain 0.44 million ounces of

gold (Table 1-1).

CONCLUSIONS

In the opinion of the author the 2007 drilling program has been successful in

expanding the YD Project underground resources and it is recommended that Northgate

continue the surface drilling program and advancing an underground exploration program

	

to access some of the mineralized zones for bulk sampling and to provide diamond drill

platforms for delineation. This will generate a significant amount of new data over the

near future. It is also the author's opinion that there is potential to increase the

underground resources because many of the mineralized lenses remain open at depth,

there are isolated untested areas in the plane of the defined mineralization, and there are

untested conceptual geophysical and geological targets on the greater property.

The syenite-hosted gold mineralization exhibits good gold grade continuity. The

mineralization occurs generally as east-west striking, steeply south dipping, vertically

attenuated lenses with local flexures and tapered flanks. The LBZ1 Lens is the largest

continuous lens of mineralization defined to date. It extends laterally east-west for at

least 280m, vertically for at least 1,000m, and reaches 43m in true thickness. The

resource mineralization true thicknesses average approximately l lm, at the LBZ, 13m at

the UBZ, and 9m at the YD and 7m Lucky Zones.

	

The current resource estimate is based on a US$600/oz gold price. There is potential

to increase the true thicknesses in some of the resource drill hole intersections if a lower

incremental cut-off grade is used in future resource estimates that are based on higher

gold prices.

DM TOR/2 73 3 74-00004/2 5 1 01 47AA



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

There is also evidence that there are a number of subparallel, possibly anastomosing,

generally east-west striking, alteration corridors that host the resource lenses defined so

far. Drilling history on the project has demonstrated that these lenses may grow and

merge with adjacent lenses as the results for infill drilling become available. As more

information becomes available, it may be possible to correlate continuous alteration

corridors using the gold assays at a low cut-off grade, the multi-element data, and other

information.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The following work is warranted:

1. Continue the surface drilling and surface exploration program. This includes the
following activities:

• Update the Micon (2004) open pit resource estimate based on revised gold
price, pit optimization, recently completed drill holes for which results
were not available at the time of writing of this report, and other resource
estimation parameters.

• Continue data verification and validation program on drill holes that
support open pit and UBZ resources, particularly in reference to
underground workings surveying.

•

	

Review the capping levels prior to the next resource estimate.

•

	

As new data becomes available, carry out trend analysis work including
grade, thickness, and grade-times-thickness contouring on longitudinal
projections, and geostatistical studies to determine possible plunge
orientations and ranges of continuity for each lens.

•

	

Continue to refine the diabase wireframes.

•

	

Construct updated wireframes for the main rock types.

•

	

Try to correlate continuous alteration corridors using the gold assays at a
low cut-off grade, the multi-element data, and other information.

• Construct mineralization wireframes at a number of incremental cut-off
grades to develop a preliminary tonnage-grade curve for the YD Project
underground syenite-hosted resources.

•

	

Continue to carry out detailed structural mapping of surface outcrops, pits
and underground workings.

2. Complete the active underground exploration program on the syenite-hosted
mineralization at the YD Project.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF
REFERENCE

In January 2008 Northgate staff prepared an estimate of the Mineral Resources of the

Lower Boundary Zone (LBZ), Upper Boundary Zone (UBZ), Lucky Zone (LKY), Lower

Lucky Zone (LL 1) and the Young-Davidson Zone (YD 1-4 Zones) at the Young-

Davidson Property (YD Property), Ontario for the company. This work is preparatory to

a Preliminary Assessment of the economic viability of a proposed mining project at the

YD Property. The YD Property is located immediately west of the village of

Matachewan, Ontario, and lies approximately 95 kms west of the town of Kirkland Lake.

Northgate Minerals Corporation, formerly known as Northgate Exploration Limited

up until May 14, 2004, is a gold and copper mining company. Northgate's assets include

the 300,000-ounce per year Kemess mine in north central British Columbia and the

adjacent Kemess North deposit. Northgate is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under

the symbol NGX and on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol NXG.

On November 2, 2005, Young-Davidson Mines, Limited (YDM) became a wholly

owned subsidiary of Northgate and on August 1, 2006, YDM, Northgate Minerals

Corporation, Northgate Resources Limited, and Kemess Mines Ltd. were amalgamated as

	

one company under the name of Northgate Minerals Corporation. Northgate owns 100%

of the mineral rights to all of the mineral resource related claims at the Young-Davidson

Mine (YD Mine) and the adjoining Matachewan Consolidated Mines (MCM) Mine

(MCM Mine). Northgate also holds the mineral rights to a large number of claims that

are contiguous with the two mine properties. The contiguous claim block that covers the

YD Mine, the MCM Mine, and the surrounding extensions, is referred to as the YD

Property and the Young-Davidson Project (YD Project). The YD Project open pit and

underground Mineral Resources were reported in a 2004 technical report by Micon

International Limited (Micon). The YD Project was formerly known as the Matachewan

Project (Micon, 2004)

Northgate began a significant surface drilling program in early 2006 designed to

confirm and expand the underground resources at the YD Mine. The results of this work

formed the basis of a NI 43-101 resource statement dated January 12, 2007. During 2007

Northgate drilled a further 52 drill holes and wedge holes (YD06-28 to YD07-56) up

until December 20, 2007, which is the data cut-off date for the resource estimate

discussed in this report. Northgate has drilled two new holes on the MCM property to

locate mining voids and confirm the results of a cavity monitoring survey. In addition, a

surface drill program is near complete targeting specific areas of the open pit resource,

where there is potential for resource additions. By cut-off date 34 of 55 holes had

received results, and they together with previous drilling will form the dataset for a new

Open Pit resource targeted for completion by second quarter 2008.

The author, Carl Edmunds has not changed any of the Micon resource estimates that

are unaffected by new drilling information reported herein. Consequently, this report

presents new underground resource estimates for the LBZ, UBZ, the Lucky Zone, Lower

Lucky Zone, and the YD Zone. The Micon (2004) estimates for the open pit resources

remain the current mineral resource estimates for these areas.

On September 25, 2006, Northgate announced that the permits required to commence

an advanced underground exploration program at the YD Property were granted by the

Ontario government. The project's underground ramp development and shaft dewatering

has been completed to a depth of 275m from surface.

This report has been prepared by Carl Edmunds M.Sc., P.Geo., Exploration Manager

for Northgate who has been involved in the project and visited the site numerous times

since acquisition in November 2005. Activities include acquisition due diligence review

on the Micon 2004 resources in July 2005, early stage 2006 program design and

supervision, on-going monthly to quarterly site visits to review results and preparation of

resource updates. The most recent inspection prior to the writing of this report was

November 12-17, 2007. Jim Janzen, is the YD project's Senior Geologist since January

2006, with responsibilities for current exploration program design, the daily execution of

the surface drilling and geologic interpretation of results. This report acknowledges the

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

PROPERTY LOCATION

The YD Project is located immediately west of the village of Matachewan, Ontario,

and approximately 95 kms west of the town of Kirkland Lake, Ontario (Figure 4-1)

(47°56'48.41 "N Latitude, 80°40'28.08"W Longitude).

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION

The YD Project is comprised of 210 tenures related to mining claims, mining leases,

patents, and licences of occupation that were acquired either through staking, application,

or option agreements (Figures 4-2 and 4-3 and Table 24-1 in Appendix 1). Generally

small groups of claims are collectively converted into mining leases so the number of

tenures represents the original number of claims. The project consists of 121 staked

mining claims, 39 mining leases, two patented claims, and two licences of occupation,

covering approximately 754 hectares of surface rights and 4,908 hectares of mining rights

(Table 4-1). The YD Property can be subdivided into eight claim groups based on

agreements and the original claim owners, which included: Fred S. Kiernicki and Mark

A. Fekete (Kiernicki-Fekete); Matachewan Consolidated Mines (MCM); Robert B.

Schaus/Donald J. Clarke/John Shirriff (Schaus-Clarke-Shirriff); Sedex Mining Corp.

(Sedex); John Shirriff (Shirriff); Welsh Estate (Welsh); Opawica and YDM.

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

The claims are located in the southeast corner of Powell Township, the northeast

corner of Yarrow Township and the southwest corner of Cairo Township. All claims are

situated within the Larder Lake Mining Division and the claims are contiguous. All of

the mining leases and patented claims have been surveyed.

The mining and surface rights related to 24 claims and nine leases have been

withdrawn due to Ontario's Living Legacy and the Temagami Land Caution. In

September of 2007 the Land Caution was lifted on all mining claims except those

withdrawn under Ontario's Living Legacy legislation; however the map shown in Figure

4-4 does not reflect the recent change. None of the withdrawn claims and leases affect

the YD Project resource estimates.

The withdrawn claims and leases affected by Ontario's Living Legacy are related to

Ontario government Order Nos. W-LL-F 1600/02 ONT and W-LL-F 1715102 ONT. Map

references and more information can be found at the Ministry of Northern Development

and Mines (MNDM) website.

Twenty-eight mining claims L494591-L494595, L495895-L495899, L523116-

L523119 and L523141-L523145 form part of the Schaus-Clarke-Shirriff claim group,

	

where Northgate is the recorded holder of 20% interest and Mr. Schaus holds 80%

interest. Following the death of Mr. Schaus, the Schaus title to these mining claims was

not passed along to an heir, and the question of ownership remains outstanding. A

special hold status was assigned to these claims. In order to remove this hold status, the

MNDM must make application to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to have the claims

validated. These claims are located in the southwest part of the land holdings, and do not

contain any resources.

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

AGREEMENTS

The YD Project original owners of the claims included MCM, George Welsh, John

	

Shirriff, Robert Schaus/John Shirriff, and YDM. Northgate currently owns a 100%

interest in all these claims, except the Schaus-Clarke-Shirriff claims, either by direct

ownership or via option agreements. In regard to the Schaus-Clarke-Shirriff claim group,

Northgate currently holds a 20% interest. The remaining 80% interest in the claims

resides with Robert Schaus, who is deceased. Northgate is working with the heirs of the

Schaus estate to arrange for the transfer of the remaining 80% interest in these claims to

Northgate.

	

In order to maintain its option agreement valid with MCM, Northgate must pay all

municipal and land taxes. As well, during periods of economic force majeure (whenever

the price of gold is less than US$400 per ounce), Northgate must pay a non-recoverable

option payment at the commencement of every six-month period of US$3,750. If, at any

time during the six-month period the price of gold exceeds US$400 per ounce, Northgate

will pay a US$7,500 recoverable advance royalty payment. Northgate is obligated to

provide quarterly reports to MCM on the progress of any work completed on the land

holdings, along with sufficient production and financial information to enable MCM to

verify the correctness of any production royalty paid to MCM.

During periods of production and at a base gold price of US$270 per troy ounce, a

royalty of US $1.00 will be paid per ton of ore mined and processed from the MCM

property. When applicable, an additional royalty will be paid on each ounce recovered in

each quarter to compensate for any increase in price received over US$270 per ounce.

This will amount to 5% of the increase in price per ounce recovered above the base rate

of US$270. The price will be based on the average quarterly price of gold sold on the free

market during the quarter in which the gold is shipped.

In order to maintain its option agreement with Welsh, Northgate must pay an advance

royalty of C$1,500 per twelve month period during periods of economic force majeure.

During periods of production, Welsh shall receive C$1.50 per ton of ore mined and
DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

processed from the property, or 20% of the net profits (until such time as 0.5 million tons

have been mined after which the net profits interest is 25%), whichever shall be greater.

The agreement with Mr. Shirriff has no ongoing obligations to fulfill in order to

maintain its good standing. However, a 2% Net Smelter Return is retained by Mr.

Shirriff. Similarly, the agreement with Schaus-Clarke-Shirriff has no ongoing

obligations, and it too has a 2% Net Smelter Return which currently accrues to the Schaus

estate.

On May 28, 2007 Northgate entered into an option and joint venture agreement

whereby Northgate acquired 10,000,000 shares of Opawica to fund 2007 exploration on

Opawica properties in Matachewan. This expenditure ($1,078,590) on 14 Opawica

claims on the northern contiguous boundary of Northgate's YD property have earned

	

Northgate a current 100% interest in the surface rights to these claims, and a future 55%

interest in Opawica's mineral rights in the Matachewan area by May 28, 2010 subject to a

cumulative exploration expenditure of $2 million.

ENVIRONMENT

CURRENT SETTING

Mining activities have taken place in the area since the Young-Davidson Mine and

the Matachewan Consolidated Mine were in production from the 1930s to the 1950s.

Remnant environmental liabilities associated with the YD Property are typical of

historical mine sites and include four inactive tailings areas, several mine workings such

as shafts and raises, near surface crown pillars, open scopes, small pits, as well as

abandoned and partially demolished surface foundations.

None of the existing mine hazards have been subjected to remediation or reclaimed to

current standards. Several of the mine hazards are located on land to which Northgate

Minerals does not currently own title to. Title to these area lands will be acquired, as

needed, for future project developments. It is expected that all remnant mine hazards

would be adequately addressed and reclaimed to appropriate standards as part of future

mine development scenarios.

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

In response to a 1990 tailings spill and resultant reclamation of the breached

Matachewan Tailings Area 1 by the Ontario government, a construction lien in the

amount of $383,434 was placed against Matachewan Consolidated Mines to recover

incurred costs associated with the remedial stabilization measures. Northgate is proposing

to acquire the title to these tailings from MCM as integral to future developments. It is

presumed that this lien would need to be removed.

In 2007 Northgate initiated advanced exploration activities at the YD Property

authorized under the following approvals and authorizations:

1. Ministry of Northern Development and Mines - Mine Closure Plan with a

corresponding financial assurance of $539,100.

2. Ministry of Environment - Certificate of Approval for Industrial Sewage Works

for the discharge of mine effluent to the Montreal River.

3. Ministry of Environment - Permit to Take Water for dewatering MCM Mine

workings.

4.

	

Ministry of Natural Resources - Clearance letter for resumption of use of the

mine dewatering pipeline in the Montreal River.

5. Department of Fisheries and Oceans - Clearance letter for installation and

operation of the mine dewatering pipeline for discharge of mine effluent to the

Montreal River.

6.

	

Transport Canada - Clearance letter for installation of a mine dewatering pipeline

in the Montreal River.

COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS

In 2007, Northgate held a number of public information sessions in the Town of

Matachewan, Matachewan First Nation, as well as the Towns of Elk Lake and Kirkland

Lake. Updates of advanced exploration activities as well as introductions to proposed

future mine developments were presented at the public open houses. Feedback to date

generally supports the YD Property and it is recognized by the local communities as a

development that will provide significant socio-economic benefits to the area.

Northgate is working diligently to establish and maintain a cooperative relationship

with the Matachewan First Nation (MFN). The MFN is the closest First Nation to the YD

Property site located approximately 10 km north of the Town of Matachewan. The MFN

dM TOR/273374-00004l2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

is one of seven First Nation community members of the Wabun Tribal Council, is a

signatory of Treaty 9, and is affiliated with the Nishnawbe-Aski Nation.

This relationship recognizes the unique cultural, land use, employment and training

	

needs, and environmental interests of the MFN. The MFN have been approached on all

environmental-related matters associated with the YD Property to date, and its members

have been given the opportunity to obtain employment and related training opportunities

at the YD Property, during the exploration and advanced exploration stages.

FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Consideration of historical environmental impacts and anticipated regulatory

permitting processes, have figured prominently in the development of the preliminary

layouts, designs and operating procedures for the YD Property. These include

consideration of the implications of design alternatives from an environmental approvals

perspective related to such key project components as the tailings impoundment area

(TIA) and the realignment of Highway 566.

	

In order to confirm the applicability (if any) of the Federal Environmental

Assessment process as per the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) in the

context of proposed future mine developments, a comprehensive description of the YD

Project (YD Prospectus) was prepared and submitted to several federal agencies in July

2007 (AMEC 2007). Federal agencies participating in the Prospectus review process

included Natural Resources Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Indian and Northern

	

Affairs Canada, Environment Canada, Transport Canada and Health Canada, all

supported by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.

On September 19, 2007 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency informed

Northgate that the Federal agencies had completed their review of the Prospectus and

determined that the project design as presented in the Prospectus did not present any

triggers for the CEAA process.

DM TOK/2 73 3 74-00004/2 510147 .4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROCESSES

In the absence of a federal review process as per the requirements of CEAA, the

project would still be subject to provincial regulatory reviews and approval processes.

	

It is anticipated that three Provincial Class Environmental Assessments (EA) will

need to be completed based on the current project design:

1. Ministry of Transportation (MTO) Class EA for Provincial Transportation

Facilities;

2. Ministry of the Environment (MOE) Class EA for Electricity Projects; and

3. Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Class EA for MNR Resource Stewardship

and Facility Development Projects.

A MTO Class EA will be required for relocation of Highway 566 around site

facilities.

The proposed power line for the YD Project is greater than 2km in length and in

excess of 115kV which dictates that a MOE Class EA for minor transmission facilities be

completed.

A portion of proposed tailings impoundment area and the 115kV transmission line is

expected to be located on Crown land administered by MNR (pending land tenure

investigations). As such, the MNR Class EA process would apply to dispositions of

crown lands.

There is also a requirement for a Declaration Order under the Mining Act from the

Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) for disposition of mining lands.

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A

PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS

There are five primary Provincial agencies that will approve construction of a mine

on the Young-Davidson Property: MNDM, MOE, MNR, MTO and the Ontario Energy

Board (OEB).

	

The MNDM has a responsibility to ensure the orderly development of mineral

resources in the Province, including responsibilities for the disposition of Crown lands for

mining, as well as primary responsibility for mine closure activities.

The MOE grants permits and approvals that address Young-Davidson Project aspects

related to surface and ground waters, air quality (including noise) and waste management.

The MNR's role is to ensure the protection and wise use of Crown resources, not

otherwise disposed such as through the Mining Act administered by MNDM.

MTO has responsibility for provincial owned highways and administers the

construction, modification and maintenance of highways throughout the province.

The OEB has responsibility for energy-related approvals, including approval to

construct transmission lines. It operates as an adjudicative tribunal and carries out its

regulatory function through oral or written public hearings.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND
PHYSIOGRAPHY

Refer to Section 5 of the January 2007 Technical Report: "The Lower Boundary Zone,
Lucky Zone, and Lower YD Zone Mineral Resource Estimates, Young -Davidson
Property, Matachewan, Ontario".

Material upgrades to surface and underground infrastructure since January 2007 are
discussed below.

In the fall of 2006, Northgate commenced excavating a 5 in by 5 in decline that is

permitted and contracted to reach a final vertical depth of 450 metres. This decline ramp

provides a platform for underground exploration and definition drilling as well as

allowing a cross cut through the mineralization in order to assess the geological controls

to the mineralization and provide a bulk sample for ongoing metallurgical test work. At

the same time, Northgate commenced dewatering and rehabilitation of the Matachewan

Consolidated Mines No. 3 shaft. There is currently a 22 person camp at the site and there

are several service buildings erected and in use to support the ongoing decline excavation

and dewatering program.

At date of writing the ramp and ancillary development, such as the cross cut through the

Upper Boundary Zone and development to tie in to the historic workings adjacent to the

	

No. 3 shaft totaled 2,841 metres. Shaft dewatering and rehabilitation had reached the Stn

level, 330 metres below surface. This underground program is in support of engineering

studies that are currently ongoing and which include a preliminary assessment and

environmental baseline study (both of which are being prepared by an independent

engineering firm).

Northgate has contracted an independent engineering firm to prepare a feasibility study.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES

The Young-Davidson deposit comprised of the Lower Boundary Zone (LBZ), Upper

Boundary Zone (UBZ), Lucky Zone (LKY), Lower Lucky Zone (LL) and the Young-

Davidson Zone (YD 1-4 Zones) can be described as an Archean, syenite-hosted gold

deposit. The gold mineralization is mostly related to quartz veinlet stockworks and

disseminated pyrite mineralization, and is frequently associated with broader zones of

potassic alteration.

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147,4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

9 MINERALIZATION

At least five styles of gold mineralization are recognized at the YD Project. They are

described in detail in Micon (2004) and Rhys (Panterra Geoservices Inc., 2003).

1. Syenite-hosted gold mineralization

2. Mafic volcanic-hosted gold mineralization (MCM Mine)

3. Timiskaming sediment-hosted gold mineralization

4. Ultramafic-hosted gold mineralization

5. Hanging wall contact gold mineralization

	

Essentially all of the historical production at the YD Project and approximately 60%

of the production from the MCM Mine is from Syenite-hosted gold mineralization

(Lovell, 1967). Most of the current open pit and underground resources are also related

to syenite-hosted gold.

The syenite-hosted gold mineralization consists of a stockwork of quartz veinlets and

narrow quartz veins, rarely greater than a few inches in thickness, situated within a

broader halo of disseminated pyrite and potassic alteration. Visible gold is common in

the narrower, glassy-textured quartz veinlets. In general, gold grades increase with quartz

veinlet abundance, pyrite abundance, and alteration intensity. Mineralized areas are

visually distinctive and are characterized by brick red to pink K-feldspar-rich syenite

containing two to three percent disseminated pyrite and several orientations of quartz

extension veinlets and veins. The quartz veins and veinlets commonly contain accessory

carbonate, pyrite, and feldspar.

At least two orientations for the quartz veins and veinlets are recognized. Most dip

gently to the north and are ladder-type flat veins and some dip steeply to the north. The

flat veinlets are common in the large outcrop exposures and small pits on surface.

Previous workers noted that the syenite-hosted gold mineralization is generally more

extensive and lower grade near surface and appears to be more channeled and

concentrated into higher grade corridors at depth (SWRPA, 2007).
DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

Ore shoots within the syenite may plunge moderately to the southwest parallel to the

L3 lineation (Panterra Geoservices Inc., 2003), however, a strong vertical down dip

attenuation and plunge direction is indicated by the historical open pits and underground

stopes. The current mineralization wireframes suggest that the mineralization may

plunge steeply to the south-southwest or rake subvertically to moderately to the west.

	

Actual plunge direction(s) for the underground syenite-hosted gold mineralization will

become more evident as new data become available.

The current Northgate underground and Micon open pit mineralization wireframes

are shown in Figure 9-1. The 2004 Micon open pit mineralization wireframes are shown

in red and are mostly hidden by the Micon pit shell in brown. Historical underground

development, the Lower YD glory hole stope, and the UBZ stopes are shown in black.

The Northgate mineralization wireframes are shown in other colours that are described

below and shown in more detail in Figure 9-2.

FIGURE 9-1 3D PERSPECTIVE SHOWING MINERALIZATION
WIREFRAMES

The underground mineralization has been subdivided into four main zones, three of

which comprise numerous lenses. Some lenses are formed from a number of discrete

solids that are the result of clipping mineralization solids with the barren diabase dikes or

from relative stratigraphic correlations. The approximate lateral and vertical extents for

the main zones of underground mineralization are summarized in Table 9-1.

The YD Zone is comprised of four lenses based on their relative stratigraphic

positions with respect to the syenite footwall. YD Lens YD2 (red) is currently the

northernmost of the YD lenses and is located closest to the syenite footwall. It is the

down plunge extension of the old Young-Davidson glory hole mineralization, which is

also known as the "carrot". The Lucky (LKY) and Lower Lucky (LL1) zones appear as

eastern en-echelon structures to the syenite footwall YD2 wireframe.

YD Lens YD I (blue) is the main body of continuous mineralization at depth in the

YD area and it is situated slightly to the south of Lens YD2. A diabase dike (Dike-F),

cuts the main part of Lens YD 1 into two separate solids. The other two YD lenses (YD3

& 4) are en-echelon structures located above and hangingwall to the main YD 1 lens.

A Lower Boundary Zone solid (LBZ2) is interpreted to correlate with YD1 at and

below the 9,440m elevation east of Dike F. Lens LBZ1 is located to the east and footwall

to the LBZ2 lens and it correlates with the UBZ wireframe (magenta) located further east

separated by a major zone of dykes.

The general arrangement of the solids is that of near continuous over-lapping en-

echelon zones, which step to the right in plan going from east to west. Down dip the

individual solids appear to dip steeper than their enveloping surfaces, such that the base

of a given solid is overlapped by the top of an adjacent one occurring in the hangingwall.

10 EXPLORATION

Northgate acquired the YD Project in November 2005. Essentially, all of the

exploration work completed by Northgate has been surface diamond drilling and this is

summarized in the next section.

11 DRILLING

Northgate began a deep surface drilling program in early 2006 designed to confirm

and expand the underground resources at the YD Property. This work was completed by

Forage Orbit, of Val D'Or Quebec. Northgate drilled 95 drill holes and wedge holes

(YD06-01 to YD07-56) totaling 67,408.2m up until late December 20, 2007, which is the

data cut-off date for the resource estimate discussed in this report. Resource intersections

were defined in 59 of the 95 holes drilled by Northgate. Of the Northgate holes an

additional three drill holes contain isolated intersections that may be incorporated into

future resource estimates and eighteen holes had to be abandoned, due to deflection or

other technical concerns. Seven holes intersected diabase at mineralization projections

which should happen less frequently in the future as the accuracy of the deeper portions

of the diabase wireframes improves. Another five drill holes yielded sub-economic

intersections, which is normal in drill holes that delimit zone extremities. Overall,

approximately two thirds of the drill holes that reached their targets were successful in

expanding the underground resources reflecting a high success ratio for a technically

	

challenging deep drilling program on gold mineralization in a complex geological

environment.

Northgate has only drilled two new holes on the MCM property for scope monitoring

	

purposes. MCM is considered a lower priority exploration target that should receive drill

holes later in 2008. At time of writing results had been received for thirty four Open Pit

area drill holes. This is part of an on-going program to expand and confirm the Micon

2004 Open Pit resources and will be reported on at a future date.

The Northgate drilling database for the YD Project currently contains some 1,319

surface and underground diamond drill holes totaling 233,696.6m. Current open pit and

underground resources extend from approximately 22500 to 24000E. Between these

coordinates the YD Resource Database contains 783 surface and underground diamond

drill holes totaling 174,714.8m (Table 11-1). The YD Resource Database surface and

underground drill hole traces and the underground mine development are shown in Figure

11-1.

The gold mineralization has a fairly uniform dip of -70° to the south and an east west

strike, described in greater detail below. The relationship between the sample length and

true thickness of the mineralization varies with the inclination of the drill holes and the

dip of the deposit where it is intersected. The true thickness of the mineralization is

interpreted using the Vulcan software to measure the thickness on cross sections as

described below.

DRILL LOGS

A complete set of drill logs are available for the drilling by Pamour from 1980 to

1995, the drilling by Royal Oak from 1996 to 1997, by YDM in 2003, and by Northgate

in 2006 and 2007. The drill logs related to mostly underground drilling at both mines

from the 1930s to 1950s no longer exist, however, the drill hole traces and assays have

been digitized from level plans and sections. All of the 2006-2007 core was

photographed prior to splitting.

DRILL COLLAR AND DOWN HOLE SURVEYS

Collar survey records by professional land surveyors are available for most of the

1988 to 1996 drill holes and all of the 2006 and 2007 drill holes. It is assumed that most

of the pre-1988 surface drill hole collars were not surveyed and were chained from the

exploration grid lines. The collar coordinate uncertainty in these older holes could be in

the order of plus or minus ten metres or so, which is insignificant for drill hole

	

intersections that are spaced at 30 to 150m apart. It is believed that the underground drill

holes are accurately located with respect to the surface drill holes; however it is known

that an approximate 1.25 degree rotational difference exists between the modeled

underground workings' position and the present locations of underground drill collars.

The shaft collars have been surveyed and the MCM Mine was partially dewatered and

remapped in 1997.

In 2007 the project was converted over to metric NAD 83 UTM survey base and the

details for this translation are documented in company files. The conversion amounted to

a scale change and an Easting, Northing and Elevation translation from the origin of the

	

imperial survey base. Check surveying of previous holes initially located in the imperial

grid is an on-going task which occasionally results in revisions to drill hole collar

locations. Most revisions are less than 10m, but one historic drill hole collar (YD86-08)

supporting the Micon 2004 open pit resource was found have a 75.4m error in its

recorded casting.

Northgate regularly used a FLEXIT and a gyroscopic instrument to measure hole

	

deviation in order to locate the mineralized zones as accurately as possible. Historical

downhole survey tests were taken every few hundred feet or so by using a tropari

instrument made by Pajari Instruments Ltd., or a single shot camera and compass

instrument made by Sperry Sun, or by using acid tests. Essentially all of the holes since

1980 have downhole survey data.

Mineralization at Young-Davidson generally strikes east-west and dips 75° to the

south, however there are localized areas where the orientations can deviate by 40° in
DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

strike and 25° in dip. Most drilling from surface has been conducted from south to north,

while most underground holes are oriented to transect mineralization at a high angle.

Most YD-project core length intercepts do not represent true orthogonal width of

mineralization, but rather a variable fraction of the core length intercept, depending on

	

relative orientation of each hole and mineralization. All reported widths in Table 25-1

(Composite Control Intervals) and Section 17 are reported as true thicknesses, and the 3-

D wireframe modeling employed herein volumetrically accounts for the acute (<90°)

angles between mineralization and drill hole.

Northgate considers that the locations of all of the surface and underground drill holes

in the YD Resource Database are reasonable and that all of the drill holes should be

included for resource estimation work.

CORE SIZE

The 2006-2007 drill holes and one of the 2003 drill holes were drilled with NQ

equipment (1 7/8 in. core diameter). Northgate believes that all other surface holes have

BQ core (1 7/16 in. core diameter) and that the underground drill holes from the 1930s to

1950s were probably drilled with AQ equipment (1 1/16in. diameter).

CORE RECOVERY

Core recovery and rock quality designation (RQD) information is available in the

2006-2007 drill logs and is generally absent in the historical drill logs. Over much of the

project's exploration history, core recovery is excellent and the mineralization and its

wallrock are very competent.

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

Most of the Northgate (2006-07) core and all 2003 drill core were either split in half

with a hydraulic core splitter or were split using a diamond core saw by an employee of

the company. The Northgate core samples were selected by the logging geologist and

labelled with bar coded sample tags. The Northgate samples range in length from

approximately 0.3m to 2m and weigh approximately one to four kilograms each. The

Northgate half-core samples were bagged and placed in sacks, security sealed, and

shipped to ALS Chemex's sample preparation laboratory in Sudbury. In mid-2007 the

company began shipping samples to Swastika Labs, located in the hamlet of Swastika

	

near Kirkland Lake. Samples sent to Swastika were transported by company technical

personnel in rice sacks that are not security sealed as there are no transfer points where

the samples are beyond Northgate's control and supervision.

Details on the historical core splitting practices are not available; however,

mechanical core splatters were likely used.

SAMPLE LENGTHS

The following table refers to the 2,481 samples that are situated within the nine

mineralization wireframes and that were used to estimate resources as the resource

assays. Resource assay samples have lengths ranging from 0.1m to 47.9m and average

1.45m. (Table 12-1).

The 467 samples from the 1930s to 1950s include 56 samples with lengths greater

than 4m, in 29 underground holes on UBZ and 2 underground holes in the YD2 solids.

The 56 samples from the 1930s to 1950s represent 2.2% of the total number of resource

assays and 17% of the total length. Five of these historic holes are drilled down dip and

are in solids that are very tightly constrained. Total samples from the 1930's to 1950's

represent 19% of the total number of samples and 36% of the total length. The samples

	

from the 1980s and 1990s represent 42% of the total number of resource assays and 30%

of the total length. The samples from 2006 and 2007 represent 39% of the total number

of resource assays and 34% of the total length.

Approximately 81 % of the resource assays have sample lengths that are less than or

equal to 1.524m (5 feet). Some 28% of the resource assays, mostly from the 1990s, have

0.91m (3 feet) lengths and 40%, mostly from 2006-2007 and from the 1930s to 1950s,

have lengths between 1.5 and 1.52m (5 feet). Less than three percent of the resource

assays have lengths greater than 3.3m.

	

It is the author's opinion that based on the high core recovery, the professional

geologist supervision of the sampling process and the geologic control to the sampling,

that the samples are representative of the mineralized zones in this resource estimation.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND
SECURITY

Information on the historical methods used for sample preparation and gold assaying

are not readily available. Northgate assumes that conventional crushing, pulverizing, and

fire assaying techniques were carried out at the YD and MCM Mine laboratories to

analyze the 1930s to 1950s core samples. Northgate assumes most of the core samples

from the 1980s and 1990s were processed at the Pamour laboratory in Timmins. The

2003 core samples were sent to Swastika Laboratories (Micon 2004) in Swastika,

Ontario. The following discussion relates to the 2006-2007 work by Northgate. The labs

used for the Northgate work were ALS Chemex (preparation in Sudury or Timmins), and

later Swastika Labs in Swastika, Ontario.

SAMPLE PREPARATION

Upon arrival, the bar coded samples were logged into the ALS Chemex tracking

system and weighed. Each core sample was entirely crushed to better than 70% -2mm

(minus 10 mesh). A one kilogram split of each sample was then pulverized to better than

85% passing 75 micron (minus 150 mesh). Where indicated, a 250 gram duplicate split

of crushed material was taken and pulverized.

The prepared samples, certified reference material (CRM), and blanks were then

shipped overnight to ALS Chemex's Vancouver laboratory.

Upon arrival at Swastika Laboratories Ltd. lab, samples are dried followed by

crushing the total sample in a half inch jaw crusher, followed by a rolls crusher producing

a -10 mesh product. The coarse crush -10 mesh material is riffle split down to 350 grams,

	

using a Jones splitter. The reject material is bagged and tagged for storage. The 350

gram sample is pulverized using a ring and puck pulverizor to produce a pulp which is

homogenized and sent for fire assay. CRM and blanks are inserted into the submitted

DM TOR12 733 74-0000412 5 1 0 1 4Z4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

sample stream at the YD site. At Swastika, further CRM reference material is inserted

and duplicates are prepared.

ANALYSIS

ALS Chemex Vancouver weighed approximately 50g aliquots for fire assay. Fire

assay fusion was by lead flux with a silver collector, with an atomic absorption finish.

Each sample was also submitted for a 34 element analysis, by aqua-regia acid digestion

and ICP-AES. This process quantitatively dissolves base metals for the majority of

geological materials. Major rock forming elements and more resistive metals are only

partially dissolved. All sample batches were subjected to ALS Chemex's internal quality

control procedures.

Swastika weighs approximately a 30 gram aliquot for fire assay. Fire assay fusion is

by lead flux with a silver collector, with either an atomic absorption finish or a

	

gravimetric finish. All sample batches are subjected to Swastika's internal quality control

procedures, which includes in-house CRM and re-analysis of -10% of all assays.

SECURITY

	Northgate has implemented a number of measures designed to maintain a high level

of security at the core logging facility and at the mine property.

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

No information has been compiled that describes the quality control (QC) and quality

assurance (QA) procedures and results for the pre-2003 drilling programs. The 2003

QA/QC procedures are described in Micon (2004), and only one hole from the 2003

drilling affects the Northgate underground resource estimate.

Northgate assumes that blanks and CRMs were not used in the historical drilling

programs because this did not become standard industry practice for many mining
DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

companies until the early 2000s. The main form of QC/QA in the past would have been

periodic reassaying of anomalous samples. Some duplicates are shown on the assay

certificates from the 1980s and 1990s.

Micon (2004) states that some of the 1990 core was resampled and four twinned holes

were drilled to verify the gold grades reported from the 1980 drilling campaign.

The QC and QA results for the Northgate 2006-2007 drilling program as of December

	

31, 2007 are compiled in a detailed report by Konst (2008 - in prep). A total of 820

sample preparation and analytical quality control samples were submitted, at a frequency

of one in 26, along with 19,084 prepared mainstream samples, to ALS Chemex and

Swastika Labs during the YD Project 2006-2007 drilling program. This was upped to

one in 20 for the last two months of 2007 to account for smaller fusion batches run at

Swastika. This amounted to 4.3 percent of the entire population of samples submitted to

ALS Chemex and Swastika, including 280 blanks, 290 standards, and 250 reject

duplicates. Additionally, 1,768 pulp replicates and 4,353 reject duplicates were analyzed

and incorporated into final assay grade to improve overall precision. The main

conclusions by Konst (2008) are:

Results from the 280 blanks all indicate that there are no contamination issues.
One contamination issue was encountered at Swastika. The associated batch of
samples was re-run and revised.

2. Results from the 290 CRM (RockLabs standards SJ32 and SK33) indicated 26

	

outliers attributable to be fluxing issues related to the standard reference material
only. All outlier standard investigations and non-outlier standard performance
indicate that all analytical results are accurate.

3. Results of 1,615 pulp replicates, over the reported detection limit and below
7.Ogpt (0.21 oz/ton), indicate that the analytical precision is very good
(approximately 7% at the 1.7gpt (0.05oz/ton) cut-off grade). Above 7.Ogpt
(0.21 oz/ton) average precision is 14%.

4. Results of 4,455 reject duplicates, over the reported detection limit and below
7gpt (0.21 oz/ton), indicate that the combined preparation and analytical precision
is very good (approximately 13% at the 1.7gpt (0.05oz/ton) cut-off grade). Above
7.Ogpt (0.21oz/ton) average precision is 23%, which is still good precision.

DM TOR/2 73 3 74-00004/2 5 1 0 1 4 7.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation and analytical procedures

employed by both labs are adequate and have produced analytical results for the 2006-

2007 drilling programs which are accurate and precise and thus suitable for supporting

resource and reserve estimation work.

14 DATA VERIFICATION

NORTHGATE 2007 DATA VERIFICATION

Collar coordinates for 351 holes with 1,565 down hole survey tests and 14,851 assay

intervals were audited and verified for accuracy against a variety of supporting

documentation by Northgate personnel working under the direct supervision of the author

from October 2007 through December 2007. The author specifically selected these 395

drill holes because they intersected the underground resource solids forming the subject

of this report as well as any open pit area resources to be reported on later. Additionally,

the data verification extended beyond the limits of the resource solids to include a lower

grade envelope that may be used for future resource modeling. The data verification

program was designed and supervised by the author.

Northgate identified and corrected a large number of minor issues related to

downhole survey test distance values, rounding, truncation, and calculation errors. A few

significant issues related mostly to collar locations, collar orientations, and assay intervals

were also identified and corrected. The most significant revisions occurred with the

addition of new interval information for 651 assays which were previously reported as

much longer composite or summary results in the historic MCM and YD data.

NORTHGATE 2006 DATA VERIFICATION

Collar coordinates for 41 holes with 2,360 down hole survey tests and 1,137 assay

intervals were verified for accuracy against a variety of supporting documentation by

Northgate from September 18 through October 2, 2006. The author specifically selected

these 41 drill holes because they intersected the Lower Boundary, Lower YD, and Lucky

mineralized zones. The data verification program was designed and supervised by the

author.

Northgate identified and corrected a large number of minor issues related to

downhole survey test distance values, rounding, truncation, and calculation errors. A few

significant issues related mostly to collar locations, collar orientations, and assay intervals

were also identified and corrected.

Northgate made minor adjustments to most of the collar coordinates in the Fall of

2006 after the collar locations and grid control points were resurveyed and minor

refinements to the transformation profile for converting NAD83 survey information into

"Mine Grid" were made.

SCOTT WILSON RPA 2006 DATA VERIFICATION

In 2006 Scott Wilson RPA verified a small number of collar, downhole survey, and

assay records including some of the longer assay intervals and higher gold grades. No

significant errors were found. Although, the drill log, assay certificates, downhole survey

data, and collar survey data for each hole were well organized and filed together, a

number of exceptions were found. Subsequently, Scott Wilson recommended ensuring

that the hard copy file for each drill hole be complete expediting future data verification

programs.

MICON 2004 DATA VERIFICATION

In 2004 Micon verified 7,370 assay records in 51 holes that intersected mineralized

zones and found very few errors. None of the errors were considered to be significant

(Micon, 2004).

Pre-2004 data verification work is not documented.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND
METALLURGICAL TESTING

A conventional gold mill process is discussed in the 1997 Royal Oak feasibility study.

The actual mill process design decision will not be made until Northgate finalizes its own

feasibility study. The proposed Royal Oak milling process consists of crushing, grinding,

gravity separation, CIPUL leaching of the whole ore in a weak cyanide solution,

recovery of dissolved gold on activated carbon, pressure stripping of gold from activated

carbon, electrowinning and refining of gold into dore bullion. The dore bullion will be

shipped to a precious metals refinery for further processing into pure gold bullion. The

residual cyanide contained in the mill tailings slurry will be treated before transfer to the

tailings impoundment utilizing the S02 - air effluent treatment process (Royal Oak,

1997).

Metallurgical tests have been conducted on drill core to obtain design and operating

parameters for a proposed flow sheet that envisioned extraction of gold using a flotation-

cyanidation process. The effect of grind size, retention time, and cyanide concentration

has been investigated. While fine grinding presented some better recovery results, it was

found that the increased costs of power and capital equipment did not immediately

warrant the need to grind beyond 70% passing the #200 sieve. Leach tests were based on

the coarser grind. The optimum residence time of 60 hours at this grind provided an

average gold extraction of 91.7%, with an average gold extraction of 89.9% obtained at

the lowest level of cyanide addition tested (1.0 lb/ton of solution) and excluding the

additional recovery from the gravity circuit. Testing also confirmed that a residence time

of 48 hours for this same grind provided, on average, recoveries of 87.8% at minimum

cyanide loading and excluding the recovery from the gravity circuit (Royal Oak, 1997).

Although the 1997 report states that the samples are representative of the ore types

defined at that time, Northgate has initiated an extensive metallurgical program that is

ongoing and the samples for which are representative of the deposit as defined by the

latest drilling.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL
RESERVE ESTIMATES

The author, Carl Edmunds, P. Geol, Northgate Exploration Manager has prepared

new underground resource estimates for the UBZ, LBZ, the Lucky Zone, and the YD

Zone. All of the open pit resources represent additional current resources that were

estimated by Micon in 2004. Northgate plans to update the open pit resource estimate in

the near future as part of the work leading up to a preliminary assessment of the project.

There are currently no Mineral Reserves at the YD Project.

The new underground resource estimates for the UBZ, LBZ, the Lucky Zone, and the

YD Zone, collectively referred to as "the January 2008 resource estimate", are based on

all of the historical surface and underground diamond drilling available up until late

December 2007.

Northgate used Maptek's Vulcan 7.0 to build a block model, constrained by 3D

mineralization and barren diabase wireframes, to estimate the resources. The main

resource estimation parameters are summarized below.

YD RESOURCE DATABASE

The YD Resource Database comprises 783 diamond drill holes totalling 174,417.8m

of which 180 diamond drill holes totalling 100,555m intersected the UBZ, the LBZ

(1 &2), the Lucky Zone (LKY & LL 1), and the YD (YD 1-4) Zone resource mineralization

wireframes. The portion of the YD Resource Database related to the January 2008

Resource estimate contains 2,481 assay records, 6,825 downhole survey records, and 234

composite control intervals (Table 17-1).

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION

	Northgate staff in conjunction with the author provided the initial geological

interpretation work for the UBZ, LBZ, the Lucky Zone, and the YD Zone mineralization.

Northgate staff also provided 3D wireframes for the post-mineralization barren diabase

dikes. This work was used to guide the construction of 3D mineralization wireframes

completed by the author, Carl Edmunds, P.Geo, Exploration Manager of Northgate

Minerals Corporation.

COMPOSITE CONTROL INTERVALS

The 234 resource related composite control intervals were defined based on a 2.3gpt

gold economic cut-off grade, a 1.7gpt gold incremental cut-off grade, and a three metre

minimum true thickness (Table 25-1 in Appendix 2). There are a smaller number of

intersections above the 2.3gpt economic cut-off grade that have not been included in the

however, some have good grades and could be incorporated in future resource estimates.

WIREFRAME MODELS

MINERALIZATION WIREFRAMES

The wireframes are based on a sectional interpretation by YD project staff that generated

a set of preliminary, all-inclusive mineralization shapes that included some sub-economic

intersections and a number of discontinuous hanging wall and footwall lenses. These

	

preliminary shapes were reviewed in December 2007 and comprised approximately 60

individual bodies. These interim shapes were used effectively to guide the construction of

nine final wireframes that were formed from 3D polylines on 30m to 7.5m spaced plans

	

or sections, depending on the local complexity. These wireframes are snapped to the drill

	

holes and comply with the cut-off grade and 3 minimum width criteria. The final

wireframes were clipped with a current set of diabase dike wireframes prepared by YD

staff. The final mineralization wireframes used for the resource estimate are shown in

Figure 17-1.

Micon constructed wireframes for the historical underground development and the

main syenite-hosted stopes and pits at both MCM and YD mines. The current UBZ

wireframe was clipped in a north-south direction with a clipping polygon based on the

Micon (2004) wireframes of the underground excavations. Two clipping polygons were

developed to reflect a conservative (Indicated) and less conservative (Inferred) approach

to the areas of past mining. The final UBZ Indicated wireframe does not include any of

the remnant sill and rib pillars that were included in the Micon (2004) estimate. Northgate

has assumed for now that they are all unrecoverable.

Preliminary CMS data for the uppermost UBZ stope indicates a larger cavity than

currently modelled and that this may be due to rock slabs peeling off the original stope

walls and back and to locally inaccurate underground excavation wireframes. Presently

	

the impact of the larger void space is insignificant (25,000T) relative to the global

resource estimate, but underscores the need to complete an accurate survey of all the

underground mining areas as dewatering progresses.

DENSITY

The Micon 2004 resource estimate used a density of 2.69g/cm3 (11.9 cubic feet/ton)

based on 54 specific gravity tests on syenite material completed by Royal Oak. The 2006

drilling program generated considerably more specific gravity data including 459 on-site

immersion tests on syenite core that average 2.71g/cm 3 (Table 17-2). The syenite data

includes 67 tests on samples situated within the mineralization wireframes that average

2.69g/cm3. This new data corroborates well with the Micon 2004 tonnage factor. The

mineralized syenite specific gravity is slightly lower than for barren syenite and this

suggests that the increase in mineralization specific gravity expected from more pyrite

may be offset by the potassic alteration and silicification. In future it should be possible

to spatially model the specific gravity as more data becomes available.

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

CAPPING HIGH ASSAYS
Erratic high grade assays can have a large and disproportionate influence in the

estimation of the average grade of a gold deposit. The histogram of all of the assays

located within the final mineralization wireframes shown below suggests that high assays

should be capped at a level between approximately 16g/t Au, which might be considered

overly conservative, and 24g/t Au, which might be considered overly aggressive.

Consequently, 20g/t Au is a reasonable and round number that falls midway within this

range.

Cutting curves were built to investigate cutting sensitivity. The UBZ is the most

sensitive to cutting with approximately a 12% reduction to the resource assay average

grade at a 20g/t gold cutting level, while the LBZ (1 & 2) showed a 6.4% reduction in the

resource average assay grade cutting to the same level. The Lower YD Zone and Lucky

Zone are relatively insensitive to cutting levels above 20g/t gold (Table 17-4).

UBZ 4.798 4.200 -12% -3.8%
YD 3.540 3.416 -3.62% -2.1%

Overall, capping high assays reduces the average gold resource assay grade by

approximately 11% (Table 17-3) while the actual global resource block model cut

average grade is reduced by only 5.6%. Capping sensitivity work in the January 2006

estimate indicated that the LBZ resource was reduced by 16.1 % compared to 8.2% in the

current estimate. It is possible that increased numbers of drill intersections are having a

moderating affect on the amount of contained gold accounted for by the higher grade

intersections. An example of this is demonstrated by the UBZ, which is the most densely

drilled of the underground zones; capping reduces mean assay value by 12% which

translates on a resource basis to only 3.8%.

CUT-OFF GRADE

Northgate assumed a US$600/oz gold price, a 90% gold recovery, and a C$38/ton

underground operating cost to estimate a breakeven cut-off of approximately 2.3g/t

(Table 17-5). Also an incremental cut-off grade for lower grade underground

mineralization located in the wallrock immediately adjacent to economic mineralization

was estimated. The incremental cut-off grade for an underground mine is based on the

concept that the mining cost related to mining some additional wallrock material in

developed stopes is significantly less than the overall mining cost.

The incremental cut-off grade cost component is estimated using the process and

G&A costs and an incremental mining cost. An incremental cut-off grade of

approximately 1.7g/t Au was estimated based on the above assumptions and

approximately a $12/ton incremental mining cost. The current application of an

incremental cut-off grade has not increased the resource tonnage and decreased the

resource grade significantly.

TABLE 17-5 BREAKEVEN CUT-OFF GRADE ASSUMPTIONS

Northgate Minerals Corporation - Young -Davidson Project, Ontario

Description Assumption

Underground Mining C$22.00/ton

General & Administration C$4.00/ton

Gold price (US$) US$600/oz

Gold price (C$) C$571/oz

Gold recovery 90%

The US$600/oz gold price assumption is conservative for a 2007 year-end resource

estimate and more appropriate for a reserve estimate. At US$650/oz, the breakeven and

incremental cutoff grades decrease to 2.0g/t Au and 1.5g/t An. In general, the resource

estimate is not very sensitive to breakeven cut-off grades in approximately the 2.0g/t Au

to 2.5g/t Au range and incremental cut-off grades in approximately the 1.5g/t Au to 2.0g/t

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

An range. Notwithstanding, a moderate increase in the resource estimate would be

expected at higher gold prices.

The resource tonnage would increase significantly at approximately a breakeven

cutoff of 1.0g/t, which would require a gold price of approximately US$1300/oz.

The drill hole intersections related to the Young-Davidson underground resources

estimated by Northgate were defined based on approximately a 1.7g/t Au cut-off grade

and approximately a 2.3g/t Au cut-off grade was used to constrain the resource

wireframes. Some exceptions were made in order to preserve internal zone continuity.

COMPOSITING

Approximately 81% of the resource assays have sample lengths that are less than or

equal to 1.52m (5-feet) and less than three percent of the resource assays have lengths

greater than four metres. Northgate created two sets of 1.5m equal length composites

within the mineralization wireframes; one set represented composites generated from un-

capped assays, while the other set were generated from capped assays. A small number

of shorter remnant composites that are mostly situated at the mineralization northern or

footwall contacts were retained.

VARIOGRAPHY

There is not sufficient data available to carry out meaningful variography studies on

the YDZ, Lucky Zone, and LBZ mineralization. Micon (2004) used the UBZ data to

generate a number of well-behaved variograms and interpreted a maximum range of

approximately 120m oriented -80° south or down-dip, an intermediate range of 60m

along an east-west strike direction and an across strike range of approximately 15m. In

general, the Micon (2004) variograms suggest down-dip continuity of approximately

120m, along strike continuity of approximately 60m, and across strike continuity of

approximately 15m, which represents approximately an 8:4:1 anisotropy.

DM TOKJ273374-00004/2510147 AA



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

Currently there is insufficient data to generate useful variograms for the YD Zones,

Lucky Zone, and LBZ mineralization. This condition may persist until a significant

amount of underground drilling and sampling data are available. At that point more

variography work is recommended preceded by trend analysis.

TREND ANALYSIS

The composite control data was used to create gold grade and thickness contours on

east-west vertical longitudinal projections. No definitive grade or thickness trends were

evident and the 2:1 subvertical attenuation suggested by the variography is not clearly

defined. Overall, the mineralization appears to rake moderately to the west with thicker

centres and thinner flanks. In some places the contours are not continuous across the

dikes suggesting the possibility of post-mineralization vertical displacements between

some of the diabase dikes.

TRUE THICKNESSES

True thicknesses were estimated directly in Vulcan. The Vulcan results are dependent

on an average dip and strike and they were found to be less reliable locally where there

were strike or dip variations from average. True thicknesses were also measured directly

on-screen from cross sections where more accurate values were needed. The true

thickness data were used to: confirm that the composite control intersections satisfied the

minimum thickness requirements; to guide how far to extend the wireframe boundaries;

and to assist in the resource classification.

MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

The definitions for resource categories used in this report are those defined in CIM

	

(2000 and 2004) and adopted by NI 43-101. In the CIM classification, a Mineral

Resource is defined as "a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or

fossilized organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of
DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

such grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction".

Resources are classified into Measured, Indicated, and Inferred categories.

In 2006 Scott Wilson RPA developed Mineral Resource classification criteria for the

YD Project syenite-hosted underground mineralization based on the following

assumptions:

1. The UBZ maximum variogram ranges of continuity are approximately 120m
down-dip, 60m along strike, and 15m across strike.

2. The mineralization has greater continuity down-dip than along strike and
variography work to date suggests an anisotropy ratio of approximately 8:4:1.

3. No definitive down plunge mineralization trends have been established,
however, a steep westerly rake may exist.

4. Thick mineralization extends further than thin mineralization.

A straight distance from block centroid to the nearest composite type of classification

	

system may not perform very well at the YD Project because of the significant spatial

variability observed in mineralization thickness. There is more uncertainty related to

mineralization shape or tonnage than gold grade. Consequently, for the January 2006

estimate Scott Wilson RPA developed some maximum down-dip and along strike

extrapolation distance guidelines as a function of true thickness which have been adopted

and simplified for the current estimate (Table 17-6). The distance values in Table 17-6

were used as a general guideline for defining Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources.

Approximate true thicknesses were measured for each intersection on north-south

cross sections (Table 25-1 in Appendix 2). The UBZ true thicknesses range from 0.2 to

51m and average 13.3m. The LBZ true thicknesses range from approximately 1.6m to

43m and average 11.3m. The Lucky Zones' true thickness ranges from 2.4m to 19.5m

and averages 6.8m, while YD Zone's true thickness ranges from 0.4m to 30.7m and has

an average width of 10.1 m

Preliminary mineralization wireframes were displayed on east-west oriented

longitudinal projections showing the drill hole pierce points, gold grades, and

approximate true thicknesses. Inferred resource outlines were manually digitized and

used to trim the preliminary mineralization wireframes to create a set of Inferred

mineralization wireframes. Indicated resource outlines were manually digitized and used

to create a separate set of Indicated mineralization wireframes from the Inferred

wireframes (Figures 25-1 to 25-5 in Appendix 2).

The maximum down-dip and along strike extrapolation distances used to outline

Indicated areas was 120m and 60m, respectively. The maximum down-dip and along

strike extrapolation distances used to outline Inferred areas was approximately 200m and

100m, respectively. Shorter extrapolation distances were used in areas with thinner

mineralization. In addition, resources defined by single intersections or wider spaced

drilling were automatically classified as Inferred.

BLOCK MODELLING

BLOCK MODEL GEOMETRY AND BLOCK SIZE

The blocks are 15m high by 15m east-west by 7m north-south. The block model is

	

not rotated and has 82 columns, 65 rows, and 91 levels. The block model has 485,030

blocks. A block situated entirely within mineralization (i.e., block mineralization percent

equals 100%) represents 4,236 tonnes. The block model has 12,259 mineralization

blocks that contain 1.0% to 100% mineralization. Only 1,575 blocks are 100% within the

mineralized wireframes.

DM TOR/273374-00004/2510147.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

The block model origin is at 22,650E, 10,170N, and the 8,820m elevation and the

block model extends up to the 10,185m elevation. The information for each block in the

model includes:

• The percentage of the mineralization wireframe model that is in each block.

• Lens codes for each block.

• Interpolated Au and cut Au grades related to blocks that contain at least 1%
mineralization.

• Indicated and Inferred identifiers for all mineralization blocks.

• The average distance of composites used to interpolate block mineralization
grades.

• Number of samples used to estimate grade and number of holes used to
estimate grade.

GRADE INTERPOLATION AND SEARCH STRATEGY

Inverse distance squared was used to interpolate the gold and cut gold values.

Ordinary kriging criteria have not been developed, however, this may warrant

consideration in the future when more data are available.

A search ellipsoid based on a minimum of two and a maximum of twelve composites

was used to interpolate gold and cut gold grades into blocks using a single-pass process.

A single search ellipse measuring 200 x 100 x 50 was employed to interpolate grade into

blocks. Search ellipsoid was oriented east-west for the secondary axis, with the primary

axis dipping 75 degrees south parallel to the general dip and strike across the property. In

addition, a lens code identifier was assigned to each composite, and composite target

restrictions applied were such that the composites for one lens could not be used to

interpolate grades for another lens.

The search radii and orientations used for interpolation are summarized in Table 17-7.

The overall average distance between block centroids and informing composites is

63m and 92m for Indicated and Inferred blocks, respectively. The maximum distance

used to interpolate Indicated and Inferred blocks is 200m. Approximately 93% of the

Indicated blocks are supported by distances less than 120m, which is consistent with the

general classification guidelines.

BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION

Northgate used three methods to validate its block model Mineral Resource estimate:

1. Visual inspection and comparison of block grades with composite and assay
grades.

2. Statistical comparison of resource assay and block grade distributions.

3. Volumetric comparisons of final mineralization wireframes and block model
resource reports for each lens.

4. Inspection of resource assay and block grade scatter plots by elevations.

Northgate compared the block grades with the composite grades on sections and plans

and found good overall visual correlation with some minor low and high grade smearing

and banding problems due to local changes in strike and dip. As more data become

available in the future from closer spaced underground definition drilling, it may be

possible to refine the model by adding more customized search orientations related to

smaller structural domains.

The resource assays, 1.5m composites, Indicated blocks at a zero cut-off grade, and

Inferred blocks at a zero cut-off grade, all cut to the capping levels described earlier,

average essentially the same value at 3.91 g/t Au, 3.71 g/t Au, 3.68g/t Au, and 3.54g/t Au,

DM TOR12 73 3 74-00004125 1 0 1 4 7.4A



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION

respectively. This indicates that there have been no significant grade shifts between the

assays, composites and the block model.

Northgate examined the distribution of the composite gold and cut gold grades versus

	

block grades on scatter plots by elevations and found no problems with the block model

grades (Figures 25-5 to 25-14 in Appendix 2).

The underground cut gold grade block models for all of the lenses are shown in the

3D perspective looking down to the northeast in Figure 17-3. The classification block

model, with Indicated blocks in red and Inferred blocks in blue, is shown in Figure 17-4.

MINERAL RESOURCES

The January 2008 Upper Boundary Zone, Lower Boundary Zone, Lucky Zone, and

Lower YD Zone underground Mineral Resources extend from approximately the 8,830m

elevation to the 10,155m elevation. This represents vertical depths ranging from

approximately 200m to 1,500m below surface.

The resource estimate is based on a bulk underground mining concept with no mining

selectivity. Consequently, the resource estimate is reported at a zero cut-off grade, which

means that it includes a minor amount of internal waste. Approximately three percent of

the global resource estimate tonnage is related to internal waste or blocks with grades

below 1.7g/t gold and a further 9% is related to incremental mineralization with grades in

the 1.7g/t to 2.3g/t gold range.

The Indicated Mineral Resources of the UBZ, LBZ, Lucky Zone, and Lower YD

Zone total 11.9 million tonnes at an average cut grade of 3.7g/t gold and contain 1.42

million ounces of gold. The Inferred Mineral Resources total 4.2 million tonnes at an

average cut grade of 3.2g/t gold and contain 0.44 million ounces of gold (Table 17-8).

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The 2006-2007 drilling program expanded the YD Project underground resources.

Northgate plans to complete the surface drilling program in 2008 and is advancing an

underground exploration program. This will generate a significant amount of new data

over the next year or two. There remains good potential to increase the underground

resources as there are open gaps between mineralized lenses and several scattered

hangingwall intercepts that may form continuous zones with further drilling.

The syenite-hosted gold mineralization exhibits good gold grade continuity. The

mineralization occurs generally as east-west striking, steeply south dipping, vertically

attenuated lenses with local flexures and tapered flanks. The LBZ 1 lens is the largest

continuous lens of mineralization defined to date and is probably correlated to the UBZ.

It extends laterally east-west for at least 280m, vertically for at least 1,000m, and reaches

43m in true thickness. The resource mineralization true thicknesses average 13.3m at

UBZ, 11.3m at the LBZ, 10.1 m at YD and 6.8 at the Lucky Zones.

	

The current resource estimate is based on a US$600/oz gold price. There is potential

to increase the true thicknesses in some of the resource drill hole intersections if a lower

incremental cut-off grade is used in future resource estimates that are based on higher

gold prices.

There is evidence that there are a number of subparallel, possibly anastomosing,

generally east-west striking, alteration corridors exist that host the resource lenses defined

so far. Some of these lenses may grow and merge with adjacent lenses as the results for

infill drilling become available. As more information becomes available, it may be

possible to correlate continuous alteration corridors using the gold assays at a low cut-off

grade, the multi-element data, and other information.

	

The Indicated Mineral Resources of the UBZ, LBZ, Lucky Zone, and YD Zone total

11.9 million tonnes at an average cut grade of 3.7g/t gold and contain 1.42 million ounces

of gold. The Inferred Mineral Resources total 4.2 million tonnes at an average cut grade

The August 2004 open pit resource estimate by Micon, are current resource estimates

that represent additional resources, which are unaffected by the above estimate (Table 19-

2). There are no known mining, metallurgical, environmental or infrastructure factors

that materially affect the current underground and open pit resource estimates.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS

The following work is warranted:

1. Continue the surface drilling program (A) and surface exploration (B) program as
described in summary form in Table 20-1. This program includes the following:

• Update the Micon (2004) open pit resource estimate based on revised gold
price, pit optimization, recently completed drill holes for which results
were not available at the time of writing of this report, and other resource
estimation parameters.

• Continue data verification and validation program on drill holes that
support open pit and UBZ resources, particularly in reference to
underground workings surveying.

•

	

Review the capping levels prior to the next resource estimate.

•

	

As new data becomes available, carry out trend analysis work including
grade, thickness, and grade-times-thickness contouring on longitudinal
projections, and geostatistical studies to determine possible plunge
orientations and ranges of continuity for each lens.

•

	

Continue to refine the diabase wireframes.

•

	

Construct updated wireframes for the main rock types.

•

	

Try to correlate continuous alteration corridors using the gold assays at a
low cut-off grade, the multi-element data, and other information.

• Construct mineralization wireframes at a number of incremental cut-off
grades to develop a preliminary tonnage-grade curve for the YD Project
underground syenite-hosted resources.

•

	

Continue to carry out detailed structural mapping of surface outcrops, pits
and underground workings.

2. Complete the underground exploration (A) and development (B) program on the
syenite-hosted mineralization at the YD Project.
